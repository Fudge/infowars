[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:32.940]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.940 --> 00:40.020]  it is Monday November 12th 2012 I am your host Alex Jones and we're going to be
[00:40.020 --> 00:45.100]  here for the next three hours live today Bev Harris will pop in for about 30
[00:45.100 --> 00:52.660]  minutes at the start of the broadcast in the second hour she will pop in to
[00:52.660 --> 00:57.020]  break down amazing news about this story by Michael Schneider the American
[00:57.020 --> 01:02.620]  Dreamblog and it breaks down the numbers election fraud Obama won more than 99
[01:02.620 --> 01:08.220]  percent of the vote in more than 100 Ohio precincts and we see similar numbers
[01:08.220 --> 01:12.420]  like this all over it's not that I'm even saying Romney's a good guy people say
[01:12.420 --> 01:16.580]  well we had to be heard the calls Friday that people said are you a racist and I
[01:16.580 --> 01:22.260]  said no and they said but you don't like Obama and the public is dumb down to
[01:22.260 --> 01:27.820]  that level or not even dumb down it's like childlike minds it's kind of like
[01:27.820 --> 01:35.980]  Native Americans selling Manhattan for a box of glass beads well they didn't
[01:35.980 --> 01:41.820]  even have a concept of selling something or of a deed so I mean it's the same
[01:41.820 --> 01:48.580]  thing how do you communicate with people who cannot grasp even low-level
[01:48.580 --> 01:54.940]  concepts very very simple concepts how do you deal with a population in a
[01:54.940 --> 01:59.740]  zombie-like state who wants to be in a zombie-like state who wants to be in a
[01:59.740 --> 02:04.460]  lethargic state who who wants to not know what's going on around them and who
[02:04.460 --> 02:08.740]  just wants to shuffle through life like they never even existed thank God I'm
[02:08.740 --> 02:13.940]  not one of those people that's all I can say thank the my heavenly father above
[02:13.940 --> 02:19.580]  that I was given some spark of energy and humanity but it's the additives in
[02:19.580 --> 02:24.580]  the food it's the entertainment it's the entire culture is just falling apart but
[02:24.580 --> 02:27.740]  I will open the phones up again I should have done this a long time ago and we
[02:27.740 --> 02:33.860]  open them up for everybody but the Obama supporters you know rarely are able
[02:33.860 --> 02:38.580]  to get through but today we're open the phones up again in the first hour we
[02:38.580 --> 02:43.420]  come back from break for Obama supporters to call in and and they're not
[02:43.420 --> 02:49.180]  being sarcastic and say you're a racist and everybody can hear where this is
[02:49.180 --> 02:55.620]  going identity politics pure and simple and people not able to grasp the fact
[02:55.620 --> 02:59.220]  that we know Romney was a globalist as well that Obama was funded by the same
[02:59.220 --> 03:05.540]  people as Romney either way they would win but that the system was rigged so
[03:05.540 --> 03:09.460]  that Obama could come in because they think he can push their agenda better
[03:09.460 --> 03:15.500]  and get people to cheerlead war as peace we're seeing 1984 come true so they
[03:15.500 --> 03:19.900]  will cheer selling out their birthright in their future for literal
[03:19.900 --> 03:29.060]  subsistence level government payouts so this is the type of information that we
[03:29.060 --> 03:33.860]  are going to be breaking down here today Paul Watson also is going to be
[03:33.860 --> 03:41.460]  popping in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast to talk about incredible new
[03:41.460 --> 03:46.780]  TSA developments but here's Paul Watson's latest article at prisonplanet.com
[03:46.780 --> 03:54.900]  and infallwars.com drivers questioned on guns at federal checkpoint and this is
[03:54.900 --> 03:58.100]  all part of the conditioning when they roll something new out like this it's
[03:58.100 --> 04:04.380]  all done to sound reasonable to set the precedent and then Katie Katie bar the
[04:04.380 --> 04:07.700]  door hey we're just gonna have some federal screeners checking bags for
[04:07.700 --> 04:11.300]  bombs after 9-11 that sounds reasonable we're just gonna have you take your shoes

[04:27.260 --> 04:31.140]  highways and have TSA there and search you along with federal troops this is

[08:11.940 --> 08:30.540]  Alex Jones show
[08:30.540 --> 08:37.980]  ladies and gentlemen I am your host Alex Jones and we are engaged here in a
[08:37.980 --> 08:44.020]  desperate attempt to shake humanity out of its deepening coma we are engaged
[08:44.020 --> 08:50.040]  here today on this Monday 12th of November 2012 transmission trying to set
[08:50.040 --> 08:55.100]  brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and we've got an
[08:55.100 --> 08:59.700]  incredibly important broadcast today lined up for you on so many fronts but
[08:59.700 --> 09:04.300]  I want to just give listeners the good news here because most of you are not
[09:04.300 --> 09:08.260]  prominent or not public figures you really don't have a very good way to
[09:08.260 --> 09:15.740]  gauge how big the awakening is but I can go anywhere in the world Europe Latin
[09:15.740 --> 09:21.820]  America you name it and walk down the street and have every 10th person stop
[09:21.820 --> 09:27.780]  and shake my hand and this weekend I took my wife and children to the Texas
[09:27.780 --> 09:32.860]  Renaissance Festival that I had been to since I was a child it was a lot of fun
[09:32.860 --> 09:38.500]  because it wasn't a big establishment Disney World thing with checkpoints and
[09:38.500 --> 09:42.100]  there wasn't any TSA and there were thousands of people walking around with
[09:42.100 --> 09:47.660]  real swords and daggers everywhere and the cops were nice and then we also then
[09:47.660 --> 09:52.940]  went down to Houston yesterday and went to the aquarium down there and I shot
[09:52.940 --> 09:55.380]  some footage of all this will be premiering on the nightly news and the
[09:55.380 --> 10:02.900]  radio show this week as well but the point is I got mobbed if I started
[10:02.900 --> 10:07.340]  talking people really recognize my voice and I start talking to one person and
[10:07.340 --> 10:10.340]  then another person will hear me talk and then pretty soon I'd have five or
[10:10.340 --> 10:13.940]  six people forming around me and I'd say bye bye and you know get out of there
[10:13.940 --> 10:19.940]  and walk because if I kept talking it would end up being a crowd gathering
[10:19.940 --> 10:26.540]  around me every shop I went in every shop whether it was a coffee shop or a
[10:26.540 --> 10:31.820]  place where I bought some replica Tomahawks it didn't matter and here
[10:31.820 --> 10:36.900]  were all these small vendors small manufacturers and it was really a free
[10:36.900 --> 10:43.020]  market situation with with the great jugglers and people jousting and a guy
[10:43.020 --> 10:47.260]  that was lighting his whips on fire and doing these night shows and fireworks I
[10:47.260 --> 10:54.020]  mean it was Americana and I had a great time but the good news here is that
[10:54.020 --> 10:59.380]  every time I go out in public now more and more and more people come up to me
[10:59.380 --> 11:06.180]  and again I could be sitting there at a table outside of the trees in the dark
[11:06.180 --> 11:11.140]  as we stayed until nighttime talking and people would just be walking by and
[11:11.140 --> 11:17.340]  stopping and I mean a lot of people came up to me and so there's a gauge of how
[11:17.340 --> 11:24.380]  many people are starting to wake up just to give you an idea that's just just a
[11:24.380 --> 11:30.460]  snapshot and it's again not Alex Jones up here yours truly if you're just
[11:30.460 --> 11:35.740]  tuning in for the first time saying who aren't I a big shot no no no it's kind
[11:35.740 --> 11:38.540]  of creepy in a way to know the globalists are fully aware of what I'm
[11:38.540 --> 11:48.460]  doing and I was driving through Houston on our way out yesterday and Richard
[11:48.460 --> 11:53.460]  Reeves was with us and I looked over and Richard said look at that it's the
[11:53.460 --> 12:01.940]  George Herbert Walker Bush Memorial or monument is what they call it and I and
[12:01.940 --> 12:05.380]  I pulled over there and shot some video of that and followed a report that's up
[12:05.380 --> 12:10.700]  at info wars.com a headline Alex Jones visits a temple of evil and people say
[12:10.700 --> 12:14.100]  well are you calling it a temple well it's set up with temple guardians it's
[12:14.100 --> 12:21.220]  set up in a Romanesque temple god format for those that don't understand who are
[12:21.220 --> 12:25.780]  profane as the new ruler crowd would call you this is a guy into the occult
[12:25.780 --> 12:31.740]  this is a skull and bones Illuminati chapter 322 guy but I was just creeped
[12:31.740 --> 12:38.500]  out to sit there look at this big 12-foot bronze statue and realize that a
[12:38.500 --> 12:42.540]  lot of people think that guy is a good guy and is going to save him it's like a
[12:42.540 --> 12:45.740]  lot of people think Obama is a good guy and is going to save him when they're
[12:45.740 --> 12:50.940]  just globalist frontmen and that there were some Republicans there four or five
[12:50.940 --> 12:54.060]  people and a couple of them knew I was but the others were thinking I was a bad
[12:54.060 --> 12:59.780]  person for talking bad about George W. Bush I or George Herbert Walker Bush I
[12:59.780 --> 13:05.580]  must have been a evil Democrat just like when Democrats tune in and I'm
[13:05.580 --> 13:10.620]  criticizing Obama they automatically think I must be a mainline Republican and
[13:10.620 --> 13:16.020]  it just shows the incredible shallowness of people and that's been
[13:16.020 --> 13:21.740]  learned that's been that's been hammered into them so before I get into the off
[13:21.740 --> 13:29.420]  the chart economic news election fraud news now completely emerging before I
[13:29.420 --> 13:34.180]  get into a FEMA camp that's a nightmare situation Camp Sandy before I get into
[13:34.180 --> 13:38.980]  the latest on Petraeus and the calls for him to testify and that whole
[13:38.980 --> 13:43.100]  resignation if you really believe it's over that female honeypot they set him
[13:43.100 --> 13:48.180]  up with I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you before I get into federal check
[13:48.180 --> 13:54.060]  points on highways asking about your firearms before I get to all of that
[13:54.060 --> 14:00.940]  today I wanted to give the number out again and I know a lot of people are
[14:00.940 --> 14:06.540]  upset by this we're getting hundreds of calls at the office literally emails
[14:06.540 --> 14:12.180]  text messages stuff pouring in comments on info wars comm imprisonment dot com
[14:12.180 --> 14:29.020]  saying let us on let us respond to the Obama noise I don't want people calling
[14:29.020 --> 14:32.780]  in claiming they're an Obama supporter being sarcastic we clearly had some of
[14:32.780 --> 14:38.300]  those yesterday or not yesterday last Friday last live show I did had a great
[14:38.300 --> 14:42.300]  rebroadcast with some premier special reports yesterday on the Sunday show
[14:42.300 --> 14:48.100]  four to six central and you will get your chance to be on as constitutionalist
[14:48.100 --> 14:51.260]  libertarians or people that agree or disagree whatever your political ilk
[14:51.260 --> 14:54.420]  when we just have open phones but it's I think it's more important a few days a
[14:54.420 --> 14:59.660]  week to give collectivist and to give Obama supporters because even after
[14:59.660 --> 15:03.180]  Aaron Dyches took over Friday in the third hour air some special reports he
[15:03.180 --> 15:07.060]  took some calls and I would have to run back in as he took the calls people are
[15:07.060 --> 15:11.860]  going I just want to know is Alex Jones a racist I think he's probably a racist
[15:11.860 --> 15:16.740]  and so the whole world now is about if you don't like big government if you
[15:16.740 --> 15:20.580]  don't like government health care if you don't like turning your guns in if you
[15:20.580 --> 15:24.100]  don't like the CPS taking people's kids without due process if you know their
[15:24.100 --> 15:27.940]  pedophile ring run if you don't like the pedophile training that the TSA is
[15:27.940 --> 15:31.820]  doing with slave training if you realize we're going into classical
[15:31.820 --> 15:36.100]  tyranny you see what Chris Matthews says oh you don't like big government you
[15:36.100 --> 15:39.420]  must be a racist oh you're against gun control I had the Austin
[15:39.420 --> 15:46.060]  American statesman call me once and say back in 1998 famous video online or
[15:46.060 --> 15:50.380]  99 when we caught bribery going on down at the Texas Capitol and they called me
[15:50.380 --> 15:54.300]  and they said are you racist and I said let me call you back at your number at
[15:54.300 --> 15:58.260]  the statesman I said I don't believe this is really a statesman person calling
[15:58.260 --> 16:05.580]  my home he said I assure you mr. Jones I am and he wasn't a black guy
[16:05.580 --> 16:09.740]  black guys I caught being paid off the Texas Ethics Commission did say it was
[16:09.740 --> 16:13.740]  illegal what went on it was actually the liberals marching black guys up to say
[16:13.740 --> 16:17.740]  look we're scary black guys you know we used to be gangbangers you want to ban
[16:17.740 --> 16:23.780]  guns basically or we'll get guns and they were using them to shell a stereotype
[16:23.780 --> 16:29.020]  to restrict the second moment that's how they got the first gun laws in this
[16:29.020 --> 16:32.860]  country passed at the end of the Civil War when blacks were gaining their
[16:32.860 --> 16:39.140]  freedom they or at least a higher level of it need a new earpiece during the
[16:39.140 --> 16:41.740]  break I'm just gonna give you guys the heads up so we don't go through a whole
[16:41.740 --> 16:45.820]  deal this was shattered keeps coming out my ear anyways getting back to what I
[16:45.820 --> 16:51.340]  was saying it's why call the statesman back the local paper and then the guy
[16:51.340 --> 16:54.980]  said okay you ready to the interview now he says show are you a racist I went
[16:54.980 --> 17:01.060]  well well no I'm not I mean I caught these guys being paid off after their
[17:01.060 --> 17:06.180]  testimony the Texas Ethics Commission of the Legislatured the Ethics
[17:06.180 --> 17:09.140]  Committees investigating and the guy said well I just want to know of your
[17:09.140 --> 17:13.540]  racist would you have put these guys on TV if they would have been if they would
[17:13.540 --> 17:17.460]  have been white and I said well of course I would have ought to put anybody on
[17:17.460 --> 17:21.940]  television with this happening I put it on my local cable show here in Austin
[17:21.940 --> 17:26.420]  at the time and they still went with that in the newspaper changing the subject
[17:26.420 --> 17:30.740]  because it's not that they're actually trying to stop racism that's their stock
[17:30.740 --> 17:37.540]  in trade that's what they deal in and that wasn't a again a black guy that was
[17:37.540 --> 17:41.460]  calling me it was a Hispanic reporter again I forget the exact headline of
[17:41.460 --> 17:44.900]  the article of the guy's full name but I remember it was the cover of the metro
[17:44.900 --> 17:53.460]  and state you know about payments at capital start investigation I think was
[17:53.460 --> 17:57.220]  the headline but then it then the article itself kicked off with saying we
[17:57.220 --> 18:02.100]  asked Alex Jones if he would have put these guys in there of they would have
[18:02.100 --> 18:07.180]  been white and they do that just gets off balance but with the dumb down masses
[18:07.180 --> 18:11.820]  it really works I mean you've heard the callers I had a guy calling in a white
[18:11.820 --> 18:15.860]  guy promoting socialism I know that because the guys called many times and
[18:15.860 --> 18:20.260]  talks about how he's a white guy and the socialists and everything else and I
[18:20.260 --> 18:24.020]  said look I don't believe socialism really works it destroys societies they
[18:24.020 --> 18:29.060]  said oh that's a nice John Birch society point and it's not that saying I'm John
[18:29.060 --> 18:32.980]  Birch society hurts me it's that that's what Chris Matthews says it's like they
[18:32.980 --> 18:38.540]  only say four or five things conspiracy theorist racist old white guys I saw the
[18:38.540 --> 18:43.580]  cover of the Time Magazine or is it Newsweek that's coming out where it
[18:43.580 --> 18:49.100]  shows Obama conquering and it says the end of the end of white guys and that's
[18:49.100 --> 18:52.340]  the talking point hey we're going to take your future we're going to take your
[18:52.340 --> 18:58.100]  jobs we're going to put you on welfare but but women and quote minorities who
[18:58.100 --> 19:02.260]  are the majority together it's your time now the government you're teamed up with
[19:02.260 --> 19:06.660]  the government we're going to get the white guys and and then that makes
[19:06.660 --> 19:10.980]  white guys automatically go into a gang mentality against all the other
[19:10.980 --> 19:18.300]  groups and so the system knows exactly what they're doing they know exactly
[19:18.300 --> 19:21.980]  what they're engaging in and it's basically the same way you control a
[19:21.980 --> 19:25.600]  prison they've known for a long time you put different ethnic groups in a
[19:25.600 --> 19:29.180]  prison put them in their own areas and they'll fight with each other instead of
[19:29.180 --> 19:32.660]  the jail guards and then you'll have a leader over the white supremacists the
[19:32.660 --> 19:38.900]  black groups the Hispanic groups and then that also forms the new culture once
[19:38.900 --> 19:42.660]  they hit the streets so it's institutional tribalism divide and
[19:42.660 --> 19:45.900]  conquers what it really is the system calls it racism but then the
[19:45.900 --> 19:49.740]  government picking economic winners giving giant government contracts to
[19:49.740 --> 19:54.180]  select groups globalist corporations that's not even discussed because down
[19:54.180 --> 19:57.940]  here on the ground the masses are all fighting over religion and race and
[19:57.940 --> 20:03.060]  creed and things like that have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of

[24:14.220 --> 24:20.580]  me routinely it says GOP you're old you're white your history the Obama
[24:20.580 --> 24:28.020]  conquest and it shows him as Napoleon conquering the United States with a
[24:28.020 --> 24:34.020]  sword he comes with a sword that's right and as soon as they can get our guns
[24:34.020 --> 24:41.220]  folks their dream is to dominate us their dream is to take over our lives
[24:41.220 --> 24:48.500]  their dream is to destroy the family and everybody in this country and reduce us
[24:48.500 --> 24:55.060]  down to absolute slaves you imagine if Romney would have won and there would
[24:55.060 --> 25:02.900]  have been a headline about your your black your brown your history and again
[25:02.900 --> 25:06.500]  it's not that they're actually going to have all the quote minorities that are
[25:06.500 --> 25:11.060]  really the majority come get anybody if you looked at a G20 or Bilderberger
[25:11.060 --> 25:17.220]  globalist meeting it's all about 99% old white people it's that this is how you
[25:17.220 --> 25:22.780]  divide and conquer and whites are told you're bad your scum any culture you've
[25:22.780 --> 25:26.060]  got get rid of it I mean that's openly taught in all the universities that's on
[25:26.060 --> 25:31.300]  record everybody else is taught you're inherently bad if you're white and whites
[25:31.300 --> 25:36.500]  go well I'm inherently bad and it's meant to get rid of everybody's culture
[25:36.500 --> 25:44.180]  though and just integrate everything in to a giant plastic artificial culture so
[25:44.180 --> 25:47.180]  I want to hear from the Obama people I mean I was wondering why Thursday and
[25:47.180 --> 25:50.820]  Friday I was getting these calls going you're a racist and people laughing
[25:50.820 --> 25:59.140]  saying the age of the white man is over really I thought it was you know white
[25:59.140 --> 26:03.340]  people Christians who started the abolitionist movement I mean there's
[26:03.340 --> 26:06.520]  good white people there's bad white people there's good black people there's
[26:06.520 --> 26:11.700]  bad black people I thought it was all about the character of our deeds I thought
[26:11.700 --> 26:15.740]  feminism was going to empower women but now they're sexual objects and totally
[26:15.740 --> 26:19.200]  broken down and atomized and statistically more unhappy than they've
[26:19.200 --> 26:22.820]  ever been and their kids have been taken over by the state you see what was done
[26:22.820 --> 26:25.860]  in the black community now is going to be done in every community and so that's
[26:25.860 --> 26:30.940]  why the black community is held up as the ultimate goal the ultimate and
[26:30.940 --> 26:34.700]  everything stylish and good because it's not a black culture it's a new world
[26:34.700 --> 26:40.180]  order gangster pirate culture meant to destroy us and it's working quite nicely
[26:40.180 --> 26:46.340]  you go look at kids in small towns or big cities who you know black white
[26:46.340 --> 26:50.140]  Hispanic you name it they're following this gangster culture and the
[26:50.140 --> 26:54.060]  degeneration is going quite nicely and then those of us whether we be black
[26:54.060 --> 26:59.260]  white Hispanic Asian who who love God who love justice we're the bad guys in
[26:59.260 --> 27:02.980]  the Homeland Security reports it's the returning veterans the gun owners the
[27:02.980 --> 27:07.260]  libertarians the constitutionalists the anti-new world order people that actually
[27:07.260 --> 27:10.420]  says that in the federal manuals you can pull them up we're the ones that know
[27:10.420 --> 27:13.500]  the score it's like it's like Friday I'm saying we've got to stop these mega
[27:13.500 --> 27:20.100]  banks from taking over we've got to come together and we've got to realize we've
[27:20.100 --> 27:24.140]  been conquered by foreign offshore banks and you've got the Republicans you've
[27:24.140 --> 27:27.860]  got the Democrats you've got Jack Hunter at campaigns for liberty writing
[27:27.860 --> 27:32.260]  articles saying no more conspiracy no more about mega banks taking us over no
[27:32.260 --> 27:37.020]  more about CFR or trilateral commission or new world order but but I mean now
[27:37.020 --> 27:40.980]  it's here they're announcing the new world order oh but I'm even worse now
[27:40.980 --> 27:45.100]  for being right I mean how could I be worse I'm talking about the new world
[27:45.100 --> 27:47.900]  order the foreign banks that brag they've conquered us I'm showing news
[27:47.900 --> 27:52.900]  articles where they brag about it but that's in the financial papers so all
[27:52.900 --> 27:56.180]  the business people know hey you've been conquered you're not supposed to tell
[27:56.180 --> 27:59.820]  the general public that they're not supposed to be you know be told they've
[27:59.820 --> 28:03.620]  been conquered they're still being told give your rights up or Al Qaeda will get
[28:03.620 --> 28:09.260]  you meanwhile the government publicly runs Al Qaeda and Libya and Syria and
[28:09.260 --> 28:17.100]  Ron Paul talked about that on Friday with us so the good news is you're not
[28:17.100 --> 28:21.100]  gonna stop this measures from getting out the bad news is the public a large
[28:21.100 --> 28:24.620]  portion of it is so dumb down they would do anything they're told by the
[28:24.620 --> 28:28.460]  government they told them run and jump off that cliff or your racist there's a
[28:28.460 --> 28:32.420]  lot of people that would run jump off the cliff and it's just totally dumb

[33:44.300 --> 33:50.620]  empowered human being that understands that slaves are disarmed and when black
[33:50.620 --> 33:56.220]  folks working with white folks demanded and fought for their liberty back in the
[33:56.220 --> 34:04.660]  1860s and received it at least in name the first gun laws that were passed were
[34:04.660 --> 34:10.660]  so that black people couldn't own guns so I guess they were racist because they
[34:10.660 --> 34:15.540]  wanted their guns no they wanted to be able to protect their families it is
[34:15.540 --> 34:21.220]  such a secure feeling living in the countryside of Texas and the fact that
[34:21.220 --> 34:26.460]  it sounds like World War three on the weekends the crime rate maps for the
[34:26.460 --> 34:30.620]  state of Texas show the area I live in has some of the lowest crime not in
[34:30.620 --> 34:38.420]  Texas but in the United States I live in the 1% of the safest areas of the
[34:38.420 --> 34:43.820]  country I'm in the top 1% of the safest area even though quarter mile for my
[34:43.820 --> 34:47.660]  house are people that live in nice little trailer houses happy hard work
[34:47.660 --> 34:54.260]  and folks poor people working-class people but you know what they're rich
[34:54.260 --> 34:58.460]  culturally whether they're black white or Hispanic they've got their guns
[34:58.460 --> 35:02.340]  they've got their vehicle they've got their freedom they breathe fresh air and
[35:02.340 --> 35:06.540]  the globalists don't want that they want us crammed into these compact prison
[35:06.540 --> 35:13.380]  like cities and they're invoking total race now ladies and gentlemen invoking
[35:13.380 --> 35:18.060]  it to create divide and conquer toll-free number for Obama supporters to
[35:18.060 --> 35:22.700]  join us and tell us about their victory and why I'm bad for not liking Obama
[35:22.700 --> 35:26.420]  doesn't mean I love Mitt Romney but clearly Obama is more New World Order on
[35:26.420 --> 35:31.740]  the surface open borders wants to restrict guns massively shipping our
[35:31.740 --> 35:36.700]  jobs overseas more corporate bailouts warrantless wiretapping Chris Hedges
[35:36.700 --> 35:42.180]  big real liberal I admire him because he's a real guy saying Obama twice as
[35:42.180 --> 35:46.660]  bad as Bush so I want to hear about Bush all day long yeah we get Bush was bad
[35:46.660 --> 35:51.140]  the point is will we accept anything because he's got some pigment in his
[35:51.140 --> 35:55.860]  skin I mean you know I've been a show that hasn't really gotten much into race
[35:55.860 --> 36:00.620]  issues I've tried to wake people up to it but now it's on and and as the
[36:00.620 --> 36:04.140]  globalists get this country more and more and more as whites become the
[36:04.140 --> 36:07.500]  minority which is going to happen in about six seven years and then it's
[36:07.500 --> 36:14.260]  going to accelerate it's open season I mean whites get beat up and attacked all
[36:14.260 --> 36:17.700]  over the country you see it in local news and the media comes out later and
[36:17.700 --> 36:21.020]  says well we can't report because it would be racist to report on whites
[36:21.020 --> 36:26.820]  being racially attacked and man I tell you if the globalist ever get the
[36:26.820 --> 36:30.380]  general population's guns black white you name it it is just going to be a
[36:30.380 --> 36:34.300]  disaster they really want our guns but listen here's the issue they're not
[36:34.300 --> 36:40.580]  going to get them because of just sheer force of awareness people are buying
[36:41.020 --> 36:44.620]  millions and millions of guns on average about three million a month it's been
[36:44.620 --> 36:50.340]  as high as five million in a month this year and it's only accelerating and it's
[36:50.340 --> 36:53.980]  breaking the back of the globalist and I want to mention this article place some
[36:53.980 --> 36:58.300]  clips from it then I'll get into your calls then I'll cover Petraeus and this
[36:58.300 --> 37:02.220]  huge scandal and what's really behind that for my research people living like
[37:02.220 --> 37:06.020]  animals in the FEMA camp in New York and New Jersey we're living like animals
[37:06.020 --> 37:12.060]  daily mail sandy victims hit out after being forced to spend 12 days without

[37:16.580 --> 37:21.940]  weather gotta love that now FEMA's kicked out any reporters because so now
[37:21.940 --> 37:26.900]  the people are held in the camp on the news is black helicopters that's one of
[37:26.900 --> 37:30.260]  the headlines FEMA's camp freedom concentration camp with black Hawk
[37:30.260 --> 37:34.820]  helicopters flying above four people that didn't didn't think it was good to

[37:40.220 --> 37:47.820]  line headline unbelievable six rail struggle most in storms aftermath
[37:47.820 --> 37:55.620]  tragic find on Staten Island people dead in their homes frozen to death you name
[37:55.620 --> 38:04.780]  it unbelievable who's holding it together churches and private citizens but
[38:04.780 --> 38:07.500]  first I want to get to this and then I'm going to your phone calls okay before I
[38:07.500 --> 38:12.820]  get to just all of this other news right here Lindsey Graham we need Watergate
[38:12.820 --> 38:16.980]  type committee to investigate them causing Petraeus must testify yeah how
[38:16.980 --> 38:22.020]  obvious is all this before we go any further this is such a big article that
[38:22.020 --> 38:27.740]  Paul Joseph Watson did drivers questioned on guns at federal checkpoint this is
[38:27.740 --> 38:32.900]  that info wars.com and this is at prison planet.com please get it out to
[38:32.900 --> 38:37.700]  everyone you know retweet it it's up at real Alex Jones on Twitter Twitter.com
[38:37.700 --> 38:41.940]  forward real Alex Jones please retweet this story everybody you know and
[38:41.940 --> 38:48.020]  follow us there drivers questioned on guns at federal checkpoint and the way
[38:48.020 --> 38:52.820]  this newscast that I may even break this down on the nightly news tonight and we
[38:52.820 --> 38:55.780]  got Gerald Salenta on the nightly news tonight he's now filed suit against
[38:55.780 --> 39:00.540]  Google will tell you why he'll be on about that and other issues not someone
[39:00.540 --> 39:04.940]  to sue not a litigious person he's been forced to so he'll be joining us but I'm
[39:04.940 --> 39:08.180]  also going to break this video down tonight properly because there's so much
[39:08.180 --> 39:11.220]  propaganda I have to might take 20 minutes to do it I'm gonna have the time
[39:11.220 --> 39:18.460]  here but they they first they don't explain that last time I checked in Arizona over
[39:18.460 --> 39:26.060]  60% of the state is federal land another 10% or so a state I know that only one
[39:26.060 --> 39:29.260]  other state is ahead of Arizona for having more federal land and that's
[39:29.260 --> 39:34.260]  Nevada which is over 86% last time I checked and the government's
[39:34.260 --> 39:38.620]  grabbing and buying with taxpayer money more land and harassing people that have
[39:38.620 --> 39:42.700]  their farms and ranches inside of the property families that have been there
[39:42.700 --> 39:49.340]  pre you know pre-statehood or even territory but the issue here is I sit
[39:49.340 --> 39:54.580]  here and watch a newscast like this and my head starts spinning because there's
[39:54.580 --> 39:59.260]  so much data but here's the bottom line you remember the signs that went up two
[39:59.260 --> 40:04.940]  years ago and Paul Watson's got links to that in the article where they announced
[40:04.940 --> 40:11.460]  that upwards of 40% of Arizona was off limits the feds put up signs in the
[40:11.460 --> 40:15.580]  south and even some areas of the north saying do not enter this area law
[40:15.580 --> 40:19.420]  enforcement is standing down like they've said in Detroit do not come in this
[40:19.420 --> 40:24.300]  area it's too dangerous because of the five million illegals a year that go
[40:24.300 --> 40:27.940]  back and forth there because of the houses being burned down the mass
[40:27.940 --> 40:31.540]  murder the only thing holding it together is the Second Amendment now
[40:31.540 --> 40:35.660]  what's happened is citizens have started going into these national parks and
[40:35.660 --> 40:40.620]  preserves and because it's a constitutional state the feds haven't
[40:40.620 --> 40:45.420]  been able to go in and shut things down people used to go into national parks
[40:45.420 --> 40:51.660]  and deer hunt and and on other game that were there now people just go to do
[40:51.660 --> 40:55.620]  target practice and yeah a lot of people leave shotgun shells you name it in
[40:55.620 --> 40:59.540]  these giant areas that are thousands of square miles the illegals are dumping
[40:59.540 --> 41:05.660]  trash everywhere the illegals are doing whatever they want that's on record but
[41:05.660 --> 41:10.100]  citizens now going to and from and remember you have to drive across the
[41:10.100 --> 41:13.420]  these national parks if you look at the map so I'm gonna report tonight on this
[41:13.420 --> 41:18.820]  showing the maps on the nightly nose most the state drives over national parks
[41:18.820 --> 41:24.060]  so you've got to drive through these passes that are fingers of federal land
[41:24.060 --> 41:29.780]  so you're driving with your family and you pull up to an armed checkpoint and
[41:29.780 --> 41:35.340]  there is federal police out there with the most socialistic pro-new-world-order
[41:35.340 --> 41:38.660]  park rangers I run into them everywhere some of them aren't bad people but a lot
[41:38.660 --> 41:41.580]  of them are out of control well that's where socialists go to get their jobs
[41:41.580 --> 41:46.500]  it's one of their favorite places to TSA on steroids and they say oh let me see
[41:46.500 --> 41:50.860]  what guns you got even when you're not going into the park to go shooting and
[41:50.860 --> 41:53.380]  again this isn't like one of the Grand Canyon where there's tourists everywhere
[41:53.380 --> 41:57.940]  these parks are thousands of square miles I mean there's smugglers there's
[41:57.940 --> 42:02.460]  gunfights there's everything it's lawless but remember Border Patrol five years
[42:02.460 --> 42:05.740]  ago they ordered them to not arrest illegals but to go pick up garbage on
[42:05.740 --> 42:09.500]  the highways remember that or or the Border Patrol can sit at a checkpoint and
[42:09.500 --> 42:12.700]  look left or right but not both directions yeah they're told let the
[42:12.700 --> 42:15.780]  illegals go the feds tell the cities they won't come pick the illegals up
[42:15.780 --> 42:18.580]  illegals can drop drive they're above the law because it's part of the globalist
[42:18.580 --> 42:22.900]  program to drive down the wages and to give Mexico a steam valve of their
[42:22.900 --> 42:26.620]  criminals so that Mexico does it fall they don't want revolution to happen
[42:26.620 --> 42:30.260]  there and Mexico get any freedom they want to export the revolution here with
[42:30.260 --> 42:34.820]  with revolution hungry people but it'll be a little reconquista la infesora of
[42:34.820 --> 42:41.180]  the Southwest not of Mexico proper that means reconquer we take over okay so
[42:41.180 --> 42:45.860]  all of that's going on perfect globalist takeover plan because the a lot of
[42:45.860 --> 42:48.340]  folks don't speak Spanish even though this is going on but this is what's
[42:48.340 --> 42:53.180]  promoted on the radio stations they're named la infesora la reconquista la
[42:53.180 --> 42:56.500]  raza means the race just like you're saying if you're white your history on
[42:56.500 --> 42:59.900]  the cover of the newsweek well it's the same thing in the Spanish media and they
[42:59.900 --> 43:03.580]  pick on Hispanic kids that wear American flags right here in Austin Texas
[43:03.580 --> 43:08.460]  San Francisco it's been in the news they say just type American flags children
[43:08.460 --> 43:11.660]  send home for American flags you don't wear an old Navy shirt it's like you
[43:11.660 --> 43:15.060]  go because it's a gang thing they're like you get out of here okay you don't
[43:15.060 --> 43:18.700]  wear you don't fly those colors here the illegals pull down the American flags
[43:18.700 --> 43:24.620]  on at post offices private businesses you've seen in the news so understand the
[43:24.620 --> 43:28.060]  backdrop of this is you've got Hispanic Americans white Americans black
[43:28.060 --> 43:33.020]  Americans in this newscast going out and shooting their guns at areas that are
[43:33.020 --> 43:38.860]  popular shooting range is just out in the middle of the mountains well here
[43:38.860 --> 43:42.940]  come people saying well you're all guilty now because somebody was at a
[43:42.940 --> 43:47.980]  checkpoint yeah you just drove to the checkpoint you're guilty now because
[43:47.980 --> 43:52.060]  somebody else left some shotgun shell casings instead of the park rangers
[43:52.060 --> 43:55.780]  going to the areas where people tend to congregate even though it's a giant area
[43:55.780 --> 43:59.860]  people like to congregate in certain areas you go there where our grandfather
[43:59.860 --> 44:03.820]  shot so we still retain that right because we've exercised it and you've
[44:03.820 --> 44:08.700]  got these park rangers who obviously aren't fans of the Second Amendment I'll
[44:08.700 --> 44:14.340]  bet my right arm sitting there saying oh it's so reasonable oh it's so helpful
[44:14.340 --> 44:19.380]  it's so nice well everybody didn't seem to mind having them you know search
[44:19.380 --> 44:22.460]  their cars and they're being a reasonable that they will you go back and
[44:22.460 --> 44:26.340]  pick some brass up and I won't give you a ticket that that's just for the news
[44:26.340 --> 44:30.020]  to make it look reasonable and then and now they're setting up checkpoints all
[44:30.020 --> 44:35.980]  over the state with the feds searching your cars remember over 60% of the state
[44:35.980 --> 44:40.180]  is national parks that cut across highways everywhere and so the feds
[44:40.180 --> 44:44.460]  wherever they have their reservations their takeover beach heads they now
[44:44.460 --> 44:48.220]  harass you not just a hundred miles in from every coast and every border but
[44:48.220 --> 44:52.460]  all over the country then the news reports are coming in at beaches on the
[44:52.460 --> 44:57.180]  east coast and in North Carolina South Carolina they're doing this inside the
[44:57.180 --> 45:01.140]  towns they're doing it in the middle of the country around Colorado and national
[45:01.140 --> 45:04.060]  parks where you're driving along and they're like we're here to check for your
[45:04.060 --> 45:08.980]  guns well why I want to make sure you're not leaving brass on the ground no it's
[45:08.980 --> 45:12.380]  a way to get you used just like they admit gun buyback programs are to create
[45:12.380 --> 45:15.340]  the images of people lined up turning guns in this is how they've done in other
[45:15.340 --> 45:18.580]  countries so here's part of this newscast and I'm gonna air the whole thing
[45:18.580 --> 45:23.980]  tonight I promise I'm going to Brad Rashid and Joe here in just a moment but
[45:23.980 --> 45:30.340]  let's go ahead and play part of this local newscast KVOA they're acclimating
[45:30.340 --> 45:33.820]  you how great this is here it is and the National Forest Service is trying to
[45:33.820 --> 45:38.540]  keep Reddington pass clean and safe all day they stop drivers at a checkpoint
[45:38.540 --> 45:44.260]  trying to reinforce that message news for Tucson Sam Salzweightl joins us and
[45:44.260 --> 45:48.500]  brings us the story Sam oh people going in and out of Reddington pass ran into a
[45:48.500 --> 45:55.420]  surprise on the road for the most part everybody was happy with it it's a
[45:55.420 --> 46:00.460]  beautiful day for shooting in Reddington pass but some spots aren't as scenic as
[46:00.460 --> 46:05.260]  others it's kind of depressing it's you know it sets you a little bit because you
[46:05.260 --> 46:08.660]  know so it's a gorgeous out here forest rangers say most of the people shooting
[46:08.660 --> 46:16.660]  stay safe and responsible but not all of them you come out here to shoot to be
[46:16.660 --> 46:23.620]  gunsmen and it just ruins the sport okay that's enough that's enough and it
[46:23.620 --> 46:26.580]  shows the checkpoint the searching of the vehicles it's all up at info wars.com
[46:26.580 --> 46:30.820]  it's a long report and now now here's the deal if you're watching on prison
[46:30.820 --> 46:35.820]  planet TV have not just typed Reddington pass Arizona in to your search
[46:35.820 --> 46:41.060]  engine you'll notice that there's all these big towns and cities right around
[46:41.060 --> 46:48.420]  it you got that how do you pronounce that Taniquay Verde and all the how do
[46:48.420 --> 46:55.580]  you pronounce it Tonke Verde you've got all these towns and cities because I
[46:55.580 --> 46:58.860]  knew that I driven through there you've got to drive through the Green
[46:58.860 --> 47:02.420]  National Park through the major highways I mean if you've been to
[47:02.420 --> 47:06.980]  Arizona folks you're constantly driving through national parks and now hey
[47:06.980 --> 47:10.580]  guess what checkpoint and they admit that if you pull up the local newspaper
[47:10.580 --> 47:15.140]  articles about it and it's like most people didn't mind it's like saying most
[47:15.140 --> 47:18.420]  people didn't mind having their you know their freedom taken most people didn't
[47:18.420 --> 47:22.020]  mind property taxes that are unconstitutional turning your property
[47:22.020 --> 47:25.540]  into a rental most people didn't mind the school forcibly inoculating their
[47:25.540 --> 47:29.420]  kids outside of law most people didn't mind the school laptops watching their
[47:29.420 --> 47:33.500]  kids at home that's what they report in California and Pennsylvania and other
[47:33.500 --> 47:38.540]  states where the laptops watch you at home it's 1984 and they're like what's
[47:38.540 --> 47:43.940]  the big deal what's the big deal we're just watching you with the laptop at
[47:43.940 --> 47:47.460]  home I mean the government just watching you inside your house it's just a
[47:47.460 --> 47:54.300]  federal checkpoint it shows the federal guys out there federal marshals out
[47:54.300 --> 47:58.820]  there armed searching people and now in Colorado they just have armed check
[47:58.820 --> 48:03.100]  points with cops in green uniforms with machine guns aiming guns it's been on
[48:03.100 --> 48:06.220]  the news you can pull it up people just people put their hands up and get out
[48:06.220 --> 48:09.380]  of their cars they shut all highways down and they just aim guns at you just
[48:09.380 --> 48:14.020]  gonna aim this M16 at you you and your family how's that sound again we're
[48:14.020 --> 48:18.940]  being brought into martial law incrementally but they have all the
[48:18.940 --> 48:23.060]  idiots on the newscaster one I think it's no one in the newscast says they
[48:23.060 --> 48:25.500]  don't think it's reasonable you know that was done on purpose I just don't
[48:25.500 --> 48:29.180]  like it people are leaving gun brass out here so I'm guilty they're ruining it for
[48:29.180 --> 48:32.540]  the rest of us see instead of going out and busting people actually littering
[48:32.540 --> 48:36.860]  which they could pull up and do no no no we're gonna just say turn around and go

[50:03.140 --> 50:09.020]  that much respect you know this from Bush and you know I just can't believe

[50:26.100 --> 50:30.620]  worse can you do in four years well number one it's the idea that he's

[52:10.020 --> 52:15.140]  about RNA drops I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk
[52:15.140 --> 52:19.540]  is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in
[52:19.540 --> 52:24.140]  controlling how my cells organs and other tissues behave I learned I don't

[54:28.140 --> 54:31.500]  taxpayers to support Wall Street bailout and I have the clip from him during the
[54:31.500 --> 54:36.780]  campaign doing it and you heard that caller go that he was against it well
[54:36.780 --> 54:41.420]  that's because later a year after he got elected he said he was post he said he
[54:41.420 --> 54:45.540]  was against the Patriot Act and then fought to have it renewed he said he
[54:45.540 --> 54:49.860]  was against the NDA and then it turned out he wrote the bad provisions and
[54:49.860 --> 54:53.540]  demanded they be added then said don't worry I'll veto it so opposition would
[54:53.540 --> 54:58.340]  inform then signed it but I mean that's some dumb down supporters right there I'm

[56:19.900 --> 56:26.300]  enlightening me about the great Obama Obama's better than I mean typical
[56:26.300 --> 56:33.220]  racism disease itself I mean Obama had a chance to actually step down on that
[56:33.220 --> 56:39.180]  McCain take the order he did it because he chose to give people another chance
[56:39.180 --> 56:45.340]  while he's in public societies and communities that then ended up you know
[56:45.340 --> 56:53.460]  falling victim to drug and alcohol and gang violence. Sir Obama works for the
[56:53.460 --> 56:58.020]  same globals that ship in the narcotics he's continuing the Afghan control to
[56:58.020 --> 57:02.300]  control 93% of world opium production up from 10% 10 years ago
[57:02.300 --> 57:09.100]  Obama shipped General Motors to China and then yeah they'll pay out part of the
[57:09.100 --> 57:14.500]  pension fund for taxpayers I mean look do you understand it's like Indians saying
[57:14.500 --> 57:21.380]  thank you for for buying Manhattan from us for a little box of glass beads
[57:21.380 --> 57:24.980]  and the Indians thought they had a good deal do you understand sir that
[57:24.980 --> 57:34.700]  dependency is destroying us it's American Indian electors president and a black vice
[57:34.700 --> 57:41.940]  president and a Middle Eastern from wherever as Secretary of State you still
[57:41.940 --> 57:48.220]  have a problem with it you all about pushing propaganda of negativity in
[57:48.220 --> 57:56.940]  96 years on you had a comment box with a curtain but if it wasn't for the
[57:56.940 --> 58:00.740]  negative propaganda being pushed you would not be employed by the same
[58:00.740 --> 58:06.940]  government. I want to just say something else I'm very proud of the fact that I
[58:06.940 --> 58:11.300]  launched my shelf with a hundred dollar video camera and worked two jobs while I
[58:11.300 --> 58:17.540]  did it and in 1995 went to an access TV show and then got a local radio show and
[58:17.540 --> 58:22.460]  then got high ratings I mean you think it's I mean sir you that's what I'm
[58:22.460 --> 58:29.780]  all about is is coming from nowhere and you you said it it's racism so there
[58:29.780 --> 58:34.740]  you go folks I mean it is a religion sir you're the racist it's clear you don't
[58:34.740 --> 58:38.100]  like me because I'm white and you probably don't care the 52% of blacks
[58:38.100 --> 58:52.920]  are white. This is GCN the Genesis communications radio network. If you

[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:12.460]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:20.860]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:26.500]  Jones. I would have loved to kept that last guy on. We got Bev Harris coming on
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:30.660]  the premier expert on election fraud. There's a headline in infowars.com
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:35.380]  election fraud. Obama won more than 99% of votes and more than a hundred Ohio
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:41.420]  precincts. Does anybody believe that he won more than 99% you know you get a few
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:46.060]  thousand votes and he has like 99.8% that's official that's that's been
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:50.580]  released by the state and again people are like what you like Romney no I didn't
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:56.660]  like Al Gore and I said it looked like Bush cheated him. I hate Al Gore. That's
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:00.780]  what these people don't get. He's like well you don't like Obama you must be a
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:09.180]  racist. He said it's the same racism. You got Obama phone? Yes everybody in Cleveland and low minority got Obama phone.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:16.020]  People bum in president you know. Alright that's enough. Oh my gosh ladies and
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:21.540]  gentlemen I don't even know what to say anymore. If you just joined us it's just
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:27.780]  I hope for our future but I don't know. They've successfully
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:32.740]  attached socialism and dependency to race consciousness while telling whites
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:37.260]  to have no race consciousness except self-loathing. Everybody else has been
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:41.860]  told have race consciousness and it's the government and MSNBC that is your
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:47.260]  your God who is the high priest of racism and then if you don't like racism
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:51.860]  and you're white you're racist. I mean it is a new level and people are feeling
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.740]  good right now. It's like these idiots when their football team wins. They're
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:58.860]  like we won. I'm feeling really good right now. I thought you'd feel good if
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:02.180]  your kids grew up straight and strong got a good job had a good family. No that
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:06.060]  doesn't matter. My team my team's winning or I'm feeling really bad right now my
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:10.380]  team's losing and I've had people go we don't know about the football game. What
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:18.180]  are you some kind of homo? And I'm like no but I mean what does it have to do
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:22.700]  with it you know. I don't even know what to say anymore ladies and gentlemen. It's
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:27.540]  just beyond me. It's beyond me that I want the floor out of the water given
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:31.860]  as brain cancer off the charts. I want you to have freedom. I mean these black
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:37.580]  folks call in too and I go 52% of blacks are aborted. Official number. Like
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:42.460]  doesn't matter you're racist. And I'm like but I don't want your kids all die.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:49.060]  I want you to have a future. I want you to shut up racist. You know Obama's good.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:59.540]  The cover of Newsweek the Obama Conquest. If you're white you're history. And
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.620]  that's meant to make whites racist and get in our own gang and get everybody
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.860]  else in their gangs while the globalists divide and conquer us. The last thing
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.980]  they ever want is everybody getting along. They want you getting along the way
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:15.060]  they said with paramilitary troops keeping us apart. Man unbelievable divide
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:19.180]  and conquer. Let's talk to Joe in Brooklyn. Joe you're on the air. What
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:23.300]  do you think of that called? I guess you agree with him or? Yeah actually I have an
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:28.180]  idea if you're in for a store and a bomb a bomb a phone phone cover and have
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:33.540]  a picture of Obama and be on the phone and the property solely in force for
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:38.500]  your career. It'll be all doesn't get one. That is a that is a great idea. Now
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.620]  your phone's breaking up a bit. What was the last part you said about the
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:46.540]  Obama phone? Yeah it'll be a phone cover for the Obama phone. You can sell in
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:53.020]  the infowars store. Yeah and it's like and it's like I sold my soul or I gave
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:56.020]  up my entire life and future because I got the government gave me a free
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:03.340]  microwave oven. Exactly it's like um yeah basically um yeah so um anyway so
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:08.700]  basically in in um basically in in New York basically uh actually I'm not really
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:13.740]  um Obama or by support of um because I agree what's atoply that uh the Romney
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:20.860]  is um is will will um bring austerity and cut all the programs. It'll hurt to
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:24.500]  know class and hurt to break it. Listen listen when I hear that argument that's
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:28.380]  that even though I disagree with a lot of it I can go wow you cogent person
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:32.500]  you think Romney will do more corporate welfare and less welfare because yeah if
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.660]  you're gonna have a bunch of corporate welfare it's better at least here's the
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.180]  deal the the programs they've got are meant to make you dependent. If you had
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.940]  pure programs if you're gonna have socialism that actually built
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:45.660]  infrastructure and help people it'd still be bad long term but it's better
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:50.380]  than this but that's not what they're doing. My my beef is the mindless dumb

[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:13.540]  the Great Depression. America's worst drought in agricultural history and
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:18.020]  what about the presidential election. This perfect storm is a huge threat to
[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:22.460]  everyone's food supply. E-Foods Direct is preparing for the shortages and you had
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:27.220]  better do the same. I can warn you but I can't feed you. You know that E-Foods is

[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:20.060]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting world-wide it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:38.340]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to this Monday edition. I am your host Alex Jones and we
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:43.140]  are working on Dr. Steve Pachennick who's worked in Black Ops headed up the
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:47.460]  State Department's Black Ops program. His good friends with General Petraeus and
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:54.020]  said this whole thing was a Watergate set up to destroy Obama. Now he's not been
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:59.900]  a big fan of Obama and said the whole Bin Laden thing was fake but he says the
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:04.100]  Neocons are worse. He's been emailing us over the weekend and we're working on
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.780]  getting him on maybe at the start of the next hour or if not tomorrow maybe even
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:14.780]  the nightly news tonight at 7 o'clock central in FullWarsNews.com.
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:18.060]  For the next 30 minutes we're going to be joined by Bev Harris of course her
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:22.180]  research. She's won many times in court proving election fraud in different
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:26.380]  parts of the country California Ohio you name it. Her book was turned into
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:31.940]  Hacking Democracy on HBO and she described it last week with us as the
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.660]  most wall-to-wall fraud she's ever seen just just just just announcing states
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:40.700]  when no votes of that day were counted announcing a bunch of states against
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:45.140]  Romney and she's nonpartisan. I know in the past was more democratic now facts
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:48.780]  her facts Michael Schneider has an article up at info wars.com for the
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:54.380]  American Dream. Election fraud Obama won more than 99% of the vote in more than
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:59.100]  100 Ohio precincts and the source is the Ohio Secretariat State. They have the
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:05.660]  links to it and we have the scans of it and in some of these precincts you had
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:12.940]  thousands voting a lot of them had like 388, 597 you know those are the types of
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:20.820]  numbers that we're seeing here 733 and in precincts with 781 you'd have four
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:29.180]  people vote for Romney. I mean it is who believes out of 514 votes you'd get one
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.740]  for Romney. I mean you can go look at the numbers here and you can go to the
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:39.420]  different counties where they're posting these again again when when
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:44.540]  Bain Capital gave last time I checked close to double the money to Obama that
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:48.460]  they gave to Mitt Romney when when when he ran Bain and still has a big blind
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:52.700]  trust with it the fix is in it's not that I'm saying Romney was good either and
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:58.580]  these Obama supporters we've got Eric Rich, Marcus and others and we'll get to
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:01.580]  you and then I'll get into the Petraeus news after Bev leaves us she's been very
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:06.260]  nice to give us all these updates but now she's learned a lot more this is the
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:09.300]  type of stuff she's talking about sure she's caught die bold in their code
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:13.860]  designed for fraud sure it's come out and you know congressional hearings but
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:18.900]  now it's just we'll just announce all these states we'll announce Prop 37 when
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.100]  half the votes aren't counted they still haven't counted three million of them
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:27.260]  we'll just say whatever we want I mean it's reached a new cuckoo land and just
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:31.980]  like when Ron Paul got publicly robbed in Iowa and maimed by the Republicans he
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:35.140]  wouldn't buck it because you look like a sore loser and even though all this
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:40.460]  election fraud news is out and confirmed you'd think it'd be big news that in
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:47.820]  Ohio you'd have things going on like what we just mentioned 99% of the vote
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:54.580]  plus we're going about 95 98% in some of these areas going to Obama does any one
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:12:00.940]  does anyone believe that I mean this is incredible this is absolutely
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:06.300]  incredible and Bev Harris joins us on this in a cornucopia of other issues
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:10.380]  black box voting.org Bev thank you for giving us an update I know you'll know
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:14.020]  more in a couple more days but as you said last week if anybody even cares
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:18.060]  yes I care about the integrity of our election system thank God you and many
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:22.660]  others do tell Bev tell us tell us what you've discovered right now well you
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:26.900]  know I've been compiling information and I have a long way still to go I hate
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:31.700]  to say that but you know it's it really has been flooding in one of the things
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:37.180]  that I have spotted is a real trend with the absentee votes you know I've been
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:41.620]  saying for a long time now these absentee votes watch out for them because
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:45.700]  you can't control the chain of custody and this is specifically what I've been
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:51.460]  seeing the count gets interrupted right in the middle for example in King County
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:57.260]  Washington which has 1.2 million voters 75% of the votes are counted and then
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:02.100]  all of a sudden they interrupt the count and they claim all of the optical
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:07.580]  scan machines have stopped functioning at once and then when they resume the
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:12.220]  count you know you often see a trend reversal well I saw this in state after
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:16.660]  state after state in location after location where they were having
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:22.340]  mysteriously all of the absentee counting voting machines there can absentee
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:26.820]  they're counted on voting machines but all the machines would go on the fritz at
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:33.380]  once do you believe that I don't and then it would put a halt in the count so I
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:38.420]  want people to understand what can happen when they stop the absentee counting
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:43.820]  midstream each of these voting machine systems has what's called a manual
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:50.220]  override system where you click the screen in a secret location usually
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:55.740]  right-click it in a certain place and up top the screen that says manual entry
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:14:02.380]  and you can simply type different votes over what's in there that sounds like a
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:08.260]  great design for Al Capone or Don Corleone or let me think of some other
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:14.100]  big famous criminals Bonnie and Clyde maybe and this sounds really reasonable
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:20.140]  well you know I mean they claim they claim because I have videotaped election
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:25.540]  officials using this manual entry system by the way the manual override they
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:30.020]  claim that they use it for things like well in Kentucky one time I saw them
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:35.260]  use it when they said you know we lost a voting machine so here we have the
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:38.940]  results tape we're going to manually enter the results of course you can't
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:44.020]  see what they're doing so who knows what they're manually entering you know
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:50.420]  that it's very very interesting this is not a hack this is actually it's a
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:54.340]  secret menu and if it was really legitimate I don't know why they wouldn't
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:58.180]  just put it in someplace where you could see it plainly in the menu but you have
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:03.220]  to know how to get at it in the default system you right-click in a certain
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:08.260]  place and it pops up a screen and you literally type in any votes you want and
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:11.380]  you were the one years ago that discovered the code would double and they
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:15.540]  had to change it their little backdoor designed to go in change it and then
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:20.540]  cover your tracks right well guess what they and they never solved that problem
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:25.620]  it's still right in there so you know there's some things people can do and I
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:29.460]  I had a reporter call me the other day and he says well are you asking for the
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:34.980]  records in King County and you know I'm not because if I do every single step of
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:38.420]  it for everyone here's what happens everybody looks to me and says I want
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:42.900]  you to protect the election in 10,000 jurisdictions what that's not going to
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:48.900]  work what we have to do is get people to take some action yeah folks you've got
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:52.180]  to go out and challenge it I hear all the time I'm mad at you you need to make a
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:57.460]  film on this subject you need to go out and do this or do that yeah and I mean
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:02.860]  I'm working 18 hours a day some days give me a break folks so here's what I did I
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:06.540]  told this reporter I'll play you what I will send you a template of exactly what
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:11.300]  to ask for and I will help you analyze it but I'm not going to do every step of
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.900]  it because the reporters and the public need to learn how to exercise their
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:20.980]  muscles if they don't then the whole idea of a democratic republic is a sham and
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:25.700]  we know that's not the case it's just that we've been so taught to accept
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:30.260]  things and that we're safe and we're protected and you know that's the kind
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:35.900]  of logic that was used long ago to and to keep people in slavery to keep women
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:39.340]  subjugated was just to say don't worry your head about it we'll all take care
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:43.780]  of it now you know we need to flex these muscles and so I am glad to help
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:49.500]  people know what records to get but I'm telling you this absentee voting
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:56.300]  understand that 25 states this time had no fault absentee sometimes automatic
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.060]  absentee where they were sending ballots out to people who had not voted in
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:05.060]  years and who did not request a ballot wide open for fraud and then when these
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:09.100]  things come in they're counting them and they know they take days and days
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:12.940]  sometimes weeks to count them so they know exactly what they need to flip
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:17.500]  that let's talk about property stop the count and manual enter it sure let me
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:22.140]  let's talk briefly about prop 37 you know a lot of polls showed two to one
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:25.660]  wanting to label I don't believe that Californians for a minute as we said
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:31.460]  last week voted to not label things obvious fraud going on we've seen
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:34.900]  election officials all over the country getting caught the last year going to
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:40.140]  jail for fraud I mean how do we investigate that you know and I've
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:46.060]  been thinking about this too because 99% of the time even if the citizens catch
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:51.700]  them red-handed the attorney general or the local attorney will refuse to
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:55.540]  investigate or refuse to prosecute and I've been thinking about that too we
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:59.980]  still need to catch them we still need to get the records and then we need to do
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:04.860]  things like convene citizen grand juries and so forth because again we don't want
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:08.860]  to just be saying oh yes you know to the authority figure you're you're in power
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:12.300]  you're protecting us if they're not protecting us then we need to actually
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:18.660]  use the remedies that are available to us in the Constitution to protect ourselves
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:26.460]  well said what do you make of the numbers we're getting out of Ohio and
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:33.900]  other areas where 99% of votes in dozens and dozens of precincts were for
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:38.940]  Barack Obama well it depends on the demographics of the precincts now I have
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:46.900]  seen for example in Memphis they have certain precincts where 99% of the
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:51.420]  people who live there are black and if they have a black Democrat running
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:56.820]  against a white Republican from the suburbs you will actually see 90% 99%
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:01.740]  of the votes go for the black Democratic candidate but that's pretty rare and
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:07.500]  actually even in an almost all African-American precinct typically it's
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:16.180]  about 96% 92% if it's a very clear demographic trend so it could happen but
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:20.940]  you'd really have to compare what those numbers are which actually are available
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:26.060]  now I'm not sure in Ohio I don't think they label it by race in most of the
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:30.620]  southern states they actually do identify the voters whether what race they
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:35.860]  are man I'm really getting sick all this race stuff I don't know you've seen the
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:40.540]  cover of Newsweek saying if you're white your history then of course that's meant
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:44.380]  to create racial division by the controlled left it's all divide and
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.860]  conquer but it's really getting unbelievable one final segment with
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:52.060]  Bev Harris and more Obama supporters Eric and Marcus and others that are
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.660]  patiently holding coming up and then I'll get into Petraeus situation give you
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:02.460]  my take on it 800 at 25 at 9 9 2 3 1 for Obama supporters we just had a
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:06.860]  terrible storm in the east but we are all still in the eye of the perfect storm
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:10.780]  we have the most devastating economic conditions since the great depression
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:14.260]  America's worst drought in agricultural history and what about the
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:18.940]  presidential election this perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:23.260]  supply a foods direct is preparing for the shortages and you had better do the
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:27.740]  same I can warn you but I can't feed you you know that e-foods is the best
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:31.500]  tasting and safest food on the planet we all need a bunch of storeable and
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:35.500]  usable food from e-foods direct none of us wants to be standing in a bread line
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:39.820]  trading our freedom for food anyone who doesn't take control of their uncertain
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:46.620]  future has to be just a little bit nuts call 800 409 5633 or e-foods direct
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:53.820]  comm slash Alex how will you bet your life call 800 409 5633 or e-foods
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:58.820]  direct comm slash Alex would you rather prepare six months too early or one day
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:04.420]  too late imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:08.100]  dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill that's closer than
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.540]  you think you probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:15.020]  media has been suppressing what has fast become in the most shocking news story
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:20.980]  of 2012 Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:26.420]  bill as much as 400% in coming months as shocking as it sounds it may well be
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:30.620]  just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America but
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:34.540]  here's some good news there's an underground video at exposed one two
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:38.300]  three dot com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:42.860]  slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly the video at exposed one two
[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:46.980]  three dot com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is doing
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:51.100]  everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark so watch
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:56.580]  it now at exposed one two three dot com before it's too late again that's exposed one

[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:40.700]  more it's all up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and a huge
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:46.940]  cornucopia roster of fraud and people going to jail and admitted scams there
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:51.220]  in the news section at blackboxvoting.org bev other points in the short
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:55.300]  five six-minute segment that people should know you mentioned last I guess
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:59.140]  Thursday on the show with us that it was amazing to see all these states being
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:04.020]  called before the day's votes even been partially counted just a new level
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:08.820]  where I guess in response to people exposing fraud the system saying well
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:14.220]  you think that's bad you ain't seen nothing yet yeah that's actually I think
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:21.420]  the story of this election is the premature it's like the certain that the
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:26.500]  elite media believes I think that if they make it a definitive win and they
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:30.860]  call it really really early even before the votes are counted then it will
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:34.940]  prevent people from being motivated to look at what happened and you know I'm
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:38.580]  really encouraged though because I'm still getting called after all you know
[01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:43.020]  like every hour I'm getting a call to do another radio show and to go over this
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:47.620]  and it's not it's not just from one side or the other I think the public is
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:52.060]  starting to really sense that this is there's something that stinks about this
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:58.580]  I mean why won't they count our votes and and tell us the real numbers and wait
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:03.180]  till all the votes are counted or at least most of them you know why this
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:09.820]  sudden rush to make us believe a result so that we won't question it yeah that's
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:14.940]  it it's just hey we'll just announce it you know in the morning and then Romney
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:20.620]  goes along with it so it cements the idea and Ron Paul God bless his soul you
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:24.980]  know he'll look like a sore loser when he got cheated clearly in Iowa and Maine
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:28.940]  even the news later had to admit well he really won but the Republicans won't
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:33.740]  count the precincts where he won they just do whatever they want right and you
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:38.340]  know one thing I saw also this time is you started to see this drum beat very
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:41.940]  early on before the pull any of the polls had closed so they knew they couldn't
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:45.580]  call anything yet and here they're all all the networks are saying and it's
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:50.540]  very important for stability for the candidate to concede you know and they
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:54.780]  were pushing this idea that this is patriotic and this is what needs to be
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:27:01.460]  done is the candidate needs to concede promptly you know so it's just really
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:06.540]  creepy it's like okay everybody you need to concede probably okay here's the win
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:13.100]  okay everybody shut up and go home and that's what they do in countries like
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:18.620]  Soviet Russia back in the 70s and 80s it was the same type of same type of thing
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:23.420]  and and now beforehand they said even though the polls showed neck and neck
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:27.940]  oh no Obama is gonna win by a landslide that's self-fulfilling prophecy and to
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:32.100]  be clear Bev I'm not here you know saying this because I was a Romney
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:36.260]  supporter you're not here saying that that's where the facts lead you but I'm
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:41.140]  getting contacts from Democrats who are just really feeling good right now like
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:45.860]  their football team one or their boxer one and they're like aha you're just
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:50.900]  mad your guy lost and they don't understand that I really hated Al Gore I
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.420]  didn't know what we were getting what George Bush he got he was pretty bad too
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:58.260]  but I mean there was still evidence of fraud against Gore there I just reported
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:02.260]  where the facts let us you were on at the time now it just it doesn't matter
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:08.020]  whatever side thinks they won they don't care too much of that although you know
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:14.900]  what's really interesting is you we are seeing it continue and I you know we are
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.860]  seeing people keep caring it's so interesting like you know Brad Friedman
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:22.780]  is pretty much on the last you know and I'm sure you know I don't know if he's
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:26.900]  an Obama supporter but he's definitely on that side but you know on the back like
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:31.340]  he kept it going and kept investigating and kept investigating and I think that's
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:36.780]  what we need to see we will see because the public understands when someone you
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:40.220]  know pulling the wool over their eyes and yeah no he's a huge Obama supporter
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:44.860]  at least in the past we've had him on and I mean it's just so sad you can debate
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:49.340]  the rhetoric all day of these two clowns but they weren't for the same people let
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:53.180]  me come on but you know but the thing was I guess my point is he continued to
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:57.740]  cover it even after Obama won in 2008 and we are seeing more and more of this
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:01.700]  square and I think that's what it's really going to take is for people to
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:07.140]  satisfy their political rhetoric on this issue and realize that all political
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:12.460]  power stems from the ballot box and if we you know if you want political power
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:17.820]  for your side you got to have an honest ballot box that you can authenticate
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:23.580]  well said Bev Harris when's a good time to talk to you maybe in a week or two
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:29.580]  after it's all kind of a shook out yeah I mean I was shocked at the volume that
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:35.580]  I have I at this point I have probably 10,000 more reports to go through now a
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:38.460]  lot of those are duplicates and a lot of them are you know just somebody
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:43.180]  repeating something but there's a lot of good stuff in there and so it does just
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:47.420]  take time to sit through these and a little revisit this soon thank you so

[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:15.340]  infowars.com okay look listen if you just tuned in again according to these
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:24.020]  callers I'm reporting on dozens and dozens and dozens of precinct some of
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:28.820]  them a hundred percent actually but but quite a few at nine nine percent for
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:33.180]  Obama in Ohio and a bunch of states that announced for Obama before any of the
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:37.860]  days votes have been counted only absentee same thing on prop 37 you see
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:42.420]  the reason I'm saying prop 37 is a fraud is because I'm racist I want you to
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:46.620]  know there's GMO in your food because I'm racist just like I don't want black
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:51.060]  folks to abort 52% of their children or anybody else too for that matter even
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:53.980]  though it's about 12% of whites abort their kids and the numbers we've got
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:57.500]  because I don't like black people you see if I was a liberal I want you to
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:00.500]  kill your baby so there's less black people so I'm gonna admit it right now
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:05.900]  I am a racist because I don't want black people chopping their kids up and also
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:09.740]  I'm anti-Hispanic because I don't I tell Hispanics you know the Planned
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:13.220]  Parenthood's targeting them to butcher their kids and they don't care because
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:16.340]  I mean a lot of liberal ones because they say hey Obama's on the cover of
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:21.140]  Newsweek saying you're white your history so I don't know maybe if I said white
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:24.420]  people are scum and filth don't abort your kids maybe you wouldn't abort them
[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:28.900]  you know I don't like the eugenics agenda I happen to be informed and that
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:33.580]  makes me crazy well possibly maybe we should go out with Narls Barkley
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:37.500]  crazy later I'm gonna play taps for Veterans Day and talk about what
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.780]  Veterans Day really means to me at the start of the next hour but right now
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:46.220]  without further ado we need to get that drum roll you know the classic drum
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:52.900]  roll because with these Obama supporters there's just so incredible it's good to
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:57.460]  hear from them Eric in New York thank you for holding you were on the air then
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:04.900]  Marcos and others Eric welcome sir as a obonnoid I'm sorry as a obonnism
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:10.660]  I guess that combines both of them obonnism how do you said obonnism see
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:19.460]  I'm can obonny obonnism obonnism no that's not right obonnism sometimes I
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:26.780]  have trouble with a word it's obonnism obonnism obonnism obonnism obonnism
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:30.780]  I've got to say sometimes when I mess up a word I would say it 50 times
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:36.660]  obonnism so I'm brainwashing myself right now obonnism obonnism is that
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:42.900]  correct yes that's correct obonnism let's say it all together now Obama Obama
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:51.460]  Obama Obama he gave us phone he'd do more we have the drum roll we're gonna
[01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:56.940]  go to Eric right here in a second drum roll please that is dramatic how we play
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:05.500]  that okay Eric you're on the air welcome sir no one has ever been given such a
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:13.620]  royal welcome I'm on here now yes sir all right well listen Obama is not my
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:18.620]  god I voted for Obama because he was the only like good choice out there what are
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:23.580]  you gonna do both for Romney or writing writing Ron Paul I mean Ron Paul is it
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:27.740]  gonna win Gary Johnson was it gonna win what he even got like one percent of
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:31.940]  the vote well I couldn't bring myself to vote for either one of them I'm gonna
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:34.900]  be honest here because I'm not gonna sign on to fraud do you get it was all
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:38.620]  scripted with both guys bought and paid for and that and there's so much fraud
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:42.340]  who knows who really got elected it looks like it was might have been Romney
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:46.420]  I'm just I don't like Al Gore but look like there was more fraud on that side
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:51.260]  by the Republicans in 2012 years later I'm looking at all over the country you
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:54.540]  heard Bev Harris used to be a Democrat now she's you know independent because
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:57.940]  they're so corrupt I mean I mean even the Brad blog who's a big liberal he
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:03.580]  admits fraud I mean but look don't worry I mean Romney isn't challenging it
[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:06.660]  because it's all rigged I mean do you get what I'm saying the whole things
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:19.660]  rigged I remember seeing you back in on there we go listen but let me talk now
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:25.860]  I remember when I looked you up back in 06 and I saw one of your videos on Y2K and
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:30.580]  I was like this brother's out here talking about Y2K and he wonders why he
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:36.900]  gets a label put on him well sir I'm gonna put you on a bunch of things you
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:41.200]  haven't played the racism deal yet but you're one of the only callers not to
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.820]  today's an Obama supporter and then you talk about 12 hours a radio I did I had
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:49.940]  said Y2K wasn't gonna be a big deal then on the day of the event they had
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:54.060]  reactors going down they were announcing all sorts of problems ABC News said a
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:57.820]  missile been fired from Russia and people edited that together to make it
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:01.220]  sound like part of it was when I was joking around as well because I was on
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:04.300]  Michael Trudeau one of the talk show I was going oh the missile is gonna get
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:09.580]  us like hours later to do that but regardless of that I say you should be
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:14.580]  a prepper boy they sure wish they were on the East Coast now in Camp Sandy you
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:19.220]  know you're sitting here going oh yeah look we had Obama supporters calling
[01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:24.220]  Friday and Thursday and say Obama doesn't want to take our guns when it's on
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:28.180]  record they're reintroducing the assault weapons ban so you use these catch all
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:34.300]  terms about how I'm a conspiracy theorist when the government's on record
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:39.660]  doing lethal experiments on the American people so so so these are just labels
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:44.020]  that people throw out to so they won't have to debate the information now go
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:47.540]  ahead are you like the old mama supporter in the last hour who said
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:53.260]  Obama opposed the Wall Street bailout well listen he has to do what he has to
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:57.460]  do all right you're associating your personal power and identity with Obama
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:00.580]  so you'll go along with him no matter what he does just like Republicans who
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:06.580]  love Bush no no no no see oh Obama's a very good man every time I see him with
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:14.140]  his daughters and his wife let's say wow what a what a family what a family you
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:18.780]  know I don't know if that's something you do when you're with your with your
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:27.180]  children you know just have them with you and cuddle yes hello yeah yeah I'm
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:30.100]  listening to you I mean if I don't interrupt you you get mad if I interrupt
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:32.660]  you get mad
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:40.540]  listen Alex you and your conspiracy theory you're talking about that you was
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:45.220]  just playing with white to okay I mean I heard the audio okay okay see all you're
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:49.140]  doing is going back to something 12 years ago I'm here asking you what is a
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:53.220]  conspiracy theory that megabanks have taken over the US and a bragged about
[01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:57.260]  it here CNN guys put it on screen headline foreign banks ready for us

[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:16.380]  eugenics are taking over the United States and want to wreck the economy and
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:22.220]  are passing laws to shut down the economy and agenda 21 and then let me ask
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:26.700]  you this I've talked to a lot of black liberals and by the way you're an
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:30.500]  American obviously I mean what racial group would you say you belong to I
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:38.060]  belong to the racial group that belongs to the nationalist socialist party

[01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:49.900]  blackheads I want that compilation put together because that's what this is
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:54.100]  really all about and I understand there's only one thing you hate more than
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:57.700]  white people and that's other black kids you haven't chopped up yet I mean I get
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:47:02.060]  that whole culture I got him down with it let's go ahead and by the way but the
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:04.740]  fact that I'm down with it means I know just how evil it is and how much it makes
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:07.980]  me sick and then I'm a racist because I don't want to chop up black kids I get
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:15.740]  it Marcos in Mississippi you're on the air go ahead yes go ahead well I have a
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:20.900]  lot to say about this because you know it's a I wonder what side of the fence
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:24.660]  you on with the whole thing because you know about the election thing you
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:30.380]  chili did you know Romney for a while you know Romney Romney Obama's gonna lose
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:34.540]  Obama's gonna lose you know so I didn't know exactly what to say like a lot of
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:37.940]  people that's probably listening didn't know what to say about that and then to
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:42.260]  the guy that was just all it you know that's nothing I think that was a joke
[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:50.980]  really and I'll pay that no attention you know what I'm saying but I don't know
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:57.960]  nothing about that because I haven't been a part of it I don't I don't know no
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:02.700]  part today I don't believe I don't think if you lay down to have a child you you
[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:07.540]  know unless it's just something really serious well no one can be able to do
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:12.580]  nothing about it then that's the case but I don't believe you brought up a
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:17.940]  question so let me explain it I had long open discussions about what do you do
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:22.660]  when Romney says he's pro-second amendment anti-abortion and says that
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:27.420]  small business is the key and Obama says the other that if America chose that
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:32.540]  even if it was a puppet show it's like choosing the bad guy even though it's a
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:37.340]  fraud they're both bad it's the choice that America's going socialist communist
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:42.940]  collectivist pro-abortion and America did so I said morally I have to say that
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:50.180]  Romney's rhetoric is better that he is he is playing the part of the guy you know
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:54.820]  who says he's the angel not the devil okay so America chose the guy that
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:49:00.260]  openly pushed evil and so that's what I was saying and then I saw the polls the
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:03.900]  real scientific polls lined up behind Romney even the electoral college and
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:08.220]  then we've got massive evidence of fraud against to against people that voted
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:11.820]  for Romney not because Romney was good but because that's who the system wanted
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:16.020]  in was Obama because they can create more racial division with it and so that's
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:19.180]  what's going on that's what I said I was clear about it just like I'm being
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:24.340]  clear now and again I'm gonna say it the media is coming out with racist stuff
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:30.020]  like saying if you're white your history they're saying that so everyone thinks
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:34.260]  about racial identity and bringing down the white devil as the government being
[01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:37.220]  their mommy their daddy and the one that's going to take care of them because
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:40.500]  the government is the one that pays to have their babies chopped up and Obama
[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:44.180]  is the one that got the block off to get abortions going in Africa where they
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:47.780]  forced the women to have abortions and then be sterilized to get a one-time
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:51.500]  payment and again I can hear the argument of people being poor but when you
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:55.460]  start saying kill people's babies the reason they want to kill them is because
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:58.780]  the globalists inherently don't like black people and so I want to just give
[01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:02.540]  black people a little newsflash here okay the globalists in the government that
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:06.540]  said they were going to pose as liberals and take over your communities 80 years
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:10.100]  ago they've done it and how is government doing for the black community
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:14.340]  90 plus percent legitimacy highest prison population numbers ever seen in
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:18.100]  history highest level of illiteracy they have destroyed your community with a
[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:22.740]  smiley face if I put a big smiley face on and pull out a big dagger it started
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:27.020]  stabbing you in the heart would it be okay because I was wearing a smiley face
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:31.820]  well listen I don't I'm not going to consist anything that you just said
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:36.060]  though because I don't see it every day I see a lot of stuff they go off and I
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:41.380]  can't say that is not true but at the same time what what can be done you know
[01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:45.220]  what other choices it was okay well I'll tell you I don't particularly like some
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:49.900]  of the stuff that Lewis Furkan says when it comes to you know whites and this
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:58.020]  and that but I agree with him don't take money from the system well we got to go

[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:41.860]  Gerald Salentes in the nightly news tonight with some breaking news 7 o'clock
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:48.700]  central ah well I gotta get to all this news by the way I was in a store the
[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:56.020]  other day and I finally found bubble gum or sugared gum that didn't have
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:59.260]  aspartame in it you know you had a report last week that you go to grocery
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:03.220]  stores stores there'll be dozens and dozens in some cases of brands even the
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:07.180]  sugared gum has aspartame that rots your brain gives you cancer all the big
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:10.500]  scientific studies makes you obese gives you a headache at least gives me a
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:15.700]  headache but I found stallion gum look right here if you're watching on
[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:20.180]  prism pointed on TV and it's the bubblegum's back that was around when I
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:28.300]  was a kid it's the little bubblegum cigarettes so it's delayed delayed
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.780]  attack you know some of the kids getting the chemical warfare right there you get
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:36.940]  the cigarettes with all their additives here and my kids were like amazed they
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:42.380]  said wow finally gum that's finally gum that's not the net aspartame daddy we
[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:45.620]  can finally have gum they said look this doesn't have literally my son run
[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:53.100]  he goes look dad in the store doesn't have aspartame he goes he said can I have
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:56:01.980]  it look at that ingredients ingredients right there oh there's the
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:09.140]  ingredients got the ingredients and here let me just read people the the
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:17.220]  ingredients here it's corn syrup gum-based artificial flavors red dye
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:23.580]  number three blue dye to yellow five BHA as preservatives so there it is but
[01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:28.620]  it's a cigarette so it conditions them see everything is a brainwashing tool
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:33.140]  now mm-hmm there you go
[01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:39.820]  well my wife is right about sunday I never put I love the sun and I never
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:44.340]  put sunscreen on I look like a leopard or something on TV anyways I don't care
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:50.580]  the point is is that there you go ladies and gentlemen little cigarettes and
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:54.620]  of course I ended up letting them have them I said okay this always say no but
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:59.100]  I said here you go and I tore off the cigarette part and gave it to them so
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:02.060]  that they wouldn't become conditioned and want to try cigarettes for the first
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:07.300]  time I remember when I was a kid the plastic covered little cigars that had
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:14.300]  gum inside and so there you go you can find gum in a store that does not have
[01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:18.620]  aspartame in it like all these brands over here but you're gonna have to jump
[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:23.260]  through quite a few hoops to do it and it's gonna push something entirely
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:27.580]  different a little pack of cigarettes stallion getting you ready to smoke
[01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:32.340]  your marble reds now there it is isn't that just isn't that just special but
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:35.900]  that's another conspiracy theory that any of that that's not to condition you
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:40.980]  to smoke cigarettes and aspartame isn't highly addictive and toxic and it's not
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:45.100]  a conspiracy that it's in all the major sugar gum products not just sugar-free
[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:48.700]  after everybody exposed that the sugar-free when it was aspartame was
[01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:52.300]  hurting people well they just put it in thousands of products I'm now finding it
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:58.580]  in sugar cake mixes I'm now finding it in stuff that a whole foods I'm now
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:04.060]  finding it everywhere and I shouldn't be concerned I should just shut up and I
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:09.940]  should just go along with all of it and so to the guys calling me conspiracy
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:15.740]  theorist I apologize you're right the government cares about us yeah all
[01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:19.380]  those admitted tests killing us and secret tests and stuff that was just
[01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:22.740]  as they care about us and now the government really likes us and it wants
[01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:26.500]  us to live in in compact cities on a subsistence level well now they're
[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.580]  announcing if you're gonna get welfare in the future you're gonna be

[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:52.460]  contraception compulsory abortion of out of wedlock pregnancies they're now
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:56.620]  starting those in some US states poor people and they're saying you're not up
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:00:59.460]  to having a kid we're gonna force the board that was in the news last week
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:03.260]  it wasn't even news it was like okay housing policies discouraged run a
[02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:07.060]  private home ownership that's what the property tax is about stop awarding
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:10.900]  public housing based on family size encourage increased homosexuality
[02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:15.900]  fertility control agents in water supply that's department of that's the
[02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:19.740]  government working with Planned Parenthood this is official to this is
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:23.020]  this has been in Congress we're gonna take I'll put a document camera out over
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:27.660]  here guys while we take calls we can do that or wherever you like just aim the
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:30.940]  document cam and I can move it wherever the cameras aim that's a new system to
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:34.780]  be having to chase me around just boom your document cam you punch it up and
[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:38.100]  then I will just bowl that's right on target now zoom in on some of that while
[02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:41.980]  I talk to the caller okay Marcus go ahead and make your points I'll stop
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:48.460]  interrupting anything else you'd like to add well I can't argue with you about
[02:01:48.460 --> 02:01:53.180]  how it's been a massive influx of the building of prisons everywhere around
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:58.620]  the country there's a non-state run mainly private prisons owned by these
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:03.660]  private business and corporations and it's a lot it's kind of sad that you
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:07.940]  know a lot of people don't take the time to read and find out that it's in plain
[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:12.460]  sight that the Federal Reserve does not belong to this country is it belongs to a
[02:02:12.460 --> 02:02:17.180]  private group of people that want to loan money to the catcher that doesn't
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:22.260]  even make sense and exactly and they run Obama he's who they wanted not to admit
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:26.460]  Romney's good it's that that's who they wanted to create division and so that's
[02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:30.140]  why I'm against Obama see if the globalist you want my guns I'm against
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:32.660]  that if they want open borders I'm against that they want me to take their
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:36.540]  shots I don't trust them I'm against that anything therefore I'm against it
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:40.100]  it's it's really easy and then I can intellectually historically go through
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:44.500]  each point and explain why I don't take shots from a known group caught poisoning
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:48.020]  food and water and giving people syphilis and injecting kids with polio
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:52.460]  you know oh known murderers I'm gonna take shots they give me no I don't think
[02:02:52.460 --> 02:03:00.260]  so yes I can I can agree with that you know but at the same time you know you
[02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:06.820]  ask for people that have supported Obama and it will be you know I guess to the
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:11.980]  stand in Mississippi and just learning the history of Mississippi slayering not
[02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:16.060]  ending in no I get it the other side so bad why not vote for Obama because at
[02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:20.540]  least I've got something in common with him I get it well I guess you could say
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:25.620]  that you know a lot of people related to it on that level and that's what I
[02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:29.500]  wanted to tell you you need to figure out a way the way you can talk to those
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:34.260]  people because a lot of these older people maybe they can't be help but it's
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:38.220]  a lot of kids that listen to these people and this is all that they see and
[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:44.340]  they know and it's got to be a growth of knowledge and it doesn't mean go vote
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:49.260]  for Romney we've all got to get together and reject it all I mean you know the
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:52.580]  issue is I'm starting to be able to get conservatives to understand we've been
[02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:59.820]  taken over the left is so dumbed down and so buying into evil it's it's the
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:03.500]  it's the quote progressive and that means moving this agenda forward group
[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:07.300]  they've they've labeled everything they do is good and I'm saying get ready
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:12.220]  because when I've had callers last week say I'm racist because I don't want to
[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:17.380]  turn my guns in I mean it really comes down to that they're going to label the
[02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:22.020]  whole neural order agenda as racist if you're against it and and that's where
[02:04:22.020 --> 02:04:26.780]  I'm going with this Marcus meanwhile the globalist art government is targeting
[02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:31.620]  the groups that think the government's their friend the the devil doesn't come
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:35.900]  up to you telling you he's gonna eat you for dinner he wants to he wants to get
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:40.340]  you to lay down and let him put some chains on you and make sure you you know
[02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:43.780]  puts a rubber ball in your mouth and then he goes by the way you want to see
[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:47.540]  something really scary and he rips that mask off and nobody's gonna hear you
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:51.860]  scream okay nobody's gonna hear the little kids they got in their dungeons
[02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:55.340]  right now and believe me they're in the dungeons right now getting their teeth
[02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:58.340]  torn out with pliers
[02:04:58.340 --> 02:05:06.540]  strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future

[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:09.460]  rubs over encroachment of freedom of speech remember the BBC reporter of
[02:13:09.460 --> 02:13:16.260]  host of one man and his dog said rural communities deserve the same rights as
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:20.620]  homosexuals and Muslims and they said well the word homosexuals hateful just
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:25.180]  any word they say is hateful and so this guy did a thing burning the poppy
[02:13:25.180 --> 02:13:29.740]  saying he doesn't like war and has become a symbol of pro-war and they came
[02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:34.220]  and they arrested him and they're trying to pass similar cyber security laws here
[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:38.420]  and cyber bullying it says where if someone finds what you did hurtful
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:44.980]  you're arrested and see they'll start with something like don't let pedophiles
[02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:47.820]  have their free speech when they're the globalists are actually mainly pedophiles
[02:13:47.820 --> 02:13:51.580]  as we've documented or oh don't talk about about the veterans and people
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:55.580]  find that distasteful but then take everybody's free speech or oh don't have
[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:59.580]  a law where you can't burn the American flag when you actually pass that law you
[02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:04.420]  burn with the flag symbolizes a man living in Kent in the south of England
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:08.980]  has been arrested by police for posting a picture of a burning poppy sparking an
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:12.340]  intense backlash for many concerned about the erosion of free speech police and
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:16.060]  Kent have not made it clear whether the man actually took the picture himself or
[02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:19.900]  it was a picture from somewhere else online the image shows a paper poppy the
[02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:24.500]  kind that are sold the Royal British Legion to commemorate Remembrance Day

[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:37.540]  telecommunications so there you go when the police were contacted by the good
[02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:41.740]  tattletales that's a Steve Watson article up on both our big sites prison
[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:46.420]  planet comm info worst calm but enough of that
[02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:52.820]  continuing here I want to talk about Veterans Day but first I want to play
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:59.060]  taps here to remember the veterans going back to George Washington and the
[02:14:59.060 --> 02:15:02.020]  continental arming that fought the greatest military the world had ever
[02:15:02.020 --> 02:15:07.940]  seen that it defeated the French the Spanish the Dutch the Austrians the
[02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:12.220]  Portuguese and many others in a six-and-a-half year war I want to
[02:15:12.220 --> 02:15:16.180]  remember our veterans right through to today because statistically and I've
[02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:20.260]  talked to them the most patriotic awake people are military compared to the
[02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:24.660]  dumb-down public the military is heads above the rest and as bad as the police
[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:28.420]  are I talked to a lot of police and see their numbers out there they're there
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:31.700]  they're really waking up so I want to remember those that at least you know on
[02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:35.540]  the surface put themselves out to defend our Republic and that's why the
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:38.820]  government says the number one terror threat is the veterans because they know
[02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:43.060]  those are people that actually signed on to defend America and so when they find
[02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:46.340]  out America's under attack by the global foreign banks that have hijacked us
[02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:51.540]  they'll stand up and defend this Republic so on Veterans Day I salute all of our
[02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:55.020]  veterans even if they were manipulated into being part of corrupt globalist
[02:15:55.020 --> 02:15:59.700]  wars they still did it from their hearts like King David did a lot of bad
[02:15:59.700 --> 02:16:03.020]  things but God said he's a man from our heart because he repented of it when he
[02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:06.440]  found out and that's why the globalists say you're the number one enemy and the
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:09.900]  Homeland Security and FEMA reports that are public just type in Homeland
[02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:13.940]  Security says veterans number one terror threat you'll get that they hate you the
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:18.940]  veterans so we love you and we appreciate you and we hope that we can
[02:16:18.940 --> 02:16:22.140]  educate you so you won't be part of this this evil takeover they're trying to
[02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:26.300]  destroy the military right now and turn it into a group of socialist ninnies who
[02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:29.140]  will carry out the destruction of America but we think that that's going to be
[02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:33.340]  turned around against the New World Order let's go ahead and go to taps here
[02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:52.340]  dash
[02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:08.340]  D.
[02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:13.340]  A.
[02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:18.340]  A.
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:23.340]  B.
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:28.340]  A.
[02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:44.340]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen, and he salutes those there at Arlington Cemetery
[02:17:44.340 --> 02:17:46.340]  if you're watching on Prison Planet TV.
[02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:52.660]  Again, the globalist in a nutshell use the veterans and their valor and their sacrifice
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:56.300]  as a package to their tyranny and their evil.
[02:17:56.300 --> 02:18:01.260]  They wrap all of their opium growing in Afghanistan, their murder of Pat Tillman, in their fake
[02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:04.340]  patriotism, and it turned out they just executed him.
[02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:06.540]  He said he was fighting al-Qaeda, the globalist run.
[02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:11.300]  And if you just type in Homeland Security says veterans are biggest terror threat, you
[02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:16.380]  will get the official Homeland Security report, and you will also, if you type in Tea Party
[02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:21.820]  listed as terrorist, you get the Washington Times pointing out the army is training to
[02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:23.060]  take on the Tea Party.
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:26.860]  So you need to understand, ladies and gentlemen, just like they show Obama as a conquering
[02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:34.460]  Napoleon, and it says if you're white, you're history, this is a real Newsweek cover.
[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:38.660]  The globalists want to open the borders, upbringing as many foreigners as they can, not to make
[02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:42.260]  them hardworking Americans, but to turn them into the new army.
[02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:45.940]  It's the government, which is foreign banks, with its foreign political enemies who they
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:50.980]  get preferential jobs and treatment, doesn't matter what color you are as long as you're
[02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:54.060]  not from America and are coming from a poor country.
[02:18:54.060 --> 02:18:58.540]  So they can put you on the government handout, while they demonize the vets, the libertarians,
[02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:03.140]  the conservatives, libertarians and conservatives who are pretty much the majority of this country
[02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:07.820]  can never get back into the government because they always have a neo-con placeholder, and
[02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:10.140]  that's how they walk us into the dark night.
[02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:15.900]  Then when the Democrats engage in elections fraud and other things and put Obama in over
[02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:19.940]  the other puppet, they say, oh, it's because you're not socialist enough and you're not
[02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:22.420]  for open borders and abortion and all this.
[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:24.140]  If you do that, Republicans, you'll get elected.
[02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:29.460]  Yeah, if we open the borders up and in our guns and support abortion, basically become
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:32.140]  the Democratic Party, then you'll win.
[02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:37.940]  See, that's the fraud, no, the Republicans lost because of fraud, because of dependency,
[02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:42.260]  but also because 12 to 20 million, depending on what numbers you look at, Ron Paul supporters
[02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:44.980]  just didn't vote for Mitt Romney.
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:48.700]  And the idea is just let this get as bad as it can get now.
[02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:51.940]  Let's just go all the way now.
[02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:55.020]  And things are going to collapse, and that's the plan, and then more of you will go on
[02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:57.580]  welfare and learn to worship big fat government.
[02:19:57.580 --> 02:20:02.020]  I will get into Petraeus straight ahead, then your phone calls, then more.
[02:20:02.020 --> 02:20:06.980]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future on how
[02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:08.340]  do I safeguard?
[02:20:08.340 --> 02:20:10.780]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Scowze.
[02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:14.940]  The U.S. isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist
[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:15.940]  threat.
[02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:19.820]  A massive nuclear attack is coming, they want that attack to come.
[02:20:19.820 --> 02:20:24.700]  Joel Scowze and his renown is one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation
[02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:26.500]  and the securing of your home.
[02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:31.340]  What I tell people is that you do have time, we talk about natural disasters, the health
[02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:34.060]  environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:37.900]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even
[02:20:37.900 --> 02:20:41.900]  be ready and won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:44.660]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[02:20:44.660 --> 02:20:50.860]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness strategic relocation film with Joel Scowze
[02:20:50.860 --> 02:21:01.540]  and Alex Jones available only at infowarshop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:21:01.540 --> 02:21:06.220]  I don't mean to be nosy, but do you have the 37 food items you can't get in the coming
[02:21:06.220 --> 02:21:09.340]  disaster and may not survive without?
[02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:14.500]  As you already know, something big is about to hit the U.S. and you have got to be prepared.
[02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:18.900]  Did you know that your local grocery store only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand?
[02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:23.820]  So if there's any interruption in our fragile food supply chain or even a hint of a crisis,
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:28.100]  then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the mob and menace
[02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:30.700]  and you and your family could be in serious trouble.
[02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:37.580]  That's why my friend just created a free video at 37items.com that reveals the 37 critical
[02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:41.140]  items you should hoard now before it's too late.
[02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:47.860]  Go watch the important video at 37items.com to discover the 37 things you can't buy after
[02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:50.820]  a disaster and may not survive without.
[02:21:50.820 --> 02:21:57.020]  I'm not sure how long the video will be online, so go to 37items.com before it's gone forever.
[02:21:57.020 --> 02:22:00.820]  Again, that's 37items.com.
[02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:04.620]  Being an armed citizen means having a gun with you all the time.

[02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:15.220]  We're going to have a flotella of Obama's supporters real quick in the next segment
[02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:24.340]  of the show.
[02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:29.740]  I'm going to get Dr. Pachanik on tomorrow and he does know Petraeus and he did run Psiops
[02:24:29.740 --> 02:24:32.300]  for the State Department.
[02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:42.300]  The issue is he's saying this is all a neocon false flag.
[02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:46.060]  I got to be honest, I don't totally agree with that just because why did Obama order
[02:24:46.060 --> 02:24:47.060]  the stand down?
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:52.060]  I mean, now it's come out that they had a CIA black site, of course they did.
[02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:54.140]  That's where they took people in Libya to torture them.
[02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:58.780]  They launched the whole Al Qaeda revolution against Gaddafi out of Benghazi almost two
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:04.780]  years ago is when it first started the rumblings and there was a black site down the street.
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:09.020]  The group that went and killed him, it turned out, was hired to run security in Benghazi.
[02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:10.020]  It was Al Qaeda.
[02:25:10.020 --> 02:25:11.740]  The Al Qaeda, they run.
[02:25:11.740 --> 02:25:16.580]  And how the neocons can spend this and like, look, he's not tough on Al Qaeda, Obama was
[02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:18.140]  involved in a stand down.
[02:25:18.140 --> 02:25:22.700]  So if Pachanik's right, it means neocons in his administration are running things and
[02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:23.700]  Hillary did it.
[02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:29.300]  Well, Hillary's the one who's going to have to fall on her political sword here.
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:32.540]  And you've got the neocons now and others trying to call them as witnesses.
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:37.780]  I just do not buy and I have Pachanik on to say it, but it doesn't mean I just agreed
[02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:41.980]  with him a month ago when he said this was all, when it first happened, staged by them.
[02:25:41.980 --> 02:25:45.940]  I mean, I could see that happening using an Al Qaeda element that wasn't under globalist
[02:25:45.940 --> 02:25:51.420]  control or under different factions control, but this is all about arms going to Syria.
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:53.340]  That's now come out.
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:57.220]  We've had Colonel Shaefer and others on.
[02:25:57.220 --> 02:25:58.740]  It's all come out.
[02:25:58.740 --> 02:25:59.740]  And now it's coming out.
[02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:04.540]  They had a big CIA torture command base down the street.
[02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:08.820]  And it looks like another unit, a part of that two guys ran down to try to help them.
[02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:12.660]  They held it off now for seven hours.
[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:19.860]  And now we're hearing this, this little honeypot, this little operative, that woman on TV with
[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:24.700]  like people bragging, I've got a high security clearance and then some kind of love all these
[02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:29.580]  modern day spies, like everybody's supposed to fall down and worship them because they're
[02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:32.380]  a spy when there's millions of these spies.
[02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:36.900]  That means traitor today, more than ever, bragging about, I hang out with the general.
[02:26:36.900 --> 02:26:39.660]  I mean, it was obvious she was in bed with him.
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:42.660]  You can see when a woman's proud of some guy, she's betting.
[02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:46.660]  And then now we hear it's threats she was making to other women, horning in.
[02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:52.420]  It's a whorehouse, ladies and gentlemen, the women in high level in the military are camp
[02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:53.420]  women.
[02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:57.620]  Going back to generals, hookers, hookers, that's where the word hooker comes from, a general
[02:26:57.620 --> 02:27:01.540]  hooker that kept a big group of them behind him in the Civil War, northern general.
[02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:04.860]  I'm not saying this woman's a hooker, I'm just saying that's where the word hookers
[02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:07.420]  comes from as general hooker.
[02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:12.860]  Historically, Lindsey Graham, we need a Watergate-type committee to investigate Benghazi, Petraeus
[02:27:12.860 --> 02:27:13.860]  must testify.
[02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:20.740]  I agree with Joel Scalzen and Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaffer's analysis and others, and
[02:27:20.740 --> 02:27:24.340]  that's what the evidence points towards, make a long story short, that they wanted this
[02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:25.340]  guy dead.
[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:30.100]  Now, that might have been groups within the government that advised Obama wrong, so he
[02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:31.300]  ordered to stand down.
[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:35.460]  The point is, he's like Nixon, he's caught if they want to destroy him now, because,
[02:27:35.460 --> 02:27:40.580]  again, put him up for the second term, now really put the clamps on so he does exactly
[02:27:40.580 --> 02:27:41.580]  what they say.
[02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:45.140]  This is part of the globalist balancing power.
[02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:49.740]  They always do this, and I don't agree with what they're doing, it's just how the criminals
[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:54.620]  counterbalance the criminals, so we'll see if Pachennik can convince me tomorrow or the
[02:27:54.620 --> 02:27:58.500]  next day, under the weather, but we'll see him, he said he'd come on tomorrow, we'll
[02:27:58.500 --> 02:27:59.500]  see if that happens.
[02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:04.860]  And then I'm going to get Tarp Leon again, that's always fun, get his take on all this.
[02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:06.380]  I'm really trying to find the truth here.
[02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:10.380]  I want to get Colonel Schaffer back on, this is moving quick, here on the radio shows on
[02:28:10.380 --> 02:28:13.540]  the Nightly News, what last Thursday.
[02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:15.100]  Pretty powerful interview up there.
[02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:18.220]  He told me off here, and he said, no, you can say it on air, but he elaborated that,
[02:28:18.220 --> 02:28:19.940]  yeah, no, this is pointing towards a hit.
[02:28:19.940 --> 02:28:21.380]  In fact, it is a hit.
[02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:24.860]  The question is, did Obama order it or somebody else?
[02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:28.420]  Pretty powerful info on that front.
[02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:32.620]  But now they're saying we need a Watergate-type investigation on Benghazi, Petraeus, must-hastify.
[02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:37.780]  Yeah, it's so obvious that, I mean, folks, you go to the Watergate Hotel, it's come out
[02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:41.500]  in the news with Porter Goss, the CIA director a while back, and all these guys.
[02:28:41.500 --> 02:28:48.660]  It is a madhouse to look like two nerds, get their photos up there, the two little love
[02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:51.820]  birds, as if that's not obvious what's going on there.
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:58.180]  Anyways, and these women climbing socially with the sex and all of it, again, I'm not
[02:28:58.180 --> 02:28:59.180]  knocking people.
[02:28:59.180 --> 02:29:02.900]  I mean, at least Petraeus, it appears, isn't part of the rest of the guild up there that
[02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:07.940]  it's not just they only like men, they like underage ones, which is absolutely abominable.
[02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:09.940]  So I guess his only crime is he likes women.
[02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:11.820]  I've made that joke more than once.
[02:29:11.820 --> 02:29:20.300]  But the point here is it's a sick joke that they don't let you get to that position unless
[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:21.300]  you're compromised.
[02:29:21.300 --> 02:29:25.740]  Well, we've had three generals the last month step down because of sex stuff, kind of like
[02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:29.660]  their heart plug that Baron Harkinen has to pull and you bleed to death or a little exploding
[02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:34.060]  political bombs and their herodotteries.
[02:29:34.060 --> 02:29:36.580]  That's what's going on here is they're always attached.
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:40.660]  I mean, you don't get anywhere unless you've got four or five mistresses.
[02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:45.260]  And usually that's not enough, you know, you've got a lot of more horrible things than that.
[02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:48.380]  So I'll finish up what I think is going on here.
[02:29:48.380 --> 02:29:50.460]  Then we'll be right back and get to your calls and watch.
[02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:51.820]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:54.260]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.260 --> 02:30:02.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.180 --> 02:30:06.700]  We just had a terrible storm in the east, but we are all still in the eye of the perfect
[02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:07.700]  storm.
[02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:11.460]  We have the most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression.
[02:30:11.460 --> 02:30:16.060]  America's worst drought in agricultural history and what about the presidential election?
[02:30:16.060 --> 02:30:19.900]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:30:19.900 --> 02:30:24.100]  E-Foods Direct is preparing for the shortages and you had better do the same.
[02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:26.600]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:30:26.600 --> 02:30:30.260]  You know that E-Foods is the best tasting and safest food on the planet.
[02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:33.820]  We all need a bunch of storable and usable food from E-Foods Direct.
[02:30:33.820 --> 02:30:38.180]  None of us wants to be standing in a bread line trading our freedom for food.
[02:30:38.180 --> 02:30:42.420]  Anyone who doesn't take control of their uncertain future has to be just a little bit nuts.

[02:32:42.100 --> 02:32:44.900]  Pro Pure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:32:44.900 --> 02:32:46.460]  It's what my family uses.
[02:32:46.460 --> 02:32:51.180]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Pro Pure, but if you add the promo code

[02:33:00.100 --> 02:33:13.780]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest. A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[02:33:13.780 --> 02:33:20.340]  I'm a guy who's a boss on this highway. So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:26.660]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me. I know I'm working for the state. I'm a highway patrol.
[02:33:26.660 --> 02:33:37.620]  Okay, we've got some breaking TSA news with Paul Watson here, but I promise to go to some more
[02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:43.220]  of the Obama supporters to get their take on, well, some say I'm evil and racist because I don't
[02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:47.460]  like government-run healthcare and don't want to hurt my guns and others are more reasonable
[02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:53.220]  and say, well, Romney's really bad. Wanted to launch wars. We think he's better than Romney.
[02:33:53.220 --> 02:34:01.780]  And I can get that argument at some level. The fact is Obama is so bad on every front
[02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:06.020]  and will launch just as many wars that I know that's why the elite put him in there.
[02:34:07.220 --> 02:34:13.620]  Finishing up with Petraeus, this is the season of scandals. They'll use this to distract
[02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:19.460]  from other issues in the economy. They'll use it to play political football.
[02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:23.700]  There's kind of a balance of power in the structure so Obama doesn't get too much power,
[02:34:23.700 --> 02:34:28.340]  but they always had this stuff on her and the claim that the FBI got it because there were
[02:34:28.340 --> 02:34:33.620]  complaints. They already had that just waiting there. Oh, they accidentally learned about all
[02:34:33.620 --> 02:34:39.060]  this right as he was supposed to testify. Give me a break. They shit on this dirt until they're
[02:34:39.060 --> 02:34:47.220]  ready to use it. And clearly, the ambassador was not going along with giving missiles
[02:34:47.220 --> 02:34:55.700]  to Al Qaeda that were stored at the facility, 15,000 of them, 10,000 of them, heat seeker missiles.
[02:34:57.380 --> 02:35:00.580]  In fact, I was corrected by Colonel Schaefer and looked it up. I was saying only a few
[02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:06.580]  thousand were heat seeking. Most of them, more than two thirds, over 10,000 to 15,000 are heat
[02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:13.940]  seeker. And wow, the point is the ambassador didn't play ball and had to be eliminated.
[02:35:13.940 --> 02:35:19.300]  And that's what Pachinic says, but he says, oh, the neocons didn't like him because he was an
[02:35:19.300 --> 02:35:23.700]  Arabist. That means I guess he was snuggled up to the Arabs. There was some other double cross
[02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:29.940]  going on. The point is Obama lied about this and he's been caught lying. That's admitted. He knew
[02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:34.500]  it was a sophisticated coordinated attack. It went on for seven hours, not an hour,
[02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:39.300]  and they ordered a stand down. And that's now coming out. And this is big because the system
[02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:43.540]  is promoting it and it's now out there. There's all sorts of scandals like the stupid fake
[02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:49.940]  bin Laden rescue thing. So we'll continue to track all of that, but this is really a way
[02:35:49.940 --> 02:35:58.580]  to just bring down Obama if they want. If he does everything he's told, then he may be left alone.
[02:35:58.580 --> 02:36:04.420]  So they're puppets, but they're important puppets. Briefly hear a lot of people,
[02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:07.780]  because I see it in the comments and stuff, are asking what they should do to be prepared.
[02:36:07.780 --> 02:36:11.140]  I've told you, you should have a high quality, pro-peer water filter, plus it supports the
[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:17.620]  broadcast discount of 15% with the promo code water15 and infowarstore.com. And you should get
[02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:22.980]  storable foods. Where do I get my storable foods? Well, I get them from efoodsdirect.com
[02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:28.900]  forward slash Alex to find the six free meal deal they've got where they'll ship you six free meals

[02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:59.460]  the oldest continually operating operation up in Utah. They're the experts. Steve Shank,
[02:36:59.460 --> 02:37:05.060]  this is where I get my food, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[02:37:05.060 --> 02:37:11.060]  Okay, let's hurry now before we go to Watson to Christian in New Jersey. Thanks for holding.
[02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:15.540]  You've been a trooper. I'll give you the floor. Where are you on the Obama situation?
[02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:22.740]  Yes, Alex. How are you, Alex? Instead I took over the phone. My wife, you know, she's an
[02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:28.500]  Obama lover. I'm not. Okay, well, what's your take on all this?
[02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:34.580]  My take on all this is that we've been deceived from the beginning, Alex. I've been a dumb child.
[02:37:34.580 --> 02:37:39.940]  I was a child at one time like you. I'm 52 now. They've been saying things are going to get better,
[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:43.620]  better, better. It's been a shame since I'm a child. Nothing has gotten better.
[02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:51.140]  We've got demons that run for presidency. We got people that are so numb down they don't see
[02:37:51.140 --> 02:37:57.460]  anything. I've had AR-15s put at me in the last couple of months. Nine millimeters from the state
[02:37:57.460 --> 02:38:04.020]  troop is up here in Long Valley, New Jersey. They're all corrupt. Alex, this town was called
[02:38:04.020 --> 02:38:10.260]  Germantown at one time. Forget about it. It's full of Nazis. They drink fluoride. They're trying
[02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:17.220]  to put fluoride pills in the people's wells out here in Jersey. I saw that. In fact, I have a
[02:38:17.220 --> 02:38:21.140]  bunch of fluoride news here I'm going to mention in a moment since you brought this up, sir. But
[02:38:21.780 --> 02:38:26.100]  what's incredible is I'm seeing now if there's a bank robbery somewhere in a city,
[02:38:26.100 --> 02:38:30.020]  say like Denver that was on the news a month ago, but it's happening everywhere,
[02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:35.780]  they'll set up a checkpoint randomly on purpose with news cameras and point M16s
[02:38:36.340 --> 02:38:41.700]  at cars full of people just to get you used to it. That's what they're doing. And I actually have
[02:38:41.700 --> 02:38:46.820]  a stack of fluoride news here. And we have a victory, huge fluoride victory in Wichita. Voters say no
[02:38:47.700 --> 02:38:52.180]  to the water supply, chemical additive, linked to brain damage. But here's the bad news. Remember
[02:38:52.180 --> 02:39:00.100]  Tampa and Pinellas County voted with over a million people in the county to get the water out.
[02:39:00.100 --> 02:39:05.700]  Big money came in and ousted the two Republicans that got the fluoride out. And the other guy has
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:11.620]  sworn here in the Tampa Bay Times to get it back in the water and apologize for being against it.
[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:16.340]  So I mean, it's electronic voting machines. But absolutely, I mean, folks, they're killing us
[02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:21.140]  with fluoride. They don't care about us. Again, I know Romney was bad, but what do you make of
[02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:28.980]  the Obama supporters all giddy and laughing and calling in going, you lost, you know, you failed,
[02:39:28.980 --> 02:39:32.900]  you know, you're got it and get in. I mean, it's crazy.
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:40.100]  They might go on that man. They're all listen, Obama gives them food stamps. They don't have to
[02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:46.180]  do anything. I'm from New York. I'm from Brooklyn, New York. Listen, I've seen the worst and the best.
[02:39:46.180 --> 02:39:51.620]  Okay, they've been selling them drugs. Forget it. The drugs are out there on blue. One drugs is
[02:39:51.620 --> 02:39:56.420]  a sand that's taking our money and putting it in someone else's pocket, maybe a raw child or one
[02:39:56.420 --> 02:40:00.740]  of the builder birds. Exactly. You make it illegal so they make higher prices and they take our
[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:04.820]  liberties looking for the stuff they put on the streets. Absolutely. They're a bunch of
[02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:09.700]  bombs, dirty, maggot, cockroaches. The way you say it out, I love it for that. The only thing I
[02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:15.220]  don't like what you say is you talk about ex-cons. Ex-cons change their ways. After 10 years,
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:19.700]  they should be able to arm themselves to their tilts if it's legal. You know what I'm saying?
[02:40:19.700 --> 02:40:23.460]  As long as it wasn't filing crimes for the ex-cons because they...
[02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:26.660]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. You may have missed what I was saying. God bless you, sir. Great
[02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:31.860]  caller. You must have missed what I was saying. We have the biggest prison population the world's
[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:38.020]  ever seen. We have double the people in prison than Communist China and they outnumber our population
[02:40:38.020 --> 02:40:47.940]  four to one. They're 1.25 billion. We're 315 million. They're the math. Almost four times
[02:40:47.940 --> 02:40:55.300]  our population. I'm doing that longhand in my brain. You guys pull up. It's four to one, I know,
[02:40:55.300 --> 02:41:00.180]  but just double check it for me. But get the newest census numbers. I think it's 1.3 billion
[02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:09.140]  actually now in China. The issue here is that once they've gotten you into the criminal justice
[02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:16.420]  system for marijuana or you're a kid and you rob something out of a mailbox when you're 14,
[02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:20.340]  they're now trying to keep those records and keep you in the system so they can take your rights
[02:41:20.340 --> 02:41:24.900]  for stuff you did as a kid. And I wasn't really a troublemaker other than getting in fights and
[02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:28.660]  stuff, but I mean nowadays they throw people in jail for a long time for the type of stuff I did.
[02:41:28.660 --> 02:41:33.620]  You know, stuff like stealing beer out of golf carts, being in the truck with kids and they
[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:37.220]  were tying chains to street signs and ripping them out of the ground. I mean I do a lot of that,
[02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:42.180]  but I was there doing a few things. You probably get killed nowadays doing. Yeah, they're almost
[02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:52.020]  1.4 billion now. 1,339 million. And so you add 315 million into that. Yeah, it's four times our
[02:41:52.020 --> 02:42:00.580]  population plus. So the point is that, yes, no, no, no, I believe like we had pre-1968
[02:42:00.580 --> 02:42:05.140]  Gun Control Act, you got out of jail the old days, they'd hand you your guns. If you were arrested
[02:42:05.140 --> 02:42:09.220]  with a gun that was legally yours, they'd give you your gun back when you got out of prison.
[02:42:09.220 --> 02:42:13.140]  And that's what it's all about. You got your gun, buddy. I got mine. And you try to do something
[02:42:13.140 --> 02:42:17.300]  to me and my family. I'm going to use my second amendment to put you six feet under. Look at
[02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:21.300]  Chicago. Look at New York. Look what they've done. I got to go to Watson. Then I'll get to the other
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:26.820]  Obama supporters, Mac and Jeff and Ron. I promise if I have to go into overdrive, I'll get to you.
[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:32.740]  Continuing here, bringing up Paul Joseph Watson. Watson, before we get into the national opt out
[02:42:32.740 --> 02:42:40.820]  campaign, tell us about this unbelievably painful to watch video up at infowars.com of this lady
[02:42:40.820 --> 02:42:46.980]  and what TSA is now doing to women's genitals. They now grab your genitals and ask you questions
[02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:51.460]  about them. This has been confirmed. Tell us about that and the national opt out,
[02:42:51.460 --> 02:42:55.860]  film the TSA campaign and how important it is for people when they film it to post it
[02:42:55.860 --> 02:43:03.380]  and in the byline say that, you know, national film the TSA day. Go ahead, Paul Watson.
[02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:09.780]  Well, you know, another day, another TSA scandal that happens every day. This was a 58 year old
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:14.260]  woman who was traveling through Birmingham, Alabama. And basically she set off the metal
[02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:21.380]  detector. She had a grope down which involved the TSA agent literally squeezing her genitalia.
[02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:25.620]  And they're supposed to take the medical card. She's got knee implants. They just ignore those.
[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:32.820]  Go ahead. Yeah. So basically she had invasive grope down after invasive grope down and they
[02:43:32.820 --> 02:43:38.340]  basically came around her in a huddle all these TSA agents and started insinuating in public
[02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:43.140]  that she had a penis that she had a protrusion on the left side of her in a thigh.
[02:43:43.140 --> 02:43:47.780]  So basically they go to a back room. They perform. I mean, she must have been
[02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:54.500]  grope down about four or five times by the end of it. Eventually a TSA agent does the pat down,
[02:43:54.500 --> 02:44:00.100]  says there's nothing here. What are you talking about? Refuses to even wonder. And she's let go on
[02:44:00.100 --> 02:44:04.500]  away. I mean, you'd have to watch her video to get the full sense of it. But just another day,
[02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:15.620]  another scandal. And the fact is that the TSA now has 65,000 employees up from 16,500 since 911.
[02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:19.700]  And of course we know they're expanding. They're not just in airports. There are highways,
[02:44:19.700 --> 02:44:25.860]  there are political events, you know, music concerts, even school prom nights. So this whole
[02:44:25.860 --> 02:44:31.220]  cop out of let's just boycott the airlines and not fly doesn't work because they're everywhere.
[02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:36.180]  They're on the highways, they're flagging down truck drivers. And they're expanding like a virus,
[02:44:36.180 --> 02:44:41.140]  you know, four times the amount of employees since they were formed 10 years ago. And it's only
[02:44:41.140 --> 02:44:46.820]  getting bigger and bigger. And the studies that have been done actually show that in these times
[02:44:46.820 --> 02:44:52.340]  of austerity, when we're being all told to cut our cloth, if you got rid of the TSA replace them
[02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:57.540]  with private screeners, not only would they be more efficient, you know, the TSA's never caught
[02:44:57.540 --> 02:45:04.180]  a terrorist, they've actually let slip 16 terrorists, 70% of the weapons that go through airports
[02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:10.340]  are not detected by TSA. So they're provably useless. Their body scanners are useless. They
[02:45:10.340 --> 02:45:15.860]  can't detect objects sewn inside the clothing. And yet you would save a billion dollars, you would
[02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:22.740]  screen 65% more passengers if you replace TSA with private security, which a few airports are now
[02:45:22.740 --> 02:45:29.460]  doing. But another stat is, and this is beyond all the indignity and, you know, harassing cancer
[02:45:29.460 --> 02:45:34.500]  survivors, disabled veterans that we hear every day, the simple numbers show that this agency
[02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:41.540]  needs to be abolished immediately. You go through a TSA x-ray body scanner one time, one time, and
[02:45:41.540 --> 02:45:47.780]  that equals the same threat posed by you being killed in a terrorist attack. So these scanners
[02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:54.100]  that are supposedly there to stop terrorists are actually going to kill more people than terrorists,
[02:45:54.100 --> 02:46:00.500]  more people are going to get cancer. So you can go across the board and the numbers prove that
[02:46:00.500 --> 02:46:04.980]  they should be abolished immediately, the private screeners can do a better job. And that's before
[02:46:04.980 --> 02:46:10.900]  you even get to the privacy debate and the scandal after scandal that the TSA has been involved in.
[02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:18.740]  And with the criminal mindset of the globalists, they're all about dominating us and throwing it
[02:46:18.740 --> 02:46:23.860]  in our face. I'm going to tie Lance Armstrong into this. If you guys will punch up the screen I've
[02:46:23.860 --> 02:46:32.660]  got here. Lance Armstrong's trolling comments Forbes is reporting the disgraced cyclist posted
[02:46:32.660 --> 02:46:40.180]  to a popular photo site, an image of him lying around in his Austin trophy room off of Lake
[02:46:40.180 --> 02:46:46.100]  Austin. The photo shows Armstrong relaxing in his trophy room in Austin, Texas, basking in the
[02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:51.220]  globe of his seven famed Tour de France jerseys back in Austin just laying around was the caption.
[02:46:51.940 --> 02:46:56.580]  Purely meant obviously to just getting everybody's face about the fact that they've stripped him
[02:46:56.580 --> 02:47:00.820]  of his trophies. Now I'm not here demonizing Lance Armstrong. He made money off cancer
[02:47:00.820 --> 02:47:05.940]  treatments and not telling folks that it's being engineered. I know I got the information to him.
[02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:10.180]  It's the fact that that's that mindset. They're coming after him. He's going to get criminal
[02:47:10.180 --> 02:47:15.620]  charges. There's no doubt down the road because he has testified before in court and perjured
[02:47:15.620 --> 02:47:22.020]  himself. And he's still arrogantly showing people his jerseys like a primitive monkey or
[02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:28.900]  something waving around. It's like royalty wearing gold crowns. This mindset of dominator
[02:47:28.900 --> 02:47:36.100]  loves to flaunt petty signants of power in front of our face. This is the sociopath slash psychopath
[02:47:36.660 --> 02:47:40.740]  worldview when you will put the photo up here on screen. And that ties into the same arrogance
[02:47:40.740 --> 02:47:46.980]  of government and their minions, the TSA. But I want to say this, the bullying, the dominating,
[02:47:46.980 --> 02:47:51.620]  the going after women, the making old ladies that can't walk, having people help them get up,
[02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:55.860]  the screaming at people that's happened to my grandmother in Houston airport when she's on
[02:47:55.860 --> 02:48:01.780]  crutches. I mean, just things you couldn't believe. This is what tyranny is. They do it because that's
[02:48:01.780 --> 02:48:07.060]  why they're in control because they like to do it. What is abhorrent to those of us that have art,
[02:48:07.060 --> 02:48:13.540]  that have have have fire in our soul, that have creativity. Those of us that love energy, that's
[02:48:13.540 --> 02:48:19.780]  good. Those of us that love wholesomeness. We're the enemy of these people. It's all about domination
[02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:25.380]  for them. And it's time we stand up to them. You know, good people take it like it's rude or
[02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:31.060]  dominant to get back in dominant people's faces. No, you've got to do it. You've got to stand up
[02:48:31.060 --> 02:48:36.580]  and crush these people politically. Paul Watson. Well, I mean, that's exactly it. They get off on
[02:48:36.580 --> 02:48:43.540]  it. And that's proven by the fact that people who disobey or even mildly complain about TSA
[02:48:43.540 --> 02:48:48.340]  security procedures are punished. You know, there was a case a few weeks ago about somebody
[02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:54.420]  quote smacked in the testicles for merely raising a bone of contention about a TSA growdown. There
[02:48:54.420 --> 02:49:00.820]  was a case a couple of weeks before that a guy had $500 stolen out of his wallet after he'd gone
[02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:07.140]  to a private screening with another two TSA agents. He came back. The other TSA agent had stolen his
[02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:11.940]  money. So they actually punished people. There was a woman kicked off a flight merely for quote
[02:49:11.940 --> 02:49:16.420]  having a bad attitude for the fact she wasn't happy about them testing her drink that she'd
[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:22.020]  purchased inside the airport. And then all these other ridiculous obedience policies like, you
[02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:28.900]  know, the chat downs and the freeze the so called all stock policy where people are made to stand in
[02:49:28.900 --> 02:49:34.260]  one place like statues and not move just a pure expression of authority, no purpose behind it
[02:49:34.260 --> 02:49:39.860]  whatsoever. It's obedience training. It's ridiculous. And the TSA admits that they can't even enforce
[02:49:39.860 --> 02:49:45.540]  these policies with any kind of law. Because the majority of Americans in that poll we took would
[02:49:45.540 --> 02:49:51.620]  like to turn TSA agents into God that shows how much we're up against. But the TSA admits on its
[02:49:51.620 --> 02:49:56.500]  own website that you can freely film that security procedure so long as you're not involved with
[02:49:56.500 --> 02:50:00.980]  them. So that's exactly what we're going to do as part of this opt out and film campaign. And it's
[02:50:00.980 --> 02:50:07.620]  info wars.com slash opt out as opt out of the naked body scan as opt out the ridiculous obedience
[02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:12.820]  training and exercise the First Amendment in filming the TSA because we've learned that when
[02:50:12.820 --> 02:50:17.540]  they're filmed and when they know they're being recorded, they treat people with more dignity.
[02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:21.780]  Sure. And every day is filmed the TSA David starting next Monday running through the busiest
[02:50:21.780 --> 02:50:28.820]  travel time of the year. Shoot it, film it, put it up there. And also we've got some flyers up
[02:50:28.820 --> 02:50:32.980]  there about the radiation dangers of the scanners. I think it's a good idea to hand some of those
[02:50:32.980 --> 02:50:37.700]  out to people and then upload it to YouTube. And when they all act like you're a criminal,
[02:50:37.700 --> 02:50:42.340]  we also have linked on there where they admit you can film them. Okay, so it's also important to
[02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:46.740]  hand them that. Like when the NSA told my reporters they couldn't film the NSA building,
[02:50:46.740 --> 02:50:53.940]  I had them hand them a article about the NSA losing lawsuits and they didn't grab their footage like
[02:50:53.940 --> 02:50:59.460]  they've done the local San Antonio TV and news because we told them, hey, we know you're exceeding
[02:50:59.460 --> 02:51:04.660]  your constitutional authority. Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power,
[02:51:04.660 --> 02:51:08.820]  even save money on your electric bill? If so, this is going to be the most important message you
[02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:14.260]  will ever hear. Solar power generators are now available. These emergency backup systems provide
[02:51:14.260 --> 02:51:19.140]  life saving electrical power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator
[02:51:19.140 --> 02:51:23.940]  runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity from the sun. It's like having an
[02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:28.340]  electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, shortwave radios,
[02:51:28.340 --> 02:51:32.580]  computers and even keep your food from spoiling. Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts
[02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:36.980]  or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again. And here's the best news,

[02:53:32.900 --> 02:53:38.260]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial
[02:53:38.260 --> 02:53:42.740]  industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper
[02:53:42.740 --> 02:53:47.140]  investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement,
[02:53:47.140 --> 02:53:55.540]  call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation in low returns, call 800-686-2237.

[02:54:12.660 --> 02:54:19.940]  All right, got some breaking news up at infowars.com on the TSA. Not just do they now go in the
[02:54:19.940 --> 02:54:27.140]  pants and touch women's genitals. They make fun of it and ask them if it is a male organ.
[02:54:28.100 --> 02:54:32.420]  And this is all part of the domination and what they admit is they've done even ABC news pieces
[02:54:32.420 --> 02:54:39.620]  on it. They will scan your bags if it's got money or any jewelry they want or if it's got drugs
[02:54:39.620 --> 02:54:43.940]  they want depending on what type of criminal it is. They will then call you for a private
[02:54:43.940 --> 02:54:49.860]  grope room, rape room type situation and while they may take you there an hour while they steal
[02:54:49.860 --> 02:54:54.580]  everything out of your bags and I mean they've had them plead guilty to stealing upwards of a
[02:54:54.580 --> 02:55:01.700]  million dollars a year in these in these prisoner training facilities. We've got big articles about
[02:55:01.700 --> 02:55:06.020]  the FEMA camps in New York and New Jersey, hellish kicking the media out, people huddling,
[02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:12.740]  freezing, people dying of exposure. It is just hellish. It is government. It's what you saw in
[02:55:12.740 --> 02:55:16.980]  the Superdome. So all of you begging for your Obama phone you're going to be getting it. We're
[02:55:16.980 --> 02:55:22.100]  going to take a few of those and overdrive in a moment. But breaking up at infowars.com right now,
[02:55:22.100 --> 02:55:26.340]  linked in red. Watson's written three articles today. Talk about prolific with all our other great
[02:55:26.340 --> 02:55:33.220]  writers. Aaron Dykes has the coming re-floridation of Pinellas County, Florida. Amazing how big
[02:55:33.220 --> 02:55:40.020]  money came in and did that and then we've got Watson's article, Texas bill with ban invasive
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:47.620]  TSA patdowns. Again, that's a great headline but the point is Texas to fight, Texas prepares for
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:53.860]  war with TSA again. The point is it's new. It's new. Watson, that's a great headline but I don't
[02:55:53.860 --> 02:55:59.540]  people are going to understand that it is a new fight kind of like the Center Amendment Center
[02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:07.540]  rematch. Texas takes on the TSA again. They've got an article on it but you know maybe you should
[02:56:07.540 --> 02:56:13.300]  just add rematch to the start of the headlines. People understand that it is back on. So very
[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:17.780]  exciting. That passed unanimously in the House. Dewhurst killed it procedurally with the Weasel
[02:56:17.780 --> 02:56:23.700]  Perry. That and his love of forced inoculations that he fraudulently said was the law is what
[02:56:23.700 --> 02:56:26.900]  most political opponents in the polls said destroyed Rick Perry. But it doesn't matter
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:31.460]  you got your globalist money. So that's what matters. You dirtbags as former CIA operative
[02:56:31.460 --> 02:56:36.660]  working with the Klaus Barbie down in South America. I mean Dewhurst looks like a psychopath
[02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:40.660]  from a movie. So in fact Hollywood hire him to play killers in movies. I mean been around
[02:56:40.660 --> 02:56:44.660]  the guy personally at the Capitol. Looks like a demon. You are. You're not an American piece
[02:56:44.660 --> 02:56:51.380]  of trash. Anyways, I want people abusing American citizens. Go ahead Watson. Any other
[02:56:51.380 --> 02:56:56.820]  points you think you should add about infowars.com forward slash opt out? Have we added that forward
[02:56:56.820 --> 02:57:03.300]  slash opt out on prison planet too? Yeah, redirects to there. Yeah, basically on the Texas bill it
[02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:10.740]  would also ban basically the TSA removing a child from their parents custody, which they like to do
[02:57:10.740 --> 02:57:15.460]  because they like to conduct the grow downs on minors as well. So not only would it ban
[02:57:16.420 --> 02:57:22.660]  touching the genitals, it would ban that as well. Yeah, the convicted pedophiles in hundreds of
[02:57:22.660 --> 02:57:28.740]  cases can't take them to a private pedo area. Exactly. But with the opt out campaign basically
[02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:34.180]  I just wanted to say we want other activist groups to get involved. This is not just an infowars.com
[02:57:34.180 --> 02:57:39.700]  thing. We need everybody to get involved. We're quite happy to give you the promotion. The email's
[02:57:39.700 --> 02:57:45.620]  on that page. Yeah, let's be clear. You can say it's your idea. This is about me being able to fly
[02:57:45.620 --> 02:57:50.020]  without perverts dragging my daughters off to a dungeon. They're now sitting at highway checkpoints.
[02:57:50.020 --> 02:57:54.420]  It's about defeating the TSA. Lewrockwell.com has been helping a lot of others. They have Drudge
[02:57:54.420 --> 02:57:59.220]  Report. Link to some of our articles about it a few weeks ago. Thank you to drudgerport.com.
[02:57:59.220 --> 02:58:03.060]  We need everybody's help. Now is the time. Thanksgiving is coming.
[02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:09.700]  Exactly. We need all the we are change groups involved as well. But the flyers at infowars.com
[02:58:09.700 --> 02:58:13.540]  slash opt out all the information's there. We're going to be updating that page more and more over
[02:58:13.540 --> 02:58:20.260]  the next few days. And it's November 19 to 26. So it's one week today is when it starts. You can
[02:58:20.260 --> 02:58:24.740]  do it before that and get the video to us whenever you like. But as long as you get it to us within
[02:58:24.740 --> 02:58:30.100]  that two week period. And my email is on there. You can either email the video directly to me.
[02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:35.060]  Of course, we'll also be looking out on YouTube. Make sure you put the right tags in it TSA opt
[02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:40.020]  out and film so we can pick up the video. Great job Watson. Obama supporters straight ahead.

[03:00:16.340 --> 03:00:24.420]  Moving quick here, Jeff in California says he supports Obama listing on an Android app.
[03:00:25.140 --> 03:00:34.100]  So Jeff, why are you supporting Obama? Well, I really think that Obama is part of a much greater
[03:00:34.740 --> 03:00:40.580]  agenda than most of the Obama supporters even think of. I think that the fact that, you know,
[03:00:40.580 --> 03:00:46.740]  Prop 37 failed in California and, you know, everything that's going as planned, we need
[03:00:46.740 --> 03:00:52.660]  this stuff to happen for population control. And I think Obama agrees with most of us on that.
[03:00:52.660 --> 03:01:03.060]  And it's sad that you don't. Say that again, sir. Oh, I was saying that the population control with
[03:01:03.060 --> 03:01:09.540]  the GMO foods and everything, I think with voting Obama in that he can push that through and make
[03:01:09.540 --> 03:01:16.820]  sure that we get that taken care of because it's a must for our future. Obama is full of pro-GMO
[03:01:16.820 --> 03:01:21.860]  people like no one else and is pushing it on us. I mean, are you saying, what are you getting at?
[03:01:25.540 --> 03:01:29.940]  Well, yeah, I do run into a lot of Democrats that are actually eugenicist and conscious of it. So
[03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:36.500]  you think that's good? Yeah. So you're pro-Obama because he wants to kill the minorities?
[03:01:36.500 --> 03:01:43.220]  Not necessarily, Joe. He wants to save humanity in the future.
[03:01:44.420 --> 03:01:48.580]  No, I understand. That's what they say. Just get rid of everybody. Okay. Well,
[03:01:48.580 --> 03:01:51.300]  at least you're honest about it. So you like forced abortions too?
[03:01:54.660 --> 03:02:01.300]  I can agree on some levels, sure. Yeah. Would you, would you let's say, what about some woman had
[03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:08.100]  maybe was a rape victim? Sure, sir. I understand all the hypothetical stuff out there.
[03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:13.700]  My issue is we know where all this comes from. We know where it leads. It's called Soviet Russia,
[03:02:13.700 --> 03:02:19.220]  Nazi Germany. Those were all scientific tyrannies for the same reasons by the beamcars on top that
[03:02:19.220 --> 03:02:25.220]  think they know best. I appreciate your call. Unbelievable. Mack in New Hampshire, you're on
[03:02:25.220 --> 03:02:32.660]  the air. Welcome. Hi, Alex. How are you? Good. Welcome. Yeah. You know, I'm not really free
[03:02:32.660 --> 03:02:39.060]  the one of them, but I think I hate a Romney more because he was more for Israel. And that's why I
[03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:42.660]  didn't want them. Yeah, I'm sorry. They were just talking to me in my ear. What were you saying?
[03:02:43.460 --> 03:02:48.580]  I'm sorry. I didn't want Romney because Romney was more for Israel.
[03:02:48.580 --> 03:02:54.980]  And I don't really agree with anything Israel does. Well, they've done a pretty good job at acting
[03:02:54.980 --> 03:03:01.540]  like Obama is anti-Israel, but I actually find it to be the opposite. So he is for Israel then.
[03:03:03.540 --> 03:03:07.220]  Yeah, you see, there's a difference between rhetoric and stuff on the surface.
[03:03:07.700 --> 03:03:12.580]  Oh, yeah, he's pledged eternal fealty to whoever runs Israel. And then he wants to, you know,
[03:03:12.580 --> 03:03:16.660]  go after Iran and all that. I mean, both candidates took turns seeing who could
[03:03:16.660 --> 03:03:19.940]  prostrate themselves greater before Israel.
[03:03:21.220 --> 03:03:28.340]  Okay, then. So I know you always think Israel is okay, but, you know, I look at it this way,
[03:03:28.340 --> 03:03:35.220]  you got young kids and I pray for you. I've got a young son. And I know that Israel has half its
[03:03:35.220 --> 03:03:42.980]  missiles pointed at America. I do not like Israel. I wish Israel would get blown off the map, to be
[03:03:42.980 --> 03:03:48.260]  honest with you. Well, let me say this. It's like a guy calling in earlier saying, I know you're
[03:03:48.260 --> 03:03:53.060]  against felons owning guns. I've actually said get rid of the 68 gun control act because a felon who's
[03:03:53.060 --> 03:03:57.860]  still a bad guy, most of them are innocent, it turns out, but a felon who's still a bad guy is
[03:03:57.860 --> 03:04:02.740]  going to have a gun anyways. So I need my guns. Now they're putting people who've done nothing
[03:04:02.740 --> 03:04:07.460]  wrong in jail as felons to get our guns. I'm against it. And it's the same thing with what you
[03:04:07.460 --> 03:04:16.020]  just said. I don't just blindly support Israel, but I don't mindlessly or blindly just hate Israel.
[03:04:16.900 --> 03:04:21.860]  Israel, all these countries are run by corrupt out of control groups. And when I do criticize Israel,
[03:04:22.740 --> 03:04:28.500]  those that hate Israel have such a narrative that I must work for Israel or something that it couldn't
[03:04:28.500 --> 03:04:35.940]  be true. They get even more upset. So, you know, hey, Obama's in there, man, just enjoy your
[03:04:35.940 --> 03:04:41.380]  hey, Obama's in there, man, just enjoy the mega banks put him in. And I just cannot believe
[03:04:42.660 --> 03:04:48.020]  how incredibly supportive people are of Obama out there. They really think he's going to save them.
[03:04:48.580 --> 03:04:52.500]  And it is just so sad. That's that's all I'm saying. It's the love of Obama
[03:04:53.380 --> 03:04:56.420]  that is that is so shocking and so out of control.
[03:04:56.420 --> 03:05:06.420]  Retransmission coming up, Gerald Salante tonight in Forrest, 90 News.
