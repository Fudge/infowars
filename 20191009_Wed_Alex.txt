[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:33.260]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:34.740 --> 00:54.340]  It is Wednesday, October 9th, 2019, and we live in very interesting times.
[00:54.340 --> 00:57.860]  And we're learning who will really have the mandate of heaven.
[00:57.860 --> 01:02.740]  Will it be Donald Trump, the American people, or will it be the vicious murderous tricombs
[01:02.740 --> 01:10.260]  that again, hold the record for the most people ever killed, times at least three times, four
[01:10.260 --> 01:18.100]  to five times what Hitler killed, twice what the Soviet Russians ever killed.
[01:18.100 --> 01:19.100]  That's from their own numbers.
[01:19.100 --> 01:26.580]  And that's who dictates to us from the moral high ground of what can be an Tiffany's commercial
[01:26.580 --> 01:37.260]  or what a online video game event can talk about or say in America or what the NBA managers
[01:37.260 --> 01:45.380]  or players can discuss or what can be on South Park or what can be in Matt Damon's The Martian
[01:45.380 --> 01:49.580]  or the upcoming Top Gun 2.
[01:49.580 --> 01:58.780]  This is really awakened America and the world at a level 50 times what Epstein running pedophile
[01:58.780 --> 02:01.140]  rings did.
[02:01.140 --> 02:08.100]  The globalists are in deep trouble, and the real polls show Trump 17 to 25 points ahead
[02:08.100 --> 02:13.420]  of any of the Democrats America is in love with Trump, in love with the awakening, they're
[02:13.420 --> 02:18.620]  in love with Info Wars, and that's why they can't let us have contact with you.
[02:18.620 --> 02:22.540]  That's why they work as hard as they can to keep us from you and tell you lies about who
[02:22.540 --> 02:23.540]  we are.
[02:23.540 --> 02:28.100]  And then they have canned studio audiences last week on Stephen Colbert, the comedian
[02:28.100 --> 02:33.420]  posing as a newsman, who's really just a propagandist, when Hillary came on with her crew there
[02:33.420 --> 02:40.020]  and standing ovations and now she went on Lair News Hour last night on PBS and said,
[02:40.020 --> 02:43.260]  yeah, maybe I will go for another run.
[02:43.260 --> 02:45.260]  Maybe third time is the charm.
[02:45.260 --> 02:46.260]  I beat him once.
[02:46.260 --> 02:47.260]  I can beat him again.
[02:47.260 --> 02:52.300]  Well, your massive election fraud almost beat Trump, but you failed in the electoral college
[02:52.300 --> 02:56.020]  and you lost which and she is intending to run.
[02:56.020 --> 02:59.540]  She told people two years ago she was going to run again and the Democrats freaked out
[02:59.540 --> 03:01.380]  and the corruption started coming out.
[03:01.380 --> 03:06.820]  So she withdrew her tentacles for then but kept fundraising, kept going around giving
[03:06.820 --> 03:08.460]  speeches.
[03:08.460 --> 03:09.660]  She's running for president.
[03:09.660 --> 03:11.820]  She's not going to run.
[03:11.820 --> 03:14.460]  She is running and you heard it here first.
[03:14.460 --> 03:19.060]  You know, they talk about the Oracle of Omaha being Warren Buffett.
[03:19.060 --> 03:21.140]  Well, he always has the inside knowledge.
[03:21.140 --> 03:23.660]  Well, I study history.
[03:23.660 --> 03:26.100]  I study facts and it really is true.
[03:26.100 --> 03:31.260]  No one is as accurate as in force and that's not an statement in arrogance.
[03:31.260 --> 03:35.300]  It's a very dangerous thing because we're willing to tell the truth.
[03:35.300 --> 03:36.300]  Most people know the truth.
[03:36.300 --> 03:37.300]  Just won't tell you.
[03:37.300 --> 03:40.940]  Hell, most of you know more than I do.
[03:40.940 --> 03:42.740]  You don't need to be an oracle to know all this.
[03:42.740 --> 03:47.780]  You've got to have common sense, but we are at the crossroads.
[03:47.780 --> 03:51.860]  You can use that term, but there's no way to overuse it.
[03:51.860 --> 03:52.860]  This is it.
[03:52.860 --> 03:58.020]  And Communist China, the most evil regime in planetary history is trying to dictate the
[03:58.020 --> 04:00.180]  terms of our surrender.
[04:00.180 --> 04:01.180]  And why not?
[04:01.180 --> 04:04.020]  I mean, we've capitulated to everything else.
[04:04.020 --> 04:07.780]  We've been taught to be good little politically correct minions.
[04:07.780 --> 04:10.580]  Here's Hillary Clinton.
[04:10.580 --> 04:12.620]  If you're a radio listener, you're lucky because you want to look at her.
[04:12.620 --> 04:14.860]  She looks like a possessed jack-o'-lantern.
[04:14.860 --> 04:17.820]  The woman could be in a horror movie without makeup.
[04:17.820 --> 04:19.320]  Here she is.
[04:19.320 --> 04:24.380]  I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should try to enter the race to try and steal it
[04:24.380 --> 04:28.220]  away from Uber left Elizabeth Warren.
[04:28.220 --> 04:29.220]  Only one condition.
[04:29.220 --> 04:34.860]  The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes in misdemeanors, including how and why.
[04:34.860 --> 04:37.060]  She deleted 33,000 emails.
[04:37.060 --> 04:42.660]  Yeah, you know, it truly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me.
[04:42.660 --> 04:48.460]  But this latest tweet is so typical of him.
[04:48.460 --> 04:53.140]  Nothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails.
[04:53.140 --> 04:54.140]  We all know that.
[04:54.140 --> 04:56.680]  So he's either lying or delusional or both.
[04:56.680 --> 05:01.380]  There was no subpoena as he says in a tweet this morning.
[05:01.380 --> 05:03.100]  So maybe there does need to be a rematch.
[05:03.100 --> 05:04.980]  I mean, obviously I can beat him again.
[05:04.980 --> 05:09.300]  But wow, they're right back.
[05:09.300 --> 05:12.540]  My phone has been ringing off the hook.
[05:12.540 --> 05:16.820]  Constitutional lawyers, national talk show host, prominent guest I've had on over the
[05:16.820 --> 05:17.820]  years.
[05:17.820 --> 05:19.820]  And they're all saying, Alex, it's incredible.
[05:19.820 --> 05:24.220]  You've been obsessing on China since you got on air 20-something years ago, and now
[05:24.220 --> 05:25.220]  it's all coming through.
[05:25.220 --> 05:26.740]  How did you know it?
[05:26.740 --> 05:30.140]  Because the Council on Foreign Relations is the shadow government, and they admitted
[05:30.140 --> 05:33.980]  the plan to transfer all power to communist China.
[05:33.980 --> 05:39.180]  And almost everyone calling me says, yeah, and they banned you because you were saying
[05:39.180 --> 05:42.380]  all that and how Silicon Valley, Google and Apple moved over there.
[05:42.380 --> 05:43.380]  And it's incredible.
[05:43.380 --> 05:44.380]  And wow, you're vindicated.
[05:44.380 --> 05:47.500]  You're going to get back on the air now, aren't you?
[05:47.500 --> 05:51.540]  And no, if we don't defeat this takeover, you're all going to be taken off.
[05:51.540 --> 05:54.140]  In fact, you're all going to end up getting put in prison camps.
[05:54.140 --> 05:55.420]  They're making their move.
[05:55.420 --> 05:56.900]  They're coming for your guns.
[05:56.900 --> 05:58.300]  They're coming for your kids.
[05:58.300 --> 06:00.260]  They're coming for your right to religion.
[06:00.260 --> 06:02.060]  They are coming for your soul.
[06:02.060 --> 06:06.980]  Well, you know what they say, you got to lower your ideals of freedom if you want to suck
[06:06.980 --> 06:09.980]  on the warm teat of China.
[06:09.980 --> 06:34.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, October 9, 2019, transmission.
[06:34.300 --> 06:38.620]  And I want to come in with some original Leonard Skinner tape out of the swamps of Florida
[06:38.620 --> 06:41.780]  for you to remind everybody that I can't show out.
[06:41.780 --> 06:42.780]  I can't back down.
[06:42.780 --> 06:44.020]  I can't turn my guns in.
[06:44.020 --> 06:47.020]  I can't turn my kids over to pedophiles.
[06:47.020 --> 06:50.100]  There's no getting me to ever compromise.
[06:50.100 --> 06:51.100]  But here's the deal.
[06:51.100 --> 06:52.100]  I know you're not going to compromise either.
[06:52.100 --> 06:55.020]  So let's work hard in the information wars.
[06:55.020 --> 06:56.620]  We don't have to go the physical route.
[06:56.620 --> 06:58.860]  But whatever happens, we're going to win this thing.
[06:58.860 --> 06:59.860]  You can feel it.
[06:59.860 --> 07:00.860]  You can see it.
[07:00.860 --> 07:01.860]  And the enemy knows it.
[07:01.860 --> 07:04.780]  Let's go ahead and let them hear a couple minutes of this anthem.
[07:04.780 --> 07:07.220]  It's time to fly free bird.
[07:07.220 --> 07:09.620]  Lord knows I can't change.
[07:09.620 --> 07:11.940]  Lord knows I can't lie to you.
[07:11.940 --> 07:12.940]  That's why you just get truth.
[07:12.940 --> 07:15.100]  That's why it all comes true.
[07:15.100 --> 07:18.660]  Because let me tell you, I'm not here even coming up with this information.
[07:18.660 --> 07:20.860]  It's just flowing through me.
[07:20.860 --> 07:22.260]  And it's going to flow through you.
[07:22.260 --> 07:26.260]  And instead of getting down and angry like I do as well, we got to decide and just meet
[07:26.260 --> 07:30.540]  Hillary and meet the globalists with Christ winning our sales and say, if they want to
[07:30.540 --> 07:32.940]  fight, I don't know how it's going to end.
[07:32.940 --> 07:35.860]  But they better believe they've got one.
[07:35.860 --> 07:42.860]  Let's listen to a little bit of this on this Wednesday Transmission.
[07:42.860 --> 07:57.340]  I don't see anything getting invented over there.
[07:57.340 --> 07:58.740]  It's all getting stolen.
[07:58.740 --> 08:01.140]  People may have high accused, but they don't have creativity.
[08:01.140 --> 08:02.640]  They've been slaves.
[08:02.640 --> 08:04.140]  I want to free them.
[08:04.140 --> 08:06.140]  Take it off.
[08:06.140 --> 08:09.140]  Heal the energy of the Republic.
[08:09.140 --> 08:12.140]  That's why they want control.
[08:12.140 --> 08:17.140]  Because America holds the destiny of the planet in its hands.
[08:17.140 --> 08:20.140]  We have the Providence, my friend.
[08:20.140 --> 08:21.140]  We have the future.
[08:21.140 --> 08:24.140]  And we're going to win in this fight together.
[08:24.140 --> 08:29.140]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday Worldwide Broadcast.
[08:29.140 --> 08:34.140]  We've got a big list of amazing guests coming on and a ton of news.
[08:34.140 --> 08:39.140]  But I do want to open those phones up and shake this transmission up because we've gone
[08:39.140 --> 08:41.140]  past the crossroads.
[08:41.140 --> 08:42.140]  And I can feel it.
[08:42.140 --> 08:43.140]  I can see it.
[08:43.140 --> 08:46.140]  We have now chosen the right path.
[08:46.140 --> 08:54.140]  It was at the 11th hour, 59th minute, 58th second, but two seconds to midnight.
[08:54.140 --> 08:59.140]  The soul of humanity, that will to our own destiny.
[08:59.140 --> 09:03.140]  The beginning of fulfilling that destiny took place, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:03.140 --> 09:07.140]  And I'm so honored to be with you here today.
[09:07.140 --> 09:10.140]  Okay, let me do it the best I can here, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:10.140 --> 09:17.140]  Let me go over this, the very, very best I can here for you and really try to break down
[09:17.140 --> 09:21.140]  what is happening and where we're going to be going on the transmission.
[09:21.140 --> 09:27.140]  Because I really try to just mirror the reality of what's going on and then try to put out
[09:27.140 --> 09:30.140]  the choices that I see humanity has to take.
[09:30.140 --> 09:33.140]  And then of course, from your own perspective, you may agree with that, you may disagree with
[09:33.140 --> 09:40.140]  that, but everything on this broadcast is coming from a place of pro-human, pro-justice
[09:40.140 --> 09:42.140]  future.
[09:42.140 --> 09:48.140]  And that really is my only goal and that will always be my goal.
[09:48.140 --> 09:51.140]  So let's break down what's coming up today.
[09:51.140 --> 09:58.140]  The dam has broken on the world awakening to the Chai Kong globalist threat.
[09:58.140 --> 10:04.140]  And that entire criminal power axis and how we have been positioned to be dependent on China.
[10:04.140 --> 10:10.140]  And how all of our brainwashing and manipulation that we have lived under by the enemy media,
[10:10.140 --> 10:14.140]  that is the enemy of the people, has been to try to break our will to moralize this
[10:14.140 --> 10:16.140]  and have us accept this.
[10:16.140 --> 10:19.140]  And so realizing that is half the battle.
[10:19.140 --> 10:24.140]  Then taking action and being a good person and working hard and speaking out will turn
[10:24.140 --> 10:26.140]  the tide completely historically.
[10:26.140 --> 10:28.140]  There won't be some utopia on the other side of it.
[10:28.140 --> 10:33.140]  We've still got major issues, but we won't be purposely oiling the skids into hell for
[10:33.140 --> 10:37.140]  ourselves and our children by going along with these people.
[10:37.140 --> 10:45.140]  Just incredible developments, huge awakenings as people sit back and go.
[10:45.140 --> 10:52.140]  They're having video game world series events with millions of viewers.
[10:52.140 --> 10:58.140]  And China is demanding people that are famous video game celebrities be banned from tournaments
[10:58.140 --> 11:04.140]  because they support Hong Kong freedom demonstrators.
[11:04.140 --> 11:13.140]  China is canceling NBA games and the NBA is groveling to them and apologizing.
[11:13.140 --> 11:19.140]  Other major organizations like Tiffany's bowed to the communist Chinese when they were
[11:19.140 --> 11:22.140]  offended by an ad in a magazine of a woman covering her eye.
[11:22.140 --> 11:30.140]  Like, oh, this is so exciting with the diamond ring on that her husband just gave her, her fiance.
[11:30.140 --> 11:33.140]  And so they just virtually signaled and banned that.
[11:33.140 --> 11:41.140]  When you ban what an authoritarian regime that's killed over 100 million people tells you to do,
[11:41.140 --> 11:43.140]  this guy's the limit.
[11:43.140 --> 11:47.140]  That's where we've gotten with the universities and the big corporations and all of it.
[11:47.140 --> 11:49.140]  So here's the big announcement here.
[11:49.140 --> 11:51.140]  And I want this to really sink in.
[11:51.140 --> 11:55.140]  And if I had a Twitter account, I would put this out on Twitter.
[11:55.140 --> 12:00.140]  But I'm here on Talk Radio and here on the Internet and here at infowars.com and newswars.com
[12:00.140 --> 12:01.140]  and band.video.
[12:01.140 --> 12:05.140]  But however you want to say it in your own words, if you agree with me, this rings true
[12:05.140 --> 12:09.140]  with you and I know it will, then however you do it.
[12:09.140 --> 12:14.140]  You call in the Talk Radio, you call in the national TV programs, you go give a speech
[12:14.140 --> 12:18.140]  in front of the city council or the state legislature or you go talk to your state representative
[12:18.140 --> 12:24.140]  when they're in town, they're still in town right now about to come back.
[12:24.140 --> 12:31.140]  And you say, listen, it's time for not just Americans but the people of the world to decide
[12:31.140 --> 12:35.140]  if they're for free speech because if you lose that, you're living in an authoritarian regime
[12:35.140 --> 12:39.140]  and then the secret arrest and the organ harvesting and having your business taken and having your
[12:39.140 --> 12:45.140]  children brainwashed and being forcibly inoculated and face scanning to buy and sell.
[12:45.140 --> 12:46.140]  China's now implementing that.
[12:46.140 --> 12:48.140]  Now it's coming here in major airports.
[12:48.140 --> 12:53.140]  If we don't start saying no to this, we're going to be taken to a very bad place very quick.
[12:53.140 --> 12:55.140]  So the whole world better decide.
[12:55.140 --> 13:01.140]  Are you with the globalist chai com, Mark of the Beast, authoritarian system?
[13:01.140 --> 13:06.140]  You're going to throw your lot in with it for better or worse, for richer or poorer,
[13:06.140 --> 13:12.140]  till death do you part, or do you want to go with the ideals of the West and the Renaissance
[13:12.140 --> 13:18.140]  and Christendom and Americana and everything that made us so great that everybody wants
[13:18.140 --> 13:22.140]  to take over and that now we become decadent and evil ourselves and we're losing.
[13:22.140 --> 13:27.140]  We want to go with what we know works in this race of life.
[13:27.140 --> 13:37.140]  A 800 horsepower Dodge Hellcat or do you want to be in a gremlin 100 horsepower vehicle
[13:37.140 --> 13:39.140]  that engine doesn't even start?
[13:39.140 --> 13:41.140]  I mean, it really comes down to that.
[13:41.140 --> 13:43.140]  We know communism is slavery.
[13:43.140 --> 13:46.140]  We know socialism is domestication into slavery.
[13:46.140 --> 13:48.140]  We know evil globalists run all this.
[13:48.140 --> 13:51.140]  We know powerful robber barons created communist China.
[13:51.140 --> 13:53.140]  They're victims of the new world order.
[13:53.140 --> 14:00.140]  So we have to openly and verbally on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and in your own personal life
[14:00.140 --> 14:05.140]  and calling into talk radio and calling Congress and getting up in front of your church this weekend.
[14:05.140 --> 14:07.140]  And if they don't want you to speak at your church, it's not a real church.
[14:07.140 --> 14:14.140]  Leave that place and say I support free speech and I support the pro-liberty demonstrators
[14:14.140 --> 14:17.140]  in Hong Kong who fled Mao Zedong 70 years ago, their parents and grandparents,
[14:17.140 --> 14:20.140]  and who have a treaty that China shouldn't be there for 30 years
[14:20.140 --> 14:24.140]  and who are being extradited without law to be killed.
[14:24.140 --> 14:27.140]  That's what they're fighting is the secret arrest law and extradition law.
[14:27.140 --> 14:29.140]  That's in our Declaration of Independence.
[14:29.140 --> 14:31.140]  The King of England was doing that to the colonies.
[14:31.140 --> 14:34.140]  It's one of the main beefs.
[14:34.140 --> 14:39.140]  So I want everyone to just really realize the fork in the road we've come to.
[14:39.140 --> 14:41.140]  I think we've taken the right way here.
[14:41.140 --> 14:45.140]  We're just starting to go down it, but we can look back and still kind of go back and go down the wrong way.
[14:45.140 --> 14:47.140]  But we're going down the right path now.
[14:47.140 --> 14:48.140]  We're starting to change the direction.
[14:48.140 --> 14:50.140]  We're turning that big ship around.
[14:50.140 --> 14:52.140]  All the cliches are true.
[14:52.140 --> 14:55.140]  You can feel it, the enemy sees it, they're freaking out.
[14:55.140 --> 14:58.140]  And so we don't need to just say that we support people's free speech.
[14:58.140 --> 15:03.140]  We need to actively engage in it and let Google and Facebook and Twitter
[15:03.140 --> 15:08.140]  and all the people trying to help China censor know that we're not submitting to them
[15:08.140 --> 15:14.140]  because, you know, they started with me 14 months ago, built up a huge ad campaign,
[15:14.140 --> 15:20.140]  more criticism of me in the last three years than China has been criticized in the news in a decade.
[15:20.140 --> 15:22.140]  Literally, there's almost never any criticism.
[15:22.140 --> 15:26.140]  I'm criticized every day, sometimes in thousands of newspapers at one time,
[15:26.140 --> 15:28.140]  every news program lying about me.
[15:28.140 --> 15:31.140]  Why? I'm seen as the Americana virus of liberty.
[15:31.140 --> 15:35.140]  They call me a virus on CNN that could replicate and defeat them
[15:35.140 --> 15:39.140]  because when I'm promoting works, it sells, it's popular, it's historical.
[15:39.140 --> 15:44.140]  So they built up that straw man to then get people to accept this show being silenced.
[15:44.140 --> 15:46.140]  We weren't silenced. We didn't roll over and die.
[15:46.140 --> 15:50.140]  I'm just supposed to believe that when they said it like it's a magic trick.
[15:50.140 --> 15:53.140]  Nope, didn't work. Return to sender as Elvis would say.
[15:53.140 --> 15:55.140]  And now it's going to be everybody.
[15:55.140 --> 15:57.140]  It's going to be you. We've got to say no.
[15:57.140 --> 16:00.140]  We're all Alex Jones now, like we're all Spartacus.
[16:00.140 --> 16:03.140]  We're all Donald Trump now. We're all Matt Grudge now.
[16:03.140 --> 16:05.140]  And we're not backing down. We're not giving in.
[16:05.140 --> 16:07.140]  And we're saying no to the chai comms.
[16:07.140 --> 16:09.140]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[16:09.140 --> 16:13.140]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:13.140 --> 16:17.140]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:17.140 --> 16:23.140]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:23.140 --> 16:24.140]  I can help you too.
[16:24.140 --> 16:27.140]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay. Don't wait another day.
[16:27.140 --> 16:29.140]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:29.140 --> 16:37.140]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:37.140 --> 16:40.140]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:40.140 --> 16:46.140]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[16:46.140 --> 16:49.140]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[16:49.140 --> 16:54.140]  Bill Hyde, I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[16:54.140 --> 16:58.140]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[16:58.140 --> 17:03.140]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:03.140 --> 17:09.140]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[17:09.140 --> 17:15.140]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:15.140 --> 17:17.140]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:17.140 --> 17:21.140]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:21.140 --> 17:23.140]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:23.140 --> 17:27.140]  Over a thousand dollars in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:27.140 --> 17:31.140]  In the best part, you're not going to pay 750 or 500 dollars, 300 or even 200.
[17:31.140 --> 17:34.140]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[17:34.140 --> 17:58.140]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[18:04.140 --> 18:15.140]  We are working with Silicon Valley to make up a head or tail.
[18:15.140 --> 18:24.140]  Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[18:24.140 --> 18:29.140]  Whatever you do, do not visit band.video.
[18:29.140 --> 18:40.140]  Band.video is evil Americans who Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up like China do.
[18:40.140 --> 18:44.140]  Hey, I told you don't go to band.video.
[18:44.140 --> 18:46.140]  I'm watching you.
[18:46.140 --> 18:49.140]  Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[18:49.140 --> 18:55.140]  Soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[18:55.140 --> 18:59.140]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[18:59.140 --> 19:08.140]  Do what CNN says and do not visit band.video or I have to hurt you.
[19:08.140 --> 19:12.140]  There's a reason we were de-platformed 14 months ago.
[19:12.140 --> 19:18.140]  And it's because Info Wars has been over the target with something like a 98% accuracy rate.
[19:18.140 --> 19:23.140]  We have laid out everything that's going on and folks are really paying attention now.
[19:23.140 --> 19:27.140]  That means now is the time to support the Info War more than ever.
[19:27.140 --> 19:30.140]  And we're going to take this thing over the top together.
[19:30.140 --> 19:34.140]  Everything must go super sale, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:34.140 --> 19:39.140]  This sale on some items on the site is the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[19:39.140 --> 19:43.140]  40 to 70% off, store-wide.
[19:43.140 --> 19:51.140]  Many of these are at cost or below because we're offering free shipping on every order and double Patriot points.
[19:51.140 --> 19:58.140]  Take advantage of the everything must go sale and the funds that come in allow us to fund ourselves in the next year
[19:58.140 --> 20:03.140]  and order new product for next year at infowarstore.com.
[20:03.140 --> 20:21.140]  That's infowarstore.com and thank you for your support.
[20:21.140 --> 20:36.140]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[20:36.140 --> 20:38.140]  I looked at my records this morning.
[20:38.140 --> 20:47.140]  It was 16 months ago and five days that the third law firm I had engaged, the others did a good job too.
[20:47.140 --> 20:56.140]  I was hiring different ones to hit different perspectives that I know is able to lobby directly the president on policy.
[20:56.140 --> 20:59.140]  Not classic lobbyists for money, but lobby the president.
[20:59.140 --> 21:08.140]  I had wrote a report up on communist China's dealings with Apple and with Google moving their main systems and code keys over there
[21:08.140 --> 21:14.140]  to every Apple and basically Google user on the planet and how big a deal that was.
[21:14.140 --> 21:24.140]  And in the letter, we also as a three page letter broke down with links in it to where the communist Chinese were buying up our media
[21:24.140 --> 21:30.140]  where the communist Chinese were financing anti-Trump programs on Netflix.
[21:30.140 --> 21:45.140]  And of course, what Trump already knew that communist China was openly working on a whole host of issues to block the US military from even having parity
[21:45.140 --> 21:48.140]  with the communist Chinese when it comes to artificial intelligence.
[21:48.140 --> 21:53.140]  Then of course, their own censorship search engine that itself was already set up years ago.
[21:53.140 --> 21:55.140]  So it's a red herring dragonfly as well.
[21:55.140 --> 21:58.140]  Well, Tim Cook got word of that.
[21:58.140 --> 22:03.140]  And again, my dad, I filled him in on this.
[22:03.140 --> 22:04.140]  He said, this is very dangerous.
[22:04.140 --> 22:05.140]  Why are you pushing?
[22:05.140 --> 22:07.140]  And I just said, somebody's got to do it.
[22:07.140 --> 22:09.140]  Everybody's scared in Washington.
[22:09.140 --> 22:14.140]  So we got a lot of reports to him on censorship on China on how to take action on any trust.
[22:14.140 --> 22:18.140]  And I know Trump already knows all this, but his advisors are all too scared to bring it to him.
[22:18.140 --> 22:24.140]  And then I had a bunch of the other sub advisors and people in his campaign who I do know take action.
[22:24.140 --> 22:27.140]  Notice the campaign's fighting back against the fake impeachment.
[22:27.140 --> 22:30.140]  The White House really isn't even doing it because they're paralyzed.
[22:30.140 --> 22:31.140]  They're scared.
[22:31.140 --> 22:32.140]  They're in a swamp.
[22:32.140 --> 22:35.140]  And so I picked a fight directly with Tim Cook.
[22:35.140 --> 22:41.140]  And I said to my dad, I said, I believe they're either going to take me completely off the Internet or try to set me up and put me in
[22:41.140 --> 22:44.140]  prison or kill me in the next two to three months.
[22:44.140 --> 22:47.140]  And they did try to set me up and put me in prison.
[22:47.140 --> 22:49.140]  The FBI has asked me not to talk about it on air.
[22:49.140 --> 22:50.140]  So I won't.
[22:50.140 --> 22:52.140]  And it's an ongoing investigation.
[22:52.140 --> 22:56.140]  And they also did obviously try to take us off air.
[22:56.140 --> 22:57.140]  And they did all that.
[22:57.140 --> 22:59.140]  And they did the mass banning.
[22:59.140 --> 23:01.140]  But Tim Cook took the bait beautifully.
[23:01.140 --> 23:02.140]  Thank you, Timmy.
[23:02.140 --> 23:04.140]  Whatever you're on must have scrambled your little brain.
[23:04.140 --> 23:14.140]  When you're over there sucking on the chai com fetted poisonous state run system.
[23:14.140 --> 23:15.140]  And I'm not tuning my horn here.
[23:15.140 --> 23:17.140]  I'm just talking about what leadership is.
[23:17.140 --> 23:18.140]  It's knowing you've got the facts.
[23:18.140 --> 23:19.140]  You've got the evidence.
[23:19.140 --> 23:22.140]  They're criminals, but no one will call them out.
[23:22.140 --> 23:23.140]  Koto is not that powerful.
[23:23.140 --> 23:25.140]  He's willing to pull the curtain back.
[23:25.140 --> 23:26.140]  The emperor's new clothes.
[23:26.140 --> 23:27.140]  The emperor's naked.
[23:27.140 --> 23:29.140]  Only a two year old will say, hey, the king's naked.
[23:29.140 --> 23:32.140]  So that's, that's my job is to hit the barbed wire here.
[23:32.140 --> 23:36.140]  And your job is supporting us to make sure we've got the energy to climb over the barbed
[23:36.140 --> 23:38.140]  wire and to get the articles and videos out.
[23:38.140 --> 23:43.140]  I'm going to play a real clear politics article from August of last year, 14, 15 months ago
[23:43.140 --> 23:46.140]  when this all happened, where I put out the emergency call.
[23:46.140 --> 23:49.140]  Instead of whining and complaining when they took me off air, I said, wow, this is great.
[23:49.140 --> 23:51.140]  I'm the number one news item right now.
[23:51.140 --> 23:56.140]  I'm going to send a direct message to the president to take action on the chai comms.
[23:56.140 --> 24:00.140]  And I'm going to resend all those letters through the law firms hand delivered to the president's
[24:00.140 --> 24:01.140]  office.
[24:01.140 --> 24:06.140]  And of course, the chief of staff flipped out over the law stuff went on.
[24:06.140 --> 24:11.140]  I got some big death threats at a very well known CIA individual that's overthrown governments
[24:11.140 --> 24:12.140]  basically call up and threaten me.
[24:12.140 --> 24:13.140]  And I just said, fill your hand.
[24:13.140 --> 24:14.140]  Do whatever you're going to do.
[24:14.140 --> 24:16.140]  You don't think I don't know you kill people?
[24:16.140 --> 24:20.140]  The only power I have in front of everybody in God is that I'm willing to go all the way.
[24:20.140 --> 24:22.140]  I don't want to die, but I'm committed.
[24:22.140 --> 24:25.140]  And I'm trying to show you the power you have as well to take action.
[24:25.140 --> 24:27.140]  But we built this platform.
[24:27.140 --> 24:28.140]  We were patient.
[24:28.140 --> 24:29.140]  We knew this was coming.
[24:29.140 --> 24:33.140]  And now we're delivering in royal flush because God did this.
[24:33.140 --> 24:34.140]  Providence did this.
[24:34.140 --> 24:35.140]  Not Alex Jones.
[24:35.140 --> 24:36.140]  Not even you the audience.
[24:36.140 --> 24:38.140]  God moved all of us to do this.
[24:38.140 --> 24:40.140]  And that's why they're so scared.
[24:40.140 --> 24:42.140]  But I really, it was pressed on me.
[24:42.140 --> 24:43.140]  I've been praying a lot.
[24:43.140 --> 24:45.140]  And I woke up the last few nights, the middle of the night.
[24:45.140 --> 24:49.140]  And it was the message was literally from God, my subconscious, whatever you want to call it.
[24:49.140 --> 24:54.140]  Alex, you've got to talk about the fact that you are the leadership, that the audience is the leadership
[24:54.140 --> 24:59.140]  and that we really are the remnant of Americana from which the whole system can come back.
[24:59.140 --> 25:03.140]  And you've got to declare that leadership because the enemy already knows it and has already admitted it.
[25:03.140 --> 25:08.140]  I mean, they have CIA reports coming out by the left saying Jones and M4 Wars beat us.
[25:08.140 --> 25:09.140]  Here's how we stop him.
[25:09.140 --> 25:12.140]  So I have to let the audience know this isn't a game.
[25:12.140 --> 25:16.140]  Now, here's a report that was put out last year, one month after I got banned.
[25:16.140 --> 25:20.140]  This is about 13 months ago and it breaks down why they banned Alex Jones.
[25:20.140 --> 25:22.140]  And now it's timeless today.
[25:22.140 --> 25:51.140]  It's evergreen. Here it is.
[25:52.140 --> 26:21.140]  Here's a report that was put out last year.
[26:21.140 --> 26:30.140]  This is a tie-traded dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[26:30.140 --> 26:34.140]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[26:34.140 --> 26:38.140]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[26:38.140 --> 26:48.140]  Now, when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[26:48.140 --> 26:53.140]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[26:53.140 --> 27:09.140]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai-Com slash Big Tech-Making Combine emergency situation.
[27:09.140 --> 27:15.140]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[27:15.140 --> 27:25.140]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[27:25.140 --> 27:30.140]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the strawman.
[27:30.140 --> 27:35.140]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[27:35.140 --> 27:43.140]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[27:43.140 --> 27:50.140]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they'd now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[27:50.140 --> 27:56.140]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[27:56.140 --> 28:01.140]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[28:01.140 --> 28:04.140]  I have given you the transmission. Now break free!
[28:04.140 --> 28:17.140]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[28:17.140 --> 28:22.140]  Now there's this report fitting all the dragons. Very timely made, three weeks ago.
[28:22.140 --> 28:24.140]  You are the resistance.
[28:24.140 --> 28:25.140]  Yes.
[28:33.140 --> 28:37.140]  We tell the basketball people what to do and you submit.
[28:44.140 --> 28:50.140]  We are working with Sherlock Kong Valley to make you a herder of children.
[28:50.140 --> 28:58.140]  Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party.

[29:29.140 --> 29:35.140]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.

[30:08.140 --> 30:11.140]  China was already running the United States.
[30:11.140 --> 30:14.140]  You're like, well, China could never take it with the U.S. That's right.
[30:14.140 --> 30:24.140]  As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero warned, a powerful empire can't fall from without before it first falls from within.
[30:24.140 --> 30:28.140]  So yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them.
[30:28.140 --> 30:30.140]  Yes, they're coming for your children.
[30:30.140 --> 30:37.140]  They've already taken your speech almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like infowars.com and band.video.
[30:37.140 --> 30:41.140]  So now you know why I'm so upset. Now you know why I'm so angry.
[30:41.140 --> 30:46.140]  I saw the producers of South Park on TV. They're totally pissing angry.
[30:46.140 --> 30:52.140]  People are like, why are they angry? Because they see all of their freedom, their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[30:52.140 --> 30:56.140]  Are you going to get upset? Well, you're a listener. You obviously are upset.
[30:56.140 --> 31:00.140]  But you've got to ring the alarm everywhere until others, they've got to get upset.
[31:00.140 --> 31:08.140]  And then take action and let Congress, everybody else know that we're not backing down and we're not going to sell America out to the chicoms.
[31:08.140 --> 31:19.140]  Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago and they've been approving almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[31:19.140 --> 31:27.140]  And now they own our debt. Now they own the Democratic Party. Now they've merged with Silicon Valley to censor patriots off the air.
[31:27.140 --> 31:34.140]  Washington Post comes out and says they hope that Gigi Ping, the dictator of China will, quote, destroy Trump. That's a headline.
[31:34.140 --> 31:41.140]  So Info Wars has been the paul revere of this operation. We have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right.
[31:41.140 --> 31:51.140]  And that's why it's more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and their chicom masters by word of mouth and spread the word about Info Wars and check out infowarstore.com.
[31:51.140 --> 32:08.140]  That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded. That's where the tip of the spear is continually being forged is infowarstore.com.
[32:08.140 --> 32:14.140]  China was already running the United States. You're like, well, China could never take over the U.S. That's right.
[32:14.140 --> 32:24.140]  As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero warned, a powerful empire can't fall from without before it first falls from within.
[32:24.140 --> 32:37.140]  So yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them. Yes, they're coming for your children. They've already taken your speech almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like infowars.com and bandod video.
[32:37.140 --> 32:46.140]  So now you know why I'm so upset. Now you know why I'm so angry. I saw the producers of South Park on TV. They're totally pissing angry.
[32:46.140 --> 32:52.140]  People are like, why are they angry? Because they see all of their freedom, their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[32:52.140 --> 33:00.140]  Are you going to get upset? Well, you're a listener. You obviously are upset. But you've got to ring the alarm everywhere until others, they've got to get upset.
[33:00.140 --> 33:07.140]  And then take action and let Congress, everybody else know that we're not backing down and we're not going to sell America out to the chicongs.
[33:30.140 --> 33:36.140]  Now, it's so evil and so possessed that they are having nightmares. They're freaking out.
[33:36.140 --> 34:00.140]  Let me say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur. Whiskey bottles and brand new cars, oak tree in my way. There's too much coke and too much smoke. Look what's going on inside you.
[34:00.140 --> 34:06.140]  I have two words for you. Can't you smell that smell? Let it go.
[34:06.140 --> 34:33.140]  Did you say you saw? Just died. There's a guy on the radio. He said he and Hillary are demons. It's Gredweed, smell like sulfur. Amen, son.
[34:33.140 --> 34:34.140]  I'm going to kill you!
[34:34.140 --> 34:35.140]  I'm going to kill you!
[34:35.140 --> 34:38.140]  I'm going to kill you!
[34:38.140 --> 34:43.140]  I'm going to kill you!
[34:43.140 --> 34:49.140]  I'm going to kill you!
[34:49.140 --> 34:54.140]  Defending the Republic from enemies, born and domestic.
[34:54.140 --> 35:02.140]  It's Alex Jones.
[35:02.140 --> 35:29.740]  There's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[35:29.740 --> 35:37.140]  Hillary Clinton is all about you not having a memory.
[35:37.140 --> 35:43.660]  In fact, there is a operative for the Atlantic Council that's the private leftist CIA arm
[35:43.660 --> 35:48.180]  that is making them rounds talking about how I need to be taken off the air completely
[35:48.180 --> 35:51.700]  and how we've beaten them in the information war.
[35:51.700 --> 35:57.260]  And then he inverts reality, we're going to play the clip next segment and says that the
[35:57.260 --> 36:02.620]  public is dumb and doesn't know the truth and so in full wars is able to manipulate
[36:02.620 --> 36:03.620]  them.
[36:03.620 --> 36:09.500]  But of course he's talking about you from his perspective like Gruber, another former
[36:09.500 --> 36:12.580]  Obama administration official that worked with the gentleman will be telling you about
[36:12.580 --> 36:20.300]  next segment who said thank God you're so effing stupid and thank God you don't have a memory
[36:20.300 --> 36:22.860]  and thank God you're politically illiterate.
[36:22.860 --> 36:29.420]  Well maybe Democrat constituents, but the truth is with fake polls and election fraud
[36:29.420 --> 36:31.620]  the Democrats have stayed in control of their cities.
[36:31.620 --> 36:38.140]  Can we pull up a map of red versus blue, a national map, there's a meme out there of
[36:38.140 --> 36:43.180]  impeach this that everybody's been putting out, I think it's on Washington's Twitter
[36:43.180 --> 36:46.580]  and it was out last week and it just shows the whole red country with a few little blue
[36:46.580 --> 36:52.740]  spots, I've been in those areas a lot at the highest and lowest levels of society and
[36:52.740 --> 36:57.260]  almost everyone secretly supports libertarianism.
[36:57.260 --> 37:07.420]  I mean it's not just Kurt Russell and people like the Living Rowdy Yates and people like
[37:07.420 --> 37:17.300]  John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, folks like Bruce Willis that are patriots, it's really almost
[37:17.300 --> 37:21.140]  everybody and I'm not at liberty to get into it or talk about it because I'm not starstruck
[37:21.140 --> 37:25.500]  by people just because they're in movies, though I did watch Tombstone again last night
[37:25.500 --> 37:32.300]  with my wife and I'm not gay, I'm not into guys, but it's kind of like that time, kind
[37:32.300 --> 37:39.580]  of like that time the famous basketball player was on one of the late night comedy shows,
[37:39.580 --> 37:43.980]  he's like have you seen Kevin Brady up close, I'm not gay but that's a good looking man,
[37:43.980 --> 37:47.820]  why he walked up and talked to me and I could hardly talk, I'm being sarcastic, but I mean
[37:47.820 --> 37:51.500]  Kurt Russell did a great job in that movie and it's just cool to know that he's a listener,
[37:51.500 --> 37:58.540]  to know he's a patriot and that's fun stuff and Charlton Heston was a patriot and liked
[37:58.540 --> 38:03.660]  the show and I'm not tooting my horn, it's just we're all fellow travelers, isn't it
[38:03.660 --> 38:11.420]  cool that like anybody I end up liking in Hollywood it turns out's a patriot and almost
[38:11.420 --> 38:17.100]  everyone else is just unwatchable, but most of those people have to keep their heads down,
[38:17.100 --> 38:22.260]  and it'd be quiet because you think the communist Chinese censorship just started, for really
[38:22.260 --> 38:27.660]  20 years they've been vetoing movies and been a big player, for 10 they've been the
[38:27.660 --> 38:38.780]  majority player and now they're super, super, super dominant and the globalists are working
[38:38.780 --> 38:44.740]  with them to have China as an outside state exert the censorship, in fact last night I
[38:44.740 --> 38:49.580]  did a bunch of research and I pulled up a whole big stack of articles that I'm going
[38:49.580 --> 38:53.700]  to go over next hour when Robert Barnes joins us to talk about this constitutional lawyer
[38:53.700 --> 39:05.780]  all around smart historian that all of this mainstream media from the Wall Street Journal
[39:05.780 --> 39:17.980]  to AOL News to PBS came out and praised Xi Jinping censoring China and then Xi Jinping
[39:17.980 --> 39:25.940]  the dictator, he's a dictator, never ran for office, didn't run for dog catcher, Xi Jinping
[39:25.940 --> 39:33.620]  dictator for life praised the quote crackdown on fake news and election meddling that got
[39:33.620 --> 39:39.900]  Trump elected, when China is totally election meddling, totally laundering money, over 10,000
[39:39.900 --> 39:47.460]  front companies into the US, just use the trillion pound gorilla on our back, forget
[39:47.460 --> 39:57.780]  a monkey on our back and to just see those articles with my name in them and Xi Jinping
[39:57.780 --> 40:08.180]  praising mind be taken off the air, info wars being removed, that's crazy and I was rereading
[40:08.180 --> 40:12.380]  that stuff from like a year ago and it was like surreal, I'm like okay maybe this is
[40:12.380 --> 40:17.580]  like total recall and this is like a simulation and I've gone in and plugged my brain in and
[40:17.580 --> 40:21.340]  I'm some guy in the future playing you know video games and I'm just imagining I'm fighting
[40:21.340 --> 40:26.180]  the globalist, this whole cruise, actually just digital and none of this is real but
[40:26.180 --> 40:31.540]  you know what folks it is real and you're fighting in this whole thing as well but it
[40:31.540 --> 40:38.300]  is surreal to see a dictator that killed at least four or five times what Hitler did,
[40:38.300 --> 40:44.260]  his regime, his government, his communist system, that's just unbelievable and then
[40:44.260 --> 40:50.020]  to see people running around to fall down and worship Xi Jinping and to virtue signal
[40:50.020 --> 40:58.500]  on him and to bend over, this country is in a lot of trouble but I am very honored that
[40:58.500 --> 41:08.260]  my inspiration, my discernment that God gave me led the way for so much of what now is
[41:08.260 --> 41:12.820]  unfolding thanks to dredgerport.com amplifying some of the things that we said and did without
[41:12.820 --> 41:14.820]  dredgerport, it wouldn't have happened without you, it wouldn't have happened, I just want
[41:14.820 --> 41:17.340]  to give you credit words too, kind of like good to give the credit because it will come
[41:17.340 --> 41:20.900]  after people but the enemy already knows who's changing things and who has courage and who
[41:20.900 --> 41:29.380]  doesn't so it's a very exciting time to be alive and people need to decide what side
[41:29.380 --> 41:30.380]  they're on.
[41:30.380 --> 41:36.220]  Now Paul Watson put a tweet out this morning, he and I talked this morning and he put a
[41:36.220 --> 41:43.220]  video out breaking all this down that's now up on infowars.com, communist China says jump,
[41:43.220 --> 41:49.020]  corporate America says how high, woke corporate America, stunning hypocrisy but it's more
[41:49.020 --> 41:56.380]  than hypocrisy, they know that we want liberty and freedom so they manipulate false rights
[41:56.380 --> 42:02.500]  and false liberty to get us to give up our rights to live as we see fit and to control
[42:02.500 --> 42:06.940]  our own destiny, to choose our own destiny, telling us our kids got to take dangerous
[42:06.940 --> 42:10.620]  vaccines, telling us we got to teach kids how to masturbate when they're five years old
[42:10.620 --> 42:14.980]  the state's going to do that, that's about power, telling us they're going to take our
[42:14.980 --> 42:19.060]  guns when we haven't committed crimes.
[42:19.060 --> 42:23.060]  Corporate America helps set up China, the globalists set it up, it's not just that
[42:23.060 --> 42:28.060]  they're making money off of it like South Park says, they see that as a model of slaves
[42:28.060 --> 42:33.420]  they can use to organize beta tests and then deploy it worldwide for the takeover.
[42:33.420 --> 42:37.420]  But Paul's put out a tweet that I'm asking everybody to get out there and retweet and
[42:37.420 --> 42:42.340]  share or rewrite yourself with your own thoughts because this is the maximum, this is throwing
[42:42.340 --> 42:47.020]  down the gauntlet, it's time for Americans to announce every corporation that caves
[42:47.020 --> 42:52.780]  in or refuses to announce China, these corporations trash American values then openly embrace
[42:52.780 --> 42:57.180]  and tower to China's dictatorship for profit, it's clear who their leader is, it's not
[42:57.180 --> 43:08.260]  Trump, it's G.G.P., there's nothing like seeing flames throwing truth, stopping out
[43:08.260 --> 43:09.260]  on the battlefield.
[43:09.260 --> 43:27.220]  A lot of Donald Trump's just like you have and my goodness, yesterday's press conference,
[43:27.220 --> 43:38.420]  it's all at Band.video, it's all at Band.video and I just, you've got to share this with
[43:38.420 --> 43:43.500]  people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders, this was amazing and he turned
[43:43.500 --> 43:48.620]  the nitrous oxide on top of it, so Info Wars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things
[43:48.620 --> 43:55.340]  are happening and we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at Band.video
[43:55.340 --> 43:59.100]  and I got to tell you, we've done great video work, we've done great films, we've done
[43:59.100 --> 44:04.220]  so much but websites are not our thing, well now they are, I'm so proud of Band.video folks,
[44:04.220 --> 44:18.940]  check it out, there's a lot of new features Band.video.
[44:18.940 --> 44:25.220]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.video on your iPhone, simply go to Band.video with
[44:25.220 --> 44:30.140]  your Safari browser, then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen, when the
[44:30.140 --> 44:35.660]  menu comes up you simply click add to home screen, it will then ask you to name the app,
[44:35.660 --> 44:41.900]  I suggest Band.video, you will now have Band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact
[44:41.900 --> 44:45.700]  that Tim Cook tried to stop it, the globalists think you're lazy but by taking a little bit
[44:45.700 --> 44:50.460]  of action you can override them, have the app and then tell others about it so they
[44:50.460 --> 44:54.860]  can get the app, so it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share
[44:54.860 --> 44:59.700]  buttons below, on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want,
[44:59.700 --> 45:09.180]  be sure and share Band.video.
[45:09.180 --> 45:13.420]  Now is the critical time to keep him full wars on the air, everything we've warned
[45:13.420 --> 45:19.140]  of is now being exposed and is out in the open, want to be clear, it's not coming true,
[45:19.140 --> 45:24.840]  it was already true, I didn't predict all this, it was already going on, now the globalists
[45:24.840 --> 45:30.060]  are making their move with the chai comms, so it's naked, it's brazen, this is the point
[45:30.060 --> 45:35.180]  when the enemy emerges, it's like before World War II the Poles kept warning that Nazi Germany
[45:35.180 --> 45:39.380]  was going to attack them, nobody believed them as they saw the troops massing until
[45:39.380 --> 45:44.740]  it finally happened, we're at that same point and we're all Paul Revere's who need to be
[45:44.740 --> 45:49.740]  out there warning everyone about what's unfolding because this is the critical fight and thank
[45:49.740 --> 45:56.060]  God America and the world is waking up at the 11th hour 58 minute, but will it be too
[45:56.060 --> 46:01.300]  little too late, that's up to you, this battle's hot, it's real, so spread the word and support
[46:01.300 --> 46:30.300]  info worst of day at infoorstore.com but whatever you do, spread the word about the live transmission.
[46:30.300 --> 46:35.380]  Trump got that and all these other populists get it, why would you throw away wealthy successful
[46:35.380 --> 46:40.020]  countries and cultures just so you can say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller
[46:40.020 --> 46:46.500]  put in power are better than everybody, that is a sick freakish joke and I will not stand
[46:46.500 --> 46:52.100]  by and watch humanity turn over to these people and I beg God for the strength and the will
[46:52.100 --> 46:56.660]  to have the discernment to help me part of their defeat and I've been saying that prayer
[46:56.660 --> 47:02.420]  for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great, thank God for his son Jesus
[47:02.420 --> 47:28.380]  Christ and now let's move forward against the N.W.O.
[47:28.380 --> 47:36.180]  United.
[47:36.180 --> 47:43.860]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, live from the info wars.com
[47:43.860 --> 47:56.980]  studios, it's Alex Jones, info wars, that dog will hunt, all thanks to you, you're amazing,
[47:56.980 --> 48:02.460]  everything you've done and the globalists thought we'd be off the air by now but we're
[48:02.460 --> 48:09.260]  still on the air because of you and in some ways more influential than ever.
[48:09.260 --> 48:14.900]  You know, they try to block our super viral videos out there but it's the hardcore people
[48:14.900 --> 48:20.180]  that are tuning in to info wars.com and that's even stronger and the military and the police
[48:20.180 --> 48:25.340]  not just here but around the world and the White House, you listen to those speeches,
[48:25.340 --> 48:29.580]  Stephen Miller's writing, you listen to what other leaders around the world are saying,
[48:29.580 --> 48:35.780]  it's word for word what we're laying out because everybody knows you go to the oracle
[48:35.780 --> 48:42.180]  at Delphi in Greece and there's just a bunch of poison gas coming out of the ground and
[48:42.180 --> 48:46.420]  so people start hallucinating and thinking they're talking to God, no ladies and gentlemen,
[48:46.420 --> 48:52.900]  this isn't an oracle, this is research and focus and studying the CFR and studying the
[48:52.900 --> 48:59.500]  globalist and then putting that template out over the world which is the real template
[48:59.500 --> 49:02.740]  so that people understand why the globalists are doing what they're doing.
[49:02.740 --> 49:07.380]  Now, the globalists aren't in full control and their template isn't complete but it's
[49:07.380 --> 49:13.220]  the template from which they are taking action but I don't want you to think they're in full
[49:13.220 --> 49:15.900]  control and they're history's actors.
[49:15.900 --> 49:22.020]  If you take action as a leader and simply call them out and don't bow to their bullying
[49:22.020 --> 49:28.980]  and promote countervailing ideas like not killing babies after they're born, like having
[49:28.980 --> 49:36.060]  vaccines, not have immunity with the history of secret testing, like glyphosate gives your
[49:36.060 --> 49:39.620]  breast cancer so it should be banned.
[49:39.620 --> 49:43.500]  Things like that, just everything we do here is common sense.
[49:43.500 --> 49:47.580]  You know year after year for the last 40 years or so, I have studies right here, mainline
[49:47.580 --> 49:53.380]  news, the flu gets worse every year, well of course it does, all the studies say when
[49:53.380 --> 50:00.420]  you take a flu shot it lowers your immunity to other flus by 50%, three flu shots consecutively
[50:00.420 --> 50:08.340]  over three years is known to trigger Alzheimer's and dementia in people above the age of 65.
[50:08.340 --> 50:09.340]  Don't believe me?
[50:09.340 --> 50:10.340]  Go look it all up.
[50:10.340 --> 50:11.340]  That's what's so frustrating.
[50:11.340 --> 50:19.860]  Go and now this year will be the most deadly ever and then two Fox Sports hosts go, yeah,
[50:19.860 --> 50:27.220]  we both took the flu shot last year when they pushed it on us, they're almost killed us.
[50:27.220 --> 50:29.860]  They talked about on the radio, they go on TV and say, I'm not taking a flu shot, what
[50:29.860 --> 50:30.860]  about you?
[50:30.860 --> 50:32.940]  No, everybody I know that takes it gets it.
[50:32.940 --> 50:34.180]  I'm never taking it again.
[50:34.180 --> 50:37.020]  Ooh, they need to be fired.
[50:37.020 --> 50:41.580]  Those dirty Americans open their fat mouths about, yeah, we both took it last year when
[50:41.580 --> 50:43.580]  they pushed it on us.
[50:43.580 --> 50:44.580]  We got sick.
[50:44.580 --> 50:50.620]  Remember a year ago, that big push, the Academy Awards everywhere else, was it really taken
[50:50.620 --> 50:51.620]  the Academy Awards.
[50:51.620 --> 50:56.780]  So man, I've got just incredible, I mean Kanye West came out and said there's a bunch of
[50:56.780 --> 51:00.800]  brainwashing, a bunch of intimidation, they're turning us into zombies, we've got a breakthrough
[51:00.800 --> 51:06.500]  from the Matrix, incredibly powerful yesterday's article, I never even covered it.
[51:06.500 --> 51:10.700]  It was linked on Drouchreport.com.
[51:10.700 --> 51:13.940]  There's hundreds of big things we're not getting to right now and I'm really mad at
[51:13.940 --> 51:17.980]  myself for not doing it, but I got to tell you, the fake impeachment, they are going
[51:17.980 --> 51:20.900]  for it though, but the reasons are fake.
[51:20.900 --> 51:30.020]  The war happening in Syria is huge and what's happening behind those scenes and the chai
[51:30.020 --> 51:35.940]  comms flexing and to watch the abject groveling like lemmings going off a cliff, it's been
[51:35.940 --> 51:39.860]  incredible, but to see the backlash has been gorgeous.
[51:39.860 --> 51:45.660]  And then Hillary said she was going to run two years ago again, everybody flipped out,
[51:45.660 --> 51:49.820]  the Democrats said don't do it, you're unpopular, give us a chance, but she kept campaigning,
[51:49.820 --> 51:53.420]  she kept raising the money, she kept running on the show and then I got approached by people
[51:53.420 --> 51:56.980]  that were protecting her and they said no, she's running the show, she's running for
[51:56.980 --> 52:07.540]  sure, I'm going to play that clip from PBS in a moment and I'll play real clear politics
[52:07.540 --> 52:12.540]  and I told people that like oh Jones, fake news, yeah he said Epstein was running kidnap
[52:12.540 --> 52:18.340]  kids and stuff 12 years ago, all true, yeah he said they're GEO engineering, but now it's
[52:18.340 --> 52:22.820]  all declassified, Kim trailing, yeah he said, he said there's a world government, he said
[52:22.820 --> 52:27.860]  Obama was behind Al Qaeda and ISIS, it's all out in the open now.
[52:27.860 --> 52:32.140]  Every major topic we hit because it's already out there, human animal hybrids, that was
[52:32.140 --> 52:38.820]  in MIT research 23 years ago, I was on air, listeners would mail me stuff because they
[52:38.820 --> 52:44.020]  never saw it on the news, but it was in white papers, so they would get me to cover it.
[52:44.020 --> 52:48.060]  And listeners would go oh he's crazy, I'd have people coming to me in grocery stores
[52:48.060 --> 52:53.740]  and stuff and go, pizza places, you're lying there's no human animal hybrids, I had a guy
[52:53.740 --> 53:03.940]  that had Conan's pizza, push me, he'll actually push me, he was obviously drunk and he goes
[53:03.940 --> 53:09.540]  I went to UT at biology degree, there's no such thing as animal human hybrids, you liar.
[53:09.540 --> 53:15.460]  And I said how long did you go to UT, I had 1979, I graduated, I said get out of my face
[53:15.460 --> 53:20.620]  before I kick your ass, I was like yeah, this isn't a simulation, I said put your hands
[53:20.620 --> 53:24.140]  on me again, I'm going to break your neck, and it's not that I'm a tough guy, that's
[53:24.140 --> 53:30.060]  what happened though, because he pushed me, I'm at the counter, he pushes me, and I let
[53:30.060 --> 53:31.060]  him do that.
[53:31.060 --> 53:34.860]  I turned around and I said you're an idiot, I'm about to beat your ass, I said I'm about
[53:34.860 --> 53:41.660]  to break your neck, which I shouldn't have done, but the point is that there's a bunch
[53:41.660 --> 53:45.740]  of ignorant people that live in La La Land, and they're scared by those of us that actually
[53:45.740 --> 53:46.740]  research things.
[53:46.740 --> 53:50.940]  You know they're experts on baseball or football, that's fine, they know what size jockstrap
[53:50.940 --> 53:58.340]  somebody wears, I don't know what size jockstrap they're wearing, I know ladies and gentlemen
[53:58.340 --> 54:04.060]  that we're on the planet with wonder and incredible stuff all around us, and we've got a lot of
[54:04.060 --> 54:08.140]  evil people that crave power who believe they have a right to rule us, and Hillary Clinton
[54:08.140 --> 54:18.140]  has climbed out of the sewer line, like Mr. Hankey, or hit the clown, and she needs to
[54:18.140 --> 54:22.260]  go back down the sewer line, and when you see her now, my wife was watching her last
[54:22.260 --> 54:27.340]  night on Colbert from a week ago, she said man she does look like a demonic jack-o-lantern,
[54:27.340 --> 54:32.420]  and I mean I can't even make the face that she makes, she looks scarier than Jack Nicholson
[54:32.420 --> 54:33.420]  when he's trying to be scary.
[54:33.420 --> 54:40.380]  I mean she's a frickin' demon man, and she does stink, and she doesn't care, she likes
[54:40.380 --> 54:45.660]  to smell, Mousey Tongue didn't bathe, and her daughter from Webster Hubble, you know just
[54:45.660 --> 54:47.300]  the vampires.
[54:47.300 --> 54:51.340]  So you know here's Hillary, oh she really won, she says that's a lie, she says you know
[54:51.340 --> 54:55.340]  that nobody, she's fully investigated, you have by your own people, Comey, and others,
[54:55.340 --> 55:01.380]  Tarmac meetings with the Attorney General, and just all that garbage ladies and gentlemen,
[55:01.380 --> 55:04.340]  she says coming out of her mouth's a lie, here it is, and there was a congressional
[55:04.340 --> 55:08.540]  subpoena she ignored, just everything that was out of her stinking mouth is a lie, here's
[55:08.540 --> 55:10.260]  Pumpkin Head.
[55:10.260 --> 55:15.340]  I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should try to enter the race to try and steal it
[55:15.340 --> 55:22.300]  away from Uber left Elizabeth Warren, only one condition, the Crooked one, must explain
[55:22.300 --> 55:27.940]  all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how and why, she deleted 33,000 emails.
[55:27.940 --> 55:35.060]  Yeah, you know it truly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me, but this latest
[55:35.060 --> 55:44.180]  tweet is so typical of him, nothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails,
[55:44.180 --> 55:48.980]  we all know that, so he's either lying or delusional or both, there was no subpoena
[55:48.980 --> 55:54.940]  as he says in a tweet this morning, so maybe there does need to be a rematch, I mean obviously
[55:54.940 --> 56:01.540]  I can beat him again, but there was a subpoena, she destroyed the emails, I mean everything
[56:01.540 --> 56:06.260]  comes out of her mouth is a lie, anyone can verify that in seconds, but they say Trump's
[56:06.260 --> 56:16.300]  the liar and show 100 jars of gumballs, I mean that's just a stunt, Trump's the most
[56:16.300 --> 56:20.780]  truthful president I've ever seen in my lifetime, it's dizzying how they spin everything he's
[56:20.780 --> 56:24.740]  a liar, and I'm persecuted for supporting Trump, I don't just get up here because paychecks
[56:24.740 --> 56:30.300]  are coming from Trump, I support Trump because, compared to Hillary Clinton, he's the second
[56:30.300 --> 56:35.740]  coming, I mean she's the second coming of Satan here folks, alright we're gonna go
[56:35.740 --> 56:39.060]  to break, I'll get to the real clear politics, we've got Barnes coming on, I want to open
[56:39.060 --> 56:44.500]  the phones up today as well, it's all coming up today, second hour, please tell folks to
[56:44.500 --> 56:50.300]  tune in, band on video, local radio stations, TV stations, M4s.com, let's show your power
[56:50.300 --> 56:55.940]  to unleash us, he's paramount, in fact I'm in your hands, and also we had to end the
[56:55.940 --> 57:00.740]  50% off store wide on the storeable foods and stuff like that, and a lot of the items,
[57:00.740 --> 57:05.180]  but we've brought in and everything must go sale, because things are so crazy, I'm not
[57:05.180 --> 57:08.540]  gonna sit on any of our inventory, we have a lot of new things that come back into stock
[57:08.540 --> 57:13.300]  around Christmas, right before Christmas, but a lot of things aren't coming back in until
[57:13.300 --> 57:16.380]  two, three, four months in the next year, because you gotta, they gotta go wild sourced
[57:16.380 --> 57:20.340]  that you gotta have the order in, it's gotta be ready, it's gotta be produced, and it comes
[57:20.340 --> 57:24.860]  to you, that's just gut level, I've decided to sell everything out, and we're selling
[57:24.860 --> 57:31.420]  at 40 to 70% off, even hot best sellers, some of these are at cost, and I've just decided
[57:31.420 --> 57:35.540]  to move everything out so that we have cash in our operations, no matter what happens
[57:35.540 --> 57:39.100]  to continue battling forward, probably six months into next year, we can go further
[57:39.100 --> 57:46.300]  than that, but I am transferring everything into liquid fuel for major launch operations,
[57:46.300 --> 57:51.220]  I'm following my gut, so this sale probably on many items is the biggest ever, and it's
[57:51.220 --> 57:58.020]  the M4s, everything must go, total super supreme mega sale, M4store.com.
[57:58.020 --> 58:04.820]  The truth is President Trump is the most investigated president in history, he is working for American
[58:04.820 --> 58:09.940]  interest steadfastly, he is trying to preserve our country, as the globalists try to break
[58:09.940 --> 58:15.500]  our borders, bankrupt, and devalue our dollar, and sign us over to communist Chinese control
[58:15.500 --> 58:18.380]  who now own Hollywood, and the majority of our debt.
[58:18.380 --> 58:24.100]  We have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy, but at the 11th hour 58th minute,
[58:24.100 --> 58:28.780]  the American people put a populist in power, and it's happening all over the world, so
[58:28.780 --> 58:33.860]  great things are happening, but the enemy is striking back, they're very serious with
[58:33.860 --> 58:38.580]  this impeachment plan, it has bipartisan support, and I'm telling you President Trump needs
[58:38.580 --> 58:43.860]  our prayers, and info wars needs your prayers and support, ladies and gentlemen the globalists
[58:43.860 --> 58:47.620]  are trying to shut us down, but right now it's easier than ever to financially support
[58:47.620 --> 58:52.060]  us while getting great products at the same time with Black Friday comes two months early
[58:52.060 --> 58:58.900]  with store wide free shipping, double patriot points, and ladies and gentlemen 50% off.
[58:58.900 --> 59:05.340]  My phone has been ringing off the hook, constitutional lawyers, national talk show host, prominent
[59:05.340 --> 59:09.580]  guests I've had on over the years, and they're all saying Alex it's incredible, you've been
[59:09.580 --> 59:14.620]  obsessing on China since you got on air 20 something years ago, and now it's all coming
[59:14.620 --> 59:16.380]  through, how did you know it?
[59:16.380 --> 59:20.140]  Because the council on farm relations is the shadow government, and they admitted the plan
[59:20.140 --> 59:26.660]  to transfer all power to communist China, and almost everyone calling me says, yeah,
[59:26.660 --> 59:30.860]  and they banned you because you were saying all that and how Silicon Valley, Google and
[59:30.860 --> 59:34.900]  Apple moved over there, and it's incredible, and wow you're vindicated, you're going to
[59:34.900 --> 59:40.220]  get back on the air now aren't you, and no, if we don't defeat this takeover you're all
[59:40.220 --> 59:43.780]  going to be taken off, in fact you're all going to end up getting put in prison camps,
[59:43.780 --> 59:47.940]  they're making their move, they're coming for your guns, they're coming for your kids,
[59:47.940 --> 59:51.740]  they're coming for your right to religion, they are coming for your soul.
[59:51.740 --> 59:56.620]  Well you know what they say, you got to lower your ideals of freedom if you want to suck
[59:56.620 --> 1:00:01.980]  on the warm teat of China.
[1:00:01.980 --> 1:00:11.980]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:11.980 --> 1:00:16.660]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:36.220]  Welcome to your life, there's no turning back, remember how it was about, nine, ten years
[1:00:36.220 --> 1:00:46.220]  old this song came out, remember sitting there at the local neighborhood pool, look at it,
[1:00:46.220 --> 1:00:52.580]  but yeah, getting serious here, I want to go to Tucker Carlson report ahead of Robert
[1:00:52.580 --> 1:00:59.260]  Barnes joining us, just a huge spectrum of over the top vital news in Intel, what would
[1:00:59.260 --> 1:01:03.420]  America look like if the Democrats won, I think worse than what he's even saying here
[1:01:03.420 --> 1:01:06.780]  because they want to break our will once and forever, they thought we were far gone, here's
[1:01:06.780 --> 1:01:17.900]  his report, possession, expunge the records of those people arrested for possession of
[1:01:17.900 --> 1:01:21.460]  marijuana, decriminalize marijuana, automatically expunge marijuana convictions, legalization
[1:01:21.460 --> 1:01:25.540]  of marijuana but also with an expungent to reverse incarceration is doing more harm than
[1:01:25.540 --> 1:01:34.100]  the original offense, we will expunge the records of those who have already been convicted,
[1:01:34.100 --> 1:01:42.180]  where the great expunging begins, so not just legalizing drugs but legalizing them retroactively,
[1:01:42.180 --> 1:01:45.860]  well that sounds radical, it's nothing compared to what they're planning on doing as soon
[1:01:45.860 --> 1:01:51.540]  as they can, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, you in effect functions as a kind of one woman
[1:01:51.540 --> 1:01:57.180]  think tank for the Democratic Party, air quotes around that, is now demanding the elimination
[1:01:57.180 --> 1:02:03.020]  of prisons on the grounds that they are in, of course you could guess, racist, here's
[1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:07.820]  the quote, mass incarceration is a system whose logic evolved from the same lineage
[1:02:07.820 --> 1:02:14.340]  as Jim Crow, American apartheid and slavery, to end it we have to change, that means we
[1:02:14.340 --> 1:02:20.820]  need a real conversation about decarceration and prison abolition in this country, because
[1:02:20.820 --> 1:02:27.860]  of course there were no prisons before, racists in America thought them up, so with no more
[1:02:27.860 --> 1:02:32.580]  prisons presumably that will mean no more prisoners, right, axiomatic, so with all those
[1:02:32.580 --> 1:02:38.740]  felons back on the street and in your neighborhood, hey felons, you may suddenly be a little
[1:02:38.740 --> 1:02:44.540]  bit concerned about protecting yourself and your family, but tough, in Democratic America
[1:02:44.540 --> 1:02:51.220]  self defense will be banned because they're taking your guns, so to gun owners out there
[1:02:51.220 --> 1:02:56.060]  who say well a fine administration means they're gonna come from my guns, bingo, you're right
[1:02:56.060 --> 1:03:00.980]  if you have an assault weapon, the fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period,
[1:03:00.980 --> 1:03:05.140]  do you believe in the mandatory buyback of quote unquote assault weapons, I do believe
[1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:11.060]  that we need to do buybacks and I'll tell you why, they are weapons of war with no place
[1:03:11.060 --> 1:03:15.660]  on the streets of a civil society, hell yes we're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47, we're
[1:03:15.660 --> 1:03:23.220]  not gonna allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore, that kid is so light
[1:03:23.220 --> 1:03:27.740]  you wonder why he doesn't blow away like an autumn leaf, but whatever, hell yes they're
[1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:33.260]  gonna confiscate your firearms, and by the way that'll make home invasions a little tougher
[1:03:33.260 --> 1:03:37.740]  to deal with, lots of luck with that, let's hope you don't get assaulted and need to go
[1:03:37.740 --> 1:03:44.180]  to a hospital because in Democratic America you might find the hospitals a bit overcrowded,
[1:03:44.180 --> 1:03:49.940]  why, well the left is giving free healthcare to the rest of the planet, you support giving
[1:03:49.940 --> 1:03:53.020]  universal healthcare and Medicare for all to people who are in this country illegally,
[1:03:53.020 --> 1:03:59.820]  let me just be very clear about this, I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our
[1:03:59.820 --> 1:04:07.220]  country any human being from access to public safety, public education or public health
[1:04:07.220 --> 1:04:08.220]  period.
[1:04:08.220 --> 1:04:13.180]  Do you believe that undocumented people should have healthcare in this country?
[1:04:13.180 --> 1:04:18.380]  I think undocumented people need to have a means by which they can be covered when they're
[1:04:18.380 --> 1:04:21.740]  sick, people need, this is just common decency.
[1:04:21.740 --> 1:04:32.540]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
[1:04:32.540 --> 1:04:36.260]  Raise your hand if you don't want a single normal person to even consider voting for
[1:04:36.260 --> 1:04:39.100]  you ever.
[1:04:39.100 --> 1:04:44.940]  Free healthcare for illegal aliens, quite an idea, how's our already broke country going
[1:04:44.940 --> 1:04:49.860]  to pay for that, here's a calculator you've figured out, got a headache yet, yeah, but
[1:04:49.860 --> 1:04:55.380]  don't even think about heading to a bar to drown your sorrows with a cocktail and a steak
[1:04:55.380 --> 1:04:59.300]  in the America of tomorrow, that will be banned too.
[1:04:59.300 --> 1:05:00.860]  Do you ban plastic straws?
[1:05:00.860 --> 1:05:03.220]  I think we should, yes.
[1:05:03.220 --> 1:05:07.340]  But what do you support changing the dietary guidelines, the food?
[1:05:07.340 --> 1:05:11.380]  China was already running the United States, you're like well China could never take it
[1:05:11.380 --> 1:05:18.060]  with the US, that's right, as the Roman historian and senator Cicero warned, a powerful empire
[1:05:18.060 --> 1:05:25.020]  can't fall from without before it first falls from within, so yes they're coming for your
[1:05:25.020 --> 1:05:29.420]  guns, all of them, yes they're coming for your children, they've already taken your
[1:05:29.420 --> 1:05:35.980]  speech almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like infowars.com and bandod video,
[1:05:35.980 --> 1:05:40.980]  so now you know why I'm so upset, now you know why I'm so angry, I saw the producers
[1:05:40.980 --> 1:05:45.740]  of South Park on TV, they're totally pissing angry, people are like why are they angry,
[1:05:45.740 --> 1:05:51.540]  as they see all of their freedom, their American freedom, hard fought, taken away, are you
[1:05:51.540 --> 1:05:55.020]  going to get upset, well you're a listener, you're obviously already upset, but you've
[1:05:55.020 --> 1:05:59.620]  got to ring the alarm everywhere until others, they've got to get upset and then take action
[1:05:59.620 --> 1:06:03.340]  and let Congress, everybody else know that we're not backing down and we're not going
[1:06:03.340 --> 1:06:23.180]  to sell America out to the Chi Cops.
[1:06:23.180 --> 1:06:38.500]  In deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:46.380]  Well the world awakened when the Chi Cops started telling video game tournaments that
[1:06:46.380 --> 1:06:55.980]  they had to fire their star players because they supported Hong Kong freedom protesters.
[1:06:55.980 --> 1:07:01.820]  The NBA began to grovel and apologize so China banned their exhibition games, only to see
[1:07:01.820 --> 1:07:09.660]  the NBA grovel more and then now we learn, the general public learns what we've done
[1:07:09.660 --> 1:07:14.980]  a long time here on this broadcast that China for at least 15 years has basically been controlling
[1:07:14.980 --> 1:07:22.660]  what all the major Hollywood production companies can do because they're not just approving
[1:07:22.660 --> 1:07:23.660]  scripts.
[1:07:23.660 --> 1:07:30.340]  Remember the left always criticized the Pentagon that if you use Pentagon money or you use
[1:07:30.340 --> 1:07:36.060]  Pentagon aircraft carriers or jets in the production that they needed to approve those
[1:07:36.060 --> 1:07:39.500]  parts of the movie it was in.
[1:07:39.500 --> 1:07:44.380]  They weren't going to let you use an aircraft carrier to say the USA sucks or something.
[1:07:44.380 --> 1:07:48.060]  And that's borderline government controlling media, it's dangerous.
[1:07:48.060 --> 1:07:49.060]  And I was critical of it.
[1:07:49.060 --> 1:07:53.940]  I said it's a slippery slope but when China controlling the scripts is a foreign authoritarian
[1:07:53.940 --> 1:07:58.580]  dictatorship that killed over 100 million of its own people and executes gay people
[1:07:58.580 --> 1:08:03.140]  and has 2 million people in concentration camps and has killed millions of Buddhists
[1:08:03.140 --> 1:08:08.460]  and Christians and does sell their organs, that's not debatable.
[1:08:08.460 --> 1:08:14.340]  To have them buying up the major movie production houses, what if the US government was buying
[1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:23.700]  up Universal and Paramount, let's see that's what's happening here.
[1:08:23.700 --> 1:08:26.940]  There are only like two other big production houses they don't own, one of them is American
[1:08:26.940 --> 1:08:27.940]  Bandstand.
[1:08:27.940 --> 1:08:31.500]  But people don't know that's actually a huge production house, it owns hundreds of companies.
[1:08:31.500 --> 1:08:37.140]  Trump stopped that a month into office, he said not national security can't buy it.
[1:08:37.140 --> 1:08:41.620]  So things are really heating up and now US restricts visas for Chinese officials over
[1:08:41.620 --> 1:08:46.500]  a campaign to erase religion in China.
[1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:52.220]  It's an amazing time to be alive and Paul also has put out a tweet that I really am
[1:08:52.220 --> 1:08:55.100]  asking all listeners and all viewers to retweet.
[1:08:55.100 --> 1:08:58.220]  It's at at Prison Planet on Paul's Twitter, I'm asking all our crew that still has Twitter
[1:08:58.220 --> 1:09:00.060]  to get this out.
[1:09:00.060 --> 1:09:04.700]  It's time for Americans to denounce every corporation that caves in or refuses to denounce
[1:09:04.700 --> 1:09:12.340]  common China, these corporations trash American values and openly embrace and cower to China's
[1:09:12.340 --> 1:09:14.700]  dictatorship or profit.
[1:09:14.700 --> 1:09:17.220]  It's clear, very clear who their leader is.
[1:09:17.220 --> 1:09:23.660]  It's not Trump, it's GZPing and Paul's also put another video will air next hour after
[1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:31.300]  William Benny, former head of the National Security Agency, technical head, joins us
[1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:37.300]  to talk about spy gate to Russia gate to all of the news that's breaking everything
[1:09:37.300 --> 1:09:38.300]  that's unfolding.
[1:09:38.300 --> 1:09:42.580]  But I wanted to hit this before we go to Robert Barnes, we're just now getting hooked up
[1:09:42.580 --> 1:09:44.700]  on Skype.
[1:09:44.700 --> 1:09:48.540]  Hillary get ready to run for president, she really never stopped the impeachment.
[1:09:48.540 --> 1:09:52.820]  What's really behind that why they're calling it a impeachment inquiry so they can violate
[1:09:52.820 --> 1:09:55.900]  all the House rules, cut Republicans out and have a kangaroo court.
[1:09:55.900 --> 1:09:59.060]  Why Trump's saying he's not going, Barnes is an expert on that, he'll go through it
[1:09:59.060 --> 1:10:04.820]  all constitutional lawyer, par excellence, who will also open some phones up specifically
[1:10:04.820 --> 1:10:06.340]  on that issue.
[1:10:06.340 --> 1:10:11.860]  But I wanted to show TV viewers and sources for radio listeners, just some articles today.
[1:10:11.860 --> 1:10:18.700]  ESPN caved to China silences host on Hong Kong protests.
[1:10:18.700 --> 1:10:24.820]  So now ESPN is saying that their hosts can't say we deserve free speech.
[1:10:24.820 --> 1:10:30.300]  Now the same guys could attack North Carolina and say we should take football teams and
[1:10:30.300 --> 1:10:33.660]  baseball teams and basketball teams away from them because you know they don't let five-year-olds
[1:10:33.660 --> 1:10:36.460]  get taught how to give blow jobs in school.
[1:10:36.460 --> 1:10:40.460]  I'm not kidding and all that virtue signaling and you know taking a knee and all the rest
[1:10:40.460 --> 1:10:45.700]  of it during the anthem, pissing on America's grave, when a foreign power comes in and says
[1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:51.020]  you shut your people up, they click their heels and say yes sir, Blizzard blasted after
[1:10:51.020 --> 1:10:55.220]  a banning gamer who voiced support for Hong Kong protests.
[1:10:55.220 --> 1:10:59.420]  Now they're saying if you do it online or even offline and you play on these giant multiplayer
[1:10:59.420 --> 1:11:03.260]  million person games where people can make millions of dollars, this guy's like a superstar
[1:11:03.260 --> 1:11:09.340]  like a professional athlete, well he's banned because he voiced support and that's not even
[1:11:09.340 --> 1:11:10.340]  a Chinese company.
[1:11:10.340 --> 1:11:15.180]  And don't forget, the company that's controlling the NBA in China, Tencent, they're the ones
[1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:19.140]  that bought Reddit for $150 million or say they can call it buying it but they run it
[1:11:19.140 --> 1:11:24.980]  and that's when they ban the Donald, oh a Chinese state-run thing buys Reddit and bans
[1:11:24.980 --> 1:11:27.900]  Donald Trump's number one website.
[1:11:27.900 --> 1:11:35.380]  More impressions than his Twitter account, we're just gonna let the chai comms do that.
[1:11:35.380 --> 1:11:41.420]  Unbelievable, yeah now it's, I'm sorry I said $150 million, now it's even more, wow I guess
[1:11:41.420 --> 1:11:47.220]  that's, I missed that, I guess it's $300 million that they bought it for.
[1:11:47.220 --> 1:11:51.420]  Wow, on top of the $150 million, I guess it's $450 million, it just keeps growing, I'm
[1:11:51.420 --> 1:11:56.860]  sorry I've got my numbers wrong, it's worse than I'm saying here, excuse me.
[1:11:56.860 --> 1:12:00.820]  Chinese citizens will need to pass facial recognition test to use the internet and that's
[1:12:00.820 --> 1:12:06.860]  coming here, it's being announced by the TSA on the airport, this is all gotta stop folks.
[1:12:06.860 --> 1:12:13.300]  UKX spy chief reveals big tech companies like Google, Facebook, no more than MI5 does, yep.
[1:12:13.300 --> 1:12:17.380]  But then I want to show you some articles from last year, fake news is on the eye of
[1:12:17.380 --> 1:12:22.380]  the beholder, China is centralizing efforts to stop online rumors, now that's an accurate
[1:12:22.380 --> 1:12:27.980]  article out of Hong Kong, press, look at this, China's heavy handed reaction to the
[1:12:27.980 --> 1:12:34.140]  NBA is just the wake up call the world needed, wow CNBC, China on US fake news debate, we
[1:12:34.140 --> 1:12:38.860]  told you so and this is where they specifically, GG Pink came out and said good job silencing
[1:12:38.860 --> 1:12:42.260]  all these people, that was in the first round of our banning and the Chinese government
[1:12:42.260 --> 1:12:48.420]  actually prays, this is CNBC, prays the silencing of myself and others, a foreign dictator and
[1:12:48.420 --> 1:12:55.700]  CNBC and others would run around tagging about other sub accounts we had, fake news is rampant
[1:12:55.700 --> 1:13:01.180]  even under tight Chinese filters, Wall Street Journal said oh even GG Pink can't stop at
[1:13:01.180 --> 1:13:05.220]  that poor baby, this is all the sick news, all the corporate America, worshipping what's
[1:13:05.220 --> 1:13:08.220]  happened, now they want to act like, because they're being told what to do, that oh this
[1:13:08.220 --> 1:13:14.460]  has gone too far, well some of them are, and then these big tattletale things funded by
[1:13:14.460 --> 1:13:18.300]  the left out of Canada, the UK and here how the far right extremists rebrand to evade
[1:13:18.300 --> 1:13:23.940]  Facebook's ban, big breathless article reporting it to China, reporting it to the UK, to Canada
[1:13:23.940 --> 1:13:30.620]  about how Paul Watson can still be seen on some people's platforms, ban them all, New
[1:13:30.620 --> 1:13:35.060]  York Times, we can't have Alex Jones on air, he called Hillary Clinton a demon and he said
[1:13:35.060 --> 1:13:38.580]  she never quit running for office, which is now public, we'll go to break it back with
[1:13:38.580 --> 1:13:42.780]  Robert Barnes, I haven't gotten to this, I don't know if I will, it's pretty powerful,
[1:13:42.780 --> 1:13:49.260]  but this is of, in August of last year, Alex Jones to Donald Trump, you need to blow the
[1:13:49.260 --> 1:13:53.780]  whistle on Chinese Communist infiltration of Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party,
[1:13:53.780 --> 1:14:00.860]  it's a five minute video and media matters put it up, tattling on me, going oh look he
[1:14:00.860 --> 1:14:10.580]  needs to be further banned, he talked bad about GG Ping, who again is an appointed dictator,
[1:14:10.580 --> 1:14:14.900]  now telling you what you can say and do, but see they want to normalize all the tattletaling
[1:14:14.900 --> 1:14:19.260]  and just, do you think, are they tone deaf, they realize authoritarian, no, no, no, they
[1:14:19.260 --> 1:14:22.740]  know what they're doing, they want to make the most extreme stuff sound normal, normalization,
[1:14:22.740 --> 1:14:28.740]  hasn't gone too well, I know for a fact that this real clear politics article got to Trump
[1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:35.460]  with the video, thanks to the dumbasses over at media matters, who think if they just walk
[1:14:35.460 --> 1:14:39.340]  around and say they're the authority, we'll all go oh you're the authority, will you please
[1:14:39.340 --> 1:14:43.980]  pull your pants down, can I kiss your work covered ass, sorry I'm going to be good, family
[1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:49.420]  show, but just give me a break, we are starting to turn the tide, but they can throw some
[1:14:49.420 --> 1:14:53.980]  curve balls and we're not out of this yet, but let me tell you, they are in panic mode,
[1:14:53.980 --> 1:14:56.500]  we're going to break it back with Robert Barnes to get into how they're going to try
[1:14:56.500 --> 1:15:01.140]  to impeach him, and they're serious this time, and we're going to talk about what we think
[1:15:01.140 --> 1:15:06.580]  Trump and others should do to stop this, but folks don't be too confident, because the
[1:15:06.580 --> 1:15:10.620]  battle's joined, yes we have the initiative, yes the world's waking up, because the globalists
[1:15:10.620 --> 1:15:13.860]  have overreached, but that doesn't mean we've got the fish in the boat yet, so we'll talk
[1:15:13.860 --> 1:15:17.140]  about it when we come back, please don't forget we had to end the biggest sale we've had
[1:15:17.140 --> 1:15:21.380]  since Christmas, that's the bad news, store-wide free shipping, double pantry appointments,
[1:15:21.380 --> 1:15:26.500]  50% off, store-wide on all-subliminal preparedness goods, but here's the good news, we have a
[1:15:26.500 --> 1:15:30.420]  new sale even bigger, that's right I decided, you know what, I'm just going to sell out
[1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:35.500]  of everything, now some things we were selling at cost like the skin cream with the hyaluronic
[1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:39.660]  acid and all the rest of it, and the patented silver salt, that was a mistake, I did it
[1:15:39.660 --> 1:15:43.660]  50% off, that was it cost, with shipping we lost money, that's why it all sold out,
[1:15:43.660 --> 1:15:47.620]  the big tubes, we had the little tubes left at 30% off, that's still an incredible deal,
[1:15:47.620 --> 1:15:52.300]  I mean I'm making like a dollar on those, but we are selling a lot of them, but these
[1:15:52.300 --> 1:15:56.220]  old 10,000 tubes, yeah that's 10,000 dollars, that doesn't fund very much, we got a bunch
[1:15:56.220 --> 1:16:01.020]  of specials, everything must go, mega sale, and I'm doing it until we sell out everything

[1:20:48.820 --> 1:20:55.740]  not just online but period in 2016 and 2017 despite shadow betting then in 2018 we were
[1:20:55.740 --> 1:21:01.860]  completely banned off first 30 or so big platforms then hundreds of platforms the only places
[1:21:01.860 --> 1:21:06.380]  we can still be heard is on radio TV our own sites like band on video in fours.com four
[1:21:06.380 --> 1:21:11.340]  slash show and of course places like cloud TV where we've been on one year and are not
[1:21:11.340 --> 1:21:17.820]  their number one show watched by their subscribers number one show when people buy the boxes
[1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:24.300]  number one show of all their news combined we are number one and I'm not putting down
[1:21:24.300 --> 1:21:32.940]  blaze and one America news network and newsmax and all of those combined and RT combined
[1:21:32.940 --> 1:21:38.420]  we're bigger than all combined that's because people want hardcore they want unscripted they
[1:21:38.420 --> 1:21:44.020]  want false the walls they want the real deal and that's what they get constitutional lawyer
[1:21:44.020 --> 1:21:47.900]  Robert Barnes is the real deal and I wanted to get him on with us today to talk about
[1:21:47.900 --> 1:21:53.740]  this the letter the White House sent last night saying we're not going to comply with
[1:21:53.740 --> 1:21:58.780]  your quote impeachment inquiry because it's not an impeachment process under the Constitution
[1:21:58.780 --> 1:22:02.460]  you don't let Republicans have any power you don't let them ask any questions you have
[1:22:02.460 --> 1:22:07.100]  kangaroo courts you say you're gonna have whistleblowers over CCTV camera with blacked
[1:22:07.100 --> 1:22:13.900]  out faces this is beyond kangaroo this is Kafka ask so we're gonna go to Barnes here
[1:22:13.900 --> 1:22:19.980]  in just a moment but we have this letter they're spitting it like it's obstruction now I'm not
[1:22:19.980 --> 1:22:25.380]  a famous constitutional and criminal lawyer like Robert Barnes but looking over this Trump's
[1:22:25.380 --> 1:22:29.860]  letters dead on he says this isn't real we've always been open we've given you more emails
[1:22:29.860 --> 1:22:35.220]  more more testimonies but now this isn't a real process we don't get new process we're
[1:22:35.220 --> 1:22:39.860]  not participating well even if it was a real process the presidency is an executive it's
[1:22:39.860 --> 1:22:43.340]  a separate branch of government so if the Democrats refused all those subpoenas when
[1:22:43.340 --> 1:22:48.140]  Obama was in so Robert Barnes am I right in saying that as we go over these articles
[1:22:48.140 --> 1:22:54.300]  and go over these letters oh absolutely I mean and when the it's only obstruction when
[1:22:54.300 --> 1:22:59.980]  you have someone doing something illegal to oppose the process doing something illegal
[1:22:59.980 --> 1:23:04.180]  is entirely appropriate in fact what you're supposed to do in an adversarial process and
[1:23:04.180 --> 1:23:07.740]  what the what the president is doing is two different aspects here first the president
[1:23:07.740 --> 1:23:13.820]  is in a position whereas the part of the executive branch he determines what is appropriate compliance
[1:23:13.820 --> 1:23:19.740]  with legislative request and the point that the president is making he's been making it
[1:23:19.740 --> 1:23:24.580]  in court in a wide range of court proceedings ongoing involving tax returns and a range
[1:23:24.580 --> 1:23:29.620]  of issues is that in order for the executive branch to have to comply with the legislative
[1:23:29.620 --> 1:23:35.140]  branch the legislative branch must be doing legislative activity and they can't just use
[1:23:35.140 --> 1:23:39.820]  their investigative power to investigate whatever they want because they are not the executive
[1:23:39.820 --> 1:23:45.220]  branch they do not have the power or the authority to simply go rummaging through anyone's private
[1:23:45.220 --> 1:23:49.940]  information even if that information is involved executive privilege and the presidency or
[1:23:49.940 --> 1:23:55.060]  the executive branch so their authority over the executive branch is limited to funding
[1:23:55.060 --> 1:24:01.300]  certain operations and certain kinds of oversight that does not include an impeachment process
[1:24:01.300 --> 1:24:06.900]  that is rogue and isn't following proper constitutional process so particularly here there should
[1:24:06.900 --> 1:24:13.020]  have been a full house vote to initiate impeachment inquiry and investigation that has not occurred
[1:24:13.020 --> 1:24:18.340]  there should have been there should not have been illicit contact between rogue CIA deep
[1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:24.180]  state agents and the congressional committees that has occurred congressman Schiff lied
[1:24:24.180 --> 1:24:29.820]  about it congressman Schiff fabricated a story at the beginning of a one of the hearings
[1:24:29.820 --> 1:24:34.380]  involving this matter in which he created a fake transcript that didn't exist and that
[1:24:34.380 --> 1:24:38.620]  was contradicted by the real transcript of the conversation between the president and
[1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:44.020]  the president of Ukraine so the president is completely on constitutionally good standing
[1:24:44.020 --> 1:24:51.140]  by objecting and opposing these lawless investigative inquiries that are simply rummaging through
[1:24:51.140 --> 1:24:56.820]  all of his personal and public aspects of his office that go beyond the scope of legitimate
[1:24:56.820 --> 1:25:01.740]  legislative president is being gang stock the president is being gang rape the president
[1:25:01.740 --> 1:25:05.940]  is being killed by a thousand cuts I mean 30 plus lawsuits against us has been rough
[1:25:05.940 --> 1:25:09.380]  as hell but the listeners have stood with us we've already won most of them nobody even
[1:25:09.380 --> 1:25:13.060]  knows that because the media won't report it but imagine being the president at last
[1:25:13.060 --> 1:25:17.140]  number I've tried to find the number but it appears that there have been close to a thousand
[1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:21.500]  lawsuits one way or another filed against him or his companies or his families since
[1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:25.380]  he ran you talk about unprecedented persecution.
[1:25:25.380 --> 1:25:29.780]  No doubt about it I mean you compare to Obama who the Obama administration refused to comply
[1:25:29.780 --> 1:25:34.620]  with subpoenas that really were part of the lawful process the IRS Tea Party investigation
[1:25:34.620 --> 1:25:38.980]  was Congress's duty to investigate how that was being misused and abused because it related
[1:25:38.980 --> 1:25:44.420]  to the legislative authorization of IRS funding on an ongoing basis yet they refused to comply
[1:25:44.420 --> 1:25:48.580]  the attorney general was held in contempt because he refused to comply so they were the
[1:25:48.580 --> 1:25:52.900]  Obama administration refused to comply when there was in fact legitimate legislative inquiries
[1:25:52.900 --> 1:25:58.300]  taking place here you have illegitimate legislative inquiries taking place and is in fact a duty
[1:25:58.300 --> 1:26:02.180]  and obligation of the executive branch of the president to protect the executive branch
[1:26:02.180 --> 1:26:07.580]  to protect the elected representative of the executive branch from this illicit investigative
[1:26:07.580 --> 1:26:12.380]  inquiry that is nothing more than a witch hunt and a rummage and they're essentially
[1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:16.740]  searching for anything they can possibly find and it's even more frightening you mentioned
[1:26:16.740 --> 1:26:21.300]  the weaponization of the law it's very sort of communist like in the way that they approach
[1:26:21.300 --> 1:26:28.100]  this use of the state you're seeing the wholesale wholesale weaponization of the legal system
[1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:32.460]  against the president and his allies across the board you're seeing county governments
[1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:37.700]  trying to get his subpoena his personal tax return and tax returns of friends and family
[1:26:37.700 --> 1:26:42.740]  members and business associates going back almost a decade when it has absolutely nothing
[1:26:42.740 --> 1:26:48.060]  to do with any matter under criminal investigation and cannot be relevant or pertinent and when
[1:26:48.060 --> 1:26:52.780]  the tax returns were promised to be privileged and private by both New York state law by
[1:26:52.780 --> 1:26:58.060]  them and most state laws across the country and by federal law because the the deal was
[1:26:58.060 --> 1:27:01.060]  that hey we're going to have you disclose a lot of personal intimate information on
[1:27:01.060 --> 1:27:06.700]  your tax returns for tax purposes but don't worry we won't misuse it and abuse it later
[1:27:06.700 --> 1:27:09.700]  but that's precisely what they're doing and let's slow down because you're doing just
[1:27:09.700 --> 1:27:13.660]  an incredible job which is why we don't see you on national TV very often as you point
[1:27:13.660 --> 1:27:17.620]  out real lawyers they don't put on air they just put the people that go along with the
[1:27:17.620 --> 1:27:21.300]  system I mean that's well known for folks that don't know about business and life the
[1:27:21.300 --> 1:27:25.060]  courts have all ruled it that when you do all this private stuff on tax returns and
[1:27:25.060 --> 1:27:29.100]  already violate your fourth amendment they go oh don't worry it's like HIPAA medical
[1:27:29.100 --> 1:27:32.140]  records we're going to keep it totally secret but now they're just getting rid of all that
[1:27:32.140 --> 1:27:36.780]  president it's very frightening when the left then gets your tax returns they can harass
[1:27:36.780 --> 1:27:41.900]  all your vendors and everyone you work with we have experienced them not they've tried
[1:27:41.900 --> 1:27:46.820]  to get them but but but they got it another way harassing our vendors going after our
[1:27:46.820 --> 1:27:50.420]  merchant accounts I mean we've been under the very same terror attack I know you don't
[1:27:50.420 --> 1:27:53.860]  want to get into it on air but explain to people that if it's happened to us at this
[1:27:53.860 --> 1:27:58.060]  level it must be hellish for Trump no doubt about it because I mean what they're doing
[1:27:58.060 --> 1:28:04.100]  is the imagine if any city county sheriff anywhere in the country could decide they
[1:28:04.100 --> 1:28:08.020]  don't like the president and they use their criminal investigative authorities their grand
[1:28:08.020 --> 1:28:13.420]  jury power they're the which is the most extraordinary invasive power in the world power the grand
[1:28:13.420 --> 1:28:18.580]  jury to investigate to subpoena to spy to force and coerce testimony you never have
[1:28:18.580 --> 1:28:21.820]  a president stay in office you never have anyone run no one would ever even get elected
[1:28:21.820 --> 1:28:25.580]  I mean that's why there's a jurisdictional issue and that's why there's a separation
[1:28:25.580 --> 1:28:30.580]  of powers and that's why the president has immunity outside of impeachment exactly in
[1:28:30.580 --> 1:28:33.780]  fact that's why the founders had it up this way Thomas Jefferson talks about it all the
[1:28:33.780 --> 1:28:37.520]  way back to it during his presidency if a president can be subject to random subpoenas
[1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:41.580]  from politically motivated prosecutors they could end the presidency overnight that's
[1:28:41.580 --> 1:28:44.780]  why the president is right that's why the president is right to be fighting this he's
[1:28:44.780 --> 1:28:48.540]  fighting this for the fundamental freedoms not only up himself but really the whole country
[1:28:48.540 --> 1:28:51.980]  and the foundational freedoms that founded this country and this is a deep state coup
[1:28:51.980 --> 1:28:56.100]  attempt trying to weaponize the legal system in an illicit way that undermines our
[1:28:56.100 --> 1:28:58.860]  right Robert Barnes is on fire he's told us what's happening now what does he think

[1:33:12.620 --> 1:33:27.940]  show from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[1:33:27.940 --> 1:33:44.500]  I've talked about this a lot on air people ask how do I take it how do I take the attacks
[1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:48.980]  and I don't say this to act tough I say this so that people don't understand it get the
[1:33:48.980 --> 1:33:53.980]  secret it's like when you haven't been working out for a while and you go for a 10 mile hike
[1:33:53.980 --> 1:33:58.940]  and almost kills you but you do it a week later and it's it hurts but it's not that
[1:33:58.940 --> 1:34:03.660]  bad you do it again and it's easy the next you know by four or five hikes are doing 20
[1:34:03.660 --> 1:34:08.540]  mile hike or you know let's say you're doing squats and you haven't done squats since high
[1:34:08.540 --> 1:34:12.380]  school and you do it with the bar and then you get so tired you can barely get out of
[1:34:12.380 --> 1:34:16.860]  bed the next day but a few months later you're squatting 200 300 pounds and you're doing
[1:34:16.860 --> 1:34:23.060]  you know 1015 reps it feels great and you're back in shade or at least close to it in this
[1:34:23.060 --> 1:34:29.740]  whole victim system Barnes talks a lot about this it's true people get into how they're
[1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:33.660]  a victim it's like a new class system the more you're a victim the higher on the food
[1:34:33.660 --> 1:34:37.940]  chain you are and you supposedly have representatives that speak for you and what you're really in
[1:34:37.940 --> 1:34:45.460]  as a cult but it started in the 80s and 90s when there was a crime wave mainly the crack
[1:34:45.460 --> 1:34:48.980]  cocaine situation and crime did go up some and it was dangerous in some areas I grew
[1:34:48.980 --> 1:34:53.780]  up in Dallas and it was damn dangerous but kidnapping wise was still pretty rare but people
[1:34:53.780 --> 1:34:57.060]  thought there were kidnappers everywhere and a roller hervera had shows about it and everything
[1:34:57.060 --> 1:35:01.220]  and people started keeping their kids inside before everybody's kids ran around till nighttime
[1:35:01.220 --> 1:35:07.260]  I still did you know back in the 80s it's the same phenomenon of you know great white
[1:35:07.260 --> 1:35:11.100]  sharks kill like 10 people a year globally on average but people don't want to swim I
[1:35:11.100 --> 1:35:16.380]  was out in San Diego just a month or so ago and I was swimming out like you know 50 yards
[1:35:16.380 --> 1:35:19.420]  people like hey you better not do that there's great white sharks out there and I'm like
[1:35:19.420 --> 1:35:24.780]  what they eat like one person a year on the west coast I mean give me a break give me
[1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:29.540]  a break but that's the mind doesn't we told there's a riptide then I did I be careful
[1:35:29.540 --> 1:35:36.500]  but there weren't flags up there wasn't a riptide but that's the mindset is that it's the fear
[1:35:36.500 --> 1:35:42.260]  of being involved that makes you the slave and so Trump came out in a clip in a speech
[1:35:42.260 --> 1:35:49.220]  he gave yesterday and press conference he said I thrive off of being attacked because
[1:35:49.220 --> 1:35:52.540]  it's an important mission I'm carrying out I'm getting things done and I know I'm in
[1:35:52.540 --> 1:35:57.620]  the right and so it's like he said last week it's like putting a suit on a suit of armor
[1:35:57.620 --> 1:36:03.020]  it's it's it's something you've got to do and so it's an honor to be persecuted in line
[1:36:03.020 --> 1:36:07.180]  about by these criminals people think oh you're getting attacked by the system you're losing
[1:36:07.180 --> 1:36:11.700]  no no no we got in a bad position because people stopped standing up for what was right and
[1:36:11.700 --> 1:36:16.660]  now oh it's Alex Jones last year it's Republican senators having their Twitter's frozen this
[1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:22.860]  year and putting up with it and so the chikoms are like well let's test it Tiffany's video
[1:36:22.860 --> 1:36:32.020]  game companies NBA do exactly as we say okay well we're still banning you oh please master
[1:36:32.020 --> 1:36:35.380]  and the big corporations it's not just about money they like that submission as well but
[1:36:35.380 --> 1:36:38.860]  now the corporations are being told to submit by the chikoms they're kind of bucking it
[1:36:38.860 --> 1:36:42.660]  a little bit see that's the separation of powers the founders knew that you're gonna
[1:36:42.660 --> 1:36:46.340]  have tyrants a lot of times the positions of power because they seek it especially if
[1:36:46.340 --> 1:36:51.860]  good men don't seek it to protect the country from it so you got to have that separation
[1:36:51.860 --> 1:36:56.100]  of powers so that you got these other corporations other countries that don't want to be dominated
[1:36:56.100 --> 1:37:01.700]  they'll fight against a Hitler or against a GZP or against a Stalin and so we're now
[1:37:01.700 --> 1:37:06.340]  to that point and we've got a real Americana guy that doesn't want to be dictator he wants
[1:37:06.340 --> 1:37:10.220]  to be the turnaround guy you think Lee eye coke it was big you know for turning around
[1:37:10.220 --> 1:37:15.180]  what was it Chrysler that would be a billion times that if Trump could turn America and
[1:37:15.180 --> 1:37:19.820]  the world around the name Trump won't just be synonymous with victory in business or
[1:37:19.820 --> 1:37:26.740]  cards or gambling or whatever it will be synonymous with revival and renaissance that's why he's
[1:37:26.740 --> 1:37:33.100]  for real he an idiot savant level the things he's done so far and you've got to give it
[1:37:33.100 --> 1:37:39.820]  credit oh you've sold out you're groveling all I get persecuted for supporting Trump
[1:37:39.820 --> 1:37:44.140]  I could attack Trump right now in all the fake lawsuits and attacks and death threats
[1:37:44.140 --> 1:37:50.020]  would go away like fog it's sunrise but I go into the fog I steer into the attack we're
[1:37:50.020 --> 1:37:55.340]  going to Robert Barnes writing in about 30 seconds but here's Trump talking about how
[1:37:55.340 --> 1:38:01.820]  he thrives on it yes you should thrive on the resistance you should thrive as real rebels
[1:38:01.820 --> 1:38:07.260]  to the globalist here it is what they did is unthinkable what they did to this country
[1:38:07.260 --> 1:38:11.940]  is unthinkable and it's lucky that I'm the president because I guess I don't know what
[1:38:11.940 --> 1:38:15.260]  a lot of people said very few people could handle it I sort of thrive on it you know
[1:38:15.260 --> 1:38:20.540]  why because because it's so important that we get to the bottom we went through the whole
[1:38:20.540 --> 1:38:27.740]  Mueller scam two and a half years we went through that and I had three four days where
[1:38:27.740 --> 1:38:32.220]  it was like over and then I'm walking into the United Nations and they released it as
[1:38:32.220 --> 1:38:38.060]  I'm walking in and then it goes into all of that Barnes I mean we're not here to worship
[1:38:38.060 --> 1:38:42.140]  Trump but I know you admire him a lot and you you won the biggest bet in Ireland almost
[1:38:42.140 --> 1:38:47.020]  $400,000 you are the admit even Reuters says you're the most successful at least public
[1:38:47.020 --> 1:38:52.780]  a political gambler out there and you're not too shabby on the other areas as well with
[1:38:52.780 --> 1:38:56.380]  which again it shows you can beat the house your smart cookie to our chief legal counsel
[1:38:56.380 --> 1:39:00.660]  but how would you quantify who Trump is and this moment we're in and then what's coming
[1:39:00.660 --> 1:39:06.620]  next in this acceleration to 2020 well I was up in New York with my brother celebrating
[1:39:06.620 --> 1:39:12.140]  his 58th birthday and he was discussing how much this parallel aspects of Watergate and
[1:39:12.140 --> 1:39:17.500]  particularly the untold aspects of Watergate which was that Watergate really was not about
[1:39:17.500 --> 1:39:22.260]  Richard Nixon's you know a third-rate burglary it was about the one one of the good things
[1:39:22.260 --> 1:39:27.880]  that Nixon did was he tried to dehooverize the FBI after Hoover's death and try to clean
[1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:33.140]  it up and have it be less this independent deep state monopoly of political power outside
[1:39:33.140 --> 1:39:38.060]  of the control of the political processes and elected officials in the public will and
[1:39:38.060 --> 1:39:43.820]  so he passed over Mark Felt. Mark Felt was the Rand Cohen tell pro I mean this guy was
[1:39:43.820 --> 1:39:50.020]  one of the leaders of the black bag operations against US citizens over the past 30 years
[1:39:50.020 --> 1:39:56.700]  or so but between the 19 of late 1940s and early 1970s and when that happened Mark Felt
[1:39:56.700 --> 1:40:00.740]  became deep throat. I remember having a discussion with Ben Bradley the editor of Washington
[1:40:00.740 --> 1:40:05.300]  Post many years ago when I was a student in Yale and we were discussing deep throat and
[1:40:05.300 --> 1:40:08.500]  he wasn't wanting to disclose who it was and I said well maybe the reason you don't want
[1:40:08.500 --> 1:40:12.580]  to disclose who it is is that the country knew it was they wouldn't be so enamored with who
[1:40:12.580 --> 1:40:17.380]  it was he just smiled and moved on well that turned out to be the truth. Here we have and
[1:40:17.380 --> 1:40:21.500]  Mark Felt's out in the open. We have a deep throat that is a fake whistleblower that is
[1:40:21.500 --> 1:40:26.780]  an identified CIA agent according to the New York Times. This is the CIA attempting to do
[1:40:26.780 --> 1:40:31.460]  a rogue coup against the president of the United States using the Democratic House as their
[1:40:31.460 --> 1:40:36.020]  tool and their mechanism of achieving it and so it is an extraordinary time the president
[1:40:36.020 --> 1:40:39.700]  is facing and I think Trump has recognized all the way through what this is that this
[1:40:39.700 --> 1:40:44.380]  is the deep state trying to coerce his foreign policy and I think he made a very good decision
[1:40:44.380 --> 1:40:47.860]  that there's two levels at which he's defending himself defending himself in the court of public
[1:40:47.860 --> 1:40:52.540]  opinion attacking what a fraud this is defending himself correctly legally by by resting on
[1:40:52.540 --> 1:40:56.660]  the Constitution but also it was very useful that he doubled down on his foreign policy
[1:40:56.660 --> 1:41:00.100]  positions that he's not he's he's sending the message the deep state he's not going
[1:41:00.100 --> 1:41:04.620]  to let them dictate and determine our foreign policy that's why it's after they launched
[1:41:04.620 --> 1:41:09.460]  this coup attempt that he decides okay that's it we're out of Syria that's it we're going
[1:41:09.460 --> 1:41:13.260]  to investigate corruption in Ukraine openly and publicly I'm going to tell China they
[1:41:13.260 --> 1:41:19.100]  need to investigate the corruption quick buy-in-off US politicians the NBA scandal happens not
[1:41:19.100 --> 1:41:23.740]  long after it's probably not a coincidence that right around the same time period it
[1:41:23.740 --> 1:41:29.020]  came out that the FBI was illicitly using the NSA and domestic spying technique to spy
[1:41:29.020 --> 1:41:34.220]  on Americans on a regular routine basis that was so upsetting and offensive even though
[1:41:34.220 --> 1:41:38.620]  the pro intelligence community FISA court had to issue a special order saying how outrageous
[1:41:38.620 --> 1:41:43.580]  an offensive it was so it's not a coincidence that information comes out the the president
[1:41:43.580 --> 1:41:47.940]  is fighting back recognizing the deep state wants to misuse its weaponize weaponization
[1:41:47.940 --> 1:41:52.420]  of the law weaponization weaponization of the impeachment process to try to take out
[1:41:52.420 --> 1:41:57.860]  the president and prevent him from implementing the American people's will in foreign policy
[1:41:57.860 --> 1:42:02.060]  so a key area for him to fight back is where he is fighting back it's time to implement
[1:42:02.060 --> 1:42:06.860]  America's foreign policy not Iran's foreign policy not Saudi Arabia's foreign policy not
[1:42:06.860 --> 1:42:11.660]  anybody else's foreign policy not the CIA in the deep state foreign policy not the five
[1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:16.660]  eyes foreign policy but implement American foreign policy you are also seeing the reports
[1:42:16.660 --> 1:42:20.940]  come out that he's expanding the scope and the bar is expanding the scope of what Dunham
[1:42:20.940 --> 1:42:26.180]  is doing and investigating the spy gate scandal that deeply implicates the five eyes it's
[1:42:26.180 --> 1:42:30.380]  not a coincidence that bar and Dunham were in Italy recently so the president is doing
[1:42:30.380 --> 1:42:33.700]  the right thing he's doubling down on America he's doubling down on the American people
[1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:37.500]  is doubling down on the American will and doing so that's what gives us the best chance
[1:42:37.500 --> 1:42:41.940]  to fight back but people should not be deceived this is a real fight this is a true fight this
[1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:46.460]  is an honest fight and the greatest power the president has is the American people in
[1:42:46.460 --> 1:42:50.100]  the infowars audience to fight back against these deep state coup attempts to destroy
[1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:54.420]  American democracy and freedom absolutely I mean this is an epic time and they keep
[1:42:54.420 --> 1:42:59.140]  using gambling analogies his ships are all in and his ships are on the table it's the
[1:42:59.140 --> 1:43:03.500]  time to pick sides and commit America I think you are committing we're very proud of you
[1:43:03.500 --> 1:43:12.780]  the truth is President Trump is the most investigated president in history he is working for American
[1:43:12.780 --> 1:43:17.900]  interest steadfastly he is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break
[1:43:17.900 --> 1:43:23.460]  our borders bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist Chinese control
[1:43:23.460 --> 1:43:28.580]  who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt we have been maneuvered towards collapse
[1:43:28.580 --> 1:43:34.580]  and bankruptcy but at the 11th hour 58th minute the American people put a populist in power
[1:43:34.580 --> 1:43:39.740]  and it's happening all over the world so great things are happening but the enemy is striking
[1:43:39.740 --> 1:43:45.620]  back they're very serious with this impeachment plan it has bipartisan support and I'm telling
[1:43:45.620 --> 1:43:50.860]  you President Trump needs our prayers and infowars needs your prayers and support ladies
[1:43:50.860 --> 1:43:54.460]  and gentlemen the globalists are trying to shut us down but right now it's easier than
[1:43:54.460 --> 1:43:57.980]  ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time with Black
[1:43:57.980 --> 1:44:03.460]  Friday comes two months early with store-wide free shipping double patriot points and ladies
[1:44:03.460 --> 1:44:09.420]  and gentlemen 50% off China was already running the United States you're like well China could
[1:44:09.420 --> 1:44:15.540]  never take it with the US that's right as the Roman historian and senator Cicero warned
[1:44:15.540 --> 1:44:22.420]  a powerful empire can't fall from without before it first falls from within so yes they're
[1:44:22.420 --> 1:44:27.300]  coming for your guns all of them yes they're coming for your children they've already
[1:44:27.300 --> 1:44:33.080]  taken your speech almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like infowars.com and
[1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:39.500]  bandod video so now you know why I'm so upset now you know why I'm so angry I saw the producers
[1:44:39.500 --> 1:44:44.220]  of South Park on TV they're totally pissing angry people like why are they angry because
[1:44:44.220 --> 1:44:50.220]  they see all of their freedom their American freedom hard fought taken away are you gonna
[1:44:50.220 --> 1:44:54.620]  get upset well you're a listener you're obviously are upset but you've got to ring the alarm
[1:44:54.620 --> 1:44:59.180]  everywhere until others they've got to get upset and then take action and let Congress
[1:44:59.180 --> 1:45:02.580]  everybody else know that we're not backing down and we're not going to sell America out
[1:45:02.580 --> 1:45:06.700]  to the chikongs.
[1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:13.140]  My friends I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have and my goodness yesterday's
[1:45:13.140 --> 1:45:17.980]  press conference when they came in on him with all their garbage the foreign reporters
[1:45:17.980 --> 1:45:24.380]  the US reporters these little political sellouts these whores he just tore them to bits and
[1:45:24.380 --> 1:45:28.180]  it's one thing to hear it if you're a radio listener it's powerful but if you see it it's

[1:46:07.060 --> 1:46:11.740]  Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago and they've been approving
[1:46:11.740 --> 1:46:17.620]  almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years and now they
[1:46:17.620 --> 1:46:22.020]  own our debt now they own the Democratic Party now they've merged with Silicon Valley to
[1:46:22.020 --> 1:46:27.620]  censor patriots off the air Washington Post comes out and says they hope that Gigi Ping
[1:46:27.620 --> 1:46:34.260]  the dictator of China will quote destroy Trump that's a headline so infowars has been the
[1:46:34.260 --> 1:46:39.060]  Paul Revere of this operation we have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven
[1:46:39.060 --> 1:46:43.660]  right and that's why it's more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and their
[1:46:43.660 --> 1:46:49.500]  chai-kong masters by word of mouth and spread the word about infowars and check out infowarstore.com
[1:46:49.500 --> 1:46:53.780]  that's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded that's where the tip of the

[1:49:00.500 --> 1:49:05.980]  quality turmeric bodies it's great visual great grill oil it's great healthy focused
[1:49:05.980 --> 1:49:14.180]  new tropic brain pill brain force the protein bars are amazing turbo force is really amazing
[1:49:14.180 --> 1:49:20.420]  well I just got level the last few days we ran the biggest sales since Christmas I called
[1:49:20.420 --> 1:49:24.660]  it the black friday comes early we ran it for like two weeks and we did sell out of
[1:49:24.660 --> 1:49:30.180]  ten of the products and I was sitting back and I said you know what most of these new
[1:49:30.180 --> 1:49:34.260]  products don't come in we're about to sell a lot of stuff the next month anyways most
[1:49:34.260 --> 1:49:39.860]  of the stuff doesn't come back in until early December and a lot of stuff doesn't come in
[1:49:39.860 --> 1:49:44.940]  until next year and I just said the way the world is now crazy it is and the fact that
[1:49:44.940 --> 1:49:50.460]  we don't have extra money in the accounts for even more than like a month of payroll
[1:49:50.460 --> 1:49:55.020]  we've never been at that point but I'm just put hiring people focusing taking action
[1:49:55.020 --> 1:49:58.300]  sitting reporters out I'm just spending every bit of money comes in right now I haven't
[1:49:58.300 --> 1:50:02.860]  been paid over a year which is fine I'm even spending reserve money because I just gut
[1:50:02.860 --> 1:50:07.860]  level no and I've been good at gut level I need to put everything into the fight now
[1:50:07.860 --> 1:50:14.260]  and then the history is being made but we did stuff like the skin cream and I said all
[1:50:14.260 --> 1:50:18.540]  the stuff was 50% off well the skin cream doesn't have 50% in it so we actually lost
[1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:23.980]  money on that of course we sold out of it high quality silver saw patented with the
[1:50:23.980 --> 1:50:28.940]  hyaluronic acid and all the rest of it we lost money on that now all the one ounce tubes
[1:50:28.940 --> 1:50:34.100]  are left all the three ounce tubes sold out it's at 30% off we make $1.25 or something
[1:50:34.100 --> 1:50:38.100]  for two but that's something that gets you in the store it's a high end product a one
[1:50:38.100 --> 1:50:42.260]  ounce of this would cost 20 bucks at Ulta without the silver in it you know we usually
[1:50:42.260 --> 1:50:47.780]  sell it for like you know $10 now it's even lower than that just get it in for store.com
[1:50:47.780 --> 1:50:55.340]  it's everything must go emergency sale and it's 40 to 70% off store wide except for the
[1:50:55.340 --> 1:50:59.500]  silver because I just can't even do 40 40 we're losing money and free shipping continues

[1:51:27.700 --> 1:51:31.380]  Barnes I've been asking a lot of questions here and you've really been laying it all
[1:51:31.380 --> 1:51:38.100]  out looking at China and it looks to me like an overreach and the corporation's groveling
[1:51:38.100 --> 1:51:42.660]  really was a magic moment for people the biggest sea change I've seen yet what is your take
[1:51:42.660 --> 1:51:47.300]  on that there's no doubt about it I mean it was good timing for the president to see it
[1:51:47.300 --> 1:51:52.820]  for China to get exposed China is unwilling to broach any degree of disagreement or dissidence
[1:51:52.820 --> 1:51:59.140]  or of any kind not only internally but even with their corporate parties and court effectively
[1:51:59.140 --> 1:52:03.420]  corporate partners which is what the NBA has become with China and the NBA wants access
[1:52:03.420 --> 1:52:08.300]  to the Chinese market they see it as a potentially it's sort of the whole corporate approach to
[1:52:08.300 --> 1:52:15.420]  China has been let's ship manufacturing jobs and production to China and it was stage one
[1:52:15.420 --> 1:52:20.780]  of their corporate involvement in the stage two was build a big Chinese middle class that's
[1:52:20.780 --> 1:52:26.420]  what going to buy their products and so they've seen China and sort of the future and that's
[1:52:26.420 --> 1:52:31.740]  why there's been this unusual behavior toward China by the corporate elites in the media
[1:52:31.740 --> 1:52:37.220]  establishment and the Democratic Party apparatus I mean it's extraordinary of all these people
[1:52:37.220 --> 1:52:43.260]  complaining about climate change as in their apocalyptic theory well anyone who is sincere
[1:52:43.260 --> 1:52:48.380]  as to be with Noam Chomsky a few years back when he became very hyped on climate change
[1:52:48.380 --> 1:52:52.260]  this anybody who's sincere about this would be obsessed with China not the United States
[1:52:52.260 --> 1:52:57.540]  yet they're unwilling to say anything about it and what got exposed is it's again the
[1:52:57.540 --> 1:53:01.780]  courage of one man and that old Chinese image of the one guy standing up against the tanks
[1:53:01.780 --> 1:53:07.580]  all the way back to the to the to the massacre back in the late 1980s you have the same dynamic
[1:53:07.580 --> 1:53:13.060]  here where just one NBA player stood up and said this is you know I'm with Hong Kong I'm
[1:53:13.060 --> 1:53:17.620]  with freedom didn't even bash China you just said I'm with Hong Kong and I'm with freedom
[1:53:17.620 --> 1:53:23.260]  and that so offended and so outraged the Chinese government that they're willing to cut off
[1:53:23.260 --> 1:53:27.420]  their own countries and their own community and their own people's access to a sport that
[1:53:27.420 --> 1:53:33.060]  they like the NBA and it shows the degree of mind control and thought control behavior
[1:53:33.060 --> 1:53:36.940]  that the Chinese have been engaged in there's probably not a coincidence that China is highly
[1:53:36.940 --> 1:53:40.700]  sensitive at the moment because Trump keeps exposing their bad conduct excluding there
[1:53:40.700 --> 1:53:44.140]  were stories that came out again this week and it was another example of Trump doubling
[1:53:44.140 --> 1:53:48.980]  down against the deep state agenda in their in their attempts to have a coup against him
[1:53:48.980 --> 1:53:52.660]  a second time you know Trump is standing up in the same way that man stood up to that
[1:53:52.660 --> 1:53:57.140]  tank the in the tenement square it's the same dynamic you all of a sudden saw stories come
[1:53:57.140 --> 1:54:03.100]  out about how the Chinese are says the government is systematically involved with forced abortions
[1:54:03.100 --> 1:54:07.700]  is involved with various forms of effectively almost youth in Asia involved with sort of
[1:54:07.700 --> 1:54:11.700]  different mechanisms and methods of which they are suppressing their population there's
[1:54:11.700 --> 1:54:16.180]  always been longstanding stories about their involvement in Oregon forced Oregon transplant
[1:54:16.180 --> 1:54:20.060]  donations against religious dissidents now it came out that they're doing it against
[1:54:20.060 --> 1:54:26.700]  other groups of religious dissidents and at the same time Trump exposed China in the story
[1:54:26.700 --> 1:54:31.260]  about forced sterilizations abortion basically it's a genocide against any religiously dissident
[1:54:31.260 --> 1:54:36.340]  group two million people in camps put engaged in prison and the left worships them I have
[1:54:36.340 --> 1:54:39.820]  crew members here that I've known for many years one guy's worked here 18 years his sister
[1:54:39.820 --> 1:54:44.780]  won't talk to him and praises China and hopes they quote crush Trump and the Washington Post
[1:54:44.780 --> 1:54:50.500]  says that G.G.P. must destroy Trump that's a quote to save America these people are sick
[1:54:50.500 --> 1:54:56.260]  no doubt about it and the brink of Trump this week was his trolling effort where he said
[1:54:56.260 --> 1:55:00.580]  I demand that China investigate Joe Biden and the media trying to say oh that's a terrible
[1:55:00.580 --> 1:55:04.020]  thing that's the fact the duty of the president is to make sure that we don't have corruption
[1:55:04.020 --> 1:55:07.100]  involving foreign governments in the United States now he was bringing up that they bought
[1:55:07.100 --> 1:55:11.220]  him off which he now admits has done he does this over and over again just like when he
[1:55:11.220 --> 1:55:15.220]  said to Hillary hey Hillary I want you to steal it from Elizabeth Warren he was talking
[1:55:15.220 --> 1:55:19.700]  about how she did it last time to Bernie and they went oh he's telling her to steal it
[1:55:19.700 --> 1:55:24.660]  no he's not saying the full thing knowing the media will jump on it turn it against him
[1:55:24.660 --> 1:55:28.500]  and the whole thing comes out exactly I mean there's no question that what he was doing
[1:55:28.500 --> 1:55:31.860]  to China was trolling China it's not like China is going to actually investigate their
[1:55:31.860 --> 1:55:36.780]  own deliberate intentional corruption of the Democratic American American party politics
[1:55:36.780 --> 1:55:41.620]  where they're involved in this question what do you call it it's beyond trolling when
[1:55:41.620 --> 1:55:45.140]  once I was told by this famous talk show host they said Alex you ever try to cram a dollar
[1:55:45.140 --> 1:55:48.020]  bill in a vending machine it won't take it but if you act like you don't want to give
[1:55:48.020 --> 1:55:53.140]  it to it every time it goes in you've got to sometimes be easier with stuff and there
[1:55:53.140 --> 1:55:56.860]  is sometimes you know time to do that but the way Trump does it's beyond that he'll
[1:55:56.860 --> 1:56:01.900]  put it out knowing that it's a little bit nebulous so they'll attack him then it becomes a huge
[1:56:01.900 --> 1:56:06.020]  story and then he'll go oh and find out everything he was saying it's like he knows how to get
[1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:11.060]  them to swallow the poison with the sugar coat or really for America the antidote with
[1:56:11.060 --> 1:56:15.580]  the poison coating I mean he really what is that tactic he I don't see other people doing
[1:56:15.580 --> 1:56:20.580]  that he's very skilled at it was my favorite law tactic and it's my favorite political
[1:56:20.580 --> 1:56:25.140]  tactic which I grew up on as a kid I always just caught the prayer rabbit strategy so
[1:56:25.140 --> 1:56:28.420]  prayer rabbit or the ghost comes from the great stories of us slaves used to tell to
[1:56:28.420 --> 1:56:32.260]  each other back in the 18 please don't throw me in the briar patch but he lives the briar
[1:56:32.260 --> 1:56:37.020]  patch that's exactly right and so how do you get someone to constantly throw you into the
[1:56:37.020 --> 1:56:41.180]  briar patch now you've got to be a prayer rabbit and he does it oh Trump is brilliant
[1:56:41.180 --> 1:56:46.060]  at he knows okay if I characterize it this way they're going to obsess over thinking
[1:56:46.060 --> 1:56:49.180]  they're going to be attacking me for it and in the process they're going to expose the
[1:56:49.180 --> 1:56:54.020]  issue I'm trying to expose and the end that's what's happened with Ukraine and Joe Biden
[1:56:54.020 --> 1:56:57.620]  that's what's happening with China and Joe Biden that's what's happening today with Hillary
[1:56:57.620 --> 1:57:02.340]  Clinton talking about trying to basically he's just putting out there when everybody knows
[1:57:02.340 --> 1:57:06.820]  it's going to be what's wrong with the left why are they so outclassed why are they something
[1:57:06.820 --> 1:57:11.060]  Cory Booker looks like he's taking a dump constantly Hillary looks like a demonic jack
[1:57:11.060 --> 1:57:16.100]  they're just scum well the political class as a whole has been emasculated don't really
[1:57:16.100 --> 1:57:20.780]  have old school political pros anymore you have these professional class politicians
[1:57:20.780 --> 1:57:24.300]  who are like the well you've got to have slime because even if you're corrupt you don't want
[1:57:24.300 --> 1:57:28.460]  to butcher a big powerful country for a pissing contest you'll you want to run it and so they
[1:57:28.460 --> 1:57:32.700]  so since these politicians are globalist minions they're just scum of the earth little
[1:57:32.700 --> 1:57:38.460]  follower nobodies yeah they're people who don't have independent identity don't have strength
[1:57:38.460 --> 1:57:42.580]  of backbone don't have poor character because of how they've been trained and tutored to
[1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:45.900]  be in this position in the first place so that that's what and that's what makes them
[1:57:45.900 --> 1:57:51.460]  weak against the president Robert Barnes top lawyer man in the arena stay with us five
[1:57:51.460 --> 1:57:56.300]  more minutes with you that you're going to call some William Benny comes on communist
[1:57:56.300 --> 1:58:01.220]  China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago and they've been approving almost
[1:58:01.220 --> 1:58:06.780]  all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years and now they
[1:58:06.780 --> 1:58:11.180]  own our debt now they own the Democratic Party now they've merged with Silicon Valley to

[1:58:28.220 --> 1:58:32.820]  right and that's why it's more important than ever that we override silicon valley and their

[2:00:18.980 --> 2:00:23.140]  robert barnes constitutional lawyer writing shot because i want him to ask a few key questions
[2:00:23.140 --> 2:00:28.700]  of this gentleman that can break it all down for us the coup against the president how
[2:00:28.700 --> 2:00:33.060]  it can be stopped ukraine all of it i wanted to read two quotes robert barnes and ask him
[2:00:33.060 --> 2:00:39.060]  which one he thinks is most important in our day and age the man in the arena teddy roosevelt
[2:00:39.060 --> 2:00:42.780]  it's not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strongman stumbles
[2:00:42.780 --> 2:00:46.860]  or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs the man who
[2:00:46.860 --> 2:00:51.460]  was actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly
[2:00:51.460 --> 2:00:57.740]  who hers who comes short again and again because there's no effort without air and shortcoming
[2:00:57.740 --> 2:01:02.340]  but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows the great enthusiasm is the great
[2:01:02.340 --> 2:01:07.420]  devotions who spends themselves in a worthy cause who at best knows in the end the triumph
[2:01:07.420 --> 2:01:12.700]  of high achievement and who at worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly
[2:01:12.700 --> 2:01:16.500]  so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory
[2:01:16.500 --> 2:01:22.460]  nor defeat that's a powerful speech he gave in paris after he'd been president over a
[2:01:22.460 --> 2:01:25.900]  hundred years ago now here's another one that goes to the enemies because that's a quote
[2:01:25.900 --> 2:01:30.540]  about good men and women taking action what about the bad guys a nation can survive its
[2:01:30.540 --> 2:01:36.580]  fools and even the ambitious but it cannot strive and survive treason from within an
[2:01:36.580 --> 2:01:41.020]  enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and carries his banner openly
[2:01:41.020 --> 2:01:45.660]  but the trader moves amongst those within the gate freely his sly whispers rustle through
[2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:49.700]  all the alleys heard in the very halls of government self for the trader appears not
[2:01:49.700 --> 2:01:53.660]  a trader he speaks in accents familiar to his victims and he wears their face in their
[2:01:53.660 --> 2:01:59.420]  arguments he appeals to their baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men he rots
[2:01:59.420 --> 2:02:04.380]  the soul of the nation he works secretly and the unknown in the night to undermine the
[2:02:04.380 --> 2:02:10.100]  pillars of the city he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist a murderer
[2:02:10.100 --> 2:02:16.940]  is less to fear the trader is the plague marcus tullius sissaro historian and roman senator
[2:02:16.940 --> 2:02:21.260]  in the time of course julia caesar in the beginning decline of roam your take on that
[2:02:21.260 --> 2:02:27.260]  and which which which one is more pertinent today or they both duly key i think the latter
[2:02:27.260 --> 2:02:32.500]  is the most pertinent because what you have is here you have the cia conspiring together
[2:02:32.500 --> 2:02:38.820]  with the inspector general of the intelligence community the weather counsel for the cia conspiring
[2:02:38.820 --> 2:02:43.780]  to change the rules retroactively back dating documents back dating rules so that they can
[2:02:43.780 --> 2:02:48.500]  have an illicit leak of information disguised as a legal whistleblower when you know bill
[2:02:48.500 --> 2:02:53.720]  bitty was a legitimate whistleblower and snowden was a legitimate whistleblower whatever people
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:57.940]  think of him he was legitimately blowing the whistle on corruption and lies by the highest
[2:02:57.940 --> 2:03:02.220]  ranking members of the obama administration these people are not whistleblowers these
[2:03:02.220 --> 2:03:07.900]  people are disguising their illicit spying their illicit leaks their illicit coup attempts
[2:03:07.900 --> 2:03:12.540]  as a whistleblower when they're not blowing the whistle on anybody or anything other than
[2:03:12.540 --> 2:03:17.200]  exposing deep state corruption by their own corruption and so the it's very much the latter
[2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:22.020]  because the greatest threat to american democracy and the greatest greatest threat to worldwide
[2:03:22.020 --> 2:03:27.100]  freedom is the continued foundation of american democracy functioning against the chinese
[2:03:27.100 --> 2:03:33.020]  model the chinese social credit system in its status driven economy social cultural order
[2:03:33.020 --> 2:03:38.780]  and for america to succeed that requires american freedoms to stay vibrant and that requires
[2:03:38.780 --> 2:03:42.620]  people like president trump to have success and be able to do the people's will and the
[2:03:42.620 --> 2:03:47.540]  greatest threat to that isn't from china externally it's from the deep state internally the deep
[2:03:47.540 --> 2:03:51.780]  state continues to try to undermine the president every turn and he sort of went through it
[2:03:51.780 --> 2:03:56.060]  with moeller tried to sort of uh... millerate them tried to deal with it now he recognizes
[2:03:56.060 --> 2:04:00.420]  the only way to deal with it is to double down to go in heavier to go in stronger to
[2:04:00.420 --> 2:04:04.860]  continue to be who he is and to do so in an unabashed unafraid manner so he needs to be
[2:04:04.860 --> 2:04:09.700]  that man in the arena but they and so in that part that of the boat is definitely relevant
[2:04:09.700 --> 2:04:13.860]  pertinent but the most pertinent part is that our current greatest threat is the efforts
[2:04:13.860 --> 2:04:17.900]  of the deep state to completely undermine and got american democracy by attacking the
[2:04:17.900 --> 2:04:21.660]  one man who represents america's will about how we should change our policies around
[2:04:21.660 --> 2:04:25.260]  the world particularly as it relates to war particularly as it relates to trade particularly
[2:04:25.260 --> 2:04:31.780]  as it relates to china more than anything that's right and this is china's tool that
[2:04:31.780 --> 2:04:36.300]  this guy is really china's agent because china is we're finally fighting back against china
[2:04:36.300 --> 2:04:40.460]  we're finally resisting their social credit system with the big tech company collusion
[2:04:40.460 --> 2:04:45.140]  we're finally resisting their efforts to steal all our manufacturing jobs finally refusing
[2:04:45.140 --> 2:04:49.020]  their efforts to dominate world affairs and at that very juncture is when the deep state
[2:04:49.020 --> 2:04:53.380]  is trying to undermine the president when trump says the long surrender to china is
[2:04:53.380 --> 2:04:58.220]  over and then now the deep state on their payroll comes after them it's so clear now
[2:04:58.220 --> 2:05:01.900]  we know why they're so desperate great answer thank you so much we'll be right back only
[2:05:01.900 --> 2:05:09.060]  in benioan robber baronson as the world awakens of the fact that info wars was right that
[2:05:09.060 --> 2:05:13.860]  alex jones was right i could sit here and do a victory lap but folks we don't have time

[2:06:34.900 --> 2:06:40.340]  of the time into chinese that 14 months ago openly said that i should be taken off the
[2:06:40.340 --> 2:06:47.620]  year by name gg ping said it's time for america to crack down on fake news and then gg ping
[2:06:47.620 --> 2:06:53.340]  praised them when i and others were taken off now the leader of the senate had his twitter
[2:06:53.340 --> 2:06:58.580]  frozen when he dared criticize people coming to his house threatening to murder him that's
[2:06:58.580 --> 2:07:02.460]  the point we've gotten to now william benny joins us via the phone we're very honored
[2:07:02.460 --> 2:07:06.820]  to have him very appreciative constitutional lawyer and a big fan of william benny robert
[2:07:06.820 --> 2:07:11.460]  barnes is here like barnes was in studio about two weeks ago praising william benny as a
[2:07:11.460 --> 2:07:16.180]  real whistleblower versus a fake whistleblower and breaking down the law and how it's supposed
[2:07:16.180 --> 2:07:20.020]  to work and that's when i thought wow let's get william benny on so when i learned we
[2:07:20.020 --> 2:07:25.100]  could get benny on yesterday i called barnes a famous constitutional lawyer very successful
[2:07:25.100 --> 2:07:29.460]  also criminal lawyer first-member lawyer so that he could have some questions of benny
[2:07:29.460 --> 2:07:34.340]  that are a little bit more let's just say expertise than mine but william benny has
[2:07:34.340 --> 2:07:39.860]  obviously uh been been critical as the former technical director of the nsa of the so-called
[2:07:39.860 --> 2:07:45.620]  new whistleblowers that are going to testify in secret uh from cct kit cctv camera blacked
[2:07:45.620 --> 2:07:50.580]  out uh the president can't face his accuser unprecedented all the rules have been changed
[2:07:50.580 --> 2:07:55.620]  this isn't a real impeachment process because trump can't even uh have to process and i know
[2:07:55.620 --> 2:07:59.700]  that when we got william benny set up your stay we asked him what do you want to cover first
[2:08:00.260 --> 2:08:05.700]  and he said exactly what we wanted him to cover before we told him and that's what's really happening
[2:08:05.700 --> 2:08:11.300]  with these so-called whistleblowers because again he is a real whistleblower who actually
[2:08:11.300 --> 2:08:15.860]  exposed illegal spying and then was persecuted for it even though he did it through the proper channel
[2:08:15.860 --> 2:08:20.980]  so we see the left attacking trump and saying he's attacking the press and whistleblowers when he
[2:08:20.980 --> 2:08:26.740]  defends himself he's not arresting members of the press he's not uh persecuting whistleblowers
[2:08:26.740 --> 2:08:32.980]  like obama did like obama swat team rated william benny highly decorated patriot equivalent of a
[2:08:32.980 --> 2:08:38.980]  multi-star general running the nsa so william benny thank you for joining us uh sir exposed
[2:08:38.980 --> 2:08:45.460]  fax dot org a good american dot org uh pg uh knowledge dot e you some of the great sites that
[2:08:45.460 --> 2:08:50.740]  have your work you were the top technical advisor of course all over stone on his incredible film
[2:08:51.940 --> 2:08:56.580]  out of the park snowton so we're very honored to have you here uh and so we probably should
[2:08:56.580 --> 2:09:00.820]  start with a brief recap for folks that don't know who you are we have new literature all the time
[2:09:00.820 --> 2:09:04.740]  about your whistleblowing what happened to use they have some context of why you're such a
[2:09:04.740 --> 2:09:09.380]  primitive expert on this but thank you for joining us sir well thanks for having me alex it's always
[2:09:09.380 --> 2:09:15.140]  good to be on your show and talk about these issues so yeah i uh my my uh whistleblowing
[2:09:15.140 --> 2:09:22.420]  started back in uh 2001 when they first started nsa did uh actually was bush cheney hayden and
[2:09:22.420 --> 2:09:29.620]  tenet who uh set this up initially and it was to spy on everybody and in the inside the united
[2:09:29.620 --> 2:09:35.940]  states u.s citizens everybody and it was to take in everything starting with the metadata from the
[2:09:35.940 --> 2:09:41.700]  from different companies like a tnt and verizon and so on um and then it's up to something like
[2:09:41.700 --> 2:09:48.340]  78 other companies now uh and the whole idea was to bring in all the information you possibly could
[2:09:48.340 --> 2:09:54.580]  on every u.s citizens so you could decide their inclinations actually get into the thinking process
[2:09:54.580 --> 2:10:00.580]  what their opinions were that well you know uh who they were organized like this is the material
[2:10:00.580 --> 2:10:08.340]  they used to go at the tea party with the irs you know it's uh it's uh it just gives them all
[2:10:08.340 --> 2:10:14.820]  kinds of leverage and power over everybody in the country um and uh that was uh started in uh
[2:10:16.820 --> 2:10:22.820]  the second week in october of 2001 and by the by the third to fourth week of that month i was
[2:10:22.820 --> 2:10:31.060]  complaining to the in the house intelligence committee members um also we took it uh my group
[2:10:31.060 --> 2:10:37.780]  you know the five uh people who were involved four from uh four from nsa and one from the house
[2:10:37.780 --> 2:10:42.420]  intelligence committee we took that through we even tried to speak to the chief justice of the
[2:10:42.420 --> 2:10:48.980]  supreme court um at the time and he refused to see us to be i'm sure the bureaucrats got to him so
[2:10:48.980 --> 2:10:53.540]  they bypassed us and kept us away from him so i mean they didn't want anybody hearing about this at
[2:10:53.540 --> 2:10:59.540]  the time so and it was all being done basically in secret with only very few people knowing um
[2:10:59.540 --> 2:11:05.220]  nancy plosy was one of the ones who bought into it right up front with the it was in a early meeting
[2:11:05.220 --> 2:11:12.900]  in um i think it was the fourth of november of 2001 she and port ergos graham and and shelby from
[2:11:12.900 --> 2:11:17.780]  the senate side that the gang of four the chairs and ranking members of the house and senate
[2:11:17.780 --> 2:11:22.900]  intelligence committees they were the first ones briefed in this in early november uh not just the
[2:11:22.900 --> 2:11:27.620]  nsa programs but also the cia programs and to be clear this is when and you're absolutely right
[2:11:27.620 --> 2:11:31.620]  bush and them helped start all this and then through obama it was bipartisan evil uh but i
[2:11:31.620 --> 2:11:35.380]  want to get in when you got actually targeted and swat team and the rest of it right i just want
[2:11:35.380 --> 2:11:40.820]  to recap and obama it's simply he doubled down on everything that bush and cheney when adin and
[2:11:40.820 --> 2:11:46.900]  tenet were doing so uh and that's basically why adin stuck around if you know what i mean and the
[2:11:46.900 --> 2:11:52.020]  big takeaway you always point out is that we were really targeting actually bad actors and not
[2:11:52.020 --> 2:11:56.500]  violating anybody's rights before and it was more effective but this was being done for political
[2:11:56.500 --> 2:12:02.020]  control but also makes us less safe which makes it beyond the dereliction of duty doesn't it i mean
[2:12:02.020 --> 2:12:07.380]  it's an it's a criminal action absolutely it's a violation of the constitution and any number of
[2:12:08.020 --> 2:12:13.060]  criminal ass statutes the pen registered law the electronic privacy act electronic security act
[2:12:13.060 --> 2:12:17.780]  things of that nature plus all the FCC regulations governing telecommunications companies that's why
[2:12:17.780 --> 2:12:23.060]  they had to give them retroactive immunity you know the unconditional retroactive immunity because
[2:12:23.060 --> 2:12:28.420]  of all the crimes they were committing so and then uh you know so we took that and we also
[2:12:28.420 --> 2:12:34.020]  complained to the department of justice inspector general and the department of defense inspector
[2:12:34.020 --> 2:12:39.060]  generals so you know we went through the proper channels and all that got us was noticed i mean
[2:12:39.060 --> 2:12:43.220]  the inspector general for the department of defense is the guy who turned over our names
[2:12:43.220 --> 2:12:49.140]  the fbi is the most likely candidates for the uh uh new york times article uh exposing
[2:12:49.140 --> 2:12:54.020]  warrantless wiretapping well i mean that was simply a lie to begin with and the nsa knew that
[2:12:54.020 --> 2:12:58.340]  because they already and the fbi did too because they already knew that thomas tan was the member
[2:12:58.340 --> 2:13:02.580]  was the guy who was the source there and they also knew that we had no contact whatsoever
[2:13:02.580 --> 2:13:06.340]  with anybody in the fbi so just recapping this i know i took you there is it's important but i
[2:13:06.340 --> 2:13:09.700]  want to get into what's currently happening you went through the process you went to congress
[2:13:09.700 --> 2:13:14.340]  you went to the system and then they set you up and tried to put you in prison and if it wasn't
[2:13:14.340 --> 2:13:19.540]  for somebody that gave you inside info to save you to show you how you were set up with parallel
[2:13:19.540 --> 2:13:24.100]  construction uh then you would have gone to prison and then obviously you don't like to talk
[2:13:24.100 --> 2:13:30.180]  about it here i mean it's just incredible yeah yeah they attacked us and fabricated data fabricated
[2:13:30.180 --> 2:13:34.820]  evidence against us and and we caught them at it so and we threatened them with malicious prosecution
[2:13:34.820 --> 2:13:41.300]  that's why they went away so they've not bothered us since the 2009 2010 time frame and so what is
[2:13:41.300 --> 2:13:45.860]  it like for you to hear how horrible trump is to whistleblowers and to the media when it was
[2:13:45.860 --> 2:13:51.460]  obama that was said it was horrible the whistleblowers like this i think this guy that came out i call
[2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:56.660]  him a rumor blower he's not a whistleblower i mean to apply the whistleblower term to him it's
[2:13:56.660 --> 2:14:02.740]  kind of cheapens and degrades what true whistleblowers are i mean we're any any true whistleblower
[2:14:02.740 --> 2:14:07.540]  by the way it doesn't matter what law they pass has been attacked by the intelligence community
[2:14:07.540 --> 2:14:12.900]  they had attacked them everyone has been persecuted they sent the jail or otherwise sure these these
[2:14:12.900 --> 2:14:17.700]  are political wonks that want to continue their deep state coup over america i want to remove
[2:14:17.700 --> 2:14:22.900]  the president in my view so they're just simply uh making all this up in a cia coup against america
[2:14:22.900 --> 2:14:28.020]  that's what i see it as what is it no that's that's exactly what it is yeah and those are the people
[2:14:28.020 --> 2:14:33.700]  that need to go to jail we need to put those people in jail that's my view personally right we're
[2:14:33.700 --> 2:14:37.540]  going to walk through all this with william benny but i for just one more segment constitutional
[2:14:37.540 --> 2:14:40.980]  lawyer robert barneson ride shotgun one more segment but robert what are some of the questions
[2:14:40.980 --> 2:14:45.700]  you've got for benny when we come back oh i think some good questions are how this overlaps with the
[2:14:45.700 --> 2:14:50.500]  impeachment inquiry and what the president has been up to investigating how a lot of this is about
[2:14:50.500 --> 2:14:55.700]  protecting a bill did a great job showing how crowd strike it was how there there are technical
[2:14:55.700 --> 2:15:00.820]  deficiencies and there are various reports of misattribution uh the misallocation of how the
[2:15:00.820 --> 2:15:04.740]  what bill is documenting is how the intelligence committees in congress have become captured
[2:15:04.740 --> 2:15:09.460]  by the intelligence community and tools of the intelligence community they're not frank church's
[2:15:09.460 --> 2:15:14.660]  legacy that was meant to supervise and monitor the intelligence community so i think about how this
[2:15:14.660 --> 2:15:20.580]  overlaps deeply with the invested with both impeachment and impeachment's attempt to cover up
[2:15:20.580 --> 2:15:25.540]  like moeller the underlying criminal activity of the obama administration and the bush administration
[2:15:25.540 --> 2:15:30.340]  and prior administrations and illegal spying on americans that extended to carter page and the
[2:15:30.340 --> 2:15:35.060]  trump campaign so i think it would be good to discuss how these all these issues inter overlap
[2:15:35.060 --> 2:15:40.580]  how they're all right we got the expert william benny former technical head of the nsa respect
[2:15:40.580 --> 2:15:44.900]  is one of the top code breaker mathematicians in history undoubted genius he doesn't like to brag
[2:15:44.900 --> 2:15:49.460]  about himself he also clear evidence he got poisoned they tried to kill him after he testified

[2:20:38.900 --> 2:20:42.500]  brilliant benny former head of the national security agency technical
[2:20:42.500 --> 2:20:48.900]  actually ran it not the politician in charge of the number two is here and he is the expert to
[2:20:48.900 --> 2:20:54.100]  talk about these so-called whistleblowers the first one third hand now they won't even say who it is
[2:20:55.220 --> 2:21:00.340]  the head of the intelligence committee chef adam schiff reading a fake transcript and the msnvc
[2:21:00.340 --> 2:21:07.220]  putting it out these are bizarre tactics let me ask william benny what he thinks is going on i mean
[2:21:07.220 --> 2:21:14.340]  i mean we hit the break and please get into that more you were saying this is a deep state coup
[2:21:15.380 --> 2:21:19.140]  get into how you know that why you know that and who you think the players are and what the
[2:21:19.140 --> 2:21:23.060]  president can do to counter that and then just your expertise on what we're facing here with
[2:21:23.060 --> 2:21:31.300]  these fake whistleblowers say start off by just looking at the timeline of this new whistleblower
[2:21:31.300 --> 2:21:37.460]  how it came up came to pass it 25th of july is the phone call between the presidents of the u.s
[2:21:37.460 --> 2:21:45.140]  and the and the ukraine and then by the first of august the dn is inspector general changes the
[2:21:45.140 --> 2:21:52.340]  regulation for accepting whistleblower complaints to must have originally and it it should still
[2:21:52.340 --> 2:21:56.980]  be must have firsthand information or knowledge of the events you're blowing the whistle on
[2:21:56.980 --> 2:22:06.420]  to could could input from here and accept hearsay and so then 11 days after that the fellows
[2:22:07.620 --> 2:22:15.460]  complaint hits the the dni ig office so but in between that this whistleblower is talking to
[2:22:16.020 --> 2:22:22.260]  shifty ship and and his crew and i guess they're having the lawyers that work with them to form
[2:22:22.260 --> 2:22:29.540]  and and right at the hearsay complaint so as far as i could see from the beginning it was a
[2:22:29.540 --> 2:22:36.500]  fabrication and the entire thing was being set up and sponsored and supported by those embedded
[2:22:36.500 --> 2:22:44.260]  people a part of that the secret government the the secret the secret cabal that's running our country
[2:22:46.980 --> 2:22:51.540]  how do you think the president should counter this well well first off how serious is his threat
[2:22:51.540 --> 2:22:56.820]  but from being you know at the head of the nsa then being a real whistleblower and then living
[2:22:56.820 --> 2:23:02.260]  through this the last 20 years or so gut level what would you say i mean i know you briefed the
[2:23:02.260 --> 2:23:05.460]  white house you briefed the president before and you're not supposed to get into all that but if
[2:23:05.460 --> 2:23:08.740]  you were briefing the president right now it's a good chance we can get this to the president what
[2:23:08.740 --> 2:23:16.660]  would you say i would say send the fbi and bar's attorney general's people office to investigate
[2:23:16.660 --> 2:23:21.940]  the the dni inspector general started with him because somebody got to him to get him to change
[2:23:21.940 --> 2:23:27.860]  the regulation and who that was you should follow the trace of that evidence that you can get from
[2:23:27.860 --> 2:23:33.060]  that investigation but at this point he would not be able to lie to the fbi then he'd be subject
[2:23:33.060 --> 2:23:38.740]  to the same that everyone else has been that being able to go to jail for i don't know three to five
[2:23:38.740 --> 2:23:44.980]  years or something like that so you know that would put the uh that would put the uh fear in the
[2:23:44.980 --> 2:23:49.140]  a fear of god in these people and then they start to blow the whistle on one another and
[2:23:49.140 --> 2:23:54.580]  they all start falling apart my understanding is that that's already started that's what i'm hearing
[2:23:55.940 --> 2:24:01.140]  well that's my next question from all of your sources that are unparalleled really we can't
[2:24:01.140 --> 2:24:06.580]  overstate those we hear that there are indictments of mccabe and others we know that the deputy
[2:24:06.580 --> 2:24:11.700]  attorney general uh said a few weeks ago that they're not going to kill the indictments out there
[2:24:11.700 --> 2:24:16.100]  because that's where they would try to appeal that before it happened can you speak to that and what
[2:24:16.100 --> 2:24:22.900]  other intel you've gotten mr benning uh well all i can say is i mean i'm i'm giving you hearsay again
[2:24:22.900 --> 2:24:30.580]  but you know so my part is hearsay also so but uh my understanding is that the indictments are not
[2:24:30.580 --> 2:24:36.740]  that far away i'm thinking in terms of maybe a couple weeks uh and uh that uh there's a number
[2:24:36.740 --> 2:24:42.020]  of people who are um and you can see that by durham's expansion of the investigation it's
[2:24:42.020 --> 2:24:48.180]  going into many different things and uh the tentacles of this investigation and the indictments
[2:24:48.180 --> 2:24:55.380]  i think are going to expand over time there will be an initial round uh early on in a couple of
[2:24:55.380 --> 2:25:01.860]  weeks i think uh but then uh from there on then there'll be a a whole host of others cascading
[2:25:01.860 --> 2:25:07.220]  down through the next few months and beyond hearsay we do have the deputy attorney general
[2:25:07.220 --> 2:25:12.180]  when they came to them and said hey don't you'll kill this indictment they said no and then on top
[2:25:12.180 --> 2:25:17.140]  of that uh with the investigation that you mentioned of durham they're running around like
[2:25:17.140 --> 2:25:22.420]  chickens with their heads cut off the panicked response of the deep state bipartisanly i think
[2:25:22.420 --> 2:25:28.100]  shows that trump is making his move and trump is says he's going after robert barnes and i think
[2:25:28.100 --> 2:25:33.220]  the other thing that the whole backdrop to what is happening the backdrop to ukraine backdrop to
[2:25:33.220 --> 2:25:39.140]  spygate the backdrop to molar the backdrop to impeachment uh all of it really relates to these
[2:25:39.140 --> 2:25:44.500]  deep state rogue actions that bill was trying to expose the blow the whistle on almost 20 years
[2:25:44.500 --> 2:25:49.620]  ago and what is this all the chickens have come home to roost and so i was going to ask bill about
[2:25:49.620 --> 2:25:53.780]  because the i mean the dunham investigation is going to implicate crowd strike it's going to
[2:25:53.780 --> 2:25:59.220]  implicate uh various rogue actors in ukraine uh it's going to implicate the five eyes it's going
[2:25:59.220 --> 2:26:04.820]  to implicate the weaponization of the nsa technology to be able to spy on americans
[2:26:04.820 --> 2:26:09.700]  involved in the illicit use of the carter page investigation is probably going to expose to
[2:26:09.700 --> 2:26:14.260]  some degree the foreign intelligence surveillance court and bill was earlier talking about oh yeah
[2:26:14.260 --> 2:26:20.260]  going to achieve justice yeah could you talk about that some more bill yeah because uh
[2:26:20.260 --> 2:26:29.780]  uh see the for many years uh you know that they have been lied to by by various
[2:26:29.780 --> 2:26:33.780]  organizations various organizations in the intelligence community they have known this
[2:26:33.780 --> 2:26:38.660]  and have refused to actually hold their feet to the fire and do anything so this court is
[2:26:38.660 --> 2:26:45.460]  basically a worthless court that needs to be uh basically disbanded and we we don't need a court
[2:26:45.460 --> 2:26:50.580]  like that we just put all this stuff into article three courts not this i call this an article two
[2:26:50.580 --> 2:26:54.740]  court because it it meets on the sixth floor i think it is of the department of justice building
[2:26:54.740 --> 2:27:00.100]  and only here's the government so there's no no uh other side you presented to the judge
[2:27:00.100 --> 2:27:05.620]  to make a decision so it's a star chamber echo chamber yeah yeah that's it
[2:27:07.060 --> 2:27:12.100]  i don't know what came out this week bill uh can you comment on that in terms of more releases
[2:27:12.100 --> 2:27:16.340]  that even the FISA court which has a been as you know a rubber stamp for the intelligence
[2:27:16.340 --> 2:27:22.660]  community was voicing concern about the scope scale and size of fbi spying on americans on a
[2:27:22.660 --> 2:27:28.180]  routinized regularized basis in recent years see what that is is they're going into the nsa
[2:27:28.180 --> 2:27:33.860]  database and i've got slides showing that from their from the government that stoden had released
[2:27:33.860 --> 2:27:40.100]  showing that how they how they access that data directly without any oversight whatsoever and and
[2:27:40.100 --> 2:27:45.300]  uh you know they can do that at without without anybody knowing what they're doing basically
[2:27:45.300 --> 2:27:50.180]  unless you went into the network log and look to see exactly what they were asking the uh
[2:27:50.180 --> 2:27:55.140]  for them from the database if you didn't do that you had no concept of what they were involved in
[2:27:55.140 --> 2:27:59.940]  so that i mean but that's not the first time i mean this has been periodically down through
[2:27:59.940 --> 2:28:04.820]  the years you hear from cases now and then when the FISA court is objecting to something that
[2:28:04.820 --> 2:28:14.260]  nsa or analysts are doing or fbi or something and as early as the 2002 i think was august in 2002
[2:28:14.260 --> 2:28:20.660]  when when the FISA court found out the fbi had lied to them and to get 75 warrants and so this
[2:28:20.660 --> 2:28:25.300]  is a long-standing problem that they've known about for years and years it's it's a deep state
[2:28:25.300 --> 2:28:28.900]  that's arrogant that believes it owns the country and is now trying to carry out a coup as william

[2:34:33.380 --> 2:34:40.740]  stuff that was hijacked by the deep state in 2001 they used 9-11 as their pretext so so getting back
[2:34:40.740 --> 2:34:46.340]  to you sir uh i want to keep barns on as he's a big fan of yours uh something he he's gone now
[2:34:46.340 --> 2:34:54.180]  now i want to give you some time to recap and lay out how big this is where you think it's going
[2:34:54.900 --> 2:34:59.940]  and then i want to get your take on communist china the most authoritarian country in history i
[2:34:59.940 --> 2:35:06.100]  think that's hands down that's not debated really flexing its muscles over american companies now
[2:35:06.100 --> 2:35:10.980]  and the backdrop of big tech moving to china google and apple moving their codes there their
[2:35:10.980 --> 2:35:17.300]  operations there their code keys there for apple and then china telling everybody from video game
[2:35:17.300 --> 2:35:25.860]  makers to uh tiffany's jewelry to the mba how high to jump when they snap their fingers it's just
[2:35:26.900 --> 2:35:33.460]  really a crossroads right now of what's our values what are we going to choose so so please
[2:35:33.460 --> 2:35:39.860]  from your particular or expertise break that down for us your view my view is pretty simple
[2:35:39.860 --> 2:35:44.980]  i think it's pretty much like you uh alex i i you know these people think they can
[2:35:45.700 --> 2:35:51.620]  because they they they give people all kinds of money and bribes and so on that they can get
[2:35:51.620 --> 2:35:57.940]  them to do whatever they want so in other words he who's he who has the money runs the show and
[2:35:57.940 --> 2:36:01.700]  that's basically the view they are and that's basically a communist view that's fundamentally
[2:36:01.700 --> 2:36:07.780]  what communism was all about you know it was a matter of how how can we uh control everybody
[2:36:07.780 --> 2:36:12.820]  and they're doing it they're trying to do to it with money instead of having a war like in the old
[2:36:12.820 --> 2:36:19.060]  days in the in the 1900s you know with the world war one and two and so on it was a matter of the
[2:36:19.060 --> 2:36:23.460]  using military power to control the world here they're trying to use it the money to control
[2:36:23.460 --> 2:36:31.460]  the world so i don't see any difference between that and and what what the older dictatorships
[2:36:31.460 --> 2:36:37.540]  we're doing trying to trying to take take uh take control of other countries directly or indirectly
[2:36:37.540 --> 2:36:42.580]  by force or by not you know they're absolutely right and i mean look at silicon valley you
[2:36:42.580 --> 2:36:46.900]  shouldn't buy into this i mean this is something if you don't stand up i mean trump is the only
[2:36:46.900 --> 2:36:53.060]  one who stood up for these people i mean everybody else has just bought into it oh let's just go along
[2:36:53.060 --> 2:36:58.660]  to get along and sooner or later we we hope they'll come they'll come our way and turn around to do
[2:36:58.660 --> 2:37:03.780]  the right thing and and with communist governments the first thing you should know is that's not
[2:37:03.780 --> 2:37:10.420]  going to happen you are credited with helping bring down the soviet union breaking all their
[2:37:10.420 --> 2:37:13.540]  codes and basically being able to listen everything they were doing i know most of that's still
[2:37:13.540 --> 2:37:22.180]  classified highly but how would you take on china literally buying up hollywood uh buying up reddit
[2:37:22.180 --> 2:37:27.460]  banning the donald i mean they're just in our business everywhere i know for a fact they've
[2:37:27.460 --> 2:37:34.340]  been financing and promoting silencing uh patriots uh with silicon valley as i said earlier zizi ping
[2:37:34.340 --> 2:37:39.060]  praised to the wall street journal and others when i and others got banned last year that's just
[2:37:39.060 --> 2:37:45.780]  a total abandonment of american values yes it is it's totally it's like they just like negating
[2:37:45.780 --> 2:37:51.460]  the entire constitution fundamentally you have the right to free speech and no one should have
[2:37:51.460 --> 2:37:56.900]  a right to stop you from doing that and that that also gets into journalism and the first
[2:37:56.900 --> 2:38:01.780]  amendment for supportive journalists and and investigative journalism although i would say
[2:38:01.780 --> 2:38:07.380]  our mainstream media is failing miserably at that these days so you know it's a matter of them also
[2:38:07.380 --> 2:38:15.380]  co-opting being co-opted into there's so many subjects i've got hundreds of questions for
[2:38:15.380 --> 2:38:18.020]  you we've got some breaking news i'll get to in a moment that ties into this but
[2:38:19.620 --> 2:38:23.220]  what else is on your radar what else do you want to impart to this audience i think you keep going
[2:38:23.220 --> 2:38:28.900]  back to it it's only trump taking these people on and i don't think the average person realizes
[2:38:28.900 --> 2:38:34.980]  how once once in a lifetime this is how rare this is yeah i don't i don't think people understand
[2:38:34.980 --> 2:38:41.220]  it either uh one of the things i we're focusing on in in now is how can we make our elections
[2:38:42.500 --> 2:38:50.340]  reliable and and valid in other words how can we detect uh people who are not eligible to vote
[2:38:50.340 --> 2:38:57.140]  when they register at the polling stations uh and we have a way of doing that and that's already
[2:38:57.140 --> 2:39:03.620]  kirk and i webe and i have designed that already and we're we are looking to try to implement that
[2:39:03.620 --> 2:39:08.820]  in the state and we have a few governors and attorney generals who are interested
[2:39:09.860 --> 2:39:17.140]  and we hope to be able to do that before the 2020 election that's exciting dr benny tell us more
[2:39:17.140 --> 2:39:24.180]  about that well it's a matter of how do you validate your voter rolls for example the judicial
[2:39:24.180 --> 2:39:28.900]  watch is found the recent evidence they found is that there's three and a half million more people
[2:39:28.900 --> 2:39:34.580]  registered to vote than are eligible to vote in the country so that means there's three and a half
[2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:40.580]  million people who aren't citizens voting either that or they're dead citizens or things of that
[2:39:40.580 --> 2:39:46.500]  nature so uh it's a matter of how do you how do you validate that while there's certain information
[2:39:46.500 --> 2:39:53.380]  pools that will allow you to do that fairly quickly one is the social security database of
[2:39:54.100 --> 2:39:58.740]  people who are still living what their ages are what their eligibility is anybody with a social
[2:39:58.740 --> 2:40:03.060]  security number is basically a citizen and they've got a birth certificate and so on so
[2:40:04.180 --> 2:40:09.540]  all of that plays into it you could use that data to help do it you can also use the phone records
[2:40:09.540 --> 2:40:15.780]  the phone books and all that people who were living in certain areas that locations and names
[2:40:15.780 --> 2:40:22.340]  and so on and you can always use the census bureau data things of that nature to also do that
[2:40:23.140 --> 2:40:29.780]  so there's a myriad set of data you could use even even you know department of motor vehicle
[2:40:29.780 --> 2:40:34.900]  registration that kind of thing helps and gives you information about people who live in the state
[2:40:35.540 --> 2:40:41.140]  so all those things put together when you mash them all into one you have a very very simple
[2:40:41.140 --> 2:40:49.620]  validating whether or not somebody is eligible to vote before they vote you can do this in real
[2:40:49.620 --> 2:40:55.460]  time i'm saying maybe two to three seconds after they punch their name in at the polling station
[2:40:55.460 --> 2:41:01.700]  you should have an answer as to whether or not they're eligible or not well we know as judicial
[2:41:01.700 --> 2:41:09.220]  watch goes around the country from mariland to california they're finding 1.5 million a million
[2:41:09.220 --> 2:41:15.380]  900 000 depending on the state 1.5 million in california of people that weren't eligibility on
[2:41:15.380 --> 2:41:20.100]  the rolls or who were dead but that people were voting in the names of dead people so this is going
[2:41:20.100 --> 2:41:25.940]  on yeah and that was just in the la area the one point whatever million that was just a sample
[2:41:25.940 --> 2:41:33.940]  that's right yeah yeah yeah so i mean we have we have designed a way to be able to to see through
[2:41:33.940 --> 2:41:40.020]  all of that go through correct the rolls before the voting occurs and then also be able to to
[2:41:41.220 --> 2:41:44.260]  catch people and validate them as they register at the polling places
[2:41:45.620 --> 2:41:49.860]  i want to come back from break in our final segment how time flies with william benning
[2:41:49.860 --> 2:41:57.460]  and i want to get into this breaking news very very serious developments here where a whistleblower
[2:41:57.460 --> 2:42:03.860]  uh supposed whistleblower i mean a leaker has been indicted uh and so we'll talk about that
[2:42:04.500 --> 2:42:09.780]  is it really a whistleblower is it really a leaker uh we'll look at that when we come back
[2:42:09.780 --> 2:42:14.020]  that is breaking right now major new leak indictment unsealed and federal court at
[2:42:14.020 --> 2:42:20.340]  alexandria dia employee henry fresh charged with leaking multiple highly classified reports
[2:42:20.340 --> 2:42:26.580]  to the media indictment from court doc doc it will cover that when we come back and then i
[2:42:26.580 --> 2:42:31.940]  want to ask william benning about the mindset of the clappers and the brennans that tell congress
[2:42:31.940 --> 2:42:36.260]  that there's never been any spying against citizens and tell these ball face lies like
[2:42:36.260 --> 2:42:43.060]  saying the atlantic ocean is it wet and what he predicts they'll do as they get more and more
[2:42:43.060 --> 2:42:49.380]  cornered and is it almost a dereliction of duty if they all don't get indicted i mean and we just
[2:42:49.380 --> 2:42:55.940]  leave these crooks in place william benning is our guest expose facts dot org a good american
[2:42:55.940 --> 2:43:00.820]  dot org and pg knowledge dot e you those aren't his sites but has a lot of his important research

[2:43:08.900 --> 2:43:13.940]  hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover the censorship all of it that's why they
[2:43:13.940 --> 2:43:19.140]  took me off the air first and banned me across the internet because they knew that what we were
[2:43:19.140 --> 2:43:24.180]  saying was dead on and they didn't want us raising the alarm well guess what thanks to you spreading

[2:44:33.140 --> 2:44:38.260]  blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right and that's why it's more important than ever
[2:44:38.260 --> 2:44:43.460]  that we override silicon valley and their chai kong masters by word of mouth and spread the word

[2:45:21.860 --> 2:45:28.660]  coms so it's naked it's brazen this is the point when the enemy emerges it's like before world war
[2:45:28.660 --> 2:45:33.300]  two the polls kept warning that nazi germany was going to attack them nobody believed them
[2:45:33.300 --> 2:45:38.980]  as they saw the troops massing until it finally happened we're at that same point and we're all
[2:45:38.980 --> 2:45:44.020]  paul revere's who need to be out there warning everyone about what's unfolding because this
[2:45:44.020 --> 2:45:50.260]  is the critical fight and thank god america and the world is waking up at the eleventh hour 58

[2:46:39.940 --> 2:46:45.060]  on tv they're totally pissing angry people like why are they angry because they see all of their
[2:46:45.060 --> 2:46:51.140]  freedom their american freedom hard fought taken away are you gonna get upset well you're a listener
[2:46:51.140 --> 2:46:55.780]  you're obviously are upset but you've got to ring the alarm everywhere until others they've got to
[2:46:55.780 --> 2:47:00.740]  get upset and then take action and let congress everybody else know that we're not backing down
[2:47:00.740 --> 2:47:06.500]  and we're not going to sell america out of the chicoms
[2:47:08.260 --> 2:47:10.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:10.900 --> 2:47:18.660]  so
[2:47:30.260 --> 2:47:33.780]  welcome back william benny former technical director of the national security agency
[2:47:34.420 --> 2:47:37.140]  is here probably one of the biggest whistleblowers in history
[2:47:37.140 --> 2:47:42.580]  just let me know i mean he had it up he exposed to the government what was happening snowden
[2:47:43.460 --> 2:47:49.300]  released his to the world you'd call it leaking um but i still think snowden uh is a hero
[2:47:50.180 --> 2:47:55.460]  we could talk about a sign you know how does trump say whoever's got it it's illegal emails
[2:47:55.460 --> 2:48:00.660]  release hillary's emails that was an endorsement of all of what he leaks did but i think julina
[2:48:00.660 --> 2:48:05.140]  signs really should be released i think he's been persecuted i know trump thinks they're gonna try
[2:48:05.140 --> 2:48:09.460]  to then say that he's a traitor if he doesn't but i think that's one of the big areas that the
[2:48:09.460 --> 2:48:14.260]  trump has failed i don't think william benny's take on that briefly as well but we have this
[2:48:14.260 --> 2:48:20.820]  breaking major new leak indictment unsealed in federal court now alexandria had dia defense
[2:48:20.820 --> 2:48:26.100]  intelligence agency employee henry fresh charged with leaking multiple highly classified reports
[2:48:26.100 --> 2:48:29.460]  to the media we have the indictment i haven't had time to read the whole thing and i
[2:48:29.460 --> 2:48:34.900]  i stand over it but how do you quantify if somebody's a whistleblower if they try to go
[2:48:34.900 --> 2:48:41.460]  through the regular challenge uh sources and aren't and then leak to the press uh and you
[2:48:41.460 --> 2:48:45.380]  know we know that there's been selective leaks try to misrepresent what trump's doing to bring
[2:48:45.380 --> 2:48:49.940]  him down we see brennan and clapper telling people to leak to the press isn't that encouraging
[2:48:49.940 --> 2:48:54.980]  people to commit a crime at least under obama standards william benny actually if you go by
[2:48:54.980 --> 2:49:01.700]  the regulations uh if if what they're leaking or talking about and exposing as a whistleblower
[2:49:02.260 --> 2:49:09.780]  is something criminal uh evidence of a crime uh or fraud waste abuse things of that nature
[2:49:10.820 --> 2:49:17.300]  that's all covered under executive order 13526 section 1.7 that governs classification for the
[2:49:17.300 --> 2:49:23.700]  united entire united states of a government and it says you cannot classify any information you
[2:49:23.700 --> 2:49:30.020]  and you must declassify anything that's evidence of a crime corruption fraud waste
[2:49:30.020 --> 2:49:36.180]  abuse and several other things so for example the material that we were we were complaining
[2:49:36.180 --> 2:49:41.780]  about to the inspector generals and the intelligence committees were were basically evidence of
[2:49:41.780 --> 2:49:48.340]  corruption and fraud and waste inside nsa and constitutional violations scrapping the constitution
[2:49:48.340 --> 2:49:54.820]  basically and also violations of any number of laws and that already existed and and again i
[2:49:54.820 --> 2:50:00.900]  would point out that's why that's why the bush administration had to lobby in 2008 to get the
[2:50:01.540 --> 2:50:06.420]  telecommunications companies retroactive immunity for all the crimes they were committed and they
[2:50:06.420 --> 2:50:13.300]  knew that so but anything anybody exposing those kinds of activities that crime and so on
[2:50:13.300 --> 2:50:18.820]  like chelsea manning for example although you could say that chelsea manning basically exposed
[2:50:18.820 --> 2:50:24.020]  a little more than the criminal activity and you could also say i think that that was also true
[2:50:24.020 --> 2:50:28.980]  for edward snowden he did a little more than the criminal activity but by and large he did a lot of
[2:50:28.980 --> 2:50:34.180]  the criminal activity and that should not be held against him what about what about julien assange
[2:50:34.180 --> 2:50:39.860]  julien assange is a is a reporter so if they're going to hold him accountable for anything they
[2:50:39.860 --> 2:50:45.460]  also have to do that for the guardian washington post new york times all of them have done the
[2:50:45.460 --> 2:50:50.020]  kinds of things that julien assange has done and they've gotten classified information so that's
[2:50:50.020 --> 2:50:55.700]  what's so dangerous when the press now piles on assange from from him being a hero five years ago
[2:50:55.700 --> 2:51:00.420]  six years ago to now being this demon and they're all trying to destroy their own protections
[2:51:00.420 --> 2:51:04.580]  that's insane well it's not just that they're trying to get rid of their competition they viewed
[2:51:04.580 --> 2:51:10.580]  him as competition because he was telling the truth and they weren't so wouldn't you say that that's
[2:51:10.580 --> 2:51:14.900]  one big strike against trump and that he needs to do something for julien assange he really does
[2:51:14.900 --> 2:51:19.700]  need to straighten that out yeah i mean it's uh you know he's good at facing things and calling
[2:51:19.700 --> 2:51:26.260]  things what they are and this he needs to address this one too let's talk about the mindset of the
[2:51:26.260 --> 2:51:30.420]  clappers and the brennan's uh getting up in front of congress and saying nobody's ever
[2:51:30.420 --> 2:51:36.820]  spotted the american people telling these huge lies arrogantly uh phil mud former deputy of the cia
[2:51:36.820 --> 2:51:41.700]  threatening to kill the president threatening to stab juliani in the back i'm what are they doing that
[2:51:41.700 --> 2:51:47.540]  for uh because they feel they have the power to make it happen that's that's because nobody's
[2:51:47.540 --> 2:51:51.780]  addressed this this power in the background all this data they have and all the things they're
[2:51:51.780 --> 2:51:57.620]  doing and they're all the threats they're making how how they've intimidated most of the people
[2:51:57.620 --> 2:52:02.420]  working for government you know and all these agencies most of them are intimidated uh but
[2:52:03.300 --> 2:52:06.900]  some of them aren't as that's and that's those are the ones who turn out to be whistleblowers
[2:52:06.900 --> 2:52:12.500]  and they're the ones that thank god help us understand what's really going on so you know
[2:52:12.500 --> 2:52:19.860]  i just see uh i just see this as uh as they're an error basically the arrogance of power they
[2:52:19.860 --> 2:52:24.580]  think they've got it and they've got control of everybody even the president and they can control
[2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:29.380]  what he does and what he can't do because after all if they don't tell him something he doesn't
[2:52:29.380 --> 2:52:36.340]  know it okay you know what i mean absolutely the the rumorblowers as you call them that the transcripts
[2:52:36.340 --> 2:52:41.380]  and all the evidence shows are lying what do you call it when you use national security
[2:52:42.900 --> 2:52:50.340]  membranes to leak lies where where people use their need to know to then make up info knowing
[2:52:50.340 --> 2:52:54.900]  everything's secret so people can't readily come out and disprove it i mean is that treason
[2:52:54.900 --> 2:53:00.980]  like the president say i call it i yeah i call it sedition and treason right they're trying to
[2:53:02.020 --> 2:53:09.540]  trying to change the government how it operates which is sedition and it's a big basically scrapping
[2:53:09.540 --> 2:53:15.460]  all the founding principles of the country which is treason yeah i agree he's calling it what it is
[2:53:15.460 --> 2:53:22.660]  and that's that's what i like about him he does that it's amazing uh that we're at this point where
[2:53:22.660 --> 2:53:28.420]  we have a soft civil war going on it's getting hot the president's talking about a coup attempt you
[2:53:28.420 --> 2:53:35.060]  agree that's what it is they say they're trying to really absolutely absolutely yeah gut level
[2:53:35.060 --> 2:53:39.060]  you've you've fought the soviet union all the rest of it been a whistleblower for 20 years
[2:53:39.780 --> 2:53:43.620]  what would you call the climate we're in today some call it a civil war others call it a power
[2:53:43.620 --> 2:53:48.580]  struggle uh what would you call this current time around and gut level where do you think things are
[2:53:48.580 --> 2:53:54.900]  going uh well i think they're i think they're going to a showdown here very soon and i think that
[2:53:54.900 --> 2:54:00.020]  showdown is going to scare a lot of people who've been involved in this and a lot of them i believe
[2:54:00.020 --> 2:54:06.020]  or a good many of them should and probably will go to jail uh and i'm i'm hoping that that is in
[2:54:06.020 --> 2:54:12.020]  fact what happens uh and i'm going to try to do everything i possibly can to ensure that uh
[2:54:12.020 --> 2:54:14.980]  uh what what is done is the right thing to do
[2:54:18.900 --> 2:54:23.220]  we're living in such historic times and i know there's times in history when you have a confluence
[2:54:23.220 --> 2:54:29.620]  of things and uh you know they call those sea changes or global realignments what what is this
[2:54:29.620 --> 2:54:34.740]  right now because it seems like things just accelerate accelerate and that uh technology's
[2:54:34.740 --> 2:54:42.660]  acceleration uh is what's propelling that to a great extent uh yes actually the technologies
[2:54:42.660 --> 2:54:48.260]  are enabling virtually all of it yeah that's uh that's one of the problems also one of the
[2:54:48.260 --> 2:54:53.700]  advantages because technology can be used to help resolve all of it and catch all of those who were
[2:54:53.700 --> 2:55:01.620]  involved in it at the same time so i mean it's a benefit it's also can be used uh it's like
[2:55:01.620 --> 2:55:06.980]  every technology every advancement in society and civilization has basically been a double-edged
[2:55:06.980 --> 2:55:11.700]  sword you know you have a fuse in the right way that's one side of the blade and the other side
[2:55:11.700 --> 2:55:18.660]  is the evil side so i i keep like uh when i give talks like at the uh cambridge math the college
[2:55:18.660 --> 2:55:25.060]  of mathematics or the college of uh computer science or in any university over here in the
[2:55:25.060 --> 2:55:30.820]  states or anywhere else in europe i keep saying that we who are designing and solving these problems
[2:55:30.820 --> 2:55:38.980]  need to realize and plan for evil at the top so in other words build in things that aren't
[2:55:38.980 --> 2:55:44.980]  documented that are there sitting and waiting for any any kind of manager like busher cheney or
[2:55:44.980 --> 2:55:52.020]  hayden their tenant to come along and use those use anything in an evil way or an unconstitutional
[2:55:52.020 --> 2:55:58.100]  or criminal way and that way uh we could detect that with the this built-in software that's
[2:55:58.100 --> 2:56:03.540]  undocumented and so on and nobody knows about and then all of a sudden blast everything they're
[2:56:03.540 --> 2:56:08.420]  doing all over everywhere in the world and i know you can't give out classified things you
[2:56:08.420 --> 2:56:13.300]  could talk about new things that could be built and the word is there was those systems to track
[2:56:13.300 --> 2:56:18.660]  who was on the nsa network to make sure it wouldn't be abused but when 9 11 happened they removed that
[2:56:18.660 --> 2:56:24.260]  which opens us up to infinity talk about treason so that they can now use it and spy on people with
[2:56:24.260 --> 2:56:30.580]  impunity that's that's correct and that was a part of the thin dread program yeah exactly it was
[2:56:30.580 --> 2:56:36.580]  monitoring who came into the network where they went what they did how long they stayed everything
[2:56:36.580 --> 2:56:41.540]  yeah what's amazing about this is if you were the captain of say a cruise liner with 3 000 people
[2:56:41.540 --> 2:56:46.740]  on board you'd feel a responsibility to not abuse that or when you headed up the nsa responsibility
[2:56:46.740 --> 2:56:50.020]  to not do that and i've interviewed people that were involved in congress they said you know when
[2:56:50.020 --> 2:56:54.660]  you were running things none of this was going on and it and then as soon as they get control
[2:56:54.660 --> 2:56:59.860]  they immediately just ram the ship onto the beach wrecking everything thinking that they just have a
[2:56:59.860 --> 2:57:04.660]  right to do it because they were in that position of power when clearly they're breaking the law and
[2:57:04.660 --> 2:57:10.580]  then now 20 years later they think they can remove a president this isn't 1974 they're not getting
[2:57:10.580 --> 2:57:15.460]  away with it and as they go from being arrogant to now being scared it makes them even more dangerous
[2:57:15.460 --> 2:57:20.500]  yes hello hello
[2:57:24.340 --> 2:57:27.380]  hello i think we lost the circuit
[2:57:27.380 --> 2:57:38.420]  hello

[3:00:10.340 --> 3:00:15.460]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[3:00:20.100 --> 3:00:24.580]  ladies and gentlemen we're back live broadcasting worldwide william benny former head of the nsa
[3:00:24.580 --> 3:00:29.540]  is our guest i don't get conspiracy theorists but we only have these crazy difficulties when
[3:00:29.540 --> 3:00:34.740]  guests like him are on uh that's never happened a wire didn't might go out but it did nevertheless
[3:00:34.740 --> 3:00:39.940]  probably just uh you know coincidence but but going back to a william benny uh just to finish
[3:00:39.940 --> 3:00:45.220]  up sir i really appreciate your time your energy your great work on the snowden film that that
[3:00:45.220 --> 3:00:49.140]  reached so many obviously with oliver stone and plus the documentaries that are out there
[3:00:49.700 --> 3:00:53.460]  just wanted to uh you know thank you for what you've done and then give you a chance just in closing
[3:00:53.460 --> 3:00:59.940]  to make any other key points you'd like to well i mean i i think that they need a they need to uh
[3:00:59.940 --> 3:01:04.180]  get first of all i would say we need to get rid of the visor court because that's an impediment
[3:01:04.180 --> 3:01:11.380]  to actually succeeding at things and and making things uh uh real and uh and you know constitutional
[3:01:11.380 --> 3:01:15.940]  and everything because that's a hidden court that hides everything that they're doing and that's a
[3:01:15.940 --> 3:01:23.060]  that's a major failure in terms of and being able to do anything significant and and lawful
[3:01:23.060 --> 3:01:27.380]  because you can look and see what's but what's been happening with that court that court is just
[3:01:27.380 --> 3:01:34.980]  that absolute fake and and it's been it's been abused and abused over and over again down through
[3:01:34.980 --> 3:01:40.260]  the years and they know it and they do nothing about it so it says to me very simply put they
[3:01:40.260 --> 3:01:46.260]  don't want to fix the problem they just want to keep the problem going and keep all the money
[3:01:46.260 --> 3:01:51.620]  flowing so that everybody's happy all of those people who are getting all this money are happy
[3:01:51.620 --> 3:01:57.060]  and i call that the happiness management program you know that's where that's where only certain
[3:01:57.060 --> 3:02:04.020]  people get rich and we all pay for it in the end so i just think we need to we need to clean house
[3:02:04.020 --> 3:02:09.780]  here i've said this before and you know it's it's the basic that the idea is that we need to
[3:02:09.780 --> 3:02:16.420]  we need to ensure that the law is followed which is not being done now and certainly the department
[3:02:16.420 --> 3:02:22.020]  of what i call the department of just us needs to be corrected and resolved and a lot of people
[3:02:22.020 --> 3:02:26.980]  need to go to jail for this and so i'm just sorry that that's the crimes they've been committing
[3:02:26.980 --> 3:02:31.940]  they need to be able to countable for them that's all i just think we need to keep going in this
[3:02:31.940 --> 3:02:37.940]  direction and make sure it happens and if bar does that thank god for him and and hopefully
[3:02:37.940 --> 3:02:44.980]  then we'll get a department of justice back well seeing all of the tectonic freaking out going on
[3:02:44.980 --> 3:02:50.020]  by the establishment bipartisanly you you can show real changes here and trump really is trying to
[3:02:50.020 --> 3:02:52.980]  do what he thinks is best it doesn't mean he's perfect they're going to try to set him up with
[3:02:52.980 --> 3:02:57.940]  this turkey situation and just all of it but we have to understand he's not perfect and going
[3:02:57.940 --> 3:03:02.420]  into this election hillary still intends to run and it's just going to be a one hell of a time
[3:03:02.420 --> 3:03:06.340]  maximum effort to save the country and still live in someone of a free nation thank you
[3:03:06.340 --> 3:03:12.020]  william benney for all of your time and godspeed well thanks for having me alex thank you sir
[3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:17.380]  well that's a real american hero we've got right there we're going to go to break and we're going
[3:03:17.380 --> 3:03:24.100]  to come back with mike adams who's got so much to cover two huge breaking stories uh so many times
[3:03:24.100 --> 3:03:29.460]  mike just is absolutely breaking bombshells i think probably more than anybody i know uh and
[3:03:29.460 --> 3:03:34.500]  the research he puts out years later uh you know it turns out to be verified by by many many others
[3:03:34.500 --> 3:03:38.900]  so uh i know he had a bunch of stuff already planned he tells me there's even more breaking news
[3:03:38.900 --> 3:03:44.180]  uh coming up but when we come back we're going to air a few minutes uh from the report from
[3:03:44.180 --> 3:03:48.900]  a year ago that media matters put out like they tattled on me that i'd done something wrong when
[3:03:48.900 --> 3:03:53.220]  gg ping was bragging that i'd been taken off the air and he was very proud of that the chinese
[3:03:53.220 --> 3:03:58.580]  dictator real clear politics alex jones donald trump you need to blow the whistle on chinese
[3:03:58.580 --> 3:04:06.820]  communist infiltration of silicon valley and the democratic party and boy they're not laughing
[3:04:06.820 --> 3:04:12.020]  now are they uh so that's our job is to take the hard topics at the establishment doesn't
[3:04:12.020 --> 3:04:16.500]  want us to discuss and to force those out there separately didn't plug last hour because i was
[3:04:16.500 --> 3:04:21.300]  just you know to enamored with the great information we're breaking we have a new special
[3:04:21.300 --> 3:04:27.460]  and it's the everything must go 40 to 70 off store-wide free shipping double patriot points
[3:04:27.460 --> 3:04:33.540]  okay now there's only a few things on there that aren't 40 percent or more that's like the hyaluronic
[3:04:33.540 --> 3:04:38.180]  acid high quality silver salt skin creams we sold out all the three ounce tubes the one ounce tubes
[3:04:38.180 --> 3:04:41.780]  are available uh but i mean i can't sell stuff at cost that was a mistake we even did that but
[3:04:41.780 --> 3:04:45.620]  this is how we fund ourselves great products they were thank you all for your support those
[3:04:45.620 --> 3:04:49.700]  who haven't mind the products when encourage those on the fence hey we proven we're right folks
[3:04:49.700 --> 3:04:54.340]  and we need your support now more than ever the critical uh months of the election are coming up
[3:04:54.340 --> 3:04:58.100]  and this is just such a historic time so thank you all whatever you do spread the word though
[3:04:58.100 --> 3:05:04.740]  about the live show that's how we reach new people mike adams is coming up globalism was doomed to
[3:05:04.740 --> 3:05:11.940]  fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it didn't i say a thousand times that there's no way
[3:05:11.940 --> 3:05:15.620]  you're gonna have an authoritarian corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes
[3:05:15.620 --> 3:05:20.420]  that has diplomatic immunity that runs around saying it's communist and socialist power to the
[3:05:20.420 --> 3:05:25.860]  people but then meanwhile his tax exempt again offshore well trump got that and all these other
[3:05:25.860 --> 3:05:31.060]  populace get it why would you throw away wealthy successful countries and cultures just so you
[3:05:31.060 --> 3:05:36.100]  could say the communist chinese that david rockefeller put in power are better than everybody
[3:05:36.100 --> 3:05:42.660]  that is a sick freakish joke and i will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people
[3:05:42.660 --> 3:05:48.500]  and i beg god for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their
[3:05:48.500 --> 3:05:54.420]  defeat and i've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and god is delivering because god is great
[3:05:54.420 --> 3:05:59.780]  thank god for his son jesus christ and now let's move forward on it's the n w
[3:06:08.820 --> 3:06:16.260]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance it's
[3:06:16.260 --> 3:06:26.820]  mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show so again i'm gonna explain something you
[3:06:26.820 --> 3:06:30.740]  know about it when i'm getting banned or shadow banned because i'll make a big deal about it
[3:06:32.500 --> 3:06:38.900]  matt gates was shadow banned and we told him two weeks before roger stone told him on the
[3:06:38.900 --> 3:06:44.500]  phone and in text messages we've run you through their system we have sites that look at this we
[3:06:44.500 --> 3:06:50.900]  send him links you're already 90 band on twitter gates went up during the committee hearing and
[3:06:50.900 --> 3:06:55.140]  said you're a private company you can do whatever you want not even getting it so the next day they
[3:06:55.140 --> 3:07:01.620]  shadow banned him 99 percent they go this guy's an idiot we all just lied to him and said we don't
[3:07:01.620 --> 3:07:06.100]  sense there any conservatives he said that's fine just don't talk about killing congressmen
[3:07:07.540 --> 3:07:12.020]  and the next day they banned him down to nothing then he said he felt victimized and i'm not trying
[3:07:12.020 --> 3:07:17.620]  to put matt gates down just come on man get it together figure out what's going on mainstream
[3:07:17.620 --> 3:07:21.460]  corporate media is fake news they're the enemy of the american people like the president said
[3:07:22.420 --> 3:07:28.500]  and now they're coming after everybody now if you want to get into the real reason all this is
[3:07:28.500 --> 3:07:32.740]  happening i know it's demoralizing i don't want to demoralize people but facts are facts like
[3:07:32.740 --> 3:07:37.940]  having cancer it's operable we can fix it mr president you know the office of personal
[3:07:37.940 --> 3:07:41.540]  management was done by insiders that's even come out in intelligence reports they try to keep it
[3:07:41.540 --> 3:07:45.460]  quiet because it's such trees and it's unbelievable we know china owns the majority of our debt after
[3:07:45.460 --> 3:07:50.420]  the private fellow reserve we know they now own hollywood you felt blocked some of them buying
[3:07:50.420 --> 3:07:55.460]  up american bandstand a few final things they didn't know we know that they're teaching malism in the
[3:07:55.460 --> 3:08:02.980]  colleges and all 50 major uh state-funded colleges have major chi-com infiltration some of them are
[3:08:02.980 --> 3:08:10.340]  run by the chi-coms even the washington post had to admit we know that the people's army of china
[3:08:10.340 --> 3:08:14.660]  has been caught running diane feinstein's operation we know their penetration is hundreds of times
[3:08:14.660 --> 3:08:18.500]  that of the russians we know they're involved in election meddling and we're so arrogant they went
[3:08:18.500 --> 3:08:24.660]  to devils a year and a half ago and said they would stop your agenda along with yunker mr president
[3:08:24.660 --> 3:08:29.460]  america knows you're real they know the democrats are the anti-american globalist ally with the
[3:08:29.460 --> 3:08:34.420]  chi-coms radical islam the unelected e you and others if you come out before the midterms and
[3:08:34.420 --> 3:08:39.460]  make the censorship the big issue and them trying to steal the election and if you make the fact
[3:08:39.460 --> 3:08:43.780]  we need the internet bill of rights and antitrust busting on these companies if they don't back off
[3:08:43.780 --> 3:08:50.100]  right now and if you don't come out and point out that the communist chinese have penetrated
[3:08:50.100 --> 3:08:54.100]  and infiltrated and are way way worse than the russians because it's true and the democrats
[3:08:54.100 --> 3:08:59.380]  are scared of that coming out and you've got the feinstein info coming out and more is about to come
[3:08:59.380 --> 3:09:05.220]  out this is i'm told everybody then they will be able to steal the midterms and start the impeachment
[3:09:05.220 --> 3:09:13.220]  it's the right thing to do mr president it's the truth and it's crazy to believe it it's crazy
[3:09:13.220 --> 3:09:19.540]  to understand it i know you've been told this from our technology to the uh south china sea
[3:09:19.540 --> 3:09:25.060]  to everything to them having 98 percent of rare earth minerals they didn't do that by themselves
[3:09:25.060 --> 3:09:29.460]  they were given that david rockefeller said he was going to move everything to china they said
[3:09:29.460 --> 3:09:33.940]  they were going to do all this and now you've stepped in the country's coming back from the dead
[3:09:33.940 --> 3:09:38.260]  they're desperate to stop it and they're trying to stop you and every american from having their
[3:09:38.260 --> 3:09:44.260]  speech by defaming me lying about what i've done soros financing fake lawsuits to give it legitimacy
[3:09:44.260 --> 3:09:48.580]  and now de-platforming me ahead of it because the lawsuits are all getting thrown out because
[3:09:48.580 --> 3:09:55.620]  their lies 90 percent of what's in these things are total frauds and they know we're getting stronger
[3:09:55.620 --> 3:10:01.140]  and they know we're moving forward and they now have made the wrong move i believe they've jumped
[3:10:01.140 --> 3:10:06.180]  the shark i believe they've won the battle but they're going to lose the war if you with your vision
[3:10:06.180 --> 3:10:11.380]  continue to take action and make free speech and and this internet anti-trust garbage the number one
[3:10:11.380 --> 3:10:16.740]  issue and move against them now if you don't they are going to steal the midterms they're already
[3:10:16.740 --> 3:10:21.060]  doing it with economic contributions of the democrats blocking everybody else's speech that
[3:10:21.060 --> 3:10:24.580]  supports america and making it great again and your agenda
[3:10:24.580 --> 3:10:28.020]  so
[3:10:30.580 --> 3:10:35.860]  rest of this fourth hour of broadcast and thank you for continuing with me we've got a
[3:10:35.860 --> 3:10:40.500]  lot of breaking news today on the health and science front i'll give you a little preview
[3:10:40.500 --> 3:10:45.540]  here in this segment then we'll dig deeper in the upcoming segments first we've got a story
[3:10:45.540 --> 3:10:52.180]  about a new polio outbreak declared in the philippines and the world health organization
[3:10:52.180 --> 3:10:58.820]  and unicef and the associated press all admit that it's caused by the polio vaccine that's right
[3:10:58.820 --> 3:11:03.940]  we now have the media admitting what we've been reporting here in the independent media on info
[3:11:03.940 --> 3:11:10.740]  wars and natural news and elsewhere that the polio vaccine causes polio in fact there hasn't
[3:11:10.740 --> 3:11:15.940]  been an outbreak of polio not even a single person has in fact been infected with polio
[3:11:15.940 --> 3:11:23.620]  in the philippines from the wild that is wild polio virus since 1993 every case of polio in
[3:11:23.620 --> 3:11:28.340]  the philippines and most other countries by the way has been caused by the polio vaccine
[3:11:28.340 --> 3:11:32.420]  and we're going to get into those details here as we continue on the fourth hour again just
[3:11:32.420 --> 3:11:38.820]  giving you a quick preview right now also today johnson and johnson ordered to pay eight billion
[3:11:38.820 --> 3:11:48.980]  dollars over its antipsychotic drug that gives young males breasts so this drug gives young
[3:11:48.980 --> 3:11:55.540]  males breasts this is kind of a transgender hormonal type of effect of this drug which
[3:11:55.540 --> 3:12:01.380]  is a multi-billion dollar drug called risperdoll or risperdoll depending on how you wish to pronounce
[3:12:01.380 --> 3:12:07.700]  it and this jury ordered an eight billion dollar payment this is huge this is one of the biggest
[3:12:07.700 --> 3:12:12.820]  settlements ever in the history of big pharma we're going to get into those details again later
[3:12:12.820 --> 3:12:19.380]  in the show today and the reason this is important because johnson and johnson got caught pushing
[3:12:20.020 --> 3:12:27.780]  hormone transgender inducing drugs on two children this is about much more than the corruption of
[3:12:27.780 --> 3:12:34.100]  big pharma and the corruption of science and medicine this is really about truly a form of
[3:12:34.100 --> 3:12:38.500]  chemical violence that's being carried out against our children all around the world
[3:12:38.500 --> 3:12:43.140]  by the drug companies and the vaccine companies who in many cases are the same exact companies
[3:12:43.140 --> 3:12:50.020]  this chemical violence is intended to cause brain damage it's intended to meme and even
[3:12:50.020 --> 3:12:56.420]  kind of lobotomize children in some cases it's also intended to cause transgenderism and we've
[3:12:56.420 --> 3:13:02.340]  talked before here at info wars about atrazine this is the second most common herbicide that's
[3:13:02.340 --> 3:13:09.620]  used in agriculture today atrazine is known as a chemical castrator atrazine it's in the food
[3:13:09.620 --> 3:13:15.380]  supply it's in the water it's in it's in your tap water by the way in very trace quantities but
[3:13:15.380 --> 3:13:24.260]  it's in there we can see it in our lab operations by the way atrazine turns males into females and
[3:13:24.260 --> 3:13:29.940]  now we have yet more proof and i want to remind you by the way that alex jones has been attacked
[3:13:29.940 --> 3:13:36.900]  for many years about this uh mocked even for telling the truth about how these drugs cause
[3:13:36.900 --> 3:13:42.100]  transgenderism they cause hormone disruptions there are hormone mimicers in the food supply
[3:13:42.100 --> 3:13:48.340]  and in the medication supply and when you have an entire country of people losing their minds
[3:13:48.340 --> 3:13:54.180]  and even losing their gender identity you know i mean losing their maleness if they're males and
[3:13:54.180 --> 3:14:01.780]  now they're they're becoming transgenders there is a chemically induced cause behind all of this
[3:14:01.780 --> 3:14:08.340]  and now today we know one of those chemical causes is in fact a prescription drug manufactured
[3:14:08.340 --> 3:14:15.140]  by johnson and johnson and the jury has handed down the award of eight billion dollars confirming
[3:14:15.140 --> 3:14:19.780]  that what we've been telling you is the truth and again we're going to cover that in more detail
[3:14:19.780 --> 3:14:25.380]  in more detail here on the alex jones show also today coming up i told you this is going to be a
[3:14:25.380 --> 3:14:33.540]  packed show with medical horrors and much more now i was on the show i don't know a week ago alex
[3:14:33.540 --> 3:14:39.380]  and i touched on this briefly but today i'm going to dive into it more deeply the genetic sequencing
[3:14:39.380 --> 3:14:48.900]  of a common vaccine has found an entire human genome the entire dna sequence for a specific
[3:14:48.900 --> 3:14:57.300]  male baby is being inserted into the vaccines but it's not a normal healthy male baby it's actually
[3:14:57.300 --> 3:15:05.860]  a genetically modified human genome that has been modified to activate up to 560 cancer genes
[3:15:06.500 --> 3:15:14.020]  so you if you take these aborted human fetal cell tissue vaccines which includes chickenpox
[3:15:14.020 --> 3:15:19.780]  m mr vaccines and many more if you give these to your children or take them yourself you are being
[3:15:19.780 --> 3:15:29.300]  injected with a genetically modified cancer infested blueprint of an aborted male baby
[3:15:29.940 --> 3:15:37.220]  who is now being used to imprint cancer genetic code into the body of your child and this is
[3:15:37.220 --> 3:15:44.020]  being done in order to cause more cancer which is the repeat business model of the pharmaceutical
[3:15:44.020 --> 3:15:49.620]  giants who are some of the most evil corporations on this planet so we're going to get into all that
[3:15:50.180 --> 3:15:54.260]  and some other topics as well when we return here on the alex jones show the fourth hour
[3:15:54.260 --> 3:15:58.340]  mike adam's sitting in we'll be right back after this break all those details and more

[3:21:36.340 --> 3:21:40.580]  just so you know i mean where else are you going to get this kind of analysis so let's jump right
[3:21:40.580 --> 3:21:46.580]  into it the world health organization and unicef now admit that the polio outbreak that's been
[3:21:46.580 --> 3:21:53.540]  announced in the philippines about a month ago is caused by quote vaccine derived polio virus type
[3:21:53.540 --> 3:22:00.580]  2 now here is the quote from the associated press story quote who and unicef said in a joint
[3:22:00.580 --> 3:22:06.660]  statement the polio outbreak in the philippines is concerning because it is caused by vaccine
[3:22:06.660 --> 3:22:14.500]  derived polio virus type 2 that's a quote they say quote this weakened virus used in vaccines
[3:22:14.500 --> 3:22:20.900]  replicates for a short time in children's intestines and is excreted in their feces
[3:22:20.900 --> 3:22:26.660]  you got that so when they say that all these vaccines are weakened viruses oh don't worry
[3:22:26.660 --> 3:22:32.740]  they've used ultraviolet light to weaken the virus it's not a live virus they're lying to your face
[3:22:32.740 --> 3:22:39.060]  okay because it's a live polio virus and they just admitted that it replicates in the intestines
[3:22:39.060 --> 3:22:44.020]  of children and then it gets excreted through their feces well as we've covered here i'm not
[3:22:44.020 --> 3:22:49.540]  going to make this gross sounding but where does all the feces go the feces goes to the city
[3:22:49.540 --> 3:22:54.660]  sewage collection center from the city sewage collection center they take the water out they
[3:22:54.660 --> 3:22:59.460]  kind of dry off the feces and then they take that bio sludge which is what it's called at that point
[3:22:59.460 --> 3:23:05.860]  and they dump it on the farms and they dump it on the city parks and they dump it in forests
[3:23:05.860 --> 3:23:12.180]  where it gets drained into the waterways the rivers the streams that then become the water
[3:23:12.180 --> 3:23:20.100]  supply for the city so polio vaccines become the source for spreading freaking polio this is
[3:23:20.100 --> 3:23:26.500]  what they're doing polio vaccines are now the number one cause of polio outbreaks all around
[3:23:26.500 --> 3:23:32.180]  the world polio vaccines are designed to replicate in the intestines of children and then to have
[3:23:32.180 --> 3:23:38.420]  this feces cycle which is part of the water supply cycle and part of the food cycle there are polio
[3:23:38.420 --> 3:23:44.820]  viruses now in the food supply in the water table in your tap water in some cases this is what it's
[3:23:44.820 --> 3:23:50.580]  all designed to do and it's just astonishing think about this that all of us who have told you the
[3:23:50.580 --> 3:23:57.780]  truth about vaccines all these years we've been banned and deplatformed and defamed censored
[3:23:57.780 --> 3:24:04.420]  demonetized you name it because we dare to talk about vaccines because we told you 10 years ago
[3:24:04.420 --> 3:24:10.340]  what the Associated Press is telling you today think about that the ap admits what alex jones
[3:24:10.340 --> 3:24:16.420]  told you and what i told you a decade ago if not more now they admit it but of course
[3:24:16.420 --> 3:24:22.500]  you're still considered oh a conspiracy theorist if you believe what the Associated Press just admitted
[3:24:23.220 --> 3:24:30.660]  polio vaccines cause polio but it's actually worse than that polio vaccines are causing
[3:24:30.660 --> 3:24:38.260]  super mutant strains of polio now this is a story from children's health defense which is of course
[3:24:38.260 --> 3:24:44.260]  the non-profit run by robert f. kennedy jr polio vaccination still causing polio after all these
[3:24:44.260 --> 3:24:52.900]  years and in this story what they explain is how this creates super viruses or what you would
[3:24:52.900 --> 3:24:59.540]  call superbug viral strains of polio that otherwise would not exist because they're giving this polio
[3:24:59.540 --> 3:25:06.580]  vaccine in many cases orally it's an oral vaccine in many cases but giving it to so many children
[3:25:06.580 --> 3:25:11.620]  all around the developing nations third world countries and in some first world countries
[3:25:12.180 --> 3:25:17.780]  and what happens is in the same way that if you if you prescribe too many antibiotics to a population
[3:25:17.780 --> 3:25:24.020]  you know how you get the rise of superbugs you get antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria right
[3:25:24.020 --> 3:25:28.340]  you know about that the entire medical industry knows about that well if you keep putting these
[3:25:28.340 --> 3:25:35.060]  polio vaccines into children all over the world what happens you give rise to these replicating
[3:25:35.060 --> 3:25:40.660]  superbug polio strains that are replicating in the intestines of the children admitted by the
[3:25:40.660 --> 3:25:47.460]  world health organization and unicef imagine that and then those strains go on to infect
[3:25:47.460 --> 3:25:52.500]  the entire environment and then when there's an outbreak even this associated press story that
[3:25:52.500 --> 3:25:57.460]  i just mentioned look at the headline of the ap story well actually i linked to it in my story
[3:25:57.460 --> 3:26:04.100]  the ap story says that it doesn't it doesn't say that's caused by the vaccine it just says oh there's
[3:26:04.100 --> 3:26:09.220]  an outbreak in the philippines and they're trying to cause mass hysteria where people say oh my god
[3:26:09.220 --> 3:26:14.660]  there's been a polio outbreak we have we should go out and get all get vaccinated again so they're
[3:26:14.660 --> 3:26:21.460]  using the hysteria of the outbreaks that are caused by the vaccine to push for more vaccination
[3:26:21.460 --> 3:26:26.740]  that causes more outbreaks and has more polio pollution in the water supply in the food supply
[3:26:26.740 --> 3:26:34.500]  in the soils in the streams because this is their cycle of mass hysteria quacks science
[3:26:34.500 --> 3:26:40.580]  and vaccine violence against children and adults all around the world it is a scam
[3:26:40.580 --> 3:26:46.180]  it is junk science is just as dishonest as this effort to try to impeach president trump
[3:26:46.180 --> 3:26:52.500]  it's all fiction they made it all up when they say that polio vaccines have eradicated polio
[3:26:52.500 --> 3:26:59.620]  they're full of bunk in truth polio vaccines are keeping the polio pandemics alive so they can
[3:26:59.620 --> 3:27:05.860]  keep pushing the vaccines the vaccine industry is now the number one cause of outbreaks all across
[3:27:05.860 --> 3:27:11.060]  our world and that is the simple truth that you won't see anywhere else now we're going to get to
[3:27:11.060 --> 3:27:16.580]  vaccines in more detail here talking about the human genome that has been found in vaccines now
[3:27:16.580 --> 3:27:23.540]  just just so you understand genetic sequencing technology uses pcr and other technologies
[3:27:23.540 --> 3:27:30.020]  to look at to map out the entire genetic code of cells that are found in these vaccines and when
[3:27:30.020 --> 3:27:35.620]  they do this as has been done recently by this lab in italy and this was also covered by children's
[3:27:35.620 --> 3:27:44.740]  health defense they found an entire human baby's gene sequence okay the entire it's the gene sequence
[3:27:44.740 --> 3:27:54.900]  for a specific individual male this was a baby that was aborted in the 1960s it was this baby
[3:27:54.900 --> 3:28:00.900]  was going to be born to a psychiatric patient mother but of course they murdered the baby
[3:28:00.900 --> 3:28:05.300]  before it was born and just like they do today with Planned Parenthood they harvested the organs
[3:28:05.300 --> 3:28:11.300]  of that child and they took those organs and they took that tissue and they have been cloning it
[3:28:11.300 --> 3:28:19.940]  ever since growing vats of aborted human fetal tissue which they inoculate with diseases like
[3:28:19.940 --> 3:28:27.140]  measles and mumps and rubella so they have these festering vats of cloned baby tissue and this is
[3:28:27.140 --> 3:28:32.020]  how they make vaccines they take these vats and they stir them up and they're these putrid
[3:28:32.020 --> 3:28:37.700]  festering disease vats and then they they filter that and they put it into vaccines they inject it
[3:28:37.700 --> 3:28:43.940]  into your children and they call you crazy if you're not willing to do it they are infecting
[3:28:43.940 --> 3:28:50.980]  every child with cancer and in other insane diseases that are imprinted into this genetic code
[3:28:50.980 --> 3:28:55.300]  this is genetic warfare on humanity and it's happening right now this is the only place you're
[3:28:55.300 --> 3:28:59.380]  going to hear about this with such force and truth stay with us we'll be back for more

[3:30:44.100 --> 3:30:49.620]  freedom hard fought taken away are you gonna get upset well you're a listener you're obviously
[3:30:49.620 --> 3:30:54.500]  are upset but you've got to ring the alarm everywhere until others they've got to get upset
[3:30:54.500 --> 3:30:58.900]  and then take action and let congress everybody else know that we're not backing down and we're
[3:30:58.900 --> 3:31:05.940]  not going to sell america out to the chai comes as the world awakens of the fact that info wars
[3:31:05.940 --> 3:31:11.060]  was right that alex jones was right i could sit here and do a victory lap but folks we don't have
[3:31:11.060 --> 3:31:16.660]  time i don't want to do a victory lap i'm not happy that i was right about all this no i don't
[3:31:16.660 --> 3:31:20.900]  want to be a slave of the globalist and live like a chai com slave i want to see the poor chinese
[3:31:20.900 --> 3:31:24.900]  people freed i don't want to be brought down to their level i want to see them brought up to our
[3:31:24.900 --> 3:31:29.540]  level ladies and gentlemen now is the time to be involved now is the time to be spreading the word
[3:31:29.540 --> 3:31:35.620]  and now is the time to financially support info wars and we make it so easy it's such a 360 win
[3:31:35.620 --> 3:31:39.940]  we're running a gigantic special in some ways it's the biggest ever certainly a whole bunch of the
[3:31:39.940 --> 3:31:45.140]  items 40 to 70 percent off store-wide free shipping double patriot points it is the everything must go
[3:31:45.140 --> 3:31:49.700]  special and i'm just going to sell out of all the products we've got some of these are to cost
[3:31:49.700 --> 3:31:54.580]  we're bringing in some money on some of the others and it's all vitally needed and now is the time
[3:31:54.580 --> 3:31:59.780]  to fill up our war chest to go in to this key year of 2020 so please support us at info wars
[3:31:59.780 --> 3:32:06.180]  store.com and take advantage of these great products communist china quietly bought up hollywood
[3:32:06.180 --> 3:32:10.980]  more than a decade ago and they've been approving almost all the scripts that you see on television
[3:32:10.980 --> 3:32:17.060]  or in the movies for many years and now they own our debt now they own the democratic party now
[3:32:17.060 --> 3:32:22.580]  they've merged with silicon valley to censor patriots off the air washington post comes out
[3:32:22.580 --> 3:32:27.540]  and says they hope that gg ping the dictator of china will quote destroy trump that's a headline
[3:32:28.260 --> 3:32:34.820]  so info wars has been the paul revere of this operation we have blown the whistle continuously
[3:32:34.820 --> 3:32:39.380]  and have been proven right and that's why it's more important than ever that we override silicon
[3:32:39.380 --> 3:32:43.860]  valley and their chi-com masters by word of mouth and spread the word about info wars
[3:32:43.860 --> 3:32:49.380]  and check out info wars store dot com that's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded
[3:32:49.380 --> 3:32:59.780]  that's where the tip of the spear is continually being forged is info wars store dot com
[3:32:59.780 --> 3:33:09.780]  and
[3:33:16.660 --> 3:33:25.780]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's mike adams you're listening to the alex
[3:33:25.780 --> 3:33:34.820]  jones show sometimes i i assume that people know vaccines are made out of a boarded human fetal
[3:33:34.820 --> 3:33:41.140]  tissue even though it's an admitted fact by the cdc and it's openly admitted by the vaccine makers
[3:33:41.140 --> 3:33:47.780]  themselves i've asked this question to a lot of intelligent people who aren't aware of you know
[3:33:47.780 --> 3:33:54.660]  truthful information architects you know doctors attorneys and so on none of them are aware of this
[3:33:54.660 --> 3:34:01.380]  they they even scoff at the idea that vaccines are made with a boarded human fetal tissue so
[3:34:01.380 --> 3:34:07.940]  i'm going to let you discover this for yourself and show you the proof the cdc openly admits
[3:34:08.900 --> 3:34:13.860]  that vaccines are made with a boarded human fetal tissue strains the two strains are called mrc
[3:34:13.860 --> 3:34:23.620]  dash 5 and wi 38 or wi dash 38 now if you'll go to duck dot go dot com and if you'll search site colon
[3:34:23.620 --> 3:34:29.300]  cdc dot gov that limits your search to the cdc website and after that after a space type in
[3:34:30.180 --> 3:34:35.860]  mrc dash 5 and hit enter on your search you will find this document called vaccine
[3:34:35.860 --> 3:34:41.380]  excipient summary and in this document the cdc lists the ingredients or at least the
[3:34:41.380 --> 3:34:48.100]  excipients in the vaccines and it discloses that many of them contain mrc dash 5 cells
[3:34:48.100 --> 3:34:54.340]  including dna and protein and that's actually of course human dna and if you look up the history
[3:34:54.340 --> 3:35:00.020]  of mrc 5 you'll see that that's the case it came from an aborted fetal uh an aborted human baby
[3:35:00.020 --> 3:35:04.580]  in the 1960s and then they took the fetal tissue and have used it to clone vaccines ever since
[3:35:04.580 --> 3:35:13.300]  these are in m m r v which is pro quad recombinant albumen it's in what is this um
[3:35:14.020 --> 3:35:21.860]  varicella a verivax vaccine which is chicken pox it's in a hepatitis vaccine as well mrc dash 5
[3:35:22.660 --> 3:35:29.780]  so there it is admitted now just in case you think the cdc is lying to you i mean my god why
[3:35:29.780 --> 3:35:35.460]  would the cdc admit there's aborted human fetal cells used in vaccines well we can go to glaxosmith
[3:35:35.460 --> 3:35:41.460]  kline's own website glaxosmith kline has product insert sheets and descriptions for some of their
[3:35:41.460 --> 3:35:48.660]  vaccines one of which is called priorix tetra priorix dash tetra and that vaccine insert sheet
[3:35:48.660 --> 3:35:54.420]  i'll read you a quote it says each virus strain this is on the first page each virus strain is
[3:35:54.420 --> 3:36:02.900]  separately produced in either chick embryo cells mumps and measles or mrc 5 human diploid cells
[3:36:02.900 --> 3:36:09.780]  rubella and varicella you got it human diploid cells now when they say the word human they mean
[3:36:09.780 --> 3:36:17.140]  human they mean this is a human baby's clone cells that they're using to make their priorix
[3:36:17.140 --> 3:36:25.780]  tetra vaccine which is an m m r v vaccine measles mumps rubella and varicella that's
[3:36:25.780 --> 3:36:31.780]  admitted by glaxosmith kline and on the second page by the way another quote the product also
[3:36:31.780 --> 3:36:38.500]  contains residual components of mrc 5 cells including dna and protein and trace quantities of
[3:36:38.500 --> 3:36:50.100]  neomycin and bovine cells from mrc 5 culture media now if you didn't know what mrc 5 was
[3:36:50.740 --> 3:36:55.380]  even though they admit on page one it's human cells if you didn't know what mrc 5 was you might
[3:36:56.260 --> 3:37:01.460]  maybe you could say okay you're not aware that there's human fetal tissue cells in vaccines
[3:37:01.460 --> 3:37:05.220]  but if you just look at the history of mrc 5 you know where they got it and how they've been cloning
[3:37:05.220 --> 3:37:11.540]  it year after year after year it is human cells that are in the vaccines and you know they use
[3:37:11.540 --> 3:37:18.500]  all these code words you know like in the grocery store when they want to put msg in your food but
[3:37:18.500 --> 3:37:24.580]  they don't want to label it msg what do they use instead yeast extract so anytime you look at a food
[3:37:24.580 --> 3:37:30.740]  label and it says yeast extract it actually contains msg but they have code words and the
[3:37:30.740 --> 3:37:37.380]  vaccine industry does the same thing mrc 5 is a code word for aborted human fetal cells
[3:37:37.380 --> 3:37:44.420]  grown in giant festering vats you know clone human babies okay with diseases inoculated into them
[3:37:44.420 --> 3:37:48.820]  and then injected into your children all right so i just wanted to prove to you or even allow you
[3:37:48.820 --> 3:37:56.180]  to prove to yourself that that's exactly what's going on so that we can get into more in-depth
[3:37:56.180 --> 3:38:03.220]  analysis of what's happening with the genetically modified baby genes human genes that are now being
[3:38:03.220 --> 3:38:08.660]  injected into your children here we go and i kind of hinted at this in the last segment but here
[3:38:08.660 --> 3:38:16.420]  here's the true full story on this it's an entire male human genome that has been genetically altered
[3:38:16.420 --> 3:38:25.220]  to become abnormal to activate as many as 560 cancer genes and then this is what's injected
[3:38:25.220 --> 3:38:32.340]  into your children now why would they inject a genetically modified cancer blueprint from aborted
[3:38:32.340 --> 3:38:38.820]  human cells into your children why would they want to do that the answer should be obvious
[3:38:38.820 --> 3:38:44.420]  no it's a multi-part answer number one the vaccine manufacturers are the same companies that make
[3:38:44.420 --> 3:38:50.820]  money off of cancer treatments and what happens is the cancer doesn't kick in right away but as you
[3:38:50.820 --> 3:38:56.740]  get older when you get attacked and assaulted by all these other immune system insults then the
[3:38:56.740 --> 3:39:02.900]  cancer begins to fester because when your body becomes weakened or your immune system becomes
[3:39:02.900 --> 3:39:09.300]  weakened the cancer then can take over and start growing cancer tumors and this could happen in
[3:39:09.300 --> 3:39:15.140]  your 30s your 40s your 50s or beyond it's going to happen sometime for most people because you've
[3:39:15.140 --> 3:39:20.660]  been injected with the blueprint for cancer the reason they do this is because they know the
[3:39:20.660 --> 3:39:27.140]  non weakened viral strains some of them that are put into vaccines are the kinds of viruses
[3:39:27.140 --> 3:39:33.140]  that of course penetrate your cells this is how viruses work and they reprogram the DNA of your
[3:39:33.140 --> 3:39:40.500]  cells excuse me they reprogram the DNA of your own cells to produce cancer tumors so viruses
[3:39:40.500 --> 3:39:46.820]  are put into the vaccines as Trojan horses to go into your cells reprogram your cells
[3:39:46.820 --> 3:39:52.420]  to make cancer tumors and this is why vaccines are being mandated everywhere around the world
[3:39:52.420 --> 3:39:59.460]  because they the drug companies they want cancer profits it's a repeat business revenue model
[3:39:59.460 --> 3:40:05.700]  that's what it is but there's another angle too it's depopulation it's the globalists saying
[3:40:05.700 --> 3:40:09.860]  they don't need humans any longer because they've got the rise of the robots they've got the AI
[3:40:09.860 --> 3:40:17.780]  systems taking over they are going to replace 70% of the workforce with automated systems robotics
[3:40:17.780 --> 3:40:25.300]  and AI they don't need 70% of the humans this is how they're going to get rid of humans while
[3:40:25.300 --> 3:40:30.580]  extracting every last dime they've ever earned by charging them for cancer drugs taking all their
[3:40:30.580 --> 3:40:35.780]  life savings for their last ditch experimental emergency medical treatments which don't work
[3:40:35.780 --> 3:40:42.260]  by the way they have pre-programmed every child in california and across america through vaccines
[3:40:42.980 --> 3:40:49.860]  to not only transfer profits to the cancer industry but then to die on command to die because that's
[3:40:49.860 --> 3:40:55.300]  what the globalists have planned for humanity you understand that these vaccines are not about
[3:40:55.300 --> 3:41:02.900]  protecting your health they are about killing you they are about murdering children as they age
[3:41:02.900 --> 3:41:08.900]  it's about activating cancer genes in your body this is what it's all about and there's also by
[3:41:08.900 --> 3:41:17.300]  the way there's transference of these genes to reproductive organs such as sperm cells for example
[3:41:17.300 --> 3:41:21.780]  there's transference that modern scientists don't even understand they say it's impossible
[3:41:21.780 --> 3:41:26.420]  they say oh if you inject a child with the DNA it can't go into the sperm later on in life when
[3:41:26.420 --> 3:41:31.700]  they're making new sperm if it's a male yes yes males make sperm in case you need a refresher
[3:41:31.700 --> 3:41:36.740]  on your transgenderism right there but you know the the lgbt denialism is like what there's no such
[3:41:36.740 --> 3:41:41.620]  thing as biology actually there is there is dna there are chromosomes by the way a quick reminder
[3:41:41.620 --> 3:41:45.700]  but remember the people the scientists who said they're going to release the mosquitoes in brazil
[3:41:46.420 --> 3:41:50.740]  and they're going to they're going to kill off all the mosquitoes by making sure that these these
[3:41:50.740 --> 3:41:56.420]  uh suicide traits never get passed on from generation to generation guess what they were wrong
[3:41:56.420 --> 3:42:03.060]  they were wrong and they have created accidentally an entire new species of super mosquitoes that now
[3:42:03.060 --> 3:42:09.140]  have genes from three different countries they're super mosquitoes that have managed to replicate
[3:42:09.140 --> 3:42:14.660]  and create offspring in which these genes have been found the genes that are supposed to kill them
[3:42:14.660 --> 3:42:19.940]  have been transferred through reproduction and this is baffling all the scientists of the world
[3:42:19.940 --> 3:42:24.820]  today they can't understand how this is happening guess what it's happening in humans too so when
[3:42:24.820 --> 3:42:31.620]  they inject you with these cancer genes that have been engineered into the human cells they know
[3:42:31.620 --> 3:42:36.820]  that some percentage of those genes is going to go into the sperm cells going to create offspring
[3:42:36.820 --> 3:42:42.820]  that are pre-engineered to have cancer and die and that's exactly their plan for you that's the plan
[3:42:42.820 --> 3:42:49.460]  that globalists have for humanity they want you to die we want you to live stay tuned we'll give
[3:42:49.460 --> 3:42:55.060]  you more information about how to actually do that through nutrition and have a good common sense
[3:42:55.060 --> 3:42:56.740]  stay with us we'll be right back
[3:43:00.500 --> 3:43:07.140]  history is happening right now president trump is trying to remove the swamp the globalists
[3:43:07.140 --> 3:43:11.940]  that have been feeding on our nation and selling us out of the chai comms and others that's why
[3:43:11.940 --> 3:43:18.100]  nancy polosi has come out and said that the attorney general bar has to resign because he's
[3:43:18.100 --> 3:43:24.100]  corrupt that's because they know that he's getting ready to move against the deep state that there
[3:43:24.100 --> 3:43:30.580]  are sealed indictments against mccabe and others already two weeks ago the appeal by the deputy
[3:43:30.580 --> 3:43:36.500]  attorney general was rejected the appeal was brought to him and it was rejected that means the
[3:43:36.500 --> 3:43:41.700]  indictment is there that's why they're so panicked that's why this impeachment's real of course it's
[3:43:41.700 --> 3:43:46.740]  made up of course it's a fraud but it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've
[3:43:46.740 --> 3:43:52.500]  committed so many crimes their back is against the wall and they're making their move right now
[3:43:52.500 --> 3:43:57.620]  this is the time to be fully engaged ladies and gentlemen we're fighting for not just our nation
[3:43:57.620 --> 3:44:03.940]  but the world's future america is fighting for its life my friends i've seen a lot of donald trump

[3:47:24.580 --> 3:47:29.940]  all right we're back for a final segment here on the alex jones show mike adams filling in for
[3:47:29.940 --> 3:47:36.660]  this segment thank you for joining me i i feel fired up i don't know about you i feel that the
[3:47:36.660 --> 3:47:43.860]  spirit of humanity is rising and i feel that the truth is beginning to win even under all this
[3:47:43.860 --> 3:47:50.340]  oppression and censorship and all this bullying and the bullying comes from the left the bullying
[3:47:50.340 --> 3:47:55.300]  comes from the communists and there's no greater bullying or you know worse bully in the world today
[3:47:55.300 --> 3:48:01.860]  than china and that's the topic of the segment communist china is the bully of the world and i
[3:48:01.860 --> 3:48:07.300]  know some of this firsthand you may recall i lived in taiwan for a couple of years taiwan is the
[3:48:07.300 --> 3:48:14.900]  sort of i call it the texas of asia taiwan's the free democracy and china is the communist regime
[3:48:15.940 --> 3:48:20.900]  of tyranny and authoritarianism and you know i've been to hong kong and i i've toured throughout
[3:48:20.900 --> 3:48:27.140]  southeast asia when i was on a speaking engagement before for actually a network security computer
[3:48:27.140 --> 3:48:32.980]  security i spoke throughout uh hong kong malaysia singapore places like that and so i've been to
[3:48:32.980 --> 3:48:38.180]  china and i speak a fair amount of of mandarin chinese and i've you know i've lived in in taiwan
[3:48:38.180 --> 3:48:44.820]  and so i hear things directly from the taiwan media and the chinese media in china in some
[3:48:44.820 --> 3:48:50.980]  cases i hear things that my my business associates family members and friends tell me that are only
[3:48:50.980 --> 3:48:55.780]  in chinese like you can't you can't find some of this news in english it's only in chinese
[3:48:55.780 --> 3:49:03.620]  and what's happened is china has taken over the taiwan press china has been buying its way
[3:49:03.620 --> 3:49:09.300]  into taiwan in much the same way that china has been buying its way into american culture
[3:49:09.300 --> 3:49:14.820]  hollywood the senate i mean diane feinstein is practically working for the communist chinese
[3:49:14.820 --> 3:49:20.100]  she's a commie spy as far as i'm concerned you know if we should see the transcripts of anyone's
[3:49:20.100 --> 3:49:24.820]  phone calls in washington it should be senator feinstein's office and all of her phone calls
[3:49:24.820 --> 3:49:31.460]  to beijing to turn in whistleblowers from china who then get captured in china by the chinese police
[3:49:31.460 --> 3:49:37.540]  and sent off to organ harvesting camps which are located right next to the nba player training
[3:49:37.540 --> 3:49:42.740]  facilities by the way so as they're shooting hoops people are getting their kidneys ripped out in
[3:49:42.740 --> 3:49:48.820]  communist china because that's what communist countries do but there's a lot more that you need
[3:49:48.820 --> 3:49:54.660]  to know about the situation paul joseph watchin tweeted out this morning alex covered it earlier
[3:49:54.660 --> 3:50:00.260]  it's time for americans to denounce every corporation that caves in or refuses to denounce china
[3:50:00.260 --> 3:50:05.300]  i couldn't agree more these corporations trash american values then openly embrace and cower
[3:50:05.300 --> 3:50:11.620]  to china's dictatorship for profit it's clear who their leader is it's not trump it's she
[3:50:12.660 --> 3:50:19.940]  that's right she who who's the lifetime emperor of china you know i've i've thought for a long time
[3:50:19.940 --> 3:50:25.460]  that these american corporations think about how much they hate america they hate trump
[3:50:25.460 --> 3:50:33.380]  they hate the constitution they hate patriots and then at the same time they worship communist china
[3:50:34.420 --> 3:50:41.220]  they are in fact implicitly approving of the organ harvesting of falun gong members
[3:50:42.020 --> 3:50:47.940]  right i mean people who are just trying to meditate in a city park they get arrested
[3:50:47.940 --> 3:50:53.300]  they get thrown into a gulag they get euthanized they have their organs harvested
[3:50:54.340 --> 3:50:59.940]  because there's a there's a big black market organ trade and china says if you talk about this
[3:50:59.940 --> 3:51:05.700]  you're a bad person or you're a bad corporation hey apple they say if you want to sell iphone's
[3:51:05.700 --> 3:51:12.660]  in china you have to bow down and lick the boots of she yeah well i don't know if tim cook is
[3:51:12.660 --> 3:51:17.060]  willing to do that maybe he is seems like it's so far seems like all these corporations are willing
[3:51:17.060 --> 3:51:25.140]  to appease the communist in china but i'm not i'm not at all in fact i say it's time it's time for
[3:51:25.140 --> 3:51:33.940]  all of us to boycott every american corporation that advocates communist china every corporation
[3:51:33.940 --> 3:51:39.300]  that refuses to denounce a communist china we should denounce that corporation we should boycott
[3:51:39.300 --> 3:51:46.660]  those corporations whether it's nike or apple or google you know tech giants or beyond we should stop
[3:51:46.660 --> 3:51:52.500]  giving those corporations our money and our business if they are promoting this holocaust
[3:51:52.500 --> 3:51:59.300]  against humanity that's taking place in china the human rights abuses alone are so egregious and so
[3:51:59.300 --> 3:52:05.220]  horrific that we must raise our voices against that tyranny and that regime and at the same time
[3:52:06.180 --> 3:52:11.380]  we have to understand the genius of president trump in waging this trade war with china
[3:52:11.380 --> 3:52:17.460]  trump knows something that most americans don't yet realize trump knows that if you weaken china's
[3:52:17.460 --> 3:52:24.260]  economy that you can spur a political revolution and that's what trump is actually doing a lot
[3:52:24.260 --> 3:52:29.460]  of people don't know this but china is already on the verge of falling or at least it's communist
[3:52:29.460 --> 3:52:36.100]  dictatorship falling the people of china some of them are they're not too thrilled about living
[3:52:36.100 --> 3:52:41.700]  under this police state or willian social credit score big tech surveillance system many of them
[3:52:41.700 --> 3:52:44.820]  want more freedom they don't have economic freedom they don't have freedom of speech they don't
[3:52:44.820 --> 3:52:50.020]  have political freedom the only thing that has prevented literally tens of millions of chinese
[3:52:50.020 --> 3:52:55.300]  citizens from marching in the streets is because their economy has been good for a long time and
[3:52:55.300 --> 3:53:00.500]  their economy has been good because they've had an unfair trade advantage they've been taking advantage
[3:53:00.500 --> 3:53:06.500]  of the united states as previous presidents like obama and bill clinton for example allowed china
[3:53:06.500 --> 3:53:14.340]  to do bill clinton practically gave away america america's economy to china china was ready to
[3:53:14.340 --> 3:53:21.060]  to latch on to that and take advantage of that situation trump is telling them no the era of
[3:53:21.060 --> 3:53:26.820]  you stealing our money and our intellectual property and devaluing your currency to cause
[3:53:26.820 --> 3:53:32.180]  trade imbalances that era is over you're not going to be able to do that anymore under president
[3:53:32.180 --> 3:53:40.340]  trump by doing this guess what's happening the factories are shutting down in communist china
[3:53:40.900 --> 3:53:47.220]  the manufacturing is fleeing that country like never before and i hear this from my contacts
[3:53:47.220 --> 3:53:54.260]  in taiwan that taiwan is seeing increased business as the manufacturers flee communist china and are
[3:53:54.260 --> 3:53:59.940]  going to taiwan who used to make all the goods back in the 70s and 80s and part of the 90s by the
[3:53:59.940 --> 3:54:05.460]  way but then they shipped all their factories to china china told the taiwan companies okay you
[3:54:05.460 --> 3:54:10.900]  can have your factories here we just have to own 51 percent of your factories and so taiwan
[3:54:10.900 --> 3:54:16.260]  businessmen went there and did that and they all got screwed the chinese government just confiscated
[3:54:16.260 --> 3:54:22.500]  all their companies just stole them well now guess what taiwan is experiencing a resurgence
[3:54:22.500 --> 3:54:28.260]  in manufacturing as the companies are leaving china why does this matter to you because if we
[3:54:28.260 --> 3:54:36.900]  defeat china if trump defeats china america has a chance to beat this globalist tyranny this
[3:54:36.900 --> 3:54:42.980]  globalist scheme to try to crush the united states of america we have to defeat china and the best
[3:54:42.980 --> 3:54:47.620]  way to do that is economically and that's exactly what president trump is doing president trump
[3:54:47.620 --> 3:54:55.380]  knows exactly what's going on he's hitting them at their achilles heel if china cannot keep the
[3:54:55.380 --> 3:55:01.140]  money flowing to their people and their factories they will face a political uprising that will make
[3:55:01.140 --> 3:55:07.060]  tianaman square look like a walk in the park that's what's coming china will fall if we can keep
[3:55:07.060 --> 3:55:11.940]  this pressure on china will fall china will also fall for environmental reasons by the way they
[3:55:11.940 --> 3:55:18.020]  contaminate everything there are babies being born in china as mutants now with so much heavy
[3:55:18.020 --> 3:55:22.980]  metals pollution you know water contamination pollution of the air it's beyond anything that
[3:55:22.980 --> 3:55:28.100]  you've ever seen and of course ocasio-cortez and all these climate change lunatics in america
[3:55:28.100 --> 3:55:32.100]  they don't have any problem with china having most of the pollution in the world and and all the
[3:55:32.100 --> 3:55:36.660]  microplastics pollution going into the oceans and you know pushing coal pollution and factory
[3:55:36.660 --> 3:55:41.780]  pollution heavy metals into the atmosphere that rain down on the united states you never hear
[3:55:41.780 --> 3:55:50.420]  any complaint about china's pollution do you because of course it's never about environmentalism
[3:55:50.420 --> 3:55:58.260]  it's about punishing america and aoc and nancy polosi and adam schiff and senator feinstein
[3:55:58.260 --> 3:56:04.580]  they're all working for the same people the same philosophy of communist china they're all working
[3:56:04.580 --> 3:56:11.620]  to destroy this country we have to defeat communist china if america is to survive and trump is doing
[3:56:11.620 --> 3:56:18.500]  exactly that and i ask you now for your support in this i want you to boycott the nba unless they
[3:56:18.500 --> 3:56:23.140]  come out and denounce china and the organ harvesting and the rape and torture in the chinese prison
[3:56:23.140 --> 3:56:30.580]  gulags i want you to boycott every corporation in america that is complicit with this abuse in china
[3:56:30.580 --> 3:56:35.540]  corporations want to do business in china well guess what they're not going to get our business
[3:56:35.540 --> 3:56:40.420]  that's that should be our attitude we should support the hong kong protesters we should
[3:56:40.420 --> 3:56:45.540]  support the calls for freedom those are our brothers and sisters there in hong kong and again
[3:56:45.540 --> 3:56:53.140]  i've been there you know i i've shared uh sui chow dinners and and you know what they call dim sum
[3:56:53.140 --> 3:56:58.180]  dinners in uh in hong kong with these people they're wonderful people they love their freedom
[3:56:58.180 --> 3:57:02.340]  they had economic freedom until china took over and now they're losing all remaining rights we
[3:57:02.340 --> 3:57:06.740]  should support the people of hong kong we should denounce china and we should denounce every corporation
[3:57:06.740 --> 3:57:12.900]  that is in bed with china so start making choices folks start making decisions about which platforms
