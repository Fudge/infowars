[00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.400]  The legal organ market existed in Ukraine long before the outbreak of hostilities that were
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.360]  unleashed in the Donbass in 2014. When people have no money, when they have nothing else,
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.920]  kidneys are becoming the only form of currency available to them. As the war escalated, OSCE,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.160]  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, representatives confirmed that military
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.680]  and civilian bodies had their organs removed as a huge number of people went missing.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.680]  This dark criminal enterprise grew into a goldmine for the corrupt Ukrainian elite,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.280]  while the global child trafficking hub in Ukraine grew from 1991 and has exponentially peaked today
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.600]  as orphaned children are ensnared in the fortune of the greedy Ukrainian elite. In Ukraine this
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.400]  year alone, the National Police opened 217 criminal proceedings connected to modern-day
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.240]  slavery. Over there what we came across were the record books where people were actually ordering
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.160]  and on wait for children that had specific eye color, specific hair color, the potential height.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.520]  I don't know how it works, but I can tell you that the system over there is extremely flawed,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.960]  and then the question I have to ask myself is it intentionally flawed or is it accidentally flawed?
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.600]  As of today, the United States authorized 113 billion in taxpayer dollars to Ukraine.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.120]  We've sent thousands of anti-armor, anti-missiles, helicopters, drones, grenade launchers,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.400]  machine guns, rifles, radar systems, more than 50 million rounds of ammunition.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.680]  So all of you still supporting the effort to fund a neo-Nazi child organ harvesting hub,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.480]  what are your tax dollars really paying for?
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.320]  While Zelensky has imprisoned Ukrainian journalists and outlawed the orthodox religion,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.680]  Ukraine spokes-trainee and American Sarah Ashton Carillo exposed the true madness behind the
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.160]  Ukrainian totalitarian state. Simply put, I'm an American serving as a Ukrainian infantry soldier
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.760]  and combat medic who was brought from the zero line and assigned to the TDF's media team in the
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.000]  dual role of spokesperson and Russian disinformation analyst. Russians have a different culture.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.280]  Russians are Asian and ultimately they do come from the Mongols. They do come from a grouping of
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.920]  people who are wanting to be slaves. Let me also take a moment in my role as spokesperson for the
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.000]  AFU's territorial defense forces to state unequivocally that we in the TDF and across
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.440]  Ukraine believe journalists are heroes and have the right to report on Ukraine's war for liberation
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.840]  without interference. I made the statement that Russian propagandists will be hunted down
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.880]  and I refuse to apologize for that statement. But it doesn't end with the Carillo-Zelensky revelations.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.000]  The new world order wants all free speech eliminated. Elon Musk ended up getting this
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.280]  letter today from Brussels. It reads, Dear Mr. Musk, following the terrorist attacks carried out
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.400]  by Hamas against Israel, we have indications that your platform is being used to disseminate
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.200]  illegal content and disinformation in the EU. The CIA, Homeland Security, the FBI were
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.160]  pressuring Twitter, Facebook, Google to remove information. A court found that it is unconstitutional
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.080]  but there in the EU they're saying we have law enforcement authorities that are going to be
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.480]  contacting you demanding that you take down certain content and when they do you had better
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.080]  ensure that you are in contact with the relevant law enforcement authorities in your poll and
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.800]  ensure that you respond promptly to their requests. That is not just a suggestion,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.600]  that is the requirement of the law now. You are presenting new ways to minimize the spread of
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.840]  misinformation and you want to combat dangerous extremist views in the internet. This will also
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.640]  be important in understanding more about misinformation and disinformation online,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.040]  a challenge that we must as leaders address. We talked earlier about a post that Mr. Kennedy
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.800]  had at the beginning of the Biden administration. I just want the record to reflect that that post
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:31.360]  has not been taken down. So I'm wondering about the extent of censorship when the post is still
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.320]  there. Wow, the irony and cognitive dissonance from the other side of the aisle. It's deafening.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.560]  You could cut it with a knife. They are at the same time denying that censorship is occurring
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.240]  but suggesting that there's more material that needs to be censored. They are working towards
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.040]  a day when their propaganda can wash over free speech like a polluted tsunami. John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.720]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.240]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.720]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.040]  them. But we're not just exposing their operation. In my new book, we give you the solutions to build
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.040]  a new better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs. This is the
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.800]  Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance. It's a
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.360]  companion to my last book. It was a number one worldwide bestseller. And this book is even
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.920]  thicker and even more powerful. Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarsTore.com

[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.560]  It's Friday, October 13th, 2023. Strap yourselves in.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.880]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:30.880]  All right, I have been a busy beaver.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:44.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:56.800]  The Communist Party, the Socialist Party, Antifa and every other scumbag criminal organization
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.680]  is running around foaming at the mouth across Europe, across Canada, across the US, across
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:12.240]  Australia, calling for death to Jews. Now, let's be clear. I don't like heroin.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.760]  But just because I don't like heroin doesn't mean I also don't hate cocaine. I tried them both in
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.600]  high school. Horrible drugs. I'd advise anybody out there never try them. You feel like you're
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.080]  running over by car after you take them the next day. So I don't like what Israel's doing.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.560]  And I sure don't like what the Muslims are doing. And let's just get that straight.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.520]  I am my own identity. I am not an Israeli. I am not a Zionist. I am not a follower of Muhammad.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.840]  I am not an Islamist. And I am sick of my entire life, 49 years on this planet,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.800]  hearing more about Israel and more about the Muslims than I hear about our country,
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.080]  where you got everybody living. I'm an American.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.360]  And that's where I stand on this. But to watch Black Lives Matter and the left everywhere
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:12.160]  celebrate people on motorized hang gliders coming into a peace rally rave with a bunch of
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:20.800]  delusional leftist Jews who are literally thinking they're safe right next to Gaza,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.120]  unarmed, is disgusting. Both groups.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:32.000]  Obviously, Hezbollah 100 times worse, but also the delusional people at that party. I mean,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.680]  let me tell you, I'm a tough guy. I'm not going to an all-night party. I'll go to those anyways,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.160]  next to two and a half million people who want to kill me, where they hear the music and the party.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:47.600]  I mean, it's absolutely insane. But that's the delusion of the left. You see everywhere going
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.880]  into the worst neighborhoods and getting stabbed and murdered because they promoted all this
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.880]  anti-white garbage that extends to Jews because they're white, according to the left.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.000]  And the Democratic Party's real anti-Semitism issue. I don't hate Jews because they're Jews.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.800]  I don't hate Jews because they're Orthodox Jews. I don't hate Jews because they believe in God.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.640]  In fact, I admire a lot of the culture and poetry and ideas of Jews. That said,
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:19.520]  I, for my entire broadcasting career, have been savagely attacked and lied about by leftist Jews.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.360]  And they've abused me. They've abused my family. They've attacked me. And they feel like they have
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:32.160]  a right to go after me using the political power they've got. That's wrong. But it's also wrong to
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:40.640]  come in with hang gliders and kill a bunch of innocent people. And so I am disgusted by all
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:47.200]  disgusted by all of it. And I've done nothing to the Palestinians and nothing to the Jews.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.840]  And I live in central Texas. And, you know, I mean, I feel bad for the Uyghurs. Three million
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.760]  of them in a slave camp with, you know, slaves for Apple and other U.S. corporations. They're
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.120]  Muslims, but I'm against what's happening to them. And I'm against what's happening to these Jews
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.440]  being slaughtered. And I think it's terrible what's happening in the carpet bombing of the
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:10.320]  Gaza Strip, the Palestinians. But it is not my dog. It is not my fight. And I am
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:20.800]  American and I am so tired of turning on the news and hearing about Saudi Arabia and Israel
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:32.080]  and Germany and the U.K. and France and Russia and China and South Africa and Nigeria and Mexico
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.160]  and Chile and Brazil and Timbuktu, man. Our borders are wide open. Hundreds of thousands
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.080]  are dying from fentanyl, mass suicide. I don't care what color you are. We're screwed as a country.
[00:10:44.187 --> 00:10:54.427]  And we've sent hundreds of billions to Zelensky, that cokehead, and we've got war with Russia
[00:10:54.427 --> 00:10:58.227]  and I am just disgusted by all of it.
[00:10:58.227 --> 00:11:04.427]  And I refuse to dance to the tune or be pulled by the strings of the Muslims or whoever is
[00:11:04.427 --> 00:11:06.467]  in power at the time in Israel.
[00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:10.827]  I'm supposed to just salute the flag because I'm pro-Israel and do whatever they say and
[00:11:10.827 --> 00:11:11.827]  then it's political.
[00:11:11.827 --> 00:11:12.907]  I'm tired of it.
[00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:20.006]  Now, I've always wanted to go to Israel. It's a historic scene. I've never gotten around to it.
[00:11:20.006 --> 00:11:28.006]  Every time I'm about to go, my mother's, my wife's mother was about to go to Israel and Egypt for a trip she'd been planning for years.
[00:11:28.006 --> 00:11:38.006]  It got cancelled obviously. I would feel safe going to Israel. I would not feel safe going to any of those Islamic areas because I would not be safe.
[00:11:38.006 --> 00:11:45.006]  So at the end of the day, it's the best house in a bad neighborhood. Israel is the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[00:11:45.006 --> 00:11:50.006]  It doesn't mean I'm moving into the neighborhood. It doesn't mean I identify with the neighborhood, but I don't hate the neighborhood.
[00:11:50.006 --> 00:12:03.006]  And I refuse to hate the Jews even if the left tries to use Jews as a political control valve to bully Americans who they know have a soft spot for Israel because Israel is seen as the underdog.
[00:12:04.006 --> 00:12:09.006]  When all the Arab countries ganged up on them, that was wrong. Well, Israel's not really getting ganged up on now.
[00:12:09.006 --> 00:12:16.006]  They've got thousands of nuclear weapons. But that said, I don't want war with Israel and I don't sit back and go, yeah, give it to them Jews.
[00:12:16.006 --> 00:12:20.006]  Boy, let's kill some Jews. I'm disgusted by it.
[00:12:23.006 --> 00:12:24.006]  I want to throw up.
[00:12:25.184 --> 00:12:30.184]  Now that said, I have to talk about it.
[00:12:30.184 --> 00:12:33.184]  And I've talked a lot about this.
[00:12:33.184 --> 00:12:35.184]  I talked about it recently on air.
[00:12:35.184 --> 00:12:37.184]  I'm sick of looking at Joe Biden and Obama.
[00:12:37.184 --> 00:12:39.184]  I'm sick of looking at Hillary.
[00:12:39.184 --> 00:12:42.184]  So my dislike of them is palpable.
[00:12:42.184 --> 00:12:49.184]  But it's the same thing on dealing with the Muslims.
[00:12:49.184 --> 00:12:53.184]  But it's worse.
[00:12:53.184 --> 00:12:54.184]  But it's worse.
[00:12:54.184 --> 00:12:55.184]  I'll just tell you.
[00:12:55.184 --> 00:12:58.184]  I am disgusted by the politics in Israel.
[00:12:58.184 --> 00:12:59.184]  So are the Jews over there.
[00:12:59.184 --> 00:13:01.184]  The majority of them think they're in a dictatorship.
[00:13:01.184 --> 00:13:02.184]  I think they are, basically.
[00:13:02.184 --> 00:13:04.184]  But, I mean, the Muslims.
[00:13:04.184 --> 00:13:09.184]  If America's so bad, stop coming over here.
[00:13:09.184 --> 00:13:12.184]  Stop coming here and signing up for welfare,
[00:13:12.184 --> 00:13:14.184]  and then walking around in your nightgowns all day
[00:13:14.184 --> 00:13:16.184]  and bitching about me.
[00:13:16.184 --> 00:13:18.184]  So, on a scale of 1 to 10,
[00:13:18.184 --> 00:13:22.184]  my dislike of the pedophiles is a 10.
[00:13:22.184 --> 00:13:24.184]  Of the Muslims, it's about a 5.
[00:13:24.184 --> 00:13:29.184]  And of the Jews that are liberals trying to bully me
[00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.184]  and everybody in America, a 1.
[00:13:31.184 --> 00:13:34.184]  But it doesn't mean I like you because you're a 1.
[00:13:34.184 --> 00:13:36.184]  Let me be completely frank with you.
[00:13:36.184 --> 00:13:39.184]  It's wrong to put all Muslims in one group.
[00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:41.184]  It's wrong to put all Jews in a group.
[00:13:41.184 --> 00:13:42.184]  But if you're a Trump supporter,
[00:13:42.184 --> 00:13:46.184]  you get called an anti-Semite when you're supporting Israel.
[00:13:46.184 --> 00:13:49.184]  And so you're like, okay, I've been supporting Israel's existence.
[00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:50.184]  I know they're not perfect.
[00:13:50.184 --> 00:13:52.184]  You know, I'm trying to be nice to Israel,
[00:13:52.184 --> 00:13:53.184]  and I'm trying to understand their perspective.
[00:13:53.184 --> 00:13:57.184]  And then I get to be demonized all day long
[00:13:57.184 --> 00:13:59.184]  by the ADL and the rest of these groups.
[00:13:59.184 --> 00:14:01.184]  At a certain point, I'm like, okay,
[00:14:01.184 --> 00:14:05.184]  I supported you and you slapped me around and shit all over me.
[00:14:05.184 --> 00:14:07.184]  I'm done with you.
[00:14:07.184 --> 00:14:09.184]  But at least you don't want to make me convert to your religion.
[00:14:09.184 --> 00:14:11.184]  That's a positive thing.
[00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.184]  And I'm not attacking Judaism.
[00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.184]  It's actually a very interesting, ancient, amazing thing.
[00:14:14.184 --> 00:14:15.184]  I think it's very interesting.
[00:14:15.184 --> 00:14:18.184]  I like all ancient, interesting things.
[00:14:18.184 --> 00:14:19.184]  I respect culture.
[00:14:19.184 --> 00:14:20.184]  I respect groups of people.
[00:14:20.184 --> 00:14:26.184]  But at least the Jews don't try to make you convert over to their religion.
[00:14:26.184 --> 00:14:32.184]  And so that's why I fundamentally do not like being put in a position
[00:14:32.184 --> 00:14:35.184]  where I have to sit there and choose sides.
[00:14:35.184 --> 00:14:39.184]  I want the Jews to be either Americans or Israelis.
[00:14:39.184 --> 00:14:44.184]  And I want them to choose which allegiance they're with.
[00:14:44.184 --> 00:14:46.184]  And then I'll back you all the way.
[00:14:47.184 --> 00:14:49.184]  And the Muslims, we know.
[00:14:49.184 --> 00:14:50.184]  And I hope the phone's up.
[00:14:50.184 --> 00:14:51.184]  Maybe Muslims will call in.
[00:14:51.184 --> 00:14:57.184]  But we know your main allegiance is to either the Shias or the Sunnis,
[00:14:57.184 --> 00:14:59.184]  the Shiites or the Sunnis.
[00:14:59.184 --> 00:15:04.184]  And so all I'm saying is you are incompatible.
[00:15:04.184 --> 00:15:05.184]  I'm not your enemy.
[00:15:05.184 --> 00:15:06.184]  I don't want to kill you.
[00:15:06.184 --> 00:15:08.184]  I don't want to run your life.
[00:15:08.184 --> 00:15:09.184]  But let me explain something.
[00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:13.184]  I'm not submitting to Allah.
[00:15:13.184 --> 00:15:17.184]  I'm not submitting to Hollywood or the transgender gay cult.
[00:15:17.184 --> 00:15:25.184]  Anybody trying to make me submit to your crap is, quite frankly, my enemy.
[00:15:25.184 --> 00:15:27.184]  You made yourself my enemy.
[00:15:27.184 --> 00:15:29.184]  I know full well if I showed up at Gaza Strip,
[00:15:29.184 --> 00:15:31.184]  I'd get killed or kidnapped in five minutes.
[00:15:31.184 --> 00:15:35.184]  So don't sit here and tell me choose a side
[00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:39.184]  when Israel has become its own cancer to itself.
[00:15:39.184 --> 00:15:42.184]  But you are stage four brain cancer.
[00:15:42.184 --> 00:15:46.184]  And I just want you to know I don't like any of your political leaders.
[00:15:46.184 --> 00:15:48.184]  I reject it all, and I'm not part of your paradigm.
[00:15:48.184 --> 00:15:49.184]  Get it?
[00:15:49.184 --> 00:15:53.184]  I'm not part of your sick, ongoing tribal warfare.
[00:15:53.184 --> 00:15:54.184]  Got that?
[00:15:54.184 --> 00:15:56.184]  Keep me out of your crap.
[00:15:56.184 --> 00:15:57.184]  And the jihadis are now rising up.
[00:15:57.184 --> 00:15:59.184]  We'll talk about that when we come up.
[00:15:59.184 --> 00:16:04.184]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[00:16:04.184 --> 00:16:07.184]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children
[00:16:07.184 --> 00:16:09.184]  for sex slavery worldwide?
[00:16:09.184 --> 00:16:12.184]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[00:16:12.184 --> 00:16:13.184]  Well, I know where you are.
[00:16:13.184 --> 00:16:16.184]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now,

[00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:28.184]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening,
[00:16:28.184 --> 00:16:31.184]  defeating the globalists, and launching the next great renaissance.
[00:16:31.184 --> 00:16:35.184]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[00:16:35.184 --> 00:16:38.184]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, a more powerful book.
[00:16:38.184 --> 00:16:41.184]  And just like the last book went to number one,
[00:16:41.184 --> 00:16:43.184]  it is up to you to send it to number one right now.
[00:16:43.184 --> 00:16:45.184]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists,
[00:16:45.184 --> 00:16:47.184]  and it funds the Infowars.

[00:18:58.184 --> 00:19:00.184]  You wanted to plug RainForce, do you like RainForce?
[00:19:00.184 --> 00:19:03.184]  Yeah, so, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:05.184]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:19:05.184 --> 00:19:07.184]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz,
[00:19:07.184 --> 00:19:09.184]  four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[00:19:09.184 --> 00:19:11.184]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:19:11.184 --> 00:19:15.184]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:19:15.184 --> 00:19:19.184]  What I always need is, I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:19:19.184 --> 00:19:23.184]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:19:23.184 --> 00:19:28.184]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:19:28.184 --> 00:19:32.184]  I'll take RainForce in the morning, right before I go to my computer,
[00:19:32.184 --> 00:19:36.184]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours, writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:40.184]  So, it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day,
[00:19:40.184 --> 00:19:42.184]  and it helps me with my writing.
[00:19:42.184 --> 00:19:44.184]  All right, we love you. We'll be right back.
[00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:48.184]  Get your RainForce+, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:19:48.184 --> 00:19:50.184]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:19:58.184 --> 00:19:59.184]  .
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:07.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:38.260]  Alright, I just burned a segment, frustrated and mad, and it's being honest with people.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.260]  The truth is, I love little Muslim children, I love little Jewish children, I love little
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:48.260]  Christian children, I love Hindu children, I love Buddhist children, I love children
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.260]  that are born to these horrible atheist families.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.260]  I just want to stop killing, and I want to stop fighting.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.260]  But let's just move on, because this is me being honest here.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:04.260]  I don't want my disgust with some of the politics that come out of Israel or our own
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:09.260]  government to make this an issue of, I'm against Israel.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.260]  Because I've made that very clear over the years, I'm not against Israel.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:18.260]  Because I know the left and George Soros and the most evil forces on earth, and their larger
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.260]  global plan, know that there's a couple billion Muslims and growing, and they've got a plan
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.260]  to have the Muslims conquer us in some weird merger of Islam and the left.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:33.260]  And if you go to any university and you go, Antifa and a bunch of leftist Jews and others
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:39.260]  are there orchestrating and quarterbacking the jihadists that are running around.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:44.260]  And so the big on-the-ground threat is these Islamists.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:52.260]  And we've seen Black Lives Matter and all the rest of these organizations celebrating
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:59.260]  this attack on Israel, and then when Israel attacks back indiscriminately, which is what
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.260]  total war is, when you launch total war, you get total war.
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.260]  Another argument is, well, Israel did this too.
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.260]  I get all that.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.260]  It's escalating, just like the Russia war.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.260]  I'm not a Russian, but I'm against this war being started.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.260]  Because the West started it.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:20.260]  And so we have in this country hundreds of thousands of military-age men who are part
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.260]  of Hamas and Hezbollah.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:30.260]  And they are here, and they have said they're going, according to their leadership of Hamas
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.260]  and Hezbollah, start launching attacks in the West.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:39.260]  Now, even when that happens, and it's happening in Europe all the time, I'm going to be against
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.260]  the Islamists that did that.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.260]  But who I'm really going to blame, because I'm not a moron, is our governments that opened
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:56.260]  the borders up, and the UN, and Klaus Schwab, and all these organizations that Soros is heavily
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.260]  involved in, bringing them here.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.260]  So if something happens to any of my friends, family, or any other American, whether it's
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:07.260]  a synagogue that gets attacked, or a church that gets attacked, they're attacking the
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:14.260]  Hindus, the Muslims hate them, anybody gets killed in a religious attack, I am going to
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:20.260]  hold O'Biden, and that means Obama, responsible for that.
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:25.260]  So they want to burn the American flag, they want to do all this crap, great.
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.260]  Do it in your own craphole country.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:33.260]  But the other side of that is, I don't want to be in your craphole country.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.260]  And I don't want to be funding attacks on your craphole.
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:42.260]  I want to shut down travel from your shithole to our country, and I want you to live with
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.260]  yourself, and enjoy the hell you've got.
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.260]  But I don't want to be there so you can play the part of the victim.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:54.260]  And that's exactly what Hamas and Hezbollah did, was go and bloody the nose of Israel,
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:24:03.260]  to get Israel all wound up, to go on their own crusade, and destroy you to try to suck
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.260]  in Iran, and Saudi Arabia, and everybody else.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.260]  And of course Iran wants that.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.260]  So I am disgusted by this, I am sick of this.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:18.260]  I know the political powers over the Muslims, and over our government, and over Israel,
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.260]  knew this was coming.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.260]  They got polls out, almost 90% of Israelis believe the government knew it was coming
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.260]  and let it happen.
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.260]  Yeah, because you got a brain.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.260]  Don't be naive and don't lie to yourself.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:38.260]  And so thousands a month, of what they call other than Mexican, come across each little
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.260]  border section.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.260]  What they call the Border Patrol.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.260]  And most of them aren't from Latin America, or even Africa.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.260]  They're from the Middle East, and China.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:54.260]  They are pouring into the country, and they're here, and all they get is one cell phone directive,
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.260]  or one Jihad order, like you've been hearing for 513, we'll see what happens, they hope
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.260]  nothing.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:05.260]  And then they unleash their attacks on us, and then we lose our freedoms in the process.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:17.260]  And so, I believe the State of Israel has a right to exist, because those people have
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:22.260]  a tie back to that place for thousands of years, and you can argue, well, they're not
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.260]  Jews, and I've heard all that crap.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.260]  But the point is, they're not going anywhere.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.260]  Russia has a right to exist.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.260]  The United States has a right to exist.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.260]  The United States has a right to exist.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.260]  The United States should not be sucked into all this.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:42.260]  Because Israel's got thousands of nuclear weapons, folks, and if you try to go in there
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.260]  and actually drive them out, and if anybody ever actually overran Israel, and was actually
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.260]  beating them, they're going to nuke the Middle East, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.260]  So I'm going to explain how this works.
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.260]  We have nuclear weapons.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:58.260]  I become Death Destroyer of Worlds, is what Oppenheimer said, it's true.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:04.260]  So, Russia has a right to exist because they have nuclear weapons.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.260]  Israel has a right to exist.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.260]  Just like you come to my house trying to rob me, I got a bunch of guns, good chance is
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.260]  you're going to die.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.260]  I got a right to exist because I say I got a right to exist.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.260]  And the Muslims are doubling their numbers every 30 years.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.260]  It's not like they're not taking the world over.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.260]  It's not like there's one little group of them left in one little country, and everybody's
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.260]  getting rid of them.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.260]  Muslims are expanding everywhere.
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.260]  So let the Jews have their country.
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.260]  Leave them alone.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.260]  But I'll tell the leftist Jews this, who want to get rid of my country and get rid of my
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.260]  guns, no.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.260]  When you get involved in my politics and you say I'm anti-Semitic because I don't support
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:52.260]  some of the things your politicians are doing, Netanyahu only has like 30% support in his
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.260]  own country in the parliament.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.260]  He's still there.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.260]  I'm not against Canadians.
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.260]  I'm against Justin Trudeau.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.260]  I'm not against North Koreans.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.260]  I'm against Kim Jong-un.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.260]  I'm not against Chinese.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.260]  I'm against Xi Jinping.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.260]  And I'm not comparing Netanyahu to Xi Jinping.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.260]  My point is I'm sick.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.260]  It's like if your neighbors beat each other up.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.260]  They're two drunks, husband and wife, they're beating each other up every day.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.260]  And you know, you stop calling the cops and they try to rope you into their home disputes.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.260]  You're like, listen, go kill yourselves, okay?
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.260]  Stop sucking me into your crap.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.260]  Can't I just be left alone by you?
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.260]  Muslims, you're doubling your numbers every 30 years.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.260]  You're taking over.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.260]  On average, you're the biggest welfare recipients in every country.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.260]  You come milk the system.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.260]  You have six kids and you come to my country and you tell me I'm bad because of what color
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.260]  I am or I'm a Christian.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.260]  Leave me alone.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.260]  Get off my yard.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.260]  That's the same thing for the ADL and the same thing for the Simon Wiesenthal Center
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.260]  and all you guys.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.260]  You're discredited.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.260]  You're jokes.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.260]  Any real Nazi, you support them.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:02.260]  Like the one, an actual SS officer that actually rounded up and killed Jews en masse in standing
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.260]  ovations a few weeks ago.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.260]  And has he been arrested?
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.260]  Has he been hauled back to Israel?
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.260]  No.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:12.260]  They only haul back Alzheimer patients because they can't defend themselves.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:16.260]  When it's a real Nazi, you don't grab them because that'd be a little embarrassing for
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.260]  the U.S. and Canadian government, wouldn't it?
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.260]  And the Vatican and the rat lines.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.260]  I know way too much.
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:27.260]  And I will not sit here and be the villain of the Muslims or the villain to the leftist
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.260]  Jews or the villain to Black Lives Matter or the villain to anybody else.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.260]  I've done nothing to any of you.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.260]  I just want to live my life and be productive and be a good person.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.260]  Leave me alone and leave my kids alone.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.260]  And stop trying to chop their balls off.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.260]  All right, I'm going to stop.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.260]  I'm bloated for bear.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.260]  I got so many clips, so much news.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.260]  I am just disgusted by all this.
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.260]  Absolutely disgusted.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.260]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.260]  I'm going to hit it all straight ahead, Infowars.com.
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.260]  Last year we put this book out.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.260]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.260]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.260]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:12.260]  The Great Awakening.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:16.260]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.260]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:23.260]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them,
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.260]  and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.260]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.260]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.260]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at Infowars.com.

[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.260]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.260]  I thought it was next week.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.260]  I come in this morning.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.260]  I'm in a warehouse ready to roll.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.260]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.260]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.260]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.260]  Look how full this bottle is.

[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.260]  At InfowarsStore.com
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:16.520]  The program leftists failed to silence. It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:30.520]  Well the global day of rage has begun as former Hamas chief called for attacks around the world.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:37.520]  Demonstrations, rage, they're storming the borders of Israel, there's riots in France, violent demonstrations in the United States.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:45.520]  And there's like two to one little leftists there supporting the Islamists in places like France and here. Wow.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:52.520]  Talk about ridiculous. Why don't you ask the Lebanese Christians that were the majority for thousands of years,
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:34:02.520]  hundreds of years where Islam existed, driven out of their country in the last 30 years, now an Islamic state.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:11.520]  So no, just because I don't like a lot of the policies and things going on in Israel, which is not one unified block,
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.520]  political parties fight with each other, does not mean I then endorse Islam. Can't you figure it out?
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:28.520]  I don't like tomatoes and I don't like cucumbers either. I don't hate cucumbers or tomatoes, it's just not something I'm focused on.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:36.520]  And it's the same thing. Our country is falling apart. Our country is committing suicide. Our country is losing its life expectancy.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:42.520]  Our country's been hit with poison shots. Our country sent hundreds of billions of dollars to literally fund Nazis to attack the Russians in Ukraine.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:47.520]  That is wrong. I want to care about our country, America first again.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:55.520]  Because if you're not running your own house and if your own people aren't taken care of, that means Muslim, Christian, Jew, you name it,
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.520]  then none of us are free, are we? All right, I'm done ranting. I want to cover a bunch of news.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.520]  I'll put the phones up next hour here on this live Friday edition.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.520]  But let me go over what's really happening in the Middle East.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.520]  Like I said, Saturday, and people said, Jones just said Hamas is behind this or Hezbollah is behind this.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.520]  But it's really Hamas. No, it's Hezbollah. And that's who directed it.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.520]  And that's who funded it. And Biden gave him the money and Biden gave him the weapons.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.520]  You got to ask why? Oh, we're not talking about Hunter Biden's laptop now.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.520]  We're not talking about open borders now. We're not talking about the national debt now.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.520]  We're not talking about Ukraine now. We're not talking about any of that right now, are we?
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.520]  Hunter is out of the news. Border is out of the news. Ukraine's out of the news.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.520]  Speaker drama is out of the news. Biden crime plan was out of the news.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.520]  Worldwide immigrant invasion is out of the news. Horrible economy is out of the news.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:50.860]  pedophilia is out of the news Jeffrey Epstein's out of the news it's all out
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:58.080]  of the news the next new thing isn't Ukraine we had the votes to stop the
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.600]  funding now it's on to Israel isn't it and I said this on Saturday and I said
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.620]  this Sunday and I said it Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday there
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:15.860]  is no way Israel that has these groups in translated into Hebrew means living
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:21.740]  with the Arabs or amongst the Arabs they've had it since the 50s and they
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.940]  there are a lot of the Jews are Sephardic or Middle Eastern and they
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.860]  genetically are basically very similar to the Muslims or the Arabs and they
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.660]  look like them and they speak Arabic and they've got tens of thousands of them in
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.180]  the Gaza Strip of those two million people alone and you don't tell me that
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:44.220]  a giant army of people and weapons and that invasion wasn't known by Israel and
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.100]  they didn't know it was coming not sure the people on the border guards the
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.820]  military the rank-and-file even the colonels didn't know the generals didn't
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:58.580]  know but at the highest levels of Shin Bet and Mossad and CIA and mi6 they knew
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:05.820]  and now it turns out five six days before the invasion last Saturday on the
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:11.980]  Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur the Egyptian said we believe there's about to
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:21.460]  be a major attack on Israel representative Michael McCall one of the
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:25.940]  committee chairman says there seems to have been an intelligence failure we're
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:30.300]  not quite sure how we missed it we're not quite sure how Israel missed it we
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:36.420]  know Egypt had warned the Israelis days before the event this could happen first
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:40.779]  they said three days now they're saying five six days a week we know that Egypt
[00:37:40.779 --> 00:37:44.820]  had warned the Israelis three days prior House Republicans says of a mass
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:52.060]  attack market watch we're gonna get to that club here in just a moment
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.740]  continuing terrorist watch list encounters at u.s. border up to 7,000
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:03.020]  percent under Biden CBP intercepts messages from terrorists seeking
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:10.540]  personal info on border agents and family members Soros asked American
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.820]  opened its borders to Mossad funded open borders and I'm on supporting black
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:19.500]  lives matter figure it out yet I'm on says 13 hostages killed and strikes on
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:26.820]  Gaza hole from earlier this year found more Democrats sympathize with
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.740]  Palestinians than with Israelis let that sink in because it's one thing to
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.380]  be critical of Israel and Israel's a mess just like we are but it's another
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:43.220]  thing to literally say I support the Islamic jihad I support Hamas I support
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:50.860]  Hezbollah that is crazy because they don't support your freedom Americans
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:56.220]  killed by Hamas rises to 27 over a dozen captives as u.s. arranges evacuation
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:03.420]  flights Israel gives 1.1 million North Gaza 24 hours evacuate UN warrants of
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:13.060]  calamitous situation you don't think Hamas and Hezbollah didn't know it was
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:18.220]  gonna happen when they did that to Israel no and they knew exactly what's
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.740]  gonna happen and now they're gonna so look we need everybody else to attack
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:26.940]  Israel because Israel's now done this like you go hit a hornet's nest and
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:32.900]  wonder why you got hornet sting you so the globalist greenlit this they gave
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:38.020]  the money to Iran it's all been done you better ask yourselves why and what
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:41.300]  happens when the terror attacks start in the West well we'll just lose our
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:47.020]  freedoms how many hundreds of people got killed at one French nightclub by
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:52.460]  just a few guys with machine guns that will look like a cakewalk compared to
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:59.580]  what is being prepared to happen so here's Congressman McCaul talking about
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:06.540]  it there seems to have been a failure of intelligence as well and we're not
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.900]  quite sure how we missed it we're not quite sure how Israel missed it we know
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:16.620]  that it is Egypt had warned the Israelis three days prior that an event
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.500]  event like this could happen we know that this had been planned perhaps as
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:26.900]  long as a year ago the other concern but don't worry we'll just give homeland
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.860]  security more funding oh but they run the open border run the human smuggling
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.900]  and say the main threat is Christian conservatives and Catholics and that
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.460]  we're a terror threat so figured it out yet folks because there's this depth of
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:45.779]  logic like they let Islamists attack us and then they get more power here's
[00:40:45.779 --> 00:40:54.060]  Jake Tapper talking about how it's eye-opening that the mainline culture at
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:41:00.580]  US universities is anti-semitic and anti-israel which it is I mean it's
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:08.020]  blaring but what adds insult to injury is then the left turns around and calls
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:15.180]  Trump anti-semitic and myself that and claims we are Nazis when our main
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.620]  benefactor is not a Nazi it's the American people your main benefactor is
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:24.460]  George Soros that said the best time in his life he was exhilarating and he's
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:29.940]  not ashamed of it was working for Adolf Hitler I mean you can't make that up
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.180]  imagine if Donald Trump had worked for the Nazis you'd be like oh my god he's
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.620]  terrible which you know that'd be bad wouldn't it but you see with the left
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:43.940]  it's blame us for what they are and remember the Islamist sister ally with
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:51.380]  the left so that's what makes them the bad guys here doesn't mean we fawn at
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:55.380]  Israel and whatever politicians in control that's Israel so we bow down to
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.540]  whoever's over there no we're not against the people over there I know I'm
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:04.200]  not but I'm not gonna sit here also and just go oh it's Israel I just salute the
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.779]  flag whatever it says I don't salute our government it's not our government it's
[00:42:07.779 --> 00:42:16.100]  a hijacked government so so let's skip this break here's the clip of Jake
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:20.060]  Tapper and I want to play the clip of Senator Rand Paul reveals that the
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.140]  United States is still funding the Taliban and the Palestinians which is
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:29.020]  true here it is this does a real eye-opening period for a lot of people a
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:32.900]  lot of Democrats a lot of progressives in terms of anti-semitism on the left a
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:38.100]  lot of people who seem more shocked at dehumanizing language used by world
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:43.120]  leaders to describe Hamas then what come us actually perpetrated on Saturday
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:48.420]  now we're in this situation that Israel needs emergency aid how will you deal
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:52.580]  with that what is your recommendation the same way I always have is that I'm all
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.700]  for the aid in fact we had this debate about a year ago with Democrats they
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:00.540]  wanted a billion dollars more for Iron Dome and I said sure I'm for that let's
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.980]  take it from a fund that we're funding the Taliban with there's still a couple
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.779]  billion dollars out there that we are the Afghan reconstruction fund that's
[00:43:07.779 --> 00:43:12.020]  going to the Taliban to people who are not our friends who are our enemies why
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.900]  are we funding the Taliban they think that somehow when you give money to
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.660]  your enemies it makes them less of an adversary we still get money to the
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:23.140]  Palestinian Authority we give money to the PLO so what I would say is sure let's
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:26.980]  fund whatever Israel needs now but let's take it from funds that we're
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:30.500]  sending the countries that don't like us that burn our flag that chant into
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.580]  America why are we giving money to people who hate us so let's give it to
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.500]  our friends if need be but let's make sure we take it from somewhere else in
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:41.660]  the budget and that may or may not make me very popular but I insist on this all
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.900]  of the time and if you don't do it that's why you wind up with a 33
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:49.940]  trillion dollar debt well I mean has the administration commented on the fact
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:54.700]  that we've been funding giving money to the Palestinian Authority I have these
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.940]  battles all the time I battled the head of Senate foreign relations over this
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:01.220]  many times on the floor over whether we should still be giving money to the
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:04.940]  Taliban whether we still should be giving money to the Palestinians so years
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.860]  ago I introduced the first bill that would have gotten rid of these martyr
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.420]  payments where people who are blowing themselves up and blowing up Israeli
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:15.060]  civilians were getting payments but it was coming out of a fund that the US
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:19.580]  government was funding this one so I was the first one to introduce that and they
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.900]  got rid of some of the payments but some of those payments are still going
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.860]  to the Palestinians and I'm for eliminating all of that foreign aid to
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:29.300]  the Palestinian Authority senator we want to know I am for reinstating what
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:35.420]  Trump did um Islamic Muslim travel ban from seven countries who officially say
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:45.740]  destroy the United States no visas don't come here go away
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]  That's where I stand. And let's roll some of the B-roll for TV viewers.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000]  You've got people storming the borders of Israel from all sides right now.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000]  We've got in France giant Islamic riots going on.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]  We have absolute bedlam breaking out.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]  Where these people come here, and they get on welfare,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000]  and then they complain that we're not blowing Israel up.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000]  Now, why would our governments, look at this footage, bring these people in?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000]  Get a job. But no, they're in the evil western country.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]  They're here to get the welfare.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]  The average Islamist is like 80% or more is on welfare.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]  Can I go to a Muslim country and get some welfare? No.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000]  So I'm just sick of it. You don't like me, then don't be here.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]  Go away. Go away.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.160]  I mean look at these people.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.160]  And the footage and the things they say and all of it.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.160]  We're going to bring down Israel.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.160]  And soon the great Satan America.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.160]  Good. Get out.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.160]  Get out.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.160]  And it's all out of the universities.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.160]  It's all just like our government is funding radical Islam.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.160]  It's like our government is giving them money by the billions.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.160]  Giving them weapons by the billions.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:18.160]  And they bring them in here to be a destabilizing force.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:25.160]  And there's footage in Europe and Australia everywhere of the Jews out showing solidarity, protesting.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.160]  But are those Jews right-wingers?
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.160]  Are those Jews calling to control our borders?
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.160]  Not many of them.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.160]  So, you know, I'll say this.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.160]  I'm very sad for the Jews that got killed and the Palestinians.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:46.160]  I'm very upset to see this needless war and all this garbage.
[00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:50.230]  But we can pull the headline up.
[00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:55.230]  Israeli Defense Minister, we're going to arm all the Jews in Israel.
[00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:58.230]  First it was going to be in southern Israel three days ago.
[00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:01.230]  Yesterday they said, you know what?
[00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:07.230]  Any Jew, any Israeli in Israel that's an Israeli citizen can have a gun permit.
[00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:12.230]  Aren't you nice? Aren't you sweet?
[00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:15.230]  You live next to the Gaza Strip. Two million people want to kill you.
[00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:16.230]  You're a mile away from it.
[00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:22.230]  And then you move there and you have dance parties out in the desert right across from the fence.
[00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.230]  But people want to kill you.
[00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:26.230]  So here's the deal.
[00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:30.230]  If the Jews don't want guns and they want to live in a hostile area and all get killed,
[00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:32.230]  I'm sad for them, but that's their business.
[00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.230]  That's basically a form of suicide.
[00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:37.230]  But don't take my guns.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:48.800]  And you can't swing a stick in the dark in D.C. without hitting some leftist Jewish lobby that wants to take the American people's guns.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:57.800]  And imagine the attitude of the majority of the Israelis that never even saw it, living in a tiny country surrounded by enemies to own guns.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:03.800]  You're your own worst enemy, not me! I don't want to kill you, I don't want to hurt you, I wish you prosperity.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.800]  And to have your religion and live in peace and be productive members of society.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.800]  But it's time for Jews particularly to choose a side.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:20.800]  Are you with the West? Are you with right to self-defense? Are you against communism?
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.800]  Or do you embrace those tenets?
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:29.800]  And if you embrace communism and disarmament and enslavement, then go!
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.800]  Go live amongst the Arabs and get killed. I'm not the one killing you.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.800]  Go kill yourself. Take your children with you. I'm sorry you're going to get them killed too.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.800]  I'm not saying I want your kids killed, but your bizarre behavior is causing this.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:49.800]  We can't just point at the Muslims and say they're out of control and a bunch of babies and they kill each other constantly.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.800]  And they've got all these issues, which they do.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.800]  Great. Let them live in their own area.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:59.800]  Let us control our countries and stop them coming here.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:05.800]  Don't have the ADL attack me because I want to kick radical Muslims out and want to stop them coming here en masse.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.800]  They're here to conquer us.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:13.800]  Don't you point your finger at me trying to survive and live and say I'm the bad person!
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.800]  I reject that! And I'm sick of you!
[00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:27.230]  Just like I'm sick of the CIA, the FBI, the Democrat, Republican Party opening our damn
[00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:32.450]  borders up to bring all these people in and brainwash them against us because I'm white.
[00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:36.990]  I'm not a person that's in identity politics, but you've made it that way.
[00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:38.950]  Everywhere it's bad because I'm white.
[00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:41.069]  Everywhere it's bad because I'm Christian.
[00:49:41.069 --> 00:49:44.109]  Everywhere I don't deserve to have a job because of what color I am.
[00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:45.670]  Everywhere I'm a bad person.
[00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:46.670]  No!
[00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:53.509]  So I'm not going to join the left's racial jihad and their whole system of racial control,
[00:49:53.509 --> 00:49:58.230]  but I'm going to call your race garbage out.
[00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:03.710]  The ADL is the biggest race-baiting organization on earth and it's painting a target on Jews
[00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:04.350]  everywhere.
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:14.660]  And so is the Democratic Party. So I don't want to hear it. That's what Trump said
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:19.620]  in his speech. They claimed, oh it was pro-Hezbollah. No he wasn't. He's like, you
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:22.980]  got a bunch of soft people that don't know what's going on, that are giving
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:26.900]  weapons and money to Iran, and they got really good fighters in Iran that are
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:31.180]  smart, and this is a serious situation. We better take it serious. They go, oh
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:35.100]  look, he's anti-Israel for saying they're really dangerous. I think he just
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:42.620]  found out how dangerous they are. Trump is assessing the reality of what's
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:49.780]  going on. So when I see this type of behavior, I want to throw up. All right,
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:53.540]  look, I got more on this. I got more clips. I got Ukraine war news. I got a
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:51:03.060]  communist. Yigert is starting the bestiality National Party. I'm not
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:07.900]  joking. He says his first act, this is not a joke, when he is president is to
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:13.540]  legalize, quote, pleasuring animals. By the way, when I say Bill Gates wants to
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:17.780]  block out the sun and cut down trees, I have video clips. Folks, I'm not joking.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:23.340]  The young Turk leader says that his national platform is having sex with
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:29.740]  animals, and that his first act as president will be pleasuring donkeys and
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:40.540]  other creatures. We're gonna play that clip coming up next hour. So it's
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:47.660]  weird. I mean, it's weird, but we're gonna be getting to all of that coming
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:52.380]  up next hour. Also, you might have seen hundreds of news articles the last
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:58.460]  three days. Alex Jones subpoenaed in the Donald Trump trials in Georgia, and
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:05.860]  they say, because I know whatever her name is, I forget her name. I don't
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.620]  know the head of the RNC, never met her, never talked to her. I don't know
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:15.100]  Chess Cheeseboro. I can make jokes all day about I don't know cheddar cheese.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:20.340]  I don't know Velveeta cheese. I don't know Pepper Jack cheese. I don't know
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:27.060]  Swiss cheese. But they're like, the courts, he knows about Cheeseboro and
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:30.100]  everything that happens. I guess when I'm out there in the huge crowd of
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:35.860]  people walking to the Capitol, I guess Cheeseboro, some Trump. Like, we've got
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:41.180]  him. We've got him. And if Jones bucks a subpoena, it's because he's guilty. No,
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:44.220]  it's because I don't want to hire lawyers and go and sit there in a trial and then
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:49.260]  get up on the stand and say, I don't know, what's her name? RNC chair. What's
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:54.340]  her name? It doesn't say in the headline. Ronna McDaniel. I don't know Ronna
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:53:01.780]  McDaniel. I don't know Cheeseboro. I know Cheeseburger. I know lobster roll. But I
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:07.500]  do not know these people. It's just this ongoing, insane, witch hunt everywhere.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:14.460]  I mean, it's just, it's total cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. So the young Turk leader,
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:21.020]  while declaring president and the bestiality platform, I'm not joking. He says,
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:28.420]  I'm the leader. Sex with animals. Now he's running for the leader. He's like,
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:36.020]  Jones won't testify because he's guilty. No, they'll have me testify and then say
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:40.340]  what I said is a lie with no evidence and charge me for perjury. So because
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:48.060]  these courts are kangaroo, all railroads being railroaded, I won't take part in
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:53.620]  your fraud. That's what the fifth amendment is about. I don't know
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:59.100]  Cheeseboro. I don't know Ronna McDaniel. I don't know Sidney Powell. I don't know
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:04.260]  them. I don't know them. I don't call them. I don't have text messages. I never
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:08.700]  talked to them. I never talked to them. I never talked to them. I told you I
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:13.300]  thought Sidney Powell was wrong about the Kraken and all the voting machine
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:16.860]  stuff. It was the mail-in ballots they stole the election. And now they want to
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:25.940]  say Jones is integral to the conspiracy of Trump and Cheeseboro. Cheeseboro.
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:32.420]  The real conspiracy is St. Ugar literally says he wants to be dictator and pleasure
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:37.220]  animals. He wants to legalize pleasuring animals. Like that doesn't sound real.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:41.900]  Will two men can have a baby? Does that sound real? Does any of this sound real?
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:47.860]  Does Black Lives Matter cheering Hamas and Hezbollah sound real? No folks, it is
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:55.460]  real. These people are crazy. On TV saying they want to pleasure animals. All right
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:55:00.460]  we're gonna go to break. We got some good news. We have a flash sale going right

[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.860]  gonna leave it at that without you know getting people excited but that's where

[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:35.860]  I'll be working seven days a week right through the month to make up of the days.
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:43.080]  I did not want to be gone. We had a airplane problem on Wednesday so I had

[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:57.220]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:16.220]  The infamous Albert Pike Letter to Mazzini, known as the Illuminati Plan for Three World Wars, was allegedly written by Albert Pike in 1871.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:23.220]  The letter outlines a plan to foment three world wars in an attempt to take over the world.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:31.220]  It is claimed that the letter was on display in the British Museum Library until 1977, but the British Museum denies this claim.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:38.220]  Some suggest that the use of the word Nazism in 1871 proves that the letter is a fraud,
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:43.220]  and others say the same about Zionism, but Zionism existed back then.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:49.220]  Zionism was made official in the late 1800s as a non-religious nationalist movement
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:56.220]  arguing that the Bible was proof that Jews had a lawful claim to the land of Palestine,
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:03.220]  an area that was currently inhabited by a population that has lived there relatively peacefully for centuries.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:12.220]  Around the alleged writing of this Albert Pike Letter, Jews began immigrating to Palestine with the intention of someday creating a state of Israel,
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:19.220]  which did not happen until 1948, after World War II and the creation of the United Nations.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:25.220]  Albert Pike joined the Fraternal Independent Order of Odd Fellows in 1840.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:32.220]  By 1859, he was elected Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rites Southern Jurisdiction
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:36.220]  and remained Sovereign Grand Commander for the rest of his life.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:44.220]  He was definitely aware of Zionism, and if this Illuminati Plan is true, then his use of the word Nazi is plausible.
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:52.220]  Either way, the letter is worth a read, and the closer we get to the end game, the more accurate this letter appears to be.
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:02.220]  The First World War must be brought about in order to overthrow the Tsars in Russia
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:06.220]  and make that country a fortress of atheistic communism.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:12.220]  The divergences caused by agents of the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.220]  will be used to foment this war.
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:21.220]  After the war, communism will be used to destroy other governments and weaken the religions.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:29.220]  The Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the fascists and the political Zionists.
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:33.220]  This war must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:40.220]  and political Zionism is strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:47.220]  During the Second World War, international communism must become strong enough to balance Christendom,
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:55.220]  which would be restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the final social cataclysm.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:02.220]  The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the agents of the Illuminati
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:06.220]  between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islam.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:13.220]  The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam and political Zionism mutually destroy each other.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:18.220]  Meanwhile, the other nations, once more divided on this issue,
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:26.220]  will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economic exhaustion.
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:33.220]  We shall unleash the nihilists and the atheists and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm,
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:39.220]  which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism,
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.220]  origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:51.220]  Then, everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries,
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:55.220]  will exterminate those destroyers of civilization.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:05.220]  And the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction,
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:10.220]  anxious for an ideal but without knowing where to render its adoration,
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:16.220]  will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer,
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.220]  brought finally out in the public view.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:23.220]  This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement,
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:27.220]  which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism,
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:31.220]  both conquered and exterminated at the same time.
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.220]  Whoever wrote this letter had the vision to see where this is all going.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:44.220]  By manipulating our beliefs and emotions, mankind has been herded into these wars like cattle to the slaughter.

[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:23.860]  Those of us that aren't doing that, we get the blame and we get attacked.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:27.860]  So no, those idiot Nazis are probably leftist posing as that.
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:33.860]  They have their right too. Everybody gets to speak.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:38.860]  What does Bill Maher's quote in the back of my book say?
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:41.860]  Alex Jones gets to speak. Everybody gets to speak.
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:46.860]  The Great Awakening is my new book. Start shipping in six days.
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:50.860]  InfoWarshore.com. Signed or unsigned. The sign is a fundraiser. We need the funds.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:54.860]  Know you historically funded the operation. 200 pages longer than the last book.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:58.860]  Incredible. Full of solutions. Now to defeat the globalists.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:03.860]  The Great Awakening. Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:07.860]  Tucker Carlson. Alex Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance.
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:10.860]  But the truth is he's been a far better guide to reality in recent years.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.860]  In other words, a far better journalist than say NBC natives.
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:18.860]  Tucker Carlson. Bill Maher. Alex Jones gets to speak. Everybody gets to speak.
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.860]  Maybe he should teach the ADL a little bit.
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:24.860]  Well, they'd be probably popular if they made him the head of it.
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:27.860]  Alex Jones is one of the most misunderstood people in the world.
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:31.860]  And he's been right about a lot of S-H-T. Joe Rogan.
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:36.860]  Stephen K. Bannon. There's more than 20 years no populist figure
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:40.860]  has been more of a bayonet in the back of the deep state than Alex Jones.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.860]  Mickey Willis, author, director of Plandemic.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.860]  Mainstream media is wrong. The best story of the time.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.860]  Yet they are never held accountable. Alex Jones is right.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.860]  The best story of the time. And he's silenced and persecuted.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:55.860]  Get the book at infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:13:00.860]  Now that said, that's the toll free number to call and order. 888-253-3139.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.860]  Here is the toll free number to join us on air.
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:10.860]  No censorship. No call screening except you've got a clean phone.
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:15.860]  And if you want to tell us where you're calling from,
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.860]  you can say Deep Space 50. I don't care. You can say Pluto.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:20.860]  If you want to tell us, we'll put it on the board.
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.860]  If you want to tell me the topic, that's fine.
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:27.860]  But if you say anonymous, we'll just put you on the air raw,
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.860]  which is the big thing the establishment doesn't like.
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.860]  So you can say whatever you want.
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:38.860]  No cuss words. We're on FCC stations. Have a clean phone line. That's it.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:42.860]  Here is the toll free number. 877-789-2539.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:47.860]  877-789-2539.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:50.860]  877-789-Alex.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.860]  And if you're in the Middle East, if you're in the Gaza Strip,
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:59.860]  if you're in Israel, if you can get through, I'll put you to the head of the line.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:06.860]  877-789-2539
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.860]  is the toll free number.
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:13.860]  To join us, if you can't dial toll free from outside the country, some can.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.860]  Dial in your country code and then put in this number.
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:19.860]  512-646-1776.
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:26.860]  Country code 512-646-1776.
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.860]  And we're going to take your phone calls today.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:35.860]  But I'll tell you, the vile act is not a couple of guys with masks on their heads.
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:40.860]  You look at their shape, how they act, what they're wearing.
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:42.860]  It looks like the same M.O. we've seen here over and over again.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:46.860]  A couple of leftists dressed up like right wingers,
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:48.860]  howling Hitler in front of the Jewish center.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.860]  Maybe they're real. It's my opinion. I'm allowed to say.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:55.860]  I think it looks like B.S. to me.
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:15:01.860]  But what's real is all these leftists and anti-Palestinians running around saying death to Israel.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:05.860]  But the guys in Australia, looks as fake as a $3 bill to me.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:09.860]  So many times it turns out this Jesse Smollett type crap is just that.
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.860]  Fake.
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:14.860]  Absolutely fake.
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:19.860]  But who knows? The point is, they've been accused of a vile act.
[01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:25.610]  And they've been charged.
[01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:28.610]  The vile act is taking their right.
[01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:32.610]  Since when? Remember the ACLU used to go defend Nazis' right to march.
[01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:35.610]  Let them march. Because you take their right, you take our right.
[01:15:35.610 --> 01:15:38.610]  And everybody knows that. That's not too hard to understand.
[01:15:38.610 --> 01:15:42.610]  But they want to take your right to speak. That's why the system's supporting this.
[01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:47.610]  And they're using anti-Semitic attacks as the pretext to take all our rights, and that's disgusting.
[01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:54.610]  I want you to hear everybody, including Jews and Muslims, say they support free speech.
[01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:57.610]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:15:57.610 --> 01:16:02.610]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[01:16:02.610 --> 01:16:07.610]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:11.610]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:15.610]  Well, I know where you are. You're watching and listening to InfoWars.com right now.

[01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:30.610]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists, and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:34.610]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:37.610]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book.
[01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:42.610]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to set it to number one right now.
[01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:46.610]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists, and it funds the InfoWars.

[01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:34.270]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:35.270]  Israel has entered Gaza.
[01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:38.750]  It warns, get out, Hamas Global Day of Jihad.
[01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:40.830]  War could spread to all of the Middle East.
[01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:41.830]  That's the plan.
[01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:46.310]  We told you we're in the season of war.
[01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:52.070]  To A Works, gun owners of America say horrific situation Israel shows why Americans were afforded
[01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:56.790]  the right, well it wasn't given to us, it was just enshrined, to have weapons of war
[01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:57.790]  for self-defense.
[01:20:57.790 --> 01:21:01.830]  That's a big article on InfoWars.com right now, yeah.
[01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:05.110]  Israel Defense Minister says all Israelis to be armed.
[01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:09.310]  What is your deal, whether you're for Israel or not, and I believe Israel should have
[01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:10.310]  a right to exist.
[01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:13.750]  I don't want to kill all the Jews and murder them, doesn't mean I don't like the politics
[01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:18.310]  being projected back at me to take my rights, or Netanyahu saying all Israelis are guinea
[01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:23.190]  pigs now for Pfizer and Moderna, again, Israel's not one monolithic thing.
[01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:27.670]  I'm sick of, do whatever their Prime Minister says, or you're anti-Semitic, no.
[01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:34.310]  It's like saying, do whatever Obama says, you're anti-black, it's an insult.
[01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:41.470]  My issue here is, imagine if I was an Israeli, or you were, living surrounded by all those
[01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:46.510]  enemies, I would live in a house with foot-thick walls and ceiling, and I'd be armed to the
[01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:47.510]  teeth.
[01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:50.990]  Fine, be a settler, you'll go back to your homeland, whatever.
[01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:56.130]  You're there without guns, that's crazy.
[01:21:56.130 --> 01:22:00.030]  But think about how crazy it is that people, all these liberals, all these congressmen
[01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:04.290]  and women getting carjacked, don't have security or guns, they defund the police and they find
[01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:06.250]  out it's nuts.
[01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:09.250]  The police can't protect you, they even show up after the crime.
[01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:10.610]  That's a whole other huge subject.
[01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:16.450]  All right, Carlos, Jeff, Joe, Alkiller, Charlie, Action, Tracy, Ed, Joe.
[01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:19.530]  You know, I say first-time callers a lot, because we have regular callers that are so
[01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:23.270]  good at dialing the phone, they get through.
[01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:27.930]  So I said, any caller, long time, first time, you name it, but then I do that, and it's
[01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:31.130]  like regular callers, who are great callers, get through and take over.
[01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:35.050]  They're really good, that they don't call and say first-time callers, but we'll do first-time
[01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:37.530]  callers in the next round of calls.
[01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:42.210]  So we'll take these 12 calls, and then all the new callers will be first-time.
[01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:46.450]  Particularly head of the line, anybody calling in from the Middle East, all right?
[01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:49.530]  And if you disagree with me, I'd love to hear from you.
[01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:54.450]  I mean, this is millions of listeners right now, and viewers, and we're not, this is
[01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:55.450]  not censored.
[01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:58.410]  I've seen articles, his callers are fake, it's all fake.
[01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:01.450]  Call in yourself, find out it's not.
[01:23:01.450 --> 01:23:03.810]  All I ask is you have a good, clean phone line, all right?
[01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:06.810]  The way I'm going to control your calls is go quick, so no matter how good your call is,
[01:23:06.810 --> 01:23:07.810]  two minutes apiece.
[01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:11.850]  Carlos and Kano, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:12.850]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:19.130]  I blame what's happening in the Middle East, particularly in Israel, with Hamas and the
[01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:24.710]  Israeli people, on the United Nations' failure, for all these many, many years, not addressing
[01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:25.710]  the issue.
[01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:30.990]  I used to be the peacemaker and the government of the world, well, then I blame it on globalists.
[01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:37.870]  Because frankly, the occupation has been realized, has been taking place, at least since 1967,
[01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:42.630]  with official declarations of the United Nations and resolutions of the Security Council, which
[01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:47.710]  Israel has ignored, and which for all of these years have gone on and on.
[01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:52.110]  And I want to tell you, I don't know any Palestinians except one mechanic that I had many years
[01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:54.230]  ago that was Christian Catholic.
[01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:58.390]  So I really, and I have lots of friends who are in Israel, even.
[01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:04.270]  And I want to tell you this, frankly, I blame the United Nations for not addressing the
[01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:06.310]  so-called under the law.
[01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:10.030]  They're supposed to be under the law, everyone's supposed to be under the law, both.
[01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:13.830]  And now, human beings are dying, many human beings and children.
[01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:19.070]  I'm not interested in the politics or two bald men fighting after a comb.
[01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:20.070]  I'm not interested.
[01:24:20.150 --> 01:24:27.670]  I'm interested in life, preserving the freedom to speak as I do in your program, and the
[01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:28.910]  freedom to love.
[01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:29.910]  And that's all.
[01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:33.590]  In particular, I want to address another issue, which deals with globalists.
[01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:38.910]  This idea of the World Economic Forum becoming an agency of the United Nations, such as the
[01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:44.530]  World Health Organization, and whatever other organizations, the Jewish Defamation League,
[01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:47.550]  you know, they don't protect defamation.
[01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:49.230]  They are defaming everybody.
[01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:57.350]  I call them the Jewish Defamation League, the ADL, with Nosferatu green, you know, whatever.
[01:24:57.350 --> 01:25:01.870]  Always accusing, always insulting people as anti-Semitic or not, when they're not.
[01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:06.750]  In particular, I want to say something else about globalists and CO2.
[01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:14.390]  The emphasis on CO2 is wrong, actually, it's scientifically wrong, but because of the carbon
[01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:20.950]  footprint and the carbon effort, I want to tell you that soft drinks are concentrated
[01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:29.590]  CO2 gas, put in, pure CO2 gas, actually, injected into a fluid, in which people then go and
[01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:32.710]  release this CO2 into the atmosphere.
[01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:35.470]  You know, it's a $220 billion industry worldwide.
[01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:36.470]  No, you're right.
[01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:39.390]  They want to be able to ban everything, CO2 is in everything.
[01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:40.950]  Once you ban that, you control everything.
[01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:41.950]  Thank you, Carlos.
[01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:44.110]  All right, let's go to Action in Texas.
[01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:45.110]  You're on the air.
[01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:46.110]  Welcome, Action.
[01:25:46.110 --> 01:25:47.110]  Hey, good.
[01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:49.630]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:25:49.630 --> 01:25:52.390]  I was talking to my son the other day.
[01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:59.070]  We were looking at the comparisons or the parallels to the Israelites of old, in the
[01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:04.670]  Old Testament, where when they were going up to battle with the enemy, there was a particular
[01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:10.430]  situation in Chronicles where Jehoshaphat, he was afraid, and he asked the Lord what
[01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:11.430]  to do.
[01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:19.830]  And as the enemy was approaching and camping the Israelites, the Lord, confounded, confused,
[01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:27.230]  had the enemy fight and go against one another, as they're fighting each other, they're overtaken.
[01:26:27.230 --> 01:26:35.350]  Look at what's happening now with BLM, and the Palestinians, do you see the hypocrisy
[01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:36.350]  in the left?
[01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:37.670]  I don't want to blame them.
[01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:38.670]  No, no, no.
[01:26:38.670 --> 01:26:39.670]  I hate the left.
[01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:45.270]  I don't like a lot of what Israel does, but the left is a far bigger, powerful, globalist
[01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:46.270]  organization.
[01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:50.750]  And then where's the liberal media attacking Black Lives Matter and the universities that
[01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:52.630]  are literally saying, kill the Jews?
[01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:56.310]  I have the ADL saying, I'm evil and I'm bad, but I've done nothing.
[01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:58.070]  And then they sit there and defend these people.
[01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:59.070]  I'm sick of it.
[01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:01.350]  I'm going to say one thing.
[01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:04.550]  I got one scripture, and then I'm going to address the people that put those sorry-ass
[01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:07.030]  comments on your board.
[01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:08.590]  Here's Galatians 5.15.
[01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:12.830]  If you bite and devour each other, watch out, or you will be destroyed by each other.
[01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:13.830]  That's for you, BLM.
[01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:14.830]  That's for you, left.
[01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:19.670]  And for you people that are putting these comments on Infowars, sitting there bashing
[01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:23.430]  Alex Jones, you don't even know him, calling him a racist.
[01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:26.310]  Get off that, and mind your own business.
[01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:27.310]  Have a good day.
[01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:28.310]  Thank you.
[01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:30.390]  I haven't seen the comments, but I'm being bashed as anti-Semitic.
[01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:36.750]  I'm being bashed by the Muslims, and I'm just like, this is idiotic.
[01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:38.390]  This is absolutely idiotic.
[01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:39.750]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:42.590]  No, our government gave $6 billion to Iran.
[01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:46.870]  Our government gave tens of billions of dollars of weapons in Afghanistan to them.
[01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:50.750]  And then when we get attacked by Hezbollah or Hormuz, they'll take my rights away.
[01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:52.750]  That's baloney.
[01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:54.350]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:57.150]  Let's talk to Al Killer in Virginia.
[01:27:57.150 --> 01:27:58.150]  Welcome, sir.
[01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:04.150]  You know, Alex, I want to say, I want to disagree with you slightly.
[01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:06.070]  There's no right for any country to exist.
[01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:07.630]  There's no right for the United States.
[01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:09.590]  There's no right for Russia, Israel, or anybody else.
[01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:11.590]  You sink or swim on your own merit.
[01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:14.030]  Sometimes it's outside forces on that.
[01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:15.710]  No, that's what I said.
[01:28:15.710 --> 01:28:17.430]  I said Russia and Israel have nuclear weapons.
[01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:18.430]  They're not going anywhere.
[01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:23.030]  The fact that they, actually, I'm not disagreeing with you, but you're not getting what I said.
[01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:24.790]  So let me be clear.
[01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:28.950]  When you stand up for yourself and you have a right to exist because you make yourself
[01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:32.910]  exist, you have a right to exist, whether you like it or not.
[01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:33.910]  I agree with that.
[01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:39.590]  You know, I couldn't help but go back to a Henry Kissinger interview about 10, literally
[01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:40.590]  10 years ago.
[01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:41.590]  It's actually 2012.
[01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:42.590]  Hold on.
[01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:43.590]  Don't hang up.
[01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:44.590]  It's funny.
[01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:45.590]  You got Henry Kissinger stuff.
[01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:49.790]  I got a Henry Kissinger clip on open borders that I'm going to play and then another clip
[01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:52.470]  from the British Home Minister on this.
[01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:59.350]  We'll go right back to you, Al Killer, stay with us.
[01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:03.390]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:07.070]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else?
[01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:11.310]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing
[01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:12.310]  them.
[01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:14.470]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:20.110]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative
[01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:23.190]  to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[01:29:23.190 --> 01:29:28.110]  This is the great awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great
[01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:29.310]  renaissance.
[01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:33.110]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:36.030]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:04.990]  Last year we put this book out, The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:30:04.990 --> 01:30:07.430]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:11.190]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:16.510]  The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:18.470]  This is such a powerful book.
[01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:23.490]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives
[01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:27.550]  an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:28.550]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:31.030]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.

[01:31:57.350 --> 01:32:03.310]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:08.510]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:09.510]  us.
[01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:14.990]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:17.990]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:22.070]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in
[01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:27.390]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:30.470]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:35.430]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not
[01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:36.430]  support us.
[01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:39.910]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:44.790]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great
[01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:48.670]  products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:53.030]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:57.190]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[01:32:57.190 --> 01:32:58.190]  will be over.
[01:32:58.190 --> 01:33:00.310]  Please take action now.
[01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:06.550]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:28.060]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:53.060]  There's a new video, it's only 28 seconds long, from September 7th, a little more than a month ago, where I predicted attacks on Jews to bring in the new world order of tyranny.
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:34:00.060]  That clip's now going viral. We'll play that here in a few minutes. But let me get to these clips and then back to your calls since Al Killer raised this.
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:05.060]  These are two big articles up on InfoWars.com. From yesterday, 100-year-old Kissinger...
[01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:15.110]  Great mistake to let in so many people of different cultures, religions and concepts.
[01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:22.110]  He says it divides and destroys society. Well, that's replacement migration, which the left uses to control society.
[01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:27.110]  And then we have multiculturalism has failed and threatens to bring down British democracy,
[01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:34.110]  British Home Secretary Suella Braverman says. We got a bunch of clips of her, but they knew it would do this.
[01:34:34.110 --> 01:34:41.110]  It's like the New York mayor and even O'Biden, Biden, the rest of them are like, oh, we don't want open borders.
[01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:44.110]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Chicago, don't come here.
[01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:52.110]  But they collapse the third world, totally abuse them with the lockdowns, then organize and bring them here and say, oh, no, we didn't do this.
[01:34:52.110 --> 01:34:57.110]  We didn't want this. So here's Henry Kissinger.
[01:34:57.110 --> 01:35:01.110]  Then we'll go to the British Home Secretary saying multiculturalism has failed.
[01:35:01.110 --> 01:35:04.110]  It was designed to make us all fail. Here it is.
[01:35:04.110 --> 01:35:21.110]  It was a grave mistake to let in so many people of totally different culture and religious and concepts,
[01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:29.110]  because it creates a pressure group inside each country that does that.
[01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:36.110]  Yesterday's laws are simply not fit for purpose.
[01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:43.110]  So to anyone proposing de facto open borders through unlimited safe and legal routes as the alternative.
[01:35:43.110 --> 01:35:52.110]  Let's be honest. There are 100 million people around the world who could qualify for protection under our current laws.
[01:35:52.110 --> 01:35:56.110]  Let's be clear. They are coming here.
[01:35:56.110 --> 01:36:06.110]  We've seen a 500. We've seen a 500 percent increase in small boats crossings in two years.
[01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:10.110]  And this, Mr. Speaker, is the crucial point of this bill.
[01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:23.110]  They will not stop coming here until the world knows that if you enter Britain illegally, you will be detained and swiftly removed.
[01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:33.110]  Removed back to your country, if it's safe or to a safe country, a safe third country like Rwanda.
[01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:36.110]  And that is precisely what this bill will do.
[01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:47.110]  Now, I'm here in America to talk about a critical and shared global challenge, uncontrolled and illegal migration.
[01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:55.110]  It's an existential challenge for the political and cultural institutions of the West.
[01:36:55.110 --> 01:37:02.110]  Basic rule of history that nations which cannot defend their borders will not long survive.
[01:37:02.110 --> 01:37:15.110]  It is a basic rule of politics that political systems which cannot control their borders will not maintain the consent of the people and thus not long endure.
[01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:21.110]  You do not have to be a clairvoyant to see how might this all unfold.
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:27.340]  But they've been running the whole thing the whole time.
[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:30.340]  We're going to go back to OwlKiller here in a moment.
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:32.340]  But here's just a short 28-second clip.
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:35.340]  I'll show you the Twitter account. It's noncompliant.
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:38.340]  That fluoridated mine.
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:44.340]  And we should actually find the full clip from September last month,
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:47.340]  a little over a month ago, I guess 34 days ago,
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:52.340]  where I laid it all out and predicted attacks on Jews.
[01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:54.340]  Here it is.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:56.340]  Those are Nazis about to kill Jews.
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:00.340]  You must silence everyone that opposes our agenda of surveillance and censorship
[01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:01.340]  or you're going to kill Jews.
[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:03.340]  Now what's the next move?
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:06.340]  The false flag.
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:10.340]  If I was Jewish, I would not have my kids in any big synagogue or any big school.
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.340]  You're about to get hit.
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:13.340]  It's your whole future.
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:16.340]  It's the whole future of the species and our children and their children.
[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:22.340]  We're being turned into factory farm slaves.
[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:26.340]  The very rights over our bodies is being assaulted like never before.
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:30.340]  Now as I continue to do this, the media says,
[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:34.340]  Jones throws a lot on the wall and sees what'll stick.
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:39.340]  Oh, like when I said Russia will invade by the end of February last year and they did?
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:42.340]  No.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.340]  I want to have the archive as we have the date.
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:47.340]  I want to see the full clip.
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:48.340]  I'll play it on the Saturday show.
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:50.340]  I'm going to go live at noon tomorrow.
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:53.340]  We'll have like five, ten minutes, whatever the full context was.
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:55.340]  Maybe two minutes, maybe ten minutes, maybe an hour.
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:56.340]  I don't know.
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:57.340]  Probably ten minutes long.
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:00.340]  Usually each segment is a topic.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:01.340]  Now how did I know that?
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:04.340]  Because I see the pre-programming.
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:06.340]  Bin Laden's going to attack you.
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:08.340]  When he attacks you, we've got to take your rights.
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:09.340]  America will no longer be free.
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:11.340]  Well, where did the Feds attack first?
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:13.340]  They tried to blow up the World Trade Center in 1992.
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:14.340]  That came out.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.340]  New York Times, everywhere.
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:18.340]  I interviewed Ahmad Salam who blew the whistle.
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:20.340]  Egyptian intelligence, CIA.
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:22.340]  I mean thousands of other data points.
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:24.340]  It doesn't mean radical Islam isn't real.
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:25.340]  It's totally real.
[01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:26.340]  The point is they let them do this.
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:28.340]  Just like Israel just allowed this attack.
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:58.340]  99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:00.340]  Now, I'm not stupid.
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:02.340]  And they don't want us here questioning that.
[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:04.340]  It doesn't mean we support the Islamists.
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:06.340]  It doesn't mean we support the attack.
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:08.340]  We don't.
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:10.340]  But they let it happen.
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:14.340]  And I mean I could just see it all heating up.
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:18.340]  And I see false flags against black people to be blamed on Trump supporters.
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:20.340]  I see power outages.
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:22.340]  I've gone through this ad nauseum.
[01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:24.340]  I'm gonna go back to your calls.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:26.340]  But play that clip.
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:28.340]  Do it back up.
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:30.340]  For some reason you can't download it off Twitter.
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:32.340]  So I'm gonna play it off the computer.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:34.340]  Listen to what I...
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:36.340]  I remember that show now, a month ago,
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:38.340]  where I walked into why they did it
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:40.340]  and how I could tell.
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:42.340]  Because it's like, how do you know a new car is coming out?
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:44.340]  You see ads everywhere.
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:46.340]  How do you know that a rock concert is coming to your town
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:48.340]  or a country concert or hip-hop?
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.340]  You see the ads.
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:52.340]  And it's like...
[01:40:51.190 --> 01:40:56.429]  We got to censor you. There's imminent attacks on Jews. And I'm like, but it's
[01:40:56.429 --> 01:41:00.830]  Trump supporters being censored. We're not anti-Jew. I mean, I don't look down on
[01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:04.950]  Trump that his daughter's married to a Jew and has kids, is pro-Israel. Great
[01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:09.809]  for Trump. He brought peace to Abraham Accords. That's great. What does he get
[01:41:09.809 --> 01:41:14.710]  for it? He's an anti-Semite. It's a lie. And Trump is strong. He can handle being
[01:41:14.710 --> 01:41:20.150]  lied about. I'm not as strong as Trump. I have been a friend to Israel. I have been
[01:41:20.150 --> 01:41:25.629]  nice. And I've had so many Jewish people come up to me in the grocery store,
[01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:31.070]  airports. Oh Alex, we love you. A lot of them are Hasidic Jews, you know, in their
[01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:38.190]  conservative attire. And I just, I'm like, listen, what have you done for me?
[01:41:38.190 --> 01:41:42.950]  It's like the Bill Maher joke saying Jews complain all day. Well, I complain way
[01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:46.469]  more than any Jew I know. I'm like, hey, great. You want to shake my hand, take a
[01:41:46.469 --> 01:41:49.849]  picture. What are you doing for me? Because I'm not against you and I'm
[01:41:49.849 --> 01:41:54.330]  getting attacked. Well, that's politics, Alex. We like you. Okay, great. I'm under
[01:41:54.330 --> 01:41:59.849]  attack, man. So why don't you, you know, okay, well, yeah, exactly. Like I didn't do
[01:41:59.849 --> 01:42:05.889]  anything to you and I'm not your enemy. So you need to tell the ADL stop trying
[01:42:05.889 --> 01:42:11.650]  to destroy me and Elon Musk. Like, well, hey, we're better than the Muslims. Well,
[01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:20.009]  yeah, exactly. I'm talking to you. Like, I can't sit here and take this. We can't
[01:42:20.009 --> 01:42:23.490]  take the news saying white people are terrorists and Christians are bad
[01:42:23.490 --> 01:42:27.490]  people. And you're like, well, we're not doing that. The point is, if you speak out
[01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:32.210]  against it, people will listen. My grandfather stood up for the Jews on
[01:42:32.210 --> 01:42:35.169]  both of them almost out of the Army Air Corps. And I don't claim you owe me some
[01:42:35.169 --> 01:42:40.210]  debt, but at the same time, I don't owe you anything. And I am tired of being
[01:42:40.290 --> 01:42:44.450]  attacked. And the white supremacists make a joke. Oh, Jones pleads to his masters.
[01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:51.070]  Screw you. Half those white supremacist groups are funded by the Feds. I'm not
[01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:55.629]  even having a debate with them. I'm having a real debate with people that say
[01:42:55.629 --> 01:43:00.889]  they're smart. Do I deserve this? Why do conservatives who've done
[01:43:00.889 --> 01:43:05.089]  nothing to Israel deserve to be persecuted and attacked like Hitler did
[01:43:05.089 --> 01:43:07.969]  in the beginning? I'm not comparing what's happening to conservatives to
[01:43:07.969 --> 01:43:13.929]  what Hitler did. But if you follow up 1933 to 1943, when he really, the last
[01:43:13.929 --> 01:43:18.169]  two years, starts murdering everybody, they're following, deplatforming,
[01:43:18.169 --> 01:43:22.169]  putting us in ghettos, lying about us, demonizing us. You know, I mean, no, we're
[01:43:22.169 --> 01:43:27.490]  actually on the same track here. And so I'm like saying, hey!
[01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:34.429]  You need to get behind Trump in America, and a lot of Jews will say we are.
[01:43:34.429 --> 01:43:36.070]  Okay, great.
[01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:38.190]  I'm talking to you because I think you'll listen to me.
[01:43:38.190 --> 01:43:42.110]  I'm not talking to the Muslims, I can't convince them of anything.
[01:43:42.110 --> 01:43:48.190]  I'm talking to you because I think you can listen to what I'm telling you, okay?
[01:43:48.190 --> 01:43:53.830]  To let the ADL harass Trump and harass me and lie about us is dangerous, because I'm
[01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:56.309]  smart enough to get the Hegelian dialectic.
[01:43:56.309 --> 01:43:58.510]  The general public's not, I'm going to be completely honest with you.
[01:43:58.510 --> 01:43:59.950]  I think you know that.
[01:43:59.950 --> 01:44:03.309]  So you say you're smart, I think you're smart.
[01:44:03.309 --> 01:44:08.790]  Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.
[01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:09.790]  This is a setup.
[01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:14.510]  Play the clip again.
[01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:16.510]  Those are Nazis about to kill Jews.
[01:44:16.510 --> 01:44:20.550]  You must silence everyone that opposes our agenda of surveillance and censorship or you're
[01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:21.550]  going to kill Jews.
[01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:23.150]  Now, what's the next move?
[01:44:23.150 --> 01:44:26.150]  The false flag.
[01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:30.269]  If I was Jewish, I would not have my kids in any big synagogue or any big school.
[01:44:30.269 --> 01:44:31.269]  You're about to get hit.
[01:44:31.269 --> 01:44:32.269]  It's your whole future.
[01:44:32.269 --> 01:44:36.950]  It's the whole future of the species and our children and their children.
[01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:40.150]  We're being turned into factory farm slaves.
[01:44:40.150 --> 01:44:47.269]  The very rights over our bodies is being assaulted like never before.
[01:44:47.269 --> 01:44:48.269]  And that's the bottom line.
[01:44:48.269 --> 01:44:52.750]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:57.030]  If we don't figure out a way to save the Christians and the Jews and the Muslims and
[01:44:57.030 --> 01:45:01.230]  the Hindus and the Buddhists, everybody else, if we don't find a way to work together and
[01:45:01.230 --> 01:45:05.309]  get past all this, we're going to kill each other.
[01:45:05.309 --> 01:45:12.190]  And I have no desire to see Muslims destroyed and put in graves or Jews, everybody else.
[01:45:12.190 --> 01:45:19.630]  But you are literally attacking Christians, the FBI, all of it, literally.
[01:45:19.630 --> 01:45:21.590]  Look, we're in 1935, Germany.
[01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:22.830]  And let me tell you what happened.
[01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:25.830]  The average conservative has been a really good person.
[01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:27.910]  The average Christian is a really good person.
[01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:31.670]  And a lot of them are smart, but not that sophisticated.
[01:45:31.670 --> 01:45:34.590]  And they're like, well, I never did anything in my life to these people.
[01:45:34.590 --> 01:45:35.590]  Why are they attacking me?
[01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:39.030]  And you're making enemies.
[01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:41.830]  So I suggest this stops right now.
[01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:45.670]  All I want is prosperity and justice and freedom for everybody.
[01:45:45.670 --> 01:45:46.670]  And to have your culture.
[01:45:47.190 --> 01:45:50.870]  Respect all your cultures.
[01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:53.950]  Islam is blasting, taking over.
[01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:55.150]  You have like six kids.
[01:45:55.150 --> 01:45:57.429]  I respect you, but you don't respect me.
[01:45:57.429 --> 01:45:59.230]  You talk about how I will submit to you.
[01:45:59.230 --> 01:46:02.550]  No, I'm not going to.
[01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:08.910]  And that goes for the leftist Jews that they're going to create some Kumbaya thing where we
[01:46:08.910 --> 01:46:15.070]  all have one culture and somehow you run it or some leftist group, some black rock.
[01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:17.429]  Man, that's not going to work.
[01:46:17.429 --> 01:46:18.429]  We're diverse.
[01:46:18.429 --> 01:46:19.429]  We're separate.
[01:46:19.429 --> 01:46:20.630]  We're different groups.
[01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:24.349]  Leave us alone.
[01:46:24.349 --> 01:46:32.670]  Israel's made dozens of runs at the Orthodox Jews.
[01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:35.830]  And takes their kids and everything else.
[01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:38.349]  Leave the Orthodox Jews alone.
[01:46:38.349 --> 01:46:40.030]  Leave the Christians alone.
[01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:41.030]  Leave the Catholics alone.
[01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:42.030]  Leave us alone.
[01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:43.030]  Leave us alone.
[01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:44.030]  Leave us alone.
[01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:45.150]  Leave us alone.
[01:46:45.150 --> 01:46:46.150]  Leave us alone.
[01:46:46.150 --> 01:46:47.150]  Leave us alone.
[01:46:47.150 --> 01:46:51.870]  And then you can have your life and we'll have ours.
[01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:54.150]  Just leave our children alone.
[01:46:54.150 --> 01:46:56.349]  Leave their penises alone.
[01:46:56.349 --> 01:46:58.470]  Leave their vaginas alone.
[01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:59.990]  Leave their uteruses alone.
[01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:06.910]  I mean, literally, the globalists literally want our children's future.
[01:47:06.910 --> 01:47:12.309]  And does anybody think in this fight, anybody's safe?
[01:47:12.309 --> 01:47:16.389]  When I see a bunch of Palestinians killed, I don't go, yeah, we're doing good.
[01:47:16.389 --> 01:47:20.190]  Or I see a bunch of Jews killed, I don't go, whoo, yeah, that's really good.
[01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:23.349]  No, it's BS.
[01:47:23.349 --> 01:47:26.510]  And it needs to stop now.
[01:47:28.450 --> 01:47:39.809]  But you can't punch somebody in the face and expect them not to punch back.
[01:47:39.809 --> 01:47:47.450]  So the powerful globalist forces are looking to start a civil war, and they're starting
[01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:48.450]  it right now.
[01:47:48.450 --> 01:47:53.410]  What did I say over and over again last year?
[01:47:53.410 --> 01:47:56.450]  They're going to do the Ukraine, they're going to do the Middle East, and China's going to
[01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:58.410]  do the ones I want.
[01:47:58.410 --> 01:48:03.210]  See things counting down here?
[01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:14.450]  We're going into a full world war, and the powerful globalist forces in control of this,
[01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:22.450]  think we're all a bunch of dumb animals, they're going to get away with this, but they're not.
[01:48:22.450 --> 01:48:26.849]  And we're strapped to this runaway train together.
[01:48:26.849 --> 01:48:31.170]  That's why I respect everybody, that's why I tell you straight what I think, because
[01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:36.429]  I respect you, and I want you to know what I'm saying, I want you to hear me talk straight
[01:48:36.429 --> 01:48:37.429]  to you.
[01:48:37.429 --> 01:48:41.090]  Straight, like, hey, I'm talking straight to you.
[01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:45.450]  Here's how I've been abused, here's what's been done to me, I'm complaining, I'm tired
[01:48:45.450 --> 01:48:50.330]  of this, I don't appreciate this, I don't deserve this.
[01:48:50.330 --> 01:49:00.970]  And your problem is, not everybody is as smart as I am, and the level of anger by Christians
[01:49:00.970 --> 01:49:09.290]  and by white people of being abused by this media, this government, is outrageous.
[01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:14.170]  And you know, the ADL, the Democratic Party, they think they got this all figured out,
[01:49:14.170 --> 01:49:16.090]  you don't have anything figured out.
[01:49:16.090 --> 01:49:19.889]  You're the dumbest people I've ever seen in my life, because I've learned no matter how
[01:49:19.889 --> 01:49:23.970]  badass you are, there's always somebody who can kick your ass.
[01:49:23.970 --> 01:49:29.530]  And you guys are conjuring up a monster that you can't even deal with.
[01:49:29.530 --> 01:49:32.610]  You can't even comprehend what you're doing.
[01:49:32.610 --> 01:49:41.769]  And you sit there, and you think you're winning, and you're not, you're losers.
[01:49:41.769 --> 01:49:44.889]  The illusions of grandeur have to end.
[01:49:44.889 --> 01:49:50.530]  The power trips have to end, we got to get serious, or we're going to all kill each other.
[01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:53.170]  And that's where I stand.
[01:49:53.170 --> 01:50:01.450]  Promoting Americana, and competition, and freedom, and right of choice, and diversity.
[01:50:01.450 --> 01:50:03.050]  But this is not diversity.
[01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:10.050]  They tell us diversity is unification under one idea, under whatever these corporations
[01:50:10.050 --> 01:50:11.050]  cook up.
[01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:12.769]  And I'm not going to go on with that.
[01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:16.490]  All right, I've had callers hold for 15 minutes.
[01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:19.650]  I'm going to take calls all the way through the next hour.
[01:50:19.650 --> 01:50:24.210]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539.
[01:50:24.210 --> 01:50:29.210]  Nobody's gotten through yet from Israel or the Gaza Strip.
[01:50:29.210 --> 01:50:32.410]  But I'm going to now give each person about a minute or two, because I got to get going.
[01:50:32.410 --> 01:50:33.570]  I apologize.
[01:50:33.570 --> 01:50:35.769]  I've been pontificating, and I'm going to stop right now.
[01:50:35.769 --> 01:50:37.970]  Al Killer, you got caught off by the break.
[01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:38.849]  You brought up Henry Kissinger.
[01:50:38.849 --> 01:50:39.370]  I played the clip.
[01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:40.769]  Go ahead.
[01:50:40.769 --> 01:50:47.290]  All right, so September 30, 2012, he gives an interview, I believe it was with Cindy
[01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:51.330]  Adams of the New York Post, and he says, in 10 years, Israel will not exist anymore.
[01:50:51.330 --> 01:50:56.889]  I find that really coincidental that we're 11 years, and then we have this going on.
[01:50:56.889 --> 01:50:58.849]  So Israel has a demographic issue.
[01:50:58.849 --> 01:51:01.809]  There's only 6.8 million of them that live in Israel.
[01:51:01.809 --> 01:51:06.330]  And as you said, Muslims have, on average, about six kids in the Middle East.
[01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:10.370]  So they're running into a demographic issue where they're going to be, regardless of
[01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:15.010]  nuclear weapons, they're going to be outnumbered.
[01:51:15.010 --> 01:51:21.450]  You know, I also find it funny that the ADL was, wasn't Benjamin Netanyahu over here
[01:51:21.450 --> 01:51:26.490]  meeting with Elon Musk, and you know, you were hearing all this ADL comments on, about
[01:51:26.490 --> 01:51:31.330]  anti-Semitism rising on Twitter, or X, as it's called now.
[01:51:31.330 --> 01:51:36.769]  And you know, you bring up Benjamin Netanyahu, he can't form a government at all.
[01:51:36.769 --> 01:51:39.889]  They've had five elections, I believe, in what, four years?
[01:51:39.889 --> 01:51:45.330]  And they don't value their, the leadership over there don't value their people.
[01:51:45.330 --> 01:51:51.370]  How could you be, how could you openly say that your people are going to be experiment?
[01:51:51.370 --> 01:51:58.570]  So I think that the globalists, they really, Israel is just a political football for them,
[01:51:58.570 --> 01:52:02.690]  and the same thing with Hamas, it's a political football for them to kick back and forth because
[01:52:02.690 --> 01:52:04.090]  it gives them leverage.
[01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:09.170]  So they really don't care what happens to Israel or to the Palestinians, it's about
[01:52:09.170 --> 01:52:10.930]  the power grab that they're going to get.
[01:52:10.930 --> 01:52:16.490]  And I believe it was Zelensky that said that Ukraine was going to become the big brother
[01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:17.490]  Israel.
[01:52:17.490 --> 01:52:24.250]  So there's so many, there's so many moving pieces that we have no, that we don't even
[01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:27.010]  know specifically what's going on.
[01:52:27.010 --> 01:52:33.370]  It just, anything that happened, there's nothing that can happen in that country, in Israel,
[01:52:33.650 --> 01:52:36.889]  that somebody in the IDF or somebody in the Mossad is not going to know about.
[01:52:36.889 --> 01:52:38.889]  No, I really do, and I appreciate your call.
[01:52:38.889 --> 01:52:40.889]  All right, let's go to Joe in California.
[01:52:40.889 --> 01:52:42.889]  Joe, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:49.130]  Hey, Alex, the survival sealed X2, everybody's got to get some of that, especially as old
[01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:50.130]  guys like me.
[01:52:50.130 --> 01:52:52.090]  Just, I wanted to plug because you haven't been.
[01:52:52.090 --> 01:52:58.889]  Europe, I took my family for the first time to Europe about five or six years ago, and
[01:52:58.889 --> 01:53:05.290]  the Eiffel Tower, you couldn't even get through all the Syrian refugees selling their Chotskys.
[01:53:05.290 --> 01:53:07.090]  So Kissinger was right.
[01:53:07.090 --> 01:53:11.650]  I think they always tell you what they're going to do or what their plan is.
[01:53:11.650 --> 01:53:17.530]  And I think Kissinger is a new world order icon.
[01:53:17.530 --> 01:53:21.889]  My question for your staff is, though, you guys are great at finding videos.
[01:53:21.889 --> 01:53:25.250]  And my point is, they always tell you what they're going to do.
[01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:31.570]  Biden, in his little sniffy voice, when he goes up to the mic and whispers, a few years
[01:53:31.570 --> 01:53:36.889]  ago, somebody asked him a question and he said, he came to the mic and he said, oh,
[01:53:36.889 --> 01:53:39.570]  you think we're Satanist?
[01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:42.570]  We're drinking baby's blood.
[01:53:42.570 --> 01:53:43.570]  He said that on the microphone.
[01:53:43.570 --> 01:53:48.650]  I remember, guys, search engine, Biden, baby blood, I remember that.
[01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:50.930]  Find that, please, Alex, one more thing.
[01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:51.930]  And let me just say this.
[01:53:51.930 --> 01:53:52.969]  I want to thank you.
[01:53:52.969 --> 01:53:55.769]  You brought me back to God and you helped me stop drinking.
[01:53:55.769 --> 01:53:57.690]  And I haven't drunk an alcohol in two years.
[01:53:57.690 --> 01:54:01.610]  I know you, last time I said that, you went to you and said, oh, don't drink that much.
[01:54:01.610 --> 01:54:03.410]  But you helped me personally.
[01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:04.930]  And I wanted to thank you very much.
[01:54:04.930 --> 01:54:05.930]  God bless you, sir.
[01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:06.930]  Well, God bless you.
[01:54:06.930 --> 01:54:07.930]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:54:07.930 --> 01:54:11.170]  Yeah, I remember Biden talking about baby's blood.
[01:54:11.170 --> 01:54:13.090]  Biden says he doesn't drink baby's blood.
[01:54:13.090 --> 01:54:14.090]  We'll look that up.
[01:54:14.090 --> 01:54:16.010]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:54:16.010 --> 01:54:17.769]  Charlie in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:54:17.769 --> 01:54:18.769]  Go ahead.
[01:54:18.769 --> 01:54:19.769]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:19.769 --> 01:54:21.690]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[01:54:21.690 --> 01:54:24.610]  So I just wanted to agree.
[01:54:24.610 --> 01:54:25.610]  Yeah.
[01:54:25.610 --> 01:54:28.530]  I listened to you about a half an hour, an hour and a half ago.
[01:54:28.530 --> 01:54:31.889]  And you were talking about how just leave me alone.
[01:54:31.889 --> 01:54:37.610]  And I absolutely agree why Owen Troyer was also saying, like, this is like a thousand
[01:54:37.610 --> 01:54:38.969]  year thing that's going on.
[01:54:38.969 --> 01:54:42.050]  And like, why does everybody have to be shoehorned into this?
[01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:43.050]  Right.
[01:54:43.050 --> 01:54:44.210]  So I couldn't agree more.
[01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:47.330]  But I just wanted to give you a bit of a nuance from the Canadian perspective.
[01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:51.210]  And like, from all the media that we've been seeing up here, I've just noticed the concerted
[01:54:51.250 --> 01:54:59.290]  effort with all of the conservative pundits like Ben Shapiro, all of the Daily Wire people,
[01:54:59.290 --> 01:55:00.610]  even like Jordan Peterson.
[01:55:00.610 --> 01:55:05.210]  Jordan Peterson just tweeted, give him hell, you know, and like it seems like over the
[01:55:05.210 --> 01:55:10.490]  last couple of years, they've really tried to like they've gained a lot of conservative
[01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:16.130]  type right wing type new conservatives on the conservative side.
[01:55:16.130 --> 01:55:22.570]  And it seems like the right wing has really, you know, gotten the gotten the support from
[01:55:22.570 --> 01:55:24.769]  like the convoy crowd and all of that.
[01:55:24.769 --> 01:55:30.210]  And then all of a sudden, now that this attack has happened in lockstep, every single conservative
[01:55:30.210 --> 01:55:34.690]  pundit or most of them on the right wing is pushing for World War Three and trying to
[01:55:34.690 --> 01:55:36.410]  shoehorn us into this.
[01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:39.450]  And it's just yeah, it's just really upsetting.
[01:55:39.450 --> 01:55:40.889]  Like just leave me alone.
[01:55:40.889 --> 01:55:42.530]  They're pushing for an attack on Iran.
[01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:46.530]  And I don't think that Iran wasn't involved, but why did our governments give them all
[01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:47.530]  the money?
[01:55:47.530 --> 01:55:48.530]  Yeah.
[01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:49.530]  I see it everywhere.
[01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:53.849]  I mean, I see like we got to attack Iran.
[01:55:53.849 --> 01:55:54.849]  We got to go to war.
[01:55:54.849 --> 01:55:59.130]  We need to bomb Gaza Strip.
[01:55:59.130 --> 01:56:02.130]  So we just segued from Ukraine right into this.
[01:56:02.130 --> 01:56:03.530]  And the next is China.
[01:56:03.530 --> 01:56:07.410]  Yeah, this is about the Belt and Road Initiative, right?
[01:56:07.410 --> 01:56:13.370]  Like this is all about the new supply chains, the new petrodollar being with the goldback
[01:56:13.370 --> 01:56:15.690]  BRICS currencies and all of that stuff.
[01:56:15.690 --> 01:56:20.290]  So I mean, this is all about change.
[01:56:20.290 --> 01:56:26.170]  And they're the Hegelian like they're really shoehorning us into this, right?
[01:56:26.170 --> 01:56:31.610]  And it's it's scary to see like family members and all sorts of people, you know, they're
[01:56:31.610 --> 01:56:33.769]  they're just frothing at the mouth for war.
[01:56:33.769 --> 01:56:34.769]  Ready to go.
[01:56:34.769 --> 01:56:35.769]  It's dangerous and it's insane.
[01:56:35.769 --> 01:56:38.610]  But no discussion of why did our governments arm them?
[01:56:38.610 --> 01:56:40.650]  Speaking of money, we're not funded by the globals.
[01:56:40.650 --> 01:56:41.889]  We're funded by you.
[01:56:41.889 --> 01:56:47.450]  We have a flash emergency sale that is only running for a couple more days.

[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:51.920]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:55.920]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:00.920]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.920]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:07.920]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world,
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:11.920]  an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.

[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:17.920]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:19.920]  It's a companion to my last book.
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:21.920]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:24.920]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:55.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:04.920]  You know, we get on air and callers call in and remind me of things that I remember.
[02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:06.920]  They're so crazy, I think, wait.
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:09.920]  Did Biden really say they claim we're drinking baby blood?
[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:10.920]  Wait, he did say that.
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.920]  And it sounds crazy to say they said that.
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.920]  Like, Bill Gates is going to block out the sun.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:19.920]  We're going to bury trees, cut trees down.
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:21.920]  He said two weeks ago, we need to cut trees down.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:23.920]  He said, trees are bad.
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:26.920]  Environmentalists need to stop thinking trees are good.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:31.920]  So I told the crew during the last segment, a lot of you were watching that,
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:33.920]  I said, go find that.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:34.920]  And they found it.
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:35.920]  Here he is.
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:45.920]  Can you clarify what you said about no, that there's no,
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:48.920]  no one in the Democratic Party is anti-police?
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:51.920]  I know that you have said you don't want to defund the police.
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:54.920]  That is not the Democratic Party's position.
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:56.920]  I'm the Democratic Party.
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:57.920]  I am president.
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:59.920]  So is the Speaker of the House.
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.920]  And so is the majority leader.
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:06.920]  We are not defunding the police.
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:09.920]  And are there people who, in the Democratic Party,
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:11.920]  who want to defund the president?
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:14.920]  Are there people in the Republican Party who think we're sucking the blood out of kids?
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:16.920]  I'm not sure.
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:19.920]  Are there people in the Democratic Party who want to defund the president?
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:22.920]  Mr. President, are you worried that you won't get vote here?
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:25.920]  Mr. President, can you clarify what you said?
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:30.920]  All right, so he says he's not defunding the police,
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:32.920]  but they've done it all over the country.
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:33.920]  Again, total lies.
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:38.920]  Here's a short clip of Tom Fenton of Judicial Watch
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:44.920]  talking about what the next House Speaker should do.
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:46.920]  But I saw Elijah Schaffer tweet yesterday saying,
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:48.920]  oh, I've seen the videos of beheading of babies.
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:49.920]  It's real.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:51.920]  Aborted babies.
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:55.920]  So we're aborting all these babies, third trimester, nine months old,
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:58.920]  sucking their brains out, selling their body parts,
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:01.920]  killing people that have car wrecks for their organs.
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:05.920]  It's all going on, taking Uyghur Muslim organs, all of it.
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:07.920]  And they sit back and say, no, that's not happening.
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.920]  That's all in your head.
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:12.920]  So I thought I'd play this short clip, go to break, come right back with your calls,
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:19.920]  the order they received, Ed, and then Daryl, and then everybody else, Joe.
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:22.920]  We're going to go to all of you, and we come right back after this one-minute break.
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.920]  But here he is, Tom Fenton of Judicial Watch,
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:29.920]  saying the next speaker should commit to leadership to stop the procedural abuse
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:34.920]  of Trump and other election rigging and Biden's open border invasion.
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:35.920]  Here he is.
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:38.920]  This is so key because this is where they're getting it all done.
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:41.920]  It's how they're getting all their power.
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:43.920]  This is how they're shutting the republic down.
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:49.920]  Here's the clip, and we'll be right back with your phone calls right after this.
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:50.920]  I'm Tom Fenton.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:55.920]  I'm president of Judicial Watch, America's leading government watchdog organization.
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:58.920]  We have a simple request for Congress, do your job.
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:00.920]  It's not enough to do investigations and reports.
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:08.920]  We need to stop the government corruption and abuse that is so concerning to the American people.
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:14.920]  In this new budget fight, or basically the old budget fight that we're being asked to pretend is new,
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.920]  there's an inflection point.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:20.920]  Are we going to continue to fund Republicans in the House,
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:25.920]  the wild abuse by the Biden administration of its political opponents,
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:28.920]  the mass censorship of tens of millions of Americans,
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:31.920]  the border invasion we've heard so much about,
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:36.920]  and the other wild abuses of power that are right now fully funded with Congress?
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:39.920]  And I don't know what we're talking about with a clean CR.
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:47.920]  I see a dirty CR, a CR that will fund the worst of dirty politics and corruption in our federal government.
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:52.920]  And there's a positive moral obligation right now, not next year, but right now,
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:57.920]  to stop the abuses, the effort to jail Trump on pretextual unprecedented charges
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:00.920]  in a way never seen before in American history.
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:06.920]  An obligation to stop right now the Biden administration censorship of tens of millions of Americans.
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:14.920]  The obligation to stop right now the illicit use of tax monies to fund abortions in our military and elsewhere.
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:22.920]  We need to stop right now the attack on children through the promotion of transgender extremism.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:30.920]  We need to stop right now the lack of serious investigation into the Biden administration corruption,
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:32.920]  specifically Biden corruption.
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:37.920]  We need a Justice Department or a special counsel that has confidence of the American people.
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:41.920]  All of these issues can be addressed in this continuing resolution,
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:50.920]  and if they don't want to address it, that suggests to me those who vote for it are on the side of corruption
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:54.920]  and those who oppose it are on the side of justice.
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:55.920]  Thank you very much.
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:01.920]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:06.920]  Where were you when the globals were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:10.920]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:11.920]  Well, I know where you are.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:16.920]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:22.920]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:29.920]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists, and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:33.920]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:36.920]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, a more powerful book.
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:41.920]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send it to number one right now.
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:45.920]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:51.920]  Get signed or unsigned copies of The Great Awakening right now at Infowars.com.
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:53.920]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:54.920]  This is a book everybody needs.
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:56.920]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening right now.
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:13.920]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:16.920]  Well, we're now into hour number three.
[02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:18.920]  A toll-free number to join us.
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:20.920]  As soon as a caller hangs up, it's your chance to call them.
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:21.920]  We'd love to hear from you.
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:23.920]  877-789-2539.
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:26.920]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:30.920]  And I did pretty good taking calls last hour, but I want to do really good this hour.
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:36.920]  So I'm going to give each caller 90 seconds, and I'm going to give a 30-second comment and move the next person.
[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:38.920]  Ed in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:39.920]  Go ahead.
[02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:44.920]  I'm sitting on the ground in the middle of a dirt road with my two dogs.
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:47.920]  There's an eagle nest about 100 yards away.
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:49.920]  We used to talk about this, Alex, 20 years ago.
[02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:51.920]  I'd call twice a week, hunting, fishing.
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:56.920]  We don't have time for that now, but two great movies you must see.
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:06:58.920]  Yul Brynner, a Russian actor.
[02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:02.920]  The Journey and Taras Bulba.
[02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:09.920]  Explains the Russian people, especially the Cossacks, where Zaporizhzhia is, where the war is right now.
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:11.920]  I love Yul Brynner.
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:13.920]  So he's in a movie called The Journey.
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:15.920]  And Taras Bulba.
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:16.920]  Two movies.
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:18.920]  Two will really show the Russian people.
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:19.920]  What's the other movie?
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:22.920]  Taras Bulba.
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:25.920]  It's a famous Russian story.
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:28.920]  Yeah, that's one of my mom's favorite actors is Yul Brynner.
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:32.920]  The Journey is actually filmed during the Hungarian uprising.
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:34.920]  He's a major in the Russian army.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.920]  It was actually filmed during the uprising.
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:39.920]  And it's such a great movie.
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:42.920]  You and your wife will love it.
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:44.920]  I love Yul Brynner.
[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:45.920]  What else is going on?
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:47.920]  That's it, brother.
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.920]  I wish we had more time to talk about it.
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:50.920]  No, you got another.
[02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:51.920]  Keep going.
[02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:52.920]  So you've been listening.
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:54.920]  It sounds good where you're at, brother.
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:57.920]  I wish I was there on the back hanging out, brother.
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:07:59.920]  I know you do, bud.
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:01.920]  Got it.
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:03.920]  So, you know, I'm going to talk about this next week.
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:08.920]  But I just spent a time with a guy that I would describe as the conservative populist.
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:14.920]  The version of the guy that wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls.
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:22.920]  And it was just incredible to hang out with him for a few days there in the middle of nowhere.
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:24.920]  And we're talking in the middle of nowhere.
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:30.920]  And I would describe it as incredible.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:32.920]  But you're right, man.
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:37.920]  When you're out in the countryside in the middle of nowhere and the people, it is so refreshing.
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:39.920]  Ernest Hemingway.
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:41.920]  He was a big outdoorsman.
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:42.920]  He was a liberal.
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:43.920]  They said he was a communist.
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:45.920]  But you read his books and you hear what he was into.
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:48.920]  He was a man's man and just obsessed with the outdoors.
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:49.920]  So am I.
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:50.920]  I don't even let myself do it.
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:52.920]  Because if I ever go do it, I'm gone.
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:59.920]  My family is, you know, hunting and trapping and raising cows and chickens and working.
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:01.920]  And that's what most of my family does.
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:02.920]  They're so happy.
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:06.920]  And man, if I ever even went that direction, I'd never come back.
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:07.920]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:09.920]  All right.
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:10.920]  Joe in Florida.
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:11.920]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:12.920]  Go ahead.
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:13.920]  Same here, Alex.
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:14.920]  I'm fishing every day down here.
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:17.920]  I can't out in the outside, out back, any chance I can.
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:18.920]  I just want to say God bless you.
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:20.920]  You're an American patriot.
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:23.920]  And my question to you is, what are the odds?
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:25.920]  You guys were almost hit on the head earlier.
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:31.920]  Iran, Joe, Joe's a demon with everything going on his back towards the wall.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:37.920]  What are the odds that Iran and Joe have started a war in quotation marks just to stop Trump from.
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:39.920]  Because they both hate Trump.
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:40.920]  Absolutely.
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:41.920]  Listen, listen, listen.
[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:46.920]  I like Ronald Reagan, but Ronald Reagan got approval for vaccine liability protection.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:47.920]  He approved aspartame.
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:49.920]  He approved glyphosate.
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:53.920]  Ronald Reagan sat there and green lit all this evil stuff that's killed hundreds of millions of people.
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:59.920]  So Ronald Reagan was not a bad person, but he literally signed off on the worst stuff in American history.
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:01.920]  So let's just be honest about Ronald Reagan.
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:08.920]  And it is the same thing now that is basically going on.
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:16.920]  And Iran made a deal in 1980, 1979 into 80 to hold those hostages to get rid of Jimmy Carter.
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:18.920]  I don't like Jimmy Carter.
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:20.920]  My point was that was a deal.
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:26.920]  And Iran has backdoor deals with the left to attack America when it's needed to suspend the election.
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:28.920]  But then we won't attack Iran.
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:33.920]  Just like they're not blaming Iran now, even though Iran's behind this attack on Israel.
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:35.920]  And so that's not debatable.
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:37.920]  That's the facts.
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:43.920]  And I think Iran is going to pull some major sleeper cell stuff in the next 13 months ahead of this election to help Joe Biden and the globalists.
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:45.920]  And I totally agree.
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:49.920]  The CIA put the Ayatollah Khomeini in and they don't control him, but they're working with him.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:51.920]  And that's going on.
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:54.920]  Yep. And that's why they had so many people come to this board.
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:56.920]  None of them want to assimilate with us in our culture.
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:58.920]  Just like Michael Savage says about language borders.
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:00.920]  Nothing against the Persians.
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:04.920]  But if we think of Machiavelli, we think of sick double dealing.
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:08.920]  We think of just mental illness, triple cross BS.
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:10.920]  That's the Persians.
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:13.920]  I mean, and they meet the CIA and it's like two demons having sex.
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:17.920]  I mean, Iran is deep in this.
[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:19.920]  Deep in this.
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:21.920]  Yep. Well, one last thing.
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:23.920]  I just want to shout out my little brother.
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:25.920]  He got me the Great Reset sign last year for Christmas.
[02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:27.920]  Shout out to you.
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:29.920]  Brother, thank you.
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:32.920]  Joe, if your brother hadn't got you that book, we'd be off air right now.
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:35.920]  We sold $2 million of that book.
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:40.920]  And I gave 95% of it to free speech systems.
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:42.920]  And I took 5% to pay my legal bills.
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:44.920]  And here it is.
[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:46.920]  It's a very liberating feeling because I'll never give up.
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:48.920]  I'll never back down.
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:50.920]  Skip this break coming up, but I could give out.
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:54.920]  And a sick part of me has done this so long that I'm like, I've done my mission.
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:57.920]  I'll be even bigger if I just disappear, but I can't.
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:11:59.920]  So I'm going to tell listeners,
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:02.920]  you bought the Great Reset and the war for the world last year.
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:04.920]  $2 million came in roughly.
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:06.920]  It was like 2.1 million.
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:08.920]  We had to pay for the book.
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:10.920]  So, so it was like million and a half bucks.
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:16.920]  I gave that all to free speech systems, even though I owned it and controlled it.
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:18.920]  And I got back my $400,000.
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:20.920]  Sounds like a lot.
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:24.920]  I'm a million dollars plus in the hole in bills.
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:27.920]  And it's a very liberating feeling because I've never had more podcasts.
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:29.920]  Want me?
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:33.920]  I can sit at home and do my show, but I wouldn't have the infrastructure.
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:35.920]  The crew wouldn't be on talk radio.
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:37.920]  We're still in hundreds of radio stations.
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:39.920]  The enemy can't control.
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:41.920]  So it'd be a big victory.
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.920]  They shut us down, but I'm having to take a hit financially to do that,
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:46.920]  which I'm willing to do.
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:48.920]  I just want listeners to know.
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:52.920]  Now part two is out 200 pages.
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:53.920]  Longer, huge book.
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:55.920]  Incredible.
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:12:57.920]  The great awakening.
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:12:59.920]  Get it signed as a fundraiser.
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:01.920]  Get it unsigned as an on fundraiser.
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:06.920]  Info war store.com or since the number one on amazon.com, get it at amazon.com.
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:08.920]  That makes bookstores order it.
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:12.920]  Then we get a bunch out there and you know, we sold hundreds of thousands of
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:17.920]  these in bookstores and we got like $2 a piece or whatever, but it didn't matter
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:19.920]  in front of this son of a bitch.
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:20.920]  So that last book kept us on air.
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:23.920]  And I was like, hell, I just recorded like 10 hours of stuff with the,
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:25.920]  with the guy that helped me write it.
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:29.920]  This book, I spent five times, at least more time on it.
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:34.920]  In fact, most of this book I wrote, we had to cut 300 pages out of it.
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:37.920]  And they had a researcher, a lawyer to make sure they didn't get sued.
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:39.920]  That was over me and checked every part of it.
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:44.920]  I spent five times conservatively more time on this book than the last one.
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:46.920]  And the last book's good.
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:49.920]  You got the globalist quotes and their operations and what they're up to.
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:51.920]  But this book is a grand slam.
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:53.920]  And the last book's a home run.
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:55.920]  This is a grand slam.
[02:13:56.920 --> 02:13:59.920]  The great awakening info or store.com sign or unsigned.
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:03.920]  But regardless, these are products you need.
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:06.920]  And we have the flash sales going right now up to 60% off.
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:08.920]  It's got to end this weekend.
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:11.920]  Real red bill plus DNA force plus.
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:14.920]  Brain force plus the great new tropic right now.
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:16.920]  Info or store.com.
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:18.920]  All right, Daryl in Missouri.
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:20.920]  You're on the air.
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:22.920]  Go ahead.
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:24.920]  Hello.
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:25.920]  Thanks for taking the call, Alex.
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:29.920]  I'm Missouri battle flag on Twitter and I have a lawsuit against the ADL.
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.920]  And I'd like folks to look it up.
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:34.920]  I'll repost it at the top of my page.
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:36.920]  I'd like to buy you a chicken fried steak.
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:38.920]  If you were here with me, tell me about it.
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:42.920]  Well, uh, I talked to you about four months ago and, and, uh,
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.920]  you asked me if I was in the clan and I'm not.
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:48.920]  And I, I think we have to, you know, you were saying, uh,
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:50.920]  let's not kill people.
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:52.920]  And you had a whole list there and I'd say,
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:54.920]  let's not kill the Muslims either.
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:56.920]  And you know, they're, they're calling them animals.
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:01.920]  And I'm accused of being a racist hater and that's not true.
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:03.920]  And I'd like people to read my complaint.
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:06.920]  They've put a motion to dismiss forward and I,
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:07.920]  and it's really a summary judgment.
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:09.920]  I'm a pro se attorney.
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:11.920]  Why did I ask you if you were in the clan?
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:13.920]  I mean, here's the deal.
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:16.920]  The clan's fed run and have a picture of me at a clan rally where someone
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:18.920]  said, Hey, Daryl, say hail Christ.
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:20.920]  And I, I made a salute.
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:22.920]  I don't know.
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:23.920]  I don't remember.
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:25.920]  I called you the KKK.
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:27.920]  I don't know who you are.
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:29.920]  What?
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:31.920]  No, you asked me if I was in the KKK.
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:33.920]  And I said, I'm not.
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:35.920]  But, and I'm not, they have a picture of me.
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:37.920]  They have 17 million views.
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:39.920]  And they tell everyone I'm a white supremacist racist.
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:41.920]  And I'm not.
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:43.920]  What has 17 million views?
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:46.920]  The ADL article about me.
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:48.920]  Okay.
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:49.920]  Here's the deal.
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:51.920]  I don't know all this.
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:53.920]  I vaguely remember your call.
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:55.920]  I guess you brought this up.
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:57.920]  I asked, are you a member of it?
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:15:59.920]  Like I'm accusing you.
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:01.920]  I just asked you, I don't.
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:03.920]  Thank you for putting your heart and soul into what you do.
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:05.920]  And, uh, the, you know, why did ban the ADL go viral?
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:07.920]  I filed a lawsuit against him about a week before that.
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:09.920]  I think they were setting this up for,
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:11.920]  to take the attention off of Ukraine
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:13.920]  because everyone's done with Ukraine.
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:15.920]  And, and you know what?
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:17.920]  They, they are behind everything that goes on.
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:19.920]  Not you.
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:21.920]  But they're behind everything.
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:23.920]  Well, there's no doubt the Israeli leadership
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:25.920]  and the majority of Jews in polls say that.
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:27.920]  Almost 9%.
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:29.920]  I'm not against the Jews.
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:31.920]  I'm not against Israel, but I'm not going to lie.
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:33.920]  Israel's leadership knew the attack was coming.
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:34.920]  Obama.
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:36.920]  Oh, Biden gave them the money.
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:38.920]  And that's a fact.
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:40.920]  If they go in there with ground forces,
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:42.920]  all they're going to do is inflame the Muslims more.
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:44.920]  They killed a teacher in France.
[02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:46.920]  They allow all these.
[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:48.920]  That's all part of the plan.
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:50.920]  I totally agree.
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:52.920]  Oh yeah.
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:54.920]  But I mean, here's my deal.
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:56.920]  I don't support the Muslims either.
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:16:58.920]  So I'm just saying, okay, yeah, Israel knew.
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:00.920]  Let it happen.
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:02.920]  I just have to say the fact that I'll be attacked by the ADL.
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:04.920]  And so that's where I'm at.
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:06.920]  I mean, you understand.
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:08.920]  Israel's got thousands of nuclear weapons.
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:10.920]  Right.
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:11.920]  So they're not going anywhere.
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:13.920]  And I don't like I've never been to Russia.
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:15.920]  I don't work for Russia.
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:17.920]  I don't like our government starting a war with Russia.
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:19.920]  All I'm saying is this needs to stop.
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:21.920]  I agree.
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:23.920]  All right.
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:25.920]  Whenever you talk about the children
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:27.920]  with the penises in the vagina,
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:29.920]  I'm outside, but often it's playing
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:31.920]  and my children are in the room.
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:32.920]  I wish they could say privates or things like that.
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:34.920]  I mean, they're eight and 10, the little one.
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:36.920]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:38.920]  Let me speak to that.
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:40.920]  I'm not a vulgar person.
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:42.920]  I have a big vocabulary.
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:45.920]  But you see these parents in Austin, Texas.
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:47.920]  It's happened like four times.
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:49.920]  I know of including our reporter.
[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:51.920]  Chrissy Lee last year.
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:55.920]  They have for her kids that are in middle school.
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:57.920]  She's got like five kids.
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:17:59.920]  She's got a couple of middle school kids.
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:00.920]  She's got a couple of middle school.
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:03.920]  They have a book that has pedophilia in it
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:05.920]  with actual graphics.
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:07.920]  She went and read that at city council
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:09.920]  and they threw her out and threatened to arrest her.
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:13.920]  You think I want to read that crap on air?
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:15.920]  You think I want to be vulgar?
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:19.920]  There are arresting parents in other areas.
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:21.920]  You've seen the videos.
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:24.920]  In Virginia, you name it.
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:26.920]  Florida.
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:28.920]  That read those.
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:30.920]  Those books.
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:32.920]  You think we want to get on air?
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:34.920]  Because I get it.
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:36.920]  I'm on some TV stations, some cable stations, radio stations.
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:38.920]  We have an affiliate relations department.
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:40.920]  John Harmon runs it.
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:42.920]  And every time I show genderqueer,
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:44.920]  the main book that's everywhere, there's a bunch of others.
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:46.920]  We get stations call us.
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:48.920]  They say, listen, we really like Alex's show.
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:50.920]  It's successful.
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:52.920]  But we're going to have to turn his show off
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:54.920]  if he does that again.
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:56.920]  I don't want to be turned off your station.
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:18:58.920]  I'm not challenging them.
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:03.920]  So let me ask the stations a question.
[02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:06.920]  Let's just sit back and just talk about this.
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:10.920]  I'm supposed to not read out of a book
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:12.920]  or show you what's in it.
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:14.920]  Even though I've never looked at pedophilia,
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:16.920]  but I've read that book.
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:18.920]  So I've seen pedophilia.
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:20.920]  When I read it, I was so offended
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:22.920]  when she brought it in.
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:24.920]  I've covered it before, but she brought it in
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:26.920]  with the AISD tab on it from the library.
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:28.920]  And she said, can I cover this on air?
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:30.920]  And I opened it up in my office.
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:32.920]  And I had lunch.
[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:34.920]  I hadn't eaten yet the whole day.
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:36.920]  And I couldn't eat my lunch.
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:38.920]  And I was like, what the heck?
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:42.920]  So if my neighbor killed a bunch of people
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:45.920]  in the neighborhood and buried them in the backyard,
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:47.920]  should I call the police?
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:50.920]  Because it's horrible and gross to call the police
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:52.920]  and then have them dig up dead bodies.
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:54.920]  But you stopped them killing more people.
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:55.920]  I mean, really, folks, I don't,
[02:19:56.920 --> 02:19:57.920]  I mean, I get your call, brother.
[02:19:58.920 --> 02:19:59.920]  But just, you've got your children
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:01.920]  listening in your house.
[02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:03.920]  And thank God they're probably homeschooled.
[02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:05.920]  Do you understand they're teaching
[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:07.920]  elementary students this?
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:09.920]  Do you understand this is going on
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:11.920]  in the schools?
[02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:13.920]  And then they've got us
[02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:15.920]  because city councils across the country,
[02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:17.920]  I've seen probably 10, 15 videos
[02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:19.920]  the last few months
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:22.920]  where they start reading genderqueer,
[02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:23.920]  which is the main one,
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:25.920]  but there's a bunch of books.
[02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:27.920]  And the police come and say,
[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:29.920]  you can't talk about children
[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:33.920]  having sex in front of this video feed,
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:35.920]  which I agree.
[02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:37.920]  It should not be on air.
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:39.920]  It should not even exist.
[02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:41.920]  I'm not against books,
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:43.920]  but pedophilia is illegal.
[02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:45.920]  I'm against those books.
[02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:47.920]  And we are banning those books in schools.
[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:49.920]  We're not burning them.
[02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:51.920]  Quite frankly, those should be burned.
[02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:53.920]  If you have a kid, burn the damn thing.
[02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:55.920]  It's illegal.
[02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:57.920]  It's not a book of free speech.
[02:20:58.920 --> 02:20:59.920]  It's a book of crime.
[02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:01.920]  It's a blueprint.
[02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:03.920]  So listen, I get Christian conservatives.
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:05.920]  My mother is the same way.
[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:07.920]  I go over there every couple weeks
[02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:09.920]  for dinner with my family
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:11.920]  and they'll bring up politics.
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:13.920]  And I say, can we just shut up about this?
[02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:15.920]  Because the minute I start talking
[02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:17.920]  about real stuff, my mom goes,
[02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:19.920]  I don't want to hear it.
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:21.920]  This is too horrible.
[02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:24.920]  Anyway, how am I supposed to do my job
[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:28.920]  when I've been mailed a stack of books
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:30.920]  with library tags on them
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:32.920]  that is stuff I didn't even know
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:34.920]  as a 49-year-old man?
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:40.920]  I mean, they describe in these books,
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:42.920]  I'm in my backyard.
[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:44.920]  The neighbor is a nice man.
[02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:46.920]  He wants to take me in the shed.
[02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:48.920]  He tells me he wants to blank.
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:50.920]  I pull out my such and such.
[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:51.920]  He's such and such as me.
[02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:53.920]  It's so great.
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:55.920]  I love this.
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:56.920]  Now, I mean, it's pedophilia.
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:21:58.920]  It's grooming children for me rape.
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:00.920]  And I get it.
[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:01.920]  We're not supposed to read that on air.
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:03.920]  I understand that.
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:05.920]  How do I tell you it's going on
[02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:09.920]  unless I show it to you?
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:14.920]  A mother gets up, a father gets up,
[02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:16.920]  a coach gets up
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:18.920]  and starts reading these books
[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:19.920]  and in 30 seconds,
[02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:21.920]  the police are there taking him to jail.
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:25.920]  So you can read that to children,
[02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:29.920]  but I can't tell you what they're doing.
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:31.920]  They are literally gearing up
[02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:33.920]  to castrate millions of children.
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:35.920]  They've done it to tens of thousands,
[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:37.920]  hundreds of thousands around the world.
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:42.920]  I mean, am I supposed to quit?
[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:44.920]  Am I supposed to hang up my spurs?
[02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:46.920]  Because believe me, man,
[02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:47.920]  I don't want to sit here
[02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:49.920]  and read this crap.
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:54.920]  Our reporters tell me all the time.
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:56.920]  Hey, can we cover this on air?
[02:22:57.920 --> 02:22:58.920]  HBO has a new show about raping children.
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:00.920]  And I go, I don't know.
[02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:01.920]  Can I see that?
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:02.920]  Are you sure?
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:03.920]  Well, yeah, I got to see it.
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:05.920]  And it's a guy raping a little boy.
[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:08.920]  It's on HBO.
[02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:09.920]  I'm not supposed to watch that.
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:11.920]  I don't want to watch that.
[02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:13.920]  And I'm watching simulated rape
[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:15.920]  of a five-year-old boy.
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:17.920]  And I'm like, I'll be honest with you.
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:19.920]  They win.
[02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:21.920]  I didn't ever cover it.
[02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:23.920]  Owen a month ago says,
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:25.920]  hey, boss, can I cover this?
[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:27.920]  And I said, if you want to,
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:29.920]  he said, well, watch the clip.
[02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:31.920]  And I'm sitting there in my office
[02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:33.920]  right before he comes on.
[02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:35.920]  And I'm like, what?
[02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:37.920]  It was a three-minute clip.
[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:39.920]  I cut it off in a minute.
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:41.920]  And I said, what else happens?
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:42.920]  And then you call me
[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:43.920]  and I'm not mad at you.
[02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:46.920]  I'm not mad at you.
[02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:48.920]  But you call me and say,
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:51.920]  my children are listening.
[02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:53.920]  And I wish you wouldn't.
[02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:55.920]  This is not a show for children.
[02:23:56.920 --> 02:23:57.920]  You should listen to the show.
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:23:58.920]  Take clips you want
[02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:00.920]  that you think they can listen to.
[02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:01.920]  You curate.
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:02.920]  You decide what they hear.
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:04.920]  Not me.
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:05.920]  I'm talking to adults.
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:06.920]  And I'm not mad at you.
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:08.920]  But I'm pissed.
[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:10.920]  Not at you,
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:11.920]  but the situation.
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:13.920]  I have been put
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:14.920]  in an impossible position.
[02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:16.920]  How am I
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:18.920]  supposed to report
[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:19.920]  on what they're doing
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:21.920]  in the schools
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:22.920]  with your children
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:23.920]  and then as adults,
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:24.920]  you don't want to hear
[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:25.920]  what they're doing?
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:27.920]  You think police
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:28.920]  that investigate pedophilia like it?
[02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:29.920]  No, that's why most of them quit.
[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:31.920]  They get sick.
[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:33.920]  You think cops
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:34.920]  that dig up dead bodies
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:35.920]  or find dead bodies like it
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:36.920]  cover with maggots?
[02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:37.920]  No, it's their job.
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:39.920]  And you're the grand jury.
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:41.920]  How am I supposed
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:42.920]  to report to you
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:44.920]  what is going on?
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:46.920]  Do you agree?
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:47.920]  Because there's kids
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:48.920]  in the audience.
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:55.340]  We're not supposed to show you what they're saying and doing.
[02:24:59.340 --> 02:25:13.340]  Let that sink in. And I get it. It's not normal to go on the radio and TV and read books with color graphics, cartoons, lifestyle, like a picture.
[02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:17.340]  This is illegal to show a real image of a kid being raped, but they'll show it in these books.
[02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:26.340]  So you're looking at children being sexually abused, and then I show you those.
[02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:30.340]  We're on a lot of TV stations and cable stations. Good people put this on.
[02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:38.340]  And I get station managers get calls. Hey man, you're showing kids getting raped? Yeah, they're showing it in school.
[02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:42.340]  And so imagine the cops. The cops are standing there at a city council.
[02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:46.340]  Hey, this book my eight-year-old's reading says this and that. The cops are like, you can't read that.
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:53.340]  Absolutely you can't read that. You can't read that in city council, and you can't give that to children.
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:26:03.340]  Do you got me now? Do you understand me now? Do you know where I'm coming from? Comprende. Comprehend that.
[02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:09.340]  I said I got loaded phones, and I do. I just want to take your calls, but man, just look.
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:18.340]  Ted Gunderson, who was the head of the FBI in Southern California, who was in line with the FBI director, he ran Go and Tell Pro.
[02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:21.340]  He's famous, okay? He's dead now. Bladder cancer.
[02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:28.340]  He told me in 1997 at dinner in Austin, Texas. He stayed at my house that night.
[02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:33.340]  He told me they sell kids in auctions, and they traffic them all over the world.
[02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:38.340]  And I didn't think he was wrong, because I knew he was very credible, and later it all came out he was right.
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:46.340]  And then eight years ago, when my uncle was dying of pneumonia, before he passed out and died five days later,
[02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:54.340]  he told me, he grabbed me by the arm, and he said, you're right. I was there running operations in Central America.
[02:26:54.340 --> 02:27:01.340]  I was in charge of all the airfields and operations, but I wasn't involved in the actual operations on the ground, just the logistics.
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:06.340]  And they were shipping children out of the orphanages in Central and South America.
[02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:09.340]  And the word was they were being sold around the world.
[02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:12.340]  And I had to get out, Ted. I just want you to keep fighting whatever you do.
[02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:16.340]  And he's crying. He was dead five days later. He passed out the next day.
[02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:19.340]  And he's literally going, you got to stop him.
[02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:24.340]  Well, do you want me to get on air and tell you what he told me?
[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:35.340]  Or is it too scary for everybody that William Forrest Hammond, super decorated Vietnam combat vet, helicopter pilot,
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:43.340]  clandestine operations, secret army officer, Latin America, all of it, and he did all this stuff for the government.
[02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:46.340]  He told my mother this. She doesn't want me to talk about it.
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:49.340]  But he did what he was told in Vietnam. He was in Laos and Cambodia.
[02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:53.340]  He ran operations with opium. He did what he was ordered to do.
[02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:56.340]  He did it all, folks, because he thought it was some greater good.
[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:01.340]  And then he finally saw kids being loaded on C-130s, little five-year-old, six-year-old kids.
[02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:06.340]  And he said, what is this? And they said, shut your mouth.
[02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:11.340]  And then they tried to kill him and his partner and some of his guys that were under him.
[02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:12.340]  They tried to kill them all.
[02:28:13.340 --> 02:28:18.340]  And I picked him up when I was like eight years old off a C-130 in Dallas Air Force Base.
[02:28:19.340 --> 02:28:21.340]  And he came off in a wheelchair on that thing.
[02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:24.340]  They'd shot him up and killed his aide-de-camp.
[02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:26.340]  And that's how real this is.
[02:28:27.340 --> 02:28:33.340]  And am I not supposed to sit here and tell you what they did and tell you who they are and tell you what they're doing?
[02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:36.340]  How do I do that for you?
[02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:38.340]  How do I do that?
[02:28:38.340 --> 02:28:40.340]  I don't know how to thread that needle.
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:43.340]  So fine, I won't mention what they do to the kids.
[02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:45.340]  They'll just keep doing it forever.
[02:28:46.340 --> 02:28:48.340]  You're right. Stations are right. Everybody's right.
[02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:51.340]  We won't talk about it. We'll just ignore it and let it keep happening.
[02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:54.340]  I promise you, we won't talk about it anymore, okay?
[02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:00.340]  Last year, we put this book out.
[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:02.340]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:04.340]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:08.340]  Now we've put part two out, and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:13.340]  The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:15.340]  This is such a powerful book.
[02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:20.340]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them,
[02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:24.340]  and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[02:29:25.340 --> 02:29:26.340]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:28.340]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.

[02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:11.340]  which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:13.340]  And they can be found in fish,

[02:33:36.450 --> 02:33:39.450]  I didn't mean to spend 10 minutes ranting at the caller.
[02:33:39.450 --> 02:33:43.450]  But this is an adult show, okay, and I've got to tell you what's going on.
[02:33:43.450 --> 02:33:47.450]  And I don't want to read the books our kids are reading, I have to.
[02:33:47.450 --> 02:33:49.450]  And those parents don't want to go read those at city council.
[02:33:49.450 --> 02:33:51.450]  What are they supposed to do?
[02:33:51.450 --> 02:33:53.450]  We're doing the right thing.
[02:33:53.450 --> 02:33:56.450]  But don't worry, I'm the one that does the cover of this.
[02:33:56.450 --> 02:33:58.450]  You don't have to call and tell me not to cover stuff.
[02:33:58.450 --> 02:34:03.450]  I feel guilty that I hold this stuff back because I don't want to look at it.
[02:34:03.450 --> 02:34:08.450]  I've already seen a whole bunch of it, and then the stuff gets worse and worse.
[02:34:08.450 --> 02:34:13.450]  And that's what they're counting on, is that we're so horrified by this that we just give up.
[02:34:13.450 --> 02:34:17.450]  So I should canvass our radio and TV stations owners.
[02:34:17.450 --> 02:34:19.450]  I should canvass the listeners.
[02:34:19.450 --> 02:34:21.450]  What should our policy be?
[02:34:21.450 --> 02:34:23.450]  Because I don't know what to do.
[02:34:23.450 --> 02:34:25.450]  We should do a whole show on that.
[02:34:25.450 --> 02:34:29.450]  Should I show you what our children are being given?
[02:34:29.450 --> 02:34:31.450]  Because as adults we don't want to see it.
[02:34:31.450 --> 02:34:37.450]  I get it, it's profane, it's illegal, it's disgusting.
[02:34:37.450 --> 02:34:40.450]  But then if I don't expose it, I'm part of it.
[02:34:40.450 --> 02:34:42.450]  So I don't know what to do.
[02:34:46.420 --> 02:34:49.420]  Like I said about a month ago, Owen says,
[02:34:49.420 --> 02:34:52.420]  hey boss, I'm about to play this on the show.
[02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:53.420]  Can you watch it?
[02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:54.420]  And I'd already gone off air.
[02:34:54.420 --> 02:34:55.420]  I hadn't seen the clip.
[02:34:55.420 --> 02:34:57.420]  I went when he was already on air and I looked at it
[02:34:57.420 --> 02:34:59.420]  and like it was a three minute clip
[02:34:59.420 --> 02:35:01.420]  and like a minute and a half in I stopped it
[02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:05.420]  because it was the rape of a little kid on HBO
[02:35:05.420 --> 02:35:06.420]  and the little kid loving it.
[02:35:06.420 --> 02:35:08.420]  It was a sex scene, a little kid getting raped
[02:35:08.420 --> 02:35:09.420]  and how great it was.
[02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:11.420]  And I was like, what the hell?
[02:35:11.420 --> 02:35:13.420]  And I walked in, I told Owen, you go ahead and cover it
[02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:15.420]  but I'm not going to look at it.
[02:35:15.420 --> 02:35:16.420]  And then Owen really didn't even cover it
[02:35:16.420 --> 02:35:18.420]  because he didn't want to cover it.
[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:19.420]  I get that.
[02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:21.420]  It's like, you don't want to see this?
[02:35:21.420 --> 02:35:23.420]  Believe me, I don't want to.
[02:35:23.420 --> 02:35:28.420]  I don't need that in my life.
[02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:33.420]  Okay, then the kids are wide open.
[02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:36.420]  It's like asking the police to not investigate a dead body.
[02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:38.420]  Oh, the police don't want to look at a dead body
[02:35:38.420 --> 02:35:40.420]  full of bullet holes and dead in a field
[02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:41.420]  with maggots all over it.
[02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:43.420]  Okay, great, the person gets away with it.
[02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:46.420]  You think that's a fun job?
[02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:49.420]  And we can't just put this on the police.
[02:35:49.420 --> 02:35:51.420]  They're overwhelmed, their funding's cut.
[02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:53.420]  We have to admit all this is what I'm saying.
[02:35:53.420 --> 02:35:55.420]  And I don't know the perfect way to deal with it.
[02:35:55.420 --> 02:35:57.420]  But don't think for a minute we're having fun
[02:35:57.420 --> 02:36:00.420]  talking about this stuff.
[02:36:00.420 --> 02:36:03.420]  Don't think for 10 seconds I want to sit there
[02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:05.420]  and watch the carnage in the Middle East
[02:36:05.420 --> 02:36:07.420]  or any of this stuff.
[02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:09.420]  But the way we beat it is admitting,
[02:36:09.420 --> 02:36:10.420]  and I'm going to shut up now.
[02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:11.420]  We've got a load of phone lines.
[02:36:11.420 --> 02:36:14.420]  Kelly in Arkansas, Army on evasion of Hamas.
[02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:15.420]  Next events.
[02:36:15.420 --> 02:36:16.420]  Go ahead.
[02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:17.420]  Thanks for holding.
[02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:19.420]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:21.420]  Yeah, I forgot to tell the screener
[02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:24.420]  that I was also a veteran of the Gulf War.
[02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:25.420]  I'm 53 years old, brother.
[02:36:25.420 --> 02:36:27.420]  I've been listening to you for a long time.
[02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:29.420]  I was red-pilled while over in Iraq,
[02:36:29.420 --> 02:36:32.420]  Saudi Arabia and Iraq for the duration.
[02:36:32.420 --> 02:36:34.420]  And I felt like we let them down
[02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:36.420]  as we were gathering prisoners.
[02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:37.420]  There was fear.
[02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:39.420]  I felt like we were liberating the oppressed
[02:36:39.420 --> 02:36:41.420]  is what we're lied to about.
[02:36:41.420 --> 02:36:45.420]  But I appreciate your guys' validity,
[02:36:45.420 --> 02:36:47.420]  your neutrality.
[02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:49.420]  You're a blessing,
[02:36:49.420 --> 02:36:51.420]  and I would love to bear witness
[02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:54.420]  to your judgment
[02:36:54.420 --> 02:36:57.420]  and your testimony
[02:36:57.420 --> 02:36:59.420]  that you tell almost daily.
[02:36:59.420 --> 02:37:02.420]  Anyway, my point is I wanted to get to
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:04.420]  is I have a talking point
[02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:06.420]  with my friends and buddies,
[02:37:06.420 --> 02:37:08.420]  fellow infantry,
[02:37:08.420 --> 02:37:09.420]  Chief Warrant,
[02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:12.420]  Rotary Wing Combat Aircraft Pilots.
[02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:14.420]  I'm like, at what point,
[02:37:14.420 --> 02:37:18.420]  what operation have you ever been involved with
[02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:22.420]  where you leave kits and uniforms,
[02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:24.420]  vehicles on site?
[02:37:24.420 --> 02:37:26.420]  And I understand special operations need
[02:37:26.420 --> 02:37:29.420]  or covert ops need to BB mounts,
[02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:32.420]  get out, mix in with population.
[02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:34.420]  But there's also a military point
[02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:35.420]  as an infantryman.
[02:37:35.420 --> 02:37:37.420]  You don't leave your weapons behind
[02:37:37.420 --> 02:37:38.420]  because you're going to have to
[02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:39.420]  fight your way off the objective
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:40.420]  and get back to base
[02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:42.420]  or where you get to pick up or whatever.
[02:37:42.420 --> 02:37:46.420]  So that's how I stand,
[02:37:46.420 --> 02:37:47.420]  but that's my talking point.
[02:37:47.420 --> 02:37:48.420]  I can tell you're really smart
[02:37:48.420 --> 02:37:50.420]  and a little bit of this is above my head,
[02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:52.420]  so talk to me like I'm five years old.
[02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:53.420]  I'm listening to you.
[02:37:53.420 --> 02:37:54.420]  You've got plenty of time here.
[02:37:54.420 --> 02:37:56.420]  What mission are you talking about
[02:37:56.420 --> 02:37:58.420]  or what's going on?
[02:37:58.420 --> 02:37:59.420]  So any missions,
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:00.420]  any missions as an infantryman
[02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:01.420]  or special ops guy is on,
[02:38:01.420 --> 02:38:03.420]  you don't leave your equipment on site.
[02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:05.420]  And so we immediately saw that
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:07.420]  in the propaganda news.
[02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:09.420]  Yeah, so you're talking about Afghanistan,
[02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:11.420]  tens of billions of dollars of weapons left
[02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:12.420]  or what are you getting at?
[02:38:12.420 --> 02:38:14.420]  Well, I'm getting at the point that
[02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:17.420]  we immediately saw photos of equipment
[02:38:17.420 --> 02:38:19.420]  that allegedly Hamas left behind,
[02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:21.420]  equipment and uniforms here
[02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:22.420]  in this recent attack.
[02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:24.420]  And my buddies, I'm trying to get with them,
[02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:26.420]  what point did you ever leave
[02:38:26.420 --> 02:38:28.420]  equipment and stuff on site?
[02:38:28.420 --> 02:38:29.420]  They don't.
[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:31.420]  Now refer to the Princess Bride,
[02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:34.420]  a goofy 1985 show
[02:38:34.420 --> 02:38:39.420]  where Prince Humperdinck
[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:41.420]  was trying to start a war
[02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:43.420]  against the Kingdom of Gilder
[02:38:43.420 --> 02:38:45.420]  by framing them for the murder
[02:38:45.420 --> 02:38:46.420]  of Princess Buttercup
[02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:49.420]  by leaving a uniform patch at her body.
[02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:50.420]  Sure, sure.
[02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:52.420]  We're not even attacking,
[02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:53.420]  you know what you're saying.
[02:38:53.420 --> 02:38:55.420]  When there's obvious signs of a setup
[02:38:55.420 --> 02:38:56.420]  and a frame up,
[02:38:56.420 --> 02:38:58.420]  so what did you see in this latest thing
[02:38:58.420 --> 02:38:59.420]  that leads you to that
[02:38:59.420 --> 02:39:00.420]  or what are you saying?
[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:02.420]  Well, yeah, it was an immediate,
[02:39:02.420 --> 02:39:04.420]  so it was a police,
[02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:05.420]  former police officer
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:06.420]  after I got out of the service
[02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:08.420]  because of injuries and all.
[02:39:08.420 --> 02:39:09.420]  Otherwise, I'd probably still be in
[02:39:09.420 --> 02:39:10.420]  after 35 years, brother.
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:13.420]  But what you do as an investigator
[02:39:13.420 --> 02:39:14.420]  is you slow down,
[02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:16.420]  you take control of the scene,
[02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:18.420]  you try to figure out what's going on.
[02:39:18.420 --> 02:39:21.420]  And yeah, possibly items of,
[02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:22.420]  those are evident.
[02:39:22.420 --> 02:39:24.420]  But with Hamas leaving that stuff there
[02:39:24.420 --> 02:39:26.420]  and then immediately putting it on the air
[02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:27.420]  and showing everybody,
[02:39:27.420 --> 02:39:28.420]  look at all these weapons,
[02:39:28.420 --> 02:39:29.420]  it's Hamas.
[02:39:29.420 --> 02:39:31.420]  That's just my point.
[02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:33.420]  It's, what's up with that?
[02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:35.420]  It's fishy.
[02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:36.420]  No, I agree with you.
[02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:38.420]  So what specifically,
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:40.420]  because I did see some uniforms
[02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:41.420]  and evidence of Hamas,
[02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:42.420]  maybe they killed soldiers,
[02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:43.420]  they showed it,
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:44.420]  but I'm not,
[02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:45.420]  so bring me up to speed.
[02:39:45.420 --> 02:39:48.420]  What did you see that looked staged to you?
[02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:50.420]  Well, it was the fact that they,
[02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:51.420]  that the news,
[02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:53.420]  whoever was filming over there
[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:55.420]  at the scenes
[02:39:55.420 --> 02:39:58.420]  was showing videos of the Toyotas of war
[02:39:58.420 --> 02:39:59.420]  with weapons in the back of them
[02:39:59.420 --> 02:40:00.420]  and uniforms.
[02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:03.420]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:05.420]  Clearly Israel knew it was coming
[02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:07.420]  and stood down, just a fact.
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:09.420]  And when I try to post on Twitter,
[02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:11.420]  I'm not allowed to,
[02:40:11.420 --> 02:40:12.420]  but Hamas and Hezbollah
[02:40:12.420 --> 02:40:14.420]  can show all the kidnapping and murder.
[02:40:14.420 --> 02:40:16.420]  Why are they allowed to do that?
[02:40:18.420 --> 02:40:19.420]  I don't know.
[02:40:19.420 --> 02:40:22.420]  It's the fear mongering.
[02:40:22.420 --> 02:40:25.420]  Brother, in 1990 in August,
[02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:27.420]  I saw that lie.
[02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:28.420]  We found out later,
[02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:30.420]  I was bloodthirsty
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:32.420]  like every other patriotic American
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:34.420]  and I wanted to go liberate
[02:40:34.420 --> 02:40:36.420]  the people of Iraq.
[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:39.420]  I see it now.
[02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:41.420]  I see the emotion building up.
[02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:44.420]  Talk to me like I'm five years old.
[02:40:44.420 --> 02:40:46.420]  I'm on a combat special ops veteran like you.
[02:40:46.420 --> 02:40:48.420]  What are you saying you saw?
[02:40:48.420 --> 02:40:50.420]  What's the final analysis?
[02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:51.420]  What do I say I saw?
[02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:55.420]  We never left our equipment on site
[02:40:55.420 --> 02:40:57.420]  on the objective.
[02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:00.420]  So what do you think is really going on over there?
[02:41:00.420 --> 02:41:02.420]  Because clearly the Israelis stood down.
[02:41:02.420 --> 02:41:04.420]  I mean, no one debates that.
[02:41:04.420 --> 02:41:06.420]  Brother, I don't want to see anybody's babies dead.
[02:41:06.420 --> 02:41:07.420]  I love Israeli people.
[02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:09.420]  I love Muslim people.
[02:41:09.420 --> 02:41:10.420]  I want to love everybody.
[02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:11.420]  I want to love Christ
[02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:13.420]  because I'm commanded to love my neighbor.
[02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:15.420]  And that's everybody.
[02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:17.420]  But I don't trust this.
[02:41:17.420 --> 02:41:19.420]  This entire thing is nefarious.
[02:41:19.420 --> 02:41:23.420]  Until we get immediate, immediate photos and film.
[02:41:23.420 --> 02:41:24.420]  No, no.
[02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:26.420]  We got more footage in one day
[02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:28.420]  than a year and a half in Ukraine.
[02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:30.420]  Right.
[02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:31.420]  Absolutely.
[02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:32.420]  That's what everybody's saying
[02:41:32.420 --> 02:41:34.420]  including all my military contacts are like
[02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:37.420]  instant coverage, instant everything.
[02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:38.420]  Instant.
[02:41:38.420 --> 02:41:40.420]  So I haven't figured out exactly what's going on
[02:41:40.420 --> 02:41:41.420]  but it doesn't look good.
[02:41:41.420 --> 02:41:42.420]  Me either.
[02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:43.420]  Nope, me either.
[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:45.420]  And brother, I appreciate you.
[02:41:45.420 --> 02:41:46.420]  I got a plug for everything.
[02:41:46.420 --> 02:41:47.420]  All your products are good.
[02:41:47.420 --> 02:41:48.420]  Apacaba is excellent.
[02:41:49.420 --> 02:41:51.420]  I drank that with Fijian Infantry
[02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:53.420]  while deployed again to an MFO,
[02:41:53.420 --> 02:41:55.420]  Multi-Force National Observers mission
[02:41:55.420 --> 02:41:59.420]  over in Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, that area.
[02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:01.420]  Worked with some IDF.
[02:42:01.420 --> 02:42:02.420]  Man, it was a great thing.
[02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:04.420]  Your stuff is phenomenal.
[02:42:04.420 --> 02:42:05.420]  Your dad's products are great.
[02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:06.420]  Owen Troyer, love ya.
[02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:08.420]  My name is Kelly Hewitt.
[02:42:08.420 --> 02:42:09.420]  I'm on Twitter.
[02:42:09.420 --> 02:42:11.420]  I'm just trying to get out information
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:13.420]  and I plug for you guys constantly.
[02:42:13.420 --> 02:42:14.420]  Kelly, we love you.
[02:42:14.420 --> 02:42:15.420]  Kelly Hewitt on Twitter.
[02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:16.420]  Thank you, sir.
[02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:17.420]  Wow.
[02:42:17.420 --> 02:42:18.420]  Yeah, I mean, folks,
[02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:20.420]  I'm not going to sit up here like other talk shows,
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:21.420]  say I know everything.
[02:42:21.420 --> 02:42:23.420]  All I know is all this stinks to heaven.
[02:42:23.420 --> 02:42:24.420]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:29.420]  And we got a lot of Islamics in this country
[02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:31.420]  and they're ready to blow stuff up.
[02:42:31.420 --> 02:42:33.420]  And the government's not going to have to create
[02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:34.420]  some fake cell.
[02:42:34.420 --> 02:42:36.420]  The Ayatollah Khomeini gives an order,
[02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:37.420]  it all starts.
[02:42:37.420 --> 02:42:41.420]  And I am going to go next level on this government.
[02:42:41.420 --> 02:42:43.420]  I don't mean violence, but I mean,
[02:42:43.420 --> 02:42:45.420]  I'm going to protest outside your house.
[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:48.420]  I mean, I'm going to sue you.
[02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:51.420]  I'm going to get people to get hurt to sue you.
[02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:52.420]  Whatever it takes.
[02:42:52.420 --> 02:42:54.420]  We are not going to sit here
[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:57.420]  while your little Islamic pets attack us
[02:42:57.420 --> 02:43:00.420]  because I'm not going to sit there and take this.
[02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:02.420]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:43:02.420 --> 02:43:04.420]  So understand that.
[02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:05.420]  I am not going to sit here
[02:43:05.420 --> 02:43:07.420]  while you bring these people in
[02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:08.420]  and they attack us
[02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:10.420]  and then you get budget increases.
[02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:12.420]  It's not happening.
[02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:13.420]  Would you get a budget increase
[02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:14.420]  to turn the country loose
[02:43:14.420 --> 02:43:15.420]  and leave us alone?
[02:43:15.420 --> 02:43:17.420]  Yeah, we're not against people making money here.
[02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:20.420]  But man, this is over, folks.
[02:43:20.420 --> 02:43:21.420]  It's over.
[02:43:21.420 --> 02:43:24.420]  It's over.
[02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:27.420]  All right, let's go to Tony in Chicago.
[02:43:27.420 --> 02:43:28.420]  You're on the air.
[02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:29.420]  Thanks for holding.
[02:43:29.420 --> 02:43:31.420]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:43:31.420 --> 02:43:34.420]  I'm glad to hear that you're doing your levelest best,
[02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:38.420]  you, Owen, and the other folks
[02:43:39.420 --> 02:43:44.420]  to give an even, balanced, non-planted report.
[02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:45.420]  Let me add this and I'll let you talk.
[02:43:45.420 --> 02:43:46.420]  I appreciate you.
[02:43:46.420 --> 02:43:47.420]  People are like on the side,
[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:48.420]  I see the comments,
[02:43:48.420 --> 02:43:49.420]  like, well, one site,
[02:43:49.420 --> 02:43:51.420]  one article is anti-Israel,
[02:43:51.420 --> 02:43:52.420]  one article is pro-Israel,
[02:43:52.420 --> 02:43:53.420]  one article is neutral.
[02:43:53.420 --> 02:43:55.420]  We're taking all the interesting stuff
[02:43:55.420 --> 02:43:56.420]  and I told my crew,
[02:43:56.420 --> 02:43:58.420]  I said show all perspectives.
[02:43:58.420 --> 02:44:02.420]  We want to just show everything.
[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:05.420]  That's basically what true journalism is.
[02:44:05.420 --> 02:44:08.420]  I believe you're the last of the true journalists left
[02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:10.420]  that has a wide audience.
[02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:12.420]  I remember Paul Harvey when I was a kid
[02:44:12.420 --> 02:44:14.420]  and I do remember even Tex Marsh.
[02:44:14.420 --> 02:44:19.420]  And it just really indignates me that the media,
[02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:20.420]  the general media,
[02:44:20.420 --> 02:44:22.420]  is going to be on one side or the other.
[02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:24.420]  And they're money making.
[02:44:24.420 --> 02:44:25.420]  They're not about the truth,
[02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:26.420]  they're about money.
[02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:29.420]  And the question that I wanted to ask you is,
[02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:34.420]  I mean, here President Trump was criticized even by Israel
[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:37.420]  because he spoke the truth about when they got that general,
[02:44:37.420 --> 02:44:40.420]  Soleimani, or whatever the general's name was,
[02:44:40.420 --> 02:44:41.420]  when Trump went out.
[02:44:41.420 --> 02:44:43.420]  When he killed the Iranian general.
[02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:44.420]  That's right.
[02:44:44.420 --> 02:44:47.420]  At the last moment Netanyahu backed off,
[02:44:47.420 --> 02:44:51.420]  backed out and he did not want to go with Trump on that
[02:44:51.420 --> 02:44:53.420]  and Trump went ahead.
[02:44:53.420 --> 02:44:56.420]  That's right, because they got backdoor deals with him.
[02:44:56.420 --> 02:44:57.420]  That's right.
[02:44:57.420 --> 02:44:58.420]  Exactly.
[02:44:58.420 --> 02:44:59.420]  If we actually wiped them out,
[02:44:59.420 --> 02:45:00.420]  I'd be for it,
[02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:01.420]  but we don't do that.
[02:45:01.420 --> 02:45:03.420]  You don't have to kill a million Muslims,
[02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:04.420]  you kill their leaders.
[02:45:04.420 --> 02:45:05.420]  That's right.
[02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:08.420]  And that's what General Pershing did in the Middle East
[02:45:08.420 --> 02:45:10.420]  in the First World War.
[02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:11.420]  When they came in,
[02:45:11.420 --> 02:45:14.420]  he just gathered all those Mullahs
[02:45:14.420 --> 02:45:16.420]  and he just basically machine gunned them down
[02:45:16.420 --> 02:45:18.420]  or made them force them to leave port.
[02:45:18.420 --> 02:45:21.420]  I mean, he put a stop to that quickly.
[02:45:21.420 --> 02:45:23.420]  And that was General Pershing during the First World War,
[02:45:23.420 --> 02:45:26.420]  especially when the Ottoman Church were massacring
[02:45:26.420 --> 02:45:29.420]  and butchering the Armenian Christians.
[02:45:29.420 --> 02:45:30.420]  That's right.
[02:45:30.420 --> 02:45:32.420]  Yeah, no, war's a nasty thing
[02:45:32.420 --> 02:45:33.420]  and the globalists don't want to win a war.
[02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:35.420]  They want to keep it going.
[02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:38.420]  That's right, because it's a trillion dollar money making.
[02:45:38.420 --> 02:45:40.420]  Well, let's be bottom line.
[02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:43.420]  Whoever runs the Israeli government,
[02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:44.420]  they're like, oh, support Israel,
[02:45:44.420 --> 02:45:45.420]  support their government.
[02:45:45.420 --> 02:45:48.420]  No, the Jews don't support their government like 65%.
[02:45:48.420 --> 02:45:51.420]  Whoever's over there is getting power out of this.
[02:45:51.420 --> 02:45:53.420]  That doesn't defend the Muslims or what they did.
[02:45:53.420 --> 02:45:55.420]  Let's just not be little kids here
[02:45:55.420 --> 02:45:57.420]  and let's admit they're getting power
[02:45:57.420 --> 02:46:00.420]  just like our government is out of it.
[02:46:00.420 --> 02:46:02.420]  Now, I'm going to confess,
[02:46:02.420 --> 02:46:03.420]  I'm going to make it known to the world
[02:46:03.420 --> 02:46:05.420]  that my mother's side were Sephardic,
[02:46:05.420 --> 02:46:07.420]  Jewish of Mexico, Spain,
[02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:11.420]  and Mediterranean, Italy and such,
[02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:12.420]  so I'm of mixed blood.
[02:46:12.420 --> 02:46:14.420]  But I'm Sephardic Jewish on my mother's side of the family,
[02:46:14.420 --> 02:46:16.420]  okay, where Salazar just narrows.
[02:46:16.420 --> 02:46:18.420]  Well, you know, under Jewish law,
[02:46:18.420 --> 02:46:20.420]  that makes you Jewish that your mother was.
[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:21.420]  That's right.
[02:46:21.420 --> 02:46:23.420]  Now, the thing about Bibi Netanyahu
[02:46:23.420 --> 02:46:25.420]  is that he's half and half.
[02:46:25.420 --> 02:46:28.420]  His father, I believe, is Sephardic
[02:46:28.420 --> 02:46:30.420]  and his mother is Ashkenazi.
[02:46:30.420 --> 02:46:32.420]  So he could go either way.
[02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:33.420]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:46:33.420 --> 02:46:34.420]  I've studied history.
[02:46:34.420 --> 02:46:35.420]  It's very interesting.
[02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:36.420]  I'm not getting into the Jews' business,
[02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:39.420]  but the Sephardics are 100% the real Jews.
[02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:41.420]  I don't give them the Khazars
[02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:46.420]  but you could debate all day
[02:46:46.420 --> 02:46:48.420]  whether Ashkenazi are real Jews or not.
[02:46:48.420 --> 02:46:52.420]  The point is the Sephardic are definitely the line of Judah.
[02:46:52.420 --> 02:46:54.420]  They are definitely the Jews.
[02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:56.420]  And so Aaron Russo was a great guy.
[02:46:56.420 --> 02:46:57.420]  He was a Sephardic Jew.
[02:46:57.420 --> 02:46:59.420]  And I love all the Sephardic Jews I know.
[02:46:59.420 --> 02:47:00.420]  I love everybody,
[02:47:00.420 --> 02:47:02.420]  but the people I really know
[02:47:02.420 --> 02:47:06.420]  that are really magical people are the Sephardic Jews.
[02:47:06.420 --> 02:47:10.420]  And obviously, I'm not attacking the Ashkenazi.
[02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:11.420]  They're really smart folks,
[02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:14.420]  like Dr. Zelenko was an Ashkenazi.
[02:47:14.420 --> 02:47:16.420]  Great guy, beautiful person,
[02:47:16.420 --> 02:47:18.420]  and that's what's so sad about this.
[02:47:18.420 --> 02:47:19.420]  I'm not an enemy of the Jews,
[02:47:19.420 --> 02:47:20.420]  but I'm not going to sit here
[02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:22.420]  and let politics say,
[02:47:22.420 --> 02:47:25.420]  turn your guns, give us your body,
[02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:26.420]  you're anti-Semitic.
[02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:28.420]  Open your borders or you're anti-Jews.
[02:47:28.420 --> 02:47:29.420]  I'm telling the Jews,
[02:47:29.420 --> 02:47:32.420]  stop letting politicians own you
[02:47:32.420 --> 02:47:34.420]  and claim that they represent you.
[02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:35.420]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:47:35.420 --> 02:47:38.420]  Yes, I totally agree with you, Alex.
[02:47:38.420 --> 02:47:41.420]  And I just want to just put this plug quickly.
[02:47:41.420 --> 02:47:43.420]  For the American people to know,
[02:47:45.420 --> 02:47:46.420]  I think they already know,
[02:47:46.420 --> 02:47:48.420]  that 90% of the Jews,
[02:47:48.420 --> 02:47:50.420]  professing Jews in Israel,
[02:47:50.420 --> 02:47:51.420]  90% are Sephardic,
[02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:53.420]  10% are Ashkenazi.
[02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:55.420]  It's the opposite here in the United States.
[02:47:55.420 --> 02:47:58.420]  90% are Ashkenazi and 10% are Sephardic.
[02:47:58.420 --> 02:47:59.420]  And it was the Sephardic Jews,
[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:02.420]  like Chaim Solomon, Aaron Lopez,
[02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:03.420]  who helped George Washington
[02:48:03.420 --> 02:48:05.420]  win the American Revolution.
[02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:07.420]  They were Sephardic Jews, not Ashkenazi.
[02:48:07.420 --> 02:48:09.420]  There is a...
[02:48:09.420 --> 02:48:11.420]  My ex-wife is...
[02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:13.420]  I mean, they were non-religious,
[02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:15.420]  so I didn't even really think about it,
[02:48:15.420 --> 02:48:17.420]  but she's Ashkenazi.
[02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:19.420]  And it's just the whole thing is just...
[02:48:19.420 --> 02:48:21.420]  And then the stupid-ass white supremacists
[02:48:21.420 --> 02:48:22.420]  attacked me for that.
[02:48:22.420 --> 02:48:23.420]  Like, I love everybody.
[02:48:23.420 --> 02:48:26.420]  And I just want to be peaceful and not do this.
[02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:27.420]  And I love everybody.
[02:48:27.420 --> 02:48:29.420]  I appreciate your call.
[02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:30.420]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:31.420]  David in Florida.
[02:48:31.420 --> 02:48:32.420]  You're on the air.
[02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:33.420]  Go ahead, David.
[02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:35.420]  Hey, Alex.
[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:37.420]  Let me say I sympathize with you.
[02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:39.420]  With what you were talking about earlier,
[02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:42.420]  there's unspeakable evil going on in this world,
[02:48:42.420 --> 02:48:43.420]  and it's hard.
[02:48:43.420 --> 02:48:44.420]  But if you give me some time,
[02:48:44.420 --> 02:48:46.420]  I just want to make three quick points here.
[02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:48.420]  First off, Jesus is King,
[02:48:48.420 --> 02:48:50.420]  and for God to love the world,
[02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:51.420]  that He gave His only begotten Son,
[02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:53.420]  that whoever believes in Him
[02:48:53.420 --> 02:48:55.420]  should not perish but have eternal life.
[02:48:55.420 --> 02:48:56.420]  So point one is,
[02:48:56.420 --> 02:48:59.420]  as Christians and believers of the Bible,
[02:48:59.420 --> 02:49:01.420]  looking at the New World Order,
[02:49:01.420 --> 02:49:02.420]  I want to say,
[02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:04.420]  how can we stop it,
[02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:06.420]  or why would we even want to?
[02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:09.420]  And I just think we should be looking for the Antichrist
[02:49:09.420 --> 02:49:11.420]  and watching for Jesus.
[02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:14.420]  Point two is, I'm looking at Turkey.
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:17.420]  You know, we're basically at Ukraine,
[02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:18.420]  we're in Israel,
[02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:21.420]  and once Turkey gets involved,
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:23.420]  there's going to be a solid divide there
[02:49:23.420 --> 02:49:24.420]  between the world,
[02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:26.420]  between Russia, China, North Korea,
[02:49:26.420 --> 02:49:29.420]  the Muslims, and us, Europe, and Israel.
[02:49:29.420 --> 02:49:32.420]  So I just want to say that
[02:49:32.420 --> 02:49:34.420]  that's an interesting spot
[02:49:34.420 --> 02:49:36.420]  to look at what's going on.
[02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:38.420]  We've already got reports of
[02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:40.420]  Israeli forces going into Lebanon,
[02:49:40.420 --> 02:49:41.420]  and it's crazy.
[02:49:41.420 --> 02:49:43.420]  The devil has this crazy plan.
[02:49:43.420 --> 02:49:45.420]  He's divided the whole world,
[02:49:45.420 --> 02:49:47.420]  simultaneously dividing all of our countries.
[02:49:48.420 --> 02:49:51.420]  So it's a recipe for disaster.
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:52.420]  And point three,
[02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:54.420]  I'm looking at how they're going to
[02:49:54.420 --> 02:49:56.420]  definitely need another terrorist attack.
[02:49:56.420 --> 02:49:57.420]  False flag.
[02:49:57.420 --> 02:50:00.420]  This is their playbook to get us into this war.
[02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:02.420]  And I'm looking at New York,
[02:50:02.420 --> 02:50:05.420]  and I'm reminded of 9-11.
[02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:08.420]  I feel like we're just going to see a 9-11 2.0.
[02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:10.420]  No, I totally agree with you,
[02:50:10.420 --> 02:50:12.420]  and I appreciate your call.
[02:50:12.420 --> 02:50:14.420]  And that's where we are right now.
[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:16.420]  And the governments are using
[02:50:16.420 --> 02:50:17.420]  all of us against each other.
[02:50:17.420 --> 02:50:19.420]  We have to be aware of this.
[02:50:19.420 --> 02:50:20.420]  We have to see this.
[02:50:20.420 --> 02:50:21.420]  We have to understand this,
[02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:23.420]  that powerful globalist forces
[02:50:23.420 --> 02:50:25.420]  want major wars,
[02:50:25.420 --> 02:50:27.420]  and so we should be against those wars.
[02:50:27.420 --> 02:50:29.420]  Now, clips on Twitter,
[02:50:29.420 --> 02:50:30.420]  it's like 30 seconds long,
[02:50:30.420 --> 02:50:33.420]  of myself in early August
[02:50:33.420 --> 02:50:35.420]  predicting attacks on Jews,
[02:50:35.420 --> 02:50:37.420]  because I could see the programming.
[02:50:37.420 --> 02:50:39.420]  So I asked the crew to find a longer clip.
[02:50:39.420 --> 02:50:40.420]  I haven't seen it yet.
[02:50:40.420 --> 02:50:41.420]  They grabbed the actual clip.
[02:50:41.420 --> 02:50:42.420]  The full 10-minute clip,
[02:50:42.420 --> 02:50:44.420]  the segment's going to be uploaded to Bandai Video.
[02:50:44.420 --> 02:50:46.420]  Alex shows predict attack on Israel.
[02:50:46.420 --> 02:50:47.420]  We'll get that up,
[02:50:47.420 --> 02:50:49.420]  but here's a short clip.
[02:50:49.420 --> 02:50:52.420]  We're selling human freedom
[02:50:52.420 --> 02:50:54.420]  and the future and transparency.
[02:50:54.420 --> 02:50:57.420]  That's very popular.
[02:50:57.420 --> 02:51:00.420]  And so we have to be ready
[02:51:00.420 --> 02:51:02.420]  when RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard
[02:51:02.420 --> 02:51:04.420]  and Russell Brand and Jimmy Dore
[02:51:04.420 --> 02:51:06.420]  and everybody else and Tim Dillon
[02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:08.420]  and all these other former liberals
[02:51:08.420 --> 02:51:09.420]  join us.
[02:51:09.420 --> 02:51:11.420]  It's because they finally figure out,
[02:51:11.420 --> 02:51:12.420]  wow, this is really evil.
[02:51:12.420 --> 02:51:14.420]  This is really destructive.
[02:51:14.420 --> 02:51:16.420]  This is really bad.
[02:51:16.420 --> 02:51:18.420]  And imagine having your firstborn son
[02:51:18.420 --> 02:51:23.420]  about to be castrated.
[02:51:23.420 --> 02:51:24.420]  That's the line, like,
[02:51:24.420 --> 02:51:26.420]  wait, I'm super powerful and I'm rich,
[02:51:26.420 --> 02:51:29.420]  but you've got my son?
[02:51:29.420 --> 02:51:30.420]  And a group of leftists
[02:51:30.420 --> 02:51:33.420]  have sucked him away in controlling?
[02:51:33.420 --> 02:51:34.420]  See, that's a bridge too far,
[02:51:34.420 --> 02:51:35.420]  and that's what I tell people
[02:51:35.420 --> 02:51:36.420]  that serve the system.
[02:51:36.420 --> 02:51:38.420]  Do you have to lose your son
[02:51:38.420 --> 02:51:40.420]  or your wife or your life
[02:51:40.420 --> 02:51:43.420]  until you break with the new world order?
[02:51:43.420 --> 02:51:45.420]  You can see it's getting dark, folks.
[02:51:45.420 --> 02:51:46.420]  It's bad.
[02:51:46.420 --> 02:51:47.420]  It smells.
[02:51:47.420 --> 02:51:48.420]  It stinks.
[02:51:48.420 --> 02:51:49.420]  You want to go deeper down this hole?
[02:51:49.420 --> 02:51:50.420]  The deeper we get,
[02:51:50.420 --> 02:51:51.420]  the more skeletons,
[02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:52.420]  the more crimes,
[02:51:52.420 --> 02:51:53.420]  the more evil.
[02:51:53.420 --> 02:51:54.420]  Let's turn back.
[02:51:54.420 --> 02:51:55.420]  Let's change direction.
[02:51:55.420 --> 02:51:59.420]  Let's get out of here.
[02:51:59.420 --> 02:52:01.420]  You know it in your gut.
[02:52:01.420 --> 02:52:02.420]  I know the general listeners know this,
[02:52:02.420 --> 02:52:04.420]  but I really care about the prodigal sons
[02:52:04.420 --> 02:52:05.420]  and daughters out there.
[02:52:05.420 --> 02:52:06.420]  I really care about the people
[02:52:06.420 --> 02:52:09.420]  that think they're part of the power structure
[02:52:09.420 --> 02:52:10.420]  and part of the elite
[02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:12.420]  and part of this big utopia you're building.
[02:52:12.420 --> 02:52:13.420]  You're not building a utopia.
[02:52:13.420 --> 02:52:15.420]  You're building a global collapse,
[02:52:15.420 --> 02:52:17.420]  at least 6 billion people to be killed.
[02:52:17.420 --> 02:52:18.420]  That's the conservative estimate.
[02:52:18.420 --> 02:52:20.420]  That's the official number the UN wants.
[02:52:20.420 --> 02:52:21.420]  Most of the internal estimates
[02:52:21.420 --> 02:52:23.420]  are going to have 500 million.
[02:52:23.420 --> 02:52:24.420]  You really think the globals
[02:52:24.420 --> 02:52:26.420]  are going to stop at 500 million
[02:52:26.420 --> 02:52:28.420]  after they've killed 7.5 billion?
[02:52:28.420 --> 02:52:30.420]  We're in the endgame.
[02:52:30.420 --> 02:52:31.420]  We're in Agenda 2030.
[02:52:31.420 --> 02:52:38.420]  We're in it, folks.
[02:52:38.420 --> 02:52:39.420]  We'll come back,
[02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:42.420]  and I'm going to get into the ADL stack.
[02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:43.420]  When I say ADL stack,
[02:52:43.420 --> 02:52:45.420]  it's the UN taking control.
[02:52:45.420 --> 02:52:47.420]  It's the WEF taking control of your speech.
[02:52:47.420 --> 02:52:48.420]  It's all the admitted censorship.
[02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:49.420]  It's all the control,
[02:52:49.420 --> 02:52:50.420]  and it's word for word
[02:52:50.420 --> 02:52:52.420]  what I've been saying the last week
[02:52:52.420 --> 02:52:54.420]  with these Nazi groups popping up
[02:52:54.420 --> 02:52:56.420]  that the ADLs are going to come out and say,
[02:52:56.420 --> 02:52:58.420]  those are Nazis about to kill Jews.
[02:52:58.420 --> 02:52:59.420]  You must silence everyone
[02:52:59.420 --> 02:53:00.420]  that opposes our agenda
[02:53:00.420 --> 02:53:02.420]  of surveillance and censorship,
[02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:03.420]  or you're going to kill Jews.
[02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:04.420]  Now, what's the next move?
[02:53:04.420 --> 02:53:07.420]  The false flag.
[02:53:07.420 --> 02:53:08.420]  If I was Jewish,
[02:53:08.420 --> 02:53:09.420]  I would not have my kids
[02:53:09.420 --> 02:53:11.420]  in any big synagogue or any big school.
[02:53:11.420 --> 02:53:13.420]  You're about to get hit,
[02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:16.420]  and I came back and covered more of it.
[02:53:16.420 --> 02:53:17.420]  You can track all those.
[02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:19.420]  It's so predictable.
[02:53:19.420 --> 02:53:20.420]  Let's jam in more calls.
[02:53:20.420 --> 02:53:21.420]  Flint in Chicago.
[02:53:21.420 --> 02:53:22.420]  You're on the air.
[02:53:22.420 --> 02:53:24.420]  Welcome.
[02:53:24.420 --> 02:53:25.420]  Hey, brother.
[02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:27.420]  Sick and tired of hearing
[02:53:27.420 --> 02:53:29.420]  about everybody else's border
[02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:31.420]  when our own politicians
[02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:33.420]  don't care about our own.
[02:53:33.420 --> 02:53:34.420]  I don't know where Gaza starts.
[02:53:34.420 --> 02:53:36.420]  I don't know where Israel starts
[02:53:36.420 --> 02:53:38.420]  or where it ends,
[02:53:38.420 --> 02:53:39.420]  or Ukraine or Russia,
[02:53:39.420 --> 02:53:41.420]  for that matter.
[02:53:41.420 --> 02:53:44.420]  But there's no leadership,
[02:53:44.420 --> 02:53:47.420]  plenty of taxpayer debt to spend
[02:53:47.420 --> 02:53:49.420]  to decrease the value of the dollar
[02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:51.420]  even further.
[02:53:51.420 --> 02:53:53.420]  I mean, the Democrats break stuff
[02:53:53.420 --> 02:53:56.420]  just to come up with more solutions
[02:53:56.420 --> 02:53:57.420]  for taxpayer debt
[02:53:57.420 --> 02:53:58.420]  to fix what they broke
[02:53:58.420 --> 02:54:00.420]  in the first place.
[02:54:00.420 --> 02:54:02.420]  You just boiled them down.
[02:54:02.420 --> 02:54:03.420]  I'll give you a few minutes
[02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:04.420]  to finish up.
[02:54:04.420 --> 02:54:05.420]  But, yeah, they break stuff
[02:54:05.420 --> 02:54:08.420]  to then get money to fix it.
[02:54:08.420 --> 02:54:12.420]  Yeah, it's just a merry-go-round
[02:54:12.420 --> 02:54:14.420]  of insanity.
[02:54:14.420 --> 02:54:17.420]  And, you know, I got caught up
[02:54:17.420 --> 02:54:19.420]  in the 9-11 stuff.
[02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:20.420]  Yeah, we get, you know,
[02:54:20.420 --> 02:54:22.420]  I don't know exactly what happened.
[02:54:22.420 --> 02:54:23.420]  I don't claim to be an expert on it.
[02:54:23.420 --> 02:54:25.420]  But, you know, I got riled up.
[02:54:25.420 --> 02:54:26.420]  I wanted to, you know,
[02:54:26.420 --> 02:54:29.420]  go bomb them, go level, you know,
[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:31.420]  Afghanistan.
[02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:33.420]  I cannot fall into that trap again.
[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:34.420]  I've spent so much time
[02:54:34.420 --> 02:54:36.420]  hating other people
[02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:38.420]  that I just give up.
[02:54:38.420 --> 02:54:41.420]  I look out my window every morning
[02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:42.420]  and I say,
[02:54:42.420 --> 02:54:43.420]  okay, I don't have anyone
[02:54:43.420 --> 02:54:45.420]  attacking my house at this moment.
[02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:47.420]  No, I'm in the same place.
[02:54:47.420 --> 02:54:49.420]  I love everybody, exactly.
[02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:51.420]  But I see the manipulation
[02:54:51.420 --> 02:54:52.420]  and people come to attack us.
[02:54:52.420 --> 02:54:54.420]  Our whole media says
[02:54:54.420 --> 02:54:55.420]  white people are inherently bad.
[02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:57.420]  And the ADL runs that.
[02:54:57.420 --> 02:54:58.420]  That's why I said
[02:54:58.420 --> 02:54:59.420]  they're the most Nazi thing I've seen.
[02:54:59.420 --> 02:55:00.420]  The Nazis were race-based.
[02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:02.420]  The ADL is race-based.
[02:55:02.420 --> 02:55:04.420]  The Nazis go crazy.
[02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:06.420]  Lizzie Jones claims the ADL are Nazis.
[02:55:06.420 --> 02:55:08.420]  No, I'm saying
[02:55:08.420 --> 02:55:12.420]  the most Nazi ideology of race-based
[02:55:12.420 --> 02:55:13.420]  is the left
[02:55:13.420 --> 02:55:15.420]  saying being white or Christian
[02:55:15.420 --> 02:55:17.420]  is inherently bad.
[02:55:17.420 --> 02:55:19.420]  That's race-based politics.
[02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:20.420]  That's Nazi.
[02:55:20.420 --> 02:55:21.420]  They're not Nazis.
[02:55:21.420 --> 02:55:22.420]  I'm saying
[02:55:22.420 --> 02:55:23.420]  they're the closest thing
[02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:26.420]  to Nazis I've ever seen.
[02:55:26.420 --> 02:55:28.420]  Where did this brainwashing occur?
[02:55:28.420 --> 02:55:30.420]  I mean, it's been over time.
[02:55:30.420 --> 02:55:32.420]  If you look at every commercial,
[02:55:32.420 --> 02:55:34.420]  who's the stupidest person in the room?
[02:55:34.420 --> 02:55:36.420]  It's the white male.
[02:55:36.420 --> 02:55:38.420]  And who's the brunt of all the jokes?
[02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:39.420]  Yeah, and all I say is
[02:55:39.420 --> 02:55:40.420]  who runs Hollywood
[02:55:40.420 --> 02:55:42.420]  and why are you doing this to me?
[02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:44.420]  I've supported you.
[02:55:44.420 --> 02:55:45.420]  I've been nice to you.
[02:55:45.420 --> 02:55:46.420]  Why are you doing this to me?
[02:55:46.420 --> 02:55:48.420]  Stop it.
[02:55:48.420 --> 02:55:50.420]  Well, God bless you, Alex.
[02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:51.420]  I love you.
[02:55:51.420 --> 02:55:52.420]  I love you, too.
[02:55:52.420 --> 02:55:53.420]  Anything else, brother?
[02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:55.420]  No, that's it.
[02:55:55.420 --> 02:55:58.420]  I'm just unbelievably frustrated.
[02:55:59.420 --> 02:56:02.420]  I'm living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:03.420]  I've got to deal with
[02:56:03.420 --> 02:56:06.420]  every damn problem of everybody else.
[02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:07.420]  No, I hear you.
[02:56:07.420 --> 02:56:09.420]  I'm not like...
[02:56:09.420 --> 02:56:11.420]  I'm asking Hollywood,
[02:56:11.420 --> 02:56:12.420]  why do you destroy yourself?
[02:56:12.420 --> 02:56:13.420]  Why do you attack the people
[02:56:13.420 --> 02:56:15.420]  that are nice?
[02:56:15.420 --> 02:56:17.420]  Because we are nice.
[02:56:17.420 --> 02:56:18.420]  And the fact is,
[02:56:18.420 --> 02:56:20.420]  the left knows
[02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:22.420]  whether they're a Jewish leftist organization
[02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:24.420]  or a black radical organization
[02:56:24.420 --> 02:56:25.420]  or a Palestinian organization,
[02:56:25.420 --> 02:56:27.420]  they know white Christians
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:29.420]  are open and sweet and good.
[02:56:29.420 --> 02:56:30.420]  We're like the right whale.
[02:56:30.420 --> 02:56:32.420]  Why did everybody kill humpback whales?
[02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:33.420]  Because they were sweet and nice
[02:56:33.420 --> 02:56:35.420]  and didn't run from the harpoon boats.
[02:56:35.420 --> 02:56:37.420]  And we don't run from harpoon boats.
[02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:38.420]  We're like, oh, we want to love you.
[02:56:38.420 --> 02:56:39.420]  We're...
[02:56:42.420 --> 02:56:45.420]  And it's like, you know...
[02:56:45.420 --> 02:56:47.420]  So, I'm done.
[02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:49.420]  I'm done being nice.
[02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:52.420]  I mean, the ADL says I'm a Nazi.
[02:56:52.420 --> 02:56:54.420]  Even though they support real Nazis
[02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:56.420]  like George Soros.
[02:56:56.420 --> 02:56:57.420]  At a certain point, I'm like,
[02:56:57.420 --> 02:56:58.420]  no, I'm not a Nazi,
[02:56:58.420 --> 02:56:59.420]  but I'm not your slave.
[02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:01.420]  And I'm not going to take your crap.
[02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:03.420]  I didn't do nothing to you.
[02:57:03.420 --> 02:57:05.420]  I'm a good person.
[02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:07.420]  And I care about people.
[02:57:07.420 --> 02:57:10.420]  And I'm not going to take your lies.
[02:57:10.420 --> 02:57:12.420]  And I'm not going to be your villain.
[02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:13.420]  You're the villain.
[02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:14.420]  You're a bad person.
[02:57:14.420 --> 02:57:15.420]  You are bad.
[02:57:15.420 --> 02:57:16.420]  Not me.
[02:57:16.420 --> 02:57:18.420]  You are bad.
[02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:19.420]  You are bad.
[02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:20.420]  Doesn't mean I go sign on
[02:57:20.420 --> 02:57:21.420]  with the Islamists
[02:57:21.420 --> 02:57:22.420]  who are even worse.
[02:57:22.420 --> 02:57:24.420]  But that's all you got?
[02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:26.420]  Okay, so you're better than them?
[02:57:26.420 --> 02:57:27.420]  I want to see Jews
[02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:29.420]  come out against the ADL.
[02:57:29.420 --> 02:57:30.420]  And they are.
[02:57:30.420 --> 02:57:32.420]  I want to see more of it right now.
[02:57:32.420 --> 02:57:34.420]  Because I'm your friend.
[02:57:34.420 --> 02:57:35.420]  And we're being set up
[02:57:35.420 --> 02:57:36.420]  like World War II.
[02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:37.420]  Alright, we're going to start
[02:57:37.420 --> 02:57:38.420]  the next hour.
[02:57:38.420 --> 02:57:39.420]  Jay Dyer's coming up.
[02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:40.420]  I'm going to finish up
[02:57:40.420 --> 02:57:41.420]  with Peter, Jeff, and Caleb
[02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:44.420]  before he takes over InfoWars.com.
[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:51.600]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[02:57:51.600 --> 02:57:55.600]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:58:00.600]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:02.600]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[02:58:02.600 --> 02:58:07.600]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world.
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:11.600]  An alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:17.600]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:21.600]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:24.600]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:28.600]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:59:09.600 --> 02:59:14.600]  Right to the top with these 95% cucuminoids.
[02:59:14.600 --> 02:59:19.600]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:21.600]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[02:59:21.600 --> 02:59:25.600]  This is 95%.
[02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:30.600]  Super constant, so like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:32.600]  It's that powerful.
[02:59:32.600 --> 02:59:33.600]  Or more.
[02:59:33.600 --> 02:59:36.600]  So they're available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:39.600]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:59:39.600 --> 02:59:40.600]  Hold off for almost 8 months.
[02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:47.600]  Back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:50.600 --> 02:59:55.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:05.600]  America is special.
[03:00:05.600 --> 03:00:08.600]  Everybody wanted to come here because of the idea of freedom.
[03:00:08.600 --> 03:00:10.600]  And we deliver more than any other nation.
[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:13.600]  So let's stop being guilty about America.
[03:00:13.600 --> 03:00:16.600]  Whether you're black or you're white or you're brown.
[03:00:16.600 --> 03:00:18.600]  If you love freedom, I love you.
[03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:21.600]  You can be Jewish, you can be Muslim, you can be Christian or Hindu.
[03:00:21.600 --> 03:00:24.600]  If you love freedom, I stand with you.
[03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:30.600]  But I will not sit here and be accused of being a bad person because of what color I am anymore.
[03:00:30.600 --> 03:00:36.600]  And I will tell the left, whether it's a black leftist, a white leftist, a Christian leftist, a Jewish leftist, a Muslim leftist,
[03:00:36.600 --> 03:00:38.600]  that I've got to bow down to prove I'm not bad.
[03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:41.600]  Stop bowing to the left is the bottom line.
[03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:46.800]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:48.800]  All right, let's go to Peter in Ohio.
[03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:50.800]  Peter, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:00:52.800]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call today.
[03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:54.800]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:58.800]  Um, I just, I've kind of given up at this point.
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:02.800]  I don't think that the government's ever going to do anything that I need it to do.
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:04.800]  Especially the federal government.
[03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:09.800]  So, I'm just waiting for them to invade my house, and that's what I'm preparing for.
[03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:11.800]  I don't think Trump's going to get elected.
[03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:17.800]  I don't think the people who are running our federal government in the House and the Senate are doing anything.
[03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:23.800]  It just, it doesn't seem to be a country.
[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:25.800]  No, you're right.
[03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:29.800]  A nation is a rule of law and a social contract.
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:31.800]  And a social contract is broken.
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:34.800]  But Klaus Schwab wants to break it to make us blame the government.
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:37.800]  The government's got problems, it's a representation of us.
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:40.800]  But it's not our government, it's the hijackers of it.
[03:01:40.800 --> 03:01:42.800]  That's why they say I'm anti-government, they're liars.
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:44.800]  Does that make sense?
[03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:47.800]  Well, I've seen the liars continuously.
[03:01:47.800 --> 03:01:49.800]  That's been my main issue.
[03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:53.800]  I mean, these are the people that took away my job with COVID.
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:02:01.800]  I don't see anything that they've said that has ever come to fruition in the years that I've been watching this.
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:05.800]  And I just appreciate you being at the point of the spear, giving me information.
[03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:08.800]  But I just don't have a lot of hope at this point.
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:10.800]  It just doesn't look like.
[03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:13.800]  I'm too small, and it's too big.
[03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:17.800]  Brother, I know that feeling of being overwhelmed, that's why we got God.
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:21.800]  But it's disgusting, and it's a problem, and I hear you.
[03:02:21.800 --> 03:02:22.800]  Anything else?
[03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:24.800]  You wanted to say winning the war, Peter.
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:25.800]  What was it?
[03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:27.800]  Which war is that?
[03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:28.800]  Sorry?
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:31.800]  I saw on your call thing, it says winning the war.
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:36.800]  Oh, no, I don't think so.
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:37.800]  All right, I hear you.
[03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:38.800]  It's very depressing.
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:39.800]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:42.800]  All right, Caleb in Kentucky, then Jay Dyer, who is incredible.
[03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:44.800]  His research is amazing.
[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:45.800]  Goes right off their own documents.
[03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:46.800]  It's coming up.
[03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:48.800]  Caleb in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:50.800]  What's up?
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:51.800]  I was in Kentucky yesterday.
[03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:54.800]  My plane was broken down, but I'm here now.
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:02:55.800]  Really?
[03:02:55.800 --> 03:02:56.800]  That's awesome.
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:02:59.800]  So I have a question for you.
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:03.800]  I know with all the Israel stuff going on, people are beating the bandwagon to get Trump
[03:03:03.800 --> 03:03:06.800]  back in office and that Trump could stop this.
[03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:10.800]  My question is, at what point do we stop trusting Trump?
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:15.800]  Just in the past two months, he's told us we need to listen to Lindsey Graham, who's
[03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:20.800]  now calling for us to bomb Iran, and he's told us that his vaccine saved millions of
[03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:26.800]  lives, even though we know it killed, at the very minimum, hundreds of thousands of lives.
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:29.800]  At what point do we stop trusting Trump?
[03:03:29.800 --> 03:03:32.800]  Did he call for attacking Iran?
[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:33.800]  I missed that.
[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:37.800]  I believe it was Lindsey Graham who was calling for attacking Iran.
[03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:39.800]  Oh, you said Trump was calling for that?
[03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:40.800]  No, no, no, no.
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:43.800]  Trump has told us to back Lindsey Graham.
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:47.800]  He's told his supporters that we need to listen to Lindsey Graham and back Lindsey Graham.
[03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:50.800]  And Lindsey Graham, as always, is beating his wardrobe.
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:54.800]  Well, I'm not for war with Iran, so I'm going to investigate what you're saying.
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:56.800]  Yeah, no, Trump's not perfect behind the yardstick.
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:03:58.800]  So is Joe Biden better?
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:03:59.800]  Who would you support?
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:00.800]  No, definitely not.
[03:04:00.800 --> 03:04:08.800]  But my point is, it seems like Trump is almost in bed with the same people because he's backed
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:09.800]  the vaccine.
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:11.800]  He backed the lockdown.
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:15.800]  He's told us that the vaccine saved millions of people, even though all of us know people
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:18.800]  who dropped dead at work from the vaccine.
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:19.800]  No, I hear you.
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:21.800]  The vaccine, I'm a big critic of Trump about that.
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:24.800]  And so that's why I'm almost apoplectic.
[03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:27.800]  I'm just like, at this point.
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:28.800]  I hear you.
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:29.800]  I hear you.
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:30.800]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:31.800]  All right.
[03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:32.800]  Jay Dyer is about to take over.
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:33.800]  I'll introduce him next segment.
[03:04:33.800 --> 03:04:34.800]  Back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:40.800]  Owen Schroer in 56 Minutes goes live, 3 p.m. Central, The War Room.
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:47.800]  He reports to federal prison coming up in like 14, less than 12 days from now.
[03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:48.800]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:49.800]  Stay with us.
[03:04:52.800 --> 03:04:53.800]  Bye.
[03:04:53.800 --> 03:04:54.800]  Bye.

[03:06:07.400 --> 03:06:11.400]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:11.400 --> 03:06:14.400]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:19.400]  Alright, when I say Jay Dyer is a smart cookie, I don't miss his show any Friday.
[03:06:19.400 --> 03:06:21.400]  So I want to cut it this time.
[03:06:21.400 --> 03:06:23.400]  This guy, I've read hundreds of gloveless books.
[03:06:23.400 --> 03:06:26.400]  This guy's read 500 books, more than I have.
[03:06:26.400 --> 03:06:31.400]  And so when you hear him, it is almost neurotic that he only tells you their words.
[03:06:31.400 --> 03:06:36.400]  This is going to be such an important hour with Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis,
[03:06:36.400 --> 03:06:38.400]  best-selling author, researcher right now.
[03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:40.400]  But I got to fund our operation.
[03:06:40.400 --> 03:06:42.400]  And let me tell you the great news.
[03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:45.400]  We're having fabulous sales right now.
[03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:48.400]  We are just blowing.
[03:06:48.400 --> 03:06:51.400]  Massive money's coming in.
[03:06:51.400 --> 03:06:54.400]  Except we only market products 100%.
[03:06:54.400 --> 03:06:58.400]  Most supplements are 300%, 400%.
[03:06:58.400 --> 03:07:07.400]  So when we do 50% off on DNA Force+, or Real Red Pill+, or Brain Force+,
[03:07:08.400 --> 03:07:12.400]  we're making like $5, $10 depending on the product.
[03:07:12.400 --> 03:07:15.400]  So yeah, we're bringing a lot of money.
[03:07:15.400 --> 03:07:17.400]  But it's all going to go back to buy the product.
[03:07:17.400 --> 03:07:21.400]  These are, I literally had this weekend, and I'll get to it later,
[03:07:21.400 --> 03:07:24.400]  a top talk show host asked me, are these products real?
[03:07:24.400 --> 03:07:31.400]  And I said, do you think PQQ or CoQ10 or 95% curcuminoid is real?
[03:07:31.400 --> 03:07:36.400]  I mean, I would rather burn in hell than lie to you about a product.
[03:07:36.400 --> 03:07:39.400]  Yes, all our products are incredible.
[03:07:39.400 --> 03:07:49.400]  Our atomic iodine is so good that we can't make it and sell it.
[03:07:49.400 --> 03:07:51.400]  It's been gone for a year.
[03:07:51.400 --> 03:07:55.400]  You have to have a DEA license.
[03:07:55.400 --> 03:07:57.400]  One company would do it.
[03:07:57.400 --> 03:08:00.400]  They told us a year ago, they said, you're Alex Jones.
[03:08:00.400 --> 03:08:02.400]  We're done after 10 years.
[03:08:02.400 --> 03:08:05.400]  We're not going to make it for you.
[03:08:05.400 --> 03:08:08.400]  They have to have a vault and a DEA license,
[03:08:08.400 --> 03:08:11.400]  because you can do all sorts of stuff with pure iodine.
[03:08:11.400 --> 03:08:13.400]  And we got another big company with a DEA license to do it.
[03:08:13.400 --> 03:08:16.400]  They have been trying with the patents to make it.
[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:18.400]  They can't make it.
[03:08:18.400 --> 03:08:25.400]  They finally think after like 10 months of trying to do it, they may have it.
[03:08:25.400 --> 03:08:28.400]  I can tell you I have the ultimate iodine and just lie to you.
[03:08:28.400 --> 03:08:33.400]  We have the only DEA approved true atomic iodine.
[03:08:33.400 --> 03:08:34.400]  Charles calls it that.
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:37.400]  Iodine is bound to other forms, other elements.
[03:08:37.400 --> 03:08:39.400]  It doesn't work.
[03:08:39.400 --> 03:08:44.400]  It goes right in you.
[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:45.400]  It's been a year.
[03:08:45.400 --> 03:08:48.400]  We haven't had it, because it's real.
[03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:50.400]  They think they finally cracked it.
[03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:52.400]  FDA tested.
[03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:53.400]  It's not even here yet.
[03:08:53.400 --> 03:08:57.400]  My point is, is that this is amazing.
[03:08:57.400 --> 03:09:02.400]  DNA Force Plus, Real Red Bull Plus, Brain Force Plus.
[03:09:02.400 --> 03:09:04.400]  60% off right now on Brain Force Plus.
[03:09:04.400 --> 03:09:05.400]  Flash sale.
[03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:07.400]  That's how we fund the operation.
[03:09:07.400 --> 03:09:11.400]  But it's like so frustrating to know this stuff really works.
[03:09:11.400 --> 03:09:12.400]  It's incredible.
[03:09:12.400 --> 03:09:14.400]  And it funds the operation.
[03:09:14.400 --> 03:09:16.400]  I can ask for pure donations.
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:17.400]  I need funds.
[03:09:17.400 --> 03:09:20.400]  Right now we're doing our bankruptcy budgeting.
[03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:21.400]  You thought it would be shut down a year ago.
[03:09:21.400 --> 03:09:22.400]  It's about to pass.
[03:09:22.400 --> 03:09:24.400]  The word is it's going to go through.
[03:09:24.400 --> 03:09:25.400]  Free speech will stay on the air.
[03:09:25.400 --> 03:09:26.400]  M4s will stay on the air.
[03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:27.400]  But we need money.
[03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:30.400]  Plus, you need Real Red Bull Plus.
[03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:33.400]  You need Brain Force Plus, 60% off.
[03:09:33.400 --> 03:09:36.400]  You need DNA Force Plus, 50% off.
[03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:39.400]  These are incredible products.
[03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:43.400]  Go to m4store.com right now.
[03:09:43.400 --> 03:09:46.400]  Because here's the paradox.
[03:09:46.400 --> 03:09:48.400]  We'll skip this break so Jay has more time.
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:49.400]  And the next network break.
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:52.400]  At 15 after, 45 after, 47.
[03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:56.400]  These products are game changing.
[03:09:56.400 --> 03:09:58.400]  And they've changed the world.
[03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:03.400]  And the information changes the world.
[03:10:03.400 --> 03:10:07.400]  So right now we're doing budgets.
[03:10:07.400 --> 03:10:11.400]  When I leave here in five minutes, I'll be totally technical.
[03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:12.400]  I'm going to go take a piss.
[03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:14.400]  I got a sandwich waiting.
[03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:15.400]  I haven't eaten.
[03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:16.400]  I've been up since 5 a.m.
[03:10:16.400 --> 03:10:20.400]  I had like one taco at like 10 a.m.
[03:10:20.400 --> 03:10:22.400]  I'm going to go eat my lunch.
[03:10:22.400 --> 03:10:24.400]  I'm going to walk over there in the business office.
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:26.400]  I'm going to try to figure out how to fund this operation.
[03:10:27.400 --> 03:10:31.400]  And it is these products that are doing it.
[03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:42.400]  And we are selling out of Real Red Pill Plus, DNA Force Plus, and Rain Force Plus.
[03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:45.400]  But despite that, we're like, well, if you're selling out, why are you selling it?
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:49.400]  Because we need the money now.
[03:10:49.400 --> 03:10:51.400]  So these are great deals.
[03:10:51.400 --> 03:10:57.400]  InfoWarsTore.com, my new book, The Great Awakening, books, films, T-shirts, everything.
[03:10:57.400 --> 03:11:00.400]  I need you to realize we're not just another show.
[03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:01.400]  I know there's a million shows.
[03:11:01.400 --> 03:11:03.400]  This is the show they're scared of.
[03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:04.400]  We need your support now.
[03:11:04.400 --> 03:11:12.400]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsTore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:18.400]  Now, the amazing Jay Dyer, and skip both network breaks to get his time back, takes over.
[03:11:19.400 --> 03:11:20.400]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:27.400]  Yeah, I think it's helpful in the confusion and the madness of all of what's going on recently
[03:11:27.400 --> 03:11:35.400]  to step back and try to learn the big picture, the history of the present Israel-Palestine conflict.
[03:11:35.400 --> 03:11:40.400]  And to know this, to understand this, you really have to go back to the time of the British Empire.
[03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:46.400]  And if we understand that, then we'll have a better understanding of both sides of the issue
[03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:56.400]  and what each side, both Israel and Palestine, have as their legitimate disagreements and their complaints.
[03:11:56.400 --> 03:12:02.400]  The media, and I think the world would like this, the elites would like this to be an either-or situation
[03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:11.400]  where you immediately take a side and then get caught up in the issue of the time as part of dialectical manipulation.
[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:14.400]  And I think there is precedent for that.
[03:12:14.400 --> 03:12:19.400]  There's a lot of reasons to believe that it could actually spark a bigger world war.
[03:12:19.400 --> 03:12:21.400]  We could be going into World War III.
[03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:28.400]  And a lot of analysts, a lot of people have been thinking that, like Alex said earlier,
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:36.400]  it would be conflicts like Russia and Ukraine, like China and Taiwan, and like perhaps North Korea
[03:12:36.400 --> 03:12:44.400]  or perhaps even in the Middle East that would contribute to this larger World War III.
[03:12:44.400 --> 03:12:47.400]  So how do we understand the history of this? How does this actually help us?
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:54.400]  Well, we have to go back to the British Empire and what we call in many of our lectures the Milner-Fabian Circle.
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:59.400]  That's the circles that were running the British Empire under the mandate of Cecil Rhodes,
[03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:04.400]  who sets up the secret society, the Society of the Elect, according to Dr. Carroll Quigley,
[03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:07.400]  that would run the inner party of the British Empire.
[03:13:07.400 --> 03:13:13.400]  They would have as their outer core several thousand academics from Oxford, Cambridge,
[03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:19.400]  and then Eastern U.S. establishment elites that would all make up together the Anglo-Americanist establishment.
[03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:25.400]  And it's true that in the background, a big player in this was Lord Rothschild himself.
[03:13:25.400 --> 03:13:31.400]  He was the one that was really sort of setting the policy for what Milner would do
[03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:39.400]  and what Cecil Rhodes would do when they set up this inner structure of the British Empire.
[03:13:39.400 --> 03:13:46.400]  And they had an idea for the Middle East that was not actually completely Zionist.
[03:13:46.400 --> 03:13:52.400]  A lot of people think that because Lord Balfour was really working as Lord Rothschild's representative
[03:13:52.400 --> 03:13:56.400]  to set up the Balfour Declaration to help create the nation-state of Israel,
[03:13:56.400 --> 03:13:59.400]  that this was completely one-sided.
[03:13:59.400 --> 03:14:02.400]  But actually, if you look at what Quigley says about this,
[03:14:02.400 --> 03:14:07.400]  this was a British imperial strategy of partitioning to control the region
[03:14:07.400 --> 03:14:12.400]  and to have kind of a managed powder keg, so to speak, at least originally.
[03:14:12.400 --> 03:14:19.400]  Originally, the British thought we will have this as an outpost of the Anglo-American establishment and its empire.
[03:14:19.400 --> 03:14:25.400]  Imperial geopolitics demands that you divide and conquer in all of these regions.
[03:14:25.400 --> 03:14:29.400]  You go back to Caesar. You go back to the ancient empires.
[03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:32.400]  This was a strategy of how you ruled all of the different dominions,
[03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:38.400]  is that you would keep managed conflicts and managed splits, partitions in those regions.
[03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:42.400]  That way, no one could ever align against the ruling elite.
[03:14:42.400 --> 03:14:45.400]  And this has worked very well for millennia.
[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:48.400]  Humans are very easily ruled in this way.
[03:14:48.400 --> 03:14:55.400]  And because they don't consider even the possibility of higher-level strategists and elites ruling them in this way,
[03:14:55.400 --> 03:15:01.400]  they fall prey to being trapped in a very dialectical either or tribalist type of view.
[03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:06.400]  And unfortunately, in the Middle East, the tribalism is in the extreme.
[03:15:06.400 --> 03:15:13.400]  In fact, the British Empire had many famous Arabists who themselves became enamored with Islam.
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:20.400]  And so it is wrong to think that the totality of the British power structure was completely aligned with or was totally pro-Zionist.
[03:15:20.400 --> 03:15:24.400]  In fact, there was a giant portion of the British elite, even to this day still,
[03:15:24.400 --> 03:15:31.400]  who are very pro-Arab and have a fascination with Islam and Arabic culture.
[03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:36.400]  In fact, King Charles himself was at one point inducted into a Sufi mystical order
[03:15:36.400 --> 03:15:44.400]  and has had a long-time fascination with Islam to the degree that many think he might be even a covert Muslim convert.
[03:15:44.400 --> 03:15:49.400]  Now, to be fair, in terms of King Charles, he's also done similar things with all the religions.
[03:15:49.400 --> 03:15:53.400]  So he seems to be a kind of a perennialist more so than a Muslim.
[03:15:53.400 --> 03:15:56.400]  But Sufism actually fits very well with perennialism.
[03:15:56.400 --> 03:15:59.400]  So if we go back to what Dr. Carroll Quigley says,
[03:15:59.400 --> 03:16:05.400]  writing from the archives of the Council on Foreign Relations and the elite in their own history of the 20th century,
[03:16:05.400 --> 03:16:10.400]  he gives us a lot of big bird's-eye-view, God's-eye-view perspective here,
[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:14.400]  where he says that the origins of the mandate system of the British Empire
[03:16:14.400 --> 03:16:17.400]  were largely the results of the Milner Group, the Milner Society.
[03:16:17.400 --> 03:16:20.400]  What have I been talking about this whole time?
[03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:26.400]  He says that Palestine, this mandate applied to them as well as all the other mandates.
[03:16:26.400 --> 03:16:32.400]  Palestine, however, had a particular position among the mandates because of the Balfour Declaration of 1917,
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:37.400]  which states that Britain would regard with favor the establishment of a national home for the Jews in Palestine.
[03:16:37.400 --> 03:16:42.400]  This declaration, which is known as Balfour, should rather be called the Milner Declaration,
[03:16:42.400 --> 03:16:47.400]  as it was Lord Milner and Lord Rothschild that were the real architects of this policy.
[03:16:47.400 --> 03:16:51.400]  This was not made public, however, until 1937.
[03:16:51.400 --> 03:16:55.400]  And then he goes on to say that this draft was drawn up,
[03:16:55.400 --> 03:17:00.400]  and the support for the British Empire here for this partition,
[03:17:00.400 --> 03:17:04.400]  they thought would be of a tremendous advantage in the Middle East.
[03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:08.400]  And so initially this seemed to work.
[03:17:08.400 --> 03:17:13.400]  However, there was opposition as the Labor Party that came into power soon after that
[03:17:13.400 --> 03:17:19.400]  then would not allow any Jews to, or very few Jews, to actually go to Palestine.
[03:17:19.400 --> 03:17:23.400]  And so this notion of an outpost was not working very well
[03:17:23.400 --> 03:17:28.400]  because obviously this fostered a lot of contention with putting Jews into the region
[03:17:28.400 --> 03:17:31.400]  when there was existing Arab populations.
[03:17:31.400 --> 03:17:35.400]  And so the British elite were kind of split amongst themselves as to whether to favor the Arabs
[03:17:35.400 --> 03:17:40.400]  or whether to favor the Jews in this region.
[03:17:40.400 --> 03:17:46.400]  At that time, the Jewish local government or control structure was known as the Jewish Agency,
[03:17:46.400 --> 03:17:50.400]  and they were getting more and more tired of the British rule.
[03:17:50.400 --> 03:17:57.400]  And so eventually what happens is they decide that they would like to be independent of British rule.
[03:17:57.400 --> 03:18:04.400]  And so there's an interesting article in the history of this that I wanted to reference.
[03:18:04.400 --> 03:18:11.400]  This is in a public academic text from The Conversation, which is a public academic site.
[03:18:11.400 --> 03:18:14.400]  It's not controversial. It's just talking about the history of Britain
[03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:17.400]  and their relationship to the founding of Israel.
[03:18:17.400 --> 03:18:23.400]  And it notes that before they were Israel, the Jewish community of Palestine, known as the Yishuv,
[03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:26.400]  had been Britain's closest junior partner.
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:32.400]  A dispute over British restrictions on Jewish immigration into Palestine began in 1939,
[03:18:32.400 --> 03:18:37.400]  and that was the result of the Labour Party's decision to limit that immigration.
[03:18:37.400 --> 03:18:44.400]  And the reason for that, I think, is that the Labour Party was always very close to the Fabian Socialist movement,
[03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:48.400]  and the Fabian Socialists were always opposed to any forms of nationalism,
[03:18:48.400 --> 03:18:55.400]  and they would have been thus against Jewish nationalism or against any people group having a nationality
[03:18:55.400 --> 03:18:59.400]  because they were international socialists ultimately in their orientation,
[03:18:59.400 --> 03:19:06.400]  even though they had a progressive approach to the implementation of Marxism, Communism and Socialism.
[03:19:06.400 --> 03:19:13.400]  So then what happens is, with the rise of Hitler, which was actually fostered and funded
[03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:18.400]  by the same elite power structure in the West that is funding and aiding the Communists,
[03:19:18.400 --> 03:19:23.400]  and I'm going to read from Quigley's famous text here, Tragedy and Hope.
[03:19:23.400 --> 03:19:28.400]  He has a great section on 1059 where he says that by the summer of 1953,
[03:19:28.400 --> 03:19:31.400]  almost irresistible forces were building up against Mosaddegh.
[03:19:31.400 --> 03:19:36.400]  This is in regard to Iran and the overthrow of Mohammad Mosaddegh by the CIA.
[03:19:36.400 --> 03:19:39.400]  The lack of Soviet interference gave the West full freedom of action.
[03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:44.400]  The British and the Anglo-Iranian oil company, which would later become BP,
[03:19:44.400 --> 03:19:49.400]  the World Petroleum Cartel and the American government and the older Iranian elite led by the Shah
[03:19:49.400 --> 03:19:51.400]  combined to crush Mosaddegh.
[03:19:51.400 --> 03:19:56.400]  The chief effort for this came from the American intelligence agency, the CIA,
[03:19:56.400 --> 03:20:02.400]  under the personal direction of its director, Alan Dulles, the brother of Secretary of State.
[03:20:02.400 --> 03:20:05.400]  Dulles was the former director of Schroeder Bank in New York.
[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:11.400]  He was the old associate of Frank Tiark's, partner of the Schroeder Bank in London of 1902,
[03:20:11.400 --> 03:20:14.400]  the director of the Bank of England from 1912 to 1945,
[03:20:14.400 --> 03:20:19.400]  as well as Lazar Brothers Bank and the Anglo-Iranian oil company.
[03:20:19.400 --> 03:20:25.400]  It will be recalled that Schroeder Bank in Cologne is who helped to arrange Hitler's accession to power.
[03:20:25.400 --> 03:20:33.400]  Not only that, in Quigley's two chapters on Britain's dual appeasement strategy,
[03:20:33.400 --> 03:20:40.400]  the British were secretly at a pact with Hitler telling him that they would support him if he invaded Poland
[03:20:40.400 --> 03:20:42.400]  and they were giving him tremendous amounts of money.
[03:20:42.400 --> 03:20:45.400]  I think it was to the tune of a billion dollars at the time.
[03:20:45.400 --> 03:20:51.400]  And so there's a dual policy where publicly the British were saying that we oppose Hitler, he's a monster.
[03:20:52.400 --> 03:20:58.400]  Secretly they were allowing him, goading him into telling him they would support him if he goes into Poland
[03:20:58.400 --> 03:21:01.400]  and if he engages in this war.
[03:21:01.400 --> 03:21:06.400]  So that's relevant for today's discussion because as Hitler made his moves,
[03:21:06.400 --> 03:21:13.400]  and Hitler did have an anti-Jewish policy, he did say in fact there are even discussions of this
[03:21:13.400 --> 03:21:17.400]  in the writings of Himmler as well, that Judaism has to be gotten rid of
[03:21:17.400 --> 03:21:21.400]  because the God of the Old Testament, according to Himmler, for example, he says, is a monster.
[03:21:21.400 --> 03:21:28.400]  And so there's a Gnostic, a sort of Marcionite philosophy in Himmler's theology.
[03:21:28.400 --> 03:21:30.400]  And so that was a motivating factor in this.
[03:21:30.400 --> 03:21:35.400]  And so Hitler did want to stamp out this ideology and this people group.
[03:21:35.400 --> 03:21:42.400]  And so this worked, though, however, for the formation of, to help form the modern nation-state of Israel.
[03:21:42.400 --> 03:21:45.400]  So the Balfour Declaration is earlier on.
[03:21:45.400 --> 03:21:51.400]  And then by the 1930s, when we have the beginnings of the rise of Hitler,
[03:21:51.400 --> 03:21:57.400]  this is pushing then Jewish refugees to want to go to Palestine.
[03:21:57.400 --> 03:22:00.400]  And so you see that people are forced into these situations.
[03:22:00.400 --> 03:22:01.400]  It's not their fault.
[03:22:01.400 --> 03:22:06.400]  Ultimately they're tools for the power elite on the grand chessboard.
[03:22:07.400 --> 03:22:09.400]  And so it's not an either-or.
[03:22:09.400 --> 03:22:12.400]  One group shares all the blame versus the other group.
[03:22:12.400 --> 03:22:15.400]  Jews did want to flee from the persecution of Hitler.
[03:22:15.400 --> 03:22:21.400]  And so there was an agreement made, for example, in 1933,
[03:22:21.400 --> 03:22:30.400]  between the Zionist Federation of Germany and the, it's called the Havara Agreement,
[03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:36.400]  and the Nazis, to allow Jews to leave Germany to go to Palestine.
[03:22:36.400 --> 03:22:44.400]  And so you see that it's actually, this would have worked in the sense of if Jews had been allowed to go there.
[03:22:44.400 --> 03:22:50.400]  But when the Jews go there, they're then put into a powder keg situation where Arabs don't want them there.
[03:22:50.400 --> 03:22:56.400]  And originally the British Empire supported the Arabs because they were the existing people group there
[03:22:56.400 --> 03:22:59.400]  against the newly arrived Jewish refugees.
[03:22:59.400 --> 03:23:03.400]  So you can see how this is just a nightmare situation on both sides.
[03:23:03.400 --> 03:23:09.400]  And then it gets even crazier because, as we mentioned in the Conversation, an academic essay,
[03:23:09.400 --> 03:23:12.400]  Conversation is a website that has academic essays,
[03:23:12.400 --> 03:23:17.400]  it notes that after the Balfour Declaration and after this powder keg
[03:23:17.400 --> 03:23:23.400]  and the anger of Jews at the British Empire for not letting Jews come,
[03:23:23.400 --> 03:23:27.400]  while they were also secretly supporting Hitler, you see.
[03:23:27.400 --> 03:23:34.400]  You see how this is causing the anger and the British geopolitical strategies,
[03:23:34.400 --> 03:23:41.400]  which is not totally wedded to either Zionism or Arabs, it's trying to play both sides.
[03:23:41.400 --> 03:23:45.400]  Key point here, because maybe the American Empire tries to do the same thing.
[03:23:45.400 --> 03:23:51.400]  Playing both sides results in all of these destructive policies and these tragedies.
[03:23:51.400 --> 03:23:57.400]  So this partition, which was intended to be a managed dialectic, is becoming a problem
[03:23:57.400 --> 03:24:03.400]  because now Jews are mad that the British Empire is not allowing the refugees to come.
[03:24:03.400 --> 03:24:05.400]  And there could have been various reasons why they wanted that.
[03:24:05.400 --> 03:24:11.400]  Maybe they wanted more outrage, maybe they wanted to use Jews as a tool to get international outrage
[03:24:11.400 --> 03:24:14.400]  to further the Second World War.
[03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:20.400]  Because we know the British elite and a lot of these money makers, power players, corporations,
[03:24:20.400 --> 03:24:23.400]  they want to benefit from a Second World War.
[03:24:23.400 --> 03:24:27.400]  And ultimately they want to create a world government, you see.
[03:24:27.400 --> 03:24:34.400]  So then some of the forces within Israel decide that they've had enough of British rule.
[03:24:34.400 --> 03:24:40.400]  And so they decide that they want to start working against and fighting against British rule.
[03:24:40.400 --> 03:24:45.400]  And so you get David Ben-Gurion and other figures within the Jewish militia at that time,
[03:24:45.400 --> 03:24:51.400]  known as the Haganah, or the Defense, who were auxiliaries to the British police and army.
[03:24:51.400 --> 03:24:57.400]  Its intelligence service, called the Sherut Hayediot, or the Shea, supported Britain in the war effort
[03:24:57.400 --> 03:25:02.400]  and cooperated in the suppression of anti-British Zionist terrorism,
[03:25:02.400 --> 03:25:06.400]  led by other future prime ministers, Menachem Begum and Yitzhak Shamir.
[03:25:06.400 --> 03:25:13.400]  Ben-Gurion then learned from a source in the cabinet that Britain would prevent Jews from entering Palestine.
[03:25:13.400 --> 03:25:16.400]  So you see how that's the thing that kicks this off.
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:22.400]  He then authorized secret cooperation between Haganah and organized crime groups,
[03:25:22.400 --> 03:25:25.400]  known as the Irgun and the Stern Gang.
[03:25:25.400 --> 03:25:32.400]  So this would kick off a bunch of attacks, militia assassinations, bombing.
[03:25:32.400 --> 03:25:38.400]  The Jews assassinated, I think, a person from the UN and one of the British lords.
[03:25:39.400 --> 03:25:43.400]  And then you've got the King David Hotel bombing.
[03:25:43.400 --> 03:25:49.400]  And that led to the death of 90 people, including people from GCHQ,
[03:25:49.400 --> 03:25:53.400]  which is the British version of Signals Intelligence, or the NSA.
[03:25:53.400 --> 03:26:00.400]  And then, oddly enough, deceptive intelligence was disseminated by none other than Kim Philby,
[03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:04.400]  the Soviet traitor to Britain, later unmasked to be a Soviet mole,
[03:26:04.400 --> 03:26:07.400]  who sent Palestine's top security and police officers to Beirut.
[03:26:07.400 --> 03:26:14.400]  Britain's poor security at its headquarters was thus compounded by the absence of those meant to interpret the warnings intelligence.
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:18.400]  Terrorism thus destroyed part of Britain's top secret intelligence service.
[03:26:18.400 --> 03:26:24.400]  And then you began to have the aligning of the establishment of the 1948,
[03:26:24.400 --> 03:26:30.400]  soon after these events, the 1948 establishment of the nation of Israel.
[03:26:31.400 --> 03:26:36.400]  But that's relevant as well, because in regard to Islam,
[03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:46.400]  because remember that Britain typically had in their elite structure an equal support for both the Arabs and the Jews,
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:50.400]  because they wanted to manage both sides as part of imperial geopolitics.
[03:26:50.400 --> 03:26:56.400]  In fact, Twigley goes on to say that, and this is from Anglo-American establishment,
[03:26:56.400 --> 03:27:03.400]  he notes about this time period that some amongst the Milner group elites,
[03:27:03.400 --> 03:27:06.400]  they were neither pro-Arab nor pro-Zionist.
[03:27:06.400 --> 03:27:09.400]  Although many of them were supporting both the former and the latter,
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:14.400]  the group was never anti-Semitic and not a shred of evidence in this direction was ever found.
[03:27:14.400 --> 03:27:20.400]  In fact, they were sympathetic to Jews and to their legitimate aspirations in terms of their fate, to overcome their fate.
[03:27:20.400 --> 03:27:22.400]  But this feeling, it must be confessed, was general.
[03:27:22.400 --> 03:27:29.400]  It was not personal, and it had to do with what he says is purely academic or imperial geo-strategy here.
[03:27:31.100 --> 03:27:37.100]  The feelings about anti-Semitism were actually remote and academic.
[03:27:37.100 --> 03:27:42.100]  On the other hand, most of the British upper class supported the Arabs.
[03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:48.100]  Many members of the elite have been in Arab countries, were Arab experts, Arabists,
[03:27:48.100 --> 03:27:51.100]  and many of them had, in fact, converted to Islam.
[03:27:51.100 --> 03:27:57.100]  Think of the character W. T. E. Lawrence, or the character of, I mean, I just mentioned Kim Philby.
[03:27:57.100 --> 03:28:04.100]  Kim Philby's dad, St. John Philby, converted to Islam because he was a British intelligence operative in the Middle East.
[03:28:04.100 --> 03:28:07.100]  And he helped to establish Saudi Arabia.
[03:28:07.100 --> 03:28:14.100]  So remember, most of the Middle East, as we know of it today, is a creation of the British Empire.
[03:28:14.100 --> 03:28:19.100]  Whether it's Iraq, whether it's Pakistan, or whether it's the nation-state of Israel,
[03:28:19.100 --> 03:28:25.100]  all of this was really established in terms of British imperial geopolitics.
[03:28:25.100 --> 03:28:27.100]  And so they wanted to manage both sides of this.
[03:28:27.100 --> 03:28:32.100]  W. T. E. Lawrence, St. John Philby, all these characters, and the Milner-Fabian socialists,
[03:28:32.100 --> 03:28:35.100]  they, again, tended to favor Islam.
[03:28:35.100 --> 03:28:38.100]  And I'm going to talk about why they favored Islam here in a moment,
[03:28:38.100 --> 03:28:42.100]  from Johan Ratti's book on the history of Fabian socialism,
[03:28:42.100 --> 03:28:49.100]  because they saw Islam as a way to gradually bring into Europe and into the entire West an internationalist order.
[03:28:49.100 --> 03:28:55.100]  Don't go anywhere. This is The Occidental. We're covering the history of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
[03:28:55.100 --> 03:29:02.100]  I'm going to say something obvious right now, but it's usually the obvious things that we all miss, including myself.
[03:29:02.100 --> 03:29:05.100]  Everybody's getting very excited about the impeachment of Joe Biden.
[03:29:05.100 --> 03:29:08.100]  But remember, he is a total and complete puppet.
[03:29:08.100 --> 03:29:14.100]  It needs to be about the criminals that control him, the CIA, BlackRock, the multinational corporations.
[03:29:14.100 --> 03:29:18.100]  People want to blame Obama. Yeah, he's a bug bite, but he's still a puppet, too.
[03:29:18.100 --> 03:29:23.100]  We need to make it about the power structure that's waging war against this country,
[03:29:23.100 --> 03:29:27.100]  that's de-industrializing us and attacking our culture and creating race war.
[03:29:27.100 --> 03:29:32.100]  We need to make the impeachment all about the open borders and the human trafficking
[03:29:32.100 --> 03:29:37.100]  and the global government and the UN taking control of our medical system.
[03:29:37.100 --> 03:29:40.100]  That's what we need to do. That's what we've got to stand for.
[03:29:40.100 --> 03:29:43.100]  That's what is going to bring down the system.
[03:29:43.100 --> 03:29:47.100]  If we just make it about Biden, just about how horrible he is, an isopedophile,
[03:29:47.100 --> 03:29:53.100]  and how his son's a crackhead in gun charges, it becomes a distraction from the larger issues.

[03:32:58.100 --> 03:33:14.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.100 --> 03:33:16.100]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.100 --> 03:33:21.100]  We're going into the very complex, very difficult, no easy answers history
[03:33:21.100 --> 03:33:27.100]  of the Jewish-Palestine conflict.
[03:33:27.100 --> 03:33:33.100]  And we were talking about the establishing of the modern state of Israel in 1948.
[03:33:33.100 --> 03:33:38.100]  Interestingly, not too long after that, one of the Nazi collaborator figures
[03:33:38.100 --> 03:33:44.100]  known as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, a position completely invented by the British Empire.
[03:33:44.100 --> 03:33:48.100]  And in fact, the Grand Mufti himself was a British intelligence operative.
[03:33:48.100 --> 03:33:53.100]  Remember, he was a Nazi collaborator, British intelligence operative.
[03:33:53.100 --> 03:33:58.100]  Then he proclaimed that there would be an Arab government of all Palestine,
[03:33:58.100 --> 03:34:02.100]  again further provoking the flames here.
[03:34:02.100 --> 03:34:07.100]  And again, that just shows that the motivations were on the part of the British Empire.
[03:34:07.100 --> 03:34:13.100]  Pure imperial geopolitics had nothing to do with necessarily favoring some people
[03:34:13.100 --> 03:34:15.100]  group over another people group.
[03:34:15.100 --> 03:34:21.100]  British efforts to invoke the 1936 alliance with Egypt and to justify British military action
[03:34:21.100 --> 03:34:26.100]  against Israel were blocked by Egypt's refusal to allow public display of Egypt's helplessness.
[03:34:26.100 --> 03:34:31.100]  Five British planes were attacked and shot down in 1949 by Israel,
[03:34:31.100 --> 03:34:36.100]  and this led to Britain's de facto recognition of Israel as a nation state.
[03:34:36.100 --> 03:34:42.100]  And part of the reason that Britain wanted to do that was to try to maintain imperial power
[03:34:42.100 --> 03:34:47.100]  versus other rivals and versus other groups.
[03:34:47.100 --> 03:34:51.100]  Britain felt like if they could maintain Muslim support,
[03:34:51.100 --> 03:34:56.100]  if they could control areas like Mecca as part of their old geopolitical strategy,
[03:34:56.100 --> 03:35:02.100]  they could sway the Islamic world into favor with the British Empire
[03:35:02.100 --> 03:35:04.100]  where they could try to manage it or control it.
[03:35:04.100 --> 03:35:07.100]  And so as they failed in these endeavors,
[03:35:08.100 --> 03:35:15.100]  you can see how their manipulation strategy was more and more transparent to history
[03:35:15.100 --> 03:35:16.100]  as history progresses.
[03:35:16.100 --> 03:35:22.100]  In fact, it gets even more hairy and confusing when you look at the fact that
[03:35:22.100 --> 03:35:28.100]  after World War II, some of the most famous of the SS individuals,
[03:35:28.100 --> 03:35:33.100]  these are articles that are still public on Tourette's,
[03:35:33.100 --> 03:35:36.100]  the strange case of the Nazi who became the Israeli hitman,
[03:35:36.100 --> 03:35:40.100]  Otto Skorzeny was one of Mossad's most valuable assets,
[03:35:40.100 --> 03:35:44.100]  but was, in fact, a former lieutenant colonel in the Waffen SS
[03:35:44.100 --> 03:35:46.100]  and was one of Hitler's favorites.
[03:35:46.100 --> 03:35:49.100]  And that's because it's not just Otto Skorzeny,
[03:35:49.100 --> 03:35:55.100]  but it's also the figure of Reinhard Galen,
[03:35:55.100 --> 03:35:59.100]  who actually also helped out in Israel's Six-Day War.
[03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:02.100]  It was Galen who was, now that he worked with the CIA,
[03:36:02.100 --> 03:36:10.100]  aiding and contributing intelligence work and giving tips off to the Mossad
[03:36:10.100 --> 03:36:14.100]  during that conflict, as well as Skorzeny,
[03:36:14.100 --> 03:36:20.100]  because Galen, as the former general to Hitler,
[03:36:20.100 --> 03:36:24.100]  had a vast intelligence network throughout all of Europe,
[03:36:24.100 --> 03:36:27.100]  and when the Nazis lost the war,
[03:36:27.100 --> 03:36:29.100]  the CIA came to Galen and said,
[03:36:29.100 --> 03:36:31.100]  if you hand over your intelligence network to us,
[03:36:31.100 --> 03:36:33.100]  you can maintain your freedom.
[03:36:33.100 --> 03:36:36.100]  In fact, we'll put you as the head of the new BND, German intelligence.
[03:36:36.100 --> 03:36:40.100]  So as the head of the BND, he was now aiding and working with the Mossad.
[03:36:40.100 --> 03:36:45.100]  So you understand that that helps explain why you can have things like
[03:36:45.100 --> 03:36:50.100]  the former SS guy in Canada being cheered on by the West,
[03:36:50.100 --> 03:36:53.100]  because the West has for a long time worked with these people,
[03:36:53.100 --> 03:36:55.100]  as have groups in Israel.
[03:36:55.100 --> 03:36:59.100]  And that's why, if you know the inner, deeper history in geopolitics,
[03:36:59.100 --> 03:37:03.100]  it's not surprising that Hamas was a creation of the West.
[03:37:03.100 --> 03:37:08.100]  In fact, the clip of Ron Paul saying this is still going around on Twitter.
[03:37:08.100 --> 03:37:10.100]  I played it the other day.
[03:37:10.100 --> 03:37:14.100]  And he was just years ago talking about how we helped,
[03:37:14.100 --> 03:37:17.100]  much like the British Empire caused a lot of this at the time,
[03:37:17.100 --> 03:37:21.100]  we helped foster this conflict by sending aid and money
[03:37:21.100 --> 03:37:24.100]  to both sides of the conflict.
[03:37:24.100 --> 03:37:27.100]  And some of that's done secretly and covertly.
[03:37:27.100 --> 03:37:32.100]  In fact, Hamas was created out of the Muslim Brotherhood,
[03:37:32.100 --> 03:37:36.100]  which was an old British intelligence-controlled Islamic network.
[03:37:36.100 --> 03:37:40.100]  In fact, British intelligence and their agents helped to set up
[03:37:40.100 --> 03:37:42.100]  the Muslim Brotherhood famously.
[03:37:42.100 --> 03:37:47.100]  And out of that is partly where you get Hamas.
[03:37:47.100 --> 03:37:52.100]  There's also the CIA, British intelligence, and Mossad as well
[03:37:52.100 --> 03:37:56.100]  helped to work with the establishment of Hamas.
[03:37:56.100 --> 03:38:00.100]  And so that might explain partly why some of this intelligence
[03:38:00.100 --> 03:38:05.100]  was ignored when Israel was warned by Egypt and other places
[03:38:05.100 --> 03:38:07.100]  that there might be a coming attack.
[03:38:07.100 --> 03:38:11.100]  I mean, that's speculation, but we know that a lot of this,
[03:38:11.100 --> 03:38:15.100]  it's not like Israeli intelligence didn't know what was going on
[03:38:15.100 --> 03:38:19.100]  or what the opposition was up to.
[03:38:20.100 --> 03:38:22.100]  So it's really odd because, you know, when somebody comes out
[03:38:22.100 --> 03:38:25.100]  and tries to say something with sanity, in fact, Gal Gadot,
[03:38:25.100 --> 03:38:28.100]  who used to be in the IDF, she was getting attacked by both sides
[03:38:28.100 --> 03:38:32.100]  because she said something about how she wished that there could be peace
[03:38:32.100 --> 03:38:36.100]  and that Jews have a right to exist and that also that the neighbors
[03:38:36.100 --> 03:38:39.100]  next door should also be allowed to exist.
[03:38:39.100 --> 03:38:41.100]  And it's odd because, I mean, she was in the IDF.
[03:38:41.100 --> 03:38:44.100]  Surely she would have some knowledge of this situation, right?
[03:38:44.100 --> 03:38:48.100]  Wouldn't she know about it, being a former IDF soldier?
[03:38:48.100 --> 03:38:52.100]  I mean, I think that people in those situations kind of see it up close,
[03:38:52.100 --> 03:38:54.100]  and they understand that it's complex.
[03:38:54.100 --> 03:38:58.100]  It's not an easy either-or, but the media, the elites,
[03:38:58.100 --> 03:39:01.100]  they always want everybody to really get wrapped up in some either-or,
[03:39:01.100 --> 03:39:05.100]  and people don't know the history and they don't know either side of this
[03:39:05.100 --> 03:39:08.100]  and the contentions that both sides have.
[03:39:08.100 --> 03:39:12.100]  And so I think it's important to know this and to understand that
[03:39:12.100 --> 03:39:15.100]  the old strategy was to play both sides.
[03:39:15.100 --> 03:39:18.100]  And I think, I mean, I don't have exact proof of this,
[03:39:18.100 --> 03:39:21.100]  but when I hear about, you know, the U.S. money,
[03:39:21.100 --> 03:39:26.100]  especially the Democratic Party that tends to favor working with Iran
[03:39:26.100 --> 03:39:30.100]  and the money that's sent to them, some of that could, I mean,
[03:39:30.100 --> 03:39:34.100]  this is speculation, but I think it goes back to the overthrow of the Shah
[03:39:34.100 --> 03:39:38.100]  and, excuse me, the overthrow of Mossadegh and the installation of the Shah
[03:39:38.100 --> 03:39:43.100]  and then also the CIA helping to make backdoor deals with the Ayatollah,
[03:39:43.100 --> 03:39:46.100]  which Alex just talked about, and that had to do with Iran-Contra.
[03:39:46.100 --> 03:39:50.100]  It had to do with actually still continuing to arm Iran even under the Ayatollahs
[03:39:50.100 --> 03:39:53.100]  in, again, backdoor deals under the Reagan era.
[03:39:53.100 --> 03:39:55.100]  But it also relates to something that few know about,
[03:39:55.100 --> 03:39:59.100]  which is Iran's involvement in the international drug trade.
[03:39:59.100 --> 03:40:03.100]  It's a big part of this. It's not just oil. It's also drugs and opium.
[03:40:03.100 --> 03:40:08.100]  And according to Dr. John Coleman, former British intelligence writer,
[03:40:08.100 --> 03:40:14.100]  the Ayatollahs covertly gave the okay to allow a lot of opium and drugs
[03:40:14.100 --> 03:40:17.100]  to be sold and shipped via Iran.
[03:40:17.100 --> 03:40:20.100]  And so there's a lot going on that people don't know about,
[03:40:20.100 --> 03:40:24.100]  and thus there could be backdoor deals that are made with Iran
[03:40:24.100 --> 03:40:28.100]  on the part of the democratic establishment.
[03:40:28.100 --> 03:40:31.100]  Neocons, of course, don't typically want to do that.
[03:40:31.100 --> 03:40:34.100]  They want to bomb Iran, which, again, could spark World War III.
[03:40:35.100 --> 03:40:38.100]  But, again, the point is that all of this is complex.
[03:40:38.100 --> 03:40:40.100]  There's no easy answers.
[03:40:40.100 --> 03:40:47.100]  There's no simple solutions to this because it goes back to old imperial geopolitics.
[03:40:47.100 --> 03:40:49.100]  And so now that we're under the American empire
[03:40:49.100 --> 03:40:52.100]  and the breakdown of the American empire
[03:40:52.100 --> 03:40:56.100]  and the meaningless liberalism that we've adopted,
[03:40:56.100 --> 03:40:59.100]  I mean, none of this makes any sense.
[03:40:59.100 --> 03:41:02.100]  What does the American empire stand for?
[03:41:02.100 --> 03:41:05.100]  If these conflicts continue and if our borders open
[03:41:05.100 --> 03:41:07.100]  and the country begins more and more to collapse
[03:41:07.100 --> 03:41:12.100]  and have economic catastrophes, which is very likely,
[03:41:12.100 --> 03:41:15.100]  what are we actually fighting for?
[03:41:15.100 --> 03:41:19.100]  Are we just fighting to extend gay rights in other countries
[03:41:19.100 --> 03:41:23.100]  so that everybody can have Coke and Pepsi and Subway and abortion?
[03:41:23.100 --> 03:41:26.100]  Is that what we're going to all the other countries for?
[03:41:26.100 --> 03:41:30.100]  And the people are figuring out that all of the foreign aid
[03:41:30.100 --> 03:41:34.100]  and all these foreign interventions is ruining our own country
[03:41:34.100 --> 03:41:36.100]  as our country itself collapses.
[03:41:36.100 --> 03:41:39.100]  And so we're told all day long that it's bad to have borders,
[03:41:39.100 --> 03:41:43.100]  it's bad to have guns, but we've got to defend every other country's borders
[03:41:43.100 --> 03:41:46.100]  and send every other country billions of dollars of weapons and guns.
[03:41:46.100 --> 03:41:48.100]  And all the citizens now need to be armed.
[03:41:48.100 --> 03:41:51.100]  But Americans can't be armed because that's racist.
[03:41:51.100 --> 03:41:53.100]  I mean, everybody has figured this out, that it's completely hypocritical,
[03:41:53.100 --> 03:41:55.100]  and it makes no sense.
[03:41:55.100 --> 03:41:59.100]  It does make sense, however, if the goal is to actually weaken and destroy America
[03:41:59.100 --> 03:42:02.100]  because the long-term goal is to bring all of the countries
[03:42:02.100 --> 03:42:06.100]  into a single global order out of all of this chaos,
[03:42:06.100 --> 03:42:10.100]  and that's precisely what the global elite have said is their goal.
[03:42:10.100 --> 03:42:13.100]  Whether this is going to be World War III, I don't know,
[03:42:13.100 --> 03:42:16.100]  but it certainly could turn into that.
[03:42:16.100 --> 03:42:20.100]  And some of the theorists, as we said, believe that out of World War III,
[03:42:20.100 --> 03:42:24.100]  you would get a lot of death, destruction, and chaos,
[03:42:24.100 --> 03:42:29.100]  that you would get the synthesis of, you know, Russia, China,
[03:42:29.100 --> 03:42:32.100]  the Muslim world versus the West.
[03:42:32.100 --> 03:42:38.100]  Out of this synthesis, you would get the future technocratic world order,
[03:42:38.100 --> 03:42:43.100]  the Davos plan, the global, you know, one world order, one world religion plan
[03:42:43.100 --> 03:42:48.100]  could come out of this synthesis of East versus West.
[03:42:48.100 --> 03:42:51.100]  But that's the key thing here, and that's what, you know,
[03:42:51.100 --> 03:42:55.100]  one of the figures that plays into this who was involved in some of these
[03:42:55.100 --> 03:43:00.100]  Israeli operations at that time, Bernard Lewis, is the father of neoconservatism.
[03:43:00.100 --> 03:43:04.100]  And Bernard Lewis, if I recall, taught Samuel P. Huntington,
[03:43:04.100 --> 03:43:07.100]  who wrote Clash of Civilizations, and Huntington talks about basically
[03:43:07.100 --> 03:43:12.100]  this idea that the West would clash against the Islamic world,
[03:43:12.100 --> 03:43:16.100]  and there's a lot of different theories and scenarios as to how that might happen
[03:43:16.100 --> 03:43:19.100]  and what the result exactly might be, but their overall result would be
[03:43:19.100 --> 03:43:22.100]  a new kind of order out of that, a new world order,
[03:43:22.100 --> 03:43:26.100]  out of dialectical manipulation and synthesis.
[03:43:26.100 --> 03:43:29.100]  That sounds like everything that you've heard me talking about.
[03:43:29.100 --> 03:43:35.100]  Now, for the idea that, oh, well, this is only a Jewish power block issue,
[03:43:35.100 --> 03:43:40.100]  remember that the Milner-Fabian circles have always supported and aided
[03:43:40.100 --> 03:43:43.100]  and promoted Muslim causes.
[03:43:43.100 --> 03:43:48.100]  Why would they intentionally constantly promote Muslim and Islamic causes
[03:43:48.100 --> 03:43:50.100]  in this regard?
[03:43:50.100 --> 03:43:58.100]  Well, according to Yohan Ratu in his whole chapter about the Islamicization
[03:43:58.100 --> 03:44:02.100]  of Britain, you can see in a microcosm what their plan was,
[03:44:02.100 --> 03:44:08.100]  and the idea was that through early on in the early 1900s,
[03:44:08.100 --> 03:44:14.100]  the importation of Sufi Islam, because it's ecumenist and because it's kind of
[03:44:14.100 --> 03:44:18.100]  open to a lot of different mystical practices and whatnot,
[03:44:18.100 --> 03:44:23.100]  Sufi Islam is a way to soften up a society for the later importation
[03:44:23.100 --> 03:44:28.100]  of more fundamentalist versions or serious versions of Islam.
[03:44:28.100 --> 03:44:35.100]  And so the Fabians and the Fabian social circles of the Milner group,
[03:44:35.100 --> 03:44:38.100]  that was their overriding political ideology and strategy.
[03:44:38.100 --> 03:44:42.100]  They were fine with bringing in these figures and these characters
[03:44:42.100 --> 03:44:49.100]  and the promotion of the Islamic revival at Oxford and Cambridge in the 19-teens,
[03:44:49.100 --> 03:44:53.100]  20s, 30s, and 40s, and this continued all the way up until today,
[03:44:53.100 --> 03:44:56.100]  which is precisely why England is Londonistan.
[03:44:56.100 --> 03:44:59.100]  When you go to London, it is Muslim.
[03:44:59.100 --> 03:45:04.100]  I went a few years ago and did a lecture there, and it's Islamic.
[03:45:04.100 --> 03:45:07.100]  Now, is this just all accident? No, no, it's not accident,
[03:45:07.100 --> 03:45:12.100]  because it's actually the Fabian strategy, as they themselves said,
[03:45:12.100 --> 03:45:19.100]  they would Islamicize England first and then the rest of Europe.
[03:45:19.100 --> 03:45:21.100]  That was their plan. They wrote about it.
[03:45:21.100 --> 03:45:27.100]  In fact, the original Fabians were either atheists or Christian socialists,
[03:45:27.100 --> 03:45:30.100]  and thus they had a very soft spot for Islam,
[03:45:30.100 --> 03:45:34.100]  and they thought that because of Islam's universal brotherhood teaching,
[03:45:34.100 --> 03:45:37.100]  that it could be a tool for global domination.
[03:45:37.100 --> 03:45:42.100]  It might even be a potential future world government from their vantage point.
[03:45:42.100 --> 03:45:45.100]  H.G. Wells praised Islam in his book, A Short History of the World.
[03:45:45.100 --> 03:45:50.100]  George Bernard Shaw said that Muhammad was the greatest Protestant religious force in the world,
[03:45:50.100 --> 03:45:53.100]  like a George Fox or a John Wesley.
[03:45:53.100 --> 03:45:57.100]  Other leading Fabians were apologists for Islam,
[03:45:57.100 --> 03:46:01.100]  like Witch Annie Besant and like Bertrand Russell.
[03:46:01.100 --> 03:46:07.100]  The Fabian window, which is that famous glass window,
[03:46:07.100 --> 03:46:13.100]  carried the motto, remolding the world according to the heart's desire.
[03:46:13.100 --> 03:46:22.100]  The Fabian socialist model to remold the world is taken from a Muslim poem by Omar Khayyam.
[03:46:23.100 --> 03:46:28.100]  Khayyam was in vogue amongst the progressive, liberal faction of the British elites.
[03:46:28.100 --> 03:46:36.100]  And thus, what was significant about him is that he was believed to be a follower of a kind of Sufism,
[03:46:36.100 --> 03:46:43.100]  and that Sufism would, for many British elites, serve as the instrument for softening up non-Muslim populations
[03:46:43.100 --> 03:46:46.100]  to the later penetration of real Islam.
[03:46:46.100 --> 03:46:53.100]  Because it was mystical, it could appear to work together with other religions in a society,
[03:46:53.100 --> 03:47:00.100]  and it also overlapped with Socialism, Gurdjieff's New Age philosophy, Freemasonry, and Theosophy.
[03:47:00.100 --> 03:47:08.100]  So Sufism, which then got more and more into vogue, and keep in mind, Prince Charles was initiated into a Sufi order,
[03:47:08.100 --> 03:47:19.100]  they brought in entities, groups, and academics to teach and push Islam throughout England.
[03:47:19.100 --> 03:47:22.100]  And I'll tell you some of these figures.
[03:47:22.100 --> 03:47:28.100]  You have the figure at Cambridge, you had the promotion of a guy named Muhammad Iqbal,
[03:47:28.100 --> 03:47:35.100]  a lawyer who combined the teachings of Sufi poet Rumi with Islamic revivalism in the 1930s.
[03:47:35.100 --> 03:47:41.100]  Iqbal pioneered the idea of a Muslim state in the 1930s and collaborated with the Fabian Socialist leaders,
[03:47:41.100 --> 03:47:45.100]  including people like Muhammad al-Jinnah, in the creation of Pakistan.
[03:47:45.100 --> 03:47:54.100]  Sufism and Islam were also promoted by various disciples of these characters at the University of London.
[03:47:54.100 --> 03:48:00.100]  Annie Besant was busy preaching Theosophy and various brands of reformed Islam
[03:48:00.100 --> 03:48:03.100]  as they were being planted throughout England.
[03:48:03.100 --> 03:48:11.100]  In 1913, another lawyer from India named Kamal Uddin was established in the Woking Muslim Mission.
[03:48:11.100 --> 03:48:19.100]  Many British, including Lord Headley, wrote a Western Awakening to Islam book in 1914, which was very popular.
[03:48:19.100 --> 03:48:26.100]  In 1916, the London Sufi Order of the West was founded by Indian Hazrat Inyat Khan,
[03:48:26.100 --> 03:48:32.100]  who taught that the Prophet Muhammad brought the message of democracy to the world.
[03:48:32.100 --> 03:48:35.100]  A.C. Wells could not have said it better, according to Raju.
[03:48:35.100 --> 03:48:42.100]  Following the footsteps of Khan, Idris Shah was the chief architect of Sufi deception in Britain and elsewhere.
[03:48:42.100 --> 03:48:49.100]  He started Octagon Press in 1960 and a foundation called the Institute for Cultural Research, the ICR.
[03:48:49.100 --> 03:48:55.100]  This allowed for the publication and progress of Sufism throughout England,
[03:48:56.100 --> 03:49:03.100]  as well as eventually Prince Charles' overt support for Islam, which began in the 1980s.
[03:49:03.100 --> 03:49:12.100]  And this then led to the Labour Party and their policy of open borders to bring in more and more Muslims.
[03:49:12.100 --> 03:49:18.100]  Again, why? Because Labour and their Fabian Socialist origins
[03:49:18.100 --> 03:49:23.100]  have always favoured the destruction of the nation state to bring in the technocratic order.
[03:49:23.100 --> 03:49:28.100]  And so you can see that obviously they're not going to be pro-Israel or side with Israel.
[03:49:28.100 --> 03:49:35.100]  That's why you find a tendency amongst the left and Communist Socialists to support Palestine.
[03:49:35.100 --> 03:49:42.100]  That does not mean that everybody in Palestine is Communist Socialist, so don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying that.
[03:49:42.100 --> 03:49:46.100]  Many people in Palestine are Orthodox Christians, for example.
[03:49:47.100 --> 03:49:57.100]  So Sufi Neoplatonism is a crucial element of the Perennialism and the Ecumenism
[03:49:57.100 --> 03:50:05.100]  that is able to then change an existing culture, not just demographically, but also ideologically and religiously.
[03:50:05.100 --> 03:50:10.100]  So this is why Sufism is a good tool for that. And that's exactly what happened in the UK.
[03:50:10.100 --> 03:50:19.100]  It began with those kind of new agey mystical groups and then now it's completely overrun in London and in England throughout the UK
[03:50:19.100 --> 03:50:27.100]  with Muslims of all variety. And that, again, I think plays into this shock strategy of tension model,
[03:50:27.100 --> 03:50:31.100]  which is to do this on purpose. An angrier world, why?
[03:50:31.100 --> 03:50:39.100]  Well, that's just what Brzezinski talked about a long time ago when the strategy of the CIA was to arm and fund the Taliban,
[03:50:39.100 --> 03:50:45.100]  the Mujahideen and so forth in Operation Cyclone, and even earlier than that.
[03:50:45.100 --> 03:50:50.100]  So you can see that it's a way to exploit the clash of civilizations model,
[03:50:50.100 --> 03:50:56.100]  and ultimately the idea here is to destroy Christianity and the West.
[03:50:56.100 --> 03:51:00.100]  And perhaps some of the other entities will be destroyed in the process, right?
[03:51:00.100 --> 03:51:04.100]  Maybe Islam versus the West could result in some sort of mass destruction, who knows?
[03:51:04.100 --> 03:51:14.100]  But the reality is that the power elite are not actually against either of these groups in the long run.
[03:51:14.100 --> 03:51:21.100]  People are used as chess pieces on the chessboard, if that makes sense.
[03:51:21.100 --> 03:51:29.100]  And so if we grasp this, we begin to understand that it's a bigger picture than just choosing a side right away.
[03:51:29.100 --> 03:51:36.100]  And so I wanted to point out quickly says also that some of the British, for example,
[03:51:36.100 --> 03:51:40.100]  in the support of Israel, thought that you could have a Western outpost,
[03:51:40.100 --> 03:51:46.100]  not just for the point of geostrategy and oil and stuff like that later on,
[03:51:46.100 --> 03:51:51.100]  but some thought that maybe they could introduce democracy to the Middle East
[03:51:51.100 --> 03:51:58.100]  and that this would then heal the tribalism and the ancient warfare in the Middle East
[03:51:58.100 --> 03:52:00.100]  that's been there for millennia.
[03:52:00.100 --> 03:52:04.100]  But this didn't work out because it's just this bizarre, silly notion.
[03:52:04.100 --> 03:52:08.100]  I don't think that at the top the real power elite cared about this,
[03:52:08.100 --> 03:52:13.100]  but some of the more academic intelligentsia people in the U.S. and in the U.K.
[03:52:13.100 --> 03:52:17.100]  probably thought that, oh, if we just export democracy to all these places,
[03:52:17.100 --> 03:52:21.100]  then they'll see that science and technology and having running water
[03:52:21.100 --> 03:52:27.100]  and having, you know, refrigerators and iPads or whatever,
[03:52:27.100 --> 03:52:31.100]  they'll prefer that to the sort of tribal warfare
[03:52:31.100 --> 03:52:36.100]  and the regressive third world status that some of these places have remained in.
[03:52:36.100 --> 03:52:39.100]  But that doesn't work typically, right?
[03:52:39.100 --> 03:52:42.100]  Not every country wants the exportation of democracy.
[03:52:42.100 --> 03:52:46.100]  And ultimately, it's not about the exportation of democracy.
[03:52:46.100 --> 03:52:49.100]  I think everybody who's somewhat sophisticated knows this.
[03:52:49.100 --> 03:52:51.100]  It's about control, right?
[03:52:51.100 --> 03:52:54.100]  Democracy is not actually a thing that's exported to help people.
[03:52:54.100 --> 03:53:01.100]  That is a front, it's a cloak for exporting and expanding the Atlanticist empire.
[03:53:01.100 --> 03:53:03.100]  And that's what even Brzezinski said.
[03:53:03.100 --> 03:53:08.100]  Brzezinski says, Kissinger say, America is the successor to the British empire.
[03:53:08.100 --> 03:53:12.100]  It's just another type of imperial control strategy.
[03:53:12.100 --> 03:53:15.100]  The poverty, chaos, disunity of the Arab world
[03:53:15.100 --> 03:53:18.100]  were a consequence of the organizational and moral factors
[03:53:18.100 --> 03:53:22.100]  rather than of the objective obstacles, especially in the case of Israel.
[03:53:22.100 --> 03:53:24.100]  This is Dr. Carol Quigley.
[03:53:24.100 --> 03:53:28.100]  It was less than 8,000 square miles with no significant resources
[03:53:28.100 --> 03:53:30.100]  and hampered by endless obstacles.
[03:53:30.100 --> 03:53:34.100]  The Zionist movement has constructed the strongest, most stable, progressive
[03:53:34.100 --> 03:53:37.100]  and democratic hopeful state in the Near East.
[03:53:37.100 --> 03:53:41.100]  Quigley is writing this in the 1960s about where things were at that time.
[03:53:41.100 --> 03:53:44.100]  This was possible because of the morale of the Israelis
[03:53:44.100 --> 03:53:48.100]  which was based on outlooks antithetical to the outlooks of the Arabs.
[03:53:48.100 --> 03:53:51.100]  The Israelis were full of self-sacrifice and discipline
[03:53:51.100 --> 03:53:54.100]  social solidarity and readiness to work and cooperate
[03:53:54.100 --> 03:53:56.100]  with open hopes for their future.
[03:53:56.100 --> 03:53:59.100]  This ideology was largely Western
[03:53:59.100 --> 03:54:02.100]  with a devotion to the notions of science, democracy,
[03:54:02.100 --> 03:54:06.100]  individuality, technology, and so forth.
[03:54:06.100 --> 03:54:10.100]  And these were anathema to the Arabs of that time
[03:54:10.100 --> 03:54:13.100]  whose hysterical views and their hatred
[03:54:13.100 --> 03:54:16.100]  were not really aimed at the loss of Palestine
[03:54:16.100 --> 03:54:18.100]  but the presence of the Israelis
[03:54:18.100 --> 03:54:22.100]  whose qualities were a reputation of the generations of Arab
[03:54:22.100 --> 03:54:24.100]  self-deception and pretenses.
[03:54:24.100 --> 03:54:28.100]  So clearly Quigley thinks that the nation-state of Israel
[03:54:28.100 --> 03:54:30.100]  represented Western democracy
[03:54:30.100 --> 03:54:35.100]  and that the older Arab models were a regressive approach.
[03:54:35.100 --> 03:54:39.100]  This precarious balance that the British tried to keep in Palestine
[03:54:39.100 --> 03:54:45.100]  between the promises to the Zionists and to their efforts to placate the Arabs
[03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:48.100]  was destroyed by Hitler's determination to annihilate Jews in Europe
[03:54:48.100 --> 03:54:50.100]  and the conditions of World War II
[03:54:50.100 --> 03:54:53.100]  which made it seem that he would be successful.
[03:54:53.100 --> 03:54:55.100]  So you see how complex this is and remember
[03:54:55.100 --> 03:54:58.100]  the British elite are also at the same time according to Quigley
[03:54:58.100 --> 03:55:00.100]  supporting Hitler.
[03:55:00.100 --> 03:55:03.100]  So they're always trying to play both sides
[03:55:03.100 --> 03:55:08.100]  and that's why this ultimately results in all kinds of chaos and destruction.
[03:55:08.100 --> 03:55:11.100]  The Jews, their supporters, and allies tried to smuggle in Jews
[03:55:11.100 --> 03:55:13.100]  that could be saved from Europe.
[03:55:13.100 --> 03:55:15.100]  Since there was nowhere else that they could go
[03:55:15.100 --> 03:55:17.100]  many were smuggled into Palestine.
[03:55:17.100 --> 03:55:19.100]  British efforts to prevent this
[03:55:19.100 --> 03:55:21.100]  in fulfillment of their obligations to the Arabs
[03:55:21.100 --> 03:55:23.100]  under the League of Nations mandate
[03:55:23.100 --> 03:55:27.100]  led to the guerrilla warfare tactics between Jews and British.
[03:55:27.100 --> 03:55:32.100]  That's the Ben-Gurion-Irgun battles that we were talking about a minute ago.
[03:55:32.100 --> 03:55:36.100]  The Arabs were attacking the former intermittently
[03:55:36.100 --> 03:55:40.100]  and this problem reached the acute form with the conquest of Germany
[03:55:40.100 --> 03:55:42.100]  opening the doors for the survival of Jews
[03:55:42.100 --> 03:55:44.100]  to escape from the horrors of Nazism.
[03:55:44.100 --> 03:55:47.100]  In 1945, President Truman asked the British permission
[03:55:47.100 --> 03:55:50.100]  to admit 100,000 European Jews into Palestine
[03:55:50.100 --> 03:55:53.100]  but these requests were ignored by the Labour government, you see.
[03:55:53.100 --> 03:55:56.100]  Ignoring such permission, large-scale efforts were made
[03:55:56.100 --> 03:55:58.100]  to smuggle the Jews into Palestine.
[03:55:58.100 --> 03:56:03.100]  That then led to more Arab anger at Jews coming into Palestine.
[03:56:03.100 --> 03:56:07.100]  And so all of this had to do with, again, the UK mandate
[03:56:08.100 --> 03:56:13.100]  and then the uprising of the Jews against the British, their Haganah
[03:56:13.100 --> 03:56:16.100]  which then eventually becomes the Army of Israel
[03:56:16.100 --> 03:56:18.100]  as we know it today, I think.
[03:56:18.100 --> 03:56:20.100]  So you see how difficult this is.
[03:56:20.100 --> 03:56:23.100]  There's no simple solutions to a situation
[03:56:23.100 --> 03:56:28.100]  where people have been on both sides there for a while.
[03:56:28.100 --> 03:56:31.100]  And so it's not no Jew that lives there today,
[03:56:31.100 --> 03:56:34.100]  it's not their fault that they're there, right?
[03:56:34.100 --> 03:56:37.100]  And the Arabs that were there before the Jews were put there,
[03:56:37.100 --> 03:56:40.100]  it's not the Jews' fault that they were put there.
[03:56:40.100 --> 03:56:44.100]  They were allowed to go there via the Balfour Declaration
[03:56:44.100 --> 03:56:48.100]  and then through machinations in Europe that forced them to go there.
[03:56:48.100 --> 03:56:51.100]  And also there was laws that were in place
[03:56:51.100 --> 03:56:54.100]  that didn't allow them to go there when they wanted to go there.
[03:56:54.100 --> 03:56:56.100]  You see how complicated this gets.
[03:56:56.100 --> 03:57:00.100]  And also the British elites were continuing to support
[03:57:00.100 --> 03:57:02.100]  the Arab side as well
[03:57:02.100 --> 03:57:06.100]  through the higher level elites of the Fabian socialist circles
[03:57:06.100 --> 03:57:11.100]  which supported and still support today both sides of it
[03:57:11.100 --> 03:57:13.100]  in our government, in our power structure
[03:57:13.100 --> 03:57:16.100]  as we see with the money given to Iran.
[03:57:16.100 --> 03:57:18.100]  So you see how this continues.
[03:57:18.100 --> 03:57:21.100]  The geo-strategy of the Imperium continues on today.
[03:57:21.100 --> 03:57:24.100]  So it's no easy issue.
[03:57:24.100 --> 03:57:27.100]  If you want to support me, you can go to my website, JasonAllison.com
[03:57:27.100 --> 03:57:29.100]  and you can buy my books there as well.
[03:57:29.100 --> 03:57:32.100]  You can subscribe to me on Rockfin, a great free speech platform.
[03:57:32.100 --> 03:57:36.100]  Also support Alex by going to the Infowars store
[03:57:36.100 --> 03:57:39.100]  and getting those products and keeping this show on the air.
[03:57:39.100 --> 03:57:43.100]  And you can also sign up to my website
[03:57:43.100 --> 03:57:46.100]  and get access to my archives at JasonAllison.com.
[03:57:46.100 --> 03:57:51.100]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years
[03:57:51.100 --> 03:57:54.100]  because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's going on.
[03:57:54.100 --> 03:57:56.100]  And these are game-changing products.
[03:57:56.100 --> 03:57:58.100]  It's like our information is game-changing.
[03:57:58.100 --> 03:58:00.100]  These products are incredible.
[03:58:00.100 --> 03:58:04.100]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[03:58:04.100 --> 03:58:07.100]  All three of the Infowars Platinum flagship products
[03:58:07.100 --> 03:58:11.100]  that have been sold out for months are now back in stock
[03:58:11.100 --> 03:58:14.100]  but a very limited run because we only had a budget
[03:58:14.100 --> 03:58:18.100]  to get 3,000 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[03:58:18.100 --> 03:58:23.100]  We've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[03:58:23.100 --> 03:58:27.100]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost
[03:58:27.100 --> 03:58:31.100]  that just came in, and we've got about 3,000 bottles of PainMD,
[03:58:31.100 --> 03:58:35.100]  an incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[03:58:35.100 --> 03:58:38.100]  All three of these are back in stock, and they're incredible,
[03:58:38.100 --> 03:58:42.100]  and they fund our operation at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:58:46.100 --> 03:58:48.100]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce?
[03:58:48.100 --> 03:58:51.100]  Yeah. So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:58:51.100 --> 03:58:53.100]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:58:53.100 --> 03:58:57.100]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[03:58:57.100 --> 03:58:59.100]  and now two books with Alex Jones.
[03:58:59.100 --> 03:59:03.100]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[03:59:03.100 --> 03:59:07.100]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:59:07.100 --> 03:59:11.100]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:59:11.100 --> 03:59:16.100]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[03:59:16.100 --> 03:59:20.100]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[03:59:20.100 --> 03:59:24.100]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:59:24.100 --> 03:59:28.100]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day,
[03:59:28.100 --> 03:59:30.100]  and it helps me with my writing.
[03:59:30.100 --> 03:59:31.100]  All right. We love you. We'll be right back.
[03:59:31.100 --> 03:59:36.100]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:59:36.100 --> 03:59:38.100]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[03:59:38.100 --> 03:59:42.100]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
