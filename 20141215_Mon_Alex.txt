[00:00:06.178 --> 00:00:11.004]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:12.565]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:14.147]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:18.332]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:22.397]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.744 --> 00:00:33.067]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, December 15, 2014.
[00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:34.188]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:35.108]  I'll be your host today.
[00:00:35.108 --> 00:00:42.234]  And of course, for several hours, we've had quite a long siege in Sydney that has now ended.
[00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:56.526]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us later in the show, and he's going to talk about what's going on with that, give us an update, because we've heard now that the gunman has been killed, that hostages have been released, but we don't know yet
[00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:58.667]  If any hostages were killed in that.
[00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.389]  But what's behind that?
[00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:01.610]  How is that going to be used?
[00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.292]  We have an article up on Infowars.com from Kit Daniels.
[00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:10.176]  Former CIA chief says that ISIS is going to attack the US soon.
[00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:10.597]  There you go.
[00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:13.739]  So we don't know who this guy is.
[00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.321]  We've got an article up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:19.485]  Man responsible for taking Australian hostages is an Iranian mystic.
[00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:21.928]  He is not ISIS, not Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:21.928 --> 00:01:23.110]  Doesn't matter.
[00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.511]  We can still go with that, can't we?
[00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:29.517]  I mean, it doesn't matter that we were told that the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.
[00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:31.279]  We go attack Afghanistan or whatever.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.322]  We just need an excuse to go kick some butt.
[00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:36.803]  And it looks like maybe we'll get that from this.
[00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:37.303]  Who knows?
[00:01:37.303 --> 00:01:42.146]  Now, we're also going to take a look at the budget betrayal from John Boehner.
[00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:43.487]  What's behind that?
[00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:46.089]  And what does that show us about the future?
[00:01:46.957 --> 00:01:54.659]  There's a connection, I believe, to this collapse of the oil's future market that's being done by our ally, Saudi Arabia.
[00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.020]  Of course, they're the ally of the CIA.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.621]  Striking out at our domestic oil production.
[00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:03.982]  That's been a common basis for most of American foreign policy.
[00:02:04.662 --> 00:02:13.225]  That we have to have the free flow of oil at market prices, that we need to go to war to keep that coming to us from Saudi Arabia.
[00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:17.227]  The idea that we have peak oil, that we're not going to get any more oil.
[00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:21.188]  I remember back in the 70s we were told that we were going to be
[00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:24.169]  Completely out of oil by the 1980s.
[00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.850]  I've got the Time Magazine covers.
[00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.091]  I can't find them since I moved.
[00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:32.193]  I would show them to you on air, but they had long exposÃ©s about how we had reached peak oil.
[00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.154]  We weren't going to have any more oil.
[00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.235]  There was only so much oil in the ground.
[00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:37.615]  We had songs about it.
[00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:38.216]  I mean, it was...
[00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:39.977]  It was a certainty.
[00:02:39.977 --> 00:02:41.778]  We weren't going to get any more oil.
[00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:55.227]  Now that we have all of these new sources coming online, oil shale, fracking, all these different places where they've discovered even more oil, that has to be shut down before they can get up and producing.
[00:02:55.227 --> 00:02:57.148]  And that's what's behind this with Saudi Arabia.
[00:02:57.148 --> 00:03:00.691]  It's directly an attack on our energy independence.
[00:03:00.691 --> 00:03:03.273]  And that is an attack on our entire economy.
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.646]  It's also an attack at Russia because Russia's economy is natural resource based.
[00:03:10.646 --> 00:03:14.229]  They're trying to harm Russia in this at the same time.
[00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:29.722]  There's a lot behind this and we're going to be talking to Paul Craig Roberts, economist and political analysis about what's going on globally as far as the Cold War, the escalation behind that, what's behind all of this move in the price of oil, this attack by Saudi Arabia.
[00:03:29.722 --> 00:03:31.324]  Now they're being joined by the rest of OPEC.
[00:03:31.864 --> 00:03:33.245]  Is following along with them.
[00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:42.269]  They were being pretty much going it alone there at first, but now we have these other countries, the United Arab Emirates are signing on to this as well.
[00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.813]  And we see that there is something else that ties the Boehner betrayal to this price of oil, this drop.
[00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.614]  Why did they have to pass this bill so soon?
[00:03:52.614 --> 00:03:59.038]  Why did the Democrats, for example, why would they sign on to a situation that essentially betrays their base?
[00:04:00.057 --> 00:04:06.522]  Guaranteeing derivatives for these giant banks, undoing what they said they had done with the Dodd-Frank bill.
[00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:08.824]  I think there was a real emergency with this.
[00:04:08.824 --> 00:04:17.071]  I think they had to get into this very quickly because they were concerned this whole thing may be snowballing into another situation that looks very much like 2008.
[00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:23.336]  And they wanted to get their clients to send them the money, the large banks, they wanted to protect them.
[00:04:23.336 --> 00:04:28.119]  That's why Harry Reid and Obama had to fall on the sword and betray themselves to their
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.423]  To their voters, the Republicans essentially went along with it.
[00:04:32.423 --> 00:04:37.328]  They wanted to make this happen as well, but they could have waited a few months and let the Republicans take all the heat.
[00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:40.091]  No, they jumped in on it and took the heat with them.
[00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:43.394]  We're going to talk about why they had to do this so quickly.
[00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:44.495]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:00.905 --> 00:05:06.406]  As the year is coming to a close, we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the past year.
[00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.727]  We take a step back and thank God for what we have.
[00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:12.787]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:12.787 --> 00:05:18.988]  At Diamond Gusset, we are celebrating the brush fires of liberty that are spreading across this great nation.

[00:08:27.153 --> 00:08:28.433]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:28.433 --> 00:08:28.973]  I'm David Knight.
[00:08:28.973 --> 00:08:32.754]  On this Monday, December 15, 2014, I'll be your host today.
[00:08:32.754 --> 00:08:38.695]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us at the third hour to talk about this situation in Sydney.
[00:08:38.695 --> 00:08:40.876]  Of course, there's a lot to talk about with that.
[00:08:40.876 --> 00:08:42.016]  What's behind this?
[00:08:42.016 --> 00:08:43.836]  How is it going to be used?
[00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:46.077]  We have a couple of stories up on Infowars.com.
[00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:50.317]  The man responsible for taking Australian hostages is an Iranian mystic.
[00:08:50.317 --> 00:08:53.898]  Not ISIS, not Al-Qaeda, yet we also have a story up
[00:08:54.258 --> 00:08:57.661]  From Kit Daniels, former CIA chief, says ISIS will attack the U.S.
[00:08:57.661 --> 00:08:58.341]  soon.
[00:08:58.341 --> 00:09:02.585]  See, they can conflate these two things together, and hey, we just go off to war.
[00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:04.226]  So we're going to be talking to him about that.
[00:09:04.226 --> 00:09:08.330]  We're also going to be talking in the second hour to Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.693]  We're going to be talking about war, as well as the economy.
[00:09:12.693 --> 00:09:15.276]  And there's a lot happening in the wake of
[00:09:15.976 --> 00:09:22.181]  The budget betrayal from Boehner and the Republicans, as Matt Drudge tweeted out, Obama got everything.
[00:09:22.181 --> 00:09:25.823]  He said the NSA dirt on Boehner must be incredible.
[00:09:25.823 --> 00:09:27.585]  It's a Chicago win.
[00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:36.491]  Well, whatever's behind it, we've seen that Boehner's spending just over the last 3.8 years has been 3.8 trillion dollars.
[00:09:36.491 --> 00:09:39.033]  So, no constraints there whatsoever.
[00:09:39.033 --> 00:09:41.354]  And of course, I believe there's something else going on here.
[00:09:41.354 --> 00:09:42.275]  I think they're looking to
[00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:45.874]  Protect their corporate masters.
[00:09:45.874 --> 00:09:48.197]  We had Jamie Dimon of J.P.
[00:09:48.197 --> 00:09:53.023]  Morgan calling Congress, giving $5 million a year from J.P.
[00:09:53.023 --> 00:09:54.305]  Morgan, Citibank also.
[00:09:54.305 --> 00:09:56.588]  They wanted to get their derivatives insured.
[00:09:56.588 --> 00:09:58.790]  And we're going to talk about what's behind that.
[00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.494]  And it's also tied into the falling price of oil.
[00:10:02.455 --> 00:10:04.957]  The falling price of oil has many different aspects to it.
[00:10:04.957 --> 00:10:07.339]  There's a massive economic aspect to it.
[00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:17.286]  Is it the beginning of another major catastrophic economic implosion with speculation, as we saw with the mortgage market in 2008, yet even bigger?
[00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:21.429]  Is that what Boehner and the Democrats signed us on to cover?
[00:10:21.429 --> 00:10:25.652]  Of course, the entire derivatives market that they want to cover now is 1.2 quadrillion.
[00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:30.443]  And they got that for just a few million dollars.
[00:10:30.443 --> 00:10:39.208]  How would you like to be able to get insurance for one dollar, pay one dollar as a one-time fee, and you get a trillion dollars worth of life insurance?
[00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:40.689]  Does that sound like a good deal?
[00:10:40.689 --> 00:10:42.670]  That's essentially what the bank's got.
[00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:52.062]  And of course, you could say, well, no bank would ever, no insurance company would ever give you a trillion dollars worth of life insurance for a dollar because they know eventually they're going to have to pay up because you're going to die.
[00:10:52.062 --> 00:10:53.543]  Well, you know what?
[00:10:53.543 --> 00:11:02.186]  Eventually this balloon is going to burst and the American taxpayer is going to be on the hook for orders of magnitude more than we ever were.
[00:11:02.706 --> 00:11:05.507]  With the TARP bailout of the mortgages.
[00:11:05.507 --> 00:11:14.989]  They have leveraged and given away your wealth in order to protect these banks who want to do speculative investing with their derivatives.
[00:11:14.989 --> 00:11:26.311]  And this is all coming at a time that we see a massive implosion in commodity futures because of the attack on the oil industry by Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:30.992]  The attack on our oil industry, trying to shut down our domestic production.
[00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:37.659]  They can aim that dagger at our heart, and they can get us to ensure it at the same time.
[00:11:37.659 --> 00:11:40.019]  So the big boys have got themselves covered.
[00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:40.820]  It's all connected.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.560]  We're going to be talking to Paul Craig Roberts about that.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.722]  But before we do, there was a story that broke at the end of the day on Friday.
[00:11:49.696 --> 00:11:54.378]  We covered it on the nightly news and there were some more developments over the weekend.
[00:11:54.378 --> 00:12:08.325]  We have a clip of a police officer who is bragging about his new toy, his new MRAP toy, to someone who is videotaping him with their phone and talking about all of its capability and the person says, why do you need that?
[00:12:08.325 --> 00:12:10.606]  And he says, I need it for the Constitutionalists.
[00:12:10.606 --> 00:12:11.247]  Here's that clip.
[00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:23.122]  Well, the nice thing about this piece of equipment is that if somebody is directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in, they can pull right up to a friend.
[00:12:23.122 --> 00:12:28.267]  They can take enemy fire and still try to address threat without being afraid of getting shot.
[00:12:28.587 --> 00:12:33.250]  So I'm thinking that it's totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.531]  would you see that happening?
[00:12:34.531 --> 00:12:38.353]  We've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:12:38.353 --> 00:12:39.594]  A lot of ammunition.
[00:12:39.594 --> 00:12:41.254]  You hear that?
[00:12:41.254 --> 00:12:45.357]  We've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:12:45.357 --> 00:12:47.118]  A lot of ammunition.
[00:12:47.118 --> 00:12:51.260]  They have no weapons here locally.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.361]  There you go.
[00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:53.542]  We've heard that before, haven't we?
[00:12:54.062 --> 00:13:00.328]  Remember back in August of 2013 when they were talking about how the police chief there wanted these MRAPs?
[00:13:00.328 --> 00:13:06.013]  He said, well, we've got these dangerous libertarians around here and constitutionalists.
[00:13:06.013 --> 00:13:08.716]  Mikhail Phelan contacted.
[00:13:08.716 --> 00:13:12.500]  Now, this particular incident happened across the country in Washington.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.741]  Wow.
[00:13:13.741 --> 00:13:14.361]  How about that?
[00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:17.664]  You've got different police departments making really crazy claims
[00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:20.773]  All the way across the country.
[00:13:20.773 --> 00:13:22.274]  Where might that be coming from?
[00:13:22.274 --> 00:13:23.455]  Well, we know where that's coming from.
[00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:24.716]  It's coming from Homeland Security.
[00:13:24.716 --> 00:13:25.717]  It's coming from the FBI.
[00:13:25.717 --> 00:13:34.222]  They're having these training sessions where they train the local police that they have to watch out for anybody that talks about the Constitution because they're dangerous.
[00:13:34.222 --> 00:13:44.169]  They have to watch out about anybody that talks about rights because they're labeled a sovereign citizen and they're told that those type of people that they label that way are a direct threat on their life.
[00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:47.051]  We saw this right after the Bundy Ranch.
[00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:53.137]  We saw Glenn Beck wasting no time having, it was, that happened, that showdown happened on a Saturday.
[00:13:53.137 --> 00:14:01.986]  On that Monday he had Bundy on his show and one of the people on his show tried to hang the label of sovereign citizen on him.
[00:14:01.986 --> 00:14:04.528]  Bundy had no idea what he was talking about.
[00:14:04.528 --> 00:14:06.390]  We know what he was talking about.
[00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.072]  We know they were trying to essentially put a bounty on their head.
[00:14:09.893 --> 00:14:17.438]  Of course, police are trained that it's a war zone out there, that they have to shoot and shoot first if they want to come home to their families.
[00:14:17.438 --> 00:14:25.182]  And of course, the people that they are supposed to be the most afraid of are the ones that they label as sovereign citizens or constitutionalists.
[00:14:25.182 --> 00:14:26.283]  We've seen this over and over again.
[00:14:26.283 --> 00:14:32.226]  Now, Mikhail reached out to the Spokane County Sheriff's Office to try to get a comment.
[00:14:32.226 --> 00:14:37.870]  He wasn't able to get anybody there, but he was able to talk to the Spokane Valley Republican Representative Matthew Shea.
[00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.632]  And when he saw this footage, he was rightfully appalled.
[00:14:41.632 --> 00:14:44.955]  And here's what Republican Representative Matthew Shea said.
[00:14:44.955 --> 00:14:45.195]  He said,
[00:14:57.845 --> 00:15:01.008]  Means you are a traitor to this country.
[00:15:01.008 --> 00:15:06.133]  He said, this is spitting in the face of all the heroes who fought, bled and died so that we might live free.
[00:15:06.133 --> 00:15:11.478]  And the question is, why aren't you a constitutionalist, officer?
[00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:13.260]  Why don't you believe in the rule of law?
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.121]  Why don't you believe the Constitution means what it says?
[00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:18.662]  And of course, we've seen this over and over again.
[00:15:18.662 --> 00:15:23.544]  As Mikhail goes down, he points out the many, many times we've seen this in Indiana.
[00:15:23.544 --> 00:15:28.786]  We saw returning military veterans labeled as domestic threats by Homeland Security in 2009.
[00:15:28.786 --> 00:15:33.789]  We saw the MIAC report as well, the Fusion Center report that was leaked to InfoWars back in 2009.
[00:15:35.289 --> 00:15:59.998]  labeling people who supported Ron Paul as being someone who was an extremist group somebody they should be wary of if you had a bumper sticker on your car for Ron Paul or for Baldwin that was somebody that the police should basically take the safety off of their gun when they pull you over because they've been told that you might get out of the car shooting and of course we also saw this back in New Hampshire we had a army veteran
[00:16:00.911 --> 00:16:06.679]  Who, I don't know if it was Army or the Marines, but anyway, he was a high-ranking colonel or lieutenant colonel.
[00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:09.643]  He came in here and talked to us, actually, afterwards, but he questioned this.
[00:16:09.643 --> 00:16:13.027]  He said, why do they need to be this heavily armed?
[00:16:13.027 --> 00:16:16.892]  We weren't that heavily armed when we were fighting a war abroad.
[00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:18.875]  That's where this is coming from now.
[00:16:20.863 --> 00:16:26.304]  We also have an article from the AP that's up on Drudge Report.
[00:16:26.304 --> 00:16:30.365]  Texas ways allowing open carry of handguns.
[00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:37.747]  They're pointing out that Texas, you may not believe it, but Texas is one of the few states with an outright ban on open carry of handguns.
[00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:48.789]  And they point to the fact that the governor-elect Greg Abbott said on the first day after his election last month, he said, if open carry is good enough for Massachusetts, it's good enough for the state of Texas.
[00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:56.154]  And of course they're talking about the, they have one quote from a lady who's a 63-year-old rancher in Blanco, that's out in the hill country here.
[00:16:56.154 --> 00:17:03.319]  She carries a handgun in her purse, she says for protection, but she'd like to carry it on her side as she does when she's on her ranch.
[00:17:03.319 --> 00:17:12.445]  She points out, in one and a half seconds, a man can run 25 feet with a knife in his hand and stab you before you can get your gun out if it's concealed.
[00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:20.447]  But I think the most interesting quote out of this article was the one from the representative, Jonathan Strickland, Republican from Bedford, Texas.
[00:17:20.447 --> 00:17:29.009]  Although most of the open carry bills that have been filed for the upcoming season would still require a license, he would eliminate the licensing requirement.
[00:17:29.009 --> 00:17:31.170]  And here's the quote from that representative.
[00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:35.651]  He said, the idea is that we're going to return to our Second Amendment rights.
[00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:39.014]  There's a difference between a right and a privilege.
[00:17:39.014 --> 00:17:48.085]  He said, I can't imagine what citizens would do if they had to take a class or pay a fee to use their First Amendment rights.
[00:17:48.085 --> 00:17:49.607]  Think about that.
[00:17:49.607 --> 00:17:50.928]  Do you understand?
[00:17:50.928 --> 00:17:52.530]  First Amendment rights are there.
[00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.872]  You don't have to pay a fee.
[00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:55.173]  You don't have to take a class.
[00:17:56.533 --> 00:18:09.804]  If we have Second Amendment rights, if we have the right to protect ourselves from criminals acting individually or from criminals acting collectively together called a government, then that is not a privilege.
[00:18:09.804 --> 00:18:15.128]  It becomes a privilege if you have to take a class or if you have to pay a fee.
[00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:18.291]  Now, of course, we've already seen our tyrannical government
[00:18:18.911 --> 00:18:24.438]  Kind of ruminate over the idea that maybe the First Amendment should be a privilege and not a fundamental right.
[00:18:24.438 --> 00:18:27.622]  Talking about licensing journalists.
[00:18:27.622 --> 00:18:38.214]  We even talked about it last week how in Japan Prime Minister Abe has just put in a prison sentence of 10 years if somebody in government
[00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:44.519]  Lisa leaks information as a whistleblower and the journalist who reports it gets a five-year sentence.
[00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:46.520]  Now here's the interesting thing.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.724]  He says we have to do this so we can share information with our US ally.
[00:18:52.724 --> 00:19:00.168]  See, that pressure is coming from America to do those kinds of prison sentences for whistleblowers, to put
[00:19:01.092 --> 00:19:06.437]  Ten years, and the government employee in for ten years, and the reporter in for five years.
[00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:12.923]  But we've also had our own government talking about how perhaps they need to license journalists.
[00:19:12.923 --> 00:19:21.050]  And of course, you're not a real journalist unless you work for a mainstream media organization, or have a license, or have some kind of a degree.
[00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.471]  That simply isn't true.
[00:19:22.471 --> 00:19:23.772]  We've talked about that many times.
[00:19:24.813 --> 00:19:28.236]  We also have another on an article about abortion.
[00:19:28.236 --> 00:19:32.339]  We have an abortion doctor that's arrested after not killing babies.
[00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.160]  We're going to talk about that right after we come back.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.521]  It's a story from New American.
[00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:44.328]  He was actually telling women that they were pregnant so he could give them expensive drugs, which themselves are very, very dangerous.
[00:19:44.328 --> 00:19:44.748]  Stay with us.
[00:19:44.748 --> 00:19:45.329]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:03.179]  This hour brought to you by katiarmor.com.

[00:20:15.094 --> 00:20:17.435]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[00:20:17.435 --> 00:20:22.136]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:32.858]  Managing your business and customers isn't easy, huh?

[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:39.700]  We're good.
[00:20:59.609 --> 00:21:01.551]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:05.174]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:21:05.174 --> 00:21:06.535]  A pair of scissors.
[00:21:06.535 --> 00:21:12.320]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.244]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:21:17.244 --> 00:21:18.225]  The phone line.
[00:21:18.225 --> 00:21:23.489]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:21:23.489 --> 00:21:27.232]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:21:27.372 --> 00:21:30.696]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:21:30.696 --> 00:21:33.160]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:38.607]  Scissors can't cut it.
[00:21:38.607 --> 00:21:41.070]  And that means your home stays safe.
[00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.655]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.

[00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:01.160]  What disaster is so powerful?
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.521]  It unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots.
[00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:07.941]  All at the same time.
[00:22:07.941 --> 00:22:10.042]  NASA has already set the countdown timer.
[00:22:10.342 --> 00:22:15.043]  And right now, the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:18.524]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[00:22:18.524 --> 00:22:20.185]  population could perish.
[00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:23.646]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:22:23.646 --> 00:22:25.886]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:27.527]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:22:27.527 --> 00:22:29.707]  Ancient diseases will reemerge.
[00:22:29.707 --> 00:22:33.788]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[00:22:33.788 --> 00:22:39.470]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,
[00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:44.195]  And even your entire community, when this worst case scenario unravels.
[00:22:44.195 --> 00:22:49.099]  That's D-A-R-K-E-S-T-D-A-Y-S dot I-N-F-O.
[00:22:49.099 --> 00:22:51.121]  DarkestDays.info.
[00:22:51.121 --> 00:22:56.006]  Go there before this life-saving information becomes unavailable to the large public.
[00:22:56.006 --> 00:22:58.169]  Go to DarkestDays.info now.
[00:22:58.979 --> 00:23:05.042]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[00:23:05.042 --> 00:23:10.805]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed tissue environment.
[00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:18.008]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate inflammation, and feed beneficial bacteria.
[00:23:18.008 --> 00:23:27.073]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[00:23:27.233 --> 00:23:30.255]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.
[00:23:30.255 --> 00:23:39.840]  One World Whey is a whey protein food that supports detoxification, repair of tissues, and elimination of inflammation, healthy pH, and growth of beneficial bacteria.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.903]  One World Whey is duly reformulated to be higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate.
[00:23:43.903 --> 00:23:49.966]  We believe One World Whey is an excellent food to support your efforts to create a healthy internal body environment.
[00:23:49.966 --> 00:23:50.267]  Call 888

[00:24:14.142 --> 00:24:15.584]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:15.584 --> 00:24:16.425]  I'm David Knight.
[00:24:16.425 --> 00:24:18.548]  On this Monday, December 15, 2015... 14.
[00:24:18.548 --> 00:24:22.754]  We're getting really close to 2015, aren't we?
[00:24:22.754 --> 00:24:25.157]  We've only got a couple of weeks left.
[00:24:25.157 --> 00:24:30.844]  I was talking about the abortion doctor just before we went to break, and I want to get back to that story, but before I do, real quickly...
[00:24:31.565 --> 00:24:36.468]  We have X2, Survival Shield X2, at Infowarslife.com.
[00:24:36.468 --> 00:24:39.609]  This is our first sale ever on X2.
[00:24:39.609 --> 00:24:41.670]  It's 17% off, free shipping.
[00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:46.793]  It was $29.99, now it's $24.99, but without the free shipping, you would have paid $38.
[00:24:46.793 --> 00:24:51.115]  This is a sale that's going to run only through next Monday.
[00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:55.897]  And of course, if you get it within the next two days, Christmas delivery is guaranteed.
[00:24:55.897 --> 00:24:56.458]  Now, of course,
[00:24:57.378 --> 00:25:02.480]  CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.301]  Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct.
[00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:17.865]  And of course, with Survival Shield X2, it's approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation, created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:25:17.865 --> 00:25:21.466]  That Survival Shield X2, on sale right now, as I pointed out,
[00:25:22.026 --> 00:25:25.450]  With the free shipping and the discount, you would have paid $38 to get it now.
[00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.654]  It's on sale for $24.99 through next Monday.
[00:25:28.654 --> 00:25:33.099]  Now just before the break, we were talking about the story from the New American.
[00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:38.745]  It's an Oklahoma abortion doctor who was arrested for not killing babies.
[00:25:39.699 --> 00:25:52.145]  Interestingly enough, what his scam was, was to examine women, to tell them that they were pregnant, then to give them RU486 at $600, let's see, what was the amount here?
[00:25:52.145 --> 00:25:56.106]  It was over $600 that they were charged in each one of these cases.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:07.827]  Keep in mind, they point out, that RU486, even when it's used as approved by the FDA to induce abortion, is known to cause hemorrhaging.
[00:26:07.827 --> 00:26:11.309]  In some cases, so much so that they need to have medical intervention.
[00:26:11.309 --> 00:26:13.611]  Yet, he's willing to do this to women.
[00:26:14.091 --> 00:26:14.712]  I don't know.
[00:26:30.823 --> 00:26:37.768]  He was admitted in 1992 to dumping and burning 55 aborted babies near Shawnee, Oklahoma.
[00:26:37.768 --> 00:26:44.773]  No charges were filed then, but he was arrested in 1993 after a former patient accused him of molestation.
[00:26:44.773 --> 00:26:51.317]  He was charged with one count each of forcible sexual battery, and two other women came forward and testified against him.
[00:26:51.317 --> 00:26:54.339]  But, of course, this guy is still walking free, isn't he?
[00:26:55.165 --> 00:27:00.316]  You know, it's interesting to see who gets immunity and who gets it for what.
[00:27:01.345 --> 00:27:14.876]  Now we pointed out that one of Obama's executive orders a few weeks ago was to give amnesty to anybody that, any corporations that went to Ebola countries and happened to bring it back into America and infect other people.
[00:27:14.876 --> 00:27:19.160]  He gave them legal immunity from being sued.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.183]  Now he's doing the same thing for big pharmaceutical companies.
[00:27:23.183 --> 00:27:24.985]  He's given them legal immunity
[00:27:25.545 --> 00:27:28.829]  From future lawsuits over the new Ebola vaccine.
[00:27:28.829 --> 00:27:31.392]  Of course they're rushing this to market.
[00:27:31.392 --> 00:27:36.998]  They don't want to wait for tests that they would normally do to check for the safety of something.
[00:27:36.998 --> 00:27:39.661]  Not even doing any tests for the efficacy of it.
[00:27:40.282 --> 00:27:52.370]  But of course, they're getting all the groundwork laid to roll this out in a massive way, perhaps requiring people to get it once they introduce and bring back a lot of Ebola.
[00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:57.614]  If they were to do that, they could require medical workers, for starters, to get this vaccine.
[00:28:00.996 --> 00:28:01.757]  Side effects?
[00:28:01.757 --> 00:28:05.500]  These big pharmaceutical companies are not going to be held responsible.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.942]  Obama has given them immunity.
[00:28:07.942 --> 00:28:20.453]  But of course if it makes things worse, if it spreads the disease, if it is totally ineffective, you won't have any legal recourse against these companies that are in bed with the administration.
[00:28:20.453 --> 00:28:21.534]  And talking about immunity,
[00:28:22.415 --> 00:28:28.305]  Dick Cheney says, I'd do it again in a minute, and of course he's talking about torture.
[00:28:28.305 --> 00:28:34.556]  And that's exactly why he and others need to go to jail, because they will do it again.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.244]  And they'll do it worse again, and they'll be more open about it again.
[00:28:40.244 --> 00:28:42.506]  We've seen the same thing going on with the NSA.
[00:28:42.506 --> 00:28:48.490]  We had the leaks from Snowden that verified what we've been talking about for over a decade, for a couple of decades.
[00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.232]  How they were spying on us, how they were collecting our records.
[00:28:51.232 --> 00:28:52.754]  We've had whistleblowers.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:29:03.112]  Ten years ago, we had William Binney and others who resigned, and the government came after those whistleblowers, and they were telling us at the time what was happening.
[00:29:03.112 --> 00:29:05.715]  Nobody paid any attention until the Snowden leaks.
[00:29:05.715 --> 00:29:12.423]  Once they paid attention to the Snowden leaks, now we've got our Congress passing a law that essentially says, that's fine.
[00:29:13.004 --> 00:29:14.124]  We're going to go ahead and do it.
[00:29:14.124 --> 00:29:17.365]  Essentially giving the NSA immunity to spy on us.
[00:29:17.365 --> 00:29:22.966]  So they give Cheney and the CIA essentially immunity to torture people because they don't get punished.
[00:29:22.966 --> 00:29:24.247]  That's the message.
[00:29:24.247 --> 00:29:27.908]  We have the police who have immunity from police brutality.
[00:29:27.908 --> 00:29:31.048]  We have the NSA that has immunity against surveillance.
[00:29:31.048 --> 00:29:32.709]  Do you see a problem here?
[00:29:32.709 --> 00:29:33.389]  Do you see a pattern?
[00:29:33.989 --> 00:29:39.953]  We have laid the foundation and presumed to make it legal for absolute tyranny in America.
[00:29:39.953 --> 00:29:40.373]  Stay with us.
[00:29:40.373 --> 00:29:46.237]  We're going to be right back talking about economics and oil, and we're going to have Paul Craig Roberts joining us at the next hour.
[00:29:46.237 --> 00:29:49.139]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.139 --> 00:29:50.540]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.082]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.082 --> 00:29:55.764]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.397 --> 00:30:07.724]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[00:30:07.724 --> 00:30:11.668]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[00:30:11.668 --> 00:30:18.114]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with OxyPowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[00:30:18.114 --> 00:30:23.939]  Using super oxygenation, OxyPowder, available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body.
[00:30:24.099 --> 00:30:26.340]  While you sleep with easy capsules.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:32.424]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used Oxy-Powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[00:30:32.424 --> 00:30:38.068]  Even InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using Oxy-Powder with incredible success.
[00:30:38.068 --> 00:30:40.569]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[00:30:40.569 --> 00:30:41.870]  Twelve pounds melted off.
[00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.211]  In about a week, I'd say a week.
[00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:43.651]  Seven days.
[00:30:44.211 --> 00:30:45.952]  2015 can be different.
[00:30:45.952 --> 00:30:49.153]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[00:30:49.153 --> 00:30:51.374]  Oxy Powder flushes it out.
[00:30:51.374 --> 00:30:54.356]  Secure your Oxy Powder at Infowarslife.com.

[00:31:28.551 --> 00:31:29.951]  No needles, no injections.
[00:31:29.951 --> 00:31:34.172]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[00:31:34.172 --> 00:31:43.534]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic, proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true, nutraceutical quality Vitamin B12.

[00:32:00.694 --> 00:32:04.736]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super male.
[00:32:04.736 --> 00:32:06.716]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:09.678]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[00:32:09.678 --> 00:32:11.358]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:11.358 --> 00:32:13.719]  You've heard the callers of the show.

[00:33:17.213 --> 00:33:23.996]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.996 --> 00:33:28.478]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.478 --> 00:33:30.239]  I'm David Knight on this December 15th, 2014.
[00:33:33.121 --> 00:33:48.281]  Now as we were just talking about immunity that's been granted to the CIA torturers, we talk about the immunity that's being granted to the big pharmaceutical companies for the vaccines that they're developing for Ebola and not testing for either safety or efficacy.
[00:33:49.061 --> 00:33:50.362]  We don't know if they work.
[00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:52.184]  We don't know what effects they're going to have on people.
[00:33:52.184 --> 00:33:55.926]  We just got to get this thing out there and presumably force people to do it.
[00:33:55.926 --> 00:33:58.148]  And if they've got any side effects, that's all right.
[00:33:58.148 --> 00:33:59.249]  We've got that taken care of.
[00:33:59.249 --> 00:34:04.653]  And then we talked about, before that, an abortion doctor who has been in trouble with the law many, many times.
[00:34:04.653 --> 00:34:17.022]  And now he's been arrested in Oklahoma as part of a sting, telling women who are not pregnant that they were pregnant and then selling them RU-486, which is a very, very serious pharmaceutical.
[00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:29.112]  Can induce hemorrhaging, can induce all kinds of side effects, and of course it also has another side effect, and that is it generates a lot of wealth for the people who are selling it, especially this abortionist.
[00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:36.724]  And of course we're talking about the immunity that the police have from brutality that they are inflicting on people.
[00:34:36.724 --> 00:34:39.606]  We've got yet another example of this today.
[00:34:39.606 --> 00:34:44.630]  Over the weekend we have a story of a 76-year-old man in Texas.
[00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:59.042]  The Texas police officer was placed on administrative leave, I guess that's a code word for vacation with pay, on Friday after he reportedly used a taser on a 76-year-old man after the suspect had already been forced to the ground.
[00:34:59.662 --> 00:35:06.328]  And if you look at this picture of the Victoria police officer from the dash cam footage, it's a still.
[00:35:06.328 --> 00:35:07.729]  This is not a black man.
[00:35:07.729 --> 00:35:09.310]  This is a white man.
[00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:10.631]  This is the problem.
[00:35:10.631 --> 00:35:13.754]  It is not a black-white issue.
[00:35:13.754 --> 00:35:22.901]  Of course, we had tens of thousands of people across the country demonstrating against police brutality in Washington, New York, Boston, California.
[00:35:22.901 --> 00:35:24.803]  They were protesting, as Reuters says, the
[00:35:26.204 --> 00:35:29.349]  Killing of unarmed black men by police officers.
[00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:33.216]  Well, I hope they understood that the problem is much bigger than that.
[00:35:34.033 --> 00:35:39.136]  And of course we've had the relatives of Eric Garner publicly speak out.
[00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:40.316]  His wife.
[00:35:40.316 --> 00:35:42.718]  I think it was a cousin that contacted Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:35:42.718 --> 00:35:46.179]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be with us, by the way, in the third hour.
[00:35:46.179 --> 00:35:50.962]  But they made the point that this is not simply about black on white.
[00:35:50.962 --> 00:35:52.783]  This is a much larger issue.
[00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:59.806]  It is not going to be solved by adjusting the ratios of white to black police officers.
[00:35:59.806 --> 00:36:02.047]  This is about the way they're being trained.
[00:36:02.047 --> 00:36:02.488]  And of course
[00:36:03.208 --> 00:36:06.989]  There's another aspect of this that is even more dangerous.
[00:36:06.989 --> 00:36:22.892]  Every time they try to defend the MRAP system, this 1033 system that the Pentagon has set up for surplus equipment, every time they start defending that, of course, they do it on the basis of saying they need this for the libertarians, for the constitutionalists.
[00:36:22.892 --> 00:36:26.753]  We just had, played earlier in the show, the clip from the
[00:36:27.705 --> 00:36:32.271]  A police officer who was being questioned by somebody who was recording it said, you know, tell us about this.
[00:36:32.271 --> 00:36:38.740]  And he's going on about all these capabilities of this MRAP, and they said, well, why do you need that in America?
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:43.006]  And he goes, well, we've got these constitutionalists, and they've got a lot of ammunition and arms, and they're here locally.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.601]  That's what they're being told.
[00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:48.502]  That's what's coming out of Washington D.C.
[00:36:48.502 --> 00:36:54.745]  The FBI, Homeland Security, they're the ones who are driving that notion home with your local police.
[00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:57.607]  That's all part of the militarization of the police.
[00:36:57.607 --> 00:37:06.571]  As we pointed out many times, it was earlier this month that they stopped a program that gave fire departments surplus military equipment.
[00:37:06.571 --> 00:37:08.792]  That had been going on for 60 years.
[00:37:08.792 --> 00:37:10.013]  They shut it down and they said, well,
[00:37:11.233 --> 00:37:19.396]  We're not going to give that to you anymore because we're going to now start enforcing an EPA regulation that they hadn't enforced for 25 years about clean air.
[00:37:19.396 --> 00:37:31.300]  Presumably it was better to let the large forests burn than to give these small rural fire departments a helping hand with equipment so they could put those fires out because they're typically the ones on the front lines.
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:39.403]  They're usually the ones who get that done and for a couple of weeks it looked like that was going to happen until they organized and got that pushed back and so now they've sustained
[00:37:40.023 --> 00:37:44.029]  That program for the fire department, apparently.
[00:37:44.029 --> 00:37:50.037]  But at the same time, this program where they give the police the MRAPs, they're telling everybody that's for emergencies.
[00:37:51.169 --> 00:37:53.111]  You understand the difference there?
[00:37:53.111 --> 00:38:02.399]  Why does the police department need that and yet the fire department doesn't need these vehicles to get them back into the wilderness areas to put out wildfires?
[00:38:02.399 --> 00:38:04.841]  Absolutely incredible that they would do this.
[00:38:04.841 --> 00:38:07.084]  Not believable in that sense.
[00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:08.985]  Not believable for a moment.
[00:38:08.985 --> 00:38:11.668]  Now, going back to this story about this Texas police officer.
[00:38:12.742 --> 00:38:19.825]  When he pulled over this 76-year-old man, Pete Vasquez, he was driving back a vehicle to this car lot.
[00:38:19.825 --> 00:38:21.946]  It was a dealer vehicle.
[00:38:21.946 --> 00:38:23.106]  It had dealer tags.
[00:38:23.106 --> 00:38:27.068]  He tried to explain that it was exempt from needing an inspection.
[00:38:27.068 --> 00:38:29.389]  Evidently, the officer didn't like that.
[00:38:30.849 --> 00:38:44.379]  He slammed him in the hood of the patrol car, says the two men disappeared from camera range as the officer, Robinson, places Vasquez in a hole and then forces him to the ground and then tasered him.
[00:38:44.379 --> 00:38:48.081]  And the 76-year-old man said, he acted like a pit bull.
[00:38:48.081 --> 00:38:51.444]  For a while, I thought he was going to pull his gun and shoot me.
[00:38:51.444 --> 00:38:57.308]  Now, the response that has come out is the police chief has offered a personal apology.
[00:38:57.308 --> 00:38:58.909]  Is that enough?
[00:38:58.909 --> 00:38:59.630]  Is that really enough?
[00:39:00.529 --> 00:39:01.670]  I don't think so.
[00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:10.754]  Now, Larry Ulrich, who works as a sales manager at the Car Lot, told the paper, he said, he should be fired from the force and prosecuted.
[00:39:10.754 --> 00:39:11.955]  See, that's just it.
[00:39:11.955 --> 00:39:22.280]  If we're going to allow the CIA to torture people and not ever prosecute them, if we're going to allow the police to brutalize people and not ever prosecute them, you're going to get more of it.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.061]  And that's exactly what Dick Cheney said.
[00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:26.282]  He said, I'd do it again in a minute.
[00:39:26.282 --> 00:39:26.562]  You bet.
[00:39:27.372 --> 00:39:31.213]  And so with the police, because they know they're going to get away with the brutality.
[00:39:31.213 --> 00:39:36.754]  And until you stop this, it's going to, by prosecuting somebody, they're getting the message.
[00:39:36.754 --> 00:39:56.617]  Not only are they being trained to recognize everyone who opposes the government politically or has something to say about it as a constitutionalist, not only are they being trained to see them as the enemy, not only are they being trained to see everybody out there that's not wearing a uniform and a badge as a potential assassin, they're being told that they can get away with it.
[00:39:57.625 --> 00:40:04.588]  Now in the next hour we're going to be joined by Paul Craig Roberts, economist and analyst of political situations.
[00:40:04.588 --> 00:40:10.391]  We're going to talk to him about the increasing risk of war and what's going on with the economy.
[00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:18.695]  And there have been major, major tectonic moves in this last week with this budget that was pushed through by the Republicans.
[00:40:21.033 --> 00:40:28.058]  Matt Drudge pointed out Obama got everything he wanted and he said maybe there's a lot of NSA dirt on Boehner.
[00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:31.460]  Or maybe Boehner is just working for the bankers.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.781]  Maybe he's working for the U.S.
[00:40:32.781 --> 00:40:36.323]  Chamber of Commerce who wants open borders.
[00:40:36.323 --> 00:40:39.726]  Maybe he's working for the banks who want to have you, the taxpayer,
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.845]  Cover their derivatives again using FDIC insurance.
[00:40:44.845 --> 00:40:50.552]  Only these are much bigger derivatives than we have seen in the past with the mortgage.
[00:40:50.552 --> 00:40:53.436]  Now they're coming for the whole enchilada.
[00:40:53.436 --> 00:40:57.581]  And if we look at this budget, this continuing resolution, they just put through 1.1 trillion dollars.
[00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.315]  Economic Policy Journal points out that the longest U.S.
[00:41:03.315 --> 00:41:09.324]  war, that would be the war in Afghanistan, has already cost us $1 trillion.
[00:41:09.324 --> 00:41:10.666]  Think about that.
[00:41:10.666 --> 00:41:13.450]  That's how much the war in Afghanistan has cost taxpayers.
[00:41:14.631 --> 00:41:19.933]  Something that would run this massive, bloated, unconstitutional government for a full year.
[00:41:19.933 --> 00:41:23.034]  That's what we have spent on the war in Afghanistan alone.
[00:41:23.034 --> 00:41:26.015]  That's not counting the war in Iraq or anything else that they're doing.
[00:41:26.015 --> 00:41:35.438]  I think we need to start talking about not war hawks, but maybe war porks, because that's really what's behind these perpetual wars.
[00:41:35.438 --> 00:41:38.599]  It's the military-industrial complex getting their subsidy.
[00:41:39.339 --> 00:41:47.462]  And of course the news that came out last week, we saw one GOP representative say that Boehner actually lied to him to get his vote.
[00:41:47.462 --> 00:41:49.342]  They wanted to move this to a vote.
[00:41:49.342 --> 00:41:53.504]  They were told they were just going to get a short-term continuing resolution and when he
[00:41:54.404 --> 00:41:54.985]  We're good to go.
[00:42:16.847 --> 00:42:19.390]  With a much larger majority in the House.
[00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:24.716]  No, they never had any intention of following through on any of that.
[00:42:24.716 --> 00:42:26.839]  So, what's going on with that?
[00:42:26.839 --> 00:42:35.309]  As we see the government going in and pulling back and ensuring the derivatives again, understand where this all came from initially.
[00:42:36.653 --> 00:42:41.197]  Remember that back in the Great Depression, of course there was a pump and dump element to it.
[00:42:41.197 --> 00:42:47.684]  Of course there was an element to it where they would inflate assets, then burst the bubble and then come back in and buy the assets on the cheap.
[00:42:47.684 --> 00:42:49.746]  The bankers have always done that.
[00:42:49.746 --> 00:42:52.488]  But the mechanism that they used for that were options.
[00:42:53.456 --> 00:42:53.716]  Fine.
[00:43:12.117 --> 00:43:20.165]  Keeping checking and savings accounts and making safe collateralized loans like real estate or cars, that sort of thing.
[00:43:20.165 --> 00:43:25.391]  So they put Glass-Steagall there to force the banks to divest themselves from these risky businesses.
[00:43:26.431 --> 00:43:31.437]  That's the way things continued until, under Clinton, Glass-Steagall was repealed.
[00:43:31.437 --> 00:43:45.374]  And then in very rapid secession, the bankers created MERS, a construct that allowed them to break the chain of title in mortgages so they could collateralize them and sell them as securities.
[00:43:45.874 --> 00:44:09.539]  They also created REMIX, which allowed them to, that was created back in 1986, but then they created different ways to use these mechanisms that had never been done before, and it didn't take very long for them to create the massive unsecured mortgage bubble, which basically ripped off investors at the same time that it took a lot of people's homes because they
[00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:17.621]  They punctured that bubble, leaving a lot of people so far underwater that they couldn't refinance their homes.
[00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:23.348]  Now, in response to that, they come out with Dodd-Frank, which is supposed to then break that apart again to some degree.
[00:44:23.348 --> 00:44:27.832]  Not a full reenactment of Glass-Steagall, but at least moving some of these derivatives away from the banks.
[00:44:28.834 --> 00:44:29.335]  That's great.
[00:44:43.809 --> 00:44:52.097]  Now, thanks to Boehner and the Democrats, you will make them whole if these gambling casino derivatives don't hold up.
[00:44:52.097 --> 00:44:55.580]  And the question is, why would they do this now?
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:00.665]  Why would the Democrats anger their base, alienate their base?
[00:45:00.665 --> 00:45:07.311]  So it looks like the only one who is making any capital off of this is coming up against Hillary Clinton.
[00:45:08.812 --> 00:45:15.614]  Obama, as well as Harry Reid, and the rest of them are falling on the sword, essentially, to push this through very quickly.
[00:45:15.614 --> 00:45:17.615]  Well, here's an idea.
[00:45:17.615 --> 00:45:25.877]  These derivatives are already starting to snowball into something that could be very serious, and we're going to talk to Paul Craig Roberts about this in the next hour.
[00:45:25.877 --> 00:45:30.719]  There's a headline here from David Stockman's ContraCorner.com.
[00:45:30.719 --> 00:45:31.259]  Here's the headline.
[00:45:31.259 --> 00:45:34.320]  He said, here comes Wall Street's latest toxic waste.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:43.063]  Oil-linked notes, which blow up under $80 per barrel prices.
[00:45:43.063 --> 00:45:45.344]  I think this is what's really behind this.
[00:45:45.344 --> 00:45:46.664]  This is why they couldn't wait.
[00:45:46.664 --> 00:45:48.425]  This is why they needed to do it right away.
[00:45:48.425 --> 00:45:55.547]  And he points out, in the mid-2000s, it was a massive one-way leverage bet that house prices would never go down.
[00:45:55.547 --> 00:46:02.170]  In the mid-2000s, it became a leveraged one-way bet that commodity prices, like oil, would never go down.
[00:46:02.895 --> 00:46:04.683]  But now they are going down.
[00:46:04.683 --> 00:46:05.206]  And guess what?
[00:46:06.283 --> 00:46:08.224]  It's not a natural decline.
[00:46:08.224 --> 00:46:14.067]  This is something that is being engineered by the CIA's ally, Saudi Arabia.
[00:46:14.067 --> 00:46:18.169]  Now the obvious thing is that they're coming after our domestic oil production.
[00:46:18.169 --> 00:46:28.174]  We've got a lot of new ways to produce oil, a lot of new discoveries, but of course getting the oil from oil shale, also using fracking, that is something that is competition for the Saudis.
[00:46:28.174 --> 00:46:35.178]  So they obviously have a economic interest to try to put their competition out of business and this is what
[00:46:35.658 --> 00:46:39.541]  Big companies always do to small retailers or to small companies.
[00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:46.666]  They'll come in and they'll operate at a loss for a while until they can drive their competitors out of business and then they've got a monopoly again.
[00:46:46.666 --> 00:46:48.407]  So that's one aspect of it.
[00:46:48.407 --> 00:46:53.130]  But of course that is driving out American producers of oil.
[00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:57.473]  That is making us dependent on Saudi Arabia fully again.
[00:46:57.473 --> 00:47:04.077]  And of course it is also aimed at Russia as part of the larger Cold War that is being renewed.
[00:47:04.918 --> 00:47:13.562]  But he points out here, nothing says exuberant ignorance like limited upside and unlimited downside over-the-counter derivatives.
[00:47:13.562 --> 00:47:15.583]  And that's what we're seeing right here.
[00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:19.804]  He says the question is, who is on the other side of all of these notes?
[00:47:19.804 --> 00:47:21.825]  The snowball is already starting.
[00:47:21.825 --> 00:47:27.848]  And you can see that as the credit spreads have started to bleed higher and higher.
[00:47:27.848 --> 00:47:32.390]  Now, a story up from Business Insider says the weekend is over and crude oil is falling.
[00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:42.020]  They said this morning that it had fallen over the weekend 1% and it was down more than 2% earlier in the evening last night.
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.244]  So this is something that is unfolding.
[00:47:45.244 --> 00:47:47.326]  It is all connected.
[00:47:48.464 --> 00:47:55.446]  The insurance of derivatives for the larger banks and these derivatives that are starting to come unraveled.
[00:47:55.446 --> 00:47:57.606]  Listen to this article from Zero Hedge.
[00:47:57.606 --> 00:48:10.210]  They point out that the severity of the decline in these Middle Eastern stock markets, which are now basically taking a bloodbath, that's their headlines, they said that in Dubai, the stock market is down 7.5%, extending Thursday's 7.5% route, 7.4%.
[00:48:14.931 --> 00:48:23.939]  Abu Dhabi was down 3.6%, Qatar slid 5.9%, Kuwait 2.9%, and Saudi's market, the largest in the region, retreated 3.3%.
[00:48:23.939 --> 00:48:26.342]  So their stock markets are plunging.
[00:48:26.342 --> 00:48:27.663]  Why are they plunging?
[00:48:27.663 --> 00:48:29.684]  Well, because people are selling off their
[00:48:30.345 --> 00:48:31.686]  Derivatives.
[00:48:31.686 --> 00:48:32.287]  There you go.
[00:48:32.287 --> 00:48:33.348]  It's the derivatives.
[00:48:33.348 --> 00:48:37.792]  It's the same thing that we saw back in 2008.
[00:48:37.792 --> 00:48:43.697]  The story that's up on Infowars.com, we just witnessed the worst week for global financial markets in three years.
[00:48:43.697 --> 00:48:51.003]  And he points out that in the summer of 2008, here's the pattern, here's what you need to worry about, because this is a snowball that is starting to roll down the hill.
[00:48:51.003 --> 00:48:55.347]  He says in the summer of 2008, the price of oil utterly collapsed.
[00:48:55.347 --> 00:48:56.708]  We all remember what happened after that.
[00:48:57.449 --> 00:49:01.855]  Well, the same patterns that we're witnessing back in 2008 are happening again.
[00:49:01.855 --> 00:49:08.063]  As the price of oil crashed in 2008, so did prices for a whole host of other commodities.
[00:49:08.063 --> 00:49:10.446]  And that is also happening yet again.
[00:49:11.716 --> 00:49:17.238]  Once commodities started crashing, the market for junk bonds started to implode.
[00:49:17.238 --> 00:49:18.778]  That is also happening again.
[00:49:18.778 --> 00:49:23.480]  Finally, toward the end of 2008, we witnessed a horrifying stock market crash.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.001]  Could we be on the verge of another one of those?
[00:49:26.001 --> 00:49:35.604]  And he points out that WTI, that's West Texas Intermediate, that's a metric for crude oil prices in Texas, in the U.S.
[00:49:35.604 --> 00:49:38.705]  WTI's second worst week in over three years was last week.
[00:49:39.875 --> 00:49:42.877]  They've been down 10 out of the last 11 weeks.
[00:49:42.877 --> 00:49:45.239]  The Dow's worst week in three years.
[00:49:45.239 --> 00:49:47.560]  And on and on and on.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.281]  That's where this is headed.
[00:49:49.281 --> 00:49:53.304]  But if you think you're going to get even any temporary relief, think again.
[00:49:53.304 --> 00:50:00.889]  Because we see this story out of The Independent in the UK saying that the new era of cheap oil is going to destroy the Green Revolution.
[00:50:00.889 --> 00:50:01.869]  See, it's a bad thing.
[00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:05.071]  When oil prices drop.
[00:50:05.071 --> 00:50:07.291]  And of course, as I said before, it's only a temporary thing.
[00:50:07.291 --> 00:50:11.132]  It's only to drive out new sources of oil.
[00:50:11.132 --> 00:50:12.792]  Only to drive out their competition.
[00:50:12.792 --> 00:50:15.133]  They're going to bring it back with a vengeance.
[00:50:15.133 --> 00:50:16.713]  You're going to be paying dearly for this.
[00:50:16.713 --> 00:50:24.735]  But you're not even going to get, in the UK at least, they're saying that they're not going to possibly even see a short-term
[00:50:25.695 --> 00:50:26.096]  We're good.
[00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:43.365]  Renewables are being subsidized, and they're going to look bad if oil is cheap.
[00:50:43.365 --> 00:50:45.606]  So you see, you can't win either way.
[00:50:45.606 --> 00:50:50.208]  They're not even going to let you take advantage of a temporary decline in oil prices.
[00:50:50.208 --> 00:50:56.592]  They're going to transfer money from you to renewable energy sources which don't work on the grid.
[00:50:56.592 --> 00:50:58.833]  They work fine individually, but they don't work on the grid.
[00:50:58.833 --> 00:51:00.674]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:51:00.794 --> 00:51:03.417]  This is a serious topic for all men.
[00:51:03.417 --> 00:51:07.881]  Every single man listening may have a prostate problem if he lives long enough.
[00:51:07.881 --> 00:51:08.742]  That's right.
[00:51:08.742 --> 00:51:11.485]  All of us men may suffer from a prostate problem.
[00:51:11.485 --> 00:51:16.330]  Like urinating more often, waking at night to urinate, or problems with intimacy.

[00:53:47.083 --> 00:53:52.666]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:56.467]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[00:53:56.467 --> 00:53:57.968]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[00:54:19.747 --> 00:54:21.087]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:21.087 --> 00:54:22.328]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:54:22.328 --> 00:54:25.809]  In the next hour, we're going to be joined by Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:54:25.809 --> 00:54:29.630]  And of course, we're going to talk to him about some of his articles that have come out recently.
[00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:32.710]  We are on the brink of war and economic collapse.
[00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:36.131]  That's the title of a recent article by Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:54:36.131 --> 00:54:38.612]  I just talked about the connection between this
[00:54:39.472 --> 00:54:40.593]  We're good to go.
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.962]  We have 17% off plus free shipping.
[00:55:01.962 --> 00:55:04.325]  You can get it for $24.99 normally.
[00:55:04.325 --> 00:55:06.687]  With shipping, you would have paid up to $38.
[00:55:06.687 --> 00:55:09.910]  Now this is going to be a sale that's only going to run through next Monday.
[00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:15.015]  And of course, if you get it within the next two days, you can get guaranteed Christmas delivery.
[00:55:15.015 --> 00:55:17.297]  That's X2 on sale at Infowars Life.
[00:55:18.318 --> 00:55:23.162]  Check that out, and that's our strongest iodine supplement.
[00:55:23.162 --> 00:55:30.027]  As I pointed out earlier, the CDC says that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world.
[00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:33.029]  Also, though, one of the easiest to correct.
[00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:41.094]  They have taken sources of iodine pretty much out of the food supply after having put it in there, but now you can put it back in for yourself and for your family.
[00:55:41.094 --> 00:55:44.557]  Again, that sale for what would normally cost you a shipping $38, you can now get for $24.99.
[00:55:48.797 --> 00:56:05.525]  As I said, Paul Craig Roberts is going to be joining us to talk about the economic issues and how they all tie into war, because Putin takes the economic viability of his country very seriously, unlike our leadership.
[00:56:06.569 --> 00:56:10.412]  He takes it very seriously when they try to destroy his purchasing power.
[00:56:10.412 --> 00:56:14.475]  And of course, this is all part of the larger Cold War.
[00:56:14.475 --> 00:56:19.058]  We should be concerned about the fact that they're shutting down power plants left and right in the United States.
[00:56:19.058 --> 00:56:23.301]  We are the only ones that supposedly contribute to global warming.
[00:56:24.021 --> 00:56:28.785]  That's the fantasy that's being used to try to shut down our energy production.
[00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:37.953]  And let me tell you, nothing affects your standard of living and even your longevity of life more than access to cheap energy.
[00:56:39.198 --> 00:56:43.042]  That is what Saudi Arabia is trying to destroy right now.
[00:56:43.042 --> 00:56:51.231]  Saudi Arabia, the ally of the CIA, of course, does not have the best interest of the United States at heart.
[00:56:51.231 --> 00:56:59.600]  They are trying to shut down our new sources of energy at the same time we see that they're not giving up on their crazy
[00:57:00.911 --> 00:57:03.332]  Energy agenda, their climate change agenda.
[00:57:03.332 --> 00:57:16.054]  We've heard Obama say that he's going to use the EPA to shut down more power generation in the United States and he doesn't think that the GOP can stop him even with their new majority.
[00:57:16.054 --> 00:57:17.595]  So he's thrown the gauntlet down.
[00:57:17.595 --> 00:57:27.657]  He said even before he got elected that he wanted to shut down the coal industry and we saw just last month when he went to China that he made an agreement with them that we would cap
[00:57:28.533 --> 00:57:33.896]  Our, we would essentially cut over the next 11 years 25% of our energy production.
[00:57:33.896 --> 00:57:39.460]  They would not even have to cap theirs for another 15 years.
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:40.580]  I think it was 16 years.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:41.921]  Yes, it was 16 years.
[00:57:41.921 --> 00:57:49.446]  We have to cut ours over 11, but they're allowed to continue to grow theirs for another 16 before they even have to cap it.
[00:57:49.446 --> 00:57:53.608]  And of course, they're growing their energy production at an exponential rate.
[00:57:53.608 --> 00:57:56.030]  Not really concerned about pollution.
[00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:57.611]  If this is a global problem,
[00:57:58.351 --> 00:58:01.773]  Why aren't they concerned about China?
[00:58:01.773 --> 00:58:08.617]  Well, of course, they're really moving this, I believe, to a kind of replacement for the central banks.
[00:58:08.617 --> 00:58:17.402]  Back in the 1930s, globalists were talking about how they would get rid of the fiat currencies, and central banks as the element of control, and they would turn to energy.
[00:58:18.206 --> 00:58:20.507]  That would be the way they would control us.
[00:58:20.507 --> 00:58:22.948]  And that's essentially what's behind these carbon credits.
[00:58:22.948 --> 00:58:28.470]  Essentially paying a indulgence fee to them for any and everything you do.
[00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:30.010]  That's a way to control you, isn't it?
[00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:31.071]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:31.071 --> 00:58:32.671]  The next hour, Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:58:32.671 --> 00:58:38.113]  Stay with us.
[00:58:38.113 --> 00:58:45.096]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:01.499 --> 00:59:14.089]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs
[00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:15.450]  Essential nutrients.
[00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:18.471]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:59:18.471 --> 00:59:19.871]  No needles, no injections.
[00:59:19.871 --> 00:59:24.093]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:33.457]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true nutraceutical quality Vitamin B12.

[01:00:06.107 --> 01:00:10.950]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:12.551]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.551 --> 01:00:14.071]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.071 --> 01:00:18.254]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.254 --> 01:00:22.316]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.953 --> 01:00:30.214]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:30.214 --> 01:00:31.755]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:00:31.755 --> 01:00:34.257]  Joining us in the next segment will be Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:00:34.257 --> 01:00:46.245]  We're going to be talking about recent developments in the economy, as well as the build-up intentions that may lead to a third world war, at least to a much, much revived Cold War, as we've already seen.
[01:00:46.245 --> 01:00:50.028]  And of course, that involves the manipulation of the price of oil.
[01:00:50.028 --> 01:00:54.411]  It also involves the Congress, Boehner and the Democrats.
[01:00:55.672 --> 01:00:59.876]  Signing us up to ensure the derivatives of the large banks.
[01:00:59.876 --> 01:01:01.577]  That's a big part of this.
[01:01:01.577 --> 01:01:08.083]  Now, another aspect of betrayal, I believe, of this budget can be seen in pensions.
[01:01:08.083 --> 01:01:10.746]  Now, of course, there's a lot of different ways that people can get their pensions.
[01:01:10.746 --> 01:01:14.409]  We have Social Security, a lot of people think of as their pension.
[01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:16.030]  Well, guess what they did?
[01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:19.413]  They just allow with this open border amnesty program
[01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:22.571]  Incentivizing illegal immigration.
[01:01:22.571 --> 01:01:26.733]  They allow those illegal immigrants to be allowed to get Social Security benefits.
[01:01:26.733 --> 01:01:28.814]  That's one of the things that we're going to see happen there.
[01:01:28.814 --> 01:01:41.401]  Social Security was already insolvent before we opened our borders to the world and told everybody they can come to America and retire at our expense or come with disabilities and get the entitlement programs here as if they had been a citizen of this country.
[01:01:41.981 --> 01:01:43.922]  Of course, you can't sustain that.
[01:01:43.922 --> 01:01:47.324]  That's the exact purpose of this open amnesty.
[01:01:47.324 --> 01:01:53.687]  But of course, there's another government pension program, and that's the one that they give to employees, to teachers, to cops.
[01:01:54.858 --> 01:01:57.460]  Those are known as unfunded liabilities.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.342]  We've seen this happening for a long time.
[01:01:59.342 --> 01:02:07.970]  I saw that explained once by a think tank that was trying to convince the Illinois Teachers Union to adopt a private pension plan.
[01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:12.014]  And what they had was a large trash can and they were dumping dollar bills into it.
[01:02:12.014 --> 01:02:15.958]  And they said, this is what your pension plan looks like right now that's under the government.
[01:02:16.758 --> 01:02:23.582]  And then the same guy that had the trash can starts walking out and reaching his hand in and throwing fistfuls of money out into the audience.
[01:02:23.582 --> 01:02:26.784]  And he goes, but of course, this money, you can't see how much is in there.
[01:02:26.784 --> 01:02:29.846]  You can't see if it's actually earmarked for you because it's not.
[01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:34.770]  And of course, it's being given away by the government as he throws this money by the fistful into the audience.
[01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:39.373]  He said, what we're proposing is that you have a private pension plan that looks something like this.
[01:02:39.373 --> 01:02:45.376]  And he holds a transparent glass and he sticks a dollar bill and it goes, this is yours.
[01:02:46.377 --> 01:02:50.501]  This is attached to you, and you can see exactly how much is in it.
[01:02:50.501 --> 01:03:00.831]  Well, the problem is, is that we've had that, in terms of private pensions, we see that many people who've worked for corporations for 20, 30 years, they had an agreement.
[01:03:00.831 --> 01:03:03.113]  They knew exactly what was in their pension plan.
[01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.695]  That was always sacrosanct.
[01:03:04.695 --> 01:03:08.559]  You could not touch that under bankruptcy, under any other circumstances.
[01:03:08.559 --> 01:03:08.999]  It was set.
[01:03:10.649 --> 01:03:14.952]  Now the Boehner budget has attacked that.
[01:03:14.952 --> 01:03:26.682]  They're going to allow those corporations, people who have made private commitments to workers for their retirement, they're going to allow them to come in and restructure that.
[01:03:27.728 --> 01:03:31.053]  And that means that they're not that far away from bail-ins either.
[01:03:31.053 --> 01:03:39.847]  The other form of a private pension where you take your money and you put it into some kind of an investment or an IRA, they're going to come after that as well.
[01:03:39.847 --> 01:03:41.129]  So there's the four.
[01:03:41.129 --> 01:03:42.551]  You think any of those are secure?
[01:03:43.464 --> 01:03:46.527]  Not a single one of those are secure.
[01:03:46.527 --> 01:03:52.572]  And it really underscores, I think, the drastic decline in standard of living here in America.
[01:03:52.572 --> 01:04:04.603]  When you look at how these companies are trying to make the case that they need to have relief from these pension commitments, from these liabilities on their balance sheet, they need to have the ability to restructure those deals.
[01:04:04.603 --> 01:04:06.785]  In other words, to cut your benefits.
[01:04:07.305 --> 01:04:13.251]  Think about somebody that's worked for 30 years, that's about to retire with some large corporation if that even happens anymore.
[01:04:13.251 --> 01:04:15.253]  Most people are fired before that happens.
[01:04:15.253 --> 01:04:18.876]  But think about that kind of commitment that they made, let's say, 30 years ago.
[01:04:18.876 --> 01:04:24.902]  If you look at the inflation calculator to see what the purchasing power of the dollar is, that means that if you were to buy something
[01:04:26.047 --> 01:04:26.227]  I think?
[01:04:43.544 --> 01:04:50.228]  So, they're now going to not be able to pay you back those commitments that they made 30 years ago.
[01:04:50.228 --> 01:04:54.530]  They're not going to be able to pay that back with devalued dollars.
[01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:57.311]  That's the ropes that the American economy is on.
[01:04:57.311 --> 01:04:59.433]  That's how desperate things have gotten.
[01:04:59.433 --> 01:05:00.933]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with Paul Crugloff.
[01:05:00.933 --> 01:05:07.477]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[01:05:07.717 --> 01:05:11.659]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:18.402]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with OxyPowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[01:05:18.402 --> 01:05:21.064]  Using Super Oxygenation, OxyPowder.
[01:05:21.064 --> 01:05:23.045]  Available through Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:26.626]  Gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[01:05:26.626 --> 01:05:31.569]  Infowars Nightly News Director Rob Dude has been using OxyPowder with incredible success.
[01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:34.451]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:35.772]  Twelve pounds melted off.
[01:05:35.772 --> 01:05:37.134]  In about a week, I'd say a week.
[01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:38.074]  Seven days.
[01:05:38.074 --> 01:05:39.836]  And I've been able to keep it off, too.
[01:05:39.836 --> 01:05:41.437]  My wife's like, wow, you look really good.
[01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:42.758]  And I'm like, I know.
[01:05:42.758 --> 01:05:43.899]  I guess it's this Oxy-Powder.
[01:05:43.899 --> 01:05:45.961]  2015 can be different.
[01:05:45.961 --> 01:05:49.164]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[01:05:49.164 --> 01:05:51.386]  Oxy-Powder flushes it out.
[01:05:51.386 --> 01:05:54.368]  Secure your Oxy-Powder at Infowarslife.com.

[01:06:33.759 --> 01:06:38.040]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.821]  Can you put two and two together?

[01:07:57.501 --> 01:08:08.148]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.256 --> 01:08:12.944]  We're good.
[01:08:19.065 --> 01:08:20.506]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:20.506 --> 01:08:25.069]  I'm David Knight on this Monday, December 15th, 2014.
[01:08:25.069 --> 01:08:27.730]  Joining us now is Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:08:27.730 --> 01:08:40.418]  But before I go to him and talk about what's happening to the world in terms of economics, in terms of lurching towards war, I want to let you know that for the first time we've had, have X2, Survival Shield X2 on sale.
[01:08:40.418 --> 01:08:42.600]  It's the first time we've ever had it on sale.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:45.922]  And that sale is 17% off plus free shipping.
[01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.283]  So normally it's $29.99.
[01:08:48.283 --> 01:08:52.184]  You now get it for $24.99 plus with free shipping.
[01:08:52.184 --> 01:08:54.685]  Without free shipping, you would have paid $38 for it.
[01:08:54.685 --> 01:08:56.926]  So now you're getting it for $24.99.
[01:08:56.926 --> 01:09:00.087]  This is a sale that's only going to run through next Monday.
[01:09:00.087 --> 01:09:05.028]  If you order it now, within the next two days, you get guaranteed delivery by Christmas.
[01:09:05.028 --> 01:09:12.631]  And again, that's Survival Shield X2, available at InfoWarsLife.com on sale for just the next week.
[01:09:13.371 --> 01:09:20.496]  Now, joining us is Paul Craig Roberts, and of course, he was the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during the Reagan administration.
[01:09:20.496 --> 01:09:29.223]  He was famous as the co-founder of Reaganomics, an author of many books, eight, it says right here, eight different books.
[01:09:29.223 --> 01:09:33.406]  A PhD from Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Virginia.
[01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:38.057]  And I wanted to ask him, Dr. Roberts, thank you for joining us.
[01:09:38.057 --> 01:09:42.338]  I wanted to ask you about what's going on, your take on oil.
[01:09:42.338 --> 01:09:53.601]  It looks to me like it has got multiple aspects of it, not only attacking our domestic energy production, but also a knife aimed straight at the jugular of Putin in Russia.
[01:09:53.601 --> 01:09:55.301]  Would you say?
[01:09:55.301 --> 01:10:00.502]  David, I don't really know all I know for a fact.
[01:10:00.502 --> 01:10:03.383]  If news reports are correct, then you never know if that's true either.
[01:10:04.478 --> 01:10:21.648]  That the OPEC or the Saudis primarily, normally when you have a recession and the demand for oil drops and the price starts going down, in the past the Saudis restrict their output.
[01:10:21.648 --> 01:10:27.391]  They cut back the production in order to reduce the fall in the price.
[01:10:27.391 --> 01:10:32.034]  So they protect the price by restricting output when the demand falls.
[01:10:32.972 --> 01:10:34.293]  That's their normal behavior.
[01:10:34.293 --> 01:10:36.394]  This time, this is not happening.
[01:10:36.394 --> 01:10:46.581]  Apparently, if news reports are correct, but of course, I'm not connected to the oil industry and have no independent information about it.
[01:10:46.581 --> 01:11:00.811]  So, if news reports are correct, for the first time, or for an unusual incident, the authorities are not restricting output as the demand falls, and so the price is going down.
[01:11:00.811 --> 01:11:02.072]  Now, the effect of this
[01:11:03.181 --> 01:11:08.267]  Of course is devastating for the American fracking industry.
[01:11:10.115 --> 01:11:35.933]  You might remember that in order to get fracking underway and give fracking companies the ability to override community concerns, homeowner concerns, to override people's concerns with surface water and groundwater, the industry promised 100 years of energy independence.
[01:11:35.933 --> 01:11:36.574]  In other words,
[01:11:37.279 --> 01:11:48.246]  They created this impression that the United States would no longer have any imported energy, that we would have a century of our own energy.
[01:11:48.246 --> 01:12:01.894]  And by making these kinds of claims and establishing this kind of attitude, they were able to override the real objections to fracking.
[01:12:01.894 --> 01:12:02.074]  Now,
[01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:08.725]  All of that tracking started with a much higher oil price.
[01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:11.765]  The price falls down like it does.
[01:12:11.765 --> 01:12:13.926]  This industry doesn't pay.
[01:12:13.926 --> 01:12:16.927]  The costs are higher than the price.
[01:12:16.927 --> 01:12:24.789]  And so you could look at this as the Saudis were taken in by this propaganda.
[01:12:24.789 --> 01:12:30.411]  I've seen various reports from people who claim to be experts that at best there was 20 years.
[01:12:32.808 --> 01:12:34.669]  Fracking, not a hundred.
[01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:42.174]  Now maybe the Saudis were taken in, they didn't want to lose their market, so they're just driving these companies into the ground.
[01:12:42.174 --> 01:12:45.076]  That's one explanation.
[01:12:45.076 --> 01:12:53.222]  Another explanation that people advance is that we've hired the Saudis to put the pressure on Russia.
[01:12:54.413 --> 01:13:03.857]  Uh, revenues by driving down the price of oil because the Russian economy is dependent in some ways on the sale of oil.
[01:13:03.857 --> 01:13:09.259]  And so the price of oil is driven down and generally all energy prices tend to move together.
[01:13:09.259 --> 01:13:12.560]  So maybe it also hurts their sales of natural gas.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:21.284]  And so this is seen as an effort of the United States to hurt Russia's ability to resist the various
[01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:23.546]  Well, let's look at what
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.741]  is going to come, regardless of what the motivations were on this.
[01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:46.663]  Let's look at some of the immediate practical considerations that are going to come under fire here.
[01:13:46.663 --> 01:13:54.366]  As I talked about earlier, we've got this report from David Stockman's Contra Corner, says, here comes Wall Street's latest toxic waste.
[01:13:54.366 --> 01:13:59.068]  He says, oil-linked notes will blow up under $80, many of them.
[01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:05.050]  And so, are you concerned about the derivatives market that's attached to oil prices?
[01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:06.911]  Yes, a lot of people are.
[01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:12.313]  Not just David.
[01:14:12.313 --> 01:14:34.761]  I think there is a possible explosive event for the banks, and it could be the reason that I think it's the Citibank chairman that's been pressing to overcome the part of the replacement legislation for Glass-Steagall that
[01:14:37.882 --> 01:14:48.106]  If they can get that repeal, it lets them have access to depositors' accounts in the event there are derivative problems.
[01:14:48.106 --> 01:14:48.627]  Yes.
[01:14:48.627 --> 01:14:55.870]  So that could be one of the reasons that the Citibank chairman is pressing to overturn this
[01:14:57.171 --> 01:15:07.287]  Uh, legislation because the legislation I think requires them to move their derivative stuff into subsidiaries and get it off.
[01:15:08.763 --> 01:15:12.266]  The entity that calls the consumer deposits.
[01:15:12.266 --> 01:15:12.667]  That's correct.
[01:15:12.667 --> 01:15:21.135]  With Dodd-Frank, they were supposed to separate out those speculative investments away from their core banking business, which would be insured by FDIC deposits.
[01:15:21.135 --> 01:15:28.402]  And we've seen a lot of heavy lobbying by Diamond as well as by Citibank to get this in.
[01:15:28.402 --> 01:15:30.344]  And it looks like they got what they wanted.
[01:15:30.444 --> 01:15:34.468]  That's part of the budget deal that got rammed through by Boehner.
[01:15:34.468 --> 01:15:37.750]  And of course, it's alienated even a lot of the Democrat base.
[01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:48.560]  They essentially have alienated their voters by giving this massive gift to the bankers, telling them, we'll underwrite and insure your risky investments using the U.S.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.561]  taxpayer.
[01:15:49.561 --> 01:15:51.903]  So Elizabeth Warren wasn't able to block it.
[01:15:51.903 --> 01:15:53.244]  I know she was trying to block it.
[01:15:53.584 --> 01:15:56.765]  Yeah, I think the deal has gone through, I believe.
[01:15:56.765 --> 01:15:59.926]  Anyway, that's what they're trying to do.
[01:15:59.926 --> 01:16:07.829]  Whether it's gone through or not is an indication that they themselves are worried about the oil derivatives.
[01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:10.631]  But there are all sorts of other derivatives.
[01:16:10.631 --> 01:16:13.992]  Any of them could blow up.
[01:16:13.992 --> 01:16:22.015]  So what we see again is that three or four banks control the economic policy of the United States.
[01:16:23.147 --> 01:16:26.408]  And control the fate of all the rest of us.
[01:16:26.408 --> 01:16:27.148]  Yeah, that's very true.
[01:16:27.148 --> 01:16:36.951]  We were talking about this in the last hour with this Michael Schneider went through and looked at how bad the week was last week in terms of economic metrics.
[01:16:36.951 --> 01:16:39.352]  And he pointed out the similarities to 2008.
[01:16:39.352 --> 01:16:45.974]  First we had an oil crash, then we had a commodities crash, then we had junk bonds crashing, and then we had the stock market crashing.
[01:16:45.974 --> 01:16:48.015]  So all it takes when you've got this
[01:16:49.215 --> 01:16:49.976]  That's right.
[01:16:49.976 --> 01:16:51.397]  And remember now, the recession in
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:27.125]  At the end of 2007, this was caused by the exploding fraudulent financial instruments.
[01:17:27.125 --> 01:17:28.086]  Yes.
[01:17:28.086 --> 01:17:38.732]  This time around, it may be that the recession itself causes the financial instruments to explode.
[01:17:38.732 --> 01:17:45.516]  Because there's every indication that not only has there never been a recovery, the recovery is up.
[01:17:46.247 --> 01:18:03.581]  An illusion created by understating inflation, overstating GDP growth, overstating jobs, not counting discouraged workers as unemployed.
[01:18:03.581 --> 01:18:09.886]  The whole thing is an illusion and it's shot to pieces by the facts.
[01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:15.391]  For example, the Federal Reserve has just done a survey and they found that
[01:18:16.471 --> 01:18:24.838]  About the half of 25 year olds are back at home living with parents.
[01:18:24.838 --> 01:18:29.902]  They're either unemployed or the jobs they have are not sufficient to pay rent.
[01:18:31.391 --> 01:18:49.408]  Yeah, and I think that the fantasy that we have recovered economically from 2008, I think that's really underscored by what happened with the pension plans and the fact that Democrats and Republicans told us in this budget bill that they're going to give corporations the ability to renegotiate their pension commitments.
[01:18:49.408 --> 01:18:53.731]  That's something that has always in the past been sacrosanct, and when you look at the fact that
[01:18:54.432 --> 01:19:01.817]  Private companies who have made these pension commitments decades ago would now be paying them back with much cheaper dollars.
[01:19:01.817 --> 01:19:04.099]  The purchasing power has been eroded by the Federal Reserve.
[01:19:04.099 --> 01:19:05.980]  They're not even able to make that.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:08.802]  What does that tell us?
[01:19:08.802 --> 01:19:09.823]  Right.
[01:19:09.823 --> 01:19:13.786]  Of course, the theft of pensions goes back a long time.
[01:19:13.786 --> 01:19:17.989]  I think it started when Eastern Airlines was taken over.
[01:19:17.989 --> 01:19:21.751]  That's his name.
[01:19:21.751 --> 01:19:22.251]  And of course,
[01:19:23.963 --> 01:19:32.150]  They're already cutting back and reducing all the municipal workers' pensions.
[01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:33.030]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:37.714]  Government pensions, they go by another name, and that's called unfunded mandates, isn't it?
[01:19:37.714 --> 01:19:39.476]  Yeah.
[01:19:39.476 --> 01:19:42.658]  And they're doing the same thing with Social Security.
[01:19:42.658 --> 01:19:43.599]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:43.599 --> 01:19:47.502]  And of course, bringing people in with the open borders, that's one thing that's really going to kill Social Security.
[01:19:47.502 --> 01:19:48.263]  We're going to be right back.
[01:19:48.263 --> 01:19:49.584]  We've got to go to break, Dr. Roberts.

[01:22:19.319 --> 01:22:21.080]  I thought he was just paranoid, so I ignored it.

[01:22:22.301 --> 01:22:30.365]  But then I started hearing government and media types talking about making guns illegal, about the President signing on to a UN treaty that could take my gun rights away.
[01:22:30.365 --> 01:22:35.808]  You know, it really bugged me, so I dug in, I did the research, and I realized that Mark was right all along.

[01:23:18.799 --> 01:23:24.363]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[01:23:24.363 --> 01:23:28.426]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[01:23:28.426 --> 01:23:33.469]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.
[01:23:33.849 --> 01:23:40.552]  As always, all orders over $50 are shipped free, and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.
[01:23:40.552 --> 01:23:46.414]  Order online at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com, spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y.

[01:23:51.176 --> 01:23:55.118]  That's 877-99-BER-K-E-Y.
[01:23:55.118 --> 01:23:56.518]  Gift well this Christmas.
[01:23:56.518 --> 01:23:57.959]  Give a Big Berkey Water Filter!
[01:24:13.809 --> 01:24:15.250]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:28.257]  I'm David Knight, your host, and we have on the phone with us Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, one of the co-founders of Reaganomics, an economist and author, and we're talking to him about what the outlook is.
[01:24:28.257 --> 01:24:32.179]  I guess maybe, Dr. Roberts, we're coming to the end of the year.
[01:24:32.179 --> 01:24:38.222]  I'd like to kind of get your general forecast as to what lays ahead on your most recent essay on your site.
[01:24:38.982 --> 01:24:41.124]  PaulCraigRoberts.org.
[01:24:41.124 --> 01:24:47.688]  There's an article on the brink of war and economic collapse, and you say, on occasion a reader will ask if I can give readers some good news.
[01:24:47.688 --> 01:24:52.391]  The answer is not unless I lie to you, like your government and the mainstream media do.
[01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:56.554]  So, what's the bad news for next year?
[01:24:56.554 --> 01:25:00.176]  Well, you know, David, let's cut to the chase.
[01:25:00.176 --> 01:25:02.058]  Everything is based on lies.
[01:25:02.058 --> 01:25:03.619]  The economy is based on lies.
[01:25:05.588 --> 01:25:22.938]  And we now see both houses of Congress have passed resolutions that set the basis for Washington fighting the Russians to the death of the last Ukrainian soldier.
[01:25:22.938 --> 01:25:31.843]  We're clearly going to arm the Ukrainians and hope that they are involved in a war with Russia.
[01:25:31.843 --> 01:25:34.185]  Because this would greatly embarrass Russia.
[01:25:34.955 --> 01:25:42.280]  Who obviously would win the war and would be designated the aggressor.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.322]  And this would be used to further isolate Russia from Europe.
[01:25:46.322 --> 01:25:53.406]  So this is pretty much predictable given the two resolutions from the House and Senate.
[01:25:53.406 --> 01:25:59.090]  I think the Senate vote was unanimous and the House vote was 411 to 10.
[01:25:59.090 --> 01:26:03.673]  So we see out of the entirety of Congress, which I think is some
[01:26:05.187 --> 01:26:06.568]  535 people.
[01:26:06.568 --> 01:26:14.173]  The Americans people succeeded in electing 10 intelligent people.
[01:26:14.173 --> 01:26:15.014]  That many?
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.401]  That's pretty optimistic.
[01:26:18.401 --> 01:26:19.962]  So much for democracy.
[01:26:19.962 --> 01:26:33.132]  Now for the economy, as we were saying, when you have half of 25-year-olds, these are for the most part, I think, college educated, having to live at home because they can't get employment, and you've got 30% of 30-year-olds
[01:26:35.914 --> 01:26:36.475]  We're good to go.
[01:26:52.006 --> 01:27:12.725]  The American economy offshore so that shareholders could enjoy the capital gains from the higher profits from the lower labor costs and the executives of the corporations can enjoy multi-million dollar bonuses from the higher profits from the lower labor costs of moving the jobs offshore.
[01:27:12.725 --> 01:27:13.766]  There's no economy here.
[01:27:14.714 --> 01:27:15.094]  Yeah.
[01:27:15.094 --> 01:27:19.696]  So we have a massive trade deficit that can't possibly be closed.
[01:27:19.696 --> 01:27:23.917]  And so the whole house of cards is standing on the dot.
[01:27:23.917 --> 01:27:24.878]  On the petrodollar.
[01:27:24.878 --> 01:27:31.600]  And I think that's a key thing, too, that we see as they're moving to, as we see the price of oil plummeting.
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:39.862]  As many people believe, it's Saudi Arabia that is, as you point out earlier, they declined to cut production as prices dropped.
[01:27:39.862 --> 01:27:42.943]  So they're basically feeding into this decline.
[01:27:42.943 --> 01:27:51.345]  And the petrodollar is really one of the few things that we've got here, this fantasy that we've pushed on to the entire world, the petrodollar.
[01:27:51.345 --> 01:27:56.226]  And of course, Putin is pushing with China and with India to try to
[01:27:57.207 --> 01:27:58.391]  Go around the petrodollar.
[01:27:58.391 --> 01:28:01.824]  Once they do that, that's going to have tremendous impact for our standard of living, isn't it?
[01:28:02.662 --> 01:28:04.963]  Yes, it's not just the federal dollar.
[01:28:04.963 --> 01:28:07.803]  It's the use of the dollar as world reserve currency.
[01:28:07.803 --> 01:28:09.324]  It has many other uses.
[01:28:09.324 --> 01:28:09.924]  Right, right.
[01:28:09.924 --> 01:28:13.565]  But that's kind of the core of its reserve currency aspect.
[01:28:13.565 --> 01:28:30.329]  And of course, as we talked about earlier, this is setting off a massive collapse of the derivatives market, which could cascade into the commodities, to stock markets, and that sort of thing, just as the Congress signs us up yet again to ensure the big bankers' speculations in the derivatives market.
[01:28:30.769 --> 01:28:39.692]  Well, if they grab everybody's bank deposits and everybody's pensions and so forth, the population here will starve.
[01:28:39.692 --> 01:28:40.973]  They won't have any money.
[01:28:40.973 --> 01:28:42.313]  Yeah.
[01:28:42.313 --> 01:28:50.596]  And so, if they do that, they will provoke amazing social unrest, and as half the country is armed,
[01:28:51.503 --> 01:28:53.204]  I don't know.
[01:29:15.221 --> 01:29:16.302]  $50 prepper kits.
[01:29:16.302 --> 01:29:22.026]  I don't know that that would have any practical value whatsoever, that small amount of prepping.
[01:29:22.026 --> 01:29:25.329]  But I think it kind of showed their concern, don't you?
[01:29:25.329 --> 01:29:28.271]  I didn't know what to make of that, whether that was a joke or what.
[01:29:28.271 --> 01:29:30.953]  Because it's on his face, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:29:30.953 --> 01:29:32.695]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:32.695 --> 01:29:33.255]  Amazing.
[01:29:33.255 --> 01:29:34.896]  Well, thank you so much, Dr. Roberts.
[01:29:34.896 --> 01:29:37.258]  That's paulcraigroberts.org.
[01:29:37.258 --> 01:29:39.360]  Thank you so much for joining us.

[01:29:42.422 --> 01:29:42.863]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.528 --> 01:29:53.456]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.456 --> 01:29:56.121]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:33.708 --> 01:32:37.991]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:37.991 --> 01:32:39.772]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:32:39.772 --> 01:32:47.637]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[01:33:23.413 --> 01:33:24.794]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.794 --> 01:33:26.176]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:33:26.176 --> 01:33:29.519]  We're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson in the next hour.
[01:33:29.519 --> 01:33:33.303]  We're going to talk about this attack that happened in Sydney.
[01:33:33.303 --> 01:33:34.484]  Who's behind it?
[01:33:34.484 --> 01:33:35.805]  How is it going to be used?
[01:33:35.805 --> 01:33:38.488]  We're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson from the UK about that.
[01:33:39.689 --> 01:33:41.370]  I'm going to take your calls here in just a moment.
[01:33:41.370 --> 01:33:42.551]  Let me give you that number.
[01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:43.031]  It's 800-259-9231.
[01:33:43.031 --> 01:33:50.477]  That's 800-259-9231 if you want to weigh in on what we've been talking about today.
[01:33:50.477 --> 01:34:01.205]  Of course, most of it has been about what Boehner and the GOP Republicans, along with the Democrats of course, have just foisted upon the American public.
[01:34:01.205 --> 01:34:05.148]  Essentially opening the doors for attacks on pension plans.
[01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:12.325]  Boosting the contribution limits that they've had before the caps, boosting those by a factor of 10.
[01:34:12.325 --> 01:34:28.216]  And then, of course, signing the American taxpayer up as the insurer of bank speculations at the same time that we see this collapse in the oil industry, as well as the oil derivatives that are attached to that collapse.
[01:34:28.216 --> 01:34:29.317]  What is that going to mean?
[01:34:29.317 --> 01:34:32.359]  We've been talking about that with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:34:32.359 --> 01:34:34.040]  So, if you want to comment on that,
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:44.124]  Or on the massive protests that were held this last weekend about police brutality or about torture and the fact that no one is ever held accountable.
[01:34:44.124 --> 01:34:46.125]  We can talk about any of that if you want to call.
[01:34:46.125 --> 01:34:47.026]  Again, that number is 800-259-9231.
[01:34:47.026 --> 01:34:54.869]  Now before we go to your calls, I want to point out that we have the first ever sale for X2.
[01:34:54.869 --> 01:34:59.431]  It's going to be on sale for the next week, only up through next Monday.
[01:34:59.431 --> 01:35:02.373]  And you get 17% off, plus free shipping.
[01:35:03.339 --> 01:35:06.121]  With shipping, you would have paid up to $38 a barrel.
[01:35:06.121 --> 01:35:07.182]  A barrel?
[01:35:07.182 --> 01:35:08.403]  I'm talking about oil.
[01:35:08.403 --> 01:35:12.627]  No, we're talking about X2, iodine, survival shield.
[01:35:12.627 --> 01:35:15.429]  You would have paid up to $38 per bottle.
[01:35:15.429 --> 01:35:19.953]  Now you can get it for $24.99 with this sale up through next Monday.
[01:35:19.953 --> 01:35:21.074]  That's free shipping.
[01:35:21.074 --> 01:35:25.878]  And of course, if you order it within the next two days, you will get it by Christmas guaranteed.
[01:35:26.599 --> 01:35:35.701]  Now, talking about Christmas, there was an interesting story that was up on the Drudge Report today about a Cambridge school removing Santa Claus from their winter concert.
[01:35:35.701 --> 01:35:37.222]  Notice that headline?
[01:35:37.222 --> 01:35:39.102]  Santa Claus winter concert.
[01:35:39.102 --> 01:35:40.582]  It's not Jesus.
[01:35:40.582 --> 01:35:42.123]  It's not a Christmas concert.
[01:35:42.123 --> 01:35:42.923]  It's Santa Claus.
[01:35:42.923 --> 01:35:47.644]  But even Santa Claus is now politically incorrect.
[01:35:47.644 --> 01:35:49.765]  So, Santa gets sacked.
[01:35:49.765 --> 01:35:50.205]  There you go.
[01:35:50.985 --> 01:35:54.028]  And this is because of the complaint of one person.
[01:35:54.028 --> 01:35:54.809]  One person.
[01:35:54.809 --> 01:36:03.018]  They say traditionally they have a concert, a winter concert I imagine, that is closed with Santa running through the aisle.
[01:36:03.018 --> 01:36:06.842]  And they said the decision to remove him was based on the complaint of one person.
[01:36:07.563 --> 01:36:11.705]  Now, there's nothing Christian about Santa Claus, okay?
[01:36:11.705 --> 01:36:14.266]  Nothing at all Christian about Santa Claus.
[01:36:14.266 --> 01:36:15.687]  And a Muslim pointed this out.
[01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:18.228]  One of the people they talked to was Mohammed Hassan.
[01:36:18.228 --> 01:36:19.229]  I'm presuming he's a Muslim.
[01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:21.990]  They didn't identify him as that, I'm assuming by his name.
[01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:24.451]  But he says he doesn't look at Santa Claus as a religious symbol.
[01:36:24.451 --> 01:36:26.192]  He said, kids like that.
[01:36:26.192 --> 01:36:27.613]  It's fun for kids.
[01:36:27.613 --> 01:36:29.854]  It's good, said Hassan.
[01:36:29.854 --> 01:36:33.376]  But see, the political correctness and the tyranny of the minority
[01:36:34.196 --> 01:36:40.916]  It's so bad that you can't even have Santa at a winter concert anymore.
[01:36:40.916 --> 01:36:42.299]  Now, in a related note...
[01:36:43.402 --> 01:36:45.324]  On the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
[01:36:45.324 --> 01:36:47.045]  I haven't watched that for years.
[01:36:47.045 --> 01:36:50.128]  We basically don't have access to broadcast television.
[01:36:50.128 --> 01:36:54.532]  We just watch stuff on the internet as we see fit.
[01:36:54.532 --> 01:36:58.336]  I was looking at the photographs from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
[01:36:58.336 --> 01:37:00.898]  Look at what the balloons look like.
[01:37:00.898 --> 01:37:04.241]  You can see it right there if you're looking at our video feed.
[01:37:04.241 --> 01:37:06.083]  You can see the elf on the shelf.
[01:37:06.083 --> 01:37:06.824]  I looked at that and I was like...
[01:37:07.364 --> 01:37:09.105]  What in the world is that?
[01:37:09.105 --> 01:37:10.626]  I didn't know this character.
[01:37:10.626 --> 01:37:12.168]  Evidently, he's been around for about 10 years.
[01:37:12.168 --> 01:37:14.209]  My kids are older, so we didn't know anything about it.
[01:37:14.209 --> 01:37:18.472]  But they had this hunched-over elf on a shelf in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
[01:37:18.472 --> 01:37:21.815]  I mean, he looked like he was trying to do something with a squatty potty.
[01:37:21.815 --> 01:37:24.597]  But this is based on a book, in case you don't know.
[01:37:24.597 --> 01:37:29.440]  In case you're like me, you got older children, we don't know what happened with this.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.522]  In the mid-2000s, somebody came out with a book.
[01:37:32.853 --> 01:37:39.917]  And they self-published it, they came out with a toy, and the idea is that you've got an elf who's playing a game of hide-and-seek with the children.
[01:37:39.917 --> 01:37:51.063]  He looks for different spots around the house, and so you hide the elf around the house in different places, and he comes with a, please do not touch me, my magic might go, and Santa won't hear all that I've seen or know.
[01:37:52.043 --> 01:37:56.946]  In other words, this guy, this Elf on a Shelf is a spy for your kids.
[01:37:56.946 --> 01:38:02.210]  So, you're going to let Santa spy on you, is the message I think for your kids.
[01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:06.553]  You let Santa spy on you, you're going to be rewarded.
[01:38:06.553 --> 01:38:09.835]  And it reminded me of this essay that was done years ago by P.J.
[01:38:09.835 --> 01:38:10.756]  O'Rourke, where he said,
[01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:16.113]  Democrats are like Santa Claus, and Republicans are like God.
[01:38:16.113 --> 01:38:27.822]  And of course he's playing it out that, you know, Democrats just want to bestow gifts on you and everything, and Republicans want to tell you what to do in terms of your life, you know, what you can do in this area of your life, what you can do in that area of your life.
[01:38:27.822 --> 01:38:34.627]  But the bottom line is, is that, yeah, government does portray itself, certainly in the welfare state, as Santa Claus.
[01:38:34.627 --> 01:38:38.950]  But here's a situation where you let Santa spy on you, and of course this has been around for a long time.
[01:38:40.291 --> 01:39:03.664]  Good boy little or bad girl or whatever you know he's going to give you presents or whatever but to me this is just another example and I gotta say we never lied to our kids I think that's a very bad thing to do to your kids basically to lie to them about things like Santa Claus and elves I think that you're starting out that relationship in a very bad way your children need to trust you they need to know
[01:39:04.124 --> 01:39:04.845]  Yes, Dave, how are you doing?
[01:39:35.438 --> 01:39:37.919]  You said you wanted to talk about Sydney?
[01:39:37.919 --> 01:39:40.480]  Yeah, well, you know, my question is this.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.742]  Didn't they already have an incident at Port Arthur in, like, the 90s?
[01:39:45.742 --> 01:39:48.563]  Yeah, wasn't that the basis for gun control?
[01:39:48.563 --> 01:40:00.607]  Yeah, but didn't they also have, like, a foreign person, and that was the shooter was, like, a foreign person, and then they only shot the tourists, so then the locals didn't really see the aftermath.
[01:40:01.616 --> 01:40:02.456]  Yeah.
[01:40:02.456 --> 01:40:04.837]  I don't remember that story that well.
[01:40:04.837 --> 01:40:09.338]  Paul is going to be on to talk to us about the specifics of this particular incident.
[01:40:09.338 --> 01:40:10.839]  Of course, he can pull that in.
[01:40:10.839 --> 01:40:18.201]  And of course, they have a lot of very careful gun control registration in Australia, don't they?
[01:40:18.201 --> 01:40:19.241]  Well, yeah, they do.
[01:40:19.241 --> 01:40:29.384]  And that's another thing I'm worried or wondering about is why does their police look like a military force, especially when they have an unarmed citizenry?
[01:40:31.557 --> 01:40:32.806]  In Australia, I'm talking about.
[01:40:33.496 --> 01:41:02.138]  Well, I think everybody is pretty much following the lead of the United States in terms of not only the militarization of the police, but as we pointed out earlier in the program, even in Japan, it looks like it's, if you read between the lines from what the Prime Minister there, Abe, said, he said they have to punish whistleblowers in government with ten years in prison, journalists with five years in prison, so that they can have access to the information from their ally, the U.S.
[01:41:02.138 --> 01:41:02.438]  government.
[01:41:03.779 --> 01:41:04.340]  It's the U.S.
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:12.929]  government that is pushing that kind of attack on the press, that kind of a closed society, and everything we do in America now is closed.
[01:41:12.929 --> 01:41:20.478]  The mother of that young boy, that 12-year-old boy that was shot holding a BB gun, she said, you're not James Bond.
[01:41:20.478 --> 01:41:22.060]  You don't have a license to kill.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:34.706]  They view themselves as having a license to kill, and they view themselves as operating on, as the keepers of some kind of secret intelligence, that they know something you don't know.
[01:41:34.706 --> 01:41:48.212]  And I see that attitude pervasive, not just in the police, but I see it in every government department that we try to talk to, whether it's local, or whether it's state, and certainly with the feds, you can't get any information out of anybody, no one will be
[01:41:49.072 --> 01:41:51.393]  No, that's pretty much it.
[01:41:51.393 --> 01:42:07.257]  I'm just curious the fact that their citizens don't have guns, so why does their police need to look like an occupying military force that just is really...
[01:42:07.915 --> 01:42:13.722]  Well, we all know the answer to that is because the government wants to intimidate its citizens and have them do whatever they want.
[01:42:13.722 --> 01:42:16.426]  I mean, we go back and look at this torture report.
[01:42:16.426 --> 01:42:21.112]  Some of the stuff there was just designed to humiliate people.
[01:42:21.112 --> 01:42:23.755]  The same way the TSA is designed to humiliate people.
[01:42:23.755 --> 01:42:26.719]  You take people's dignity, you can take their freedom.
[01:42:27.239 --> 01:42:30.042]  You take their freedom, you can take their life.
[01:42:30.042 --> 01:42:31.484]  That's the progression.
[01:42:31.484 --> 01:42:33.586]  That's what the psychologists understand.
[01:42:33.586 --> 01:42:33.946]  As B.F.
[01:42:33.946 --> 01:42:49.001]  Skinner pointed out in his book, Beyond Freedom and Dignity, he thought that those were outmoded ideas that we needed to get rid of and we needed to treat people as if they were simply dolphins or dogs so that we could reward and treat with positive operant conditioning.
[01:42:49.001 --> 01:42:50.102]  You do this and you get a treat.
[01:42:50.936 --> 01:42:55.119]  You let me humiliate you and touch you, you get to get on the plane and fly.
[01:42:55.119 --> 01:42:56.200]  That's the way this works.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.421]  And that's what they're doing to people.
[01:42:57.421 --> 01:43:00.043]  Let's go to, thank you John, let's go to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[01:43:00.043 --> 01:43:01.885]  Mike?
[01:43:01.885 --> 01:43:03.906]  Hi David, how are you?
[01:43:03.906 --> 01:43:06.068]  Hi, doing good, go ahead.
[01:43:06.068 --> 01:43:12.814]  Well, I just wanted to comment on that clip you guys played earlier about the police officer making that comment about the MRAP.
[01:43:12.814 --> 01:43:14.055]  That's horrifying.
[01:43:16.414 --> 01:43:27.543]  You know, if every American citizen isn't supposed to believe in the Constitution, which is why we're all Americans here in this country, okay, I mean, what the hell are we supposed to be following?
[01:43:27.543 --> 01:43:28.463]  Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[01:43:28.463 --> 01:43:33.367]  Isn't that amazing that somebody, I mean, look, they take an oath to the Constitution.
[01:43:33.367 --> 01:43:42.734]  If they don't even understand what the Constitution is about, why would you take an oath to something and then criticize people who take it seriously, who you call constitutionalists?
[01:43:42.734 --> 01:43:45.917]  That is how perverted the training has become.
[01:43:46.437 --> 01:43:49.259]  And that's being driven out of Washington, D.C.
[01:43:49.259 --> 01:43:50.920]  That's coming from Homeland Security.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.941]  It's coming from the FBI.
[01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:57.164]  It's also coming from the war games that we see being done by the military, where they're training.
[01:43:57.164 --> 01:43:58.585]  I mean, Joe Biggs and I went to A.P.
[01:43:58.585 --> 01:43:59.425]  Hill.
[01:43:59.425 --> 01:44:00.806]  We walked through the area there.
[01:44:00.806 --> 01:44:05.689]  You could see how they're training for warfare against the American people.
[01:44:05.689 --> 01:44:07.150]  And, of course, they have other facilities.
[01:44:07.150 --> 01:44:12.554]  They have a facility at Camp Lejeune, where it's a more urban, rather a more rural environment.
[01:44:12.554 --> 01:44:13.635]  The one in A.P.
[01:44:13.635 --> 01:44:15.095]  Hill was a more urban environment.
[01:44:16.175 --> 01:44:17.096]  That's what they're training for.
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:31.881]  I think we do.
[01:44:31.881 --> 01:44:32.361]  I think we do.
[01:44:32.361 --> 01:44:33.883]  It's in Spokane, nevertheless.
[01:44:33.883 --> 01:44:38.166]  But we tried to contact Mikhail Thelin, who wrote the article.
[01:44:38.166 --> 01:44:40.027]  Someone sent us the video clip.
[01:44:40.027 --> 01:44:40.668]  He wrote the article.
[01:44:40.668 --> 01:44:43.190]  He tried to contact the police chief.
[01:44:43.190 --> 01:44:44.511]  They did not have any comments.
[01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:52.117]  But we did get a comment from someone who's there in state government in Washington, in Spokane.
[01:44:52.117 --> 01:44:53.578]  And it truly is outrageous.
[01:44:53.578 --> 01:44:54.739]  I agree with you.
[01:44:54.739 --> 01:44:55.299]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:44:55.299 --> 01:44:56.861]  Let's go to Wayne in Texas.
[01:44:56.861 --> 01:44:57.061]  Wayne?
[01:44:59.805 --> 01:45:03.708]  Uh, yeah, David, I think it's saying it's possibly just another false flag.
[01:45:03.708 --> 01:45:14.374]  I was watching it this morning and, uh, you see the cops come out after the hostage, you know, okay, if the cops in there, why didn't they do the flash bang thing while they were in there?
[01:45:14.374 --> 01:45:20.378]  Uh, and then in another little video, it looked like another cop came out another door.
[01:45:20.378 --> 01:45:24.481]  So I think this is Australia's indoctrination into the police state.
[01:45:25.236 --> 01:45:39.101]  Well, certainly it looks like they're going to try to spin this into ISIS, even though this man, who was the presumed hostage taker, had no connections to ISIS or al-Nusra.
[01:45:39.101 --> 01:45:45.623]  Nevertheless, we've got a former CIA chief, we have this article up on Infowars.com, says ISIS is going to attack the U.S.
[01:45:45.623 --> 01:45:45.823]  soon.
[01:45:46.403 --> 01:45:47.064]  So that's it.
[01:45:47.064 --> 01:45:49.205]  They're trying to make that connection.
[01:45:49.205 --> 01:45:53.328]  And you know, most Americans are going to look at this and they're going to say, yeah, that's right.
[01:45:53.328 --> 01:45:57.731]  We need to declare war on somebody in the Middle East and let's go get these guys.
[01:45:57.731 --> 01:46:02.434]  And they're not going to make the distinction as to whether or not this guy was a lone shooter.
[01:46:02.434 --> 01:46:06.917]  They're going to instantly identify him with ISIS or al-Nusra in their minds.
[01:46:06.917 --> 01:46:08.858]  And then they're going to justify going to war.
[01:46:08.858 --> 01:46:10.920]  That's why you have these types of things.
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.801]  But that certainly is how it's going to be used.
[01:46:15.582 --> 01:46:16.202]  Thank you, Wayne.
[01:46:16.202 --> 01:46:18.483]  Let's go to Tim in Tennessee.
[01:46:18.483 --> 01:46:20.924]  Tim?
[01:46:20.924 --> 01:46:21.565]  Hi.
[01:46:21.565 --> 01:46:23.586]  Hey, go ahead.
[01:46:23.586 --> 01:46:28.828]  I just wanted to say, this nonsense about the Republicans taking over again.
[01:46:28.828 --> 01:46:36.811]  I'm 59 years old, and the same thing has been going on, Democrat, Republican, Democrat, Republican.
[01:46:36.811 --> 01:46:40.533]  One's going to fix it, the other one is going to fix it, and it's never going to change.
[01:46:40.533 --> 01:46:42.494]  But besides that, my thing is,
[01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:47.773]  I want to know when somebody's going to come out and start saying it like it is.
[01:46:47.773 --> 01:46:51.755]  These people, like, alright, perfect example, Obama.
[01:46:51.755 --> 01:46:58.759]  When he traded that guy's bird call for four people in Guantanamo Bay.
[01:46:58.759 --> 01:47:00.220]  That was a felony.
[01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:02.481]  How come he wasn't indicted?
[01:47:02.481 --> 01:47:04.183]  Oh yeah.
[01:47:04.183 --> 01:47:06.924]  He can't get indicted because he's president or something?
[01:47:06.924 --> 01:47:12.127]  And all the people that go along with it, isn't that conspiracy if they go along with a crime?
[01:47:12.127 --> 01:47:12.568]  Absolutely.
[01:47:14.127 --> 01:47:31.280]  So I'm wondering why the people who supposedly thought we the people aren't coming out and saying these people should be indicted, held accountable, and if prison time is due after they get convicted, because they will be convicted, these people are just out of control.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:39.406]  Well, the problem is, is that the Republicans, I don't believe, really want to constrain anybody's power, because they just want to get the levers of power.
[01:47:39.406 --> 01:47:42.248]  That's the underlying problem with all of this, and that's the corruption.
[01:47:42.935 --> 01:47:55.505]  When you look at what just happened with the budget bill, when you look at the fact that they ran on shutting down Obamacare, on turning back amnesty, which is not even an executive order.
[01:47:55.505 --> 01:47:59.468]  I mean, it was just a decree from Obama.
[01:47:59.468 --> 01:48:01.590]  Later on in the week, we're going to have Jerome Corsi on again.
[01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:04.572]  We had him a couple of weeks ago when he looked at the actual record.
[01:48:05.333 --> 01:48:08.456]  And saw that Obama never filed any order.
[01:48:08.456 --> 01:48:09.437]  He didn't sign anything.
[01:48:09.437 --> 01:48:13.721]  He signed a couple of orders in front of the press and said he was signing an amnesty order.
[01:48:13.721 --> 01:48:15.082]  And yet, he didn't.
[01:48:15.082 --> 01:48:15.983]  He didn't sign anything.
[01:48:15.983 --> 01:48:17.104]  He didn't file anything.
[01:48:17.104 --> 01:48:18.164]  He's just pronouncing it.
[01:48:18.164 --> 01:48:27.433]  And of course, the real issue here, what they're really trying to get out in front of people, is the message to people all over the world that anyone can come here
[01:48:28.013 --> 01:48:31.195]  And live off of the American state.
[01:48:31.195 --> 01:48:32.076]  That's the real message.
[01:48:32.076 --> 01:48:36.218]  They want to incentivize illegal, uncontrolled, open immigration.
[01:48:36.218 --> 01:48:38.060]  And it's a way to take this country down.
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:41.582]  And of course the Republicans don't want to push back against that because the U.S.
[01:48:41.582 --> 01:48:45.504]  Chamber of Commerce and big business wants to have open borders.
[01:48:45.504 --> 01:48:49.467]  They want to have competition at the bottom end of the wage scale.
[01:48:49.467 --> 01:48:52.108]  So they're not going to do anything to prosecute this.
[01:48:53.129 --> 01:48:54.590]  Issue after issue after issue.
[01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:57.352]  They could have taken Obama to court.
[01:48:57.352 --> 01:49:00.394]  They could have impeached him.
[01:49:00.394 --> 01:49:02.616]  They could have jailed people who were underneath him.
[01:49:02.616 --> 01:49:05.758]  But they don't prosecute any of these issues because they want to keep the power.
[01:49:05.758 --> 01:49:07.739]  Thank you so much, Tim, in Tennessee.
[01:49:07.739 --> 01:49:09.500]  Let's go to Robin in Oklahoma.
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.322]  Robin.
[01:49:11.322 --> 01:49:17.306]  David, I just wanted to make a statement about the assassin.
[01:49:19.435 --> 01:49:37.867]  There's a picture on the Facebook page of the abolitionist website that shows the exact same police officer arresting Nareesh Patel, the same one arrested pro-lifers abolitionists last year.
[01:49:37.867 --> 01:49:43.270]  So this lesser magistrate can be on both sides of the law.
[01:49:44.022 --> 01:49:50.605]  They were not breaking the law at all, but the same police officer arrested both sides.
[01:49:50.605 --> 01:49:51.525]  Wow, wow.
[01:49:51.525 --> 01:50:00.709]  So the picture that you see, of course he's been arrested before, he's been charged several times, and he keeps getting away with it.
[01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:02.710]  Kind of like the CIA, doesn't he?
[01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:04.291]  Almost looks like they want that to happen.
[01:50:05.177 --> 01:50:08.459]  Only when he wasn't killing babies is when he was arrested.
[01:50:08.459 --> 01:50:11.241]  This is where we are in our country.
[01:50:11.241 --> 01:50:11.982]  That's true.
[01:50:11.982 --> 01:50:12.822]  Yeah.
[01:50:12.822 --> 01:50:13.163]  Yeah.
[01:50:13.163 --> 01:50:14.944]  Very, very ironic, isn't it?
[01:50:14.944 --> 01:50:21.748]  But of course he was exposing the women there to something that was very dangerous.
[01:50:21.748 --> 01:50:23.049]  And they were not even pregnant.
[01:50:23.049 --> 01:50:27.592]  But he was telling them that they were pregnant and giving them RU-486, as we pointed out earlier in the show.
[01:50:28.693 --> 01:50:29.974]  That can cause hemorrhaging.
[01:50:29.974 --> 01:50:31.155]  It can be very dangerous.
[01:50:31.155 --> 01:50:41.001]  That's why we had the bill that was passed here in Texas that said that made qualifications for abortion clinics that they had to be able to handle complications.
[01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:43.402]  And there was a big kickback on that.
[01:50:43.402 --> 01:50:44.883]  It didn't work too well for Wendy Davis.
[01:50:44.883 --> 01:50:48.745]  That's what she based her entire political career on and she was defeated by Greg Abbott.
[01:50:48.745 --> 01:50:50.626]  We're going to be right back taking your calls.
[01:50:50.626 --> 01:50:51.167]  Stay with us.

[01:52:00.424 --> 01:52:05.789]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[01:52:05.789 --> 01:52:09.653]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[01:52:09.653 --> 01:52:14.798]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[01:52:14.798 --> 01:52:16.700]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:20.184]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[01:52:20.184 --> 01:52:23.067]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[01:52:23.707 --> 01:52:29.693]  After consuming one world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[01:52:29.693 --> 01:52:36.719]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pitter remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[01:52:36.719 --> 01:52:39.122]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[01:52:39.802 --> 01:52:43.605]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[01:52:43.605 --> 01:52:44.526]  Wow!
[01:52:44.526 --> 01:52:45.006]  Call 888-988-3325.

[01:52:59.042 --> 01:53:04.365]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[01:53:04.365 --> 01:53:11.230]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.
[01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:18.695]  If this sounds familiar, call us now, because we're shipping free bottles of Super Beta Prostate to listeners of this station.

[01:53:42.727 --> 01:53:46.968]  This Super Beta Prostate free offer is for listeners of this station.

[01:54:10.289 --> 01:54:13.993]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:13.993 --> 01:54:16.075]  I'm David Knight.
[01:54:16.075 --> 01:54:23.562]  On this Monday, December 15, 2014, Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us in the next hour to talk about this development in Sydney, Australia.
[01:54:23.562 --> 01:54:25.604]  We had a captive situation there.
[01:54:25.604 --> 01:54:28.026]  Australian hostages have been freed there.
[01:54:28.026 --> 01:54:32.251]  He's going to update us on the details of that, as well as looking at what's behind it.
[01:54:32.871 --> 01:54:37.675]  Reports have come out that the man responsible for taking Australian hostages is an Iranian mystic.
[01:54:37.675 --> 01:54:40.698]  That's an article up on Infowars.com from Kurt Nemo.
[01:54:40.698 --> 01:54:42.099]  He is not ISIS.
[01:54:42.099 --> 01:54:43.860]  He is not al-Nusra.
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:45.682]  He's not al-Qaeda.
[01:54:45.682 --> 01:54:47.824]  But of course, it's going to be used for that, I believe.
[01:54:47.824 --> 01:54:52.487]  The former CIA chief says that ISIS will attack the US soon.
[01:54:52.487 --> 01:54:55.650]  That's an article up by Kit Daniels on Infowars.com.
[01:54:55.650 --> 01:54:57.712]  So we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson in the next hour.
[01:54:58.532 --> 01:55:03.955]  Get his take on what he believes happened there, as well as how that is going to be used.
[01:55:03.955 --> 01:55:06.937]  But right now, we're taking your calls before he joins us.
[01:55:06.937 --> 01:55:09.879]  And let's go to John in Oklahoma.
[01:55:09.879 --> 01:55:12.140]  John, you want to talk about Australia?
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:13.001]  Yes, I do.
[01:55:13.001 --> 01:55:23.347]  First, let me ask, there was a news item last week on Tuesday, I think it was, on The Blaze, about some mayor here in the United States.
[01:55:23.347 --> 01:55:27.189]  I didn't catch that early, first couple of sentences of his message.
[01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:34.000]  That he believes that owning weapons is a mental illness.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:42.954]  He sent out his police force door to door to houses and apartments asking the residents there if they had guns and if so would they please turn them in.
[01:55:44.406 --> 01:55:58.637]  Well, that's essentially what we heard from that deputy in Spokane, Washington, that they needed those MRAPs because they had Constitutionalists out there with weapons and lots of ammunition.
[01:55:58.637 --> 01:56:00.058]  Australia.
[01:56:00.058 --> 01:56:00.699]  What's that?
[01:56:00.699 --> 01:56:04.382]  I lived down in Australia for a year, but that's been several years ago.
[01:56:04.382 --> 01:56:08.265]  I've been corresponding with a woman from 2009 until today.
[01:56:10.686 --> 01:56:15.708]  And she told me in 2009, they had a terrible drought down there.
[01:56:15.708 --> 01:56:25.151]  And at that time, there was a very suspected how roaring fire, you know, I mean, a brush fire.
[01:56:25.151 --> 01:56:26.051]  Yes.
[01:56:26.051 --> 01:56:27.792]  The flames were four stories tall.
[01:56:27.792 --> 01:56:29.953]  They were traveling at 60 miles an hour.
[01:56:29.953 --> 01:56:36.995]  They burned out five towns just north of Melbourne, killing well over 200 Australians.
[01:56:36.995 --> 01:56:38.896]  They were looking for two Middle East
[01:56:39.668 --> 01:56:43.572]  Man who were in that area prior to the fire breaking out.
[01:56:43.572 --> 01:56:54.723]  Those men later were seen leaving on aircraft out of the country under false passports that were provided by their embassies.
[01:56:54.723 --> 01:57:03.872]  And there were three more they were seeking and they think they disappeared by some ship that was brought to the coast and then took them away quietly that way.
[01:57:04.434 --> 01:57:28.570]  Well that underscores why we always need to look carefully at any of these incidents to make sure that we're not being goaded into a war with somebody that is not really a threat to us because false flags, whether they're Reichstag fires or whether they're outback wildfires, can always be used to pump up the population to go attack somebody else at the will that our government wants to go fight for whatever reason.
[01:57:28.570 --> 01:57:33.473]  You told me that there's a tremendous public backlash against allowing
[01:57:34.498 --> 01:57:35.298]  I don't know.
[01:57:56.499 --> 01:57:56.779]  British
[01:58:13.277 --> 01:58:14.397]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:56.199 --> 01:58:57.039]  Security alert.
[01:58:57.039 --> 01:58:58.260]  Security alert.
[01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:00.261]  This is Homeland Security.

[01:59:17.530 --> 01:59:19.691]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:20.211 --> 01:59:21.352]  People are assaulting us.
[01:59:21.352 --> 01:59:24.173]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:24.173 --> 01:59:26.133]  They are never going to stop.
[01:59:26.133 --> 01:59:30.155]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:59:44.561 --> 01:59:46.962]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:59:52.585 --> 01:59:55.210]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:06.092 --> 02:00:07.394]  Big Brother.

[02:00:12.499 --> 02:00:14.041]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.041 --> 02:00:18.245]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.245 --> 02:00:22.310]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.906 --> 02:00:28.247]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:28.247 --> 02:00:30.648]  I'm David Knight on this Monday, December 15th, 2014.
[02:00:30.648 --> 02:00:36.730]  We're going to be joining Paul Joseph Watson in the UK, or rather he's going to be joining us.
[02:00:36.730 --> 02:00:39.471]  We're going to talk about what's going on in Sydney.
[02:00:39.471 --> 02:00:41.492]  We're now starting to get a little bit of information.
[02:00:41.492 --> 02:00:47.754]  I was just told that they're now saying that two hostages have died, as well as the man who had taken them hostage.
[02:00:47.754 --> 02:00:48.995]  How is that going to be used?
[02:00:48.995 --> 02:00:53.056]  What is that going to mean for Australia, for all of us?
[02:00:53.056 --> 02:00:53.817]  Is that going to be
[02:00:55.902 --> 02:01:01.985]  An example to take us to war in the Middle East so that we can shut down ISIS.
[02:01:01.985 --> 02:01:06.328]  Yet we see that this guy has no connections to ISIS or al-Nusra.
[02:01:06.328 --> 02:01:13.172]  Nevertheless, our former CIA Director Morrell says that the terrorist attack in the US is guaranteed.
[02:01:13.172 --> 02:01:15.874]  He says ISIS has had a focus on Australia for some time.
[02:01:15.874 --> 02:01:20.557]  So by innuendo, they can make this connection, they can try to drive us to war.
[02:01:20.557 --> 02:01:22.138]  So we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:01:22.718 --> 02:01:29.224]  As to what's behind this and, of course, what's ahead of us in terms of this attack, how is it going to be used.
[02:01:29.224 --> 02:01:31.326]  Right now, in this segment, though, I wanted to take your calls.
[02:01:31.326 --> 02:01:33.668]  I wanted to go to Darryl in Kansas.
[02:01:33.668 --> 02:01:39.493]  We also had the story that broke last Friday that we talked about through the weekend about the Spokane, Washington.
[02:01:40.153 --> 02:01:50.399]  Officer, the Sheriff's Deputy, who was talking about his MRAP and how when questioned why he needed this kind of capability, he said, well, we have all these constitutionalists in the area.
[02:01:50.399 --> 02:01:54.662]  Daryl in Kansas says that he called the Spokane, Washington Police Department.
[02:01:54.662 --> 02:01:57.163]  Daryl, what did they tell you?
[02:01:57.163 --> 02:02:03.247]  I'm looking at their website right now and it says they're hiring.
[02:02:03.247 --> 02:02:03.707]  Hello?
[02:02:03.707 --> 02:02:05.188]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:02:05.188 --> 02:02:06.429]  Yeah, it says they're hiring.
[02:02:06.429 --> 02:02:07.369]  I'm looking at their website.
[02:02:07.369 --> 02:02:08.210]  Yes, I did call.
[02:02:09.145 --> 02:02:10.926]  Uh, the woman thought it was very laughable.
[02:02:10.926 --> 02:02:18.972]  I wish I would have recorded it to put it on the internet, but I asked her, uh, why is that guy not like constitutionalists?
[02:02:18.972 --> 02:02:21.493]  Didn't he take an oath to uphold the constitution?
[02:02:21.493 --> 02:02:24.075]  And she's all, I don't know what oath they take.
[02:02:24.075 --> 02:02:26.496]  I haven't been to any of the ceremonies.
[02:02:26.496 --> 02:02:30.039]  And she was very much like I was bothering and laughed.
[02:02:30.039 --> 02:02:32.921]  And I'd like to say you do a great job, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:02:35.299 --> 02:02:36.239]  Well, you know, that's just it.
[02:02:36.239 --> 02:02:38.761]  They don't really pay any attention to what they pledge to.
[02:02:38.761 --> 02:02:41.063]  They don't pay any attention to the Constitution.
[02:02:41.063 --> 02:02:45.767]  They don't take it seriously enough to really look at what they're pledging to.
[02:02:45.767 --> 02:02:55.434]  But, of course, we have to take it seriously, and we have to understand that anything that the government does that is not in alignment with the Constitution is not legitimate.
[02:02:56.431 --> 02:02:59.173]  Because that is the supreme law of the land.
[02:02:59.173 --> 02:03:00.054]  That is the king.
[02:03:00.054 --> 02:03:05.459]  These guys are merely stewards put in place to serve that higher principle.
[02:03:05.459 --> 02:03:06.760]  That law that is king.
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:09.102]  That was a principle that they established during the American Revolution.
[02:03:09.102 --> 02:03:10.724]  They said, Lex Rex.
[02:03:10.724 --> 02:03:12.425]  In other words, the law is king.
[02:03:13.286 --> 02:03:16.968]  And if they don't understand that, then they don't.
[02:03:16.968 --> 02:03:18.869]  That is the heart of all of our issues.
[02:03:18.869 --> 02:03:22.331]  And I would broaden it out a little bit to this as well.
[02:03:22.331 --> 02:03:28.114]  I think the fundamental problem with so many Christians who don't understand Romans 13 is the same thing.
[02:03:28.114 --> 02:03:30.256]  They don't understand that when the government
[02:03:31.076 --> 02:03:37.561]  is not aligned under the principles of God, then that government is no longer legitimate.
[02:03:37.561 --> 02:03:45.587]  In the same way that when the police or various other aspects of the government are not aligned under the Constitution, they are no longer legitimate.
[02:03:45.587 --> 02:03:48.108]  That's the fundamental issue here.
[02:03:48.108 --> 02:03:55.274]  They're not operating as a legitimate government when they deny the ultimate authority that they have for governing.
[02:03:55.274 --> 02:03:56.895]  That's why they take an oath to the Constitution.
[02:03:56.895 --> 02:03:57.715]  Thank you so much, Darrell.
[02:03:57.715 --> 02:03:59.537]  Let's go to Michael in South Carolina.
[02:03:59.537 --> 02:03:59.757]  Michael?
[02:04:01.161 --> 02:04:02.421]  Hi, David.
[02:04:02.421 --> 02:04:04.202]  Oh, yes, I guess it's Michelle then, right?
[02:04:04.202 --> 02:04:05.963]  Go ahead.
[02:04:05.963 --> 02:04:07.463]  I had my ear plugged in.
[02:04:07.463 --> 02:04:08.743]  Go ahead.
[02:04:08.743 --> 02:04:26.409]  My first real quick comment was, I was born and raised in Spokane, and I've only been gone for about five years, and I'm really shocked that the police department has gone downhill so terribly in the short of time, because the cops seriously weren't like that, you know, five, ten years ago.
[02:04:26.932 --> 02:04:27.452]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:04:27.452 --> 02:04:30.013]  We've seen a massive and rapid change.
[02:04:30.013 --> 02:04:31.173]  And where do you think that's coming from?
[02:04:31.173 --> 02:04:33.414]  That's coming from Washington.
[02:04:33.414 --> 02:04:35.535]  It's the way they're being trained.
[02:04:35.535 --> 02:04:45.097]  Just recently, as we're talking about what was going on in New Mexico, there was a fellow teaching at the police academy, the state police academy, and he says, I refuse to teach this shoot first curriculum.
[02:04:45.097 --> 02:04:49.039]  He's somebody who'd been teaching at the police academy for a long time.
[02:04:49.039 --> 02:04:49.819]  It's different.
[02:04:50.499 --> 02:04:54.206]  They're setting up different rules for the police and we need to be very concerned about that.
[02:04:54.206 --> 02:04:58.513]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK to talk about what happened in Sydney.
[02:05:00.905 --> 02:05:06.407]  As the year is coming to a close, we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the past year.
[02:05:06.407 --> 02:05:09.708]  We take a step back and thank God for what we have.
[02:05:09.708 --> 02:05:12.789]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:12.789 --> 02:05:18.971]  At Diamond Gusset, we are celebrating the brush fires of liberty that are spreading across this great nation.
[02:05:18.971 --> 02:05:21.431]  Another thing we are celebrating is you.
[02:05:21.431 --> 02:05:26.673]  Without the valued listeners of Alex Jones and our loyal customers, we wouldn't be here today.
[02:05:27.313 --> 02:05:30.354]  We offer a wonderful online shopping experience.

[02:05:51.730 --> 02:05:57.360]  Thanks for believing in our dream, the original 100% American-made Diamond Gusset jean.
[02:06:00.225 --> 02:06:01.485]  Another major health threat.
[02:06:01.485 --> 02:06:06.466]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the waters.
[02:06:06.466 --> 02:06:09.147]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:06:09.147 --> 02:06:16.168]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:06:16.168 --> 02:06:19.169]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:06:19.169 --> 02:06:22.129]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:06:22.129 --> 02:06:24.149]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:27.010]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:06:27.090 --> 02:06:32.793]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:06:32.793 --> 02:06:36.295]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:06:36.295 --> 02:06:39.396]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:06:39.396 --> 02:06:46.720]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:06:58.246 --> 02:07:01.889]  2015 is almost here.
[02:07:01.889 --> 02:07:04.831]  And with it comes those New Year's resolutions.
[02:07:04.831 --> 02:07:07.673]  To finally transform your body the way you want it.
[02:07:07.673 --> 02:07:11.596]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[02:07:11.596 --> 02:07:13.237]  Make this year different.
[02:07:13.237 --> 02:07:15.439]  By equipping yourself with Oxy-Powder.
[02:07:15.439 --> 02:07:18.061]  The next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[02:07:18.061 --> 02:07:19.762]  Using Super Oxygenation.
[02:07:19.762 --> 02:07:20.723]  Oxy-Powder.
[02:07:20.723 --> 02:07:22.704]  Available through Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:22.704 --> 02:07:23.885]  Gently cleanses the body.
[02:07:24.045 --> 02:07:32.393]  While you sleep with EZ Capsules, tens of thousands of individuals have used Oxy Powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[02:07:32.393 --> 02:07:38.018]  Even InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using Oxy Powder with incredible success.
[02:07:38.018 --> 02:07:40.520]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:41.821]  Twelve pounds melted off.
[02:07:41.821 --> 02:07:43.162]  In about a week, I'd say a week.
[02:07:43.162 --> 02:07:43.603]  Seven days.
[02:07:44.704 --> 02:07:45.885]  2015 can be different.
[02:07:45.885 --> 02:07:49.108]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[02:07:49.108 --> 02:07:51.311]  Oxy Powder flushes it out.
[02:07:51.311 --> 02:07:54.294]  Secure your Oxy Powder at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:54.294 --> 02:07:56.156]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:08:12.659 --> 02:08:13.800]  Big Brother.
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:15.580]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:17.521]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:17.521 --> 02:08:19.182]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:08:19.182 --> 02:08:20.843]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:20.843 --> 02:08:25.345]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.407 --> 02:08:29.668]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:31.209]  I'm David Knight on this Monday, December 15, 2014.
[02:08:31.209 --> 02:08:35.753]  We're going to be going to Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[02:08:35.753 --> 02:08:41.618]  He's going to update us on the situation in Sydney, what's behind it, how they're going to use it.
[02:08:41.618 --> 02:08:47.884]  Before we go to him, though, I want to let you know this is the first time we've ever had a sale for X2, Survival Shield X2.
[02:08:47.884 --> 02:08:49.065]  It's our first sale.
[02:08:49.065 --> 02:08:49.585]  It's a big one.
[02:08:49.585 --> 02:08:50.606]  17% off and free shipping.
[02:08:52.728 --> 02:08:56.389]  With shipping, you would have normally paid up to $38 a bottle.
[02:08:56.389 --> 02:08:58.230]  Now you can get it for just $24.99.
[02:08:58.230 --> 02:09:02.211]  This is a sale that's going to run through next Monday only.
[02:09:02.211 --> 02:09:06.592]  And you have another two days to order it to get it guaranteed Christmas delivery.
[02:09:06.592 --> 02:09:09.393]  That's at Infowarslife.com.
[02:09:09.393 --> 02:09:11.093]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:09:11.093 --> 02:09:17.515]  The next level of survival shield with a powerful 650 micrograms of iodine per single drop.
[02:09:18.666 --> 02:09:20.047]  Now going to Paul.
[02:09:20.047 --> 02:09:24.190]  Paul, before we start talking about Sydney, I just want to let you know and get your comments on it.
[02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:30.974]  We've had an update to this story out of Washington, Spokane, where Mikhail is putting an update on his story.
[02:09:30.974 --> 02:09:41.902]  He actually did finally get a comment from the police department there, and they said they thought that for us to put this up and say that this officer had a problem with constitutionalism was a cheap shot.
[02:09:42.614 --> 02:09:43.874]  That was taken out of context.
[02:09:43.874 --> 02:09:48.136]  So I would invite people to take a look at that video and see if you think it's out of context.
[02:09:48.136 --> 02:09:56.498]  The context was, the lady asked this sheriff's deputy, after he was bragging about the capabilities of his new MRAP, why would you need that?
[02:09:56.498 --> 02:10:01.999]  And he goes into detail, talking about how well we need it because of constitutionalists and these people who have a lot of ammunition.
[02:10:01.999 --> 02:10:04.080]  I don't see that that's taken out of context.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:05.961]  I don't think that's a cheap shot.
[02:10:05.961 --> 02:10:16.409]  I think the cheap shot is coming out of Homeland Security and the FBI demonizing anybody that might be political opposition to an authoritarian police state.
[02:10:16.409 --> 02:10:17.570]  Paul, what's your comment on that?
[02:10:18.823 --> 02:10:24.905]  Well, I mean, exactly as you said, if you watch the clip, his comments, you know, they hang on themselves.
[02:10:24.905 --> 02:10:27.026]  This is clearly not out of context.
[02:10:27.026 --> 02:10:29.587]  It is part of this underlying trend.
[02:10:29.587 --> 02:10:36.890]  I mean, I've written stories over the past few months about how they're purchasing these armoured vehicles for, quote, war on veterans.
[02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:41.672]  That was one of the headlines that was used in a local news story about the issue.
[02:10:41.672 --> 02:10:42.672]  So there's definitely
[02:10:43.332 --> 02:10:59.757]  An issue with them militarizing not only against Occupy protesters, we know that was a justification for the purchase of the Bearcat armor tank in New Hampshire to use against both Occupy and so-called sovereign citizens that came out in the public meetings.
[02:10:59.757 --> 02:11:03.759]  And as I said, many news reports saying that this is part of the war on veterans.
[02:11:03.759 --> 02:11:04.919]  They're saying that veterans are all
[02:11:05.219 --> 02:11:07.520]  Yeah, we see that in their training scenarios.
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:12.783]  We had that one training scenario that was put out there in South Carolina where I think they had the Tea Party aligning with Muslims.
[02:11:26.989 --> 02:11:29.050]  And they had to come in and put that down.
[02:11:29.050 --> 02:11:33.072]  I mean, it's just amazing the absurd scenarios that they're coming up with.
[02:11:33.072 --> 02:11:35.214]  But they're feeding these scenarios to the police.
[02:11:35.214 --> 02:11:47.360]  And obviously, the police are buying it without question to think that your enemy is somebody who is a constitutionalist when you're supposed to swear allegiance to the Constitution as the highest law on the land.
[02:11:48.881 --> 02:12:01.167]  I've just been talking about it to one of the callers who called in here and he called the police department in Washington and they essentially laughed at him about that when he asked why they would move against the Constitutionalists.
[02:12:01.167 --> 02:12:01.547]  Exactly.
[02:12:01.547 --> 02:12:09.891]  I mean, I wrote an article probably about a year ago now where this was an academic paper written by a top military official.
[02:12:10.858 --> 02:12:22.407]  Just Google Tea Party Insurrectionist Infowars and in that they detail a plot where Tea Party Insurrectionists would take over the city and they would have to use military force to repel them.
[02:12:22.407 --> 02:12:22.687]  That's right.
[02:12:22.687 --> 02:12:32.015]  So this is in their own academic documents, it's in their own training programs, it's out there for anybody to see and it's definitely one of the factors behind this militarization of police.
[02:12:32.655 --> 02:12:34.036]  It's not something that's new.
[02:12:34.036 --> 02:12:51.090]  Alex has had this in his documentaries a decade ago, but what we're seeing here is that it's now been taught long enough and broadly enough that we're actually seeing them confess to this and we're seeing them act upon this worldview that they've been taught.
[02:12:51.090 --> 02:12:53.372]  That's what's different about it in the last year or two.
[02:12:55.169 --> 02:12:56.070]  Exactly.
[02:12:56.070 --> 02:13:00.292]  Again, look at media narratives, as we're going to talk about with this Sydney situation.
[02:13:00.292 --> 02:13:05.275]  The media pushes this notion that veterans are out there waiting to explode.
[02:13:05.275 --> 02:13:12.820]  They don't actually analyse the issues behind why veterans are getting PTSD in the first place, why they're committing suicide en masse.
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:25.032]  It's just, this is the threat, we need to deal with it, and it's to justify this armoured build-up, which again is about them escalating a situation which the studies clearly show only causes more violence.
[02:13:25.032 --> 02:13:31.679]  So, I mean, across the board, watch the video for yourself, those comments are pretty clear, they're not taken out of context.
[02:13:31.679 --> 02:13:32.080]  Absolutely.
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:33.701]  Now, you mentioned the Sydney thing.
[02:13:33.701 --> 02:13:37.584]  I wanted to get you to bring us up to speed as to what the latest developments are.
[02:13:37.584 --> 02:13:39.345]  What have you heard about what's going on with Sydney?
[02:13:39.345 --> 02:13:42.167]  And then let's talk after that about what's behind it.
[02:13:42.167 --> 02:13:48.172]  What have you heard in terms of... Last I heard, it looked like they're now announcing that two hostages have been killed.
[02:13:48.172 --> 02:13:48.572]  Is that correct?
[02:13:49.818 --> 02:13:52.440]  Yeah, but it was over as of a few hours ago.
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:59.926]  They're saying that three are dead, including the gunman, so that suggests two hostages, maybe a police officer died.
[02:13:59.926 --> 02:14:01.327]  It's not being confirmed yet.
[02:14:01.327 --> 02:14:02.468]  The siege is now over.
[02:14:03.169 --> 02:14:09.191]  What I found interesting was, and this is what I study every single day, is media narratives.
[02:14:09.191 --> 02:14:20.775]  Because in the past year or so there seems to have been this shift in media narrative not to blame so-called lone wolf terror attacks on extremist Islamist ideology.
[02:14:21.375 --> 02:14:30.379]  You saw it in Canada recently with the Canadian Parliament attack, another attack in Canada when two Canadian soldiers were run over.
[02:14:30.379 --> 02:14:35.542]  You saw it with the New York incident where somebody attacked police officers with an axe.
[02:14:36.656 --> 02:14:38.597]  And you see it in this Sydney incident.
[02:14:38.597 --> 02:14:44.482]  In every single incident, there is clearly extremist, Islamist political motivation.
[02:14:44.482 --> 02:14:50.886]  Whether you believe these people are actually ISIS members or not, more likely they're just ISIS inspired.
[02:14:50.886 --> 02:14:57.891]  But this angle, even though it's clearly there, is now being kind of buried by the mainstream media.
[02:14:57.891 --> 02:15:00.934]  And I think that's mainly related to the fact that
[02:15:01.534 --> 02:15:09.564]  You know, the growth of ISIS in the first place was almost entirely as a result of the US government destabilizing Syria.
[02:15:10.248 --> 02:15:17.389]  The US government's allies, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, funding and arming ISIS to begin with.
[02:15:17.389 --> 02:15:24.811]  Now we have people from all over Europe, young men, flying over to Syria and Iraq to fight on behalf of ISIS.
[02:15:24.811 --> 02:15:34.813]  We have the so-called moderate rebels in Syria, which were never moderate to begin with, even when, you know, the CFR said back in 2012, let's basically support Al-Qaeda.
[02:15:35.553 --> 02:15:40.074]  We now see that the arms that we gave them are crossing over into ISIS hands.
[02:15:40.074 --> 02:15:55.619]  So when these actual organic attacks happen, ones that aren't provocateur by the authorities as they have been in the past, we're now kind of seeing the media bury the extremist political motivation behind them because there's a sense that they need to
[02:15:56.744 --> 02:16:06.950]  Distract from the fact that this is partially caused by blowback as a result of Western foreign policy, and we're seeing it again in what happened with the Sydney siege.
[02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:15.775]  Except that on the other side, too, we have this article up by Kit Daniels where we've got a former CIA chief saying that ISIS is going to attack the US soon.
[02:16:15.775 --> 02:16:16.135]  He says,
[02:16:17.236 --> 02:16:19.098]  Sometime over the next year or so.
[02:16:19.098 --> 02:16:20.159]  Guaranteed.
[02:16:20.159 --> 02:16:27.887]  So, I mean, it looks like they're at the same time they want to be politically correct and they want to distance themselves from this monster that they've created.
[02:16:27.887 --> 02:16:35.235]  On the other hand, I think they're more than capable of using that to justify yet another new war abroad, don't you?
[02:16:36.929 --> 02:16:39.251]  Yeah, and that's definitely an issue.
[02:16:39.251 --> 02:16:51.021]  But what I've noticed is obviously immediately after 9-11, any kind of attack whatsoever, they would immediately jump on the Islamist angle, push the hysterics, degrease the skids for war and military intervention.
[02:16:51.021 --> 02:16:52.522]  It seems they've flipped the opposite way.
[02:16:52.522 --> 02:16:54.384]  I mean, take this Sydney siege, for example.
[02:16:55.144 --> 02:17:04.966]  Now, the media narrative, now that this has ended, is that basically this guy was a lone nut, a criminal, and that he was not politically motivated.
[02:17:04.966 --> 02:17:11.768]  That he was out on bail for being an accessory to murder or other charges related to sexual offences.
[02:17:11.768 --> 02:17:18.489]  And they're now steering the narrative as to that was his motivation behind taking these dozens of hostages.
[02:17:18.489 --> 02:17:21.430]  But if you actually followed the story from the beginning,
[02:17:22.726 --> 02:17:29.748]  What evidence came out during the siege was completely ignored by the media and in fact censored in some cases.
[02:17:29.748 --> 02:17:45.391]  There were videos made by the hostages inside the cafe in Sydney where they said the hostage taker has told us to tell the world this is an ISIS attack and that the media is covering up the fact that it's an ISIS attack.
[02:17:45.391 --> 02:17:50.352]  We also know that the hostage taker demanded an ISIS flag
[02:17:50.996 --> 02:17:55.939]  We later saw a generic Islamic flag displayed in the cafe window.
[02:17:55.939 --> 02:18:04.343]  We had a Facebook post from one of the hostages who said, the man wants the world to know Australia is under attack by the Islamic State.
[02:18:04.343 --> 02:18:13.148]  Now even if this guy is not a member of ISIS, which, you know, he almost certainly isn't, this is obviously inspired by ISIS.
[02:18:13.148 --> 02:18:15.529]  But the media's completely buried that.
[02:18:15.529 --> 02:18:17.510]  Some of them don't even mention the fact.
[02:18:17.890 --> 02:18:21.855]  They agreed not to broadcast any of this information at the time.
[02:18:21.855 --> 02:18:34.311]  And even after the siege is now over, YouTube and Facebook are still deleting all these videos where these hostages say, this guy says he's a member of ISIS and that this is an ISIS attack on Australia.
[02:18:34.311 --> 02:18:35.252]  But very quickly,
[02:18:36.118 --> 02:18:48.750]  In the aftermath, we saw the media take this route where they buried that narrative and began to focus almost entirely on him being a lone figure and that he was just a criminal motivated by his own personal problems.
[02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:52.974]  So, this is a general trend that I've seen over the past year or so.
[02:18:53.794 --> 02:18:57.075]  And it relates to the fact that there are these individuals out there.
[02:18:57.075 --> 02:19:05.719]  We had reports on the southern border from police officials, respected officials, saying ISIS was active on the southern border just across there in Mexico.
[02:19:05.719 --> 02:19:09.060]  The DHS vehemently denied that over and over again.
[02:19:09.060 --> 02:19:18.944]  So this ties into that general trend of them downplaying Islamist extremist ideology linked to these lone wolf attacks because at the moment it doesn't fit their broader narrative.
[02:19:19.424 --> 02:19:21.006]  I think that's the key.
[02:19:21.006 --> 02:19:43.167]  At the moment it doesn't fit their broader narrative because we saw back in 2013 they were doing everything they could to try to start a war with Syria and using these same people and now after they've gotten Muslims abroad like this guy who basically is he could be a lone actor who is fired up about this but clearly he is motivated
[02:19:43.647 --> 02:19:47.678]  By his Islamicist attitudes with the signs and the flags that he put up there.
[02:19:47.678 --> 02:19:49.844]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:19:49.844 --> 02:19:50.285]  Stay with us.

[02:21:00.783 --> 02:21:04.645]  Before using Heart and Body Extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[02:21:04.645 --> 02:21:07.886]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[02:21:07.886 --> 02:21:09.427]  I was tired and lethargic.
[02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:17.111]  But after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.

[02:21:37.942 --> 02:21:43.786]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.

[02:24:16.220 --> 02:24:17.601]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:17.601 --> 02:24:18.841]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:24:18.841 --> 02:24:22.243]  Joining me from the UK is Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:24:22.243 --> 02:24:26.166]  We've been talking about the attack in Sydney.
[02:24:26.166 --> 02:24:26.926]  What's behind it?
[02:24:26.926 --> 02:24:28.007]  How is it being spun?
[02:24:28.007 --> 02:24:36.051]  We're going to go back to Paul Joseph Watson, but we're going to also take your calls beginning the next segment if you would like to weigh in and tell us what you think is behind it.
[02:24:36.051 --> 02:24:42.655]  As Paul has pointed out, it's kind of strange that as they were trying to ramp up a war in Syria, yet
[02:24:43.195 --> 02:24:46.960]  These most recent lone wolf attacks as they're being portrayed by the media.
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:56.711]  The media has changed the narrative not trying to tie these Islamist attacks in Canada and Australia, not trying to tie those to a broader agenda just yet.
[02:24:56.711 --> 02:25:01.196]  But of course we do see the CIA saying sometime this year we can expect to
[02:25:02.965 --> 02:25:06.746]  Guaranteed, we'll see some kind of an ISIS attack in America.
[02:25:06.746 --> 02:25:10.767]  Now that number, if you want to call in, is 800-259-9231.
[02:25:10.767 --> 02:25:14.728]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:25:14.728 --> 02:25:23.430]  Paul, going back to what you were talking about, I mean, it looks like they're deliberately trying to keep a lid on this, trying to make this about a single shooter.
[02:25:23.430 --> 02:25:24.270]  Do you think they're trying to
[02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:31.097]  To keep everything quiet until they've got more neocons sworn in from the recent election?
[02:25:31.097 --> 02:25:32.439]  What do you think is behind all this?
[02:25:34.488 --> 02:25:37.390]  I think they're doing it for a number of reasons.
[02:25:37.390 --> 02:25:39.971]  One of them is cultural sensitivity.
[02:25:39.971 --> 02:25:48.075]  I mean, there was a story which came out as this was developing, this viral hashtag campaign, I'll ride with you.
[02:25:48.075 --> 02:26:00.582]  There was a woman on a train or a bus in Sydney or in Australia who took off her hijab headscarf because she feared some kind of retribution from other Australians who would
[02:26:01.242 --> 02:26:01.723]  We're good to go.
[02:26:18.485 --> 02:26:30.388]  And, you know, as one person tweeted, who I retweeted, it cynically shifts the narrative of the Sydney siege away from violent Muslims by casting non-Muslims as the real danger.
[02:26:30.388 --> 02:26:34.409]  And that went on to completely dominate the narrative.
[02:26:34.409 --> 02:26:42.330]  And then you had the Sydney Morning Herald coming out and even suggesting that Australians should have, quote, empathy for the terrorists.
[02:26:42.330 --> 02:26:44.851]  They said, how should we feel for the perpetrator?
[02:26:45.783 --> 02:26:47.024]  And his family.
[02:26:47.024 --> 02:26:51.469]  So there was this kind of odd cultural sensitivity going on.
[02:26:51.469 --> 02:27:04.483]  Not so much sympathy focused on the actual hostages being terrorized inside the cafe, but a kind of deflection to blame Australians for Islamophobia that wasn't actually taking place.
[02:27:04.483 --> 02:27:06.945]  So that was another weird little element to this.
[02:27:07.546 --> 02:27:09.788]  Yeah, I know there's been a lot of complaints in Australia.
[02:27:09.788 --> 02:27:19.515]  They had people who were concerned and angry about the fact that Muslim women can wear a hijab in public, but nobody else can cover their face.
[02:27:19.515 --> 02:27:22.337]  They even had some protesters show up to the Capitol there, I think.
[02:27:22.337 --> 02:27:30.444]  One of them was wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood, and they made him take it off, and underneath it he had a Muslim hijab on it, you know, so it's like
[02:27:31.024 --> 02:27:40.390]  That's fine, I think maybe we'll all be able to wear masks if we want to with the surveillance state, but to let one group have it and not to let others have it, that was the issue.
[02:27:40.390 --> 02:27:41.550]  I think that was the sticking point.
[02:27:41.550 --> 02:27:45.873]  But yeah, it is very much a political correctness that's going on, isn't it?
[02:27:45.873 --> 02:27:54.739]  Yeah, and it reminds me of that story last week where the cop in Tennessee pulled over Saudi Arabians who had paper tags on their car.
[02:27:54.739 --> 02:27:58.621]  They said they had a dead baby in the trunk of the car.
[02:27:58.621 --> 02:28:00.042]  And he basically let them go.
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:01.981]  No questions asked.
[02:28:01.981 --> 02:28:04.644]  They were on their way because of cultural sensitivity.
[02:28:04.644 --> 02:28:07.667]  I never tried that when I got pulled over by the cops.
[02:28:07.667 --> 02:28:11.831]  I'm sorry, I never tried that when I got pulled over by the cops, but I guess it wouldn't work for me.
[02:28:13.752 --> 02:28:28.581]  Yeah, and he was praised by the police chief and this Islamic scholar that they consulted for the story, when obviously it doesn't matter what cultural sensitivity is in the background, it's a potential crime, you need to check it out.
[02:28:28.581 --> 02:28:32.144]  Police officers smell weed in somebody's car, they send them to jail.
[02:28:32.144 --> 02:28:36.747]  We've heard stories about that over and over again, so there is that element to it.
[02:28:36.747 --> 02:28:41.930]  I mean, the FBI crime stats which have just come out for last year are interesting because they show that
[02:28:42.606 --> 02:28:51.456]  Jews in America are four times more likely to be the victims of hate crimes than Muslims, and those crimes are less likely to be investigated.
[02:28:51.456 --> 02:28:54.559]  That's not neocon Zionist propaganda.
[02:28:54.559 --> 02:28:56.962]  It's FBI crime statistics.
[02:28:56.962 --> 02:28:57.903]  So it suggests that
[02:28:58.403 --> 02:29:08.948]  This Islamophobia thing again is being whipped up and generated by certain elements of the media for their own agenda and it's not actually a major problem in the West.
[02:29:08.948 --> 02:29:21.313]  But in the immediate aftermath of this Sydney siege, the main concern among many Australians, and this was the top trending hashtag on Twitter above anything else, was that Muslims on public transport might get some retribution.
[02:29:22.213 --> 02:29:26.994]  There was a sporadic report about some verbal abuse, but nothing really whatsoever.
[02:29:26.994 --> 02:29:30.735]  And that became the main focus of the whole story.
[02:29:30.735 --> 02:29:43.977]  And yet, what really happened here is that you had the Australian government, for whatever reason, fail to protect the people from a guy who was clearly violent and crazy with his long rap sheet.
[02:29:43.977 --> 02:29:48.158]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson, and we'll take your calls and comments.
[02:29:48.158 --> 02:29:48.738]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.418 --> 02:29:53.349]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[02:31:00.663 --> 02:31:04.325]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:04.325 --> 02:31:08.606]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.

[02:32:07.751 --> 02:32:11.692]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.

[02:32:31.979 --> 02:32:34.500]  Took it that first day and then I took it for six more days after that.
[02:32:34.500 --> 02:32:35.820]  Twelve pounds melted off.
[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:37.160]  In about a week, I'd say a week.
[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:38.101]  Seven days.
[02:32:38.101 --> 02:32:39.881]  And I've been able to keep it off, too.
[02:32:39.881 --> 02:32:41.501]  My wife's like, wow, you look really good.
[02:32:41.501 --> 02:32:42.802]  And I'm like, I know.
[02:32:42.802 --> 02:32:43.942]  I guess it's this Oxy-Powder.
[02:32:43.942 --> 02:32:45.982]  2015 can be different.
[02:32:45.982 --> 02:32:49.203]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[02:32:49.203 --> 02:32:51.403]  Oxy-Powder flushes it out.

[02:33:22.538 --> 02:33:30.565]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.565 --> 02:33:33.567]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:33.567 --> 02:33:37.070]  I'm David Knight, and we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK.
[02:33:37.070 --> 02:33:39.692]  We're going to be going back to your phone calls.
[02:33:39.692 --> 02:33:45.117]  Before we do, I want to let you know that we have the first sale ever of Survival Shield X2.
[02:33:45.117 --> 02:33:47.499]  It's the first time it's ever been on sale, and it's a great sale.
[02:33:47.499 --> 02:33:50.021]  We've got it for 17% off plus free shipping.
[02:33:50.581 --> 02:33:53.943]  Typically, with shipping, you would have paid up to $38.
[02:33:53.943 --> 02:33:55.923]  Now you can get it for just $24.99.
[02:33:55.923 --> 02:33:58.945]  This is a sale that's only going to run through next Monday.
[02:33:58.945 --> 02:34:02.346]  You have two days left if you want to get guaranteed Christmas delivery.
[02:34:02.346 --> 02:34:04.927]  Again, the sale will run for just one week.
[02:34:04.927 --> 02:34:08.329]  And of course, that's our Survival Shield X2.
[02:34:08.329 --> 02:34:13.411]  It's 50% stronger than the original Survival Shield formulation.
[02:34:13.411 --> 02:34:14.632]  Paul, let's take some calls.
[02:34:14.632 --> 02:34:16.933]  Let's go to Slim in Canada.
[02:34:16.933 --> 02:34:18.934]  Slim, you had a comment about ISIS.
[02:34:18.934 --> 02:34:19.234]  Go ahead.
[02:34:21.624 --> 02:34:22.145]  Oh, he has.
[02:34:22.145 --> 02:34:23.186]  Okay, he's dropped off.
[02:34:23.186 --> 02:34:25.528]  Let's go to Kevin in West Virginia.
[02:34:25.528 --> 02:34:26.889]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:34:26.889 --> 02:34:29.712]  Hey, Mr. Knight, and hey, Mr. Watson.
[02:34:29.712 --> 02:34:37.319]  I had a comment about torture and some comments about the police state here in West Virginia.
[02:34:37.319 --> 02:34:41.783]  My first comment about torture is two wrongs don't make a right.
[02:34:41.783 --> 02:34:47.448]  But I guess under this establishment and under Common Core, that two wrongs do make a right.
[02:34:48.481 --> 02:35:00.844]  And about the police state in West Virginia, I called the West Virginia State Police and the Martinsburg City Police, which is in Berkeley County in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.
[02:35:00.844 --> 02:35:13.488]  When I called the State Police of West Virginia and asked them about the MRAP vehicles, the lady on the line told me that it was for finding marijuana in the woods of West Virginia.
[02:35:13.488 --> 02:35:15.028]  And of course, you know, I had to laugh.
[02:35:15.606 --> 02:35:18.568]  I was like, come on lady, this is absolutely absurd.
[02:35:18.568 --> 02:35:26.873]  And when I called the Martinsburg City State, or Martinsburg City Police, um, Doug, I asked them the same question.
[02:35:26.873 --> 02:35:34.097]  At first I asked to speak to a public information officer and they didn't know what that was, but finally was able to talk to somebody.
[02:35:34.097 --> 02:35:44.163]  And the guy told me, um, the officer that came on the line told me that it was none of my business where, how they get their tactical gear and how they apply their tactical gear.
[02:35:44.816 --> 02:35:48.579]  And that if I call back again, that I would be subject to arrest.
[02:35:48.579 --> 02:35:53.443]  And they also said, Mr. Ballum, if we see you in Martinsburg, you might want to be careful.
[02:35:53.443 --> 02:35:57.166]  I'm like, wow, that blew my mind that they would tell me that.
[02:35:57.166 --> 02:36:00.849]  Yeah, it's none of your business because they don't work for you.
[02:36:00.849 --> 02:36:06.854]  Because they don't care about the Constitution, evidently, based on this person's comments in Washington.
[02:36:06.854 --> 02:36:10.778]  And as Paul pointed out, we've seen this over and over and over again.
[02:36:11.298 --> 02:36:16.423]  Going back to 2009, if you want, the MIAC report that came out of the Fusion Center.
[02:36:16.423 --> 02:36:23.551]  But even before that, Alex Jones was doing documentaries back in the late 90s, talking about the police state, how that was being encouraged.
[02:36:23.551 --> 02:36:28.977]  But of course, it has accelerated, it's gotten deeper, it's gotten broader, and it's all coming out of Washington.
[02:36:28.977 --> 02:36:30.258]  Paul, you want to comment on that?
[02:36:31.215 --> 02:36:40.658]  Yeah, I just find it funny, the notion that smoking marijuana would make somebody more likely to be violent, requiring an armoured vehicle response.
[02:36:40.658 --> 02:36:47.601]  If you've ever been around people who smoke marijuana, and it's the reason I don't smoke it, it's because it turns them into sedated zombies.
[02:36:47.601 --> 02:36:53.043]  Alcohol makes people more violent, but obviously they can't use that as a justification, so it's just bizarre.
[02:36:53.283 --> 02:36:59.004]  And along those lines, Paul, there was a story out today ahead of my stack here from truththeory.com.
[02:36:59.004 --> 02:37:05.046]  They point out that marijuana decreases death rates from painkillers by over 30 percent.
[02:37:05.046 --> 02:37:12.907]  It's very, very effective in terms of people who are under a great deal of pain for cancer.
[02:37:12.907 --> 02:37:19.569]  And they point out that it allows people to avoid these very dangerous prescription drugs that not only kill people, but
[02:37:20.209 --> 02:37:26.233]  Basically, affect you psychologically to make it so that you kill other people.
[02:37:26.233 --> 02:37:37.201]  Typically, all these shooters that we've seen have been involved in one way or the other with pharmaceutical drugs that affect your mental state in a very adverse way.
[02:37:37.201 --> 02:37:39.403]  They make you very violent, very paranoid.
[02:37:40.043 --> 02:37:43.227]  And as you point out, Paul, marijuana does not do that at all.
[02:37:43.227 --> 02:37:47.292]  Instead, it allows people to avoid these dangerous drugs.
[02:37:47.292 --> 02:37:52.558]  But we still see a huge pushback in terms of even allowing people to have it for medical uses.
[02:37:52.558 --> 02:37:54.120]  That, I think, is the saddest thing.
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:57.384]  I mean, you know, recreational stuff, prohibition doesn't work.
[02:37:57.384 --> 02:37:58.565]  We've proven that with alcohol.
[02:37:59.406 --> 02:38:11.960]  We know that there's a lot of beneficial uses for marijuana, for medical patients, for glaucoma, for increasing the appetite of people who are suffering from cancer, chemotherapy, HIV treatment.
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:12.861]  We understand that.
[02:38:12.861 --> 02:38:14.143]  It's not a question.
[02:38:14.143 --> 02:38:16.886]  Why wouldn't we allow people to have access to that?
[02:38:16.886 --> 02:38:19.709]  I think it's one of the most insane things about our society.
[02:38:20.740 --> 02:38:25.583]  Yeah, and from the financial perspective, I mean, look what it's done for the economy of Colorado.
[02:38:25.583 --> 02:38:29.925]  There are only benefits all around, so it makes no sense to continue that policy.
[02:38:29.925 --> 02:38:34.088]  And I think gradually now that's being overturned, which is the good news.
[02:38:34.088 --> 02:38:40.932]  But of course we go the other way, and we also say that hemp, even though it has absolutely no hallucinogens, hemp is also banned.
[02:38:40.932 --> 02:38:45.474]  And so we can't have hemp for substitutions for cotton, and that's where they end, of course.
[02:38:45.474 --> 02:38:46.235]  That's the issue.
[02:38:46.855 --> 02:38:51.419]  It's a competition to people who have vested interests in Washington.
[02:38:51.419 --> 02:38:54.442]  So that's a large part of why hemp as well is banned.
[02:38:54.442 --> 02:38:56.344]  Let's go to Bill in Oklahoma.
[02:38:56.344 --> 02:38:59.747]  Bill, go ahead.
[02:38:59.747 --> 02:39:02.810]  Okay, let's go to John in Washington.
[02:39:02.810 --> 02:39:03.330]  Go ahead, John.
[02:39:03.330 --> 02:39:05.492]  Hello, guys.
[02:39:07.356 --> 02:39:11.359]  A fellow who lived in Spokane, Washington.
[02:39:11.359 --> 02:39:14.822]  I am personally acquainted with Paul.
[02:39:14.822 --> 02:39:18.524]  Paul, you'll know who I am after you listen for a second.
[02:39:18.524 --> 02:39:29.532]  But I operated a large informational website in Spokane and I lived there and it got so bad with surveillance and harassment that I moved to a neighboring county.
[02:39:29.532 --> 02:39:33.395]  I live about 14 miles off the paved road
[02:39:34.168 --> 02:39:44.947]  And twice out here in recent history I have seen Bearcats on the dirt road right at sundown patrolling and they were not the same model.
[02:39:44.947 --> 02:39:46.430]  They were two different ones.
[02:39:47.026 --> 02:40:05.141]  So, Spokane has a multi-jurisdictional terrorism task force headed up by Darren DeRue, and his wife is the public relations officer for the city of Spokane Police Department, and Ozzy Knezovich
[02:40:05.761 --> 02:40:07.423]  Is the sheriff there.
[02:40:07.423 --> 02:40:23.836]  I've seen him numerous times stand on the stage with Sheriff Mac at the Liberty and Freedom rallies that we have here occasionally, which by the way the audience is completely full of feds when we have those, and stand up there and ballyhoo the Constitution.
[02:40:23.836 --> 02:40:26.238]  Yet he'll line up for all of this bootlicking.
[02:40:26.238 --> 02:40:32.803]  He'll do exactly anything that the federal police tell him to do.
[02:40:33.603 --> 02:41:00.665]  And I can tell you for a fact, I was in an adjacent county, minding my own business, 1045 one night in the year 2005, and on a telephone call from Spokane County to Stevens County, the Stevens County Sheriff, who was Craig Thayer, picked me up at my home, transported me across county lines, turned me over to the Spokane County Sheriff's Department,
[02:41:01.005 --> 02:41:09.347]  Who gulagged me for over a week without getting to see a magistrate with absolutely no telephone call whatsoever.
[02:41:09.347 --> 02:41:18.849]  I lost $36,000 in construction contracts because of it and nobody knew where I was and my dogs were locked in the house with no food.
[02:41:18.849 --> 02:41:29.151]  So, I can tell you for a fact that Spokane County not only handles Spokane County like a commissar, they actually dictate to Stephens County
[02:41:34.476 --> 02:41:50.951]  That's very interesting, John, because of the comments that we finally got from the Spokane Police Department where they said that those comments were taken out of context and that it was essentially a cheap shot
[02:41:51.451 --> 02:41:53.372]  No, really, you can look at that clip.
[02:41:53.372 --> 02:41:56.273]  Go to the article that we got up on Infowars.com.
[02:41:56.273 --> 02:41:58.954]  You can see the short clip for yourself.
[02:41:58.954 --> 02:42:01.335]  You can see that it's not out of context.
[02:42:01.335 --> 02:42:02.976]  We should play that again, guys.
[02:42:02.976 --> 02:42:05.697]  You can see that that clip is not out of context.
[02:42:05.697 --> 02:42:10.138]  And, of course, the bigger context is that this is going on across the country.
[02:42:10.138 --> 02:42:16.521]  And it's coming out of Washington through the FBI, through Homeland Security, through their training programs.
[02:42:16.721 --> 02:42:18.762]  Through the military's training scenarios.
[02:42:18.762 --> 02:42:20.803]  We've reported on this over and over again.
[02:42:20.803 --> 02:42:22.224]  That's the context.
[02:42:22.224 --> 02:42:25.486]  But you can clearly see, and let's play that clip again really quick.
[02:42:25.486 --> 02:42:27.167]  Can you guys get that ready?
[02:42:27.167 --> 02:42:36.773]  Well, the nice thing about this piece of equipment is that if somebody is directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in, they can pull right up to the front.
[02:42:36.773 --> 02:42:39.915]  They can still try to address the threat without being afraid of getting shot.
[02:42:43.877 --> 02:42:48.559]  So I'm thinking that is totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the U.S.
[02:42:48.559 --> 02:42:49.620]  would you see that happening?
[02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:53.642]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[02:42:53.642 --> 02:42:56.463]  A lot of ammunition.
[02:42:56.463 --> 02:43:01.085]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[02:43:01.085 --> 02:43:02.346]  A lot of ammunition.
[02:43:02.346 --> 02:43:03.947]  They have weapons here locally.
[02:43:06.488 --> 02:43:07.229]  There you go.
[02:43:07.229 --> 02:43:09.852]  So yeah, this is appropriate for Iraq, but what about here?
[02:43:09.852 --> 02:43:12.615]  And he goes, well yeah, here we've got constitutionalists.
[02:43:12.615 --> 02:43:13.976]  It was never about.
[02:43:14.784 --> 02:43:17.085]  The Islamic terrorists in Iraq.
[02:43:17.085 --> 02:43:22.508]  That was essentially a training program for them coming back home to America.
[02:43:22.508 --> 02:43:25.149]  Tyranny abroad always comes home.
[02:43:25.149 --> 02:43:27.371]  The founders of this country understood that.
[02:43:27.371 --> 02:43:33.874]  If we have a government that is no longer constrained by the Constitution, but comes after constitutionalists, that's the danger.
[02:43:33.874 --> 02:43:35.355]  And that's what it always turns into.
[02:43:35.355 --> 02:43:38.136]  We have developed a militarized standing army.
[02:43:38.136 --> 02:43:40.998]  That's what this program is all really about.
[02:43:40.998 --> 02:43:42.738]  And that's clearly come home.
[02:43:42.738 --> 02:43:43.659]  You have any comments, Paul?
[02:43:44.810 --> 02:43:50.676]  Yeah, when he says stockpiling weapons, that means owning guns.
[02:43:50.676 --> 02:43:57.582]  I mean, I've seen cases before where they raid somebody for stockpiling weapons and the guy owns like three or four guns.
[02:43:57.582 --> 02:44:00.465]  So it's crucial to understand what they actually mean when they say that.
[02:44:01.085 --> 02:44:03.987]  Also, you talked about it coming out of Washington.
[02:44:03.987 --> 02:44:08.629]  After Ferguson, Obama came out with all this rhetoric against the militarized police state.
[02:44:08.629 --> 02:44:19.756]  If you actually look at what he proposed the White House do about it, it was merely to encourage the local police departments to reform and have dialogue with civil rights leaders.
[02:44:19.756 --> 02:44:25.779]  So there was no teeth whatsoever in those so-called actions taken by the White House after Ferguson.
[02:44:25.779 --> 02:44:28.781]  They merely advised the police departments to look at their policy.
[02:44:29.401 --> 02:44:29.561]  Oh yeah.
[02:44:29.561 --> 02:44:31.383]  Nothing's going to happen from that perspective.
[02:44:31.383 --> 02:44:37.089]  And then make some proposals, which they didn't fund, to give cameras to all the police.
[02:44:37.089 --> 02:44:45.257]  Well, you know, we've had a lot of police departments who are wearing cameras and somehow they manage to miss recording whenever there's a misdeed in many of these cases.
[02:44:45.257 --> 02:44:50.142]  But of course, that wasn't going to change anything with the Eric Garner situation because that was recorded.
[02:44:50.788 --> 02:45:02.439]  And the other issue, the other answer that they had, trying to make it into a racial thing, was to say, well, we need to have more black police officers in communities that have a higher percentage of blacks in the police department.
[02:45:02.439 --> 02:45:10.046]  And yet, with Eric Garner, the entire process of him being choked to death there on the sidewalk was overseen by a female black officer.
[02:45:10.606 --> 02:45:12.726]  Who was watching that as it happened.
[02:45:12.726 --> 02:45:18.408]  So clearly, having more black police officers, having more cameras, that's not really going to solve anything.
[02:45:18.408 --> 02:45:20.368]  Let's go to Chris in Texas.
[02:45:20.368 --> 02:45:22.669]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:45:22.669 --> 02:45:23.369]  Yeah, how you doing?
[02:45:23.369 --> 02:45:25.529]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:45:25.529 --> 02:45:26.109]  Glad to get in.
[02:45:26.109 --> 02:45:31.131]  I wanted to talk about kind of... I've done some research over the last, I don't know, four or five years or so.
[02:45:31.131 --> 02:45:32.971]  Got a lot of disinformation.
[02:45:33.666 --> 02:45:35.106]  Well, I kind of connected the dots.
[02:45:35.106 --> 02:45:43.249]  I've seen some videos in the past, but one that really kind of explains everything in detail is a gentleman by the name of Kurt Kallenbach, I believe.
[02:45:43.249 --> 02:45:54.432]  And it's called Season of Treason, where he goes into detail, explains how it's under the United States Corporation and not... They're not working for the United States, for the people.
[02:45:54.432 --> 02:45:57.733]  It's all legal terms listed under persons.
[02:45:57.733 --> 02:45:59.954]  Gets into your DNA, your birth certificate.
[02:46:00.888 --> 02:46:07.262]  And explains why Obama, you know, you can have a president from Japan, he's not a citizen, he doesn't have to be a U.S.
[02:46:07.262 --> 02:46:09.607]  citizen because he's the CEO of a corporation.
[02:46:10.219 --> 02:46:14.321]  Yeah, I think instead of calling it Washington, D.C., we ought to call it Washington, I-N-C.
[02:46:14.321 --> 02:46:15.901]  Washington, Inc.
[02:46:15.901 --> 02:46:16.501]  Absolutely.
[02:46:16.501 --> 02:46:22.363]  When you're talking about season of treason, I mean, this is the time of year, actually, too, when they ram everything through.
[02:46:22.363 --> 02:46:26.325]  We get the NDAA, where they have indefinite detention of American citizens without trial.
[02:46:26.325 --> 02:46:28.206]  They pass that on a New Year's Eve.
[02:46:28.206 --> 02:46:31.027]  We say they rammed through Obamacare on a Christmas Eve.
[02:46:31.027 --> 02:46:35.808]  And then, of course, everything that they just did to us this last week, they pushed that through.
[02:46:37.789 --> 02:46:47.493]  Very last minute so they could all go home and of course funded it not just until the next year But funded it for an entire year Let's go to thank you Chris.
[02:46:47.493 --> 02:46:50.174]  Let's go to JJ in Kansas JJ.
[02:46:50.174 --> 02:46:52.894]  You want to talk about Australia?
[02:46:52.894 --> 02:46:55.095]  Can you hear me yes go ahead?
[02:46:55.095 --> 02:47:02.198]  Okay, yeah, I got a few questions the first question is in regards to the Australia deal I have in
[02:47:04.153 --> 02:47:09.256]  I've been hearing it, but I haven't gotten too much detail myself investigating about it.
[02:47:09.256 --> 02:47:16.260]  But what I have heard kind of makes me wonder if this could be sort of a false flag, you know?
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:20.502]  With the shooter dead, which that's mainly always the case.
[02:47:20.502 --> 02:47:28.506]  But with the shooter dead, and then with the witness putting out in the media... I could be wrong.
[02:47:28.506 --> 02:47:28.867]  Well, go ahead.
[02:47:28.867 --> 02:47:31.288]  Putting out in the media, hey, this is an ISIS attack.
[02:47:31.892 --> 02:47:35.874]  You know, trying to draw attention to ISIS.
[02:47:35.874 --> 02:47:55.202]  Let's get Paul's comment on this because Paul said that he thought it was curious that the media narrative was essentially moving away from trying to tie it into ISIS for the time being and trying to deny that there was any connection with Islamicism or Jihadis or ISIS or anything like that, that it's just the work of one lone criminal.
[02:47:55.202 --> 02:47:55.642]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:47:56.226 --> 02:48:11.979]  Well, what I also found interesting was, and this may be another reason why the media and the authorities are not so keen to kind of generate any story about this perpetrator that suggests political motive and that he was just mentally ill, lone nut.
[02:48:12.745 --> 02:48:30.248]  Is the fact that he was given political asylum by the Australian government in 1996 and then in 2001 he was kind of a poster child for Australia's ABC network in demonizing Iran because he claimed that his life was under threat from the Iranian government.
[02:48:30.248 --> 02:48:32.809]  That's how he got into Australia in the first place.
[02:48:32.809 --> 02:48:35.149]  So they kind of used him as a poster child back in 2001.
[02:48:35.149 --> 02:48:36.409]  Now he's very anti-Assad.
[02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:58.059]  So that obviously doesn't fit with their narrative right now so that might be another reason why they're keen to distance themselves from him having political motivation because they were closely affiliated within the Australian government and the media back in 2001 when his political opinions were useful for their narrative.
[02:48:58.756 --> 02:48:59.496]  Interesting.
[02:48:59.496 --> 02:49:08.459]  Yeah, it certainly looked like he was doing everything he could to say that his motivation was some kind of an Islamic Jihad when he had them hold the sign up in the window.
[02:49:08.459 --> 02:49:10.500]  Let's go to James in South Carolina.
[02:49:10.500 --> 02:49:12.321]  James?
[02:49:12.321 --> 02:49:13.361]  Hi, David.
[02:49:13.361 --> 02:49:18.643]  I wanted to talk about torture for a moment.
[02:49:18.643 --> 02:49:27.186]  I keep seeing the narrative and the discussion around, is torture effective in gathering information and does it prevent attacks?
[02:49:28.068 --> 02:49:32.793]  I don't think torture has anything to do with that.
[02:49:32.793 --> 02:49:38.418]  I think torture is about provoking terror in a population.
[02:49:38.418 --> 02:49:41.340]  That's why you release somebody after they're tortured.
[02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:45.524]  So they will go back and they'll say to everybody, this is what they do to me.
[02:49:45.524 --> 02:49:48.166]  And everybody's going to say, oh, we can't mess with them.
[02:49:48.166 --> 02:49:49.768]  We can't stand up to them.
[02:49:49.768 --> 02:49:50.929]  Look what they did to Joe.
[02:49:53.427 --> 02:49:54.388]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:49:54.388 --> 02:49:55.209]  I absolutely agree.
[02:49:55.209 --> 02:50:05.380]  And if you look at some of the, of course, you know, some of the torture ranged from attacking people's dignity to outright killing them and everything in between.
[02:50:05.380 --> 02:50:08.984]  But I think the key part of that is even at the bottom end of the spectrum,
[02:50:09.304 --> 02:50:09.865]  We're good to go.
[02:50:29.505 --> 02:50:44.075]  There was nothing there except excuses for the administration, excuses for the Senate, who should have been shutting this down, who should have had oversight, yet they put in her report that they had absolutely no responsibility to this whatsoever.
[02:50:44.075 --> 02:50:46.097]  It was something that the CIA did.
[02:50:46.097 --> 02:50:55.023]  And your conclusion has to come to the fact that, well, if the CIA can do this and pull the hood over everybody and not get punished, I guess the CIA is the real government.
[02:50:55.023 --> 02:50:56.424]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[02:50:56.424 --> 02:50:58.005]  We have Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.

[02:52:30.314 --> 02:52:31.315]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:52:31.315 --> 02:52:34.757]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:52:34.757 --> 02:52:36.438]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[02:52:36.438 --> 02:52:38.379]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:52:38.379 --> 02:52:44.223]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:52:44.223 --> 02:52:45.063]  I know, right?
[02:52:45.063 --> 02:52:46.384]  You love it, too!
[02:52:46.384 --> 02:52:47.805]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.

[02:52:59.412 --> 02:53:01.353]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:53:01.353 --> 02:53:04.975]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:53:04.975 --> 02:53:06.336]  A pair of scissors.
[02:53:06.336 --> 02:53:12.119]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[02:53:12.119 --> 02:53:17.042]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:53:17.042 --> 02:53:18.023]  The phone line.
[02:53:18.023 --> 02:53:23.286]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:53:23.286 --> 02:53:27.028]  But, a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:53:27.188 --> 02:53:30.512]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[02:54:14.022 --> 02:54:15.422]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:15.422 --> 02:54:16.803]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:54:16.803 --> 02:54:19.624]  And joining us from the UK is Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:19.624 --> 02:54:22.185]  And we're going to go right back to your calls in a moment.
[02:54:22.185 --> 02:54:24.285]  But this article just came out on Infowars.com.
[02:54:24.285 --> 02:54:28.967]  Despite Australia's gun control, a gunman holds hostages for 16 hours.
[02:54:28.967 --> 02:54:29.347]  You get that?
[02:54:30.339 --> 02:54:53.136]  One of the most rigid gun control regimes on the planet, and yet, this guy, who had 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault previously, 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault previously, related to six different women, this guy is able to get a gun, and he's able to hold these hostages for 16 hours, two of them dying.
[02:54:53.136 --> 02:54:54.077]  Paul, do you want to comment on that?
[02:54:55.478 --> 02:55:06.351]  Yeah, I mean, I made a series of tweets about that, and there were several incidents, I believe, back in the late 80s, early 90s, which the authorities exploited to ban all guns in Australia.
[02:55:06.351 --> 02:55:09.375]  Of course, their violent crime rate went up.
[02:55:09.375 --> 02:55:09.535]  Yes.
[02:55:10.774 --> 02:55:15.616]  You know, my thought was, if this happened in Texas, would it have gone on for 16 hours?
[02:55:15.616 --> 02:55:19.958]  Would not one of the store owners have had access to some kind of gun?
[02:55:19.958 --> 02:55:21.559]  So it's definitely an issue.
[02:55:21.559 --> 02:55:26.941]  It's one that liberals get enraged about when you even mention it, but it's definitely a factor.
[02:55:27.675 --> 02:55:34.361]  And it's interesting because this guy has had all these instances before, attacking women and this sort of thing.
[02:55:34.361 --> 02:55:40.147]  One of them, one woman was stabbed to death and set on fire.
[02:55:40.147 --> 02:55:45.391]  They say in 2002 he faced charges in a plot to murder his first wife in Sydney and she was stabbed to death, she wasn't shot.
[02:55:45.391 --> 02:55:49.675]  And yet this guy who has all these, this long rap sheet,
[02:55:50.396 --> 02:55:53.517]  He's not having any problem getting a gun in Australia.
[02:55:53.517 --> 02:56:00.158]  That should tell us something about gun control as well as the fact that he's totally in charge for 16 hours.
[02:56:00.158 --> 02:56:01.698]  Let's go back, take a couple quick calls.
[02:56:01.698 --> 02:56:04.639]  Let's try to get everybody off here before the end of the show.
[02:56:04.639 --> 02:56:07.199]  Let's go to Patton in FEMA Region 4.
[02:56:07.199 --> 02:56:09.100]  Patton, go ahead.
[02:56:09.100 --> 02:56:10.060]  Thank you, David.
[02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:15.961]  How many more acts of treason, murder, theft, fraud, rape
[02:56:17.648 --> 02:56:30.351]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:56:30.351 --> 02:56:36.613]  I mean, the bottom line is, as we pointed out, clearly the GOP leadership doesn't have a problem with what he's doing either.
[02:56:36.613 --> 02:56:41.374]  I mean, it isn't just that you're going to get rid of Obama and then have him be replaced by Joe Biden.
[02:56:41.374 --> 02:56:44.495]  Even if we replace him with the Republicans, we're going to get more of the same.
[02:56:44.495 --> 02:56:45.275]  Your comments, Paul?
[02:56:46.334 --> 02:56:49.456]  Well, the Republicans are not going to impeach him.
[02:56:49.456 --> 02:56:50.437]  I mean, that's a fact now.
[02:56:50.437 --> 02:56:51.377]  They're going to wait.
[02:56:51.377 --> 02:57:00.003]  We're probably going to see Hillary Clinton run against the Republican, if not Elizabeth Warren, which is just another brand of the same poison.
[02:57:00.003 --> 02:57:03.546]  So they're going to be quite accepting to the fact that Hillary's come in.
[02:57:03.546 --> 02:57:08.089]  And then, instead of race, they're going to use gender to divide the country once more.
[02:57:08.089 --> 02:57:10.410]  So he could be in for another four years of that.
[02:57:10.410 --> 02:57:15.554]  Yeah, they not only did not impeach him, but they basically endorsed his policies in this last budget.
[02:57:16.334 --> 02:57:20.236]  A couple of weeks after they were elected to undo specific things, they go back and endorse those.
[02:57:20.236 --> 02:57:22.217]  So they don't have a problem with his criminal activities.
[02:57:22.217 --> 02:57:24.038]  They want that power when they get in charge.
[02:57:24.038 --> 02:57:26.519]  And so the question remains, you know, what do we do about it?
[02:57:26.519 --> 02:57:27.740]  I clearly don't have an answer.
[02:57:27.740 --> 02:57:32.602]  It's a very frustrating situation, but we still need to pay attention as to what's going on, and we need to.
[02:57:32.602 --> 02:57:38.305]  I think a key part of this is more people need to be informed and involved about this.
[02:57:38.305 --> 02:57:39.405]  It's an educational issue.
[02:57:39.405 --> 02:57:42.707]  I think we need a broader base before we're going to see any kind of solution come up.
[02:57:43.387 --> 02:57:46.108]  Especially a peaceful solution, which is what we want to see.
[02:57:46.108 --> 02:57:47.509]  Let's go to Robert in Tennessee.
[02:57:47.509 --> 02:57:49.630]  Robert?
[02:57:49.630 --> 02:57:50.030]  Hello.
[02:57:50.030 --> 02:57:52.031]  How are you?
[02:57:52.031 --> 02:57:52.771]  Doing good, go ahead.
[02:57:52.771 --> 02:58:02.895]  Hey Paul, I live in Millersville, Tennessee, where that happened with the three Arabian guys with the baby.
[02:58:02.895 --> 02:58:04.936]  Oh yeah, where they had the baby in the trunk, they said?
[02:58:04.936 --> 02:58:06.096]  The dead baby in the trunk?
[02:58:06.096 --> 02:58:06.997]  Yes.
[02:58:06.997 --> 02:58:07.777]  Yes, sir.
[02:58:07.777 --> 02:58:09.057]  And I've got some news for you.
[02:58:11.385 --> 02:58:16.111]  That little town here that we live in, the citizens here are up in arms over this.
[02:58:16.111 --> 02:58:24.521]  You haven't heard anything else about it in the media or anything like that because they have completely squashed this.
[02:58:24.521 --> 02:58:29.587]  This little town will search your car at the drop of a hat, literally.
[02:58:30.461 --> 02:58:35.708]  But they'll let these guys go when they say they've got a dead baby in their trunk simply because they're Saudis.
[02:58:35.708 --> 02:58:37.070]  I'm sorry, that's all the time we've got.
[02:58:37.070 --> 02:58:40.174]  Thank you for joining us from the UK, Paul Joseph Watson.
