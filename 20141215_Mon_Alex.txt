[00:00.000 --> 00:13.380]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.380 --> 00:22.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.160 --> 00:34.400]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Monday December 15th 2014 I'm David Knight I'll be
[00:34.400 --> 00:40.200]  your host today and of course for several hours we've had quite a long siege in Sydney
[00:40.200 --> 00:46.440]  that is now ended Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us in later in the show and he's
[00:46.440 --> 00:51.280]  going to talk about what's going on with that give us an update because we've heard now that
[00:51.280 --> 00:57.200]  the gunman has been killed that hostages have been released but we don't know yet if any
[00:57.200 --> 01:01.840]  hostages were killed in that but what's behind that how is that going to be used we have a
[01:01.840 --> 01:08.240]  article up on info wars dot com from Kit Daniels former CIA chief says that ISIS is going to
[01:08.240 --> 01:14.520]  attack the US soon there you go so we don't know who this guy is we've got an article up on
[01:14.520 --> 01:19.600]  info wars dot com man responsible for taking Australian hostages is an Iranian mystic he is
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.680]  not ISIS not Al Qaeda doesn't matter we can still go with that can't we I mean it doesn't matter
[01:25.680 --> 01:31.240]  that we were told that the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia we go attack Afghanistan or whatever
[01:31.240 --> 01:36.880]  we just need an excuse to go kick some butt and it looks like maybe we'll get that from this who
[01:36.880 --> 01:42.600]  knows now we're also going to take a look at the budget betrayal from John Boehner what's behind
[01:42.600 --> 01:48.960]  that and what does that show us about the future there's a connection I believe to this collapse
[01:48.960 --> 01:55.680]  of the oil's future market that's being done by our ally Saudi Arabia of course they're the ally of
[01:55.680 --> 02:03.160]  the CIA striking out at our domestic oil production that's been a common basis for most of American
[02:03.160 --> 02:10.720]  form policy that we have to have the free flow of oil at market prices that we need to go to war
[02:10.720 --> 02:16.120]  to keep that coming to us from Saudi Arabia the idea that we have peak oil that we're not going to
[02:16.120 --> 02:22.280]  get any more oil I remember back in the 70s we were told that we were going to be completely out
[02:22.280 --> 02:27.280]  of oil by the 1980s I've got the time magazine covers I can't find them since I moved I would
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.440]  show them to you on air but they had long exposes about how we had reached peak oil we weren't
[02:32.440 --> 02:37.960]  going to have any more oil there was only so much oil in the ground we had songs about it I mean it
[02:37.960 --> 02:43.920]  was it was a certainty we weren't going to get any more oil now that we have all of these new
[02:43.920 --> 02:50.800]  sources coming online oil shelf racking all these different places where they've discovered even more
[02:50.800 --> 02:56.240]  oil that has to be shut down before they can get up and producing and that's what's behind this
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.760]  with Saudi Arabia it's directly an attack on our energy independence and that is an attack on
[03:01.760 --> 03:09.960]  our entire economy it's also an attack at Russia because Russia's economy is natural resource based
[03:09.960 --> 03:15.520]  they're trying to harm Russia in this at the same time there's a lot behind this and we're
[03:15.520 --> 03:21.360]  going to be talking to Paul Craig Roberts economist and political analysis about what's
[03:21.360 --> 03:26.840]  going on globally as far as the Cold War the escalation behind that what's behind all of this
[03:26.840 --> 03:30.960]  move in the price of oil this attack by Saudi Arabia now they're being joined by the rest of
[03:30.960 --> 03:37.160]  OPEC is following along with them they were being pretty much going it alone they're at first but
[03:37.160 --> 03:42.480]  now we have these other countries the United Arab Emirates are signing on to this as well and we
[03:42.480 --> 03:49.280]  see that there is something else that ties the baner betrayal to this price of oil this drop
[03:49.280 --> 03:54.960]  why did they have to pass this bill so soon why did the Democrats for example why would they sign
[03:54.960 --> 04:02.880]  on to a situation that essentially betrays their base guaranteeing derivatives for these giant banks
[04:02.880 --> 04:08.320]  undoing what they said they had done with the Dodd-Frank bill I think there was a real emergency
[04:08.320 --> 04:12.400]  with us I think they had to get into this very quickly because they were concerned this whole
[04:12.400 --> 04:18.200]  thing may be snowballing into another situation that looks very much like 2008 and they wanted
[04:18.200 --> 04:23.440]  to get their clients to send them the money the large banks they wanted to protect them that's
[04:23.440 --> 04:29.800]  why Harry Reid and Obama had to fall on the sword and betray themselves to their to their voters the
[04:29.800 --> 04:34.800]  Republicans essentially went along with it they wanted to make this happen as well but they could
[04:34.800 --> 04:39.440]  have waited a few months and let the Republicans take all the heat no they jumped in on it and took
[04:39.440 --> 04:44.080]  the heat with them we're gonna talk about why they had to do this so quickly stay with us we'll be
[04:44.080 --> 05:05.360]  right back as the year is coming to a close we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the
[05:05.360 --> 05:11.640]  past year we take a step back and thank God for what we have I'm David Hall founder of Diamond

[08:29.480 --> 08:35.040]  December 15th 2014 I'll be your host today Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us at the
[08:35.040 --> 08:40.320]  third hour to talk about this situation in Sydney of course there's a lot to talk about with that
[08:40.320 --> 08:46.120]  what's behind this how is it going to be used we have a couple of stories up on info wars.com the
[08:46.120 --> 08:52.920]  man responsible for taking Australian hostages is an Iranian mystic not Isis not al Qaeda yet we
[08:52.920 --> 08:58.560]  also have a story up from Kit Daniels former CIA chief says Isis will attack the US soon see they
[08:58.560 --> 09:03.600]  can conflate these two things together and hey we just go off to war so we're going to be talking
[09:03.600 --> 09:08.400]  to him about that we're also going to be talking in the second hour to Paul Craig Roberts we're
[09:08.400 --> 09:14.680]  going to be talking about war as well as the economy and there's a lot happening in the wake
[09:14.680 --> 09:20.880]  of the budget betrayal from Boehner and the Republicans as Matt Drudge tweeted out Obama got
[09:20.880 --> 09:28.480]  everything he said the NSA dirt on Boehner must be incredible as the Chicago win well whatever's
[09:28.480 --> 09:35.280]  behind it we've seen that Boehner's spending just over the last 3.8 years has been 3.8 trillion
[09:35.280 --> 09:41.080]  dollars so no constraints there whatsoever and of course I believe there's something else going on
[09:41.080 --> 09:48.120]  here I think they're looking to protect their corporate masters we had Jamie Diamond of JP
[09:48.120 --> 09:54.400]  Morgan calling Congress giving five million dollars a year from JP Morgan city bank also they
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.120]  wanted to get their derivatives insured and we're going to talk about what's behind that and it's
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.960]  also tied into the falling price of oil the falling price of oil has many different aspects to it
[10:04.960 --> 10:11.280]  there's a massive economic aspect to it is at the beginning of another major catastrophic economic
[10:11.280 --> 10:17.600]  implosion with speculation as we saw with the mortgage market in 2008 yet even bigger is that
[10:17.600 --> 10:24.120]  what Boehner and the Democrats signed us on to cover of course the entire derivatives market that
[10:24.120 --> 10:30.520]  they want to cover now is 1.2 quadrillion and they got that for just a few million dollars how
[10:30.520 --> 10:36.640]  would you like to be able to get insurance for one dollar pay one dollar as a one-time fee and
[10:36.640 --> 10:41.440]  you get a trillion dollars worth of life insurance that sound like a good deal that's
[10:41.440 --> 10:46.120]  essentially what the banks got and of course you could say well no bank whatever no insurance
[10:46.120 --> 10:49.880]  company would ever give you a trillion dollars worth of life insurance for a dollar because
[10:49.880 --> 10:53.000]  I know eventually they're going to have to pay up because you're going to die well you know what
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.400]  eventually this balloon is going to burst and the American taxpayer is going to be on the hook
[10:59.400 --> 11:05.800]  for orders of magnitude more than we ever were with the tarp bailout of the mortgages they have
[11:05.800 --> 11:12.240]  leveraged and given away your wealth in order to protect these banks who want to do speculative
[11:12.240 --> 11:18.120]  investing with their derivatives and this is all coming at a time that we see a massive
[11:18.120 --> 11:26.400]  implosion in commodity futures because of the attack on the oil industry by Saudi Arabia the
[11:26.400 --> 11:33.000]  attack on our oil industry trying to shut down our domestic production they can aim that dagger
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.320]  at our heart and they can get us to insure it at the same time so the big boys have got themselves
[11:39.320 --> 11:43.680]  covered it's all connected we're going to be talking to Paul Craig Roberts about that but
[11:43.680 --> 11:50.080]  before we do there was a story that broke at the end of the day on Friday we covered it
[11:50.080 --> 11:55.360]  on the nightly news and there were some more developments over the weekend we have a clip
[11:55.360 --> 12:02.360]  of a police officer who is bragging about his new toy his new MRAP toy to someone who is video
[12:02.360 --> 12:07.480]  taping him with their phone and talking about all of its capability and the person says why do
[12:07.480 --> 12:29.160]  you need that and he says I need it for the constitutionalist here's that clip so I'm thinking
[12:29.160 --> 12:52.640]  that is totally appropriate in Iraq but we're what kind of a situation in the US we've heard
[12:52.640 --> 12:58.080]  that before haven't we remember back in August of 2013 when they were talking about how the
[12:58.080 --> 13:03.560]  police chief there wanted these MRAPs he said well we've got these dangerous libertarians
[13:03.560 --> 13:09.920]  around here and constitutionalists Mikhail Thelen contacted this particular incident
[13:09.920 --> 13:15.160]  happened across the country in Washington wow how about that you got different police
[13:15.160 --> 13:21.240]  departments making really crazy claims all the way across the country where might that
[13:21.240 --> 13:24.760]  be coming from well we know where that's coming from it's coming from Homeland Security it's
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.200]  coming from the FBI they're having these training sessions where they train the local police that
[13:30.200 --> 13:33.560]  they have to watch out for anybody that talks about the Constitution because they're dangerous
[13:33.560 --> 13:38.120]  they have to watch out about anybody that talks about rights because they're labeled a sovereign
[13:38.120 --> 13:43.440]  citizen and they're told that those type of people that they label that way are direct threat on
[13:43.440 --> 13:50.440]  their life we saw this right after the Bundy Ranch we saw Glenn Beck wasting no time having it
[13:50.440 --> 13:56.440]  was that happened that showdown happened on a Saturday on that Monday he had Bundy on his show
[13:56.440 --> 14:02.320]  and one of the people on his show tried to hang the label of sovereign citizen on him Bundy had
[14:02.320 --> 14:07.360]  no idea what he was talking about we know what he was talking about we know they were trying to
[14:07.360 --> 14:12.760]  essentially put a bounty on their head of course police are trained that it's a war zone out there
[14:12.760 --> 14:17.840]  that they have to shoot and shoot first if they want to come home to their families and of course
[14:17.840 --> 14:23.120]  the people that they are supposed to be the most afraid of are the ones that they label as sovereign
[14:23.120 --> 14:28.640]  citizens or constitutionalists we've seen this over and over again now Mikhail reached out to the
[14:28.640 --> 14:33.640]  Spokane County Sheriff's Office tried to get a comment he wasn't able to get anybody there but
[14:33.640 --> 14:39.320]  he was able to talk to the Spokane Valley Republican Representative Matthew Shea and when he saw this
[14:39.320 --> 14:45.040]  footage he was rightfully appalled and here's what a Republican Representative Matthew Shea said he
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.840]  said will law abiding citizens who love the Constitution and the rule of law be hunted down
[14:49.840 --> 14:56.040]  with in reps constitutionalism is fundamental to being an American to hate the Constitution and
[14:56.040 --> 15:02.120]  those who support it means you are a traitor to this country he said this is spitting in the face
[15:02.120 --> 15:07.440]  of all the heroes who fought blood and died so that we might live free and the question is why
[15:07.440 --> 15:14.640]  aren't you a constitutionalist officer why don't you believe in the rule of law why don't you believe
[15:14.640 --> 15:19.080]  the Constitution means what it says and of course we've seen this over and over again as Mikhail
[15:19.080 --> 15:24.840]  goes down he points out the many many times we've seen this in Indiana we saw returning military
[15:24.840 --> 15:30.640]  veterans labeled as domestic threats by Homeland Security in 2009 we saw the Mayak report as well
[15:30.640 --> 15:36.800]  the Fusion Center report that was leaked to Info Wars back in 2009 labeling people who supported
[15:36.800 --> 15:42.760]  Ron Paul as being someone who was an extremist group somebody they should be a wary of if you
[15:42.760 --> 15:48.800]  had a bumper sticker on your car for Ron Paul or for Baldwin that was somebody that the police
[15:48.800 --> 15:53.160]  should basically take the safety off of their gun when they pull you over because they've been
[15:53.160 --> 15:57.840]  told that you might get out of the car shooting and of course we also saw this back in New Hampshire
[15:57.840 --> 16:05.160]  we had a army veteran who I don't know if it was army or the Marines but anyway he was a high-ranking
[16:05.160 --> 16:09.040]  colonel or lieutenant colonel he came in here and talked to us actually afterwards but he
[16:09.040 --> 16:14.400]  questioned this he said why do they need to be this heavily armed we weren't that heavily armed
[16:14.400 --> 16:22.400]  when we were fighting a war abroad that's where this is coming from now we also have an article
[16:22.400 --> 16:30.480]  from the AP that's up on Drudge Report Texas Ways Allowing Open Carry of Handguns they're
[16:30.480 --> 16:34.680]  pointing out the Texas you may not believe it but Texas is one of the few states with an outright
[16:34.680 --> 16:41.520]  ban on open carry of handguns and they point to the fact that the governor-elect Greg Abbott said
[16:41.520 --> 16:46.360]  on the first day after his election last month he said if open carry is good enough for Massachusetts
[16:46.360 --> 16:51.600]  it's good enough for the state of Texas and of course they're talking about the they have one
[16:51.600 --> 16:56.240]  quote from a lady who's 63-year-old rancher in Blanco that's out in the Hill Country here she
[16:56.240 --> 16:59.760]  carries a handgun in her purse she says for protection protection but she'd like to carry
[16:59.760 --> 17:05.240]  it on her side as she does when she's on her ranch she points out in one and a half seconds
[17:05.240 --> 17:11.560]  a man can run 25 feet with a knife in his hand and stab you before you can get your gun out if
[17:11.560 --> 17:15.960]  it's concealed but I think the most interesting quote out of this article was the one from the
[17:15.960 --> 17:21.760]  representative Jonathan Strickland Republican from Bedford Texas although most of the open carry
[17:21.760 --> 17:26.600]  bills that have been filed for the upcoming season would still require a license he would
[17:26.600 --> 17:31.640]  eliminate the licensing requirement and here's the quote from that representative he said the
[17:31.640 --> 17:37.480]  idea is that we're going to return to our second amendment rights there's a difference between a
[17:37.480 --> 17:43.640]  right and a privilege he said I can't imagine what citizens would do if they had to take a class or
[17:43.640 --> 17:51.520]  pay a fee to use their first amendment rights think about that do you understand first amendment
[17:51.520 --> 17:57.680]  rights are there you don't have to pay a fee you don't have to take a class if we have second
[17:57.680 --> 18:02.400]  amendment rights if we have the right to protect ourselves from criminals acting individually or
[18:02.400 --> 18:10.040]  from criminals acting collectively together called a government then that is not a privilege if you
[18:10.040 --> 18:15.520]  it is it comes a privilege if you have to take a class or if we have to pay a fee now of course
[18:15.520 --> 18:21.120]  we've already seen our tyrannical government kind of ruminate over the idea that maybe the
[18:21.120 --> 18:26.160]  first amendment should be a privilege and not a fundamental right talking about licensing
[18:26.160 --> 18:32.920]  journalists we even talked about it last week how in Japan Prime Minister Abe has just put in a
[18:32.920 --> 18:41.360]  a prison sentence of 10 years if somebody in government leases leaks information as a whistle
[18:41.360 --> 18:45.480]  blower and the journalist who reports it gets a five-year sentence now here's the interesting

[19:06.520 --> 19:13.000]  we've also had our own government talking about how perhaps they need to license journalists and
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.280]  of course you're not a real journalist unless you work for a mainstream media organization or
[19:18.280 --> 19:23.320]  have a license or have some kind of a degree that simply isn't true we've talked about that many

[21:33.120 --> 21:37.520]  Built by Harvard engineers, Simply Safe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.

[21:59.160 --> 22:01.160]  What disaster is so powerful?
[22:01.160 --> 22:06.560]  It unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots.
[22:06.560 --> 22:10.400]  All at the same time, NASA has already set the countdown timer.
[22:10.400 --> 22:15.240]  And right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[22:15.240 --> 22:20.200]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of US population could perish.
[22:20.200 --> 22:23.680]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[22:23.680 --> 22:26.080]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[22:26.080 --> 22:27.800]  Mass riots will follow.
[22:27.800 --> 22:29.800]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[22:29.800 --> 22:33.840]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[22:33.840 --> 22:39.120]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved
[22:39.120 --> 22:44.360]  ones, and even your entire community when this worst-case scenario unravels.

[22:51.160 --> 22:56.040]  Go there before this life-saving information becomes unavailable to the large public.
[22:56.040 --> 22:59.000]  Go to darkestdays.info now.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.200]  If you have candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of
[23:03.200 --> 23:05.320]  sweets does not address the cause.
[23:05.320 --> 23:09.880]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed
[23:09.880 --> 23:10.880]  tissue environment.
[23:10.880 --> 23:15.720]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate
[23:15.720 --> 23:18.080]  inflammation, and feed beneficial bacteria.
[23:18.080 --> 23:22.520]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids for exposure to mercury or other toxins can
[23:22.520 --> 23:27.320]  damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to candida overgrowth.
[23:27.320 --> 23:30.320]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.
[23:30.320 --> 23:35.040]  One World Way is a whey protein food that supports detoxification, repair of tissues,
[23:35.040 --> 23:39.920]  and elimination of inflammation, healthy pH, and growth of beneficial bacteria.
[23:39.920 --> 23:43.960]  One World Way is duly reformulated to be higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate.
[23:43.960 --> 23:48.280]  We believe One World Way is an excellent food to support your efforts to create a healthy
[23:48.280 --> 23:49.920]  internal body environment.

[23:54.800 --> 24:19.200]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, on this Monday, December 15,
[24:19.200 --> 24:20.200]  2015.
[24:20.200 --> 24:21.200]  14.
[24:21.200 --> 24:23.040]  We're getting really close to 2015, aren't we?
[24:23.040 --> 24:25.080]  We've got a couple of weeks left.
[24:25.080 --> 24:29.000]  I was talking about the abortion doctor just before we went to break, and I want to get
[24:29.000 --> 24:36.560]  back to that story, but before I do real quickly, we have X2, Survival Shield X2, at InfowarsLife.com.
[24:36.560 --> 24:39.640]  This is our first sale ever on X2.
[24:39.640 --> 24:45.920]  It's 17% off free shipping, it was $29.99, now it's $24.99, but without the free shipping,
[24:45.920 --> 24:47.880]  you would have paid $38.
[24:47.880 --> 24:52.200]  This is a sale that's going to run only through next Monday, and of course if you get it within
[24:52.200 --> 24:55.920]  the next two days, Christmas delivery is guaranteed.
[24:55.920 --> 25:01.200]  Now of course the CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency
[25:01.200 --> 25:06.320]  diseases in the world, fortunately it is the easiest to correct, and of course with Survival
[25:06.320 --> 25:11.560]  Shield X2, it's approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation,
[25:11.560 --> 25:17.960]  created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[25:17.960 --> 25:23.120]  That Survival Shield X2 on sale right now, as I pointed out, with the free shipping and
[25:23.120 --> 25:27.720]  the discount, you would have paid $38 to get it now, it's on sale for $24.99 through
[25:27.720 --> 25:29.720]  next Monday.
[25:29.720 --> 25:33.480]  Just before the break, we were talking about this story from the New American, it's an
[25:33.480 --> 25:40.040]  Oklahoma abortion doctor who was arrested for not killing babies.
[25:40.040 --> 25:45.200]  Interestingly enough, what his scam was was to examine women to tell them that they were
[25:45.200 --> 25:52.880]  pregnant, then to give them RU-486 at $600, let's see what was the amount here, it was
[25:52.880 --> 25:56.840]  over $600 that they were charged in each one of these cases.
[25:56.840 --> 26:04.160]  Now keep in mind they point out that RU-486, even when it's used as approved by the FDA
[26:04.160 --> 26:07.840]  to induce abortion, is known to cause hemorrhaging.
[26:07.840 --> 26:12.440]  In some cases so much so that they need to have medical intervention, yet he's willing
[26:12.440 --> 26:17.320]  to do this to women to turn a quick buck, and of course he's got a lot of them.
[26:17.320 --> 26:21.880]  They point out in the article that he's got a $3.8 million home in Oklahoma City, and
[26:21.880 --> 26:27.760]  this is somebody, it's not his first rodeo, he's been in trouble with the law many times.
[26:27.760 --> 26:33.920]  He was disciplined for botching an abortion in 1989, he admitted in 1992 to dumping and
[26:33.920 --> 26:39.960]  burning 55 aborted babies near Shawnee, Oklahoma, no charges were filed then, but he was arrested
[26:39.960 --> 26:44.800]  in 1993 after a former patient accused him of molestation.
[26:44.800 --> 26:50.360]  He was charged with one count each of forcible sexual battery, and two other women came forward
[26:50.360 --> 26:55.240]  and testified against him, but of course this guy is still walking free, isn't he?
[26:55.240 --> 27:01.400]  You know, it's interesting to see who gets immunity and who gets it for what.
[27:01.400 --> 27:06.640]  Now we pointed out that one of Obama's executive orders a few weeks ago was to give amnesty
[27:06.640 --> 27:13.880]  to any corporations that went to Ebola countries and happen to bring it back into America and
[27:13.880 --> 27:14.880]  infect other people.
[27:14.880 --> 27:19.200]  He gave them legal immunity from being sued.
[27:19.200 --> 27:23.280]  Now he's doing the same thing for big pharmaceutical companies.
[27:23.280 --> 27:28.840]  He's given them legal immunity from future lawsuits over the new Ebola vaccine.
[27:28.840 --> 27:31.440]  Of course they're rushing this to market.
[27:31.440 --> 27:35.920]  They don't want to wait for tests that they would normally do to check for the safety
[27:35.920 --> 27:41.160]  of something, not even doing any tests for the efficacy of it, but of course they're
[27:41.160 --> 27:47.160]  going to, they're getting all the groundwork laid to roll this out in a massive way, perhaps
[27:47.160 --> 27:52.400]  requiring people to get it once they introduce and bring back a lot of Ebola.
[27:52.400 --> 27:58.040]  If they were to do that, they could require medical workers for starters to get this vaccine.
[27:58.040 --> 28:03.800]  Then of course if it has any side effects, these big pharmaceutical companies are not
[28:03.800 --> 28:05.800]  going to be held responsible.
[28:05.800 --> 28:10.400]  Ebola has given them immunity, but of course if it makes things worse, if it spreads the
[28:10.400 --> 28:16.520]  disease, if it is totally ineffective, you won't have any legal recourse against these
[28:16.520 --> 28:20.520]  companies that are in bed with the administration.
[28:20.520 --> 28:25.920]  And talking about immunity, Dick Cheney says, I'd do it again in a minute, and of course
[28:25.920 --> 28:28.440]  he's talking about torture.
[28:28.440 --> 28:35.680]  And that's exactly why he and others need to go to jail because they will do it again.
[28:35.680 --> 28:40.320]  And they'll do it worse again, and they'll be more open about it again.
[28:40.320 --> 28:42.560]  We've seen the same thing going on with the NSA.
[28:42.560 --> 28:47.160]  We had the leaks from Snowden that verified what we'd been talking about for over a decade,
[28:47.160 --> 28:51.320]  for a couple of decades, how they were spying on us, how they were collecting our records.
[28:51.320 --> 28:54.520]  We've had whistleblowers 10 years ago.
[28:54.520 --> 29:00.560]  We had William Benny and others who resigned, and the government came after those whistleblowers,
[29:00.560 --> 29:03.320]  and they were telling us at the time what was happening.
[29:03.320 --> 29:05.800]  They paid any attention until the Snowden leaks.
[29:05.800 --> 29:10.680]  Once they paid attention to the Snowden leaks, now we've got our Congress passing a law that
[29:10.680 --> 29:13.120]  essentially says, that's fine.
[29:13.120 --> 29:17.440]  We're going to go ahead and do it, essentially giving the NSA immunity to spy on us.
[29:17.440 --> 29:22.120]  So they give Cheney and the CIA essentially immunity to torture people because they don't
[29:22.120 --> 29:23.120]  get punished.
[29:23.120 --> 29:24.320]  That's the message.
[29:24.320 --> 29:28.000]  We have the police who have immunity from police brutality.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.800]  We have the NSA that has immunity against surveillance.
[29:30.800 --> 29:32.760]  Do you see a problem here?
[29:32.760 --> 29:34.080]  Do you see a pattern?
[29:34.080 --> 29:40.040]  We have laid the foundation and presumed to make it legal for absolute tyranny in America.
[29:40.040 --> 29:41.040]  Stay with us.
[29:41.040 --> 29:43.960]  We're going to be right back talking about economics and oil, and we're going to have
[29:43.960 --> 29:46.320]  Paul Craig Roberts joining us at the next hour.
[29:46.320 --> 29:49.320]  Stay with us.
[29:49.320 --> 29:50.600]  We're on the march.
[29:50.600 --> 29:52.960]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:52.960 --> 29:57.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:57.560 --> 30:05.960]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform
[30:05.960 --> 30:07.840]  your body the way you want it.
[30:07.840 --> 30:11.800]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[30:11.800 --> 30:13.320]  Make this year different.
[30:13.320 --> 30:18.320]  By equipping yourself with oxypowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[30:18.320 --> 30:23.480]  Using super oxygenation, oxypowder, available through InfowarsLife.com, gently cleanses
[30:23.480 --> 30:26.400]  the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[30:26.400 --> 30:31.000]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used oxypowder to cleanse their bodies and aid
[30:31.000 --> 30:32.640]  in their transformations.
[30:32.640 --> 30:37.360]  Even Infowars Nightly News Director Rob Doe has been using oxypowder with incredible
[30:37.360 --> 30:38.360]  success.
[30:38.360 --> 30:40.680]  Took it that first day, and I took it for six more days after that.
[30:40.680 --> 30:41.920]  12 pounds melted off.
[30:41.920 --> 30:43.440]  In about a week, I'd say a week.
[30:43.440 --> 30:44.440]  Seven days.
[30:44.440 --> 30:46.240]  2015 can be different.
[30:46.240 --> 30:49.400]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[30:49.400 --> 30:51.400]  Oxypowder flushes it out.
[30:51.400 --> 30:54.440]  Secure your oxypowder at InfowarsLife.com.
[30:54.440 --> 31:00.560]  Or 888-253-3139.

[31:24.320 --> 31:25.320]  essential nutrients.
[31:25.320 --> 31:28.600]  Secret 12 is taken by mouse, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[31:28.600 --> 31:30.280]  No needles, no injections.
[31:30.280 --> 31:34.240]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.

[32:54.840 --> 33:21.080]  core products.
[33:24.840 --> 33:31.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight on this December 15th, 2014.
[33:31.840 --> 33:38.160]  Now as we were just talking about immunity that's been granted to the CIA torturers,
[33:38.160 --> 33:42.800]  we talk about the immunity that's being granted to the big pharmaceutical companies for the
[33:42.800 --> 33:47.840]  vaccines that they're developing for Ebola and not testing for either safety or efficacy.
[33:47.840 --> 33:52.240]  We don't know if they work, we don't know what effects they're going to have on people,
[33:52.240 --> 33:56.240]  we just got to get this thing out there and presumably force people to do it and if they've
[33:56.240 --> 33:59.720]  got any side effects, that's all right, we've got that taken care of and then we talked
[33:59.720 --> 34:04.600]  about before that an abortion doctor who has been in trouble with the law many, many times
[34:04.600 --> 34:09.120]  and now he's been arrested in Oklahoma as part of a sting telling women who are not
[34:09.120 --> 34:15.840]  pregnant that they were pregnant and then selling them RU-486 which is a very, very
[34:15.840 --> 34:17.960]  serious pharmaceutical.
[34:17.960 --> 34:23.000]  Can induce hemorrhaging, can induce all kinds of side effects and of course it also has
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.320]  another side effect and that is it generates a lot of wealth for the people who are selling
[34:27.320 --> 34:33.600]  it, especially this abortionist and of course we were talking about the immunity from police
[34:33.600 --> 34:36.800]  that the police have from brutality that they're inflicting on people.
[34:36.800 --> 34:40.280]  We've got yet another example of this today over the weekend.
[34:40.280 --> 34:46.520]  We have a story of a 76 year old man in Texas, he was the Texas police officer, was placed
[34:46.520 --> 34:51.080]  on administrative leave, I guess that's a code word for vacation with pay on Friday
[34:51.080 --> 34:58.000]  after he reportedly used a taser on a 76 year old man after the suspect had already been
[34:58.000 --> 35:03.760]  forced to the ground and if you look at this picture of the Victoria police officer from
[35:03.760 --> 35:09.440]  the dash cam footage, this is still, this is not a black man, this is a white man, this
[35:09.440 --> 35:15.880]  is the problem, it is not a black, white issue and of course we had tens of thousands of
[35:15.880 --> 35:21.560]  people across the country demonstrating against police brutality in Washington, New York,
[35:21.560 --> 35:27.760]  Boston, California, they were protesting as Reuters says, the killing of unarmed black
[35:27.760 --> 35:34.040]  men by police officers, well I hope they understood that the problem is much bigger than that
[35:34.040 --> 35:40.520]  and of course we've had the relatives of Eric Garner publicly speak out, his wife, I think
[35:40.520 --> 35:43.800]  it was a cousin that contacted Paul Joseph Watson, Paul Joseph Watson is going to be
[35:43.800 --> 35:49.520]  with us by the way in the third hour but they made the point that this is not simply about
[35:49.520 --> 35:55.960]  black on white, this is a much larger issue, it is not going to be solved by adjusting
[35:55.960 --> 36:02.000]  the ratios of white to black police officers, this is about the way they're being trained
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.800]  and of course there's another aspect of this that is even more dangerous, every time they
[36:07.800 --> 36:15.400]  try to defend the MRAP system, this 1033 system that the Pentagon has set up for surplus equipment,
[36:15.400 --> 36:19.680]  every time they start defending that of course, they do it on the basis of saying they need
[36:19.680 --> 36:25.600]  this for the libertarians, for the constitutionalists, we just had played earlier in the show, the
[36:25.600 --> 36:30.920]  clip from the police officer who was being questioned by somebody who was recording it,
[36:30.920 --> 36:35.000]  said you know, tell us about this and he's going on about all these capabilities of
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.520]  this MRAP and they said well why do you need that in America and he goes well we've got
[36:39.520 --> 36:42.880]  these constitutionalists and they've got a lot of ammunition and arms and they're here
[36:42.880 --> 36:48.560]  locally, that's what they're being told, that's what's coming out of Washington DC,
[36:48.560 --> 36:54.000]  the FBI, Homeland Security, they're the ones who are driving that notion home with your
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.680]  local police, that's all part of the militarization of the police, as we pointed out many times
[36:58.680 --> 37:05.320]  it was earlier this month that they stopped a program that gave fire departments surplus
[37:05.320 --> 37:09.720]  military equipment, that had been going on for 60 years, they shut it down and they said
[37:09.720 --> 37:14.160]  well you know we're not going to give that to you anymore because we're going to now
[37:14.160 --> 37:19.520]  start enforcing an EPA regulation that they hadn't enforced for 25 years about clean air,
[37:19.520 --> 37:25.360]  presumably it was better to let the large forests burn than to give these small rural
[37:25.360 --> 37:29.360]  fire departments a helping hand with equipment so they could put those fires out because
[37:29.360 --> 37:32.720]  they're typically the ones on the front lines, they're usually the ones who get that done
[37:32.720 --> 37:36.720]  and for a couple of weeks it looked like that was going to happen until they organized and
[37:36.720 --> 37:44.120]  got that pushed back and so now they've sustained that program for the fire department apparently.
[37:44.120 --> 37:48.160]  But at the same time this program where they give the police the MRAPs, they're telling
[37:48.160 --> 37:54.640]  everybody that's for emergencies, you understand the difference there, why does the police department
[37:54.640 --> 37:59.320]  need that and yet the fire department doesn't need these vehicles to get them back into
[37:59.320 --> 38:05.000]  the wilderness areas to put out wildfires, absolutely incredible that they would do this,
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.040]  not believable in that sense, not believable for a moment.
[38:09.040 --> 38:14.000]  Now going back to this story about this Texas police officer, when he pulled over this 76
[38:14.000 --> 38:21.280]  year old man Pete Vasquez he was driving back a vehicle to this car lot, it was a dealer
[38:21.280 --> 38:27.080]  vehicle, it had dealer tags, he tried to explain that it was exempt from needing an inspection,
[38:27.080 --> 38:33.520]  evidently the officer didn't like that, he slammed him in the hood of the patrol car,
[38:33.520 --> 38:38.640]  says the two men disappeared from camera range as the officer Robinson places Vasquez in
[38:38.640 --> 38:45.920]  a hole and then forces him to the ground and then tasered him and the 76 year old man said
[38:45.920 --> 38:51.480]  he acted like a pit bull, for a while I thought he was going to pull his gun and shoot me.
[38:51.480 --> 38:57.320]  Now the response that has come out is the police chief has offered a personal apology,
[38:57.320 --> 39:04.480]  is that enough, is that really enough, I don't think so, now what Larry Ulrich who works
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.280]  as a sales manager the car lot told the paper he said he should be fired from the force
[39:09.280 --> 39:14.880]  and prosecuted, see that's just it, if we're going to allow the CIA to torture people and
[39:14.880 --> 39:18.880]  not ever prosecute them, if we're going to allow the police to brutalize people and not
[39:18.880 --> 39:23.600]  ever prosecute them you're going to get more of it and that's exactly what Dick Cheney
[39:23.600 --> 39:28.600]  said, he said I'd do it again in a minute, you bet and so with the police because they
[39:28.600 --> 39:34.240]  know they're going to get away with the brutality and until you stop this it's going to by
[39:34.240 --> 39:39.200]  prosecuting somebody they're getting the message not only are they being trained to recognize
[39:39.200 --> 39:44.860]  everyone who opposes the government politically or has something to say about it as a constitutional
[39:44.860 --> 39:48.000]  unless not only are they being trained to see them as the enemy, not only are they being
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.960]  trained to see everybody out there that's not wearing a uniform and a badge as a potential
[39:52.960 --> 39:57.680]  assassin, they're being told that they can get away with it.
[39:57.680 --> 40:03.200]  Now in the next hour we're going to be joined by Paul Craig Roberts, economist and analyst
[40:03.200 --> 40:08.880]  of political situations, we're going to talk to him about the increasing risk of war and
[40:08.880 --> 40:15.040]  what's going on with the economy and there have been major, major tectonic moves in this
[40:15.040 --> 40:19.640]  last week with this budget that was pushed through by the Republicans.
[40:19.640 --> 40:25.240]  As Matt Drudge pointed out Obama got everything he wanted and he said maybe there's a lot
[40:25.240 --> 40:32.120]  of NSA dirt on Boehner or maybe Boehner is just working for the bankers, maybe he's working
[40:32.120 --> 40:37.800]  for the US Chamber of Commerce who wants open borders, maybe he's working for the banks
[40:37.800 --> 40:45.000]  who want to have you the taxpayer cover their derivatives again using FDIC insurance.
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.600]  Only these are much bigger derivatives than we have seen in the past with the mortgage.
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.440]  Now they're coming for the whole enchilada and if we look at this budget, this continuing
[40:55.440 --> 41:00.640]  resolution they just put through $1.1 trillion.
[41:00.640 --> 41:05.760]  Economic Policy Journal points out that the longest US war, that would be the war in Afghanistan,
[41:05.760 --> 41:09.440]  has already cost us $1 trillion.
[41:09.440 --> 41:10.440]  Think about that.
[41:10.440 --> 41:14.880]  That's how much the war in Afghanistan has cost taxpayers.
[41:14.880 --> 41:20.080]  Something that would run this massive bloated unconstitutional government for a full year.
[41:20.080 --> 41:23.160]  That's what we have spent on the war in Afghanistan alone.
[41:23.160 --> 41:25.920]  That's not counting the war in Iraq or anything else that they're doing.
[41:25.920 --> 41:32.160]  I think we need to start talking about not war hawks but maybe war porks because that's
[41:32.160 --> 41:35.480]  really what's behind these perpetual wars.
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.440]  That's the military industrial complex getting their subsidy.
[41:39.440 --> 41:43.840]  And of course the news that came out last week, we saw one GOP representative say that
[41:43.840 --> 41:47.480]  Boehner actually lied to him to get his vote.
[41:47.480 --> 41:49.440]  They wanted to move this to a vote.
[41:49.440 --> 41:53.200]  They were told they were just going to get a short term continuing resolution.
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.920]  And when he voted to bring that up for a vote, to allow that to come to a vote, and there
[41:57.920 --> 42:01.480]  were two people that they had to convince, there were two votes short when they got it
[42:01.480 --> 42:02.480]  up for a vote.
[42:02.480 --> 42:07.160]  And of course then Boehner does the nice bait and switch and puts out an entire omnibus
[42:07.160 --> 42:10.880]  bill which is going to fund the government until next September.
[42:10.880 --> 42:16.080]  Not waiting until they have the leverage presumably to do something about it with a Republican
[42:16.080 --> 42:19.480]  Senate with a much larger majority in the House.
[42:19.480 --> 42:24.800]  No, they never had any intention of following through on any of that.
[42:24.800 --> 42:26.880]  So what's going on with that?
[42:26.880 --> 42:33.800]  As we see the government going in and pulling back and ensuring the derivatives again, understand
[42:33.800 --> 42:36.920]  where this all came from initially.
[42:36.920 --> 42:40.960]  Remember that back the Great Depression, of course there was a pump and dump element
[42:40.960 --> 42:41.960]  to it.
[42:41.960 --> 42:44.880]  Of course there was an element to it where they would inflate assets, then burst the
[42:44.880 --> 42:47.720]  bubble and then come back in and buy the assets on the cheap.
[42:47.720 --> 42:49.840]  The bankers have always done that.
[42:49.840 --> 42:56.000]  But the mechanism that they used for that were options, buying stocks on margins.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.760]  That's essentially the derivative market, although it's gotten far more complicated
[42:59.760 --> 43:00.760]  now.
[43:00.760 --> 43:06.440]  Now to stop that from happening, they enacted Glass-Steagall which would separate those
[43:06.440 --> 43:12.400]  kind of risky investments away from the core business of the banks which is simply keeping
[43:12.400 --> 43:17.240]  checking and savings accounts and loaning out safe collateralized, making safe collateralized
[43:17.240 --> 43:20.240]  loans like real estate or cars, that sort of thing.
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.120]  So they put Glass-Steagall there to force the banks to divest themselves from these
[43:24.120 --> 43:26.600]  risky businesses.
[43:26.600 --> 43:31.520]  That's the way things continued until under Clinton Glass-Steagall was repealed.
[43:31.520 --> 43:38.480]  And then in very rapid secession, the bankers created MERS, a construct that allowed them
[43:38.480 --> 43:41.320]  to break the chain of title in mortgages.
[43:41.320 --> 43:45.920]  So they could collateralize them and sell them as securities.
[43:45.920 --> 43:52.560]  They also created remix which allowed them to, that was created back in the 1986, but
[43:52.560 --> 43:58.080]  then they created different ways to use these mechanisms that had never been done before
[43:58.080 --> 44:04.680]  and it didn't take very long for them to create the massive, unsecured mortgage bubble which
[44:04.680 --> 44:09.000]  basically ripped off investors at the same time that it took a lot of people's homes
[44:09.000 --> 44:15.600]  because they punctured that bubble, leaving a lot of people so far underwater that they
[44:15.600 --> 44:17.680]  couldn't refinance their homes.
[44:17.680 --> 44:21.760]  Now in response to that, they come out with Dodd-Frank which is supposed to then break
[44:21.760 --> 44:25.560]  that apart again to some degree, not a full re-enactment of Glass-Steagall but at least
[44:25.560 --> 44:29.040]  moving some of these derivatives away from the banks.
[44:29.040 --> 44:31.480]  That has just been undone again.
[44:31.480 --> 44:35.680]  And we know that the security markets with all these different instruments that they
[44:35.680 --> 44:40.320]  have created, very ingenious, very ingenious ways to gamble.
[44:40.320 --> 44:41.920]  They're gambling with your money.
[44:41.920 --> 44:46.040]  You're going to make them whole now thanks to Boehner and the Democrats.
[44:46.040 --> 44:52.200]  You will make them whole if these gambling casino derivatives don't hold up.
[44:52.200 --> 44:55.640]  And the question is, why would they do this now?
[44:55.640 --> 45:00.760]  Why would the Democrats anger their base, alienate their base?
[45:00.760 --> 45:06.640]  So it looks like the only one who is making any capital off of this is coming up against
[45:06.640 --> 45:12.480]  Hillary Clinton but Obama as well as Harry Reid and the rest of them are falling on the
[45:12.480 --> 45:15.760]  sword essentially to push this through very quickly.
[45:15.760 --> 45:17.720]  Well here's an idea.
[45:17.720 --> 45:22.400]  These derivatives are already starting to snowball into something that could be very
[45:22.400 --> 45:23.400]  serious.
[45:23.400 --> 45:26.000]  And we're going to talk to Paul Craig Roberts about this in the next hour.
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.840]  There's a headline here from David Stockman's ContraCorner.com.
[45:30.840 --> 45:31.840]  Here's a headline.
[45:31.840 --> 45:38.520]  He said, here comes Wall Street's latest toxic waste, oil-linked notes which blow up
[45:38.520 --> 45:42.960]  under $80 per barrel prices.
[45:42.960 --> 45:45.440]  I think this is what's really behind this.
[45:45.440 --> 45:46.760]  This is why they couldn't wait.
[45:46.760 --> 45:48.440]  This is why they needed to do it right away.
[45:48.440 --> 45:53.200]  And he points out in the mid-2000s, it was a massive one-way leverage bet that house
[45:53.200 --> 45:55.600]  prices would never go down.
[45:55.600 --> 46:01.640]  In the mid-2000s, it became a leveraged one-way bet that commodity prices like oil would never
[46:01.640 --> 46:03.000]  go down.
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.760]  But now they are going down.
[46:04.760 --> 46:05.760]  And guess what?
[46:05.760 --> 46:08.320]  It's not a natural decline.
[46:08.320 --> 46:14.120]  This is something that is being engineered by the CIA's ally, Saudi Arabia.
[46:14.120 --> 46:17.720]  Now the obvious thing is that they're coming after our domestic oil production.
[46:17.720 --> 46:22.440]  We've got a lot of new ways to produce oil, a lot of new discoveries, but of course getting
[46:22.440 --> 46:25.640]  the oil from oil shell, also using fracking.
[46:25.640 --> 46:28.240]  That is something that is competition for the Saudis.
[46:28.240 --> 46:34.680]  So they obviously have an economic interest to try to put their competition out of business.
[46:34.680 --> 46:39.600]  And this is what big companies always do to small retailers or to small companies.
[46:39.600 --> 46:44.560]  They'll come in and they'll operate at a loss for a while until they can drive their competitors
[46:44.560 --> 46:46.680]  out of business and then they've got a monopoly again.
[46:46.680 --> 46:48.480]  So that's one aspect of it.
[46:48.480 --> 46:53.200]  But of course, that is driving out American producers of oil.
[46:53.200 --> 46:57.520]  That is making us dependent on Saudi Arabia fully again.
[46:57.520 --> 47:03.360]  And of course it is also aimed at Russia as part of the larger cold war that is being
[47:03.360 --> 47:04.360]  renewed.
[47:04.360 --> 47:10.960]  But he points out here, nothing says exuberant ignorance like limited upside and unlimited
[47:10.960 --> 47:13.680]  downside over the counter derivatives.
[47:13.680 --> 47:15.640]  And that's what we're seeing right here.
[47:15.640 --> 47:19.840]  He says the question is, who is on the other side of all of these notes?
[47:19.840 --> 47:21.920]  The snowball is already starting.
[47:21.920 --> 47:27.880]  And you can see that as the credit spreads have started to bleed higher and higher.
[47:27.880 --> 47:33.040]  Now a story up from Business Insider says the weekend is over and crude oil is falling.
[47:33.040 --> 47:38.320]  They said this morning that it had fallen over the weekend, 1%, and it was down more
[47:38.320 --> 47:42.080]  than 2% earlier in the evening last night.
[47:42.080 --> 47:45.280]  So this is something that is unfolding.
[47:45.280 --> 47:48.520]  It is all connected.
[47:48.520 --> 47:53.920]  The insurance of derivatives for the larger banks and these derivatives that are starting
[47:53.920 --> 47:55.640]  to come unraveled.
[47:55.640 --> 47:57.660]  Listen to this article from Zero Hedge.
[47:57.660 --> 48:02.520]  They point out that the severity of the decline in these Middle Eastern stock markets, which
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.880]  are now basically taking a bloodbath as their headlines, they said that in Dubai, the stock
[48:07.880 --> 48:14.720]  market is down 7.5%, extending Thursday's 7.5% route, 7.4%.
[48:14.720 --> 48:22.920]  Abu Dhabi was down 3.6%, Qatar slid 5.9%, Kuwait 2.9%, and Saudi's market, the largest
[48:22.920 --> 48:24.840]  in the region, retreated 3.3%.
[48:24.840 --> 48:26.400]  So their stock markets are plunging.
[48:26.400 --> 48:27.560]  Why are they plunging?
[48:27.560 --> 48:30.600]  Well, because people are selling off their derivatives.
[48:30.600 --> 48:32.360]  There you go.
[48:32.360 --> 48:33.360]  That's the derivatives.
[48:33.360 --> 48:37.840]  It's the same thing that we saw back in 2008.
[48:37.840 --> 48:41.880]  The story that's up on Infowars.com, we just witnessed the worst week for global financial
[48:41.880 --> 48:43.800]  markets in three years.
[48:43.800 --> 48:47.080]  And he points out that in the summer of 2008, here's the pattern, here's what you need to
[48:47.080 --> 48:51.040]  worry about because this is a snowball that is starting to roll down the hill.
[48:51.040 --> 48:55.440]  He says in the summer of 2008, the price of oil utterly collapsed.
[48:55.440 --> 48:57.200]  We all remember what happened after that.
[48:57.200 --> 49:01.920]  Well, the same patterns that we're witnessing back in 2008 are happening again.
[49:01.920 --> 49:08.160]  Because the price of oil crashed in 2008, so did prices for a whole host of other commodities.
[49:08.160 --> 49:11.800]  And that is also happening yet again.
[49:11.800 --> 49:17.360]  Once commodities started crashing, the market for junk bonds started to implode.
[49:17.360 --> 49:18.640]  That is also happening again.
[49:18.640 --> 49:23.600]  Finally, toward the end of 2008, we witnessed a horrifying stock market crash.
[49:23.600 --> 49:26.080]  Could we be on the verge of another one of those?
[49:26.080 --> 49:32.920]  He points out that WTIs, that's West Texas Intermediate, that's a metric for crude oil
[49:32.920 --> 49:39.960]  prices in Texas and the U.S., WTIs' second worst week in over three years was last week.
[49:39.960 --> 49:42.920]  They've been down 10 out of the last 11 weeks.
[49:42.920 --> 49:47.720]  The Dow's worst week in three years, and on and on and on.
[49:47.720 --> 49:49.400]  That's where this is headed.
[49:49.400 --> 49:53.480]  But if you think you're going to get even any temporary relief, think again.
[49:53.480 --> 49:58.000]  Because we see this story out of the Independent in the U.K. saying that the new era of cheap
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.520]  oil is going to destroy the Green Revolution.
[50:00.520 --> 50:05.160]  See, it's a bad thing when oil prices drop.
[50:05.160 --> 50:07.320]  And of course, as I said before, it's only a temporary thing.
[50:07.320 --> 50:12.880]  It's only to drive out new sources of oil, only to drive out their competition.
[50:12.880 --> 50:15.240]  They're going to bring it back with a vengeance.
[50:15.240 --> 50:16.840]  You're going to be paying dearly for this.
[50:16.840 --> 50:20.240]  But you're not even going to get in the U.K. at least.
[50:20.240 --> 50:26.880]  They're saying that they're not going to possibly even see a short-term relief in oil prices.
[50:26.880 --> 50:28.800]  Of course, they will have to pump.
[50:28.800 --> 50:35.880]  But they're saying that as far as power generation goes, they expect to see an increase for consumers.
[50:35.880 --> 50:41.080]  Because they want to make sure that renewables are being subsidized.
[50:41.080 --> 50:43.440]  And they're going to look bad if oil is cheap.
[50:43.440 --> 50:45.720]  So you see, you can't win either way.
[50:45.720 --> 50:50.360]  They're not even going to let you take advantage of a temporary decline in oil prices.
[50:50.360 --> 50:56.120]  They're going to transfer money from you to renewable energy sources, which don't work
[50:56.120 --> 50:57.120]  on the grid.
[50:57.120 --> 50:58.920]  They work fine individually, but they don't work on the grid.
[50:58.920 --> 50:59.920]  Stay with us.
[50:59.920 --> 51:00.920]  We'll be right back with Paul Krugroth.
[51:00.920 --> 51:03.680]  This is a serious topic for all men.
[51:03.680 --> 51:08.040]  Every single man listening may have a prostate problem if he lives long enough.
[51:08.040 --> 51:09.040]  That's right.
[51:09.040 --> 51:13.840]  All of us men may suffer from a prostate problem, like urinating more often, waking at night
[51:13.840 --> 51:16.520]  to urinate, or problems with intimacy.
[51:16.520 --> 51:22.840]  That's why every man needs to call for a free bottle of Superbeta Prostate, a non-prescription
[51:22.840 --> 51:27.120]  formula guaranteed to reduce the symptoms of your enlarged prostate.

[51:33.560 --> 51:36.080]  Prostate problems may not be an issue of if.
[51:36.080 --> 51:39.160]  They can be an issue of when.
[51:39.160 --> 51:44.880]  Prostate of Prostate's ingredient is clinically shown to reduce urges to urinate, reduce waking
[51:44.880 --> 51:47.960]  at night to go, and help improve intimacy.
[51:47.960 --> 51:49.680]  Call for your free bottle.

[51:56.760 --> 52:00.200]  Call 1-800-964-7470.
[52:00.200 --> 52:04.560]  Are you happy doing your laundry with perfumed detergents that irritate your skin?
[52:04.560 --> 52:09.300]  Are you happy washing your hands with stinking fragrances that give your skin rashes?

[53:56.440 --> 54:23.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, your host today, and the next
[54:23.240 --> 54:26.760]  hour we're going to be joined by Paul Craig Roberts, and of course we're going to talk
[54:26.760 --> 54:29.700]  to him about some of his articles that have come out recently.
[54:29.700 --> 54:35.000]  We are on the brink of war and economic collapse, that's the title of a recent article by Paul
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  Craig Roberts.
[54:36.000 --> 54:43.600]  I just talked about the connection between this baner budget betrayal and derivatives,
[54:43.600 --> 54:48.960]  and the manufactured collapse of oil prices targeted at American producers, and of course
[54:48.960 --> 54:52.040]  targeted at Russia as part of the larger Cold War.
[54:52.040 --> 54:54.360]  So we're going to talk to him about that in the next hour.
[54:54.360 --> 54:59.760]  I want to let you know though that X2 is now on sale for the first time ever.
[54:59.760 --> 55:04.760]  We have 17% off plus free shipping, you can get it for $24.99 normally, with shipping
[55:04.760 --> 55:06.760]  you would have paid up to $38.00.
[55:06.760 --> 55:10.840]  Now this is going to be a sale that's only going to run through next Monday, and of course
[55:10.840 --> 55:15.160]  if you get it within the next two days you can get guaranteed Christmas delivery.
[55:15.160 --> 55:23.280]  That's X2 on sale at InfoWars Life, check that out and that's our strongest iodine supplement.
[55:23.280 --> 55:27.520]  As I pointed out earlier, the CDC says that iodine deficiency is one of the four major
[55:27.520 --> 55:33.080]  deficiency diseases in the world, also though one of the easiest to correct.
[55:33.080 --> 55:37.520]  They have taken sources of iodine pretty much out of the food supply after having put it
[55:37.520 --> 55:41.240]  in there, but now you can put it back in for yourself and for your family.
[55:41.240 --> 55:45.640]  In that sale, for what would normally cost you a shipping $38.00 you can now get for
[55:45.640 --> 55:46.640]  $24.99.
[55:46.640 --> 55:53.320]  Now as I said, Paul Craig Roberts is going to be joining us talking about the economic
[55:53.320 --> 56:02.960]  issues and how they all tie into war, because Putin takes the economic viability of his
[56:02.960 --> 56:06.600]  country very seriously, unlike our leadership.
[56:06.600 --> 56:10.800]  He takes it very seriously when they try to destroy his purchasing power, and of course
[56:10.800 --> 56:14.560]  this is all part of the larger Cold War.
[56:14.560 --> 56:17.800]  We should be concerned about the fact that they're shutting down power plants left and
[56:17.800 --> 56:19.120]  right in the United States.
[56:19.120 --> 56:24.240]  We are the only ones that supposedly contribute to global warming.
[56:24.240 --> 56:28.240]  That's the fantasy that's being used to try to shut down our energy production.
[56:28.240 --> 56:34.560]  And let me tell you, nothing affects your standard of living and even your longevity
[56:34.560 --> 56:39.360]  of life more than access to cheap energy.
[56:39.360 --> 56:43.120]  That is what Saudi Arabia is trying to destroy right now.
[56:43.120 --> 56:50.040]  Saudi Arabia, the ally of the CIA, of course, does not have the best interest of the United
[56:50.040 --> 56:51.320]  States at heart.
[56:51.320 --> 56:54.760]  They're trying to shut down our new sources of energy.
[56:54.760 --> 57:01.800]  At the same time, we see that they're not giving up on their crazy energy agenda, their
[57:01.800 --> 57:03.440]  climate change agenda.
[57:03.440 --> 57:09.880]  We've heard Obama say that he's going to use the EPA to shut down more power generation
[57:09.880 --> 57:15.120]  in the United States, and he doesn't think that the GOP can stop him, even with their
[57:15.120 --> 57:16.120]  new majority.
[57:16.120 --> 57:17.640]  So he's thrown the gauntlet down.
[57:17.640 --> 57:21.720]  He said even before he got elected that he wanted to shut down the coal industry, and
[57:21.720 --> 57:26.640]  we saw just last month when he went to China that he made an agreement with them that we
[57:26.640 --> 57:33.960]  would essentially cut over the next 11 years, 25% of our energy production.
[57:33.960 --> 57:40.640]  They would not even have to cap theirs for another 15 years, and I think it was 16 years.
[57:40.640 --> 57:42.000]  Yes, it was 16 years.
[57:42.000 --> 57:47.440]  We have to cut ours over 11, but they're allowed to continue to grow theirs for another 16 before
[57:47.440 --> 57:49.520]  they even have to cap it.
[57:49.520 --> 57:53.920]  And of course, they're growing their energy production at an exponential rate, not really
[57:53.920 --> 57:56.080]  concerned about pollution.
[57:56.080 --> 58:01.040]  If this is a global problem, why aren't they concerned about China?
[58:01.040 --> 58:07.280]  Well, of course, they're really moving this, I believe, to a kind of replacement for the
[58:07.280 --> 58:08.280]  central banks.
[58:08.280 --> 58:14.480]  Back in the 1930s, globalists were talking about how they would get rid of the fiat currencies,
[58:14.480 --> 58:18.360]  and central banks is the element of control, and they would turn to energy.
[58:18.360 --> 58:20.600]  That would be the way they would control us.
[58:20.600 --> 58:25.440]  And that's essentially what's behind these carbon credits, essentially paying a indulgence
[58:25.440 --> 58:28.560]  fee to them for any and everything you do.
[58:28.560 --> 58:30.080]  That's the way to control you, isn't it?
[58:30.080 --> 58:31.080]  We'll be right back.
[58:31.080 --> 58:58.080]  The next hour, Paul Craig Roberts, stay with us.
[58:58.080 --> 59:26.640]  We'll be right back.
[59:26.640 --> 59:55.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:56.640 --> 1:00:22.440]  We'll be right back.
[1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:30.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:31.400]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:34.000]  Joining us in the next segment will be Paul Craig Roberts.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:40.400]  We're going to be talking about recent developments in the economy, as well as the build-up intentions
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:46.160]  that may lead to a Third World War, at least to a much, much revived Cold Wars we've already
[1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:47.160]  seen.
[1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:50.040]  And of course, that involves the manipulation of the price of oil.
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:57.680]  It also involves the Congress, Boehner, and the Democrats, signing us up to ensure the
[1:00:57.680 --> 1:01:00.040]  derivatives of the large banks.
[1:01:00.040 --> 1:01:01.640]  That's a big part of this.
[1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:07.640]  Now another aspect of betrayal, I believe, of this budget can be seen in pensions.
[1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:10.800]  Now, of course, there's a lot of different ways that people can get their pensions.
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:14.480]  We have Social Security, a lot of people think of as their pension.
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:16.080]  Well, guess what they did?
[1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:22.640]  They just allow with this open border amnesty program incentivizing illegal immigration.
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:26.880]  They allow those illegal immigrants to be allowed to get Social Security benefits.
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:28.880]  That's one of the things that we're going to see happen there.
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:32.960]  Social Security was already insolvent before we opened our borders to the world and told
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:37.520]  everybody they can come to America and retire at our expense or come with disabilities and
[1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:41.640]  get the entitlement programs here as if they had been a citizen of this country.
[1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:46.920]  Of course, you can't sustain that, that's the exact purpose of this open amnesty.
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:50.600]  But, of course, there's another government pension program, and that's the one that they
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:55.000]  give to employees, to teachers, to cops.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.520]  Those are known as unfunded liabilities.
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:01:59.360]  We've seen this happening for a long time.
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:04.760]  I saw that explained once by a think tank that was trying to convince the Illinois
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:08.080]  Teachers Union to adopt a private pension plan.
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:12.240]  What they had was a large trash can, and they were dumping dollar bills into it, and they
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:16.840]  said, this is what your pension plan looks like right now that's under the government.
[1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:21.040]  And then the same guy that had the trash can starts walking out and reaching his hand in
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:24.560]  and throwing fistfuls of money out into the audience, and he goes, but of course this
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:26.800]  money, you can't see how much is in there.
[1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:30.280]  You can't see if it's actually earmarked for you because it's not, and of course it's
[1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:34.800]  being given away by the government as he throws this money by the fistful into the audience.
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:37.800]  He said, what we're proposing is that you have a private pension plan.
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:43.960]  It looks something like this, and he holds a transparent glass, and he sticks a dollar
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:44.960]  bill in it.
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:49.480]  He goes, this is yours, this is attached to you, and you can see exactly how much is
[1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:50.480]  in it.
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:54.520]  Well, the problem is, is that we've had that in terms of private pensions.
[1:02:54.520 --> 1:03:00.240]  We see that many people who have worked for corporations for 20, 30 years, they had an
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:01.240]  agreement.
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:03.160]  They knew exactly what was in their pension plan.
[1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:04.680]  That was always sacrosanct.
[1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:10.680]  If you could not touch that under bankruptcy, under any other circumstances, it was set.
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:15.040]  Now the Boehner budget has attacked that.
[1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:21.680]  They're going to allow those corporations, people who have made private commitments to
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:27.800]  workers for their retirement, they're going to allow them to come in and restructure that.
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:31.080]  And that means that they're not that far away from bail ins either.
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:35.840]  The other form of a private pension where you take your money and you put it into some
[1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:39.880]  kind of an investment or an IRA, they're going to come after that as well.
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:41.120]  So there's the four.
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:43.560]  You think any of those are secure?
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:46.600]  Not a single one of those are secure.
[1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:52.640]  And it really underscores, I think, the drastic decline in standard of living here in America.
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:57.440]  When you look at how these companies are trying to make the case that they need to have relief
[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:01.880]  from these pension commitments, from these liabilities on their balance sheet, they need
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:04.600]  to have the ability to restructure those deals.
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:07.440]  In other words, to cut your benefits.
[1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:11.240]  Think about somebody that's worked for 30 years, that's about to retire with some large
[1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:13.400]  corporation if that even happens anymore.
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:15.320]  Most people are fired before that happens.
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:18.560]  But think about that kind of commitment that they made, let's say, 30 years ago.
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:22.360]  If you look at the inflation calculator to see what the purchasing power of the dollar
[1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:30.640]  is, that means that if you were to buy something in 1984 for $20, today you would pay $45.70
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:31.640]  for that.
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:36.640]  In other words, spend 128% increase in the price of things.
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:41.920]  Or looking at it another way, the dollar has lost that much purchasing power, about half
[1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:43.600]  of its purchasing power, whatever.
[1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:49.280]  So they're now going to not be able to pay you back those commitments that they made
[1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:54.760]  30 years ago, they're not going to be able to pay that back with devalued dollars.
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:57.480]  That's the ropes that the American economy is on.
[1:04:57.480 --> 1:04:59.480]  That's how desperate things have gotten.
[1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:00.800]  Stay with us to be right back with Paul Craig Rock.
[1:05:00.800 --> 1:05:05.960]  2015 is almost here and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform
[1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:07.880]  your body the way you want it.
[1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:11.800]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:16.920]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with oxy powder, the next level in cleansing
[1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:23.360]  the body naturally, using super oxygenation, oxy powder, available through InfoWarsLife.com.

[1:05:26.680 --> 1:05:31.480]  InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Doe has been using oxy powder with incredible success.
[1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:35.320]  I took it that first day and I took it for six more days after that, 12 pounds melted
[1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:39.880]  off in about a week, I'd say a week, seven days and I've been able to keep it off too.
[1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:43.560]  My wife is like, wow, you look really good and I'm like, I know, I guess it's this oxy
[1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:44.560]  powder.
[1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:46.240]  2015 can be different.
[1:05:46.240 --> 1:05:49.400]  That and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:51.720]  Oxy powder flushes it out.
[1:05:51.720 --> 1:06:00.240]  Secure your oxy powder at infowarslife.com, that's infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:38.200]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:40.200]  Can you put two and two together?
[1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:45.800]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:47.800]  priced and fully legal.

[1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:19.240]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:20.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:25.240]  I'm David Knight on this Monday, December 15, 2014.
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:27.840]  Joining us now is Paul Craig Roberts.
[1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:32.640]  But before I go to him and talk about what's happening to the world in terms of economics,
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:36.800]  in terms of lurching towards war, I want to let you know that for the first time we've
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:42.720]  had X2, Survival Shield X2 on sale, it's the first time we've ever had it on sale.
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:46.600]  And that sale is 17% off plus free shipping.
[1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:48.360]  So normally it's $29.99.
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:52.440]  You now get it for $24.99 plus with free shipping.
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:54.760]  Without free shipping, you would have paid $38 for it.
[1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:57.320]  So now you're getting it for $24.99.
[1:08:57.320 --> 1:09:00.160]  This is a sale that's only going to run through next Monday.
[1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:04.840]  If you order it now, within the next two days, you get guaranteed delivery by Christmas.
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:12.520]  And again, that's Survival Shield X2, available at InfowarsLife.com on sale for just the next
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:13.520]  week.
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:15.560]  Now, joining us is Paul Craig Roberts.
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:20.520]  And of course, he was the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during the Reagan administration.
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:27.320]  He was famous as the co-founder of Reaganomics, an author of many books, eight, it says right
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:29.080]  here, eight different books.
[1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:34.960]  A PhD from Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Virginia.
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:37.920]  And I wanted to ask him, Dr. Roberts, thank you for joining us.
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:42.200]  I wanted to ask you about what's going on, your take on oil.
[1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:48.080]  It looks to me like it has got multiple aspects of it, not only attacking our domestic energy
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:53.720]  production, but also a knife aimed straight at the jugular of Putin and Russia.
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:54.720]  Would you say?
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:10:02.080]  David, I don't really know, all I know for a fact, if news reports are correct and you
[1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:10.080]  never know if that's true either, that the OPEC or the Saudis primarily, normally when
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:18.200]  you have a recession and the demand for oil drops and the price starts going down, in
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:21.680]  the past, the Saudis restrict their output.
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:27.480]  They cut back the production in order to reduce the fall in the price.
[1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:33.200]  So they protect the price by restricting output when the demand falls.
[1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:34.400]  That's the normal behavior.
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:37.360]  This time, this is not happening, apparently.
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:42.760]  If news reports are correct, of course, I'm not connected to the oil industry and have
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:46.640]  no independent information about it.
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:55.080]  So if news reports are correct for the first time or for an unusual incident, the Saudis
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:11:00.400]  are not restricting output as the demand falls, and so the price is going down.
[1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:10.200]  Now, the effect of this, of course, is devastating for the American fracking industry.
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:18.680]  You might remember that in order to get fracking underway and give fracking companies the ability
[1:11:18.680 --> 1:11:27.560]  to override community concerns, homeowner concerns, to override people's concerns with
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:35.960]  surface water and ground water, the industry promised 100 years of energy independence.
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:42.640]  In other words, they created this impression that the United States would no longer have
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:50.200]  any imported energy, that we would have a century of our own energy, and by making these
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:58.480]  kinds of claims and establishing this kind of attitude, they were able to override the
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:01.960]  real objections to fracking.
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:08.760]  Now, all of that fracking started with a much higher oil price.
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:11.880]  The price falls down like it does.
[1:12:11.880 --> 1:12:19.120]  This industry doesn't pay the cost higher than the price, and so you could look at this
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:24.640]  as the Saudis were taken in by this propaganda.
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:30.200]  I've seen various reports from people who claim to be experts that at best there was
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:34.080]  20 years of fracking, not 100.
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:36.560]  Now, maybe the Saudis were taken in.
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:41.320]  They didn't want to lose their market, so they're just driving these companies into
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:42.320]  the ground.
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:45.280]  That's one explanation.
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:52.280]  Another explanation that people advance is that we've hired the Saudis to put the pressure
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:59.880]  on Russian revenues by driving down the price of oil because the Russian economy is dependent
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:07.120]  in some ways on the sale of oil, and so the price of oil is driven down, and generally
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:12.080]  all energy prices tend to move together, so maybe it also hurts their sales and natural
[1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:13.080]  gas.
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:20.720]  And so this is seen as an effort of the United States to hurt Russia's ability to resist
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:25.560]  the various U.S. and NATO EU pressures.
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:28.920]  I don't know what the answer is.
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:34.520]  The only fact we know is that for some reason the Saudis are not restricting output in order
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:36.120]  to protect the price.
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:40.520]  Well, let's look at what is going to come, regardless of what the motivations were on
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:41.520]  this.
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:46.080]  Let's look at some of the immediate practical considerations that are going to come under
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:47.080]  fire here.
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:50.680]  As I talked about earlier, we've got this report from David Stockman's Contra Corner
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:54.440]  says, here comes Wall Street's latest toxic waste.
[1:13:54.440 --> 1:14:00.920]  He says, oil linked notes will blow up under $80, many of them, and so are you concerned
[1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:04.640]  about the derivatives market that's attached to oil prices?
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:12.240]  Yes, a lot of people are, not just David.
[1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:21.280]  I think that is a possible explosive event for the banks, and it could be the reason
[1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:29.600]  that I think it's the Citibank chairman that's been pressing to overcome the part of the
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:40.920]  replacement legislation for Glass-Steagall, that if they can get that repeal, it lets
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:48.680]  them have access to depositors' accounts in the event they're derivative problems.
[1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:55.840]  So that could be one of the reasons that the Citibank chairman is pressing to overturn
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:03.800]  this legislation, because the legislation, I think, requires them to move their derivative
[1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:11.880]  stuff into subsidiaries and get it off the entity that holds the consumer deposits.
[1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:12.880]  That's correct.
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:16.560]  Well, Dodd-Frank, they were supposed to separate out those speculative investments away from
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:21.520]  their core banking business, which would be insured by FDIC deposits, and we've seen
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:28.720]  a lot of heavy lobbying by Diamond as well as by Citibank to get this in, and it looks
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:30.600]  like they got what they wanted.
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:35.600]  That's part of the budget deal that got rammed through by Boehner, and of course, it's alienated
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:37.800]  even a lot of the Democrat base.
[1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:43.240]  They essentially have alienated their voters by giving this massive gift to the bankers,
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:49.600]  telling them, we'll underwrite and ensure your risky investments using the U.S. taxpayer.
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:51.800]  So Elizabeth Warren wasn't able to block it.
[1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:53.640]  I know she was trying to block it.
[1:15:53.640 --> 1:15:54.640]  Yeah.
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:15:58.000]  I think the deal has gone through, I believe, anyway.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:02.400]  That's what they're trying to do, and whether that's gone through or not is an indication
[1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:08.720]  that they themselves are worried about the oil derivatives, but there are all sorts of
[1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:10.720]  other derivatives.
[1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:19.720]  Many of them could blow up, and so what we see again is that three or four banks control
[1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:25.520]  the economic policy of the United States, and they control the fate of all the rest
[1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:26.520]  of us.
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:27.520]  Yeah, that's very true.
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:29.440]  We were talking about this in the last hour.
[1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:35.400]  This Michael Schneider went through and looked at how bad the week was last week in terms
[1:16:35.400 --> 1:16:39.520]  of economic metrics, and he pointed out the similarities to 2008.
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:43.840]  First we had an oil crash, then we had a commodities crash, then we had junk bonds crashing, and
[1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:46.040]  then we had the stock market crashing.
[1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:52.040]  So all it takes when you've got this derivatives market that now by some people's estimate
[1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:58.160]  is over a quad trillion dollars worldwide, when you've got an economy that is only worldwide
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:02.560]  GDP is only about what, 60 trillion or whatever, when you've got that much speculation out
[1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:08.360]  there, that large derivatives market, that it just takes one part of it to explode, and
[1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:12.520]  that can essentially kind of create an economic avalanche, can't it?
[1:17:12.520 --> 1:17:23.520]  That's right, and remember now the recession at the end of 2007, this was caused by the
[1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:28.200]  exploding fraudulent financial instruments.
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:36.720]  This time around, it may be that the recession itself causes the financial instruments to
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:44.600]  explode, because there's every indication that not only has there never been a recovery,
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:55.760]  the recovery is an illusion created by understating inflation, overstating GDP growth, overstating
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:18:03.600]  jobs, not counting discouraged workers as unemployed.
[1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:10.880]  The whole thing is an illusion, and it's shot to pieces by the facts, for example, the Federal
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:21.400]  Reserve, it's just on a survey, and they found that about that half of 25 year olds
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:24.960]  are back at home living with parents.
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:30.440]  They're either unemployed or the jobs they have are not sufficient to pay rent.
[1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:37.320]  I think that the fantasy that we have recovered economically from 2008, I think that's really
[1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:42.520]  underscored by what happened with the pension plans, and the fact that Democrats and Republicans
[1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:48.280]  told us in this budget bill that they're going to give corporations the ability to renegotiate
[1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:49.280]  their pension commitments.
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:53.160]  That's something that has always in the past been sacrosanct, and when you look at the
[1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:57.880]  fact that private companies who have made these pension commitments decades ago would
[1:18:57.880 --> 1:19:03.120]  now be paying them back with much cheaper dollars, the purchasing power has been eroded
[1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:06.040]  by the Federal Reserve, they're not even able to make that.
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:08.040]  What does that tell us?
[1:19:08.040 --> 1:19:09.040]  Right.
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:13.760]  Of course, the theft of pensions goes back a long time.
[1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:24.080]  I think it started when Eastern Airlines was taking over his name, and of course they're
[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:31.440]  already cutting back and reducing all the municipal workers' pensions.
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:33.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:37.400]  Government pensions, they go by another name, and that's called unfunded mandates, isn't
[1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:38.400]  it?
[1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:42.080]  They're all, I don't think, and they're doing the same thing, Social Security.
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:43.080]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:46.280]  And of course bringing people in with the open borders, that's one thing that's really
[1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:47.280]  going to kill Social Security.
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:48.280]  We're going to be right back.
[1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:49.280]  We've got to go to break Dr. Roberts.
[1:19:49.280 --> 1:19:51.580]  We're going to be right back with Paul Craig Roberts.

[1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:05.400]  This baby shoots like a dream.
[1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:06.400]  Hey, thanks Guns80.com.
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:11.240]  You know, friends ask me all the time, why I wanted a Ghost AR-15.
[1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:12.240]  That's easy.
[1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:16.880]  Well, my buddy Mark kept telling me that I'd better go to Guns80.com to get myself a Ghost
[1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:19.160]  AR-15 before they outlawed them.
[1:22:19.160 --> 1:22:21.240]  I thought he was just paranoid, so I ignored it.
[1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:22.240]  Well, at first.
[1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:26.680]  But then I started hearing government media types talking about making Guns illegal, about
[1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:30.440]  the president signing on to a UN treaty that could take my gun rights away.
[1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:31.960]  You know, it really bugged me.
[1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:36.520]  So I dug in, I did the research, and I realized that Mark was right all along.
[1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:41.080]  I know now that having an unregistered Ghost AR-15 is the right answer.
[1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:45.320]  I'm a proud 80% Ghost AR-15 convert, you should be too.

[1:24:13.880 --> 1:24:17.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, your host and we have on the phone
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:23.920]  with us Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, one of the co-founders of Reaganomics, an economist and
[1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:28.160]  author and we're talking to him about what the outlook is.
[1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:32.760]  And I guess maybe Dr. Roberts, we're coming to the end of the year, I'd like to kind of
[1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:39.080]  get your general forecast as to what lays ahead on your most recent essay on your site, Paul
[1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:44.560]  Craig Roberts.org is an article on the brink of war and economic collapse and you say on
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:48.560]  occasion a reader will ask if I can give readers some good news, the answer is not unless
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:52.400]  I lie to you like your government and the mainstream media do.
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:55.680]  So what's the bad news for next year?
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:25:02.560]  Well, you know David, let's cut to the chase, everything is based on lies, the economy is
[1:25:02.560 --> 1:25:11.840]  based on lies and we now see both houses of congress have passed resolutions that set
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:22.160]  the basis for Washington fighting the Russians to the death of the last Ukrainian soldier.
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:30.720]  We're clearly going to arm the Ukrainians and hope that they are involved in a war with
[1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:37.840]  Russia because this would greatly embarrass Russia who obviously would win the war and
[1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:45.400]  would be designated the aggressive and this would be used to further isolate Russia from
[1:25:45.400 --> 1:25:46.400]  Europe.
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:53.360]  So this is pretty much predictable given the two resolutions from the House and the Senate.
[1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:59.160]  I think the Senate vote was unanimous and the House vote was 411 to 10.
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:07.280]  So we see out of the entirety of the Congress, which I think is some 535 people, the Americans
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:18.440]  are people succeeded in electing 10 intelligent people.
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:23.760]  So much for democracy and for the economy as we were saying, when you have half of 25
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:30.040]  year olds, these are for the most part I think college educated, having to live at home because
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:38.240]  they can't get employment and you've got 30% of 30 year olds living at home in their former
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:42.520]  childhood rooms with their parents, then clearly there's no economy.
[1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:43.520]  It's just no economy.
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:44.520]  That's right.
[1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:45.520]  That's right.
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:47.480]  Nobody's able to create any wealth in their personal life.
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:55.880]  And when you spent two decades moving the American economy offshore so that shareholders
[1:26:55.880 --> 1:27:03.160]  could enjoy the capital gains from the higher profits from the lower labor cost and the
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:09.040]  executives of the corporations could enjoy multi-million dollar bonuses from the higher
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:15.200]  profits from the lower labor cost to move the jobs offshore, there's no economy here.
[1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:19.800]  So we have a massive trade deficit that can't possibly be closed.
[1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:24.000]  And so the whole house of cards is standing on the dollar.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  And the petro dollar and I think that's a key thing too that we see as they as they're
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:34.400]  moving to, as you see the price of oil plummeting, as many people believe it's Saudi Arabia that
[1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:39.920]  is, as you pointed out earlier, they declined to cut production as prices dropped.
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:43.160]  So they're basically feeding into this decline.
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:46.560]  And the petro dollar is really one of the few things that we've got here.
[1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:51.000]  This fantasy that we've, we've pushed on to the entire world, the petro dollar.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:57.960]  And of course, Putin is pushing with China and with India to try to go around the petro
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:27:58.960]  dollar.
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:02.360]  Once they do that, that's going to have tremendous impact for our standard of living, isn't it?
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:05.040]  Yes, it's not just the petro dollar.
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:09.280]  It's the use of the dollar as war reserve currency and as many other uses.
[1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:10.280]  Right, right.
[1:28:10.280 --> 1:28:13.640]  But that's kind of the core of its reserve currency aspect.
[1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:18.160]  And of course, as we talked about earlier, this is setting off a massive collapse of
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:22.240]  the derivatives market, which could cascade into the commodities, the stock markets, that's
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:29.360]  right, just as the Congress signs us up yet again to ensure the big bankers' speculations
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:30.360]  in the derivatives market.
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:38.040]  Well, if they grab everybody's bank deposits and everybody's pensions and so forth, and
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:42.440]  the population here will starve, they won't have any money.
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:49.680]  And so if they do that, they will provoke an amazing social unrest and this half the
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:54.960]  country's armed, the whole thing will blow up in their face.
[1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:59.000]  So I don't really know how stupid and foolish they will be.
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:05.600]  It was kind of an interesting little side story that came up last week where they were
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:12.960]  sending out $200,000 worth of emergency kits to managers at the seven or eight largest banks.
[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:16.200]  They were kind of a little $50 prepper kits.
[1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:22.120]  I don't know that that would have any practical value whatsoever, that small amount of prepping.
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:25.080]  But I think it kind of showed their concern, don't you?
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:29.080]  I didn't know what to make of that, whether that was a joke or what, because if it's
[1:29:29.080 --> 1:29:31.320]  faced, it doesn't make any sense.
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:32.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:29:32.320 --> 1:29:33.320]  Amazing.
[1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:34.320]  Well, thank you so much.

[1:32:22.500 --> 1:32:34.500]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time
[1:32:34.500 --> 1:32:38.860]  they're restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two and

[1:33:16.820 --> 1:33:23.820]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host today. We're going to be
[1:33:27.060 --> 1:33:31.580]  joined by Paul Joseph Watson in the next hour. We're going to talk about this attack that
[1:33:31.580 --> 1:33:36.340]  happened in Sydney. Who's behind it? How is it going to be used? We're going to talk
[1:33:36.340 --> 1:33:41.060]  to Paul Joseph Watson from the UK about that. I'm going to take your calls here in just
[1:33:41.060 --> 1:33:48.060]  a moment. Let me give you that number. It's 800-259-9231. That's 800-259-9231. If you
[1:33:48.420 --> 1:33:52.220]  want to weigh in on what we've been talking about today, of course, most of it has been
[1:33:52.220 --> 1:33:57.940]  about what Boehner and the GOP Republicans along with the Democrats, of course, have
[1:33:57.940 --> 1:34:04.940]  just foisted upon the American public. Essentially, opening the doors for attacks on pension
[1:34:04.940 --> 1:34:10.500]  plans, boosting the contribution limits that they've had before the caps, boosting those
[1:34:10.500 --> 1:34:17.000]  by a factor of 10, and then, of course, signing the American taxpayer up as the insurer of
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:23.220]  bank speculations at the same time that we see this collapse in the oil industry as well
[1:34:23.220 --> 1:34:29.380]  as the oil derivatives that are attached to that collapse. What is that going to mean?
[1:34:29.380 --> 1:34:33.780]  We've been talking about that with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. So if you want to comment on
[1:34:33.780 --> 1:34:39.340]  that or on the massive protests that were held this last weekend about police brutality
[1:34:39.340 --> 1:34:45.060]  or about torture and the fact that no one is ever held accountable, we can talk about
[1:34:45.060 --> 1:34:49.180]  any of that if you want to call. Again, that number is 800-259-9231. Now, before we go
[1:34:49.180 --> 1:34:55.140]  to your calls, I want to point out that we have the first ever sale for X2. It's going
[1:34:55.140 --> 1:35:02.140]  to be on sale for the next week, only up through next Monday, and you get 17% off plus free
[1:35:02.300 --> 1:35:08.340]  shipping. With shipping, you would have paid up to $38 a barrel. I'm talking about oil.
[1:35:08.340 --> 1:35:14.500]  Now, we're talking about X2, iodine, survival shield. You would have paid up to $38 per
[1:35:14.500 --> 1:35:20.300]  bottle. Now, you can get it for $24.99 with this sale up through next Monday. That's free
[1:35:20.300 --> 1:35:24.900]  shipping, and of course, if you order it within the next two days, you will get it by Christmas
[1:35:24.900 --> 1:35:29.340]  guaranteed. Now, talking about Christmas, there was an interesting story that was up on the
[1:35:29.340 --> 1:35:35.900]  Drudge Report today about a Cambridge school removing Santa Claus from their winter concert.
[1:35:35.900 --> 1:35:41.460]  What's that headline? Santa Claus Winter Concert. It's not Jesus. It's not a Christmas
[1:35:41.460 --> 1:35:48.460]  concert. It's Santa Claus. But even Santa Claus is now politically incorrect. So, Santa
[1:35:48.460 --> 1:35:54.900]  gets sacked. There you go. And this is because of the complaint of one person. One person.
[1:35:54.900 --> 1:36:00.380]  They say, traditionally, they have a concert, a winter concert, I imagine, that is closed
[1:36:00.380 --> 1:36:05.460]  with Santa running through the aisle. And they said the decision to remove him was based
[1:36:05.460 --> 1:36:11.940]  on the complaint of one person. Now, there's nothing Christian about Santa Claus, okay?
[1:36:11.940 --> 1:36:15.940]  Nothing at all Christian about Santa Claus. And a Muslim pointed this out. One of the
[1:36:15.940 --> 1:36:19.900]  people they talked to was Mohammed Hassan. I'm presuming he's a Muslim. They didn't identify
[1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:23.660]  him as that. I'm assuming by his name. But he says he doesn't look at Santa Claus as
[1:36:23.660 --> 1:36:29.460]  a religious symbol. He said, kids like that. It's fun for kids. It's good, said Hassan.
[1:36:29.460 --> 1:36:35.380]  But see, the political correctness and the tyranny of the minority is so bad that you
[1:36:35.380 --> 1:36:40.300]  can't even have Santa at a winter concert anymore.
[1:36:40.300 --> 1:36:47.140]  Now, in a related note, on the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, I haven't watched that for years.
[1:36:47.140 --> 1:36:52.100]  We basically don't have access to broadcast television. We just watch stuff on the Internet
[1:36:52.100 --> 1:36:58.460]  as we see fit. And I was looking at the photographs from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Look
[1:36:58.460 --> 1:37:01.820]  at what the balloons look like. And there was a, as you can see it right there. If you're
[1:37:01.820 --> 1:37:06.900]  looking at our video feed, you can see the elf on the shelf. And I looked at that and
[1:37:06.900 --> 1:37:11.180]  I was like, what in the world is that? I didn't know this character. Evidently, he's been
[1:37:11.180 --> 1:37:14.380]  around for about 10 years. My kids are older, so we didn't know anything about it. But they
[1:37:14.380 --> 1:37:18.700]  had this hunched over elf on a shelf and the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. I mean,
[1:37:18.700 --> 1:37:23.300]  it looked like he was trying to do something with a squatty potty. But this is based on
[1:37:23.300 --> 1:37:26.980]  a book in case you don't know. In case you're like me, you got older children, what do you
[1:37:26.980 --> 1:37:32.980]  don't know what happened with this? In the mid-2000s, somebody came out with a book and
[1:37:32.980 --> 1:37:37.420]  they self-published it. They came out with a toy and the idea is that you've got an elf
[1:37:37.420 --> 1:37:40.860]  who's playing a game of hide and seek with the children. He looks for different spots
[1:37:40.860 --> 1:37:44.860]  around the house. And so you hide the elf around the house in different places. And
[1:37:44.860 --> 1:37:49.140]  he comes with a thing, please do not touch me. My magic might go and Santa won't hear
[1:37:49.140 --> 1:37:55.620]  all that I've seen or know. In other words, this guy is this elf on a shelf is a spy
[1:37:55.620 --> 1:38:01.300]  for your kids. So you're going to let Santa spy on you as a message, I think, for your
[1:38:01.300 --> 1:38:07.860]  kids. You let Santa spy on you. You're going to be rewarded. And it reminded me of this
[1:38:07.860 --> 1:38:14.260]  essay that was done years ago by PJ O'Rourke where he said, Democrats are like Santa Claus
[1:38:14.260 --> 1:38:18.700]  and Republicans are like God. And of course, he's playing it out that, you know, Democrats
[1:38:18.700 --> 1:38:22.460]  just want to bestow gifts on you and everything. Republicans want to tell you what to do in
[1:38:22.460 --> 1:38:26.740]  terms of your life, you know, what you can, what you can do in this area of life, what
[1:38:26.740 --> 1:38:30.700]  you can do in that area of life. But the bottom line is, is that, yeah, government does portray
[1:38:30.700 --> 1:38:36.420]  itself certainly in the welfare state as Santa Claus. But here's a situation where you let
[1:38:36.420 --> 1:38:39.260]  Santa spy on you. And of course, this has been around for a long time. You know, as
[1:38:39.260 --> 1:38:44.380]  if you were good boy, little or bad girl or whatever, you know, he's going to give you
[1:38:44.380 --> 1:38:50.180]  presents or whatever. But to me, this is just another example. And I gotta say, we never
[1:38:50.180 --> 1:38:55.300]  lied to our kids. I think that's a very bad thing to do to your kids, basically to lie
[1:38:55.300 --> 1:38:59.580]  to them about things like Santa Claus and elves. I think that you're starting out that
[1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:04.420]  relationship in a very bad way. Your children need to trust you. They need to know that
[1:39:04.420 --> 1:39:08.900]  you're telling them the truth. You're presenting them and shaping them with a view of the world.
[1:39:08.900 --> 1:39:13.260]  And you ought to give them a view of the world that is as true as you understand it to be.
[1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:17.300]  So we never got into the whole Santa Claus thing or whatever. But I think when I saw
[1:39:17.300 --> 1:39:23.580]  this, it just struck me as totally creepy and kind of a predictive programming for the
[1:39:23.580 --> 1:39:27.220]  police state. I don't know the elf on the shelf. It's kind of crazy. Let's go to your
[1:39:27.220 --> 1:39:31.180]  calls right now. Let's go to Aaron in Montana. Go ahead, Aaron.
[1:39:31.180 --> 1:39:33.500]  Yes, Dave. How you doing?
[1:39:33.500 --> 1:39:36.780]  Doing good. You said you want to talk about Sydney?
[1:39:36.780 --> 1:39:42.260]  My question. Yeah. Well, you know, my question is this, didn't they already have an incident
[1:39:42.260 --> 1:39:48.740]  with Port Arthur in like the 90s? Yeah. Wasn't that the basis for gun control?
[1:39:48.740 --> 1:39:54.860]  Yeah. But didn't they also have like a foreign person in that was the shooter was like a
[1:39:54.860 --> 1:39:59.740]  foreign person and then they only shot the tourist within the local didn't really see
[1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:05.820]  the aftermath. Yeah. I don't remember that story that well. Paul is going to be on to
[1:40:05.820 --> 1:40:10.980]  talk to us about the specifics of this particular incident. Of course, he can pull that in.
[1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:16.820]  And of course, they have a lot of very careful gun control registration in Australia, don't
[1:40:16.820 --> 1:40:23.820]  they? Yeah, they do. And that's another thing I'm worried or wondering about is why is their
[1:40:23.820 --> 1:40:32.220]  police look like a military force, especially when they have an unarmed citizenry in Australia?
[1:40:32.220 --> 1:40:38.180]  Talking about, well, I think everybody is pretty much following the lead of the United
[1:40:38.180 --> 1:40:43.340]  States in terms of not only the militarization of the police, but as we pointed out earlier
[1:40:43.340 --> 1:40:49.300]  in the program, even in Japan, it looks like it's if you read between the lines from what
[1:40:49.300 --> 1:40:54.020]  the Prime Minister there, Abe said, he said they have to punish whistleblowers and government
[1:40:54.020 --> 1:40:59.260]  with 10 years in prison, journalists with five years in prison so that they can have
[1:40:59.260 --> 1:41:04.100]  access to the information from their ally, the US government looks to me like it's the
[1:41:04.100 --> 1:41:08.180]  US government that is pushing that kind of attack on the press, that kind of a closed
[1:41:08.180 --> 1:41:14.660]  society and everything we do in America now is closed. The mother of that young boy, that
[1:41:14.660 --> 1:41:20.540]  12 year old boy that was shot holding a BB gun, she said, you're not James Bond, you
[1:41:20.540 --> 1:41:24.900]  don't have a license to kill. Well, they view themselves as having a license to kill and
[1:41:24.900 --> 1:41:31.700]  they view themselves as operating on as the keepers of some kind of secret intelligence
[1:41:31.700 --> 1:41:37.660]  that they know something you don't know. And I see that attitude pervasive, not just in
[1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:42.300]  the police, but I see it in every government department that we try to talk to, whether
[1:41:42.300 --> 1:41:46.220]  it's local or whether it's state and certainly with the Fed, you can't get any information
[1:41:46.220 --> 1:41:51.340]  out of anybody, no one will be forthcoming and transparent with you. Was there anything
[1:41:51.340 --> 1:41:55.180]  else you want to talk about with Australia, John?
[1:41:55.180 --> 1:42:02.540]  No, that's pretty much it. I'm just curious the fact that their citizens don't have guns,
[1:42:02.540 --> 1:42:07.620]  so why does their police need to look like an occupying military force that just is really...
[1:42:07.620 --> 1:42:12.060]  Well, we all know the answer to that is because the government wants to intimidate its citizens
[1:42:12.060 --> 1:42:16.540]  and have them do whatever they want. I mean, we go back and look at this torture report.
[1:42:16.540 --> 1:42:22.820]  Some of the stuff there was just designed to humiliate people the same way the TSA is designed
[1:42:22.820 --> 1:42:27.660]  to humiliate people. You take people's dignity, you can take their freedom. You take their
[1:42:27.660 --> 1:42:32.620]  freedom, you can take their life. That's the progression. That's what the psychologists
[1:42:32.620 --> 1:42:37.180]  understand is B. F. Skinner that pointed out in his book, Beyond Freedom and Dignity, he
[1:42:37.180 --> 1:42:41.820]  thought that those were outmoded ideas that we needed to get rid of and we needed to treat
[1:42:41.820 --> 1:42:48.100]  people as if they were simply dolphins or dogs that we could reward and treat with positive
[1:42:48.100 --> 1:42:52.980]  operant conditioning. You do this and you get a treat. You let me humiliate you and
[1:42:52.980 --> 1:42:56.500]  touch you. You get to get on the plane and fly. That's the way this works, and that's
[1:42:56.500 --> 1:43:00.100]  what they're doing to people. Let's go to... Thank you, John. Let's go to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[1:43:00.100 --> 1:43:01.100]  Mike?
[1:43:01.100 --> 1:43:02.100]  Hi, David Elliott.
[1:43:02.100 --> 1:43:03.100]  Hi, doing good. Go ahead.
[1:43:03.100 --> 1:43:09.300]  Well, based on that, I just wanted to comment on that clip you guys played earlier about
[1:43:09.300 --> 1:43:17.580]  the police officer making that comment about the MRAP. So that's horrifying. Again, if
[1:43:17.580 --> 1:43:21.860]  every American citizen isn't supposed to believe in the Constitution, which is why
[1:43:21.860 --> 1:43:26.180]  we're all Americans here in this country, it can't be... What the hell are we supposed
[1:43:26.180 --> 1:43:27.180]  to be following?
[1:43:27.180 --> 1:43:31.740]  Yeah, it is, isn't it? Isn't that amazing that somebody... I mean, look, they take an
[1:43:31.740 --> 1:43:36.100]  oath to the Constitution. If they don't even understand what the Constitution is about,
[1:43:36.100 --> 1:43:40.860]  why would you take an oath to something and then criticize people who take it seriously,
[1:43:40.860 --> 1:43:46.700]  who you call constitutionalists? That is how perverted the training has become, and that's
[1:43:46.700 --> 1:43:51.540]  being driven out of Washington, D.C. That's coming from Homeland Security. It's coming
[1:43:51.540 --> 1:43:56.180]  from the FBI. It's also coming from the war games that we see being done by the military
[1:43:56.180 --> 1:44:00.180]  where they're training. I mean, Joe Biggs and I went to A.P. Hill. We walked through
[1:44:00.180 --> 1:44:05.420]  the area there. You could see how they're training for warfare against the American
[1:44:05.420 --> 1:44:09.460]  people. And of course, they have other facilities. They have a facility at Camp Lejeune where
[1:44:09.460 --> 1:44:14.300]  it's a more urban... Rather, a more rural environment. The one in A.P. Hill was a more
[1:44:14.300 --> 1:44:17.300]  urban environment. That's what they're training for.
[1:44:17.300 --> 1:44:22.580]  Can I ask you, too? I mean, do we have the name of that police officer, or did that
[1:44:22.580 --> 1:44:24.180]  make that comment, or...?
[1:44:24.180 --> 1:44:30.540]  I've got the article here. Do we have the name of that police officer, guys? I think...
[1:44:30.540 --> 1:44:35.620]  I think we do. I think we do. It's in Spokane, nevertheless. But we tried to contact the
[1:44:35.620 --> 1:44:40.620]  Mikhail Phelan, who wrote the article. Someone sent us the video clip. He wrote the article.
[1:44:40.620 --> 1:44:45.060]  We tried to contact the police chief. They did not have any comments, but we did get
[1:44:45.060 --> 1:44:52.380]  a comment from someone who's there in state government in Washington in Spokane. And it
[1:44:52.380 --> 1:44:58.300]  truly is outrageous. I agree with you. Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Wayne in Texas. Wayne?
[1:44:58.300 --> 1:45:04.700]  Yeah, David. I think it's saying possibly just another false flag. I was watching it
[1:45:04.700 --> 1:45:10.940]  this morning, and you see the cops come out after the hostage. You know, okay, after cops
[1:45:10.940 --> 1:45:15.900]  in there, why didn't they do the flashbang thing, why they were in there? And then in
[1:45:15.900 --> 1:45:21.540]  another little video, it looked like another cop came out another door. So I think this
[1:45:21.540 --> 1:45:24.780]  is Australia's indoctrination into the police state.
[1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:31.580]  Well, certainly, it looks like they're going to try to spin this into ISIS, even though
[1:45:31.580 --> 1:45:39.740]  this man, who was the presumed hostage taker, had no connections to ISIS or al-Nusra. Nevertheless,
[1:45:39.740 --> 1:45:44.860]  we've got a former CIA chief. We have this article up on infowars.com says ISIS is going
[1:45:44.860 --> 1:45:50.860]  to attack the US soon. So that's it. They're trying to make that connection. And most Americans
[1:45:50.860 --> 1:45:54.420]  are going to look at this, and they're going to say, yeah, that's right. We need to declare
[1:45:54.420 --> 1:45:58.660]  war on somebody in the Middle East, and let's go get these guys. And they're not going to
[1:45:58.660 --> 1:46:02.660]  make the distinction as to whether or not this guy was a lone shooter. They're going
[1:46:02.660 --> 1:46:07.780]  to instantly identify him with ISIS or al-Nusra in their minds, and then they're going to
[1:46:07.780 --> 1:46:11.460]  justify going to war. That's why you have these types of things. But that certainly
[1:46:11.460 --> 1:46:15.700]  is how it's going to be used.
[1:46:15.700 --> 1:46:19.220]  Thank you, Wayne. Let's go to Tim in Tennessee. Tim?
[1:46:19.220 --> 1:46:20.220]  Hi.
[1:46:20.220 --> 1:46:23.540]  Hey, go ahead.
[1:46:23.540 --> 1:46:30.540]  I just wanted to say, this nonsense about the Republicans taking over again, and all
[1:46:30.540 --> 1:46:35.220]  of a sudden, I'm 59 years old, and the same thing has been going on. Democrat, Republican,
[1:46:35.220 --> 1:46:39.220]  Democrat, Republican. And one's going to fix what the other one is going to fix it,
[1:46:39.220 --> 1:46:44.700]  and it's never going to change. But besides that, my thing is, I want to know when somebody
[1:46:44.700 --> 1:46:49.860]  is going to come out and start saying it like it is. These people, like, all right, perfect
[1:46:49.860 --> 1:46:58.860]  example, Obama. When he traded that guy's bird doll for four people in Guantanamo Bay,
[1:46:58.860 --> 1:47:02.060]  that was a felony. How come he wasn't indicted?
[1:47:02.060 --> 1:47:03.060]  Oh, yeah.
[1:47:03.060 --> 1:47:08.260]  He can't get indicted because he's president or something. And all the people that go along
[1:47:08.260 --> 1:47:12.940]  with it, isn't that conspiracy? If they go along with a crime, how come these people
[1:47:12.940 --> 1:47:20.060]  aren't? So I'm wondering why the people who supposedly thought we the people aren't coming
[1:47:20.060 --> 1:47:26.300]  out and saying these people should be indicted, held accountable, and if prison time is due
[1:47:26.300 --> 1:47:30.220]  after they get convicted, because they will be convicted. These people are just out of
[1:47:30.220 --> 1:47:31.220]  control.
[1:47:31.220 --> 1:47:36.140]  Well, the problem is, is that the Republicans, I don't believe, really want to constrain
[1:47:36.140 --> 1:47:40.500]  anybody's power because they just want to get the levers of power. That's the underlying
[1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:43.060]  problem with all of this, and that's the corruption.
[1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:47.340]  When you look at what just happened with the budget bill, when you look at the fact that
[1:47:47.340 --> 1:47:55.140]  they ran on shutting down Obamacare, on turning back Amnesty, which is not even an executive
[1:47:55.140 --> 1:48:00.300]  order. I mean, it was just a decree from Obama. We have, later on the week, we're going to
[1:48:00.300 --> 1:48:03.740]  have Jerome Corsi on again. We had him a couple of weeks ago when he looked at the
[1:48:03.740 --> 1:48:09.780]  actual record and saw that Obama never filed any order. He didn't sign anything. He signed
[1:48:09.780 --> 1:48:13.860]  a couple of orders in front of the press and said he was signing an Amnesty order, and
[1:48:13.860 --> 1:48:17.980]  yet he didn't. He didn't sign anything. He didn't file anything. He's just pronouncing
[1:48:17.980 --> 1:48:18.980]  it.
[1:48:18.980 --> 1:48:22.540]  And of course, the real issue here, what they're really trying to get out in front of people,
[1:48:22.540 --> 1:48:29.540]  is the message to people all over the world that anyone can come here and live off of
[1:48:29.540 --> 1:48:35.180]  the American state. That's the real message. They want to incentivize illegal, uncontrolled,
[1:48:35.180 --> 1:48:38.900]  open immigration. And it's a way to take this country down. And of course, the Republicans
[1:48:38.900 --> 1:48:43.300]  don't want to push back against that because the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and big business
[1:48:43.300 --> 1:48:49.300]  wants to have open borders. They want to have competition at the bottom end of the wage
[1:48:49.300 --> 1:48:50.300]  scale.
[1:48:50.300 --> 1:48:54.580]  So they're not going to do anything to prosecute this. There's issue after issue after issue.
[1:48:54.580 --> 1:49:00.820]  They could have taken Obama to court. They could have impeached him. They could have
[1:49:00.820 --> 1:49:04.700]  jailed people who were underneath him, but they don't prosecute any of these issues because
[1:49:04.700 --> 1:49:05.860]  they want to keep the power.
[1:49:05.860 --> 1:49:10.380]  Thank you so much, Tim. And Tennessee, let's go to Robin in Oklahoma. Robin.
[1:49:10.380 --> 1:49:11.380]  David?
[1:49:11.380 --> 1:49:12.380]  Yes.
[1:49:12.380 --> 1:49:19.380]  I just wanted to make a statement about the, uh, the assassin called abortionist in, in
[1:49:19.380 --> 1:49:20.380]  the More Acres, Oklahoma.
[1:49:20.380 --> 1:49:21.380]  Yes.
[1:49:21.380 --> 1:49:25.380]  There's a picture, there's a picture on the Facebook page of the abolitionist website,
[1:49:25.380 --> 1:49:32.860]  uh, the Facebook page that shows the exact same police officer arresting Nareesh Patel,
[1:49:32.860 --> 1:49:41.300]  the same one arrested, uh, pro-lifers abolitionist last year. So this, uh, lesser magistrate
[1:49:41.300 --> 1:49:46.180]  can be on both sides of the law. They were not breaking the law at all, but the same
[1:49:46.180 --> 1:49:50.020]  police, uh, police officer arrested both sides.
[1:49:50.020 --> 1:49:55.980]  Wow. Wow. So the picture that you see, uh, the, the, of course he's been arrested before.
[1:49:55.980 --> 1:50:00.860]  He's, uh, been charged, uh, several times and, uh, he keeps getting away with it, kind
[1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:04.740]  of like the CIA, doesn't he? It almost looks like they want that to happen.
[1:50:04.740 --> 1:50:09.340]  It's only when he wasn't killing babies is when he was arrested. This is what, this
[1:50:09.340 --> 1:50:11.380]  is what, this is where we are in our country.
[1:50:11.380 --> 1:50:16.500]  That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Very, very ironic, isn't it? But of course he was exposing the
[1:50:16.500 --> 1:50:23.140]  women there to something that was, uh, very dangerous. Uh, and they were not even pregnant,
[1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:26.900]  but he was telling them that they were pregnant and giving them RU 486. As we pointed out
[1:50:26.900 --> 1:50:32.020]  early in the show, that can cause hemorrhaging. It can be very dangerous. That's why we had
[1:50:32.020 --> 1:50:37.740]  the bill that was passed here in Texas that said, uh, that made qualifications for abortion
[1:50:37.740 --> 1:50:42.900]  clinics that they had to be able to handle complications. And there was a big kickback
[1:50:42.900 --> 1:50:46.260]  on that. It didn't work too well for Wendy Davis. That's what she based her entire political
[1:50:46.260 --> 1:50:50.700]  career on. And she was defeated by Greg Abbott. We're going to be right back taking your calls.

[1:52:17.380 --> 1:52:22.100]  through an asthmatic breathing type situation. My breathing is shallow and generally constricted
[1:52:22.100 --> 1:52:26.940]  in the nose and lungs. After consuming one raw weight today, I have tremendous energy
[1:52:26.940 --> 1:52:31.540]  and also notice my breathing is free. I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is
[1:52:31.540 --> 1:52:36.180]  free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[1:52:36.180 --> 1:52:41.020]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice. The only thing I've actually added

[1:54:12.900 --> 1:54:19.020]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight on this Monday, December 15, 2014. Paul
[1:54:19.020 --> 1:54:21.980]  Joseph Watson is going to be joining us in the next hour to talk about this development
[1:54:21.980 --> 1:54:27.820]  in Sydney. Australia, we had a captive situation there. Australian hostages have been freed
[1:54:27.820 --> 1:54:32.140]  there. He's going to update us on the details of that as well as looking at what's behind
[1:54:32.140 --> 1:54:37.220]  it. Reports have come out that the man responsible for taking Australian hostages is an Iranian
[1:54:37.220 --> 1:54:42.780]  mystic. That's an article up on Infowars.com from Kurt Nemo. He is not ISIS. He is not
[1:54:42.780 --> 1:54:47.860]  Al Nusrah. He's not Al Qaeda. But of course, it's going to be used for that, I believe.
[1:54:47.860 --> 1:54:53.500]  The former CIA chief says that ISIS will attack the U.S. soon. That's an article up
[1:54:53.500 --> 1:54:57.460]  by Kit Daniels on Infowars.com. So we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson in the next
[1:54:57.460 --> 1:55:04.060]  hour, get his take on what he believes happened there as well as how that is going to be used.
[1:55:04.060 --> 1:55:09.620]  But right now, we're taking your calls before he joins us. And let's go to John in Oklahoma.
[1:55:09.620 --> 1:55:14.700]  John, you want to talk about Australia. Go ahead. Yes, I do. First, let me ask, there
[1:55:14.700 --> 1:55:22.060]  was a news item last week on Tuesday, I think it was on the blaze about some mayor here
[1:55:22.060 --> 1:55:27.780]  in the United States. I didn't catch that early, first couple of sentences of his message
[1:55:27.780 --> 1:55:36.060]  that he believes that owning weapons is a mental illness. He sent out his police force door-to-door
[1:55:36.060 --> 1:55:42.020]  to houses and apartments asking the residents there if they had guns. And if so, would they
[1:55:42.020 --> 1:55:47.660]  please turn them in? Well, that's essentially what we heard from
[1:55:47.660 --> 1:55:54.860]  that deputy in Spokane, Washington, that they needed those MRAPs because they had constitutionalists
[1:55:54.860 --> 1:56:01.900]  out there with weapons and lots of ammunition. Australia. What's that? I lived down in Australia
[1:56:01.900 --> 1:56:07.540]  for a year, but that's been several years ago. I've been corresponding with a woman
[1:56:07.540 --> 1:56:15.860]  from 2009 until today. And she told me in 2009 they had a terrible drought down there.
[1:56:15.860 --> 1:56:24.460]  And at that time, there was a very suspected roaring fire, you know what I mean? A brush
[1:56:24.460 --> 1:56:27.900]  fire. Yes. The flames were four stories tall. They were
[1:56:27.900 --> 1:56:34.020]  traveling at 60 miles an hour. They burned out five towns just north of Melbourne, killing
[1:56:34.020 --> 1:56:41.220]  well over 200 Australians. They were looking for two Middle East men who were in that area
[1:56:41.220 --> 1:56:49.100]  prior to the fire breaking out. Those men later were seen leaving on aircraft out of
[1:56:49.100 --> 1:56:54.940]  the country under false passports that were provided by their embassies. And there were
[1:56:54.940 --> 1:57:00.900]  three more they were seeking and they think they disappeared by some ship that was brought
[1:57:00.900 --> 1:57:04.060]  to the coast and then took them away quietly that way.
[1:57:04.060 --> 1:57:08.420]  Well, that underscores why we always need to look carefully at any of these incidents
[1:57:08.420 --> 1:57:13.060]  to make sure that we're not being goaded into a war with somebody that is not really a threat
[1:57:13.060 --> 1:57:17.700]  to us because false flags, whether they're Reichstag fires or whether they're outback
[1:57:17.700 --> 1:57:23.420]  wildfires can always be used to pump up the population to go attack somebody else at
[1:57:23.420 --> 1:57:27.940]  the will that our government wants to go fight for whatever reason.
[1:57:27.940 --> 1:57:35.620]  You told me that there's a tremendous public backlash against allowing Middle East Muslims
[1:57:35.620 --> 1:57:41.500]  and these refugees from Indonesia coming in who are basically living off welfare with
[1:57:41.500 --> 1:57:50.220]  large families. And the Muslims are all campaigning to get a Sharia law parallel legal system
[1:57:50.220 --> 1:57:57.900]  for themselves, first in Perth in Western Australia and then later in Victoria and New
[1:57:57.900 --> 1:57:58.900]  South Wales.
[1:57:58.900 --> 1:58:02.580]  Well, that's what they're doing worldwide. That's what they're doing in Western Europe.
[1:58:02.580 --> 1:58:05.420]  That's what they're doing in North America. I'm not surprised to see them doing it in
[1:58:05.420 --> 1:58:10.460]  Australia. It's a divide and conquer strategy where they will bring in disparate groups
[1:58:10.460 --> 1:58:15.540]  that are going to compete against each other and then also utilize the welfare state in
[1:58:15.540 --> 1:58:21.460]  a clowered and pivot strategy. That was something that these political scientists put forth
[1:58:21.460 --> 1:58:25.180]  back in the 1960s saying we're going to set up an entitlement state and then we're going
[1:58:25.180 --> 1:58:28.740]  to flood it and collapse the economy. That's what they're looking for.
[1:58:28.740 --> 1:58:31.420]  Stay with us. We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson. We'll take a couple
[1:58:31.420 --> 1:58:40.820]  more of your calls in the first segment. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[1:58:40.820 --> 1:58:51.260]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[2:00:10.980 --> 2:00:19.460]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live
[2:00:19.460 --> 2:00:28.660]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David
[2:00:28.660 --> 2:00:35.100]  Knight on this Monday, December 15, 2014. We're going to be joining Paul Joseph Watson
[2:00:35.100 --> 2:00:39.540]  in the UK. He's going to be joining us. We're going to talk about what's going on in Sydney.
[2:00:39.540 --> 2:00:43.180]  We're now starting to get a little bit of information. I was just told that they're
[2:00:43.180 --> 2:00:47.820]  now saying that two hostages have died as well as the man who had taken them hostage.
[2:00:47.820 --> 2:00:53.100]  How is that going to be used? What is that going to mean for Australia for all of us?
[2:00:53.100 --> 2:00:59.580]  Is that going to be an example to take us to war in the Middle East so that we can shut
[2:00:59.580 --> 2:01:07.540]  down ISIS? Yet we see that this guy has no connections to ISIS or al-Nusrah. Nevertheless,
[2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:13.220]  our former CIA director, Morrill, says that the terrorist attack in the U.S. is guaranteed.
[2:01:13.220 --> 2:01:18.060]  He says ISIS has had a focus on Australia for some time. So by innuendo, they can make
[2:01:18.060 --> 2:01:21.780]  this connection. They can try to drive us to war. So we're going to talk to Paul Joseph
[2:01:21.780 --> 2:01:27.820]  Watson as to what's behind this and, of course, what's ahead of us in terms of this attack.
[2:01:27.820 --> 2:01:30.860]  How is it going to be used? Right now, in this segment, though, I wanted to take your
[2:01:30.860 --> 2:01:36.580]  calls. I wanted to go to Darrell in Kansas. We also had the story that broke last Friday
[2:01:36.580 --> 2:01:40.660]  that we talked about through the weekend about the Spokane Washington officer, the
[2:01:40.660 --> 2:01:45.660]  sheriff's deputy, who was talking about his MRAP and how, when questioned why he needed
[2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:50.620]  this kind of capability, he said, well, we have all these constitutionalists in the area.
[2:01:50.620 --> 2:01:55.260]  Darrell in Kansas says he called the Spokane Washington Police Department. Darrell, what
[2:01:55.260 --> 2:02:00.660]  did they tell you? I'm looking at their website right now and it says they're hiring. Hello?
[2:02:00.660 --> 2:02:08.180]  Yes, go ahead. Yeah, it says they're hiring. I'm looking at their website. Yes, I did call
[2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:13.180]  and the woman thought it was very laughable. I wish I would have free courted it to put
[2:02:13.180 --> 2:02:19.260]  it on the internet, but I ask her, why is that guy not like constitutionalist? Didn't
[2:02:19.260 --> 2:02:23.260]  he take an oath to uphold the Constitution? And she's all, I don't know what oath they
[2:02:23.260 --> 2:02:29.220]  take. I haven't been to any of the ceremonies. And she was very much like I was bothering
[2:02:29.220 --> 2:02:34.220]  and laughed. And I'd like to say you do a great job, Paul Joseph Watson. Love him. You
[2:02:34.220 --> 2:02:38.260]  guys. Well, you know, that's just it. They don't really pay any attention to what they
[2:02:38.260 --> 2:02:42.180]  pledged to. They don't pay any attention to the Constitution. They don't take it seriously
[2:02:42.180 --> 2:02:48.100]  enough to really look at what they're pledging to. But of course, we have to take it seriously
[2:02:48.100 --> 2:02:53.020]  and we have to understand that anything that the government does that is not in alignment
[2:02:53.020 --> 2:02:59.380]  with the Constitution is not legitimate because that is the supreme law of the land. That
[2:02:59.380 --> 2:03:05.620]  is the king. These guys are merely stewards put in place to serve that higher principle,
[2:03:05.620 --> 2:03:08.660]  that law that is king. That was a principle that they established during the American
[2:03:08.660 --> 2:03:14.300]  Revolution. They said Lex Rex, in other words, the law is king. And if they don't understand
[2:03:14.300 --> 2:03:19.340]  that, that's why and they don't. That is the heart of all of our issues. And I would, I
[2:03:19.340 --> 2:03:24.580]  would brought it out a little bit to this as well. I think the fundamental problem with
[2:03:24.580 --> 2:03:29.020]  so many Christians who don't understand Romans 13 is the same thing. They don't understand
[2:03:29.020 --> 2:03:36.140]  that when the government is not aligned under the principles of God, then that government
[2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:41.260]  is no longer legitimate. In the same way that when the police or various other aspects of
[2:03:41.260 --> 2:03:46.020]  the government are not aligned in the Constitution, they are no longer legitimate. That's the
[2:03:46.020 --> 2:03:53.020]  fundamental issue here. They're not operating as a legitimate government when they deny
[2:03:53.020 --> 2:03:56.220]  the ultimate authority that they have for governing. That's why they take an oath to
[2:03:56.220 --> 2:04:00.100]  the Constitution. Thank you so much, Darryl. Let's go to Michael in South Carolina. Michael.
[2:04:00.100 --> 2:04:04.580]  Hi, David. Oh, yes. I guess it's Michelle then, right?
[2:04:04.580 --> 2:04:11.980]  I had my ear plugged in. My first real quick comment was I was born and raised in Spokane
[2:04:11.980 --> 2:04:17.100]  and I've only been gone for about five years. And I'm really shocked that the police department
[2:04:17.100 --> 2:04:23.580]  has gone down hill so terribly in the shortest time because the cops seriously weren't like
[2:04:23.580 --> 2:04:29.180]  that, you know, five, ten years ago. Oh, absolutely. We've seen a massive and rapid
[2:04:29.180 --> 2:04:33.500]  change. And where do you think that's coming from? That's coming from Washington. It's
[2:04:33.500 --> 2:04:37.460]  the way they're being trained. Just recently, as we're talking about what was going on
[2:04:37.460 --> 2:04:42.260]  in New Mexico, there was a fellow teaching at the police academy, the state police academy.
[2:04:42.260 --> 2:04:45.820]  And he says, I refuse to teach this chute first curriculum. He's somebody who'd been
[2:04:45.820 --> 2:04:51.780]  teaching at the police academy for a long time. It's different. They're setting up different
[2:04:51.780 --> 2:04:54.740]  rules for the police. And we need to be very concerned about that. Stay with us. We're
[2:04:54.740 --> 2:04:58.100]  going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK to talk about what happened in
[2:04:58.100 --> 2:05:03.540]  Sydney. As the year is coming to a close, we all pause
[2:05:03.540 --> 2:05:08.420]  to reflect on what's happened in the past year. We take a step back and thank God for
[2:05:08.420 --> 2:05:11.940]  what we have. I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset

[2:08:25.780 --> 2:08:33.180]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight on this Monday, December 15,
[2:08:33.180 --> 2:08:36.820]  2014. We're going to be going to Paul Joseph Watson in the U.K. He's going to update us
[2:08:36.820 --> 2:08:41.900]  on the situation in Sydney. What's behind it, how they're going to use it. Before we
[2:08:41.900 --> 2:08:46.180]  go to him though, I want to let you know this is the first time we've ever had a sale for

[2:09:18.740 --> 2:09:22.940]  Now going to Paul. Paul, before we start talking about Sydney, I just wanted to let you know
[2:09:22.940 --> 2:09:27.540]  and get your comments on it. We've had an update to this story out of Washington, Spokane
[2:09:27.540 --> 2:09:32.660]  where Mikhail is putting an update on his story. He actually did finally get a comment
[2:09:32.660 --> 2:09:37.180]  from the police department there and they said they thought that for us to put this
[2:09:37.180 --> 2:09:42.740]  up and say that this officer had a problem with constitutionalists was a cheap shot that
[2:09:42.740 --> 2:09:46.100]  was taken out of context. So I would invite people to take a look at that video and see
[2:09:46.100 --> 2:09:51.580]  if you think it's out of context. The context was the lady asked this sheriff's deputy
[2:09:51.580 --> 2:09:56.580]  after he was bragging about the capabilities of his new MRAP, why would you need that?
[2:09:56.580 --> 2:09:59.780]  And he goes into detail talking about how well we need it because of constitutionalists
[2:09:59.780 --> 2:10:04.620]  and these people who have a lot of ammunition. I don't see that that's taken out of context.
[2:10:04.620 --> 2:10:08.340]  I don't think that's a cheap shot. I think the cheap shot is coming out of Homeland
[2:10:08.340 --> 2:10:15.380]  Security and the FBI demonizing anybody that might be political opposition to an authoritarian
[2:10:15.380 --> 2:10:18.140]  police state. Paul, what's your comment on that?
[2:10:18.140 --> 2:10:23.780]  Well, I mean, exactly as you said, if you watch the clip, his comments, you know, they
[2:10:23.780 --> 2:10:28.580]  hang on themselves. This is clearly not out of context. It is part of this underlying
[2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:33.220]  trend. I mean, I've written stories over the past few months about how they're purchasing
[2:10:33.220 --> 2:10:38.660]  these armored vehicles for, quote, war on veterans. That was one of the headlines that
[2:10:38.660 --> 2:10:44.500]  was used in a local news story about the issue. So there's definitely an issue with them
[2:10:44.500 --> 2:10:50.460]  militarizing not only against Occupy protesters. We know that was a justification for the purchase
[2:10:50.460 --> 2:10:56.500]  of the Bearcat armored tank in New Hampshire to use against both Occupy and so-called sovereign
[2:10:56.500 --> 2:11:01.700]  citizens that came out in the public meetings. And as I said, many news reports saying that
[2:11:01.700 --> 2:11:06.460]  this is part of the war on veterans. They're saying that veterans are all mentally unstable
[2:11:06.460 --> 2:11:11.740]  waiting to explode IEDs all over the country. And it's definitely an underlying trend. So
[2:11:11.740 --> 2:11:16.060]  it's not taken out of context whatsoever. It's in contact with what we've seen for years
[2:11:16.060 --> 2:11:17.820]  out of the DHS, as he said.
[2:11:17.820 --> 2:11:21.900]  Yeah, we see that in their trading scenarios. We had that one training scenario that was
[2:11:21.900 --> 2:11:26.860]  put out there in South Carolina where I think they had the Tea Party aligning with Muslims
[2:11:26.860 --> 2:11:32.220]  and they had to come in and put that down. I mean, it's just amazing the absurd scenarios
[2:11:32.220 --> 2:11:36.140]  that they're coming up with, but they're feeding these scenarios to the police. And obviously,
[2:11:36.140 --> 2:11:41.260]  the police are buying it without question to think that your enemy is somebody who is
[2:11:41.260 --> 2:11:46.100]  a constitutionalist when you're supposed to swear allegiance to the Constitution as
[2:11:46.100 --> 2:11:52.060]  the highest law on the land. And as we have just been talking about it to one of the callers
[2:11:52.060 --> 2:11:56.340]  who called in here and he called the police department in Washington and they essentially
[2:11:56.340 --> 2:12:00.260]  laughed at him about that when he asked why they would move against constitutionalists.
[2:12:00.260 --> 2:12:07.020]  Exactly. I mean, I wrote an article probably about a year ago now where this was an academic
[2:12:07.020 --> 2:12:13.100]  paper written by a top military official. Just Google Tea Party Insurrectionist Info
[2:12:13.100 --> 2:12:18.820]  Wars. And in that, they detailed a plot where Tea Party Insurrectionists would take over
[2:12:18.820 --> 2:12:22.180]  the city and they would have to use military force to repel them.
[2:12:22.180 --> 2:12:23.180]  That's right.
[2:12:23.180 --> 2:12:27.180]  I mean, in their own academic documents, in their own training programs, it's out there
[2:12:27.180 --> 2:12:31.580]  for anybody to see. And it's definitely one of the factors behind this militarization
[2:12:31.580 --> 2:12:32.580]  of police.
[2:12:32.580 --> 2:12:37.140]  It's not something that's new. Alex has had this in his documentaries a decade ago.
[2:12:37.140 --> 2:12:42.420]  But what we're seeing here is that it's now been taught long enough and broadly enough
[2:12:42.420 --> 2:12:49.940]  that we're actually seeing them confess to this and we're seeing them act upon this worldview
[2:12:49.940 --> 2:12:55.540]  that they've been taught. That's what's different about it in the last year or two.
[2:12:55.540 --> 2:12:59.060]  Exactly. Again, look at media narratives as we're going to talk about with this Sydney
[2:12:59.060 --> 2:13:05.340]  situation. The media pushes this notion that veterans are out there waiting to explode.
[2:13:05.340 --> 2:13:10.540]  They don't actually analyze the issues behind why veterans are getting PTSD in the first
[2:13:10.540 --> 2:13:15.260]  place, why they're committing suicide en masse. It's just this is the threat. We need to deal
[2:13:15.260 --> 2:13:21.220]  with it and it's to justify this armored buildup, which again, is about them escalating a situation
[2:13:21.220 --> 2:13:25.060]  which the studies clearly show only causes more violence.
[2:13:25.060 --> 2:13:30.060]  So I mean, across the board, watch the video for yourself. Those comments are pretty clear.
[2:13:30.060 --> 2:13:31.820]  They're not taken out of context.
[2:13:31.820 --> 2:13:35.660]  Absolutely. Now, you mentioned the Sydney thing. I wanted to get you to bring us up
[2:13:35.660 --> 2:13:38.740]  to speed as to what the latest developments are. What have you heard about what's going
[2:13:38.740 --> 2:13:42.900]  on with Sydney? And then let's talk after that about what's behind it. What have you
[2:13:42.900 --> 2:13:47.740]  heard in terms of last I heard it look like they're now announcing that two hostages have
[2:13:47.740 --> 2:13:49.260]  been killed. Is that correct?
[2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:55.460]  Yeah, but it was over as of a few hours ago. They're saying that three are dead, including
[2:13:55.460 --> 2:14:00.340]  the gunman. So that suggests two hostages, maybe a police officer died. It's not being
[2:14:00.340 --> 2:14:05.780]  confirmed yet. The siege is now over. What I found interesting was, and this is what
[2:14:05.780 --> 2:14:11.460]  I study every single day is media narratives. Because in the past year or so, there seems
[2:14:11.460 --> 2:14:17.860]  to have been this shift in media narrative, not to blame so-called lone wolf terror attacks
[2:14:17.860 --> 2:14:26.260]  on extremist Islamist ideology. You saw it in Canada recently with the Canadian Parliament
[2:14:26.260 --> 2:14:30.820]  attack, another attack in Canada when two Canadian soldiers were run over. You saw it
[2:14:30.820 --> 2:14:36.780]  with the New York incident where somebody attacked police officers with an axe. And
[2:14:36.780 --> 2:14:42.220]  you see it in this Sydney incident. In every single incident, there is clearly extremist
[2:14:42.220 --> 2:14:47.300]  Islamist political motivation, whether you believe these people are actually ISIS members
[2:14:47.300 --> 2:14:52.500]  or not. More likely they're just ISIS inspired. But this angle, even though it's clearly
[2:14:52.500 --> 2:14:59.620]  there, is now being kind of buried by the mainstream media. And I think that's mainly
[2:14:59.620 --> 2:15:05.420]  related to the fact that the growth of ISIS in the first place was almost entirely as
[2:15:05.420 --> 2:15:12.300]  a result of the US government destabilizing Syria. The US government's allies, Qatar,
[2:15:12.300 --> 2:15:18.620]  Jordan, Saudi Arabia, funding an arming ISIS to begin with. Now we have people from all
[2:15:18.620 --> 2:15:25.100]  over Europe, young men flying over to Syria and Iraq to fight on behalf of ISIS. We have
[2:15:25.100 --> 2:15:31.060]  the so-called moderate rebels in Syria, which were never moderate to begin with, even when
[2:15:31.060 --> 2:15:36.700]  the CFR said back in 2012, let's basically support Al Qaeda. We now see that the arms
[2:15:36.700 --> 2:15:42.780]  that we gave them are crossing over into ISIS hands. So when these actual organic attacks
[2:15:42.780 --> 2:15:48.300]  happen, ones that aren't provocative by the authorities as they have been in the past,
[2:15:48.300 --> 2:15:53.860]  we're now kind of seeing the media bury the extremist political motivation behind them
[2:15:53.860 --> 2:15:59.180]  because there's a sense that they need to distract from the fact that this is partially
[2:15:59.180 --> 2:16:03.980]  caused by blowback as a result of Western foreign policy. And we're seeing it again
[2:16:03.980 --> 2:16:06.260]  in what happened with the Sydney siege.
[2:16:06.260 --> 2:16:10.260]  Except that on the other side too, we have this article up by Kit Daniels where we've
[2:16:10.260 --> 2:16:17.620]  got a former CIA chief saying that ISIS is going to attack the US soon. He says, sometime
[2:16:17.620 --> 2:16:22.380]  over the next year or so, guaranteed. So I mean, it looks like they're at the same time
[2:16:22.380 --> 2:16:26.500]  they want to be politically correct and they want to distance themselves from this monster
[2:16:26.500 --> 2:16:30.980]  that they've created. On the other hand, I think they're more than capable of using
[2:16:30.980 --> 2:16:36.020]  that to justify yet another new war abroad, don't you?
[2:16:36.020 --> 2:16:41.660]  Yeah, and that's definitely an issue. But what I've noticed is obviously immediately
[2:16:41.660 --> 2:16:45.900]  after 9-11, any kind of attack whatsoever, they would immediately jump on the Islamist
[2:16:45.900 --> 2:16:51.380]  angle, push the hysterics to grease the skids for war and military intervention. It seems
[2:16:51.380 --> 2:16:57.300]  they flip the opposite way. I mean, take this Sydney siege, for example. Now the media narrative,
[2:16:57.300 --> 2:17:02.620]  now that this has ended, is that basically this guy was alone not a criminal and that
[2:17:02.620 --> 2:17:08.300]  he was not politically motivated, that he was out on bail for being an accessory to
[2:17:08.300 --> 2:17:13.700]  murder, other charges related to sexual offences. And they're now steering the narrative as
[2:17:13.700 --> 2:17:20.220]  to that was his motivation behind taking these dozens of hostages. But if you actually followed
[2:17:20.220 --> 2:17:26.500]  the story from the beginning, what evidence came out during the siege was completely ignored
[2:17:26.500 --> 2:17:32.260]  by the media and in fact censored in some cases. There were videos made by the hostages
[2:17:32.260 --> 2:17:39.620]  inside the cafe in Sydney where they said, the hostage takers told us to tell the world
[2:17:39.620 --> 2:17:44.340]  this is an ISIS attack and that the media is covering up the fact that it's an ISIS
[2:17:44.340 --> 2:17:52.540]  attack. We also know that the hostage taker demanded an ISIS flag. We later saw a generic
[2:17:52.540 --> 2:17:59.500]  Islamic flag displayed in the cafe window. We had a Facebook post from one of the hostages
[2:17:59.500 --> 2:18:04.660]  who said the man wants the world to know Australia is under attack by the Islamic State. Now even
[2:18:04.660 --> 2:18:09.700]  if this guy is not a member of ISIS, which you know, he almost certainly isn't, this
[2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:16.260]  is obviously inspired by ISIS. But the media is completely buried that some of them don't
[2:18:16.260 --> 2:18:22.220]  even mention the fact they agreed not to broadcast any of this information at the time. And even
[2:18:22.220 --> 2:18:28.060]  after the siege is now over, YouTube and Facebook are still deleting all these videos where
[2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:33.220]  these hostages say this guy says he's a member of ISIS and that this is an ISIS attack on
[2:18:33.220 --> 2:18:39.140]  Australia. But very quickly in the aftermath, we saw the media take this route where they
[2:18:39.140 --> 2:18:45.180]  buried that narrative and began to focus almost entirely on him being a lone figure and that
[2:18:45.180 --> 2:18:51.140]  he was just a criminal motivated by his own personal problems. So this is a general trend
[2:18:51.140 --> 2:18:55.700]  that I've seen over the past year or so. And it relates to the fact that there are these
[2:18:55.700 --> 2:19:00.620]  individuals out there. We had reports on the southern border from police officials, respected
[2:19:00.620 --> 2:19:05.780]  officials saying that ISIS was active on the southern border just across there in Mexico.
[2:19:05.780 --> 2:19:11.060]  The DHS vehemently denied that over and over again. So this ties into that general trend
[2:19:11.060 --> 2:19:16.140]  of them downplaying Islamist extremist ideology linked to these lone wolf attacks because
[2:19:16.140 --> 2:19:19.300]  at the moment it doesn't fit their broader narrative.
[2:19:19.300 --> 2:19:23.580]  I think that's the key. At the moment, it doesn't fit their broader narrative because
[2:19:23.580 --> 2:19:29.100]  we saw back in 2013, they were doing everything they could to try to start a war with Syria
[2:19:29.100 --> 2:19:35.740]  and using these same people. And now after they've gotten Muslims abroad like this guy,
[2:19:35.740 --> 2:19:41.980]  who basically is he could be a lone, lone actor who is is fired up about this, but clearly
[2:19:41.980 --> 2:19:47.380]  he is motivated by his Islamist attitudes with the signs and the flags that he put
[2:19:47.380 --> 2:20:15.140]  up there. We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson. Stay with us.

[2:23:57.820 --> 2:24:19.180]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host today. Joining me
[2:24:19.180 --> 2:24:26.300]  from the U.K. is Paul Joseph Watson. We've been talking about the attack in Sydney. What's
[2:24:26.300 --> 2:24:30.980]  behind it? How is it being spun? We're going to go back to Paul Joseph Watson, but we're
[2:24:30.980 --> 2:24:34.300]  going to also take your calls beginning the next segment if you would like to weigh in
[2:24:34.300 --> 2:24:38.260]  and tell us what you think is behind it. As Paul has pointed out, it's kind of strange
[2:24:38.260 --> 2:24:45.100]  that as they were trying to ramp up a war in Syria, yet these most recent lone wolf
[2:24:45.100 --> 2:24:48.540]  attacks as they're being portrayed by the media, the media has changed the narrative,
[2:24:48.540 --> 2:24:54.100]  not trying to tie these Islamist attacks in Canada and Australia, not trying to tie those
[2:24:54.100 --> 2:25:00.100]  to a broader agenda just yet. But of course, we do see the CIA saying sometime this year
[2:25:00.100 --> 2:25:06.980]  we can expect to guarantee. We'll see some kind of an ISIS attack in America. Now that
[2:25:06.980 --> 2:25:16.060]  number, if you want to call in, is 800-259-9231. That's 800-259-9231. Paul, going back to what
[2:25:16.060 --> 2:25:18.780]  you were talking about, I mean, it looks like they're deliberately trying to keep a lid
[2:25:18.780 --> 2:25:26.060]  on this, trying to make this about a single shooter. Do you think they're trying to keep
[2:25:26.060 --> 2:25:31.380]  everything quiet until they've got more neocons sworn in from the recent election? What do
[2:25:31.380 --> 2:25:37.700]  you think is behind all this? I think they're doing it for a number of reasons. One of them
[2:25:37.700 --> 2:25:43.740]  is cultural sensitivity. I mean, there was a story which came out as this was developing
[2:25:43.740 --> 2:25:51.180]  this viral hashtag campaign, I'll ride with you. There was a woman on a train or a bus
[2:25:51.180 --> 2:25:57.460]  in Sydney or in Australia who took off her hijab headscarf because she feared some kind
[2:25:57.460 --> 2:26:03.100]  of retribution from other Australians who would verbally or physically abuse her because
[2:26:03.100 --> 2:26:07.440]  of what was taking place in this cafe in Sydney. There were no actual reports of violence
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:13.620]  directed against Muslims as a result of this. So one of the other commuters said I'll walk
[2:26:13.620 --> 2:26:20.740]  with you and it turned into this huge international hashtag campaign. And as one person tweeted
[2:26:20.740 --> 2:26:27.180]  who I retweeted, it cynically shifts the narrative of the Sydney siege away from violent Muslims
[2:26:27.180 --> 2:26:33.340]  by casting non-Muslims as the real danger. And that went on to completely dominate the
[2:26:33.340 --> 2:26:38.260]  narrative. And then you had the Sydney morning Herald coming out and even suggesting that
[2:26:38.260 --> 2:26:43.860]  Australians should have, quote, empathy for the terrorists. They said, how should we feel
[2:26:43.860 --> 2:26:50.380]  for the perpetrator and his family? So there was this kind of odd cultural sensitivity
[2:26:50.380 --> 2:26:55.860]  going on, not so much sympathy focused on the actual hostages being terrorized inside
[2:26:55.860 --> 2:27:02.900]  the cafe, but a kind of deflection to blame Australians for Islamophobia that wasn't actually
[2:27:02.900 --> 2:27:08.340]  taking place. So that was another weird little element to this.
[2:27:08.340 --> 2:27:12.340]  There's been a lot of complaints in Australia. People were concerned and angry about the
[2:27:12.340 --> 2:27:19.340]  fact that Muslim women can wear hijab in public, but nobody else can cover their face. They
[2:27:19.340 --> 2:27:23.460]  even had some protesters show up at the Capitol there, I think. One of them was wearing a
[2:27:23.460 --> 2:27:29.380]  Ku Klux Klan hood and they made him take it off and underneath it he had a Muslim hijab
[2:27:29.380 --> 2:27:34.020]  on it. So it's like, that's fine. I think maybe we ought all be able to wear masks if
[2:27:34.020 --> 2:27:38.980]  we want to with the surveillance state. But to let one group have it and not to let others
[2:27:38.980 --> 2:27:42.620]  have it, that was the issue. I think that was a sticking point. But yeah, it is very
[2:27:42.620 --> 2:27:45.380]  much a political correctness that's going on, isn't it?
[2:27:45.380 --> 2:27:50.940]  Yeah. And it reminds me of that story last week where the cop in Tennessee pulled over
[2:27:50.940 --> 2:27:56.900]  Saudi Arabians who had paper tags on their car. They said they had a dead baby in the
[2:27:56.900 --> 2:28:02.460]  trunk of the car and he basically let them go. No questions asked. They were on their
[2:28:02.460 --> 2:28:07.300]  way because of cultural sensitivity. I never tried that when I got pulled over by the cops.
[2:28:07.300 --> 2:28:11.180]  I'm sorry. I said I'd never tried that when I got pulled over the cops, but I guess it
[2:28:11.180 --> 2:28:17.580]  wouldn't work for me. Yeah. And he was, he was praised by the police chief and this
[2:28:17.580 --> 2:28:23.180]  Islamic scholar that they consulted for the story when obviously it doesn't matter what
[2:28:23.180 --> 2:28:27.580]  cultural sensitivity is in the background. It's a potential crime. You need to check
[2:28:27.580 --> 2:28:32.820]  it out. Police officers smell weed in somebody's car. They send them to jail. We've heard stories
[2:28:32.820 --> 2:28:37.940]  about that over and over again. So there is, there is that element to it. I mean, the FBI
[2:28:37.940 --> 2:28:42.460]  crime stats which have just come out for last year are interesting because they show that
[2:28:42.460 --> 2:28:48.140]  Jews in America are four times more likely to be the victims of hate crimes than Muslims
[2:28:48.140 --> 2:28:54.700]  and those crimes are less likely to be investigated. That's not neocon Zionist propaganda. It's
[2:28:54.700 --> 2:29:01.580]  FBI crime statistics. So it suggests that this Islamophobia thing again is being whipped
[2:29:01.580 --> 2:29:06.740]  up and generated by certain elements of the media for their own agenda and it's not actually
[2:29:06.740 --> 2:29:12.620]  a major problem in the West. But in the media aftermath of this Sydney siege, the main concern
[2:29:12.620 --> 2:29:16.900]  among many Australians and this was the top trending hashtag on Twitter above anything
[2:29:16.900 --> 2:29:22.660]  else was that Muslims on public transport might get some retribution. There was, there
[2:29:22.660 --> 2:29:27.540]  was a sporadic report about some verbal abuse, but nothing really whatsoever. And that became
[2:29:27.540 --> 2:29:29.220]  the main focus of the whole story.
[2:29:29.220 --> 2:29:33.940]  And what really happened here is we got to go to a break. But, but what really happened
[2:29:33.940 --> 2:29:38.860]  here is that you had the Australian government for whatever reason failed to protect the
[2:29:38.860 --> 2:29:44.140]  people from a guy who was clearly violent and crazy with his long rap sheet. We're gonna
[2:29:44.140 --> 2:29:48.580]  be right back with Paul Joseph Watson and we'll take your calls and comments. Stay with

[2:34:26.740 --> 2:34:33.460]  hey mr night and hey mr watson um i had a comment about torture um and and um some
[2:34:33.460 --> 2:34:39.380]  comments about the police state here in uh west virginia um my first comment about torture is
[2:34:40.020 --> 2:34:45.460]  two wrongs don't make a right but i guess under under this establishment and under common core
[2:34:45.460 --> 2:34:52.260]  that two wrongs do make a right um and about the police state in in west virginia um i called the
[2:34:52.260 --> 2:34:57.300]  west virginia state police and the martinsburg city police which is in berkeley county in the
[2:34:57.300 --> 2:35:02.500]  eastern part east eastern panhandle of west virginia um when i called the state police of west
[2:35:02.500 --> 2:35:08.500]  virginia and asked them about the mrab vehicles uh the lady on the line told me that it was for
[2:35:09.220 --> 2:35:15.300]  uh finding marijuana in the um in the woods west virginia and of course you know i had to laugh
[2:35:15.300 --> 2:35:20.980]  and was like come on lady this is absolutely absurd and when i called the um martinsburg
[2:35:20.980 --> 2:35:27.860]  city state or martinsburg city police um i asked them the same question at first i asked to speak
[2:35:27.860 --> 2:35:32.420]  to a public information officer and they didn't know what that was but finally was able to
[2:35:32.420 --> 2:35:38.260]  talk to somebody and the guy told me um the officer that came on the line told me
[2:35:38.260 --> 2:35:43.300]  that it was none of my business where how they get their tactical gear and how they apply their
[2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:49.380]  tactical gear and that if i call back again that i would be subject to arrest and they also said
[2:35:49.380 --> 2:35:55.380]  mr bowman if we see you and martinsburg they you might want to be careful i'm like wow that blew
[2:35:55.380 --> 2:36:00.100]  my mind that they would tell me that yes under your business because they don't work for you
[2:36:00.100 --> 2:36:05.860]  you because they don't care about the constitution evidently based on this person's comments in
[2:36:05.860 --> 2:36:13.300]  washington and as paul pointed out we've seen this over and over and over again going back to 2009
[2:36:13.300 --> 2:36:17.940]  if you want the mayac report that came out of the fusion center but even before that alex jones was
[2:36:17.940 --> 2:36:22.740]  doing uh documentaries back in the late 90s talking about the police state how that was
[2:36:22.740 --> 2:36:27.460]  being encouraged but of course it has accelerated it's gotten deeper it's gotten broader and it's
[2:36:27.460 --> 2:36:32.580]  all coming out of washington paul you want to comment on that yeah i just find it funny the
[2:36:32.580 --> 2:36:39.060]  notion that smoking marijuana would make somebody more likely to be violent requiring an armored
[2:36:39.060 --> 2:36:43.860]  vehicle response if you've ever been around people who smoke marijuana and it's the reason
[2:36:43.860 --> 2:36:49.300]  i don't smoke it is because it turns them into sedated zombies alcohol makes people more violent
[2:36:49.300 --> 2:36:54.180]  but obviously they can't use that as a justification so it's just bizarre and along those lines paul
[2:36:54.180 --> 2:36:59.380]  there was a story out today ahead of my stack here uh from truth theory dot com they point out
[2:36:59.380 --> 2:37:06.260]  that marijuana decreases death rates from painkillers by over 30 percent uh it's very very
[2:37:06.260 --> 2:37:12.660]  effective in terms of people who have or under a great deal of pain uh for marijuana for cancer
[2:37:12.660 --> 2:37:18.020]  and uh they point out that it allows people to avoid these very dangerous prescription drugs
[2:37:18.020 --> 2:37:25.220]  that not only kill people but basically affect you psychologically to make it so that you kill
[2:37:25.220 --> 2:37:30.260]  other people a lot of the typically all these shooters that we've seen have been involved in
[2:37:30.260 --> 2:37:36.820]  one way the other with uh pharmaceutical drugs that affect your mental state in a very uh adverse
[2:37:36.820 --> 2:37:42.660]  way they make you very violent very paranoid and as you point out paul marijuana does not do that
[2:37:42.660 --> 2:37:48.900]  at all instead it allows people to avoid these dangerous drugs but uh we still see a huge push
[2:37:48.900 --> 2:37:53.940]  back in terms of even allowing people to have it for medical uses that i think is the saddest thing
[2:37:53.940 --> 2:37:58.660]  i mean it you know recreational stuff prohibition doesn't work we've proven that with alcohol but
[2:37:59.220 --> 2:38:05.620]  we know that there's a lot of beneficial uses for marijuana for medical patients for glaucoma for
[2:38:05.620 --> 2:38:11.780]  increasing the appetite of people who uh are suffering from cancer and chemotherapy hiv treatment
[2:38:11.780 --> 2:38:16.980]  we understand that it's not a question why wouldn't we allow people to have access to that i think
[2:38:16.980 --> 2:38:22.500]  it's one of the most insane things about our society yeah and from the financial perspective
[2:38:22.500 --> 2:38:27.540]  i mean look what it's done for the economy of colorado there are only benefits all around so
[2:38:27.540 --> 2:38:32.900]  it makes no sense to continue that policy and i think gradually now that's being overturned which
[2:38:32.900 --> 2:38:37.380]  is the good news but of course we go the other way and we also say that hemp even though it has
[2:38:37.380 --> 2:38:43.620]  absolutely no hallucinogens hemp is also banned and so we can't have hemp for uh substitutions
[2:38:43.620 --> 2:38:48.660]  for cotton and that's where they end of course that's the issue it's a competition to people who
[2:38:48.660 --> 2:38:54.740]  have vested interests in washington so that's a large part of why hemp as well as banned let's go
[2:38:54.740 --> 2:39:05.540]  to uh bill in oklahoma bill go ahead okay let's go to uh john in washington go ahead john um hello guys
[2:39:05.540 --> 2:39:14.340]  this is uh uh a fellow who lived in uh spokane washington um i am personally acquainted with
[2:39:14.340 --> 2:39:20.820]  paul paul you'll know who i am after you listened for a second but um i operated a large informational
[2:39:20.820 --> 2:39:28.260]  website in spokane and i lived there and it got so bad uh with surveillance and harassment that i moved
[2:39:28.260 --> 2:39:37.540]  to a neighboring county i live about 14 miles off the paved road and twice out here in recent history
[2:39:37.540 --> 2:39:44.740]  i have seen bear cats on the dirt road right at sundown patrolling and they were not the same model
[2:39:44.740 --> 2:39:52.820]  they were two different ones so spokane has a multi-jurisdictional terrorism task force
[2:39:52.820 --> 2:40:01.540]  headed up by darin diru and his wife is the is the um public relations officer for the city of
[2:40:01.540 --> 2:40:09.220]  spokane police department and ozzy knesovich is the sheriff there i've seen him numerous times
[2:40:09.220 --> 2:40:14.900]  stand on the stage with sheriff mack at the liberty and freedom rallies that we have here
[2:40:14.900 --> 2:40:20.820]  occasionally which by the way the audience is completely full of feds when we have those
[2:40:20.820 --> 2:40:26.100]  and stand up there in ballet who the constitution yet he'll line up for all of this boot look and
[2:40:26.100 --> 2:40:35.060]  he'll do exactly anything that the federal uh uh uh police tell him to do and and i can tell you
[2:40:35.060 --> 2:40:45.780]  for a fact i was in an adjacent county minding my own business 1045 one night in the year 2005
[2:40:45.780 --> 2:40:52.580]  and on a telephone call from from spokane county to stevens county the stevens county sheriff who
[2:40:52.580 --> 2:40:58.740]  was craig there picked me up at my home transported me across county lines turned me over to the
[2:40:58.740 --> 2:41:04.500]  spokane county sheriff's department who gulagged me for over a week without getting to see a
[2:41:04.500 --> 2:41:12.660]  magistrate with absolutely no telephone call whatsoever i lost 36 000 in construction contracts
[2:41:12.660 --> 2:41:19.620]  because of it and nobody knew where i was and my dogs were locked in the house with no food so i
[2:41:19.620 --> 2:41:26.580]  can tell you for a fact that spokane county not only handles spokane county like a commissar
[2:41:26.580 --> 2:41:33.380]  they actually dictate to stevens county uh ponderay county fairy county all of the adjacent
[2:41:33.380 --> 2:41:40.340]  counties lincoln county whatever spokane says they will do it this that's very interesting john
[2:41:40.340 --> 2:41:45.300]  because of the comments that we finally got from the spokane police department where they said that
[2:41:45.300 --> 2:41:52.020]  those comments were taken out of context and that it was essentially a cheap shot no really you can
[2:41:52.020 --> 2:41:57.860]  look at that clip go to the article that we got up on info wars dot com you can see the short clip
[2:41:57.860 --> 2:42:03.060]  for yourself you can see that it's not out of context we should play that again guys you can
[2:42:03.060 --> 2:42:08.580]  see that that clip is not out of context and of course the bigger context is that this is going on
[2:42:08.580 --> 2:42:15.300]  across the country and it's coming out of washington through the fbi through homeland security through
[2:42:15.300 --> 2:42:19.780]  their training programs through the military's training scenarios we've reported on this over
[2:42:19.780 --> 2:42:25.140]  and over again that's the context but you can clearly see and let's play that clip again really
[2:42:25.140 --> 2:42:31.220]  quick can you guys uh got that ready well this is a nice thing about this is that if somebody is
[2:42:31.220 --> 2:42:36.580]  directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in they can do safely can they can pull right up
[2:42:36.580 --> 2:42:43.700]  to a front line they're still trying to address the threat without being afraid of getting shot
[2:42:43.700 --> 2:42:47.940]  so i'm thinking that it's totally appropriate in iraq but we're what kind of a situation in the
[2:42:47.940 --> 2:42:51.860]  u.s would you see that happening i mean we've got a lot of constitution listening a lot of people
[2:42:51.860 --> 2:43:02.260]  that stockpile weapons a lot of a lot of people that stockpile weapons a lot of a lot of ammunition
[2:43:02.260 --> 2:43:08.660]  they have and they have no weapons here locally there you go so yeah this is appropriate for
[2:43:08.660 --> 2:43:13.460]  iraq but what about here and he goes well yeah here we've got constitutionalists it was never
[2:43:13.460 --> 2:43:20.980]  about the islamic terrorists in iraq that was essentially a training program for them coming
[2:43:20.980 --> 2:43:27.140]  back home to america tyranny abroad always comes home the founders of this country understood that
[2:43:27.140 --> 2:43:30.740]  if we have a government that is no longer constrained by the constitution but comes
[2:43:30.740 --> 2:43:35.940]  after constitutionalists that's the danger and that's what it always turns into we have developed
[2:43:35.940 --> 2:43:41.860]  a militarized standing army that's what this program is all really about and uh that's that's
[2:43:41.860 --> 2:43:49.380]  clearly come home you have any comments paul yeah when he says stockpiling weapons that means
[2:43:49.380 --> 2:43:55.540]  owning guns i mean i've seen cases before where they raid somebody for stockpiling weapons and
[2:43:55.540 --> 2:43:59.700]  the guy owns like three or four guns so it's crucial to understand what they actually mean
[2:43:59.700 --> 2:44:05.460]  when they say that also you talked about it coming out of washington after fergus and obama came out
[2:44:05.460 --> 2:44:10.260]  with all this rhetoric against the militarized police state if you actually look at what he
[2:44:10.260 --> 2:44:16.260]  proposed the white house do about it it was merely to encourage the local police departments to
[2:44:16.260 --> 2:44:22.900]  reform and have dialogue with civil rights leaders so there was no teeth whatsoever in those so-called
[2:44:22.900 --> 2:44:27.620]  actions taken by the white house after ferguson they merely advised the police departments to
[2:44:27.620 --> 2:44:32.500]  look at their policy so oh yeah nothing's going to happen from that perspective and then make some
[2:44:33.620 --> 2:44:37.540]  some proposals which they didn't find to give cameras to all the police well you know we've
[2:44:37.540 --> 2:44:43.140]  had a lot of police departments who are wearing cameras and somehow they managed to miss recording
[2:44:43.140 --> 2:44:47.300]  whenever there's a misdeed in many of these cases but of course that wasn't going to change anything
[2:44:47.300 --> 2:44:52.260]  with the eric garner situation because that was recorded and the other issue the other answer that
[2:44:52.260 --> 2:44:57.380]  they had trying to make it into a racial thing was to say well we need to have more black police
[2:44:57.380 --> 2:45:02.340]  officers in communities that are that have a higher percentage of blacks in the police department
[2:45:02.340 --> 2:45:07.460]  and yet with eric garner the entire process of him being choked to death there on the sidewalk
[2:45:07.460 --> 2:45:14.100]  was overseen by a female black officer who was watching that as it happened so clearly having
[2:45:14.100 --> 2:45:19.140]  more black police officers having more cameras that's not really going to solve anything let's go to
[2:45:19.140 --> 2:45:26.420]  chris in texas chris go ahead yeah you know i'm first time caller um glad to get in i wanted to
[2:45:26.420 --> 2:45:30.900]  talk about kind of i've done some research over the last i don't know four or five years so
[2:45:31.620 --> 2:45:36.180]  had a lot of disinformation and finally kind of connected the dots i've seen some videos in the
[2:45:36.180 --> 2:45:41.380]  past but one that really kind of explains everything in detail is gentlemen by the name of kurt
[2:45:41.380 --> 2:45:47.540]  calling baka i believe and it's called season of treason where he goes into detail explains how
[2:45:48.100 --> 2:45:53.700]  it's under the united states corporation and not they're not working for the united states for the
[2:45:53.700 --> 2:46:00.900]  people it's all legal terms listed under persons gets into your dna your birth certificate and
[2:46:00.900 --> 2:46:06.420]  explains why obama you know you can have a president from japan um he's not a city he's not he doesn't
[2:46:06.420 --> 2:46:11.220]  have to be a u.s citizen because he's a ceo of corporation yeah i think instead of calling it
[2:46:11.220 --> 2:46:16.820]  washington dc we ought to call it washington i and c washington ink absolutely when you're talking
[2:46:16.820 --> 2:46:21.940]  about season of treason i mean this is the time of year actually two when they ram everything
[2:46:21.940 --> 2:46:26.340]  through we get the ndaa where they have indefinite detention of american citizens without trial they
[2:46:26.340 --> 2:46:31.140]  pass that on a new year's eve we say they rammed through obama care on a christmas eve and then
[2:46:31.140 --> 2:46:38.180]  of course everything that they just did to us this last week they pushed that through and very last
[2:46:38.180 --> 2:46:43.860]  minute so they could all go home and of course funded it not just until the next year but funded it
[2:46:43.860 --> 2:46:50.500]  for an entire year uh let's go to thank you chris let's go to uh jj in kansas jj you want to talk
[2:46:50.500 --> 2:46:57.380]  about australia can you hear me yes go ahead okay uh yeah i got uh two questions the first
[2:46:57.380 --> 2:47:04.980]  question is uh in regards to the australia deal i haven't uh been following two i've been hearing
[2:47:04.980 --> 2:47:11.140]  it but i haven't gotten too much detail myself investigating about it but what i have heard
[2:47:11.140 --> 2:47:17.940]  kind of makes me wonder if this could be um like sort of a false flag you know with the um the shooter
[2:47:17.940 --> 2:47:23.940]  dead with that which that's mainly always the case but uh with the shooter dead and then with uh the
[2:47:23.940 --> 2:47:30.100]  witness uh putting out in the media i could be wrong well go ahead and the media hey this is
[2:47:30.100 --> 2:47:37.700]  the isis attack you know trying to uh draw attention to isis let's get paul's uh comment on this because
[2:47:37.700 --> 2:47:42.740]  paul said that he thought it was curious that the media narrative was essentially moving away from
[2:47:42.740 --> 2:47:47.860]  trying to tide into isis for the time being and trying to deny that there was any connection
[2:47:47.860 --> 2:47:54.580]  with is islamicism or jihadis or isis or anything like that that is just the work of one uh loan
[2:47:54.580 --> 2:48:00.180]  criminal go ahead paul well what i also found interest in was and this may be another reason
[2:48:00.180 --> 2:48:06.260]  why the media and the estate the authorities are not so keen to uh kind of generate any any story
[2:48:06.260 --> 2:48:11.620]  about this perpetrator that suggests political motive and that he was just mentally ill loan
[2:48:11.620 --> 2:48:18.340]  not is the fact that he was given political asylum by the australian government in 1996
[2:48:18.340 --> 2:48:26.020]  and then in 2001 he was kind of a poster child for australia's abc network in demonizing
[2:48:26.020 --> 2:48:30.420]  iran because he claimed that his life was under threat from the iranian government that's how
[2:48:30.420 --> 2:48:36.340]  he got into australia in the first place so they kind of used him as a poster child back in 2001
[2:48:36.340 --> 2:48:42.580]  now he's very anti-assad um so that obviously doesn't fit with their narrative right now so
[2:48:42.580 --> 2:48:46.980]  that might be another reason why they're keen to distance themselves from him having political
[2:48:46.980 --> 2:48:52.980]  motivation because they were closely affiliated within the australian government and the media
[2:48:52.980 --> 2:48:59.300]  back in 2001 when his political opinions were useful for their narrative yeah interesting
[2:48:59.300 --> 2:49:03.380]  yeah certainly looked like uh he was doing everything he could to say that his motivation
[2:49:03.380 --> 2:49:09.220]  was uh some kind of a islamic jihad when he had them hold the sign up in the window uh let's go to
[2:49:09.220 --> 2:49:15.780]  james in south carolina james hi david hey i want to talk about torture for a moment
[2:49:18.100 --> 2:49:24.260]  i i can't see in the narrative and the discussion or around is torture effective in
[2:49:24.260 --> 2:49:30.980]  gathering information and does it prevent attacks save lives like nothing which i don't think
[2:49:30.980 --> 2:49:36.580]  torture has anything to do with that i think torture is about provoking terror in a population
[2:49:38.260 --> 2:49:42.340]  that's why you release somebody after their torture that's right they will go back and
[2:49:42.340 --> 2:49:47.780]  they'll say to everybody this is what they do to me and everybody's gonna say oh we can't mess with
[2:49:47.780 --> 2:49:55.300]  them we can't stand up to them look what they did to joe or oh absolutely i absolutely agree and if
[2:49:55.300 --> 2:50:01.780]  you look at some of the of course you know some of the torture ranged from uh attacking people's
[2:50:01.780 --> 2:50:07.300]  dignity to outright killing them and everything in between but i think the key part of that is
[2:50:07.300 --> 2:50:12.260]  even at the bottom end of the spectrum to humiliate people to as i said before to take away their
[2:50:12.260 --> 2:50:16.260]  dignity then you take away their freedom then you can take their lives and i think as you pointed
[2:50:16.260 --> 2:50:21.300]  out this is about intimidating american citizens i think it's very clear if you look at feinstein's
[2:50:21.300 --> 2:50:26.260]  report she had like 20 different key findings every single one of them said the cia did this the
[2:50:26.260 --> 2:50:32.740]  cia did that cia didn't do this and they should have there was nothing there except excuses for
[2:50:32.740 --> 2:50:38.100]  the administration excuses for the senate who should have been shutting this down who should
[2:50:38.100 --> 2:50:42.820]  have had oversight yet they put in her report that they had absolutely no responsibility
[2:50:42.820 --> 2:50:47.620]  to this whatsoever it was something that the cia did and your conclusion has to come to the fact
[2:50:47.620 --> 2:50:52.820]  that well if the cia can do this and pull the hood over everybody and not get punished i guess the
[2:50:52.820 --> 2:50:57.460]  cia is the real government we'll be right back with your calls we have paul joseph watch them from

[2:54:13.860 --> 2:54:17.700]  welcome back to the alex journal show i'm david night your host today and joining us from the
[2:54:17.700 --> 2:54:22.420]  uk is paul joseph watson and we're going to go right back to your calls in a moment but this
[2:54:22.420 --> 2:54:26.580]  article just came out on info wars dot com despite australia's gun control a gunman holds
[2:54:26.580 --> 2:54:33.860]  hostages for 16 hours you get that one of the most rigid gun control regimes on the planet and yet
[2:54:33.860 --> 2:54:40.740]  this guy who had 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault previously 14 counts of aggravated and
[2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:47.780]  decent assault previously related to six different women this guy is able to get a gun and he's able
[2:54:47.780 --> 2:54:54.020]  to hold these hostages for 16 hours two of them dying paul do you want to comment on that
[2:54:55.380 --> 2:54:59.940]  yeah i mean i made a series of tweets about that and there were several incidents i believe
[2:54:59.940 --> 2:55:06.340]  back in the late 80s early 90s which the authorities exploited to ban all guns in australia of
[2:55:06.340 --> 2:55:12.260]  course their violent crime went right went up yes and now you know my my thought was if this
[2:55:12.260 --> 2:55:17.620]  happened in texas would it have gone on for 16 hours would not some one of the store owners
[2:55:17.620 --> 2:55:23.060]  have had access to some kind of gun so it's definitely an issue it's one that liberals get
[2:55:23.060 --> 2:55:28.740]  enraged about when you even mention it but it's definitely a factor and it's interesting because
[2:55:28.740 --> 2:55:34.500]  this guy has had all these instances before attacking women and the sort of thing uh one of
[2:55:34.500 --> 2:55:41.620]  them he uh one woman uh was stabbed to death and set on fire they say in 2002 he faced charges
[2:55:41.620 --> 2:55:45.220]  and a plot to murder his first wife in sydney and she was stabbed to death she wasn't shot
[2:55:45.220 --> 2:55:52.020]  and yet this guy who has all these uh this long wrap sheet he's not having any problem
[2:55:52.020 --> 2:55:56.820]  getting a gun in australia that should tell us something about gun control as well as the fact
[2:55:56.820 --> 2:56:01.940]  that uh he's totally in charge for 16 hours let's go back take a couple quick calls let's try to
[2:56:01.940 --> 2:56:07.380]  get everybody off here before the end of the show uh let's go to patent and fema region four patent
[2:56:07.380 --> 2:56:15.940]  go ahead yeah thank you david uh how many more acts of treason murder this broad rape
[2:56:17.060 --> 2:56:25.380]  by barry sotero aka barry obama aka closet communist brocco obama obama miss we endure
[2:56:25.380 --> 2:56:32.260]  before we arrest him find a way something yeah i don't know i mean the bottom line is as we pointed
[2:56:32.260 --> 2:56:36.820]  out clearly the gop leadership doesn't have a problem with what he's doing either i mean it
[2:56:36.820 --> 2:56:41.220]  isn't just that you're going to get rid of obama and then have him be replaced by joe biden
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:45.300]  even if we replace him with the republicans we're going to get more the same your comments paul
[2:56:46.260 --> 2:56:51.060]  well the republicans are not going to impeach you i mean that's the fact now they're going to
[2:56:51.060 --> 2:56:56.660]  wait we're probably going to see hillary clinton uh run against the republican if not elizabeth
[2:56:56.660 --> 2:57:02.180]  warren which is just another brand of the same poison so that they're going to be quiet accepting
[2:57:02.180 --> 2:57:06.900]  to the fact that hillary's come in and then instead of race they're going to use gender to divide the
[2:57:06.900 --> 2:57:11.380]  country once more so we could be in for another four years of that yeah they not only did not
[2:57:11.380 --> 2:57:16.820]  impeach him but they basically endorsed his policies in this last budget a couple of weeks
[2:57:16.820 --> 2:57:20.740]  after they were elected to undo specific things they go back and endorse those so they don't have a
[2:57:20.740 --> 2:57:24.340]  problem with his criminal activities they want that power when they get in charge and so the
[2:57:24.340 --> 2:57:28.020]  question remains you know what do we do about it i clearly don't have an answer it's a very
[2:57:28.020 --> 2:57:32.500]  frustrating situation but we still need to pay attention as to what's going on and we need to
[2:57:32.500 --> 2:57:38.420]  i think a key part of this is more people need to be informed and involved about this it's an
[2:57:38.420 --> 2:57:42.340]  educational issue i think we need a broader base before we're going to see any kind of solution
[2:57:42.340 --> 2:57:47.380]  come up especially a peaceful solution which is what we want to see let's go to robert and tennessee
[2:57:47.380 --> 2:57:56.500]  robert hello hey go ahead doing good go ahead i uh i fall i live in millersville tennessee
