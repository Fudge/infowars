[00:00.000 --> 00:13.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.440 --> 00:38.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.160 --> 00:46.200]  it is the 19th day of November on this Thursday edition the 19th day of
[00:46.200 --> 00:55.160]  November 2009 we're going to be live here for the next four hours well several
[00:55.160 --> 01:04.320]  days ago Reverend Manning living in New York City a popular church pastor and
[01:04.320 --> 01:08.920]  also radio host was visited by Homeland Security and the CIA and threatened
[01:08.920 --> 01:15.400]  and told he will soon be arrested particularly because he's been covering
[01:15.400 --> 01:21.920]  the birth certificate issue and I tell you the Obama people sure act guilty on
[01:21.920 --> 01:28.240]  this on this topic we certainly cover it and look at it and believe it's
[01:28.240 --> 01:34.300]  suspicious but I don't make it my focal point when criticizing Obama the fact
[01:34.300 --> 01:39.640]  that Obama has lied about everything he's ever said or done and broken all of
[01:39.640 --> 01:47.600]  his pledges that's what we can focus on and prove but I don't really like even
[01:47.600 --> 01:50.280]  going after him for the birth certificate because then it makes it all
[01:50.280 --> 01:55.120]  about Obama when Obama is just a front man like George W. Bush and Clinton and
[01:55.120 --> 02:01.040]  Bush senior before him but nevertheless the persecution of Reverend Manning is
[02:01.040 --> 02:07.520]  very very serious he'll be joining us in T-minus 30 minutes John Perkins will be
[02:07.520 --> 02:11.240]  popping in for 30 minutes a best-selling author of Confessions of an Economic
[02:11.240 --> 02:15.440]  Hitman he's a big part of my film fall of the Republic I want to get a quick
[02:15.440 --> 02:18.860]  take from him on the state of the world and the banking system and the
[02:18.860 --> 02:24.200]  imploding economy then I had Webster Tarpley on a few days ago for just for
[02:24.200 --> 02:29.800]  30 minutes breaking down his detailed essay that he wrote investigative
[02:29.800 --> 02:37.280]  report asking is the Fort Hood shooter a Patsy taking part in a drill but
[02:37.280 --> 02:40.840]  separately I wanted to have Tarpley on with the economy as we watch the slow
[02:40.840 --> 02:47.560]  destruction of the dollar and then Alan Combs is coming back on he has me four
[02:47.560 --> 02:51.440]  or five times a year on his syndicated radio show and I like to have Combs up
[02:51.440 --> 02:55.840]  so we can spar back and forth it's always interesting to hear somebody who
[02:55.840 --> 02:59.080]  denies there's a world government being formed even when it's in hundreds of
[02:59.080 --> 03:01.400]  newspapers
[03:02.200 --> 03:08.600]  some will ask why do we have establishment types on the show because you
[03:08.600 --> 03:14.200]  get to hear it directly from their own mouths why did I have David Rothschild on
[03:14.200 --> 03:19.920]  because it was extremely informative why do we have Alan Combs on because it's
[03:19.920 --> 03:24.680]  extremely revealing and also these are the people that end up having the
[03:24.680 --> 03:31.200]  courage to come on the radio show why did I have David Vickers on well I'd
[03:31.200 --> 03:35.000]  just seen him a few times on the news talking about the New World Order I
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.440]  didn't really understand how hooked up he was with the Rockefellers everybody
[03:38.440 --> 03:44.080]  else but he's a friendly fellow comes across amicable kind of riding the
[03:44.080 --> 03:50.000]  fence and certainly now that I know all of his globalist connections I want him
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.400]  on more not less I want to pick his brain next time he comes on I'll be even
[03:54.400 --> 04:01.360]  more prepared next time I'm not some omnipresent all-knowing creature who who
[04:01.360 --> 04:07.280]  can know everything about everybody no I'm just like you I'm learning we're all
[04:07.280 --> 04:10.920]  learning as we go along but I do appreciate Vickers and Combs and others
[04:10.920 --> 04:16.560]  coming on the show having the courage to do it I appreciate Vickers plugging me
[04:16.560 --> 04:19.920]  on Glenn Beck Glenn Beck looked like he was about to have a heart attack two

[08:41.040 --> 08:47.000]  Ike was in the United States and I want to play 20 minutes or so of this today
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.240]  the first 20 minutes of the hour-long interview because it's particularly
[08:50.240 --> 08:54.000]  penetrating and informative and thought-provoking whether you agree with
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.600]  David on issues or not we're gonna play that here for the radio listeners today
[08:58.600 --> 09:05.040]  the video the interview is posted for prisonplanet.tv members so that is
[09:05.040 --> 09:13.080]  coming up later as well where to start NSA is giving Microsoft some help on
[09:13.080 --> 09:18.840]  its Windows 7 security I mean now when they build backdoors into your computer
[09:18.840 --> 09:25.560]  software they just hide it in plain view and say oh they're helping us with
[09:25.560 --> 09:30.960]  security just absolutely illegal all part of this
[09:30.960 --> 09:42.320]  technocracy we have running our society Al Gore has come out with a new book and
[09:42.320 --> 09:48.760]  in it they have a photoshopped image of the earth with hurricanes all over it
[09:48.760 --> 09:53.800]  and with part of the United States being flooded and don't even tell people
[09:53.800 --> 10:00.800]  that it's photoshopped I mean this is what they do it's just all fraud there's a
[10:00.800 --> 10:04.440]  bunch of articles here dealing with taxes that are part of the global
[10:04.440 --> 10:08.920]  greenhouse gas tax initiative being implemented at the state level that's
[10:08.920 --> 10:12.400]  the strategy right now being used by the federal and international regulatory
[10:12.400 --> 10:17.680]  bodies is just bypass Congress entirely California requires TVs to be more
[10:17.680 --> 10:23.400]  energy efficient you heard Schwarzenegger say ban TVs above 40 inches
[10:23.400 --> 10:28.600]  period and now the AP is reporting that it's it's even worse than that so we'll
[10:28.600 --> 10:32.280]  let you know and in the health care bill not only are there rationing death
[10:32.280 --> 10:37.080]  panels not only are there five years in prison quarter million dollar fines if
[10:37.080 --> 10:42.160]  you don't get insurance or pay your 2.5 to 5% of your paycheck on top of it as a
[10:42.160 --> 10:48.800]  new tax to the government Senate bill includes Botox tax I mean there's that
[10:48.800 --> 10:56.400]  type of stuff there is a five billion dollar estimated tax there and and and
[10:56.400 --> 11:02.360]  Harry Reid gave a speech we have time later I'm gonna play this but it's up
[11:02.360 --> 11:06.680]  on Politico they've got a video link to it I believe Kurt Nemo's posting in a
[11:06.680 --> 11:14.880]  link to it on info wars.com and I'll send it to him and Harry Reid gets up
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.920]  there and says well we're gonna go ahead and pass this bill this week or next
[11:19.920 --> 11:26.520]  week and this is historic and it's going to cut spending and it's going to
[11:26.520 --> 11:33.960]  balance the budget this is exactly what Obama's been saying now for a year and a
[11:33.960 --> 11:39.060]  half since two years really since he was on the campaign trail and now
[11:39.060 --> 11:45.920]  president for 11 months sworn in for 11 months elected over a year ago and it's
[11:45.920 --> 11:58.720]  just such an insult to everyone's intelligence Obama has quadrupled the
[11:58.720 --> 12:06.360]  yearly deficit spending more money currently he spent four trillion the
[12:06.360 --> 12:12.280]  the the the exposures over 20 trillion but but currently it's like with your
[12:12.280 --> 12:19.040]  house bill your car bill your power bill it's what you currently are due that is
[12:19.040 --> 12:23.760]  more money than every president before and back to George Washington and they're
[12:23.760 --> 12:29.680]  running around saying they're saving money and have cut the size of government
[12:29.680 --> 12:41.000]  the lies have reached a level that is farcical it's like the ADL and CBS news
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.800]  most of their publications the last two days attacking yours truly saying I'm
[12:44.800 --> 12:51.040]  the big king pin king and conspiracy incredibly popular dangerous reaching too
[12:51.040 --> 12:56.480]  many people in and implying I'm gonna cause a violent overthrow and something
[12:56.480 --> 13:01.480]  has to be done with me anybody who listens knows that's a lie I speak out
[13:01.480 --> 13:06.680]  against violence I speak out against preemptive offensive attacks on this
[13:06.680 --> 13:11.480]  criminal system and then the ADL says I'm lying and saying that there's a
[13:11.480 --> 13:15.480]  world government being set up when it's in the newspapers people are gonna see
[13:15.480 --> 13:22.920]  the ADL say that open their newspaper up and read New World Order World
[13:22.920 --> 13:26.640]  government every day in the papers and they're gonna go away how's this guy
[13:26.640 --> 13:30.560]  bad then if he's saying that I think the ADL and the government and on the
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.520]  establishment types really underestimate the work we've done and how many people
[13:35.520 --> 13:41.120]  we've woken up and overestimate their power you're discredited and you're only
[13:41.120 --> 13:44.800]  discrediting yourself worse just like with the mercury in the vaccines they've
[13:44.800 --> 13:48.440]  told every school kid in America they've handed out fact sheets at hospitals and
[13:48.440 --> 13:52.760]  colleges and businesses saying oh it's a myth there's mercury there's a myth
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.120]  it can cause neurological disorders Guillain beret it's a myth it can hurt
[13:57.120 --> 14:00.480]  your autoimmune system or give you cancer or sterilize you then you read the
[14:00.480 --> 14:06.640]  insert and it says it can do all that to you you guys are really blowing it for
[14:06.640 --> 14:15.320]  yourselves and so good keep it up but I'm on the White House enemies list many
[14:15.320 --> 14:21.560]  others are we have been visited by the Secret Service we have been visited by
[14:21.560 --> 14:25.640]  the FBI with little excuses they used to come over here and they're asking all
[14:25.640 --> 14:28.840]  sorts of other questions they look like they're on a rabbit hunt they're in
[14:28.840 --> 14:33.360]  they're in hunting mode you seen a dog when you take it out hunting it knows
[14:33.360 --> 14:37.440]  you're about to shoot some birds well they got the eyes the you know the look
[14:37.440 --> 14:45.600]  of retrievers and to them I'm like a big chew toy or something this is now
[14:45.600 --> 14:49.240]  happening to Reverend Manning but but they're telling him he says that they're
[14:49.240 --> 14:53.240]  going to arrest him and so this may be one of the last times we get to talk
[14:53.240 --> 14:56.920]  to him before he's behind bars he's coming up in about 15 minutes let's go
[14:56.920 --> 15:00.400]  ahead and play his little four-minute announcement that we've got linked up on
[15:00.400 --> 15:05.720]  info wars.com if you want to go watch it for yourself here it is I am James
[15:05.720 --> 15:13.040]  David Manning pastor of the Oplah World Missionary Church in Harlem Oplah
[15:13.040 --> 15:20.800]  New York I'm also the host of the daily radio broadcast called the Manning
[15:20.800 --> 15:31.640]  Report on the 16th of November 2009 on or about 6 p.m. in the afternoon two CIA
[15:31.640 --> 15:37.680]  agents claiming to be members of Homeland Security and two New York City
[15:37.680 --> 15:43.680]  detectives came to our church to ask me questions regarding statements I have
[15:43.680 --> 15:51.280]  made about Barack Hussein the long-legged Mac Daddy Obama they drew my
[15:51.280 --> 15:58.440]  attention the agents did to a posting on our website called Tea Party members
[15:58.440 --> 16:05.880]  go viral on the birth certificate and in that particular posting I stated that
[16:05.880 --> 16:13.920]  the long-legged Mac Daddy is invincible by the vote but only should you turn your
[16:13.920 --> 16:19.320]  attention to the birth certificate to issue then he becomes outrageously
[16:19.320 --> 16:28.040]  vulnerable he is indeed an illegal alien and is not qualified to be the US
[16:28.040 --> 16:34.960]  president but to spend all of my energy and time to overthrow this evil that has
[16:34.960 --> 16:41.680]  entered into our world as an American Patriot I'm compelled to fight to
[16:41.680 --> 16:49.120]  restore our Republic and its Constitution I expect as a result of the
[16:49.120 --> 16:55.640]  visit last night by the CIA and New York City police detectives homeland
[16:55.640 --> 17:03.720]  security people I expect to be arrested and not too many days therefore I pray
[17:03.720 --> 17:10.760]  to explain the entire matter of the dark kingdom and my representation of light
[17:10.760 --> 17:20.000]  and these are dark and evil days I will be charged with the threat against the
[17:20.000 --> 17:26.400]  life of the US president understanding that I will be arrested I wish to state
[17:26.400 --> 17:32.520]  to my church family friends and supporters that at present I am of a
[17:32.520 --> 17:41.040]  sound mind that the evil dark kingdom that is now led by Barack Hussein the
[17:41.040 --> 17:48.200]  long-legged Mac Daddy Obama that they in the arrest will not take my freedom
[17:48.200 --> 17:55.000]  simply by placing me in chains but they took the freedom from all of us with
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.960]  their acts of treason and their conspiracy to commit treason against the
[18:00.960 --> 18:08.960]  American people thusly we all have lost our freedoms I want you to know my
[18:08.960 --> 18:15.960]  church family friends and supporters that I knowingly and willingly have
[18:15.960 --> 18:21.880]  submitted to my God who asked me to serve him in this cause and in this
[18:21.880 --> 18:29.560]  matter and he alone has set my course and he alone will be my judge and so I
[18:29.560 --> 18:39.200]  say to Mr. Barack Hussein the long-legged Mac Daddy Obama members of the
[18:39.200 --> 18:45.640]  Central Intelligence Agency Eric Holder Leon Panetta and all the others that
[18:45.640 --> 18:52.560]  here I am at the Oplaw World Missionary Church in Harlem Oplaw New York you may
[18:52.560 --> 19:02.320]  come and arrest me I am waiting I will not resist for I welcome that you would
[19:02.320 --> 19:09.600]  do so and in doing so we can finally bring this matter of your ineligibility
[19:09.600 --> 19:16.200]  to serve this great Republic and your belligerent trashing of the Constitution

[24:52.960 --> 24:56.680]  live at prisonplanet.tv I'll replay these so folks can actually see the
[24:56.680 --> 25:01.320]  video but the audio says it as well and and and usually we don't play singing
[25:01.320 --> 25:04.680]  ends cuckoo the weaker whatever they almost always now use clips from my
[25:04.680 --> 25:10.520]  radio show they wouldn't dare actually have me on but singing in interviewed
[25:10.520 --> 25:18.080]  Oathkeeper Stuart Rhodes in a five-minute piece and let him talk three times for
[25:18.080 --> 25:23.120]  about five six seconds they would always edit him down so that he couldn't get
[25:23.120 --> 25:29.720]  any information out and they would show you know rooms full of hundreds and
[25:29.720 --> 25:33.840]  hundreds of Oathkeepers meeting and they'd show the one guy with a big beard
[25:33.840 --> 25:37.400]  or the one person in flip-flops not that you're bad if you have a big beard or
[25:37.400 --> 25:42.520]  flip-flops to make people look kooky or just it's a kid to playing clown music
[25:42.520 --> 25:46.240]  in the background and then when they were explaining their nonpartisan and
[25:46.240 --> 25:50.640]  just want police and military to uphold their oath how can that be extremism
[25:50.640 --> 25:57.200]  like the ADL and Southern Parvy Law Center saying they cut to the Obama
[25:57.200 --> 26:03.960]  deception they cut to follow the Republic and say oh the anti-Obama movie
[26:03.960 --> 26:09.640]  fall the Republic no the whole film is about how Obama is just a puppet who is
[26:09.640 --> 26:13.520]  going to be built up and then politically destroyed so that all the
[26:13.520 --> 26:20.240]  political heat on the unpopular globalist agenda gets blamed on him this
[26:20.240 --> 26:25.560]  is actually in the long run helping the individual Obama by letting people know
[26:25.560 --> 26:30.480]  he was just a front man and it helps the people the world understand how the
[26:30.480 --> 26:35.400]  political system really works it's not good for Obama short term or even long
[26:35.400 --> 26:39.920]  run for people to actually think he's running things now I do think he's an
[26:39.920 --> 26:44.680]  evil lying lawyer who knows what he's doing but he is still mid-level ladies
[26:44.680 --> 26:48.600]  and gentlemen just like George W. Bush was but they wanted to inject this
[26:48.600 --> 26:53.920]  statement about anti-Obama so that all of the Obama supporters watching would
[26:53.920 --> 26:57.800]  then hate Stuart Rhodes and the Oathkeepers when Stuart Rhodes and the
[26:57.800 --> 27:06.800]  Oathkeepers were criticizing George Bush they want to protect our country they
[27:06.800 --> 27:10.680]  were also implying there's no FEMA camps so Kurt Nemo wrote a very important
[27:10.680 --> 27:16.080]  story up on info wars.com titled CNN propaganda segment on Oathkeepers
[27:16.080 --> 27:22.880]  demonizes fall the Republic and he just links to ABC news Houston Chronicle
[27:22.880 --> 27:28.720]  Wall Street Journal admitting the FEMA camps for political dissonance he got
[27:28.720 --> 27:33.560]  congressmen on about it they've got legislation introduced to expand them and
[27:33.560 --> 27:38.200]  the ADL put out a report two days ago saying there's no FEMA camps and we're
[27:38.200 --> 27:44.720]  insane liars look it isn't going to work anymore here is a short clip where they
[27:44.720 --> 27:49.760]  try to invoke the left-right paradigm to divide everyone so that all the
[27:49.760 --> 27:53.360]  Democrats will hate Oathkeepers and think that it's an anti-Obama group here
[27:53.360 --> 27:58.720]  it is first to disobey any orders as they put it to disarm the American people
[27:58.720 --> 28:03.720]  or to force citizens into detention camps it's a pledge Rhodes recites in an
[28:03.720 --> 28:09.040]  anti-Obama DVD called the fall of the Republic not obey orders to post martial
[28:09.040 --> 28:13.760]  law I will not obey mark potock who monitors extremist groups for the
[28:13.760 --> 28:17.960]  southern poverty law center says the Oathkeepers are exploiting false rumors
[28:17.960 --> 28:23.480]  found on fringe websites many of the Oathkeepers are people who believe that
[28:23.480 --> 28:31.440]  martial law is about to be implicated at any moment it is we have the National
[28:31.440 --> 28:36.160]  Guard the regular army and Marine Corps running checkpoints nationwide and
[28:36.160 --> 28:40.680]  engaging in flagrant violations of the Posse commentator sack under direct
[28:40.680 --> 28:46.360]  orders from the Pentagon I mean to go over the evidence and army times they're
[28:46.360 --> 28:51.920]  announcing they're going to deploy 379,000 regular army troops on the
[28:51.920 --> 28:56.840]  streets of America phased in over the next three years I mean what are you
[28:56.840 --> 29:00.960]  talking about it's crazy but they're telling the public hey you're not
[29:00.960 --> 29:04.560]  supposed to discuss these issues it's not kosher to talk about these topics
[29:04.560 --> 29:08.640]  here's a clip from Glenn Beck two days ago where Damon vickers plugged the show
[29:08.640 --> 29:12.240]  and Beck look like he was gonna have a heart attack there are a lot of
[29:12.240 --> 29:15.680]  conspiracy theories out there and I had the benefit of doing the Alex Jones
[29:15.680 --> 29:19.040]  show show last night and I heard I heard a couple of them and I'm not
[29:19.040 --> 29:23.240]  disputing that many of them may be actually true but market forces are
[29:23.240 --> 29:28.320]  likely to take you don't need a conspiracy theory yeah but market forces
[29:28.320 --> 29:33.080]  are likely to take us there anyway the dollar is way too high and other
[29:33.080 --> 29:36.920]  currencies are way too low so what you're likely to see is a real line of
[29:36.920 --> 29:41.840]  currencies we obviously cannot say this in terms that people understand a
[29:41.840 --> 29:47.240]  realignment of currencies doesn't mean anything what it what it does mean is
[29:47.240 --> 29:50.720]  you're going to live closer to the standard all right we'll be right back

[34:07.480 --> 34:14.000]  around we have had the FBI here probing around so I take this very very seriously
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.200]  when it happens to another broadcaster and a pastor who's protected doubly
[34:18.200 --> 34:22.800]  under the First Amendment and who I've never heard call for any violence James

[35:01.260 --> 35:05.320]  lot of emails the last two days since we linked to a video up on info wars.com
[35:05.320 --> 35:11.600]  and PrismPlanet.com where he talks about a very threatening meeting he had
[35:11.600 --> 35:15.960]  with the Secret Service slash CIA and if you don't know the CIA works with the
[35:15.960 --> 35:21.600]  local New York police and the Secret Service that's been admitted and he

[35:49.320 --> 35:54.440]  calling for it he's pointing out that Obama is butchering the Bill of Rights
[35:54.440 --> 35:58.920]  and Constitution it's good to have you here with us pastor thank you very much
[35:58.920 --> 36:02.680]  Alex for having me on I'm really delighted to be on your broadcast today
[36:02.680 --> 36:08.640]  and let me say right away I I have as millions of other Americans have
[36:08.640 --> 36:14.720]  benefited greatly from your precise the eagle eye vision teaching of what's
[36:14.720 --> 36:18.360]  happening in this nation for a political point of view from a federal reserve
[36:18.360 --> 36:23.160]  point of view you know the Obama deception the fall of the Republic has
[36:23.160 --> 36:28.080]  really become the college the university at the place of education of
[36:28.080 --> 36:34.040]  Americans for actually how our government works globally financially we've all
[36:34.040 --> 36:38.280]  benefited greatly from your tireless expertise so I just want to thank you
[36:38.280 --> 36:42.440]  for informing me of so many things that I could not have known without having
[36:42.440 --> 36:45.800]  gone through all of your presentation so well God bless you pastor you've
[36:45.800 --> 36:51.800]  informed us of a lot as well why do you think that the and this has been
[36:51.800 --> 37:00.720]  reported on the Senate floor by Senator Alexander why do you think that we are
[37:00.720 --> 37:08.000]  now witnessing this attempt to intimidate myself yourself and many others
[37:08.000 --> 37:11.520]  and then blow by blow that's where everybody's tuning in right now what
[37:11.520 --> 37:17.320]  exactly happened at your church earlier this week well to answer your first
[37:17.320 --> 37:21.560]  question first I believe there there's several things and I pray that the
[37:21.560 --> 37:25.960]  audience will understand this in the light of which I mean it I believe that
[37:25.960 --> 37:32.760]  Obama and all of his backers are convinced that they have the power to
[37:32.760 --> 37:37.760]  overthrow this nation therefore they're not intimidated by the idea of
[37:37.760 --> 37:43.000]  threatening arrest or preparing to arrest and many ways of visit to your
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.640]  office and to as they've done could be very much a test of the American
[37:48.640 --> 37:53.720]  response to see how quickly or if the American people will remain a fleet to
[37:53.720 --> 37:58.520]  this the next time they come to you and you're not mine but to your ministry or
[37:58.520 --> 38:02.560]  office that may be for the full arrest and you'll never be seen again to ask
[38:02.560 --> 38:06.280]  for the second question basically the same thing but here's what happened on
[38:06.280 --> 38:10.840]  this past Monday night just three days ago at six o'clock in the evening I
[38:10.840 --> 38:15.800]  just finished a broadcast I do on the madding report I just did my
[38:15.800 --> 38:19.720]  salutation for the evening and someone knocked on the door and told me that the
[38:19.720 --> 38:27.280]  homeland security was in the building and they wanted to speak to me well I
[38:27.280 --> 38:30.160]  was in a different part of the building so I said all right okay bring them up
[38:30.160 --> 38:35.840]  what am I gonna do they're here they came up two members of Homeland Security
[38:35.840 --> 38:42.240]  who identified themselves as CIA HF not thought that was interesting I thought
[38:42.240 --> 38:47.800]  that would be for a foreign intrigue or foreign concerns and then they said
[38:47.800 --> 38:53.400]  also we're part of Homeland Security they also had with them two members who
[38:53.400 --> 38:59.240]  were detectives of the 28th precinct New York City Police Department but the
[38:59.240 --> 39:03.520]  detectives that they had were part of the riot control I know those two
[39:03.520 --> 39:06.400]  detectives because I've worked in this community for quite some time they knew
[39:06.400 --> 39:12.320]  me outside of the building were other Homeland Security officers with the
[39:12.320 --> 39:17.960]  Secret Service of CIA and other riot police flanking the building now I've
[39:17.960 --> 39:22.720]  never said anything that indicated that I would I'm against violence or that I'm
[39:22.720 --> 39:27.000]  for violence rather or that I would respond violently I've never indicated
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.600]  that in anything that I've said since I've been talking about Obama or
[39:30.600 --> 39:36.080]  preaching or anything else they came prepared for violence they came into
[39:36.080 --> 39:40.440]  my study and stated they wanted to talk to me and I asked them okay what does
[39:40.440 --> 39:46.560]  you want to talk about they pointed out that I stated in one of the video
[39:46.560 --> 39:53.120]  posting a week or so ago that I addressed a tea party people telling
[39:53.120 --> 39:56.920]  them how futile it was running around doing what they were doing because they
[39:56.920 --> 40:01.080]  were getting nowhere and if they spent the money and energy that they spent
[40:01.080 --> 40:08.200]  on the birth certificate issue his eligibility they could get somewhere and
[40:08.200 --> 40:13.600]  then we could finally bring him to trial and we could find him guilty of
[40:13.600 --> 40:18.160]  treason and execute him and shoot him that's what I said and they then
[40:18.160 --> 40:23.760]  responded to me by saying are you saying shoot the president I then asked
[40:23.760 --> 40:30.160]  them if I was under arrest and they said no then I said I have nothing further
[40:30.160 --> 40:33.960]  to say to you if I'm not under arrest they said they got up and they left it
[40:33.960 --> 40:39.120]  once one fellow left his card the part of the Homeland Security group they
[40:39.120 --> 40:46.000]  walked out I haven't seen hide their hair of them said I do expect however to
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.560]  be arrested I mean I've thought about this I prayed about it I've looked at it
[40:49.560 --> 40:56.960]  carefully and I I'm sure that what they're doing simply was to test the
[40:56.960 --> 41:01.680]  waters and not so much if they know who I am they've studied everything I've
[41:01.680 --> 41:08.000]  said I have not advocated the overthrow of the government I've not advocated
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.360]  advocated violence towards the government indeed I've advocated the
[41:13.360 --> 41:18.720]  upholding of the Constitution I think what they were doing and I'm clear about
[41:18.720 --> 41:26.760]  it now is they want to see what kind of support I have and what how would the
[41:26.760 --> 41:31.200]  American people respond to arrest I believe the people that have been
[41:31.200 --> 41:35.280]  visited by the Secret Service Homeland Security all are going to be arrested
[41:35.280 --> 41:40.360]  shortly well not shortly but tomorrow I mean but in due course if you've been
[41:40.360 --> 41:45.120]  visited by the Secret Service under the Obama administration except we remove
[41:45.120 --> 41:49.760]  him from office you're going to be arrested they're not dumb the Secret
[41:49.760 --> 41:54.120]  Service Department they test once that you go on their black list or their
[41:54.120 --> 41:58.600]  enemies list or Obama's enemies list they come and test you they come and test
[41:58.600 --> 42:02.880]  a response they come and test their case against you but they've already made the
[42:02.880 --> 42:07.280]  decision you're going to be arrested it's going to happen either that they're
[42:07.280 --> 42:12.040]  going to fascinate you well to be clear I had not seen the video you're
[42:12.040 --> 42:17.680]  discussing in question and I know that you've never called for any violence
[42:17.680 --> 42:26.520]  specifically you're saying through a judicial process if anyone was found
[42:26.520 --> 42:30.360]  guilty of treason or high treason we know what the penalties are under federal
[42:30.360 --> 42:35.040]  law my issue Pastor Manning and I don't believe you threaten the president and
[42:35.040 --> 42:40.840]  I believe it was your first-minute right to say that my issue is if anything ever
[42:40.840 --> 42:45.840]  happened to Obama they would turn him into a martyr a saint when he is a
[42:45.840 --> 42:49.720]  larger front for the overall New World Order I know from your research you
[42:49.720 --> 42:54.680]  believe he is even more more evil and and more powerful than that maybe maybe
[42:54.680 --> 42:58.440]  you're right he's very charismatic and very slick and and and is certainly the
[42:58.440 --> 43:05.360]  2.0 of New World Order puppet but I I certainly hope that the Secret Service
[43:05.360 --> 43:08.320]  doesn't come and arrest you because you've stated you're not calling for
[43:08.320 --> 43:15.520]  violence you're calling for what I have done repeatedly I've appealed to all
[43:15.520 --> 43:22.560]  Americans far and wide please protect this man's life do him no harm but the
[43:22.560 --> 43:26.320]  worst thing that could happen in my view is for someone to
[43:26.320 --> 43:30.680]  assassinate him there are two reasons why number one is that we would probably
[43:30.680 --> 43:34.480]  never get the opportunity to demonstrate his ineligibility in the
[43:34.480 --> 43:38.360]  fraud that he has perpetrated on this nation all the people that have put him
[43:38.360 --> 43:42.720]  up to it but even more important than that he would be turned instantly into a
[43:42.720 --> 43:47.640]  martyr he would be more popular and powerful than Jesus he's already more
[43:47.640 --> 43:52.240]  popular and powerful than dr. Martin Luther King Jr. don't kill this man I've
[43:52.240 --> 43:59.600]  said that repeatedly over and over again I need him alive I want him to live and
[43:59.600 --> 44:04.280]  I have heard you say that repeatedly so we're on the same page there then well
[44:04.280 --> 44:10.200]  you were smart not to not to talk to them there on their fishing expedition but
[44:10.200 --> 44:16.920]  the way you describe them coming in in in force is very very concerning you know
[44:16.920 --> 44:21.720]  my issue is the few times they've been here they always claim that they're
[44:21.720 --> 44:25.640]  here for one reason but then they start bringing up other issues and asking me
[44:25.640 --> 44:32.840]  my views on the president and asking me my views on my listeners and you know
[44:32.840 --> 44:36.920]  probing and then calling my employees not just coming but calling random
[44:36.920 --> 44:41.360]  extensions and asking my employees things about my operation about our
[44:41.360 --> 44:47.920]  servers about our websites and I just wonder how they get so many men to
[44:47.920 --> 44:53.800]  willfully engage in Nazi or slash Soviet or Maoist tactics I mean that's very
[44:53.800 --> 44:58.080]  un-American to have political police or commas are like they had in Russia
[44:58.080 --> 45:03.640]  creeping around and I certainly hope that your discernment's wrong but I know
[45:03.640 --> 45:07.880]  you do have I do respect you and respect your discernment
[45:07.880 --> 45:15.840]  Alex I but the the riot control police officer who is in charge of community
[45:15.840 --> 45:22.320]  affairs here in the Harlem area I know him we've had to interact with him on
[45:22.320 --> 45:26.880]  several issues regarding our school not that there's violence but community
[45:26.880 --> 45:33.360]  meetings to help make the community safer so he's involved in reaching out to
[45:33.360 --> 45:39.440]  pastors and clergy with them so I know him well when he came into when they all
[45:39.440 --> 45:44.800]  came in when I heard that the over the one homeland security was downstairs I
[45:44.800 --> 45:48.760]  immediately thought I was going to be arrested and you know I had I was cornered
[45:48.760 --> 45:54.600]  the only thing I had as far as defense was to to look them in the eye to see
[45:54.600 --> 45:59.920]  what I could instantly read even before they spoke to me that the homeland
[45:59.920 --> 46:04.080]  security leader spokesperson came in first through the door first followed
[46:04.080 --> 46:08.440]  by the second homeland security person who identify themselves as CIA agents I'm
[46:08.440 --> 46:12.320]  still concerned about that then after I'm sure they were they did that to
[46:12.320 --> 46:17.480]  terrorize you yeah I would think that that would be a foreign concern but
[46:17.480 --> 46:22.600]  it's illegal it's illegal but they still do it yeah Governor Jesse Ventura two
[46:22.600 --> 46:25.440]  weeks into office was told there's people waiting for you in the basement
[46:25.440 --> 46:29.680]  25 CIA agents wouldn't even tell him his name was what they were just there
[46:29.680 --> 46:34.720]  bossing him around it was intimidating I mean when they said CIA I mean you I
[46:34.720 --> 46:40.240]  that'll be the last thing I FBI okay I can handle that it was intimidating it
[46:40.240 --> 46:46.280]  it it shook me for just a moment the two detectives that walked in I tried to look
[46:46.280 --> 46:50.080]  them in the eye they looked down they looked everywhere except they would not
[46:50.080 --> 46:54.280]  look at me and I'm thinking to myself how can these men come to this church
[46:54.280 --> 46:58.780]  after they watched me all these years they know my track record in this
[46:58.780 --> 47:04.960]  community with such riotous ideas flanking this church preparing and maybe
[47:04.960 --> 47:08.080]  they thought they could provoke me into something and start a fight I mean have
[47:08.080 --> 47:11.760]  several employees see how several people you know just milling just in the
[47:11.760 --> 47:16.520]  building as it's a church you know and we're active every day 24-7 maybe they
[47:16.520 --> 47:19.200]  thought they could provoke a riot or something I don't know what they were
[47:19.200 --> 47:23.200]  thinking but I can tell you this I know they're coming back I know that they are
[47:23.200 --> 47:29.640]  even though they they it may be some time they will be back well sir we have
[47:29.640 --> 47:34.000]  contacts in the White House that we've spoken to and I've talked to other
[47:34.000 --> 47:40.480]  members of the press who also have contacts they do watch your videos they
[47:40.480 --> 47:48.240]  do analyze this show every day across the board the power elite are paying
[47:48.240 --> 47:52.560]  attention to what many of us are doing we've got a few minutes till we go to
[47:52.560 --> 47:57.960]  break would you like to add directly address the CIA the Secret Service the
[47:57.960 --> 48:06.040]  American commissars and the man who goes by the name Barack H. Obama very
[48:06.040 --> 48:10.440]  sitaro would you like to address them yes and he has yet another name the
[48:10.440 --> 48:15.080]  long-legged magnetic which is an official name for him is having the
[48:15.080 --> 48:20.600]  privilege to do so I would want to say that first of all I am an American
[48:20.600 --> 48:25.960]  patriot I love this nation with all of the strength and love that I can
[48:25.960 --> 48:30.040]  possibly muster and I will stand in defense of this nation and its great
[48:30.040 --> 48:35.000]  constitution it is the greatest nation on the planet and there's never been one
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.680]  like it except for maybe the nation of Israel having said that I earnestly and
[48:39.680 --> 48:46.520]  sincerely at the point of life and death believe that Barack Hussein Obama is
[48:46.520 --> 48:53.000]  ineligible to serve this great republic that he has stolen from all of us our
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.240]  heritage and is on track to destroying our Constitution he does not have a
[48:59.240 --> 49:04.600]  birth certificate and the Constitution is not here what he wants to do is to
[49:04.600 --> 49:09.600]  destroy our Constitution and our birthright to this nation I will not
[49:09.600 --> 49:15.400]  relent I'm prepared to go to jail if that is what it takes to demonstrate my
[49:15.400 --> 49:20.880]  commitment and to awaken the American people come put me in chains I'm
[49:20.880 --> 49:25.860]  prepared to do that but I am not prepared to live in this nation knowing
[49:25.860 --> 49:30.920]  in my heart that this nation has been robbed by Barry Satoro Barack Hussein
[49:30.920 --> 49:34.800]  Obama the long-legged back daddy so I say to all of those who are considering
[49:34.800 --> 49:41.240]  my actions and possibilities are my action I will not relent this brutal
[49:41.240 --> 49:47.080]  visit by the homeland security coming and polluting our sanctuary in church
[49:47.080 --> 49:54.800]  has only made me fight more tenaciously you have not seen me fight as of prior
[49:54.800 --> 50:00.720]  to your coming I will not relent Obama will be overthrown he will be
[50:00.720 --> 50:06.000]  overthrown even if I am assassinated he will be overthrown and exposed for what
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.440]  he is and by overthrown you're you're you're talking about impeachment I'm
[50:11.440 --> 50:19.000]  talking about court-martialed trial treason and the appropriate judgment of
[50:19.000 --> 50:28.400]  of of found guilty of treason well that is I tell you have a lot of courage
[50:28.400 --> 50:35.080]  pastor Manning a lot of courage because because certainly they are listening to
[50:35.080 --> 50:42.760]  every word you are saying right now and you just aren't have a lot of courage
[50:42.760 --> 50:48.120]  it's really I'm speechless here today the power of what pastor Manning is

[54:22.800 --> 54:28.320]  coming on the show again I'm rarely truly speechless but just the the the power
[54:28.320 --> 54:33.600]  and the commitment that I heard in your voice when you said he will be he will
[54:33.600 --> 54:38.680]  be defeated he will be removed from office I tell you are certainly standing
[54:38.680 --> 54:47.280]  up like George against the dragon well I I have no choice in this matter I I
[54:47.280 --> 54:55.200]  suppose that the commitment to my voice is also my love for this nation and my
[54:55.200 --> 55:02.400]  being a soldier of the truth and it's great reward more specifically this
[55:02.400 --> 55:08.280]  nation is is worth standing up for there's just no question about it it's
[55:08.280 --> 55:14.680]  worth every ounce of strength anybody gives to it well they may not arrest you
[55:14.680 --> 55:18.880]  because you've pointed out that it will only give you more attention in the
[55:18.880 --> 55:25.480]  birth certificate more attention and people will ask well pastor Manning
[55:25.480 --> 55:30.120]  didn't call for violence he said that if Obama's committed treason he should get
[55:30.120 --> 55:36.240]  in trouble for it I mean I don't know if I agree that that you know the penalty
[55:36.240 --> 55:40.880]  should but I guess the penalty for treason is is very very serious but
[55:40.880 --> 55:45.280]  there's so many other powerful people behind Obama I would like to see them
[55:45.280 --> 55:49.280]  all brought to justice through the courts and and and see what the courts
[55:49.280 --> 55:58.280]  decide but you know where do you see this going I think that if Americans that
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.640]  this entire process is gonna put a shed a lot of light on the Federal Reserve
[56:02.640 --> 56:09.320]  system as well the present economic status of our nation and there's never
[56:09.320 --> 56:16.280]  been anyone that has had as many of the I suppose supporters of goons from the
[56:16.280 --> 56:23.080]  Federal Reserve and the powers that be that Obama in terms of in his cabinet
[56:23.080 --> 56:30.120]  membership I believe I'm confident as well that when he tumbles that it will
[56:30.120 --> 56:35.040]  cause light to be shown a crack will be then seen into all of what you have
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.760]  discussed with respect to the Illuminati's to build a bird's raw child all
[56:39.760 --> 56:44.520]  of that crowd that can then be seen see what has happened to date no one has
[56:44.520 --> 56:50.280]  taken out the plug which is what people like Obama are but once he is removed
[56:50.280 --> 56:57.080]  light will flood in and America will be able to see well he is definitely their
[56:57.080 --> 57:01.860]  man I mean giving him a Nobel Prize for Peace when he's expanding the wars the
[57:01.860 --> 57:06.120]  way they worship him they certainly do want to turn him into a God and now
[57:06.120 --> 57:12.240]  Al Gore says his global warming movement is a religion these people really are
[57:12.240 --> 57:16.680]  devilish no there's no doubt about that but the thing we I think that we
[57:16.680 --> 57:23.280]  definitely will keep focused on is we've not had anyone as vulnerable as
[57:23.280 --> 57:28.160]  present there's never there's never been anyone as elevated at him as him and
[57:28.160 --> 57:34.760]  his fall again will expose all of them they have given I mean the America the
[57:34.760 --> 57:40.000]  American people to allow him to accept that prize Nobel Prize for Peace is
[57:40.000 --> 57:46.040]  just unthinkable that there are people in out of an outrage at the absurdity of
[57:46.040 --> 57:50.080]  the entire matter I mean America's ought to be standing and saying no we don't
[57:50.080 --> 57:55.680]  want this fraud anymore fraud perpetrate perpetrated on us through this man well
[57:55.680 --> 57:59.920]  pastor unfortunately we're out of time but hopefully you won't be arrested by
[57:59.920 --> 58:03.560]  next week I'd like to get you up sometime in the next few weeks for a full
[58:03.560 --> 58:07.120]  hour to really go through your beliefs and the important views you have for us
[58:07.120 --> 58:12.440]  and also as a black American a patriotic American the way Obama's people have
[58:12.440 --> 58:16.600]  been invoking race and actually creating racial division do you agree he's been
[58:16.600 --> 58:23.040]  doing that oh no doubt about that he's been using it most proficiently I'd love
[58:23.040 --> 58:26.760]  to discuss that with you you'll call me back and I'd love to be able to have the
[58:26.760 --> 58:30.760]  time that's been an hour with you Alex you're great American and God bless you

[58:46.880 --> 58:52.800]  decade we are the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with
[58:52.800 --> 58:56.560]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:56.560 --> 59:00.320]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[59:00.320 --> 59:04.840]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:04.840 --> 59:08.400]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[59:08.400 --> 59:12.800]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[59:12.800 --> 59:17.120]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[59:17.120 --> 59:20.880]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:20.880 --> 59:24.960]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:24.960 --> 59:28.720]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[59:28.720 --> 59:32.760]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:32.760 --> 59:35.480]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:35.480 --> 59:40.440]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my
[59:40.440 --> 59:44.160]  solar back up dot com that's my solar back up dot com remember the

[1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:13.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:21.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:32.200]  Alex Jones well he's a multi-time best-selling author amongst the titles

[1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:40.320]  bestseller he's got the new book out doing quite well packed crowds on his
[1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:43.800]  road trip across the United States hoodwinked as the new book he's in San
[1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:47.600]  Francisco today John Perkins was recruited by the National Security
[1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:50.680]  Agency during his last year at Boston University School of Business
[1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:55.320]  Administration in 68 he spent the next three years in the Peace Corps in South
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:01:00.840]  America and then in 71 join the international consulting firm and it
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:05.480]  goes on from there and he became a top economic hit man helping bring down
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:09.360]  third-world countries under the global banking cartel and corporate cartels
[1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:16.440]  control and we have him joining us today for the next 30 minutes John it's great
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:21.520]  to have you here with us thanks Alex it's wonderful to be with you as always we
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:28.280]  see the economic meltdown intensifying you've likened this in your books and
[1:01:28.280 --> 1:01:32.680]  on previous interviews to the same strategy the financial powers have used
[1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:37.600]  in third-world nations can you break down your job as an economic hit man and
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:43.280]  put it in context with a larger picture we witness today yeah yeah be glad to
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:47.160]  you we did a lot of different things but the most common was to identify
[1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:50.600]  countries with resources that corporations cover usually third-world
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:54.360]  countries or something like oil range a huge loan to that country from the
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:58.880]  World Bank or its affiliates however that money never went to the country it
[1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:02.680]  instead it went to our own corporations to build infrastructure projects in the
[1:02:02.680 --> 1:02:06.440]  country like power plants and industrial parks things that would benefit a few
[1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:10.680]  wealthy families as well as our companies but would leave the rest of the
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:14.240]  country just holding a big debt and people couldn't afford electricity couldn't
[1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:18.080]  get jobs in industrial parks or still have holding a huge debt and so we'd go
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:22.240]  back and say listen you can't pay your death so sell your oil real cheap for
[1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:26.880]  oil companies without any environmental restrictions vote with us on a UN vote
[1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:31.400]  or let us build a military plant on your soil and when we failed which wasn't
[1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:35.160]  too often Alex but I talk in my books about how I failed with Jaime Roldos
[1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:39.040]  democratically elected president of Ecuador and with Omar Torrijos at
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:44.280]  Panama the Jackals go in and either overthrow governments or assassinate the
[1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:48.800]  leaders and in the case of both Roldos and Torrijos because I wasn't able to
[1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:53.720]  bring them around to corrupt them they were both assassinated when all else
[1:02:53.720 --> 1:02:59.080]  fails then and only then like in Iraq the military goes in and I think we can
[1:02:59.080 --> 1:03:04.320]  see an analogy here with in this country we've gotten people to take on
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:09.600]  huge debts that they can't pay you know take mortgages out on houses that they
[1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:13.000]  couldn't repay with the promise that you know that house is going to double in
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.640]  value in the next five years so if you can just just pay a little bit more than
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:20.600]  you'd want to but very soon you'll have a piece of property that's worth a lot
[1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:25.720]  more than you invested and then then the bubble burst and people get taken I'm
[1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:29.040]  watching people right here in San Francisco right now out on the street
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:34.120]  demonstrating picketing a hotel here and it reminds me I
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:38.000]  talk in hoodwinked about a guy like that I talked with it he told me that he
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:41.680]  just was headed off of the picket line when some man appeared and reminded him
[1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:46.520]  they had a big mortgage on his home and he didn't go on a picket line that that
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:50.200]  makes us afraid to pick it it makes us afraid to do anything he was afraid if
[1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:54.360]  he did that he would lose his job not be able to pay for his home not be able to
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:59.160]  pay the mortgage lose his wife lose everything and and and and that is a
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:04.160]  something that really inflates us and we use that extensively in the third world
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:07.440]  and now it's being used tremendously in this country as well as many other
[1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:11.960]  techniques I want to get your perspective before you leave us because I'm
[1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:17.240]  trying to get different views on this on solutions to this you know we hear about
[1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:23.840]  the death of the dollar being eminent gold above 1,150 an ounce but then
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:27.960]  separately we also see the jackals the paramilitary forces now being deployed
[1:04:27.960 --> 1:04:31.400]  as they announced the end deposit commentatus here in the United States
[1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:36.240]  it's becoming increasingly clear George Bush Barack Obama are just frontmen
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:39.840]  even though they were good guys and and it's the National Security Council the
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:46.240]  NSA the the Pentagon that are really in control and and how do we even have a
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:50.200]  debate with these people because we can or dialogue we can all have our own
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:54.000]  solutions or own ideas the problem is they've got their own idea and they're
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.200]  in the driver's seat John Perkins author of hoodwink a best-seller in stores now

[1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:45.680]  syndicated radio broadcaster and author can have a debate with him find out what
[1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:50.200]  we agree on what we disagree on coming up in the last hour today there have been
[1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:54.160]  some other huge breaking news stories so at the bottom of the hour you'll want
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:58.520]  to stay with us some huge breaking news stories concerning this radio show al
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:03.600]  gore everything that's going on this radio show I'm not bragging it's actually
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:08.960]  freaking me out is being propelled into the mainstream everywhere and I'm trying
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:13.600]  to figure out exactly what is going on let me ask John Perkins this John I
[1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:21.640]  suddenly have the right wing the left wing the CBS news the ADL I don't even
[1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:30.400]  really talk about Israel Salon the new republic all talking about me and a lot
[1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:34.360]  of its negative but then some of it is positive and then a lot of it saying I'm
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:39.440]  dangerous and that and that we're spreading like wildfire and we're
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:43.280]  incredibly powerful I don't think of myself as incredibly powerful maybe
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:47.760]  they're just building me up for public consumption and building my name up
[1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:51.320]  before they destroy me that's kind of what my instincts are telling me I don't
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:54.360]  I didn't mean to get you on and then ask you about myself but you're a pretty
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:57.400]  savvy guy that's worked at all these different international levels of
[1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:03.080]  corporations what does this sound like to you well it's hard to say Alex I mean
[1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:06.960]  usually they if they're going to do something to you they don't talk too
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:11.280]  much about you ahead of time unless they're really painting a bad picture so
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:14.320]  that you become a bad guy that the Patriot Act can go after and they can
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:18.280]  put you away someplace in some little room closet and some penitentiary for
[1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:22.040]  nobody'll ever see you again for the rest of your life I doubt if they're
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:25.160]  going to do that to you you're a little too public for that I think but I will
[1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:29.800]  say this I spoke at the United Nations last week I also last week spoke to
[1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:35.720]  2400 at a conference of 2400 MBA students at the Cornell last night here in
[1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:39.200]  San Francisco and Portland the other and speaking all over the country people
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:42.760]  keep coming up to me and telling me that they've seen me in your film and the
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:46.160]  film's great and you and your film's getting out there and and that's I
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:50.440]  probably what's going on here so I you know I would take it as a compliment if
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:55.200]  I were you and and good publicity but I'd also keep looking over my shoulder
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:59.280]  you know bit just be be careful I think the best defense is to keep getting the
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:03.440]  word out and get the word out that you're a little scared because that's not
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:07.400]  it and get the word out that if something strange happens to you in the
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:12.480]  next few months nobody should accept the fact that you're suicidal or or whatever
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:17.560]  you know that you're not any of them let me just say this I told my guys two
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:21.120]  weeks ago and it came out to mail you a copy if you haven't been home yet or
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:25.000]  haven't seen it yet I'll mail several more but you are in fall of the republic
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:28.520]  breaking down the economy and we really appreciate you John Perkins but I know
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:33.120]  you went through a lot when you went public against these people and and I
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:37.520]  know had some dirty tricks but you came through that and and I think something
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:41.480]  else is happening I think a lot of people in the establishment itself like
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:44.840]  you but but you know this happened to you years ago it's happening to them now
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:49.200]  are really realizing that the system we've created even if you're a member
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:53.600]  of the elite or or a high-level operative for them and like in your case is
[1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:57.000]  bad for your children and grandchildren and I think a lot of people in the
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.680]  power structure are really starting to have second thoughts about all of this
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:05.720]  I agree with you you know in the last 30 40 years we've created what I call a
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:10.760]  mutant viral form of capitalism predatory capitalism and the sole goal
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:15.080]  you know was expressed by the by the economist Milton Friedman and really
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:18.920]  embraced by Ronald Reagan and every US president since Democrat and Republican
[1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:23.600]  alike the goal that the only responsibility of business is great
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:27.440]  profits regardless of social environmental cost that's a new concept
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:32.560]  he's the big guy I learned under when you know in his theories when I was a
[1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:36.520]  business student he was much more compassionate the other side of that is
[1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:39.600]  there should be no regulations on business because it just gets in the way
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:42.520]  of profits and business should own everything everything should be
[1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:47.240]  privatized including the military and the police etc etc etc and so that's
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:51.600]  taken us to an extremely dangerous world it's brought us to a system that's
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:56.680]  just unviable that's not working and I think everybody recognizes that except
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:01.000]  the few very powerful and rich people at the top have gotten a lot more rich and
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:05.240]  powerful for them the system is working at least in the short run and but the
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:08.720]  rest of us are getting it and I think you're finding a tremendous rebellion in
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:13.400]  the system when that starts to happen the the corporateocracy that people in
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:17.760]  control dig in you know for every action there's a reaction and you know as I
[1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:21.240]  travel around talking to MBA students and college students we're going to go
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:25.440]  into business I've seen Alex in the last five years a tremendous change in
[1:13:25.440 --> 1:13:29.400]  attitude amongst them they're really talking a lot more about social
[1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:36.000]  responsibility the triple bottom line environmental responsibility and this
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:40.040]  is very positive and yet it's also going to elicit a reaction from the
[1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:47.200]  corporateocracy those those in control trying to navigate this minefield with
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:52.800]  with with your unique experience and perspective certainly there is an
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:57.120]  overall agenda of a world elite they tend to think the same they have
[1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:02.960]  conferences and meetings but there are power structure fishers and divisions
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:08.040]  and different camps from my study a do you agree with that and be how would you
[1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:13.120]  break down these different corporate structures that you describe as a as
[1:14:13.120 --> 1:14:17.400]  like clouds over the surface of the globe they're above all the nations
[1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:21.800]  they're exempt from the laws that they put on the rest of us yeah we're at a
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:25.640]  time in history Alex it's like when city-states became nations except today
[1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:29.040]  the nations are losing their relevance and their power and so are the
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:33.480]  presidents it's the big corporations that as you pointed out these big clouds
[1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:36.920]  sweeping around the planet that no no national borders or don't listen to any
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:42.120]  specific sets of laws and they're not a coherent group I don't really subscribe
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:46.120]  to a conspiracy theory because these people don't have to get together a lot
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:50.720]  and don't even know each other there's not a lot in common between Exxon for
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:57.720]  example and Nike or Walmart or Monsanto but they all are driven by this one
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:01.960]  single goal of maximizing profits regardless of the social environment so
[1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:05.080]  it's like locust I mean they don't have to communicate with each other to
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:10.600]  descend on a field and and and and eat the grain down to the bone that's just
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:16.640]  what they do that's a great analogy yes you're right it is like that and and
[1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:20.720]  and and they're doing it and it created an unviable we've created an economic
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:25.040]  system that's a total failure less than five percent of the world's population
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:29.440]  lives in the United States consumes more than 25 percent of our resources 10
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:33.640]  percent of those people own almost all the assets in the United States and a
[1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:38.600]  great deal of the world nearly half the world in the meantime is starving or on
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:43.520]  the verge of starvation that's not a model you can sell to China or India or
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:47.880]  Latin America or Africa that's a failure it's a failed system and so there's only
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:52.720]  one conclusion we have to change it and the people who are benefiting from that
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:56.240]  system are not going to want to see it change so they're going to resist very
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:16:02.720]  strongly but we the people must get out there and force the system to change but
[1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:06.760]  how do we do that without these different corporate interests
[1:16:06.760 --> 1:16:11.320]  misdirecting our energies because they're so good at coming in with a phony
[1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:16.520]  template and co-opting activist groups or creating their own activist groups for
[1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:26.800]  their own kind of reformoid counterfeits of real reform well the how-to is a
[1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:31.600]  large part of hoodwinked it's why I wrote the book hoodwinked my passion that
[1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:36.880]  just rose to the surface of that my daughter gave me a grandson who's two
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:41.040]  years ago he's not two years old and this baby's really tracking my passion
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:45.440]  because I realized that if we say the course his world when he's my age six
[1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:49.440]  decades from now is going to be ugly but we have the opportunity to change it and
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:53.000]  we must recognize that the only way my grandson is going to inherit a
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.840]  sustainable just and peaceful world is if every child on the planet has that
[1:16:57.840 --> 1:17:01.920]  same expectation and it's realized this is the first time in history this has
[1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:06.400]  been the case where where our own self-interest here in the United States
[1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:10.200]  is driven by a world self-interest we can't have Homeland Security till we
[1:17:10.200 --> 1:17:13.880]  recognize the whole planet as our homeland and this is very new where we
[1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:18.800]  become such a small integrated planet and so that the book hoodwinked is all
[1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:23.880]  about that but but very very briefly I think a couple of things with these big
[1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:28.440]  corporations are dependent on us to buy their goods and services or on our tax
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:33.280]  dollars to buy their goods and services as consumers we have a lot of power as
[1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:37.160]  tax tears we have a lot of power often think what if we what if we really
[1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:40.800]  demanded of our government that they even a small share to start with of the
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:46.200]  military budget pay the same companies general dynamics rating on whoever but
[1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:50.120]  instead of building missiles have been built and invent and build equipment
[1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:53.960]  that can clean up the terribly polluted lands and we'll see they don't want to do
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:57.640]  that even though they would still make just as much money because it would make
[1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:03.760]  those third world and developing world people educated and strong and self
[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:07.880]  sufficient which in the long run the elite believes could displace them and
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:12.120]  that's stated in a lot of top corporate documents that we've covered here on air
[1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:18.160]  there is a method to this madness this instinct by elites to to not build up
[1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:22.440]  populations because if you keep them poor and dumbed down they're much too
[1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:25.960]  worried about trying to give enough food to eat to ever take over their
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:31.560]  government and you know bring true freedom absolutely correct and in terms
[1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:35.000]  of the people who are currently running the corporate talk or say but they're
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:39.360]  getting old and it's a new there's a new brand coming along I'm really running
[1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:43.760]  into in business schools that understand something different happening I was just
[1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:49.120]  lecturing last week two weeks ago at Howard University in Washington DC their
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:53.160]  law school most of students there are African Americans or from Africa directly
[1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:57.760]  and we talked a lot about Africa how Africa has more resources than any of
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:03.160]  the continent on the planet and yet the poorest people and Latin America second
[1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:07.400]  and now we've seen a huge revolution in Latin America where 10 countries have
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:11.480]  voted in democratically presidents who are saying no to this exploitation and
[1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:16.200]  yet I was asked to speak at a conference of CEOs of many of the
[1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:21.280]  companies that are taking minerals out of Latin America
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:26.320]  extractive companies and I asked why do you want an ex economic hitman to speak
[1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:29.440]  to you you know someone wrote a book Confessions of an Economic Hitman and
[1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:33.760]  they said because we realized that we could no longer get away with raping
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:37.760]  and plundering and then use those words but that's what they said and and yet we
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:41.880]  still want the minerals so we want you to help us understand how we can work
[1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:45.680]  better with these people how we can become better community members and I
[1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:50.240]  think Alex we're seeing that in the new generation is coming up and I agree that
[1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:54.560]  there's some some awakening happening but also you're hurting them so they
[1:19:54.560 --> 1:19:59.920]  want to be able to analyze you stay there John Perkins is our guest will be

[1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:07.880]  today hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:21:07.880 --> 1:21:13.360]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:15.840]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:21.040]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:25.680]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:30.040]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:35.320]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:39.600]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:43.120]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:48.360]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:54.000]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:09.600]  build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:14.040]  with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical many
[1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:17.880]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a fly free
[1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:21.440]  enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing
[1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:25.840]  us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes. These questions
[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:29.280]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book The Creature from

[1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:47.800]  Economic Hitman and other books he's written are really having a big effect
[1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:50.400]  and somebody that constantly gets brought up to me when I'm on other talk
[1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:55.120]  radio shows is John Perkins and it's another testament to the idea of if we
[1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:59.800]  just take action over time we can affect change in a positive way but don't
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:03.560]  expect things in this instant gratification society to be overnight
[1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:09.240]  I use the analogy or parallel of 10 years ago you couldn't find organic
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:14.520]  food in most grocery stores now it's displacing the GMO crap so that's how
[1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:18.720]  we vote with our dollars and that's what John Perkins really is an expert at
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:22.920]  is showing people how to vote with their dollars do you still think that's one of
[1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:28.920]  the most powerful tools we have John? I absolutely do Alex you know we've seen
[1:25:28.920 --> 1:25:33.000]  in the past like we get rid of apartheid in South Africa because we didn't buy
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:36.360]  from companies that supported it we got the big corporations to clean up
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:41.520]  terribly polluted rivers in this country to bring in more women and
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:47.240]  minorities into their employment ranks to get rid of hormones and trans fats
[1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:53.080]  and food and then in animals we have a lot of success on specific issues but
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:56.320]  now we need to ratchet that up a notch and say we're only going to buy from
[1:25:56.320 --> 1:26:02.480]  companies that are committed to creating a sustainable peaceful and socially just
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:06.680]  world and you know that for the first hundred years in this country no
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:10.120]  corporation could get chartered unless it proved that it was serving a public
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:13.960]  interest the charters last about 10 years on average and they had to go back
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:19.120]  to get re-charted that all changed in the late 1800s when the Supreme
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:24.000]  Court decided that the corporations have the same rights as individuals without
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.920]  the responsibilities but I think we need to go back to some laws that forced
[1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:33.800]  these companies to be good citizens environmentally and socially and to
[1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:37.560]  start with to get those laws moving into place you and I and all of your
[1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:42.080]  listeners need to send emails to every company out there I'm not buying from
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:46.240]  you Nike because you still have sweatshops in Indonesia and I am buying
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:49.600]  from you X company because you don't put there's a lot that don't and you can
[1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:53.320]  find them on Google there's many places where you can find them so we that's
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:58.760]  like Walmart I mean we know Walmart is a predatory company that owns slave
[1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:03.880]  operations slave wages around the world we know they come in and sell under
[1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:07.640]  price which is it free market it's predatory destroy all their competition
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:14.040]  I will not buy from Walmart because I know it's killing our country likewise
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:18.760]  I agree and and and if we have a real consumer revolt we talk about it enough
[1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:22.280]  and get people out there we can have an impact in fact we are having an impact
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:25.280]  on a wall but I think Walmart I think that they that they're that they're
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:28.360]  flacking off a little bit they're getting better environmentally that's a
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:32.400]  good thing but it's not nearly nearly good enough but it shows you that we do
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:36.880]  have an impact and we just need to have a much greater impact and we need to
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:40.600]  convince these companies that they to their advantage to level the playing
[1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:44.720]  field that none of them is going to survive in a world that we're headed
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:50.080]  toward now that in the long run we've all got to do a better job I mean it's
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:54.160]  self-evident you have to be sustainable or you go out of existence and that's
[1:27:54.160 --> 1:27:57.520]  the course that we're on right now is one toward being to put we're going out of
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:01.560]  existence they better recognize this too and we need to force them and I and I
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:06.280]  am encouraged by the students that I'm seeing in universities and business
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:09.320]  schools now that I think are getting it a lot more they're being influenced by
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:14.760]  Al Gore's movie by the constant gardener movies like Blood Diamond so many books
[1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:18.760]  up there films like yours this show there's so much that's going on that I
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:21.880]  think the that the new generation is coming up with a new sense of
[1:28:21.880 --> 1:28:25.760]  consciousness but see that's the only place we differ I think what Al Gore is
[1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:30.920]  doing about making an all about carbon dioxide that that becomes a distraction
[1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:35.240]  from all the other real environmental issues and the type of solutions that
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:40.640]  that you come up with I mean I think that's that's where we differ but
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:45.280]  overall I know that you are just trying to get people involved and simply getting
[1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:49.720]  the public involved is the start to them finding out what's really true and
[1:28:49.720 --> 1:28:54.680]  accurate John Perkins a new book of course is already a best-seller out

[1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:37.000]  debate I mean getting people to not just watch football and start even
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:40.760]  thinking about political issues is the first step in the solution John thank

[1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:33.400]  live radio when I saw the headline at rush limbaugh.com the top of the
[1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:41.280]  website I mean the the the mega alert headline I almost fell out of my chair
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:44.880]  we started getting flooded with tickets and calls here to the office at limbaugh
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:51.480]  went on and on and on about prison planet calm today and how great the
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:56.320]  reporting is on Al Gore and his fraud I mean I have been a big critic of rush
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:01.680]  limbaugh what is going on here I mean limbaugh has talked about me I don't know
[1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:06.960]  10 15 times over the years that I know of he does have 20-something million
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:11.800]  listeners a day he is the biggest media event out there TV cable it's all
[1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:19.320]  fractured into thousands of channels but rush limbaugh is the mac daddy of talk
[1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:24.760]  radio period and I check a side out maybe once a week and he net he has a
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:30.400]  giant headline at the very top of the page the entire top of the page says
[1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:37.400]  prison planet with hurricanes at 30 year low gore turns to photoshop and gore has
[1:34:37.400 --> 1:34:44.920]  specifically rush limbaugh has specifically attacked prison planet two
[1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:49.320]  times I know up we've played the clips here that we probably dig those up on
[1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:57.040]  YouTube I think the title is limbaugh attacks prison planet I mean he just
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:35:02.000]  loves to talk about prison planet usually in a bad light and now here he is
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:07.760]  limbaugh we know is a daily reader of the site we know Glenn Beck is I mean two
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:10.720]  days after we have a guest on there on Glenn Beck I want to see how do the
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:15.360]  Glenn Beck people what's happened is they realized because the corporations
[1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:21.120]  all track web numbers and statistics and radio affiliate numbers and we're on a
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:26.440]  lot of small mom-and-pop stations some big stations but we're on and places
[1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:31.760]  like Chicago and stations that go into San Francisco and San Diego and Miami and
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:42.520]  Buffalo and Knoxville Tennessee the list goes on and on Austin Texas and little
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:46.600]  bitty stations that we're on are now beating big talk stations now sometimes
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:53.360]  it takes a year but tiny stations have shown up big time I mean 500 waters in
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:58.080]  some cases have shown up with no ratings suddenly boom two books later
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:03.320]  arbitron big ratings and it gets bigger and bigger and so they know that this
[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:08.080]  show is hotter than a firecracker because we're just telling the truth and
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:14.400]  we're shattering the left-right paradigm and I don't know what's going on with
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:21.400]  all the media coverage CBS negative I mean I could list all the I mean it's
[1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:28.560]  every day 10 15 20 big newspapers talk about info wars dot com and prison
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:31.680]  planet dot com what we're doing and they they talk about us like we're some
[1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:36.520]  type of grizzly bear stalking the night that's going into people's homes and
[1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:41.240]  eating them I mean it's like I'm some giant fire breathing black dragon
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:49.400]  stomping across the landscape and we're not but Rush Limbaugh spent much of his
[1:36:49.400 --> 1:36:53.120]  first hour talking about the prison planet dot com article and reading from
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:37:00.400]  it that is just mega huge that is mega mega huge and you heard John Perkins
[1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:05.480]  say that everywhere he goes people aren't now talking about the films the
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:09.280]  Obama deception follow Republic you know who deserves all the credit for this
[1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:14.240]  you the listeners we are really forcing the mainstream media to address the New
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:17.520]  World Order the world government for decades they denied it but they lost
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:20.880]  all credibility denying it now they admit it but try to put their spin on
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:27.640]  it I'm gonna talk more about this coming up we do have Alan combs the radio
[1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:31.320]  broadcaster TV host joining us that should be an interesting debate we've
[1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:35.640]  got Webster Tarpley coming up for 30 minutes of the next hour and I do have
[1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:38.840]  a bunch of audio clips we have the listener comment line I've got a bunch
[1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:44.920]  of those like where's my call sheet my guys are so professional now they they
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:48.400]  printed me up out of the hundreds of calls they printed one two three four
[1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:52.080]  five six seven eight different calls they think we should play and I agree with
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:55.760]  them we're gonna play those after Tarpley's on with us and I'm gonna
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:37:59.600]  answer these questions some days we won't take calls we've got four or five
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:04.840]  guests but we will always play your calls from the phone system that way we
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:08.880]  also know they're informative or good questions and a lot of days we'll just
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:11.800]  take phone calls I'm gonna really mix the show up as we've been doing lately
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:15.440]  because I gotta go to the next level here I've got so many listeners so many
[1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:21.600]  viewers and sometimes I got a little bit lackadaisical that I'm on the radio
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:24.880]  reaching millions of people I don't even get butterflies anymore when I go on
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:29.120]  national TV that's not a good thing I'm making myself get butterflies again so
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:37.840]  to make sure all my synapses are firing accordingly I also want to thank all our
[1:38:37.840 --> 1:38:41.440]  sponsors that have made the radio show possible and Ted Anderson everyone but
[1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:44.800]  that is coming up also want to play 20 minutes of an hour long interview
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:48.880]  exclusive interview with David Ike I want to play some of that here on the
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:53.920]  radio for the first time here on this radio show coming up later as well that
[1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:57.680]  we'll start doing that this hour but right now for the next five minutes I
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:03.560]  wanted to bring Lisa Pelton on she joins us once a month once a month they
[1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:10.800]  have a special and this is the only done the special one other time it comes out

[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:21.560]  it's $999 other systems that aren't even as good or two three four thousand
[1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:26.160]  dollars is an atmospheric water generator I researched these chose this unit over a
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:31.600]  year ago contacted on myself and found out some of the owners were fans and so
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:34.400]  they're they're big sponsors I really believe in this unit have one of the

[1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:46.920]  us a regional director of sales for the East Coast for a color blue good to
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:52.120]  have you here with us hi Alex it's nice to talk to you again I want to tell you
[1:39:52.120 --> 1:39:56.960]  that I've been listening all week long and no good deed goes unpunished sir
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:03.640]  that's a that's a good African parable that's a Zulu parable that's that's
[1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:10.880]  correct um the Akola blue 28 is on special for your people and it's $999
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:18.440]  for shipping and tax and that's gonna run through Monday of this week tell
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:23.960]  people about the Akola blue 28 the Akola blue 28 is an atmospheric water
[1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:28.920]  generator and what it does is it pulls the humidity out of the air runs it
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:33.800]  through a multi-stage filtration process and produces up to seven gallons of
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:43.800]  crystal pure water a day it certainly does and again this special is only
[1:40:43.800 --> 1:40:50.040]  running until Monday Monday evening bottle water leeches toxic chemicals
[1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:54.400]  estrogen mimicking chemicals it's expensive it's killed people just
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:59.480]  google bottle water kills when bacteria get in it water filtration systems a
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:02.360]  lot of times don't cut everything out though there are some good systems this
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:06.920]  is right out of the air and then it runs through seven filtration systems when
[1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:11.480]  I say a color blue water is like is unlike any water you've ever had you've
[1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:19.080]  got to drink it to understand it and you know what we have to you know really
[1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:26.760]  look at is the problem today is bottle water has become a food phenomenon it's
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:31.200]  ridiculous first they're putting in bad tap water with pharmaceuticals and
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:37.440]  fluorides into plastic bottles that are leaching estrogen like chemicals yeah
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:42.000]  all they do is put it through light filtering to take out the dead bacteria
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:46.640]  chemical taste but it still has a lot of the bad stuff in it that's right and so
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:51.160]  that's why we're trying to encourage everyone to get in a color blue 28 get
[1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:57.160]  their family and themselves off the grid be smarter than the grid because the
[1:41:57.160 --> 1:42:01.040]  grid is vulnerable well with the color blue 28 there's no need to worry about
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:05.120]  water supply shortages or interruptions no need to stockpile water even in the
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:09.600]  face of water shortages or drought no need to buy bottle water and drag it
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:15.720]  home yet still not be sure of its purity and effects of the BPA plastic no need
[1:42:15.720 --> 1:42:18.440]  to worry about fluorides pharmaceuticals and other contaminants like
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:23.240]  herbicides pesticides trihalo methanes a color blue provides you with a maximum
[1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:28.080]  water independence ladies and gentlemen give them a call today tell them Alex

[1:44:46.200 --> 1:44:52.200]  prisonplanet.tv and from prisonplanet.tv here is the audio of the video with
[1:44:52.200 --> 1:44:55.760]  David Ike
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:06.120]  I'm David Ike from England I went through an extraordinary series of what you
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:11.160]  might call paranormal experiences not that they were twenty years ago in
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:19.560]  1990 and 89 and basically the the veil lifted and I saw the world in a
[1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:25.680]  completely different way and I started on a journey of research which has led
[1:45:25.680 --> 1:45:33.480]  me over 20 years to a very obvious conclusion that this world is controlled
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:38.640]  by very very few people behind the people we think are in power and they
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:43.480]  have a very very malevolent agenda for humanity as a whole who to them are
[1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:49.080]  nothing more than cattle. It doesn't take any brain cells on active duty to
[1:45:49.080 --> 1:45:52.400]  realize that we are at a fault in the road we can no longer stand there
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:57.600]  staring at the map thinking which way do I go because we're facing in the next
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:02.280]  few years enormous challenges which we can't cope with and who comes through
[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:06.120]  and this control system is coming down and coming down tomorrow. When I started
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:12.040]  talking about this information 20 years ago you could hardly get anyone to look
[1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:17.440]  at it and in terms of public events I couldn't fill a phone booth but over
[1:46:17.440 --> 1:46:21.320]  the last 20 years there's been demonstrably blatantly obviously a
[1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:26.560]  fantastic awakening and it's getting faster and faster all the time. I first
[1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:33.280]  of all noticed a big change after 9-11 although the vast majority of people
[1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:37.800]  bought the official line there was something about it that started to get
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:45.880]  others to think and come off the fence and when the weapons of mass
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:52.000]  destruction were not found in Iraq it was almost like a a confirmation you
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:55.880]  know people talk about well you must never believe what the government says
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:46:59.240]  you must never believe what the media says but so many people just go ahead
[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:05.320]  and do that and the lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq were like
[1:47:05.320 --> 1:47:12.280]  somebody reminding you see look governments lie and after 2003 and all
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:16.280]  that this awakening this this questioning of the world this
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:22.520]  questioning of authority got more and more blatant and as the police state and
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:27.320]  the Orwellian state is breaking the surface ever more obviously it's it's
[1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:32.200]  getting more and more people to see the world in a way that they wouldn't have
[1:47:32.200 --> 1:47:38.360]  done before and it's getting faster and faster and it's a it's a great time to
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:44.000]  to be doing what we're doing putting this information out and it's it's very
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:54.640]  very encouraging the whole conspiracy is founded on keeping humanity in a very
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:48:00.880]  very low level of perception perception about self perception about the world
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:06.040]  this is why we have the dumbing down of education this is why we have the
[1:48:06.040 --> 1:48:12.040]  controlled so-called information that comes through the media the idea is to
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:17.360]  keep people in ignorance of anything that would be a problem to the control
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:21.840]  system so we kept in ignorance about the nature of reality itself the nature
[1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:26.840]  of life itself who we are where we are what we're doing here we're kept in
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:33.120]  ignorance of the the true forces that are manipulating behind the people we
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:38.640]  see in the public arena like like we had eight years of Bush who was blatantly
[1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:42.800]  just a figurehead signing his name on the legislation and he's been replaced
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:46.920]  by Obama who is another blatant figurehead doing the same controlled by
[1:48:46.920 --> 1:48:51.720]  the same force ultimately that controlled bush now all these connections
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:59.240]  have to be kept from people so that we behave and perceive the world and
[1:48:59.240 --> 1:49:04.480]  everything in the way that suits the control system so any awakening any
[1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:10.880]  opening of the mind to see things that people didn't see before is a real big
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:17.680]  problem for the the conspiracy for the the manipulators and what we're seeing
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:22.840]  now is more and more people are awakening is is a almost a panic
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:28.880]  stricken attempt to put the lid on this to dumb people down and this is one
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:35.800]  reason why we're seeing the the ever-greater drugging of American
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:40.000]  children not just American children but but in the wider world too while we're
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:46.440]  seeing more and more these chemical cocktails in food that destabilized the
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:52.640]  the body's chemical balance and more and more electromagnetic pollution to
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:58.440]  destabilize the the body's electrical electromagnetic balance all of these
[1:49:58.440 --> 1:50:03.160]  things fundamentally affect the way people see the world and their ability
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:09.760]  to think sharply to think straight and to see the peripheral vision which you
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:15.120]  need to see what's actually going on they want us here and what an awakening
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:19.240]  mind does is start to do this and when you do that you start to connect dots
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:25.520]  that you can't actually see here what we're looking at now is an irresistible
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:30.760]  force I would suggest which is the the gathering awakening of humanity coming
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:35.240]  face-to-face with what thinks it's the immovable object the conspiracy but
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:38.880]  isn't as we'll see although it's going to take some years before that becomes
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:44.520]  obvious and and so we're at this fork in the road where I stop right there at
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:47.360]  the fork in the road I'm gonna come back play five more minutes of this then
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:50.840]  I'm gonna break down the rush limbaugh situation when we go live at prison
[1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:55.160]  planet dot TV we're live on the radio but this also becomes a television show
[1:50:55.160 --> 1:50:59.800]  not just a webcam but a fully produced television show for prison planet dot TV
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:05.760]  members hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:09.400]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:12.860]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[1:51:12.860 --> 1:51:16.760]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:20.520]  before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:24.120]  friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:29.400]  hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:33.440]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part
[1:51:33.440 --> 1:51:37.440]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way you actually get
[1:51:37.440 --> 1:51:41.520]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at

[1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:16.760]  we're at this fork in the road where people have to choose are they gonna go
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:23.880]  on being controlled sheep and robots of the control system or are they gonna
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:27.760]  wake up and take the road to freedom that's the fork in the road and that's
[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:31.680]  the choice that people are facing now and will face ever more blatantly in the
[1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:38.040]  next few years when you look at the the bloodline families and the control
[1:54:38.040 --> 1:54:44.680]  system that they oversee it seems that they are all powerful they control the
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:48.200]  media ownership level and the key positions within it they control the
[1:54:48.200 --> 1:54:53.320]  corporations the cartels of oil of pharmaceuticals etc. they control the
[1:54:53.320 --> 1:55:00.720]  the forces of law enforcement and the military ultimately but one thing they
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:07.000]  don't control is the numbers this is what humanity has it has vast numbers of
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:11.840]  people enormous numbers of people compared with those at the core of the
[1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:14.760]  control system that actually know exactly what they're doing what the
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:19.520]  agenda is they are tiny in number compared with what is now supposed to be
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:29.040]  7 billion people on the planet so one of the agendas to bring this under greater
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:34.120]  control for them is to massively cull the population they want to reduce the
[1:55:34.120 --> 1:55:44.640]  numbers now if you if you want to remove lots of people you can do it by
[1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:50.600]  injecting stuff into people's arms and they just keel over dead but if you do
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:55.080]  that and of course there is some of that that goes on but if you do that are the
[1:55:55.080 --> 1:55:58.920]  other people lined up are gonna say excuse me I ain't having whatever they've
[1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:06.360]  had so you do it in a more subtle way and you target the defense mechanism that
[1:56:06.360 --> 1:56:12.680]  everyone has called the immune system for instance people don't die of AIDS
[1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:17.960]  they die of AIDS related disease which are diseases that the immune system
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:24.160]  before it becomes shot would have defended the body from so all the time
[1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:29.960]  now we're having the immune system targeted not least among children and
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:39.000]  young people by vaccinations by food additives and drink additives etc and if
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:43.800]  we just think about this I mean it's so blatant if we people just take a deep
[1:56:43.800 --> 1:56:48.680]  breath and take a step back and look at it with a bit of peripheral vision we
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:54.680]  have a situation now not just in America but in Britain and the wider world
[1:56:54.680 --> 1:57:06.480]  where between birth and about two years of age we're having children be given
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:15.960]  25 and rising different vaccinations and combinations of them poured in all this
[1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:23.280]  these chemical cocktails that destabilize the body but more important
[1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:31.920]  than that they have to be dealt with by a still developing immune system so the
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:37.000]  immune system still developing it's still coming up to optimum efficiency and
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:45.920]  suddenly this tidal wave of chemical concoctions is thrown at it and has to
[1:57:45.920 --> 1:57:50.600]  deal with it as it's deal dealing with one suddenly another one comes 25
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:57.200]  vaccinations over the first two years of life it is by any level of common sense
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:58:02.000]  it's ludicrous and it's meant to be ludicrous because it's target targeting
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:06.560]  the immune systems of young children which because it's done at a developing
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:11.840]  time of the immune system rewires destabilizes it imbalances it for the
[1:58:11.840 --> 1:58:16.640]  rest of their lives those kids immune system will never be as efficient as
[1:58:16.640 --> 1:58:23.760]  it would have been otherwise my son he's now 16 he's never had a vaccination he's
[1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:29.360]  six foot five incredibly healthy never had a childhood disease and his mates
[1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:34.200]  at school and childhood diseases they have the whole living life we'll be

[2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:52.280]  with hurricanes at 30 year low Gore turns to Photoshop and when you click on it
[2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:59.000]  which will do live on air when you click on it it takes you to an article
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:04.160]  written by Paul Joseph Watson today now Limbaugh has talked to it but talked
[2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:07.880]  about us quite a few times generally in a negative light we were criticizing
[2:01:07.880 --> 2:01:12.560]  George W. Bush as a new order puppet and he's criticized this for believing
[2:01:12.560 --> 2:01:16.880]  there's a world government being set up but Limbaugh's got a problem now the New
[2:01:16.880 --> 2:01:21.160]  York Times the Associated Press Financial Times Reuters Wall Street Journal
[2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:25.640]  they're all announcing a private world government is being set up and they're
[2:01:25.640 --> 2:01:30.960]  going to fund the world government with carbon taxes well Limbaugh is right and
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:35.120]  then he's against carbon taxes and so thank you Rush Limbaugh thank you for
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:39.200]  linking to the article it's a very strange feeling to start getting calls
[2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:43.880]  at about noon today from listeners that happened to hear Rush Limbaugh for large
[2:01:43.880 --> 2:01:49.040]  parts of the first hour of his show read the article by Paul Joseph Watson from
[2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:53.840]  prisonplanet.com and that article of course is up at prisonplanet.com with
[2:01:53.840 --> 2:02:00.280]  hurricanes at 30 year low Gore turns to photoshop photoshopping in photographs
[2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:05.920]  of more hurricanes and in fact click on the article from prisonplanet.com we
[2:02:05.920 --> 2:02:11.800]  can scroll down and show people the photoshopped photos and Gore of course
[2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:16.560]  used fake graphs showing that after carbon dioxide is released in higher
[2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:21.720]  levels that then the earth warms he actually flipped the graphs when the
[2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:26.560]  official graphs came out in the months after his film the inconvenient fraud I
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:32.000]  mean the inconvenient truth it was pointed out that they had doctored the
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:37.560]  graphs all the major universities all the major governments it was a fraud when
[2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:41.960]  the earth gets warmer it releases more carbon dioxide out of the ocean out of
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:46.080]  the ice pack there's more life more plant life more plankton more photo
[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:52.440]  plankton they release more oxygen more carbon dioxide that are the two life
[2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:58.320]  giving gases plants operate off carbon dioxide it's not a poison is Barack
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:02.480]  Obama and the UN have said that's a lie believe me plants to breathe it plants to
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:07.320]  exist not a conspiracy theory and mankind moon exists the secretary general of the
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:12.720]  UN calling for world government two weeks ago the New York Times and an
[2:03:12.720 --> 2:03:15.840]  editorial publishing papers are all over the country and all the world but in
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:20.360]  New York Times mainly biggest paper in the world and saying the carbon tax will
[2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:29.600]  fund the world government the carbon tax will fund the world government so rush
[2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:34.320]  limbaugh glenbeck and many others are now being forced Hannity still won't do
[2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:37.680]  it he says none of it exists he says he wants to have microchips put in all
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:42.240]  children I had that clip in police state three total enslavement he says all
[2:03:42.240 --> 2:03:47.200]  militias should be arrested I mean Hannity is really a piece of work and
[2:03:47.200 --> 2:03:51.360]  he's really discrediting himself not covering the real issues and still
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:57.600]  running around denying that all of this is happening but very very strange to
[2:03:57.600 --> 2:04:02.480]  have a rush limbaugh link to as his top story and punch that back up for people
[2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:09.000]  his top story and his top story on the radio today to 20 plus million
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:16.240]  listeners was prison planet with hurricanes at 30 year low gore turns to
[2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:21.760]  Photoshop so no doubt that our stories go viral every day but this will go
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:26.160]  mega viral not only is it on his highly rated website but it's on his number one
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:31.800]  rated radio show I don't think we're out of the woods yet though I know we're not
[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:38.240]  because senator in half is declaring victory saying that there has been a
[2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:44.600]  defeat of the climate bill crowd when it's about to go to the full Senate and
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:48.880]  it doesn't matter because the states like California are implementing the
[2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:53.640]  carbon taxes regardless and the bureaucracies federally are implementing
[2:04:53.640 --> 2:04:57.160]  them regardless of whether Congress passes it or not we'll be right back
[2:04:57.160 --> 2:05:03.080]  after this quick break right here on the GCN radio network the illusion created
[2:05:03.080 --> 2:05:07.600]  by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat will

[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:40.160]  story on the radio top story at rush limbaugh calm being the present planet
[2:08:40.160 --> 2:08:47.240]  calm article why hurricanes with hurricanes at 30 year low gore turns to
[2:08:47.240 --> 2:08:51.440]  Photoshop the king of cap and trade simply airbrushes them into his new
[2:08:51.440 --> 2:08:56.480]  book to create a more scary earth now tarpoli to give you an idea how big
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:00.040]  limbaugh is tarpoli was listening to limbaugh he heard some of it today
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:04.960]  reportedly this went on for a long time so he can tell us about that and it's
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:09.840]  an interesting history lesson in why limbaugh's doing this I asked tarpoli
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:13.400]  why he thought limbaugh was doing it it concurred exactly with what I was
[2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:17.440]  about to tell tarpoli but I wanted to see what he thought about political
[2:09:17.440 --> 2:09:23.760]  coloration how like a hermit crab will pick up some you know different types
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:28.680]  of coral and actually planet on its shell as camouflage then we're gonna get
[2:09:28.680 --> 2:09:33.160]  into the dollar the crash that tarpoli's been predicting for over a decade by the
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:37.080]  way we sell his book about the the coming cataclysm that's excellent
[2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:41.920]  definitive then we're gonna get I'll get into the latest geopolitical warmongering
[2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:45.880]  going on with us today that Alan combs coming up for a little bit of a
[2:09:45.880 --> 2:09:52.080]  discussion and lively debate next hour so stay with us today Webster you've got
[2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:57.720]  the floor let's get into the limbaugh situation first well rush limbaugh is an
[2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:02.800]  I would call him an agent of the Mount Pelerin society and specifically of one
[2:10:02.800 --> 2:10:07.360]  of the attendees of the mountain society and that was William F. Buckley junior
[2:10:07.360 --> 2:10:12.360]  the right wing CIA and if you remember when when William F. Buckley the national
[2:10:12.360 --> 2:10:17.480]  review guy died limbaugh was in mourning for several weeks and he went into great
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:22.040]  detail about how Mr. Buckley made me what I am today and he introduced me to
[2:10:22.040 --> 2:10:28.320]  Henry Kissinger and he made me great and so forth so this is obviously a very
[2:10:28.320 --> 2:10:32.760]  dubious character now the problem that limbaugh faces if you if you've had
[2:10:32.760 --> 2:10:38.720]  these these be recent tea party march on September 12th and then the slightly
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:42.760]  smaller one that took place recently limbaugh is concerned to keep that
[2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:47.320]  within the Republican Party a lot of people were calling limbaugh and Hannity
[2:10:47.320 --> 2:10:51.360]  for that matter and saying we want a third party we're sick of both parties the
[2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:55.320]  Republicans are just as bad as the Democrats a plague on both your houses
[2:10:55.320 --> 2:10:59.720]  let's build towards a third party and you can hear limbaugh scrambling saying no
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:05.160]  no no that's just another recipe to make the Democrats stronger so what do you
[2:11:05.160 --> 2:11:10.240]  tell us Hannity Hannity saying the same thing every day on his TV shows stay
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:15.120]  with the Republicans so now they have to act like they're us to try to keep their
[2:11:15.120 --> 2:11:19.680]  people yes they've got to radicalize themselves and of course in order to
[2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:23.240]  have a more radical and a more coherent analysis we're better to go than to you
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:27.920]  and therefore they they bring this up so he's he's essentially packing a little
[2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:32.920]  bit in a radical anti-establishment anti-globalist direction to get some
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:37.400]  street creds because otherwise a lot of these are the tea party people listen
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:41.360]  to them they say what you're for free trade you're a you know you're a war
[2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:44.560]  monger you're supporting the Republicans you you know you were a
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:50.080]  lapdog for Bush you discovered deficits with with Obama but back in the day of
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:53.920]  Bush it was Cheney telling us that deficits don't matter that Reagan had
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:57.840]  proved the deficits don't matter so I think it's it's bad it's a purely
[2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:01.880]  opportunistic demagogic thing but it's also a tribute to the fact that your
[2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:11.680]  influence is growing Webster the dollar is plunging as you predicted I was
[2:12:11.680 --> 2:12:15.360]  eating when you were talking I'm here on TV with a mouthful of food take me off
[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:24.440]  there guys Webster you were predicting this a very long time ago now the
[2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:31.840]  dollar has plunged a record lows gold is exploding and soaring to new highs will
[2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:35.720]  you explain to people what's happening and and what this is going to do to them
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:40.120]  if we don't reverse the tide and and take control of this political system
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:44.320]  well we just had Secretary Geithner right tiny Tim was testifying in the
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:49.520]  Congress today and what of course he has done along with Summers and Volcker and
[2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:54.400]  Bernanke is that they've kept the US interest rates at zero you can borrow if
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:58.240]  you're a bank not not a person like us but if you're a bank you can borrow at
[2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:01.640]  zero percent from the Federal Reserve and what they've done with that is create
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:06.440]  something called the dollar carry trade you borrow at zero percent from the Fed
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:11.240]  and then you take that to some extremely risky speculative market be it in
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:17.280]  Poland or Ukraine or Turkey or Indonesia wherever it is whatever emerging
[2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:21.480]  market is the hottest you take it there and you speculate like mad but is it
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:24.800]  every time you do that that puts it downward pressure on the dollar because
[2:13:24.800 --> 2:13:29.040]  somebody's borrowing dollars and then selling them to get this other currency
[2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:33.560]  so the dollar goes down down down now there were other factors working right
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:38.080]  the fact that they've put out this 24 trillion dollar bailout from the
[2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:43.280]  Treasury the Fed and the FDIC that's also playing a role so we've now reached
[2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:47.600]  a very dangerous point there are two things that could happen one would be a
[2:13:47.600 --> 2:13:53.320]  dollar panic out there in the world that is coming out of the Kuala Lumpur or
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:58.160]  someplace in Africa or someplace in Latin America somebody decides that
[2:13:58.160 --> 2:14:01.560]  they're a little bit heavy on dollars and they want to lighten up and that leads
[2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:05.680]  to some kind of a of a panic or a military event could be to a panic or
[2:14:05.680 --> 2:14:11.560]  if Obama catches the flu that could lead to a panic it has done so in the
[2:14:11.560 --> 2:14:15.440]  not-so-distant past but that's one way you could get a kind of panic coming out
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:19.240]  of the world the other thing is there are Treasury auctions next week there's
[2:14:19.240 --> 2:14:23.160]  going to be a hundred and eighteen billion dollars of five and seven year
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:28.360]  Treasury paper put on the market now what happens if people don't buy those if
[2:14:28.360 --> 2:14:32.440]  there are not big enough for all of it or above all if if the interest rate
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:36.640]  jumps way up and uh... and that turns out to be a disaster now that's not
[2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:40.160]  hypothetical that happened to the British back in March of this year the
[2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:44.640]  British had a guilt auction g ilt right the British Treasury paper and they
[2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:48.000]  couldn't sell all of it and people said at that point will this mean the Great
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:53.480]  Britain is bankrupt so the obvious way to get out of this would be to raise the
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:58.240]  interest rates which Bernanke could do but if he raises the interest rates to
[2:14:58.240 --> 2:15:02.200]  attract hot money back into the dollar in fact he was under pressure as you
[2:15:02.200 --> 2:15:06.880]  know at a conference on Monday and in a speech he said look I'm not worried
[2:15:06.880 --> 2:15:10.960]  about the dollar dropping I'm worried about interest rates and I'm going to
[2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:15.640]  keep him low they're doing that so they can continue the speculative carry trade
[2:15:15.640 --> 2:15:18.880]  aren't they yes but of course he does have to worry about the dollar and he
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:22.040]  really does right he's talking through his hat as these characters always do
[2:15:22.040 --> 2:15:25.640]  they're very concerned about the dollar and they know that if the dollar keeps
[2:15:25.640 --> 2:15:29.320]  going we might get into one of these irreversible mudslides where it just
[2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:34.200]  starts going down and then there's nothing they can do to get out of it
[2:15:34.200 --> 2:15:37.120]  in other words a worldwide dollar panic and that would lead them to hyper
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:42.360]  inflation if you tell people boil it down in layman's terms we know the
[2:15:42.360 --> 2:15:46.800]  leadership we have we know they're not gonna listen to your solutions so what
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:50.760]  is going to unfold Webster well in terms of the hyperinflation if the dollar goes
[2:15:50.760 --> 2:15:56.280]  down 20 or 30 percent then remember everything in this country is imported
[2:15:56.280 --> 2:16:00.840]  this is a deindustrialized rubble field of a post-industrial society that we
[2:16:00.840 --> 2:16:04.720]  have here everything is imported and if the dollar goes down that means the
[2:16:04.720 --> 2:16:08.800]  prices on all those imports go up so that and gets you into the realm of
[2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:14.040]  hyperinflation now here's what I think they're gonna try to do the one way to
[2:16:14.040 --> 2:16:17.840]  get out of that bond right in other words it's either gonna be a zero percent
[2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:21.880]  rate and the dollar goes down down down or raise the interest rates and you
[2:16:21.880 --> 2:16:26.040]  you collapse the stock market and you get a panic in a different way the only
[2:16:26.040 --> 2:16:31.280]  way out of that is some kind of outside event now remember 1973-74 we had a
[2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:35.760]  fake oil crisis which was designed to soak up the dollars in the world and
[2:16:35.760 --> 2:16:40.400]  stabilize the dollar that was done by Kissinger with that six-day war later on
[2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:45.400]  in 79 when Brzezinski brought down the shot and installed Comainy we had
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:51.320]  another oil crisis so 73 74 79 I think that's somehow the model for what might
[2:16:51.320 --> 2:16:55.840]  occur right now in other words you must have the oil run up I mean I'm sorry to
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:16:58.840]  interrupt it wasn't the oil run up of a year and a half two years ago
[2:16:58.840 --> 2:17:03.240]  engineered as well to soak up dollars yes and that but of course that was the
[2:17:03.240 --> 2:17:07.080]  speculative activity of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in other words that's
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:11.400]  the London I see exchange and they're trying to do that again and the price
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:15.320]  of of oil is indeed creeping up maybe not today but but pretty much
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:21.000]  continuous okay so finish the point I interrupted but the thing now is Wall
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:26.560]  Street believes that if some shocking spectacular event right a false flag a
[2:17:26.560 --> 2:17:32.280]  Gulf of Tonkin a war in some strategically critical area or some kind of
[2:17:32.280 --> 2:17:37.640]  big scare many types of things would do they think that there's the flight to
[2:17:37.640 --> 2:17:43.040]  safe haven the flight to safety and they believe still that if the world seems
[2:17:43.040 --> 2:17:47.720]  to be descending into chaos hot money will fly to New York and that would then
[2:17:47.720 --> 2:17:52.360]  prop up the dollar and some at least short to medium term way and therefore
[2:17:52.360 --> 2:17:56.720]  you have to look at what that might be now that I was on Russia today yesterday
[2:17:56.720 --> 2:18:01.160]  and they're asking me about this bomb in Peshawar Pakistan a couple of weeks ago
[2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:07.320]  where the Taliban the Pakistani Taliban are saying that they didn't do this and
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:12.640]  that this was done by the US the CIA and specifically Blackwater and we had a
[2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:17.440]  couple of weeks also we had this Balochistan bomb with the Iranians said
[2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:22.320]  that the CIA did that one too so you look at Pakistan Pakistan is now pretty
[2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:26.840]  much in a full-scale civil war the Pakistani army has been winning in
[2:18:26.840 --> 2:18:30.840]  South Waziristan but I don't know if they're winning everywhere and generally
[2:18:30.840 --> 2:18:35.160]  the level of fighting is increasing and you've got to remember that the Taliban
[2:18:35.160 --> 2:18:40.840]  in Pakistan are a pure proxy of the US they're run pretty much by the CIA or
[2:18:40.840 --> 2:18:45.040]  they're directed and and used they're an asset of the CIA so we have a funny
[2:18:45.040 --> 2:18:49.520]  situation in Pakistan the Chinese are supporting the central government in
[2:18:49.520 --> 2:18:53.880]  Islamabad and the US is supporting any force that wants to wage civil war
[2:18:53.880 --> 2:18:59.760]  against the Pakistani government now suppose the Taliban do what these
[2:18:59.760 --> 2:19:03.160]  neocons have been talking about for so many years they get their hands on some
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:07.240]  of those Pakistani nukes whether they can use them or not that might be the
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:11.200]  kind of great fear the shock out in the world that would do it another
[2:19:11.200 --> 2:19:16.240]  possibility there's a civil war going on in Yemen and in this civil war the
[2:19:16.240 --> 2:19:21.040]  Iranians are on one side and the Saudis are on the other side the Iranians are
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:25.480]  backing a rebel group and the Saudis I guess are backing the the government of
[2:19:25.480 --> 2:19:28.720]  Yemen whatever that is and there have been clashes there have been also
[2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:33.160]  incidents on the on the water in the Persian Gulf where Arabian Gulf where
[2:19:33.160 --> 2:19:37.880]  where the Saudis and the Iranians have clashed suppose you have military
[2:19:37.880 --> 2:19:42.760]  tension or a military clash between Iran and Saudi Arabia that's that's big
[2:19:42.760 --> 2:19:46.400]  stuff because that's your oil that would that would pump hot money back to
[2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:50.720]  New York stay there and we know Saudi Arabia is a client state of the US
[2:19:50.720 --> 2:19:56.520]  England and Israel we'll look at that geopolitical potential and a lot more

[2:22:06.800 --> 2:22:10.680]  world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms I get it you wouldn't
[2:22:10.680 --> 2:22:14.280]  buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that
[2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:18.320]  the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social
[2:22:18.320 --> 2:22:22.160]  security would be there for you that's not what's happening you might even pass
[2:22:22.160 --> 2:22:26.520]  on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar
[2:22:26.520 --> 2:22:30.280]  wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all looks
[2:22:30.280 --> 2:22:34.200]  rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold for the realists there have
[2:22:34.200 --> 2:22:38.960]  never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold since 2001 the US

[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:36.560]  or comment on your comments that is coming up and then Alan Combs I haven't
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:39.080]  even gotten into a bunch of the news today we've had so many informative
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:45.920]  guests okay short segment Webster we know that Saudi Arabia has been funding the
[2:24:45.920 --> 2:24:51.840]  US and asking the US for a long time to attack Iran why is Saudi Arabia after
[2:24:51.840 --> 2:24:55.560]  Iran just because they want to be the dominant force in the region and and and
[2:24:55.560 --> 2:25:00.000]  Saudi Arabia wants to be the dominant force why is there this long-standing
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:05.880]  is it because one is a is a separate group of Islam the majority group based
[2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:11.720]  out of Iran and we've got and based out of Saudi Arabia and we have the Shiites
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:15.480]  out of Iran I mean is that why this is happening yes it's partly religious
[2:25:15.480 --> 2:25:20.080]  right it's partly Iranian Shiites versus the the Wahhabites of Saudi Arabia but
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:24.840]  remember also when you had that long Iran Iraq war right that the US had
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:29.200]  provoked there was this thing called the Gulf Cooperation Council which was
[2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:33.320]  Saudi Arabia and all the little Gulf Emirates which had been British puppet
[2:25:33.320 --> 2:25:38.400]  states and they were supporting Iraq against Iran so there's quite a bit of
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:43.880]  a bad blood and naturally the Saudis feel that Yemen is on their side of the
[2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:47.640]  of the Gulf right and therefore they should be the the preponderant power
[2:25:47.640 --> 2:25:51.920]  but the Iranians are are interested in meddling now this this public is asking
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:57.000]  real quick hold on what is the real relationship is is Saudi Arabia still a
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:02.640]  purely puppet state of Anglo-American oil of the Anglo-American slash Dutch
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:07.520]  interest or is it now because you talked about that Russia trip that there
[2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:11.120]  may be some shifting yeah there's a there's this this question of Prince
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:15.520]  Bondar what happened to Prince Bondar where is he this is Bondar Bush for a
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:19.960]  long time he was considered to be the chief of the pro-US party this is the
[2:26:19.960 --> 2:26:24.800]  guy that spent 9 11 afternoon and evening with Bush in the White House but
[2:26:24.800 --> 2:26:28.760]  we had in August reports that Prince Bondar now the head of the National
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:33.240]  Security Council had attempted a coup d'etat in terms of at least the royal
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:36.680]  succession that had been placed under house arrest and then we went back and
[2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:40.720]  looked at what what did Prince Bondar been doing lately and it was meetings
[2:26:40.720 --> 2:26:45.320]  with Putin trips to Russia cooperation with Russia and that all of that
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:49.960]  necessarily means is that Saudi Arabia wants to be balanced not a complete
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:55.360]  puppet state and client state of the US not locked in the in the deadly grip of
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:26:59.760]  Wall Street but that they'd like to have other options of course that's what the
[2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:04.480]  Wall Street characters cannot accept so I think the the internal situation of
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:09.400]  of Saudi Arabia worse is worth looking at here's the other thing the Hajj right
[2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:13.320]  the great Muslim pilgrimage is coming now at the end of this month it's
[2:27:13.320 --> 2:27:17.760]  basically within the land next seven to ten days you'll have the people going
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:23.040]  to Mecca and possibly Medina and then leaving now remember thirty years ago
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:27.440]  when the big new Brzezinski was in the National Security Council we had a
[2:27:27.440 --> 2:27:34.360]  fanatical group an armed group of about a hundred fighters take control of the
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:38.360]  Kaaba right there at the central holy site of Islam and start shooting and
[2:27:38.360 --> 2:27:43.160]  there was a an armed confrontation that went on for the best part of a of a
[2:27:43.160 --> 2:27:47.040]  week or two and that's what you got to think about what what kind of an event
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:51.840]  like that if you had it if you had a repetition of that November 1979 attack
[2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:58.240]  on on Mecca that I think would would tend to a to shock the world and people
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:01.520]  would wonder about the stability of Saudi Arabia and a whole lot of dollars
[2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:06.000]  would flee back to New York under this this safe haven I call this operation
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:10.320]  safe haven and I'm wondering if this is the card that Wall Street wants to play
[2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:14.920]  you could also have a coup d'etat in Saudi Arabia and this could be this could
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:19.880]  be sponsored by the US remember in in the Carter administration Brzezinski was
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:24.560]  the mastermind of the ouster of the Shah and bringing in Khomeini now what
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:28.520]  if that happens to the Saudis I think some of the Saudis realize they may be
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:32.560]  candidates for that and therefore they may be thinking let's try to get the
[2:28:32.560 --> 2:28:35.960]  Russians in here or the Chinese or somebody else so that we have somebody
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:40.720]  to turn to if the Obama administration tries to foment a coup in this way now
[2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:44.360]  some of this is speculation but maybe not so much if there was a coup attempt in
[2:28:44.360 --> 2:28:51.360]  August there might be another one soon but bottom line the establishment needs
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:56.840]  global crises they they need to stage events could that be stage terror here
[2:28:56.840 --> 2:29:01.120]  in the United States could it be staged terror in Europe could it be a new war
[2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:05.200]  with Russia like we saw with 888 I mean are there other things you see on the
[2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:09.720]  horizon that the doctrine currently and this is what Brzezinski says is the
[2:29:09.720 --> 2:29:14.960]  US cannot cannot become directly militarily engaged so they want to use
[2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:19.160]  puppet kamikaze it's enough you gotta play the play the other countries one
[2:29:19.160 --> 2:29:23.760]  against the other that's why this idea of a conflict between Saudi Arabia and
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:29.080]  Iran over Yemen is such an attractive idea for these people we've also got to
[2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:33.160]  remember Obama is going to escalate the Afghan war very soon I want to remind
[2:29:33.160 --> 2:29:37.800]  people about that interesting anti-war demonstration in Lafayette Park at the

[2:35:04.360 --> 2:35:08.080]  them I independently thought the one he wants to be a winner I've already
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:11.920]  thought that that was best but I'm enough of that let's get to the really
[2:35:11.920 --> 2:35:15.840]  serious issues but this is serious I mean we have these contest hundreds and
[2:35:15.840 --> 2:35:19.320]  hundreds of videos get made some will get hundreds of thousands of views some
[2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:25.800]  tens of thousands and you reach millions of people and now they see the 20
[2:35:25.800 --> 2:35:30.000]  key bullet points of 9-11 being an inside job okay going back to Webster
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:35.120]  Griffin Tarpley best-selling author doctor of history and economics Webster
[2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:42.840]  finishing up today with the geopolitical developments if they're not able to carry
[2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:47.520]  this new war in the Middle East through what will they then turn to from your
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:54.200]  strategic over the horizon eagle-eye view a b let's shift gears in closing into
[2:35:54.200 --> 2:36:00.520]  cap and trade and your deep research of that well the I think the the thing to
[2:36:00.520 --> 2:36:04.440]  look at is this wave of Islamophobia that we have we talked about this last
[2:36:04.440 --> 2:36:09.320]  time we have major Hassan the forward hood patsy and more stuff every day
[2:36:09.320 --> 2:36:14.400]  about what a patsy he is just more details the concept is he's a patsy but
[2:36:14.400 --> 2:36:20.280]  remember back in the August we had this guy's body between Queens and Denver he
[2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:26.200]  wanted to blow up New York he was this radical mosque in Flushing Queens now
[2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:30.360]  we've got the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed trial right this psychotic patsy and
[2:36:30.360 --> 2:36:35.320]  and Baker and his confrere are going to go on trial in New York we've got the
[2:36:35.320 --> 2:36:41.000]  seizure of the so-called Iranian mosque mosque that are accused of being the
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:46.160]  property of bank Mellie and the a lobby foundation of Iran and there's one right
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:50.720]  down here in Potomac Maryland at the it's a school 150 or 200 kids go there
[2:36:50.720 --> 2:36:56.120]  and the feds are are seizing it you've also got the new governor of Virginia
[2:36:56.120 --> 2:37:01.920]  Mc donnell he's a reactionary Republican and he's owned by this guy Pat Robertson
[2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:06.280]  the religious leader if that's what we can call it Pat Robertson has
[2:37:06.280 --> 2:37:10.880]  been making very incendiary statements that Islam is not a religion it's a
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:15.200]  it's a terrible social doctrine and he takes it quite far you put all this
[2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:20.280]  together we've got an orchestrated wave of Islamophobia now I don't think this
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:25.080]  is going in the direction that a neocon would like best I think it's going to be
[2:37:25.080 --> 2:37:29.480]  more of a brzezinski type direction I think Pakistan is likely to be the
[2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:33.440]  target along with Afghanistan you could say a lot of this orchestration is to
[2:37:33.440 --> 2:37:39.160]  push Obama to finally stop dithering and and make the commitment to a massive
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:43.840]  escalation in Afghanistan but nothing beyond that no new wars those are the
[2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:50.920]  Iraq and Afghanistan or all the US can handle now after that well ultimately
[2:37:50.920 --> 2:37:56.640]  there will be either a deflationary crash or a hyperinflationary event and it
[2:37:56.640 --> 2:38:01.560]  seems to me that the hyperinflationary one is by far the most likely given
[2:38:01.560 --> 2:38:05.160]  what what most governments around the world are doing so that is more or less
[2:38:05.160 --> 2:38:08.640]  what Obama said yesterday right he said that we could have a double-dip
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:13.040]  depression or double-dip recession in his term so they're basically warning you
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:18.160]  now that we're no longer in the springtime of green shoots but now by the
[2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:22.160]  way over two years ago you said that on air you said we're gonna have a big
[2:38:22.160 --> 2:38:26.520]  recession going into depression they're gonna have a huge stimulus say that
[2:38:26.520 --> 2:38:29.400]  everything's fine and then as soon as they've spent that money they're gonna
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:33.800]  come back again you were absolutely right Webster well at this point you have to
[2:38:33.800 --> 2:38:37.240]  look at what could the Federal Reserve do for them the Federal Reserve can't go
[2:38:37.240 --> 2:38:41.800]  much below zero although in theory they could they could actually pay banks they
[2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:45.840]  could have negative interest rates where they pay back to take the money and and
[2:38:45.840 --> 2:38:50.280]  speculate with it the other thing is in terms of getting another bailout and I'm
[2:38:50.280 --> 2:38:55.560]  talking top I'm talking the bailout to the Wall Street banks I don't see how
[2:38:55.560 --> 2:39:00.400]  this could be done politically at this time given the terrible experiences that
[2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:04.320]  we've had so you see there's a lot of pressure on the Federal Reserve there are
[2:39:04.320 --> 2:39:09.200]  two congressmen today demanding that Geithner should quit two Republicans a
[2:39:09.200 --> 2:39:14.240]  couple of days ago Congressman DeFazio of Oregon demanded that Geithner should
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:19.240]  also quit so I think the finance establishment the Geithner Bernanke
[2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:22.880]  group and also would be with the campaign to audit them which would be a
[2:39:22.880 --> 2:39:27.600]  useful step in itself all of this is coming around and the Fed is
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:31.320]  really under fire you've also got some guy like Dodd who's trying to win an
[2:39:31.320 --> 2:39:36.040]  election in Connecticut thinks that he can look good by proposing to strip away
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:39.920]  a lot of the powers of the Fed now this is a this is a very rotten thing that
[2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:44.320]  that Dodd is doing but it shows you that the climate is anti Wall Street and I
[2:39:44.320 --> 2:39:48.320]  think that's that's fundamental we've also got a lot of momentum around the
[2:39:48.320 --> 2:39:53.520]  Tobin tax right the 1% tax on Wall Street and that's not that's not the Tobin
[2:39:53.520 --> 2:39:56.680]  tax that the French government wants that's the Tobin tax where the money
[2:39:56.680 --> 2:40:01.040]  goes to the US Treasury and the US state so you can keep your you can keep your
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:07.640]  schools and hospitals and police and firemen and basic services going
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:14.320]  cap and trade they're having Schwarzenegger announced in an extra
[2:40:14.320 --> 2:40:21.080]  legislative fashion here's associated press today that power hungry TVs will
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:24.960]  be banned from store shelves in California they're gonna put taxes on
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:29.680]  other ones they're gonna tax medical care they're gonna tax anything with a
[2:40:29.680 --> 2:40:33.960]  carbon dioxide footprint other states are adopting it through federal
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:40.160]  regulations that are outside of law they said health care wouldn't pass the
[2:40:40.160 --> 2:40:43.760]  house it did they're now saying cap and trade wouldn't pass the house it did
[2:40:43.760 --> 2:40:50.080]  they're still saying Diane Feinstein still saying in the next month by mid
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:53.720]  December they're gonna bring it out for a vote but then in Hoff and others are
[2:40:53.720 --> 2:41:00.520]  declaring the death of it I don't want to quote Mark Twain out of turn here but
[2:41:00.520 --> 2:41:05.240]  rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated I mean they're they're
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:09.280]  implementing it through the bureaucracy to begin with Europe's implementing and
[2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:13.040]  it's already happening I mean certainly the momentum is shifting the frauds
[2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:19.040]  coming out the polls show that the people aren't bamboozled anymore Al Gore is
[2:41:19.040 --> 2:41:25.640]  being exposed for you know doctoring data and and all this fraud but still it's a
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:28.760]  great danger but you were saying when I first talked to you today when before
[2:41:28.760 --> 2:41:35.920]  you went live that you do think it's in trouble now the Copenhagen managers are
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:39.960]  now saying at the UN headquarters as you know on Monday that okay we may not get
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:45.040]  it past this year kind of like the Lisbon Treaty give us the bottom line
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:49.280]  Webster in about four minutes on cap and fray this is really also another
[2:41:49.280 --> 2:41:54.840]  imperative task for all of us is to torpedo to stop this Copenhagen conference
[2:41:54.840 --> 2:41:58.520]  this is a monstrosity there's nothing good about this this is not like
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:01.520]  healthcare where there really is a problem and you really ought to do
[2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:05.720]  something but the question is what in the case of global warming it's a
[2:42:05.720 --> 2:42:10.160]  complete fraud the best thing is do absolutely nothing therefore we want
[2:42:10.160 --> 2:42:16.280]  gridlock now Obama is engaging in secret diplomacy I have a report that Obama
[2:42:16.280 --> 2:42:20.960]  had a secret meeting at the White House with a European diplomat who is
[2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:26.960]  prominent in the push for this global carbon dictatorship that they want to
[2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:32.600]  impose in Copenhagen I think it's this guy bore B O E R is that is sort of the
[2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:37.600]  he's the point manager of this entire thing so secret meetings by Obama and
[2:42:37.600 --> 2:42:43.560]  the idea is that the the Democratic leaders who are pushing this Pelosi
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:47.440]  and Reid are despairing that they can get this through the Congress before
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:52.440]  Copenhagen their original scenario was the US would pass a lunatic
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:57.720]  Malthusian cap and trade monstrosity that would then be taken by Obama in
[2:42:57.720 --> 2:43:01.760]  person to Copenhagen and he would beat the rest of the world over the head with
[2:43:01.760 --> 2:43:05.960]  this thing we in the US were backward under Bush but now we are more
[2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:09.800]  Malthusian than anybody else and therefore you have to do the same thing
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:14.000]  that is failing and I think that's what the secret diplomacy with Obama was
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:19.760]  about we also have their spiegel like the great German news magazine of the
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:24.680]  of the liberals and they are they're saying Obama has as fallen short he's
[2:43:24.680 --> 2:43:30.360]  really betrayed his promise to go with a binding cap and trade for the world at
[2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:34.240]  Copenhagen up part of this has to do with the fact the Chinese have said no
[2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:40.000]  no no right Boucher and the Indians have said no there's even a fight between the
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:46.480]  Indian environmental minister is fighting with these quack quack scientists in
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:51.880]  the US about whether the glaciers in the Himalayas are shrinking or not and the
[2:43:51.880 --> 2:43:56.400]  Himalayan the Indian guy says there's not any shrinkage that we can see but the
[2:43:56.400 --> 2:44:00.960]  US quack academics are saying oh no it's a serious shrinkage of the glaciers and
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:06.000]  therefore that's global warming I think if if the Indian front and the Chinese
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:10.560]  front can hold you've also had this thing with the Africans walked out of the
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:15.000]  Barcelona preparatory meetings saying you guys have forgotten about Africa what
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:19.240]  they're really angling for of course is economic development aid which they they
[2:44:19.240 --> 2:44:24.000]  have to mask under the guys of carbon so the big thing is that the
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:30.360]  US should not not pass any cap and trade carbon monstrosity before Copenhagen and
[2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:33.880]  there's a pretty good chance that it will that it will break up they'll have
[2:44:33.880 --> 2:44:38.760]  some kind of an interim accord and when they say wait till next year well next
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:43.640]  year it's gonna look different I think Obama will continue to subside let us
[2:44:43.640 --> 2:44:48.440]  say in US public opinion and Obama's ability to deliver that I think is is
[2:44:48.440 --> 2:44:54.320]  shrinking so well you're right webster that's what the gridlock yes that's what
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:58.160]  the founders said the gridlock is great not not a bad thing like the media says
[2:44:58.160 --> 2:45:03.640]  they want to just ram their dictatorship of this oligarchy through but
[2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:08.640]  looking at that the White House admits and and the UN admits and they all put
[2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:13.200]  out press releases saying we're desperate we've got to get all this done now
[2:45:13.200 --> 2:45:17.320]  because our little princeling is crashing and burning people are finding
[2:45:17.320 --> 2:45:20.840]  out he's a fraud you know they say it in political speech and I remember how a
[2:45:20.840 --> 2:45:28.080]  stutley you pointed out that Obama had a hundred to 200 days maximum before the
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:32.000]  fact that he was the maximum puppet and a betrayer of everything he said he was
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:36.960]  gonna do was exposed and so but he seems to be crashing and burning even
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:41.720]  faster than you or I would have thought or is that incorrect no I think it's
[2:45:41.720 --> 2:45:45.600]  correct and I think remember as soon as he makes this Afghanistan decision he's
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:50.240]  gonna lose a whole area of support on his left flank well that's why he's been
[2:45:50.240 --> 2:45:54.400]  dithering and kind of well I'll announce 40,000 next week but I won't really
[2:45:54.400 --> 2:45:58.480]  announce it well that's that December 12th Lafayette Park protest here's another
[2:45:58.480 --> 2:46:05.840]  one though this mammogram question that that group this US board that that put
[2:46:05.840 --> 2:46:11.200]  out this mammogram monstrosity that is a death board that's a death panel because
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:16.160]  they say women should not have mammograms until they're 50 and then every
[2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:21.800]  other year that has one name written all over it Peter or SAG Peter or SAG the
[2:46:21.800 --> 2:46:26.280]  head of the office of management and budget has been waging a personal
[2:46:26.280 --> 2:46:32.400]  crusade against tests he hates mammograms MRIs CAT scans nuclear stress
[2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:38.040]  test PSA you name the test or SAG wants to take it away this is very concrete
[2:46:38.040 --> 2:46:42.800]  and there's a lot of women who are you know center left you might say in
[2:46:42.800 --> 2:46:48.200]  mentality who now realize that what Obama is really into is a threat to their
[2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:52.360]  lives in the name of balancing the budget so we can have bigger and better
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:59.280]  bailouts for Wall Street through Webster Webster that's the issue is that they
[2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:04.640]  set up these panels it's in the bill the the author of the original bill
[2:47:04.640 --> 2:47:09.240]  Dashell wrote a book saying if you're 60 you don't need eye surgery I mean
[2:47:09.240 --> 2:47:13.480]  literally saying we're gonna ration your care and then on the other side of their
[2:47:13.480 --> 2:47:18.480]  mouth they try to deny it and now they want five years in prison quarter
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:22.680]  million dollar fine if you don't go get the insurance they say and they take
[2:47:22.680 --> 2:47:28.200]  money out of your check I mean this and you get a national ID card that you
[2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:34.240]  have to show everywhere so so it so it begins that centralization where do you
[2:47:34.240 --> 2:47:37.320]  think the healthcare bills going do you think we're gonna be able to stop it I
[2:47:37.320 --> 2:47:41.640]  recommend good luck once again this thing it's called the US Preventive
[2:47:41.640 --> 2:47:46.840]  Services Task Force now it doesn't call itself a deathboard but it is a death
[2:47:46.840 --> 2:47:51.000]  board and what they've done just the announcement they've made is going to
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:54.640]  cause deaths because the George Washington University clinic here in
[2:47:54.640 --> 2:47:58.960]  in town has announced that on the day after that report came out they had a
[2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:02.280]  whole bunch of women canceling their mammogram appointment saying well we
[2:48:02.280 --> 2:48:06.520]  don't really need it we've been assured by these authoritative voices this means
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:12.760]  Orsag went to Rahman Manuel and then they both went to Secretary Sebelius of HHS
[2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:16.320]  saying look we've got to get we've got to get some action we've got to cut down
[2:48:16.320 --> 2:48:21.560]  these mammograms because mammograms lead to biopsies and if you've seen the
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:26.640]  members of this board there was a woman called Gregory Dr. Gregory who was on
[2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:33.040]  Anderson Cooper on CNN and the the the other woman from the board anyway
[2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:36.360]  there are a number of them that have been on television they're all
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:40.280]  incompetent right they are Anderson Cooper they had a debate between Dr.
[2:48:40.280 --> 2:48:44.160]  Gregory and a guy from Harvard who really knew about the use of mammograms
[2:48:44.160 --> 2:48:48.840]  and she was reduced to stammering silence because this was a rotten
[2:48:48.840 --> 2:48:53.840]  political decision designed to save money again for Wall Street bailouts by
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:48:56.560]  cutting vital services that people really need
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:49:02.000]  we've got a success we've got to leave it there but but overall they are
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:06.280]  beginning to stall the people are learning they're not invincible and the
[2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:11.760]  entire collectivist big government corporate rating system is in trouble

[2:54:19.040 --> 2:54:24.440]  just wanted to say I know a lot of times before you talked about there's no laws
[2:54:24.440 --> 2:54:32.760]  state laws in Texas that you can't bear arms but man knows disgusting it's
[2:54:32.760 --> 2:54:38.720]  unconstitutional but in the Texas State Constitution it does give the state
[2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:42.120]  the right even though it's against the US Constitution to limit the wearing of
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:47.920]  arms and also there is a law against wearing arms in public I just wanted
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:53.400]  to let you know about that thank you hey good morning Alex I'm this is Chris
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:55:00.400]  from Houston Texas and I'm recently been eyes have been opened pretty and I
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:05.320]  really was interested me and I'm pretty far I don't know a lot of things with
[2:55:05.320 --> 2:55:10.680]  the chemtrail they were spraying a lot here yesterday and the day before just
[2:55:10.680 --> 2:55:16.160]  just letting them loose and you haven't haven't covered anything on the chem
[2:55:16.160 --> 2:55:20.440]  trail phenomenon lately and I was just curious to see if maybe you could have a
[2:55:20.440 --> 2:55:25.840]  someone come on and talk about the chemtrails or what not and act it
[2:55:25.840 --> 2:55:30.440]  because I've read one of your articles about the chemtrail the air sauce
[2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:36.840]  playing in the Ukraine when and then two days later the plague broke out so I
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:39.480]  just hope none of that stuff's going on I mean who knows what they're doing up
[2:55:39.480 --> 2:55:43.600]  there I mean but anyway I appreciate it and keep up the great work I love you
[2:55:43.600 --> 2:55:49.760]  show well we love you my friend okay let me answer those two questions I don't
[2:55:49.760 --> 2:55:53.480]  have the state law in front of me but I know you can have open carry in Texas
[2:55:53.480 --> 2:55:58.280]  it's just the police will come and harass you and it's open carry in almost
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:02.720]  every state in the country there are laws against concealed carry that's why
[2:56:02.720 --> 2:56:06.400]  they give you a permit for concealed carry because that's the only area they
[2:56:06.400 --> 2:56:09.920]  have jurisdiction over but I don't have it in front of me but I happen to know
[2:56:09.920 --> 2:56:15.960]  I actually got a book at home but it's a few years old the state gun laws in
[2:56:15.960 --> 2:56:20.720]  Texas and the same publisher puts them out for all 50 states but I guess we
[2:56:20.720 --> 2:56:27.040]  could pull up state gun laws open carry in Texas but how do you think people all
[2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:31.600]  in Texas the Black Panthers marching in Houston with loaded shotguns people in
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:36.240]  Arizona marching around with AR-15s people in Vermont doing it people in
[2:56:36.240 --> 2:56:41.120]  California doing it but people should check their laws to be sure first there
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:48.680]  were some laws I know back in the late 1800s early 1900s against wearing arms
[2:56:48.680 --> 2:56:53.480]  in bars because that was the old saloon days worried about drunk people shooting
[2:56:53.480 --> 2:56:58.600]  folks in some towns would pass laws about you got to stow your guns at the
[2:56:58.600 --> 2:57:02.800]  sheriff's office when you come into the county or the town but I believe you're
[2:57:02.800 --> 2:57:06.640]  mistaken sir I wish you would have quoted these supposed laws for me but
[2:57:06.640 --> 2:57:12.600]  that's something we can look into it's this ambiguity I was listening to a
[2:57:12.600 --> 2:57:16.680]  radio show this morning about Steven Seagal has some new cop TV show where
[2:57:16.680 --> 2:57:20.720]  he's actually a real cop of some town and they're pulling people over and
[2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:24.240]  they're arresting people and eat for guns and oh look he's got a gun in his car
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:29.200]  he's going to jail you can only do that what in New York City Chicago a few
[2:57:29.200 --> 2:57:35.240]  others you know either we have these rights or we don't you know in Texas 20
[2:57:35.240 --> 2:57:38.880]  years ago half the people had guns and their gun racks you don't see that now
[2:57:38.880 --> 2:57:44.200]  not because there's a law but because they will harass you we have to use our
[2:57:44.200 --> 2:57:48.520]  rights or we lose them that's how Jews were slowly intimidated to not have
[2:57:48.520 --> 2:57:52.400]  businesses and not have political organizations and not be able to sell
[2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:56.920]  products by Hitler you know he first treated them like third class citizens
[2:57:56.920 --> 2:58:00.320]  and then started arresting them and that's how tyranny works as for
[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:04.280]  chemtrails we talk about chemtrails every week you must have missed it the
[2:58:04.280 --> 2:58:08.400]  White House admits they've got a terraforming slash geo engineering
[2:58:08.400 --> 2:58:11.520]  program going on they say it's classified the details are but that they
[2:58:11.520 --> 2:58:15.640]  are spraying us and manipulating the weather and that's a whole other issue
[2:58:15.640 --> 2:58:22.160]  of them creating weather crises to then offer their political solution taxing
[2:58:22.160 --> 2:58:27.080]  carbon dioxide that plants live off of so we're gonna come back and play a few
[2:58:27.080 --> 2:58:35.240]  more clips and comment on those and then we've got Alan combs coming up I
[2:58:35.240 --> 2:58:40.640]  certainly look forward to that interview we'll be right back with the fourth and
[2:58:40.640 --> 2:58:53.200]  final hour you are listening to GCN visit GCN live com today this is Alex Jones
[2:58:53.200 --> 2:58:56.560]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:58:56.560 --> 2:59:00.760]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[2:59:00.760 --> 2:59:05.080]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[2:59:05.080 --> 2:59:09.040]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[2:59:09.040 --> 2:59:13.480]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[2:59:13.480 --> 2:59:17.720]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[2:59:17.720 --> 2:59:21.480]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[2:59:21.480 --> 2:59:25.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[2:59:25.600 --> 2:59:29.560]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[2:59:29.560 --> 2:59:33.400]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[2:59:33.400 --> 2:59:36.080]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[2:59:36.080 --> 2:59:41.040]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[2:59:41.040 --> 2:59:45.200]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government

[2:59:53.640 --> 3:00:03.320]  you've waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio networks you've
[3:00:03.320 --> 3:00:07.520]  reached the info wars comment line you've got 60 seconds for your question
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:13.880]  or comment 60 seconds and if it's good we'll put it on air hey Alex JT in
[3:00:13.880 --> 3:00:18.320]  Chicago just wanted to remind you when fighting this cap and trade and fighting
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:25.240]  this social health care just want to remind you that we just we aren't fighting
[3:00:25.240 --> 3:00:31.600]  for the Ponzi crony capitalist system status quo the Ponzi and crony system I
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:35.720]  like to call the crony system doesn't work for many of us anymore with the
[3:00:35.720 --> 3:00:43.040]  deindustrialization of our our nation and with the the heavy onset of illegal
[3:00:43.040 --> 3:00:47.720]  immigration the debt based system that enslaves many of us it's important to
[3:00:47.720 --> 3:00:52.480]  note that with all the people out there fighting for different causes we've got
[3:00:52.480 --> 3:00:57.640]  the constitutionalist like ourselves we got anarchists and socialists that when
[3:00:57.640 --> 3:01:01.120]  not fighting together we're all going in different directions so we all have to
[3:01:01.120 --> 3:01:06.080]  find some common ground quick quick shout out Chicago we are change quick
[3:01:06.080 --> 3:01:09.760]  plug for police state watch blood thanks this is Ken from Washington State
[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:13.840]  hey I just want to give you guys a heads up I'm looking around the web to see if
[3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:17.960]  you already know about it or where it might be reported on the internet but I
[3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:23.520]  just saw a blurb small blurb on CNN something about the White House is
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:28.840]  attempting to block Congress or dissuade them from doing any kind of probe into
[3:01:28.840 --> 3:01:33.520]  the Fort Hood shootings so I found that kind of interesting and I'm still
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:39.080]  waiting to hear the spin that CNN's gonna put on that what's going on and
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:46.040]  looking for it on the web but you might want to look into it bye well on that
[3:01:46.040 --> 3:01:51.960]  point I will comment I think the first callers statements are self-evident no
[3:01:51.960 --> 3:01:55.560]  need to comment on the second one yes they've declared national security
[3:01:55.560 --> 3:01:59.480]  Congress has been told under national security you're not allowed to
[3:01:59.480 --> 3:02:06.200]  investigate or even request information see under PDD 51 presidential
[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:10.320]  decision directive 51 it stated Congress has no authority over anything
[3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:15.920]  dealing with national security emergencies wars Congress passes the laws
[3:02:15.920 --> 3:02:20.800]  and orders the president around the founding fathers stated that Congress
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:24.120]  was the most powerful of three branches then they lied to the public said no
[3:02:24.120 --> 3:02:27.360]  they're co-equal now they say the president is above the courts in the
[3:02:27.360 --> 3:02:32.240]  Congress no it goes to the legislative the judicial the president the
[3:02:32.240 --> 3:02:36.880]  executive that's how our system works it's the Congress raises the money they
[3:02:36.880 --> 3:02:42.800]  declare war and then say here are your orders commander-in-chief just like the
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:48.480]  generals take orders from the legislature it's legislatures that levy war it was
[3:02:48.480 --> 3:02:52.120]  the continental Congress that started the the Revolutionary War it's the
[3:02:52.120 --> 3:02:57.040]  Congress it's elected by us our representatives of the states you have
[3:02:57.040 --> 3:03:04.040]  this transfer of power to the executive and the highest level security
[3:03:04.040 --> 3:03:07.120]  clearance members of Congress aren't allowed to see anything not even the
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:12.080]  entire text of PDD 51 then you have the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:17.280]  2007 that states that Homeland Security is for the states to oppress the states
[3:03:17.280 --> 3:03:22.360]  and the people I mean this is all stated Northcom is a criminal organization it's
[3:03:22.360 --> 3:03:27.600]  not our military that's bad it's the what they've set up as illegal and and
[3:03:27.600 --> 3:03:31.680]  they're covering up Fort Hood at every level Tarpley's written an incredible
[3:03:31.680 --> 3:03:35.440]  article detailing all the Patsy evidence there was a drill going on three
[3:03:35.440 --> 3:03:40.360]  shooters they said he was dead for six seven hours they knew he was planning all
[3:03:40.360 --> 3:03:44.240]  this supposedly when he was sending emails to Al Qaeda that were really going
[3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:48.760]  to the CIA because that is Al Qaeda and Fort Hood is definitely some type of
[3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:52.880]  staged event at bare minimum they knew he was going to do it let him do it I
[3:03:52.880 --> 3:03:56.680]  mean you badmouth Obama in the slightest way you get court-martialed or a
[3:03:56.680 --> 3:04:01.000]  dishonorable discharge this guy was running around for four years going
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:06.680]  wild on Bush Obama you name it and they let that guy do what he did and that's
[3:04:06.680 --> 3:04:10.080]  probably only just the beginning of it that's only the surface of this
[3:04:10.080 --> 3:04:13.600]  situation we're going to come back do a little bit of a news blitz some news on

[3:07:11.240 --> 3:07:15.960]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've
[3:07:15.960 --> 3:07:20.600]  turned in this influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:07:20.600 --> 3:07:26.120]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[3:07:26.120 --> 3:07:30.000]  pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:35.000]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[3:07:35.000 --> 3:07:39.120]  ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[3:07:39.120 --> 3:07:42.640]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[3:07:42.640 --> 3:07:47.880]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:53.560]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD
[3:07:53.560 --> 3:07:58.920]  at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[3:07:58.920 --> 3:08:08.040]  prison planet dot TV he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN
[3:08:08.040 --> 3:08:10.880]  radio network
[3:08:15.720 --> 3:08:20.160]  well we got Alan Cohn syndicated radio talk show host formerly panadien
[3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:25.160]  Jones joining us for a little bit of a discussion friendly debate I don't want
[3:08:25.160 --> 3:08:29.040]  to be enemies with him I disagree with him on almost everything it's coming up
[3:08:29.040 --> 3:08:33.720]  about five six minutes for the rest of the hour but I wanted to bring Ted
[3:08:33.720 --> 3:08:37.320]  Anderson up Ted what is it like for you I'm gonna put this up on screen for all
[3:08:37.320 --> 3:08:41.920]  the viewers that Rush Limbaugh spent a lot of an hour today reading a prison
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:46.800]  planet article by Paul Watson about Al Gore's global warming fraud where he's
[3:08:46.800 --> 3:08:53.080]  caught photo shopping and fake graphs and everything and linking to us he's
[3:08:53.080 --> 3:08:56.240]  attacked prison planet in the past and I know you said you listen to him some
[3:08:56.240 --> 3:09:00.520]  that he more and more sounding like us I see a video clips of him from the show
[3:09:00.520 --> 3:09:05.640]  online and he's talking about global corporations hijacking us that Obama
[3:09:05.640 --> 3:09:11.040]  wants to destroy America so he can make us all dependent I mean Limbaugh is I
[3:09:11.040 --> 3:09:15.520]  guess being forced to really start to tell the truth or he's gonna lose his
[3:09:15.520 --> 3:09:19.040]  audience see as long as we get the people to wake up everybody else will
[3:09:19.040 --> 3:09:22.880]  follow you educate the public about the new world order it's game over for the
[3:09:22.880 --> 3:09:27.440]  globalist well the deep part about it Alex is that the truth is very very very
[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:32.240]  popular and it's gone so far now that even the mainstream media have to pick
[3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:37.840]  it up and I just think it's just awesome to see your article front page
[3:09:37.840 --> 3:09:43.000]  rush Limbaugh.com I don't know how it can get better than that that's just well
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:47.920]  front page he doesn't usually have a giant headline it's like dun dun dun go
[3:09:47.920 --> 3:09:51.960]  to prisonplanet.com and he's attacked prison planet repeatedly other articles
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:58.160]  over the years so he knows he's linking to us very strange yeah I would say so
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:02.840]  and but like you said Alex it is very interesting to hear rush Limbaugh talk
[3:10:02.840 --> 3:10:08.360]  about the new world order I mean it is just an amazing turning point obviously
[3:10:08.360 --> 3:10:12.840]  we have an effect out there we're getting somewhere with this a lot of that
[3:10:12.840 --> 3:10:17.320]  is due to your efforts in your team and I just really salute you for that one man
[3:10:17.320 --> 3:10:21.240]  you guys have just blown the lid off of this thing and I think it's just great
[3:10:21.240 --> 3:10:25.120]  but Ted it's scary how big we're getting I mean you're sitting right on top all
[3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:31.200]  this and I'm sorry but I think it's a keg of TNT I mean dozens and dozens of
[3:10:31.200 --> 3:10:36.760]  newspapers a day attacking us media matters George Soros CBS News Jerusalem
[3:10:36.760 --> 3:10:45.160]  Post Salon New Republic I mean it Ted this is wild yeah I mean I'm I mean I'm
[3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:49.000]  right there on the White House enemies list in the top 25 I mean this is
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:53.920]  getting crazy it really is it's getting to be really something else I have to
[3:10:53.920 --> 3:10:59.600]  say that but I am again Alex I mean the reason why I'm here is because I've got
[3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:02.960]  little kids that well when I started there little kids are big now they're all
[3:11:02.960 --> 3:11:06.920]  grown up now one of them's in the army has even said to Afghanistan yet well he's
[3:11:06.920 --> 3:11:11.960]  right now in Iraq so boy well he's in Kuwait but he'll be he'll be at his post
[3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:16.600]  in Iraq here probably next week and then my daughter of course in college I
[3:11:16.600 --> 3:11:23.120]  mean the the the future generation just doesn't stand a chance at all unless if
[3:11:23.120 --> 3:11:27.440]  we can turn this country around and get it back on the proper track instead of
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:31.160]  the direction that we've been heading and I think everybody realizes that now
[3:11:31.160 --> 3:11:35.760]  obviously including Rush Limbaugh which I think is just amazing and you're right
[3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:40.680]  it could be a keg at TNT and you know if we make a difference and I end up
[3:11:40.680 --> 3:11:45.440]  getting blown up in the process well then so be it yeah there's nothing like
[3:11:45.440 --> 3:11:50.140]  being truly alive and just playing the cards you've been dealt and what the
[3:11:50.140 --> 3:11:53.040]  chips fall where they may we're doing the right thing and that's the end of it
[3:11:53.040 --> 3:11:57.560]  damn the torpedoes go straight at him Ted briefly because Alan Combs is coming
[3:11:57.560 --> 3:12:04.280]  up in a moment we just got him oh great okay Ted tell people about today's gold
[3:12:04.280 --> 3:12:07.960]  offer you're able to hold yesterday's gold prices of where you bought gold in
[3:12:07.960 --> 3:12:15.840]  the market a few weeks ago at the 1050 level it's at 1145 $95 above what you
[3:12:15.840 --> 3:12:19.960]  bought this in the market but it's running out you're at the very end of it
[3:12:19.960 --> 3:12:24.360]  tell us the coin offerings you've got today yeah I sure will I mean right now
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:28.640]  I have the Franks currently at 263 the British sovereigns are currently at 2
[3:12:28.640 --> 3:12:34.880]  are at 325 but with silver jumping up over $18 an ounce one of the best buys
[3:12:34.880 --> 3:12:39.800]  that I have is the walking Liberty half at 869 the Lakota Nation coins we still
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:46.880]  hold those down at 2244 and we have a variety of man I've got such a small
[3:12:46.880 --> 3:12:49.440]  amount of buffaloes I don't even want to mention that I have them but they're
[3:12:49.440 --> 3:12:53.440]  there if you're interested in those you can ask for them we have a pretty good
[3:12:53.440 --> 3:12:58.960]  supply of Canadian Maple Leafs in the safe and eagles and and and Krugerans
[3:12:58.960 --> 3:13:02.200]  just a few you know just what you want to do is you want to call your
[3:13:02.200 --> 3:13:09.640]  representative at Midas at 1-800-686-2237 the reason for that right now is
[3:13:09.640 --> 3:13:13.080]  that supplies are getting thin and you'll find that out if you try to stop
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:17.800]  down at your local jewelry store or or corn shop pawn shop that type of thing
[3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:23.120]  you can see that everything's bought up Ted fire out the toll-free number for
[3:13:23.120 --> 3:13:26.600]  listeners to call the brokers and tell them it's the Alex Jones special and
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:29.360]  take advantage of this they're not going to find a deal this good anywhere
[3:13:29.360 --> 3:13:40.840]  yeah the the telephone number is 1-800-686-2237 again 1-800-686-2237
[3:13:40.840 --> 3:13:48.280]  800-686-2237 London Telegraph reporting major gold reserves running out
[3:13:48.280 --> 3:13:54.760]  worldwide while this boom kicks in the dollar imploding because the last three
[3:13:54.760 --> 3:13:59.920]  administrations or even more have been devaluing the currency it is now the
[3:13:59.920 --> 3:14:03.160]  time to get into gold and silver and the best best place to do it is Midas
[3:14:03.160 --> 3:14:13.920]  Resources 800-686-2237 800-686-2237 Ted any closing comments on gold and silver
[3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:18.880]  and where this market's going it appears the new stabilization level is at
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:25.920]  about 1,140 an all-time new new level yeah it is it's it it tried to dip down
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:31.080]  into that 1,030 level today but didn't succeed it's ended up come shooting right
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:36.240]  back up again there obviously is some pressure by the major institutions in
[3:14:36.240 --> 3:14:39.440]  New York City and that kind of thing they they do like to try you know they're
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:44.240]  they're trying to sell gold and prop up the dollar but it's not a successful
[3:14:44.240 --> 3:14:49.400]  effort and honestly I just have to say that the dollar is falling you better
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:53.600]  look at gold and silver as part of your portfolio I was even talking to one guy
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:14:56.720]  very conservative he says you should have at least 10% of your portfolio in
[3:14:56.720 --> 3:15:02.000]  gold I think that number is way low but if you're you know if if that's all you
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:06.880]  can do do it because right now you know with with what's going on in in
[3:15:06.880 --> 3:15:10.520]  Washington with with all these handouts bailouts and everything that's
[3:15:10.520 --> 3:15:13.680]  happening the value of the dollar is going to get hit we just know that's
[3:15:13.680 --> 3:15:17.480]  going to absolutely thank you Ted minus resources standing by to take your call
[3:15:17.480 --> 3:15:23.240]  they can answer your questions 800 686 2237 or minusresources.com thank you
[3:15:23.240 --> 3:15:26.400]  Ted thanks a lot Alex always good to have him pop in occasionally with us
[3:15:26.400 --> 3:15:30.280]  over the balance of the hour into the show I'm very honored to have Alan
[3:15:30.280 --> 3:15:33.840]  comes on I've been on his show quite a few times and he's been here with us a
[3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:37.480]  few times and I don't agree with him on quite a few issues but I do agree with
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:42.200]  him against torture and secret arrest and war and all the rest of it and we've
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:46.920]  now seen 11 months of President Obama in office I want to get his take on the
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:51.000]  president and what the Republicans are doing and what's going to happen when
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:55.280]  Republicans get back in office in a year and then they continue to go down the
[3:15:55.280 --> 3:15:59.760]  same line as Obama has what's going to happen is the public figures out both
[3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:02.800]  parties are controlled by the same corporate interest maybe Alan this
[3:16:02.800 --> 3:16:07.640]  agrees but I certainly the patience of the American people is running out the
[3:16:07.640 --> 3:16:12.640]  honeymoon for politicians are shorter and shorter Alan combs of course the
[3:16:12.640 --> 3:16:16.640]  host of the Alan combs nationally syndicated radio show that airs
[3:16:16.640 --> 3:16:20.560]  throughout the United States on Fox News radio and of course he also co-hosted
[3:16:20.560 --> 3:16:25.440]  from 96 2009 the co-host of Hannity and combs a nightly political debate show
[3:16:25.440 --> 3:16:29.920]  on Fox News and he's also written red white and liberal how the left is right
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:33.520]  and the right is wrong see I believe the right and left don't exist comes began
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:37.600]  his career and stand-up comedy that's a funny joke about left and right and he
[3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:40.800]  developed his radio career in the northeast eventually the station's like
[3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:46.160]  WABC WNBC and on and on and on and it's good to have Alan combs up with us Alan
[3:16:46.160 --> 3:16:49.280]  thanks for coming on Alex I don't think I ever gave you as good an introduction
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:54.240]  you just gave me so thank you very much I appreciate it you bet you bet Alan look
[3:16:54.240 --> 3:16:57.720]  I don't want to sit here and attack you you don't really attack me too bad when
[3:16:57.720 --> 3:17:01.640]  I come on your show no but but come on man
[3:17:01.640 --> 3:17:07.640]  Obama the peace prize 40,000 more troops to have all that he got the peace prize
[3:17:07.640 --> 3:17:12.600]  is it obama's we want to blame him that he got the price well does he deserve it
[3:17:12.600 --> 3:17:19.640]  I would have waited but I mean why attack him for a prize someone else gave him
[3:17:19.640 --> 3:17:27.080]  but it just shows the delusional socialist I can't he didn't do it
[3:17:27.080 --> 3:17:30.680]  I mean maybe you don't like that he got the prize and I think he's got some a lot
[3:17:30.680 --> 3:17:33.560]  to prove look I've got an issue with him on Afghanistan
[3:17:33.560 --> 3:17:36.520]  I want a decision made I want to get out of Afghanistan
[3:17:36.520 --> 3:17:41.320]  we probably agree on that I don't want to another quagmire like we had in Iraq
[3:17:41.320 --> 3:17:46.760]  and I think he needs to earn that prize but it's not his fault that he got it
[3:17:46.760 --> 3:17:51.080]  well I mean I guess that's a good one liner Alan but regardless of the fact
[3:17:51.080 --> 3:17:54.440]  it's embarrassing that he got it and I think it blew up in everybody's
[3:17:54.440 --> 3:17:59.480]  face but it's not embarrassing to him he didn't give it to himself
[3:17:59.480 --> 3:18:02.680]  I'll tell you what is embarrassing for sure and I do think it's embarrassing
[3:18:02.680 --> 3:18:06.280]  it shows all this worshiping this fawning like he's Gandhi and Martin Luther
[3:18:06.280 --> 3:18:10.200]  King rolled up into one when he hasn't done one one hundredth of what they did
[3:18:10.200 --> 3:18:13.880]  now that's my opinion I just think it diminishes the price
[3:18:13.880 --> 3:18:17.240]  look I think we obviously there was a great deal of excitement about the
[3:18:17.240 --> 3:18:21.240]  campaign he offered a lot of hope to people at a time
[3:18:21.240 --> 3:18:25.240]  when the country seemed hopeless when we had a lot of problems because of the
[3:18:25.240 --> 3:18:28.920]  Bush Cheney regime and people were looking for
[3:18:28.920 --> 3:18:31.800]  something and he came along and was the right charismatic character
[3:18:31.800 --> 3:18:35.880]  at the right time now he's got to do the work and obviously he can't live up to
[3:18:35.880 --> 3:18:39.800]  the hype nobody can look I'm more progressive I
[3:18:39.800 --> 3:18:43.800]  want to see him be more bold I want to see him close Guantanamo by executive
[3:18:43.800 --> 3:18:46.520]  order do it tomorrow I'm led to doing trials in
[3:18:46.520 --> 3:18:50.040]  civilian court show that our criminal justice system works I want to see him
[3:18:50.040 --> 3:18:52.680]  get out of Afghanistan I want to get out of a rock faster
[3:18:52.680 --> 3:18:55.960]  I wanted to stand up for something in terms of health care the public option
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:18:59.560]  on the table or off the table where does he stand I look I from a progressive
[3:18:59.560 --> 3:19:04.200]  point of view I'd like to see a bolder approach by the president
[3:19:04.200 --> 3:19:07.000]  Alan quick 60 second comments we're going to break
[3:19:07.000 --> 3:19:10.120]  you're doing the syndicated show what else are you up to these days
[3:19:10.120 --> 3:19:15.480]  I appear on the channel probably working on a book I do my website alan.com
[3:19:15.480 --> 3:19:19.960]  and developing other television projects so you're busy yeah a full-time
[3:19:19.960 --> 3:19:23.400]  syndicated nightly what three-hour show is what it takes to a daily radio show
[3:19:23.400 --> 3:19:26.600]  that alone is a full-time job you know I don't know how you and Hannity and
[3:19:26.600 --> 3:19:31.000]  others could do it multi-hour radio shows and then a highly produced TV show
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:33.800]  every night a lot of good help a lot of great

[3:23:12.840 --> 3:23:15.560]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about
[3:23:15.560 --> 3:23:18.760]  perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that

[3:24:12.120 --> 3:24:15.160]  alan combs with us till the end of the broadcast here in about
[3:24:15.160 --> 3:24:19.160]  35 minutes from now alan.com is his website
[3:24:19.160 --> 3:24:23.000]  and ours is prismplanet.tv jonesreport.com
[3:24:23.000 --> 3:24:27.560]  alan you heard my question uh i mean i'm really worried about this country
[3:24:27.560 --> 3:24:31.480]  because the establishment keeps baiting and switching with the two parties
[3:24:31.480 --> 3:24:34.360]  and i really don't see that big of a difference when it comes to monetary
[3:24:34.360 --> 3:24:38.200]  and economic policy bush's economic team you know basically
[3:24:38.200 --> 3:24:41.880]  is obama's team in many respects a lot of it came from clinton
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:45.240]  uh and all the economists i have on from the fake left and right the whole
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:48.200]  system say that this is going to destroy us what's your take on that
[3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:51.800]  well uh i don't know if it's going to destroy us i mean no one even saw the
[3:24:51.800 --> 3:24:55.080]  economic collapse coming a year and a half ago but alex you generally
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:24:58.120]  don't like who's in office you see the two parties are similar
[3:24:58.120 --> 3:25:01.560]  you don't think anybody's got the solution who would you support i'm just
[3:25:01.560 --> 3:25:05.960]  curious because you seem to be uh against whoever we elect
[3:25:05.960 --> 3:25:09.880]  at any given election and you don't think anybody's got the answers who does
[3:25:09.880 --> 3:25:13.240]  well no that's because the establishment because of the billions of
[3:25:13.240 --> 3:25:18.360]  dollars spent on the election cycles every couple years is able to select
[3:25:18.360 --> 3:25:21.560]  people they already approve of and then we get to choose
[3:25:21.560 --> 3:25:27.320]  from a a small cloistered group of little potentates
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:32.120]  and so i'm for ron paul i mean i like ron paul he was anti-war when bush was
[3:25:32.120 --> 3:25:35.160]  in he's still anti-war ron paul does what he says
[3:25:35.160 --> 3:25:38.520]  i mean i don't even like a lot of the policies dennis kucinich
[3:25:38.520 --> 3:25:42.120]  but i would vote for him over most people because he actually believes in what
[3:25:42.120 --> 3:25:45.480]  he's saying and does what he says yeah people actually uh fantasize about a
[3:25:45.480 --> 3:25:50.600]  paul kucinich or vice versa ticket which seemed implausible and
[3:25:50.600 --> 3:25:54.840]  probably wouldn't win um but look i don't know the answer your question
[3:25:54.840 --> 3:25:57.480]  uh i'd like to believe that the stimulus will work
[3:25:57.480 --> 3:26:01.800]  uh the market's gone back up uh i'd like to believe it's going to open up the
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:05.320]  credit markets they said it's going to take till 2010 before we get
[3:26:05.320 --> 3:26:10.120]  uh some kind of financial or jobs back uh it took a while to get to this place
[3:26:10.120 --> 3:26:14.280]  if it takes a while to get out i'm not an economist i don't have the answers
[3:26:14.280 --> 3:26:18.120]  well i'll just say this it's a political cheap shot as much as i hate george
[3:26:18.120 --> 3:26:21.800]  w bush and the neocons you know i i i believe they were involved in 911 as
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:25.880]  you know alan yeah but as bad as they are for people who agree with you almost
[3:26:25.880 --> 3:26:30.440]  on a daily basis my issue is to have obama's
[3:26:30.440 --> 3:26:34.840]  people blaming the economic collapse on bush when it was the clinton people
[3:26:34.840 --> 3:26:39.720]  that got rid of last eagle uh i mean that he is as much to blame his crew is
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:42.920]  as much to blame as as as the republicans
[3:26:42.920 --> 3:26:47.320]  well it's easy to say that look it was uh a bush who was in office
[3:26:47.320 --> 3:26:51.560]  uh when when the collapse happened it was a deregulation of republicans
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:54.520]  it was the idea that bush had this thing about the community redevelopment
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:26:58.040]  program anybody can own a home that started under clinton bush took it
[3:26:58.040 --> 3:27:01.240]  though a step further no mortgage don't worry we'll get you
[3:27:01.240 --> 3:27:04.680]  home um you don't have to have a lot of credentials
[3:27:04.680 --> 3:27:07.720]  and that was the thing that the republicans were pushing
[3:27:07.720 --> 3:27:11.240]  a home ownership for everybody when everybody was not qualified to do it
[3:27:11.240 --> 3:27:15.160]  that caused a collapse of freddy and fanny
[3:27:15.160 --> 3:27:19.320]  which is my point uh the same people
[3:27:19.320 --> 3:27:23.240]  well maclatchie's come out with a big list of reports they got internal
[3:27:23.240 --> 3:27:26.840]  documents from goldman sacks where two years before the collapse they were
[3:27:26.840 --> 3:27:30.680]  secretly betting against housing while they were telling
[3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:35.000]  all their clients to buy housing because they wanted to consolidate the market
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:37.160]  i mean are are you for auditing the private
[3:27:37.160 --> 3:27:40.840]  fellow reserve alan uh i don't know a lot about the federal reserve i know that
[3:27:40.840 --> 3:27:44.840]  uh libertarians and people who agree with you often will bring up the federal
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:49.000]  reserve and i'm on the con of it's not the area that i really know a lot about
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:53.320]  um so i i don't i'm not educated enough to give you an intelligent answer to
[3:27:53.320 --> 3:27:56.920]  that question that's ridiculous you can't punt on this alan
[3:27:56.920 --> 3:28:00.600]  come on tell me i don't know the federal reserve has never been fully
[3:28:00.600 --> 3:28:02.680]  audited don't you think there should be transparent
[3:28:02.680 --> 3:28:06.280]  audited fine good alan comes for auditing the fed
[3:28:06.280 --> 3:28:10.440]  that's beautiful briefly before we go to break long segment coming up
[3:28:10.440 --> 3:28:14.760]  what do you think would fix america i mean where do you stand on afghanistan
[3:28:14.760 --> 3:28:18.120]  i want to get out why are we spending all this money why don't we
[3:28:18.120 --> 3:28:21.480]  why do we do it around about health care and people complain about how much
[3:28:21.480 --> 3:28:24.520]  money is going to cost and people yell at people about where their tax dollars
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:27.160]  are going but when it comes to war nobody questions
[3:28:27.160 --> 3:28:30.360]  how long will it be what will it cost what's their exit strategy
[3:28:30.360 --> 3:28:33.400]  how much taxpayer dollars are going how are we going to pay for it or our
[3:28:33.400 --> 3:28:35.000]  children and grandchildren are going to pay for it
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:37.960]  why does nobody ask those questions when it comes to war but only when it comes
[3:28:37.960 --> 3:28:41.000]  to social services
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:47.880]  how big a part of the war and the whole defense budget
[3:28:47.880 --> 3:28:51.960]  how big a piece of that is it i mean in that like 45 percent of all the
[3:28:51.960 --> 3:28:56.920]  expenditures is is is related to defense uh i don't know the exact number
[3:28:56.920 --> 3:29:00.760]  uh i'm in a huge amount of a huge amount of the budget goes to the fence we know
[3:29:00.760 --> 3:29:03.880]  that a disproportionate amount goes to the fence
[3:29:03.880 --> 3:29:10.040]  a small amount goes to uh welfare uh to public good to social programs and yet
[3:29:10.040 --> 3:29:13.720]  those are the things the uh conservatives scream about but most
[3:29:13.720 --> 3:29:17.080]  of their dollars are going elsewhere
[3:29:19.320 --> 3:29:22.280]  so in the final equation where do you think this country is going to be in
[3:29:22.280 --> 3:29:25.400]  five years i couldn't have predicted we'd be
[3:29:25.400 --> 3:29:28.040]  where we are now who would have thought obama would be president who would have
[3:29:28.040 --> 3:29:31.240]  thought the economic collapse anybody who tells you now what they know is
[3:29:31.240 --> 3:29:35.320]  going to happen in five years is just shooting in the wind
[3:29:35.320 --> 3:29:38.920]  i don't know i said five years ago gold would be a thousand dollars an ounce at
[3:29:38.920 --> 3:29:42.760]  five years alan well you're a genius

[3:33:21.800 --> 3:33:26.040]  but but alan let's get down to brass tacks on the subject of new world order
[3:33:26.040 --> 3:33:30.840]  world government 15 16 years ago i would read un
[3:33:30.840 --> 3:33:34.120]  documents calling for a global government calling for global one child
[3:33:34.120 --> 3:33:37.560]  policies trilateral commission calling for it i would
[3:33:37.560 --> 3:33:41.080]  talk about it i would be called a kook written up in federal reports is
[3:33:41.080 --> 3:33:44.440]  dangerous now i have in my hand we're also live on the
[3:33:44.440 --> 3:33:49.720]  internet on tv we can do it new york times october 26 2009
[3:33:49.720 --> 3:33:54.520]  ban chi moon secretary general of the un he calls for global government
[3:33:54.520 --> 3:33:58.680]  structure global governance in the article those are quotes and says the
[3:33:58.680 --> 3:34:03.800]  carbon tax will finance the global government so let me ask alan comes
[3:34:03.800 --> 3:34:07.320]  we now have limbaugh admitting world government after denying it for decades
[3:34:07.320 --> 3:34:11.320]  we now have glenn beck uh... coming along talking about it
[3:34:11.320 --> 3:34:14.680]  so it's kind of like a right-wing issue now
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:19.400]  and then meanwhile the southern prairie law center adl cbs news
[3:34:19.400 --> 3:34:22.600]  i mean i've got all these articles right here salon media matters all the
[3:34:22.600 --> 3:34:28.440]  george soros publications are saying i am basically this dangerous liar
[3:34:28.440 --> 3:34:32.040]  who is lying to everyone and saying world government is here
[3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:36.840]  alan comes are because any given day i can go to google and type in new world
[3:34:36.840 --> 3:34:40.200]  order world government and get hundreds of articles in mainstream news
[3:34:40.200 --> 3:34:45.080]  announcing world government saying it's good so alan comes i'm asking you
[3:34:45.080 --> 3:34:47.800]  how is the mainstream media going to have this
[3:34:47.800 --> 3:34:51.160]  where they say there is no world government no move towards global
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:34:56.760]  government but at the same time admit that there's a
[3:34:56.760 --> 3:34:59.160]  world government how do they admit there's a world government but then
[3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:02.360]  separately if you talk about it and say you don't want it they is admitting
[3:35:02.360 --> 3:35:05.400]  there's a world government as far as moon is concerning
[3:35:05.400 --> 3:35:08.200]  he runs the u n i don't know exactly what he said about
[3:35:08.200 --> 3:35:11.720]  world government uh... you have people like back and you have limbaugh
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:16.520]  who have such contempt for obama that they're going to say oh my god look at
[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:20.520]  this marxist look at this horrible left-wing totalitarian he wants to
[3:35:20.520 --> 3:35:24.440]  take over the world and scare people and make them believe that somehow
[3:35:24.440 --> 3:35:27.880]  with a liberal lefty guy in the government who is
[3:35:27.880 --> 3:35:30.920]  they think in some cases not the people i mentioned but some of their
[3:35:30.920 --> 3:35:34.840]  followers believe he was born in kenya wasn't even an american and how dare
[3:35:34.840 --> 3:35:37.320]  this guy take over our government they're going to run it it's going to be a
[3:35:37.320 --> 3:35:40.360]  world government it's fear mongering
[3:35:40.360 --> 3:35:45.000]  uh... i i i would also want to do it says alex we are a sovereign country
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:48.520]  we're not in any danger of not becoming a sovereign country
[3:35:48.520 --> 3:35:52.040]  uh... i don't believe that the u n or any other world body
[3:35:52.040 --> 3:35:55.720]  will be taken over our government of course we do have to have treaties
[3:35:55.720 --> 3:35:58.680]  with other countries whether it's treaties on the environment
[3:35:58.680 --> 3:36:01.400]  as you mentioned uh... whether it's uh... you know we live in whether
[3:36:01.400 --> 3:36:04.360]  economic issues we live in a world community
[3:36:04.360 --> 3:36:08.600]  it does take a village it takes a global village so the idea that we can live
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:11.560]  isolated in the rest of the world but in terms of sovereignty
[3:36:11.560 --> 3:36:16.520]  nobody's taking over the united states look at the world trade organization
[3:36:16.520 --> 3:36:19.400]  agreement it has more power than our congress does
[3:36:19.400 --> 3:36:23.080]  over trade let me read you at ban kai moon said the new york times
[3:36:23.080 --> 3:36:27.240]  a deal must include an equitable global governance structure
[3:36:27.240 --> 3:36:32.040]  all countries must have a voice in how resources are deployed and managed
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:36.520]  well that's that's that's a way of saying there if you read the whole article
[3:36:36.520 --> 3:36:39.880]  that the u n is going to decide where the resources go
[3:36:39.880 --> 3:36:43.480]  and the countries will have their say well the u n is never right to unilaterally
[3:36:43.480 --> 3:36:46.920]  make that decision ban kai moon could see whatever he wants to say
[3:36:46.920 --> 3:36:51.000]  uh... he runs a global organization because he says it
[3:36:51.000 --> 3:36:53.960]  uh... hold on but but now and here's what i'm saying
[3:36:53.960 --> 3:36:59.560]  you can't say people are cooks because and i'm not saying you're saying this
[3:36:59.560 --> 3:37:03.560]  but i'm just because they talk about global government
[3:37:03.560 --> 3:37:07.080]  when it's in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles here's the problem
[3:37:07.080 --> 3:37:09.800]  i talked about how they were going to devalue the currency bringing a global
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:13.400]  carbon tax a monetary tax set up this private global
[3:37:13.400 --> 3:37:16.200]  government around the imf that's now been announced
[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:20.120]  here it is financial times of london and now for a world government
[3:37:20.120 --> 3:37:22.840]  and they go on to say we need global government now and it needs to be
[3:37:22.840 --> 3:37:27.400]  authoritarian to save the planet i mean well you say they say it alex
[3:37:27.400 --> 3:37:29.800]  there are always people who are going to say that
[3:37:29.800 --> 3:37:32.760]  uh... they're going to be called who say we need a world government
[3:37:32.760 --> 3:37:35.960]  they're going to be crazy people who say we take over the world
[3:37:35.960 --> 3:37:40.360]  but we're the sovereign nations of the world are not going to submit
[3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:44.760]  to a world government and unless they're bankrupted from the inside by the very
[3:37:44.760 --> 3:37:48.120]  same banking institutions that are found in the world government value of the
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:52.680]  conspiracy theory stuff no we we are okay to goldman sacks and jp morgan
[3:37:52.680 --> 3:37:55.800]  chase are they making record profits right now did they come out
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:38:00.280]  smelling like a king a smelling like a 24 carat rose
[3:38:00.280 --> 3:38:04.920]  after the crisis last year didn't they fold or one of them folded i mean uh
[3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:07.880]  i don't have a call that smelling like a rose i wouldn't i don't see it the way
[3:38:07.880 --> 3:38:12.360]  at all no jp morgan record profits uh... goldman sacks record profits
[3:38:12.360 --> 3:38:15.640]  they got to take over bear sterns their competition
[3:38:15.640 --> 3:38:19.720]  what about all the companies that fold it that fail that couldn't survive
[3:38:19.720 --> 3:38:23.640]  uh... you know that that that indeed uh... institutions layman brothers
[3:38:23.640 --> 3:38:26.200]  uh... that that you thought would be around forever
[3:38:26.200 --> 3:38:29.320]  it was a great consolidation that's what the bigger
[3:38:29.320 --> 3:38:32.600]  and powerful central banks wanted it was goldman sacks that had their people
[3:38:32.600 --> 3:38:36.440]  all over the government in the key regulatory positions look i if you are
[3:38:36.440 --> 3:38:38.680]  someone who worries about world government
[3:38:38.680 --> 3:38:42.200]  you spend a lot of time you will take everything you see as a sign
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:46.680]  that that apocalypse is coming i don't see it that way
[3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:50.680]  oh ellen i'm not saying an apocalypse is coming
[3:38:50.680 --> 3:38:56.120]  i have a kind of apocalypse i have cbs news i have a dl
[3:38:56.120 --> 3:39:00.120]  saying you can quote those media organizations i don't know how long
[3:39:00.120 --> 3:39:04.440]  bring you stories about those people who think this is happening
[3:39:04.440 --> 3:39:07.880]  but we are and will continue to be a sovereign nation
[3:39:07.880 --> 3:39:13.720]  ellen let me just finish this point to you i'm here looking at the adl it says
[3:39:13.720 --> 3:39:17.240]  rage grows in america anti-government conspiracies
[3:39:17.240 --> 3:39:21.560]  anger on the fringes alex jones the conspiracy king
[3:39:21.560 --> 3:39:25.640]  uh... and then they go and flattered you're a king
[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:31.160]  yeah but they they say i'm bad because i talk about a global government run by
[3:39:31.160 --> 3:39:35.240]  private banks that's what's being set up at the g20
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:39.000]  they're actually proposing it well it's again you know you
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:41.960]  you do wonder in the conspiracy theory territory
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:44.840]  no country is going to give up their sovereignty
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:48.760]  to allow a global government do you really think the united states
[3:39:48.760 --> 3:39:52.040]  under obama or anybody else is going to give up its sovereignty
[3:39:52.040 --> 3:39:55.880]  we'll still have the the american flag out there flapping in the wind but
[3:39:55.880 --> 3:39:59.400]  for all intents and purposes just like the imf and world bank
[3:39:59.400 --> 3:40:02.200]  go in and take over third world countries and why would they were not a
[3:40:02.200 --> 3:40:04.520]  third world country why would the united states submit
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:09.000]  to a larger entity to run a sovereign it's sovereign because we have corporate
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:12.120]  interests that want vertical integration and want to end our
[3:40:12.120 --> 3:40:16.600]  industrial society to make the public more manageable and to impose a
[3:40:16.600 --> 3:40:20.280]  forced planetary one-job policy have you read the textbook
[3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:23.880]  written by white house science czar john p holdren
[3:40:23.880 --> 3:40:26.920]  i didn't know he had czar's that's a media invention that word
[3:40:26.920 --> 3:40:30.680]  i know i didn't read his textbook uh... but i've read about him and again i've
[3:40:30.680 --> 3:40:35.080]  read that i'll be a people who again fear obama
[3:40:35.080 --> 3:40:38.440]  and believe that these are marxists are somehow going to take over the world
[3:40:38.440 --> 3:40:42.920]  this is conspiracy theory stuff alex well alan i think that's the left cover
[3:40:42.920 --> 3:40:46.680]  argument and i know they have the right now playing the part
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:40:51.080]  of the party out of power and so now they can talk about the new world order
[3:40:51.080 --> 3:40:54.520]  and make it a discredited glenn beck rush limbaugh
[3:40:54.520 --> 3:40:59.000]  uh... right wing situation i think the fake neocon warmongering
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:03.000]  torture loving criminals uh... you know with all of their insider
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:06.040]  uh... you know deals with no bid weapons contracts
[3:41:06.040 --> 3:41:10.120]  they should love obama continuing secret arrest continuing indefinite i will
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:11.440]  probably agree
[3:41:11.440 --> 3:41:12.800]  the idea of rendering
[3:41:12.800 --> 3:41:16.520]  we just heard a story yesterday that there is a secret prison in lithuania
[3:41:16.520 --> 3:41:18.120]  in a writing academy
[3:41:18.120 --> 3:41:20.600]  the fact that this is going on and this is where
[3:41:20.600 --> 3:41:24.520]  when i hear conservatives talk about obama being a radical liberal and marxist
[3:41:24.520 --> 3:41:27.120]  and how uh... you know he's taking the country up
[3:41:27.120 --> 3:41:30.760]  though he's not he's doing unfortunately some of the same thing i was critical
[3:41:30.760 --> 3:41:32.880]  of the bush administration for doing
[3:41:32.880 --> 3:41:37.520]  at least you'll admit that most liberals will just say no he's not and in fact
[3:41:37.520 --> 3:41:42.080]  he's intensifying a lot of this so the idea that we would render the other
[3:41:42.080 --> 3:41:43.120]  countries
[3:41:43.120 --> 3:41:47.480]  uh... because we don't want to be seen as torturers and also the idea that uh...
[3:41:47.480 --> 3:41:49.440]  uh... they want to give a pass to
[3:41:49.440 --> 3:41:52.680]  executives of all previous administrations there are people who
[3:41:52.680 --> 3:41:54.680]  believe i'm certainly on the left that
[3:41:54.680 --> 3:41:55.680]  bush and cheney
[3:41:55.680 --> 3:42:00.240]  what he prosecuted particularly cheney and that they have a hands-off policy
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:04.080]  and that you have eric holder was going to go after the cia possibly
[3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:06.840]  but they're not going to have to be actual torture memo writers and the
[3:42:06.840 --> 3:42:07.640]  attorneys
[3:42:07.640 --> 3:42:09.080]  okay bush and cheney
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:10.120]  permission
[3:42:10.120 --> 3:42:12.800]  to violate the constitution
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:16.400]  alan combs dot com syndicated radio host
[3:42:16.400 --> 3:42:20.400]  you can turn in what was that noise
[3:42:20.400 --> 3:42:23.920]  we just lost his line
[3:42:23.920 --> 3:42:26.920]  uh... we we've got him back and are you there and i was the government
[3:42:26.920 --> 3:42:29.120]  listening and i like
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:32.480]  now it's probably the deteriorating infrastructure in this country is
[3:42:32.480 --> 3:42:36.120]  part of the one-world government taking over
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:39.600]  alan you don't have a microchip in your brain do you have that i know of
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:41.200]  are you a reptoid
[3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:44.440]  but i know of
[3:42:44.440 --> 3:42:48.000]  maybe you're just uh... a a a a voice hologram maybe i'm not even talking
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:51.360]  about you know i've i've had surgery my life who knows what they've implanted in
[3:42:51.360 --> 3:42:51.920]  me
[3:42:51.920 --> 3:42:53.840]  when i was under anesthesia
[3:42:53.840 --> 3:42:57.120]  maybe you're just a computer program that rupert murdoch has there at the
[3:42:57.120 --> 3:43:00.680]  fox studio you know and he may have done such a good job that i actually think i'm
[3:43:00.680 --> 3:43:01.440]  human
[3:43:01.440 --> 3:43:04.280]  uh...
[3:43:04.280 --> 3:43:05.240]  you know that
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:09.440]  there's actually an argument for that that had to be a wind up toy android
[3:43:09.440 --> 3:43:12.800]  you just pull the string and he has like ten statements he makes
[3:43:12.800 --> 3:43:19.400]  uh... i would have no knowledge of that you're a great american alan
[3:43:19.400 --> 3:43:21.960]  oh my god this is insane because i
[3:43:21.960 --> 3:43:23.840]  uh... here we go you highlighted this
[3:43:23.840 --> 3:43:27.240]  we were talking about glenn beck a lot of people compare the two of you
[3:43:27.240 --> 3:43:29.440]  a lot of people believe that uh...
[3:43:29.440 --> 3:43:32.360]  you know your act in his or many ways are similar
[3:43:32.360 --> 3:43:35.920]  so i would think that it's a compatibility there
[3:43:35.920 --> 3:43:39.440]  no because the establishment is creating this
[3:43:39.440 --> 3:43:42.560]  patria toyed conspiracy toyed
[3:43:42.560 --> 3:43:45.160]  uh... counterfeit
[3:43:45.160 --> 3:43:48.040]  where glenn beck says he's fighting the new world order
[3:43:48.040 --> 3:43:51.800]  but then says we've got a launch new wars in the arabs of snuck nukes into the
[3:43:51.800 --> 3:43:54.840]  country and right when ron paul had a chance to actually
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:43:57.840]  when during the primaries glenn beck came out and said
[3:43:57.840 --> 3:44:00.920]  this money bomb that means blowing up people
[3:44:00.920 --> 3:44:04.640]  he may be a terrorist his listeners move we may need to use the army against
[3:44:04.640 --> 3:44:08.480]  them to be these are almost exact quotes and then
[3:44:08.480 --> 3:44:11.760]  the wall street journals reporting they've built some fema camps that comes
[3:44:11.760 --> 3:44:13.720]  out and says none of them exist
[3:44:13.720 --> 3:44:15.440]  none of them exist and then he
[3:44:15.440 --> 3:44:17.600]  he acts like a complete fruit loop
[3:44:17.600 --> 3:44:21.520]  uh... and i'm serious on purpose he's an actor very good actor
[3:44:21.520 --> 3:44:23.200]  says he i've been listening to him
[3:44:23.200 --> 3:44:24.800]  off and on for like nine years
[3:44:24.800 --> 3:44:27.320]  so i've seen his evolution and i just know
[3:44:27.320 --> 3:44:29.440]  he's as funny as a three dollar bill
[3:44:29.440 --> 3:44:30.880]  and i'm all about
[3:44:30.880 --> 3:44:34.320]  real even i don't like somebody of the real i tend to
[3:44:34.320 --> 3:44:35.440]  you know respect them
[3:44:35.440 --> 3:44:37.200]  but but i don't like glenn beck
[3:44:37.200 --> 3:44:40.360]  because he's a judo scope into take control of the tea parties
[3:44:40.360 --> 3:44:43.320]  take control libertarian movement that ron paul heads
[3:44:43.320 --> 3:44:44.560]  and flush it down
[3:44:44.560 --> 3:44:47.680]  the rupert murdoch toilet
[3:44:47.680 --> 3:44:51.800]  i don't even push it down the rupert murdoch parley probably ron paul's biggest
[3:44:51.800 --> 3:44:52.840]  advocate
[3:44:52.840 --> 3:44:56.600]  along with judge napolitano here at fox news and they seem to be
[3:44:56.600 --> 3:45:00.520]  appealing to a lot of the very same people who support ron paul
[3:45:00.520 --> 3:45:01.680]  but see that's how
[3:45:01.680 --> 3:45:04.520]  well i think the polytons for real so i like
[3:45:04.520 --> 3:45:06.400]  so he's a true libertarian
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:08.000]  no i mean he's actually again
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:09.920]  he's actually against the torture
[3:45:09.920 --> 3:45:11.840]  he's actually against the war
[3:45:11.840 --> 3:45:15.160]  correct never changes so patriot act
[3:45:15.160 --> 3:45:17.440]  but not glenn beck i've seen glenn beck
[3:45:17.440 --> 3:45:19.040]  he said i'm okay
[3:45:19.040 --> 3:45:21.200]  this is why i don't like glenn beck don't want to talk about it because i want to
[3:45:21.200 --> 3:45:22.080]  talk to alan combs
[3:45:22.080 --> 3:45:24.800]  but but alan
[3:45:24.800 --> 3:45:28.320]  i have video clips we played him here where where he said
[3:45:28.320 --> 3:45:31.440]  the banker bailout is good we must have it or it's all over
[3:45:31.440 --> 3:45:35.440]  then he came back three months later and said you know i was against the bailout
[3:45:35.440 --> 3:45:37.360]  uh... he comes out and says he's
[3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:39.760]  for the patriot act and
[3:45:39.760 --> 3:45:43.360]  he's all he's a flip flop well i've got you know i honestly have not followed him
[3:45:43.360 --> 3:45:46.560]  that closely so i could not cite you chapter verse
[3:45:46.560 --> 3:45:49.520]  but what he said that many people see the two of you in the same category in
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:50.320]  that you
[3:45:50.320 --> 3:45:53.360]  seem to view the government in a similar manner
[3:45:53.360 --> 3:45:56.720]  well i want to be clear if i embrace glenn beck and kissed up to him i could
[3:45:56.720 --> 3:45:58.080]  be on the show
[3:45:58.080 --> 3:45:59.120]  and i've had
[3:45:59.120 --> 3:46:03.360]  little entrees laid out from neocon organizations to go join them and i'm
[3:46:03.360 --> 3:46:04.000]  not
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:05.200]  so i'm not here
[3:46:05.200 --> 3:46:08.800]  attacking beck because i'm jealous of his big tv show as some people say
[3:46:08.800 --> 3:46:10.240]  i'm attacking beck
[3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:14.000]  because i saw this guy say he was for the banker bailout and then later say he
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:15.200]  never was
[3:46:15.200 --> 3:46:18.160]  i mean and and then there's a hundred examples of this
[3:46:18.160 --> 3:46:19.440]  so
[3:46:19.440 --> 3:46:23.200]  i believe he's a benedict arnold
[3:46:23.200 --> 3:46:26.640]  okay well i guess we won't see you on his show any types of that
[3:46:26.640 --> 3:46:29.920]  no he won't be in the building but apparently not
[3:46:29.920 --> 3:46:33.280]  no you won't see me anywhere near there because i've got to be real i mean that's
[3:46:33.280 --> 3:46:34.240]  all i got alan
[3:46:34.240 --> 3:46:36.400]  speaking of of of being real
[3:46:36.400 --> 3:46:39.600]  let's go to the fake left here and i want your take on this chris matthew's
[3:46:39.600 --> 3:46:40.880]  carlos watson
[3:46:40.880 --> 3:46:43.120]  chris matthew's carlos watson
[3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:47.040]  uh people on cnn anderson cooper i you i'm sure you've seen this
[3:46:47.040 --> 3:46:50.720]  everywhere saying look at the tea parties look at that woman
[3:46:50.720 --> 3:46:55.200]  that's code for not liking black people oh if you say it's socialism
[3:46:55.200 --> 3:46:59.680]  that's code for racism no i mean even newsweek said we're all socialists now
[3:46:59.680 --> 3:47:03.520]  that this is a move towards you know more more collectivism
[3:47:03.520 --> 3:47:10.320]  isn't that liberal limousine liberal race pimping to always inject race in to
[3:47:10.320 --> 3:47:14.800]  make it a polarizing issue no i i don't think saying that obama is a
[3:47:14.800 --> 3:47:18.080]  socialist or headed down the road of socialism is your racist
[3:47:18.080 --> 3:47:21.440]  i do think among those people not all of them
[3:47:21.440 --> 3:47:24.480]  but i do think a substantial number of people who've been promoting this
[3:47:24.480 --> 3:47:28.400]  birther movement that he's born in kenya he's not really an american
[3:47:28.400 --> 3:47:31.440]  he's black you know that he's not one of us
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:35.600]  i think among the teabaggers the tea party here's whatever you call them
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:39.200]  uh there are people who do you know that they've been racist signs and there are
[3:47:39.200 --> 3:47:43.920]  among those people there are enough of some of them are racist
[3:47:43.920 --> 3:47:48.080]  enough to make me uncomfortable and um there are people who don't like the
[3:47:48.080 --> 3:47:51.600]  fact that a black guy who they believe was born in another country
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:57.600]  uh was his president i think if that's not right i mean some of that is racist
[3:47:57.600 --> 3:48:00.880]  i'm sure you could find a small percentage that are but most people that
[3:48:00.880 --> 3:48:05.440]  are mad at president obama are mad because
[3:48:05.440 --> 3:48:09.840]  he's for the banker bailout he's for future bailouts he's for more wars
[3:48:09.840 --> 3:48:13.600]  he's for the patriot act now he's for warrantless wiretapping
[3:48:13.600 --> 3:48:18.400]  and they don't like i mean he said he was going to balance the budget and cut
[3:48:18.400 --> 3:48:21.920]  spending and he's outdone bush in his first year
[3:48:21.920 --> 3:48:25.520]  the stimulus package of course you're going to spend it before you start
[3:48:25.520 --> 3:48:28.720]  closing that gap he wasn't going to balance the budget in nine months he's
[3:48:28.720 --> 3:48:31.920]  been president for nine months it takes a long time to clear up
[3:48:31.920 --> 3:48:35.600]  the mess the detritus that was left by the previous administration
[3:48:35.600 --> 3:48:38.640]  people the idea that he by now should have balanced the budget
[3:48:38.640 --> 3:48:41.920]  it's crazy to take years to do that but he's got to move us toward that
[3:48:41.920 --> 3:48:46.320]  the first thing though is to spend money to get the economy going again
[3:48:46.320 --> 3:48:50.880]  alan let me go back on this on the issue of
[3:48:50.880 --> 3:48:54.480]  and this is what matthew's and others have said that it is code for racism to
[3:48:54.480 --> 3:48:58.560]  say the word socialism let's say 10 percent
[3:48:58.560 --> 3:49:02.800]  of the people that are berthers or tea party members
[3:49:02.800 --> 3:49:05.760]  a lot of these are my listeners out there saying defend our second amendment
[3:49:05.760 --> 3:49:08.400]  defend our sovereignty it's a mean to call them teabaggers
[3:49:08.400 --> 3:49:11.120]  and it's a way to demonize them politically and it's a good throwaway
[3:49:11.120 --> 3:49:14.000]  line and and i wish you wouldn't use it but i know it's
[3:49:14.000 --> 3:49:21.360]  too much fun but at its core at its core uh people
[3:49:21.360 --> 3:49:25.680]  people are genuinely upset with obama and by the mainstream media
[3:49:25.680 --> 3:49:30.720]  and the fake liberal media invoking racism it's creating a lot more racial
[3:49:30.720 --> 3:49:35.280]  tension uh than than than maybe 10 of anti-obama
[3:49:35.280 --> 3:49:38.960]  people being truly racist i mean i think it's wrong you don't agree that
[3:49:38.960 --> 3:49:43.040]  invoking that when someone hears the word socialism a lot of people believe
[3:49:43.040 --> 3:49:46.480]  that they now think if i speak out against socialism
[3:49:46.480 --> 3:49:49.680]  which really is just corporate corruption they they always steal the money
[3:49:49.680 --> 3:49:52.800]  even if you're for socialism it never works because of the corruption
[3:49:52.800 --> 3:49:57.040]  isn't that invoking all sorts of racial division doesn't the left i don't think
[3:49:57.040 --> 3:50:02.080]  i don't think socialism indicates racism i think as i said there are some other
[3:50:02.080 --> 3:50:05.600]  things that they're going after obama about that i think indicate racism
[3:50:05.600 --> 3:50:10.800]  the berther stuff but i'm saying invoking this the the the the progressives the
[3:50:10.800 --> 3:50:14.560]  left always saying people that don't agree with obama are racist
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:17.600]  i'm not saying you're saying that but that's what some of these other people
[3:50:17.600 --> 3:50:20.480]  are saying some of them are and i've seen we've seen more of it i get more of
[3:50:20.480 --> 3:50:24.000]  those calls on my radio show i get you know people call up with watermelon
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:27.200]  jokes i mean they're that you know uh there is some of that going on look if
[3:50:27.200 --> 3:50:31.840]  hillary clinton had been the nominee uh she would be uh
[3:50:31.840 --> 3:50:35.360]  uh they'd be doing that at the gender stuff and they'd be a lot of sexism
[3:50:35.360 --> 3:50:39.200]  going on uh well no they would say she's a lesbian
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:42.640]  they would say there whenever we break a glass ceiling
[3:50:42.640 --> 3:50:45.760]  uh whether it's race or sex or people gonna make jokes and it's gonna be
[3:50:45.760 --> 3:50:48.640]  unpleasant
[3:50:48.640 --> 3:50:51.920]  but you look at comedy central it's full of racial jokes i mean
[3:50:51.920 --> 3:50:55.680]  we're a lot more crass today when we were i don't think it's always done
[3:50:55.680 --> 3:50:59.440]  because of racist reasons when you hear a racial or sexist joke
[3:50:59.440 --> 3:51:03.120]  i mean you go to the comedy clubs that's all you hear we'll be right back

[3:54:25.840 --> 3:54:28.800]  security council that's only a small part of the film
[3:54:28.800 --> 3:54:33.680]  info wars dot com uh allen i think the mainstream media on the left-hand
[3:54:33.680 --> 3:54:37.520]  rider destroying their credibility and they keep denying the world government
[3:54:37.520 --> 3:54:40.560]  they keep denying globalizations taking over they keep denying what's
[3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:43.600]  happening and i i i think that the mainstream
[3:54:43.600 --> 3:54:46.800]  media's days are numbered and i think this country is going into
[3:54:46.800 --> 3:54:50.560]  revolution i don't want it to be violent no alex come on you know that's kind of
[3:54:50.560 --> 3:54:54.880]  the hype that's a very hyper you know the statement of that's a
[3:54:54.880 --> 3:54:59.280]  inflammatory alarmist kind of statement yes going into revolution
[3:54:59.280 --> 3:55:02.320]  i mean that's the kind of stuff that that you know
[3:55:02.320 --> 3:55:05.840]  inflames people and gets people all crazy and i don't know this but that's
[3:55:05.840 --> 3:55:08.880]  your opinion maybe it's your opinion but there's nothing to really back down
[3:55:08.880 --> 3:55:11.280]  up come on are you kidding i mean how many
[3:55:11.280 --> 3:55:14.080]  analysts and forecasters that have been right in the past
[3:55:14.080 --> 3:55:17.040]  that we've interviewed from across the political spectrum
[3:55:17.040 --> 3:55:21.920]  and when i say revolution i mean a political revolution that may entail
[3:55:21.920 --> 3:55:25.920]  uh uh the pentagon in some of their reports in the british ministry of
[3:55:25.920 --> 3:55:29.360]  defense believe they're going to be global riots by 2011
[3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:33.600]  they issued that report three years ago um i mean allen i don't know i mean you
[3:55:33.600 --> 3:55:36.640]  i know you you're a smart guy you read a lot of mainstream newspapers and stuff
[3:55:36.640 --> 3:55:41.520]  but i read government reports allen yeah well you know uh that's pretty
[3:55:41.520 --> 3:55:43.840]  alarmist alex i thought about how there's gonna be a revolution i make
[3:55:43.840 --> 3:55:46.320]  like maybe you've got to define revolution
[3:55:46.320 --> 3:55:49.840]  um by revolution you mean the end of government as we know it
[3:55:49.840 --> 3:55:53.200]  i mean i'm talking about political realignments
[3:55:53.200 --> 3:55:57.600]  depressions uh breakdown in some areas of society
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:02.480]  i mean all the analysts we have on say we're really over 20 on employment allen
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:06.960]  well uh you know that's not the number that's out there is 10.2 percent you
[3:56:06.960 --> 3:56:09.760]  can then add the number of people who aren't even looking anymore
[3:56:09.760 --> 3:56:13.760]  i've not heard the number 20 percent again this puts you in the alarmist
[3:56:13.760 --> 3:56:16.960]  category when you say stuff like that well i could say the same to you again
[3:56:16.960 --> 3:56:21.680]  that's a throwaway line let's get real here you're not saying that
[3:56:21.680 --> 3:56:25.280]  i mean with your political savvy that that things are getting crazier and
[3:56:25.280 --> 3:56:27.760]  crazier and wilder and wilder and i think the
[3:56:27.760 --> 3:56:30.800]  anti-government crowd is getting crazier and crazier
[3:56:30.800 --> 3:56:34.240]  there's a certain level of discontent there's a big fight on the right
[3:56:34.240 --> 3:56:37.600]  is going to be the neocons and the crazies way on the right who support the
[3:56:37.600 --> 3:56:40.480]  palins uh you know we're going to be sane
[3:56:40.480 --> 3:56:44.080]  conservatives like david brooks or sane conservatives
[3:56:44.080 --> 3:56:48.240]  uh perhaps like uh some of our other governors
[3:56:48.240 --> 3:56:52.320]  like poletti who want nothing to do with the far right charlie crispy and
[3:56:52.320 --> 3:56:56.160]  driven out in florida by the far right who's not conservative enough for them
[3:56:56.160 --> 3:57:00.400]  well i'll tell you this the battle's on the right
[3:57:00.400 --> 3:57:05.440]  yeah the old blue blood republican tennis club type people it's over for them
[3:57:05.440 --> 3:57:08.640]  and they are the people that have helped bring this country
[3:57:08.640 --> 3:57:13.520]  down allen and and and again you're saying oh the crazy palins on the right
[3:57:13.520 --> 3:57:16.400]  she's about his right wing his mouth say tongue she can hardly read off a
[3:57:16.400 --> 3:57:20.080]  teleprompter and again the revolution allen
[3:57:20.080 --> 3:57:23.280]  isn't on the right of the left it's a revolution outside
[3:57:23.280 --> 3:57:26.640]  of that control paradigm well i understand that the people calling
[3:57:26.640 --> 3:57:29.840]  themselves an appendix of the tea party people are clearly though on the right
[3:57:29.840 --> 3:57:33.360]  they claim otherwise they claim that we know we're not left or right but they're
[3:57:33.360 --> 3:57:36.560]  right they're they're they're people are probably more libertarian but
[3:57:36.560 --> 3:57:39.440]  leaning right well no i agree with you that that the
[3:57:39.440 --> 3:57:43.120]  the largest contingent since glenn back took it over
[3:57:43.120 --> 3:57:48.880]  is right wing neocons but but we were there before we're the real libertarians
[3:57:48.880 --> 3:57:51.840]  see we want freedom we don't want a big nanny state
[3:57:51.840 --> 3:57:55.680]  we want to be left alone and if you don't think the country's going bankrupt
[3:57:55.680 --> 3:57:58.800]  and they aren't building fema camps and you think i'm being alarmist
[3:57:58.800 --> 3:58:02.240]  let's wait and see that's alarmist that's crazy no it's all admitted
[3:58:02.240 --> 3:58:06.320]  allen you know what's going to happen everybody's going to see who was right
[3:58:06.320 --> 3:58:11.280]  yes they will in our lifetime and allen you're very good at trying to set the
