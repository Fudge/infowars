[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.102]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.102 --> 00:00:12.683]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:14.243]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:18.425]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:22.467]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.478 --> 00:00:47.705]  It is the 19th day of November on this Thursday edition, the 19th day of November 2009.
[00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:54.651]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:54.651 --> 00:01:00.697]  Well, several days ago, Reverend Manning, living in New York City, a popular
[00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:19.350]  Church pastor and also radio host was visited by Homeland Security and the CIA and threatened and told he will soon be arrested, particularly because he's been covering the birth certificate issue.
[00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.071]  And I tell you, the Obama people sure act guilty on this topic.
[00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:30.712]  We certainly cover it and look at it and believe it's suspicious, but I don't make it my focal point.
[00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:46.424]  When criticizing Obama, the fact that Obama has lied about everything he's ever said or done and broken all of his pledges, that's what we can focus on and prove.
[00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:51.967]  But I don't really like even going after him for the birth certificate because then it makes it all about Obama.
[00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:56.470]  When Obama is just a front man like George W. Bush and Clinton and Bush Sr.
[00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.890]  before him.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.684]  Nevertheless, the persecution of Reverend Manning is very, very serious.
[00:02:02.684 --> 00:02:05.886]  He'll be joining us in T-minus 30 minutes.
[00:02:05.886 --> 00:02:12.071]  John Perkins will be popping in for 30 minutes, best-selling author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:14.773]  He's a big part of my film Fall of the Republic.
[00:02:14.773 --> 00:02:20.818]  I want to get a quick take from him on the state of the world and the banking system and the imploding economy.
[00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:25.522]  Then I had Webster Tarpley on a few days ago for just for 30 minutes breaking down
[00:02:27.173 --> 00:02:37.179]  His detailed essay that he wrote, investigative report, asking, is the Fort Hood shooter a patsy taking part in a drill?
[00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:43.343]  But separately, I wanted to have Tarpling on with the economy as we watch the slow destruction of the dollar.
[00:02:43.343 --> 00:02:46.525]  And then Alan Combs is coming back on.
[00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:53.269]  He has me four or five times a year on his syndicated radio show, and I like to have Combs up so we can spar back and forth.
[00:02:54.215 --> 00:03:03.078]  It's always interesting to hear somebody who denies there's a world government being formed, even when it's in hundreds of newspapers.
[00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:08.160]  Some will ask, why do we have establishment types on the show?
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.661]  Because you get to hear it directly from their own mouths.
[00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:14.362]  Why did I have David Rothschild on?
[00:03:14.362 --> 00:03:16.763]  Because it was extremely informative.
[00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:19.363]  Why do we have Alan Combs on?
[00:03:19.363 --> 00:03:20.864]  Because it's extremely revealing.
[00:03:22.671 --> 00:03:28.563]  And also, these are the people that end up having the courage to come on the radio show.
[00:03:28.563 --> 00:03:30.908]  Why did I have David Vickers on?
[00:03:30.908 --> 00:03:33.854]  Well, I've just seen him a few times on the news talking about the New World Order.
[00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:40.273]  I didn't really understand how hooked up he was with the Rockefellers and everybody else.
[00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:45.656]  But he's a friendly fellow, comes across amicable, kind of riding the fence.
[00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:51.280]  And certainly now that I know all of his globalist connections, I want him on more, not less.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.982]  I want to pick his brain next time he comes on.
[00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:57.004]  I'll be even more prepared next time.
[00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:01.307]  I'm not some omnipresent, all-knowing creature who can
[00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:05.014]  Know everything about everybody.
[00:04:05.014 --> 00:04:06.536]  No, I'm just like you.
[00:04:06.536 --> 00:04:07.056]  I'm learning.
[00:04:07.056 --> 00:04:14.562]  We're all learning as we go along, but I do appreciate Vickers and Combs and others coming on the show, having the courage to do it.
[00:04:14.562 --> 00:04:17.885]  I appreciate Vickers plugging me on Glenn Beck.
[00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:20.487]  Glenn Beck looked like he was about to have a heart attack two days ago.
[00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:21.527]  I haven't played this clip yet.
[00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:23.009]  We will today.
[00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.832]  So Reverend Manning, John Perkins, Webster Tarpoli, Alan Combs today.
[00:04:28.943 --> 00:04:33.211]  And by the way, we're just going to increase the production quality of the radio show.
[00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:36.176]  We're going to add a lot of features.
[00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:40.343]  I'm going to try to cover more news and more subjects here, jam more calls in, everything.
[00:04:43.246 --> 00:04:48.087]  And of course, play clips from the radio line, comment line, 512-646-4444.
[00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:59.010]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, WhatIsTheEndGame.com, TheObamaDeception.com.
[00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:06.854]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:05:06.854 --> 00:05:11.376]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:05:11.376 --> 00:05:13.658]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:15.278]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:16.319]  There is a solution.
[00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:24.988]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:05:24.988 --> 00:05:32.436]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:38.102]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[00:05:38.462 --> 00:05:44.486]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:05:44.486 --> 00:05:48.629]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[00:06:01.414 --> 00:06:10.562]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:06:10.562 --> 00:06:13.925]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:19.810]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.574]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:06:24.574 --> 00:06:26.936]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:06:27.196 --> 00:06:27.576]  I'm good.
[00:06:46.021 --> 00:06:49.726]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[00:06:49.726 --> 00:06:51.928]  That's O-X-Y-Silver.net.
[00:06:51.928 --> 00:06:57.115]  Or call about OxySilver, ZO Life, and GI Flora Pro, toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:06:57.115 --> 00:06:58.457]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:06:58.457 --> 00:06:58.917]  Do it now.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.682]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:07:04.682 --> 00:07:08.304]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:07:08.304 --> 00:07:12.886]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:07:12.886 --> 00:07:17.449]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:21.271]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes,
[00:07:21.271 --> 00:07:21.771]  We're good to go.
[00:07:40.982 --> 00:07:44.665]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.045 --> 00:08:21.687]  Big jam-packed radio transmission today.
[00:08:21.687 --> 00:08:25.011]  Reverend Manning coming up.
[00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:30.576]  John Perkins, Webster Tarpley, Alan Combs on this Thursday, the 19th day of November 2009.
[00:08:37.637 --> 00:08:56.092]  Also, we did an exclusive interview a few weeks ago when David Icke was in the United States, and I want to play 20 minutes or so of this today, the first 20 minutes of the hour-long interview, because it's particularly penetrating and informative and thought-provoking, whether you agree with David on issues or not.
[00:08:56.092 --> 00:08:58.775]  We're going to play that here for the radio listeners today.
[00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:03.078]  The video of the interview is posted for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:09.145]  So that is coming up later as well.
[00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:10.646]  Where to start?
[00:09:10.646 --> 00:09:16.350]  NSA is giving Microsoft some help on its Windows 7 security.
[00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:27.179]  I mean, now when they build back doors into your computer software, they just hide it in plain view and say, oh, they're helping us with security.
[00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:29.901]  Just absolutely illegal.
[00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:33.824]  All part of this technocracy we have running our society.
[00:09:35.592 --> 00:09:55.528]  Al Gore has come out with a new book and in it they have a photoshopped image of the earth with hurricanes all over it and with part of the United States being flooded and don't even tell people that it's photoshopped.
[00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.889]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:58.751]  It's just all fraud.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:08.783]  There's a bunch of articles here dealing with taxes that are part of the global greenhouse gas tax initiative being implemented at the state level.
[00:10:08.783 --> 00:10:16.026]  That's the strategy right now being used by the federal and international regulatory bodies is just bypass Congress entirely.
[00:10:16.026 --> 00:10:18.787]  California requires TVs to be more energy efficient.
[00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:23.929]  You heard Schwarzenegger say ban TVs above 40 inches period.
[00:10:25.512 --> 00:10:29.454]  And now the AP is reporting that it's even worse than that, so we'll let you know.
[00:10:29.454 --> 00:10:45.761]  And in the health care bill, not only are there rationing death panels, not only are there five years in prison, quarter million dollar fines if you don't get insurance or pay your 2.5 to 5% of your paycheck on top of it as a new tax to the government.
[00:10:45.761 --> 00:10:48.362]  Senate bill includes Botox tax.
[00:10:48.362 --> 00:10:50.643]  I mean, there's that type of stuff.
[00:10:50.643 --> 00:10:54.845]  There is a $5 billion estimated tax there.
[00:10:55.982 --> 00:10:59.865]  And Harry Reid gave a speech.
[00:10:59.865 --> 00:11:02.987]  We have time later, I'm going to play this, but it's up on Politico.
[00:11:02.987 --> 00:11:05.128]  They've got a video link to it.
[00:11:05.128 --> 00:11:07.850]  I believe Kurt Nemo is posting in a link to it on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.371]  I know I sent it to him.
[00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:21.098]  And Harry Reid gets up there and says, well, we're going to go ahead and pass this bill this week or next week.
[00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:21.979]  And this is historic.
[00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:31.242]  And it's going to cut spending and it's going to balance the budget.
[00:11:31.242 --> 00:11:45.708]  This is exactly what Obama's been saying now for a year and a half, since two years really, since he was on the campaign trail and now president for 11 months, sworn in for 11 months, elected over a year ago.
[00:11:45.708 --> 00:11:50.850]  And it's just such an insult to everyone's intelligence.
[00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.951]  Obama has
[00:11:56.041 --> 00:12:04.430]  Quadrupled the yearly deficit, spending more money.
[00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.292]  Currently, he spent $4 trillion.
[00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:10.857]  The exposure is over $20 trillion.
[00:12:10.857 --> 00:12:15.963]  But currently, it's like with your house bill, your car bill, your power bill, it's what you currently are due.
[00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:23.504]  That is more money than every president before him back to George Washington.
[00:12:23.504 --> 00:12:30.349]  And they're running around saying they're saving money and have cut the size of government.
[00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:37.714]  The lies have reached a level that is farcical.
[00:12:37.714 --> 00:12:46.901]  It's like the ADL and CBS News and all of their publications in the last two days attacking yours truly, saying I'm the big kingpin, king of conspiracy,
[00:12:48.126 --> 00:12:59.213]  Incredibly popular, dangerous, reaching too many people, implying I'm going to cause a violent overthrow and something has to be done with me.
[00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:01.015]  Anybody who listens knows that's a lie.
[00:13:01.015 --> 00:13:03.476]  I speak out against violence.
[00:13:03.476 --> 00:13:07.439]  I speak out against preemptive offensive attacks on this criminal system.
[00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:14.065]  And then the ADL says I'm lying and saying that there's a world government being set up when it's in the newspapers.
[00:13:14.065 --> 00:13:28.593]  People are going to see the ADL say that, open their newspaper up, and read New World Order, world government, every day in the papers, and they're going to go, well wait, how's this guy bad then if he's saying that?
[00:13:28.593 --> 00:13:32.355]  I think the ADL and the government and the establishment types really under...
[00:13:33.408 --> 00:13:39.633]  Estimate the work we've done and how many people we've woken up and overestimate their power.
[00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:44.737]  You're discredited and you're only discrediting yourself worse, just like with the mercury and the vaccines.
[00:13:44.737 --> 00:13:52.283]  They've told every school kid in America, they've handed out fact sheets at hospitals and colleges and businesses saying, oh, it's a myth there's mercury.
[00:13:52.283 --> 00:13:55.565]  There's a myth that can cause neurological disorders, Guillain-Barré.
[00:13:55.565 --> 00:14:00.049]  It's a myth that can hurt your autoimmune system or give you cancer or sterilize you.
[00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:02.471]  Then you read the insert and it says it can do all that to you.
[00:14:04.349 --> 00:14:11.575]  You guys are really blowing it for yourselves, and so good, keep it up.
[00:14:11.575 --> 00:14:18.902]  But I'm on the White House enemies list, many others are.
[00:14:18.902 --> 00:14:27.149]  We have been visited by the Secret Service, we have been visited by the FBI, with little excuses they use to come over here and they're asking all sorts of other questions.
[00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:28.830]  They look like they're on a rabbit hunt, they're in
[00:14:29.872 --> 00:14:30.854]  They're in hunting mode.
[00:14:30.854 --> 00:14:35.381]  You've seen a dog when you take it out hunting that knows you're about to shoot some birds.
[00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:39.448]  Well, they got the eyes, the look of retrievers.
[00:14:39.448 --> 00:14:42.432]  And to them, I'm like a big chew toy or something.
[00:14:45.182 --> 00:14:50.905]  This is now happening to Reverend Manning, but they're telling him, he says, that they're going to arrest him.
[00:14:50.905 --> 00:14:54.708]  And so this may be one of the last times we get to talk to him before he's behind bars.
[00:14:54.708 --> 00:14:56.629]  He's coming up in about 15 minutes.
[00:14:56.629 --> 00:15:03.213]  Let's go ahead and play his little four-minute announcement that we've got linked up on InfoWars.com if you want to go watch it for yourself.
[00:15:03.213 --> 00:15:03.533]  Here it is.
[00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:15.079]  I am James David Manning, pastor of the Ottlaw World Missionary Church in Harlem, Ottlaw, New York.
[00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:21.423]  I'm also the host of the daily radio broadcast called The Manning Report.
[00:15:22.777 --> 00:15:28.499]  On the 16th of November, 2009, on or about 6 p.m.
[00:15:28.499 --> 00:15:49.225]  in the afternoon, two CIA agents claiming to be members of Homeland Security and two New York City detectives came to our church to ask me questions regarding statements I have made about Barack Hussein, the long-legged mac daddy, Obama.
[00:15:50.535 --> 00:16:02.262]  They drew my attention, the agents did, to a posting on our website called, Tea Party Members Go Viral on the Birth Certificate.
[00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:09.947]  And in that particular posting, I stated that the long-legged Mac Daddy is invincible by the vote.
[00:16:11.078 --> 00:16:20.233]  But only should you turn your attention to the birth certificate issue, then he becomes outrageously vulnerable.
[00:16:21.192 --> 00:16:28.456]  He is indeed an illegal alien and is not qualified to be the U.S.
[00:16:28.456 --> 00:16:29.496]  President.
[00:16:29.496 --> 00:16:37.480]  But to spend all of my energy and time to overthrow this evil that has entered into our world.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:45.644]  As an American patriot, I'm compelled to fight to restore our Republic and its Constitution.
[00:16:47.017 --> 00:17:02.521]  I expect, as a result of the visit last night by the CIA and New York City police detectives, Homeland Security people, I expect to be arrested in not too many days.
[00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:13.644]  Therefore, I pray to explain the entire matter of the Dark Kingdom and my representation of light in these very dark and evil days.
[00:17:15.041 --> 00:17:21.969]  I will be charged with the threat against the life of the U.S.
[00:17:21.969 --> 00:17:22.670]  President.
[00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:33.482]  Understanding that I will be arrested, I wish to state to my church family, friends, and supporters that at present I am of a sound mind.
[00:17:34.485 --> 00:17:46.193]  That the evil, dark kingdom that is now led by Barack Hussein, the long-legged McDonnell Obama, that they in the U.S.
[00:17:46.193 --> 00:17:51.637]  will not take my freedom simply by placing me in chains.
[00:17:51.637 --> 00:18:01.784]  But they took the freedom from all of us with their acts of treason and their conspiracy to commit treason against the American people.
[00:18:02.739 --> 00:18:07.403]  Thusly, we all have lost our freedoms.
[00:18:07.403 --> 00:18:23.115]  I want you to know, my church family, friends and supporters, that I knowingly and willingly have submitted to my God, who asked me to serve Him in this cause and in this matter.
[00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:28.459]  And He alone has set my course, and He alone will be my judge.
[00:18:29.304 --> 00:18:52.101]  And so I say to Mr. Barack Hussein, the long-legged Mac Daddy Obama, members of the Central Intelligence Agency, Eric Holder, Leon Panetta, and all the others, that here I am, at the Otlaw World Missionary Church in Harlem, Otlaw, New York.
[00:18:52.101 --> 00:18:53.101]  You may come
[00:18:54.306 --> 00:18:55.586]  And arrest me.
[00:18:55.586 --> 00:18:57.027]  I am waiting.
[00:18:57.027 --> 00:18:59.127]  I will not resist.
[00:18:59.127 --> 00:19:03.628]  For I welcome that you would do so.
[00:19:03.628 --> 00:19:13.170]  And in doing so, we can finally bring this matter of your ineligibility to serve this great Republic.
[00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:19.531]  And your belligerent trashing of the Constitution can be brought to the American people.
[00:19:19.531 --> 00:19:21.152]  I await your arrest.
[00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:36.814]  I'm James David Manning, and I ask that God would bless all of us, and that He would save America.
[00:19:36.814 --> 00:19:43.097]  All right, he's scheduled to be on with us coming up here in about 14 minutes from now.
[00:19:43.097 --> 00:19:47.180]  John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, Webster Tarpley, Alan Combs.
[00:19:48.513 --> 00:19:49.794]  It's all coming up today.
[00:19:49.794 --> 00:19:52.616]  Totally jam-packed of news and information as well.
[00:19:52.616 --> 00:19:55.778]  Believe me, this is a broadcast you don't want to miss.
[00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:56.839]  InfoWars.com
[00:20:01.906 --> 00:20:02.546]  Hello.
[00:20:02.546 --> 00:20:07.309]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:20:07.309 --> 00:20:12.132]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:20:12.132 --> 00:20:17.135]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:20:17.135 --> 00:20:22.298]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[00:20:22.298 --> 00:20:23.559]  Boy, was I wrong.
[00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:26.521]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:30.564]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[00:20:30.564 --> 00:20:33.786]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[00:20:33.786 --> 00:20:34.327]  Wow!
[00:20:34.327 --> 00:20:35.848]  I watched the DVD last night.
[00:20:35.848 --> 00:20:37.069]  I was awestruck.
[00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.750]  What wonderful work you have done.
[00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.292]  This information can bless many people.
[00:20:41.292 --> 00:20:41.812]  Thank you.
[00:20:42.493 --> 00:20:43.233]  Thanks again!
[00:20:43.233 --> 00:20:46.356]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[00:20:46.356 --> 00:20:46.697]  Thank you.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.161]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:04.161 --> 00:21:05.022]  Spy on me?
[00:21:05.022 --> 00:21:05.342]  Yeah.
[00:21:05.342 --> 00:21:10.385]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:10.385 --> 00:21:12.025]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:12.025 --> 00:21:12.766]  Startpage?
[00:21:12.766 --> 00:21:14.287]  Yeah, Startpage.com.
[00:21:14.287 --> 00:21:17.248]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:17.248 --> 00:21:21.110]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.912]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:24.252 --> 00:21:26.873]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:26.873 --> 00:21:28.454]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:28.754]  Right!
[00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:32.076]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:32.076 --> 00:21:32.637]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:32.637 --> 00:21:33.997]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:33.997 --> 00:21:37.859]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:37.859 --> 00:21:41.642]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.041]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.041 --> 00:22:04.401]  November 19, 2009.
[00:22:04.401 --> 00:22:05.421]  Gold opened this morning at $1139.80.
[00:22:05.421 --> 00:22:08.843]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1170.76, $585.38 for a half ounce, or $292.69 for the quarter ounce.
[00:22:08.843 --> 00:22:09.403]  That's $1170.76, $585.38, or $292.69.
[00:22:21.733 --> 00:22:32.196]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:35.397]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:22:35.397 --> 00:22:38.778]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:22:38.778 --> 00:22:41.759]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:44.560]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.040]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.800]  Unlike your liberty,
[00:22:48.661 --> 00:22:49.802]  The paper is free.
[00:22:49.802 --> 00:22:52.703]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.703 --> 00:22:58.046]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.046 --> 00:23:02.028]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.028 --> 00:23:03.229]  The once mighty U.S.
[00:23:03.229 --> 00:23:06.251]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:08.912]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[00:23:08.912 --> 00:23:11.714]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[00:23:12.094 --> 00:23:16.378]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[00:23:16.378 --> 00:23:24.485]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders, and Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[00:23:24.485 --> 00:23:25.746]  Prepare now.
[00:23:25.746 --> 00:23:30.670]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:35.775]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish, with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:23:36.175 --> 00:23:40.957]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you're buying Factory Direct at wholesale prices.
[00:23:40.957 --> 00:23:43.158]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:23:43.158 --> 00:23:46.600]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you free of charge.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:46.900]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:46.980]  1-800-453-2202.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.901]  Or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[00:23:48.901 --> 00:23:49.962]  Factory Direct.
[00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:51.562]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:23:51.562 --> 00:23:52.203]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:24:10.255 --> 00:24:23.801]  Now that may be where political dissident Reverend Manning's going.
[00:24:23.801 --> 00:24:28.383]  Whether you love him or hate him, he's not been calling for any violence against the puppet in chief.
[00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:30.824]  I don't think anybody should try to hurt the puppet.
[00:24:30.824 --> 00:24:34.606]  That would make everybody think the puppet actually ran something instead of the real power structure.
[00:24:36.411 --> 00:24:40.877]  We haven't had a real president, ladies and gentlemen, who truly ran things since JFK.
[00:24:40.877 --> 00:24:46.685]  Reagan got a bit uppity with the vice president, the former CIA chief, and ooh, you know what happened to Reagan.
[00:24:46.685 --> 00:24:50.531]  Then after that little medical trip to the Air Force Base, he began to behave himself.
[00:24:52.498 --> 00:24:59.542]  Later when we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv, I'll replay these so folks can actually see the video, but the audio says it as well.
[00:24:59.542 --> 00:25:02.803]  And usually we don't play CNN's Kook of the Week or whatever.
[00:25:02.803 --> 00:25:05.965]  They almost always now use clips from my radio show.
[00:25:05.965 --> 00:25:16.190]  They wouldn't dare actually have me on, but CNN interviewed Oath Keeper Stuart Rhodes in a five-minute piece and let him talk
[00:25:17.093 --> 00:25:19.718]  Three times for about five, six seconds.
[00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:25.250]  They would always edit him down so that he couldn't get any information out.
[00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.176]  And they would show rooms full of
[00:25:29.338 --> 00:25:41.049]  Hundreds and hundreds of Oath Keepers meeting and they'd show the one guy with a big beard or the one person in flip-flops, not that you're bad if you have a big beard or flip-flops, to make people look kooky.
[00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:44.052]  It's akin to playing clown music in the background.
[00:25:44.052 --> 00:25:52.820]  And then when they were explaining they're non-partisan and just want police and military to uphold their oath, how can that be extremism like the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center are saying?
[00:25:55.956 --> 00:26:05.804]  They cut to the Obama deception, they cut to Fall of the Republic, and say, oh, the anti-Obama movie, Fall of the Republic.
[00:26:05.804 --> 00:26:18.375]  No, the whole film is about how Obama is just a puppet who is going to be built up and then politically destroyed so that all the political heat on the unpopular globalist agenda gets blamed on him.
[00:26:20.131 --> 00:26:28.320]  This is actually, in the long run, helping the individual Obama by letting people know he was just a front man.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.504]  And it helps the people of the world understand how the political system really works.
[00:26:32.504 --> 00:26:38.070]  It's not good for Obama, short term or even long run, for people to actually think he's running things.
[00:26:39.175 --> 00:26:47.002]  Now, I do think he's an evil, lying lawyer who knows what he's doing, but he is still mid-level, ladies and gentlemen, just like George W. Bush was.
[00:26:47.002 --> 00:27:03.657]  But they wanted to inject this statement about anti-Obama so that all of the Obama supporters watching would then hate Stuart Rhodes and the Oath Keepers, when Stuart Rhodes and the Oath Keepers were criticizing George Bush.
[00:27:03.657 --> 00:27:04.318]  They want
[00:27:05.134 --> 00:27:06.714]  to protect our country.
[00:27:06.714 --> 00:27:09.235]  They were also implying there's no FEMA camps.
[00:27:09.235 --> 00:27:18.077]  So Kurt Nimmo wrote a very important story up on InfoWars.com titled, CNN Propaganda Segment on Oath Keepers Demonizes Fall of the Republic.
[00:27:18.077 --> 00:27:28.460]  And he just links to ABC News, Houston Chronicle, Wall Street Journal, admitting the FEMA camps for political dissonance.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.960]  They've had congressmen on about it.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.001]  They've got legislation introduced to expand them.
[00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:39.433]  And the ADL put out a report two days ago saying there's no FEMA camps and we're insane liars.
[00:27:39.433 --> 00:27:42.677]  Look, it isn't going to work anymore.
[00:27:42.677 --> 00:27:53.247]  Here is a short clip where they try to invoke the left-right paradigm to divide everyone so that all the Democrats will hate Oath Keepers and think that it's an anti-Obama group.
[00:27:53.247 --> 00:27:53.568]  Here it is.
[00:27:54.816 --> 00:28:02.044]  ...to disobey any orders, as they put it, to disarm the American people or to force citizens into detention camps.
[00:28:02.044 --> 00:28:06.949]  It's a pledge Rhodes recites in an anti-Obama DVD called The Fall of the Republic.
[00:28:06.949 --> 00:28:09.912]  I will not obey orders to impose martial law.
[00:28:09.912 --> 00:28:11.054]  I will not obey.
[00:28:11.434 --> 00:28:20.026]  Mark Potok, who monitors extremist groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, says the Oath Keepers are exploiting false rumors found on fringe websites.
[00:28:20.026 --> 00:28:27.115]  Many of the Oath Keepers are people who believe that martial law is about to be imposed at any moment.
[00:28:30.013 --> 00:28:43.479]  We have the National Guard, the Regular Army, and the Marine Corps running checkpoints nationwide and engaging in flagrant violations of the Posse Comitatus Act under direct orders from the Pentagon.
[00:28:43.479 --> 00:28:55.124]  I mean, to go over the evidence, Army Times, they're announcing they're going to deploy 379,000 Regular Army troops on the streets of America phased in over the next three years.
[00:28:55.124 --> 00:28:57.465]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[00:28:58.666 --> 00:29:02.747]  It's crazy, but they're telling the public, hey, you're not supposed to discuss these issues.
[00:29:02.747 --> 00:29:04.887]  It's not kosher to talk about these topics.
[00:29:04.887 --> 00:29:11.689]  Here's a clip from Glenn Beck two days ago, where Damon Vickers plugged the show, and Beck looked like he was going to have a heart attack.
[00:29:11.689 --> 00:29:25.992]  There are a lot of conspiracy theories out there, and I had the benefit of doing the Alex Jones Show last night, and I heard a couple of them, and I'm not disputing that many of them may be actually true, but market forces are likely to take... You don't need a conspiracy theory.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.461]  Yeah, but market forces are likely to take us there anyway.
[00:29:30.461 --> 00:29:34.683]  The dollar is way too high, and other currencies are way too low.
[00:29:34.683 --> 00:29:38.384]  So what you're likely to see is a realignment of currencies.
[00:29:38.384 --> 00:29:42.046]  We obviously cannot... Say this in terms that people understand.
[00:29:42.046 --> 00:29:45.667]  A realignment of currencies doesn't mean anything.
[00:29:45.667 --> 00:29:50.889]  What it does mean is you're going to live closer to the standard... Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:52.470]  Stay with us.
[00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.870]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.391]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.398 --> 00:29:59.093]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.403 --> 00:30:05.404]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:05.404 --> 00:30:10.726]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:10.726 --> 00:30:12.787]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:12.787 --> 00:30:17.788]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:17.788 --> 00:30:18.969]  How much do you want?
[00:30:18.969 --> 00:30:20.089]  When do you want it?
[00:30:20.089 --> 00:30:21.970]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:23.050]  When will you need it?
[00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.251]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:25.251 --> 00:30:26.592]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:26.592 --> 00:30:27.892]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:28.112 --> 00:30:33.379]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:33.379 --> 00:30:36.964]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:36.964 --> 00:30:40.789]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:42.031]  How much will you need?
[00:30:42.031 --> 00:30:42.912]  We don't know.
[00:30:42.912 --> 00:30:44.034]  How much do you want?
[00:30:44.034 --> 00:30:44.975]  All you can get.
[00:30:44.975 --> 00:30:45.776]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:46.036 --> 00:30:49.078]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:06.707]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:31:06.707 --> 00:31:11.233]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:31:11.233 --> 00:31:13.516]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:31:13.516 --> 00:31:15.138]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:31:15.138 --> 00:31:16.180]  There is a solution.

[00:32:50.898 --> 00:32:51.598]  No more Mr. Nice Guy!
[00:33:17.313 --> 00:33:21.079]  From the Obama administration.
[00:33:21.079 --> 00:33:25.105]  We of course first told you here that there was a White House enemies list.
[00:33:25.105 --> 00:33:32.035]  Then it came out in mainstream newspapers and I'm listed in the top 25 of enemies by Barack H Obama.
[00:33:32.952 --> 00:33:38.837]  Because of my film, The Obama Deception, and they also listed the upcoming fall, The Republic, which is now out.
[00:33:38.837 --> 00:33:41.279]  CNN has attacked us over the film.
[00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:50.946]  CBS Nightly News, The Jerusalem Post, the ADL of all groups, The New Republic, Salon.
[00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:56.551]  They are openly saying, I've got to be taken down, I'm dangerous, I'm calling for violence, when I never
[00:33:57.455 --> 00:34:02.156]  Call for violence and we speak out against agent provocateurs and violence.
[00:34:02.156 --> 00:34:03.817]  I am being set up.
[00:34:03.817 --> 00:34:08.438]  We've had the Secret Service here twice probing around.
[00:34:08.438 --> 00:34:12.139]  We have had the FBI here probing around.
[00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:21.722]  So I take this very, very seriously when it happens to another broadcaster and a pastor who's protected doubly under the First Amendment and who I've never heard call for any violence.
[00:34:22.522 --> 00:34:29.427]  James David Manning is a chief pastor of the ATLA World Missionary Church at 123rd Street in New York City.
[00:34:29.427 --> 00:34:34.731]  ATLA stands for All the Land Anointed Holy, which is God's name for Harlem.
[00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:44.518]  Manning graduated from the College of New Rochelle with a Bachelor of Arts degree and continued on to the Union Theological Seminary in New York City, where he was awarded a Master of Divinity.
[00:34:44.518 --> 00:34:48.741]  Manning also holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the ATLA Theological Seminary in
[00:34:49.361 --> 00:34:51.902]  And we really appreciate him coming on.
[00:34:51.902 --> 00:34:59.165]  He has a radio show and a very popular television program called The Manning Report.
[00:34:59.165 --> 00:35:07.549]  And I've gotten a lot of calls, a lot of emails the last two days since we linked to a video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:08.789 --> 00:35:13.750]  Where he talks about a very threatening meeting he had with the Secret Service slash CIA.
[00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:19.392]  And if you don't know, the CIA works with the local New York police and the Secret Service.
[00:35:19.392 --> 00:35:21.093]  That's been admitted.
[00:35:21.093 --> 00:35:24.654]  And he said in the report that he believes he will be arrested.
[00:35:24.654 --> 00:35:32.516]  So to give us full details on what happened for the rest of this hour is Pastor James David Manning.
[00:35:32.516 --> 00:35:35.997]  And whether you love him or hate him, and I happen to really like him and he's a man of great courage and
[00:35:36.357 --> 00:35:38.258]  Thank you very much, Alex, for having me on.
[00:35:38.258 --> 00:35:40.179]  I'm really delighted to be on your broadcast today.
[00:36:03.699 --> 00:36:19.125]  And let me say right away, I have, as millions of other Americans have benefited greatly from your precise, eagle-eyed vision teaching of what's happening in this nation from a political point of view, from a Federal Reserve point of view.
[00:36:19.125 --> 00:36:32.991]  You know, the Obama deception to fall of the Republic has really become the college, the university, the place of education of Americans for actually how our government works globally, financially,
[00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:44.360]  We've all benefited greatly from your tireless expertise, so I just want to thank you for informing me of so many things that I could not have known without having gone through all of your presentations.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.681]  Well, God bless you, Pastor.
[00:36:45.681 --> 00:36:49.004]  You've informed us of a lot as well.
[00:36:49.004 --> 00:37:01.093]  Why do you think that the, and this has been reported on the Senate floor by Senator Alexander, why do you think that we are now
[00:37:03.044 --> 00:37:16.488]  Witnessing this attempt to intimidate myself, yourself, and many others, and then blow by blow, that's why everybody's tuning in right now, what exactly happened at your church earlier this week?
[00:37:16.488 --> 00:37:31.833]  Well, to answer your first question first, I believe, there are several things, and I pray that the audience will understand this in the light of which I mean it, I believe that Obama and all of his backers are convinced that they have the power,
[00:37:32.702 --> 00:37:34.462]  To overthrow this nation.
[00:37:34.462 --> 00:37:41.324]  Therefore, they're not intimidated by the idea of threatening arrest or preparing to arrest.
[00:37:41.324 --> 00:37:54.486]  In many ways, a visit to your office, as they've done, could be very much a test of the American response to see how quickly or if the American people will remain afleet to this.
[00:37:54.486 --> 00:38:01.648]  The next time they come to your, not mine, but to your ministry or office, it may be for the full arrest and you'll never be seen again.
[00:38:02.268 --> 00:38:08.251]  To answer the second question, basically the same thing, but here's what happened on this past Monday night.
[00:38:08.251 --> 00:38:14.033]  Just three days ago, at 6 o'clock in the evening, I had just finished a broadcast that I do on the Manning Report.
[00:38:14.033 --> 00:38:25.878]  I just did my salutation for the evening and someone knocked on the door and told me that Homeland Security was in the building and they wanted to speak to me.
[00:38:26.901 --> 00:38:30.244]  Well, I was in a different part of the building, so I said, all right, okay, bring them up.
[00:38:30.244 --> 00:38:31.305]  What am I going to do?
[00:38:31.305 --> 00:38:32.946]  They're here.
[00:38:32.946 --> 00:38:41.974]  They came up, two members of Homeland Security who identified themselves as CIA agents, and I thought that was interesting.
[00:38:41.974 --> 00:38:47.219]  I thought that would be for foreign intrigue or foreign concerns.
[00:38:47.219 --> 00:38:50.081]  And then they said also we're part of Homeland Security.
[00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:51.663]  They also had with them
[00:38:52.321 --> 00:39:02.645]  Two members who were detectives of the 28th Precinct New York City Police Department, but the detectives that they had were part of the riot control.
[00:39:02.645 --> 00:39:06.086]  I know those two detectives because I've worked in this community for quite some time.
[00:39:06.086 --> 00:39:07.827]  They knew me.
[00:39:07.827 --> 00:39:16.930]  Outside of the building were other Homeland Security officers with the Secret Service, the CIA, and other riot police flanking the building.
[00:39:17.719 --> 00:39:25.824]  No, I've never said anything that indicated that I'm against violence or that I'm for violence, rather, or that I would respond violently.
[00:39:25.824 --> 00:39:32.448]  I've never indicated that in anything that I've said since I've been talking about Obama or preaching or anything else.
[00:39:32.448 --> 00:39:35.509]  They came prepared for violence.
[00:39:35.509 --> 00:39:38.431]  They came into my study and stated they wanted to talk to me.
[00:39:38.431 --> 00:39:41.333]  And I asked them, well, what did you want to talk about?
[00:39:42.378 --> 00:40:10.297]  They pointed out that I stated, uh, in one of the video postings a week or so ago, uh, that I addressed the Tea Party people, telling them how futile it was running around doing what they were doing, because they were getting nowhere, and if they spent the money and energy that they spent on the birth certificate issue, his eligibility, uh, they could get somewhere, and then we could finally bring him to trial,
[00:40:11.178 --> 00:40:16.263]  And we could find him guilty of treason and execute him and shoot him.
[00:40:16.263 --> 00:40:22.109]  That's what I said, and they didn't respond to me by saying, are you saying shoot the president?
[00:40:23.166 --> 00:40:28.990]  I then asked them if I was under arrest, and they said no.
[00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.352]  Then I said, I have nothing further to say to you.
[00:40:31.352 --> 00:40:32.833]  So I'm not under arrest.
[00:40:32.833 --> 00:40:34.394]  They got up and they left.
[00:40:34.394 --> 00:40:36.876]  One fella left his card.
[00:40:36.876 --> 00:40:39.018]  The part of the Homeland Security Group.
[00:40:39.018 --> 00:40:40.138]  They walked out.
[00:40:40.138 --> 00:40:42.981]  I haven't seen Hyde in the hair of them since.
[00:40:42.981 --> 00:40:46.543]  I do expect, however, to be arrested.
[00:40:46.543 --> 00:40:47.944]  I mean, I've thought about this.
[00:40:47.944 --> 00:40:48.925]  I've prayed about it.
[00:40:48.925 --> 00:40:50.246]  I've looked at it carefully.
[00:40:51.316 --> 00:40:58.239]  And I'm sure that what they're doing simply was to test the waters.
[00:40:58.239 --> 00:40:59.119]  And not so much.
[00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:00.380]  They know who I am.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.180]  They've studied everything I've said.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:06.702]  I have not advocated the overthrow of the government.
[00:41:06.702 --> 00:41:11.484]  I've not advocated violence towards the government.
[00:41:11.484 --> 00:41:15.065]  Indeed, I've advocated the upholding of the Constitution.
[00:41:15.859 --> 00:41:29.166]  I think what they were doing, and I'm clear about it now, is they want to see what kind of support I have and how would the American people respond to a writ.
[00:41:29.933 --> 00:41:35.817]  I believe the people that have been visited by the Secret Service, Homeland Security, all are going to be arrested shortly.
[00:41:35.817 --> 00:41:36.938]  Well, not shortly.
[00:41:36.938 --> 00:41:38.459]  By tomorrow, I mean.
[00:41:38.459 --> 00:41:47.886]  But in due course, if you've been visited by the Secret Service under the Obama administration, except we remove them from office, you're going to be arrested.
[00:41:47.886 --> 00:41:50.768]  They're not dumb, the Secret Service Department.
[00:41:50.768 --> 00:41:56.012]  They test once that you go on their black list or their enemy's list or Obama's enemy's list.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.000]  They come and test you.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.361]  They come and test a response.
[00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:02.082]  They come and test their case against you.
[00:42:02.082 --> 00:42:03.503]  But they've already made the decision.
[00:42:03.503 --> 00:42:04.923]  You're going to be arrested.
[00:42:04.923 --> 00:42:06.804]  It's going to happen.
[00:42:06.804 --> 00:42:09.625]  Either that or they're going to assassinate you.
[00:42:09.625 --> 00:42:18.228]  Well, to be clear, I had not seen the video you're discussing in question, and I know that you've never called for any violence.
[00:42:18.228 --> 00:42:24.511]  Specifically, you're saying through a judicial process, if
[00:42:25.743 --> 00:42:28.686]  Anyone was found guilty of treason or high treason.
[00:42:28.686 --> 00:42:31.689]  We know what the penalties are under federal law.
[00:42:31.689 --> 00:42:37.595]  My issue, Pastor Manning, and I don't believe you threatened the President, and I believe it was your First Amendment right to say that.
[00:42:37.595 --> 00:42:38.676]  My issue is...
[00:42:40.217 --> 00:42:48.662]  If anything ever happened to Obama, they would turn him into a martyr, a saint, when he is a larger front for the overall New World Order.
[00:42:48.662 --> 00:42:54.004]  I know from your research you believe he is even more evil and more powerful than that.
[00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:55.165]  Maybe you're right.
[00:42:55.165 --> 00:43:04.050]  He is very charismatic and very slick and is certainly the 2.0 of New World Order puppet, but I certainly hope
[00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:13.455]  That the Secret Service doesn't come and arrest you because you've stated you're not calling for violence, you're calling for... That's what I have done repeatedly.
[00:43:13.455 --> 00:43:20.539]  I've appealed to all Americans, far and wide, please protect this man's life.
[00:43:20.539 --> 00:43:21.580]  Do him no harm.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:27.585]  The worst thing that could happen, in my view, is for someone to assassinate him.
[00:43:27.585 --> 00:43:28.606]  There are two reasons why.
[00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:39.055]  Number one is that we would probably never get the opportunity to demonstrate his ineligibility and the fraud that he has perpetrated on this nation, all the people that have put him up to it.
[00:43:39.535 --> 00:43:43.720]  But even more important than that, he would be turned instantly into a martyr.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.503]  He would be more popular and powerful than Jesus.
[00:43:46.503 --> 00:43:50.929]  He's already more popular and powerful than Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
[00:43:50.929 --> 00:43:52.230]  Don't kill this man.
[00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:55.714]  I've said that repeatedly over and over again.
[00:43:55.714 --> 00:43:56.735]  I need him alive.
[00:43:56.735 --> 00:43:57.937]  I want him to live.
[00:43:59.597 --> 00:44:01.598]  And I have heard you say that repeatedly.
[00:44:01.598 --> 00:44:04.179]  So we're on the same page there then.
[00:44:04.179 --> 00:44:10.081]  Well, you were smart not to not to talk to them there on their fishing expedition.
[00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:17.044]  But the way you describe them coming in in force is very, very concerning.
[00:44:17.044 --> 00:44:19.445]  My issue is the few times they've been here.
[00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:42.905]  They always claim that they're here for one reason, but then they start bringing up other issues and asking me my views on the president and asking me my views on my listeners and probing and then calling my employees, not just coming, but calling random extensions and asking my employees things about my operation, about our servers, about our websites.
[00:44:45.126 --> 00:44:53.152]  I just wonder how they get so many men to willfully engage in Nazi or slash Soviet or Maoist tactics.
[00:44:53.152 --> 00:45:00.417]  I mean, that's very un-American to have political police or commissars like they had in Russia creeping around.
[00:45:00.417 --> 00:45:06.381]  And I certainly hope that your discernment's wrong, but I know you do have, I do respect you and respect your discernment.
[00:45:08.766 --> 00:45:19.328]  Alex, the riot control police officer who is in charge of community affairs here in the Harlem area, I know him.
[00:45:19.328 --> 00:45:24.810]  We've had to interact with him on several issues regarding our schools.
[00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:30.651]  Not that there's violence, but community meetings to help make the community safer.
[00:45:30.651 --> 00:45:34.612]  So he's involved in reaching out to pastors and clergy.
[00:45:34.612 --> 00:45:35.892]  So I know him well.
[00:45:37.542 --> 00:45:46.670]  When they all came in, when I heard that Homeland Security was downstairs, I immediately thought I was going to be arrested.
[00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:49.793]  I was cornered.
[00:45:49.793 --> 00:45:58.000]  The only thing I had for defense was to look them in the eye to see what I could instantly read, even before they spoke to me.
[00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:08.339]  The Homeland Security leader spokesperson came in first, through the door first, followed by the second Homeland Security person who identified themselves as CIA agents.
[00:46:08.339 --> 00:46:09.800]  I'm still concerned about that.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.842]  Oh, I'm sure they were.
[00:46:11.842 --> 00:46:13.024]  They did that to terrorize you.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.705]  Yeah, I would think that that would be a foreign concern.
[00:46:17.705 --> 00:46:20.910]  It's illegal, but they still do it.
[00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:26.398]  Governor Jesse Ventura, two weeks into office, was told there's people waiting for him in the basement.
[00:46:26.398 --> 00:46:28.360]  25 CIA agents wouldn't even tell him his name.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.644]  They were just there bossing him around.
[00:46:32.121 --> 00:46:36.485]  I mean, when they said CIA, I mean, they'll be the last thing.
[00:46:36.485 --> 00:46:39.107]  FBI, okay, I can handle that.
[00:46:39.107 --> 00:46:40.188]  It was intimidating.
[00:46:40.188 --> 00:46:43.170]  It shook me for just a moment.
[00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:47.053]  The two detectives that walked in, I tried to look them in the eye.
[00:46:47.053 --> 00:46:50.876]  They looked down, they looked everywhere, except they would not look at me.
[00:46:50.876 --> 00:46:52.698]  And I'm thinking to myself, how can these men,
[00:46:53.338 --> 00:46:56.920]  Come to this church after they've watched me all these years.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.822]  They know my track record in this community.
[00:46:59.822 --> 00:47:07.766]  With such riotous ideas, flanking this church, preparing, and maybe they thought they could provoke me into something and start a fight.
[00:47:07.766 --> 00:47:09.227]  I mean, I have several employees here.
[00:47:09.227 --> 00:47:12.369]  I have several people, you know, just milling, just in the building.
[00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:14.670]  It's a church, you know, and we're active every day, 24-7.
[00:47:16.249 --> 00:47:18.410]  Maybe they thought they could provoke a riot or something.
[00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:19.671]  I don't know what they were thinking.
[00:47:19.671 --> 00:47:22.532]  But I can tell you this, I know they're coming back.
[00:47:22.532 --> 00:47:23.613]  I know that they are.
[00:47:23.613 --> 00:47:27.995]  Even though it may be some time, they will be back.
[00:47:27.995 --> 00:47:37.261]  Well, sir, we have contacts in the White House that we've spoken to, and I've talked to other members of the press who also have contacts.
[00:47:37.261 --> 00:47:40.402]  They do watch your videos.
[00:47:40.402 --> 00:47:42.784]  They do analyze this show every day.
[00:47:44.804 --> 00:47:51.406]  Across the board, the power elite are paying attention to what many of us are doing.
[00:47:51.406 --> 00:47:53.126]  We've got a few minutes until we go to break.
[00:47:53.126 --> 00:48:06.890]  Would you like to directly address the CIA, the Secret Service, the American Commissars, and the man who goes by the name Barack H. Obama, Barry Sitaro.
[00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:08.611]  Would you like to address them?
[00:48:08.611 --> 00:48:13.412]  Yes, and he has yet another name, the long-legged magnetic, which is an official name for him.
[00:48:14.685 --> 00:48:21.851]  Having the privilege to do so, I would want to say that, first of all, I am an American patriot.
[00:48:21.851 --> 00:48:27.397]  I love this nation with all of the strength and love that I can possibly muster.
[00:48:27.397 --> 00:48:31.240]  And I will stand in defense of this nation and its great Constitution.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:37.426]  It is the greatest nation on the planet, and there's never been one like it, except for maybe the nation of Israel.
[00:48:37.426 --> 00:48:38.207]  Having said that,
[00:48:38.887 --> 00:48:58.482]  I earnestly and sincerely, at the point of life and death, believe that Barack Hussein Obama is ineligible to serve this great republic that he has stolen from all of us, our heritage, and is on track to destroying our Constitution.
[00:48:58.482 --> 00:49:00.263]  He does not have a birth certificate.
[00:49:00.963 --> 00:49:03.364]  And the Constitution is not his.
[00:49:03.364 --> 00:49:09.167]  What he wants to do is to destroy our Constitution and our birthright to this nation.
[00:49:09.167 --> 00:49:10.768]  I will not relent.
[00:49:10.768 --> 00:49:18.232]  I'm prepared to go to jail if that is what it takes to demonstrate my commitment and to awaken the American people.
[00:49:18.937 --> 00:49:22.101]  Come, put me in chains, I am prepared to do that.
[00:49:22.101 --> 00:49:33.053]  But I am not prepared to live in this nation knowing in my heart that this nation has been robbed by Barrister Toro, Barack Hussein Obama, the long-legged back daddy.
[00:49:33.053 --> 00:49:39.541]  So I say to all of those who are considering my actions and possibilities of my actions, I will not relent.
[00:49:40.515 --> 00:49:50.577]  This brutal visit by the Homeland Security coming and polluting our sanctuary and church has only made me fight more tenaciously.
[00:49:50.577 --> 00:49:56.018]  You have not seen me fight as of prior to your coming.
[00:49:56.018 --> 00:49:57.858]  I will not relent.
[00:49:57.858 --> 00:50:00.179]  Obama will be overthrown.
[00:50:00.179 --> 00:50:01.679]  He will be overthrown.
[00:50:01.679 --> 00:50:06.260]  Even if I am assassinated, he will be overthrown and exposed for what he is.
[00:50:08.362 --> 00:50:11.424]  And by overthrown, you're talking about impeachment?
[00:50:11.424 --> 00:50:24.492]  I'm talking about court-martialed, trial, treason, and the appropriate judgment of found guilty of treason.
[00:50:24.492 --> 00:50:31.036]  Well, that is... I tell you, you have a lot of courage, Pastor Manning, a lot of courage, because
[00:50:33.174 --> 00:50:42.936]  Because certainly, they are listening to every word you are saying right now, and you just aren't, have a lot of courage.
[00:50:42.936 --> 00:50:49.157]  It's really, I'm speechless here today, the power of what Pastor Manning is saying.
[00:50:49.157 --> 00:50:55.258]  We'll be right back with the final five minutes with our guest on the other side, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:55.258 --> 00:50:58.619]  We'll also give you his ministry's website on the other side of the break.
[00:51:02.273 --> 00:51:11.435]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:14.795]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:51:14.795 --> 00:51:20.657]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[00:51:20.657 --> 00:51:25.438]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:51:25.438 --> 00:51:27.778]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:51:28.078 --> 00:51:28.458]  I'm good.
[00:51:46.889 --> 00:51:50.611]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[00:51:50.611 --> 00:51:52.812]  That's O-X-Y, Silver.net.
[00:51:52.812 --> 00:51:57.794]  Or call about OxySilver, ZO Life, and GI Flora Pro, toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:51:57.794 --> 00:51:59.315]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:51:59.315 --> 00:51:59.795]  Do it now.
[00:52:02.336 --> 00:52:05.499]  Do you want to get away from additives and preservatives in your food?
[00:52:05.499 --> 00:52:08.141]  Need alternatives to conventional food preparation?
[00:52:08.141 --> 00:52:10.723]  Do you want to save the fruits of your gardening labor?
[00:52:10.723 --> 00:52:13.085]  And are you looking for an excellent gift idea?
[00:52:13.085 --> 00:52:15.267]  Then check out the Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:52:15.267 --> 00:52:19.971]  Dehydration is one of the healthiest, most cost-effective, and fun ways to feed yourself and your family.
[00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:22.773]  Make healthy snacks like fruit roll-ups and beef jerky.
[00:52:22.773 --> 00:52:26.857]  Store healthy food in case of an emergency with no added salts, fats, or preservatives.
[00:52:26.857 --> 00:52:30.480]  And save hundreds of dollars by drying it yourself with the Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.140]  I think so.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:01.756]  Excalibur Dehydrator!
[00:53:02.765 --> 00:53:09.969]  AaronAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.

[00:53:18.775 --> 00:53:23.538]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:53:23.538 --> 00:53:27.480]  AaronAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.603]  AaronAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:53:31.843 --> 00:53:32.323]  I think so.
[00:54:10.302 --> 00:54:22.008]  Atla.org, A-T-L-A-H.org, A-T-L-A-H.org is Pastor James David Manning's ministry website.
[00:54:22.008 --> 00:54:24.610]  We appreciate him coming on the show.
[00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:35.916]  Again, I'm rarely truly speechless, but just the power and the commitment that I heard in your voice when you said he will be defeated, he will be removed from office.
[00:54:37.176 --> 00:54:42.258]  I tell you, you are certainly standing up like George against the Dragon.
[00:54:42.258 --> 00:54:45.379]  Well, I have no choice in this matter.
[00:54:45.379 --> 00:54:56.822]  I suppose that the commitment in my voice is also my love for this nation and my being a soldier of the truth.
[00:54:57.981 --> 00:55:00.524]  Uh, and it's great rewards.
[00:55:00.524 --> 00:55:06.412]  More specifically, this nation is worth standing up for.
[00:55:06.412 --> 00:55:08.294]  There's just no question about it.
[00:55:08.294 --> 00:55:11.058]  It's worth every ounce of strength anybody gives to it.
[00:55:12.711 --> 00:55:22.375]  Well, they may not arrest you because you've pointed out that it will only give you more attention and the birth certificate more attention.
[00:55:22.375 --> 00:55:26.797]  And people will ask, well, Pastor Manning didn't call for violence.
[00:55:26.797 --> 00:55:30.999]  He said that if Obama's committed treason, he should get in trouble for it.
[00:55:30.999 --> 00:55:32.900]  I mean, I don't know if I agree that
[00:55:34.295 --> 00:55:35.596]  I think that if Americans
[00:55:58.254 --> 00:55:58.494]  I think?
[00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:25.399]  I suppose supporters of goons from the Federal Reserve and the powers that be than Obama in terms of in his cabinet membership.
[00:56:25.399 --> 00:56:36.261]  I believe, I'm confident as well, that when he tumbles that it will cause light to be shown, a crack will be then seen into all of what you have discussed with respect
[00:56:36.832 --> 00:56:37.333]  We're good to go.
[00:56:54.482 --> 00:56:57.604]  Well, he is definitely their man.
[00:56:57.604 --> 00:57:05.909]  I mean, giving him a Nobel Prize for peace when he's expanding the wars, the way they worship him, they certainly do want to turn him into a god.
[00:57:05.909 --> 00:57:11.393]  And now Al Gore says his global warming movement is a religion.
[00:57:11.393 --> 00:57:12.774]  These people really are devilish.
[00:57:13.354 --> 00:57:15.335]  No, there's no doubt about that.
[00:57:15.335 --> 00:57:23.817]  But the thing I think that we definitely will keep focused on is we've not had anyone as vulnerable at present.
[00:57:23.817 --> 00:57:27.098]  There's never been anyone as elevated as him.
[00:57:27.098 --> 00:57:28.738]  And his fall, again,
[00:57:31.255 --> 00:57:33.116]  We'll expose all of them.
[00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:47.161]  They have given, I mean, for the American people to allow him to accept that Nobel Prize for Peace is just unthinkable that there are people that are out of an outrage at the absurdity of the entire matter.
[00:57:47.161 --> 00:57:55.184]  I mean, Americans ought to be standing and saying, no, we don't want this fraud, any more fraud perpetrated on us through this man.
[00:57:55.575 --> 00:58:00.480]  Well, Pastor, unfortunately we're out of time, but hopefully you won't be arrested by next week.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:07.608]  I'd like to get you up sometime in the next few weeks for a full hour to really go through your beliefs and the important views you have for us.
[00:58:07.608 --> 00:58:15.816]  And also, as a black American, a patriotic American, the way Obama's people have been invoking race and actually creating racial division.
[00:58:15.816 --> 00:58:17.018]  Do you agree he's been doing that?
[00:58:17.418 --> 00:58:18.599]  Oh, no doubt about that.
[00:58:18.599 --> 00:58:22.722]  He's been using it most proficiently.
[00:58:22.722 --> 00:58:24.263]  I'd love to discuss that with you.
[00:58:24.263 --> 00:58:28.425]  You'll call me back, and I'd love to be able to have the time to spend an hour with you, Alex.
[00:58:28.425 --> 00:58:32.048]  You're a great American, and God bless you for all the work that you've done.
[00:58:32.048 --> 00:58:34.849]  You've educated all of us, and we thank you for that.
[00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:37.231]  I thank you, Pastor, and you're in our prayers.
[00:58:37.231 --> 00:58:38.992]  You're definitely in the lion's den.
[00:58:38.992 --> 00:58:40.013]  Go with God, my friend.
[00:58:42.498 --> 00:58:48.123]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:48.123 --> 00:58:51.766]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:51.766 --> 00:58:56.309]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:56.309 --> 00:59:00.653]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:59:00.653 --> 00:59:06.057]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:06.377 --> 00:59:07.118]  It's true.
[00:59:07.118 --> 00:59:12.823]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:12.823 --> 00:59:16.406]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:16.406 --> 00:59:21.131]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:21.131 --> 00:59:23.893]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:27.236]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:28.337 --> 00:59:32.478]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:32.478 --> 00:59:37.540]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:59:54.804 --> 00:59:57.206]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.206 --> 01:00:06.633]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.633 --> 01:00:07.934]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.934 --> 01:00:09.715]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.715 --> 01:00:10.876]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.876 --> 01:00:13.037]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.037 --> 01:00:13.978]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.978 --> 01:00:18.782]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:22.865]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:29.008]  Well, he's a multi-time best-selling author.
[01:00:30.854 --> 01:00:37.479]  Amongst the titles, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, a multi-time New York Times number one bestseller.
[01:00:37.479 --> 01:00:39.401]  He's got the new book out doing quite well.
[01:00:39.401 --> 01:00:42.143]  Packed crowds on his road trip across the United States.
[01:00:42.143 --> 01:00:45.626]  Hoodwinked as the new book, he's in San Francisco today.
[01:00:45.626 --> 01:00:52.291]  John Perkins was recruited by the National Security Agency during his last year at Boston University School of Business Administration.
[01:00:52.291 --> 01:00:58.817]  In 68, he spent the next three years in the Peace Corps in South America, and then in 71, joined the international consulting firm.
[01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:11.896]  And it goes on from there and he became a top economic hitman helping bring down third world countries under the global banking cartel and corporate cartels control.
[01:01:11.896 --> 01:01:15.841]  And we have him joining us today for the next 30 minutes.
[01:01:15.841 --> 01:01:18.163]  John, it's great to have you here with us.
[01:01:18.163 --> 01:01:18.684]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:01:18.684 --> 01:01:20.206]  It's wonderful to be with you as always.
[01:01:21.431 --> 01:01:25.995]  We see the economic meltdown intensifying.
[01:01:25.995 --> 01:01:35.084]  You've likened this in your books and previous interviews to the same strategy the financial powers have used in third world nations.
[01:01:35.084 --> 01:01:40.590]  Can you break down your job as an economic hitman and put it in context with the larger picture we witness today?
[01:01:41.778 --> 01:01:43.681]  Yeah, I'll be glad to.
[01:01:43.681 --> 01:01:52.353]  We did a lot of different things, but the most common was to identify countries with resources that corporations cover, usually third world countries or something like oil.
[01:01:52.353 --> 01:01:55.818]  Range a huge loan to that country from the World Bank or its affiliates.
[01:01:56.852 --> 01:01:58.854]  However, that money never went to the country.
[01:01:58.854 --> 01:02:12.726]  Instead, it went to our own corporations to build infrastructure projects in the country, like power plants and industrial parks, things that would benefit a few wealthy families, as well as our companies, but would leave the rest of the country just holding a big debt.
[01:02:12.726 --> 01:02:17.551]  People couldn't afford electricity, couldn't get jobs, and industrial parks are still holding a huge debt.
[01:02:17.551 --> 01:02:20.153]  And so we'd go back and say, listen, you can't pay your debt.
[01:02:20.888 --> 01:02:25.673]  So sell your oil, real cheap to our oil companies, without any environmental restrictions.
[01:02:25.673 --> 01:02:26.754]  Vote with us on a U.N.
[01:02:26.754 --> 01:02:30.098]  vote, or let us build a military plant on your soil.
[01:02:30.098 --> 01:02:42.832]  And when we fail, which wasn't too often, Alex, but I talk in my books about how I failed with Jaime Roldo's democratically elected president of Ecuador, and with Omar Torrijos of Panama, the jackals go in and either overthrow governments,
[01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:44.659]  Or assassinate the leaders.
[01:02:44.659 --> 01:02:52.482]  And in the case of both Roldos and Torrijos, because I wasn't able to bring them around to corrupt them, they were both assassinated.
[01:02:52.482 --> 01:02:58.505]  When all else fails, then and only then, like in Iraq, the military goes in.
[01:02:58.505 --> 01:03:01.946]  And I think we can see an analogy here.
[01:03:01.946 --> 01:03:05.908]  In this country, we've gotten people to take on huge debts that they can't pay.
[01:03:07.372 --> 01:03:07.732]  Thank you.
[01:03:25.619 --> 01:03:33.325]  I'm watching people right here in San Francisco right now, out on the street, demonstrating, picketing a big hotel here.
[01:03:33.325 --> 01:03:36.727]  And it reminds me, I talk in hoodwinked about a guy like that.
[01:03:36.727 --> 01:03:37.428]  I talked with him.
[01:03:37.428 --> 01:03:44.153]  He told me that he just was headed out for the picket line when some man appeared and reminded him that he had a big mortgage on his home.
[01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:45.494]  And he didn't go on the picket line.
[01:03:46.307 --> 01:03:48.427]  That makes us afraid to pick it.
[01:03:48.427 --> 01:03:49.668]  It makes us afraid to do anything.
[01:03:49.668 --> 01:03:57.809]  He was afraid if he did that he would lose his job, not be able to pay for his home, not be able to pay the mortgage, lose his wife, lose everything.
[01:03:57.809 --> 01:04:02.390]  And debt is something that really inflates us.
[01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:09.152]  And we use that extensively in the third world and now it's being used tremendously in this country as well as many other techniques.
[01:04:09.152 --> 01:04:14.533]  I want to get your perspective before you leave us, because I'm trying to get different views on this, on solutions.
[01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.810]  I think so.
[01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:45.491]  The Pentagon that are really in control.
[01:04:45.491 --> 01:04:47.372]  And how do we even have a debate with these people?
[01:04:47.372 --> 01:04:52.014]  Because we can, for a dialogue, we can all have our own solutions, our own ideas.
[01:04:52.014 --> 01:04:55.156]  The problem is they've got their own idea and they're in the driver's seat.
[01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:58.938]  John Perkins, author of Hoodwinked, a bestseller in stores now, is our guest.

[01:06:01.775 --> 01:06:09.498]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:15.601]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[01:06:15.601 --> 01:06:18.262]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:06:18.562 --> 01:06:24.826]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.

[01:06:34.511 --> 01:06:36.593]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:38.355]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:06:38.355 --> 01:06:40.877]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:06:40.877 --> 01:06:45.602]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:06:45.602 --> 01:06:49.325]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:06:49.325 --> 01:06:52.448]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:52.448 --> 01:06:54.350]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:56.452]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:06.315]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:06.315 --> 01:07:09.919]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:09.919 --> 01:07:14.724]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:14.724 --> 01:07:21.131]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:21.131 --> 01:07:23.354]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:23.894 --> 01:07:24.194]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:24.194 --> 01:07:24.694]  Bernanke?
[01:07:24.694 --> 01:07:25.375]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.675]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:28.896]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:42.782 --> 01:07:44.643]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:50.065]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:07:50.065 --> 01:08:07.093]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:07.093 --> 01:08:08.393]  Big Brother.
[01:08:08.393 --> 01:08:09.354]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:10.143 --> 01:08:14.145]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a power-packed broadcast today.
[01:08:14.145 --> 01:08:23.291]  We had Reverend Manning on in the last hour, John Perkins for the next 30 minutes, and Webster Tarbley on the economy, Alan Combs,
[01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:43.089]  Alan Combs, the syndicated radio broadcaster and author.
[01:08:43.089 --> 01:08:48.262]  We're going to have a debate with him, find out what we agree on, what we disagree on, coming up in the last hour today.
[01:08:49.977 --> 01:09:01.664]  There have been some other huge breaking news stories, so at the bottom of the hour, you'll want to stay with us, some huge breaking news stories concerning this radio show, Al Gore, everything that's going on.
[01:09:01.664 --> 01:09:11.349]  This radio show, I'm not bragging, it's actually freaking me out, is being propelled into the mainstream everywhere, and I'm trying to figure out exactly what is going on.
[01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:13.210]  Let me ask John Perkins this.
[01:09:13.210 --> 01:09:14.711]  John, I suddenly have
[01:09:15.879 --> 01:09:27.381]  The right wing, the left wing, the CBS News, the ADL, I don't even really talk about Israel, Salon, the New Republic, all
[01:09:28.959 --> 01:09:29.680]  Talk to you
[01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:47.011]  Well, it's hard to say, Alex.
[01:10:04.972 --> 01:10:21.576]  If they're going to do something to you, they don't talk too much about you ahead of time, unless they're really painting a bad picture so that you become a bad guy that the Patriot Act can go after and they can put you away someplace in some little room closet in some penitentiary where nobody will ever see you again for the rest of your life.
[01:10:21.576 --> 01:10:22.777]  I doubt if they're going to do that to you.
[01:10:22.777 --> 01:10:24.217]  You're a little too public for that, I think.
[01:10:24.795 --> 01:10:41.910]  But I will say this, I spoke at the United Nations last week, I also last week spoke to 2,400, at a conference of 2,400 MBA students up at Cornell, last night here in San Francisco, in Portland, the other, I'm speaking all over the country, people keep coming up to me and telling me that they've seen me in your film.
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:48.322]  And your film's great, and your film's getting out there, and that's probably what's going on here.
[01:10:48.322 --> 01:10:55.744]  So, you know, I would take it as a compliment, if I were you, and good publicity, but I'd also keep looking over my shoulder.
[01:10:55.744 --> 01:10:57.365]  You know, just be careful.
[01:10:57.365 --> 01:11:01.426]  I think the best defense is to keep getting the word out, and get the word out that you're a little scared.
[01:11:02.396 --> 01:11:03.397]  Exactly.
[01:11:03.397 --> 01:11:13.402]  And get the word out that if something strange happens to you in the next few months, nobody should accept the fact that you're suicidal or whatever.
[01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:16.564]  Let me just say this.
[01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:20.086]  I told my guys two weeks ago when it came out to mail you a copy.
[01:11:20.086 --> 01:11:24.168]  If you haven't been home yet or haven't seen it yet, I'll mail several more, but you are in.
[01:11:24.168 --> 01:11:28.131]  Follow the Republic, breaking down the economy, and we really appreciate you, John Perkins.
[01:11:28.131 --> 01:11:30.052]  But I know you went through a lot.
[01:11:30.512 --> 01:11:36.435]  When you went public against these people, and I know had some dirty tricks, but you came through that.
[01:11:36.435 --> 01:11:38.236]  And I think something else is happening.
[01:11:38.236 --> 01:11:50.061]  I think a lot of people in the establishment itself, like you, but this happened to you years ago, it's happening to them now, are really realizing that the system we've created, even if you're a member of the elite,
[01:11:50.621 --> 01:11:55.788]  Or a high-level operative for them, like in your case, is bad for your children and grandchildren.
[01:11:55.788 --> 01:12:00.714]  And I think a lot of people in the power structure are really starting to have second thoughts about all of this.
[01:12:01.564 --> 01:12:02.144]  I agree with you.
[01:12:02.144 --> 01:12:10.066]  You know, in the last 30, 40 years, we've created what I call a mutant viral form of capitalism, predatory capitalism.
[01:12:10.066 --> 01:12:17.108]  And the sole goal, you know, was expressed by the economist Milton Friedman and really embraced by Ronald Reagan and every U.S.
[01:12:17.108 --> 01:12:26.511]  president since, Democrat and Republican alike, the goal that the only responsibility of business is to create profits, regardless of social and environmental costs.
[01:12:26.511 --> 01:12:27.451]  That's a new concept.
[01:12:28.021 --> 01:12:35.424]  Keynes, the guy I learned under, in his theories when I was a business student, he was much more compassionate.
[01:12:35.424 --> 01:12:41.986]  The other side of that is, there should be no regulations on business because it just gets in the way of profits, and business should own everything.
[01:12:41.986 --> 01:12:45.548]  Everything should be privatized, including the military and the police, etc., etc., etc.
[01:12:46.866 --> 01:12:50.108]  And so that's taken us to an extremely dangerous world.
[01:12:50.108 --> 01:12:54.050]  It's brought us to a system that's just unviable, that's not working.
[01:12:54.050 --> 01:13:01.735]  And I think everybody recognizes that, except the few very powerful and rich people at the top who've gotten a lot more rich and powerful.
[01:13:01.735 --> 01:13:05.016]  For them, the system is working, at least in the short run.
[01:13:05.016 --> 01:13:06.737]  But the rest of us are getting it.
[01:13:06.737 --> 01:13:09.739]  And I think you're finding a tremendous rebellion in the system.
[01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:11.000]  When that starts to happen,
[01:13:11.873 --> 01:13:15.056]  The corporateocracy, the people in control, dig in.
[01:13:15.056 --> 01:13:16.597]  For every action, there's a reaction.
[01:13:16.597 --> 01:13:27.067]  As I travel around talking to MBA students and college students who are going to go into business, I've seen, Alex, in the last five years, a tremendous change in attitude amongst them.
[01:13:27.067 --> 01:13:30.309]  They're really talking a lot more about social responsibility.
[01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:31.671]  Thank you very much.
[01:13:44.747 --> 01:13:55.614]  Trying to navigate this minefield with your unique experience and perspective, certainly there is an overall agenda of a world elite.
[01:13:55.614 --> 01:14:00.496]  They tend to think the same, they have conferences and meetings, but there are power structure
[01:14:01.497 --> 01:14:05.159]  Fissures and divisions and different camps from my study.
[01:14:05.159 --> 01:14:06.580]  A. Do you agree with that?
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:15.786]  And B. How would you break down these different corporate structures that you describe as like clouds over the surface of the globe?
[01:14:15.786 --> 01:14:17.347]  They're above all the nations.
[01:14:17.347 --> 01:14:20.129]  They're exempt from the laws that they put on the rest of us.
[01:14:21.226 --> 01:14:29.635]  Yeah, we're at a time in history, Alex, it's like when city-states became nations, except today the nations are losing their relevance and their power, and so are the presidents.
[01:14:29.635 --> 01:14:38.424]  It's the big corporations, as you pointed out, these big clouds sweeping around the planet that know no national borders or don't listen to any specific sets of laws.
[01:14:39.501 --> 01:14:41.223]  They're not a coherent group.
[01:14:41.223 --> 01:14:45.547]  I don't really subscribe to a conspiracy theory, because these people don't have to get together.
[01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:47.629]  A lot of them don't even know each other.
[01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:51.273]  There's not a lot in common between Exxon, for example.
[01:14:52.173 --> 01:14:52.754]  That's a great analogy.
[01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:53.514]  Yes, you're right.
[01:15:14.989 --> 01:15:15.690]  It is like that.
[01:15:15.690 --> 01:15:17.732]  And they're doing it.
[01:15:17.732 --> 01:15:19.413]  And they've created an unviable world.
[01:15:19.413 --> 01:15:22.916]  We've created an economic system that's a total failure.
[01:15:22.916 --> 01:15:28.802]  Less than 5% of the world's population lives in the United States, consumes more than 25% of our resources.
[01:15:28.802 --> 01:15:34.547]  10% of those people own almost all the assets in the United States and a great deal of the world.
[01:15:35.814 --> 01:15:40.316]  Nearly half the world in the meantime is starving or on the verge of starvation.
[01:15:40.316 --> 01:15:45.018]  That's not a model you can sell to China or India or Latin America or Africa.
[01:15:45.018 --> 01:15:45.898]  That's a failure.
[01:15:45.898 --> 01:15:47.379]  It's a failed system.
[01:15:47.379 --> 01:15:48.699]  And so there's only one conclusion.
[01:15:48.699 --> 01:15:50.440]  We have to change it.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.242]  And the people who are benefiting from that system are not going to want to see it change.
[01:15:55.242 --> 01:15:56.782]  So they're going to resist very strongly.
[01:15:56.782 --> 01:16:00.824]  But we, the people, must get out there and force the system to change.
[01:16:02.659 --> 01:16:08.485]  But how do we do that without these different corporate interests misdirecting our energies?
[01:16:08.485 --> 01:16:24.603]  Because they're so good at coming in with a phony template and co-opting activist groups or creating their own activist groups for their own kind of reform-oid counterfeits of real reform.
[01:16:25.731 --> 01:16:28.133]  Well, the how-to is a large part of Hoodwinked.
[01:16:28.133 --> 01:16:30.736]  It's why I wrote the book Hoodwinked.
[01:16:30.736 --> 01:16:33.879]  My passion just rose to the surface.
[01:16:33.879 --> 01:16:37.403]  My daughter gave me a grandson two years ago.
[01:16:37.403 --> 01:16:39.045]  He's now two years old.
[01:16:39.045 --> 01:16:47.053]  And this baby's really driving my passion because I realized that if we stay the course, his world when he's my age six decades from now is going to be ugly.
[01:16:47.662 --> 01:16:59.764]  But we have the opportunity to change it, and we must recognize that the only way my grandson is going to inherit a sustainable, just, and peaceful world is if every child on the planet has that same expectation, and it's realized.
[01:16:59.764 --> 01:17:08.366]  This is the first time in history that this has been the case, where our own self-interest here in the United States is driven by a world self-interest.
[01:17:08.366 --> 01:17:12.826]  We can't have homeland security until we recognize the whole planet as our homeland.
[01:17:12.826 --> 01:17:16.307]  And this is very new, where we've become such a small, integrated planet.
[01:17:16.872 --> 01:17:22.716]  And so, the book Hoodwinked is all about that, but very, very briefly, I think a couple of things.
[01:17:22.716 --> 01:17:31.381]  These big corporations are dependent on us to buy their goods and services, or on our tax dollars to buy their goods and services.
[01:17:31.381 --> 01:17:33.422]  As consumers, we have a lot of power.
[01:17:33.422 --> 01:17:35.243]  As taxpayers, we have a lot of power.
[01:17:35.243 --> 01:17:45.249]  I often think, what if we really demanded of our government to take even a small share, to start with, of the military budget, pay the same companies, General Dynamics, Raytheon, whoever,
[01:17:49.312 --> 01:18:09.410]  But see, they don't want to do that even though they would still make just as much money because it would make those third world and developing world people educated and strong and self-sufficient which in the long run the elite believes could displace them and that's stated in a lot of
[01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:12.471]  Absolutely correct, in terms of the people who are currently running the corporatocracy.
[01:18:12.471 --> 01:18:14.052]  But they're getting old.
[01:18:36.542 --> 01:18:43.406]  And with the new brand coming along, I'm really running into it in business schools that understand something different happening.
[01:18:43.406 --> 01:18:50.071]  I was just lecturing two weeks ago at Howard University in Washington, D.C., their law school.
[01:18:50.071 --> 01:18:53.753]  Most of the students there are African Americans or from Africa directly.
[01:18:53.753 --> 01:19:01.478]  And we talked a lot about Africa, how Africa has more resources than any other continent on the planet, and yet the poorest people.
[01:19:01.478 --> 01:19:03.139]  And Latin America is second
[01:19:03.743 --> 01:19:11.793]  And now we've seen a huge revolution in Latin America, where 10 countries have voted in democratically presidents who are saying no to this exploitation.
[01:19:11.793 --> 01:19:23.207]  And yet I was asked to speak at a conference of CEOs of many of the companies that are taking minerals out of Latin America, extractive companies.
[01:19:23.638 --> 01:19:26.701]  And I asked, why do you want an ex-economic hitman to speak to you?
[01:19:26.701 --> 01:19:29.485]  You know, someone wrote a book, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[01:19:29.485 --> 01:19:34.570]  And they said, because we realized that we can no longer get away with raping and plundering.
[01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:37.293]  They didn't use those words, but that's what they said.
[01:19:37.293 --> 01:19:39.476]  And yet, we still want the minerals.
[01:19:39.476 --> 01:19:44.942]  So, we want you to help us understand how we can work better with these people, how we can become better community members.
[01:19:45.549 --> 01:19:49.251]  And I think, Alex, we're seeing that in the new generation that's coming up.
[01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:57.075]  Well, I agree that there's some awakening happening, but also you're hurting them, so they want to be able to analyze you.
[01:19:57.075 --> 01:19:57.816]  Stay there.
[01:19:57.816 --> 01:19:59.757]  John Perkins is our guest.
[01:19:59.757 --> 01:20:00.417]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:19.074]  We're good.
[01:20:36.004 --> 01:20:36.704]  We're good to go.
[01:21:03.735 --> 01:21:07.764]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:07.764 --> 01:21:11.011]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:11.011 --> 01:21:12.434]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:21:13.146 --> 01:21:15.807]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:15.807 --> 01:21:22.188]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:22.188 --> 01:21:27.750]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:37.372]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:39.834]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:39.834 --> 01:21:41.436]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:41.436 --> 01:21:43.898]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:43.898 --> 01:21:46.021]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:46.021 --> 01:21:51.166]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:51.166 --> 01:22:00.355]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:02.242 --> 01:22:08.927]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:08.927 --> 01:22:17.053]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:17.053 --> 01:22:25.219]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:25.219 --> 01:22:29.963]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:30.283 --> 01:22:35.507]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:35.507 --> 01:22:39.869]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:39.869 --> 01:22:40.950]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:44.973]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:22:50.361 --> 01:22:53.345]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:23:04.932 --> 01:23:09.475]  Healthy Hearts Club presents Heart and Body Extract.
[01:23:09.475 --> 01:23:11.896]  Supports clean, clear arteries.
[01:23:11.896 --> 01:23:13.777]  Healthy blood pressure levels.
[01:23:13.777 --> 01:23:15.959]  Healthy circulation and blood flow.
[01:23:15.959 --> 01:23:18.140]  Regular heart rate and beat.
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:20.722]  What if you could avoid heart attacks?
[01:23:20.722 --> 01:23:24.084]  What if you could avoid emergency room visits?
[01:23:24.084 --> 01:23:26.605]  What if you could avoid surgery?
[01:23:26.605 --> 01:23:27.205]  How?
[01:23:27.205 --> 01:23:28.206]  With this.
[01:23:28.206 --> 01:23:30.047]  Heart and Body Extract.

[01:23:31.508 --> 01:23:32.829]  No negative side effects.
[01:23:33.249 --> 01:23:33.769]  I think so.
[01:24:04.475 --> 01:24:05.317]  Yeah.
[01:24:14.926 --> 01:24:17.028]  This is an abbreviated interview with John Perkins.
[01:24:17.028 --> 01:24:20.831]  I look forward sometime when he comes to Austin getting him in studio with us.
[01:24:20.831 --> 01:24:24.094]  He is in my new film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:24:24.094 --> 01:24:26.936]  I'm glad to hear he's hearing a big buzz on the street about it.
[01:24:26.936 --> 01:24:32.301]  Get a copy at Infowars.com or call toll free to get your copy of Fall of the Republic.
[01:24:32.301 --> 01:24:39.046]  You can get some of my other films free and part of the combo packs when you order it at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:24:39.046 --> 01:24:39.267]  Hoodwinked.
[01:24:43.717 --> 01:24:47.840]  Confessions of an Economic Hitman and other books he's written are really having a big effect.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.363]  And somebody that constantly gets brought up to me when I'm on other talk radio shows is John Perkins.
[01:24:52.363 --> 01:24:59.469]  And it's another testament to the idea of if we just take action, over time we can affect change in a positive way.
[01:24:59.469 --> 01:25:03.732]  But don't expect things in this instant gratification society to be overnight.
[01:25:03.732 --> 01:25:06.154]  I use the analogy or parallel.
[01:25:07.394 --> 01:25:14.059]  Of 10 years ago you couldn't find organic food in most grocery stores, now it's displacing the GMO crap.
[01:25:14.059 --> 01:25:21.464]  So that's how we vote with our dollars and that's what John Perkins really is an expert at, is showing people how to vote with their dollars.
[01:25:21.464 --> 01:25:24.887]  Do you still think that's one of the most powerful tools we have, John?
[01:25:25.888 --> 01:25:27.889]  I absolutely do, Alex.
[01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:34.674]  You know, we've seen in the past, like, we got rid of apartheid in South Africa because we didn't buy from companies that supported it.
[01:25:34.674 --> 01:25:49.844]  We got big corporations to clean up terribly polluted rivers in this country, to bring in more women and minorities into their employment ranks, to get rid of hormones and trans fats and food and animals.
[01:25:49.844 --> 01:25:52.126]  We've had a lot of success on specific issues.
[01:25:52.982 --> 01:26:03.527]  But now we need to ratchet that up a notch and say we're only going to buy from companies that are committed to creating a sustainable, peaceful, and socially just world.
[01:26:03.527 --> 01:26:11.291]  And you know, for the first 100 years in this country, no corporation could get chartered unless it proved that it was serving a public interest.
[01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:15.773]  Charters last about 10 years on average, and they have to go back to get re-charted.
[01:26:16.742 --> 01:26:25.524]  That all changed in the late 1800s when the Supreme Court decided that corporations have the same rights as individuals without the responsibilities.
[01:26:25.524 --> 01:26:33.587]  But I think we need to go back to some laws that forced these companies to be good citizens, environmentally and socially.
[01:26:33.587 --> 01:26:38.088]  And to start with, to get those laws moving into place, you and I and all of your listeners
[01:26:38.624 --> 01:26:40.145]  Well, that's like Walmart!
[01:26:54.492 --> 01:27:01.880]  I mean, we know Walmart is a predatory company that owns slave operations, slave wages around the world.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.764]  We know they come in and sell under price, which isn't free market.
[01:27:05.764 --> 01:27:08.227]  It's predatory, destroy all their competition.
[01:27:08.227 --> 01:27:12.752]  I will not buy from Walmart because I know it's killing our country.
[01:27:13.689 --> 01:27:14.730]  Likewise, I agree.
[01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:20.993]  And if we have a real consumer revolt, if we talk about it enough and get people out there, we can have an impact.
[01:27:20.993 --> 01:27:23.615]  In fact, we are having an impact on Walmart.
[01:27:23.615 --> 01:27:26.676]  I think that they're slacking off a little bit.
[01:27:26.676 --> 01:27:28.077]  They're getting better environmentally.
[01:27:28.077 --> 01:27:29.198]  That's a good thing.
[01:27:29.198 --> 01:27:30.798]  But it's not nearly, nearly good enough.
[01:27:30.798 --> 01:27:33.960]  But it shows you that we do have an impact.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.402]  And we just need to have a much greater impact.
[01:27:36.402 --> 01:27:42.445]  And we need to convince these companies that they, to their advantage, to level the playing field, that none of them is going to survive.
[01:27:43.183 --> 01:27:49.271]  In a world that we're headed toward now, that in the long run we've all got to do a better job.
[01:27:49.271 --> 01:27:51.034]  I mean, it's self-evident.
[01:27:51.034 --> 01:27:53.877]  You have to be sustainable or you go out of existence.
[01:27:53.877 --> 01:27:58.063]  And that's the course that we're on right now, is one toward going out of existence.
[01:27:58.823 --> 01:28:01.325]  They better recognize us, too, and we need to force them.
[01:28:01.325 --> 01:28:08.290]  And I am encouraged by the students that I'm seeing in universities and business schools now that I think are getting it a lot more.
[01:28:08.290 --> 01:28:15.215]  They're being influenced by Al Gore's movie, by the Constant Gardner movies like Blood Diamond, so many books up there.
[01:28:15.715 --> 01:28:22.477]  Films like yours, this show, there's so much that's going on that I think the new generation is coming up with a new sense of consciousness.
[01:28:22.477 --> 01:28:24.578]  But see, that's the only place we differ.
[01:28:24.578 --> 01:28:37.161]  I think what Al Gore is doing about making it all about carbon dioxide, that that becomes a distraction from all the other real environmental issues and the type of solutions that you come up with.
[01:28:37.161 --> 01:28:38.862]  I mean, I think that's...
[01:28:39.682 --> 01:28:51.169]  That's where we differ, but overall, I know that you are just trying to get people involved, and simply getting the public involved is the start to them finding out what's really true and accurate.
[01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:56.952]  John Perkins' new book, of course, is already a bestseller out there, and it's titled Hoodwinked.
[01:28:56.952 --> 01:29:00.114]  His website is johnperkins.org.
[01:29:00.114 --> 01:29:04.817]  John, in closing, in the last minute we have left, tell us about your speaking tour and how folks will come out and see you.
[01:29:05.768 --> 01:29:07.649]  Well, yeah, I'm traveling all over.
[01:29:07.649 --> 01:29:10.030]  Go to johnperkins.org.
[01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:14.371]  Not dot com, that's some, I don't know, some crazy guy, but dot org.
[01:29:14.371 --> 01:29:19.433]  And also, you can reach me through Twitter at economics underscore hitman.
[01:29:19.974 --> 01:29:22.516]  If I know where I am, I'd love to meet with your people and get out there.
[01:29:22.516 --> 01:29:25.278]  And incidentally, I agree with what you said about the Al Gore thing.
[01:29:25.278 --> 01:29:29.702]  But I do think that every bit of that sort of stuff is helping to wake people up.
[01:29:29.702 --> 01:29:30.843]  And we need to go much further.
[01:29:30.843 --> 01:29:33.445]  Sure, it gets people thinking and creates a debate.
[01:29:33.445 --> 01:29:40.151]  I mean, getting people to not just watch football and start even thinking about political issues is the first step in the solution.
[01:29:40.151 --> 01:29:41.592]  John, thank you so much.
[01:29:41.592 --> 01:29:44.194]  And people can find out at johnperkins.org.
[01:29:44.194 --> 01:29:45.235]  Correct about the speaking tour?
[01:29:46.539 --> 01:29:46.679]  Right.
[01:29:46.679 --> 01:29:48.102]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[01:29:48.102 --> 01:29:48.763]  Thank you.
[01:29:48.763 --> 01:29:49.524]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:49.524 --> 01:29:50.726]  Have a great week and take care.
[01:29:50.726 --> 01:29:53.029]  There goes John Perkins.
[01:29:53.029 --> 01:29:54.411]  We're on the march.
[01:29:54.411 --> 01:29:56.955]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.955 --> 01:29:59.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.926 --> 01:30:11.071]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:30:11.071 --> 01:30:14.452]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:30:14.452 --> 01:30:20.315]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[01:30:20.315 --> 01:30:25.098]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:30:25.098 --> 01:30:27.439]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:30:27.619 --> 01:30:28.039]  Thank you.
[01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:50.252]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[01:30:50.252 --> 01:30:52.453]  That's O-X-Y-Silver.net.
[01:30:52.453 --> 01:30:57.435]  Or call about OxySilver, ZO Life, and GI Flora Pro, toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:30:57.435 --> 01:30:58.976]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:30:58.976 --> 01:30:59.436]  Do it now.
[01:31:02.591 --> 01:31:05.592]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:05.592 --> 01:31:10.915]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:10.915 --> 01:31:12.976]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:12.976 --> 01:31:17.978]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:17.978 --> 01:31:19.159]  How much do you want?
[01:31:19.159 --> 01:31:20.279]  When do you want it?
[01:31:20.279 --> 01:31:22.160]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:23.241]  When will you need it?
[01:31:23.241 --> 01:31:25.442]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:25.442 --> 01:31:26.782]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:26.782 --> 01:31:28.083]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:28.303 --> 01:31:33.567]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:33.567 --> 01:31:37.150]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:37.150 --> 01:31:40.972]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:40.972 --> 01:31:42.193]  How much will you need?
[01:31:42.193 --> 01:31:43.094]  We don't know.
[01:31:43.094 --> 01:31:44.215]  How much do you want?
[01:31:44.215 --> 01:31:45.135]  All you can get.
[01:31:45.135 --> 01:31:45.816]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:46.216 --> 01:31:46.437]  I think?
[01:32:01.584 --> 01:32:08.566]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:32:08.566 --> 01:32:10.647]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:32:10.647 --> 01:32:12.887]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:32:12.887 --> 01:32:14.548]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:32:14.548 --> 01:32:19.029]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:32:19.029 --> 01:32:21.590]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:32:32.395 --> 01:32:35.216]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:37.938]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:32:37.938 --> 01:32:45.102]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:32:49.127 --> 01:32:49.388]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:49.388 --> 01:32:51.310]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:33:17.796 --> 01:33:19.899]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:19.899 --> 01:33:22.042]  Central, 3 p.m.
[01:33:22.042 --> 01:33:27.971]  Central, four hours of live radio.
[01:33:27.971 --> 01:33:33.979]  When I saw the headline at RushLimbaugh.com, the top of the website,
[01:33:35.703 --> 01:33:41.725]  I mean, the mega-alert headline, I almost fell out of my chair.
[01:33:41.725 --> 01:33:45.547]  We started getting flooded with tickets and calls here to the office at Limbaugh.
[01:33:45.547 --> 01:33:50.429]  Went on and on and on about PrisonPlanet.com today.
[01:33:50.429 --> 01:33:53.930]  And how great the reporting is on Al Gore and his fraud.
[01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:56.812]  I mean, I have been a big critic of Rush Limbaugh.
[01:33:56.812 --> 01:33:57.732]  What is going on here?
[01:33:59.744 --> 01:34:05.767]  Limbaugh's talked about me, I don't know, 10-15 times over the years that I know of.
[01:34:05.767 --> 01:34:08.588]  He does have 20-something million listeners a day.
[01:34:08.588 --> 01:34:10.709]  He is the biggest media event out there.
[01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:14.451]  TV, cable, it's all fractured into thousands of channels.
[01:34:14.451 --> 01:34:20.473]  But Rush Limbaugh is the Mac Daddy of talk radio, period.
[01:34:22.396 --> 01:34:27.640]  I check his site out maybe once a week, and he has a giant headline at the very top of the page.
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:31.903]  The entire top of the page says, Prison Planet.
[01:34:31.903 --> 01:34:36.807]  With hurricanes at 30-year low, Gore turns to Photoshop.
[01:34:36.807 --> 01:34:47.095]  And Gore has specifically, Rush Limbaugh has specifically attacked Prison Planet two times I know of.
[01:34:47.095 --> 01:34:48.136]  We've played the clips here.
[01:34:48.136 --> 01:34:49.737]  In fact, we can probably dig those up on YouTube.
[01:34:51.242 --> 01:34:53.897]  I think the title is Limbaugh Attacks Prison Planet.
[01:34:56.181 --> 01:35:02.706]  Well, I mean, he just loves to talk about Prison Planet, usually in a bad light, and now here he is.
[01:35:02.706 --> 01:35:04.948]  Limbaugh, we know, is the daily reader of the site.
[01:35:04.948 --> 01:35:07.009]  We know Glenn Beck is.
[01:35:07.009 --> 01:35:12.313]  I mean, two days after we have a guest on there on Glenn Beck, I want to say hi to the Glenn Beck people.
[01:35:12.313 --> 01:35:23.862]  What's happened is they realize, because the corporations all track web numbers and statistics and radio affiliate numbers, and we're on a lot of small mom-and-pop stations, some big stations,
[01:35:24.642 --> 01:35:39.431]  But we're on, in places like Chicago, and stations going to San Francisco, and San Diego, and Miami, and Buffalo, and Knoxville, Tennessee, the list goes on and on.
[01:35:39.431 --> 01:35:46.095]  Austin, Texas, and little bitty stations that we're on are now beating big talk stations.
[01:35:46.095 --> 01:35:47.336]  Now sometimes it takes a year.
[01:35:48.376 --> 01:35:57.398]  But tiny stations have shown up big time, I mean 500 waters in some cases, have shown up with no ratings, suddenly, boom!
[01:35:57.398 --> 01:36:01.119]  Two books later, Arbitron, big ratings, and it gets bigger and bigger.
[01:36:01.119 --> 01:36:08.782]  And so they know that this show is hotter than a firecracker, because we're just telling the truth!
[01:36:08.782 --> 01:36:16.264]  And we're shattering the left-right paradigm, and I don't know what's going on with all the media coverage.
[01:36:16.264 --> 01:36:17.724]  CBS, negative.
[01:36:20.128 --> 01:36:38.017]  I mean, I can list all the... I mean, it's every day 10, 15, 20 big newspapers talk about Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and what we're doing, and they talk about us like we're some type of grizzly bear stalking the night that's going into people's homes and eating them.
[01:36:38.017 --> 01:36:44.521]  I mean, it's like I'm some giant fire-breathing black dragon stomping across the landscape, and we're not.
[01:36:46.127 --> 01:36:46.547]  I don't
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.823]  Talking about the films, The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic.
[01:37:07.823 --> 01:37:09.444]  You know who deserves all the credit for this?
[01:37:09.444 --> 01:37:10.625]  You, the listeners.
[01:37:10.625 --> 01:37:15.888]  We are really forcing the mainstream media to address the New World Order, the world government.
[01:37:15.888 --> 01:37:18.750]  For decades they denied it, but they lost all credibility denying it.
[01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:21.032]  Now they admit it, but try to put their spin on it.
[01:37:21.032 --> 01:37:24.555]  I'm going to talk more about this coming up.
[01:37:24.555 --> 01:37:25.936]  We do have Alan Combs.
[01:37:27.308 --> 01:37:29.251]  The radio broadcaster, TV host joining us.
[01:37:29.251 --> 01:37:31.214]  That should be an interesting debate.
[01:37:31.214 --> 01:37:35.219]  We've got Webster Tarpley coming up for 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:37:35.219 --> 01:37:36.701]  And I do have a bunch of audio clips.
[01:37:36.701 --> 01:37:38.303]  We have the listener comment line.
[01:37:38.303 --> 01:37:39.405]  I've got a bunch of those.
[01:37:39.405 --> 01:37:41.808]  In fact, where's my call sheet?
[01:37:41.808 --> 01:37:43.210]  My guys are so professional now.
[01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:46.952]  They printed me up out of the hundreds of calls.
[01:37:46.952 --> 01:37:52.238]  They printed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 different calls they think we should play, and I agree with them.
[01:37:52.238 --> 01:37:57.764]  We're going to play those after Tarpley's on with us, and I'm going to answer these questions.
[01:37:57.764 --> 01:38:02.910]  Some days we won't take calls when we've got four or five guests, but we will always play your calls from the
[01:38:03.951 --> 01:38:04.512]  Phone system.
[01:38:04.512 --> 01:38:07.995]  That way we also know they're informative or good questions.
[01:38:07.995 --> 01:38:09.556]  And a lot of days we'll just take phone calls.
[01:38:09.556 --> 01:38:14.140]  I'm going to really mix the show up as we've been doing lately because I got to go to the next level here.
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:23.167]  I've got so many listeners, so many viewers and sometimes I get a little bit lackadaisical that I'm on the radio reaching millions of people.
[01:38:23.167 --> 01:38:26.050]  I don't even get butterflies anymore when I go on national TV.
[01:38:26.050 --> 01:38:26.910]  That's not a good thing.
[01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:32.015]  I'm making myself get butterflies again so to make sure all my synapses are firing accordingly.
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:41.343]  I also want to thank all our sponsors that have made the radio show possible and Ted Anderson, everyone.
[01:38:41.343 --> 01:38:42.264]  But that is coming up.
[01:38:42.264 --> 01:38:47.048]  I also want to play 20 minutes of an hour-long interview, exclusive interview with David Icke.
[01:38:47.048 --> 01:38:53.913]  I want to play some of that here on the radio for the first time here on this radio show coming up later as well.
[01:38:53.913 --> 01:38:55.695]  We'll start doing that this hour.
[01:38:55.695 --> 01:38:59.978]  But right now for the next five minutes I wanted to bring Lisa Pelton on.
[01:38:59.978 --> 01:39:01.559]  She joins us once a month.
[01:39:01.559 --> 01:39:02.200]  Once a month
[01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:10.351]  They have a special, and this is, they've only done this special one other time.
[01:39:10.351 --> 01:39:16.372]  It comes out to 20% off on the special price on their best-selling unit, the Ecola Blue 28.
[01:39:16.372 --> 01:39:18.413]  It's $999.
[01:39:18.413 --> 01:39:21.213]  Other systems that aren't even as good are $2,000, $3,000, $4,000.
[01:39:21.213 --> 01:39:23.914]  It's an atmospheric water generator.
[01:39:23.914 --> 01:39:30.295]  I researched these, chose this unit over a year ago, contacted them myself, and found out some of the owners were fans.
[01:39:31.275 --> 01:39:32.636]  Hi Alex, it's nice to talk to you again.
[01:39:32.636 --> 01:39:35.437]  I want to tell you that I've been listening all week long and no good deed goes unpunished, sir.
[01:40:03.474 --> 01:40:05.735]  That's correct.
[01:40:05.735 --> 01:40:18.320]  The Acola Blue 28 is on special for your people and it's $9.99 plus shipping and tax and that's going to run through Monday of this week.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:21.281]  Tell people about the Acola Blue 28.
[01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:31.125]  The Acola Blue 28 is an atmospheric water generator and what it does is it pulls the humidity out of the air, runs it through a multi-stage filtration process,
[01:40:31.815 --> 01:40:36.131]  And produces up to 7 gallons of crystal pure water a day.
[01:40:38.996 --> 01:40:47.722]  It certainly does, and again, this special is only running until Monday, Monday evening.
[01:40:47.722 --> 01:40:58.089]  Bottled water, leaches, toxic chemicals, estrogen-mimicking chemicals, it's expensive, it's killed people, just Google bottled water kills when bacteria get in it.
[01:40:58.089 --> 01:41:02.252]  Water filtration systems a lot of times don't cut everything out, though there are some good systems.
[01:41:02.252 --> 01:41:06.835]  This is right out of the air, and then it runs through seven filtration systems.
[01:41:06.835 --> 01:41:08.616]  When I say a cola blue water, it's like,
[01:41:09.176 --> 01:41:11.337]  It's unlike any water you've ever had.
[01:41:11.337 --> 01:41:15.218]  You've got to drink it to understand it.
[01:41:15.218 --> 01:41:16.118]  That's right Alex.
[01:41:16.118 --> 01:41:26.700]  And you know what we have to really look at is the problem today is bottled water has become a food phenomenon.
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:27.581]  It's ridiculous.
[01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:36.743]  First they're putting in bad tap water with pharmaceuticals and fluorides into plastic bottles that are leaching estrogen-like chemicals.
[01:41:37.332 --> 01:41:45.878]  Yeah, all they do is put it through light filtering to take out the dead bacteria chemical taste, but it still has a lot of the bad stuff in it.
[01:41:45.878 --> 01:41:51.042]  That's right, and so that's why we're trying to encourage everyone to get an Ecolo Blue 28.
[01:41:51.042 --> 01:41:55.385]  Get their family and themselves off the grid.
[01:41:55.385 --> 01:41:58.127]  Be smarter than the grid, because the grid is vulnerable.
[01:41:59.008 --> 01:42:13.344]  Well, with the Acola Blue 28, there's no need to worry about water supply shortages or interruptions, no need to stockpile water even in the face of water shortages or drought, no need to buy bottled water and drag it home yet still not be sure of its purity and effects.
[01:42:14.325 --> 01:42:15.506]  of the BPA plastic.
[01:42:15.506 --> 01:42:21.310]  No need to worry about fluorides, pharmaceuticals, and other contaminants like herbicides, pesticides, trihalomethanes.
[01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:25.072]  Ecolablue provides you with a maximum water independence.
[01:42:25.072 --> 01:42:27.513]  Ladies and gentlemen, give them a call today.
[01:42:27.513 --> 01:42:30.755]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to take advantage of that 20% off.
[01:42:30.755 --> 01:42:32.156]  It's Ecolablue.com.
[01:42:32.156 --> 01:42:34.818]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[01:42:34.818 --> 01:42:35.719]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:42:36.599 --> 01:42:41.641]  Big banners up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:42:41.641 --> 01:42:43.202]  Again, AkolaBlue.com or 1-800-691-6043.
[01:42:43.202 --> 01:42:43.422]  800-691-6043.
[01:42:43.422 --> 01:42:54.866]  And again, this special, Lisa, runs through Monday evening?
[01:42:54.866 --> 01:42:57.627]  Monday at midnight.
[01:42:57.627 --> 01:43:02.189]  So Monday at midnight and the folks will be there at Akola Blue to answer your phones.
[01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:06.131]  Anything else that the listeners need to know about with the Akola Blue?
[01:43:07.639 --> 01:43:14.483]  Well, again, I can't stress it enough that it totally gets you off the grid.
[01:43:14.483 --> 01:43:17.005]  So it's one less thing that you have to worry about.
[01:43:17.005 --> 01:43:22.248]  Pure water, good for your health, good for your family.
[01:43:22.248 --> 01:43:23.488]  Let me give people that number again.
[01:43:23.488 --> 01:43:24.209]  800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, or acolablue.com.
[01:43:24.209 --> 01:43:25.610]  Lisa, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:43:25.610 --> 01:43:25.930]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:43:34.312 --> 01:43:37.113]  There goes Lisa Pelton of AkolaBlue.com.
[01:43:37.113 --> 01:43:37.373]  800-691-6043.
[01:43:37.373 --> 01:43:41.575]  And you've got, what, three, four days?
[01:43:41.575 --> 01:43:43.895]  Let me see, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[01:43:43.895 --> 01:43:48.197]  You've got about four and a half days to take advantage of this for people listening to the rebroadcast.
[01:43:48.197 --> 01:43:53.279]  Okay, here is the deal.
[01:43:53.279 --> 01:43:57.040]  I'm going to go out to break with the first part of this David Icke interview.
[01:43:58.257 --> 01:44:05.163]  And then later at the end of the show, I'm, or at the beginning of the fourth hour, I'm going to play part two.
[01:44:05.163 --> 01:44:07.845]  Just in this 15 minutes or so, it's an hour long interview.
[01:44:07.845 --> 01:44:09.326]  I'm there about 15 minutes.
[01:44:09.326 --> 01:44:13.530]  There is just so much David Icke talks about and love him or hate him.
[01:44:13.530 --> 01:44:17.533]  This guy's been right about a lot of stuff in the past and everything he's covering here, I know is a fact.
[01:44:18.467 --> 01:44:22.069]  And we've got the entire interview up there at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[01:44:22.069 --> 01:44:30.815]  And don't forget, running through Christmas, five months free right now, we do this special every year, five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:30.815 --> 01:44:34.578]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all my films, so much more.
[01:44:37.265 --> 01:44:44.048]  At PrisonPlanet.tv and you can download my films, burn them to disk on DivX, that plays on most new DVD players.
[01:44:44.048 --> 01:44:46.529]  It's just an amazing arsenal in the info war.
[01:44:46.529 --> 01:44:48.210]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:48.210 --> 01:44:53.933]  And from PrisonPlanet.tv, here is the audio of the video with David Icke.
[01:45:00.433 --> 01:45:02.473]  I'm David Icker from England.
[01:45:02.473 --> 01:45:26.658]  I went through an extraordinary series of what you might call paranormal experiences, not that they were, 20 years ago in 1990 and 89 and basically the veil lifted and I saw the world in a completely different way and I started on a journey of research which has led me over 20 years to a very
[01:45:29.804 --> 01:45:45.548]  It's an obvious conclusion that this world is controlled by very, very few people, behind the people we think are in power, and they have a very, very malevolent agenda for humanity as a whole, who to them are nothing more than cattle.
[01:45:46.696 --> 01:45:50.901]  It doesn't take many brain cells on active duty to realise that we are at a fork in the road.
[01:45:50.901 --> 01:45:55.326]  We can no longer stand there, staring at the map, thinking, which way do I go?
[01:45:55.326 --> 01:46:05.138]  Because we're facing, in the next few years, enormous challenges, which we can cope with and we'll come through, and this control system's coming down, but ain't coming down tomorrow.
[01:46:05.658 --> 01:46:17.162]  When I started talking about this information 20 years ago, you could hardly get anyone to look at it, and in terms of public events, I couldn't fill a phone booth.
[01:46:17.162 --> 01:46:25.245]  But over the last 20 years, there's been demonstrably, blatantly, obviously, a fantastic awakening, and it's getting faster and faster all the time.
[01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:33.268]  I first of all noticed a big change after 9-11, although the vast majority of people
[01:46:34.028 --> 01:47:03.380]  uh... bought the official line there was something about it that started to get others to think and come off the fence and when the weapons of mass destruction were not found in iraq it was almost like a a confirmation you know people talk about we must never believe what the government says you must never believe what the media says but so many people just go ahead and do that and the lack of weapons of mass destruction in iraq were like
[01:47:05.148 --> 01:47:10.313]  Like somebody reminding you, see, look, governments lie!
[01:47:10.313 --> 01:47:19.943]  And after 2003 and all that, this awakening, this questioning of the world, this questioning of authority, got more and more blatant.
[01:47:19.943 --> 01:47:20.744]  And as the
[01:47:21.505 --> 01:47:26.769]  The police state and the Orwellian state is breaking the surface ever more obviously.
[01:47:26.769 --> 01:47:45.782]  It's getting more and more people to see the world in a way that they wouldn't have done before and it's getting faster and faster and it's a great time to be doing what we're doing, putting this information out and it's very very encouraging.
[01:47:45.782 --> 01:47:46.263]  The whole
[01:47:47.659 --> 01:47:57.766]  Conspiracy is founded on keeping humanity in a very, very low level of perception.
[01:47:57.766 --> 01:48:01.788]  Perception about self, perception about the world.
[01:48:01.788 --> 01:48:10.374]  This is why we have the dumbing down of education, this is why we have the controlled so-called information that comes through the media.
[01:48:11.154 --> 01:48:17.997]  The idea is to keep people in ignorance of anything that would be a problem to the control system.
[01:48:17.997 --> 01:48:26.241]  So we kept in ignorance about the nature of reality itself, the nature of life itself, who we are, where we are, what we're doing here.
[01:48:26.241 --> 01:48:27.822]  We're kept in ignorance of the
[01:48:28.905 --> 01:48:50.453]  The true forces that are manipulating behind the people we see in the public arena like we had eight years of Bush who was blatantly just a figurehead signing his name on the legislation and he's been replaced by Obama who is another blatant figurehead doing the same, controlled by the same force ultimately that controlled Bush.
[01:48:50.453 --> 01:48:52.474]  Now all these connections have to be
[01:48:53.624 --> 01:49:03.470]  Kept from people so that we behave and perceive the world and everything in the way that suits the control system so any awakening
[01:49:04.446 --> 01:49:16.849]  Any opening of the mind to see things that people didn't see before is a real big problem for the conspiracy, for the manipulators.
[01:49:16.849 --> 01:49:28.191]  And what we're seeing now, as more and more people are awakening, is almost a panic-stricken attempt to put the lid on this, to dumb people down.
[01:49:28.191 --> 01:49:29.812]  And this is one reason why
[01:49:30.922 --> 01:49:53.670]  We're seeing the ever greater drugging of American children, not just American children, but in the wider world too, while we're seeing more and more of these chemical cocktails in food that destabilize the body's chemical balance, and more and more electromagnetic pollution to destabilize the
[01:49:54.230 --> 01:50:12.141]  the body's uh... electrical electromagnetic balance all of these things fundamentally affect the way people see the world and their ability to think sharply, to think straight and to see uh... the peripheral vision which you need to see what's actually going on.
[01:50:12.141 --> 01:50:21.166]  They want us here and what an awakening mind does is start to do this and when you do that you start to connect dots that you can't actually see here.
[01:50:21.166 --> 01:50:23.368]  What we're looking at now is
[01:50:24.764 --> 01:50:40.860]  An irresistible force, I would suggest, which is the gathering awaking of humanity, coming face to face with what thinks it's the immovable object, the conspiracy, but isn't, as we'll see, although it's going to take some years before that becomes obvious.
[01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:42.822]  And so we're at this fork in the road.
[01:50:43.783 --> 01:50:45.264]  Stop right there at the fork in the road.
[01:50:45.264 --> 01:50:47.165]  I'm going to come back and play five more minutes of this.
[01:50:47.165 --> 01:50:51.869]  Then I'm going to break down the Rush Limbaugh situation when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:51.869 --> 01:50:55.331]  We're live on the radio, but this also becomes a television show.
[01:50:55.331 --> 01:51:00.195]  Not just a webcam, but a fully produced television show for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:51:02.745 --> 01:51:04.046]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:04.046 --> 01:51:09.650]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:09.650 --> 01:51:14.673]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:14.673 --> 01:51:19.697]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:20.237 --> 01:51:25.462]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:25.462 --> 01:51:32.568]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:32.568 --> 01:51:33.689]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:33.689 --> 01:51:40.054]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:40.374 --> 01:51:43.555]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:43.555 --> 01:51:45.775]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:45.775 --> 01:51:46.716]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:46.716 --> 01:51:46.916]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:46.916 --> 01:51:50.356]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:50.356 --> 01:51:52.097]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:05.104]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:52:05.104 --> 01:52:08.345]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:52:08.345 --> 01:52:12.767]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:52:12.767 --> 01:52:22.010]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:24.231]  Rely instead on OxySilver.
[01:52:24.231 --> 01:52:29.633]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[01:52:29.933 --> 01:52:35.376]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[01:52:35.376 --> 01:52:40.359]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[01:52:40.359 --> 01:52:43.460]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:48.403]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[01:52:48.983 --> 01:52:52.247]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.

[01:52:59.914 --> 01:53:01.276]  This call could save your life.

[01:54:12.472 --> 01:54:16.133]  And so we're at this fork in the road where people have to choose.
[01:54:16.133 --> 01:54:26.515]  Are they going to go on being controlled sheep and robots of the control system or are they going to wake up and take the road to freedom?
[01:54:26.515 --> 01:54:32.396]  That's the fork in the road and that's the choice that people are facing now and will face ever more blatantly in the next few years.
[01:54:33.735 --> 01:54:43.699]  When you look at the bloodline families and the control system that they oversee, it seems that they are all powerful.
[01:54:43.699 --> 01:54:47.421]  They control the media ownership level and the key positions within it.
[01:54:47.421 --> 01:54:52.583]  They control the corporations, the cartels of oil, of pharmaceuticals, etc.
[01:54:52.583 --> 01:54:59.106]  They control the forces of law enforcement and the military, ultimately.
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:03.303]  But one thing they don't control is the numbers.
[01:55:03.303 --> 01:55:04.764]  This is what humanity has.
[01:55:04.764 --> 01:55:15.453]  It has vast numbers of people, enormous numbers of people, compared with those at the core of the control system that actually know exactly what they're doing, what the agenda is.
[01:55:15.453 --> 01:55:21.278]  They are tiny in number compared with what is now supposed to be seven billion people on the planet.
[01:55:21.278 --> 01:55:26.543]  So one of the agendas to bring this under
[01:55:28.789 --> 01:55:29.029]  Great.
[01:55:41.984 --> 01:55:43.786]  Remove lots of people.
[01:55:43.786 --> 01:55:49.991]  You can do it by injecting stuff into people's arms and they just keel over dead.
[01:55:49.991 --> 01:55:59.899]  But if you do that, and of course there is some of that that goes on, but if you do that, all the other people lined up are going to say, excuse me, I ain't having whatever they've had.
[01:55:59.899 --> 01:56:09.446]  So you do it in a more subtle way and you target the defense mechanism that everyone has called the immune system.
[01:56:09.446 --> 01:56:10.007]  For instance,
[01:56:11.431 --> 01:56:13.252]  People don't die of AIDS.
[01:56:13.252 --> 01:56:23.316]  They die of AIDS-related disease, which are diseases that the immune system, before it becomes shot, would have defended the body from.
[01:56:23.316 --> 01:56:37.061]  So all the time now, we're having the immune system targeted, not least among children and young people, by vaccinations, by food additives and drink additives, etc.
[01:56:39.002 --> 01:56:48.589]  If we just think about this, I mean, it's so blatant, if people just take a deep breath and take a step back and look at it with a bit of peripheral vision.
[01:56:48.589 --> 01:57:05.862]  We have a situation now, not just in America, but in Britain and the wider world, where between birth and about two years of age, we're having children be given
[01:57:08.118 --> 01:57:30.658]  25 and rising different vaccinations and combinations of them poured in all this these chemical cocktails that destabilize the body but more important than that they have to be dealt with by a still developing immune system
[01:57:31.658 --> 01:57:46.641]  So the immune system's still developing, it's still coming up to optimum efficiency, and suddenly this tidal wave of chemical concoctions is thrown at it and has to deal with it.
[01:57:46.641 --> 01:57:50.042]  As it's dealing with one, suddenly another one comes.
[01:57:50.042 --> 01:57:53.182]  25 vaccinations over the first two years of life.
[01:57:53.182 --> 01:57:55.443]  It is, by any level of
[01:57:56.505 --> 01:57:57.945]  Common sense!
[01:57:57.945 --> 01:58:12.890]  It's ludicrous, and it's meant to be ludicrous, because it's targeting the immune systems of young children, which, because it's done at a developing time in the immune system, rewires it, destabilizes it, imbalances it for the rest of their lives.
[01:58:12.890 --> 01:58:18.892]  Those kids' immune system will never be as efficient as it would have been otherwise.
[01:58:18.892 --> 01:58:22.733]  My son, he's now 16, he's never had a vaccination.
[01:58:23.672 --> 01:58:28.795]  He's six foot five, incredibly healthy, never had a childhood disease.
[01:58:28.795 --> 01:58:31.176]  And his mates at school had childhood diseases.
[01:58:31.176 --> 01:58:33.878]  They had the whole bloody lot.
[01:58:33.878 --> 01:58:35.779]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:35.779 --> 01:58:37.199]  We've reached the halfway point.
[01:58:37.199 --> 01:58:39.461]  Hour number three and four straight ahead.
[01:58:39.461 --> 01:58:41.142]  Simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:59:57.634 --> 02:00:00.376]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:07.048 --> 02:00:08.349]  Big Brother.
[02:00:08.349 --> 02:00:10.109]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:10.109 --> 02:00:11.870]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:13.451]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.451 --> 02:00:14.351]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.351 --> 02:00:19.213]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:19.213 --> 02:00:23.255]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.189 --> 02:00:36.317]  We are simulcasting the second half of the syndicated radio transmission, as we do every day, live at PrisonPlanet.tv, here from our radio slash TV studios.
[02:00:36.317 --> 02:00:38.359]  And yes, for viewers, you saw that right.
[02:00:38.359 --> 02:00:41.982]  For radio listeners, you go to RushLimbaugh.com, of all places.
[02:00:41.982 --> 02:00:46.526]  Top story on RushLimbaugh.com, Prison Planet.
[02:00:46.526 --> 02:00:51.229]  With hurricanes at 30-year low, Gore turns to Photoshop.
[02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:53.952]  And when you click on it, which we'll do live on air,
[02:00:55.472 --> 02:01:02.479]  When you click on it, it takes you to an article written by Paul Joseph Watson today.
[02:01:02.479 --> 02:01:07.384]  Now, Limbaugh has talked about us quite a few times, generally in a negative light.
[02:01:07.384 --> 02:01:11.088]  We were criticizing George W. Bush as a Newell Order puppet.
[02:01:11.088 --> 02:01:14.111]  And he's criticized us for believing there's a world government being set up.
[02:01:14.111 --> 02:01:15.372]  But Limbaugh's got a problem.
[02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:28.052]  Now the New York Times, the Associated Press, Financial Times, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, they're all announcing a private world government is being set up and they're going to fund the world government with carbon taxes.
[02:01:29.110 --> 02:01:32.874]  Well, Limbaugh is right in that he's against carbon taxes.
[02:01:32.874 --> 02:01:34.756]  And so, thank you, Rush Limbaugh.
[02:01:34.756 --> 02:01:36.798]  Thank you for linking to the article.
[02:01:36.798 --> 02:01:45.927]  It's a very strange feeling to start getting calls at about noon today from listeners that happen to hear Rush Limbaugh for large parts of the first hour of his show.
[02:01:45.927 --> 02:01:49.911]  Read the article by Paul Joseph Watson from PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:51.212 --> 02:01:53.734]  And that article, of course, is up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:53.734 --> 02:02:02.159]  With hurricanes at 30-year low, Gore turns to Photoshop, Photoshopping in photographs of more hurricanes.
[02:02:02.159 --> 02:02:05.842]  And in fact, click on the article from PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:02:05.842 --> 02:02:10.845]  We can scroll down and show people the Photoshopped photos.
[02:02:10.845 --> 02:02:19.191]  And Gore, of course, used fake graphs showing that after carbon dioxide is released in higher levels, that then the Earth warms.
[02:02:19.191 --> 02:02:20.692]  He actually flipped the graphs.
[02:02:21.472 --> 02:02:33.283]  When the official graphs came out in the months after his film The Inconvenient Truth, it was pointed out that they had doctored the graphs.
[02:02:33.283 --> 02:02:37.487]  All the major universities, all the major governments, it was a fraud.
[02:02:37.487 --> 02:02:38.508]  When the earth gets warmer,
[02:02:39.497 --> 02:02:42.720]  It releases more carbon dioxide out of the ocean, out of the ice pack.
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:47.865]  There's more life, more plant life, more plankton, more photoplankton.
[02:02:47.865 --> 02:02:53.631]  They release more oxygen, more carbon dioxide that are the two life-giving gases.
[02:02:53.631 --> 02:02:56.474]  Plants operate off carbon dioxide.
[02:02:56.474 --> 02:02:57.194]  It's not a poison.
[02:02:58.134 --> 02:02:59.335]  Barack Obama and the U.N.
[02:02:59.335 --> 02:03:00.776]  have said that's a lie.
[02:03:00.776 --> 02:03:02.077]  Believe me, plants do breathe it.
[02:03:02.077 --> 02:03:03.018]  Plants do exist.
[02:03:03.018 --> 02:03:04.919]  Not a conspiracy theory.
[02:03:04.919 --> 02:03:24.215]  And Ban Ki-moon exists, the Secretary General of the U.N., calling for world government, two weeks ago in the New York Times, in an editorial published in papers all over the country and all over the world, but in the New York Times mainly, biggest paper in the world, and saying the carbon tax will fund the world government.
[02:03:24.215 --> 02:03:26.657]  The carbon tax will fund the world government.
[02:03:28.675 --> 02:03:33.297]  So Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and many others are now being forced.
[02:03:33.297 --> 02:03:34.478]  Hannity still won't do it.
[02:03:34.478 --> 02:03:35.499]  He says none of it exists.
[02:03:35.499 --> 02:03:38.580]  He says he wants to have microchips put in all children.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:41.802]  I had that clip in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:03:41.802 --> 02:03:44.043]  He says all militias should be arrested.
[02:03:44.043 --> 02:03:47.305]  I mean, Hannity is really a piece of work.
[02:03:47.305 --> 02:03:54.609]  And he's really discrediting himself, not covering the real issues, and still running around denying that all of this is happening.
[02:03:54.609 --> 02:03:56.630]  But very, very strange.
[02:03:57.571 --> 02:04:03.174]  To have Rush Limbaugh linked to, as his top story, and punch that back up for people.
[02:04:03.174 --> 02:04:13.298]  His top story, and his top story on the radio today to 20 plus million listeners, was Prison Planet.
[02:04:13.298 --> 02:04:17.200]  With hurricanes at 30 year low, Gore turns to Photoshop.
[02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:23.675]  So no doubt that our stories go viral every day, but this will go mega viral.
[02:04:23.675 --> 02:04:29.740]  Not only is it on his highly rated website, but it's on his number one rated radio show.
[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:31.302]  I don't think we're out of the woods yet, though.
[02:04:31.302 --> 02:04:44.034]  I know we're not, because Senator Inhofe is declaring victory, saying that there has been a defeat of the climate bill crowd when it's about to go to the full Senate.
[02:04:45.279 --> 02:04:51.689]  And it doesn't matter because the states, like California, are implementing the carbon taxes regardless.
[02:04:51.689 --> 02:04:56.596]  And the bureaucracies federally are implementing them regardless of whether Congress passes it or not.
[02:04:56.596 --> 02:05:00.062]  We'll be right back after this quick break, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:02.188 --> 02:05:07.495]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:05:07.495 --> 02:05:12.021]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:05:12.021 --> 02:05:14.284]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:05:14.284 --> 02:05:15.926]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:05:15.926 --> 02:05:16.948]  There is a solution.
[02:05:17.188 --> 02:05:25.617]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:05:25.617 --> 02:05:33.065]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:05:33.065 --> 02:05:38.731]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:05:39.091 --> 02:05:45.113]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:05:45.113 --> 02:05:49.255]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[02:06:02.045 --> 02:06:11.190]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[02:06:11.190 --> 02:06:14.572]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[02:06:14.572 --> 02:06:20.435]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[02:06:20.435 --> 02:06:25.218]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[02:06:25.218 --> 02:06:27.559]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[02:06:27.739 --> 02:06:28.159]  Thank you.
[02:06:46.650 --> 02:06:50.371]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[02:06:50.371 --> 02:06:52.572]  That's O-X-Y Silver dot net.
[02:06:52.572 --> 02:06:59.094]  Or call about OxySilver, ZeoLife, and GI Flora Pro toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:06:59.094 --> 02:07:01.275]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:07:01.275 --> 02:07:01.875]  Do it now.
[02:07:01.875 --> 02:07:05.277]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:07:05.277 --> 02:07:08.898]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:07:08.898 --> 02:07:13.459]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:07:13.459 --> 02:07:14.900]  These emergency backup systems
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:18.022]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:07:18.022 --> 02:07:24.127]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:07:24.127 --> 02:07:27.749]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:07:27.749 --> 02:07:32.573]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:07:32.573 --> 02:07:39.137]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:07:39.137 --> 02:07:41.079]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:07:41.559 --> 02:07:44.763]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:07:44.763 --> 02:07:49.268]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:07:49.268 --> 02:07:51.491]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:07:51.491 --> 02:07:51.791]  877-327-0365.
[02:07:51.791 --> 02:07:52.492]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:08:04.051 --> 02:08:10.675]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:10.675 --> 02:08:14.217]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.217 --> 02:08:19.940]  Well, he wrote the definitive, unauthorized biography on George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:30.567]  He's a doctorate of history, a doctorate in economics, and he's also a best-selling author of several books on Barack H. Obama.
[02:08:32.085 --> 02:08:48.779]  And I was, Tarpley heard me talking about Rush Limbaugh's top story on the radio, top story at RushLimbaugh.com, being the PrisonPlanet.com article, why hurricanes, with hurricanes at 30 year low, Gore turns to Photoshop.
[02:08:48.779 --> 02:08:53.662]  The king of cap and trade simply airbrushes them into his new book to create a more scary earth.
[02:08:55.336 --> 02:08:57.719]  Tarpley, to give you an idea of how big Limbaugh is.
[02:08:57.719 --> 02:08:59.101]  Tarpley was listening to Limbaugh.
[02:08:59.101 --> 02:09:00.402]  He heard some of it today.
[02:09:00.402 --> 02:09:03.566]  Reportedly, this went on for a long time.
[02:09:03.566 --> 02:09:06.190]  So he can tell us about that, and it's an interesting history lesson.
[02:09:07.662 --> 02:09:09.043]  In why Limbaugh's doing this.
[02:09:09.043 --> 02:09:11.344]  I asked Tarpley why he thought Limbaugh was doing it.
[02:09:11.344 --> 02:09:18.689]  It concurred exactly with what I was about to tell Tarpley, but I wanted to see what he thought about political coloration.
[02:09:18.689 --> 02:09:28.155]  Kind of like a hermit crab will pick up some, you know, different types of coral and actually plant it on its shell as camouflage.
[02:09:28.155 --> 02:09:32.538]  Then we're going to get into the dollar, the crash that Tarpley's been predicting for over a decade.
[02:09:33.078 --> 02:09:37.822]  By the way, we sell his book about the coming cataclysm that's excellent, definitive.
[02:09:37.822 --> 02:09:43.867]  Then we're going to get into the latest geopolitical warmongering going on with us today.
[02:09:43.867 --> 02:09:49.351]  Then Alan Combs coming up for a little bit of a discussion and lively debate next hour.
[02:09:49.351 --> 02:09:51.393]  So stay with us today.
[02:09:51.393 --> 02:09:52.594]  Webster, you've got the floor.
[02:09:52.594 --> 02:09:55.076]  Let's get into the Limbaugh situation first.
[02:09:56.041 --> 02:10:08.110]  Well, Rush Limbaugh is an, I would call him an agent of the Mount Pelerin Society, and specifically of one of the attendees of the Mount Pelerin Society, and that was William F. Buckley Jr., the right-wing
[02:10:08.906 --> 02:10:09.726]  C.I.A.
[02:10:09.726 --> 02:10:25.454]  And if you remember when William F. Buckley, the National Review guy, died, Limbaugh was in mourning for several weeks, and he went into great detail about how Mr. Buckley made me what I am today, and he introduced me to Henry Kissinger, and he made me great, and so forth.
[02:10:25.454 --> 02:10:29.356]  So this is obviously a very dubious character.
[02:10:29.916 --> 02:10:44.484]  Now, the problem that Limbaugh faces, if you've had the recent Tea Party march on September 12th, and then the slightly smaller one that took place recently, Limbaugh is concerned to keep that within the Republican Party.
[02:10:44.984 --> 02:10:45.425]  So is Hannity!
[02:11:06.505 --> 02:11:10.028]  Hannity's saying the same thing every day on his TV show.
[02:11:10.028 --> 02:11:11.770]  Stay with the Republicans!
[02:11:11.770 --> 02:11:15.893]  So now they have to act like they're us to try to keep their people.
[02:11:15.893 --> 02:11:18.575]  Yes, they've got to radicalize themselves.
[02:11:18.575 --> 02:11:23.860]  And of course, in order to have a more radical and a more coherent analysis, where better to go than to you?
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:25.441]  And therefore they bring this up.
[02:11:25.441 --> 02:11:33.688]  So he's essentially tacking a little bit in a radical, anti-establishment, anti-globalist direction to get some street creds.
[02:11:34.028 --> 02:11:38.529]  Because otherwise, a lot of these Tea Party people listen to them and they say, what?
[02:11:38.529 --> 02:11:40.890]  You're for free trade?
[02:11:40.890 --> 02:11:42.250]  You're a warmonger?
[02:11:42.250 --> 02:11:44.271]  You're supporting the Republicans?
[02:11:44.271 --> 02:11:46.011]  You were a lapdog for Bush?
[02:11:46.011 --> 02:11:49.012]  You discovered deficits with Obama?
[02:11:49.012 --> 02:11:55.853]  But back in the day of Bush, it was Cheney telling us that deficits don't matter, that Reagan had proved that deficits don't matter.
[02:11:55.853 --> 02:11:57.234]  So I think it's that.
[02:11:57.234 --> 02:12:02.855]  It's a purely opportunistic, demagogic thing, but it's also a tribute to the fact that your influence is growing.
[02:12:05.578 --> 02:12:09.720]  Webster, the dollar is plunging as you predicted.
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:12.682]  I was eating when you were talking.
[02:12:12.682 --> 02:12:14.963]  I'm here on TV with a mouthful of food.
[02:12:14.963 --> 02:12:18.405]  Take me off there, guys.
[02:12:18.405 --> 02:12:24.168]  Webster, you were predicting this a very long time ago.
[02:12:24.168 --> 02:12:26.209]  Now the dollar has plunged to record lows.
[02:12:26.209 --> 02:12:28.110]  Gold is exploding and soaring.
[02:12:29.246 --> 02:12:31.707]  To new highs.
[02:12:31.707 --> 02:12:40.871]  Will you explain to people what's happening and what this is going to do to them if we don't reverse the tide and take control of this political system?
[02:12:40.871 --> 02:12:42.792]  Well, we just had Secretary Geithner.
[02:12:42.792 --> 02:12:45.473]  Tiny Tim was testifying in the Congress today.
[02:12:45.473 --> 02:12:52.236]  And what, of course, he has done, along with Summers and Volcker and Bernanke, is that they have kept the U.S.
[02:12:52.236 --> 02:12:53.697]  interest rates at zero.
[02:12:53.697 --> 02:12:56.318]  You can borrow if you're a bank, not a person like us.
[02:12:56.818 --> 02:13:00.422]  But if you're a bank, you can borrow at 0% from the Federal Reserve.
[02:13:00.422 --> 02:13:03.826]  And what they've done with that is create something called the dollar carry trade.
[02:13:03.826 --> 02:13:14.077]  You borrow at 0% from the Fed, and then you take that to some extremely risky speculative market, be it in Poland or Ukraine or Turkey or
[02:13:15.118 --> 02:13:21.103]  Indonesia, wherever it is, whatever emerging market is the hottest, you take it there and you speculate like mad.
[02:13:21.103 --> 02:13:29.109]  But every time you do that, that puts a downward pressure on the dollar, because somebody's borrowing dollars and then selling them to get this other currency.
[02:13:29.109 --> 02:13:31.511]  So the dollar goes down, down, down.
[02:13:31.511 --> 02:13:33.653]  Now, there are other factors working, right?
[02:13:33.653 --> 02:13:41.960]  The fact that they've put out this $24 trillion bailout from the Treasury, the Fed, and the FDIC, that's also playing a role.
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:45.023]  We've now reached a very dangerous point.
[02:13:45.023 --> 02:13:46.985]  There are two things that could happen.
[02:13:46.985 --> 02:13:49.908]  One would be a dollar panic out there in the world.
[02:13:49.908 --> 02:14:00.679]  That is, coming out of Kuala Lumpur or someplace in Africa or someplace in Latin America, somebody decides that they're a little bit heavy on dollars and they want to lighten up.
[02:14:01.099 --> 02:14:09.283]  And that leads to some kind of a panic, or a military event could lead to a panic, or if Obama catches the flu, that could lead to a panic.
[02:14:09.283 --> 02:14:12.964]  It has done so in the not-so-distant past.
[02:14:12.964 --> 02:14:13.745]  But that's one way.
[02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:15.866]  You could get a kind of panic coming out of the world.
[02:14:15.866 --> 02:14:16.486]  The other thing is,
[02:14:17.106 --> 02:14:18.587]  There are Treasury auctions.
[02:14:18.587 --> 02:14:25.193]  Next week, there's going to be $118 billion of five- and seven-year Treasury paper put on the market.
[02:14:25.193 --> 02:14:33.459]  Now, what happens if people don't buy those, if there are not bids enough for all of it, or above all, if the interest rate jumps way up?
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:36.161]  And that turned out to be a disaster.
[02:14:36.161 --> 02:14:37.342]  Now, that's not hypothetical.
[02:14:37.342 --> 02:14:40.124]  That happened to the British back in March of this year.
[02:14:40.124 --> 02:14:41.825]  The British had a gilt auction.
[02:14:41.825 --> 02:14:42.866]  G-I-L-T, right?
[02:14:42.866 --> 02:14:44.427]  The British Treasury paper.
[02:14:44.427 --> 02:14:46.088]  And they couldn't sell all of it.
[02:14:46.088 --> 02:14:49.530]  And people said at that point, well, does this mean that Great Britain is bankrupt?
[02:14:49.530 --> 02:14:55.675]  So, the obvious way to get out of this would be to raise the interest rates, which Bernanke could do.
[02:14:55.675 --> 02:15:00.318]  But, if he raises the interest rates to attract pot money back into the dollar,
[02:15:00.706 --> 02:15:11.915]  In fact, he was under pressure, as you know, at a conference on Monday, and in a speech he said, look, I'm not worried about the dollar dropping, I'm worried about interest rates, and I'm going to keep them low.
[02:15:11.915 --> 02:15:15.958]  They're doing that so they can continue the speculative carry trade, aren't they?
[02:15:16.278 --> 02:15:19.740]  Yes, but of course he does have to worry about the dollar, and he really does, right?
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:22.622]  He's talking through his hat, as these characters always do.
[02:15:22.622 --> 02:15:34.208]  They're very concerned about the dollar, and they know that if the dollar keeps going, we might get into one of these irreversible mudslides, where it just starts going down, and there's nothing they can do to get out of it.
[02:15:34.208 --> 02:15:38.030]  In other words, a worldwide dollar panic, and that would lead them to hyperinflation.
[02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:40.592]  Yeah, tell people, boil it down in layman's terms.
[02:15:41.923 --> 02:15:43.444]  We know the leadership we have.
[02:15:43.444 --> 02:15:45.845]  We know they're not going to listen to your solutions.
[02:15:45.845 --> 02:15:48.407]  So what is going to unfold, Webster?
[02:15:48.407 --> 02:15:56.311]  Well, in terms of the hyperinflation, if the dollar goes down 20 or 30 percent, then remember, everything in this country is imported.
[02:15:56.311 --> 02:16:01.434]  This is a de-industrialized rubble field of a post-industrial society that we have here.
[02:16:01.434 --> 02:16:02.615]  So everything is imported.
[02:16:03.155 --> 02:16:06.797]  And if the dollar goes down, that means the prices on all those imports go up.
[02:16:06.797 --> 02:16:10.158]  So that gets you into the realm of hyperinflation.
[02:16:10.158 --> 02:16:12.759]  Now, here's what I think they're going to try to do.
[02:16:12.759 --> 02:16:25.124]  The one way to get out of that bind, right, in other words, it's either going to be a 0% rate and the dollar goes down, down, down, or raise the interest rates and you collapse the stock market and you get a panic in a different way.
[02:16:25.624 --> 02:16:28.105]  The only way out of that is some kind of outside event.
[02:16:28.105 --> 02:16:37.247]  Now remember, 1973-74, we had a fake oil crisis, which was designed to soak up the dollars in the world and stabilize the dollar.
[02:16:37.247 --> 02:16:40.027]  That was done by Kissinger with the Six-Day War.
[02:16:40.027 --> 02:16:47.589]  Later on in 79, when Brzezinski brought down the Shah and installed Khomeini, we had another oil crisis.
[02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:51.650]  So, 73-74-79, I think that's somehow the model for what might occur.
[02:16:53.471 --> 02:17:01.758]  Wasn't the oil run-up of a year and a half, two years ago, engineered as well to soak up dollars?
[02:17:01.758 --> 02:17:06.562]  Yes, but of course that was the speculative activity of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
[02:17:06.562 --> 02:17:08.343]  In other words, that's the London I.C.E.
[02:17:08.343 --> 02:17:13.347]  exchange, and they're trying to do that again, and the price of oil is indeed creeping up.
[02:17:13.347 --> 02:17:16.710]  Maybe not today, but pretty much continuously.
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:25.567]  The thing now is, Wall Street believes that if some shocking, spectacular event, right?
[02:17:25.567 --> 02:17:34.817]  A false flag, a Gulf of Tonkin, a war in some strategically critical area, or some kind of big scare, many types of things would do.
[02:17:35.569 --> 02:17:51.216]  They think that there's the flight to safe haven, the flight to safety, and they believe still that if the world seems to be descending into chaos, hot money will fly to New York and that would then prop up the dollar in some at least short to medium term way.
[02:17:51.836 --> 02:17:54.758]  And therefore, you have to look at what that might be.
[02:17:54.758 --> 02:18:12.210]  Now, I was on Russia Today yesterday, and they're asking me about this bomb in Peshawar, Pakistan, a couple of weeks ago, where the Taliban, the Pakistani Taliban, are saying that they didn't do this, and that this was done by the U.S., the CIA, and specifically Blackwater.
[02:18:12.210 --> 02:18:18.915]  And we had, a couple of weeks also, we had this Balochistan bomb, where the Iranians said that the CIA did that one, too.
[02:18:19.475 --> 02:18:21.157]  So you look at Pakistan.
[02:18:21.157 --> 02:18:23.460]  Pakistan is now pretty much in a full-scale
[02:18:24.344 --> 02:18:24.984]  Civil War.
[02:18:24.984 --> 02:18:33.427]  The Pakistani Army has been winning in South Waziristan, but I don't know if they're winning everywhere, and generally the level of fighting is increasing.
[02:18:33.427 --> 02:18:38.828]  And you've got to remember that the Taliban in Pakistan are a pure proxy of the U.S.
[02:18:38.828 --> 02:18:44.450]  They're run pretty much by the CIA, or they're directed and used as an asset of the CIA.
[02:18:44.450 --> 02:18:46.791]  So we have a funny situation in Pakistan.
[02:18:46.791 --> 02:18:51.032]  The Chinese are supporting the central government in Islamabad, and the U.S.
[02:18:51.032 --> 02:18:51.592]  is supporting
[02:18:51.992 --> 02:18:56.235]  Any force that wants to wage civil war against the Pakistani government.
[02:18:56.235 --> 02:19:01.958]  Now suppose the Taliban do what these neocons have been talking about for so many years.
[02:19:01.958 --> 02:19:06.600]  They get their hands on some of those Pakistani nukes, whether they can use them or not.
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:11.023]  That might be the kind of great fear, the shock out in the world that would do it.
[02:19:11.023 --> 02:19:14.205]  Another possibility, there's a civil war going on in Yemen.
[02:19:14.685 --> 02:19:20.251]  And in this civil war, the Iranians are on one side and the Saudis are on the other side.
[02:19:20.251 --> 02:19:26.818]  The Iranians are backing a rebel group and the Saudis, I guess, are backing the government of Yemen, whatever that is.
[02:19:26.818 --> 02:19:28.299]  And there have been clashes.
[02:19:28.299 --> 02:19:32.624]  There have been also incidents on the water in the Persian Gulf, Arabian Gulf.
[02:19:33.004 --> 02:19:38.005]  Stay there, and we know Saudi Arabia is a client state of the U.S., England, and Israel.
[02:19:38.005 --> 02:19:43.746]  We'll look at that geopolitical potential and a lot more with Webster Tarpley as we chart the future.
[02:19:43.746 --> 02:19:44.526]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.779 --> 02:20:09.765]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:20:09.765 --> 02:20:11.026]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[02:20:57.140 --> 02:21:04.782]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:04.782 --> 02:21:05.643]  Spy on me?
[02:21:05.643 --> 02:21:05.963]  Yeah.

[02:21:11.005 --> 02:21:12.625]  You should use Startpage instead.

[02:22:03.194 --> 02:22:04.235]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:04.235 --> 02:22:09.759]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:09.759 --> 02:22:10.299]  I get it.
[02:22:10.299 --> 02:22:19.927]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:19.927 --> 02:22:21.328]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:21.328 --> 02:22:25.711]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[02:22:25.911 --> 02:22:27.752]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[02:22:27.752 --> 02:22:29.793]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[02:22:29.793 --> 02:22:33.194]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:33.194 --> 02:22:37.456]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:37.456 --> 02:22:39.056]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:39.056 --> 02:22:43.018]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:43.018 --> 02:22:46.840]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:47.740]  You should, too.
[02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:48.900]  Find out what they know.

[02:22:55.344 --> 02:22:55.524]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:03.226 --> 02:23:07.847]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[02:24:17.049 --> 02:24:19.370]  Webster Tarpley with us in this segment and the next.
[02:24:19.370 --> 02:24:24.553]  Then I'm going to play a whole bunch of audio clips from listeners from the new comment line 512-646-4444.
[02:24:28.112 --> 02:24:28.172]  I'm
[02:24:44.025 --> 02:24:46.487]  Saudi Arabia has been funding the U.S.
[02:24:46.487 --> 02:24:47.467]  and asking the U.S.
[02:24:47.467 --> 02:24:50.009]  for a long time to attack Iran.
[02:24:50.009 --> 02:24:52.391]  Why is Saudi Arabia after Iran?
[02:24:52.391 --> 02:24:57.974]  Just because they want to be the dominant force in the region and Saudi Arabia wants to be the dominant force?
[02:24:57.974 --> 02:25:00.256]  Why is there this longstanding?
[02:25:00.256 --> 02:25:12.664]  Is it because one is a separate group of Islam, the majority group based out of Iran, and we've got, based out of Saudi Arabia, and we have the Shiites out of Iran?
[02:25:12.664 --> 02:25:13.805]  I mean, is that why this is happening?
[02:25:14.285 --> 02:25:15.786]  Yes, it's partly religious, right?
[02:25:15.786 --> 02:25:19.967]  It's partly Iranian Shiites versus the Wahhabites of Saudi Arabia.
[02:25:19.967 --> 02:25:24.768]  But remember also, when you had that long Iran-Iraq war, right, that the U.S.
[02:25:24.768 --> 02:25:33.651]  had provoked, there was this thing called the Gulf Cooperation Council, which was Saudi Arabia and all the little Gulf Emirates, which had been British puppet states.
[02:25:34.071 --> 02:25:50.249]  And they were supporting Iraq against Iran, so there's quite a bit of bad blood, and naturally the Saudis feel that Yemen is on their side of the Gulf, right, and therefore they should be the preponderant power, but the Iranians are interested in meddling.
[02:25:51.310 --> 02:25:52.652]  Let me just ask you real quick.
[02:25:52.652 --> 02:25:53.612]  Hold on.
[02:25:53.612 --> 02:25:55.234]  What is the real relationship?
[02:25:55.234 --> 02:26:03.401]  Is Saudi Arabia still a purely puppet state of Anglo-American oil, of the Anglo-American slash Dutch interest?
[02:26:03.401 --> 02:26:08.446]  Or is it now, because you talked about that Russia trip, that there may be some shifting?
[02:26:08.931 --> 02:26:11.834]  Yeah, there's this question of Prince Bandar.
[02:26:11.834 --> 02:26:13.275]  What happened to Prince Bandar?
[02:26:13.275 --> 02:26:14.316]  Where is he?
[02:26:14.316 --> 02:26:15.397]  This is Bandar Bush.
[02:26:15.397 --> 02:26:19.621]  For a long time he was considered to be the chief of the pro-US party.
[02:26:19.621 --> 02:26:24.165]  This is the guy that spent 9-11 afternoon and evening with Bush in the White House.
[02:26:24.685 --> 02:26:35.854]  But we had in August reports that Prince Bandar, now the head of the National Security Council, had attempted a coup d'etat in terms of at least the royal succession that had been placed under house arrest.
[02:26:35.854 --> 02:26:44.521]  And then we went back and looked at what Prince Bandar had been doing lately, and it was meetings with Putin, trips to Russia, cooperation with Russia.
[02:26:44.521 --> 02:26:48.705]  And all of that necessarily means is that Saudi Arabia wants to be balanced.
[02:26:49.225 --> 02:26:58.510]  Not a complete puppet state and client state of the U.S., not locked in the deadly grip of Wall Street, but that they'd like to have other options.
[02:26:58.510 --> 02:27:02.072]  Of course, that's what the Wall Street characters cannot accept.
[02:27:02.072 --> 02:27:07.455]  So I think the internal situation of Saudi Arabia is worth looking at.
[02:27:07.455 --> 02:27:08.356]  Here's the other thing.
[02:27:08.356 --> 02:27:13.239]  The Hajj, right, the great Muslim pilgrimage, is coming now at the end of this month.
[02:27:13.239 --> 02:27:14.499]  It's basically within the next
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:16.280]  We're good to go.
[02:27:32.646 --> 02:27:38.251]  Take control of the Kaaba, right, the central holy site of Islam, and start shooting.
[02:27:38.251 --> 02:27:44.415]  And there was an armed confrontation that went on for the best part of a week or two.
[02:27:44.415 --> 02:27:46.177]  And that's what you've got to think about.
[02:27:46.177 --> 02:28:01.549]  What kind of an event like that, if you had a repetition of that November 1979 attack on Mecca, that I think would tend to shock the world, and people would wonder about the stability of Saudi Arabia and a whole lot of dollars.
[02:28:02.089 --> 02:28:02.970]  We're good to go.
[02:28:24.272 --> 02:28:26.693]  Now, what if that happens to the Saudis?
[02:28:26.693 --> 02:28:40.616]  I think some of the Saudis realize they may be candidates for that, and therefore they may be thinking, let's try to get the Russians in here, or the Chinese, or somebody else, so that we have somebody to turn to if the Obama administration tries to foment a coup in this way.
[02:28:40.616 --> 02:28:43.377]  Now, some of this is speculation, but maybe not so much.
[02:28:43.377 --> 02:28:46.338]  If there was a coup attempt in August, there might be another one soon.
[02:28:48.939 --> 02:28:53.084]  But bottom line, the establishment needs global crises.
[02:28:53.084 --> 02:28:55.568]  They need to stage events.
[02:28:55.568 --> 02:28:58.231]  Could that be staged terror here in the United States?
[02:28:58.231 --> 02:29:00.214]  Could it be staged terror in Europe?
[02:29:00.214 --> 02:29:02.717]  Could it be a new war with Russia, like we saw with 888?
[02:29:02.717 --> 02:29:05.661]  I mean, are there other things you see on the horizon?
[02:29:06.775 --> 02:29:10.356]  The doctrine currently, and this is what Brzezinski says, is the U.S.
[02:29:10.356 --> 02:29:14.418]  cannot, cannot become directly militarily engaged.
[02:29:14.418 --> 02:29:16.378]  So they want to use puppet kamikazes?
[02:29:16.378 --> 02:29:16.798]  It's enough.
[02:29:16.798 --> 02:29:19.899]  You've got to play the other countries one against the other.
[02:29:19.899 --> 02:29:28.482]  That's why this idea of a conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran over Yemen is such an attractive idea for these people.
[02:29:28.482 --> 02:29:32.503]  We've also got to remember Obama is going to escalate the Afghan war very soon.
[02:29:32.503 --> 02:29:33.924]  I want to remind people about that.
[02:29:34.364 --> 02:29:40.828]  Interesting anti-war demonstration in Lafayette Park at the White House, Saturday, December 12th at 11 a.m.
[02:29:40.828 --> 02:29:43.669]  If you're near Washington, stop by and protest that.
[02:29:43.669 --> 02:29:44.890]  All right, stay there, Webster.
[02:29:44.890 --> 02:29:50.373]  I want to come back, finish up with that, get more into the economy with you, and I've got some other important areas.
[02:29:50.373 --> 02:29:53.135]  I want to talk about cap-and-trade with Webster.
[02:29:53.135 --> 02:29:54.516]  We're on the march.
[02:29:54.516 --> 02:29:57.057]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:57.057 --> 02:29:59.739]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.018 --> 02:30:06.020]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:11.345]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:11.345 --> 02:30:13.407]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:13.407 --> 02:30:18.391]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:18.391 --> 02:30:19.592]  How much do you want?
[02:30:19.592 --> 02:30:20.712]  When do you want it?
[02:30:20.712 --> 02:30:22.594]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:22.594 --> 02:30:23.675]  When will you need it?
[02:30:23.675 --> 02:30:25.877]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:25.877 --> 02:30:27.218]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:28.739]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:28.739 --> 02:30:29.800]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:31.261]  And you can't feed yourself?
[02:30:31.261 --> 02:30:33.982]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:33.982 --> 02:30:37.585]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:37.585 --> 02:30:41.387]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:41.387 --> 02:30:42.628]  How much will you need?
[02:30:42.628 --> 02:30:43.528]  We don't know.
[02:30:43.528 --> 02:30:44.629]  How much do you want?
[02:30:44.629 --> 02:30:45.569]  All you can get.
[02:30:45.569 --> 02:30:46.370]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:46.650 --> 02:30:49.693]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:30:51.495 --> 02:30:52.395]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:02.048 --> 02:31:07.355]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:07.355 --> 02:31:11.881]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:11.881 --> 02:31:14.164]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:14.164 --> 02:31:15.786]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:15.786 --> 02:31:16.828]  There is a solution.
[02:31:17.048 --> 02:31:25.471]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:32:02.008 --> 02:32:08.973]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:32:08.973 --> 02:32:10.254]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:32:10.254 --> 02:32:11.075]  It's very real.
[02:32:11.075 --> 02:32:13.317]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:32:13.317 --> 02:32:14.978]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:32:14.978 --> 02:32:19.441]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:52.751]  By the way, a program note here.
[02:33:17.096 --> 02:33:19.658]  We have watched all the entries.
[02:33:19.658 --> 02:33:21.960]  Even a few of the entries we haven't posted yet.
[02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:27.024]  Charlie Sheen, in the last month as they began coming in, watches them every day.
[02:33:27.024 --> 02:33:28.646]  Talked to Charlie at Link last night.
[02:33:29.577 --> 02:33:33.779]  We are down to two or three winners for 20 Minutes with the President.
[02:33:33.779 --> 02:33:36.840]  Spell it out, 20MinutesWithThePresident.com.
[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:42.922]  And we've got master lists posted at 20MinutesWithThePresident.com and Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:42.922 --> 02:33:48.744]  We've narrowed down some of the finalists, but those still may not be the winners, but they're up on Infowars.com.
[02:33:50.103 --> 02:33:53.628]  I'm gonna spend several hours tonight on the phone with Charlie Sheen.
[02:33:53.628 --> 02:33:58.233]  He's judging but he wants me to sit there with him and watch him at the same time with him.
[02:33:58.233 --> 02:34:02.279]  We'll be like trying to click at the exact same moments we can be.
[02:34:02.279 --> 02:34:07.565]  He'll be in his theater, his big theater, his house with YouTube up on the screen watching him and I'll be at home
[02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:13.902]  With the French Bulldog running around biting my ankles and the children running around like heathen.
[02:34:13.902 --> 02:34:15.723]  But they're great.
[02:34:15.723 --> 02:34:20.885]  But we're going to be trying to pick the winner tonight, but we'll announce it next Tuesday.
[02:34:20.885 --> 02:34:26.907]  Charlie Sheen, 12 noon, next Tuesday, second hour of the show.
[02:34:26.907 --> 02:34:30.328]  And we'll be breaking it all down and having the winner on.
[02:34:30.328 --> 02:34:36.731]  But when we pick the winner in the next few days, be ready for us to email you or contact your channel.
[02:34:37.964 --> 02:34:39.505]  So we can have you on with Charlie.
[02:34:39.505 --> 02:34:46.609]  There's gonna be first place $14,000, second place $1,000, third place $500.
[02:34:46.609 --> 02:34:51.392]  And Charlie's paying the $14,000 winner, I'm paying the second and third place winner.
[02:34:51.392 --> 02:34:54.073]  And I think Charlie's just gonna pick all three.
[02:34:54.073 --> 02:34:57.715]  We said he would pick the first person, but we'll just let Charlie pick them all.
[02:34:57.715 --> 02:35:01.758]  But we've narrowed down first place to two different people.
[02:35:02.739 --> 02:35:04.620]  And we're just having a lot of trouble choosing them.
[02:35:21.264 --> 02:35:28.511]  And you reach millions of people and now they see the 20 key bullet points of 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:35:28.511 --> 02:35:34.797]  Okay, going back to Webster Griffin Tarpley, best-selling author, doctor of history and economics.
[02:35:34.797 --> 02:35:35.818]  Webster finishing up
[02:35:37.448 --> 02:35:41.731]  Today with the geopolitical developments.
[02:35:41.731 --> 02:35:50.958]  If they're not able to carry this new war in the Middle East through, what will they then turn to from your strategic over-the-horizon eagle-eye view?
[02:35:50.958 --> 02:35:57.783]  A. B. Let's shift gears in closing into cap-and-trade and your deep research of that.
[02:35:58.615 --> 02:36:03.439]  Well, I think the thing to look at is this wave of Islamophobia that we have.
[02:36:03.439 --> 02:36:04.800]  We talked about this last time.
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:11.505]  We have Major Hassan, the forward who had Patsy, and more stuff every day about what a Patsy he is.
[02:36:11.505 --> 02:36:12.425]  Just more details.
[02:36:12.425 --> 02:36:14.307]  The concept is he's a Patsy.
[02:36:14.307 --> 02:36:18.150]  But remember, back in August, we had this guy Zazie.
[02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:22.693]  Between Queens and Denver, he wanted to blow up New York.
[02:36:22.693 --> 02:36:25.115]  He was this radical mosque in Flushing, Queens.
[02:36:26.075 --> 02:36:28.676]  Now we've got the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed trial, right?
[02:36:28.676 --> 02:36:34.798]  This psychotic Patsy and Faker and his confrere are going to go on trial in New York.
[02:36:34.798 --> 02:36:38.480]  We've got the seizure of the so-called Iranian mosques.
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:45.582]  Mosques that are accused of being the property of Bank Melli and the Alavi Foundation of Iran.
[02:36:45.582 --> 02:36:48.163]  And there's one right down here in Potomac, Maryland.
[02:36:48.163 --> 02:36:49.043]  It's a school, 150 or 200 kids go there.
[02:36:51.144 --> 02:36:53.966]  And the feds are seizing it.
[02:36:53.966 --> 02:36:57.348]  You've also got the new governor of Virginia, McDonnell.
[02:36:57.348 --> 02:37:05.392]  He's a reactionary Republican and he's owned by this guy Pat Robertson, the religious leader, if that's what we can call him.
[02:37:05.392 --> 02:37:06.733]  And Pat Robertson has been making
[02:37:07.293 --> 02:37:14.623]  Very incendiary statements that Islam is not a religion, it's a terrible social doctrine, and he takes it quite far.
[02:37:14.623 --> 02:37:18.628]  You put all this together, we've got an orchestrated wave of Islamophobia.
[02:37:18.628 --> 02:37:23.495]  Now, I don't think this is going in the direction that a neocon would like best.
[02:37:24.281 --> 02:37:27.083]  I think it's going to be more of a Brzezinski-type direction.
[02:37:27.083 --> 02:37:31.067]  I think Pakistan is likely to be the target, along with Afghanistan.
[02:37:31.067 --> 02:37:40.835]  You could say a lot of this orchestration is to push Obama to finally stop dithering and make the commitment to a massive escalation in Afghanistan.
[02:37:40.835 --> 02:37:42.056]  But nothing beyond that.
[02:37:42.056 --> 02:37:42.976]  No new wars.
[02:37:42.976 --> 02:37:46.699]  Those are the Iraq and Afghanistan role the U.S.
[02:37:46.699 --> 02:37:47.240]  can handle.
[02:37:48.228 --> 02:38:04.052]  Now, after that, well, ultimately there will be either a deflationary crash or a hyperinflationary event, and it seems to me that the hyperinflationary one is by far the most likely, given what most governments around the world are doing.
[02:38:04.052 --> 02:38:06.632]  So, that is more or less what Obama said yesterday, right?
[02:38:06.632 --> 02:38:11.694]  He said that we could have a double-dip depression, or double-dip recession, in his terms.
[02:38:11.694 --> 02:38:16.815]  So they're basically warning you now that we're no longer in the springtime of green shoots.
[02:38:17.855 --> 02:38:21.337]  And by the way, over two years ago you said that on air.
[02:38:21.337 --> 02:38:30.703]  You said we're going to have a big recession, going into depression, they're going to have a huge stimulus, say that everything's fine, and then as soon as they've spent that money they're going to come back again.
[02:38:30.703 --> 02:38:32.064]  You were absolutely right, Webster.
[02:38:32.602 --> 02:38:36.023]  Well, at this point, you have to look at what could the Federal Reserve do for them.
[02:38:36.023 --> 02:38:39.844]  The Federal Reserve can't go much below zero, although in theory they could.
[02:38:39.844 --> 02:38:41.705]  They could actually pay banks.
[02:38:41.705 --> 02:38:47.127]  They could have negative interest rates where they pay banks to take the money and speculate with it.
[02:38:47.127 --> 02:38:53.349]  The other thing is, in terms of getting another bailout, and I'm talking part, I'm talking the bailout to the Wall Street banks.
[02:38:54.070 --> 02:39:00.958]  I don't see how this could be done politically at this time, given the terrible experiences that we've had.
[02:39:00.958 --> 02:39:03.662]  So, you see there's a lot of pressure on the Federal Reserve.
[02:39:03.662 --> 02:39:08.128]  There are two congressmen today demanding that Geithner should quit.
[02:39:08.128 --> 02:39:08.969]  Two Republicans.
[02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:15.735]  A couple of days ago, Congressman DeFazio of Oregon demanded that Geisler should also quit.
[02:39:15.735 --> 02:39:24.083]  So I think the finance establishment, the Geisler-Bernanke group, and also with the campaign to audit them, which would be a useful step in itself,
[02:39:24.603 --> 02:39:28.866]  All of this is coming around, and the Fed is really under fire.
[02:39:28.866 --> 02:39:37.592]  You've also got some guy like Dodd, who's trying to win an election in Connecticut, thinks that he can look good by proposing to strip away a lot of the powers of the Fed.
[02:39:37.592 --> 02:39:46.577]  Now, this is a very rotten thing that Dodd is doing, but it shows you that the climate is anti-Wall Street, and I think that's fundamental.
[02:39:46.577 --> 02:39:49.359]  We've also got a lot of momentum around the Tobin tax, right?
[02:39:49.359 --> 02:39:49.599]  The 1% tax.
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:51.360]  Cap-and-trade.
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:54.481]  They're having Schwarzenegger announced in an extra legislative fashion.
[02:39:54.481 --> 02:39:55.941]  Here's Associated Press today.
[02:40:19.468 --> 02:40:23.330]  That power-hungry TVs will be banned from store shelves in California.
[02:40:23.330 --> 02:40:26.731]  They're going to put taxes on other ones.
[02:40:26.731 --> 02:40:28.452]  They're going to tax medical care.
[02:40:28.452 --> 02:40:32.093]  They're going to tax anything with a carbon dioxide footprint.
[02:40:32.093 --> 02:40:38.836]  Other states are adopting it through federal regulations that are outside of law.
[02:40:38.836 --> 02:40:40.597]  They said health care wouldn't pass the House.
[02:40:40.597 --> 02:40:41.037]  It did.
[02:40:41.037 --> 02:40:43.518]  They're now saying cap-and-trade wouldn't pass the House.
[02:40:43.518 --> 02:40:43.838]  It did.
[02:40:44.906 --> 02:40:52.357]  They're still saying, Dianne Feinstein's still saying in the next month, by mid-December, they're going to bring it out for a vote.
[02:40:52.357 --> 02:40:57.124]  But then Inhofe and others are declaring the death of it.
[02:40:57.124 --> 02:40:57.565]  I don't want to...
[02:40:58.479 --> 02:41:04.206]  Quote Mark Twain out of turn here, but rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[02:41:04.206 --> 02:41:07.690]  I mean, they're implementing it through the bureaucracy to begin with.
[02:41:07.690 --> 02:41:09.292]  Europe's implementing it.
[02:41:09.292 --> 02:41:10.794]  It's already happening.
[02:41:10.794 --> 02:41:12.636]  I mean, certainly the momentum is shifting.
[02:41:12.636 --> 02:41:13.657]  The fraud's coming out.
[02:41:13.657 --> 02:41:15.679]  The polls show that the people aren't
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:18.522]  Bamboozled anymore.
[02:41:18.522 --> 02:41:26.208]  Al Gore is being exposed for, you know, doctoring data and all this fraud, but still it's a great danger.
[02:41:26.208 --> 02:41:31.612]  But you were saying when I first talked to you today, before you went live, that you do think it's in trouble.
[02:41:31.612 --> 02:41:32.513]  Now the Copenhagen
[02:41:35.095 --> 02:41:44.086]  Managers are now saying at the UN headquarters, as you know, on Monday, that, okay, we may not get it passed this year, kind of like the Lisbon Treaty.
[02:41:44.086 --> 02:41:47.590]  Give us the bottom line, Webster, in about four minutes on Cap-and-Trade.
[02:41:48.473 --> 02:41:54.915]  There's really also another imperative task for all of us is to torpedo, to stop this Copenhagen conference.
[02:41:54.915 --> 02:41:56.596]  This is a monstrosity.
[02:41:56.596 --> 02:41:57.896]  There's nothing good about this.
[02:41:57.896 --> 02:42:03.178]  This is not like healthcare where there really is a problem and you really ought to do something, but the question is what?
[02:42:03.178 --> 02:42:06.679]  In the case of global warming, it's a complete fraud.
[02:42:06.679 --> 02:42:10.741]  The best thing is do absolutely nothing, therefore we want gridlock.
[02:42:11.181 --> 02:42:14.504]  Now, Obama is engaging in secret diplomacy.
[02:42:14.504 --> 02:42:28.554]  I have a report that Obama had a secret meeting at the White House with a European diplomat who is prominent in the push for this global carbon dictatorship that they want to impose in Copenhagen.
[02:42:28.554 --> 02:42:29.975]  I think it's this guy Bohr.
[02:42:29.975 --> 02:42:31.076]  B-O-H-E-R.
[02:42:31.076 --> 02:42:35.239]  He's the point manager of this entire thing.
[02:42:35.239 --> 02:42:37.561]  So, secret meetings by Obama.
[02:42:37.561 --> 02:42:38.262]  And the idea is
[02:42:39.102 --> 02:42:48.485]  That the Democratic leaders who are pushing this, Pelosi and Reid, are despairing that they can get this through the Congress before Copenhagen.
[02:42:48.485 --> 02:42:51.025]  Their original scenario was the U.S.
[02:42:51.025 --> 02:42:55.807]  would pass a lunatic Malthusian cap-and-trade monstrosity.
[02:42:55.807 --> 02:43:02.589]  That would then be taken by Obama in person to Copenhagen, and he would beat the rest of the world over the head with this thing.
[02:43:02.589 --> 02:43:03.449]  We in the U.S.
[02:43:03.449 --> 02:43:07.670]  were backward under Bush, but now we're more Malthusian than anybody else.
[02:43:08.310 --> 02:43:10.152]  And therefore, you have to do the same thing.
[02:43:10.152 --> 02:43:14.595]  That is failing, and I think that's what this secret diplomacy with Obama was about.
[02:43:14.595 --> 02:43:16.316]  We also have Der Spiegel, right?
[02:43:16.316 --> 02:43:21.240]  The great German news magazine of the liberals.
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:24.622]  And they're saying Obama has fallen short.
[02:43:24.622 --> 02:43:31.087]  He's really betrayed his promise to go with a binding cap-and-trade for the world at Copenhagen.
[02:43:31.087 --> 02:43:35.350]  Now, part of this has to do with the fact the Chinese have said, no, no, no, right?
[02:43:36.551 --> 02:43:38.354]  And the Indians have said no.
[02:43:38.354 --> 02:43:47.188]  There's even a fight between the Indian environmental minister is fighting with these quack scientists in the U.S.
[02:43:47.188 --> 02:43:51.154]  about whether the glaciers in the Himalayas are shrinking or not.
[02:43:51.634 --> 02:43:56.879]  And the Indian guy says there's not any shrinkage that we can see, but the U.S.
[02:43:56.879 --> 02:44:02.904]  quackademics are saying, oh no, it's a serious shrinkage of the glaciers and therefore that's global warming.
[02:44:02.904 --> 02:44:09.851]  I think if the Indian front and the Chinese front can hold, you've also had this thing where the Africans walked out.
[02:44:10.351 --> 02:44:14.854]  Of the Barcelona preparatory meeting, saying you guys have forgotten about Africa.
[02:44:14.854 --> 02:44:22.420]  What they're really angling for, of course, is economic development aid, which they have to mask under the guise of carbon.
[02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:24.421]  So, the big thing is that the U.S.
[02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:30.265]  should not, not pass any cap-and-trade carbon monstrosity before Copenhagen.
[02:44:30.265 --> 02:44:33.588]  And there's a pretty good chance that it will break up.
[02:44:33.588 --> 02:44:35.349]  They'll have some kind of an interim accord.
[02:44:36.449 --> 02:44:39.990]  And when they say, wait till next year, well, next year it's going to look different.
[02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:44.851]  I think Obama will continue to subside, let us say, in U.S.
[02:44:44.851 --> 02:44:45.651]  public opinion.
[02:44:45.651 --> 02:44:49.151]  And Obama's ability to deliver that, I think, is shrinking.
[02:44:49.151 --> 02:44:51.392]  Well, you're right, Webster.
[02:44:51.392 --> 02:44:51.932]  Gridlock.
[02:44:51.932 --> 02:44:52.272]  Yes.
[02:44:52.272 --> 02:44:55.073]  That's what the founders said.
[02:44:55.073 --> 02:44:55.953]  Gridlock is great.
[02:44:55.953 --> 02:44:56.953]  Not a bad thing.
[02:44:56.953 --> 02:45:02.474]  Like the media says they want to just ram their dictatorship of this oligarchy through.
[02:45:03.487 --> 02:45:07.690]  But looking at that, the White House admits, and the U.N.
[02:45:07.690 --> 02:45:11.673]  admits, and they all put out press releases saying, we're desperate.
[02:45:11.673 --> 02:45:16.617]  We've got to get all this done now because our little princeling is crashing and burning.
[02:45:16.617 --> 02:45:18.178]  People are finding out he's a fraud.
[02:45:18.178 --> 02:45:21.640]  You know, they say it in political speech, and I remember how astutely
[02:45:22.541 --> 02:45:40.972]  You pointed out that Obama had 100 to 200 days maximum before the fact that he was the maximum puppet and a betrayer of everything he said he was going to do was exposed and so but he seems to be crashing and burning even faster than you or I would have thought or is that incorrect?
[02:45:41.254 --> 02:45:42.055]  No, I think it's correct.
[02:45:42.055 --> 02:45:49.405]  And I think, remember, as soon as he makes this Afghanistan decision, he's going to lose a whole area of support on his left flank.
[02:45:49.405 --> 02:45:54.892]  Well, that's why he's been dithering and kind of, well, I'll announce $40,000 next week, but I won't really announce it.
[02:45:56.254 --> 02:45:58.075]  December 12th, Lafayette Park protest.
[02:45:58.075 --> 02:45:59.235]  Here's another one, though.
[02:45:59.235 --> 02:46:01.196]  This mammogram question.
[02:46:01.196 --> 02:46:04.157]  That group, this U.S.
[02:46:04.157 --> 02:46:09.759]  board that put out this mammogram monstrosity, that is a death board.
[02:46:09.759 --> 02:46:10.719]  That's a death panel.
[02:46:10.719 --> 02:46:17.102]  Because they say women should not have mammograms until they're 50 and then every other year.
[02:46:17.102 --> 02:46:19.343]  That has one name written all over it.
[02:46:19.343 --> 02:46:20.383]  Peter Orszag.
[02:46:20.783 --> 02:46:28.592]  Peter Orsag, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, has been waging a personal crusade against tests.
[02:46:28.592 --> 02:46:33.698]  He hates mammograms, MRIs, CAT scans, nuclear stress tests, PSA.
[02:46:33.698 --> 02:46:36.801]  You name the test, Orsag wants to take it away.
[02:46:36.801 --> 02:46:40.946]  This is very concrete, and there's a lot of women who are, you know,
[02:46:41.386 --> 02:46:42.847]  Well Webster, Webster, that's the issue, is that
[02:46:59.212 --> 02:47:00.833]  They set up these panels.
[02:47:00.833 --> 02:47:03.013]  It's in the bill.
[02:47:03.013 --> 02:47:09.095]  The author of the original bill, Daschle, wrote a book saying, if you're 60, you don't need eye surgery.
[02:47:09.095 --> 02:47:12.336]  I mean, literally saying, we're going to ration your care.
[02:47:12.336 --> 02:47:16.017]  And then on the other side of their mouth, they try to deny it.
[02:47:16.017 --> 02:47:19.979]  And now they want five years in prison, quarter million dollar fine.
[02:47:19.979 --> 02:47:24.320]  If you don't go get the insurance, they say, and they take money out of your check.
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:27.161]  I mean, this, and you get a national ID card.
[02:47:28.001 --> 02:47:29.462]  I recommend Gridlock once again.
[02:47:29.462 --> 02:47:31.163]  This thing, it's called the U.S.
[02:47:31.163 --> 02:47:33.625]  Preventive Services Task Force.
[02:47:33.625 --> 02:47:35.886]  It doesn't call itself a death board, but it is a death board.
[02:47:35.886 --> 02:47:39.749]  And what they've done, just the announcement they've made, is going to cause deaths.
[02:47:52.157 --> 02:48:06.132]  Because the George Washington University Clinic here in town has announced that on the day after that report came out, they had a whole bunch of women canceling their mammogram appointments saying, well, we don't really need it, we've been assured by these authoritative voices.
[02:48:06.132 --> 02:48:13.380]  This means Orsag went to Rahm Emanuel, and then they both went to Secretary Sebelius of HHS saying, look,
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:15.641]  We've got to get some action.
[02:48:15.641 --> 02:48:20.305]  We've got to cut down these mammograms, because mammograms lead to biopsies.
[02:48:20.305 --> 02:48:34.916]  And if you've seen the members of this board, there was a woman called Gregory, Dr. Gregory, who was on Anderson Cooper, on CNN, and the other woman from the board, there are a number of them that have been on television.
[02:48:35.376 --> 02:48:38.019]  They're all incompetent, right?
[02:48:38.019 --> 02:48:56.457]  On Anderson Cooper they had a debate between Dr. Gregory and a guy from Harvard who really knew about the use of mammograms and she was reduced to stammering silence because this was a rotten political decision designed to save money, again for Wall Street bailouts, by cutting vital services that people really need.
[02:48:58.971 --> 02:49:12.059]  We've got to leave it there, but overall, they are beginning to stall, the people are learning they're not invincible, and the entire collectivist, big government, corporate rating system is in trouble.
[02:49:12.059 --> 02:49:12.739]  Webster?
[02:49:12.739 --> 02:49:13.619]  Absolutely.
[02:49:13.619 --> 02:49:17.322]  All three of your latest books are for sale on Infowars.com.
[02:49:17.322 --> 02:49:18.622]  I suggest people get them.

[02:49:19.643 --> 02:49:20.764]  Thank you.
[02:49:20.764 --> 02:49:22.705]  There goes Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[02:49:22.705 --> 02:49:24.686]  Okay, I want to come back and play some clips.
[02:49:26.689 --> 02:49:35.211]  from the listener comment line and comment on those in this segment in the first five minutes of the next hour then we've got who do we got coming on
[02:49:36.613 --> 02:49:37.933]  It's going to be interesting.
[02:49:37.933 --> 02:49:39.614]  We've got Alan Combs coming on.
[02:49:39.614 --> 02:49:46.896]  Now, I wanted to briefly tell you about some of the sponsors that made today's radio show absolutely possible.
[02:49:46.896 --> 02:49:50.377]  And one of those is SupernaturalSilver.com.
[02:49:50.377 --> 02:49:54.478]  People everywhere are discovering the power of silver sole technology.
[02:49:54.478 --> 02:49:56.258]  Silver sole technology.
[02:49:56.258 --> 02:50:01.180]  This information should be on all major news outlets, but I don't see anyone covering this.
[02:50:02.165 --> 02:50:09.634]  You can find out for yourself why the powers that be are suppressing the groundbreaking technology offered by the patented SupernaturalSilver.com.
[02:50:09.634 --> 02:50:14.801]  This product is essential for home use as well as emergency preparedness.
[02:50:14.801 --> 02:50:20.909]  Arm yourself and your loved ones with SilverSol technology for the bio threats of today and tomorrow.

[02:50:26.454 --> 02:50:29.798]  Once again, that's SupernaturalSilver.com, one word.
[02:50:29.798 --> 02:50:38.326]  And one other sponsor I want to tell you about is DigiNet.net audio and video recorders, sunglasses, hidden pens, everything.
[02:50:39.247 --> 02:50:42.029]  Great prices, great to protect yourself from Big Brother.

[02:50:50.593 --> 02:50:55.516]  That's at DigiNet.net, E-T-F-O-9, DigiNet.net.
[02:50:55.516 --> 02:51:03.059]  Or when you call 888-344-6681 to ask about all their products, tell them Alex Jones sent you, 888-344-6681.
[02:51:03.059 --> 02:51:05.961]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:51:07.210 --> 02:51:07.530]  I think so.
[02:51:22.250 --> 02:51:22.590]  I think so.
[02:51:47.302 --> 02:51:51.684]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:51.684 --> 02:51:54.005]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:54.005 --> 02:51:55.385]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:13.453 --> 02:52:16.136]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:16.136 --> 02:52:22.522]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:22.522 --> 02:52:27.707]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:27.707 --> 02:52:30.990]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:30.990 --> 02:52:37.716]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:37.816 --> 02:52:40.158]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:40.158 --> 02:52:41.739]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:41.739 --> 02:52:44.201]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:44.201 --> 02:52:46.342]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:46.342 --> 02:52:51.486]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:51.486 --> 02:53:00.673]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:02.882 --> 02:53:04.642]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[02:53:04.642 --> 02:53:06.143]  Say no to toxic overload.
[02:53:06.143 --> 02:53:07.483]  Say no to chemicals.
[02:53:07.483 --> 02:53:09.423]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[02:53:09.423 --> 02:53:18.205]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[02:53:18.205 --> 02:53:23.647]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[02:53:23.647 --> 02:53:25.247]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[02:53:25.447 --> 02:53:32.930]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[02:54:17.666 --> 02:54:29.150]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to say, I know a lot of times before we've talked about there's no laws, state laws, in Texas.
[02:54:29.150 --> 02:54:36.793]  You can't bear arms, but I know it's disgusting, it's unconstitutional, but in the Texas state constitution it does
[02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:40.391]  Give the state the right, even though it's against the U.S.
[02:54:40.391 --> 02:54:42.452]  Constitution, to limit the wearing of arms.
[02:54:42.452 --> 02:54:47.373]  And also, there is a law against wearing arms in public.
[02:54:47.373 --> 02:54:50.234]  I just wanted to let you know about that.
[02:54:50.234 --> 02:54:51.735]  Thank you.
[02:54:51.735 --> 02:54:52.895]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[02:54:52.895 --> 02:54:55.216]  This is Chris from Houston, Texas.
[02:54:55.216 --> 02:54:59.398]  And I'm recently been, eyes have been opened.
[02:54:59.398 --> 02:55:03.059]  Pretty, but it really was interesting, and I'm pretty far
[02:55:04.257 --> 02:55:13.219]  I don't know a lot of things, but the chemtrails, they were spraying a lot here yesterday and the day before, just letting them loose.
[02:55:13.219 --> 02:55:24.882]  We haven't covered anything on the chemtrail phenomenon lately, and I was just curious to see if maybe you could have someone come on and talk about the chemtrails and what not.
[02:55:24.882 --> 02:55:31.623]  I read one of your articles about the chemtrails, the aerosol spraying in the Ukraine.
[02:55:32.483 --> 02:55:33.624]  Well, we love you, my friend.
[02:55:33.624 --> 02:55:36.086]  Okay, let me answer those two questions.
[02:55:36.086 --> 02:55:38.748]  I don't have the state law in front of me, but I know you can have open carry in Texas.
[02:55:38.748 --> 02:55:40.409]  It's just the police will come and harass you.
[02:55:57.185 --> 02:55:59.767]  And it's open carry in almost every state in the country.
[02:55:59.767 --> 02:56:02.428]  There are laws against concealed carry.
[02:56:02.428 --> 02:56:08.132]  That's why they give you a permit for concealed carry, because that's the only area they have jurisdiction over.
[02:56:08.132 --> 02:56:10.073]  But I don't have it in front of me, but I happen to know.
[02:56:10.073 --> 02:56:13.335]  I actually got a book at home, but it's a few years old.
[02:56:14.775 --> 02:56:16.896]  The state gun laws in Texas.
[02:56:16.896 --> 02:56:19.998]  And the same publisher puts them out for all 50 states.
[02:56:19.998 --> 02:56:25.741]  But I guess we could pull up state gun laws, open carry, in Texas.
[02:56:25.741 --> 02:56:38.108]  But how do you think people all in Texas, the Black Panthers marching in Houston with loaded shotguns, people in Arizona marching around with AR-15s, people in Vermont doing it, people in California doing it.
[02:56:38.108 --> 02:56:40.970]  But people should check their laws to be sure first.
[02:56:40.970 --> 02:56:42.451]  There were some laws, I know back
[02:56:43.649 --> 02:56:50.473]  In the late 1800s, early 1900s, against wearing arms in bars.
[02:56:50.473 --> 02:56:53.815]  Because that was the old saloon days, worried about drunk people shooting folks.
[02:56:53.815 --> 02:57:02.020]  And some towns would pass laws about you gotta stow your guns at the sheriff's office when you come into the county or the town.
[02:57:02.020 --> 02:57:03.461]  But I believe you're mistaken, sir.
[02:57:03.461 --> 02:57:06.523]  I wish you would have quoted these supposed laws for me.
[02:57:06.523 --> 02:57:10.065]  But that's something we can look into.
[02:57:10.065 --> 02:57:11.226]  It's this ambiguity.
[02:57:12.031 --> 02:57:25.645]  I was listening to a radio show this morning about Steven Seagal has some new cop TV show where he's actually a real cop of some town and they're pulling people over and they're arresting people for guns and oh look he's got a gun in his car he's going to jail.
[02:57:25.645 --> 02:57:29.549]  You can only do that in New York City, Chicago, a few others.
[02:57:32.097 --> 02:57:33.979]  Either we have these rights or we don't.
[02:57:33.979 --> 02:57:38.042]  You know, in Texas, 20 years ago, half the people had guns in their gun racks.
[02:57:38.042 --> 02:57:39.503]  You don't see that now.
[02:57:39.503 --> 02:57:42.805]  Not because there's a law, but because they will harass you.
[02:57:42.805 --> 02:57:45.948]  We have to use our rights or we lose them.
[02:57:45.948 --> 02:57:53.433]  That's how Jews were slowly intimidated to not have businesses and not have political organizations and not be able to sell products by Hitler.
[02:57:54.955 --> 02:57:58.899]  He first treated them like third-class citizens and then started arresting them.
[02:57:58.899 --> 02:58:00.080]  And that's how tyranny works.
[02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:02.022]  As for chemtrails, we talk about chemtrails every week.
[02:58:02.895 --> 02:58:04.196]  You must have missed it.
[02:58:04.196 --> 02:58:09.218]  The White House admits they've got a terraforming slash geoengineering program going on.
[02:58:09.218 --> 02:58:10.318]  They say it's classified.
[02:58:10.318 --> 02:58:14.740]  The details are, but they are spraying us and manipulating the weather.
[02:58:14.740 --> 02:58:25.225]  And that's a whole other issue of them creating weather crises to then offer their political solution, taxing carbon dioxide that plants live off of.
[02:58:25.225 --> 02:58:27.646]  So we're going to come back and play a few more clips.
[02:58:29.346 --> 02:58:31.607]  And comment on those.
[02:58:31.607 --> 02:58:35.209]  And then we've got Alan Combs coming up.
[02:58:35.209 --> 02:58:38.911]  I certainly look forward to that interview.
[02:58:38.911 --> 02:58:44.335]  We'll be right back with the fourth and final hour.
[02:58:44.335 --> 02:58:45.775]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.775 --> 02:58:48.717]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.366 --> 02:58:56.909]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:56.909 --> 02:58:57.829]  Number 1.
[02:58:57.829 --> 02:59:01.251]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:01.251 --> 02:59:02.111]  Number 2.
[02:59:02.111 --> 02:59:07.014]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:07.014 --> 02:59:07.755]  It's true.
[02:59:07.755 --> 02:59:12.617]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:12.617 --> 02:59:13.458]  Number 3.
[02:59:13.458 --> 02:59:17.040]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:20.742]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:20.942 --> 02:59:21.743]  Number 4.
[02:59:21.743 --> 02:59:24.506]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:24.506 --> 02:59:28.190]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:28.190 --> 02:59:28.970]  Number 5.
[02:59:28.970 --> 02:59:33.115]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:33.115 --> 02:59:37.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:42.323]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.323 --> 02:59:44.125]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:44.125 --> 02:59:46.386]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:46.386 --> 02:59:48.728]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:00:03.171 --> 03:00:05.813]  You've reached the InfoWars comment line.
[03:00:05.813 --> 03:00:08.795]  You've got 60 seconds for your question or comment.
[03:00:08.795 --> 03:00:09.536]  60 seconds.
[03:00:09.536 --> 03:00:12.898]  And if it's good, we'll put it on air.
[03:00:12.898 --> 03:00:14.639]  Hey Alex, JT in Chicago.
[03:00:14.639 --> 03:00:29.470]  Just wanted to remind you in fighting this cap and trade and fighting this social health care, I just want to remind you that we just, we aren't fighting for the condi, crony, capitalist system status quo.
[03:00:30.290 --> 03:00:47.096]  The Ponzi and Crony system, I like to call the Cronzy system, doesn't work for many of us anymore with the de-industrialization of our nation and with the heavy onset of illegal immigration, the debt-based system that enslaves many of us.
[03:00:47.096 --> 03:00:55.980]  It's important to note that with all the people out there fighting for different causes, we've got the constitutionalists like ourselves, we've got anarchists and socialists,
[03:00:57.492 --> 03:00:58.813]  We're not fighting together.
[03:00:58.813 --> 03:01:00.414]  We're all going in different directions.
[03:01:00.414 --> 03:01:02.235]  So we all have to find some common ground.
[03:01:02.235 --> 03:01:05.917]  Quick shout out to Chicago We Are Change.
[03:01:05.917 --> 03:01:07.538]  Quick plug for Police State Watch.
[03:01:07.538 --> 03:01:08.359]  Thanks.
[03:01:08.359 --> 03:01:10.540]  This is Ken from Washington State.
[03:01:10.540 --> 03:01:12.701]  Hey, I just wanted to give you guys a heads up.
[03:01:12.701 --> 03:01:17.524]  I'm looking around on the web to see if you already know about it or where it might be reported on the internet.
[03:01:18.385 --> 03:01:31.336]  I just saw a blurb, a small blurb on CNN, something about the White House is attempting to block Congress or dissuade them from doing any kind of probe into the Fort Hood shootings.
[03:01:31.336 --> 03:01:39.003]  So I found that kind of interesting and I'm still waiting to hear the spin that CNN is going to put on that, what's going on.
[03:01:39.003 --> 03:01:41.726]  I'm looking for it on the web, but you might want to look into it.
[03:01:41.726 --> 03:01:41.866]  Bye.
[03:01:45.879 --> 03:01:47.680]  At that point, I will comment.
[03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:51.922]  I think the first caller's statements are self-evident.
[03:01:51.922 --> 03:01:53.642]  No need to comment on the second one.
[03:01:53.642 --> 03:01:56.243]  Yes, they've declared national security.
[03:01:56.243 --> 03:02:02.386]  Congress has been told, under national security, you're not allowed to investigate or even request information.
[03:02:02.386 --> 03:02:11.910]  See, under PDD 51, Presidential Decision Directive 51, it's stated Congress has no authority over anything dealing with national security.
[03:02:11.910 --> 03:02:13.311]  Emergencies, wars,
[03:02:14.608 --> 03:02:19.010]  Congress passes the laws and orders the President around.
[03:02:19.010 --> 03:02:22.711]  The Founding Fathers stated that Congress was the most powerful of three branches.
[03:02:22.711 --> 03:02:25.332]  Then they lied to the public and said, no, they're co-equal.
[03:02:25.332 --> 03:02:28.133]  Now they say the President is above the courts and the Congress.
[03:02:28.133 --> 03:02:28.773]  No.
[03:02:28.773 --> 03:02:33.595]  It goes to the Legislative, the Judicial, the President, the Executive.
[03:02:33.595 --> 03:02:35.056]  That's how our system works.
[03:02:35.056 --> 03:02:36.756]  It's the Congress raises the money.
[03:02:36.756 --> 03:02:40.738]  They declare war and then say, here are your orders, Commander-in-Chief.
[03:02:42.418 --> 03:02:46.262]  Just like the generals take orders from the legislature.
[03:02:46.262 --> 03:02:48.344]  It's legislatures that levy war.
[03:02:48.344 --> 03:02:51.867]  It was the Continental Congress that started the Revolutionary War.
[03:02:51.867 --> 03:02:52.808]  It's the Congress.
[03:02:52.808 --> 03:02:56.812]  It's elected by us, our representatives of the states.
[03:02:56.812 --> 03:02:58.934]  You have this transfer of power to the executive.
[03:03:02.748 --> 03:03:09.690]  The highest level security clearance members of Congress aren't allowed to see anything, not even the entire text of PDD 51.
[03:03:09.690 --> 03:03:17.993]  Then you have the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 that states that homeland security is for the states to oppress the states and the people.
[03:03:17.993 --> 03:03:19.834]  I mean, this is all stated.
[03:03:19.834 --> 03:03:22.255]  NORTHCOM is a criminal organization.
[03:03:22.255 --> 03:03:25.656]  It's not our military that's bad, it's what they've set up is illegal.
[03:03:27.468 --> 03:03:30.651]  And they're covering up Fort Hood at every level.
[03:03:30.651 --> 03:03:33.673]  Tarpley's written an incredible article detailing all the patsy evidence.
[03:03:33.673 --> 03:03:35.234]  There was a drill going on.
[03:03:35.234 --> 03:03:36.295]  Three shooters.
[03:03:36.295 --> 03:03:39.037]  They said he was dead for six, seven hours.
[03:03:39.037 --> 03:03:46.724]  They knew he was planning all this, supposedly, when he was sending emails to Al-Qaeda that were really going to the CIA, because that is Al-Qaeda.
[03:03:46.724 --> 03:03:49.386]  And Fort Hood is definitely some type of staged event.
[03:03:50.365 --> 03:03:52.227]  At bare minimum, they knew he was going to do it.
[03:03:52.227 --> 03:03:52.707]  Let him do it.
[03:03:52.707 --> 03:03:57.872]  I mean, you bad-mouth Obama in the slightest way, you get court-martialed or a dishonorable discharge.
[03:03:57.872 --> 03:04:02.917]  This guy was running around for four years going wild on Bush, Obama, you name it.
[03:04:03.912 --> 03:04:06.435]  And they let that guy do what he did.
[03:04:06.435 --> 03:04:08.336]  And that's probably only just the beginning of it.
[03:04:08.336 --> 03:04:11.079]  That's only the surface of this situation.
[03:04:11.079 --> 03:04:14.162]  We're going to come back, do a little bit of a news blitz, some news on the economy.
[03:04:14.162 --> 03:04:17.806]  Then Alan Combs is joining us in about, what, middle of the next segment.
[03:04:17.806 --> 03:04:19.788]  Looking forward to that today.
[03:04:19.788 --> 03:04:23.031]  And by the way, great job to the crew.
[03:04:23.031 --> 03:04:27.195]  They are really taking it to the next level.
[03:04:28.324 --> 03:04:29.666]  All of them.
[03:04:29.666 --> 03:04:37.052]  Craig Sadler, Jaron Nyhart, Ryan, everybody in there is just absolutely kicking butt.
[03:04:37.052 --> 03:04:39.774]  And we want to salute their work and thank them.
[03:04:39.774 --> 03:04:43.618]  Be sure and check out the article getting all the headlines around the country and the world.
[03:04:43.618 --> 03:04:45.159]  Getting a lot of attention.
[03:04:45.159 --> 03:04:48.982]  With hurricanes at 30 year low, Gore turns to Photoshop.
[03:04:48.982 --> 03:04:51.364]  The king of cap and trade simply airbrushes them in.
[03:04:52.225 --> 03:04:54.610]  to his new book to create a more scary Earth.
[03:04:54.610 --> 03:04:56.474]  Paul Joseph Watson, PrisonPlanet.com.

[03:06:35.143 --> 03:06:37.225]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[03:06:37.225 --> 03:06:38.967]  You need to look out for yourself.
[03:06:38.967 --> 03:06:41.510]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:46.235]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[03:06:46.235 --> 03:06:49.939]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[03:06:49.939 --> 03:06:53.062]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:06:53.062 --> 03:06:54.964]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:06:54.964 --> 03:06:57.066]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:07:03.300 --> 03:07:07.301]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:07:07.301 --> 03:07:10.542]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:07:10.542 --> 03:07:15.343]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:07:15.343 --> 03:07:21.744]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:07:21.744 --> 03:07:23.985]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:07:24.525 --> 03:07:24.825]  Tim Geithner?
[03:07:24.825 --> 03:07:25.326]  Bernanke?
[03:07:25.326 --> 03:07:26.006]  They're arsonists!
[03:07:26.006 --> 03:07:27.287]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:07:27.287 --> 03:07:29.528]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:07:43.416 --> 03:07:45.558]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:07:45.558 --> 03:07:50.701]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[03:07:50.701 --> 03:08:03.451]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:03.451 --> 03:08:09.015]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.559 --> 03:08:24.224]  Well, we got Alan Combs, syndicated radio talk show host, formerly of Hannity & Combs, joining us for a little bit of a discussion, friendly debate.
[03:08:24.224 --> 03:08:28.667]  I don't want to be enemies with him, I disagree with him on almost everything.
[03:08:28.667 --> 03:08:31.309]  It's coming up in about 5-6 minutes for the rest of the hour.
[03:08:32.898 --> 03:08:34.399]  But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[03:08:34.399 --> 03:08:49.469]  Ted, what is it like for you, I'm going to put this up on screen for all the viewers, that Rush Limbaugh spent a lot of an hour today reading a Prison Planet article by Paul Watson about Al Gore's global warming fraud where he's caught photoshopping and fake graphs and everything.
[03:08:50.931 --> 03:08:52.111]  I mean, Limbaugh
[03:09:10.826 --> 03:09:16.031]  Is, I guess, being forced to really start to tell the truth or he's gonna lose his audience.
[03:09:16.031 --> 03:09:19.854]  See, as long as we get the people to wake up, everybody else will follow.
[03:09:19.854 --> 03:09:23.978]  You educate the public about the New World Order, it's game over for the globalists.
[03:09:23.978 --> 03:09:28.782]  Well, the neat part about it, Alex, is that the truth is very, very, very popular.
[03:09:28.782 --> 03:09:33.386]  And it's gone so far now that even the mainstream media have to pick it up.
[03:09:33.386 --> 03:09:36.669]  And I just think it's just awesome to see your article.
[03:09:37.324 --> 03:09:40.527]  Front page, RushLimbaugh.com.
[03:09:40.527 --> 03:09:41.929]  I don't know how it can get better than that.
[03:09:41.929 --> 03:09:46.093]  That's just... Well, front page, he doesn't usually have a giant headline.
[03:09:46.093 --> 03:09:49.436]  It's like, dun-dun-dun, go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:09:49.436 --> 03:09:52.579]  And he's attacked Prison Planet repeatedly, other articles over the years.
[03:09:53.440 --> 03:09:55.681]  So he knows he's linking to us?
[03:09:55.681 --> 03:09:57.082]  Very strange.
[03:09:57.082 --> 03:09:58.363]  Yeah, I would say so.
[03:09:58.363 --> 03:10:04.167]  But like you said, Alex, it is very interesting to hear Rush Limbaugh talk about the New World Order.
[03:10:04.167 --> 03:10:07.789]  I mean, it is just an amazing turning point.
[03:10:07.789 --> 03:10:10.671]  Obviously, we have an effect out there.
[03:10:10.671 --> 03:10:12.272]  We're getting somewhere with this.
[03:10:12.272 --> 03:10:15.093]  A lot of that is due to your efforts and your team.
[03:10:15.093 --> 03:10:17.395]  And I just really salute you for that one, man.
[03:10:17.395 --> 03:10:21.317]  You guys have just blown the lid off of this thing, and I think it's just great.
[03:10:21.437 --> 03:10:23.639]  But Ted, it's scary how big we're getting.
[03:10:23.639 --> 03:10:28.864]  I mean, you're sitting right on top of all this, and I'm sorry, but I think it's a keg of TNT.
[03:10:28.864 --> 03:10:33.309]  I mean, dozens and dozens of newspapers a day attacking us.
[03:10:33.309 --> 03:10:41.036]  Media Matters, George Soros, CBS News, Jerusalem Post, Salon, New Republic.
[03:10:41.036 --> 03:10:43.338]  I mean, Ted, this is wild!
[03:10:43.999 --> 03:10:44.800]  Yeah.
[03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:48.384]  I mean, I'm right there on the White House enemies list in the top 25.
[03:10:48.384 --> 03:10:50.286]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[03:10:50.286 --> 03:10:51.027]  It really is.
[03:10:51.027 --> 03:10:53.509]  It's getting to be really something else.
[03:10:53.509 --> 03:10:54.731]  I have to say that.
[03:10:54.731 --> 03:11:00.457]  But again, Alex, I mean, the reason why I'm here is because I've got little kids.
[03:11:00.457 --> 03:11:01.978]  Well, when I started, they were little kids.
[03:11:01.978 --> 03:11:02.719]  They're big now.
[03:11:02.719 --> 03:11:03.540]  They're all grown up.
[03:11:03.700 --> 03:11:04.860]  Yeah, one of them's in the army.
[03:11:04.860 --> 03:11:06.421]  Has he been sent to Afghanistan yet?
[03:11:06.421 --> 03:11:08.481]  Well, he's right now in Iraq.
[03:11:08.481 --> 03:11:09.342]  Oh, boy.
[03:11:09.342 --> 03:11:14.163]  Well, he's in Kuwait, but he'll be at his post in Iraq here probably next week.
[03:11:14.163 --> 03:11:16.563]  And then my daughter, of course, in college.
[03:11:16.563 --> 03:11:22.205]  I mean, the future generation just doesn't stand a chance at all.
[03:11:22.725 --> 03:11:29.288]  Unless if we can turn this country around and get it back on the proper track instead of the direction that we've been heading.
[03:11:29.288 --> 03:11:35.412]  And I think everybody realizes that now, obviously, including Rush Limbaugh, which I think is just amazing.
[03:11:35.412 --> 03:11:38.093]  And you're right, it could be a keg of TNT.
[03:11:38.093 --> 03:11:43.776]  And, you know, if we make a difference and I end up getting blown up in the process, well then so be it.
[03:11:44.622 --> 03:11:51.229]  Yeah, there's nothing like being truly alive and just playing the cards you've been dealt and let the chips fall where they may.
[03:11:51.229 --> 03:11:53.451]  We're doing the right thing and that's the end of it.
[03:11:53.451 --> 03:11:55.853]  Damn the torpedoes, go straight at them.
[03:11:55.853 --> 03:11:58.516]  Ted, briefly, because Alan Combs is coming up in a moment.
[03:11:58.516 --> 03:11:59.937]  Oh, we just got him?
[03:11:59.937 --> 03:12:00.558]  Oh great, okay.
[03:12:02.762 --> 03:12:04.603]  Ted, tell people about today's gold offer.
[03:12:04.603 --> 03:12:11.886]  You're able to hold yesterday's gold prices of where you bought gold in the market a few weeks ago at the $1,050 level.
[03:12:11.886 --> 03:12:18.849]  It's at $1,145, $95 above what you bought this in the market, but it's running out.
[03:12:18.849 --> 03:12:20.130]  You're at the very end of it.
[03:12:20.130 --> 03:12:22.471]  Tell us the coin offerings you've got today.
[03:12:22.751 --> 03:12:23.831]  Yeah, I sure will.
[03:12:23.831 --> 03:12:27.032]  I mean, right now I have the Franks currently at $263.
[03:12:27.032 --> 03:12:30.873]  The British Sovereigns are currently at $325.
[03:12:30.873 --> 03:12:38.175]  But with silver jumping up over $18 an ounce, one of the best buys that I have is the Walking Liberty half at $869.
[03:12:38.175 --> 03:12:40.756]  The Lakota Nation coins, we still hold those down at $2244.
[03:12:40.756 --> 03:12:41.716]  And we have a variety of
[03:12:45.512 --> 03:12:52.336]  Man, I've got such a small amount of buffaloes, I don't even want to mention that I have them, but they're there if you're interested in those, you can ask for them.
[03:12:52.336 --> 03:13:00.981]  We have a pretty good supply of Canadian Maple Leafs in the safe, and the Eagles, and Krugerrands, just a few.
[03:13:00.981 --> 03:13:06.644]  What you want to do is you want to call your representative at MIDAS at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:13:06.644 --> 03:13:14.749]  The reason for that right now is that supplies are getting thin, and you'll find that out if you try to stop down at your local jewelry store.
[03:13:15.349 --> 03:13:17.870]  Or a coin shop, pawn shop, that type of thing.
[03:13:17.870 --> 03:13:21.251]  You can see that everything's bought up.
[03:13:21.251 --> 03:13:27.713]  Ted, fire out the toll-free number for listeners to call the brokers and tell them it's the Alex Jones Special and take advantage of this.
[03:13:27.713 --> 03:13:29.714]  They're not going to find a deal this good anywhere.
[03:13:29.714 --> 03:13:31.614]  Yeah, the telephone number is 1-800-686-2237.
[03:13:31.614 --> 03:13:31.834]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[03:13:42.096 --> 03:13:45.297]  800-686-2237.
[03:13:45.297 --> 03:13:51.839]  London Telegraph reporting major gold reserves running out worldwide while this boom kicks in.
[03:13:51.839 --> 03:13:59.361]  The dollar imploding because the last three administrations, or even more, have been devaluing the currency.
[03:13:59.361 --> 03:14:03.823]  It is now the time to get into gold and silver and the best place to do it is Midas Resources.
[03:14:03.823 --> 03:14:04.203]  800-686-2237. 800.
[03:14:09.425 --> 03:14:10.406]  6-8-6, 2-2-3-7.
[03:14:10.406 --> 03:14:15.470]  Ted, any closing comments on gold and silver and where this market's going?
[03:14:15.470 --> 03:14:23.316]  It appears the new stabilization level is at about 1,140, an all-time new level.
[03:14:23.316 --> 03:14:24.737]  Yeah, it is.
[03:14:24.737 --> 03:14:29.641]  It tried to dip down into that 1,030 level today, but didn't succeed.
[03:14:29.641 --> 03:14:32.184]  It ended up shooting right back up again.
[03:14:32.184 --> 03:14:33.805]  There obviously is some pressure.
[03:14:34.245 --> 03:14:38.068]  By the major institutions in New York City and that kind of thing.
[03:14:38.068 --> 03:14:44.914]  They do like to try, you know, they're trying to sell gold and prop up the dollar, but it's not a successful effort.
[03:14:44.914 --> 03:14:49.157]  And honestly, I just have to say that the dollar's falling.
[03:14:49.157 --> 03:14:52.400]  You better look at gold and silver as part of your portfolio.
[03:14:52.400 --> 03:14:57.844]  I was even talking to one guy, very conservative, he says you should have at least 10% of your portfolio in gold.
[03:14:57.844 --> 03:14:59.406]  I think that number's way low.
[03:14:59.406 --> 03:15:02.528]  But if you're, you know, if that's all you can do, do it.
[03:15:03.709 --> 03:15:13.017]  Right now, you know, with what's going on in Washington, with all these handouts, bailouts, and everything that's happening, the value of the dollar is going to get hit.
[03:15:13.017 --> 03:15:14.198]  We just know that's going to happen.
[03:15:14.198 --> 03:15:14.698]  Absolutely.
[03:15:14.698 --> 03:15:15.359]  Thank you, Ted.
[03:15:15.359 --> 03:15:17.641]  Midas Resources standing by to take your call.
[03:15:17.641 --> 03:15:20.043]  They can answer your questions, 800-686-2237 or MidasResources.com.
[03:15:20.043 --> 03:15:20.643]  Thank you, Ted.
[03:15:23.826 --> 03:15:24.506]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[03:15:40.493 --> 03:15:41.975]  And all the rest of it.
[03:15:41.975 --> 03:15:45.418]  And we've now seen 11 months of President Obama in office.
[03:15:45.418 --> 03:15:56.929]  I want to get his take on the President and what the Republicans are doing and what's going to happen when Republicans get back in office in a year and then they continue to go down the same line as Obama has.
[03:15:57.569 --> 03:16:01.930]  What's going to happen is the public figures out both parties are controlled by the same corporate interests.
[03:16:01.930 --> 03:16:07.571]  Maybe Alan disagrees, but certainly the patience of the American people is running out.
[03:16:07.571 --> 03:16:11.271]  The honeymoons for politicians are shorter and shorter.
[03:16:11.271 --> 03:16:26.254]  Alan Combs, of course, the host of the Alan Combs Nationally Syndicated Radio Show that airs throughout the United States on Fox News Radio, and of course he also co-hosted from 96-2009 the co-host of Hannity and Combs, a nightly political debate show on Fox News.
[03:16:27.174 --> 03:16:31.115]  Alex, I don't think I ever gave you as good an introduction as you just gave me, so thank you very much.
[03:16:31.115 --> 03:16:31.496]  I appreciate it.
[03:16:52.611 --> 03:16:53.891]  You bet, you bet.
[03:16:53.891 --> 03:16:56.352]  Allen, look, I don't want to sit here and attack you.
[03:16:56.352 --> 03:16:58.673]  You don't really attack me too bad when I come on your show.
[03:16:58.673 --> 03:16:59.333]  No.
[03:16:59.333 --> 03:17:01.774]  But, but, come on, man!
[03:17:01.774 --> 03:17:06.815]  Obama, the Peace Prize, 40,000 more troops staffed in.
[03:17:06.815 --> 03:17:07.715]  But he got the Peace Prize.
[03:17:07.715 --> 03:17:08.616]  Is it Obama's fault?
[03:17:08.616 --> 03:17:10.756]  You want to blame him that he got the prize?
[03:17:10.756 --> 03:17:12.777]  Well, does he deserve it?
[03:17:12.777 --> 03:17:13.737]  I would have waited.
[03:17:13.737 --> 03:17:17.198]  But, I mean, why attack him for a prize someone else gave him?
[03:17:19.827 --> 03:17:23.589]  But it just shows the delusional socialist... I don't like him.
[03:17:23.589 --> 03:17:27.231]  He didn't do it.
[03:17:27.231 --> 03:17:31.173]  I mean, maybe you don't like that he got the prize, but I think he's got some... a lot to prove.
[03:17:31.173 --> 03:17:34.095]  Look, I've got an issue with him on Afghanistan.
[03:17:34.095 --> 03:17:35.035]  I want a decision made.
[03:17:35.035 --> 03:17:36.676]  I want to get out of Afghanistan.
[03:17:36.676 --> 03:17:38.437]  We probably agree on that.
[03:17:38.437 --> 03:17:41.499]  I don't want another quagmire like we had in Iraq.
[03:17:41.499 --> 03:17:43.660]  And I think he needs to earn that prize.
[03:17:43.660 --> 03:17:45.201]  But it's not his fault that he got it.
[03:17:46.857 --> 03:17:54.620]  Well, I mean, I guess that's a good one-liner, Alan, but regardless of the fact, it's embarrassing that he got it, and I think it blew up in everybody's face.
[03:17:54.620 --> 03:17:57.541]  It's embarrassing, but it's not embarrassing to him.
[03:17:57.541 --> 03:17:59.641]  He didn't give it to himself.
[03:17:59.641 --> 03:18:02.762]  I'll tell you what is embarrassing for sure, and I do think it's embarrassing.
[03:18:02.762 --> 03:18:10.365]  It shows all this worshipping, this fawning, like he's Gandhi and Martin Luther King rolled up into one when he hasn't done one one-hundredth of what they did.
[03:18:10.365 --> 03:18:11.605]  Now, that's my opinion.
[03:18:11.605 --> 03:18:13.306]  I just think it diminishes the price.
[03:18:14.025 --> 03:18:18.428]  Look, I think obviously there was a great deal of excitement about the campaign.
[03:18:18.428 --> 03:18:27.814]  He offered a lot of hope to people at a time when the country seemed hopeless, when we had a lot of problems because of the Bush-Cheney regime.
[03:18:27.814 --> 03:18:32.718]  And people were looking for something, and he came along and was the right charismatic character at the right time.
[03:18:32.718 --> 03:18:34.339]  Now he's got to do the work.
[03:18:34.339 --> 03:18:36.440]  And obviously he can't live up to the hype.
[03:18:36.440 --> 03:18:37.021]  Nobody can.
[03:18:38.402 --> 03:18:39.803]  Look, I'm more progressive.
[03:18:39.803 --> 03:18:41.364]  I want to see him be more bold.
[03:18:41.364 --> 03:18:44.186]  I want to see him close Guantanamo by executive order.
[03:18:44.186 --> 03:18:45.327]  Do it tomorrow.
[03:18:45.327 --> 03:18:47.829]  I'm glad they're doing trials in civilian court.
[03:18:47.829 --> 03:18:49.651]  Show that our criminal justice system works.
[03:18:49.651 --> 03:18:51.132]  I want to see him get out of Afghanistan.
[03:18:51.132 --> 03:18:52.894]  I want to get out of Iraq faster.
[03:18:52.894 --> 03:18:55.295]  I want him to stand up for something in terms of healthcare.
[03:18:55.295 --> 03:18:58.838]  The public option, on the table or off the table, where does he stand?
[03:18:58.838 --> 03:19:03.202]  From a progressive point of view, I'd like to see a bolder approach by the president.
[03:19:04.324 --> 03:19:07.125]  Alan, quick 60 second comment, because we're going to break.
[03:19:07.125 --> 03:19:10.325]  You're doing the syndicated show, what else are you up to these days?
[03:19:10.325 --> 03:19:18.407]  Up here on the channel, probably working on a book, I do my website, alan.com, and developing other television projects.
[03:19:18.407 --> 03:19:22.087]  So you're busy, yeah, a full-time syndicated nightly, what, three-hour show?
[03:19:22.087 --> 03:19:25.048]  You know what it takes to do a daily radio show, that alone is a full-time job.
[03:19:25.048 --> 03:19:31.449]  You know, I don't know how you and Hannity and others could do it, multi-hour radio shows and then a highly produced TV show every night.
[03:19:32.370 --> 03:19:38.714]  A lot of good help, a lot of great staff and the people who help you things not fall through the cracks.
[03:19:38.714 --> 03:19:39.995]  Okay, this is a long break.
[03:19:39.995 --> 03:19:41.176]  We're going to come back to you.
[03:19:41.176 --> 03:19:42.577]  I want to get into Afghanistan.
[03:19:42.577 --> 03:19:45.158]  I want to talk about a host of issues with Alan Combs.
[03:19:45.158 --> 03:19:48.060]  I want to get the answer to that question I threw out.
[03:19:48.060 --> 03:19:50.942]  I threw out so many, I don't blame him for not answering it.
[03:19:50.942 --> 03:19:56.926]  This political crisis in America, in that no matter what party we put in, the status quo continues.
[03:19:56.926 --> 03:19:58.266]  Where does he see that going?
[03:19:58.266 --> 03:19:59.807]  Alan Combs is our guest.
[03:19:59.807 --> 03:20:00.468]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:20:03.328 --> 03:20:06.291]  What's so crazy about not starving?
[03:20:06.291 --> 03:20:13.179]  To cover yourself and your family in the event of accidents or emergency, you may have home, life, auto, dental and health insurance.
[03:20:13.179 --> 03:20:14.901]  But what about food insurance?
[03:20:14.901 --> 03:20:17.164]  Water and food are vital to human survival.
[03:20:17.164 --> 03:20:19.687]  So what's so crazy about not starving?
[03:20:19.847 --> 03:20:26.231]  Foodinsurance.com has designed emergency packs and kits with at least two weeks worth of great tasting food and clean water.
[03:20:26.231 --> 03:20:32.295]  Most Foodinsurance.com meals are freeze-dried, which means they'll last and retain nutritional value up to 10 years.
[03:20:32.295 --> 03:20:40.860]  Foodinsurance.com meals like lasagna, beef stroganoff, and other tasty entrees are quick, delicious, simple to prepare, and start at just $1.99.
[03:20:40.860 --> 03:20:44.342]  The low cost is just one reason to get Foodinsurance.com.
[03:20:44.662 --> 03:20:45.242]  More reasons?
[03:20:45.242 --> 03:20:50.426]  Foodinsurance.com kits come with a lightweight, high-quality backpack and a free utensil tool.
[03:20:50.426 --> 03:20:54.469]  Go to foodinsurance.com or call 1-866-946-8366.
[03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:58.832]  That's 1-866-946-8366.
[03:20:58.832 --> 03:21:04.356]  Get protected at foodinsurance.com.
[03:21:04.356 --> 03:21:07.998]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:07.998 --> 03:21:11.621]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:11.621 --> 03:21:13.042]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:21:13.729 --> 03:21:16.410]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:16.410 --> 03:21:22.791]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:22.791 --> 03:21:28.333]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:28.333 --> 03:21:37.975]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:38.095 --> 03:21:40.437]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:40.437 --> 03:21:42.038]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:42.038 --> 03:21:44.480]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:44.480 --> 03:21:46.601]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:46.601 --> 03:21:51.765]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:51.765 --> 03:21:56.769]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:21:56.769 --> 03:22:00.872]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:02.896 --> 03:22:05.517]  Worried that inflation will destroy your savings?
[03:22:05.517 --> 03:22:06.678]  Grab a pencil.
[03:22:06.678 --> 03:22:15.703]  I'll tell you how to turn $10,000 into potentially $431,000 in 12 to 18 months, thanks to Obama.
[03:22:15.703 --> 03:22:18.244]  And this isn't about gold bullion or coins.
[03:22:18.244 --> 03:22:19.965]  It's about gold stocks.
[03:22:19.965 --> 03:22:21.306]  They have soared over 800% since the year 2000.
[03:22:23.787 --> 03:22:32.610]  This is with gold being less than $1,000, a figure that should go to between $1,500 and $2,500 according to Merrill Lynch and UBS.
[03:22:32.610 --> 03:22:43.813]  Even better, wait till you hear what Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter says in his free Investing in Gold kit.
[03:22:43.813 --> 03:22:49.275]  It highlights seven must-own stocks, including a stock with six-figure potential whose price
[03:22:52.261 --> 03:22:54.342]  Call 888-722-6600.
[03:22:54.342 --> 03:22:58.784]  That's 888-722-6600.
[03:22:58.784 --> 03:23:02.765]  Or go to the website, InflationSurvivalKit.com.
[03:23:02.765 --> 03:23:04.066]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:23:04.066 --> 03:23:09.648]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:23:09.648 --> 03:23:14.670]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:23:14.670 --> 03:23:17.951]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[03:23:17.951 --> 03:23:19.712]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:23:20.231 --> 03:23:25.455]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:23:25.455 --> 03:23:27.776]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:23:27.776 --> 03:23:32.579]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:23:32.579 --> 03:23:33.700]  And here's the best part.
[03:23:33.700 --> 03:23:36.782]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:23:36.782 --> 03:23:40.385]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:23:40.385 --> 03:23:43.587]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:23:43.587 --> 03:23:45.808]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:23:45.808 --> 03:23:46.729]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:23:50.371 --> 03:23:53.335]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:23:53.335 --> 03:23:59.442]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:23:59.442 --> 03:24:01.825]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:24:12.296 --> 03:24:16.978]  Alan Combs with us until the end of the broadcast here in about 35 minutes from now.
[03:24:16.978 --> 03:24:23.182]  Alan.com is his website and ours is PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com.
[03:24:23.182 --> 03:24:25.783]  Alan, you heard my question.
[03:24:25.783 --> 03:24:36.148]  I mean I'm really worried about this country because the establishment keeps baiting and switching with the two parties and I really don't see that big of a difference when it comes to monetary and economic policy.
[03:24:36.148 --> 03:24:40.310]  Bush's economic team basically is Obama's team in many respects.
[03:24:40.310 --> 03:24:41.471]  A lot of it came from Clinton.
[03:24:42.271 --> 03:24:47.355]  And all the economists I have on from the fake left and right, the whole system, say that this is going to destroy us.
[03:24:47.355 --> 03:24:48.296]  What's your take on that?
[03:24:48.296 --> 03:24:50.918]  Well, I don't know if it's going to destroy us.
[03:24:50.918 --> 03:24:54.021]  I mean, no one even saw the economic collapse coming a year and a half ago.
[03:24:54.021 --> 03:24:56.482]  But Alex, you generally don't like who's in office.
[03:24:56.482 --> 03:24:58.284]  You see the two parties are similar.
[03:24:58.284 --> 03:25:00.346]  You don't think anybody's got the solution.
[03:25:00.346 --> 03:25:01.386]  Who would you support?
[03:25:01.386 --> 03:25:09.173]  I'm just curious, because you seem to be against whoever we elect at any given election, and you don't think anybody's got the answers.
[03:25:09.173 --> 03:25:09.513]  Who does?
[03:25:10.080 --> 03:25:17.388]  Well no, that's because the establishment, because of the billions of dollars spent on the election cycles every couple years, is able to select
[03:25:18.513 --> 03:25:21.214]  People actually fantasize about a Paul Kucinich or vice versa ticket.
[03:25:48.456 --> 03:25:53.177]  Which seemed implausible and probably wouldn't win.
[03:25:53.177 --> 03:25:55.278]  But look, I don't know the answer to your question.
[03:25:55.278 --> 03:25:57.778]  I'd like to believe that the stimulus will work.
[03:25:57.778 --> 03:26:00.459]  The market's gone back up.
[03:26:00.459 --> 03:26:02.799]  I'd like to believe it's going to open up the credit markets.
[03:26:02.799 --> 03:26:08.441]  They said it's going to take until 2010 before we get some kind of financial or jobs back.
[03:26:08.441 --> 03:26:10.301]  It took a while to get to this place.
[03:26:10.301 --> 03:26:11.922]  It's going to take us a while to get out.
[03:26:11.922 --> 03:26:12.922]  I'm not an economist.
[03:26:12.922 --> 03:26:13.702]  I don't have the answers.
[03:26:14.417 --> 03:26:15.578]  Well, I'll just say this.
[03:26:15.578 --> 03:26:20.320]  It's a political cheap shot as much as I hate George W. Bush and the neocons.
[03:26:20.320 --> 03:26:22.602]  I believe they were involved in 9-11, as you know, Alan.
[03:26:22.602 --> 03:26:23.262]  Yeah.
[03:26:23.262 --> 03:26:28.325]  But as bad as they are... I believe there are enough people who agree with you almost on a daily basis.
[03:26:28.325 --> 03:26:36.390]  My issue is to have Obama's people blaming the economic collapse on Bush when it was the Clinton people that got rid of Glass-Steagall.
[03:26:36.390 --> 03:26:41.813]  I mean, he has as much to blame, his crew has as much to blame as the Republicans.
[03:26:42.981 --> 03:26:44.401]  Well, it's easy to say that.
[03:26:44.401 --> 03:26:49.403]  Look, it was Bush who was in office when the collapse happened.
[03:26:49.403 --> 03:26:51.704]  It was the deregulation of Republicans.
[03:26:51.704 --> 03:26:55.305]  It was the idea that Bush had this thing about the Community Redevelopment Program.
[03:26:55.305 --> 03:26:56.605]  Anybody can own a home.
[03:26:56.605 --> 03:26:57.706]  That started under Clinton.
[03:26:57.706 --> 03:26:58.946]  Bush took it though a step further.
[03:26:59.446 --> 03:27:02.992]  No mortgage, don't worry, we'll get you a home.
[03:27:02.992 --> 03:27:04.815]  You don't have to have a lot of credentials.
[03:27:04.815 --> 03:27:11.405]  And that was the thing that the Republicans were pushing, home ownership for everybody, when everybody was not qualified to do it.
[03:27:11.405 --> 03:27:13.028]  That caused the collapse of Freddie and Fannie.
[03:27:15.296 --> 03:27:18.019]  Which is my point.
[03:27:18.019 --> 03:27:22.583]  The same people... Well, McClatchy's come out with a big list of reports.
[03:27:22.583 --> 03:27:35.096]  They got internal documents from Goldman Sachs where two years before the collapse, they were secretly betting against housing while they were telling all their clients to buy housing because they wanted to consolidate the market.
[03:27:35.096 --> 03:27:38.079]  I mean, are you for auditing the private Federal Reserve, Alan?
[03:27:38.987 --> 03:27:40.368]  I don't know a lot about the Federal Reserve.
[03:27:40.368 --> 03:27:45.750]  I know that libertarians and people who agree with you often will bring up the Federal Reserve.
[03:27:45.750 --> 03:27:46.550]  And I'm not an economist.
[03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:49.992]  It's not an area that I really know a lot about.
[03:27:49.992 --> 03:27:53.913]  So I'm not educated enough to give you an intelligent answer to that question.
[03:27:53.913 --> 03:27:54.974]  That's ridiculous.
[03:27:54.974 --> 03:27:57.054]  You can't punt on this, Alan.
[03:27:57.054 --> 03:27:57.915]  Come on, tell me.
[03:27:57.915 --> 03:27:59.115]  I don't know.
[03:27:59.115 --> 03:28:01.436]  The Federal Reserve has never been fully audited.
[03:28:01.436 --> 03:28:02.717]  Don't you think there should be transparency?
[03:28:04.130 --> 03:28:06.413]  Good, Alan Combs for auditing the Fed.
[03:28:06.413 --> 03:28:08.256]  That's beautiful.
[03:28:08.256 --> 03:28:12.943]  Briefly, before we go to a bright, long segment coming up, what do you think would fix America?
[03:28:12.943 --> 03:28:15.066]  I mean, where do you stand on Afghanistan?
[03:28:15.066 --> 03:28:16.288]  I want to get out.
[03:28:16.288 --> 03:28:17.309]  Why are we spending all this money?
[03:28:17.309 --> 03:28:17.670]  Why don't we...
[03:28:18.286 --> 03:28:35.156]  Why do we diddle around about healthcare, and people complain about how much money it's going to cost, and people yell at me about where their tax dollars are going, but when it comes to war, nobody questions how long will it be, what will it cost, what's our exit strategy, how much taxpayer dollars are going, how are we going to pay for it, are our children and grandchildren going to pay for it?
[03:28:35.156 --> 03:28:38.998]  Why does nobody ask those questions when it comes to war, but only when it comes to social services?
[03:28:44.252 --> 03:28:49.287]  How big a part of the war and the whole defense budget, how big a piece of that is it?
[03:28:50.145 --> 03:28:55.326]  I mean, isn't that like 45% of all the expenditures is related to defense?
[03:28:55.326 --> 03:28:57.867]  I don't know the exact number.
[03:28:57.867 --> 03:29:00.547]  A huge amount of the budget goes to defense.
[03:29:00.547 --> 03:29:01.087]  We know that.
[03:29:01.087 --> 03:29:04.008]  A disproportionate amount goes to defense.
[03:29:04.008 --> 03:29:15.030]  A small amount goes to welfare, to public good, to social programs, and yet those are the things the conservatives scream about, but most of their dollars are going elsewhere.
[03:29:19.457 --> 03:29:24.520]  So in the final equation, where do you think this country is going to be in five years?
[03:29:24.520 --> 03:29:26.201]  I couldn't have predicted we'd be where we are now.
[03:29:26.201 --> 03:29:27.801]  Who would have thought Obama would be president?
[03:29:27.801 --> 03:29:29.723]  Who would have thought the economic collapse?
[03:29:29.723 --> 03:29:35.526]  Anybody who tells you now what they know is going to happen in five years is just shooting in the wind.
[03:29:35.526 --> 03:29:36.086]  I don't know.
[03:29:36.086 --> 03:29:40.628]  I said five years ago gold would be $1,000 an ounce in five years, Alan.
[03:29:40.628 --> 03:29:41.429]  Well, you're a genius.
[03:29:42.864 --> 03:29:46.725]  You heard it from Alan Combs, on at the Fed, and I'm a genius.
[03:29:46.725 --> 03:29:48.566]  Hey, I like it.
[03:29:48.566 --> 03:29:49.406]  Alan, stay with us.
[03:29:49.406 --> 03:29:53.228]  I got some real questions coming up after this break.
[03:29:53.228 --> 03:29:54.628]  We're on the march.
[03:29:54.628 --> 03:29:57.149]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:57.149 --> 03:29:59.850]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.642 --> 03:30:11.788]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:30:11.788 --> 03:30:15.150]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:30:15.150 --> 03:30:21.034]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[03:30:21.034 --> 03:30:25.797]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:30:25.797 --> 03:30:28.159]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:30:28.419 --> 03:30:28.799]  I think?
[03:30:44.735 --> 03:30:45.055]  I think so.
[03:31:03.220 --> 03:31:06.241]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:31:06.241 --> 03:31:11.563]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:31:11.563 --> 03:31:13.604]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:31:13.604 --> 03:31:18.606]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:31:18.606 --> 03:31:19.787]  How much do you want?
[03:31:19.787 --> 03:31:20.927]  When do you want it?
[03:31:20.927 --> 03:31:22.808]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:31:22.808 --> 03:31:23.868]  When will you need it?
[03:31:23.868 --> 03:31:26.069]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:31:26.069 --> 03:31:27.430]  Will there be any food?
[03:31:27.430 --> 03:31:28.951]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:31:28.951 --> 03:31:29.991]  If there's a quarantine,
[03:31:30.151 --> 03:31:31.473]  And you can't feed yourself?
[03:31:31.473 --> 03:31:34.196]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:31:34.196 --> 03:31:37.801]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:31:37.801 --> 03:31:41.626]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:31:41.626 --> 03:31:42.847]  How much will you need?
[03:31:42.847 --> 03:31:43.748]  We don't know.
[03:31:43.748 --> 03:31:44.850]  How much do you want?
[03:31:44.850 --> 03:31:45.591]  All you can get.
[03:31:45.591 --> 03:31:46.612]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:31:46.872 --> 03:31:49.916]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:32:02.210 --> 03:32:09.196]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:32:09.196 --> 03:32:10.457]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:32:10.457 --> 03:32:11.277]  It's very real.
[03:32:11.277 --> 03:32:15.181]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[03:32:15.181 --> 03:32:19.644]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:51.921]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[03:33:11.084 --> 03:33:21.950]  Alan comes with us another 27 minutes or so, and I'm going to let Alan ask me some questions, too, because you've been asking me, you know, what I think of Glenn Beck and stuff during the break, so we'll do that all live here on air.
[03:33:21.950 --> 03:33:26.773]  But, Alan, let's get down to brass tacks on the subject of New World Order, world government.
[03:33:27.657 --> 03:33:42.246]  Fifteen, sixteen years ago, I would read UN documents calling for a global government, calling for global one-child policies, Trilateral Commission calling for it, I would talk about it, I would be called a kook, written up in federal reports as dangerous.
[03:33:42.246 --> 03:33:45.168]  Now, I have in my hand, we're also live on the internet on TV,
[03:33:45.948 --> 03:33:46.808]  We can do it.
[03:33:46.808 --> 03:33:53.031]  New York Times, October 26, 2009, Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the UN.
[03:33:53.031 --> 03:33:56.553]  He calls for global government structure, global governance.
[03:33:56.553 --> 03:34:01.875]  In the article, those are quotes, and says the carbon tax will finance the global government.
[03:34:01.875 --> 03:34:03.956]  So let me ask Alan Combs.
[03:34:03.956 --> 03:34:07.517]  We now have Limbaugh admitting world government after denying it for decades.
[03:34:07.517 --> 03:34:08.538]  We now have Glenn Beck.
[03:34:09.702 --> 03:34:11.483]  Uh, coming along, talking about it.
[03:34:11.483 --> 03:34:13.624]  So it's kind of like a right-wing issue now.
[03:34:13.624 --> 03:34:32.171]  Uh, and then meanwhile, the Southern Property Law Center, ADL, CBS News, I mean, I've got all these articles right here, Salon, Media Matters, all the George Soros publications, are saying I am basically this dangerous liar who is lying to everyone and saying world government is here.
[03:34:32.171 --> 03:34:32.811]  Alan Combs.
[03:34:34.432 --> 03:34:42.581]  Because any given day I can go to Google and type in new world order world government and get hundreds of articles in mainstream news announcing world government saying it's good.
[03:34:42.581 --> 03:34:47.926]  So Alan Combs, I'm asking you, how is the mainstream media going to have this?
[03:34:47.926 --> 03:34:52.271]  Where they say there is no world government, no move towards global government, but
[03:34:54.471 --> 03:34:57.453]  At the same time, admit that there's a world government.
[03:34:57.453 --> 03:35:01.676]  How do they admit there's a world government, but then separately, if you talk about it, and say you don't want it?
[03:35:01.676 --> 03:35:03.878]  They are admitting there's a world government.
[03:35:03.878 --> 03:35:06.280]  As far as Moon is concerned, he runs the UN.
[03:35:06.280 --> 03:35:09.762]  I don't know exactly what he said about world government.
[03:35:09.762 --> 03:35:12.965]  You have people like Beck and you have Limbaugh who have such contempt.
[03:35:13.505 --> 03:35:20.246]  For Obama, that they're going to say, oh my God, look at this Marxist, look at this horrible left-wing totalitarian.
[03:35:20.246 --> 03:35:36.289]  He wants to take over the world and scare people and make them believe that somehow with a liberal lefty guy in the government who is, they think in some cases, not the people I mentioned, but some of their followers believe he was born in Kenya, wasn't even an American, and how dare this guy take over our government.
[03:35:36.289 --> 03:35:36.989]  They're going to run it.
[03:35:36.989 --> 03:35:38.190]  It's going to be a world government.
[03:35:38.190 --> 03:35:39.270]  It's fear-mongering.
[03:35:41.322 --> 03:35:42.483]  We're going with what the U.N.
[03:35:42.483 --> 03:35:43.503]  says, Alex.
[03:35:43.503 --> 03:35:45.205]  We are a sovereign country.
[03:35:45.205 --> 03:35:48.247]  We're not in any danger of not becoming a sovereign country.
[03:35:48.247 --> 03:35:50.749]  I don't believe that the U.N.
[03:35:50.749 --> 03:35:53.711]  or any other world body will be taken over our government.
[03:35:53.711 --> 03:35:58.134]  Of course, we do have to have treaties with other countries, whether it's treaties on the environment,
[03:35:58.889 --> 03:36:04.570]  As you mentioned, whether it's economic issues, we live in a world community.
[03:36:04.570 --> 03:36:07.311]  It does take a village, and it takes a global village.
[03:36:07.311 --> 03:36:14.933]  So the idea that we can live isolated from the rest of the world, but in terms of sovereignty, nobody's taking over the United States.
[03:36:14.933 --> 03:36:17.114]  Look at the World Trade Organization Agreement.
[03:36:17.114 --> 03:36:20.074]  It has more power than our Congress does over trade.
[03:36:20.074 --> 03:36:23.215]  Let me read you what Ban Ki-moon said in the New York Times.
[03:36:23.215 --> 03:36:26.216]  A deal must include an equitable global governance structure.
[03:36:27.415 --> 03:36:32.159]  All countries must have a voice in how resources are deployed and managed.
[03:36:32.159 --> 03:36:41.786]  Well, that's a way of saying there, if you read the whole article, that the UN is going to decide where the resources go and the countries will have their say.
[03:36:41.786 --> 03:36:44.708]  Well, the UN doesn't have a right to unilaterally make that decision.
[03:36:44.708 --> 03:36:47.390]  Ban Ki-moon can say whatever he wants to say.
[03:36:47.390 --> 03:36:50.553]  He runs a global organization because he says it.
[03:36:51.254 --> 03:36:54.040]  Hold on, but Alan, here's what I'm saying.
[03:36:54.040 --> 03:36:58.068]  You can't say people are kooks.
[03:36:58.068 --> 03:36:59.912]  And I'm not saying you're saying this, but I'm...
[03:37:01.064 --> 03:37:06.229]  Just because they talk about global government when it's in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles.
[03:37:06.229 --> 03:37:07.290]  Here's the problem.
[03:37:07.290 --> 03:37:15.037]  I talked about how they were going to devalue the currency, bring in a global carbon tax, a monetary tax, set up this private global government around the IMF.
[03:37:15.037 --> 03:37:16.339]  That's now been announced.
[03:37:16.339 --> 03:37:16.859]  Here it is.
[03:37:16.859 --> 03:37:18.380]  Financial Times of London.
[03:37:18.380 --> 03:37:20.302]  And now for a world government.
[03:37:20.302 --> 03:37:24.486]  And they go on to say we need global government now and it needs to be authoritarian to save the planet.
[03:37:25.407 --> 03:37:27.528]  Well, you say they say it, Alex.
[03:37:27.528 --> 03:37:29.510]  There are always people who are going to say that.
[03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:32.892]  There are going to be people who say we need a world government.
[03:37:32.892 --> 03:37:36.094]  There are going to be crazy people who say we're going to take over the world.
[03:37:36.094 --> 03:37:41.977]  But the sovereign nations of the world are not going to submit to a world government.
[03:37:41.977 --> 03:37:47.801]  Unless they're bankrupted from the inside by the very same banking institutions that are founding the world government.
[03:37:49.463 --> 03:37:51.024]  No, we are.
[03:37:51.024 --> 03:37:54.867]  Okay, did Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are they making record profits right now?
[03:37:54.867 --> 03:37:57.569]  Did they come out smelling like a king?
[03:37:57.569 --> 03:38:02.433]  Smelling like a 24 karat rose after the crisis last year?
[03:38:02.433 --> 03:38:03.434]  Didn't they fold?
[03:38:03.434 --> 03:38:04.175]  One of them folded.
[03:38:04.175 --> 03:38:07.057]  I mean, I don't know how they call that smelling like a rose.
[03:38:07.057 --> 03:38:08.518]  I don't see it that way at all.
[03:38:08.518 --> 03:38:12.501]  No, JPMorgan record profits, Goldman Sachs record profits.
[03:38:12.501 --> 03:38:14.603]  They got to take over Bear Stearns, their competition.
[03:38:15.862 --> 03:38:20.344]  What about all the companies that folded, that failed, that couldn't survive?
[03:38:20.344 --> 03:38:26.367]  You know, that indeed, institutions, Lehman Brothers, that you thought would be around forever.
[03:38:26.367 --> 03:38:28.008]  It was a great consolidation.
[03:38:28.008 --> 03:38:31.090]  That's what the bigger, more powerful central banks wanted.
[03:38:31.090 --> 03:38:35.492]  It was Goldman Sachs that had their people all over the government in the key regulatory positions.
[03:38:35.492 --> 03:38:44.076]  Look, if you are someone who worries about world government, and you spend a lot of time, you will take everything you see as a sign that that apocalypse is coming.
[03:38:44.076 --> 03:38:44.897]  I don't see it that way.
[03:38:47.515 --> 03:38:51.017]  Oh, Alan, I'm not saying an apocalypse is coming.
[03:38:51.017 --> 03:38:52.357]  That kind of apocalypse.
[03:38:52.357 --> 03:39:08.025]  I have CBS News, I have ADL saying... You can quote those media organizations that may bring you stories about those people who think this is happening, but we are and will continue to be a sovereign nation.
[03:39:08.025 --> 03:39:10.406]  Alan, let me just finish this point to you.
[03:39:10.406 --> 03:39:12.107]  I'm here looking at the ADL.
[03:39:12.107 --> 03:39:12.467]  It says
[03:39:13.835 --> 03:39:23.685]  Rage grows in America, anti-government conspiracies, anger on the fringes, Alex Jones the conspiracy king, and then they go and... You should be flattered, you're a king!
[03:39:25.788 --> 03:39:32.432]  Yeah, but they say I'm bad because I talk about a global government run by private banks.
[03:39:32.432 --> 03:39:35.314]  That's what's being set up at the G20!
[03:39:35.314 --> 03:39:37.355]  They're actually proposing it!
[03:39:37.355 --> 03:39:42.058]  Well, again, you do wander into conspiracy theory territory.
[03:39:42.058 --> 03:39:47.061]  No country is going to give up their sovereignty to allow a global government.
[03:39:47.061 --> 03:39:51.384]  Do you really think the United States, under Obama or anybody else, are going to give up its sovereignty?
[03:39:52.093 --> 03:40:01.943]  We'll still have the American flag out there flapping in the wind, but for all intents and purposes, just like the IMF and World Bank go in and take over third world countries... Why would they?
[03:40:01.943 --> 03:40:02.964]  We're not a third world country.
[03:40:02.964 --> 03:40:07.148]  Why would the United States submit to a larger entity to run a sovereign...
[03:40:07.808 --> 03:40:18.916]  Because we have corporate interests that want vertical integration and want to end our industrial society to make the public more manageable and to impose a forced planetary one-child policy.
[03:40:18.916 --> 03:40:23.980]  Have you read the textbook written by White House science czar John P. Holdren?
[03:40:23.980 --> 03:40:25.080]  I didn't know he had czars.
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:27.082]  That's a media invention, that word.
[03:40:27.082 --> 03:40:28.403]  I know I didn't read his textbook.
[03:40:29.391 --> 03:40:38.536]  But I've read about him and again I read how the people who again fear Obama and believe that he's a Marxist are somehow going to take over the world.
[03:40:38.536 --> 03:40:40.397]  This is conspiracy theory stuff, Alex.
[03:40:40.748 --> 03:40:43.849]  Well, Alan, I think that's the left-cover argument.
[03:40:43.849 --> 03:40:56.493]  And I know they have the right now playing the part of the party out of power, and so now they can talk about the New World Order and make it a discredited Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, right-wing situation.
[03:40:56.493 --> 03:41:07.477]  I think the fake neocon, warmongering, torture-loving criminals, you know, with all of their insider, you know, deals with no-bid weapons contracts, they should love Obama!
[03:41:07.477 --> 03:41:10.078]  Continuing secret arrests, continuing indefinite...
[03:41:10.438 --> 03:41:11.919]  At least you'll admit that.
[03:41:11.919 --> 03:41:13.520]  Most liberals will just say, no he's not.
[03:41:13.520 --> 03:41:13.860]  And in fact,
[03:41:37.671 --> 03:41:39.913]  He's intensifying a lot of this.
[03:42:07.731 --> 03:42:12.932]  Who gave Bush and Cheney permission to violate the Constitution.
[03:42:12.932 --> 03:42:16.433]  Alancoms.com syndicated radio host.
[03:42:16.433 --> 03:42:17.273]  Now you can tune in.
[03:42:17.273 --> 03:42:20.474]  What was that noise?
[03:42:20.474 --> 03:42:23.995]  We just lost his line.
[03:42:23.995 --> 03:42:25.315]  Oh, we've got him back.
[03:42:25.315 --> 03:42:26.015]  Alan, are you there?
[03:42:26.015 --> 03:42:29.256]  Yeah, that was the government listening in, Alex.
[03:42:29.256 --> 03:42:32.457]  Now it's probably the deteriorating infrastructure in this country falling apart.
[03:42:32.457 --> 03:42:34.297]  It's part of the one world government taking over.
[03:42:36.224 --> 03:42:38.405]  Alan, you don't have a microchip in your brain, do you?
[03:42:38.405 --> 03:42:39.625]  Not that I know of.
[03:42:39.625 --> 03:42:41.185]  Are you a reptoid?
[03:42:41.185 --> 03:42:44.486]  Not that I know of.
[03:42:44.486 --> 03:42:47.107]  Maybe you're just a voice hologram.
[03:42:47.107 --> 03:42:48.607]  Maybe I'm not even talking to Alan Cohn.
[03:42:48.607 --> 03:42:50.227]  You know, I've had surgery in my life.
[03:42:50.227 --> 03:42:53.948]  Who knows what they've implanted in me when I was under anesthesia.
[03:42:53.948 --> 03:42:57.869]  Maybe you're just a computer program that Rupert Murdoch has there at the Fox Studios.
[03:42:57.869 --> 03:43:01.010]  You know, and he may have done such a good job, but I actually think I'm human.
[03:43:05.253 --> 03:43:09.456]  There's actually an argument for that, that Hannity could be a wind-up toy android.
[03:43:09.456 --> 03:43:13.518]  You just pull the string and he has like ten statements he makes.
[03:43:13.518 --> 03:43:14.759]  I would have no knowledge of that.
[03:43:14.759 --> 03:43:19.462]  You're a great American, Alan.
[03:43:19.462 --> 03:43:21.124]  Oh my god, this is insane.
[03:43:21.124 --> 03:43:23.865]  You highlighted this.
[03:43:23.865 --> 03:43:25.046]  We were talking about Glenn Beck.
[03:43:25.046 --> 03:43:26.707]  A lot of people compare the two of you.
[03:43:26.707 --> 03:43:31.731]  A lot of people believe that your act and his in many ways are similar.
[03:43:36.077 --> 03:43:44.328]  No, because the establishment is creating this patriotoid, conspiracitoid counterfeit
[03:43:45.242 --> 03:44:00.988]  Where Glenn Beck says he's fighting the New World Order, but then says we've got to launch new wars, and the Arabs have snuck nukes into the country, and right when Ron Paul had a chance to actually win during the primaries, Glenn Beck came out and said, this money bomb, that means blowing up people.
[03:44:00.988 --> 03:44:04.790]  He may be a terrorist, his listeners, we may need to use the army against them.
[03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:07.151]  I mean, these are almost exact quotes.
[03:44:07.151 --> 03:44:07.431]  And then,
[03:44:08.499 --> 03:44:11.320]  The Wall Street Journal's reporting they've built some FEMA camps.
[03:44:11.320 --> 03:44:13.780]  Beck comes out and says, none of them exist.
[03:44:13.780 --> 03:44:14.700]  None of them exist.
[03:44:14.700 --> 03:44:18.001]  And then he acts like a complete Froot Loop.
[03:44:18.001 --> 03:44:19.401]  And I'm serious.
[03:44:19.401 --> 03:44:19.941]  On purpose.
[03:44:19.941 --> 03:44:20.562]  He's an actor.
[03:44:20.562 --> 03:44:21.522]  A very good actor.
[03:44:21.522 --> 03:44:24.843]  Because, see, I've been listening to him off and on for like nine years.
[03:44:24.843 --> 03:44:26.343]  So I've seen his evolution.
[03:44:26.343 --> 03:44:29.564]  And I just know he's as phony as a $3 bill.
[03:44:29.564 --> 03:44:31.324]  And I'm all about real.
[03:44:31.684 --> 03:44:35.467]  Even if I don't like somebody, if they're real, I tend to, you know, respect them.
[03:44:35.467 --> 03:44:47.094]  But I don't like Glenn Beck because he's a Judas goat meant to take control of the Tea Parties, take control of the Libertarian movement that Ron Paul heads, and flush it down the Rupert Murdoch toilet.
[03:44:47.094 --> 03:44:49.656]  Well, I don't think we might flush it down the Rupert Murdoch toilet.
[03:44:49.656 --> 03:44:55.320]  He's probably Ron Paul's biggest advocate, along with Judge Napolitano here at Fox News.
[03:44:55.320 --> 03:44:59.703]  They seem to be appealing to a lot of the very same people who support Ron Paul.
[03:45:02.455 --> 03:45:04.976]  I think Napolitano is for real.
[03:45:04.976 --> 03:45:08.077]  He's a true libertarian.
[03:45:08.077 --> 03:45:10.017]  He's actually against the torture.
[03:45:10.017 --> 03:45:12.038]  He's actually against the war.
[03:45:12.038 --> 03:45:13.138]  He never changes.
[03:45:13.138 --> 03:45:15.258]  Against the Patriot Act.
[03:45:15.258 --> 03:45:16.298]  But not Glenn Beck.
[03:45:16.298 --> 03:45:19.219]  I've seen Glenn Beck.
[03:45:19.219 --> 03:45:20.159]  This is why I don't like Glenn Beck.
[03:45:20.159 --> 03:45:21.820]  I'm going to quit talking about him because I want to talk to Alan Combs.
[03:45:25.018 --> 03:45:31.561]  I have video clips, we played them here, where he said, the banker bailout is good, we must have it or it's all over.
[03:45:31.561 --> 03:45:35.763]  Then he came back three months later and said, you know I was against the bailout.
[03:45:35.763 --> 03:45:39.944]  He comes out and says he's for the Patriot Act.
[03:45:39.944 --> 03:45:41.705]  He's a flip-flopper.
[03:45:41.705 --> 03:45:47.288]  Well, I honestly have not followed him that closely, so I could not cite for you chapter, verse, of what he said.
[03:45:47.288 --> 03:45:52.630]  But many people see the two of you in the same category in that you seem to view the government in a similar manner.
[03:45:53.439 --> 03:45:54.459]  Well, I want to be clear.
[03:45:54.459 --> 03:46:04.124]  If I embraced Glenn Beck and kissed up to him, I could be on his show, and I've had little entrees laid out from neocon organizations to go join them, and I'm not.
[03:46:04.124 --> 03:46:08.966]  So I'm not here attacking Beck because I'm jealous of his big TV show, as some people say.
[03:46:08.966 --> 03:46:15.468]  I'm attacking Beck because I saw this guy say he was for the banker bailout, and then later say he never was.
[03:46:15.468 --> 03:46:18.270]  I mean, and there's a hundred examples of this.
[03:46:18.270 --> 03:46:21.071]  So, I believe he's a Benedict Arnold.
[03:46:23.374 --> 03:46:26.836]  Okay, well, I guess we won't see you on his show anytime soon then.
[03:46:26.836 --> 03:46:30.097]  No, you won't see me in the building, but apparently not.
[03:46:30.097 --> 03:46:32.999]  No, you won't see me anywhere near there, because I've got to be real.
[03:46:32.999 --> 03:46:34.459]  I mean, that's all I got, Alan.
[03:46:34.459 --> 03:46:38.901]  Speaking of being real, let's go to the fake left here, and I want your take on this.
[03:46:38.901 --> 03:46:46.665]  Chris Matthews, Carlos Watson, Chris Matthews, Carlos Watson, people on CNN, Anderson Cooper, I'm sure you've seen this.
[03:46:47.245 --> 03:46:53.409]  Everywhere saying, look at the tea parties, look at that woman, that's code for not liking black people.
[03:46:53.409 --> 03:46:56.971]  Oh, if you say it's socialism, that's code for racism.
[03:46:56.971 --> 03:47:03.715]  No, I mean even Newsweek said we're all socialists now, that this is a move towards more collectivism.
[03:47:03.715 --> 03:47:11.860]  Isn't that liberal limousine, liberal race pimping, to always inject race in, to make it a polarizing issue?
[03:47:13.142 --> 03:47:18.276]  I don't think saying that Obama is a socialist or headed down the road of socialism means you're a racist.
[03:47:18.276 --> 03:47:20.903]  I do think among those people, not all of them,
[03:47:21.590 --> 03:47:31.595]  But I do think a substantial number of people who've been promoting this birther movement, that he was born in Kenya, he's not really an American, he's black, you know, that he's not one of us.
[03:47:31.595 --> 03:47:46.083]  I think among the tea-beggars, the tea-partiers, whatever you call them, there are people who do, you know, they've been racist signs, and there are among those people, there are enough, some of them are racist, enough to make me uncomfortable.
[03:47:46.083 --> 03:47:50.906]  And there are people who don't like the fact that a black guy who they believe was born in another country,
[03:47:51.940 --> 03:47:54.210]  Uh, was, is President of the United States.
[03:47:54.210 --> 03:47:55.979]  If that's not, I mean, some of that is racist.
[03:47:57.771 --> 03:48:21.287]  I'm sure you can find a small percentage that are, but most people that are mad at President Obama are mad because he's for the banker bailout, he's for future bailouts, he's for more wars, he's for the Patriot Act now, he's for warrantless wiretapping, and they don't like, I mean, he said he was going to balance the budget and cut spending and he's outdone Bush in his first year.
[03:48:21.867 --> 03:48:23.948]  Alan, let me go back on this on the issue of
[03:48:51.098 --> 03:48:56.683]  And this is what Matthews and others have said, that it is code for racism to say the word socialism.
[03:48:56.683 --> 03:49:17.279]  Let's say 10% of the people that are birthers or Tea Party members, a lot of these are my listeners out there saying, defend our Second Amendment, defend our sovereignty, it's mean to call them teabaggers, and it's a way to demonize them politically, and it's a good throwaway line, and I wish you wouldn't use it, but I know it's too much fun, but at its core,
[03:49:18.439 --> 03:49:36.891]  At its core, people are genuinely upset with Obama, and by the mainstream media and the fake liberal media invoking racism, it's creating a lot more racial tension than maybe 10% of anti-Obama people being truly racist.
[03:49:36.891 --> 03:49:37.852]  I mean, I think it's wrong.
[03:49:37.852 --> 03:49:43.316]  You don't agree that invoking, that when someone hears the word socialism, a lot of people believe that.
[03:49:43.316 --> 03:49:46.018]  They now think if I speak out against socialism,
[03:49:46.638 --> 03:49:48.399]  Which really is just corporate corruption.
[03:49:48.399 --> 03:49:49.839]  They always steal the money.
[03:49:49.839 --> 03:49:52.980]  Even if you're for socialism, it never works because of the corruption.
[03:49:52.980 --> 03:49:56.121]  Isn't that invoking all sorts of racial division?
[03:49:56.121 --> 03:50:00.582]  Doesn't the left... I don't think saying socialism indicates racism.
[03:50:00.582 --> 03:50:05.744]  I think, as I said, there are some other things that they're going after Obama about that I think indicate racism.
[03:50:05.744 --> 03:50:06.544]  The birther stuff.
[03:50:06.684 --> 03:50:14.727]  But I'm saying, invoking this, the progressives, the left, always saying people that don't agree with Obama are racist.
[03:50:14.727 --> 03:50:18.128]  I'm not saying you're saying that, but that's what some of these other people are saying.
[03:50:18.128 --> 03:50:20.169]  Some of them are, and I've seen, we've seen more of it.
[03:50:20.169 --> 03:50:22.289]  I get more of those calls on my radio show.
[03:50:22.289 --> 03:50:24.570]  I get, you know, people calling up with watermelon jokes.
[03:50:24.570 --> 03:50:27.031]  I mean, you know, there is some of that going on.
[03:50:27.031 --> 03:50:35.894]  Look, if Hillary Clinton had been the nominee, she would be, they'd be doing gender stuff, and there'd be a lot of sexism going on.
[03:50:36.394 --> 03:50:38.456]  Well, no, they would say she's a lesbian.
[03:50:38.456 --> 03:50:40.597]  I mean, there's sexism there.
[03:50:40.597 --> 03:50:48.844]  Whenever we break a glass ceiling, whether it's race or sex, there are people who are going to make jokes and it's going to be unpleasant.
[03:50:48.844 --> 03:50:51.526]  But you look at Comedy Central, it's full of racial jokes.
[03:50:51.526 --> 03:50:53.927]  I mean, we're a lot more crass today than we were.
[03:50:53.927 --> 03:50:57.390]  I don't think it's always done because of racist reasons.
[03:50:57.390 --> 03:51:01.713]  When you hear a racial or sexist joke, I mean, you go to the comedy clubs, that's all you hear.
[03:51:01.713 --> 03:51:02.294]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:03.254 --> 03:51:07.135]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.

[03:52:11.877 --> 03:52:13.278]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:14.182 --> 03:52:16.663]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:16.663 --> 03:52:23.064]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:23.064 --> 03:52:28.606]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:28.606 --> 03:52:38.228]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:38.348 --> 03:52:40.690]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:40.690 --> 03:52:42.291]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:42.291 --> 03:52:44.754]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:44.754 --> 03:52:46.875]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:46.875 --> 03:52:52.020]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:54:23.121 --> 03:54:25.923]  Constitution, to be the chairman of the U.N.
[03:54:25.923 --> 03:54:26.724]  Security Council.
[03:54:26.724 --> 03:54:28.925]  That's only a small part of the film.
[03:54:28.925 --> 03:54:31.527]  Infowars.com.
[03:54:31.527 --> 03:54:35.211]  Alan, I think the mainstream media on the left and right are destroying their credibility.
[03:54:35.951 --> 03:54:37.632]  And they keep denying the world government.
[03:54:37.632 --> 03:54:39.633]  They keep denying globalization is taking over.
[03:54:39.633 --> 03:54:41.713]  They keep denying what's happening.
[03:54:41.713 --> 03:54:45.355]  And I think that the mainstream media's days are numbered.
[03:54:45.355 --> 03:54:47.636]  And I think this country is going into revolution.
[03:54:47.636 --> 03:54:48.957]  I don't want it to be violent.
[03:54:48.957 --> 03:54:49.917]  No, Alex, come on.
[03:54:49.917 --> 03:54:51.398]  You know, that's kind of a hype.
[03:54:51.398 --> 03:54:57.620]  That's a very hyper, you know, that's a statement that's an inflammatory, alarmist kind of statement.
[03:54:57.620 --> 03:54:57.800]  Yes.
[03:54:57.800 --> 03:54:59.061]  We're going into revolution.
[03:54:59.061 --> 03:55:01.702]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff that, you know,
[03:55:02.455 --> 03:55:06.338]  Inflames people and gets people all crazy, and I don't know that's your opinion.
[03:55:06.338 --> 03:55:09.120]  Maybe it's your opinion, but there's nothing to really back that up.
[03:55:09.120 --> 03:55:09.360]  Come on.
[03:55:09.864 --> 03:55:10.524]  Are you kidding?
[03:55:10.524 --> 03:55:17.246]  I mean, how many analysts and forecasters that have been right in the past that we've interviewed from across the political spectrum?
[03:55:17.246 --> 03:55:29.489]  And when I say revolution, I mean a political revolution that may entail the Pentagon in some of their reports and the British Ministry of Defense believe they're going to be global riots by 2011.
[03:55:29.489 --> 03:55:31.229]  They issued that report three years ago.
[03:55:31.229 --> 03:55:33.190]  I mean, Alan, I don't know.
[03:55:33.190 --> 03:55:35.010]  I mean, I know you're a smart guy.
[03:55:35.010 --> 03:55:38.691]  You read a lot of mainstream newspapers and stuff, but I read government reports, Alan.
[03:55:39.693 --> 03:55:43.596]  Yeah, well, you know, that's pretty alarmist, Alex, to talk about how there's going to be a revolution.
[03:55:43.596 --> 03:55:47.218]  I mean, maybe you've got to define revolution.
[03:55:47.218 --> 03:55:50.281]  By revolution, do you mean the end of government as we know it?
[03:55:50.281 --> 03:55:57.306]  Yes, I mean, I'm talking about political realignments, depressions, breakdown in some areas of society.
[03:55:57.306 --> 03:56:01.449]  I mean, all the analysts we have on say we're really over 20% unemployment, Alan.
[03:56:02.588 --> 03:56:06.232]  Well, you know, that's not the number that's out there.
[03:56:06.232 --> 03:56:06.973]  It's 10.2%.
[03:56:06.973 --> 03:56:09.976]  You can then add the number of people who aren't even looking anymore.
[03:56:09.976 --> 03:56:11.939]  I've not heard the number 20%.
[03:56:11.939 --> 03:56:15.683]  Again, this puts you in the alarmist category when you say stuff like that.
[03:56:15.683 --> 03:56:16.884]  Well, I can say the same to you.
[03:56:16.884 --> 03:56:18.146]  Again, that's a throwaway line.
[03:56:18.146 --> 03:56:19.627]  Let's get real here.
[03:56:19.627 --> 03:56:20.769]  You're not saying that
[03:56:21.806 --> 03:56:27.409]  I mean, with your political savvy, that things are getting crazier and crazier and wilder and wilder.
[03:56:27.409 --> 03:56:31.030]  I think the anti-government crowd is getting crazier and crazier.
[03:56:31.030 --> 03:56:32.791]  There's a certain level of discontent.
[03:56:32.791 --> 03:56:34.392]  There's a big fight on the right.
[03:56:34.392 --> 03:56:38.994]  It's going to be the neocons and the crazies way on the right who support the Palins.
[03:56:38.994 --> 03:56:45.217]  You know, it's going to be sane conservatives like David Brooks or sane conservatives perhaps like
[03:56:46.238 --> 03:56:51.484]  Some of our other governors, like Pawlenty, who want nothing to do with the far right.
[03:56:51.484 --> 03:56:55.969]  Charlie Crisp being driven out of Florida by the far right is not conservative enough for them.
[03:57:00.575 --> 03:57:05.659]  Yeah, the old blue blood Republican tennis club type people, it's over for them.
[03:57:05.659 --> 03:57:10.062]  And they are the people that have helped bring this country down, Alan.
[03:57:10.062 --> 03:57:13.685]  And again, you're saying, oh, the crazy Palin's on the right.
[03:57:13.685 --> 03:57:15.706]  She's about as right wing as Mao Tse Tung.
[03:57:15.706 --> 03:57:17.788]  She can hardly read off a teleprompter.
[03:57:17.788 --> 03:57:21.411]  And again, the revolution, Alan, isn't on the right or the left.
[03:57:21.411 --> 03:57:24.573]  It's a revolution outside of that control paradigm.
[03:57:25.168 --> 03:57:28.232]  Well, I understand that, but people are calling themselves an appendage of the Tea Party.
[03:57:28.232 --> 03:57:30.034]  People are clearly, though, on the right.
[03:57:30.034 --> 03:57:31.376]  They claim otherwise.
[03:57:31.376 --> 03:57:33.699]  They claim, you know, we're not left or right, but they're right.
[03:57:33.699 --> 03:57:37.463]  They're people, probably more libertarian, but leaning right.
[03:57:37.463 --> 03:57:40.787]  Well, no, I agree with you that the largest contingent
[03:57:41.388 --> 03:57:46.512]  Since Glenn Beck took it over, is right-wing neocons.
[03:57:46.512 --> 03:57:47.733]  But we were there before.
[03:57:47.733 --> 03:57:49.014]  We're the real libertarians.
[03:57:49.014 --> 03:57:50.375]  See, we want freedom.
[03:57:50.375 --> 03:57:51.996]  We don't want a big nanny state.
[03:57:51.996 --> 03:57:53.617]  We want to be left alone.
[03:57:53.617 --> 03:58:01.182]  And if you don't think the country's going bankrupt, and they aren't building FEMA camps, and you think I'm being alarmist, let's wait and see.
[03:58:01.182 --> 03:58:02.383]  No, it's all admitted.
[03:58:02.383 --> 03:58:04.265]  Alan, you know what's gonna happen?
[03:58:04.265 --> 03:58:06.446]  Everybody's gonna see who was right.
[03:58:06.446 --> 03:58:08.027]  Yes, they will.
[03:58:08.027 --> 03:58:08.728]  In our lifetime.
[03:58:09.335 --> 03:58:15.386]  And Alan, you're very good at trying to set the parameters of the debate, but more and more people are waking up.
[03:58:17.674 --> 03:58:24.180]  Well, listen, I really appreciate you coming on your live 9 to Midnight Central across the country with your own syndicated radio show.

[03:58:27.883 --> 03:58:29.024]  And I appreciate you being with us.
[03:58:29.024 --> 03:58:29.845]  Take care, Alan Combs.
[03:58:29.845 --> 03:58:30.586]  Thank you, Alex.
