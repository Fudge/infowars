[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Jesse Peters is right.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  Fauci wants to give our children a kill shot.
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.000]  A physical attack.
[00:20.000 --> 00:22.000]  We want to give them a kill shot of truth.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  Exposing that he ran to Wulhanna Valley Bill Gates.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  He launched the attack.
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  He's the one behind it all.
[00:27.000 --> 00:29.000]  He's the one.
[00:29.000 --> 00:31.000]  Now you're going for the kill shot.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  The kill shot with an ambush, deadly.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  Because he doesn't see it coming.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  This is when you say,
[00:40.000 --> 00:48.000]  Dr. Fauci, you funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese lab.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  The same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world.
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  You know why people don't trust you, don't you?
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  Boom!
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  He is dead.
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  He is dead.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  He's done.
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.000]  Do what must be done.
[01:07.000 --> 01:09.000]  Now you do that 30 seconds.
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.000]  So you need 30 seconds.
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  Now you get that footage to us.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  You get it to Fox.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.000]  You get it to Human Events.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.000]  You get it to Bright Bar.
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.000]  You get it to Daily Caller.
[01:19.000 --> 01:20.000]  You get it to The Turning Point.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  Don't get it to him for hours.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  Imagine Tucker Carlson teases out of the A-Block.
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.000]  Coming up.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  Brave college student confronts Lord Fauci at dinner.
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  Lord Fauci, I love it.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  Exclusive footage right back.
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  Lord Biden.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  Get us that.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  That's what we want.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  That changes the whole conversation of the country.
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  I've authorized it.
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  Just make sure it's legal.
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.000]  You know, I really love
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  watching everybody imitate what we do,
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  because that's actually my goal.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  People say,
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.000]  what do you like to call people Lord Fauci?
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000]  Now they're doing it.
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  They're saying go after the globalists.
[02:03.000 --> 02:04.000]  They're saying get in their face.
[02:04.000 --> 02:05.000]  We're all the same team.
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.000]  These are tactics.
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.000]  These are great facts.
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.000]  Send it to him.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  We've gotten plenty of credit for trying to kill me
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  and put me in prison right now.
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  All I want to do is win against these people.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  But here is the video before we even started the contest
[02:17.000 --> 02:18.000]  that had me happy.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  I didn't have the contest five years ago.
[02:20.000 --> 02:21.000]  What I was saying,
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.000]  you ought to go confront them and say,
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  Bill Clinton's a rapist in FullWars.com.
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  This is the Tucker Carlson clip that caused the chamber to action.
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.000]  Waiting for this segment all morning long.
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.000]  We are rolling out the red carpet,
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  not for Tucker,
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  but for some adorable, adoptable dogs.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  So, that's what we need to do
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  is peacefully, non-violently,
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  but very aggressively in civil disobedience.
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  We'll talk with Dr. Zelinko,
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  good friend of mine, great patriot for humanity.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  In just a few minutes we're going to break.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  But we can joke and laugh about this all day.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  This is really, really, really, really serious.
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  And we now have more FDA documents that have come out
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  confirming what Dr. Yidon said a year and a half ago
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  and what Dr. Zelinko said and so much more.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  And Dr. Yidon has also come out,
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  former chief scientist at Pfizer,
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  and said this is definitely a depopulation weapon.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  Six months ago he said it looks like it may be depopulation.
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  He said now there is no doubt this is depopulation.
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  That's like Michael Jordan saying there's no doubt
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  he made the three-pointer.
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  Michael Jordan knows basketball.
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  Dr. Michael Yidon knows vaccines.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  And this is not a vaccine.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  You've got so many other scientists
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  that the inventor of mRNA technology
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  coming out in emergency warnings.
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  You notice the inventor of it was a little more tame
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.000]  about it the first year.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  Now he's like, no, it's depopulation.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  It's evil.
[04:01.000 --> 04:02.000]  We've got to stop him.
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  Just what Dr. Zelinko and I talked about
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  the time before last he came on.
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  And that was we are going to have to just come out
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  and say everything that's going down,
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  everything that's happening,
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  we've got to just admit they're killing us
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  because if we argue, oh, this doesn't work.
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.000]  Oh, the vaccine's not perfect.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  You know, why are you wrong?
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  If we do that, they keep winning.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  But that's not what's going on here.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  That's not what's happening.
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  This is premeditated plan from the beginning.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  All right.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  We're getting Dr. Zelinko hooked up right now
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.000]  and getting this camera working here.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  And we're going to go to break and come back
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  in 60 seconds with him straight ahead.
[04:42.000 --> 04:48.000]  mpholwars.com tomorrow's news today and please don't forget
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  freeworldnews.tv.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  It's the same address as Band-Aid video.
[04:51.000 --> 05:20.000]  It's just not a blocked link.
[05:21.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's the same address as Band-Aid video.
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  Only being aware of this and only rallying against it now
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  can back them off.
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  Please, ladies and gentlemen, continue to spread the word
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  about mpholwars.com and newswars.com and the live show
[05:57.000 --> 05:59.000]  because you are the modern Paul Revere's.
[05:59.000 --> 06:03.000]  Without you, we're going to lose.
[06:03.000 --> 06:06.000]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[06:06.000 --> 06:11.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[06:11.000 --> 06:16.000]  So if it's going to be used, it's better to focus on those groups
[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  who are at risk of severe disease and death,
[06:19.000 --> 06:22.000]  rather than, as we see, some countries are using
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000]  to give boosters to children, which is not right.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  So when your government scientists tell you
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  that a variant that's 0.3% different from SARS
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  could masquerade as a new virus and be a threat to your health,
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  you should know, and I'm telling you, they are lying.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  And they are.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  Why is the pharmaceutical industry making top-up vaccines?
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  They are making them.
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  You should be terrified at this point, as I am,
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  because there's absolutely no possible justification
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  for their manufacture.
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  But they're being made and the world's medicines regulators
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  have said, because they're quite similar to the original vaccines,
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  the ones that are being given now,
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  we won't be asking them to do any clinical safety studies.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  So let me just say again, the variants are not different
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  enough to represent a threat to you.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  So you do not need to top-up vaccines, yet they are being made,
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.000]  and the regulators have more or less waved them through.
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  I'm very frightened of that.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  There's no possible benign interpretation of this.
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  I believe that they're going to be used to damage your health
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  and possibly kill you, seriously.
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000]  I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  at mass depopulation.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  This will provide the tools to do it and plausible deniability
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  because they'll create another story about some sort of biological threat
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  and you'll line up and get your top-up vaccines
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  and a few months or a year or so later,
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  you'll die of some peculiar, explicable syndrome
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  and they won't be able to associate it with the top-up vaccines.
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  But that's my belief that they're lying to you about variants
[08:06.000 --> 08:12.000]  so they can make damaging top-up vaccines that you don't need at all
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  and I think they'll be used for malign purposes.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  And if you don't wake up, that's what's going to happen,
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  I think, during next year.
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  Well, that's really scary and it's true.
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  It's Dr. Michael Edon,
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  former head of the Technology Division
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  and the head scientist of respiratory viruses at Pfizer.
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  And Dr. Robert Malone is the inventor of mRNA technology.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  The first year and a half, he's like,
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  maybe they're idiots, maybe they don't know,
[08:39.000 --> 08:40.000]  but this is going to hurt a lot of people.
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  Now he's like, no, it's premeditated, it's evil, we've got to stop them
[08:43.000 --> 08:44.000]  because you cannot deny that.
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  I had Dr. Zelenko on time before last about a month ago
[08:49.000 --> 08:50.000]  and I'm not tooting our horn.
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  I'm saying we know what we're talking about.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  Please listen to us because I want to get out of this with our lives.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  I want you to get out of it as well.
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.000]  This is real.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  It's the biggest threat in the last human development.
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.000]  This is the biggest event ever.
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  You cannot debate that this is like Hitler on steroids
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  and that if we don't identify it's on purpose
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  and if we don't identify these are war criminals
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  and if we don't identify they cooked it up on purpose,
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  then they keep being able to debate us
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  and argue little fine points and keep people distracted.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  So that is not the point that we're making here.
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.000]  This is not some accidental thing.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  These aren't just companies that mean well,
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  that screwed up and all this garbage.
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  These are individuals that are using this to take over the planet
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  and it's in the great reset documents
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  and it's an incredible time to be alive.
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  So Dr. Zelenko joins us here.
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.000]  He needs no introduction.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  So much has happened.
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  He also issued an alert yesterday
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  that if something happens to him,
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  that he's not died of cancer,
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  which he's fighting right now,
[09:53.000 --> 09:54.000]  but that it can be foul play.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  I want to say the same thing.
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.000]  I'm getting a lot of death threats right now.
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  We're not being dramatic, folks.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  We're at the tip of the spear exposing mass murderers.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  This is a war.
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  And like Marshall McLuhan said 50 years ago,
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  in the future the war is going to be distributed
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.000]  to the general public.
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  It's not going to be main armies against each other.
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  So Dr. Zelenko, so much going on, so much happening.
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday broadcast.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  Hi, Alex. Thanks again for having me.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  I got a lot of questions and a lot to say
[10:22.000 --> 10:23.000]  and a lot to break down
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  and I want you to be able to take us where you want to go first.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  So take us there.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  And then I want to talk to you about Dr. Michael Yidon,
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  who I know you talk a lot about,
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  getting even more hardcore now
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  and basically aligning with what you and I are saying.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  It isn't about us being right,
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  but I think it's key to really have people face
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.000]  what we're up against.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  We have any chance of beating it.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  We're going to win.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  It's like someone who plays chess.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  The better chess player you are,
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  the more moves ahead you could see.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  And I see already that it's checkmate.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  The only question that's still a variable
[10:58.000 --> 10:59.000]  is how much carnage
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  and what will be the body count of the innocent
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  until we get to that point.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  And the reason why I'm doing these interviews
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  is that I hope that spreading the true narrative
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  and giving people hope
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  may mitigate or reduce the body count.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  And so regarding Dr. Michael Yidon,
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.000]  I know him personally.
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  He's a mentor of mine.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  He's a brilliant scientist, former vice president of Pfizer.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  And he told me personally
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  that for every one child that dies from COVID,
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  100 die from the vaccine.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  The vaccine is 100 times more lethal
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  to children than the virus.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  I think it's more than that,
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  but he has the statistics and the data analysis
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  to prove that,
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  and he has actually presented that information to the world.
[11:47.000 --> 11:48.000]  He's a man of integrity.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  He has only what to lose from coming out of retirement.
[11:52.000 --> 11:53.000]  He's a very wealthy man.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  He doesn't need all this aggravation.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  The only reason why he's doing it
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  is I believe that he's being motivated by altruism
[12:00.000 --> 12:07.000]  and a genuine desire to protect people from carnage.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  Now, I think that it's extremely important to understand
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.000]  what is the motivation behind the criminals and monsters
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  that have done this.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  And no one should believe a word I'm saying.
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  They should just listen and then do their own due diligence.
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  I provided for you resources and references
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  to what I'm about to say,
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  but much of which I'm sure you know.
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.000]  But 30 years ago, it became obvious to the people in power
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  and people who are the wealthiest,
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  most powerful people in the planet
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  that there was going to be a major catastrophe economically
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  in 30 years.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  There would be a collapse bankruptcy of the beginning,
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  a bankruptcy of social security and Medicare.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  And that's all known.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  And Biden's recent policies of increased entitlements
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  have upped the date to the anticipated collapse
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  that 2027, 2026 used to be 2028.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  That's the beginning.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  And within 10 years to be a complete bankruptcy,
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  that will have a tsunami effect on the global economy
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.000]  and threatens the stakeholders, their power and their wealth
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  and control mechanisms over humanity,
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  which they've had cultivated over millennia.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  We're talking about a force of evil
[13:37.000 --> 13:45.000]  that has always used human slavery as an asset.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  Slavery has always been the most lucrative industry
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  in the history of humanity.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  And these people are immoral.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  They're not immoral.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  They're amoral, which means they are moral
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  when it's expedient to them.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  They're immoral when it's expedient to them.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  They support the Jews when it's expedient to them.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  They support the Christians when it's useful to them.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  And then they set the Jews against the Christians
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  and vice versa when it's useful for them.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  They're capitalists when they need to be.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  They're communists when they need to be.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  This level of malevolence transcends all of these systems
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  that they have set and they play games and create chaos
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  and geopolitical destabilization
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  in order to promote their own agenda.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  In this particular case, it became obvious to everyone
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  that there was going to be a huge economic collapse
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  and they were threatened.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  What have they done?
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  They've initiated a plan over the last 30 years
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  that will result in when the system collapses
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  and the dust settles,
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  they will have the new financial infrastructure
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  and control mechanisms to lead to the ultimate enslavement
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  of humanity.
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  And let me explain.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  In 2016, everyone knows,
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  Joshua said that within 10 years, meaning by 2026,
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  right before the anticipated collapse,
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  7 billion people will be tagged with a digital tracking device,
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  essentially.
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  A biometric sensor that transmits biometric data
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  with your location to a third party.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  And it's not science fiction.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  There's a patent, which we've spoken about several times,
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  so you can watch TV,
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  so at first you'll wear it, then it will be on the skin.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  Right, that's what I'm saying there and I have that video,
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  but in addition to that there's a patent,
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  the two patents that go hand in hand.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  The one patent says that
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  current vaccines have nanotechnology in them
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  that allows them to measure your heart rate...
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  Stay right there.
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  We're going to come right back to you.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  This is riveting information.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  How does the link go?
[15:58.000 --> 15:59.000]  Please stay with us.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  History is happening now.
[16:02.000 --> 16:10.000]  As we close out the year 2021 and accelerate into the critical year of 2022, it is so important
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.560]  to really meditate on the fact and let it sink in that we are in the middle of a globalist
[16:15.560 --> 16:20.800]  world government takeover whose end game is forced the population.
[16:20.800 --> 16:27.560]  The death, the disease, the horror being caused by these GMO gene therapy shots is just the
[16:27.560 --> 16:29.280]  beginning.
[16:29.280 --> 16:34.160]  They are now accelerating a program that will collapse civilization.
[16:34.160 --> 16:36.640]  There's not much time left to turn this around.
[16:36.640 --> 16:40.560]  The globalists are now getting a big cyber attack ready that they're going to launch
[16:40.560 --> 16:45.840]  and again blame on terrorists and use as a pretext to further collapse civilization.
[16:45.840 --> 16:50.280]  Only being aware of this and only rallying against it now can back them off.
[16:50.280 --> 16:54.720]  Please ladies and gentlemen, continue to spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com
[16:54.720 --> 17:08.200]  and the live show because you are the modern Paul Revere's.
[17:08.200 --> 17:21.880]  It's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled
[17:21.880 --> 17:28.920]  and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away and I see that they're all public
[17:28.920 --> 17:51.920]  in a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled trance and I know we're being fed into this globalist being grounded and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[17:51.920 --> 17:57.680]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse.
[17:57.680 --> 18:00.000]  It's actually in the species as we know it.
[18:00.000 --> 18:05.360]  Ultimate bone broth is back and better than ever and 20% off plus free shipping and double

[18:27.640 --> 18:29.760]  and potassium for electrolytes.
[18:29.760 --> 18:35.720]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea
[18:35.720 --> 18:36.720]  salt.
[18:36.720 --> 18:39.960]  It even tastes better than the last formula and what it does for your body is simply
[18:39.960 --> 18:40.960]  amazing.
[18:40.960 --> 18:46.560]  Again it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate powder for better flavor
[18:46.560 --> 18:47.560]  and solvability.

[19:17.800 --> 19:21.640]  their globalist takeover they can shut you down.

[20:27.760 --> 20:30.920]  I didn't tell them I'm going to talk about the great reset and engineered financial collapse
[20:30.920 --> 20:35.360]  and how swabs now pre-programming is going to be a big cyber attack that they claim terrorists
[20:35.360 --> 20:38.520]  launch we know who'll really launch it and notice he just brought it up without us even
[20:38.520 --> 20:42.120]  asking because we're all synced up that's God consciousness.
[20:42.120 --> 20:43.680]  That's what scares the Satanist.
[20:43.680 --> 20:49.800]  He wrote an article titled government is the enemy.
[20:49.800 --> 20:54.960]  What is really going on by Dr. Zalinko so Dr. please continue you got caught up by the
[20:54.960 --> 21:00.600]  break getting into they know they fraudulently created all this fashion reserve banking they've
[21:00.600 --> 21:05.360]  created all these derivatives they've taken the world over by it but it's a scam so instead
[21:05.360 --> 21:09.640]  of them all going to jail they've come up with a plan to collapse the world economy poses
[21:09.640 --> 21:15.160]  the saviors and depopulate the useful cedars in the process which is what so many corrupt
[21:15.160 --> 21:19.080]  feudal lords have done in the past like the Aztecs and others when they want to feed their
[21:19.080 --> 21:27.720]  population please continue yeah so the patent that I mentioned earlier gives the technology
[21:27.720 --> 21:35.520]  and the mechanism through which Klaus Schwab's prophecy let's say about 7 billion people having
[21:35.520 --> 21:44.720]  a digital identifier that connects them to a centralized network of grid or matrix is
[21:44.720 --> 21:49.560]  going to happen and and the second patent that goes together with that is what Microsoft
[21:49.560 --> 21:58.400]  has from 2020 it's W o 2020 0606 06 and that patent describes the linkage of biometric data
[21:58.400 --> 22:03.880]  transmission to cryptocurrency and so let me explain to you what that actually means
[22:03.880 --> 22:11.320]  it means that in the future and say 2026 at time there'll be no more easy pass there'll
[22:11.320 --> 22:18.600]  be no more Apple pay there'll be no more credit cards it'll be bio match biometric transactions
[22:18.600 --> 22:26.000]  in other words you are now injected with a technology that transmits your internal temperament
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.400]  and your internal data with your location to a third party now and that will allow you
[22:31.400 --> 22:36.080]  to let's say put your hand on a scanner and then walk out from the supermarket for the
[22:36.080 --> 22:40.200]  hipsters think it's cool but the problem with that is what if I don't want to be part of
[22:40.200 --> 22:47.680]  the matrix what if I don't want to be injected with a tracking technology well then I would
[22:47.680 --> 22:52.320]  be excluded from the system of finance I won't be able to buy bread at least not probably
[22:52.320 --> 22:56.680]  on the black market but I won't be able to buy bread for my family so it's a control
[22:56.680 --> 23:03.200]  mechanism it's the mark of the beast in other words if I don't participate in the system
[23:03.200 --> 23:10.200]  that they have created and control I will be excluded from the ability to do transactions
[23:10.200 --> 23:13.920]  financial transactions so they don't have to put a bullet in my head they just have
[23:13.920 --> 23:19.960]  to prevent the mice my ability to buy food for my family and that looks like the social
[23:19.960 --> 23:24.560]  credit system in China where basically they could set a radius through which I can't go
[23:24.560 --> 23:29.200]  out of my house and put me on house arrest they know my location I step out out of my
[23:29.200 --> 23:36.000]  permitted radius let's say and they turn off my ability to do violence so this is a control
[23:36.000 --> 23:44.120]  mechanism and the entire crisis here has nothing to do with medicine has nothing to do with
[23:44.120 --> 23:48.800]  health if they're fools on this planet right now who actually think that the governing
[23:48.800 --> 23:53.880]  body is actually care about your well-being then there's no hope for you but the reality
[23:53.880 --> 24:00.000]  is that COVID-19 is a weapon of mass destruction was made in a laboratory no one denies that
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.680]  and I want to tell you something Alex I don't know if you realize that in Ralph Barrick
[24:04.680 --> 24:08.840]  Dr. Barrick was involved in every step of the development of this bio weapon and converting
[24:08.840 --> 24:15.480]  it to a human virus they took he took a bat coronavirus changed some things on it got
[24:15.480 --> 24:20.600]  a patent for it and technology to convert it to a human virus then Dr. Barrick and Zheng
[24:20.600 --> 24:26.240]  Li and Wuhan funded by the NIH they published a paper thanking the NIH figured out how to
[24:26.240 --> 24:31.000]  augment the lethality of this virus to destroy human lung tissue which was because Fauci
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.840]  wanted his HIV protein to be part of it so he could pay yes but here's something you
[24:36.840 --> 24:44.760]  may not know that in March of 2020 I came across data papers that helped me formulate
[24:44.760 --> 24:50.840]  my treatment approach based on zinc and zinc ionophores which is what the Z-stack concept
[24:50.840 --> 24:56.560]  is what I didn't realize until last week was that Ralph Barrick published that paper wow
[24:56.560 --> 25:02.520]  process that in other words the guy who made the bomb also created the antidote to diffuse
[25:02.520 --> 25:08.120]  the bomb funded by the government incredible and start over say that again that is no I
[25:08.120 --> 25:12.880]  did not know that others like this is groundbreaking explain oh my you're a big researcher that's
[25:12.880 --> 25:16.520]  how you found that these treatments nobody else had and then when you found the research
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.440]  paper it's the guy that was engineering and all out of Chapel Hill North Carolina with
[25:20.440 --> 25:26.120]  Obama with Fauci moving it this is so huge please start over and by the way on your sky
[25:26.120 --> 25:33.360]  is a link to that paper everything I'm saying I have evidence for and it should be presented
[25:33.360 --> 25:36.920]  because otherwise it won't be there we'll either put on screen we'll put it in post later
[25:36.920 --> 25:43.160]  once this is our cup please start over this is huge alright fine so Ralph Barrick in 1999
[25:43.160 --> 25:48.680]  did research at the University of Chapel Hill he uh North Carolina he was able to manipulate
[25:48.680 --> 25:55.840]  a bad animal virus a bad coronavirus converted by modulating a surface protein to infect
[25:55.840 --> 26:01.400]  human beings but it was still benign it was just infecting human beings now and then in
[26:01.400 --> 26:09.560]  2010 the same Ralph Barrick figure out a way to diffuse coronaviruses by using zinc and
[26:09.560 --> 26:15.400]  zinc ion of course inhibiting RNA dependent RNA polymerase or inhibiting a coronavirus
[26:15.400 --> 26:23.720]  replication in 2015 and by the way everything's here being funded by the United States government
[26:23.720 --> 26:28.720]  so because it's on the papers and on the peer-reviewed papers they thank the United States government
[26:28.720 --> 26:37.120]  NIH or whatever for the funding then in 2015 in in Wuhan Eric together in collaboration
[26:37.120 --> 26:43.360]  with Zhengli Dr. Zhengli the bad lady they were able to figure out a way to augment the
[26:43.360 --> 26:50.160]  payload of this weapon to destroy human lung tissue and and cause blood clots they wrote
[26:50.160 --> 26:56.600]  a paper about it they thank the NIH they published it and they got patents on it and here's another
[26:56.600 --> 27:01.840]  layer to the story the same Ralph Barrick worked with a team from Gilead Pharmaceuticals
[27:01.840 --> 27:09.560]  to make remdesivir which destroys the kidneys it doesn't help you this is so diabolical
[27:09.560 --> 27:18.640]  so every way you can see the criminal pre-planning yes and so um this is a bio weapon and they
[27:18.640 --> 27:25.560]  had the antidote for it and they suppressed the antidote intentionally not for themselves
[27:25.560 --> 27:31.440]  do you think these these masterminds want their own families to die of course not they
[27:31.440 --> 27:37.400]  themselves know this is consistent with what I knew about the executives of yeah you broke
[27:37.400 --> 27:41.400]  that a year ago then Joe Rogan confirmed it that that hundreds of members of Congress
[27:41.400 --> 27:45.920]  in Hollywood all know about this but still want to suppress that that that that your
[27:45.920 --> 27:49.880]  protocol they were using your protocol but they suppress it for the general public talk
[27:49.880 --> 27:56.440]  about evil yeah also the executives of Google I know internally that they're all taking
[27:56.440 --> 28:02.560]  hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and so this was disinformation the antidote to the
[28:02.560 --> 28:11.120]  bomb the poison was known was created by the same the same monsters but they hid it from
[28:11.120 --> 28:19.120]  you and me now when doctors like myself stumbled across these approaches because we we had
[28:19.120 --> 28:23.840]  a necessity the patients were dying and so we needed some help we needed the help we
[28:23.840 --> 28:30.200]  needed to treat the patients and so immediately anything that would help hydroxychloroquine
[28:30.200 --> 28:35.200]  then ivermectin and even the concept of early intervention putting the getting rid of this
[28:35.200 --> 28:41.840]  infection before the complications begin everything was vilified marginalized and doctors that
[28:41.840 --> 28:46.920]  were advocating for the word deplatform so then they laid out is they knew it they had
[28:46.920 --> 28:50.760]  it planned they censored it they did it all will come back with dr. Zelenko to explain
[28:50.760 --> 29:00.040]  how huge this is straight ahead please stay with us

[29:15.600 --> 29:20.160]  and at a gut level that all hell has already broken loose and it's about to get 10 times
[29:20.160 --> 29:24.920]  worse but this is the time that tries men and women souls and this is the time we're

[30:03.560 --> 30:09.360]  spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're
[30:09.360 --> 30:13.840]  doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God the creator and
[30:13.840 --> 30:20.640]  we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why I repeat that famous
[30:20.640 --> 30:27.840]  internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda
[30:27.840 --> 30:34.080]  would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and
[30:34.080 --> 30:41.200]  all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong
[30:41.200 --> 30:45.680]  and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's
[30:45.680 --> 30:49.520]  why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever because
[30:49.520 --> 30:54.160]  even if you don't believe in God what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe
[30:54.160 --> 30:59.200]  hand and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced
[30:59.200 --> 31:06.000]  in late august info wars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[31:06.000 --> 31:12.400]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[31:12.400 --> 31:18.000]  and financial collapse worldwide now ladies and gentlemen storable food has always been something
[31:18.000 --> 31:22.320]  that's important to have it's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of right along

[33:01.040 --> 33:07.040]  leading up frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[33:07.040 --> 33:28.080]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and again i would apologize for
[33:28.080 --> 33:32.800]  14 minutes ads an hour but that's the standard for talk radio and tv and i hate going to break
[33:32.800 --> 33:37.600]  without this link i was saying something so important but it's all hard it's all hard wired
[33:37.600 --> 33:42.880]  in by the satellite feeds that literally cut into the radio stations that's why the platforming off
[33:42.880 --> 33:47.840]  the main internet we stayed on air because we had over 200 radio stations and we still do we're
[33:47.840 --> 33:53.200]  very thankful to those stations but i am going to start the new year three nights a week at least
[33:53.200 --> 33:58.240]  three nights a week a multi hour commercial free podcast direct to you the viewers and listeners
[33:58.240 --> 34:02.560]  with guests and callers where i might take a break to go to the bathroom or get a cup of coffee or
[34:02.560 --> 34:06.080]  something but it's not going to have regular commercial breaks so look for that in the new
[34:06.080 --> 34:10.320]  year something i promise to do the world's so crazy we're here but doctors and lingo i know
[34:10.320 --> 34:15.120]  our listeners are smart they're awesome people but i wanted to get what you're saying you're laying out
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.680]  any grand jury it would take a few weeks to give a grand jury all this but they would definitely
[34:19.680 --> 34:25.520]  indict fousy for what you're saying you're laying out the compendium of basically how this criminal
[34:25.520 --> 34:30.000]  plan was set up and when you see how criminal it was like you were saying last time you were on
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.200]  months before the outbreak their gates and and fousy are already sending messages saying get the
[34:35.200 --> 34:40.240]  vaccine ready you're like wait they didn't make the vaccine no they own the patents to what vaccine
[34:40.240 --> 34:45.440]  they quote wanted to then be sent out to the major makers which they also got paid money from so
[34:45.440 --> 34:51.600]  the trail i think is what you're saying of them scientifically preparing this is one of the most
[34:51.600 --> 34:57.120]  open and shut premeditated murder cases ever is that what you're saying i'm saying this is the
[34:57.120 --> 35:04.160]  worst crime in human history it's a genocide it's mass murder first degree premeditated genocide
[35:04.160 --> 35:14.320]  and mass murder and it's being driven essentially by demonic um personalities that are absolutely
[35:14.320 --> 35:20.800]  obsessed with power and and and wealth but more than more than wealth i think it's power because
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.480]  once you have a hundred billion dollars let's say what's the difference if you have 150 billion
[35:24.480 --> 35:30.880]  you don't feel it but power and and being able to enslave others it fulfills the perverse
[35:31.840 --> 35:38.400]  desires of these narcissists egotists and and really i would have been called them
[35:39.200 --> 35:44.640]  satan incarnate or the embodiment of of the essence of evil and i actually want to
[35:46.000 --> 35:53.520]  you know who barbara marx hubbard was yes okay she is the demonic mother of the new world order
[35:53.520 --> 35:58.560]  she uh i hope she burns in hell for all eternity she um and i'm going to read you a few quotes from
[35:58.560 --> 36:05.840]  her that will explain to you the philosophy she's the ideology the mother of the ideology of plow
[36:05.840 --> 36:13.120]  schwaab let's say one fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social body it's a quote
[36:13.680 --> 36:22.560]  we are in charge of god selection process of planet earth he selects we destroy we are the
[36:22.560 --> 36:32.960]  riders of the pale horse death end quote another quote from her this act is as horrible as killing
[36:32.960 --> 36:41.280]  a cancer cell it must be done for the sake of the future of the whole so be it brief prepared for
[36:41.280 --> 36:48.880]  the selection process which is now beginning we the elders have been patiently waiting until the
[36:48.880 --> 36:57.760]  very last moment before the quantum transformation to take action to cut out this corrupted and
[36:57.760 --> 37:04.000]  corrupting element in the human in the body of humanity it is like watching a cancer grow
[37:04.640 --> 37:10.720]  something must be done before the whole body is destroyed the destructive one fourth must be
[37:10.720 --> 37:16.320]  eliminated from the social body i want to read you one more quote not from her from
[37:16.320 --> 37:27.920]  her name is Jacques at Pali he was the advisor to the french prime minister from 1981 till till
[37:27.920 --> 37:33.760]  in the 90s i think 1991 you wrote a book on meteron who was a big luciferian please continue
[37:35.040 --> 37:43.360]  yes so he was miteron's right-hand man and this is from a book called verbatim in 1981 now
[37:43.360 --> 37:52.080]  um the facebook fact checker uh myth uh busters or myth whatever it's called uh says that this
[37:52.080 --> 37:59.040]  isn't true but this is how i know that this this must be true the future will be about finding a
[37:59.040 --> 38:04.720]  way to reduce the population of course we will not be able to execute people or build camps
[38:05.280 --> 38:11.520]  we get rid of them by making them believe it is for their own good we'll find or cause something
[38:11.520 --> 38:19.840]  something a pandemic targeting certain people a real economic crisis or not a virus affecting
[38:19.840 --> 38:26.640]  the old or or the elderly it doesn't matter the weak and the fearful will succumb to it
[38:27.280 --> 38:34.960]  the stupid will believe in it and ask to be treated we will have taken care of having
[38:34.960 --> 38:43.200]  panned the treatment a treatment that will be the solution the selection of idiots will
[38:43.200 --> 38:52.560]  therefore be done by itself they will go to the slaughterhouse alone wow doctors let me just say
[38:52.560 --> 38:56.320]  this because this is about god consciousness and i don't say something that isn't true but it's a
[38:56.320 --> 39:01.120]  little embarrassing to say just because it's so personal you normally it takes about a week to
[39:01.120 --> 39:05.440]  get you on the show today you were able to come on i i had a dream about you last night but i
[39:05.440 --> 39:09.600]  couldn't remember the dream when i woke up when i got up i said i got to get to lincoln one today
[39:10.400 --> 39:14.320]  and then i said what was the dream about i couldn't remember and and then i just remembered
[39:14.320 --> 39:17.920]  that i said to myself well the lincoln kind of says the same thing every time he's on just like
[39:17.920 --> 39:22.640]  you do it's not an attack it's true same emergency message but i said no today's gonna be different
[39:22.640 --> 39:28.000]  and then i intended to come in here and talk about the population talk about the you and talk about
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.880]  schwaab and talk about she wasn't even by name but those same groups and then here you said it this
[39:34.880 --> 39:39.440]  is amazing and and i'm not trying to be weird about it it's just true so i feel like i should
[39:39.440 --> 39:47.040]  have said that go ahead listen truth is truth it is a certain it's in the air you know and people
[39:47.040 --> 39:53.440]  that are attuned to it um i think it's become much more accessible to anyone who wants to access and
[39:53.440 --> 39:58.000]  download this information it's not about metaphysically that there's an intuitive sense of what's
[39:58.000 --> 40:06.640]  true and what's not anyone who has some degree of sensitivity sees that this is a an attempt by
[40:06.640 --> 40:14.960]  the forces of evil to steal god consciousness and then use fear to breed um codependency
[40:14.960 --> 40:21.440]  an occult codependency on sociopaths and corrupt governments and a belief in the golden calf of
[40:21.440 --> 40:25.760]  these like false promises god knows evil's coming after us and god's opened the floodgates that's
[40:25.760 --> 40:30.560]  what i feel actually i mean my discernment's way more powerful than it used to be are you seeing
[40:30.560 --> 40:37.440]  the same thing but yeah but i see it actually in a different way that i see that god is giving every
[40:37.440 --> 40:43.440]  human being an opportunity it's like we're in the generation right before the flood of noah
[40:44.160 --> 40:51.280]  and god is saying listen repent or and get on the on the ark don't stay in the turbulent waters of
[40:51.280 --> 40:56.880]  idol worship and child sacrifice and paganism you see it's the decisions of man if you know there's
[40:56.880 --> 41:04.720]  a psychoanalyst uh let's uh i'll remember in a minute but carlyon carlyon so he wrote that the
[41:04.720 --> 41:11.120]  degradation of a society begins with the degradation a moral degradation of an individual and so you
[41:11.120 --> 41:15.920]  can learn vice versa that the moral improvement of a society begins with the refinement of the
[41:15.920 --> 41:22.800]  individual and so it's the sum total of all of our bad decisions over the last whatever period
[41:22.800 --> 41:29.440]  of time that has led to the slaughter of the unborn the the defamation and desecration of gender
[41:29.440 --> 41:38.720]  roles the desecration of what marriage is the uh perversion and poisoning of the youth through
[41:38.720 --> 41:46.160]  the public school system which teaches debauchery and normalizes the worst behavior immoral behavior
[41:46.160 --> 41:51.600]  so basically this country has drifted away from judei christian morals and and let's just keep it
[41:51.600 --> 41:58.080]  simple the ten commandment and so therefore it's not surprising to me that there comes a kind of a
[41:58.080 --> 42:03.680]  tipping point that's crossed the threshold that's been passed through collective humanity
[42:03.680 --> 42:09.520]  well god says okay now it's time for a cleaning and i think that's what we're going through and it
[42:09.520 --> 42:18.080]  may be the best result here is people repent um they return back to the you know the umbrella of
[42:18.080 --> 42:24.960]  the divine will they live a moral life they respect life the sanctity of life they respect marriage
[42:24.960 --> 42:32.560]  they respect children and the unborn and so on and that could avert a major body count however
[42:32.560 --> 42:39.440]  regardless of whether or not people are going to realize that the cleansing will happen and so
[42:39.440 --> 42:45.520]  what it's again every single individual right now is being given a choice and that choice is
[42:45.520 --> 42:50.400]  but from god and here's the question who are you going to bow down to i agree stay right there
[42:50.400 --> 42:53.920]  daughter's legal final segment talk about solutions straight ahead we'll be right back

[47:14.560 --> 47:18.800]  we're the new world order we're going to carry all this out i'll pull that quote up for you coming
[47:18.800 --> 47:22.960]  up here it's just a few minutes but i was just paraphrasing it but but doctors in lingo medical
[47:22.960 --> 47:26.400]  doctor who helped get the first treatment south to save millions of people he's here with us
[47:26.960 --> 47:34.480]  and i wanted to talk about where we're going here because everything satan does is a counterfeit
[47:35.520 --> 47:40.160]  and so satan says oh i'm gonna call the people i'm gonna make them make the decision i'm gonna make
[47:40.160 --> 47:46.080]  them decide which side they're on but then really that's god's plan it's up to us individually to
[47:46.080 --> 47:52.000]  choose not for satan to make those choices for us and here's jack basoba who's a smart guy pretty
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.320]  clear biden is only crediting trump for the vaccine to set him up to take the blame for what
[47:58.320 --> 48:04.160]  comes next i think that's a very simple neutral way to say it and now trump is rubbing it in after
[48:04.160 --> 48:08.880]  speeches in texas saying take the shot it's totally safe it totally works none of that's true
[48:08.880 --> 48:13.360]  trump says most americans dying are unvaccinated encourages everyone to get the shot
[48:13.360 --> 48:19.760]  now he loved dr zelenko's protocol help promote it i think trump just thinks doctors are trustworthy
[48:19.760 --> 48:23.760]  he hasn't heard of joseph mingola and i'm sorry i bring up a nazi analogy but it's the one that
[48:23.760 --> 48:29.360]  fits here dr zelenko i i think trump's a good person but i'm really worried about him with
[48:29.360 --> 48:36.000]  what he's doing here i think he's being set up what do you think um whatever his motivations are i
[48:36.000 --> 48:42.560]  have to publicly uh disagree with him um i think he's done a lot of good i would say the main thing
[48:42.560 --> 48:48.320]  they did that was good was move the federal judiciary toward the right with 300 more than 300
[48:48.320 --> 48:55.440]  justices that are um you know have judaeo christian values i think that that did help move the country
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.720]  the moral compass of this country but what he's talking about when it comes to these vaccines
[49:00.720 --> 49:05.520]  he really doesn't know what he's talking about or if he does and i have a real problem with him
[49:05.520 --> 49:12.320]  because um he's worried about his legacy you know he's a narcissist and and um he what he cares about
[49:12.320 --> 49:19.680]  now is his is his legacy and he went warp speed um due to political calculations this i know for a
[49:19.680 --> 49:26.080]  fact but uh he was going looking into pre-hospital treatments and emphasizing that until hydroxy
[49:26.080 --> 49:31.520]  chlorophen did became politically radioactive and then he made a calculation for this team got that
[49:31.520 --> 49:37.600]  advice in my for short that shifted him towards warp speed the vaccine development because he
[49:37.600 --> 49:42.880]  thought that was going to help him win reelection and then he went after he secured his second term
[49:42.880 --> 49:51.360]  go back to pre-hospital i was told pre-hospital uh treatment now um the the reality is that the
[49:51.360 --> 49:59.760]  vaccines um were known the side effects were known and and the FDA knew about it and uh
[49:59.760 --> 50:06.880]  uh months before they released this uh poisonous deft shot on on innocent humanity
[50:07.440 --> 50:12.400]  and when they're not you up october fda cdc documents said they knew all these things
[50:12.400 --> 50:16.960]  would happen that did happen please continue well slide number 16 yeah that's exactly what i was
[50:16.960 --> 50:23.840]  referring to and so um you know he has a choice i i still hope that he chooses the right thing
[50:23.840 --> 50:31.920]  i think that the deep state the operatives like um rick bright and janet woodcock and i have evidence
[50:31.920 --> 50:37.600]  for all that sabotage his plan when he gave an order to make hydroxy chloroquine available
[50:37.600 --> 50:43.760]  to all americans they spun it and issued an emergency use authorization that blocked access
[50:43.760 --> 50:49.760]  to patients that are not in the hospital exactly the opposite of what his intent was and that
[50:49.760 --> 50:58.000]  that killed uh 700 million exactly so how does trump extricate himself i mean how does trump
[50:58.000 --> 51:04.160]  did not be set up here well he has to recognize that uh he was sabotaged but they forget about
[51:04.160 --> 51:08.560]  him the american people were sabotaged the interests of the american people the lives
[51:08.560 --> 51:14.480]  and the sanctity of the lives our lives are desecrated and so the only position that he has
[51:14.480 --> 51:23.040]  is to backtrack and say um yes i had my intuition initially was correct the pre-hospital approach
[51:23.600 --> 51:29.520]  is the right approach and now we see the evidence of these vaccines they don't work
[51:29.520 --> 51:34.560]  and they're dangerous and most people don't need them so i'm pivoting now for the welfare
[51:34.560 --> 51:41.040]  of the of the american public and supporting proven data driven solutions and that uh
[51:41.040 --> 51:47.840]  uh forced people to go on a path of self-destruction he has to do a miocopa he has to say i'm sorry
[51:47.840 --> 51:52.640]  i made a mistake and that's okay i totally agree dr zelenko and that's what i've been saying
[51:52.640 --> 51:57.440]  because i know he got set up and sucked in but the deeper he gets sucked into this it's it's
[51:57.440 --> 52:02.560]  it's a major setup in the time we have left the rest of this segment one more short segment with you
[52:03.360 --> 52:06.960]  what do you predict for next year i mean clearly they're lining up they're saying
[52:06.960 --> 52:11.280]  trump supporters are going to launch terror attacks the cia is globalist control they're
[52:11.280 --> 52:17.680]  wanting all this they're trying to divide and conquer us along all lines in fact i was intending
[52:17.680 --> 52:21.600]  today that was on my heart to bring up how they're trying to divide christian from jew
[52:21.600 --> 52:24.960]  and to get your take but i didn't want to bring that up and then you brought it up yourself
[52:24.960 --> 52:28.800]  clearly we're all god's children we all have god consciousness if we choose it
[52:28.800 --> 52:34.640]  they're trying to play us off against each other we have to transcend that in my mind or in my spirit
[52:34.640 --> 52:39.200]  or we're going to fail because clearly they're going to use division going into the future
[52:39.200 --> 52:46.960]  along race and religion to control us listen i've been pretty savvy and i know uh listen i love
[52:46.960 --> 52:51.040]  you i like so you should know i consider your brother a lot of the some of the people that
[52:51.040 --> 52:56.480]  listen to you uh have an interesting view on jews but i i'm going to say something
[52:57.040 --> 53:04.240]  about my own religion and about my own religious institutions and uh to the anti-semites that
[53:04.240 --> 53:09.200]  are going to use these words f you okay why don't you look into your own organizations
[53:09.200 --> 53:14.480]  and religious structures and and refine them but i would say in my own religion it's the
[53:15.840 --> 53:23.040]  organizations that are the problem they've been corrupted by the serpent and have preached
[53:23.040 --> 53:29.840]  anything but god consciousness and are a coercing people uh i know synagogue you can't go into a
[53:29.840 --> 53:36.640]  synagogue unless you show proof of vaccination i mean this is the perversion of a relationship
[53:36.640 --> 53:43.360]  with the divine and so um and i see that in other religions as well but i don't want to talk about
[53:43.360 --> 53:49.440]  other religions i want to talk about my own and and i'm calling out my own people start living by
[53:49.440 --> 53:55.760]  the law and stop uh getting on your knees and sucking up to the to the corrupt government
[53:55.760 --> 54:00.800]  and and selling out the congregants and and the people that have put their trust in you
[54:01.360 --> 54:07.040]  to help them connect to god okay anyway that's my commentary on the religion and i was like oh i
[54:07.040 --> 54:11.040]  love you too because i know you have god consciousness on my spirit feels really great when i talk to
[54:11.040 --> 54:17.120]  you i love you too exactly they have groups that have been divided and manipulated and if you look
[54:17.120 --> 54:20.800]  at the the anti-jewish groups they're being manipulated if you look at the jewish supremacist
[54:20.800 --> 54:26.000]  groups they've been blended the black supremacist groups all of it's stupid there's an evil manipulating
[54:26.000 --> 54:31.200]  us against each other and we have to transcend it or it's going to win it's very simple and god's
[54:31.200 --> 54:40.640]  watching because only when we're divided and and have strife amongst us that the enemy could then
[54:40.640 --> 54:48.320]  pick us off in segment but if we are truly united by an overwhelming principle that transcends religion
[54:48.320 --> 54:53.520]  which is actually a relationship with god with the divine we're made in his image our lives of
[54:53.520 --> 54:59.360]  sanctity that's enough for me to call you a brother or sister that's it and if we unite and
[54:59.360 --> 55:05.040]  i want to tell you something no one owns god when when the messiah reveals himself and i don't
[55:05.040 --> 55:10.960]  care if it's the first second or third coming but whenever the messiah reveals himself and the truth
[55:10.960 --> 55:17.360]  of the divine is revealed i could promise you my perception of the divine will be wrong and and so
[55:17.360 --> 55:23.040]  is it will everyone else's because the essence of god is truly hidden and hopefully we will see the
[55:23.040 --> 55:29.440]  truth and understand the truth of what he is but right now we're living in the dark and we're trying
[55:29.440 --> 55:34.640]  to approximate guesstimate what he really is no i totally agree and the new world order and claus
[55:34.640 --> 55:39.600]  schwaab are afraid of the coming of the messiah everything they're doing is to stop the next level
[55:41.280 --> 55:45.040]  because it's the death of them you know darkness goes away you just turn on a little light and
[55:45.040 --> 55:50.080]  goes away and so they know that they've dug in because they're cornered animals that's when
[55:50.080 --> 55:55.040]  they become dangerous so you're asking about what else they can do next um listen i have some
[55:55.040 --> 56:01.680]  intelligence assets as you do and some of the options are pretty unpleasant whether it's another
[56:01.680 --> 56:08.560]  bioterrorism attack like the smallpox or mob or virus or other weapons of mass destruction
[56:08.560 --> 56:16.160]  and that can cause uh further destabilization and these people have no problem wasting uh wasting
[56:16.160 --> 56:23.680]  away billions of people so um but the reality is i i don't worry about that what i and i have no
[56:24.400 --> 56:29.760]  promises or guarantees to myself or to anyone else that you rise up and storm the beaches of
[56:29.760 --> 56:33.920]  normandy of this generation that you'll survive especially in the first wave there's a very good
[56:33.920 --> 56:39.840]  chance that you may fall but but so what it you know this is a finite life but you have an opportunity
[56:39.840 --> 56:44.640]  to now to to connect with the infinite then the eternal and you have to fall in battle this is
[56:44.640 --> 56:50.720]  a hill worth dying on and and and so it takes courage we grow up with some degree of freedom
[56:50.720 --> 56:55.520]  not because of us but because our parents and grandparents support for it the question is will
[56:55.520 --> 56:59.760]  our kids be free well the answer is are we ready to fight for it that we were ready no that's right
[56:59.760 --> 57:07.040]  we're living off gas they put in the tank so how about next generation our kids i i hope they
[57:07.040 --> 57:12.320]  grow up with the ability to thrive in a society of god consciousness but it depends on are we
[57:12.320 --> 57:17.200]  ready to to create the environment for that to happen stay there one more segment dr zelenko
[57:17.200 --> 57:21.600]  you're absolutely right the the catalyst this year to go to the next level we have to decide
[57:21.600 --> 57:25.200]  whether we're gonna do it or not dr zelenko is our guest we're gonna come back to the final
[57:25.200 --> 57:29.840]  second with him most powerful interview yet wow and i'm not kidding i woke up this morning i had a
[57:29.840 --> 57:32.960]  dream about him couldn't remember what it was like get zelenko on usually he can't come on
[57:32.960 --> 57:41.120]  short notice he could today so this is meant to happen we'll be right back stay with us
[57:49.680 --> 57:54.800]  let's go ahead take another call let's talk to malcom in tennessee welcome hello alex yes malcom
[57:54.800 --> 57:59.200]  all right i will make this quick and real short where the other patreons can get on the line
[57:59.200 --> 58:04.240]  alex i have to promote one thing from one of your co-host oan shroyer super male
[58:04.240 --> 58:09.920]  volatility and brain force plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank super male
[58:09.920 --> 58:15.520]  volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been
[58:15.520 --> 58:21.920]  heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions they also work quite well
[58:21.920 --> 58:26.960]  but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different
[58:26.960 --> 58:30.880]  sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling something and
[58:30.880 --> 58:36.560]  admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong that's just how it is it's how it works uh so it's always
[58:36.560 --> 58:41.520]  good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent
[58:41.520 --> 58:54.160]  price then this is it i've been fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years against the globalist
[58:54.160 --> 59:00.000]  i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[59:00.000 --> 59:05.280]  before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting
[59:05.280 --> 59:11.680]  caught flat footed but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great
[59:11.680 --> 59:16.880]  reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody

[59:21.760 --> 59:26.080]  an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally

[1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:49.600]  coming up in the next segment to deal with COVID-19 and everything that has been unfolding
[1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:58.480]  since then but i wanted to spend a few minutes here in in this segment speaking to you about
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:04.400]  what i'm going to cover in the third hour today and that deals with the january 6 committee
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:10.400]  and what's happening there and how they're trying to act like republican congress people
[1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:17.200]  sending text messages to trump saying ask the people to stop attacking the building cnn abc
[1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:24.000]  and nbc they're all saying this is proof that trump ordered an attack on the capital no most
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:29.520]  people were following him on twitter he had 80 million plus twitter followers and so people
[1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:35.280]  were telling him once it started he was speaking when it started it was going on for an hour
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:40.000]  while he spoke they started it right while he was speaking so they could claim they had provocateurs
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:45.040]  there we now know that he didn't try to help as soon as he gets off drives to the white house
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:51.920]  a few minutes away he's getting the phone calls and he then put out tweets saying be peaceful
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:58.000]  leave the building don't be there but they're acting like because his son don jr and a bunch of
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:03.360]  republican congressmen and others were telling his chief of staff hey tell the president tell
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:07.440]  people get out of the building this is really going to hurt everything we've done we want a
[1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:10.560]  10-day investigation by the senate we had the votes this is horrible
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:17.920]  which again ladies and gentlemen is the motive you don't have a motive when you're about to have
[1:02:17.920 --> 1:02:22.640]  a 10-day investigation by the senate to go attack the capital and make yourself look bad so they're
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:32.320]  trying to spin this right now they're trying to spin all of this right now as if it's proof
[1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:35.680]  so so that's what they do with every piece of information they get oh my gosh there's text
[1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:44.560]  messages uh on mark meadows the chief of staff's phone that they got that he gave them where the
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:53.360]  republicans are trying to stop everything and then they turn that around and act like oh see
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:57.680]  it's proof that trump was in command because why would you ask him to stop it if he wasn't
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:01.600]  in command that's ridiculous it's like calling the fire department to come put a fire out they
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:06.080]  didn't start the fire but you call the fire department who had a better chance to electronically
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:12.560]  tell the 600 people out of a million that were foolish enough to go inside to turn back only
[1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:20.560]  donald trump had that megaphone and it took him 30 minutes from the time he was asked to do it and
[1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:24.320]  he definitely wanted to watch it wanted to know what's happening a little bit of a slow response
[1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:29.840]  i'll i'll i'll give you that but that's it obviously he wouldn't blow his feet off obviously he
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:34.320]  wouldn't want this this this this destroyed trump at that level it totally hurt him so i'll be talking
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:40.720]  about that some more because i've gotten these subpoenas not subpoena subpoenas it's three subpoenas
[1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:50.160]  now uh from the house to me on un-american activities part two and i know that whatever i
[1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:56.080]  turn over i turn stuff over to him will be twisted and misrepresented now i got there and within
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:02.400]  five minutes of me being there and seeing flash bangs and attacks and smoke and people climbing
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:08.720]  on the capital and going in i was on top of big pallet of chairs that hadn't been you know unfolded
[1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:14.000]  yet i was up on a big pallet the highest place i could find saying get down stop come down and
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.760]  that was the five minutes it took me to get through the crowd of hundreds of thousands up closer to
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:21.840]  the capital and then our guys are trying to get cell service going what's going on well they say
[1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:26.480]  they've reached the capital that might get up get out of there don't don't do it don't don't be part
[1:04:26.480 --> 1:04:34.320]  of this mpr is running pieces so is the new york times saying that i was cowardly there commanding
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:39.360]  people to break in they're still doing that despite the video because they don't care because they're
[1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:44.800]  criminal organizations working with the great reset and claus Schwab to bring down this country
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:48.560]  all right ladies and gentlemen we have a very special surprise guest coming up next segment

[1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:38.320]  and the digestive system recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil can
[1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:44.560]  stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells
[1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:51.120]  it worked for my family and now i can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts

[1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:06.240]  the worst part of the first 15 days to flatten the curve is the first two years osi prime minister
[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:12.800]  compares the vaccinated sheep calls them good sheep helan must says i am against forcing people to
[1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:18.320]  be vaccinated not something we should do in america info wars has the article elon must person
[1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:26.800]  the year radicalized by lockdowns maybe somebody else reports fda accused of colluding with usps
[1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:31.840]  to stop and destroy packages of iver mechton mailed the patients that's now confirmed criminal
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:38.480]  beyond nuremberg crimes on the vaccinated people shouldn't reproduce declares winner
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:45.280]  fest announcer build back better a game changer for early childhood education got some news
[1:08:45.280 --> 1:08:52.880]  on that uk government refuses to reveal details about first omnicron death oh it goes on and on
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:59.040]  and on but dr lee merit joins us to cover a host of issues she's going to give us a preview of
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:03.920]  those and then dive right into them doctor thank you so much for coming back with us thanks for
[1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:09.360]  having me it's probably been six months since you were on seems like a million years so much
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:13.520]  has happened but also five seconds ago at the same time where do you want to start first
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:20.720]  i don't know we're living in such a theater of the absurd it's a target rich environment you know
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:26.720]  i mean you know your point about iver mechton keep in mind the fda has told the postal service
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:32.880]  to interdict iver mechton at the border destroy the packages this is a drug that the who has on
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:39.680]  its list of most essential drugs are you kidding me and it's and it's clearly one of the largest
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:46.960]  studies or the largest study i think was just published from brazil 220 000 adults and it decreased
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:54.160]  iver mechton decreased the risk of of going down with this by i think depth and and going to hospital
[1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:59.680]  by 50 percent so it just goes on and on i mean there's lots of people that don't think there's
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:04.560]  there's peer reviewed studies there's peer reviewed studies there's unpure reviewed studies it's
[1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:09.680]  everywhere so i mean i wish that i wish the usps would try to stop the fentanyl killing
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:13.360]  millions of people but i guess they're not going to do that a totally safe drug they're not going
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:19.440]  to let evil americans order that from outside countries even if a doctor prescribes it right
[1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:24.400]  and and i told somebody jokingly but it's actually kind of true because they can't get it anywhere
[1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:29.200]  else it's hard to order it from overseas pharmacies i've been contacted by one of them and they said
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:33.760]  all of their packages have been stopped they can't bring them in so this is confirmed multiple ways
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:38.720]  but you know we think of meals bringing cocaine across the border now you can bring iver mechton
[1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:44.320]  and probably make a fortune isn't that sad absolutely that is i mean that's a great example doc and
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:49.520]  please continue well i was going to say that it doesn't stop here i was just speaking in
[1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:56.800]  ohio in the great state of ohio doctors cannot prescribe uh azithromycin and doxycycline without
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:11:01.440]  worried about somebody looking at their license so they they don't give more than one or two days
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:07.280]  for people i said to a doctor there i said are you telling me we can't treat acne anymore with
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:13.120]  doxycycline or azithromycin for a sinus infection are you kidding me and that's where they've gone
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:19.600]  because so it isn't about the drug it's about they don't want us to save people apparently i can't
[1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:24.320]  come up with another reason why would you prohibit drugs that we've used for literally for 60 years
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:30.000]  because suddenly they've been shown to be useful for this well that's right i mean claus
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.560]  throb and milgate said they want to depopulate us and it doesn't matter what all the science shows
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:39.440]  doesn't matter what the facts show this is about these corporations through big tech and through
[1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:44.160]  the media and through agencies of government having total control so doc slow down and repeat
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:48.080]  that that's the big news and i know i've seen that in the news confirming what you're saying
[1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:54.320]  that some areas of the united states are now trying to block basic antibiotics for people that have
[1:11:54.320 --> 1:12:01.120]  lung infections i mean this is beyond criminal right and it's in ohio it was azithromycin
[1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:08.720]  and doxycycline now we've used doxycycline for a lot of things so it's a very safe drug and it's
[1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:14.800]  been used for like dermatology used it i took it multiple times for acne rosacea in my you know
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:21.680]  life come on it's not it's not a this isn't a controversial but there's a there's a hold on
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:26.480]  it now i will say this for people out there going to pharmacies this is the reason to use independent
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:30.880]  pharmacies the good news about independent pharmacies where the government's not getting
[1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:37.360]  too involved they still will they still will give out ivermectin and hydroxychloric one and
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:42.480]  these things but you go to one of the chains and they've been told from on high not to prescribe
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:50.240]  but even in states like mine uh where i practice where uh there's no prohibition on using ivermectin
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:56.880]  so time to support your local pharmacies that's a big deal right now and again it's claus schwaub
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:02.160]  and bill gates and the un whenever medical doctors are us senators who are medical doctors like
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:07.600]  ran paul try to give a speech about natural immunity being 27 times better than this fizer shot
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:12.960]  they censor him on google and youtube and the senate just puts up with that i mean imagine
[1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:18.160]  the level of this control of telling doctors what they can prescribe and telling senators what they
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:28.560]  can say yeah i mean the censorship isn't science and so we need to realize that it's been you know
[1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:33.280]  i i started reading more about the tab of stock than about medicine these days because what we're
[1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:39.280]  dealing with is a huge mass mind control propaganda outbreak we're not really dealing with a viral
[1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:44.960]  outbreak it's it's taking us down it's been acting we've been we've been under the the
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:48.880]  impression that we could speak freely about medicine for a long time but it turns out it
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:54.400]  hasn't been true for a long time the the notion i'll just point out that one of the couple things
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:14:01.680]  got us here one was obamacare which made it so difficult for private physicians to act you know
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:06.560]  as independent physicians that because of all the regulation that they sold out to hospital so now
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:11.280]  when it was seven before that seventy some percent of doctors were independent
[1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:15.840]  now they all work for hospitals and the hospitals are controlled but the other thing that we've
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:20.960]  been victim of is this idea that the only thing to listen to we've taught all the new new medical
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:26.240]  students and everybody the only thing we can listen to is a 30-year double blind peer reviewed
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:33.200]  study you know peer review is the Politburo attached to medicine and science you have three or five
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:40.720]  people on the top of some journal i have my own experience with this in in my profession and they
[1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:45.920]  decide whether or not something gets published or not now admittedly there should be some kind of
[1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:51.760]  screening for some quality of you know language or whatever but when you have a few people that
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:56.320]  decides on the basis of for example i had at one time i had a publication that was submitted and
[1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:00.320]  the response i got from one of the reviewers was everyone knows you can't do this it was
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:05.280]  about a surgical procedure but i thought that was a funny review after i spent a lot of time and
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:11.120]  money and energy putting together a very quality paper everyone knows you can't do this um if you
[1:15:11.120 --> 1:15:16.880]  don't follow the narrative then the peer reviewers don't publish and if and the narrative can be
[1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:22.800]  controlled by funding the peer reviewers that's pretty easy you know look at what Pfizer if you
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:28.240]  probably seen that video that all these news reports funded by Pfizer you know brought to you by
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:33.360]  Pfizer it's just on and on so that's a total conflict of interest on its face but they just
[1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:37.360]  ignore that now dr. merit stay there we're going to come back in the next segment and and speaking
[1:15:37.360 --> 1:15:43.520]  of them manipulating uh reviews and studies we now know that Pfizer did indeed do that and they
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:49.120]  tried to block and now they want 75 years till it gets released but the first uh group of that
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:54.320]  or tranche came out and it was confirming everything you and others warned about over a year ago we'll
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:16:02.240]  be right back with dr. lee merit stay with us it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had
[1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:07.840]  satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:13.040]  the different studies reports about my nasa and other governments other agencies they all disagree
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:19.200]  once really happened with the climate the only constant the only great truth is change is the
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:25.360]  only constant so yes climate change is totally real but notice first they called it global freezing
[1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:29.120]  back in the 70s 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't really happen the
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:34.240]  way they wanted to okay now it's just climate change but did you know that man-made climate change
[1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:40.480]  is a real thing when it comes to the united nations and the department of energy and bill
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:46.480]  gates and the un they have weather control trees from 1979 and bill gates has been manipulating
[1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:51.920]  the weather for a very long time in fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel prize for an idea
[1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:56.480]  of spring different particles out of jet engines to control the weather so yes man-made climate

[1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:18.400]  that we are in the middle of a globalist world government takeover whose end game is forced
[1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:25.200]  the population the death the disease the horror being caused by these gmo gene therapy shots

[1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:23.520]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones all right dr. lee merit is our guest
[1:20:23.520 --> 1:20:28.880]  here and i really appreciate coming on the alex jones show on this tuesday december 14th broadcast
[1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:33.600]  and it reminded me of why i think she's one of the most articulate best people we've got out there
[1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:38.640]  fighting this tyranny is she goes to the big picture and i wanted to get the nuts and bolts of
[1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:43.840]  where we are and what's coming next and omnicron and the rest of it but but you talked about tabas
[1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:49.520]  talk institute but those that don't know mi6 connected behavioral psychology outfit and the
[1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:54.480]  fact that they admit they hired militaries around the world with the tabas talk institute to engage
[1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:59.520]  in fear mongering and even use terms like rain washing this isn't our opinion this is mk ultra
[1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:04.800]  stuff on the mass scale and so you're a medical doctor speaking about that what is the big picture
[1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:10.960]  and and is it the way to beat this not to argue every point of their lies and you every new variant
[1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:16.880]  but to argue uh the fact of their using this for their global government takeover the build back
[1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:24.080]  better great reset i think so you can get down in the weeds and then you get lost and i think the
[1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:30.240]  point here is i mean just look just looking at these variants the guy without being prejudiced
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:36.000]  and confused by an inadequate medical or scientific education that we were all given you just look at
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.760]  this and you say is this really crazy i mean come on can they make up this sounds like a made up
[1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:47.040]  story we've got all these countries that are highly vaccinated that are having the highest
[1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:52.400]  rate of outbreak on the other on the other hand the lowest countries like they come out with a news
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:57.840]  story saying um south africa surprisingly low number of cases even though they only have six
[1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:03.360]  percent people people vaccinated or something like that i mean the average guy would would make the
[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:09.360]  conclusion that if more vaccination means more disease then maybe we should stop vaccinating
[1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:15.840]  that the vaccine may be causing the disease but no we have to come out with variants i mean it's
[1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:22.720]  just too it's just too obvious it you can't make this stuff up as they've thought this out i will
[1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:27.760]  tell you the other thing i looked at i looked at the 1918 history of the pandemic back then
[1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:33.120]  and you know there were really four things that that happened then and most people don't realize
[1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:39.120]  this i was never taught this in medical school that they could not prove transmission of influenza
[1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:45.760]  you know we've we've had all this stuff come out now that just makes it you realize that there's
[1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:50.000]  i'm not saying there's nothing there there's something that's killing people but there is a huge
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:57.760]  psychological operation that's that's that's driving kind of overlay over that and we and even
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:23:02.720]  when you look at what's killing people we don't know a lot about it why we've been told not to
[1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:07.840]  do autopsies there are very few autopsies out there i pulled all the autopsies i could find
[1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:13.600]  since last year and there were 74 from around the world of covid deaths and you know they're
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:18.160]  telling us we have a horrible virus that's giving us this viral pneumonia we're dying right guess what
[1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:24.720]  the one diagnosis is i didn't find in any of those autopsies viral pneumonia you would think it would
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:31.280]  be there no but the one thing that is there is microvascular clotting in every one so something
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:36.720]  is happening we've been prohibited from scientifically evaluating it we've been prohibited from treating
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:43.600]  it correctly we've been censored i mean does that sound like a nation or a medical system that really
[1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:49.120]  wants to help us figure this out and treat people oh i should i should meant they're they're killing
[1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:54.640]  people with protocols that they don't change in the in the icu that's right they know sending sick
[1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:59.680]  people to nursing homes kills they know put people on innovators and not giving them any type of
[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:05.520]  treatment kills them and they still are doing it now is prepared to enter year three right and and
[1:24:05.520 --> 1:24:12.080]  listen to what michael yedden just said about the medazolam in his mind uh the medazolam and i
[1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:16.720]  i can't check all the things he has at his you know he's but it's on record it makes you or you
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:22.640]  can't breathe that's an assisted suicide drug right the medazolam and the his point was they
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:29.440]  stockpiled it before 2020 and then they strategically released it and started using it at a time to
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:33.280]  boost the death numbers that's right this is a giant so what you're getting at is it's what claus
[1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:37.680]  robin bill gates want depopulation and and this is their rollout the murder of western medicine the
[1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:42.400]  murder of logic the murder of free speech getting all their minions in place purging the military
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:47.520]  and police and in hospitals of people that'll ask questions before they roll out something far
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:54.000]  deadlier that's if i war game it that's the main scenario i see dr right it's and it's fear that's
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:59.280]  driving people to do things they would not do in a normal situation i mean look most people
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:04.800]  would have researched back this vaccine that was experiment when the word experimental came out
[1:25:04.800 --> 1:25:08.240]  that should have said it should have been a red flag oh maybe i should wait and not be the first
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:14.240]  person on the block to get this but that isn't what happened people that i respect that are smart
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:19.680]  intelligent people that would have looked at car facts before buying a used car ran out and got a
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:25.440]  vaccine that's never been with a new technology never really made it through animal testing
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:31.600]  completely uh unknown elements in the vaccine even your doctors don't know what's in it because
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:36.320]  they don't have to tell us under emergency use authorization and they went out and got this
[1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:40.240]  and here's the point that i've been making to people about this vaccine
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:46.880]  what we call a vaccine i shouldn't even use that term because a vaccine by law by technical terms
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:53.680]  is supposed to decrease transmission okay they've agreed this doesn't decrease transmission
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:59.120]  it just may on in the eway it may decrease symptoms a bit well that's a therapeutic agent
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:05.040]  that's not able to be mandated in any real i mean that would be like mandating a blood pressure
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:11.040]  medicine rather than another one you can't do that and so they've missed they've mislabeled things
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:16.640]  they've lied to us about these things and at the end of time people went out and they were so afraid
[1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:21.280]  by all the confusion and the isolation everything that happening that they took this vaccine without
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:27.040]  really knowing much about it and now we have numbers coming out that as we some of us predicted
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:31.040]  are not good numbers well that's what i was about to say what we're having a massive more numbers
[1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:35.360]  of deaths the hospitals this year actually full they weren't last year and they admitted the
[1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:39.760]  german and british news they even hide it that you're twice as likely in the hospital or die
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:43.840]  if you've had the shot and their answer is more shots even though they don't protect you i mean
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:50.640]  this is crazy right it it's again you know if people weren't afraid i think they would look
[1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:57.040]  at this more more realistically but they're being afraid and part of it is of course the non-stop
[1:26:57.040 --> 1:27:02.240]  propaganda on television that doesn't tell you in the mainstream media that doesn't tell you the
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:06.320]  truth about this so is it this really an IQ test the globalist clan they want to get rid of dumb
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:14.160]  people i don't agree with doing that but this really is a darwin awards here well some of the
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:17.920]  smartest people i know ran out and got this i mean it's hard to believe but they sure understand
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:21.760]  they go under stock on syndrome plus the children don't deserve this the children don't deserve
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:27.200]  yeah and that's the that's the point about the tavastock institute in mass mind control
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:32.160]  this is a scientific study they know how to do this they know how to push our buttons and make
[1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:37.440]  normal people not be acting normally i really think that's what's that's a major component here
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:42.960]  and i the other the other the other thing i always worry about is that as we're looking one
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:46.880]  direction what are they doing the other direction that's the other thing it's it's and that's the
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:50.160]  reason i want to get you on in the longer segments coming up it's starting out doctor
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:55.760]  exactly you're a smart lady big picture what are you expecting them to pull next
[1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:00.960]  well i think they're already pulling it i'm starting to see people
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:07.920]  that are younger people that are getting sick with something okay and but if you look at the
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:14.880]  at what we know about for example electromagnetic frequency toxicity it's indistinguishable from
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:20.800]  covid from what they call covid the idea we you know the idea is we don't have a nice little
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:24.960]  virus we're being told there's a virus we're being told it's airborne we're being told a lot of
[1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:31.120]  things that are not proven but we do know something about electromagnetic frequency and the history
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:38.320]  behind the pandemic of 1918 various flu pandemics in the past um that's right we know when new type
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:42.880]  of radiations are released it's that at first our bodies aren't used to it plagues are connected
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:47.600]  to that and now you're talking about major studies when we come back that just broke this week major
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:53.840]  studies by prestigious groups confirming that 5g radiation is causing symptoms identical
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:57.520]  to covid 19 and this is not a conspiracy theory this is proven stay with us
[1:29:00.160 --> 1:29:08.240]  cover commander here with an important message to humanity i have decided that all of you will

[1:34:55.040 --> 1:35:02.800]  5g exacerbated covet that just broke and you were going there doctor please continue well yeah we
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:09.520]  know how this works i mean it's not that we haven't looked at the science what happens and what happens
[1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:16.560]  is when you're in an electromagnetic field um you you actually your metabolism depends on
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:21.760]  your being able to have an electron transport chain in your mitochondria the mitochondria the
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:28.160]  little parts of your cells that they're like your furnaces they would produce power from from food
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:33.920]  and when you disrupt that electron chain ever so slightly you disrupt your ability to optimize
[1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:39.840]  metabolize optimally metabolize food and that's essentially what happens if you're toxic from
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:45.840]  radio frequency radiation non-ionizing radiation now it's interesting that when you go back to
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:51.360]  and i have my family is filled with electrical engineers and they they all think i'm a little
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:56.160]  nuts because they're working in the macro environment but it's true that might we're
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:02.560]  dealing with microcurrents and nano you know very very small currents that are going through
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:08.800]  that are causing this it's not it doesn't take a lot in 1918 that's very interesting i mentioned
[1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:15.920]  earlier they never proved transmission of the of flu they tried i mean they did even things like
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:21.280]  taking and i apologize the term snot but that's but not a technical medical term but you know what
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:25.520]  it is the goober's from your nose and your lungs and they they they put it into healthy people they
[1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:31.440]  couldn't get them sick they also literally spun that stuff down tried to purify it essentially
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:35.840]  make it so if there were a small particle in there and be concentrated and injected it into
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:40.480]  volunteers and they didn't get the flu horses came down with this but they couldn't they couldn't be
[1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:46.080]  they couldn't transmit it from horse to horse so what was going on well it's interesting that we
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:51.120]  call it the spanish flu why do we do that because it didn't start in spain it started in fort riley
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:57.040]  kansas and what was happening there well we were training a group of army guys to go overseas
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:02.000]  and among those were telegraphers the people that are learning to do morse code and it was
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:08.240]  the first time that humans were really around interrupted electrical signals alternating
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:15.040]  currents and what happened is even before that we had not we called it telegraphers disease telegram
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:19.600]  operators as soon as the lines went up started getting sick not necessarily dying but they were
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:26.160]  getting sick around the the world and so in 1918 four things came together we had the telegraphers
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:31.520]  being trained in fort riley kansas it's the first time that we gave our military a battery of
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:38.880]  vaccines before they went overseas we had a drug that was being given inappropriately it was called
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:44.320]  aspirin and the bayer at aspirin had lost their patent and were convincing doctors through the
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:49.600]  am a to use it whenever there was a fever and then we have a lot of these memory books from 1918
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:55.200]  that show doctors just public you know pushing handfuls of aspirin into these young recruits
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:38:01.600]  that were sick with the the so-called flu well in the ultimately we sent out a pathologist
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:07.200]  william welts from the arm forces institute pathology who did an autopsy on these people in 1918
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:12.800]  and what he found was bloody lungs that they were bleeding into their lungs again inflammation
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:18.480]  and aspirin overdose explains some of this a lot of people died but it's interesting who it was and
[1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:23.120]  what and then when it went overseas think what we also did we also vaccinated our overseas people
[1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:32.960]  and we we took over the telegram and ways to do high high volume signaling with this thing so we
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:36.640]  get it across the english channel to france etc so and dr. medic let me just back up what you're
[1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:39.840]  saying because i've been studying this long before this even happened i know you have
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:44.320]  and this is mainline medical research what you're saying isn't like something kooks came up with
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:49.280]  then here's the difference they argue well the sun is this giant electromagnetic microwave
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:54.240]  show why are you well we but but it comes up gradually it goes down gradually and it's based
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:59.760]  on when we go to bed when we get up we got a habit in our skin to live and yet gives us cancer
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:03.600]  actually in the end so we needed to live but it also kills us it's what makes the plants grow
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:08.480]  we're in a high level of electromagnetic radiation but what i've read from the studies is
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:13.360]  they've done this with ants with birds and with plants with just the regular cell towers that are
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:17.760]  again are the longer wavelengths and of course up closer really deadly just like the small ones
[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:23.440]  it's not debatable you can type in 5g in cancer and you've got wired magazine articles five years
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:27.920]  ago with prestigious you know scientists saying yeah massive increase in cancer it's that it's
[1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:34.480]  flicking on and off it's constantly oscillating and and so your body at a level is electrochemically
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:39.840]  giving itself orders it also gets that influx from the universe so there's more crimes and stuff with
[1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:44.320]  the moon so we're getting a more electromagnetic radiation at night we're not used to and so it's
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:50.960]  the constant billions of changes an hour just all these different fields all of this then causing
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:55.840]  issues inside the cells then you add a new pathogen to that and it can cause all sorts of
[1:39:55.840 --> 1:40:01.600]  strange mutations that's my laypersons read is that accurate i think that's pretty close the the
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:07.280]  you know the the um the i can's law of the body we learned in medical school it says the body
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:13.440]  responds to rate of change so if something is gentle and it starts slowly you can adapt to it
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:18.000]  to some degree but you're right when it keeps flicking on and off it's hard and that's what
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:22.640]  happened when you bring up the sun you know most people don't realize that before the telegram lines
[1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:28.480]  were laid we didn't have seasonal influenza influenza was something that had a worldwide
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:33.600]  outburst influenza comes from the word to influence it nobody knew what it was for from
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:40.000]  but they knew that periodically uh in the you know back into the 1500s and 1700s these boom
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:45.520]  they'd be an outbreak all around the world and then it would be absent for decades and then
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:49.680]  what happened again and it turned out a very smart astronomer i think from winnipeg looked back at
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:55.200]  this and said it correlates with sunspot activity and so it war so to wars i mean i mean like even
[1:40:55.200 --> 1:41:00.400]  bang capital uh goldman sacks they're all obsessed with sunspots in their own literature they know
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:06.480]  this is real yeah so so there's a lot of things happening here and so i don't believe it's all
[1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:10.800]  psychologic operation i personally think we've we've even the mainstream media has come to the
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:16.960]  belief that the spike protein was manipulated it's genetic material taken from nature taken into
[1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:22.640]  labs manipulated to harm people so by definition that's a bio weapon now keep in mind if that's a
[1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:27.920]  bio weapon when your body produces the same spike protein haven't been giving these this RNA or DNA
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:33.760]  vaccine it's also a bio weapon i totally agree dr merit so what do you think they're really doing
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:38.240]  because obviously multiple injections was always pre-planned they admitted so now they say it's
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:42.400]  permanent you were on the you know years ago saying that was going to come this is clearly a
[1:41:42.400 --> 1:41:48.240]  plan now we now know that where's the plan go i think it goes i think the 5g is part of the end
[1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:54.960]  game i really do i think that they're distracting us with all the everything else and quite frankly
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:42:01.120]  i feel confident that we are going to master the disease process right now we could be saving a lot
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:06.320]  more people if we if people would put things in their homes like nebulizers pulse oximeters
[1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:11.280]  stock up on ivermectin that they won't let us do stock up on these things we could probably solve
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:16.400]  90 percent of this or more we always are going to have disease among humans but i'm angry they're
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:20.640]  trying to stop us fixing the problem yeah but they're trying to stop us fixing the problem
[1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:25.520]  while we're so concentrated on this what else is going on i can't prove this they're making
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:29.440]  what else is going on they're putting the 5g in they're collapsing the borders they're destroying
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:35.440]  the dollar they're getting ready for the cyber attack yeah activating this and i've heard uh you
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:41.680]  know uh a friend of mine who's a researcher was sent some video from china that claimed that the
[1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:47.440]  chinese uh it's a it's a leak apparently i've got it on my telegram she's got it on hers uh linfin
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:54.400]  it it it's chinese talking about how uh their goal is to vaccinate all our military and then
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:59.520]  they won no that's right we'll we'll talk about that when we come back stay with us rarely in life

[1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:29.360]  so she can really roll and go through all this you know i got dr peter mccullough on joe rogan
[1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:33.120]  and they're saying that's going to be his biggest interview yet it may even break records that i
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:38.160]  said and that elon must set to be the number one podcast he's ever done it's over 20 million people
[1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:44.160]  just on one platform so far 40 million total as of last night so that's very exciting news and
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:49.440]  joe rogan kept asking him why are they doing this and dr mccullough doesn't want to go that extra
[1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:54.480]  mile i get it he's a doctor he's a he's been an fda scientist he doesn't want to speculate but this
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:48:00.800]  is political at the end of the day it's about a takeover it's about depopulation so dr lee marrett
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:05.440]  i want to thank you so much for being here with us today i've got a few more questions for you
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:09.840]  and again please come back on a commercial free show because an hour is then uninterrupted
[1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:13.440]  but but what else do you want to impart to the listeners and viewers of the show
[1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:20.320]  well you know jade grover one time said that the individual's handicap by coming face to
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:25.520]  face with a conspiracy so monsters that he cannot believe it exists that's part of what's
[1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:31.920]  happening here the biggest lie we've ever been involved with and it's engendering fear and fear
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:37.520]  is the that's what's going to take us down so i think there there are really four things we need
[1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:42.720]  to do to get out of this the first thing is people need to turn off their tv and movies
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:48.320]  because it's used for predictive programming and to an outright propaganda it really is i mean you
[1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:52.720]  cannot you cannot look at the numbers scientifically and then look at what they're telling you and make
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:59.600]  any sense of it um and everybody needs to get into this fight now because first of all purpose in
[1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:05.120]  life is a great antidote to fear but next the second point is is that when five g's fully
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:10.720]  implemented if that really is the point um it's a directed energy weapon that's what it was designed
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:16.400]  for and we're going to have to take this on we can't just sit by because it will it will come
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:22.720]  into our homes um and by the way we found a bunch of cia documents we covered my reset wars piece
[1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:26.320]  where they were admitting decades ago they were going to put up towers for mind control
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:30.720]  to control the populace of course that's the logical extension of control freak bureaucrats
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:37.920]  and mad scientist given unlimited power yeah i mean you know this was five g was used for a
[1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:43.200]  directed energy weapon and it was a denial of access weapon in places like iraq you turn on
[1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:48.400]  five g you turn up the power you hit the right frequency and it resonates with everybody's
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:53.040]  hair follicles so it makes you feel like you're completely on fire well that's the next thing
[1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:59.040]  everybody's talking about their hair falling out in the five g areas yeah i don't know what to make
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:05.040]  of that i've i've i've that's been a problem i i think uh what happens is it can be from being
[1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:10.240]  just from being sick can do it but i agree with you that there is a lot of suspicious things another
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:15.360]  one um pink urine believe it or not that's one of the things it turns out people that are more
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:22.800]  sensitive to electrical magnetic frequency toxicity have a have a defect in their porphyrin
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:29.200]  manufacturing what makes hemoglobin and one of the ways it shows up is you have pink urine sometimes
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:35.600]  so by the way it shows like better call sol the rest of it make fun of people that talk about this
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:41.280]  but you can type in cell phone towers or five g cancer and get prestigious reports going back
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:46.080]  decades what we're talking about is not debatable i mean the fact is what is in your cell phone is
[1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:51.680]  the same thing in a microwave oven the difference is a microwave oven is shielded right and it's
[1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:56.400]  not completely shielded right that's why they tell you to be careful when you've got uh pacemakers
[1:50:56.400 --> 1:50:59.760]  and what are they telling you with the new iphone be careful if you don't buy one if you have a new
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:06.640]  pacemaker um yeah neurosurgeons know about this and they the same you know who controls you when
[1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:12.720]  you know whom you cannot criticize and the telecommunications industry has the same uh
[1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:19.120]  indemnity from lawsuit that the vaccine industry does and anybody and that's the point every time
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:25.440]  you know i've been in medicine for 45 years uh i've actually been instrumental in taking a drug
[1:51:25.440 --> 1:51:31.680]  off the market that was not a good drug nobody nobody when you know and when vioxx came out
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:35.760]  after three weeks i recognized it wasn't a good drug it took the fd three years to take it off
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:41.520]  but when i started speaking against vioxx nobody said oh that's one of those crazy
[1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:47.120]  cox two inhibitor you know non blah blah blah no but you you don't like one vaccine and suddenly
[1:51:47.120 --> 1:51:53.520]  you're an anti-vaxxer and you know you're a tinfoil hat if you speak against 5g i i think that we
[1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:58.480]  see a pattern here the answer is not to argue the science the answer is to demonize the people
[1:51:58.480 --> 1:52:06.560]  speaking out and this one everybody better wake up to because it's not by accident that this is
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:11.760]  happening all together i think um it's it should tell you something i think it's in hypha israel
[1:52:11.760 --> 1:52:18.320]  that the uh wherever technion is i think it's hypha but they've they've gotten the wi-fi out of their
[1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:23.680]  schools why did they do that because they realized just what you were showing on that that graph
[1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:31.120]  that children's body mass makes them more susceptible to damage from wi-fi and so they
[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:35.440]  hardwired their schools i read that and i went home and told my husband we had a hardwire house
[1:52:36.480 --> 1:52:40.480]  you know i had my house totally hardwired and and then you know you catch family members
[1:52:40.480 --> 1:52:46.080]  hiding wireless transmitters doing it absolutely i mean we have the answer it's called wiring things
[1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:50.880]  like in a gun a gun has a tube you fire at one place you don't have it where it explodes in all
[1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:58.080]  directions we need directed energy not directed energy at us right and i hope my husband is an
[1:52:58.080 --> 1:53:04.000]  it guys listening to this because i had the same issue family members hide these and i went around
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:09.600]  unfortunately the 5g you cannot test with meters at this point but you can test the lesser uh
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:15.280]  cellular frequencies and it turned out that you know when you go around i i i kept saying there's
[1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:20.000]  there's gotta be something under my chair where my office is because this and i found it was a
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:23.760]  router that we had stacked oh listen when i was when my ex-wife was divorcing me i had to live
[1:53:23.760 --> 1:53:28.880]  in a condo for a while it was this big high rise and i'm not a person that's paranoid i'm not a
[1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:34.000]  person that like has trouble sleeping and i couldn't sleep in this room so when i slept in another
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:38.080]  room i could i've always slept good and i finally realized it was a giant wireless router in the
[1:53:38.080 --> 1:53:42.720]  closet right behind the bed turned that sucker off had him hardwire it slept great for the two
[1:53:42.720 --> 1:53:46.960]  years i lived there but i mean if something's messed up my sleep up i know something's going on
[1:53:46.960 --> 1:53:50.560]  and it's because it's flicking on and off and it's sending a charge through my brain and yeah
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:54.720]  it's a lot weaker than a microwave or whatever but the point is doesn't matter my brain picks up a new
[1:53:54.720 --> 1:54:01.360]  wave coming through and that's what's happening yeah and i i've been treating people um this last
[1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:07.200]  year with ivermectin the various different things for presumed covid that we don't completely have
[1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:13.360]  our heads wrapped around what it is but it kind of died out in the summer and we could and but
[1:54:13.360 --> 1:54:19.360]  before the even the cold weather hit it came back and suddenly i was getting calls and i finally
[1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:25.440]  asked somebody i said because this person did have pink here and i said if you think there's 5g
[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:30.000]  that's gone around by your your area because i'm getting a lot of calls in that area and that's
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:34.480]  exactly that had happened and it had actually we had been sick in the office the same thing in
[1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:38.640]  wuhan i'm starting to rub it i mean wuhan all the main places it broke out was where the 5g was
[1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:46.400]  institute and in that hospital where dr lee died it had been completely wife in 5g wi-fi yeah that
[1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:53.040]  and and lombardi i understand and also new york city now they're not the only cities but um apparently
[1:54:53.040 --> 1:54:58.800]  it's a it's a pretty good match i'm just the problem with 5g too that people need to understand is
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:04.880]  um it's not like 2g and 3g it's 4g it makes it sound like there's just a continuum now we just
[1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:10.640]  know it's a totally new technology super small high powered wavelengths and it's intermittent
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:16.720]  like you said it's not we live in a little cloud of 2g or 3g or 4g that was okay to a certain degree
[1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:22.080]  it it was somewhat harmful but we we were able to adapt to it but when you have something like this
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:28.800]  that comes in bursts all the time is hard for the body to adapt exactly all right well dr
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:33.200]  merritt incredible job will you promise i know it lots going on but the next few months let's do

[1:59:02.240 --> 1:59:07.120]  the united states to brazil and of course triggered by the bricks in the uk nations were pulling out
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:12.480]  of the private corporate fastest world government that's why they launched their great reset and
[1:59:12.480 --> 1:59:19.120]  their program after collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a top down
[1:59:19.760 --> 1:59:24.880]  vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because we
[1:59:24.880 --> 1:59:30.080]  wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win
[1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:37.120]  they released a biological weapon on us now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20
