[00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.666]  Jesse Peters is right.
[00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.967]  Fauci wants to give our children a kill shot.
[00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:19.967]  A physical attack.
[00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:22.048]  We want to give him a kill shot of truth.
[00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:23.968]  Supposing that he ran the Wuhan lab with Bill Gates.
[00:00:23.968 --> 00:00:25.368]  He launched the attack.
[00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:27.329]  He's the one behind it all.
[00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.390]  He's the one.
[00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.570]  Now you're going for the kill shot.
[00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.571]  The kill shot, with an ambush, deadly.
[00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.352]  Because he doesn't see it coming.
[00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:41.273]  This is when you say, Dr. Fauci,
[00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:48.891]  You funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese lab.
[00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:53.975]  The same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world.
[00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:57.458]  You know why people don't trust you, don't you?
[00:00:57.458 --> 00:00:59.800]  Boom!
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.802]  He is dead!
[00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:04.244]  He is dead!
[00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:04.805]  He's done!
[00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:06.885]  Do what must be done.
[00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:08.926]  You do that in 30 seconds.
[00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:10.526]  That's all you need.
[00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:11.706]  30 seconds.
[00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:20.248]  Now you get that footage to us, you get it to Fox, you get it to Human Events, you get it to Breitbart, you get it to Daily Caller, you get it through the Turning Point Pipeline.
[00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:22.089]  You don't get it to InfoWars.
[00:01:22.089 --> 00:01:27.770]  Imagine Tucker Carlson teases out of the A Block, coming up.
[00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.611]  Brave college student confronts Lord Fauci at dinner.
[00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.291]  Lord Fauci, I love it.
[00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:36.534]  Exclusive footage, right back.
[00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:38.136]  Lord Biden.
[00:01:38.136 --> 00:01:39.877]  Get us that!
[00:01:39.877 --> 00:01:41.299]  That's what we want.
[00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.186]  That changes the whole conversation of the country.
[00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:50.509]  I've authorized it.
[00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.532]  Just make sure it's legal.
[00:01:53.532 --> 00:01:54.693]  You know, I really love
[00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.438]  Watching everybody imitate what we do, because that's actually my goal.
[00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:00.839]  People say, what do you like to call people?
[00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:01.460]  Lord Fauci?
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.380]  Now they're doing it.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.561]  They're saying, go after the globalists.
[00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:04.962]  They're saying, get in their face.
[00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:05.843]  We're all the same team.
[00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:06.464]  These are tactics.
[00:02:06.464 --> 00:02:07.144]  These are great tactics.
[00:02:07.144 --> 00:02:09.026]  Send it to him.
[00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:12.569]  We've gotten plenty of credit for trying to kill me and put me in prison right now.
[00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.311]  All I want to do is win against these people.
[00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:18.333]  But here is the video before we even started the contest that had me happy.
[00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.795]  I did the contest five years ago.
[00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:23.858]  What I was saying, you ought to go confront them and say, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:02:23.858 --> 00:02:24.538]  Infowars.com.
[00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:29.028]  This is the Tucker Carlson clip that caused the chain reaction.
[00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:58.294]  So, that's what we need to do, is peacefully, non-violently, but very aggressively and civil disobedience.
[00:02:58.294 --> 00:03:01.476]  We'll talk with Dr. Zelenko, good friend of mine, great patriot for humanity.
[00:03:01.476 --> 00:03:05.960]  In just a few minutes we've got a break, but we can joke and laugh about this all day.
[00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:11.783]  This is really, really, really, really serious.
[00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:19.388]  And we now have more FDA documents that have come out confirming what Dr. Yedon said a year and a half ago and what Dr. Zelenko said and so much more.
[00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:26.373]  And Dr. Yedon has also come out, former chief scientist at Pfizer, and said this is definitely a depopulation weapon.
[00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.814]  Six months ago he said it looks like it may be depopulation.
[00:03:28.814 --> 00:03:32.837]  He said now there is no doubt this is depopulation.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.762]  That's like Michael Jordan saying, there's no doubt he made the three-pointer.
[00:03:37.762 --> 00:03:39.663]  Michael Jordan knows basketball.
[00:03:39.663 --> 00:03:44.225]  Dr. Michael Udon knows vaccines.
[00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:45.186]  And this is not a vaccine.
[00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:49.268]  And you've got so many other scientists.
[00:03:49.268 --> 00:03:53.310]  You've got the inventor of mRNA technology coming out in emergency warnings.
[00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.710]  You notice
[00:03:54.997 --> 00:03:59.200]  The inventor of it was a little more tame about it the first year.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.562]  Now he's like, no, it's the population, it's evil, we gotta stop them.
[00:04:02.562 --> 00:04:06.424]  Just what Dr. Zelenko and I talked about the time before last he came on.
[00:04:08.277 --> 00:04:16.882]  And that was, we are going to have to just come out and say everything that's going down, everything that's happening.
[00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:18.383]  We got to just admit they're killing us.
[00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.464]  Because we argue, oh, this doesn't work.
[00:04:20.464 --> 00:04:21.565]  Oh, the vaccine's not perfect.
[00:04:21.565 --> 00:04:22.945]  You know, why are you wrong?
[00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:25.707]  If we do that, they keep winning.
[00:04:25.707 --> 00:04:28.028]  But that's not what's going on here.
[00:04:28.028 --> 00:04:29.509]  That's not what's happening.
[00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.112]  This is premeditated plan from the beginning.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.962]  All right, we're getting Dr. Zelenko hooked up right now, getting his camera working here.
[00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:42.184]  We're going to go to break and come back in 60 seconds with him straight ahead.
[00:04:42.184 --> 00:04:46.246]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:46.246 --> 00:04:48.107]  And please don't forget FreeWorldNews.tv.
[00:04:48.107 --> 00:05:00.734]  It's the same address as Vandot Video, it's just on a blocked link.
[00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:03.175]  History is happening now.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:22.133]  As we close out the year 2021 and accelerate into the critical year of 2022, it is so important to really meditate on the fact and let it sink in that we are in the middle of a globalist world government takeover whose end game is forced depopulation.
[00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:29.358]  The death, the disease, the horror being caused by these GMO gene therapy shots is just the beginning.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.363]  They are now accelerating a program that will collapse civilization.
[00:05:35.363 --> 00:05:37.944]  There's not much time left to turn this around.
[00:05:37.944 --> 00:05:47.030]  The globals are now getting a big cyber attack ready that they're going to launch, and again, blame on terrorists and use as a pretext to further collapse civilization.
[00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.413]  Only being aware of this and only rallying against it now can back them off.
[00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:58.817]  Please, ladies and gentlemen, continue to spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and the live show, because you are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.098]  Without you, we're going to lose.
[00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:11.003]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:25.295]  So if it's going to be used, it's better to focus on those groups who have risk of severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to give boosters to kill children, which is not right.
[00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:43.837]  So, when your government scientists tell you that a variant that's 0.3% different from SARS could masquerade as a new virus and be a threat to your health, you should know, and I'm telling you, they are lying.
[00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:50.483]  If they're lying, and they are, why is the pharmaceutical industry making top-up vaccines?
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.641]  They are making them.
[00:06:52.641 --> 00:07:01.307]  You should be terrified at this point, as I am, because there's absolutely no possible justification for their manufacture.
[00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:12.975]  But they're being made, and the world's medicines regulators have said, because they're quite similar to the original vaccines, the ones that are being given now, we won't be asking them to do any clinical safety studies.
[00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:17.558]  So let me just say again, the variants are not different enough to represent a threat to use.
[00:07:17.558 --> 00:07:20.960]  You do not need to top up vaccines, yet they are being made.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.384]  And the regulators have more or less waved them through.
[00:07:25.384 --> 00:07:26.905]  I'm very frightened of that.
[00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:31.509]  There's no possible benign interpretation of this.
[00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.433]  I believe that they're going to be used to damage your health and possibly kill you.
[00:07:35.433 --> 00:07:36.274]  Seriously.
[00:07:36.274 --> 00:07:43.120]  I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.041]  This will provide the tools to do it.
[00:07:45.862 --> 00:08:03.079]  And plausible deniability, because they'll create another story about some sort of biological threat, and you'll line up and get your top-up vaccines, and a few months or a year or so later, you'll die of some peculiar, explicable syndrome, and they won't be able to associate it with the top-up vaccines.
[00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:08.884]  But that's my belief, that they're lying to you about variants, so they can make damaging
[00:08:09.905 --> 00:08:14.650]  Top-up vaccines that you don't need at all, and I think they'll be used for malign purposes.
[00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:20.755]  And if you don't wake up, that's what's going to happen, I think, during next year.
[00:08:20.755 --> 00:08:22.537]  Well, that's really scary, and it's true.
[00:08:22.537 --> 00:08:31.005]  It's Dr. Michael Yeadon, former head of the technology division and the head scientist of respiratory viruses at Pfizer.
[00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.821]  And Dr. Robert Malone is the inventor of mRNA technology.
[00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:40.244]  The first year and a half, he's like, maybe they're idiots, maybe they don't know, but this is going to hurt a lot of people.
[00:08:40.244 --> 00:08:42.906]  Now he's like, no, it's premeditated, it's evil, we got to stop them.
[00:08:42.906 --> 00:08:44.307]  Because you cannot deny that.
[00:08:44.307 --> 00:08:50.091]  I had Dr. Zelenko on time before last, about a month ago, and I'm not tooting our horn.
[00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:51.972]  I'm saying we know what we're talking about.
[00:08:51.972 --> 00:08:54.614]  Please listen to us because I want to get out of this with our lives.
[00:08:54.614 --> 00:08:56.095]  I want you to get out of it as well.
[00:08:56.095 --> 00:08:57.156]  This is real.
[00:08:57.156 --> 00:08:58.177]  The biggest threat in the last
[00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:01.548]  Human development, this is the biggest event ever.
[00:09:01.548 --> 00:09:20.941]  You cannot debate that this is like Hitler on steroids and that if we don't identify it's on purpose and we don't identify these are war criminals and we don't identify they cooked it up on purpose, then they keep being able to debate us and argue little fine points and keep people distracted.
[00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:22.462]  So that is not the point
[00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:25.065]  That we're making here.
[00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.746]  This is not some accidental thing.
[00:09:26.746 --> 00:09:31.828]  These aren't just companies that mean well that screwed up in all this garbage.
[00:09:31.828 --> 00:09:35.550]  These are individuals that are using this to take over the planet.
[00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.251]  And it's in the Great Reset documents.
[00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:39.592]  And it's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:09:41.542 --> 00:09:43.564]  Zev Zelenko joins us here.
[00:09:43.564 --> 00:09:44.724]  He needs no introduction.
[00:09:44.724 --> 00:09:45.985]  So much has happened.
[00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:55.112]  He also issued an alert yesterday that if something happens to him, that he's not died of cancer, which he's fighting right now, but that it could be foul play.
[00:09:55.112 --> 00:09:56.133]  I want to say the same thing.
[00:09:56.133 --> 00:09:57.734]  I'm getting a lot of death threats right now.
[00:09:57.734 --> 00:09:59.475]  We're not being dramatic, folks.
[00:09:59.475 --> 00:10:01.837]  We're at the tip of the spear, exposing mass murderers.
[00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:03.318]  This is a war.
[00:10:03.318 --> 00:10:05.300]  And like Marshall McLuhan said 50 years ago,
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.222]  I got a lot of questions and a lot to say and a lot to break down and I want you to be able to take us where you want to go first.
[00:10:10.222 --> 00:10:11.963]  So take us there and then I want to talk to you about Dr.
[00:10:28.968 --> 00:10:36.791]  Michael Yeadon, who I know you talk a lot about getting even more hardcore now and basically aligning with what you and I are saying.
[00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:44.253]  It isn't about us being right, but I think it's key to really have people face what we're up against if we have any chance of beating them.
[00:10:44.253 --> 00:10:46.254]  We're going to win.
[00:10:46.254 --> 00:10:48.595]  It's like someone who plays chess.
[00:10:48.595 --> 00:10:52.436]  The better chess player you are, the more moves ahead you could see.
[00:10:52.436 --> 00:10:54.357]  And I see already that it's checkmate.
[00:10:54.986 --> 00:11:03.312]  The only question that's still a variable is how much carnage and what will be the body count of the innocent until we get to that point.
[00:11:03.312 --> 00:11:14.781]  And the reason why I'm doing these interviews is that I hope that spreading the true narrative and giving people hope may mitigate or reduce the body count.
[00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:18.624]  And so regarding Dr. Michael Yadin, I know him personally.
[00:11:18.624 --> 00:11:19.705]  He's a mentor of mine.
[00:11:19.705 --> 00:11:22.667]  He's a brilliant scientist, former Vice President of Pfizer.
[00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:31.103]  And he told me personally that for every one child that dies from COVID, a hundred die from the vaccine.
[00:11:31.103 --> 00:11:37.206]  The vaccine is a hundred times more lethal to children than the virus.
[00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:47.491]  I think it's more than that, but he has the statistics and the data analysis to prove that, and he has actually presented that information to the world.
[00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:48.392]  He's a man of integrity.
[00:11:48.392 --> 00:11:48.992]  He has only
[00:11:49.944 --> 00:11:52.125]  Uh, what to lose from coming out of retirement.
[00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:53.505]  He's a very wealthy man.
[00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:56.126]  He doesn't need the, uh, all this aggravation.
[00:11:56.126 --> 00:12:07.749]  The only reason why he's doing it is I believe that he's being motivated by altruism and a genuine desire to, um, protect people from carnage.
[00:12:07.749 --> 00:12:19.433]  Um, now I think that it's extremely important to understand what is the motivation behind the criminals and monsters that have done this.
[00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:22.527]  Because, and everything, no one should believe a word I'm saying.
[00:12:22.527 --> 00:12:25.809]  They should just listen and then do their own due diligence.
[00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:33.514]  I provided for you resources and references to what I'm about to say, but much of which I'm sure you know.
[00:12:33.514 --> 00:12:45.403]  But 30 years ago, it became obvious to the people in power and people who are the wealthiest, most powerful people in the planet, that there was going to be a major catastrophe economically.
[00:12:46.201 --> 00:12:55.943]  Uh, in 30 years, there will be a collapse bankruptcy of the beginning bankruptcy of Social Security and Medicare.
[00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:57.603]  And that's all known.
[00:12:57.603 --> 00:13:04.604]  And Biden's recent policies of increased entitlements have upped the date to the anticipated collapse.
[00:13:04.604 --> 00:13:08.785]  The 2027-2026 used to be 2028.
[00:13:08.785 --> 00:13:09.825]  That's the beginning.
[00:13:09.825 --> 00:13:15.426]  And within 10 years, there'll be a complete bankruptcy that will have a tsunami
[00:13:16.167 --> 00:13:32.220]  Affect on the global economy and threatens the stakeholders, their power and their wealth and control mechanisms over humanity, which they've had cultivated over millennia.
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:43.749]  We're talking about a force of evil that has always used human slavery as an asset.
[00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:50.617]  Slavery has always been the most lucrative industry in the history of humanity.
[00:13:50.617 --> 00:13:52.437]  And these people are amoral.
[00:13:52.437 --> 00:13:53.338]  They're not immoral.
[00:13:53.338 --> 00:13:55.038]  They are amoral.
[00:13:55.038 --> 00:13:58.599]  Which means they are moral when it's expedient for them.
[00:13:58.599 --> 00:14:01.279]  They're immoral when it's expedient for them.
[00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:04.080]  They support the Jews when it's expedient for them.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.680]  They support the Christians when it's useful to them.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.541]  And then they set the Jews against the Christians and vice versa when it's useful for them.
[00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:12.522]  They're capitalists when they need to be.
[00:14:12.522 --> 00:14:13.762]  They're communists when they need to be.
[00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:29.544]  This level of malevolence transcends all of these systems that they have set, and they play games and create chaos and geopolitical destabilization in order to promote their own agenda.
[00:14:29.544 --> 00:14:36.886]  In this particular case, it became obvious to everyone that there was going to be a huge economic collapse, and they were threatened.
[00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:38.486]  What have they done?
[00:14:38.486 --> 00:14:41.407]  They've initiated a plan over the last 30 years that
[00:14:42.827 --> 00:14:58.017]  Will result in when the system collapses, and the dust settles, they will have the new financial infrastructure and control mechanisms to lead to the ultimate enslavement of humanity.
[00:14:58.017 --> 00:15:01.399]  And let me explain.
[00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:11.085]  In 2016, everyone knows, Klaus Schwab said that within 10 years, meaning by 2026, right before the anticipated collapse,
[00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:18.337]  Seven billion people will be tagged with a digital tracking device, essentially.
[00:15:18.337 --> 00:15:28.000]  A biometric sensor that transmits biometric data with your location to a third party.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.481]  And it's not science fiction.
[00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:32.322]  There's a patent, which we've spoken about several times.
[00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:35.243]  He said on French TV, he said, first you'll wear it, then it'll be in the skin.
[00:15:36.823 --> 00:15:40.244]  Right, that's Klaus Schwab saying that and I have that video.
[00:15:40.244 --> 00:15:44.606]  But in addition to that, there's a patent, the two patents that go hand in hand.
[00:15:44.606 --> 00:15:53.730]  The one patent that says that the current vaccines have nanotechnology in them that allows them to measure your heart rate.
[00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.310]  Stay right there, we're gonna come right back to you.
[00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.051]  This is riveting information.
[00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:59.372]  Dr. Zalinko, please stay with us.
[00:15:59.372 --> 00:16:01.793]  History is happening now.
[00:16:03.115 --> 00:16:20.783]  As we close out the year 2021 and accelerate into the critical year of 2022, it is so important to really meditate on the fact and let it sink in that we are in the middle of a globalist world government takeover whose end game is forced depopulation.
[00:16:20.783 --> 00:16:28.007]  The death, the disease, the horror being caused by these GMO gene therapy shots is just the beginning.
[00:16:29.232 --> 00:16:34.013]  They are now accelerating a program that will collapse civilization.
[00:16:34.013 --> 00:16:36.594]  There's not much time left to turn this around.
[00:16:36.594 --> 00:16:45.676]  The globals are now getting a big cyber attack ready that they're going to launch, and again, blame on terrorists and use as a pretext to further collapse civilization.
[00:16:45.676 --> 00:16:50.057]  Only being aware of this and only rallying against it now can back them off.
[00:16:50.057 --> 00:16:57.459]  Please, ladies and gentlemen, continue to spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and the live show, because you are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:16:57.459 --> 00:16:58.739]  Without you, we're going to lose.
[00:17:00.623 --> 00:17:07.745]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul, I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet.
[00:17:07.745 --> 00:17:09.566]  I've had a lot of loss.
[00:17:09.566 --> 00:17:10.326]  Everybody else has.
[00:17:10.326 --> 00:17:24.270]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.991]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:36.476]  And I see the general public in a medically-induced, scientifically-induced, behavioral-psychologically-controlled trance.
[00:17:36.476 --> 00:17:41.058]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder, and it's so incredibly sad.
[00:17:41.058 --> 00:17:50.765]  But this is the process of birth, and then growth, and then falling apart, and then degenerating and collapsing, and then coming back to life again.
[00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:59.979]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:07.385]  Ultimate Bone Broth is back and better than ever and 20% off plus free shipping and double Patriot points for our new sale.
[00:18:07.385 --> 00:18:14.530]  After years of being off the shelves we're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever and it's now been reformulated and is even stronger.
[00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.392]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[00:18:17.052 --> 00:18:26.080]  It's got concentrated high-quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.723]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[00:18:29.723 --> 00:18:36.248]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:38.190]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.672]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[00:18:40.672 --> 00:18:45.576]  Again, it has that cutting-edge chicken broth protein isolate powder.
[00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:47.718]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[00:18:47.718 --> 00:18:52.222]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals
[00:19:08.078 --> 00:19:16.664]  Hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[00:19:16.664 --> 00:19:21.107]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[00:19:21.107 --> 00:19:29.994]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[00:19:29.994 --> 00:19:32.735]  That's why everybody should visit InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:32.735 --> 00:19:37.579]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in America products
[00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:40.881]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:22.065 --> 00:20:48.449]  I didn't talk to Dr. Zelenko before he came on air today and I didn't tell him I want to talk about the Great Reset and engineered financial collapse and how SWAB is now pre-programming there's gonna be a big cyber attack that they claim terrorists launched we know who will really launch it and notice he just brought it up without us even asking because we're all synced up that's God consciousness that's what scares the Satanist he wrote an article titled government is the enemy
[00:20:49.662 --> 00:20:52.185]  What is really going on by Dr. Zelenko?
[00:20:52.185 --> 00:20:54.268]  So, Doctor, please continue.
[00:20:54.268 --> 00:20:57.572]  You got caught up on the break.
[00:20:57.572 --> 00:21:00.456]  They know they fraudulently created all this fractional reserve banking.
[00:21:00.456 --> 00:21:02.078]  They've created all these derivatives.
[00:21:02.078 --> 00:21:03.480]  They've taken the world over by it.
[00:21:04.201 --> 00:21:05.102]  But it's a scam.
[00:21:05.102 --> 00:21:20.030]  So instead of them all going to jail, they've come up with a plan to collapse the world economy, pose as the saviors, and depopulate the useful cedars in the process, which is what so many corrupt feudal lords have done in the past, like the Aztecs and others, when they didn't want to feed their population.
[00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.331]  Please continue.
[00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:32.096]  Yeah, so the patent that I mentioned earlier gives the technology and the mechanism through which Klaus Schwab's prophecy, let's say,
[00:21:32.763 --> 00:21:45.650]  Uh, about 7 billion people having a digital identifier, um, that connects them to a centralized network or grid or matrix, um, is going to happen.
[00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:50.413]  And, and the second patent that goes together with that is what Microsoft has from 2020.
[00:21:50.413 --> 00:21:55.156]  Um, it's W-O-20-20-O-6-O-6-O-6.
[00:21:55.156 --> 00:22:00.819]  And that patent describes the linkage of biometric data transmission to cryptocurrency.
[00:22:01.345 --> 00:22:03.986]  And so let me explain to you what that actually means.
[00:22:03.986 --> 00:22:15.270]  It means that in the future, say 2026 at the time, there'll be no more EasyPass, there'll be no more Apple Pay, there'll be no more credit cards.
[00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.651]  It'll be biometric transactions.
[00:22:18.651 --> 00:22:29.415]  In other words, you are now injected with a technology that transmits your internal temperament and your internal data with your location to a third party.
[00:22:29.415 --> 00:22:29.555]  Now,
[00:22:30.276 --> 00:22:35.978]  And that will allow you to, let's say, put your hand on a scanner and then walk out from the supermarket.
[00:22:35.978 --> 00:22:41.900]  So the hipsters think it's cool, but the problem with that is, what if I don't want to be part of the Matrix?
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:47.222]  What if I don't want to be injected with a tracking technology?
[00:22:47.222 --> 00:22:50.044]  Well, then I would be excluded from the system of finance.
[00:22:50.044 --> 00:22:56.166]  I won't be able to buy bread, at least not probably on the black market, but I won't be able to buy bread for my family.
[00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.246]  So it's a control mechanism.
[00:22:57.246 --> 00:22:58.507]  It's the mark of the beast.
[00:22:58.507 --> 00:22:58.927]  In other words,
[00:23:00.272 --> 00:23:11.741]  If I don't participate in the system that they have created and control, I will be excluded from the ability to do transactions, financial transactions.
[00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:13.522]  So they don't have to put a bullet in my head.
[00:23:13.522 --> 00:23:18.826]  They just have to prevent my ability to buy food for my family.
[00:23:18.826 --> 00:23:21.988]  And that's like the social credit system in China, where basically
[00:23:22.557 --> 00:23:26.778]  They could set a radius through which I can't go out of my house and put me on house arrest.
[00:23:26.778 --> 00:23:27.698]  They know my location.
[00:23:27.698 --> 00:23:34.879]  I step out out of my permitted radius, let's say, and they turn off my ability to do finance.
[00:23:34.879 --> 00:23:36.720]  So this is a control mechanism.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:45.342]  And the entire crisis here has nothing to do with medicine, has nothing to do with health.
[00:23:45.342 --> 00:23:47.442]  There are fools on this planet right now who actually think
[00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:53.323]  That the governing bodies actually care about your well-being, then there's no hope for you.
[00:23:53.323 --> 00:23:57.585]  But the reality is that COVID-19 is a weapon of mass destruction.
[00:23:57.585 --> 00:23:58.686]  It was made in a laboratory.
[00:23:58.686 --> 00:24:00.047]  No one denies that.
[00:24:00.047 --> 00:24:00.847]  And I want to tell you something, Alex.
[00:24:00.847 --> 00:24:11.372]  I don't know if you realize that Ralph Baric, Dr. Baric, was involved in every step of the development of this bioweapon and converting it to a human virus.
[00:24:11.372 --> 00:24:13.833]  He took a bad coronavirus.
[00:24:14.417 --> 00:24:18.781]  Changed some things on it, got a patent for it, and technology to convert it to a human virus.
[00:24:18.781 --> 00:24:29.629]  Then Dr. Baric and Zheng Li in Wuhan, funded by the NIH, they published a paper thanking the NIH, figured out how to augment the lethality of this virus to destroy human lung tissue.
[00:24:29.629 --> 00:24:35.794]  Which was key because Fauci wanted his HIV protein to be part of it so he could pay.
[00:24:35.794 --> 00:24:37.956]  Yes, but here's something you may not know.
[00:24:37.956 --> 00:24:40.318]  That in March of 2020, I came across data, papers,
[00:24:43.697 --> 00:24:43.857]  I don't
[00:25:04.219 --> 00:25:06.881]  By the way, on your Skype is a link to that paper.
[00:25:06.881 --> 00:25:07.781]  Everything I'm saying, I have
[00:25:31.543 --> 00:25:34.904]  evidence for and it should be presented because otherwise it won't be believed.
[00:25:34.904 --> 00:25:35.144]  Yes, sir.
[00:25:35.144 --> 00:25:37.824]  We'll either put it on screen or we'll put it in post later once this is archived.
[00:25:37.824 --> 00:25:38.564]  Please start over.
[00:25:38.564 --> 00:25:40.325]  This is huge.
[00:25:40.325 --> 00:25:40.705]  All right, fine.
[00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:47.426]  So Ralph Baric in 1999 did research at the University of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[00:25:47.426 --> 00:25:56.668]  He was able to manipulate a bat animal virus, a bat coronavirus, converted by modulating a surface protein to infect human beings.
[00:25:56.668 --> 00:25:58.348]  But it was still benign.
[00:25:58.348 --> 00:26:00.509]  It was just infecting human beings now.
[00:26:00.509 --> 00:26:00.769]  And then
[00:26:02.003 --> 00:26:18.728]  In 2010, the same Ralph Varric figured out a way to diffuse coronaviruses by using zinc and zinc ionophores, inhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or inhibiting coronavirus replication.
[00:26:18.728 --> 00:26:25.470]  In 2015, and by the way, everything's here being funded by the United States government, because it's on the papers.
[00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.472]  And on the peer-reviewed papers, they thank the United States government, NIH or whatever, for the funding.
[00:26:31.078 --> 00:26:49.361]  Then, in 2015, in Wuhan, Barrick, together in collaboration with Zheng Li, Dr. Zheng Li, the bad lady they call her, were able to figure out a way to augment the payload of this weapon to destroy human lung tissue and cause blood clots.
[00:26:49.361 --> 00:26:56.042]  They wrote a paper about it, they thanked the NIH, they published it, and they got patents on it.
[00:26:56.042 --> 00:26:57.703]  And here's another layer to the story.
[00:26:57.703 --> 00:26:59.343]  The same Ralph Barrick worked
[00:26:59.892 --> 00:27:06.156]  With a team from Gilead Pharmaceuticals to make remdesivir.
[00:27:06.156 --> 00:27:08.217]  Which destroys the kidneys and doesn't help you.
[00:27:08.217 --> 00:27:09.618]  This is so diabolical.
[00:27:09.618 --> 00:27:13.701]  So every way you can see the criminal pre-planning.
[00:27:13.701 --> 00:27:14.561]  Yes.
[00:27:14.561 --> 00:27:18.304]  And so, this is a bioweb.
[00:27:18.304 --> 00:27:21.606]  And they had the antidote for it.
[00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:25.569]  And they suppressed the antidote intentionally, not for themselves.
[00:27:25.569 --> 00:27:26.149]  You think these
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.201]  Masterminds want their own families to die?
[00:27:30.201 --> 00:27:31.402]  Of course not.
[00:27:31.402 --> 00:27:32.243]  They themselves know.
[00:27:32.243 --> 00:27:44.852]  This is consistent with what I knew about the executives of... Yeah, you broke that a year ago, and Joe Rogan confirmed it, that hundreds of members of Congress in Hollywood all know about this, but still want it suppressed.
[00:27:44.852 --> 00:27:49.735]  That your protocol, they were using your protocol, but they suppress it for the general public.
[00:27:49.735 --> 00:27:52.117]  Talk about evil.
[00:27:52.117 --> 00:27:57.781]  Yeah, also the executives of Google, I know internally that they're all taking hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
[00:27:58.655 --> 00:28:12.061]  And so, this information, the antidote to the bomb, the poison, was known, was created by the same monsters, but they hid it from you and me.
[00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:22.606]  Now, when doctors like myself stumbled across these approaches, because we had necessity, the patients were dying, and so we needed some help.
[00:28:22.606 --> 00:28:23.786]  We needed help.
[00:28:23.786 --> 00:28:25.247]  We needed to treat the patients.
[00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:27.568]  And so, immediately, anything that
[00:28:28.371 --> 00:28:37.676]  Would help, hydroxychloroquine, then ivermectin, and even the concept of early intervention, getting rid of this infection before the complications begin.
[00:28:37.676 --> 00:28:44.259]  Everything was vilified, marginalized, and doctors that were advocating for it were deplatformed.
[00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:48.861]  So what you've laid out is, they knew it, they had it planned, they censored it, they did it all.
[00:28:48.861 --> 00:28:51.422]  We'll come back with Dr. Zelenko to explain how huge this is.
[00:28:51.422 --> 00:28:52.303]  Straight ahead, please stay with us.
[00:29:00.143 --> 00:29:07.409]  I have come to you countless times over the last 28 years and asked for your support, and you have come through, and you know who you are.
[00:29:07.409 --> 00:29:12.493]  And all that work is building towards the crescendo of 2022.
[00:29:12.493 --> 00:29:20.239]  I can say without a shadow of a doubt, intellectually, spiritually, and at a gut level, that all hell has already broken loose, and it's about to get 10 times worse.
[00:29:20.879 --> 00:29:23.621]  Well, this is the time that tries men and women's souls.
[00:29:23.621 --> 00:29:26.903]  And this is the time when we're going to all see who we really are.
[00:29:26.903 --> 00:29:31.967]  So now, more than ever, please spread the word about InfoWars.com, the articles, the videos.
[00:29:31.967 --> 00:29:36.970]  And please keep us on the air while you get great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:45.196]  We have got the best supplements, the best films, the best books, the most informative information, all at one place, thousands of items at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:45.196 --> 00:29:47.778]  And it's a win-win because you don't just get great products.
[00:29:48.058 --> 00:29:50.860]  You keep the tip of the spear, M4 Wars, on air.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.942]  You keep that light of liberty burning bright on that hill.
[00:29:53.942 --> 00:29:55.623]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:29:55.623 --> 00:29:57.965]  Please visit m4warstore.com and I'll see you in 2022.
[00:29:59.946 --> 00:30:07.693]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda, and with spiritual warfare, and with poisons and chemicals added to the foods.
[00:30:07.693 --> 00:30:09.215]  It's all come out.
[00:30:09.215 --> 00:30:15.981]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made in the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[00:30:15.981 --> 00:30:19.204]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[00:30:19.204 --> 00:30:24.970]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with, but boy, is it true.
[00:30:26.866 --> 00:30:32.690]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:44.899]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser.
[00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:49.365]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars on the air now more than ever.
[00:30:49.365 --> 00:30:55.072]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is satanic.
[00:30:55.072 --> 00:30:59.378]  And we are opposing the one world government and the Mark of the Beast they just announced.
[00:30:59.378 --> 00:31:00.059]  In late August.
[00:31:00.419 --> 00:31:15.609]  Infowars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[00:31:15.609 --> 00:31:19.271]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:25.976]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[00:31:26.576 --> 00:31:30.660]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.403]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[00:31:33.403 --> 00:31:34.224]  It's high quality.
[00:31:34.224 --> 00:31:37.447]  It's very, very low cost at infowarestore.com.
[00:31:37.447 --> 00:31:44.815]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[00:31:44.815 --> 00:31:48.739]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:32:03.043]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[00:32:03.043 --> 00:32:08.925]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the New World Order by empowering humanity.
[00:32:08.925 --> 00:32:11.105]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[00:32:11.105 --> 00:32:16.347]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the Matrix,
[00:32:16.867 --> 00:32:26.373]  But it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[00:32:26.373 --> 00:32:28.574]  It is the true digital economy.
[00:32:28.574 --> 00:32:32.737]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendental control.
[00:32:33.732 --> 00:32:41.795]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[00:32:41.795 --> 00:32:47.718]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important, and it is now available.
[00:32:47.718 --> 00:32:52.459]  Now, the month of December 2021 is here at ResetWars.com.
[00:32:52.459 --> 00:32:56.561]  Start your journey to the next level today at ResetWars.com.
[00:32:56.561 --> 00:32:58.842]  The globalists fear this information.
[00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:05.733]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.733 --> 00:33:07.055]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:26.545]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.545 --> 00:33:34.671]  And again, I would apologize for 14 minutes of ads an hour, but that's the standard for talk radio and TV, and I hate going to break when Dr. Zelenko is saying something so important.
[00:33:36.253 --> 00:33:41.859]  It's all hardwired in by the satellite feeds that literally cut into the radio stations.
[00:33:41.859 --> 00:33:47.807]  That's why the de-platforming off the internet, we stayed on air because we had over 200 radio stations, and we still do.
[00:33:47.807 --> 00:33:49.589]  We're very thankful to those stations.
[00:33:49.589 --> 00:33:52.012]  But I am going to start the new year three nights a week.
[00:33:53.089 --> 00:34:16.131]  At least three nights a week a multi-hour commercial free podcast direct to you the viewers and listeners with guests and callers where I might take a break to go to the bathroom or get a cup of coffee or something but it's not gonna have regular commercial breaks so look for that in the new year something I promised to do the world's so crazy we're here but Dr. Zalinko I know our listeners are smart they're awesome people but I want them to get what you're saying you're laying out any grand jury
[00:34:17.111 --> 00:34:21.752]  It would take a few weeks to give a grand jury all this, but they would definitely indict Fauci for what you're saying.
[00:34:21.752 --> 00:34:26.973]  You're laying out the compendium of basically how this criminal plan was set up.
[00:34:26.973 --> 00:34:36.134]  And when you see how criminal it was, like you were saying last time you were on, months before the outbreak, Gates and Fauci are already sending messages saying, get the vaccine ready.
[00:34:36.134 --> 00:34:37.875]  You're like, wait, they didn't make the vaccine.
[00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:44.836]  No, they own the patents to what vaccine they, quote, wanted to then be sent out to the major makers, which they also got paid money from.
[00:34:44.836 --> 00:34:46.196]  So the trail
[00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:54.172]  I think is what you're saying of them scientifically preparing this is one of the most open and shut premeditated murder cases ever.
[00:34:54.172 --> 00:34:56.693]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:34:56.693 --> 00:34:59.153]  I'm saying this is the worst crime in human history.
[00:34:59.153 --> 00:35:01.094]  It's a genocide.
[00:35:01.094 --> 00:35:05.855]  It's mass murder, first degree premeditated genocide and mass murder.
[00:35:05.855 --> 00:35:15.398]  And it's being driven essentially by demonic personalities that are absolutely obsessed with power.
[00:35:16.229 --> 00:35:20.671]  And wealth, but more than wealth, I think it's power.
[00:35:20.671 --> 00:35:24.613]  Because once you have $100 billion, let's say, what's the difference if you have $150 billion?
[00:35:24.613 --> 00:35:25.554]  You don't feel it.
[00:35:25.554 --> 00:35:43.043]  But power and being able to enslave others, it fulfills the perverse desires of these narcissists, egotists, and really, I would even call them Satan incarnate or the embodiment of the essence of evil.
[00:35:46.147 --> 00:35:48.448]  You know who Barbara Marks Hubbard was?
[00:35:48.448 --> 00:35:48.768]  Yes.
[00:35:48.768 --> 00:35:53.670]  Okay, she is the demonic mother of the New World Order.
[00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.672]  She, uh, I hope she burns in hell for all eternity.
[00:35:56.672 --> 00:36:01.614]  She, um, and I'm going to read you a few quotes from her that will explain to you the philosophy.
[00:36:01.614 --> 00:36:08.317]  She's the ideology, the mother of the ideology of Klaus Schwab, let's say.
[00:36:08.317 --> 00:36:12.759]  One fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social body.
[00:36:12.759 --> 00:36:13.219]  It's a quote.
[00:36:13.843 --> 00:36:18.826]  We are in charge of God's selection process for planet Earth.
[00:36:18.826 --> 00:36:22.048]  He selects, we destroy.
[00:36:22.048 --> 00:36:26.870]  We are the riders of the pale horse death."
[00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:27.611]  End quote.
[00:36:27.611 --> 00:36:30.432]  Another quote from her.
[00:36:30.432 --> 00:36:34.614]  This act is as horrible as killing a cancer cell.
[00:36:34.614 --> 00:36:39.377]  It must be done for the sake of the future of the whole, so be it.
[00:36:39.995 --> 00:36:44.378]  Be prepared for the selection process which is now beginning.
[00:36:44.378 --> 00:37:02.331]  We, the elders, have been patiently waiting until the very last moment before the quantum transformation to take action to cut out this corrupted and corrupting element in the body of humanity.
[00:37:02.331 --> 00:37:04.833]  It is like watching a cancer grow.
[00:37:04.833 --> 00:37:07.855]  Something must be done before the whole body is destroyed.
[00:37:08.502 --> 00:37:14.406]  The destructive one-fourth must be eliminated from the social body.
[00:37:14.406 --> 00:37:21.031]  I want to read you one more quote, not from her, from Jacques Attali.
[00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:28.436]  He was an advisor to the French Prime Minister from 1981 till in the 90s.
[00:37:28.436 --> 00:37:29.737]  I think 1991.
[00:37:29.737 --> 00:37:33.220]  Yeah, that was François Mitterrand, who was a big Luciferian.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.181]  Please continue.
[00:37:35.181 --> 00:37:38.003]  Yes, so he was Mitterrand's right-hand man.
[00:37:39.196 --> 00:37:42.657]  And this is from a book called Verbatim in 1981.
[00:37:42.657 --> 00:37:52.960]  Now, the Facebook fact checker, Myth Busters, or Myth whatever it's called, says that this isn't true.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.581]  But this is how I know that this must be true.
[00:37:56.581 --> 00:38:01.302]  The future will be about finding a way to reduce the population.
[00:38:01.302 --> 00:38:04.703]  Of course, we will not be able to execute people or build camps.
[00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:09.572]  We get rid of them by making them believe it is for their own good.
[00:38:09.572 --> 00:38:22.478]  We'll find or cause something, a pandemic targeting certain people, a real economic crisis or not, a virus affecting the old or the elderly.
[00:38:22.478 --> 00:38:23.699]  It doesn't matter.
[00:38:23.699 --> 00:38:27.401]  The weak and the fearful will succumb to it.
[00:38:27.401 --> 00:38:31.403]  The stupid will believe in it and ask to be treated.
[00:38:31.403 --> 00:38:34.044]  We will have taken care
[00:38:34.557 --> 00:38:40.442]  of having panned the treatment, a treatment that will be the solution.
[00:38:40.442 --> 00:38:45.987]  The selection of idiots will therefore be done by itself.
[00:38:45.987 --> 00:38:50.510]  They will go to the slaughterhouse alone.
[00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.671]  Wow!
[00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:58.317]  Dr. Zaliga, let me just say this, because this is about God Consciousness, and I don't say something that isn't true, but it's a little embarrassing to say just because it's so personal.
[00:38:59.855 --> 00:39:02.037]  You normally, it takes about a week to get you on the show.
[00:39:02.037 --> 00:39:03.278]  Today you were able to come on.
[00:39:03.278 --> 00:39:07.562]  I had a dream about you last night, but I couldn't remember the dream when I woke up.
[00:39:07.562 --> 00:39:09.783]  When I got up, I said, I got to get Zelenko on today.
[00:39:09.783 --> 00:39:11.785]  And then I said, what was the dream about?
[00:39:11.785 --> 00:39:13.326]  I couldn't remember.
[00:39:13.326 --> 00:39:18.371]  And then I just remembered that I said to myself, well, Zelenko kind of says the same thing every time he's on, just like you do.
[00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:19.231]  It's not an attack.
[00:39:19.231 --> 00:39:19.972]  It's true.
[00:39:19.972 --> 00:39:20.953]  Same emergency message.
[00:39:20.953 --> 00:39:22.875]  But I said, no, today's going to be different.
[00:39:22.875 --> 00:39:24.296]  And then I intended to come in here.
[00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:34.766]  And talk about depopulation, talk about the UN, talk about Schwab, and talk about, she wasn't even by name, but those same groups, and then here you said it.
[00:39:34.766 --> 00:39:35.966]  This is amazing.
[00:39:35.966 --> 00:39:40.047]  And I'm not trying to be weird about it, it's just true, so I feel like I should have said that.
[00:39:40.047 --> 00:39:42.808]  Go ahead.
[00:39:42.808 --> 00:39:43.969]  Listen, truth is truth.
[00:39:43.969 --> 00:39:46.669]  It's in the air, you know?
[00:39:46.669 --> 00:39:48.290]  And people that are attuned to it,
[00:39:49.448 --> 00:39:54.632]  I think it's become much more accessible to anyone who wants to access and download this information.
[00:39:54.632 --> 00:39:56.533]  And I'm talking about metaphysically.
[00:39:56.533 --> 00:39:58.975]  That there's an intuitive sense of what's true and what's not.
[00:39:58.975 --> 00:40:15.906]  Anyone who has some degree of sensitivity sees that this is an attempt by the forces of evil to steal God-consciousness and then use fear to breed codependency on a cult.
[00:40:15.906 --> 00:40:17.687]  Codependency on sociopaths.
[00:40:18.197 --> 00:40:20.279]  Yeah, but I see it actually in a different way.
[00:40:20.279 --> 00:40:23.401]  I see that God is giving every human being an opportunity.
[00:40:23.401 --> 00:40:25.762]  It's like we're in the generation right before the flood of Noah.
[00:40:44.509 --> 00:40:48.592]  And God is saying, listen, repent and get on the ark.
[00:40:48.592 --> 00:40:54.415]  Don't stay in the turbulent waters of idol worship and child sacrifice and paganism.
[00:40:54.415 --> 00:40:56.016]  You see, it's the decisions of man.
[00:40:56.016 --> 00:41:02.760]  If you know, there's a psychoanalyst, what's his name, I forget, but I'll remember in a minute, but Carl Jung.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.520]  Carl Jung.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:09.724]  He wrote that the degradation of a society begins with the degradation, moral degradation of an individual.
[00:41:10.743 --> 00:41:16.909]  And so you can learn vice versa that the moral improvement of a society begins with the refinement of the individual.
[00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:33.306]  And so it's the sum total of all of our bad decisions over the last whatever period of time that has led to the slaughter of the unborn, the defamation and desecration of gender roles, the desecration of what marriage is, the
[00:41:34.219 --> 00:41:45.845]  Uh, perversion and poisoning of the youth through the public school system, which teaches debauchery and normalizes, um, the worst behavior, immoral behavior.
[00:41:45.845 --> 00:41:53.189]  So basically this country has drifted away from Judeo-Christian morals and, and let's just keep it simple, the Ten Commandments.
[00:41:53.189 --> 00:42:03.495]  And so therefore it's not surprising to me that there comes a kind of a tipping point that's crossed the threshold that's been passed through collective humanity.
[00:42:03.936 --> 00:42:07.358]  Well, God says, OK, now it's time for a cleaning.
[00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:08.799]  And I think that's what we're going through.
[00:42:08.799 --> 00:42:14.642]  And it may be the best result here is people repent.
[00:42:14.642 --> 00:42:19.645]  They return back to the umbrella of the divine will.
[00:42:19.645 --> 00:42:21.146]  They live a moral life.
[00:42:21.146 --> 00:42:24.247]  They respect life, the sanctity of life.
[00:42:24.247 --> 00:42:25.148]  They respect marriage.
[00:42:25.148 --> 00:42:28.710]  They respect children and the unborn and so on.
[00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:32.352]  And that could avert a major body count.
[00:42:32.352 --> 00:42:32.652]  However,
[00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:39.945]  Regardless of whether or not people are going to realize that, the cleansing will happen.
[00:42:39.945 --> 00:42:47.850]  And so, again, every single individual right now is being given a choice, and that choice is from God.
[00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.172]  And here's the question, who are you going to bow down to?
[00:42:50.172 --> 00:42:50.592]  I agree.
[00:42:50.592 --> 00:42:51.613]  Stay right there, Dr. Zlingo.
[00:42:51.613 --> 00:42:54.015]  Final segment, we'll talk about solutions straight ahead.

[00:45:41.762 --> 00:45:47.705]  But I've got to tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important, and it is now available.
[00:45:47.705 --> 00:45:52.428]  Now, the month of December 2021 is here at ResetWars.com.

[00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:59.391]  The globalists fear this information.
[00:45:59.391 --> 00:46:00.212]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:01.653 --> 00:46:03.074]  Keep us on air.

[00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:25.087]  The new supplements that we have, the latest in the InfoWars Life Supplement line, the Vitamin D3 with Calcium Gummies, the Vitamin C with Zinc and the Whole Food Multivitamins, or if you buy the Combo Pack with all three at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:25.087 --> 00:46:27.549]  And you know, I'm telling you, the Vitamin D Gummies
[00:46:28.578 --> 00:46:30.340]  This is a great thing for your kids.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.000]  They're going to love it.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.742]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[00:46:32.742 --> 00:46:34.143]  It's healthy.
[00:46:34.143 --> 00:46:35.645]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[00:46:35.645 --> 00:46:37.226]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[00:46:37.226 --> 00:46:39.288]  I think for kids, that'd be great.
[00:46:39.288 --> 00:46:40.329]  The calcium, good for them.
[00:46:40.329 --> 00:46:40.789]  The vitamin D.
[00:46:42.082 --> 00:46:47.744]  So, that's at InfoWarsStore.com and again it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[00:46:47.744 --> 00:46:55.966]  So, supplements, the shirts, the air filters, the water filters, the emergency food supplies, the emergency supplies at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:55.966 --> 00:46:57.587]  Your support there keeps us on the air.
[00:46:57.587 --> 00:47:01.628]  We cannot thank you enough.
[00:47:01.628 --> 00:47:07.590]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:09.631]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:47:10.674 --> 00:47:12.195]  I think she's dead now, gone to hell.
[00:47:12.195 --> 00:47:17.478]  But she talks about, we are the pale horse death, we're the new world order, we're going to carry all this out.
[00:47:17.478 --> 00:47:19.159]  I'll pull that quote up for you coming up here.
[00:47:19.159 --> 00:47:21.581]  It's just a few minutes, but I was just paraphrasing it.
[00:47:21.581 --> 00:47:27.364]  But Dr. Zelenko, medical doctor who helped get the first treatments out that saved millions of people, he's here with us.
[00:47:27.364 --> 00:47:34.529]  And I wanted to talk about where we're going here, because everything Satan does is a counterfeit.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.202]  And so Satan says, oh, I'm going to call the people.
[00:47:38.202 --> 00:47:39.643]  I'm going to make them make the decision.
[00:47:39.643 --> 00:47:42.185]  I'm going to make them decide which side they're on.
[00:47:42.185 --> 00:47:44.908]  But then, really, that's God's plan.
[00:47:44.908 --> 00:47:48.951]  It's up to us individually to choose, not for Satan to make those choices for us.
[00:47:48.951 --> 00:47:51.433]  And here's Jack Posobiec, who's a smart guy.
[00:47:51.433 --> 00:47:58.920]  Pretty clear Biden is only crediting Trump for the vaccine to set him up to take the blame for what comes next.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.623]  I think that's a very simple, neutral way to say it.
[00:48:02.623 --> 00:48:07.848]  And now Trump is rubbing it in after speeches in Texas, saying take the shot, it's totally safe, it totally works.
[00:48:07.848 --> 00:48:09.070]  None of that's true.
[00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:13.574]  Trump says most Americans dying are unvaccinated and encourages everyone to get the shot.
[00:48:13.574 --> 00:48:15.496]  Now he loved Dr. Zelenko's protocol.
[00:48:15.496 --> 00:48:16.057]  Help promote it.
[00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:19.976]  I think Trump just thinks doctors are trustworthy.
[00:48:19.976 --> 00:48:21.837]  He hasn't heard of Joseph Mengele?
[00:48:21.837 --> 00:48:26.059]  And I'm sorry to bring up a Nazi analogy, but it's the one that fits here, Dr. Zelenko.
[00:48:26.059 --> 00:48:27.600]  I think Trump's a good person.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.341]  But I'm really worried about him with what he's doing here.
[00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:31.402]  I think he's being set up.
[00:48:31.402 --> 00:48:34.443]  What do you think?
[00:48:34.443 --> 00:48:39.046]  Whatever his motivations are, I have to publicly disagree with him.
[00:48:40.253 --> 00:48:41.274]  I think he's done a lot of good.
[00:48:41.274 --> 00:48:53.503]  I would say the main thing they did that was good was move the federal judiciary to the right with more than 300 justices that have Judeo-Christian values.
[00:48:53.503 --> 00:48:58.326]  I think that did help move the moral compass of this country.
[00:48:58.326 --> 00:49:02.709]  But what he's talking about when it comes to these vaccines, he really doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:49:02.709 --> 00:49:05.511]  Or if he does, then I have a real problem with him.
[00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:08.410]  He's worried about his legacy.
[00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:09.591]  You know, he's a narcissist.
[00:49:09.591 --> 00:49:14.492]  And what he cares about now is his legacy.
[00:49:14.492 --> 00:49:19.073]  And he went warp speed due to political calculations.
[00:49:19.073 --> 00:49:20.094]  This I know for a fact.
[00:49:20.094 --> 00:49:28.876]  But he was looking into pre-hospital treatments and emphasizing that until hydroxychloroquine became politically radioactive.
[00:49:28.876 --> 00:49:35.778]  And then he made a calculation with his team, got bad advice on my short, that shifted him towards a warp speed.
[00:49:36.537 --> 00:49:40.240]  Vaccine development, because he thought that was going to help him win re-election.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:45.043]  And then he went after he secured a second term, go back to pre-hospital.
[00:49:45.043 --> 00:49:48.445]  I was told pre-hospital treatment.
[00:49:48.445 --> 00:49:56.171]  Now, the reality is that the vaccines were known.
[00:49:56.171 --> 00:49:59.153]  The side effects were known and the FDA knew about it.
[00:49:59.153 --> 00:50:05.637]  And months before they released this poisonous death shot on innocent
[00:50:06.403 --> 00:50:11.284]  I think that the Deep State operatives like Rick Bright and Janet Woodcock, and I have evidence for all that, sabotaged his
[00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:36.871]  I mean, how does Trump not be set up here?
[00:51:00.785 --> 00:51:03.648]  Well, he has to recognize that he was sabotaged.
[00:51:03.648 --> 00:51:04.689]  But forget about him.
[00:51:04.689 --> 00:51:06.811]  The American people were sabotaged.
[00:51:06.811 --> 00:51:12.357]  The interests of the American people, the lives and the sanctity of the lives, our lives are desecrated.
[00:51:12.357 --> 00:51:20.586]  And so the only position that he has is to backtrack and say, yes, I had my intuition initially was correct.
[00:51:21.331 --> 00:51:25.372]  The pre-hospital approach is the right approach.
[00:51:25.372 --> 00:51:28.513]  And now we see the evidence of these vaccines.
[00:51:28.513 --> 00:51:31.994]  They don't work and they're dangerous and most people don't need them.
[00:51:31.994 --> 00:51:45.278]  So I'm pivoting now for the welfare of the American public and supporting proven data-driven solutions and not force people to go on a path of self-destruction.
[00:51:45.788 --> 00:51:46.869]  He has to do a mea culpa.
[00:51:46.869 --> 00:51:49.032]  He has to say, I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
[00:51:49.032 --> 00:51:49.473]  And that's OK.
[00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:50.374]  I totally agree.
[00:51:50.374 --> 00:51:51.736]  I totally agree, Dr. Zelenko.
[00:51:51.736 --> 00:51:54.760]  And that's what I've been saying, because I know he got set up and sucked in.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:59.446]  But the deeper he gets sucked into this, it's a major setup.
[00:51:59.446 --> 00:52:02.590]  In the time we have left, the rest of this segment, one more short segment with you.
[00:52:03.504 --> 00:52:04.945]  What do you predict for next year?
[00:52:04.945 --> 00:52:06.326]  I mean, clearly they're lining up.
[00:52:06.326 --> 00:52:09.088]  They're saying Trump supporters are going to launch terror attacks.
[00:52:09.088 --> 00:52:11.229]  The CIA is globalist control.
[00:52:11.229 --> 00:52:12.630]  They're wanting all this.
[00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:16.232]  They're trying to divide and conquer us along all lines.
[00:52:16.232 --> 00:52:21.156]  In fact, I was intending today, that was on my heart, to bring up how they're trying to divide Christian from Jew.
[00:52:21.796 --> 00:52:22.817]  Listen, I've been pretty savvy and I know
[00:52:46.504 --> 00:52:50.286]  Listen, I love you Alex, you should know, I consider you a brother.
[00:52:50.286 --> 00:52:54.967]  Some of the people that listen to you have an interesting view on Jews.
[00:52:54.967 --> 00:53:06.312]  But I'm going to say something about my own religion and about my own religious institutions, and to the anti-Semites that are going to use these words, F you!
[00:53:06.312 --> 00:53:11.734]  Okay, why don't you look into your own organizations and religious structures and refine them.
[00:53:11.734 --> 00:53:14.575]  But I would say, in my own religion, it's the
[00:53:15.985 --> 00:53:18.305]  Organizations that are the problem.
[00:53:18.305 --> 00:53:28.607]  They have been corrupted by the serpent and have preached anything but God-fashioned consciousness and are coercing people.
[00:53:28.607 --> 00:53:32.748]  I know synagogues, you can't go into a synagogue unless you show proof of vaccination.
[00:53:32.748 --> 00:53:38.189]  I mean, this is the perversion of a relationship with the divine.
[00:53:38.189 --> 00:53:44.410]  And so, and I see that in other religions as well, but I don't want to talk about other religions.
[00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:45.250]  I want to talk about my own.
[00:53:46.131 --> 00:53:48.794]  And I'm calling out my own people.
[00:53:48.794 --> 00:54:02.971]  Start living by the law and stop getting on your knees and sucking up to the corrupt government and selling out the congregants and the people that have put their trust in you to help them connect to God.
[00:54:04.495 --> 00:54:06.457]  Anyway, that's my commentary on religion.
[00:54:06.457 --> 00:54:09.559]  And I was going to go, I love you too, because I know you have God consciousness.
[00:54:09.559 --> 00:54:11.321]  My spirit feels really great when I talk to you.
[00:54:11.321 --> 00:54:12.682]  I love you too.
[00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:13.242]  Exactly.
[00:54:13.242 --> 00:54:16.705]  They have groups that have been divided and manipulated.
[00:54:16.705 --> 00:54:19.867]  And if you look at the anti-Jewish groups, they're being manipulated.
[00:54:19.867 --> 00:54:22.029]  If you look at the Jewish supremacist groups, they're being manipulated.
[00:54:22.029 --> 00:54:24.471]  The black supremacist groups, all of it's stupid.
[00:54:24.471 --> 00:54:29.515]  There's an evil manipulating us against each other, and we have to transcend it or it's going to win.
[00:54:29.515 --> 00:54:31.637]  It's very simple, and God's watching.
[00:54:33.291 --> 00:54:43.055]  Because only when we're divided and have strife amongst us, that the enemy could then pick us off in segments.
[00:54:43.055 --> 00:54:54.119]  But if we are truly united by an overwhelming principle that transcends religion, which is actually a relationship with God, with the Divine, we're made in His image, our lives have sanctity.
[00:54:54.119 --> 00:54:56.680]  That's enough for me to call you a brother or a sister.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.540]  That's it.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:01.161]  And if we unite, and I want to tell you something, no one owns God.
[00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:08.496]  The Messiah reveals himself, and I don't care if it's the first, second, or third coming.
[00:55:08.496 --> 00:55:18.928]  Whenever the Messiah reveals himself and the truth of the divine is revealed, I can promise you, my perception of the divine will be wrong, and so will everyone else's.
[00:55:18.928 --> 00:55:21.031]  Because the essence of God is truly hidden.
[00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:22.012]  And hopefully we will
[00:55:22.748 --> 00:55:27.173]  See the truth and understand the truth of what he is.
[00:55:27.173 --> 00:55:32.438]  But right now we're living in the dark and we're trying to approximate, guesstimate what he really is.
[00:55:32.438 --> 00:55:33.740]  No, I totally agree.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:37.824]  And the New World Order and Klaus Schwab are afraid of the coming of the Messiah.
[00:55:37.824 --> 00:55:39.626]  Everything they're doing is to stop the next level.
[00:55:41.437 --> 00:55:42.538]  Because it's the death of them.
[00:55:42.538 --> 00:55:44.039]  You know, darkness goes away.
[00:55:44.039 --> 00:55:46.021]  You just turn on a little light and it goes away.
[00:55:46.021 --> 00:55:47.322]  And so they know that.
[00:55:47.322 --> 00:55:49.964]  They've dug in because they're cornered animals.
[00:55:49.964 --> 00:55:51.025]  That's when they become dangerous.
[00:55:51.025 --> 00:55:54.128]  So you're asking about what else they can do next?
[00:55:54.128 --> 00:56:01.013]  Listen, I have some intelligence assets, as you do, and some of the options are pretty unpleasant.
[00:56:01.013 --> 00:56:08.620]  Whether it's another bioterrorism attack, like the smallpox or Marburg virus, or other weapons of mass destruction.
[00:56:09.264 --> 00:56:12.806]  That can cause further destabilization.
[00:56:12.806 --> 00:56:19.629]  And these people have no problem wasting away billions of people.
[00:56:19.629 --> 00:56:23.091]  But the reality is, I don't worry about that.
[00:56:23.091 --> 00:56:33.176]  And I have no promises or guarantees to myself or to anyone else that if you rise up and storm the beaches of Normandy of this generation, that you'll survive, especially in the first wave.
[00:56:33.176 --> 00:56:35.497]  There's a very good chance that you may fall.
[00:56:35.497 --> 00:56:36.578]  But, so what?
[00:56:37.572 --> 00:56:44.457]  You know, this is a finite life, but you have an opportunity now to connect with the infinite and the eternal, and you have to fall in battle.
[00:56:44.457 --> 00:56:46.619]  This is a hill worth dying on.
[00:56:46.619 --> 00:56:48.821]  And so it takes courage.
[00:56:48.821 --> 00:56:54.945]  We grew up with some degree of freedom, not because of us, but because our parents and grandparents fought for it.
[00:56:54.945 --> 00:56:56.987]  The question is, will our kids be free?
[00:56:56.987 --> 00:56:58.748]  Well, the answer is, are we ready to fight for it?
[00:56:58.748 --> 00:56:59.509]  Are we ready to sacrifice?
[00:56:59.509 --> 00:56:59.889]  No, that's right.
[00:56:59.889 --> 00:57:03.111]  We're living off gas they put in the tank.
[00:57:03.111 --> 00:57:05.033]  So how about the next generation, our kids?
[00:57:06.372 --> 00:57:10.486]  I hope they grow up with the ability to thrive in a society of God consciousness.
[00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:15.650]  But it depends, are we ready to create the environment for that to happen?
[00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:18.552]  Stay there one more segment, Dr. Zelenko, you're absolutely right.
[00:57:18.552 --> 00:57:21.013]  The catalyst is here to go to the next level.
[00:57:21.013 --> 00:57:22.774]  We have to decide whether we're going to do it or not.
[00:57:22.774 --> 00:57:24.275]  Dr. Zelenko is our guest.
[00:57:24.275 --> 00:57:26.116]  We're going to come back in the final segment with him.
[00:57:26.116 --> 00:57:27.857]  Most powerful interview yet.
[00:57:27.857 --> 00:57:28.578]  Wow.
[00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:29.158]  And I'm not kidding.
[00:57:29.158 --> 00:57:31.160]  I woke up this morning, I had a dream about him, couldn't remember what it was.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.380]  I'm like, get Zelenko on.
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:33.821]  Usually he can't come on short notice.
[00:57:33.821 --> 00:57:34.462]  He could today.
[00:57:34.462 --> 00:57:35.582]  So this is meant to happen.
[00:57:35.582 --> 00:57:36.183]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:36.183 --> 00:57:36.523]  Stay with us.
[00:57:49.815 --> 00:57:51.135]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:57:51.135 --> 00:57:53.156]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[00:57:53.156 --> 00:57:53.576]  Welcome.
[00:57:53.576 --> 00:57:54.297]  Hello, Alex?
[00:57:54.297 --> 00:57:54.917]  Yes, Malcolm.
[00:57:54.917 --> 00:57:59.158]  Alright, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[00:57:59.158 --> 00:58:03.760]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.761]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:09.382]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[00:58:09.642 --> 00:58:11.443]  Supramel Vitality really, really works.
[00:58:11.443 --> 00:58:16.347]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[00:58:16.347 --> 00:58:23.132]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[00:58:23.132 --> 00:58:24.974]  This is like a very fine wine.
[00:58:24.974 --> 00:58:27.115]  In fact, each batch is different.
[00:58:27.115 --> 00:58:29.557]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[00:58:29.557 --> 00:58:32.820]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:33.760]  That's just how it is.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.421]  It's how it works.
[00:58:35.122 --> 00:58:39.150]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:42.978]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[00:58:49.508 --> 00:58:54.352]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[00:58:54.352 --> 00:58:56.414]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[00:58:56.414 --> 00:59:01.898]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[00:59:01.898 --> 00:59:02.999]  But we failed.
[00:59:02.999 --> 00:59:04.661]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:06.162]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[00:59:06.502 --> 00:59:12.529]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[00:59:12.529 --> 00:59:21.460]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:22.261]  So we've got to inform
[00:59:22.321 --> 00:59:22.661]  I think so.
[00:59:52.774 --> 00:59:57.578]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:57.578 --> 01:00:11.950]  After decades of intense research, our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds is now live.
[01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:14.892]  The Reset Wars have begun.
[01:00:14.892 --> 01:00:18.355]  Start your journey at ResetWars.com today.
[01:00:23.864 --> 01:00:26.366]  Ladies and gentlemen, Reset Wars is now live.
[01:00:26.366 --> 01:00:29.448]  You can see the course.
[01:00:29.448 --> 01:00:31.449]  Mind Wars, Spirit Wars now.
[01:00:31.449 --> 01:00:38.034]  Game-changing, most powerful info I've ever released at ResetWars.com.
[01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:51.043]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very, very special guest that's going to be joining us coming up in the next segment to deal with COVID-19 and everything that has been unfolding since then.
[01:00:52.154 --> 01:01:02.257]  But I wanted to spend a few minutes here in this segment speaking to you about what I'm going to cover in the third hour today.
[01:01:02.257 --> 01:01:16.221]  And that deals with the January 6th committee and what's happening there and how they're trying to act like Republican Congress people sending text messages to Trump saying, ask the people to stop attacking the building.
[01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:20.522]  CNN, ABC News, NBC News, they're all saying this is proof that Trump
[01:01:21.229 --> 01:01:23.110]  Ordered an attack on the Capitol.
[01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:23.890]  No.
[01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:25.911]  Most people were following him on Twitter.
[01:01:25.911 --> 01:01:28.993]  He had 80 million plus Twitter followers.
[01:01:28.993 --> 01:01:33.815]  And so people were telling him, once it started, he was speaking when it started.
[01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.216]  It was going on for an hour while he spoke.
[01:01:36.216 --> 01:01:42.879]  They started it right while he was speaking so they could claim, they had provocateurs there we now know, that he didn't try to help.
[01:01:42.879 --> 01:01:48.642]  As soon as he gets off, drives to the White House, a few minutes away, he's getting the phone calls,
[01:01:49.532 --> 01:01:53.435]  And he then put out tweets saying, be peaceful, leave the building, don't be there.
[01:01:53.435 --> 01:01:57.537]  But they're acting like because his son Don Jr.
[01:01:57.537 --> 01:02:04.842]  and a bunch of Republican congressmen and others were telling his chief of staff, hey, tell the president, tell people, get out of the building.
[01:02:04.842 --> 01:02:07.023]  This is really going to hurt everything we've done.
[01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:09.245]  We want a 10-day investigation by the Senate.
[01:02:09.245 --> 01:02:10.025]  We had the votes.
[01:02:10.025 --> 01:02:13.427]  This is horrible.
[01:02:13.427 --> 01:02:15.789]  Which again, ladies and gentlemen, is the motive.
[01:02:16.576 --> 01:02:22.160]  You don't have a motive when you're about to have a 10-day investigation by the Senate to go attack the Capitol and make yourself look bad.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.964]  So they're trying to spin this right now.
[01:02:27.964 --> 01:02:32.487]  They're trying to spin all of this right now as if it's proof.
[01:02:32.487 --> 01:02:34.669]  So that's what they do with every piece of information they get.
[01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:43.395]  Oh my gosh, there's text messages on Mark Meadows, the Chief of Staff's phone that they got, that he gave them.
[01:02:44.304 --> 01:02:50.468]  Where the Republicans are trying to stop everything.
[01:02:50.468 --> 01:02:58.153]  And then they turn that around and act like, oh, see, it's proof that Trump was in command, because why would you ask him to stop it if he wasn't in command?
[01:02:58.153 --> 01:02:59.454]  That's ridiculous.
[01:02:59.454 --> 01:03:01.596]  It's like calling the fire department to come put a fire out.
[01:03:01.596 --> 01:03:03.817]  They didn't start the fire, but you call the fire department.
[01:03:03.817 --> 01:03:12.423]  Who had a better chance to electronically tell the 600 people out of a million that were foolish enough to go inside to turn back?
[01:03:12.423 --> 01:03:14.064]  Only Donald Trump had that megaphone.
[01:03:15.453 --> 01:03:20.595]  And it took him 30 minutes from the time he was asked to do it.
[01:03:20.595 --> 01:03:23.116]  And he definitely wanted to watch it, wanted to know what was happening.
[01:03:23.116 --> 01:03:24.977]  A little bit of a slow response.
[01:03:24.977 --> 01:03:27.338]  I'll give you that.
[01:03:27.338 --> 01:03:28.038]  But that's it.
[01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:29.539]  Obviously, he wouldn't blow his feet off.
[01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.019]  Obviously, he wouldn't want this.
[01:03:31.019 --> 01:03:32.680]  This destroyed Trump at that level.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.920]  It totally hurt him.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.762]  So I'll be talking about that some more because I've gotten these subpoenas.
[01:03:37.762 --> 01:03:39.263]  Not subpoena.
[01:03:39.263 --> 01:03:39.883]  Subpoenas.
[01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:42.304]  It's three subpoenas now from the
[01:03:44.873 --> 01:03:47.715]  House Committee on Un-American Activities, Part 2.
[01:03:47.715 --> 01:03:54.559]  And I know that whatever I turn over, I turn stuff over to them, will be twisted and misrepresented.
[01:03:54.559 --> 01:04:09.488]  Now, I got there and within five minutes of me being there and seeing flashbangs and attacks and smoke and people climbing on the Capitol and going in, I was on top of a big pallet of chairs that hadn't been unfolded yet.
[01:04:09.488 --> 01:04:13.190]  I was up on a big pallet, the highest place I could find, saying, get down, stop, come down.
[01:04:14.048 --> 01:04:20.998]  And that was the five minutes it took me to get through the crowd of hundreds of thousands, up closer to the Capitol, and then our guys are trying to get cell service going.
[01:04:20.998 --> 01:04:21.559]  What's going on?
[01:04:21.559 --> 01:04:22.941]  Well, they say they breached the Capitol.
[01:04:22.941 --> 01:04:23.743]  I'm like, get off!
[01:04:23.743 --> 01:04:24.924]  Get out of there!
[01:04:24.924 --> 01:04:25.826]  Don't, don't do it!
[01:04:25.826 --> 01:04:27.648]  Don't, don't be part of this!
[01:04:27.648 --> 01:04:29.050]  NPR is running pieces.
[01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:35.563]  So is the New York Times saying that I was cowardly there, commanding people to break in.
[01:04:35.563 --> 01:04:45.026]  They're still doing that, despite the video, because they don't care, because they're criminal organizations working with the Great Reset and Klaus Schwab to bring down this country.
[01:04:45.026 --> 01:04:48.687]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very special surprise guest coming up next segment.
[01:04:48.687 --> 01:04:50.107]  You'll definitely want to stay with us.
[01:04:50.107 --> 01:04:51.548]  We'll be right back in fullworks.com.
[01:04:59.642 --> 01:05:03.404]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:05:03.404 --> 01:05:07.746]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:05:07.746 --> 01:05:15.870]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:33.226]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:05:33.226 --> 01:05:39.052]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate
[01:05:39.212 --> 01:05:39.693]  Thanks for watching!
[01:06:04.807 --> 01:06:11.995]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:11.995 --> 01:06:16.680]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.541]  I work from 9 to 5.
[01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:20.104]  Hell, I pay the price.
[01:06:20.104 --> 01:06:24.349]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:25.831]  But why do I always feel
[01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:40.936]  Well, I really appreciate our next guest, because out of the hundreds of amazing doctors and scientists that we've interviewed, she is right up there in the top three or so, probably number one, and she's so...
[01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:42.770]  We're good to go.
[01:07:06.132 --> 01:07:08.353]  Big developments, obviously.
[01:07:08.353 --> 01:07:12.035]  Biden officials warn COVID explosion imminent.
[01:07:12.035 --> 01:07:16.358]  That's the same PR by the Bilderberg Group, Debo's group around the world.
[01:07:16.358 --> 01:07:20.920]  New lockdowns coming in January, I'm told, by my FEMA and military connections.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.422]  COVID is a deadly pandemic.
[01:07:23.422 --> 01:07:28.665]  It killed science, logic, evidence, space medicine, and common sense, says Dr. Eli David.
[01:07:29.899 --> 01:07:34.045]  WHO warns of COVID tsunami before Christmas.
[01:07:34.045 --> 01:07:40.034]  California brings back statewide mask mandate in all indoor spaces after COVID cases skyrocket.
[01:07:40.034 --> 01:07:42.978]  Or is it really cases of people that have had the shot that are sick?
[01:07:42.978 --> 01:07:43.619]  We now know that.
[01:07:45.444 --> 01:07:48.045]  Foster, you're safe if you have the shot.
[01:07:48.045 --> 01:07:51.327]  We'll need to get COVID-19 vaccine boosters forever.
[01:07:51.327 --> 01:07:57.991]  That's in the Globe and Mail, and that's in CNN, and that's in Today.com, NBC, it's just everywhere.
[01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.512]  Now it's forever.
[01:07:59.512 --> 01:08:05.615]  The worst part of the first 15 days to flatten the curve is the first two years.
[01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:09.237]  Aussie Prime Minister compares the vaccinated to sheep, calls them good sheep.
[01:08:10.478 --> 01:08:13.960]  Elon Musk says, I am against forcing people to be vaccinated.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.022]  Not something we should do in America.
[01:08:16.022 --> 01:08:17.523]  Infowars has the article.
[01:08:17.523 --> 01:08:21.825]  Elon Musk, person of the year, radicalized by lockdowns.
[01:08:21.825 --> 01:08:23.226]  Maybe somebody else.
[01:08:23.226 --> 01:08:30.151]  Reports, FDA accused of colluding with USPS to stop and destroy packages of ivermectin mailed to patients.
[01:08:30.151 --> 01:08:31.432]  That's now confirmed.
[01:08:31.432 --> 01:08:35.454]  Criminal beyond Nuremberg crimes.
[01:08:35.454 --> 01:08:39.277]  Unvaccinated people shouldn't reproduce, declares Winterfest announcer.
[01:08:40.259 --> 01:08:44.380]  Build Back Better, a game changer for early childhood education.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:45.860]  Got some news on that.
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:49.961]  UK government refuses to reveal details about first Omicron death.
[01:08:49.961 --> 01:08:51.362]  Oh!
[01:08:51.362 --> 01:08:53.322]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:08:53.322 --> 01:08:57.543]  But Dr. Leigh Merritt joins us to cover a host of issues.
[01:08:57.543 --> 01:09:00.904]  She's going to give us a preview of those and then dive right into them.
[01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:03.645]  Doctor, thank you so much for coming back with us.
[01:09:03.645 --> 01:09:04.305]  Thanks for having me.
[01:09:05.401 --> 01:09:09.064]  It's probably been six months since you were on, seems like a million years.
[01:09:09.064 --> 01:09:11.986]  So much has happened, but also five seconds ago at the same time.
[01:09:11.986 --> 01:09:15.609]  Where do you want to start first?
[01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:15.989]  I don't know.
[01:09:15.989 --> 01:09:18.431]  We're living in such a theater of the absurd.
[01:09:18.431 --> 01:09:20.853]  It's a target-rich environment, you know?
[01:09:20.853 --> 01:09:24.456]  I mean, you know, your point about ivermectin.
[01:09:24.456 --> 01:09:30.601]  Keep in mind, the FDA has told the Postal Service to interdict ivermectin at the border, destroy the packages.
[01:09:30.601 --> 01:09:34.664]  This is a drug that the WHO has on its list of most essential drugs.
[01:09:35.396 --> 01:09:36.836]  Are you kidding me?
[01:09:36.836 --> 01:09:55.981]  And it's clearly one of the largest studies or the largest study I think was just published from Brazil, 220,000 adults and it decreased, ivermectin decreased the risk of going down with this by I think death and going to hospital by 50%.
[01:09:55.981 --> 01:09:57.641]  So it just goes on and on.
[01:09:57.641 --> 01:10:03.663]  I mean there's lots of people that don't think there's peer-reviewed studies, there's peer-reviewed studies, there's unpeer-reviewed studies.
[01:10:04.292 --> 01:10:05.254]  It's everywhere.
[01:10:05.254 --> 01:10:11.725]  I mean, I wish the USPS would try to stop the fentanyl killing millions of people, but I guess they're not going to do that.
[01:10:11.725 --> 01:10:17.755]  A totally safe drug, they're not going to let evil Americans order that from outside countries, even if a doctor prescribes it.
[01:10:18.928 --> 01:10:19.609]  Right.
[01:10:19.609 --> 01:10:24.712]  And I told somebody jokingly, but it's actually kind of true, because they can't get it anywhere else.
[01:10:24.712 --> 01:10:26.994]  It's hard to order it from overseas pharmacies.
[01:10:26.994 --> 01:10:31.117]  I've been contacted by one of them, and they said all of their packages have been stopped.
[01:10:31.117 --> 01:10:32.017]  They can't bring them in.
[01:10:32.017 --> 01:10:33.919]  So this is confirmed multiple ways.
[01:10:33.919 --> 01:10:37.281]  But, you know, we think of mules bringing cocaine across the border.
[01:10:37.281 --> 01:10:40.223]  Now you can bring ivermectin and probably make a fortune.
[01:10:40.223 --> 01:10:41.624]  Isn't that sad?
[01:10:41.624 --> 01:10:42.284]  Absolutely.
[01:10:42.284 --> 01:10:44.286]  I mean, that's a great example, Doc.
[01:10:44.286 --> 01:10:45.807]  And please continue.
[01:10:46.795 --> 01:10:48.656]  Well, I was going to say, it doesn't stop here.
[01:10:48.656 --> 01:10:50.537]  I was just speaking in Ohio.
[01:10:50.537 --> 01:10:59.300]  In the great state of Ohio, doctors cannot prescribe azithromycin and doxycycline without worrying about somebody looking at their license.
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.441]  So they don't give more than one or two days for people.
[01:11:02.441 --> 01:11:08.404]  I said to a doctor there, I said, are you telling me we can't treat acne anymore with doxycycline?
[01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:09.685]  Thank you.
[01:11:28.939 --> 01:11:29.639]  Well, that's right.
[01:11:29.639 --> 01:11:32.840]  I mean, Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates said they want to depopulate us.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.661]  And it doesn't matter what all the science shows.
[01:11:34.661 --> 01:11:36.801]  It doesn't matter what the facts show.
[01:11:36.801 --> 01:11:42.663]  This is about these corporations, through big tech and through the media and through agencies of government, having total control.
[01:11:42.663 --> 01:11:44.464]  So, docs, slow down and repeat that.
[01:11:44.464 --> 01:11:45.684]  That's big news.
[01:11:45.684 --> 01:11:55.107]  And I know I've seen that in the news, confirming what you're saying, that some areas of the United States are now trying to block basic antibiotics for people that have lung infections.
[01:11:55.107 --> 01:11:56.327]  I mean, this is beyond criminal.
[01:11:58.044 --> 01:12:03.486]  Right, and in Ohio it was azithromycin and doxycycline.
[01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:11.288]  Now, we've used doxycycline for a lot of things, so it's a very safe drug and it's been used for, like dermatology used it.
[01:12:11.288 --> 01:12:15.610]  I took it multiple times for acne rosacea in my life.
[01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:16.730]  Come on, this isn't controversial, but
[01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:21.904]  There's a hold on it.
[01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:24.985]  Now, I will say this for people out there going to pharmacies.
[01:12:24.985 --> 01:12:27.585]  This is the reason to use independent pharmacies.
[01:12:27.585 --> 01:12:50.270]  The good news about independent pharmacies where the government's not getting too involved, they still will give out ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and these things, but you go to one of the chains and they've been told from on high not to prescribe it, even in states like mine where I practice, where there's no prohibition on using ivermectin.
[01:12:51.286 --> 01:12:53.908]  So, time to support your local pharmacies.
[01:12:53.908 --> 01:12:55.468]  That's a big deal right now.
[01:12:55.468 --> 01:12:59.331]  And again, it's Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the U.N.
[01:12:59.331 --> 01:13:00.992]  Whenever medical doctors or U.S.
[01:13:00.992 --> 01:13:12.038]  Senators, who are medical doctors like Rand Paul, try to give a speech about natural immunity being 27 times better than this Pfizer shot, they censor him on Google and YouTube and the Senate just puts up with that.
[01:13:12.038 --> 01:13:18.762]  I mean, imagine the level of this control of telling doctors what they can prescribe and telling Senators what they can say.
[01:13:20.393 --> 01:13:37.434]  Yeah, I mean the censorship isn't science and so we need to realize that it isn't that you know I started reading more about the tab of stock than about medicine these days because what we're dealing with is a huge mass mind control propaganda outbreak.
[01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:40.390]  We're not really dealing with a viral outbreak.
[01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:42.832]  It's taking us down.
[01:13:42.832 --> 01:13:51.220]  We've been under the impression that we could speak freely about medicine for a long time, but it turns out it hasn't been true for a long time.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:55.945]  The notion, I'll just point out, that one of the couple things got us here.
[01:13:55.945 --> 01:14:00.409]  One was Obamacare, which made it so difficult for private physicians to act
[01:14:01.308 --> 01:14:02.229]  Thank you for having me.
[01:14:14.841 --> 01:14:27.229]  But the other thing that we've been victim of is this idea that the only thing to listen to, we've taught all the new medical students and everybody, the only thing we can listen to is a 30-year double-blind peer-reviewed study.
[01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:32.093]  You know, peer review is the Politburo attached to medicine and science.
[01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:43.120]  You have three or five people on the top of some journal, I have my own experience with this in my profession, and they decide whether or not something gets published or not.
[01:14:43.638 --> 01:14:50.444]  Now, admittedly, there should be some kind of screening for some quality of, you know, language or whatever.
[01:14:50.444 --> 01:15:00.273]  But when you have a few people that decides on the basis of, for example, I had at one time, I had a publication that was submitted and the response I got from one of the reviewers was, everyone knows you can't do this.
[01:15:00.273 --> 01:15:01.634]  It was about a surgical procedure.
[01:15:01.634 --> 01:15:08.480]  But I thought that was a funny review after I spent a lot of time and money and energy putting together a very quality paper.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.842]  Everyone knows you can't do this.
[01:15:11.042 --> 01:15:15.211]  If you don't follow the narrative, then the peer reviewers don't publish.
[01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:19.681]  And the narrative can be controlled by funding the peer reviewers.
[01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:20.443]  That's pretty easy.
[01:15:20.967 --> 01:15:29.353]  You know, look at what Pfizer, you've probably seen that video, that all these news reports funded by Pfizer, you know, brought to you by Pfizer.
[01:15:29.353 --> 01:15:30.574]  It's just on and on.
[01:15:30.574 --> 01:15:34.057]  That's a total conflict of interest on its face, but they just ignore that.
[01:15:34.057 --> 01:15:36.739]  Now, Dr. Merritt, stay there, we're going to come back in the next segment.
[01:15:36.739 --> 01:15:40.462]  And speaking of them manipulating reviews and studies,
[01:15:41.002 --> 01:15:47.048]  We now know that Pfizer did indeed do that, and they tried to block, and now they want 75 years until it gets released.
[01:15:47.048 --> 01:15:54.334]  But the first group of that, or tranche, came out, and it was confirming everything you and others warned about over a year ago.
[01:15:54.334 --> 01:15:55.875]  We'll be right back with Dr. Lee Merritt.
[01:15:55.875 --> 01:15:56.276]  Stay with us.
[01:15:59.739 --> 01:16:07.204]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[01:16:07.204 --> 01:16:14.309]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with climate.
[01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:20.625]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[01:16:20.625 --> 01:16:23.406]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[01:16:23.406 --> 01:16:30.269]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[01:16:30.269 --> 01:16:31.650]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:41.699]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[01:16:41.699 --> 01:16:44.782]  They have weather control treaties from 1979.
[01:16:44.782 --> 01:16:48.425]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[01:16:48.425 --> 01:16:55.452]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[01:16:55.452 --> 01:16:57.214]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[01:16:59.051 --> 01:17:01.833]  Ultimate Bone Broth is back and better than ever.
[01:17:01.833 --> 01:17:06.476]  And 20% off, plus free shipping and double Patriot points for our new sale.
[01:17:06.476 --> 01:17:10.779]  After years of being off the shelves, we're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever.
[01:17:10.779 --> 01:17:13.601]  And it's now been reformulated and is even stronger.
[01:17:13.601 --> 01:17:15.462]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[01:17:16.142 --> 01:17:25.168]  It's got concentrated high-quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[01:17:25.168 --> 01:17:28.791]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:35.335]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[01:17:35.335 --> 01:17:37.276]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[01:17:37.276 --> 01:17:39.758]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[01:17:39.758 --> 01:17:44.661]  Again, it has that cutting-edge chicken broth protein isolate powder.
[01:17:44.941 --> 01:17:48.045]  Rarely in life you come upon something that is an absolute 360 win.
[01:18:04.924 --> 01:18:05.265]  I think so.
[01:18:19.841 --> 01:18:20.221]  Thank you.
[01:18:37.551 --> 01:18:38.612]  History is happening now.
[01:19:02.276 --> 01:19:19.961]  As we close out the year 2021 and accelerate into the critical year of 2022, it is so important to really meditate on the fact and let it sink in that we are in the middle of a globalist world government takeover whose endgame is forced depopulation.
[01:19:19.961 --> 01:19:27.183]  The death, the disease, the horror being caused by these GMO gene therapy shots is just the beginning.
[01:19:28.393 --> 01:19:33.194]  They are now accelerating a program that will collapse civilization.
[01:19:33.194 --> 01:19:35.775]  There's not much time left to turn this around.
[01:19:35.775 --> 01:19:44.858]  The globals are now getting a big cyber attack ready that they're going to launch, and again, blame on terrorists, and use as a pretext to further collapse civilization.
[01:19:44.858 --> 01:19:49.239]  Only being aware of this and only rallying against it now can back them off.
[01:19:49.239 --> 01:19:56.642]  Please, ladies and gentlemen, continue to spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and the live show, because you are the modern Paul Reveres.
[01:19:56.642 --> 01:19:57.922]  Without you, we're going to lose.
[01:19:59.938 --> 01:20:04.541]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:04.541 --> 01:20:12.186]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:12.186 --> 01:20:20.912]  Alright, Dr. Lee Merritt is our guest here and I really appreciate you coming on the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, December 14th broadcast.
[01:20:29.733 --> 01:20:36.232]  And it reminded me of why I think she's one of the most articulate, best people we've got out there fighting this tyranny is, she goes to the big picture.
[01:20:36.883 --> 01:20:57.477]  And I wanted to get in the nuts and bolts of where we are and what's coming next and Omicron and the rest of it, but you talked about Tavistock Institute, for those that don't know, MI6 connected behavioral psychology outfit, and the fact that they admit they hired militaries around the world with the Tavistock Institute to engage in fear-mongering and even use terms like brainwashing.
[01:20:57.477 --> 01:20:58.477]  This isn't our opinion.
[01:20:58.477 --> 01:21:01.319]  This is MKUltra stuff on the mass scale.
[01:21:01.319 --> 01:21:02.880]  And so you're a medical doctor.
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.882]  Speaking about that, what is the big picture?
[01:21:05.602 --> 01:21:18.048]  And is it the way to beat this, not to argue every point of their lies and every new variant, but to argue the fact of they're using this for their global government takeover, the Build Back Better Great Reset?
[01:21:20.397 --> 01:21:21.157]  I think so.
[01:21:21.157 --> 01:21:23.318]  You can get down in the weeds and get lost.
[01:21:23.318 --> 01:21:38.821]  And I think the point here is, I mean, just look, just looking at these variants, the guy without being prejudiced and confused by an inadequate medical or scientific education that we were all given, you just look at this and you say, is this really crazy?
[01:21:38.821 --> 01:21:40.481]  I mean, come on, can they make up?
[01:21:40.481 --> 01:21:42.822]  This sounds like a made up story.
[01:21:42.822 --> 01:21:48.063]  We've got all these countries that are highly vaccinated, that are having the highest rate of outbreak.
[01:21:48.519 --> 01:22:00.608]  On the other hand, the lowest countries, like they come out with a news story saying, South Africa, surprisingly low number of cases, even though they only have 6% of people vaccinated or something like that.
[01:22:00.608 --> 01:22:12.056]  I mean, the average guy would make the conclusion that if more vaccination means more disease, then maybe we should stop vaccinating, that the vaccine may be causing the disease.
[01:22:12.056 --> 01:22:14.839]  But no, we have to come out with variants.
[01:22:14.839 --> 01:22:16.500]  I mean, it's just too...
[01:22:17.523 --> 01:22:19.605]  It's just too obvious.
[01:22:19.605 --> 01:22:21.226]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:22:21.226 --> 01:22:22.628]  They've thought this out.
[01:22:22.628 --> 01:22:24.389]  I will tell you the other thing I looked at.
[01:22:24.389 --> 01:22:28.553]  I looked at the 1918 history of the pandemic back then.
[01:22:28.553 --> 01:22:32.216]  And you know, there were really four things that happened then.
[01:22:32.216 --> 01:22:33.557]  And most people don't realize this.
[01:22:33.557 --> 01:22:40.063]  I was never taught this in medical school, that they could not prove transmission of influenza.
[01:22:40.063 --> 01:22:42.906]  You know, we've had all this stuff come out now that just
[01:22:43.878 --> 01:22:47.262]  Makes it you realize that there's I'm not saying there's nothing there.
[01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:56.233]  There's something that's killing people But there is a huge psychological operation this this that's driving a kind of overlay over that
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:01.601]  And even when you look at what's killing people, we don't know a lot about it.
[01:23:01.601 --> 01:23:01.861]  Why?
[01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:03.981]  We've been told not to do autopsies.
[01:23:03.981 --> 01:23:06.022]  There are very few autopsies out there.
[01:23:06.022 --> 01:23:13.103]  I pulled all the autopsies I could find since last year, and there were 74 from around the world of COVID deaths.
[01:23:13.103 --> 01:23:17.904]  And you know, they're telling us we have a horrible virus that's giving us this viral pneumonia and we're dying, right?
[01:23:17.904 --> 01:23:21.905]  Guess what the one diagnosis is I didn't find in any of those autopsies?
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.021]  Viral pneumonia.
[01:23:24.021 --> 01:23:25.761]  You would think it would be there.
[01:23:25.761 --> 01:23:26.261]  No.
[01:23:26.261 --> 01:23:30.783]  But the one thing that is there is microvascular clotting in everyone.
[01:23:30.783 --> 01:23:32.644]  So something is happening.
[01:23:32.644 --> 01:23:35.345]  We've been prohibited from scientifically evaluating it.
[01:23:35.345 --> 01:23:38.166]  We've been prohibited from treating it correctly.
[01:23:38.166 --> 01:23:39.126]  We've been censored.
[01:23:39.946 --> 01:23:47.028]  I mean, does that sound like a nation or a medical system that really wants to help us figure this out and treat people?
[01:23:47.028 --> 01:23:53.010]  Oh, I should have meant they're killing people with protocols that they don't change in the ICU.
[01:23:53.010 --> 01:23:53.390]  That's right.
[01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:56.051]  They know sending sick people to nursing homes kills.
[01:23:56.051 --> 01:24:00.512]  They know putting people on intubators and not giving them any type of treatment kills them.
[01:24:00.512 --> 01:24:03.253]  And they still are doing it now as we prepare to enter year three.
[01:24:04.597 --> 01:24:05.477]  Right.
[01:24:05.477 --> 01:24:09.099]  And listen to what Michael Yadin just said about the midazolam.
[01:24:09.099 --> 01:24:17.362]  In his mind, the midazolam, and I can't check all the things he has, you know, he's... But it's on record, it makes sure he can't breathe.
[01:24:17.362 --> 01:24:18.563]  It's an assisted suicide drug.
[01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:30.827]  Right, the midazolam, and his point was they stockpiled it before 2020 and then they strategically released it and started using it at a time to boost the death numbers.
[01:24:30.827 --> 01:24:34.911]  That's right, this is a giant, so what you're getting at is it's what Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates want, depopulation.
[01:24:35.351 --> 01:24:36.313]  And this is their rollout.
[01:24:36.313 --> 01:24:48.110]  The murder of Western medicine, the murder of logic, the murder of free speech, getting all their minions in place, purging the military and police and hospitals of people that will ask questions before they roll out something far deadlier.
[01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:51.455]  If I war game it, that's the main scenario I see, doctor.
[01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:58.170]  It's fear that's driving people to do things they would not do in a normal situation.
[01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:03.516]  I mean, look, most people would have researched this vaccine that was experimental.
[01:25:03.516 --> 01:25:06.639]  When the word experimental came out, it should have been a red flag.
[01:25:06.639 --> 01:25:10.123]  Oh, maybe I should wait and not be the first person on the block to get this.
[01:25:10.123 --> 01:25:11.145]  But that isn't what happened.
[01:25:11.565 --> 01:25:29.960]  People that I respect that are smart, intelligent people that would have looked at Carfax before buying a used car, ran out and got a vaccine that's never been with a new technology, never really made it through animal testing, completely unknown elements in the vaccine.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:35.105]  Even your doctors don't know what's in it because they don't have to tell us under emergency use authorization.
[01:25:35.105 --> 01:25:37.166]  And they went out and got this.
[01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:40.369]  And here's the point that I've been making to people about this vaccine.
[01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.349]  It's
[01:25:51.056 --> 01:25:53.898]  They've agreed this doesn't decrease transmission.
[01:25:53.898 --> 01:25:57.720]  It just may, in the EUA, it may decrease symptoms a bit.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.240]  Well, that's a therapeutic agent.
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:07.285]  That's not able to be mandated in any real, I mean, that would be like mandating a blood pressure medicine rather than another one.
[01:26:07.285 --> 01:26:08.265]  You can't do that.
[01:26:08.265 --> 01:26:11.247]  And so they've mislabeled things.
[01:26:11.247 --> 01:26:12.908]  They've lied to us about these things.
[01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:22.834]  And at the end of time, people went out and they were so afraid by all the confusion and the isolation, everything happening, that they took this vaccine without really knowing much about it.
[01:26:22.834 --> 01:26:28.057]  And now we have numbers coming out that, as some of us predicted, are not good numbers.
[01:26:28.277 --> 01:26:29.378]  Well, that's what I was about to say.
[01:26:29.378 --> 01:26:31.961]  We're having massive more numbers of deaths.
[01:26:31.961 --> 01:26:33.383]  The hospitals this year are actually full.
[01:26:33.383 --> 01:26:34.624]  They weren't last year.
[01:26:34.624 --> 01:26:40.951]  And they admitted, the German and British News, I don't even hide it, that you're twice as likely to be in the hospital or die if you've had the shot.
[01:26:40.951 --> 01:26:43.794]  And their answer is more shots, even though they don't protect you.
[01:26:43.794 --> 01:26:44.695]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:26:45.805 --> 01:26:46.846]  Right.
[01:26:46.846 --> 01:26:53.492]  It's, again, you know, if people weren't afraid, I think they would look at this more realistically.
[01:26:53.492 --> 01:26:55.214]  But they're being afraid.
[01:26:55.214 --> 01:27:03.181]  And part of it is, of course, the nonstop propaganda on television that doesn't tell you, and the mainstream media, that doesn't tell you the truth about this.
[01:27:03.181 --> 01:27:04.822]  So is it this really an IQ test?
[01:27:04.822 --> 01:27:07.164]  The globalist clan, they want to get rid of dumb people.
[01:27:07.164 --> 01:27:09.126]  I don't agree with doing that.
[01:27:09.126 --> 01:27:12.089]  But this really is Darwin Awards here.
[01:27:13.692 --> 01:27:16.096]  Well, some of the smartest people I know ran out and got this.
[01:27:16.096 --> 01:27:19.201]  I mean, it's hard to believe, but they sure understand they go under Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:27:19.201 --> 01:27:21.083]  Plus, the children don't deserve this.
[01:27:21.083 --> 01:27:21.945]  The children don't deserve it.
[01:27:22.938 --> 01:27:27.319]  Yeah, and that's the point about the Tavistock Institute and Mass Mind Control.
[01:27:27.319 --> 01:27:28.839]  This is a scientific study.
[01:27:28.839 --> 01:27:29.900]  They know how to do this.
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:35.041]  They know how to push our buttons and make normal people not be acting normally.
[01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:39.022]  I really think that's a major component here.
[01:27:39.022 --> 01:27:45.203]  The other thing I always worry about is that as we're looking one direction, what are they doing the other direction?
[01:27:45.203 --> 01:27:46.423]  That's the other thing.
[01:27:46.423 --> 01:27:49.464]  And that's the reason I wanted to get you on in a longer segment that's coming up.
[01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.164]  Start now, Doctor.
[01:27:51.694 --> 01:27:52.314]  Exactly.
[01:27:52.314 --> 01:27:54.135]  You're a smart lady, big picture.
[01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:57.476]  What are you expecting them to pull next?
[01:27:57.476 --> 01:27:59.136]  Well, I think they're already pulling it.
[01:27:59.136 --> 01:28:05.038]  I'm starting to see people that are younger people that are getting sick with something.
[01:28:05.038 --> 01:28:05.978]  Okay.
[01:28:05.978 --> 01:28:16.561]  And, but if you look at the, at what we know about, for example, electromagnetic frequency toxicity, it's indistinguishable from COVID, from what they call COVID.
[01:28:17.748 --> 01:28:21.395]  The idea is we don't have an isolate of the virus.
[01:28:21.395 --> 01:28:22.778]  We're being told there's a virus.
[01:28:22.778 --> 01:28:24.141]  We're being told it's airborne.
[01:28:24.141 --> 01:28:26.145]  We're being told a lot of things that are not proven.
[01:28:27.179 --> 01:28:36.886]  But we do know something about electromagnetic frequency and the history behind the pandemic of 1918, various flu pandemics in the past.
[01:28:36.886 --> 01:28:37.206]  That's right.
[01:28:37.206 --> 01:28:42.190]  We know when new type of radiations are released, it's that at first our bodies aren't used to it.
[01:28:42.190 --> 01:28:43.250]  Plagues are connected to that.
[01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:47.413]  And now you're talking about major studies when we come back that just broke this week.
[01:28:47.413 --> 01:28:49.575]  Major studies by prestigious groups confirming
[01:28:50.116 --> 01:28:54.826]  That 5G radiation is causing symptoms identical to COVID-19.
[01:28:54.826 --> 01:28:56.530]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:28:56.530 --> 01:28:57.152]  This is proven.
[01:28:57.152 --> 01:28:57.532]  Stay with us.
[01:29:00.302 --> 01:29:04.664]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[01:29:04.664 --> 01:29:13.007]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[01:29:13.007 --> 01:29:16.548]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[01:29:16.548 --> 01:29:25.132]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[01:29:25.912 --> 01:29:32.598]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[01:29:32.598 --> 01:29:44.269]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[01:29:44.269 --> 01:29:46.231]  You will then be my slaves.
[01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:51.650]  And then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:57.721]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:02.514]  This is a great sponsor.

[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:34.060]  These aren't.
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:36.020]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:40.801]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, 150 minutes.

[01:30:44.442 --> 01:30:45.742]  And I keep one in my car.
[01:30:45.742 --> 01:30:47.443]  I've given them to my parents as gifts.
[01:30:47.443 --> 01:30:49.983]  Way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[01:30:49.983 --> 01:30:52.124]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.

[01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:34.791]  Going back to Dr. Lee Merritt, got interrupted
[01:34:35.678 --> 01:34:53.108]  By the break and you were getting into the Tavistock Institute and the mind control and then there's a Gregg Reese report that I'll put on screen that has the different medical studies that came out years ago about 5G before COVID came out and then currently in the new ones that it indeed pushes oxygen out of the blood and causes other effects.
[01:34:53.108 --> 01:34:57.550]  Scientific study concludes that 5G exacerbated COVID.
[01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:59.692]  That just broke and you were going there doctor.
[01:34:59.692 --> 01:35:00.272]  Please continue.
[01:35:02.034 --> 01:35:04.096]  Well, yeah, we know how this works.
[01:35:04.096 --> 01:35:09.080]  I mean, it's not that we haven't looked at the science.
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:21.069]  What happens is, when you're in an electromagnetic field, your metabolism depends on your being able to have an electron transport chain in your mitochondria.
[01:35:21.069 --> 01:35:22.050]  The mitochondria are the little
[01:35:22.751 --> 01:35:28.496]  Parts of your cells, they're like your furnaces, they would produce power from food.
[01:35:28.496 --> 01:35:37.084]  And when you disrupt that electron chain ever so slightly, you disrupt your ability to optimally metabolize food.
[01:35:37.084 --> 01:35:42.949]  And that's essentially what happens if you're toxic from radiofrequency radiation, non-ionizing radiation.
[01:35:43.635 --> 01:35:53.859]  Now, it's interesting that when you go back to, and I have, my family is filled with electrical engineers and they all think I'm a little nuts because they're working in the macro environment.
[01:35:53.859 --> 01:36:03.602]  But it's true that we're dealing with micro currents and nano, you know, very, very small currents that are going through that are causing this.
[01:36:03.602 --> 01:36:06.263]  It's not, it doesn't take a lot.
[01:36:06.263 --> 01:36:08.544]  In 1918, it's very interesting.
[01:36:08.544 --> 01:36:11.825]  I mentioned earlier, they never proved transmission of the
[01:36:12.797 --> 01:36:13.717]  A flu.
[01:36:13.717 --> 01:36:26.841]  They tried, I mean, they did even things like taking, and I apologize the term snot, but that's not a technical medical term, but you know what it is, the goobers from your nose and your lungs, and they put it into healthy people, they couldn't get them sick.
[01:36:26.841 --> 01:36:37.985]  They also literally spun that stuff down, tried to purify it, essentially make it so if there were a small particle in there, it'd be concentrated, and injected it into volunteers, and they didn't get the flu.
[01:36:37.985 --> 01:36:39.966]  Horses came down with this, but they couldn't be
[01:36:41.696 --> 01:36:43.697]  They couldn't transmit it from horse to horse.
[01:36:43.697 --> 01:36:44.637]  So what was going on?
[01:36:44.637 --> 01:36:47.658]  Well, it's interesting that we call it the Spanish Flu.
[01:36:47.658 --> 01:36:48.378]  Why do we do that?
[01:36:48.378 --> 01:36:50.079]  Because it didn't start in Spain.
[01:36:50.079 --> 01:36:52.039]  It started in Fort Riley, Kansas.
[01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.580]  And what was happening there?
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:37:01.622]  Well, we were training a group of Army guys to go overseas, and among those were telegraphers, the people that are learning to do Morse code.
[01:37:01.622 --> 01:37:04.643]  And it was the first time that humans were really around
[01:37:06.431 --> 01:37:09.514]  Interrupted electrical signals, alternating currents.
[01:37:09.514 --> 01:37:14.618]  And what happened is, even before that, we called it telegrapher's disease.
[01:37:14.618 --> 01:37:18.441]  Telegram operators, as soon as the lines went up, started getting sick.
[01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:22.004]  Not necessarily dying, but they were getting sick around the world.
[01:37:22.004 --> 01:37:24.927]  And so in 1918, four things came together.
[01:37:24.927 --> 01:37:28.469]  We had the telegraphers being trained in Fort Riley, Kansas.
[01:37:28.469 --> 01:37:33.554]  It's the first time that we gave our military a battery of vaccines before they went overseas.
[01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:47.257]  We had a drug that was being given inappropriately, it was called aspirin, and Bayer and aspirin had lost their patent and were convincing doctors through the AMA to use it whenever there was a fever.
[01:37:47.257 --> 01:37:57.062]  We have a lot of these memory books from 1918 that show doctors just pushing handfuls of aspirin into these young recruits that were sick with the so-called flu.
[01:37:59.381 --> 01:38:11.287]  Ultimately, we sent out a pathologist, William Welch, from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, who did autopsies on these people in 1918, and what he found was bloody lungs, that they were bleeding into their lungs.
[01:38:11.287 --> 01:38:15.569]  Again, inflammation and aspirin overdose explains some of this.
[01:38:15.569 --> 01:38:21.312]  A lot of people died, but it's interesting who it was and then when it went overseas, think what we also did.
[01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:28.016]  We also vaccinated our overseas people and we took over the telegram
[01:38:28.556 --> 01:38:42.054]  And Dr. Merrick, let me just back up what you're saying, because I've been studying this long before this even happened, and I know you have, and this is mainline medical research.
[01:38:42.054 --> 01:38:45.198]  What you're saying isn't like something Kooks came up with, and here's the difference.
[01:38:45.578 --> 01:39:00.591]  They argue, well the sun is this giant electromagnetic microwave, but it comes up gradually, it goes down gradually, and it's based on when we go to bed, when we get up, we've got to have it in our skin to live, and yeah, it gives us cancer actually in the end.
[01:39:00.591 --> 01:39:02.633]  So we need it to live, but it also kills us.
[01:39:02.633 --> 01:39:03.734]  It's what makes the plants grow.
[01:39:03.734 --> 01:39:07.017]  We're in a high level of electromagnetic radiation.
[01:39:07.017 --> 01:39:11.321]  But what I've read from the studies is, they've done this with ants, with birds, and with plants.
[01:39:11.781 --> 01:39:12.242]  We're good to go.
[01:39:27.279 --> 01:39:27.379]  It's
[01:39:45.689 --> 01:39:48.131]  Billions of changes an hour.
[01:39:48.131 --> 01:39:49.792]  All these different fields.
[01:39:49.792 --> 01:39:52.514]  All of this then causing issues inside the cells.
[01:39:52.514 --> 01:39:57.057]  Then you add a new pathogen to that and it can cause all sorts of strange mutations.
[01:39:57.057 --> 01:39:58.398]  That's my layperson's read.
[01:39:58.398 --> 01:39:58.998]  Is that accurate?
[01:39:59.964 --> 01:40:03.407]  I think that's pretty close.
[01:40:03.407 --> 01:40:06.669]  The Canon's Law of the Body we learned in medical school.
[01:40:06.669 --> 01:40:09.472]  It says the body responds to rate of change.
[01:40:09.472 --> 01:40:14.235]  So if something is gentle and it starts slowly, you can adapt to it to some degree.
[01:40:14.235 --> 01:40:15.216]  But you're right.
[01:40:15.216 --> 01:40:17.578]  When it keeps flicking on and off, it's hard.
[01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:19.920]  And that's what happened when you bring up the sun.
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:25.284]  You know, most people don't realize that before the telegram lines were laid, we didn't have seasonal influenza.
[01:40:25.948 --> 01:40:29.471]  Influenza was something that had a worldwide outburst.
[01:40:29.471 --> 01:40:31.953]  Influenza comes from the word to influence.
[01:40:31.953 --> 01:40:36.616]  Nobody knew what it was from, but they knew that periodically, back into the 1500s and 1700s,
[01:40:39.801 --> 01:40:40.161]  Boom!
[01:40:40.161 --> 01:40:45.422]  There'd be an outbreak all around the world, and then it would be absent for decades.
[01:40:45.422 --> 01:40:46.703]  And then it would happen again.
[01:40:46.703 --> 01:40:52.824]  And it turned out a very smart astronomer, I think from Winnipeg, looked back at this and said, it correlates with sunspot activity.
[01:40:52.824 --> 01:40:53.604]  So do wars!
[01:40:53.604 --> 01:40:54.364]  So do wars!
[01:40:54.364 --> 01:41:00.226]  I mean, like even Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs, they're all obsessed with sunspots in their own literature.
[01:41:00.226 --> 01:41:01.026]  They know this is real.
[01:41:02.150 --> 01:41:07.858]  Yeah, so there's a lot of things happening here, and so I don't believe it's all psychological operation.
[01:41:07.858 --> 01:41:14.687]  I personally think, even the mainstream media has come to the belief that the spike protein was manipulated.
[01:41:14.687 --> 01:41:19.154]  It's genetic material taken from nature, taken into labs, manipulated to harm people.
[01:41:19.594 --> 01:41:21.356]  So, by definition, that's a bioweapon.
[01:41:21.356 --> 01:41:30.423]  Now, keep in mind, if that's a bioweapon, when your body produces the same spike protein, having been given this RNA or DNA vaccine, it's also a bioweapon.
[01:41:30.423 --> 01:41:32.004]  I totally agree, Dr. Merritt.
[01:41:32.004 --> 01:41:33.885]  So, what do you think they're really doing?
[01:41:33.885 --> 01:41:36.888]  Because, obviously, multiple injections was always pre-planned.
[01:41:36.888 --> 01:41:38.989]  They admit it, so now they say it's permanent.
[01:41:38.989 --> 01:41:41.712]  You were on the show years ago saying that was going to come.
[01:41:41.712 --> 01:41:42.953]  This is clearly a plan now.
[01:41:42.953 --> 01:41:43.613]  We now know that.
[01:41:43.613 --> 01:41:45.555]  Where's the plan go?
[01:41:45.555 --> 01:41:48.517]  I think it goes, I think the 5G is part of the endgame.
[01:41:49.518 --> 01:41:50.259]  I really do.
[01:41:50.259 --> 01:41:54.222]  I think that they're distracting us with all the, everything else.
[01:41:54.222 --> 01:41:59.666]  And quite frankly, I feel confident that we are going to master the disease process.
[01:41:59.666 --> 01:42:09.833]  Right now, we could be saving a lot more people if we, if people would put things in their homes like nebulizers, pulse oximeters, stock up on ivermectin that they won't let us do, stock up on these things.
[01:42:09.833 --> 01:42:13.716]  We could probably solve 90% of this or more.
[01:42:13.716 --> 01:42:16.458]  We always are going to have disease among humans.
[01:42:16.458 --> 01:42:18.019]  They're trying to stop us fixing the problem.
[01:42:19.838 --> 01:42:20.779]  I was fixing the problem.
[01:42:20.779 --> 01:42:24.441]  While we're so concentrated on this, what else is going on?
[01:42:24.441 --> 01:42:26.683]  I can't prove this, but what else is going on?
[01:42:26.683 --> 01:42:32.708]  They're putting the 5G in, they're collapsing the borders, they're destroying the dollar, they're getting ready for the cyber attack.
[01:42:32.708 --> 01:42:34.049]  Yeah, activating this.
[01:42:34.049 --> 01:42:47.479]  And I've heard, you know, a friend of mine who's a researcher was sent some video from China that claimed that the Chinese, it's a leak apparently, I've got it on my telegram, she's got it on hers, Lin Fen.
[01:42:49.112 --> 01:42:55.216]  It's Chinese talking about how their goal is to vaccinate all our military, and then they've won.
[01:42:55.216 --> 01:42:55.756]  No, that's right.
[01:42:55.756 --> 01:42:57.037]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[01:42:57.037 --> 01:42:58.598]  Stay with us.

[01:43:58.098 --> 01:44:02.422]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[01:44:02.422 --> 01:44:13.030]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:19.235]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:19.235 --> 01:44:27.322]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only improve your quality of sleep, but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[01:44:27.762 --> 01:44:37.452]  Many competitors' sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[01:44:37.452 --> 01:44:45.480]  It uses a unique, quick-release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:49.764]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[01:44:49.764 --> 01:44:51.025]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[01:44:51.025 --> 01:44:54.968]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[01:44:54.968 --> 01:44:55.448]  But we failed.
[01:44:55.448 --> 01:44:56.629]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[01:45:13.243 --> 01:45:21.109]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational de-industrialization Great Reset.
[01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:30.035]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[01:45:30.035 --> 01:45:35.239]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[01:45:35.239 --> 01:45:38.141]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storable food.
[01:45:38.141 --> 01:45:40.963]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[01:45:41.603 --> 01:45:42.484]  We're good to go.
[01:45:58.015 --> 01:46:00.657]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[01:46:00.657 --> 01:46:01.557]  They're here.
[01:46:01.557 --> 01:46:05.879]  All over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[01:46:05.879 --> 01:46:16.285]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases actually, taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[01:46:16.285 --> 01:46:24.490]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[01:46:24.850 --> 01:46:26.652]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[01:46:26.652 --> 01:46:34.461]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[01:46:34.461 --> 01:46:37.825]  government military grade, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:37.825 --> 01:46:43.611]  We have the entire line of Silent Pocket ready to ship to you when you visit InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:43.611 --> 01:46:45.013]  Again, we have big backpacks,
[01:46:45.333 --> 01:46:46.874]  We have special dry bags.
[01:46:46.874 --> 01:46:48.156]  We've got them for cell phones.
[01:46:48.156 --> 01:46:49.797]  We've got them for laptops.
[01:46:49.797 --> 01:46:50.738]  We've got them for iPads.
[01:46:50.738 --> 01:46:53.340]  It's all there at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:47:00.586]  So protect your privacy today and support the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:47:00.586 --> 01:47:06.492]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:20.311 --> 01:47:26.392]  Dr. Lee Merritt's our guest, and I've got to do a commercial-free podcast soon with her so she can really roll and go through all this.
[01:47:26.392 --> 01:47:31.613]  You know, I got Dr. Peter McCullough on Joe Rogan, and they're saying that's going to be his biggest interview yet.
[01:47:31.613 --> 01:47:36.474]  It may even break records that I set and that Elon Musk set to be the number one podcast he's ever done.
[01:47:36.474 --> 01:47:42.456]  It's over 20 million people just on one platform so far, 40 million total as of last night.
[01:47:42.456 --> 01:47:46.957]  So that's very exciting news, and Joe Rogan kept asking him, why are they doing this?
[01:47:46.957 --> 01:47:48.457]  And Dr. McCullough doesn't want to
[01:47:48.837 --> 01:47:49.837]  Go that extra mile.
[01:47:49.837 --> 01:47:50.117]  I get it.
[01:47:50.117 --> 01:47:50.757]  He's a doctor.
[01:47:50.757 --> 01:47:52.618]  He's been an FDA scientist.
[01:47:52.618 --> 01:47:56.119]  He doesn't want to speculate, but this is political at the end of the day.
[01:47:56.119 --> 01:47:57.679]  It's about a takeover.
[01:47:57.679 --> 01:47:59.780]  It's about depopulation.
[01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:03.741]  So, Dr. Lee Merritt, I want to thank you so much for being here with us today.
[01:48:03.741 --> 01:48:05.641]  I've got a few more questions for you.
[01:48:05.641 --> 01:48:10.002]  And again, please come back on a commercial-free show because an hour is then uninterrupted.
[01:48:10.002 --> 01:48:13.443]  But what else do you want to impart to the listeners and viewers of this show?
[01:48:15.618 --> 01:48:24.305]  Well, you know, J. Edgar Hoover one time said that the individual's handicapped by coming face-to-face with a conspiracy so monstrous that he cannot believe it exists.
[01:48:24.305 --> 01:48:29.630]  That's part of what's happening here, the biggest lie we've ever been involved with.
[01:48:29.630 --> 01:48:34.333]  And it's engendering fear, and fear is, that's what's going to take us down.
[01:48:35.334 --> 01:48:39.339]  I think there are really four things we need to do to get out of this.
[01:48:39.339 --> 01:48:47.329]  The first thing is people need to turn off their TV and movies because it's used for predictive programming and outright propaganda.
[01:48:47.329 --> 01:48:47.849]  It really is.
[01:48:47.849 --> 01:48:53.496]  I mean, you cannot look at the numbers scientifically and then look at what they're telling you and make any sense of it.
[01:48:55.103 --> 01:49:01.407]  And everybody needs to get into this fight now, because first of all, purpose in life is a great antidote to fear.
[01:49:01.407 --> 01:49:09.732]  But next, the second point is, is that when 5G is fully implemented, if that really is the point, it's a directive energy weapon.
[01:49:09.732 --> 01:49:11.453]  That's what it was designed for.
[01:49:11.453 --> 01:49:13.354]  And we're going to have to take this on.
[01:49:13.354 --> 01:49:18.477]  We can't just sit by because it will come into our homes.
[01:49:18.477 --> 01:49:20.638]  And by the way, we found a bunch of CIA documents.
[01:49:20.638 --> 01:49:22.279]  We covered my reset wars piece.
[01:49:22.859 --> 01:49:27.447]  Where they were admitting decades ago they were going to put up towers for mind control to control the populace.
[01:49:27.447 --> 01:49:32.576]  Of course, that's the logical extension of control freak bureaucrats and mad scientists given unlimited power.
[01:49:34.409 --> 01:49:42.798]  Yeah, I mean, you know, 5G was used for a directive energy weapon and it was a denial of access weapon in places like Iraq.
[01:49:42.798 --> 01:49:49.545]  You turn on 5G, you turn up enough power, you hit the right frequency, and it resonates with everybody's hair follicles.
[01:49:49.545 --> 01:49:52.267]  So it makes you feel like you're completely on fire.
[01:49:52.267 --> 01:49:53.228]  Oh, that's the next thing.
[01:49:53.228 --> 01:49:56.652]  Everybody's talking about their hair falling out in the 5G areas.
[01:49:58.143 --> 01:50:00.844]  Yeah, I don't know what to make of that.
[01:50:00.844 --> 01:50:02.065]  That's been a problem.
[01:50:02.065 --> 01:50:07.067]  I think what happens is it can be from being just from being sick can do it.
[01:50:07.067 --> 01:50:10.068]  But I agree with you that there's a lot of suspicious things.
[01:50:10.068 --> 01:50:13.210]  Another one, pink urine, believe it or not.
[01:50:13.210 --> 01:50:19.753]  That's one of the things it turns out people that are more sensitive to electrical magnetic frequency toxicity
[01:50:20.453 --> 01:50:25.494]  They have a defect in their porphyrin manufacturing, what makes hemoglobin.
[01:50:25.494 --> 01:50:30.236]  And one of the ways it shows up is you have pink urine sometimes.
[01:50:30.236 --> 01:50:41.979]  And by the way, shows like Better Call Saul and the rest of it make fun of people that talk about this, but you can type in cell phone towers or 5G cancer and get prestigious reports going back decades.
[01:50:41.979 --> 01:50:44.220]  What we're talking about is not debatable.
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:47.840]  The fact is what is in your cell phone is the same thing in a microwave oven.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:49.581]  The difference is a microwave oven is shielded.
[01:50:51.207 --> 01:50:52.768]  Right, and it's not completely shielded.
[01:50:52.768 --> 01:50:53.268]  You're right.
[01:50:53.268 --> 01:50:56.589]  That's why they tell you to be careful when you've got pacemakers.
[01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:58.089]  And what are they telling you with the new iPhone?
[01:50:58.089 --> 01:51:01.630]  Be careful if you don't buy one if you have a new pacemaker.
[01:51:01.630 --> 01:51:08.913]  Yeah, neurosurgeons know about this and they, the same, you know who controls you when you know whom you cannot criticize.
[01:51:08.913 --> 01:51:16.775]  And the telecommunications industry has the same indemnity from lawsuit that the vaccine industry does.
[01:51:16.775 --> 01:51:19.216]  And anybody, and that's the point, every time
[01:51:19.956 --> 01:51:23.017]  You know, I've been in medicine for 45 years.
[01:51:23.017 --> 01:51:28.318]  I've actually been instrumental in taking a drug off the market that was not a good drug.
[01:51:28.318 --> 01:51:34.139]  And when Vioxx came out, after three weeks, I recognized it wasn't a good drug.
[01:51:34.139 --> 01:51:36.540]  It took the FDA three years to take it off.
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:44.881]  But when I started speaking against Vioxx, nobody said, oh, that's one of those crazy COX-2 inhibitor, you know, non blah, blah, blah.
[01:51:44.881 --> 01:51:48.142]  No, but you don't like one vaccine and suddenly you're an anti-vaxxer.
[01:51:49.287 --> 01:51:52.049]  And, you know, you're a tinfoil hat if you speak against 5G.
[01:51:52.049 --> 01:51:55.150]  I think that we see a pattern here.
[01:51:55.150 --> 01:51:56.691]  The answer is not to argue the science.
[01:51:56.691 --> 01:52:00.113]  The answer is to demonize the people speaking out.
[01:52:00.113 --> 01:52:09.137]  And this one, everybody better wake up to, because it's not by accident that this is happening altogether, I think.
[01:52:09.137 --> 01:52:10.398]  It should tell you something.
[01:52:10.398 --> 01:52:15.981]  I think it's in Haifa, Israel, that the, wherever Technion is, I think it's Haifa, but they've
[01:52:17.370 --> 01:52:19.995]  Gotten the Wi-Fi out of their schools, why did they do that?
[01:52:19.995 --> 01:52:29.294]  Because they realized, just what you were showing on that graph, that children's body mass makes them more susceptible to damage from Wi-Fi.
[01:52:30.331 --> 01:52:32.373]  And so they hardwired their schools.
[01:52:32.373 --> 01:52:36.617]  I read that and I went home and told my husband we had a hardwire house.
[01:52:36.617 --> 01:52:38.719]  You know, I had my house totally hardwired.
[01:52:38.719 --> 01:52:43.083]  And then, you know, you catch family members hiding wireless transmitters doing it.
[01:52:43.083 --> 01:52:43.664]  Absolutely.
[01:52:43.664 --> 01:52:44.745]  I mean, we have the answer.
[01:52:44.745 --> 01:52:47.067]  It's called wiring things like in a gun.
[01:52:47.067 --> 01:52:48.008]  A gun has a tube.
[01:52:48.008 --> 01:52:49.429]  You fire it one place.
[01:52:49.429 --> 01:52:51.771]  You don't have it where it explodes in all directions.
[01:52:51.771 --> 01:52:54.674]  We need directed energy, not directed energy at us.
[01:52:56.423 --> 01:52:57.023]  Right.
[01:52:57.023 --> 01:53:01.325]  And I hope my husband who's an IT guy is listening to this because I had the same issue.
[01:53:01.325 --> 01:53:02.506]  Family members hide these.
[01:53:02.506 --> 01:53:04.087]  And I went around.
[01:53:04.087 --> 01:53:07.608]  Unfortunately, the 5G, you cannot test with meters at this point.
[01:53:07.608 --> 01:53:11.210]  But you can test the lesser cellular frequencies.
[01:53:11.210 --> 01:53:18.153]  And it turned out that, you know, when you go around, I kept saying, there's got to be something under my chair or where my office is.
[01:53:18.153 --> 01:53:21.335]  And I found it was a router that we had stashed.
[01:53:21.335 --> 01:53:24.896]  Oh, listen, when my ex-wife was divorcing me, I had to live in a condo for a while.
[01:53:24.896 --> 01:53:25.917]  It was this big high-rise.
[01:53:26.657 --> 01:53:28.758]  And I'm not a person that's paranoid.
[01:53:28.758 --> 01:53:30.779]  I'm not a person that has trouble sleeping.
[01:53:30.779 --> 01:53:33.280]  And I couldn't sleep in this room.
[01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:34.740]  So when I slept in another room, I could.
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:35.580]  I've always slept good.
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:39.622]  And I finally realized there was a giant wireless router in the closet right behind the bed.
[01:53:39.622 --> 01:53:43.503]  Turned that sucker off, had them hardwired, slept great for the two years I lived there.
[01:53:43.503 --> 01:53:47.165]  But I mean, if something's messing my sleep up, I know something's going on.
[01:53:47.165 --> 01:53:50.386]  And it's because it's flicking on and off, and it's sending a charge through my brain.
[01:53:50.386 --> 01:53:53.687]  And yeah, it's a lot weaker than a microwave or whatever, but the point is it doesn't matter.
[01:53:53.687 --> 01:53:55.568]  My brain picks up a new wave coming through.
[01:53:56.371 --> 01:53:58.071]  And that's what's happening.
[01:53:58.071 --> 01:54:13.274]  Yeah, and I've been treating people this last year with ivermectin and the various different things for presumed COVID that we don't completely have our heads wrapped around what it is, but it kind of died out in the summer.
[01:54:13.274 --> 01:54:20.656]  But before even the cold weather hit, it came back and suddenly I was getting calls and I finally asked somebody, I said,
[01:54:21.405 --> 01:54:23.166]  Because this person did have pink hair.
[01:54:23.166 --> 01:54:28.029]  And I said, do you think there's 5G that's gone around by your area?
[01:54:28.029 --> 01:54:29.730]  Because I'm getting a lot of calls in that area.
[01:54:29.730 --> 01:54:31.651]  And that's exactly, that had happened.
[01:54:31.651 --> 01:54:33.892]  And it had actually, we had been sick in the office.
[01:54:33.892 --> 01:54:35.073]  Well, it's the same thing in Wuhan.
[01:54:35.073 --> 01:54:39.115]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but in Wuhan, all the main places it broke out was where the 5G was instituted.
[01:54:40.350 --> 01:54:45.373]  And in that hospital where Dr. Lee died, it had been completely 5G Wi-Fi'd.
[01:54:45.373 --> 01:54:46.154]  Yeah.
[01:54:46.154 --> 01:54:49.376]  That, and Lombardy, I understand, and also New York City.
[01:54:49.376 --> 01:54:54.779]  Now, they're not the only cities, but apparently it's a pretty good match.
[01:54:54.779 --> 01:55:02.404]  I'm just... The problem with 5G, too, that people need to understand is, it's not like 2G and 3G, it's 4G.
[01:55:02.404 --> 01:55:08.728]  It makes it sound like there's just a continuum, now we just... No, it's a totally new technology, super small, high-powered wavelength.
[01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:12.232]  And it's intermittent, like you said.
[01:55:12.232 --> 01:55:15.235]  We live in a little cloud of 2G or 3G or 4G.
[01:55:15.235 --> 01:55:17.717]  That was okay to a certain degree.
[01:55:17.717 --> 01:55:20.780]  It was somewhat harmful, but we were able to adapt to it.
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:26.686]  But when you have something like this that comes in bursts all the time, it's hard for the body to adapt.
[01:55:27.478 --> 01:55:27.978]  Exactly.
[01:55:27.978 --> 01:55:28.498]  All right.
[01:55:28.498 --> 01:55:30.179]  Well, Dr. Merritt, incredible job.
[01:55:30.179 --> 01:55:34.621]  Will you promise, I know a lot's going on, but the next few months, let's do a commercial free hour interview.
[01:55:34.621 --> 01:55:36.121]  You can send a whole list of things.
[01:55:36.121 --> 01:55:36.902]  We'll get into them all.
[01:55:36.902 --> 01:55:37.922]  Dr. Lee Merritt.
[01:55:37.922 --> 01:55:42.504]  And is the best place for people to find the great work you're doing at themedicalrebel.com?
[01:55:42.504 --> 01:55:43.344]  Absolutely.
[01:55:43.344 --> 01:55:48.446]  And I've got a how-to, what you should do right now to protect yourself and your family.
[01:55:48.446 --> 01:55:49.006]  All right.
[01:55:49.006 --> 01:55:49.906]  30 seconds on this, though.
[01:55:49.906 --> 01:55:51.347]  Are you optimistic about the future?
[01:55:52.811 --> 01:55:53.832]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:55:53.832 --> 01:56:01.599]  You know, besides the fact that we're humans, we have a connection to God, and we're also Americans.
[01:56:01.599 --> 01:56:02.540]  Americans don't give up.
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:03.862]  We're not going to give over our land.
[01:56:03.862 --> 01:56:05.924]  We're not going to give over our freedoms.
[01:56:05.924 --> 01:56:07.205]  I don't see that happening.
[01:56:07.205 --> 01:56:07.705]  Absolutely.
[01:56:07.705 --> 01:56:08.606]  This is a real war.
[01:56:08.606 --> 01:56:10.988]  We realize it's a war we win, we don't, we die.
[01:56:10.988 --> 01:56:11.949]  Dr. Merritt, thank you so much.
[01:56:11.949 --> 01:56:12.590]  Have a great Christmas.
[01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:14.151]  Thank you, you too.
[01:56:31.071 --> 01:56:40.340]  That's coming up, but separately, you know, a lot of people are signing up for Reset Wars, and we're getting a lot of great feedback from the thousands of people that have signed up for the course.
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:46.886]  And it's a great course, and it's game-changing stuff, and it funds us launching whole new operations, whole new systems.
[01:56:47.786 --> 01:56:53.548]  Soon, on the air, I'm going to lay out people that, going at the course, what else is going to be added to the site.
[01:56:53.548 --> 01:57:01.391]  But it's going to be independent shows, special guests, master classes, you know, so much at ResetWars.com.
[01:57:01.391 --> 01:57:11.775]  And you've got until tomorrow night, 1159 p.m., to get 25% off on the course at ResetWars.com.
[01:57:11.775 --> 01:57:16.437]  And again, folks, if people would have listened to me,
[01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:19.951]  Twenty-five years ago, we would have stopped it.
[01:57:19.951 --> 01:57:21.111]  You weren't listening.
[01:57:21.111 --> 01:57:25.992]  But I'm telling you, this is so game-changing, and people will just understand, this is real.
[01:57:25.992 --> 01:57:27.133]  This is how they control us.
[01:57:27.133 --> 01:57:32.714]  This is, if people actually embrace this, research this, and use it, we will defeat them quickly.
[01:57:32.714 --> 01:57:40.616]  I got a feeling those stuff's going to get a lot worse when people finally dig this up and use it, but one way or another, this will be a game-changer.
[01:57:40.616 --> 01:57:43.317]  ResetWars.com, and it also keeps us on the air.
[01:57:43.317 --> 01:57:44.537]  I want to thank you for your support.

[01:58:48.377 --> 01:59:01.642]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation-states on one side, and the globalists on the other, who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[01:59:01.642 --> 01:59:10.045]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private, corporate, fascist world government.
[01:59:10.045 --> 01:59:16.148]  That's why they launched their Great Reset, and their program after collapsing us, of Build Back Better.
[01:59:17.288 --> 01:59:22.450]  This is nothing more than a top-down, vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[01:59:22.450 --> 01:59:33.374]  And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon on us.
[01:59:34.134 --> 01:59:35.914]  Now we know, two years ago.
[01:59:35.914 --> 01:59:38.455]  We learned about it about 20 months ago.
[01:59:38.455 --> 01:59:39.035]  It's that simple.
[01:59:39.035 --> 01:59:42.136]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[01:59:42.136 --> 01:59:46.337]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[01:59:46.337 --> 01:59:50.118]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[01:59:50.118 --> 01:59:55.999]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
