[00:00.000 --> 00:28.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, you'd have to see it to believe it, but you will see it.
[00:28.520 --> 00:32.720]  You still may not believe it.
[00:32.720 --> 00:41.280]  I'm getting text messages from friends who are seeing this story elsewhere.
[00:41.280 --> 00:44.080]  It's being covered at infowars.com.
[00:44.080 --> 00:48.880]  People are going and asking for the inserts to the COVID vaccine.
[00:48.880 --> 00:54.560]  And of course, you saw the one that just had the digital barcode on there.
[00:54.560 --> 01:00.000]  But no, you can go get some and find the inserts.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.600]  And there's a lot of shocking things that you will find.
[01:06.600 --> 01:13.240]  For example, headline at infowars.com, shocker.
[01:13.240 --> 01:17.680]  Why is this substance in the Moderna COVID vaccine?
[01:17.680 --> 01:22.760]  It's called SM 102.
[01:22.760 --> 01:31.320]  And when you go look into the medical documents on the official OSHA website, the safety data
[01:31.320 --> 01:42.000]  sheet for SM 102 says right here, for research use only, not for human use.
[01:42.000 --> 01:49.720]  In fact, when I told the guys, the headline for today's show, I said not to put it in
[01:49.720 --> 01:50.720]  quotes.
[01:50.720 --> 02:04.960]  Let's just put that in quotes, because that's the exact quote, not for human use.
[02:04.960 --> 02:11.760]  And in California and Oregon, they are readying the mandatory vaccines.
[02:11.760 --> 02:14.920]  Same thing with New York City.
[02:14.920 --> 02:20.880]  They're getting ready to force you to take something, not for human use, according to
[02:20.880 --> 02:22.080]  OSHA documents.
[02:22.080 --> 02:29.240]  You have the military walking around on the streets, jabbing people at convenience stores.
[02:29.240 --> 02:33.440]  And then they celebrate it and they bump fists.
[02:33.440 --> 02:38.680]  And you know, it's got diversity too.
[02:38.680 --> 02:44.680]  Oh, so you have the diversity factor.
[02:44.680 --> 02:53.560]  And this is, oh man, see, and now they've got the military involved.
[02:53.560 --> 03:00.920]  Oh, my gosh, this COVID-19 is a disaster.
[03:00.920 --> 03:05.240]  This vaccine is an absolute horrific nightmare.
[03:05.240 --> 03:06.960]  And that's not even all.
[03:06.960 --> 03:08.440]  I don't even have time.
[03:08.440 --> 03:20.080]  I haven't even had the time to properly go through all of the wild statements on these
[03:20.080 --> 03:22.280]  vaccine inserts.
[03:22.280 --> 03:29.680]  Like for example, on Summit just says, not all side effects will be included in this
[03:29.680 --> 03:34.160]  document, because they don't know all the side effects yet.
[03:34.160 --> 03:35.880]  It's just now being tested on humans.
[03:35.880 --> 03:38.000]  It's just now being waved out.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.200]  And they sell it like it's a normal vaccine, oh, and they say, oh, this is a tried and
[03:43.200 --> 03:44.200]  true science.
[03:44.200 --> 03:45.480]  There's nothing to be afraid of.
[03:45.480 --> 03:46.960]  Don't be a vaccine skeptic.
[03:46.960 --> 03:49.840]  This is not a normal vaccine.
[03:49.840 --> 03:55.720]  No, it's not a normal vaccine.
[03:55.720 --> 04:00.160]  And again, you see the videos of arms becoming magnetized after getting the shot, and it's
[04:00.160 --> 04:03.440]  just like you don't even believe this stuff.
[04:03.440 --> 04:11.200]  How could this be going on?
[04:11.200 --> 04:13.040]  So maybe that's a magic trick.
[04:13.040 --> 04:16.960]  Who knows what that is?
[04:16.960 --> 04:20.440]  Maybe there's something heavy metallic in the insert.
[04:20.440 --> 04:24.920]  I mean, nobody's dug a microchip out of themselves yet.
[04:24.920 --> 04:27.920]  That will be the day.
[04:27.920 --> 04:29.840]  But I mean, let's just start basic.
[04:29.840 --> 04:34.200]  Let's start elementary.
[04:34.200 --> 04:41.520]  Ingredients included in the Moderna COVID-19 shot, SM102, OSHA fact sheet on SM102 says
[04:41.520 --> 04:43.480]  for research only not for human use.
[04:43.480 --> 04:45.280]  But I mean, they're telling you this is a research.
[04:45.280 --> 04:50.960]  They're doing research on the COVID vaccine, the new mRNA technology, they're doing research
[04:50.960 --> 04:52.280]  on you right now.
[04:52.280 --> 04:55.560]  You are part of a giant worldwide research project.
[04:55.560 --> 05:01.320]  Congratulations for you.
[05:01.320 --> 05:03.320]  Your voice counts.
[05:03.320 --> 05:08.320]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[05:08.320 --> 05:10.920]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[05:10.920 --> 05:12.440]  They know you're angry.
[05:12.440 --> 05:16.760]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[05:16.760 --> 05:17.760]  we've got.
[05:17.760 --> 05:21.960]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[06:26.880 --> 06:32.680]  Billing in for Alex today, but he will be joining us coming up shortly here in the first
[06:32.680 --> 06:33.680]  hour.
[06:33.680 --> 06:37.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, May 21, 2021.
[06:37.920 --> 06:43.520]  Yes, this is the Alex Jones show.
[06:43.520 --> 06:56.720]  And I've got stacks and stacks and stacks of news, wow, wow.
[06:56.720 --> 07:01.600]  So we're going to get into what I just covered in the opening segment, but yes, we covered
[07:01.600 --> 07:02.600]  it yesterday.
[07:02.600 --> 07:06.320]  Alex broke with special reports yesterday.
[07:06.320 --> 07:08.920]  We have new reports coming out.
[07:08.920 --> 07:11.600]  We have other reporters noticing things.
[07:11.600 --> 07:13.600]  Hey, look, you know what?
[07:13.600 --> 07:14.600]  I hope we're wrong.
[07:14.600 --> 07:18.640]  I hope this vaccine isn't a weapon and isn't going to kill a bunch of people.
[07:18.640 --> 07:21.840]  And then these are just coincidences and all of this stuff.
[07:21.840 --> 07:22.840]  I do.
[07:22.840 --> 07:23.840]  I really do, folks.
[07:23.840 --> 07:24.840]  Believe me.
[07:24.840 --> 07:25.840]  I really do.
[07:25.840 --> 07:31.640]  I hope we're all wrong about this, but no one else wants to report on it.
[07:31.640 --> 07:34.160]  We read the actual medical literature.
[07:34.160 --> 07:35.600]  We read the actual inserts.
[07:35.600 --> 07:37.280]  We look at the ingredients.
[07:37.280 --> 07:38.740]  We follow all the side effects.
[07:38.740 --> 07:43.080]  We follow all the stories.
[07:43.080 --> 07:47.160]  And we just report the truth.
[07:47.160 --> 07:58.480]  Like S.M. 102 in the vaccine insert says it's one of the ingredients for the vaccine, COVID
[07:58.480 --> 08:00.480]  vaccine.
[08:00.480 --> 08:04.400]  And then you look at, oh, okay, let's look into S.M. 102.
[08:04.400 --> 08:08.680]  And you go to the official OSHA website here and it says, for research only, not for health.
[08:08.680 --> 08:13.600]  For human use.
[08:13.600 --> 08:21.080]  And then you look at, so then pharmacies will have their own medical documents.
[08:21.080 --> 08:24.880]  And then it will say, this is not FDA approved.
[08:24.880 --> 08:34.960]  This is an investigatory vaccine using mRNA technology, says it right on the document.
[08:34.960 --> 08:45.240]  And then you have leaders of the NAACP going on New York airwaves with FOMO and de Blasio
[08:45.240 --> 08:48.120]  sticking their arm out and saying, I'm not going to question what's in this.
[08:48.120 --> 08:49.880]  I'm not going to look at the ingredients.
[08:49.880 --> 08:52.960]  I'm going to roll my sleeve up and I'm going to take that vaccine.
[08:52.960 --> 08:53.960]  No questions asked.
[08:53.960 --> 09:01.920]  Oh, just like the people in the Tuskegee experiment, I suppose.
[09:01.920 --> 09:08.800]  And they see, they know they can't cross a certain threshold of forcing us to vaccinate.
[09:08.800 --> 09:15.280]  And so they're trying to dice, you know, walk around it, you know, we're going to, oh, we'll
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.400]  just have some vaccine passports to use these things and oh, just big businesses are going
[09:20.400 --> 09:27.600]  to make you have a vaccine to go back to work and then slowly it just increments itself.
[09:27.600 --> 09:29.800]  But so I'm going to get to all that.
[09:29.800 --> 09:31.360]  We'll do whole segments on that.
[09:31.360 --> 09:35.280]  We'll talk to Alex about that.
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.520]  But I mean, okay, so that's kind of a big deal.
[09:40.520 --> 09:49.680]  How about we have, I mean, I guess it was already known, but now the Soros elected, Soros
[09:49.680 --> 09:56.480]  funded and elected sheriff in Maricopa County, Paul Penzon is basically doing everything
[09:56.480 --> 09:59.320]  he can to stop the audit in Maricopa County.
[09:59.320 --> 10:04.680]  Of course, he got more funding than any other elected official from George Soros.
[10:04.680 --> 10:05.680]  The most.
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.000]  Boy, they really wanted that.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.640]  And then you notice who was the one before it was Joe Arpaio, a great patriot.
[10:14.640 --> 10:18.280]  Oh, uh-huh.
[10:18.280 --> 10:25.080]  So you get rid of a great American patriot who backs Donald Trump and you put in a Soros
[10:25.080 --> 10:34.380]  funded leftist activist and now he's blocking the audit into the Maricopa County 2020 presidential
[10:34.380 --> 10:37.080]  election results that you rigged and stole.
[10:37.080 --> 10:41.680]  I mean, they had this whole thing planned so well from the beginning how they were going
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.920]  to steal this election and Maricopa County was one of the places they knew they were
[10:45.920 --> 10:47.800]  going to do it bigger than ever.
[10:47.800 --> 10:52.360]  And they got their Soros guy in and Soros made sure of it with his money.
[10:52.360 --> 10:56.880]  And they got that they got that Trump support and patriot out of there too.
[10:56.880 --> 10:58.880]  Oh, man.
[10:58.880 --> 11:00.880]  Oh, man.
[11:00.880 --> 11:09.080]  Oh, and now Republicans in Maricopa County are being sent substances in the mail, unknown
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.080]  substances in the mail because, you know, the Democrats so tolerant, so peaceful.
[11:14.080 --> 11:20.840]  So the exact opposite of everything they claim to be okay.
[11:20.840 --> 11:27.720]  Then you've got Biden, the man driving the fake steering wheel, the man who's not in
[11:27.720 --> 11:36.480]  charge, the man who's told what to do, the empty suit, the mental patient, the least
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.800]  of which of what he's doing right now, signing the anti-Asian hate crime bill, isn't that
[11:41.800 --> 11:44.400]  funny?
[11:44.400 --> 11:45.400]  Isn't that funny?
[11:45.400 --> 11:48.280]  So are we going to address who is committing all the Asian hate crimes?
[11:48.280 --> 11:49.280]  I mean, let's just be honest.
[11:49.280 --> 11:50.920]  It's black people.
[11:50.920 --> 11:54.160]  But no, no, no, no, no, no, they're going to say black lives matter out of the left
[11:54.160 --> 11:57.520]  side of their mouth, Asian lives matter out of the right side of the mouth, kind of like
[11:57.520 --> 12:02.520]  they're going to say, you know, LGBTQ plus rights and wave their flags all over.
[12:02.520 --> 12:06.480]  But then they're going to support Hamas and radical Islam.
[12:06.480 --> 12:09.040]  Yes, that is the left.
[12:09.040 --> 12:12.520]  Total mental patients can't think straight.
[12:12.520 --> 12:14.720]  It's just unbelievable.
[12:14.720 --> 12:17.560]  These people are in power.
[12:17.560 --> 12:19.040]  These people are in power.
[12:19.040 --> 12:20.520]  They want more power.
[12:20.520 --> 12:22.680]  Like you have David Hogg going on CNN.
[12:22.680 --> 12:23.680]  It was unbelievable.
[12:23.680 --> 12:27.800]  I was listening to the American Journal listening to this clip and I don't like to be redundant
[12:27.800 --> 12:29.840]  here at Info Wars and play the same clips all day.
[12:29.840 --> 12:30.840]  So I wasn't going to play it.
[12:30.840 --> 12:39.920]  But it's like David Hogg and CNN saying Marjorie Taylor Greene doesn't deserve a firearm.
[12:39.920 --> 12:45.960]  And you know, it's just they don't get what they're saying.
[12:45.960 --> 12:47.120]  They really don't.
[12:47.120 --> 12:56.120]  And you're telling a free man that you're going to take their firearm that they don't
[12:56.120 --> 12:58.120]  have the right to defend themselves.
[12:58.120 --> 12:59.600]  You don't realize what you're doing.
[12:59.600 --> 13:01.040]  You don't realize what you're asking for.
[13:01.040 --> 13:02.040]  Do you?
[13:02.040 --> 13:05.720]  Now, imagine, though, they want to disarm their political opposition.
[13:05.720 --> 13:11.400]  This is the most violent hate filled group in America right now.
[13:11.400 --> 13:16.200]  The Democrat Party, their street thugs, Antifa, Black Lives Matter, you name it.
[13:16.200 --> 13:18.480]  They're attacking members of Congress.
[13:18.480 --> 13:20.560]  They're shooting members of Congress.
[13:20.560 --> 13:25.200]  They're threatening anybody they disagree with and they want to disarm us.
[13:25.200 --> 13:26.200]  Wow.
[13:26.200 --> 13:29.320]  Oh, I don't know where that's going at all.
[13:29.320 --> 13:30.520]  No, I can't.
[13:30.520 --> 13:32.080]  I can't do the math on that.
[13:32.080 --> 13:33.080]  Nope.
[13:33.080 --> 13:34.080]  That.
[13:34.080 --> 13:41.080]  Oh, so you liberals go on TV and suggest you're going to take free men and free women's
[13:41.080 --> 13:42.080]  firearms.
[13:42.080 --> 13:48.320]  I really don't think you know what you're asking for.
[13:48.320 --> 13:54.040]  So you better watch your mouths.
[13:54.040 --> 13:57.480]  But the Biden anti-Asian hate crime bill is the least of our concerns.
[13:57.480 --> 14:01.720]  It just shows how out of their minds they are or they just won't even be honest or
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.520]  anything's a political stunt these days.
[14:06.520 --> 14:10.960]  But no, here's some more concerning things that should be highlighted.
[14:10.960 --> 14:16.480]  Energy Secretary Granholm's investment in electric vehicle battery company Sparks Concerned.
[14:16.480 --> 14:17.840]  Millions of dollars.
[14:17.840 --> 14:23.560]  The energy secretary appointed by Biden has invested in electric vehicle batteries.
[14:23.560 --> 14:31.000]  And he's in control of the monies from the government that will go into energy.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.080]  So if you want to make a lot of money in the next couple of years, I'd invest in what
[14:35.080 --> 14:37.200]  that guy's invested in.
[14:37.200 --> 14:38.680]  Excuse me.
[14:38.680 --> 14:39.680]  She.
[14:39.680 --> 14:42.480]  I'm a real Jennifer Granholm.
[14:42.480 --> 14:46.520]  I forgot the crooks come in all different shapes and sizes as Democrats.
[14:46.520 --> 14:51.520]  So you want to make a bunch of money and get invest your money in electric car batteries
[14:51.520 --> 14:54.200]  like Protera.
[14:54.200 --> 14:59.120]  Like the Biden administration member Jennifer Granholm has the energy secretary who I'm
[14:59.120 --> 15:02.920]  sure will be boosting those stocks nicely.
[15:02.920 --> 15:03.920]  Nice.
[15:03.920 --> 15:05.920]  Nice.
[15:05.920 --> 15:09.320]  This Biden pick has worked for top offshore wind firms.
[15:09.320 --> 15:11.840]  Now he's poised to help oversee the industry.
[15:11.840 --> 15:14.560]  And they don't mention it in this article, but other people are covering it.
[15:14.560 --> 15:18.600]  He's also heavily invested in the wind farm industry and windmills.
[15:18.600 --> 15:24.440]  Oh, and now he's going to be doling out money to that quote unquote green energy.
[15:24.440 --> 15:29.360]  So oh yeah, you want to shut off America's energy, bringing people who are invested in
[15:29.360 --> 15:32.240]  alternative energies that have failed us over time.
[15:32.240 --> 15:33.960]  It doesn't stop there.
[15:33.960 --> 15:42.960]  Either Biden appointee nominee to the intelligence community has worked for Huawei.
[15:42.960 --> 15:47.040]  You know the Huawei that helps the Chinese communists round up dissidents and throw them
[15:47.040 --> 15:50.320]  into death camps and slave labor that Huawei.
[15:50.320 --> 15:53.680]  Yeah, they're bringing one of those employees into the Biden administration too.
[15:53.680 --> 15:56.000]  Boy, this is quite a bunch, isn't it?
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.600]  Quite a bunch from Joe Biden.
[15:57.600 --> 16:02.920]  The bio pros are the new non GMO pollution solution using eco friendly products to treat
[16:02.920 --> 16:04.920]  everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[16:04.920 --> 16:09.920]  For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio remediation
[16:09.920 --> 16:11.760]  products to the everyday consumer.
[16:11.760 --> 16:16.240]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSepticPro, a product specifically
[16:16.240 --> 16:19.280]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[16:19.280 --> 16:23.600]  BioSepticPro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like as competitors.
[16:23.600 --> 16:25.520]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[16:25.520 --> 16:28.120]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[16:28.120 --> 16:32.400]  Say goodbye to septic problems, gas buildup, and odor guaranteed.
[16:32.400 --> 16:36.760]  BioSepticPro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[16:36.760 --> 16:41.040]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to
[16:41.040 --> 16:46.000]  treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times more effective than
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  its competitors.
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.200]  BioSepticPro is safer plumbing, human, animal, and aquatic life.

[16:57.280 --> 17:01.720]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious.
[17:01.720 --> 17:05.240]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[17:05.240 --> 17:12.680]  Last week, the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top morass
[17:12.680 --> 17:17.640]  and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called
[17:17.640 --> 17:18.640]  COVID-19 frankenshot.
[17:18.640 --> 17:21.440]  I'm going to say it the second time.
[17:21.440 --> 17:29.240]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the frankenshots.
[17:29.240 --> 17:30.800]  They don't trust it.
[17:30.800 --> 17:32.120]  You shouldn't trust it.
[17:32.120 --> 17:34.920]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[17:34.920 --> 17:38.120]  This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world.
[17:38.120 --> 17:41.520]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun.
[17:41.520 --> 17:44.360]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[17:44.360 --> 17:48.800]  Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff, refused
[17:48.800 --> 17:49.800]  to take the vaccines.
[17:49.800 --> 17:50.800]  That's right.
[17:50.800 --> 17:55.680]  The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine, and you shouldn't either.
[17:55.680 --> 18:00.400]  You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[18:00.400 --> 18:07.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:07.400 --> 18:29.600]  You know, I've got all this serious news to get to here, and we're going to get to
[18:29.600 --> 18:30.600]  all of it.
[18:30.600 --> 18:35.520]  I've got to just, this vaccine stuff is so crazy.
[18:35.520 --> 18:40.120]  But we need to highlight how dangerous, because it's like, what's more dangerous?
[18:40.120 --> 18:42.960]  The vaccine, what's more dangerous?
[18:42.960 --> 18:50.960]  The left taking over and implementing globalism and destroying the United States.
[18:50.960 --> 18:55.440]  And what do we have a chance at stopping?
[18:55.440 --> 18:58.560]  But I guess we could read people the ingredients to the vaccine, and that may stop them.
[18:58.560 --> 19:01.880]  But I actually need to get more documents, so I'm waiting for the crew to give me some
[19:01.880 --> 19:05.880]  other documents so that I can add to this, so that you can understand how dangerous that
[19:05.880 --> 19:06.880]  is.
[19:06.880 --> 19:10.600]  But I've got all this important news, but I have to tell you right now, before we get
[19:10.600 --> 19:19.880]  started, I have to admit I am addicted to the new fizzy magnesium at infowarstore.com.
[19:19.880 --> 19:22.520]  It's a bit of a problem.
[19:22.520 --> 19:26.320]  So, well, I'll take it off to my side desk here so you can see that I'm drinking the
[19:26.320 --> 19:27.880]  fizzy magnesium right now.
[19:27.880 --> 19:33.720]  So I'm becoming addicted to the fizzy magnesium from infowarstore.com, and it's a bit of a
[19:33.720 --> 19:35.800]  concern amongst the crew.
[19:35.800 --> 19:39.640]  So I may be going away for a couple of days when Alex gets back.
[19:39.640 --> 19:47.720]  It's becoming a really serious issue here, so you don't see me again, just know I'm fighting
[19:47.720 --> 19:50.280]  my fizzy magnesium addiction.
[19:50.280 --> 19:52.280]  Of course, it's good for me, so it doesn't matter.
[19:52.280 --> 19:54.720]  I can drink as much as I want.
[19:54.720 --> 20:00.960]  Fizzy magnesium, exclusively available on sale right now at infowarstore.com, and it's
[20:00.960 --> 20:03.400]  your support there that keeps us on the air.
[20:03.400 --> 20:07.520]  Again, Alex Jones coming up here, he's supposed to be joining us in the next segment, so stay
[20:07.520 --> 20:08.520]  tuned for that.
[20:08.520 --> 20:15.600]  And I'm going to wait with Alex to get into all of this COVID news, and I'm going to wait
[20:15.600 --> 20:20.960]  until I get these other documents on my desk as well to just highlight this.
[20:20.960 --> 20:24.240]  But let me get into the stuff that worries me about the Biden administration here.
[20:24.240 --> 20:31.080]  And let me just say, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and then, like, Leticia James of the world
[20:31.080 --> 20:33.960]  that are involved politically, these are the most dangerous people in America right
[20:33.960 --> 20:34.960]  now politically.
[20:34.960 --> 20:38.400]  Now, I know Biden is not in control, but he's still the head of it.
[20:38.400 --> 20:41.600]  So he's allowing all of this to go on.
[20:41.600 --> 20:46.280]  He's the figurehead, so he is the danger.
[20:46.280 --> 20:52.280]  But you know, I just have to say, before I get into that, this is one of the more ridiculous
[20:52.280 --> 20:54.840]  things you're ever going to see in your life.
[20:54.840 --> 20:57.520]  And I mean, every day it's like that, I know.
[20:57.520 --> 21:02.800]  Little knit penises for transgender babies, I mean, yeah, we're getting into some crazy
[21:02.800 --> 21:05.760]  times here.
[21:05.760 --> 21:12.360]  But liberals, Democrat voters, progressives, these people don't even live in reality anymore,
[21:12.360 --> 21:13.960]  ladies and gentlemen.
[21:13.960 --> 21:19.080]  They don't even live in reality anymore.
[21:19.080 --> 21:26.080]  This story from the Washington Post, from Mary Beth Sheridan headline, Mexico's coronavirus
[21:26.080 --> 21:27.640]  deaths are plummeting.
[21:27.640 --> 21:31.720]  The Biden wall could be a factor.
[21:31.720 --> 21:40.600]  I kid you not in the headline, not only giving Biden credit for the wall, but also it's a
[21:40.600 --> 21:44.240]  good thing now.
[21:44.240 --> 21:52.080]  Now Biden wall, Washington Post, the Biden wall, a good thing.
[21:52.080 --> 21:54.120]  It doesn't stop there.
[21:54.120 --> 22:01.840]  You read into the story, they then claim, thanks to Joe Biden for getting the vaccine
[22:01.840 --> 22:07.240]  out so quickly, that that's the other cause why COVID deaths are plummeting.
[22:07.240 --> 22:12.360]  So not only do they give credit to the wall, which Biden stopped, they give Biden credit
[22:12.360 --> 22:16.680]  for building the wall, which they were all against.
[22:16.680 --> 22:21.240]  They give Biden credit for building the wall, and then they give Biden credit for getting
[22:21.240 --> 22:24.480]  the vaccines out.
[22:24.480 --> 22:27.960]  These people don't live in reality.
[22:27.960 --> 22:31.680]  Mary Beth Sheridan doesn't live in reality.
[22:31.680 --> 22:35.720]  She writes for the Washington Post.
[22:35.720 --> 22:42.640]  Now let's get into what the Biden administration is up to.
[22:42.640 --> 22:46.080]  But let me just say this before I get into it, because it needs to be said.
[22:46.080 --> 22:50.920]  When you have Kamala Harris admitting to media during interviews that she keeps a list of
[22:50.920 --> 22:57.360]  her enemies, you need to be on alert about how dangerous that woman is.
[22:57.360 --> 22:58.360]  She keeps a list of her enemies.
[22:58.360 --> 23:02.800]  I wonder if any Info Wars reporters or hosts are on that list.
[23:02.800 --> 23:06.400]  Kamala Harris keeps a list, sounds like a psycho of her enemies.
[23:06.400 --> 23:10.400]  Those are the types of people that don't get firearms under the liberal laws, you understand?
[23:10.400 --> 23:12.400]  But I'm sure they wouldn't point that out for her.
[23:12.400 --> 23:13.400]  Hey, how are you doing?
[23:13.400 --> 23:15.400]  Oh, nothing, just making a list of my enemies?
[23:15.400 --> 23:18.280]  Oh, you don't sound psychotic at all.
[23:18.280 --> 23:22.360]  And then you have Letitia James.
[23:22.360 --> 23:26.680]  You have Letitia James out of New York City who's trying to destroy Donald Trump doing
[23:26.680 --> 23:31.360]  all these criminal investigations.
[23:31.360 --> 23:35.320]  You know the old dangerous thing that you got out of the Soviet Union and Communist
[23:35.320 --> 23:37.720]  Hell holes?
[23:37.720 --> 23:38.720]  Show me the man.
[23:38.720 --> 23:39.880]  I'll find the crime.
[23:39.880 --> 23:41.440]  That's Letitia James.
[23:41.440 --> 23:43.000]  And she doesn't even hide it.
[23:43.000 --> 23:44.160]  She does interviews.
[23:44.160 --> 23:48.880]  She goes out on the streets and she says, I'll find what Trump did.
[23:48.880 --> 23:49.880]  She says it.
[23:49.880 --> 23:50.880]  Here's the man.
[23:50.880 --> 23:51.880]  I'll find the crime.
[23:51.880 --> 23:52.880]  She's openly saying that.
[23:52.880 --> 23:55.160]  These are the most dangerous people in our country.
[23:55.160 --> 23:59.600]  This is what authoritarian tyrannies form out of.
[23:59.600 --> 24:04.440]  And boy, are they arrogant and boy, are they aggressive and pompous and they think nothing
[24:04.440 --> 24:06.400]  is in their way.
[24:06.400 --> 24:09.560]  And they might be right.
[24:09.560 --> 24:18.040]  When you got such a ridiculous, I mean, look, you want to raise awareness about the crimes
[24:18.040 --> 24:21.480]  against Asian people that are happening in America, then you might as well be honest
[24:21.480 --> 24:23.080]  about it.
[24:23.080 --> 24:27.000]  Maybe Barack Obama should come out and make a statement, you know, the first black president
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.360]  and say, hey, guys, you know, stop beating up Asians.
[24:32.360 --> 24:33.880]  It's the white people you should be attacking.
[24:33.880 --> 24:34.880]  Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[24:34.880 --> 24:36.640]  No, but no, you don't get any of that.
[24:36.640 --> 24:42.160]  It's just, oh, white supremacy and it's Asian hate crime, even though every video, every
[24:42.160 --> 24:48.560]  attack on an Asian American is a black man or a black woman.
[24:48.560 --> 24:49.560]  Not Letitia James.
[24:49.560 --> 24:53.720]  She's too busy trying to destroy Donald Trump, an innocent man because of her racism against
[24:53.720 --> 24:54.720]  white people.
[24:54.720 --> 24:58.360]  She's like seeing white successful men, so instead of trying to be successful herself,
[24:58.360 --> 25:01.280]  she just tries to destroy them.
[25:01.280 --> 25:08.480]  But I mean, this is just, this is the swamp personified.
[25:08.480 --> 25:13.880]  Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm will be in charge of hundreds of billions of dollars
[25:13.880 --> 25:21.480]  of our tax payer funds that most likely she will be giving to electric energy because
[25:21.480 --> 25:28.960]  she is heavily invested millions of dollars in electric vehicle battery companies.
[25:28.960 --> 25:30.840]  I don't see a conflict of interest there at all.
[25:30.840 --> 25:32.760]  It doesn't stop.
[25:32.760 --> 25:35.320]  This Biden pick has worked for top offshore wind firms.
[25:35.320 --> 25:40.000]  He also has millions of dollars invested in the windmill industry.
[25:40.000 --> 25:47.160]  And now he's going to be joining Biden's team.
[25:47.160 --> 25:52.520]  This confirmation hearing for deputy secretary of the interior department was last month,
[25:52.520 --> 25:55.000]  so that's nice.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.640]  So you've got Biden and pointing people heavily invested in the windmill industry to be overseeing
[25:59.640 --> 26:00.720]  funds and energy.
[26:00.720 --> 26:05.720]  You've got Biden appointing people who are heavily invested in the electric vehicle battery
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.120]  industry and they'll be overseeing how funds are doled out.
[26:10.120 --> 26:20.360]  And you've also got one more, one more beauty Christopher Fonzone who also worked with Obama.
[26:20.360 --> 26:24.520]  He used to work for Huawei and the Chinese government.
[26:24.520 --> 26:31.640]  So you've got Tommy Boudreau about to make millions in the wind industry.
[26:31.640 --> 26:35.680]  You've got Jennifer Granholm looking like millions in the electric vehicle industry
[26:35.680 --> 26:40.320]  and you've got Christopher Fonzone who worked for Huawei and China all being appointed to
[26:40.320 --> 26:42.040]  the Biden administration.
[26:42.040 --> 26:46.480]  This is a real, this is a real motley crew, isn't it?
[26:46.480 --> 26:49.760]  This is a real, this is a real group of winners here, isn't it?
[26:49.760 --> 26:51.560]  They're about to steal so much money.
[26:51.560 --> 26:54.640]  It's going to be, I mean, this is going to be the biggest theft maybe of all time.
[26:54.640 --> 26:56.640]  And Obama set records.
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.440]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[27:01.440 --> 27:04.160]  for beta testing to operational.
[27:04.160 --> 27:08.960]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[27:08.960 --> 27:09.960]  takeover.
[27:09.960 --> 27:13.360]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.040]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[27:18.040 --> 27:19.040]  Humanity is strong.
[27:19.040 --> 27:20.040]  We're incredible.
[27:20.040 --> 27:23.800]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[27:23.800 --> 27:26.280]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[27:26.280 --> 27:30.520]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning
[27:30.520 --> 27:32.240]  others is absolutely essential.

[28:59.160 --> 29:00.160]  Warning!
[29:00.160 --> 29:01.160]  Warning!
[29:01.160 --> 29:06.000]  The globalists have launched a massive counter offensive against populist forces worldwide.
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  They are censoring.
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  They are attacking.
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.520]  They are arresting patriots all over the world.
[29:10.520 --> 29:15.120]  Churches in Europe, Australia, the UK and Canada and even California and New York are
[29:15.120 --> 29:19.240]  being swat teamed and clothed because they're non-essential.
[29:19.240 --> 29:24.320]  The tyranny is incredible, but in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida where we
[29:24.320 --> 29:28.880]  have a history of more liberty, all the lockdowns are over, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:28.880 --> 29:29.880]  This is martial law.
[29:29.880 --> 29:34.960]  This has all been a massive martial law drill and now it's more important than ever to spread
[29:34.960 --> 29:38.000]  the word about InfoWars and to support InfoWars.
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.120]  We have three of our best selling products selling out but despite that they're all massively
[29:42.120 --> 29:43.120]  discounted.
[29:43.120 --> 29:45.880]  Turbo force, it's 40% off.
[29:45.880 --> 29:50.920]  You've got ultimate fish oil, 50% off and winter sun for your immune system, it's 50%
[29:50.920 --> 29:51.920]  off as well.
[29:51.920 --> 29:58.520]  Best deal ever, take advantage of it at InfoWarsStore.com and fund the InfoWars.
[29:58.520 --> 30:03.800]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[30:03.800 --> 30:10.000]  patients, hundreds of hospitals in the US, injected healthy men, women and children with
[30:10.000 --> 30:16.320]  uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many
[30:16.320 --> 30:18.520]  of the test subjects.
[30:18.520 --> 30:22.520]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[30:22.520 --> 30:26.200]  14 years ago we tracked and documented the Boulder Bird Group's activities and their
[30:26.200 --> 30:29.560]  plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[30:29.560 --> 30:31.080]  The film now is more important than ever.
[30:31.080 --> 30:34.040]  When it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[30:34.040 --> 30:38.120]  We have it back in print available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[30:38.120 --> 30:42.200]  Allowing them as low as $3.95 a piece of the environment bulk and there's a zero country
[30:42.200 --> 30:44.200]  code so anywhere on the planet you can make copies.
[30:44.200 --> 30:46.040]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[30:46.040 --> 30:51.880]  You are the Paul Revere's, 1776 Worldwide, 1776 Worldwide in-game blueprint for global
[30:51.880 --> 31:01.480]  enslavement available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[31:01.480 --> 31:11.480]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:11.480 --> 31:30.880]  All right, I'm just overwhelmed here and I'm waiting to be joined by Alex and so I
[31:30.880 --> 31:34.440]  should wait until I'm joined by Alex to get into this.
[31:34.440 --> 31:44.520]  But again, I've got just more medical literature here.
[31:44.520 --> 31:51.600]  Hat tip to Jason Lowe who sent me this and folks, you can do this.
[31:51.600 --> 31:57.960]  Go to your local pharmacy, ask for the insert, read it and by the way, some of these pharmacies
[31:57.960 --> 32:01.720]  are going to have different inserts because they're going to have their own medical documents
[32:01.720 --> 32:04.240]  because the vaccines don't have inserts.
[32:04.240 --> 32:07.760]  And so they're smart enough to know we have to have medical documentation, we're not going
[32:07.760 --> 32:08.760]  to break the law.
[32:08.760 --> 32:13.320]  So they'll have their own medical inserts with their own medical data on it.
[32:13.320 --> 32:15.400]  So there's all kinds of different things.
[32:15.400 --> 32:21.040]  So it's not just the ingredients and the side effects that they know of.
[32:21.040 --> 32:24.880]  It's them admitting that they still don't know all the side effects.
[32:24.880 --> 32:31.640]  The testing is still underway, it's not FDA approved, it is mRNA encoding viral spike
[32:31.640 --> 32:36.840]  glycoprotein technology, which they all say, oh, it's all conspiracy theories, it's just
[32:36.840 --> 32:37.840]  in the medical literature.
[32:37.840 --> 32:40.920]  It's just like, we read the medical literature and tell you what's in the vaccines and they
[32:40.920 --> 32:43.800]  call us conspiracy theorists.
[32:43.800 --> 32:44.800]  Unbelievable.
[32:44.800 --> 32:51.960]  Now they just admit, like right here, this is a summary and does not have all possible
[32:51.960 --> 32:53.920]  information about this product.
[32:53.920 --> 32:57.680]  This information does not assure that this product is safe, effective, or appropriate
[32:57.680 --> 32:59.400]  for you.
[32:59.400 --> 33:10.040]  That's the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine drug education monograph.
[33:10.040 --> 33:13.720]  So I could just sit here and read medical literature all day.
[33:13.720 --> 33:23.600]  Here's the ingredient, SM 102, okay, SM 102, let's go over here, look at the, here's the
[33:23.600 --> 33:37.480]  safety data sheet from OSHA on SM 102 for research use only, not for human use.
[33:37.480 --> 33:44.120]  So let me get this straight, I'm supposed to take a trial vaccine that killed the animals,
[33:44.120 --> 33:50.520]  it was tested on, hasn't been human tested, is a new vaccine technology, the guy who's
[33:50.520 --> 33:54.640]  promoting it, Bill Gates, says he wants to get the human population down to zero and
[33:54.640 --> 33:58.560]  one of the ingredients says it's not for human use.
[33:58.560 --> 34:04.760]  Folks, if you line up to take this and I know people that have and I'm not trying to insult
[34:04.760 --> 34:14.600]  or judge people that have, okay, but I mean, at a certain level, you have to understand,
[34:14.600 --> 34:20.800]  Bill Gates thinks if you take this vaccine and die, then you deserve it, but maybe he's
[34:20.800 --> 34:26.240]  right.
[34:26.240 --> 34:29.280]  I mean, is that the debate we need to have?
[34:29.280 --> 34:30.280]  Maybe they're right.
[34:30.280 --> 34:33.360]  Hey, if you're going to line up and you're going to get this vaccine and it kills you,
[34:33.360 --> 34:34.360]  you signed up for that.
[34:34.360 --> 34:40.000]  I mean, the left is the one that doesn't want to praise or talk about war heroes, they signed
[34:40.000 --> 34:41.000]  up for that.
[34:41.000 --> 34:42.000]  You know that?
[34:42.000 --> 34:43.000]  Well, you died from the vaccine.
[34:43.000 --> 34:52.560]  Do you sign up for that or were you not properly informed to see that because that's illegal?
[34:52.560 --> 34:54.720]  Maybe they say you weren't properly informed.
[34:54.720 --> 34:56.120]  Here's the medical documents right here.
[34:56.120 --> 35:01.280]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[35:01.280 --> 35:08.560]  And so the amazing thing too is you'll have leftist attorneys suing car companies or suing
[35:08.560 --> 35:09.560]  gun companies.
[35:09.560 --> 35:14.840]  The gun company is the big one, suing gun companies or trying to write legislation that
[35:14.840 --> 35:20.320]  says a gun company, a gun manufacturer is responsible if somebody uses a gun to kill
[35:20.320 --> 35:24.480]  someone in a crime or commit a crime that the gun company is responsible.
[35:24.480 --> 35:27.960]  And then when they can't pass the legislation, they sue the companies trying to hold them
[35:27.960 --> 35:32.280]  responsible on individual cases to just try to sue them out of existence.
[35:32.280 --> 35:37.520]  But see, they don't want that same application.
[35:37.520 --> 35:40.400]  They don't want that same logic.
[35:40.400 --> 35:43.400]  They don't want that same litigation against vaccines.
[35:43.400 --> 35:44.880]  Why the hell is that?
[35:44.880 --> 35:48.400]  Because it's all a giant cult.
[35:48.400 --> 35:50.280]  There's no gun cult.
[35:50.280 --> 35:54.640]  There's gun culture, but nobody's forcing you to buy a gun.
[35:54.640 --> 35:57.000]  Nobody's forcing you to go learn to shoot a gun.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.240]  Nobody forces you to go shoot Skeet at a shotgun range.
[36:01.240 --> 36:05.080]  Nobody forces you to go become a handgun expert.
[36:05.080 --> 36:07.680]  Nobody forces you to do any of that.
[36:07.680 --> 36:12.680]  Ah, but see the vaccines, we want to force you to do that, so we're not going to go.
[36:12.680 --> 36:13.680]  We like that.
[36:13.680 --> 36:19.320]  We like, we like industries that are totalitarian and authoritarian, we're into that.
[36:19.320 --> 36:23.360]  But gun manufacturers and that, that's like, you know, self-government independent stuff,
[36:23.360 --> 36:27.480]  no, no, no, no, they're going to try to shut all that down.
[36:27.480 --> 36:32.640]  But they'll stick you with an ingredient that says not for human use.
[36:32.640 --> 36:35.320]  And so here they go, you know, I was going to wait to get in this with Alex, but I mean,
[36:35.320 --> 36:36.320]  I'm into it now.
[36:36.320 --> 36:42.240]  So California County requires businesses to submit COVID-19 vaccination statuses of
[36:42.240 --> 36:45.120]  all employees.
[36:45.120 --> 36:47.120]  Total tyranny.
[36:47.120 --> 36:53.280]  Boy, how much does California suck?
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.040]  Report Oregon to demand proof of vaccination to enter businesses and churches without
[36:58.040 --> 36:59.040]  a mask.
[36:59.040 --> 37:05.880]  And you know, maybe that's why, let me just reach over here to this other stack of news.
[37:05.880 --> 37:11.160]  Maybe that's why five Oregon counties vote to secede and join Idaho.
[37:11.160 --> 37:14.880]  So you basically have, I mean, who knows if this would happen.
[37:14.880 --> 37:20.160]  Maybe this is the solution, though, is to just vote our way out of Democrat cities
[37:20.160 --> 37:24.200]  and then give them the Portland organs and then they'll have the five that go down through
[37:24.200 --> 37:25.920]  Salem into Eugene.
[37:25.920 --> 37:29.920]  And then the rest of Oregon that doesn't want to live in a third world country hellhole
[37:29.920 --> 37:33.960]  joins Idaho.
[37:33.960 --> 37:35.640]  You could apply the same thing in California.
[37:35.640 --> 37:37.680]  There have been proposals.
[37:37.680 --> 37:41.960]  The Libs, the Commies, the Democrats, they get LA in San Francisco and, you know, up
[37:41.960 --> 37:44.720]  and down the coast and everywhere where they control.
[37:44.720 --> 37:49.200]  And then the rest of California that doesn't want to live in Swaller in a third world hellhole,
[37:49.200 --> 37:51.480]  they are now in New California.
[37:51.480 --> 37:52.480]  So it's the same thing.
[37:52.480 --> 37:53.480]  Maybe that's a real solution.
[37:53.480 --> 37:56.800]  It seems a little far-fetched, but maybe that's a legitimate solution.
[37:56.800 --> 38:00.600]  Just give the Democrats the cities that they've already destroyed and then just make sure
[38:00.600 --> 38:02.800]  they don't destroy the rest of the country.
[38:02.800 --> 38:03.800]  It's a good solution.
[38:03.800 --> 38:05.800]  I just don't know if it's feasible.
[38:05.800 --> 38:10.480]  But yeah, in Oregon, it's soft tyranny.
[38:10.480 --> 38:14.360]  Oh, oh, oh, which there's really no such thing of.
[38:14.360 --> 38:16.040]  But that's how they're trying to roll it out.
[38:16.040 --> 38:17.040]  Oh, no, no, no.
[38:17.040 --> 38:19.720]  You just have to have a vaccine to go to work.
[38:19.720 --> 38:22.120]  You just have to have a vaccine to go to church.
[38:22.120 --> 38:24.520]  You just have to have a vaccine to go to the ball game.
[38:24.520 --> 38:26.400]  You just have to have a vaccine to go to the grocery store.
[38:26.400 --> 38:28.240]  Oh, you mean I just have to have a vaccine to do everything?
[38:28.240 --> 38:30.480]  Oh, OK, gotcha.
[38:30.480 --> 38:32.680]  And so I realize now too, and you know what?
[38:32.680 --> 38:35.040]  Look, I'm not a Luddite.
[38:35.040 --> 38:37.640]  I like technology.
[38:37.640 --> 38:39.280]  I do.
[38:39.280 --> 38:43.320]  But see, you're starting to see how it's becoming force implemented where you can't even get
[38:43.320 --> 38:46.240]  a paper menu at a restaurant.
[38:46.240 --> 38:51.240]  And I don't like going to dinner with my phone on me.
[38:51.240 --> 38:53.320]  I don't like going to dinner with my iPhone on me.
[38:53.320 --> 38:54.320]  And so I don't have it.
[38:54.320 --> 38:56.520]  And I can't scan the menu.
[38:56.520 --> 39:00.640]  Again, that's not even me like, oh, I'm against this technology.
[39:00.640 --> 39:02.280]  Hey, it's kind of convenient.
[39:02.280 --> 39:07.120]  The other night I was at dinner, they had a digital menu and it had reviews on each food
[39:07.120 --> 39:08.120]  and likes and stuff.
[39:08.120 --> 39:09.400]  So it was kind of nice.
[39:09.400 --> 39:10.760]  I'm not against technology.
[39:10.760 --> 39:17.920]  But see, it'll get to a point where you, right now, it's just a smartphone.
[39:17.920 --> 39:24.880]  It'll be a smart chip, which, hey, you know what, great.
[39:24.880 --> 39:25.880]  Humans get chipped.
[39:25.880 --> 39:26.880]  Whatever.
[39:26.880 --> 39:27.880]  Maybe it'll be a good thing.
[39:27.880 --> 39:29.800]  I don't want it to be a part of a control system.
[39:29.800 --> 39:32.720]  I don't want it to be a part of a human oppression system.
[39:32.720 --> 39:35.120]  I don't want it to be part of a global tyranny.
[39:35.120 --> 39:38.720]  It should all be mandatory, or excuse me, it should never be mandatory for an inslip.
[39:38.720 --> 39:41.320]  It should all be a choice.
[39:41.320 --> 39:42.880]  And if you want it, go ahead.
[39:42.880 --> 39:44.960]  And maybe it'll be a good thing.
[39:44.960 --> 39:49.480]  But see, when they force it, then they control it and they control you.
[39:49.480 --> 39:53.200]  I mean, that's what it's really all about.
[39:53.200 --> 39:58.440]  By the way, there's a new, and this is kind of strange, swollen tongue, new COVID side
[39:58.440 --> 39:59.440]  effect.
[39:59.440 --> 40:05.760]  It's a little unclear about this story, but they say there's multiple examples of this,
[40:05.760 --> 40:07.120]  but they only cite one in this story.
[40:07.120 --> 40:10.560]  This man has a large, enlarged tongue.
[40:10.560 --> 40:14.240]  If you look at this picture, it just shows you the ridiculous, ridiculousness of the
[40:14.240 --> 40:15.240]  world.
[40:15.240 --> 40:16.240]  He's got the mask on.
[40:16.240 --> 40:20.320]  Folks, his tongue is so swollen, it's like six inches out of his mouth.
[40:20.320 --> 40:25.280]  I mean, the mask is bulging off of his face because his tongue is so swollen, but he has
[40:25.280 --> 40:26.280]  a mask on his nose.
[40:26.280 --> 40:27.760]  I mean, it's such a joke.
[40:27.760 --> 40:30.720]  But so these people are getting in, but they don't mention the vaccine.
[40:30.720 --> 40:36.400]  They're just saying, oh, it's a COVID side effect or a COVID treatment side effect, but
[40:36.400 --> 40:40.400]  they don't mention if they've had the vaccine.
[40:40.400 --> 40:43.560]  Seems like that'd be kind of a thing you would ask.
[40:43.560 --> 40:45.400]  Seems like that'd be the kind of thing you'd report on.
[40:45.400 --> 40:49.400]  Maybe this is a side effect from the vaccine, not COVID, but they're saying it's a COVID
[40:49.400 --> 40:51.840]  side effect or a COVID treatment side effect.
[40:51.840 --> 40:55.880]  So we're still learning more things about this viral release from China that Fauci and
[40:55.880 --> 40:56.880]  Obama gave them.
[40:56.880 --> 41:02.080]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April, 2021, and I just want to say something.
[41:02.080 --> 41:06.440]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[41:06.440 --> 41:10.760]  the years and has truly been answered a prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[41:10.760 --> 41:11.760]  you, the listeners of this show.
[41:11.760 --> 41:14.920]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[41:14.920 --> 41:18.360]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you've got
[41:18.360 --> 41:19.360]  red blood.
[41:19.360 --> 41:24.240]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.640]  and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you
[41:28.640 --> 41:29.640]  over the years.
[41:29.640 --> 41:33.160]  And as crazy as your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[41:33.160 --> 41:36.600]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[41:36.600 --> 41:41.280]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us

[45:01.040 --> 45:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.000]  Why should kids get vaccinated?
[45:12.000 --> 45:19.060]  They should get it soon, and then we should play.
[45:19.060 --> 45:20.060]  Yay!
[45:20.060 --> 45:21.060]  Are you so excited?
[45:21.060 --> 45:23.960]  We will get to play together when it's done.
[45:23.960 --> 45:24.960]  The shot!
[45:24.960 --> 45:29.960]  We will get to play together when it's done.
[45:29.960 --> 45:32.460]  The shot!
[45:32.460 --> 45:35.980]  We will get to play together.
[45:35.980 --> 45:44.100]  Wow. So there's more people on their social media account promoting the vaccine now for
[45:44.100 --> 45:51.060]  kids. The jab for kids. The experimental jab for kids. And we know they're getting paid
[45:51.060 --> 45:57.380]  to promote it as well. Thank God for the brave social media influencers who reported this
[45:57.380 --> 46:03.140]  story when they were offered thousands of dollars to promote the COVID vaccine and put
[46:03.140 --> 46:11.020]  their whole whole platform on the line, really. This is just sick demonic stuff, man. And so
[46:11.020 --> 46:19.260]  honestly, I'm living it and I don't even believe it. But let's just go ahead here. Let me just
[46:19.260 --> 46:24.460]  pull up my phone here because I have the document on my phone, but I want to do it live on air
[46:24.460 --> 46:34.300]  with the crew so that you can see. So guys, pull up a Wikipedia search, sm-102 Wikipedia. Plug
[46:34.300 --> 46:38.780]  that in and put it go ahead and just put it in Google because Google like interfaces with
[46:38.780 --> 46:42.100]  Wikipedia. And so there should be a result right there. Just go ahead. Guys, I just want to see
[46:42.100 --> 46:49.180]  this. Let's just do it live on air. Because again, they say this is all debunked. Okay,
[46:49.180 --> 46:59.820]  so I see search. All right, go ahead and put in Luciferese or Lucifer, Luciferese. So Lucifer
[46:59.820 --> 47:13.020]  ASE basically. No, no, no, with with the sm-2 sm-102 or maybe that's on. Oh, there you go. So
[47:13.020 --> 47:22.180]  according to Wikipedia. Yeah, the sm-102 does have Luciferese, lipid nanoparticles.
[47:22.180 --> 47:30.060]  I mean, again, I can't even I can't even deal with this. I can't even keep up with this.
[47:30.060 --> 47:45.340]  Don't get I look just just power you. I wouldn't get the damn vaccine. Okay. Okay. I'd be avoiding that at all costs. Wow. But
[47:45.340 --> 47:52.340]  oh, you know, tiktok or Instagram, I got paid thousands of dollars to promote the
[47:52.340 --> 47:59.140]  vaccine. Oh, are you you're complicit now in a crime against humanity. Congratulations.
[47:59.140 --> 48:09.940]  Good for you. And you promoted it to kids. Wow. Wow. Oh, my gosh. Look at this. This
[48:09.940 --> 48:20.740]  nightmare. Look at this mental. Put it up. Put it up. I'm Lucifer coming for your children.
[48:20.740 --> 48:39.700]  What was that? That was weird. Oh, God save us. All right. I need to move on because I've
[48:39.700 --> 48:47.460]  got other news and I want to open up the phone lines today because we haven't taken too many
[48:47.460 --> 48:51.780]  calls this week and just intelligence from you on the ground as important as anything.
[48:51.780 --> 48:55.380]  I mean, I could open the phone line and say, Hey, what are you hearing about the vaccines?
[48:55.380 --> 48:58.980]  And we'll have dozens of people call in and talk about the negative side effects or family
[48:58.980 --> 49:04.980]  members dying. You know, because that's what you know, that's a fun Friday, but that's
[49:04.980 --> 49:13.140]  what we have to do here at info wars. Nobody else will do it. You know what, let me finish
[49:13.140 --> 49:19.140]  up with some of this Biden stuff. So we talked about his appointees that are that are about
[49:19.140 --> 49:24.380]  to get fabulously rich off of green energy deals that I'm sure they're going to pass
[49:24.380 --> 49:30.660]  that are invested in windmills that are invested in electric car vehicles, batteries. One of
[49:30.660 --> 49:39.340]  them worked for Huawei. Yeah, Huawei and the Chinese government. Same difference. You know,
[49:39.340 --> 49:47.220]  this is the Biden administration. But so we covered, I guess it was it yesterday or Wednesday.
[49:47.220 --> 49:51.020]  When was it that Biden insulted the Coast Guard? I think it was yesterday. Everything's a
[49:51.020 --> 49:57.940]  blur when you're Joe Biden or covering him. I think it was yesterday we covered he insulted
[49:57.940 --> 50:03.980]  the Coast Guard graduates and he called them doll. Well, it turns out that perhaps the insult
[50:03.980 --> 50:11.460]  to the Coast Guard graduates was not the worst part of that speech. In fact, the joke that
[50:11.460 --> 50:20.020]  he tried to tell he plagiarized from Ronald Reagan, who told the joke to Coast Guard graduates
[50:20.020 --> 50:26.900]  in 77. Biden said when he was when he was 77, Biden is 78. So go ahead. Here's here's
[50:26.900 --> 50:31.820]  Ronald Reagan landing the joke that gets a bunch of laughs compared to Joe Biden stealing
[50:31.820 --> 50:36.580]  it from Reagan butchering it and then getting nothing but crickets because he sucks. Here's
[50:36.580 --> 50:43.300]  the video. My Coast Guard aides have been excellent. One of them taught me that and I quote the
[50:43.300 --> 50:53.060]  Coast Guard is that hard nucleus about which the Navy forms in time of war. I can only
[50:53.060 --> 51:00.380]  assume that you will enjoy educating your family about how the Coast Guard is quote the hard
[51:00.380 --> 51:09.780]  nucleus around the Navy forms in times of war. You are quite you're a really dull class.
[51:09.780 --> 51:19.980]  What an ass. What a pompous ass. First he steals Reagan's joke doesn't land it. And I love
[51:19.980 --> 51:25.300]  how he even throws in the quote too. He throws it and I quote you're quoting Reagan. You
[51:25.300 --> 51:32.940]  ass and I quote you stole the whole thing from Reagan. You butchered it and then you
[51:32.940 --> 51:38.300]  blame the cadets or you blame the Coast Guard graduates and call them dull because you stole
[51:38.300 --> 51:46.980]  and butchered a joke. This guy is just an embarrassment of riches but but but like fools
[51:46.980 --> 51:52.860]  gold riches. Oh and I mean the media just loves the guy too. The Democrat voters just
[51:52.860 --> 52:05.700]  love old Joe. My gosh he's not done stealing credit though. During a press conference last
[52:05.700 --> 52:15.860]  night he said he helped broker the ceasefire between Israel and the mosque. That's a lie
[52:15.860 --> 52:26.340]  it was Egypt. That story is at the Gateway Punnett. It has the video and everything.
[52:26.340 --> 52:31.900]  But it was Egypt. It wasn't Joe Biden. So he lied about that too. But he lies about everything
[52:31.900 --> 52:34.820]  and quite frankly he doesn't even know what the hell's going on. They don't even let him
[52:34.820 --> 52:39.740]  drive the truck at the Ford power plant. Who whose call do you think that was. You think
[52:39.740 --> 52:43.140]  that was Joe's call Secret Service call or do you think the Ford plant was like hey look
[52:43.140 --> 52:47.540]  this is a seventy thousand eighty thousand dollar truck. Do you think we could have maybe
[52:47.540 --> 52:51.540]  this the safety driver with the safety wheel drive the car and Biden can just kind of you
[52:51.540 --> 52:56.300]  know drive pretend he's driving around where the aviators photo shoot. And you know Biden
[52:56.300 --> 53:01.860]  he says oh I'm not supposed to take questions. Oh I got to go. Oh Nancy what should we do
[53:01.860 --> 53:08.260]  whatever you want me to do Nancy. He says all this on a hot mic. No I'm not supposed
[53:08.260 --> 53:12.740]  to talk to you guys. According to who you're supposedly the leader of the free world.
[53:12.740 --> 53:18.780]  But you're not free yourself. OK. Not even free to drive a eighty thousand dollar electric
[53:18.780 --> 53:23.460]  Ford truck that he loved so much. Oh he's not how great it is. Oh this is great. It
[53:23.460 --> 53:28.460]  zips around. He's not even driving it. Again you see this stuff and like it's just it's
[53:28.460 --> 53:33.020]  so unbelievable. I mean you see the guy's hand on the wheel and it's like I still don't
[53:33.020 --> 53:38.940]  believe it. I still don't believe that it's so bad and the media is so pathetic. I don't
[53:38.940 --> 53:43.220]  even think it's that they would cover it up that he can't drive a car. I think that they're
[53:43.220 --> 53:48.580]  so dumb and they're so unobservant and unaware that they literally did not even notice that
[53:48.580 --> 53:52.700]  there was a second wheel and a secret service agent driving. Or maybe it was a secret service
[53:52.700 --> 53:56.940]  agent who said I'm not getting in the car with that guy. They said we'll give you a
[53:56.940 --> 54:01.580]  steering wheel. So in case he you know goes crazy or whatever you can be in charge. OK
[54:01.580 --> 54:14.460]  fine. Wow. But seriously the media the White House Press Corps is probably so dumb and
[54:14.460 --> 54:21.860]  so unobservant except maybe Peter Ducey. And like there's there's other good ones but they're
[54:21.860 --> 54:24.820]  not allowed to follow still because of COVID maybe they'll let them back in. But you know
[54:24.820 --> 54:29.900]  it's the limited numbers because of COVID. No just the ones that Biden approves of. They
[54:29.900 --> 54:35.940]  probably are so unobservant they wouldn't even notice a second steering wheel. So imagine
[54:35.940 --> 54:40.740]  being so confident in the Biden administration. You're so confident that the media lackeys
[54:40.740 --> 54:44.740]  you have following you around are so dumb that they won't even notice you're not even
[54:44.740 --> 54:52.380]  driving the truck. Wow. Amazing. And then I guess he assumes the entire world is so dumb
[54:52.380 --> 54:56.460]  that he'll take credit for the ceasefire between Israel and Amos even though everyone knows
[54:56.460 --> 55:05.980]  it was Egypt and President LCC. Steelworker Union that endorsed Biden now begging him
[55:05.980 --> 55:11.580]  not to end Trump's tariff on foreign steel. Oh so all the cheap bad steel coming in from
[55:11.580 --> 55:15.900]  China is about to come in again and put the steel manufacturers out of business. And by
[55:15.900 --> 55:22.180]  the way you know nobody made a big enough deal out of this and I still won't today but I
[55:22.180 --> 55:34.220]  should. You know Biden opened the pipeline for Russia. I mean he Biden shut down our
[55:34.220 --> 55:41.540]  pipelines and opened Russian pipelines in Europe. If Trump did that what would they be saying.
[55:41.540 --> 55:45.740]  Do I even have to say the word Russian collusion because Rachel Maddow says it a hundred times
[55:45.740 --> 55:51.220]  a night. One of the most common questions I get on air but also off air when I'm just
[55:51.220 --> 55:58.500]  out and about is Alex what do I say to my family about the vaccines. How do I warn them.
[55:58.500 --> 56:02.860]  Well the problem is there's so many problems with it. So many facts. The history of contaminated
[56:02.860 --> 56:07.300]  vaccines the fact that they have liability protection in the U.S. and Europe the fact
[56:07.300 --> 56:11.740]  that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines
[56:11.740 --> 56:17.300]  and the whole history of secret experimentation on at risk groups of poor blacks poor whites
[56:17.300 --> 56:22.220]  Native Americans. The list goes on and on. But what about the fact that Fauci testified
[56:22.220 --> 56:27.460]  to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of two thousand and twenty one
[56:27.460 --> 56:33.780]  that around half of the NIH CDC staff medical doctors or all just scientists have refused
[56:33.780 --> 56:38.300]  to take the vaccine until they can say yeah I think what half of the doctors are scared
[56:38.300 --> 56:41.780]  to take it. That's the same thing in the private practices out there somewhere numbers that
[56:41.780 --> 56:47.740]  that's not something I'm going to be taking. That's very very simple. There's your answer.
[56:47.740 --> 56:56.220]  Your brain your heart your bones your liver your eyes everything has a better shot at
[56:56.220 --> 56:59.500]  surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil. We've got the

[58:03.940 --> 58:12.540]  the Alex Jones show. Alex is joining us in five minutes. Again. I spent a good segment
[58:12.540 --> 58:19.080]  or two on the not for human use ingredients in the covid vaccine and all the other incredible
[58:19.080 --> 58:25.820]  stuff in the medical documentation. I spent about a segment and a half on Biden's administration
[58:25.820 --> 58:32.340]  set to make millions and millions of dollars if they get green new energy deals passed
[58:32.340 --> 58:39.340]  with his administration members invested in wind and solar big time and in electric vehicles.
[58:39.340 --> 58:44.060]  So it was never about the climate. It was always about them making money. Just ask Obama
[58:44.060 --> 58:49.620]  and Solyndra. And so I barely even. And so I should spend a segment. But see this is
[58:49.620 --> 58:55.700]  just cut and dry. Joe Biden is shutting down American pipelines. Democrats are proposing
[58:55.700 --> 59:00.700]  to shut preemptively shut down American pipelines. Hey a hacker may want to shut down our pipeline.
[59:00.700 --> 59:08.700]  So let's shut it down first. Good logic Gretchen Whitmer. But Biden is shutting down US pipelines
[59:08.700 --> 59:18.540]  costing thousands hundreds of thousands of jobs. And then increasing our energy prices.
[59:18.540 --> 59:25.540]  But then he OK's a Russian pipeline through Europe that Donald Trump rejected. Trump said
[59:25.540 --> 59:29.340]  no you're not going to do this because they would control the flow of oil through this
[59:29.340 --> 59:35.180]  European region. And now Biden gave Russia full control. I actually like Russia. I actually
[59:35.180 --> 59:40.660]  like Putin. But they'll definitely use this as geopolitical leverage in the region for
[59:40.660 --> 59:46.380]  sure. Because Putin puts Russia first at the expense of other countries. He doesn't give
[59:46.380 --> 59:53.820]  it down. But see Biden puts America last and for all the media harpies like Rachel Maddow
[59:53.820 --> 59:57.460]  who still can't get over it. She's completely lost her mind. I don't know if they put her
[59:57.460 --> 1:00:05.340]  in a straight jacket and take her to a rubber room after her show every night but they should.
[1:00:05.340 --> 1:00:16.020]  And so I mean you can't even write this. It's cut and dry. Joe Biden shut off US oil pipelines
[1:00:16.020 --> 1:00:25.060]  and opened a pipeline for Russia that Trump shut down. And again the media harpies for
[1:00:25.060 --> 1:00:29.780]  four years chanted Russian collusion over Trump. They spent about 50 million dollars
[1:00:29.780 --> 1:00:36.340]  investigating Trump. Found nothing. Mueller admitted they had nothing. And now you have
[1:00:36.340 --> 1:00:40.460]  I mean I'm not even saying Russian collusion. Maybe there's collusion. Maybe he made a deal
[1:00:40.460 --> 1:00:44.740]  with Putin. You know maybe Putin controls Biden with the with the mayor of Moscow's
[1:00:44.740 --> 1:00:48.980]  wife that was involved with Hunter Biden and millions of dollars also involved with child
[1:00:48.980 --> 1:00:53.620]  sex trafficking. I don't know. Maybe there's something going on there. But what I do know
[1:00:53.620 --> 1:01:00.660]  is that Joe Biden shut down US energy pipelines US US pipelines and allow Russia to open a
[1:01:00.660 --> 1:01:10.460]  pipeline that Trump had them shut down. And you won't hear a peep about Russian collusion
[1:01:10.460 --> 1:01:20.660]  or how bad Putin is because Joe Biden opened an oil pipeline for them. You just won't have
[1:01:20.660 --> 1:01:29.180]  it because it's Joe Biden and he's a Democrat. And so you know the story came out about Chris
[1:01:29.180 --> 1:01:34.300]  Cuomo is strategizing with his brother about how to cover up a sexual harassment scandal.
[1:01:34.300 --> 1:01:38.500]  The word is that Andrew called Chris up the host of CNN. He said Chris I'm in deep trouble.
[1:01:38.500 --> 1:01:42.780]  I got sexual harassment scandals coming up all these women and Chris said he said Andrew
[1:01:42.780 --> 1:01:47.180]  what are you worried about. You're a Democrat. So you're good to go. Alex Jones is on the
[1:01:47.180 --> 1:01:51.060]  line. He's going to be taking over in the next segment. I mean Alex it's also big the
[1:01:51.060 --> 1:01:56.780]  ingredients in the vaccine. Biden hiring corrupt officials that we know of. Find me the man
[1:01:56.780 --> 1:02:00.740]  I'll find the crime. Leticia James Biden colluding with Putin. I mean this is just unbelievable
[1:02:00.740 --> 1:02:07.340]  Alex the former FBI director paying a hundred thousand dollars to Biden in the laptop emails
[1:02:07.340 --> 1:02:13.660]  they admit are real for business. So the vice president would engage in crimes for him open
[1:02:13.660 --> 1:02:18.060]  bribery. We have a corrupt globalist system taking over the country. Something hit me
[1:02:18.060 --> 1:02:24.020]  this morning. I wasn't going to shoot a report today. I wasn't going to come on air because
[1:02:24.020 --> 1:02:28.020]  this has been a kind of a work case and there's not been one day that I haven't taken off.
[1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:33.140]  So my there's been one day that I haven't worked and so my wife's a little angry at
[1:02:33.140 --> 1:02:38.860]  me. So I said OK I'll take off the whole day today. And then about 7 a.m. I was scrolling
[1:02:38.860 --> 1:02:44.180]  around on the Internet doing some research and I came across a video that totally blew
[1:02:44.180 --> 1:02:49.980]  me away. That's as big a smoking gun as the great reset documents as operation lockstep
[1:02:49.980 --> 1:02:54.620]  is crimson contagion. This event two oh one. We're going to break this huge news on the
[1:02:54.620 --> 1:02:59.060]  other side. Stay with us. Listen up Patriots. I'm running a sale that's the biggest I've
[1:02:59.060 --> 1:03:03.620]  ever run on three products that are already selling out. Well then why am I selling it
[1:03:03.620 --> 1:03:08.060]  then at 50 percent off or 60 percent off depending on which sale you go with because I know a
[1:03:08.060 --> 1:03:11.100]  lot of you are on the fence. You haven't tried it and I know you're going to get hooked once
[1:03:11.100 --> 1:03:18.020]  you do. So for one week only we're running 50 percent off on ultimate fish oil 50 percent
[1:03:18.020 --> 1:03:22.700]  off on winter some with D3 and K for immune system and oh my gosh people love this so
[1:03:22.700 --> 1:03:27.740]  much but sold out for months back in limited supply turbo force 10 hour clean energy is
[1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:33.420]  40 percent off. But you can get them all three together in the optimum trifecta back for
[1:03:33.420 --> 1:03:38.620]  60 percent off. We've never offered that on these products. It's basically a lost leader.
[1:03:38.620 --> 1:03:42.100]  I want you to get them. I want you to try them. I want you to love them. So believe me you're
[1:03:42.100 --> 1:03:47.020]  going to be a blown away. Go to info or store dot com. We're running this Monday through
[1:03:47.020 --> 1:03:52.500]  Sunday and the deal is over best deal ever. Take advantage of it and info or store dot
[1:03:52.500 --> 1:04:13.700]  com and fund the info war. Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this live
[1:04:13.700 --> 1:04:21.180]  Friday edition. So many huge developments are unfolding as we speak. I'm going to be live
[1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:25.020]  here for the next two segments that I want you to be taking back over again. I'm your
[1:04:25.020 --> 1:04:31.860]  host Alex Jones. Now we break a lot of big news here on a routine basis. But the news
[1:04:31.860 --> 1:04:37.900]  I'm about to break right now is as big as operation lockstep for the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:04:37.900 --> 1:04:46.180]  11 years ago. It's as big as State Department of Random 200 from 1974 47 years ago. It's
[1:04:46.180 --> 1:04:52.140]  as big as event 201 from two years ago. It's as big as crimson contagion from two years
[1:04:52.140 --> 1:04:58.100]  ago. It is the admitted blueprint for the world government takeover and then the end game
[1:04:58.100 --> 1:05:03.340]  with the world government takeover is depopulation. What we're about to play is as important as
[1:05:03.340 --> 1:05:10.500]  my historic film in game blueprint for global enslavement. I have a tendency to break so
[1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:16.180]  much big news and have so many incredible gas that I will not go back and review what
[1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:22.180]  I've done. In fact usually when I'm on national TV or even a documentary I don't even watch
[1:05:22.180 --> 1:05:27.340]  it because I know what I said in the documentary. And there are so many shows and things I don't
[1:05:27.340 --> 1:05:36.820]  review them. But this morning I happened to just run across randomly a clip of myself
[1:05:36.820 --> 1:05:47.180]  from 12 years ago in 2009 on a national documentary television show titled America Conspiracies
[1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:53.980]  and the caption said Alex Jones predicted it all with precision 12 years ago so I clicked
[1:05:53.980 --> 1:05:59.660]  it and we probably put that Twitter account up there on screen and I sent it to the producers
[1:05:59.660 --> 1:06:10.420]  this morning and it's word for word exactly what I said then that is now unfolding now.
[1:06:10.420 --> 1:06:16.860]  Now you have to ask yourself how did we exactly predict word for word what's happening now.
[1:06:16.860 --> 1:06:22.180]  Well because we didn't predict it. And I remember Dr. Rima Labo who we should probably get back
[1:06:22.180 --> 1:06:26.540]  on the broadcast medical doctor her husband was the former head of US Special Forces and
[1:06:26.540 --> 1:06:32.420]  then the head of all the Army's secret operations the head of Army Intelligence. That was Major
[1:06:32.420 --> 1:06:37.700]  General Stubblebine who died a few years ago and some people say he's a bad guy. I mean
[1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:42.780]  I think he was a patriot overall but he was involved in volunteer mind control programs
[1:06:42.780 --> 1:06:50.180]  a lot of other you know really really intense stuff. He was in on the meetings for the depopulation
[1:06:50.180 --> 1:06:55.380]  plans back in the 70s and 80s and of course wasn't for them. But that was US government
[1:06:55.380 --> 1:07:02.180]  policy in 74 when he was the head of the Army at that point. His wife is a top medical doctor
[1:07:02.180 --> 1:07:06.780]  who did serve heads of state. I didn't just believe her when she said it. I went and looked
[1:07:06.780 --> 1:07:12.020]  it up because you had to do research and she's had been the physician for multiple heads
[1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:17.900]  of state royalty. There's not many of those in the West but look towards the Netherlands
[1:07:17.900 --> 1:07:23.020]  look towards the UK. You know Prince Philip famously was constantly talking about an engineered
[1:07:23.020 --> 1:07:28.020]  virus to depopulate the planet. They've also made those those statements publicly. So I'm
[1:07:28.020 --> 1:07:35.260]  about to play you a four and a half minute clip. That's just a small piece of the depopulation
[1:07:35.260 --> 1:07:44.820]  episode. Episode 21 that isn't even listed on the Wikipedia page about American conspiracies
[1:07:44.820 --> 1:07:50.060]  that ran for three seasons. I like Jesse and Tura. I was in the first season of the second
[1:07:50.060 --> 1:07:53.900]  season. I thought it went too much into Bigfoot and stuff in the third season. So I told him
[1:07:53.900 --> 1:07:59.100]  I wasn't going to be part of it. I was actually even by the same production company offered
[1:07:59.100 --> 1:08:04.660]  a TV show similar to one Joe Rogan picked up later that just kind of made fun of conspiracies.
[1:08:04.660 --> 1:08:08.820]  I don't want to be part of that. And Ventura didn't want to either. So he he left the show
[1:08:08.820 --> 1:08:14.460]  after that. But he did the third season. But I basically did the research for the police
[1:08:14.460 --> 1:08:20.020]  state episode and for the population episode. Both were erased off the Teavos off the TV
[1:08:20.020 --> 1:08:26.540]  hours. And both were deep six. You really can't find them today. I took us some looking to
[1:08:26.540 --> 1:08:32.700]  find them. Not even our own archives but but but on the web. The shows were seen tens of
[1:08:32.700 --> 1:08:38.900]  millions of times. Congress called for investigations over them. They called for Ventura show to
[1:08:38.900 --> 1:08:43.140]  be canceled over them. And that's when the show's creators kind of went into UFOs and
[1:08:43.140 --> 1:08:48.940]  Bigfoot and things the next season. So this is historic. This is powerful. It deals with
[1:08:48.940 --> 1:08:54.340]  depopulation deals with being run by the UN of the WHO. It deals with vaccines that then
[1:08:54.340 --> 1:09:02.060]  caused the spread of of shedding. It deals with how this calling was coming very soon
[1:09:02.060 --> 1:09:07.300]  because General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo ran in those circles. They were aware of the planet
[1:09:07.300 --> 1:09:12.060]  was already on the shelf. Now the plan was on the shelf in 2011. That's two years after
[1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:17.980]  this interview. That's Operation Lockstep from the UN for the Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:09:17.980 --> 1:09:23.180]  But here is the censored, deleted pieces of the report. They don't want you to see. We'll
[1:09:23.180 --> 1:09:26.700]  later post demand on video. I hope you share it. Here it is.
[1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:33.220]  Entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medical treatments
[1:09:33.220 --> 1:09:38.540]  namely vaccines. We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up not just in the United States
[1:09:38.540 --> 1:09:44.060]  but worldwide under the UN and the World Health Organization. Who's behind all this?
[1:09:44.060 --> 1:09:48.220]  The Bilderberg Group. They want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their
[1:09:48.220 --> 1:09:52.380]  forced depopulation agenda. And they want to do it through the medical system. And that's
[1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:57.460]  why vaccines are so important. We know that many of these vaccines turn out to have serious
[1:09:57.460 --> 1:10:03.220]  adverse reactions. That this is being done by design. They kill you slowly over time.
[1:10:03.220 --> 1:10:06.740]  That's why they're called soft kill. And I've got an insider I think you should really talk
[1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:11.940]  to. Dr. Rima Labo. But she doesn't live inside the United States because she's so concerned
[1:10:11.940 --> 1:10:16.420]  about all the police state developments that are taking place. As soon as you and I finish
[1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:23.340]  you're leaving the country again. Why? Because in a very short time not today not tomorrow
[1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:33.740]  but very soon we'll be facing compulsory vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[1:10:33.740 --> 1:10:39.100]  First of all let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization has decided
[1:10:39.100 --> 1:10:45.460]  that we have 90 percent too many people. The World Health Organization has been working
[1:10:45.460 --> 1:10:54.300]  since 1974 on vaccines to create permanent sterility. This process has already been ongoing.
[1:10:54.300 --> 1:11:04.180]  To make matters worse we know that the vaccines that were illegally approved by the FDA contain
[1:11:04.180 --> 1:11:11.180]  a substance called squalene. Squalene. An organic compound used in vaccines to stimulate
[1:11:11.180 --> 1:11:17.660]  the immune system and increase the response. If I inject you with squalene your immune
[1:11:17.660 --> 1:11:23.300]  system will attack the squalene but then it starts attacking all of the parts of your
[1:11:23.300 --> 1:11:27.700]  body. What does that look like when you meet a person to whom that is happening. It looks
[1:11:27.700 --> 1:11:34.700]  like Gulf War Syndrome. It looks like every joint in the body is swollen and intolerably
[1:11:34.700 --> 1:11:39.460]  painful and immobilized. This is in these shocks they're going to give us. It's in some
[1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:46.580]  of them but the U.S. government has to trick up their sleeve. They will induce a pandemic
[1:11:46.580 --> 1:11:54.420]  using the nasal mist vaccine which is a live attenuated virus. That means that if I take
[1:11:54.420 --> 1:12:00.540]  it I can infect you. You're going to get the flu. Everybody around us is going to get the
[1:12:00.540 --> 1:12:07.020]  flu. Then the United States government based on their statements that they've already made
[1:12:07.020 --> 1:12:14.700]  will say oh my we have a pandemic. Oh my goodness we don't have enough doses. So we'll add
[1:12:14.700 --> 1:12:23.500]  mix squalene at the 90,000 injection stations that the Department of Health and Human Services
[1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:31.020]  announced that they will ship the vaccines too. People lining up sometimes by the hundreds
[1:12:31.020 --> 1:12:44.780]  for an H1N1 flu shot. What that means is a holocaust. A genocidal holocaust. Men and
[1:12:44.780 --> 1:12:51.820]  women will thicken and die and those who survive will be infertile. Let me tell you a story.
[1:12:51.820 --> 1:13:01.500]  In 2003 I had a patient in my drug free medical practice who was ahead of state and one day
[1:13:01.500 --> 1:13:08.340]  she said you know it's almost time for the great culling to begin. The what? That's what
[1:13:08.340 --> 1:13:16.500]  I said. The what? She said the great culling C-U-L-L-I-N-G when you thin the herd. I said
[1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:24.580]  what are you talking about? She said it's almost time for the useless eaters to be culled
[1:13:24.580 --> 1:13:32.980]  and she said those are the people who are consuming our non-renewable natural resources.
[1:13:32.980 --> 1:13:44.940]  I said who are the people who make this decision? She said we the aristocrats. Alright ladies
[1:13:44.940 --> 1:13:50.220]  and gentlemen we're going to go to break. We're going to come back on the other side
[1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:54.100]  and we're going to have the rest of the story. That's from 12 years ago what you just saw.
[1:13:54.100 --> 1:13:59.340]  Again I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person but because of the globalist
[1:13:59.340 --> 1:14:04.100]  they're attacking humanity. I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and
[1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:08.420]  we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God and I know
[1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:12.100]  some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me a break. The
[1:14:12.100 --> 1:14:16.260]  Satanism is out of the open and I've always been a Christian but now the fact that it's
[1:14:16.260 --> 1:14:19.660]  a fight between good and evil is so clear and I get it a lot of you have been turned
[1:14:19.660 --> 1:14:24.780]  off by big churches a lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system
[1:14:24.780 --> 1:14:29.700]  and I get it me too believe me I'm one of them but it's that relationship with God and
[1:14:29.700 --> 1:14:36.260]  just God's universe that God created that is so essential and God created the universe
[1:14:36.260 --> 1:14:40.220]  for us to have communion with God through and to have life and so that's what Info Wars

[1:15:54.580 --> 1:16:02.300]  One of the most popular memes on the internet in the last decade has been Alex Jones was
[1:16:02.300 --> 1:16:08.980]  right but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook making
[1:16:08.980 --> 1:16:13.860]  the globalists pull their hair out in anger. Let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today
[1:16:13.860 --> 1:16:17.900]  and thanks for your support. We're still on air at infohorns.com and banned on video
[1:16:17.900 --> 1:16:21.460]  radio stations and TV stations across the country. And our film Endgame, censored and
[1:16:21.460 --> 1:16:26.220]  taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years ago, is now available again.
[1:16:26.220 --> 1:16:30.940]  We have reprinted it on high quality DVD in HD. It has a zero country code meaning anyone
[1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:34.780]  in the world is authorized to make copies of it and I'm asking you to get the original,
[1:16:34.780 --> 1:16:37.900]  make copies, give it to everyone you know, get it on local access TV, give it to your
[1:16:37.900 --> 1:16:41.780]  pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever you do, warn
[1:16:41.780 --> 1:16:46.860]  the world. This film uses their own documents and own statements 14 years ago to expose
[1:16:46.860 --> 1:16:52.060]  them. It's more important than ever. Available at infohorns.com. That's infohorns.com.
[1:16:52.060 --> 1:16:56.820]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:16:56.820 --> 1:17:00.900]  I'm not going to say this five times on the road to the obnoxious. I'm saying it because
[1:17:00.900 --> 1:17:07.540]  it's the key to victory over these criminals. Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted
[1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:14.140]  that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses,
[1:17:14.140 --> 1:17:18.700]  you name it, have taken the so-called COVID-19 franken shot. I'm going to say it the second
[1:17:18.700 --> 1:17:27.700]  time. Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refuse to take the franken shots.
[1:17:27.700 --> 1:17:32.260]  They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned in most countries
[1:17:32.260 --> 1:17:36.580]  around the world. This is an attack on the American people, the people of the world.
[1:17:36.580 --> 1:17:42.860]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more times. Around
[1:17:42.860 --> 1:17:47.500]  half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff refuse to take
[1:17:47.500 --> 1:17:52.980]  the vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine.
[1:17:52.980 --> 1:17:59.220]  You shouldn't either. You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[1:17:59.220 --> 1:18:29.060]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:18:29.060 --> 1:18:33.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host. I'll destroy your text over in the next
[1:18:33.740 --> 1:18:39.220]  segment. And he's gotten Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer who's already filed a bunch of lawsuits,
[1:18:39.220 --> 1:18:44.980]  set to file more with Robert Kennedy Jr. Like I'm told that's happening at any moment.
[1:18:44.980 --> 1:18:49.260]  On Oregon and other states like New York saying you've got to have it to go to church or go
[1:18:49.260 --> 1:18:52.740]  to a restaurant or go to a grocery store, you've got to have the government put something
[1:18:52.740 --> 1:18:57.860]  experimental in you in total violation of the Nuremberg Code where you can't buy and
[1:18:57.860 --> 1:19:02.100]  sell. It's the market of the beast. Violates the Nuremberg Code. It is completely illegal.
[1:19:02.100 --> 1:19:06.540]  It's one thing to intimidate a lot of people and then emergency authorize something deadly
[1:19:06.540 --> 1:19:12.300]  and trick folks to take it. That's still premeditated. It's still criminal. But to do this now is
[1:19:12.300 --> 1:19:16.740]  Nazi level. And so we're going to be breaking all that old Robert Barnes coming up next
[1:19:16.740 --> 1:19:20.140]  hour. You need to listen to this information and think, hey, just because you're in Texas
[1:19:20.140 --> 1:19:25.180]  or South Dakota or Florida where people stand up for more freedom and they're still Americans,
[1:19:25.180 --> 1:19:29.140]  but you're safe because the globalist will take over your area next. We've got to fight
[1:19:29.140 --> 1:19:34.660]  for California and New York and Spain and the UK and Australia and Canada that are still
[1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:40.100]  under lockdowns and hellish control. And the blue cities where they're bringing in such
[1:19:40.100 --> 1:19:44.340]  illegal activity, ordering businesses that's in denser servitude. And of course they're
[1:19:44.340 --> 1:19:46.980]  saying, oh, it'll be too hard to know whether it's real or not. Everybody's got to have
[1:19:46.980 --> 1:19:52.180]  an app. So the churches line up for the government to have an app, whether you've taken an experimental
[1:19:52.180 --> 1:19:59.340]  injection before you can go see your friends and family and worship God. If you told somebody
[1:19:59.340 --> 1:20:03.700]  this two years ago, they'd laugh at you. But now here it is today. Here's an article by
[1:20:03.700 --> 1:20:11.500]  Adon Salazar off the known numbers currently. Sperm counts have dropped roughly 50% just
[1:20:11.500 --> 1:20:18.940]  in the last 50 years and they're set to go down by 2045, 99% total infertility. And they
[1:20:18.940 --> 1:20:24.020]  admit in the government studies, oh, the most dangerous place is your kitchen, your bathroom,
[1:20:24.020 --> 1:20:30.220]  your laundry room, the chemicals being purposely put in plastic linings, everything lowers
[1:20:30.220 --> 1:20:36.700]  your fertility, feminizes men and ultra feminizes women, making them accelerate their aging.
[1:20:36.700 --> 1:20:40.740]  All of it was in Brave New World written in 1932. Huxley, before he died, admitted it was
[1:20:40.740 --> 1:20:46.900]  actually a real plan by his brother, the head eugenicist on the planet, Julian Huxley.
[1:20:46.900 --> 1:20:53.060]  So here it is, infowars.com, infowars.com. Remember, I did a whole treat as 10 years
[1:20:53.060 --> 1:20:57.580]  ago on this, just one of many things I broke down. I took covered chemicals in the food
[1:20:57.580 --> 1:21:04.820]  and water 27 years ago when I first got on air in 1995. But the media grabbed where I
[1:21:04.820 --> 1:21:09.220]  said, look, I'm not against gay people, but I don't want them putting chemicals in the
[1:21:09.220 --> 1:21:12.740]  water that turn the frigging frogs gay. And they took that out of context to make it a
[1:21:12.740 --> 1:21:17.380]  joke but see how vindicated we are. The frogs then try to have sex with their male frogs
[1:21:17.380 --> 1:21:21.700]  and it happens with fish, happens with mammals, this is all. And now they're saying, oh, accept
[1:21:21.700 --> 1:21:26.500]  it and push it on your children, it's about the population, ladies and gentlemen. That's
[1:21:26.500 --> 1:21:30.460]  what this is. That's why Klaus Schwab and the UN want more gay characters and teach
[1:21:30.460 --> 1:21:34.420]  kids about it because they don't want you to have a family or have children. And those
[1:21:34.420 --> 1:21:38.980]  that do, many get together, women, they then go with CPS and take the nuclear families
[1:21:38.980 --> 1:21:42.860]  children away and give them to them and they deserve it because they're gay. Tim Cook grows
[1:21:42.860 --> 1:21:46.140]  death camps. It's okay, he's gay. You see, this is how it all works. So it's this new
[1:21:46.140 --> 1:21:52.820]  ruling class hunting down the Christians, but it's like we're the humans and it's a
[1:21:52.820 --> 1:22:00.180]  plant of the apes or something and the leftist overlords are feeding on us. Let's continue.
[1:22:00.180 --> 1:22:06.820]  Fertility crisis, men will no longer produce sperm by 2045 says top epidemiologists. So
[1:22:06.820 --> 1:22:12.780]  there you go, Prince Philip, Ted Turner, they all see us as animals as like the Eloi and
[1:22:12.780 --> 1:22:17.580]  they are the Morlocks or they're the apes and plant of the apes and you know, we're
[1:22:17.580 --> 1:22:22.220]  the humans and they've done reverse roles where the psychos are on top of society and
[1:22:22.220 --> 1:22:26.260]  the common good nature people are on the bottom being fed on. That's what all this is, is
[1:22:26.260 --> 1:22:33.540]  destruction of due process, a total annihilation of people being able to take control of their
[1:22:33.540 --> 1:22:38.900]  bodies. And again, it's all done through fraud. It's all done through intimidation. Let's
[1:22:38.900 --> 1:22:45.220]  continue. Report Oregon to demand proof of vaccination in her businesses, churches without
[1:22:45.220 --> 1:22:49.300]  a mask. Well, what about the First Amendment? Congress shall make no law respecting the
[1:22:49.300 --> 1:22:53.980]  establishment of religion or having the free exercise thereof or of the press or the people
[1:22:53.980 --> 1:23:00.460]  of the right to assemble for redress of grievances. Congress has no jurisdiction. State governments
[1:23:00.460 --> 1:23:05.740]  have no jurisdiction over churches. But worldwide, the state once controlled those churches and
[1:23:05.740 --> 1:23:09.540]  most they got control through the ecumenical movement, the World Council of Churches. The
[1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:14.820]  Vatican's head is a globalist. The main Protestant people are globalist. Billy Graham, Jr. is
[1:23:14.820 --> 1:23:19.180]  out promoting the vaccines. The churches are promoting QR codes to go to church. It's
[1:23:19.180 --> 1:23:24.100]  all there. They're doing it all. And now, Klaus Schwab says next is an implantable microchip.
[1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:30.180]  The churches will probably have microchip injections ports at church and have a holy
[1:23:30.180 --> 1:23:35.780]  ceremony over it. I'm not joking. This is the great delusion that we're being put under.
[1:23:35.780 --> 1:23:40.660]  So New York and now Oregon is doing what the UK is doing, what Spain is doing, what Australia
[1:23:40.660 --> 1:23:46.500]  is doing. The illegal vaccine passports and saying, but, but not as we'd like businesses
[1:23:46.500 --> 1:23:52.780]  to do this. No, no, businesses are mandated outside of law to make people verify something
[1:23:52.780 --> 1:23:57.020]  that isn't even a law. It's all color of law, the essence of tyranny, and it needs to be
[1:23:57.020 --> 1:24:01.060]  challenged legally and lawfully. There used to be demonstrations and protests in Oregon,
[1:24:01.060 --> 1:24:07.140]  because this is the most draconian move anywhere in the world, except not even North Korea.
[1:24:07.140 --> 1:24:10.460]  China said no force inoculations in their country and that you won't be penalized in
[1:24:10.460 --> 1:24:14.220]  the social credit score if you don't. But here you will be. And the social credit score
[1:24:14.220 --> 1:24:19.060]  is carried out by the corporations. White House partners with dating apps to promote
[1:24:19.060 --> 1:24:23.700]  COVID vaccines where you say whether you're vaccinated or not. And the people that aren't
[1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:29.300]  are discouraged and maybe kicked off the apps, not allowed to breed if you don't get sterilized.
[1:24:29.300 --> 1:24:33.940]  Oh, see how that works? You won't breed anyways. And this is their big end game. You just heard
[1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:39.580]  Dr. Rima Labo, who was the medical physician for heads of state. Her specialty was life
[1:24:39.580 --> 1:24:46.740]  extension. Her husband was the former head of army secret operations, special operations,
[1:24:46.740 --> 1:24:52.620]  and later over the whole army, telling us all this on the show 12 years ago, they both
[1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:57.660]  stubble by and his wife said the same things on my show. Folks ought to dredge that up.
[1:24:57.660 --> 1:25:01.020]  They ought to find it. They ought to repost it to wherever you want. There's no copyright
[1:25:01.020 --> 1:25:06.780]  or anything we do here. We need you to get the cell. Stanford broke funding laws with
[1:25:06.780 --> 1:25:11.780]  experiments involving aborted babies. Another article in full wars dot com. And it goes
[1:25:11.780 --> 1:25:17.380]  on and on. This is a scientific takeover of the planet. This is premeditated. I'm going
[1:25:17.380 --> 1:25:22.620]  to tell you again. You're in Texas, where our governor finally is being a leader doing
[1:25:22.620 --> 1:25:27.060]  even more than the Sanis saying it's criminal to make some money where I'm asked. We need
[1:25:27.060 --> 1:25:30.540]  that worldwide. We need leadership worldwide because they're going to bring all this stuff
[1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:36.740]  back with real pandemics. Sure. And with 5G, they can make you super, super sick and make
[1:25:36.740 --> 1:25:51.100]  you look like you're nauseous. Seems as though we have lost audio from Alex here. So we're
[1:25:51.100 --> 1:25:57.140]  going to try to get that back up. But imagine, ladies and gentlemen, you're going into a
[1:25:57.140 --> 1:26:03.500]  restaurant and you walk in, you don't have your face mask on, you're a normal human.
[1:26:03.500 --> 1:26:10.260]  And they say papers, please. What? Prove you've been vaccinated. What? All right, Alex is
[1:26:10.260 --> 1:26:15.220]  back now. We lost your audio, but pick up where you left off about 30 seconds ago.
[1:26:15.220 --> 1:26:20.540]  Well, Owen, I'm sorry. My skypoint out for a minute. I'm going to come back to you. I'll
[1:26:20.540 --> 1:26:26.180]  finish up on the other side and we'll talk about what Dr. Rima Levo said, how she knew
[1:26:26.180 --> 1:26:30.660]  it and how incredibly important it is on the other side here on the Alex Jones Show with
[1:26:30.660 --> 1:26:35.220]  Owen Schroyer cohosting. I'm Alex Jones. Don't forget a morning's Harrison Smith, American
[1:26:35.220 --> 1:26:40.300]  Journal, 8am. All these are transmissions for and by the people. Only when the dog gets
[1:26:40.300 --> 1:26:44.020]  out and hunts when you spread the word. This information we just broke is the most bombshell
[1:26:44.020 --> 1:26:49.700]  ever. We'll be right back on the other side, infowars.com, newswars.com, Vandot video tomorrow's
[1:26:49.700 --> 1:26:54.580]  news today. And there's that new URL that gets around the sensors for now. We'll tell
[1:26:54.580 --> 1:26:59.540]  you about when we come back. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can
[1:26:59.540 --> 1:27:05.540]  be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering
[1:27:05.540 --> 1:27:12.900]  from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com.
[1:27:12.900 --> 1:27:17.700]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:27:17.700 --> 1:27:23.460]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[1:27:23.460 --> 1:27:29.460]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent
[1:27:29.460 --> 1:27:36.260]  studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by
[1:27:36.260 --> 1:27:42.420]  increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and
[1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:49.260]  now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[1:27:49.260 --> 1:27:58.260]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[1:27:58.260 --> 1:28:04.420]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes
[1:28:04.420 --> 1:28:09.420]  the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And
[1:28:09.420 --> 1:28:14.380]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[1:28:14.380 --> 1:28:18.900]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[1:30:06.980 --> 1:30:23.980]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live broadcast.
[1:30:23.980 --> 1:30:28.980]  I'm Troyer. It's about to take over at Constitutional Lawyer Robert Barnes. It's going to be coming
[1:30:28.980 --> 1:30:36.300]  on in the third hour today with Owen to lay out on a scale of one to ten, having the government
[1:30:36.300 --> 1:30:41.740]  say to private businesses, you will check that someone is vaccinated, doesn't just violate
[1:30:41.740 --> 1:30:47.500]  HIPAA or common sense, it's mega draconian, it's super dangerous, it's a global medical
[1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:53.060]  passport the UN admits they're setting up, the Klaus Schwab admits will first be a QR
[1:30:53.060 --> 1:30:59.540]  code, then a face scan, then an implantable chip in the hand, and then one in the brain.
[1:30:59.540 --> 1:31:06.500]  This is some homeless person saying it. It's the guy that set all this up with Bill Gates.
[1:31:06.500 --> 1:31:12.780]  And if you go to infowars.com, there is an incredibly important article how Bill Gates
[1:31:12.780 --> 1:31:21.020]  carefully curated tech savior image unraveled. Leonardo DiCaprio is part of this. He needs
[1:31:21.020 --> 1:31:26.500]  to be politically and culturally annihilated legally and lawfully. No violence. All of
[1:31:26.500 --> 1:31:32.500]  the Hollywood scum pushing it. Henry Kissinger, instrumental in all of it. All of these new
[1:31:32.500 --> 1:31:38.500]  old order population must be exposed. The chief amongst them, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab
[1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:43.540]  and others, they are lying monsters that set up the whole scam. You just heard Dr. Rima
[1:31:43.540 --> 1:31:52.220]  Labo who was a physician to royal families. Again, the wife of General Stubblebine who
[1:31:52.220 --> 1:31:59.820]  ran all the secret operations. He came on my show, my show alone and laid out secret
[1:31:59.820 --> 1:32:08.020]  information 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago. And they were told by the royals,
[1:32:08.020 --> 1:32:14.260]  and I'll just say the royals that are on both sides of the English Channel. I was told all
[1:32:14.260 --> 1:32:18.500]  this in confidence, and I've even seen the people's quotes, but let's just, well, you
[1:32:18.500 --> 1:32:23.780]  know what Prince Philip talks about. He's dead now. And this was all planned. So that's
[1:32:23.780 --> 1:32:27.500]  how we specifically knew all of it. Plus, I had a lot of their documents, a lot of their
[1:32:27.500 --> 1:32:33.220]  admissions. That's how huge this is. We just played you four minutes from a report from
[1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:40.420]  2009. And remember what happened? This show aired one time and it was deleted and taken
[1:32:40.420 --> 1:32:47.420]  off Teavos. It aired one time and it was taken off of even the DVRs had it erased. It was
[1:32:47.420 --> 1:32:52.500]  a big national scandal. The police state episode, both the ones that I got them to guess, I
[1:32:52.500 --> 1:32:57.980]  did the research and I am proud of it and I am taking credit by the way. I mean, I basically,
[1:32:57.980 --> 1:33:02.460]  those are real reality shows. Most reality shows are fake, but you still script what
[1:33:02.460 --> 1:33:05.940]  you're going to talk about and we're going to go and what you're going to do. So we'd
[1:33:05.940 --> 1:33:09.500]  go real places and real things would happen. But what we were going to talk about, we'd
[1:33:09.500 --> 1:33:14.300]  already discussed. And so I basically had to vet all the documents. I had to show them
[1:33:14.300 --> 1:33:18.660]  proof or Kissinger said it. I had to prove to them what Labo was saying was true by
[1:33:18.660 --> 1:33:26.100]  statements from other globalists or they weren't going to interview Labo. And so again, that's
[1:33:26.100 --> 1:33:31.900]  why it was so vetted. They had congressional hearings calling for silencing that episode.
[1:33:31.900 --> 1:33:37.180]  Why would you have congressional hearings? Well, Obama saw it and flipped out because
[1:33:37.180 --> 1:33:41.740]  the shows got record ratings for Ventura's program. And then the shows reared hundreds
[1:33:41.740 --> 1:33:48.460]  of times, three seasons over 30 shows. But those two didn't, those two aired once and
[1:33:48.460 --> 1:33:53.740]  were removed because those are the two episodes that you're truly vetted and did the research
[1:33:53.740 --> 1:33:58.020]  for and wrote the research for. And that's why when you watch it, it's so bone-shilling.
[1:33:58.020 --> 1:34:01.540]  So we're going to take segment two and segment three today where I laid all this out, edit
[1:34:01.540 --> 1:34:05.260]  them together. We're going to put them out on Band-Aid video, come up in a few hours.
[1:34:05.260 --> 1:34:12.180]  I hope you get it all out because there is the total proof of insider whistleblowers
[1:34:12.180 --> 1:34:18.220]  exposed plans for great reset depopulation in 2009. I mean, again, this is word for word
[1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:25.340]  what she says, even how they're going to add oils, industrial oils to the vaccines to cause
[1:34:25.340 --> 1:34:32.060]  massive brain damage and infertility because SM102 does that. She just gave it a general
[1:34:32.060 --> 1:34:37.780]  name. Squalene was the previous oil they were using. Okay. I've got the safety data sheet
[1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:43.060]  for you right there. So the good news is Bill Gates and others are being destroyed politically.
[1:34:43.060 --> 1:34:47.380]  I may get destroyed in the process. I'm stepping up to the plate because somebody's going to
[1:34:47.380 --> 1:34:52.780]  take these people down. But I need your prayers. I need your financial support because it costs
[1:34:52.780 --> 1:34:56.780]  a lot of money around this operation to keep us on air and we're fighting democratic funded
[1:34:56.780 --> 1:35:03.180]  lawsuits run by Georgetown University and the Pope publicly has involved. I know there's
[1:35:03.180 --> 1:35:05.700]  a lot of good Catholics out there. I don't think it's Catholics. I'm just saying your
[1:35:05.700 --> 1:35:09.860]  Pope is a devil now. I know you know he's not a Pope. And Georgetown openly through
[1:35:09.860 --> 1:35:13.820]  the Vatican is trying to shut us down. I'm proud of these enemies. They already captured
[1:35:13.820 --> 1:35:21.260]  the Vatican. They're not getting us. And the Democratic Party is financing these lawsuits.
[1:35:21.260 --> 1:35:23.860]  You see all of the news. We've been battling them for years because they admit the plans
[1:35:23.860 --> 1:35:30.260]  have shut us down. And so we need your support. We have the trifecta deal running right now
[1:35:30.260 --> 1:35:39.900]  only until Sunday. 50% off ultimate fish oil. 50% off X2, the highest quality, good halogen,
[1:35:39.900 --> 1:35:44.740]  deep earth crystal iodine, and of course, turbo force. All three of those, despite the
[1:35:44.740 --> 1:35:48.580]  fact they're best sellers, despite the fact they're all going to sell out, watch, they'll
[1:35:48.580 --> 1:35:51.580]  soon just be sold out. I want you to try them and see how amazing they are if you've been
[1:35:51.580 --> 1:35:56.740]  on the fence. 60% off on the trifecta deal. Again, no reviews yet because we just started
[1:35:56.740 --> 1:36:01.180]  doing this deal five days ago. It ends on Sunday. It's a one week deal. But go read the
[1:36:01.180 --> 1:36:07.540]  thousands of reviews for ultimate fish oil, turbo force and X2. Five star reviews, 4.9
[1:36:07.540 --> 1:36:12.220]  stars, thousands and thousands of reviews. I'm not funded by Bill Gates or Warren Buffett
[1:36:12.220 --> 1:36:17.100]  or Ted Turner or Prince Charles, the depopulation as to openly says he wants to call humanity.
[1:36:17.100 --> 1:36:25.220]  His father did as well. I'm funded by you. So infowarstore.com or triple A 253-39. We
[1:36:25.220 --> 1:36:30.980]  bring you information that nobody else will bring you. And so I thank you for your prayers.
[1:36:30.980 --> 1:36:34.900]  I thank you for your word of mouth. And let me enclosing hand the baton over to Owen, normally
[1:36:34.900 --> 1:36:40.180]  host the war room three to six PM for a great job here and Barnes coming up. I'm going to
[1:36:40.180 --> 1:36:43.180]  explain this to all the listeners because I get tons of emails, people on the street
[1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:47.860]  say it to me. It's happened like five times since I've been here in Florida. People walk
[1:36:47.860 --> 1:36:59.060]  Facebook on YouTube to an even in my email. It's all right, Alex. It was only five seconds.
[1:36:59.060 --> 1:37:04.220]  Just start over right now. Okay, sorry. That's not censorship. That's just intermittent internet
[1:37:04.220 --> 1:37:11.700]  going there now. But all the other stuff is censorship. And and so people in Florida,
[1:37:11.700 --> 1:37:15.060]  they come up to me. It happens all over the country, but I'm just mobbed in Florida. This
[1:37:15.060 --> 1:37:18.780]  is the most awake state of the anywhere I've been. I mean, it's just like, I'll be out
[1:37:18.780 --> 1:37:22.220]  on the beach, don't even talking and like everybody walking by. I'm on a towel, like
[1:37:22.220 --> 1:37:25.340]  almost everybody starts talking to me and saying they're listeners and this and that.
[1:37:25.340 --> 1:37:30.180]  But again, that's not bragging. Oh, I'm a big shot. You're not known. Your face isn't
[1:37:30.180 --> 1:37:35.740]  known, which is a positive thing in many ways. You're not known. But other people like myself
[1:37:35.740 --> 1:37:39.060]  or oh, and we're known, we get to see how many people are awake. And they always put
[1:37:39.060 --> 1:37:45.420]  me and they say, they say, Hey, I want to promote band.video. But it's but the URL is
[1:37:45.420 --> 1:37:52.540]  blocked on Twitter, on Facebook, on Gmail. What do we do? And I say, Listen, we've had
[1:37:52.540 --> 1:37:57.060]  six different URLs since they started banning our URLs part of their election meddling eight
[1:37:57.060 --> 1:38:02.160]  months ago. Usually last about a month. The last one ban this dot TV, which you can still
[1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:06.260]  share on your email or text message if you're not Gmail or by word of mouth, ban this dot
[1:38:06.260 --> 1:38:11.420]  TV worked for the last four months. It's now been banned. And again, big tech measure decision.
[1:38:11.420 --> 1:38:17.480]  So platform wide over dozens of platforms, it's been the new one is free world news dot
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:21.200]  TV. They're going to ban that soon to them. They'll say, Hey, did you hear they banned
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:24.980]  free world news? Because they're not for a free world. They're for an enslavement world.
[1:38:24.980 --> 1:38:31.740]  Free world news dot TV, free world news dot TV, free world news dot TV. And that's how
[1:38:31.740 --> 1:38:36.780]  you override. And I know it's a core audience that pays attention and cares. You're the
[1:38:36.780 --> 1:38:40.620]  detonator on the bomb of awakening. That's so peaceful. It's so powerful. When you tell
[1:38:40.620 --> 1:38:43.620]  everybody, Hey, you know, Alex Jones, he's censored. Well, he's at free world news dot
[1:38:43.620 --> 1:38:49.460]  TV. That's the URL you're able to share right now. Okay, so free world news dot TV, share
[1:38:49.460 --> 1:38:53.700]  that with everyone you know, free world news dot TV, we're going to make some graphics
[1:38:53.700 --> 1:38:57.940]  and put them in an active a section of info or something. So you'll share those and send
[1:38:57.940 --> 1:39:02.500]  people a little digital postcard saying, Hey, Alex Jones is censored. Owen Schroder
[1:39:02.500 --> 1:39:07.060]  censored. So the crew is censored. This is the stuff. This is the smoking gun. This is
[1:39:07.060 --> 1:39:11.540]  the proof. So when we post the live video, you just saw that so incredible to band out
[1:39:11.540 --> 1:39:18.180]  video in an hour or so, you'll be able to go and get it over this the censorship wall
[1:39:18.180 --> 1:39:24.580]  of Ted Turner of Prince Philip of Prince Charles of Queen Elizabeth of Bill Gates of all these
[1:39:24.580 --> 1:39:28.580]  evil people like Klaus Schwab. So this is a war. They're literally killing everybody,
[1:39:28.580 --> 1:39:33.860]  but we're going to find them. We're going to be together at free world news dot TV.
[1:39:33.860 --> 1:39:37.260]  Just think of the criminal evil that they're involved in to do something like this. So
[1:39:37.260 --> 1:39:41.180]  free world news dot TV. Oh, and you're looking great. Sounding great. Love the crew. Appreciate
[1:39:41.180 --> 1:39:47.180]  everybody. I'll be back in Austin early tomorrow and I'll be hosting the Sunday show. And if
[1:39:47.180 --> 1:39:51.020]  you want, Owen, I'll do all four hours. Give you a break about we love you and I'll enjoy
[1:39:51.020 --> 1:39:56.860]  your takes over the other side. Robert Barnes coming up. Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted
[1:39:56.860 --> 1:40:03.940]  no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the East Coast gasoline pipeline
[1:40:03.940 --> 1:40:07.940]  that goes from Houston right up through New York City. It supplies more than half of the
[1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:12.740]  gasoline to the East Coast. But who isn't that actually shut down the main pipeline
[1:40:12.740 --> 1:40:17.140]  from Canada through the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into
[1:40:17.140 --> 1:40:22.580]  the gas and simply East Coast. That's right. Joe Biden shut down the keystone pipeline
[1:40:22.580 --> 1:40:28.100]  right after it was completed. Joe Biden did that to America. He has the history. He has
[1:40:28.100 --> 1:40:32.580]  the background. He's the one that promised to get us off of fossil fuels. He's the one
[1:40:32.580 --> 1:40:38.020]  that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country. Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that
[1:40:38.020 --> 1:40:42.140]  the new world order wants to post industrial world and they want the United States, Europe
[1:40:42.140 --> 1:40:47.300]  and Australia crippled so communist China can be dominant. It's not Russia that's the
[1:40:47.300 --> 1:40:52.540]  enemy. It's communist China and their millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[1:40:52.540 --> 1:40:59.100]  That's the facts. That's the information. Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver,
[1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:05.180]  your eyes, everything has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you
[1:41:05.180 --> 1:41:08.780]  have high quality fish oil. We've got the best out there. We have the highest grade

[1:41:53.220 --> 1:42:02.180]  Warning, warning, warning. The globalists have launched a massive counter offensive against
[1:42:02.180 --> 1:42:07.220]  populist forces worldwide. They are censoring. They are attacking. They are arresting patriots
[1:42:07.220 --> 1:42:12.460]  all over the world. Churches in Europe, Australia, the UK and Canada and even California, New
[1:42:12.460 --> 1:42:19.300]  York are being swat teamed and closed because they're non essential. The tyranny is incredible,
[1:42:19.300 --> 1:42:24.060]  but in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida where we have a history of more liberty,
[1:42:24.060 --> 1:42:29.780]  all the lockdowns are over. Ladies and gentlemen, this is martial law. This has all been a massive
[1:42:29.780 --> 1:42:34.580]  martial law drill and now it's more important than ever to spread the word about info wars
[1:42:34.580 --> 1:42:38.180]  and to support info wars. We have three of our best selling products selling out, but

[1:43:59.260 --> 1:44:15.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now the tip of the spear, leading the fight
[1:44:15.260 --> 1:44:28.740]  to take back the nation, it's Owen Troyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:44:28.740 --> 1:44:38.260]  Broadcasting live at freeworldnews.tv. Owen Troyer is sitting in. I've got some other
[1:44:38.260 --> 1:44:48.380]  news I'm going to get to here before Robert Barnes joins us. Joe Biden helping Russia,
[1:44:48.380 --> 1:44:55.540]  giving them clearance to activate that pipeline and also helping China. The story is at zero
[1:44:55.540 --> 1:45:04.100]  hedge dot com. U.S. stimulus has created a boom in China, in China. And then the story
[1:45:04.100 --> 1:45:14.260]  here very heavily sourced, just showing how the economic boom has come to China, while
[1:45:14.260 --> 1:45:23.860]  the U.S. is having a problem. And stimulus and the Fed printing, which is just counterfeit,
[1:45:23.860 --> 1:45:32.340]  is a full solution or maybe what some might call a bubble that will burst. It's not actual
[1:45:32.340 --> 1:45:39.100]  GDP. It's just counterfeit bills that the Fed is printing. So China and Russia both
[1:45:39.100 --> 1:45:46.620]  love Joe Biden. They have the Biden family by the balls because of all the corruption
[1:45:46.620 --> 1:45:51.140]  that the Bidens have engaged in. But they don't mind. They don't mind. No, they don't
[1:45:51.140 --> 1:45:59.620]  mind. Six Republicans have been hit with a $500 fine for going without masks in the House
[1:45:59.620 --> 1:46:06.580]  Chamber. That's a mask policy from Nancy Pelosi. And if they get another one, it will be a
[1:46:06.580 --> 1:46:13.860]  $2,500 fine. And actually, I think Massie may have got that. Ralph Norman is one who's
[1:46:13.860 --> 1:46:22.060]  been fined $500. But I believe it was Massie. I don't have the tweet in front of me, but
[1:46:22.060 --> 1:46:26.460]  Massie said he received a second citation from Pelosi. He filed it the same as the first.
[1:46:26.460 --> 1:46:34.060]  He threw it in the trash. So Pelosi is a mask Nazi, fining members of Congress who want
[1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:40.780]  to wear a mask. This is Democrat Party policy. Police arrest, unmask, attendee at maskless
[1:46:40.780 --> 1:46:45.940]  group shows up at Timberlane School meeting. And so the reason why they really want the
[1:46:45.940 --> 1:46:53.900]  mask to be so enforced is so that they can come in with the vaccine and say that you're
[1:46:53.900 --> 1:46:58.300]  out so that you don't have to wear the mask is you get forced to take the vaccine or you
[1:46:58.300 --> 1:47:02.300]  have to take the vaccine to go back to work or church or whatever it is. So even though
[1:47:02.300 --> 1:47:07.500]  the science on masks is obviously that they don't work and if you're vaccinated, you don't
[1:47:07.500 --> 1:47:11.820]  need to worry about getting infected. Of course, that's a lie, too. The vaccine isn't effective,
[1:47:11.820 --> 1:47:17.420]  but that's what they're selling. That's what they're told to believe. But you still have
[1:47:17.420 --> 1:47:27.820]  to wear a mask. You still have to live under Democrat tyranny. And then a poll in Rasmussen.
[1:47:27.820 --> 1:47:33.660]  Republicans happiest about end of mask mandates. Yeah, go figure. Liberals love their mask.
[1:47:33.660 --> 1:47:38.620]  They love it. They really do. And it's of course Republicans that are getting all the
[1:47:38.620 --> 1:47:45.420]  fines for not wearing the masks in Congress because they don't want to wear the masks
[1:47:45.420 --> 1:47:51.900]  where the Democrats do. They like being good slaves because it's all a virtue signal to trick
[1:47:51.900 --> 1:47:57.740]  you into being a good slave like them. But we don't fall for it. It'll be interesting to
[1:47:57.740 --> 1:48:08.940]  see if Pelosi forces them to pay those fines or not. That will be interesting. We do have,
[1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:13.100]  you know what, let me get into that in the short segment before Bob joins us at 106. Let me just
[1:48:13.100 --> 1:48:18.140]  finish off the rest of this news. Feds accidentally sees computer belonging to Rudy Giuliani's
[1:48:18.140 --> 1:48:24.780]  ex-wife during New York City raid, but didn't have any interest in the Hunter Biden laptop
[1:48:24.780 --> 1:48:31.420]  or hard drives. Left that one behind. They don't want to see what Hunter Biden is up to.
[1:48:32.540 --> 1:48:35.740]  They don't want to investigate the Bidens. And they know if they took that laptop,
[1:48:35.740 --> 1:48:38.540]  then they'd have to have a criminal investigation into the Biden. So they didn't.
[1:48:38.540 --> 1:48:44.540]  More videos are now surfacing of Capitol Police waving protesters inside, moving barricades
[1:48:44.540 --> 1:48:49.260]  aside, and standing by as protesters walk in and even engaging in polite conversations with
[1:48:49.260 --> 1:48:55.900]  them trying to work together at the scene there on January 6. But don't let that get in the way
[1:48:55.900 --> 1:49:02.140]  of a good Democrat mainstream media lie and narrative like the one they're telling now about
[1:49:02.140 --> 1:49:16.700]  January 6. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings gives $3 million to beat Gavin Newsom recall. Still paying
[1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:24.380]  for Netflix? Still paying for Netflix? Your money just went to the legal defense
[1:49:24.380 --> 1:49:35.260]  of Governor Gavin Newsom, the fascistic totalitarian dictator of California,
[1:49:35.260 --> 1:49:43.580]  $3 million from Netflix CEO. Still have a Netflix subscription? CNN's Chris Cuomo
[1:49:43.580 --> 1:49:49.260]  participated in strategy calls to help his brother Andrew Cuomo over cover up sexual
[1:49:49.260 --> 1:49:55.820]  harassment scandal. And the phone calls were really short. Andrew called Chris and said,
[1:49:55.820 --> 1:49:59.900]  Chris, I got all these women coming forward about my harassing them. What should I do?
[1:49:59.900 --> 1:50:03.500]  Chris says, just joined the Democrat party. Cuomo says, I'm already a Democrat. He says,
[1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:09.740]  end of conversation. You're good, bro. You're good, bro. And once again, just the madness
[1:50:09.740 --> 1:50:14.860]  at the Washington Post. I'm telling you, I mean, look, we see all kinds of outrageous stuff,
[1:50:14.860 --> 1:50:19.500]  but this is just Democrats, liberals, leptists, whatever you want to call them,
[1:50:19.500 --> 1:50:24.140]  they don't live in reality. They have their own visions of reality in their head. And this is
[1:50:24.140 --> 1:50:28.140]  why they're lost in a world that doesn't exist. This is why they're mental basket cases. This
[1:50:28.140 --> 1:50:34.700]  is why they belong in straight jackets and rubber rooms. This is why more than a third of Democrat
[1:50:35.420 --> 1:50:39.340]  voters in polls say they've been diagnosed with a mental disorder. They're sick people. They're
[1:50:39.340 --> 1:50:45.580]  really sick. They're lost in a world that doesn't exist. And they write about it in the Washington
[1:50:45.580 --> 1:50:50.460]  Post and they call, here's the headline, Mexicans coronavirus deaths are plummeting. The Biden
[1:50:50.460 --> 1:50:55.740]  wall could be a factor. The Biden wall. Can you imagine? For four years, they bashed Trump,
[1:50:55.740 --> 1:51:01.180]  said his wall was racist. Now it's the Biden wall and it's a good thing. And not only that,
[1:51:01.180 --> 1:51:07.180]  in the story, she gives Biden credit for Operation Warp Speed. I'm not even kidding you.
[1:51:07.180 --> 1:51:13.420]  These people live in a world that doesn't exist. And that's why the media and the Democrats know
[1:51:14.140 --> 1:51:17.180]  that they can get away with anything. And as long as they're in the Democrat party,
[1:51:17.180 --> 1:51:21.740]  the media won't say a thing because they're so filled with hate. They're so blind by hate
[1:51:21.740 --> 1:51:26.140]  for their opposition that they can't even see within themselves. They can't even see within
[1:51:26.140 --> 1:51:30.700]  their own party. They can't even see within their own ideologies. They can't even see reality.
[1:51:31.740 --> 1:51:35.740]  They see a wall at the southern border and they see COVID cases going down to Mexico. They say,
[1:51:35.740 --> 1:51:42.460]  good job, Biden. Way to go. That's how deranged these people are.
[1:51:44.940 --> 1:51:51.260]  Kellogg CEO. We are battling inflation like everybody else. So yeah, you know, food prices
[1:51:51.260 --> 1:51:56.540]  are going up. Kellogg owns a big, you know, food industry with their cereals and snacks and everything.
[1:51:58.060 --> 1:52:01.420]  And so their food prices are going up and they're being questioned. Why are your food prices going
[1:52:01.420 --> 1:52:06.780]  up? Kellogg CEO says, our prices are going up. We're battling inflation just like everybody else.
[1:52:06.780 --> 1:52:13.100]  Yeah, the COVID weapon, the weaponization of the flu by our own government,
[1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:18.220]  by the World Health Organization, by the CDC, by the Democrats has crashed our economy and
[1:52:18.220 --> 1:52:23.580]  caused prices to go up. And now they've printed a bunch of counterfeit money, which will cause inflation.
[1:52:23.580 --> 1:52:31.100]  You know what's so frustrating about this?
[1:52:34.060 --> 1:52:39.260]  Trying to remain calm here. You know what's so frustrating about all this?
[1:52:41.020 --> 1:52:43.100]  And they should admit this, but they'll never admit it.
[1:52:45.260 --> 1:52:50.620]  We should have never, you know this, but we should have never shut down anything.
[1:52:50.620 --> 1:53:00.780]  We should have never shut down anything. And we should be having that conversation right now.
[1:53:02.540 --> 1:53:07.260]  We should be sitting here reflecting on this. If we were a sane functioning civilization,
[1:53:08.700 --> 1:53:12.700]  a higher civilization, as we like to think we are, we would be sitting down and having this
[1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:18.380]  real conversation and debate that we should have never done this. It was all a huge mistake.
[1:53:18.380 --> 1:53:25.900]  But we're not, we're not having that conversation. Even though we can look back on it now, if you're
[1:53:25.900 --> 1:53:32.860]  a fair neutral observer, you can look back on it now and say unequivocally, we should have never
[1:53:32.860 --> 1:53:42.700]  shut anything down. But it's not just frustrating that we can see that in hindsight, and nobody
[1:53:42.700 --> 1:53:51.820]  will have the conversation, it's frustrating that we knew it then. We knew it then. We believed in
[1:53:51.820 --> 1:53:58.140]  freedom then. We knew that this would crash the economy and create medical tyranny then.
[1:53:59.580 --> 1:54:06.220]  We knew it then. And they still did it. They still did it to us.
[1:54:06.220 --> 1:54:14.860]  These criminals, these crooks, these communists, these sellouts, these phonies, these traders.
[1:54:16.860 --> 1:54:24.220]  And now we're sitting here in the aftermath of their fake pandemic with their lab-made virus
[1:54:25.020 --> 1:54:31.340]  given to China to be released by Obama and Fauci. That's been crashing China's economic
[1:54:31.340 --> 1:54:37.900]  adversaries. And we should have never shut down, and we now know it in hindsight, and we still won't
[1:54:37.900 --> 1:54:42.940]  be honest about it. And we're letting them shut us down and mask us up and vaccinate us now.
[1:54:44.940 --> 1:54:49.580]  One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just out and about,
[1:54:49.580 --> 1:54:56.620]  is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines? How do I warn them? Well, the problem
[1:54:56.620 --> 1:55:01.340]  is there's so many problems with it. So many facts. It's the history of contaminated vaccines,
[1:55:01.340 --> 1:55:05.740]  the fact that they have liability protection in the U.S. and Europe, the fact that they've been
[1:55:05.740 --> 1:55:10.540]  caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines, and the whole history
[1:55:10.540 --> 1:55:15.900]  of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans.
[1:55:15.900 --> 1:55:20.940]  The list goes on and on. But what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress, and so did the
[1:55:20.940 --> 1:55:29.820]  head of the CDC, in late May of 2021, that around half of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors,
[1:55:29.820 --> 1:55:33.740]  virologist, scientists have refused to take the vaccine until they can save it? Yeah, I think
[1:55:33.740 --> 1:55:38.060]  what half of the doctors are scared to take it, that's the same thing in the private practices
[1:55:38.060 --> 1:55:41.580]  out there, similar numbers, that that's not something I'm going to be taking. That's very,
[1:55:41.580 --> 1:55:48.060]  very simple. There's your answer. When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done,
[1:55:48.060 --> 1:55:53.260]  I always stop them and I say thank you for what you've done. Thank you for keeping InfoWars on
[1:55:53.260 --> 1:55:58.380]  the air. Thank you for praying for us, and thank you for spreading the word. If all of you will

[1:56:14.780 --> 1:56:19.740]  wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil,
[1:56:19.740 --> 1:56:23.660]  and in the surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can

[1:56:27.660 --> 1:56:31.820]  highest ratings. They're available at infowarstore.com in four different colors,

[1:56:48.540 --> 1:57:02.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:57:02.140 --> 1:57:20.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, the decades old, centuries old, millennia old fighting in the Middle East
[1:57:21.580 --> 1:57:27.900]  has now come to our backyard, unfortunately. It's not what we wanted to see, but it's here now,
[1:57:27.900 --> 1:57:34.220]  and it has the same dichotomy. It has the same elements of the left versus the right,
[1:57:34.860 --> 1:57:39.740]  the anti-Americans versus the Americans, the Trump supporters versus the Trump haters,
[1:57:40.700 --> 1:57:49.340]  and so these political lines are drawn so deep now that everything becomes drawn on the same line.
[1:57:50.300 --> 1:57:54.940]  So now it's Jews versus Palestinians or whatever the heck this is going on in New York City,
[1:57:54.940 --> 1:58:00.220]  and Los Angeles and Chicago and across the nation, and we're just going to be rolling B-roll of all
[1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:03.900]  this. There's a lot of cussing and everything, so we're just going to roll the B-roll as I'm
[1:58:03.900 --> 1:58:09.340]  covering this, but this is all in American cities between Jews and Palestinians, and then of course
[1:58:09.340 --> 1:58:14.780]  you have Jewish people being stalked and beaten all in these cities as well. Attack on Jewish diners
[1:58:14.780 --> 1:58:19.660]  at LA Restaurant by pro-Palestinian group being investigated as a hate crime. Remember how they
[1:58:19.660 --> 1:58:25.740]  called Trump supporters anti-Semitic for years, remember all that, but even in this hyper-politicized
[1:58:25.740 --> 1:58:30.540]  age it's Trump supporters and pro-Israel people on the same side,
[1:58:33.180 --> 1:58:38.300]  and it's always the left being violent, so in this case the left is the pro-Palestinian groups
[1:58:38.300 --> 1:58:41.660]  that are attacking Jewish people all around New York City and California and others
[1:58:42.300 --> 1:58:47.580]  committing hate crimes, so again it's the left committing hate crimes, again it's the intolerant,
[1:58:47.580 --> 1:58:55.500]  violent left every time, it's the left. Now look, I don't even think that that's a real fair analysis
[1:58:55.500 --> 1:58:59.980]  because it's not left versus right, this is a totally separate geopolitical issue, it's been
[1:58:59.980 --> 1:59:08.780]  here long before the American left-right paradigm ever existed, but it's now the same thing, it's
[1:59:08.780 --> 1:59:16.220]  now the same line being drawn and the same sides being chosen, so it's completely not
[1:59:16.220 --> 1:59:20.940]  relevant to the left-right political paradigm, but now it is because it's in our backyards
[1:59:21.500 --> 1:59:25.980]  and it's pretty much the left that's the pro-Palestinians and the right that's pro-Israel,
[1:59:26.540 --> 1:59:33.340]  if you could boil it down to such a lowest common denominator breakdown, so that's what it is,
[1:59:34.300 --> 1:59:37.260]  but it's Jewish people being stalked and having hate crimes committed against them.
[1:59:38.700 --> 1:59:43.020]  Orthodox Jewish men chased by two vehicles in Los Angeles as passengers scream,
[1:59:43.020 --> 1:59:51.340]  alahu akbar. And so again, it's New York City where there's a very large Jewish population
[1:59:51.340 --> 1:59:59.100]  and they get stalked, the left sees people wearing Jewish scarves, they get attacked and
[1:59:59.100 --> 2:00:06.220]  stalked and insulted and shouted out and called terrorists, that's the left. But again, remember
[2:00:06.220 --> 2:00:11.740]  it was the Democrat Party saying Trump supporters were anti-Semitic, they went in front of Congress
[2:00:11.740 --> 2:00:16.860]  during hearings saying Trump supporters are anti-Semitic, ranting and raving about how Trump
[2:00:16.860 --> 2:00:20.780]  supporters are racist and anti-Semitic, but now here is the modern day left,
[2:00:22.700 --> 2:00:33.500]  pro-Hamas, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, attacking Jews in the streets of America, so this is just great.
[2:00:36.380 --> 2:00:41.580]  But again, just like we should have been honest and said we should have never locked
[2:00:41.580 --> 2:00:48.140]  down, we should be honest about this and say no, it's the left that's anti-Semitic.
[2:00:48.140 --> 2:00:56.140]  Imagine a Democrat Party with the likes of Rashida Tlaib, a quote unquote Palestinian-born
[2:00:56.780 --> 2:01:04.780]  member of Congress, imagine having the likes of that wicked devil and Alexandria Cortez
[2:01:04.780 --> 2:01:14.540]  and Ilhan Omar who are all openly anti-Semitic, openly anti-Israel, openly pro-genocide of Jews,
[2:01:14.540 --> 2:01:20.940]  they're openly, that's their open stance, very, very in line with Hitler, but they go in front
[2:01:20.940 --> 2:01:29.020]  of Congress and they go on TV and they say you're Hitler, you're anti-Semitic as they put wind in
[2:01:29.020 --> 2:01:36.460]  the sails of groups of people that want to exterminate the Jews and they don't even have
[2:01:37.180 --> 2:01:41.100]  the own, they don't even have awareness, they don't have the self-awareness, they can't even
[2:01:41.100 --> 2:01:45.660]  see themselves in the mirror because they're like vampires apparently. So they'll point the
[2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:50.780]  finger and say anti-Semite and then cheer on the crowd that wants to exterminate the Jews,
[2:01:50.780 --> 2:02:01.180]  that's the Democrats. Your voice counts when you share information be it over the internet or in
[2:02:01.180 --> 2:02:06.780]  person, it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular, they know you're angry
[2:02:07.340 --> 2:02:11.260]  and now to get around big tech it's more important than ever that we use every

[2:02:50.700 --> 2:03:12.220]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[2:03:12.220 --> 2:03:21.820]  We're going to be joined by Bob Barnes here shortly who, by the way, next week we'll be
[2:03:21.820 --> 2:03:31.820]  debating Nick Fuentes on the clash of Palestinians and Israelis or the Middle Eastern crisis,
[2:03:31.820 --> 2:03:38.140]  whatever you want to call that. But that is next Tuesday the great debate, Barnes and Fuentes,
[2:03:38.140 --> 2:03:45.260]  at greatdebatenews.com. Of course, this is the Alex Jones show streaming live at freeworldnews.tv,
[2:03:45.260 --> 2:03:52.300]  that's freeworldnews.tv. I'm not going to talk about this anymore. We'll maybe get into a little
[2:03:52.300 --> 2:03:59.340]  bit with Bob Barnes, but I kind of did my long breakdown and gave my opinions on a recording
[2:03:59.340 --> 2:04:04.060]  I did for my subscribe star. So if you want to get my long form take on that, it's on my
[2:04:04.060 --> 2:04:08.380]  subscribe star account, but I don't want to do a long form take here on this show. I think there's
[2:04:08.380 --> 2:04:12.620]  more important things for us to get to quite frankly. But we will be having that debate,
[2:04:12.620 --> 2:04:16.380]  and it's always got to be info wars. We should be having political debates every night.
[2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:20.780]  It shouldn't just be info wars trying to find the people that are willing to have the debates.
[2:04:21.580 --> 2:04:24.780]  I mean, Nick Fuentes, you know, all these people love talking trash, and then he says,
[2:04:24.780 --> 2:04:31.820]  hey, let's have a debate, and then they block him like Dave Rubin. AOC agreed to debate Marjorie
[2:04:31.820 --> 2:04:36.140]  Taylor Greene and then canceled. They canceled all the presidential debates because Joe Biden can't
[2:04:36.140 --> 2:04:43.180]  think. But I mean, considering the times we're in and how important and polarized these political
[2:04:43.180 --> 2:04:49.020]  issues are, we should be seeing debates every night, media people, politicians, historians,
[2:04:49.020 --> 2:04:53.580]  lawyers, doctors. I mean, we should be having it every night. This is what America needs,
[2:04:53.580 --> 2:04:59.020]  but we don't get any of that. So we'll try to fill that void too here at info wars,
[2:04:59.020 --> 2:05:02.300]  and we'll be doing that next Tuesday. Of course, that will also be streaming at
[2:05:02.300 --> 2:05:08.620]  freeworldnews.tv as well as great debate. But before we're joined by Bob Barnes to talk about
[2:05:08.620 --> 2:05:15.500]  the COVID vaccine mandates and how illegal those are and the legislation or excuse me,
[2:05:15.500 --> 2:05:19.900]  the litigation, he's going to be involved in to try to stop that. Everything we do here is possible

[2:06:44.140 --> 2:06:48.700]  is with us yet? Okay, Bob is not ready yet. All right, I have a couple other news stories I can
[2:06:48.700 --> 2:06:55.500]  get to here until he joins me. I'll tell you, though, this is the weirdest thing. Where did my
[2:06:55.500 --> 2:07:01.100]  great debate promo sheet go? I have not moved. I literally, folks think it's the craziest thing.
[2:07:01.100 --> 2:07:04.140]  Alex is in here, and we have these stacks of papers, like, I can't find the store, I can't
[2:07:04.140 --> 2:07:07.340]  find my store, people are listening, like, what are you insane? You're sitting at a desk,
[2:07:07.340 --> 2:07:13.580]  you don't even move. How did I lose that piece of paper in 30 seconds? I mean, it is, like, gone,
[2:07:13.580 --> 2:07:22.140]  man. It's the craziest thing sometimes. The desk just eats, just eats papers, I guess,
[2:07:22.140 --> 2:07:25.820]  I don't know where it is. All right, well, that's, that's, that's neither here nor there. Let me get
[2:07:25.820 --> 2:07:31.100]  to some of this other news before Bob Barnes joins us. You know, this is so key, more developments
[2:07:31.100 --> 2:07:36.460]  in the vote audits happening. But this is the real key right here. It shows how it was all
[2:07:36.460 --> 2:07:41.180]  free planned out to steal the Maricopa County presidential election from Trump.
[2:07:42.380 --> 2:07:46.540]  And now we not only know that Soros was paying the sheriff who's stopping
[2:07:46.540 --> 2:07:51.420]  a lot of this from happening, they also had to replace the pro-Trump sheriff. But Bob Barnes
[2:07:51.420 --> 2:07:58.460]  is ready to go now. So here's the story. Robert Barnes joins us. Oregon, California, New York
[2:07:58.460 --> 2:08:02.860]  are having a soft implementation of mandatory vaccines, like, oh, we won't go door to door
[2:08:02.860 --> 2:08:06.220]  and force you to take a needle. But if you want to go to work, if you want to go to church, if you
[2:08:06.220 --> 2:08:09.020]  want to get on the subway, if you want to go to dinner, if you want to go to the grocery store,
[2:08:09.020 --> 2:08:12.620]  so just all your essential activities, you're going to need a vaccine for that. But oh,
[2:08:12.620 --> 2:08:20.700]  they're not mandatory though. Yeah, I mean, I think what we're witnessing is a range of both
[2:08:20.700 --> 2:08:25.660]  employers and educational institutions are trying to impose a mandate on it. And so
[2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:31.900]  Robert Kennedy's group, Children's Health Defense started drafting some objections and legal claims
[2:08:31.900 --> 2:08:38.220]  and examples of what letters might look like. And I did the same thing. So I drafted a letter
[2:08:39.020 --> 2:08:45.020]  that reflects what an employee could object to. And it's not legal advice or anything like that.
[2:08:45.020 --> 2:08:49.420]  It's basically just here's what the objections that could be made that other employees have been
[2:08:49.420 --> 2:08:55.420]  making and that I believe is the legally correct objection to be made. Because the nature of this
[2:08:55.420 --> 2:09:03.740]  COVID-19 vaccine at this point is still an emergency use authorization vaccine. It is not a regular
[2:09:03.740 --> 2:09:11.900]  FDA clinical trial approved vaccine. Consequently, under federal law, that cannot be mandated period.
[2:09:11.900 --> 2:09:17.980]  The precondition of it even being distributed and being authorized is that it's not be mandated
[2:09:17.980 --> 2:09:25.340]  without informed consent. Part one of the objective two is that it really violates the
[2:09:25.900 --> 2:09:31.020]  Americans with Disabilities Act. Because the Americans with Disabilities Act makes clear
[2:09:31.020 --> 2:09:36.300]  that you cannot do certain medical examinations except when business necessity compels it.
[2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:41.820]  You cannot compel people to provide medical information aside from when there's some public
[2:09:41.820 --> 2:09:48.060]  business necessity. And in this context, that has not yet been met. And so they don't have clear and
[2:09:48.060 --> 2:09:53.900]  convincing evidence that being vaccinated is critical and essential to reducing a substantial
[2:09:53.900 --> 2:10:00.060]  risk to others of transmitting COVID-19 in such a way that it can cause severe bodily harm without
[2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:06.380]  the COVID vaccine. And so in almost every instance, one can make reasonable accommodations
[2:10:06.380 --> 2:10:11.740]  to limit whatever that risk they believe is. But right now there's inadequate data and evidence,
[2:10:11.740 --> 2:10:16.540]  either that the vaccine is safe and effective in the sense that it has not yet met FDA clinical
[2:10:16.540 --> 2:10:21.740]  trial test standards. We have reasons to be skeptical and suspect of the vaccine because the
[2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:27.340]  makers of it and the distributors of it are completely immune from liability in case they've
[2:10:27.340 --> 2:10:32.540]  done something wrong or have a bad product. We have other reasons to be suspect of it because
[2:10:32.540 --> 2:10:38.460]  the media and YouTube and social media are basically we're censoring and suppressing the
[2:10:38.460 --> 2:10:43.260]  information. Let me just interject one point too. The companies that are making this vaccine
[2:10:43.260 --> 2:10:49.340]  manufacturing it have paid out the record highest payouts for health fraud violations.
[2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:57.100]  Yeah, I mean, no question. I mean, you have every reason to distrust it. If we're going to trust
[2:10:57.100 --> 2:11:01.500]  the vaccine, first and least, it should meet FDA clinical trial testing. This one's not
[2:11:01.500 --> 2:11:07.260]  nowhere close to it. That's years away. But it should not be an emergency use authorized vaccine
[2:11:07.260 --> 2:11:12.140]  that could ever be mandated against us. And that goes to not only does federal law prohibit that
[2:11:12.140 --> 2:11:17.020]  under the Americans with Disabilities Act and under the emergency use authorization provisions
[2:11:17.020 --> 2:11:21.660]  of the very act that authorized the FDA in the first place, but it violates international law
[2:11:21.660 --> 2:11:26.460]  that has become part of American law because it was created and instigated and pushed on the rest
[2:11:26.460 --> 2:11:32.620]  of the world by the United States, which is the Nuremberg Code of 1947. And the federal courts
[2:11:32.620 --> 2:11:38.860]  have recognized that the Nuremberg Code of 1947 is enforceable in the United States courts.
[2:11:38.860 --> 2:11:44.060]  In fact, this last time this happened was Romney and the Bush administration
[2:11:44.060 --> 2:11:51.820]  tried to force experimental vaccines on people going to Iraq in 2002 and 2003. And the United
[2:11:51.820 --> 2:11:57.020]  States federal district court said no, you can't do that. You have to have informed consent if it's
[2:11:57.900 --> 2:12:04.300]  any kind of experimental vaccine, because this goes back to the Nuremberg Code that said no more
[2:12:04.300 --> 2:12:10.140]  medical experimentation treating human beings as guinea pigs without their informed consent.
[2:12:10.140 --> 2:12:15.900]  And that's why I believe that these various mandates do not conform to the Nuremberg Code,
[2:12:15.900 --> 2:12:20.620]  do not conform to federal law. Employers in universities are violating the provisions
[2:12:20.620 --> 2:12:24.620]  protecting against the discrimination against people based on perceived medical treatment.
[2:12:24.620 --> 2:12:30.300]  And that's what the draft letter reflects. And people can, there's no copyright being asserted,
[2:12:30.300 --> 2:12:34.940]  so people can cut and paste from it however they want. It's again, it's not legal advice,
[2:12:34.940 --> 2:12:39.020]  whatever you want to do with it, you're free to do with it. But no copyright claim,
[2:12:39.020 --> 2:12:43.980]  do with it as you wish. But there is ways to push back and resist. And the goal is to create
[2:12:43.980 --> 2:12:49.420]  something that's easy for people to use to do just that. We'll be right back with Robert Barnes
[2:12:49.420 --> 2:12:51.900]  at freeworldnews.tv.
[2:13:19.580 --> 2:13:23.980]  before delivering gas had been shut down. Plus the Keystone Pipeline's been shut down,
[2:13:23.980 --> 2:13:28.700]  along with other pipelines. The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[2:13:28.700 --> 2:13:32.780]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well. Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:13:32.780 --> 2:13:37.500]  prepare to be a total slave. The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed
[2:13:37.500 --> 2:13:42.380]  until you wake up. And this is a globalist chai-com takeover. Gregory said you have no hope.
[2:13:42.380 --> 2:13:47.420]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[2:13:47.420 --> 2:13:51.340]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your
[2:13:51.340 --> 2:13:57.980]  family. I'm not going to say this five times on the road to the obnoxious. I'm saying it because
[2:13:57.980 --> 2:14:04.620]  it's the key to victory over these criminals. Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted
[2:14:04.620 --> 2:14:11.180]  that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses,
[2:14:11.180 --> 2:14:16.060]  you name it, have taken the so-called COVID-19 frankenshot. I'm going to say it the second time.
[2:14:16.060 --> 2:14:25.420]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the frankenshots. They don't
[2:14:25.420 --> 2:14:30.300]  trust it. You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[2:14:30.300 --> 2:14:36.380]  This is an attack on the American people, the people of the world. This is an absolute red flag
[2:14:36.380 --> 2:14:42.060]  smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more times. Around half of the individuals that work at the
[2:14:42.060 --> 2:14:47.500]  NIH and CDC, the medical staff refused to take the vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses,
[2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:51.900]  scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine and you shouldn't either. You should warn everyone
[2:14:51.900 --> 2:15:18.380]  you know about the truth. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We're back here on the Alex
[2:15:18.380 --> 2:15:29.100]  Jones show. Broadcasting live at freeworldnews.tv. Bob Barnes is with us and we're discussing
[2:15:30.780 --> 2:15:36.860]  how in California, Oregon, New York, and other places soon, I'm sure, are saying you have to
[2:15:36.860 --> 2:15:41.180]  be vaccinated to go back to work or go to church, but we're not forcing you to do it just anywhere
[2:15:41.180 --> 2:15:47.500]  you go to leave your house. You have to have it, but we're not forcing you. And so, Bob, you have
[2:15:47.500 --> 2:15:53.020]  just put up a letter there that's free to use, not legal advice, but just ways people can stand up
[2:15:53.020 --> 2:15:57.180]  for their rights and know the law when it comes to these forced vaccines. But let's talk about
[2:15:57.740 --> 2:16:03.020]  potential litigation here. I mean, there's so many ways that this can go and there's going to be real
[2:16:03.020 --> 2:16:08.380]  world like peer-to-peer interactions that are going to become really awkward, I think, from this.
[2:16:08.380 --> 2:16:14.140]  But we'll get to that later. What happens when they really start rolling this out? What happens when
[2:16:14.140 --> 2:16:21.020]  employers force their employees to take this vaccine illegally? What happens then? What happens
[2:16:21.020 --> 2:16:27.500]  when the litigation starts flying? Well, I think that's where the first step is if somebody's out
[2:16:27.500 --> 2:16:33.740]  there and their college, their school, their state, their county, their employer is saying they have
[2:16:33.740 --> 2:16:38.140]  to take the vaccine and are demanding the disclosure of whether they've taken it. I think the first
[2:16:38.140 --> 2:16:43.580]  step is sending back a letter like this because that will put them on notice and see how they
[2:16:43.580 --> 2:16:49.980]  respond. A lot of employers don't know that the emergency use authorization law does not
[2:16:49.980 --> 2:16:55.660]  authorize them to mandate a vaccine. Most employers do not know that the Nuremberg Code is
[2:16:55.660 --> 2:17:02.220]  invoked because this is an experimental vaccine. Most employers do not know that the Americans
[2:17:02.220 --> 2:17:08.620]  with Disabilities Act prohibits them from asking questions about people's medical information unless
[2:17:08.620 --> 2:17:14.460]  there's business necessity for it. Basically, the legal standard under the ADA for when...
[2:17:14.460 --> 2:17:19.020]  Like, some people are getting confused because they think HIPAA applies. HIPAA applies to what
[2:17:19.020 --> 2:17:26.220]  an employer can do with your medical information, not how it gathers it. It's the ADA that the
[2:17:26.220 --> 2:17:31.980]  Americans with Disabilities Act that precludes your employer from going out and asking questions
[2:17:31.980 --> 2:17:36.460]  about your medical information. And unfortunately, there's a lot of bad lawyers out there, lawyers
[2:17:36.460 --> 2:17:41.660]  that are politically motivated, telling people that, oh, there's no problem with this, when clearly
[2:17:41.660 --> 2:17:46.860]  there's a problem with this. Even the CDC and OSHA and the EEOC, when they issued various
[2:17:46.860 --> 2:17:52.620]  guidances, they've said to be careful in this space. But employers are... A lot of lawyers,
[2:17:52.620 --> 2:17:58.780]  because they love the vaccine, because they're Bill Gates fan club types, Trump hater types,
[2:17:58.780 --> 2:18:05.180]  forced vaccine fans, just like the crowd that supported Eugenics in the 20s and 30s. A lot
[2:18:05.180 --> 2:18:11.020]  of lawyers and doctors in that space are misstating the law. And so the first step for people is to
[2:18:11.020 --> 2:18:16.060]  get educated on the law. The second step is to push back by just asking a letter, putting in
[2:18:16.060 --> 2:18:21.180]  information like this in a letter to your employer, to anyone else. You don't have to hire a lawyer
[2:18:21.180 --> 2:18:26.460]  for it. You can just say, hey, this is my understanding. And make sure the employer...
[2:18:26.460 --> 2:18:31.420]  Probably this would be the first time they've heard of this. The other big thing is employers don't
[2:18:31.420 --> 2:18:35.980]  realize... Not only could they be sued under various tort theories and invasions of privacy
[2:18:35.980 --> 2:18:43.820]  under state law, but on top of this, even the CDC has come out and said, by the way, employers,
[2:18:43.820 --> 2:18:49.980]  if you mandate the vaccine and the person your employee suffers any injury from it,
[2:18:49.980 --> 2:18:55.100]  you are liable. So unlike the drug companies are off the hook because of special immunity,
[2:18:55.100 --> 2:19:00.860]  employers are not off the hook. If they require people to take the vaccine and they suffer any
[2:19:00.860 --> 2:19:04.860]  medical injury, they could be on the hook for life. They could be on the hook for wrongful death
[2:19:04.860 --> 2:19:11.420]  claims. They could be on the hook for lifetime injury claims. So almost no employer realizes
[2:19:11.420 --> 2:19:16.380]  this. No, this is actually so key. And this is the official statement from the government and OSHA
[2:19:16.380 --> 2:19:21.660]  and everything. And to draw back on that, it's kind of like the same dynamic of if somebody went to
[2:19:21.660 --> 2:19:26.700]  get a vaccine and the people distributing the vaccine were going to be held liable for any
[2:19:26.700 --> 2:19:30.300]  damages, then maybe they won't distribute it. But you don't have that same dynamic here,
[2:19:30.300 --> 2:19:36.620]  what you have is the employer. Now, kind of a kind of a reroute, though, this will be another way
[2:19:36.620 --> 2:19:40.620]  to crush small businesses. Small businesses won't be able to handle this litigation. They won't be
[2:19:40.620 --> 2:19:44.780]  able to handle these lawsuits, whereas big businesses maybe can or will somehow be grandfathered
[2:19:44.780 --> 2:19:52.220]  into some exemption clause. So there's like another another slash waiting to happen when this goes
[2:19:52.220 --> 2:19:57.820]  down. Well, that's why every employer out there should not be mandating this. That's a bit all
[2:19:57.820 --> 2:20:03.340]  the risk is on them. They're taking on the risk of ADA lawsuits, risk of violating informed consent
[2:20:03.340 --> 2:20:08.940]  invasion of privacy lawsuits, risk of wrongful termination violation of public policy lawsuits,
[2:20:08.940 --> 2:20:16.060]  and significantly huge tail liability if anybody suffers any adverse consequence from this vaccine.
[2:20:16.060 --> 2:20:20.060]  And remember, a lot of times the adverse consequences from it don't appear until years later.
[2:20:20.060 --> 2:20:25.820]  But that's the nature of this. So if you're an employer, you're crazy to mandate a vaccine as
[2:20:25.820 --> 2:20:30.620]  a condition of employment. So that's where the end. I think that's that's the first step as a once
[2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:37.580]  informed edge employees and employers are informed. I think a lot of employers will step back and not
[2:20:37.580 --> 2:20:43.580]  force this. Now, if they do, then you get to the second stage of potential litigation. And at this
[2:20:43.580 --> 2:20:49.980]  point, they are not immune by mandating vaccines. Many states have passed pro laws prohibiting
[2:20:49.980 --> 2:20:56.220]  the employers or anybody from requiring vaccines as a condition of access to employment, condition
[2:20:56.220 --> 2:21:02.620]  of access to travel, condition of access to entertainment, condition of access to education.
[2:21:02.620 --> 2:21:08.300]  So now the states that are trying to compel it trying to require it, they have made it that's
[2:21:08.300 --> 2:21:14.140]  going to be a major constitutional battle to come. So because these while the Supreme Court has
[2:21:14.140 --> 2:21:21.660]  approved mandatory vaccines on condition of a fine in one case in 1905, the Jacobson decision in a
[2:21:21.660 --> 2:21:27.580]  later children's school vaccine case, they've always allowed exemptions to be present for religion
[2:21:27.580 --> 2:21:32.620]  and other reasons. And they've also required always required a strict evidentiary standard.
[2:21:32.620 --> 2:21:39.580]  That's the it has to be clear and convincing evidence that the vaccine is a safe and effective
[2:21:39.580 --> 2:21:47.260]  and that it prevents a substantial risk of severe health injury to others. It can't just be to protect
[2:21:47.260 --> 2:21:53.900]  the person. It has to be that this vaccine reduces transmission at such a rate that it is going to
[2:21:53.900 --> 2:21:59.420]  be a substantial benefit at reducing severe bodily harm. And they don't have clear and
[2:21:59.420 --> 2:22:03.740]  convincing evidence of that. So that's where that litigation is going to go. That's where we're
[2:22:03.740 --> 2:22:08.540]  going to contest it, try to establish, reestablish the Nuremberg principles in the context of states
[2:22:08.540 --> 2:22:13.020]  or federal governments mandating this, because then that's a constitutional question. Right now,
[2:22:13.020 --> 2:22:17.900]  it's a question under the ADA, a question under the Emergency Use Authorization Act, a question
[2:22:17.900 --> 2:22:23.660]  under evasion of privacy laws, a question under the Nuremberg Code. If a governmental actor requires
[2:22:23.660 --> 2:22:28.460]  it, the Nuremberg Code comes back into play, but also the Constitution of the United States.
[2:22:28.460 --> 2:22:34.300]  And I believe we can show there is not clear and convincing evidence that there that a vaccine
[2:22:34.300 --> 2:22:40.380]  provides a substantial reduction in the risk of severe bodily injury simply by reducing the
[2:22:40.380 --> 2:22:44.220]  risk of transmission. Because let's just look at it. Aside from the big questions about whether
[2:22:44.220 --> 2:22:48.860]  the vaccine is safe and effective, be given it's still an emergency experimental stage,
[2:22:48.860 --> 2:22:53.660]  given that the very nature of this vaccine is experimental and it's mRNA technology for many
[2:22:53.660 --> 2:22:58.700]  of the vaccines. Given the controversy surrounding this vaccine in terms of coronavirus vaccines
[2:22:58.700 --> 2:23:04.060]  having no history of success, there's all of those problems. But to the question of transmission,
[2:23:04.060 --> 2:23:09.900]  the probability, the only thing the COVID vaccine does that simply isolation won't do if you get it,
[2:23:09.900 --> 2:23:14.300]  is to deal with people that are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. So you're talking about a tiny
[2:23:14.300 --> 2:23:20.140]  tiny group of people. The risk of that group of people transmitting the virus is even more tiny.
[2:23:20.140 --> 2:23:26.380]  The risk that that group transmitted and causes severe bodily injury is even more tiny. And in
[2:23:26.380 --> 2:23:30.460]  fact, some early studies have shown, at least in the context of children, that the risk from the
[2:23:30.460 --> 2:23:38.220]  vaccine is greater than the risk from COVID. Yeah, and these are the early indicators.
[2:23:38.220 --> 2:23:46.140]  Let's do one more segment with Bob Barnes here. And by the way, I mean, think about it. Well,
[2:23:46.140 --> 2:23:50.060]  we'll get into the other side with Bob Barnes, the side effects of these vaccines and what it
[2:23:50.060 --> 2:23:55.020]  could mean for employers to force it. I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time
[2:23:55.020 --> 2:24:01.980]  and rattle off the successes and full versus head. If you're paying attention, you know we've done
[2:24:01.980 --> 2:24:10.060]  together. But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying
[2:24:10.060 --> 2:24:15.740]  to destroy all independent forms of media. They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance.
[2:24:15.740 --> 2:24:21.260]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate,
[2:24:21.260 --> 2:24:25.500]  everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true. So it's now that your
[2:24:25.500 --> 2:24:32.140]  credibility is way up. The power structures are to silence those of us that they can. But it's up
[2:24:32.140 --> 2:24:39.740]  to all of us to not let them silence any of us. We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity
[2:24:39.740 --> 2:24:45.580]  and setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that
[2:24:45.580 --> 2:24:51.660]  long dark night doesn't come. So be the polar bears you are.
[2:24:53.260 --> 2:25:02.460]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at surviving
[2:25:02.460 --> 2:25:06.060]  in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil. We've got the best out there.

[2:26:57.340 --> 2:27:01.100]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of
[2:27:01.100 --> 2:27:05.180]  credibility but I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order and it's because
[2:27:05.180 --> 2:27:10.140]  we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and I don't have time
[2:27:10.140 --> 2:27:13.500]  to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what's
[2:27:13.500 --> 2:27:17.740]  going on but let's just say this. We're going to see this through the end. We're going to stay on
[2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:23.420]  air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[2:27:23.420 --> 2:27:27.740]  They're great products plus they fund the operation. So you know, unlike other products
[2:27:27.740 --> 2:27:31.740]  you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are great
[2:27:31.740 --> 2:27:37.580]  products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[2:27:37.580 --> 2:27:41.420]  That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people
[2:27:41.420 --> 2:27:45.900]  like us on the air. So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:27:45.900 --> 2:27:49.900]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going
[2:27:49.900 --> 2:28:02.700]  to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:28:19.900 --> 2:28:25.020]  We're back here on the Alex Jones show and Troy are sitting in. We're live at freeworldnews.tv.
[2:28:25.020 --> 2:28:30.380]  Bob Barnes is with us. If your employer is trying to force you to take a vaccine,
[2:28:31.660 --> 2:28:36.460]  Bob is kind enough to have penned a letter that you can share. He said it's free use. It's not
[2:28:36.460 --> 2:28:42.380]  legal advice. It's just the law as easy as applicable to this situation and you can find
[2:28:43.100 --> 2:28:48.540]  that letter and put your name on it and sign it and you know, maybe you are the employee of the year
[2:28:48.540 --> 2:28:53.660]  like he puts at the bottom of his letter. I was feeling Robert Barnes as the employee of the year
[2:28:53.660 --> 2:28:57.900]  at Viva Barnes Law. I don't know. There may be a fight happening there between the two of them.
[2:28:58.540 --> 2:29:01.340]  But you can take this, copy it. If you want to add something to it,
[2:29:01.340 --> 2:29:05.820]  delete something to it, but it's right there, free use. So Bob Barnes has been so kind of
[2:29:05.820 --> 2:29:09.180]  penned that. A couple of questions I have left for you. First of all, though,
[2:29:10.300 --> 2:29:14.220]  you know, here's something interesting that I'm thinking as you're talking in the last segment
[2:29:14.220 --> 2:29:18.460]  saying it has to be proven, you know, to be to stop harm from being done to others.
[2:29:19.660 --> 2:29:23.260]  They've never really changed. They never really came out and said that they changed their mind
[2:29:23.260 --> 2:29:27.100]  on this or that there was any science. But remember when the vaccine first came out, they said,
[2:29:27.100 --> 2:29:31.340]  you have to keep wearing the mask because you could still spread the virus. You could still
[2:29:31.340 --> 2:29:35.340]  contract it and spread it. Well, they never really changed their mind on that. It just seems like
[2:29:35.340 --> 2:29:39.500]  I guess they're taking the mask off and Fauci says, oh, you know, I just didn't want to confuse
[2:29:39.500 --> 2:29:44.860]  people. Well, if you're listening to Fauci, you're more confused than ever. So I mean, I guess we
[2:29:44.860 --> 2:29:51.340]  wouldn't really know the answer of if it's going to stop a spread or not until the FDA approves of
[2:29:51.340 --> 2:29:57.580]  it or when would we even know that? I mean, they've given different points at different times.
[2:29:57.580 --> 2:30:03.740]  I think the issue is this. One is whether it, the first talk about this vaccine was that it only
[2:30:03.740 --> 2:30:09.100]  protected you, that it was a therapeutic, that it minimized the viral load, not that it reduced
[2:30:09.100 --> 2:30:14.060]  transmission rate. The problem was not that many people were that interested in having an
[2:30:14.060 --> 2:30:19.260]  experimental vaccine running around their body if all it did was act as a partial therapeutic.
[2:30:19.820 --> 2:30:24.860]  And so they've changed their position over time to say now they have minimal evidence. They have
[2:30:24.860 --> 2:30:29.580]  some evidence more than they used to, but still not overwhelming evidence on whether or not this
[2:30:29.580 --> 2:30:35.900]  vaccine actually reduces the transmission. And here's the other component. We all know how
[2:30:35.900 --> 2:30:41.100]  you can avoid transmission. Once you have it, you just self isolate for a couple of weeks.
[2:30:41.100 --> 2:30:46.780]  So the vaccine is not needed to reduce transmission for people who know they have it.
[2:30:46.780 --> 2:30:51.580]  The only reason for the vaccine legally is to reduce transmission of those people who don't
[2:30:51.580 --> 2:30:56.940]  know they have it. These are the people that are pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic. Now the problem
[2:30:56.940 --> 2:31:02.700]  with that is they originally tried to propose a bunch of arguments that there was high risk of
[2:31:02.700 --> 2:31:06.940]  transmission with that category, but as the evidence is accumulated, it's just the opposite.
[2:31:06.940 --> 2:31:11.580]  There is very little evidence that pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic people spread it for the very
[2:31:11.580 --> 2:31:18.300]  simple reason that their viral load is extremely low. So just like the vaccine reduces the viral
[2:31:18.300 --> 2:31:23.020]  load, thus reduces transmission, well, a person who's already pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic
[2:31:23.020 --> 2:31:26.940]  is not going to transmit it at a high risk at all because their viral load is so low.
[2:31:26.940 --> 2:31:32.140]  So what that means is the only people that the vaccine is really reducing transmission from
[2:31:32.140 --> 2:31:37.660]  are people who already don't transmit it at a high rate at all anyway. And that's why the vaccine
[2:31:37.660 --> 2:31:43.340]  cannot meet the traditional constitutional standards for coercion or compelling a vaccine.
[2:31:43.340 --> 2:31:48.060]  The only cases that have ever allowed this are where not only is there overwhelming evidence
[2:31:48.060 --> 2:31:53.260]  the vaccine is very safe and effective, but also that there is serious risk of the disease
[2:31:53.260 --> 2:31:58.620]  with a substantial risk of transmission without the vaccine. That's simply not been proven here
[2:31:58.620 --> 2:32:04.220]  at all in the COVID-19 context. And I think that's why from a constitutional standard,
[2:32:04.220 --> 2:32:09.100]  if the law is applied, state governments and federal governments cannot mandate it.
[2:32:09.100 --> 2:32:13.900]  And I think it's why you're seeing them try to avoid mandating it. That, you know, state
[2:32:13.900 --> 2:32:17.820]  governments are talking about it, but haven't fully done it yet. The federal government is
[2:32:17.820 --> 2:32:23.820]  backing off of doing it all together. Instead, they're trying to trick employers and trick
[2:32:23.820 --> 2:32:29.180]  educational institutions and trick restaurants and bar owners and people that do travel with
[2:32:29.180 --> 2:32:35.260]  airlines, trick them into requiring it so that the governments don't have to. But that, and that
[2:32:35.260 --> 2:32:40.700]  was why we created this letter is that's going to be the first line of the war on vaccine passports
[2:32:40.700 --> 2:32:46.140]  is going to be your employer and your university and your school. The second and maybe the airlines,
[2:32:46.140 --> 2:32:51.180]  the second will be the government. But we're prepared to take on both. But I don't think
[2:32:51.180 --> 2:32:56.300]  that this vaccine can meet constitutional scrutiny, not only because it's nowhere near the standard
[2:32:56.300 --> 2:33:01.100]  for safe and effective, not only that, it doesn't have the standards for that as we noted. I mean,
[2:33:01.100 --> 2:33:05.580]  if the other component with this is if you want to say a vaccine is safe, you need to be able
[2:33:05.580 --> 2:33:10.140]  to have robust debate. You need to have the procedures involved, create confidence in the
[2:33:10.140 --> 2:33:15.820]  outcome, robust debate, no censorship, no suppression, encouragement of dissenting
[2:33:15.820 --> 2:33:21.820]  opinions. And second, you need to have no immunity, no immunity for those making it, no immunity for
[2:33:21.820 --> 2:33:28.940]  those giving it, no immunity for those crafting it, creating it, distributing it. And at a minimum,
[2:33:29.500 --> 2:33:34.940]  and you can't have a situation where the you have any information that raises questions about it
[2:33:34.940 --> 2:33:39.900]  is marginalized. But let me just go back to your first point because this is actually so important
[2:33:39.900 --> 2:33:46.220]  and I was going to bring this up next is that. Well, what would the standard for this be? You
[2:33:46.220 --> 2:33:50.460]  know, the standard would be science and data. And quite frankly, we just don't we just don't
[2:33:50.460 --> 2:33:55.420]  have enough. The FDA has approved it. It's still in trial mode. I mean, which is like a whole
[2:33:55.420 --> 2:34:00.940]  another ballgame to begin with. But the problem is it's not the science or the data, the media is
[2:34:00.940 --> 2:34:05.420]  the standard. The media is what they hold up as a standard. And oh, since the media is panicked,
[2:34:05.420 --> 2:34:09.980]  I have to be panicked. Forget whatever the data or the science is, the media is panicked. And if
[2:34:09.980 --> 2:34:14.060]  we were being honest about this, we would we would be, hey, you know what, we made a mistake,
[2:34:14.060 --> 2:34:17.500]  we shouldn't have closed everything. That was a huge giant mistake. We didn't know enough about
[2:34:17.500 --> 2:34:22.060]  this virus to do it. But okay, we made that mistake, whatever, we won't admit it. But the
[2:34:22.060 --> 2:34:26.700]  media is the standard. So if the media is panicked, then now I have to be forced vaccinated because
[2:34:26.700 --> 2:34:32.300]  the media is panicked. I mean, that's essentially what they're saying. It's very much the methods
[2:34:32.300 --> 2:34:37.740]  that they're using are reasons to distrust the vaccine by itself. Even if you didn't have a problem
[2:34:37.740 --> 2:34:42.620]  with mRNA technology, if you didn't have a problem with using human beings as guinea pigs, even if
[2:34:42.620 --> 2:34:46.380]  you didn't have a problem with the idea that coronaviruses were magically going to be cured,
[2:34:46.380 --> 2:34:51.020]  even though they're constant changing makes it almost impossible for even the flu shot to work
[2:34:51.020 --> 2:34:55.500]  consistently year in year out. Even if you didn't have any of those problems, the methods they've
[2:34:55.500 --> 2:35:00.860]  chosen to say you can't debate this, you can't disagree with this, you can't dissent on this,
[2:35:00.860 --> 2:35:06.220]  you can't challenge it, you can't contest it, you can't question it. And everybody involved is
[2:35:06.220 --> 2:35:11.820]  completely immune just in case they did something wrong. So I mean, there's no, nobody has skin in
[2:35:11.820 --> 2:35:16.300]  the game on their side of the aisle. Except the person who's being forced to consume it. So let me
[2:35:16.300 --> 2:35:21.180]  ask you this though. It's kind of a two part question. Spend the last two minutes however you
[2:35:21.180 --> 2:35:28.220]  want to answer it. Under the emergency youth authorization, I mean, do the negative side
[2:35:28.220 --> 2:35:32.300]  effects from the vaccines, are they different when it's FDA approved versus when it's under the
[2:35:32.300 --> 2:35:39.740]  EUA authorization? But also, what is the difference between, say, a grocery store or a venue
[2:35:39.740 --> 2:35:43.820]  forcing you to take a vaccine versus you're an employer, because you could have the argument of,
[2:35:43.820 --> 2:35:48.060]  well, you could quit your job just like, well, go somewhere else. So what is the difference there?
[2:35:49.260 --> 2:35:53.900]  Sure, almost all public accommodations for the same reason of civil rights laws
[2:35:53.900 --> 2:35:58.940]  are covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. That's why I brought suit against hospitals,
[2:35:58.940 --> 2:36:03.980]  brought suits against stores, brought suits against others that simply had the mask mandate
[2:36:03.980 --> 2:36:08.460]  that failed to accommodate for people who cannot wear the mask, or for whom it's more risk that
[2:36:08.460 --> 2:36:15.500]  they wear the mask. The same logic, the same law applies in the vaccine context. So if any
[2:36:15.500 --> 2:36:21.740]  place says we're not going to allow you to have access to us without proof of your medical status,
[2:36:21.740 --> 2:36:27.100]  then that's violating the ADA unless they make reasonable accommodation for you to be able to
[2:36:27.100 --> 2:36:32.540]  get whatever you need from that store or that location. And now in this context, this often
[2:36:32.540 --> 2:36:39.100]  is a HIPAA violation for public accommodations places to demand you disclose your private
[2:36:39.100 --> 2:36:44.620]  medical information as a condition of access to the place. The ADA prohibits it in the employment
[2:36:44.620 --> 2:36:49.420]  context, HIPAA prohibits it in the public accommodations context. Now, there's people
[2:36:49.420 --> 2:36:54.620]  like airlines and others that you can't sue under the law. So that's how they get away with it.
[2:36:54.620 --> 2:37:00.140]  But in terms of your stores, your restaurants, your bars, your any place of public accommodation,
[2:37:00.140 --> 2:37:05.420]  the way to think about it is if they couldn't discriminate upon basis of race or gender,
[2:37:05.420 --> 2:37:09.740]  then they can't discriminate on the basis of health and they can't discriminate on the basis
[2:37:09.740 --> 2:37:14.620]  of perceived health. Sometimes people don't think of this issue as a health issue, but it is.
[2:37:14.620 --> 2:37:19.180]  It's perceived medical status. You're being perceived as a medical threat. If you're not
[2:37:19.180 --> 2:37:23.020]  vaccinated and they're discriminating against you without the evidentiary basis.
[2:37:23.020 --> 2:37:28.460]  And this is like we need to hold another president here of it's not just innocent till proven guilty.
[2:37:28.460 --> 2:37:32.380]  How about not sick and contagious until proven sick and contagious?
[2:37:33.020 --> 2:37:36.860]  Bob Barnes, thank you so much for joining us. Looking forward to next Tuesday evening,
[2:37:36.860 --> 2:37:40.700]  you'll be debating very spiritedly. I'm sure Nick Fuentes is looking forward to that.
[2:37:41.740 --> 2:37:44.780]  Yeah, they'll be fun. I think he might have been drunk at the time he accepted the debate,
[2:37:44.780 --> 2:37:50.060]  but I think it will be a, it'll be a lot of fun. All right. And we'll all be drunk while we're
[2:37:50.060 --> 2:37:54.540]  watching it. I'm sure we'll be right back folks. Thank you. I'm working on a Thursday night in
[2:37:54.540 --> 2:37:59.580]  mid-April 2021. And I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this
[2:37:59.580 --> 2:38:04.380]  incredible crew that has come together over the years. It is truly an answer to prayer. And I am
[2:38:04.380 --> 2:38:08.380]  so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of the show. I want you to know
[2:38:08.380 --> 2:38:12.860]  that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white,

[2:38:16.460 --> 2:38:21.740]  and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together. And it has just
[2:38:21.740 --> 2:38:26.940]  been an incredible experience to work with you over the years. And as crazy as things are,
[2:38:26.940 --> 2:38:32.140]  I want to keep working under the future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[2:38:32.140 --> 2:38:37.420]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart and supports us.
[2:38:37.420 --> 2:38:41.100]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all
[2:38:41.100 --> 2:38:45.820]  for the years of support you've given us and what you've done. And just ask you again to pray to God
[2:38:45.820 --> 2:38:50.460]  and ask what God's vision is for you. And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support
[2:38:50.460 --> 2:38:55.900]  Him for the rest. God bless. All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone

[2:41:00.300 --> 2:41:05.180]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:41:05.180 --> 2:41:10.300]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:41:10.940 --> 2:41:17.180]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:41:17.180 --> 2:41:21.660]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is in hand.
[2:41:47.180 --> 2:42:16.380]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:42:17.260 --> 2:42:22.700]  I want to show you're here hosting the Alex Jones show broadcasting live at freeworldnews.tv.
[2:42:23.660 --> 2:42:30.140]  It's going to be my final segment hosting today. And I guess this week as well, filling in for Alex,
[2:42:30.140 --> 2:42:35.260]  he'll be back next week. Of course, he'll be back Sunday night with our Sunday night live streams
[2:42:35.980 --> 2:42:40.700]  that go from 4 to 8 p.m. Alex with the first two hours of the Alex Jones show. Then I host Sunday
[2:42:40.700 --> 2:42:50.220]  night live. What I'm going to do here, I am going to be able to cover pretty much all of this news
[2:42:51.180 --> 2:43:01.740]  that I had on my desk. I got to all my video clips. And so when I host the war room,
[2:43:02.380 --> 2:43:08.540]  my normal hosting duties, when I host the war room from 3 to 6 p.m. this evening, I'm going to do
[2:43:08.540 --> 2:43:15.980]  phone calls for the entire three hours. So we'll make up for lost time. We didn't take too many
[2:43:15.980 --> 2:43:22.060]  phone calls this week. I will take phone calls for the entire three hours of the war room today.
[2:43:24.940 --> 2:43:29.260]  And so we'll just do open lines, anything you want to discuss, what we've discussed so far on
[2:43:29.260 --> 2:43:36.060]  the Alex Jones show. It's all key information. And so we'll do that on a Friday on the war room
[2:43:36.060 --> 2:43:42.220]  today. And remember that everything we do here is brought to you by you shopping at infowarstore.com,

[2:43:54.380 --> 2:44:01.580]  the censorship and we've been able to come out of it and kind of in many ways be stronger than ever

[2:44:29.740 --> 2:44:36.780]  family, share freeworldnews.tv, make them ban that URL, make them ban freeworldnews.tv. And
[2:44:36.780 --> 2:44:40.540]  people say, whoa, they banned freeworldnews.tv? Yeah, they don't want to live in a free world.
[2:44:41.820 --> 2:44:49.500]  So let me finish up on the news here today and then Stu Peters is going to take over
[2:44:49.500 --> 2:44:59.660]  and host the rest of the way. So Soros always has his money where it needs to be to screw
[2:44:59.660 --> 2:45:05.340]  us over and rig elections and everything else. Soros kicked in $2 million to elect Maricopa
[2:45:05.340 --> 2:45:11.580]  County Sheriff, now stonewalling a lecture audit. Sheriff Paul Penzone objects to sharing data with
[2:45:11.580 --> 2:45:16.700]  a private uncertified hacking company based on a hunch despite a court order. So he's breaking the
[2:45:16.700 --> 2:45:25.260]  law and he doesn't want this audit to continue because he's Soros funded, Soros rigs elections.
[2:45:25.260 --> 2:45:33.420]  And it's so key when you remember that it was Joe Arpaio who was so beloved and popular,
[2:45:33.420 --> 2:45:42.620]  there's no way he lost that election. But so you fund $2 million, you get Soros funds Penzone,
[2:45:42.620 --> 2:45:46.380]  $2 million, you get his face everywhere, you rig the election and then people don't notice
[2:45:46.380 --> 2:45:51.260]  how it's rigged because you saw his face everywhere. And then you get rid of the great American
[2:45:51.260 --> 2:46:03.020]  Sheriff and Patriot Joe Arpaio. That's how that works. You also have Apple's co-founder Steve
[2:46:03.020 --> 2:46:09.580]  Jobs Widow who's a big mega donor now too, getting a lot of that money and putting it towards leftist
[2:46:09.580 --> 2:46:16.060]  causes, he kicked in another quarter million as well. And now that Sheriff, that crooked Soros
[2:46:16.060 --> 2:46:23.420]  funded Sheriff is trying to stop the Maricopa County election audit. Do you see these people
[2:46:23.420 --> 2:46:28.060]  work in unison? They plan years and ahead. They knew they were going to steal Maricopa County.
[2:46:28.700 --> 2:46:33.660]  They knew they had to get Arpaio out of there to do it and they did it and then they did it.
[2:46:36.940 --> 2:46:43.580]  More though, it's BS. Arizona Democrat Senator Martin Quezada loses it, tells the Gateway Pundit
[2:46:43.580 --> 2:46:52.220]  reporter he wants to get rid of voter ID and then has his bigotry of low expectations and says
[2:46:52.220 --> 2:46:56.540]  minorities can't get a license to go vote. And so, of course, voter ID is racist. One of the
[2:46:56.540 --> 2:47:05.900]  biggest lies, one of the other lies, the countless lies, the list of lies that Democrats and liberals
[2:47:05.900 --> 2:47:17.900]  spout on a hunch, on a hunch, a hunch that Biden got more votes than Obama. Biden got more votes
[2:47:17.900 --> 2:47:23.980]  than Obama with half the counties. Biden won counties where Trump was clearly extremely popular.
[2:47:23.980 --> 2:47:27.500]  Yeah, there's the video of the Gateway Pundit reporter. Thank God for the Gateway Pundit.
[2:47:28.220 --> 2:47:33.420]  Man, are these Democrats crooked or what? And now you have the loving, tolerant left sending
[2:47:33.420 --> 2:47:39.820]  terroristic threats to Arizona Republicans. Suspicious package with unidentified white
[2:47:39.820 --> 2:47:46.700]  powder sent to Arizona GOP Senate leaders office. Karen Fan. So, yes, that's the liberal, loving,
[2:47:46.700 --> 2:47:52.140]  tolerant left threatening Republicans for doing a vote audit. Which, of course, they don't trust
[2:47:52.140 --> 2:47:57.180]  the results of the 2016 election. They thought it was stolen from Russia. Even though they got
[2:47:57.180 --> 2:48:01.260]  their research into that with millions of dollars, that was allowed to go on. They found nothing.
[2:48:01.260 --> 2:48:05.820]  You're not allowed to look into how they stole the Arizona election, which we have a pretty good
[2:48:05.820 --> 2:48:16.860]  idea of how they did that now, don't we? Don't we indeed? So, Molly Tibbetts, believe I'm saying
[2:48:16.860 --> 2:48:24.460]  that right, Molly Tibbetts was murdered by an illegal immigrant from Mexico. And this story
[2:48:24.460 --> 2:48:31.740]  was on the news this morning, and so I was kind of following it. And I'm stunned at what is happening
[2:48:31.740 --> 2:48:40.380]  here. The media is now trying to make, and I'm not kidding you, they are now trying to make the
[2:48:40.380 --> 2:48:46.380]  murderer, who's admitted to the murder, Rivera, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, they're now
[2:48:46.380 --> 2:48:54.140]  trying to make him the victim. And so I saw this, and I saw that the agents that were questioning
[2:48:54.140 --> 2:48:58.620]  him said, oh, he was remorseful, oh, he regrets it, oh, he was under attack. And then the media
[2:48:58.620 --> 2:49:04.060]  is saying he was under attack and saying how he's the victim. And so I'm like, I can't even believe
[2:49:04.060 --> 2:49:08.700]  this. Is this how much the media hates white people and how much they love illegal immigrants?
[2:49:08.700 --> 2:49:12.940]  Or do they just know that this is such a bad look, an illegal immigrant murdering a woman,
[2:49:13.500 --> 2:49:16.540]  that they just want this story to go away? And so I was like, but you know what, it can't be that
[2:49:16.540 --> 2:49:22.060]  bad. Let me go look into this, and let me just find out. So apparently, and this is all in the
[2:49:22.060 --> 2:49:31.340]  testimony. Rivera is stalking this woman who goes jogging in his car, then gets out of the car and
[2:49:31.340 --> 2:49:37.740]  stalks her on foot. She then defends herself because she's like, get away from me, you creep,
[2:49:37.740 --> 2:49:45.820]  you stalker, and slaps him to which he then loses his mind. And as his testimony says,
[2:49:45.820 --> 2:49:52.220]  he blacks out. So he gets so angry, he blacks out. And he claims he has no recollection from when
[2:49:52.220 --> 2:49:58.300]  after she slapped him after he stalked her, he claims he has no recollection, he blacked out
[2:49:58.300 --> 2:50:04.620]  from anger. And his attorneys are arguing this in the media saying, yep, okay. He's saying he
[2:50:04.620 --> 2:50:09.340]  blacked out from anger, and he doesn't know what happened from the minute after she struck him,
[2:50:09.340 --> 2:50:15.500]  trying to get away from him. Obviously, he was a predator to the moment where he's in his car,
[2:50:15.500 --> 2:50:20.140]  and she's dead in the vehicle with him. And he has no idea, he's blacked out, oh, I have no idea,
[2:50:20.140 --> 2:50:25.100]  and I'm so sorry. And the media saying he's the victim, he didn't know, he got attacked by this
[2:50:25.100 --> 2:50:30.220]  woman, and he's remorseful. Unbelievable. I couldn't believe it. I was like, ah, maybe there's something
[2:50:30.220 --> 2:50:37.340]  to this, and I looked into it. No, folks. No. That's the story they're trying to tell us. Moving on.
[2:50:39.100 --> 2:50:44.860]  How many of these Zoom school meetings, courtroom meeting blunders are we going to see?
[2:50:44.860 --> 2:50:50.300]  At this point, I'm almost for it. Virtual school, New York City teacher suspended
[2:50:50.300 --> 2:50:58.780]  after sucking man's nipple on Zoom while students watched. How in the hell are, what?
[2:51:00.460 --> 2:51:06.460]  You've got liberal journalists walking around naked, masturbating on film, people showing up
[2:51:06.460 --> 2:51:12.860]  for their court dates with the name that says Butt Muncher. I'm putting it G-rated, folks. It's,
[2:51:12.860 --> 2:51:17.980]  you know, it's not Butt Muncher, but you can imagine. Now you've got New York City teachers
[2:51:17.980 --> 2:51:24.780]  engaging in nipple play with their, I guess, a gay lover. I mean, my goodness gracious.
[2:51:27.580 --> 2:51:39.340]  Control yourselves. Unidentified man. Control yourselves. Control yourselves. Oh my gosh.
[2:51:39.340 --> 2:51:45.820]  What to get to? Alex covered this. Fertility crisis. Men will no longer produce sperm by 2045,
[2:51:45.820 --> 2:51:53.740]  says top epidemiologist. You've got Black Lives Matter silent on an 80-year-old black man shot
[2:51:53.740 --> 2:52:00.380]  and killed by stray bullet in the Bronx. And you've got the liberal media quiet on the racist
[2:52:00.380 --> 2:52:06.620]  Lori Lightfoot, who says she will not take questions or have any reporters that are white
[2:52:06.620 --> 2:52:13.180]  in her presence, which is odd because she's married to a white woman. Now you may see this and say
[2:52:13.180 --> 2:52:20.700]  that looks like Big Bird, Rachel Maddow, but no, that is a woman. So Lori Lightfoot married to a
[2:52:20.700 --> 2:52:28.380]  white woman, but bans white reporters from her presence. Unbelievable. Or maybe not so much.
[2:52:28.380 --> 2:52:35.420]  That is the Democrats. Racist, hate filled, bigots, morons, mental disorders, mental patients,
[2:52:35.420 --> 2:52:38.620]  you know who they are. That does it for me on the Alex Jones show. I'll be hosting the
[2:52:38.620 --> 2:52:44.860]  war room, taking your phone calls. Steve Peters takes over. One of the most common questions I get
[2:52:44.860 --> 2:52:50.780]  on air, but also off air when I'm just out and about is, Alex, what do I say to my family
[2:52:50.780 --> 2:52:56.700]  about the vaccines? How do I warn them? Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it. So
[2:52:56.700 --> 2:53:00.460]  many facts. It's the history of contaminated vaccines. The fact that they have liability
[2:53:00.460 --> 2:53:05.820]  protection in the US and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer
[2:53:05.820 --> 2:53:11.100]  viruses and other things to vaccines. And the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk
[2:53:11.100 --> 2:53:16.460]  groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans, the list goes on and on. But what about the fact
[2:53:16.460 --> 2:53:24.140]  that Fauci testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that around
[2:53:24.140 --> 2:53:29.660]  half of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, neurologist, scientists have refused to take
[2:53:29.660 --> 2:53:34.540]  the vaccine and they'll take it safe. Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it,
[2:53:34.540 --> 2:53:37.740]  that's the same thing in the private practices out there, somewhere numbers, that that's not
[2:53:37.740 --> 2:53:41.020]  something I'm going to be taking. That's very, very simple. There's your answer.
[2:53:43.100 --> 2:53:47.740]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say,
[2:53:47.740 --> 2:53:52.460]  thank you for what you've done. Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air. Thank you for praying

[2:55:01.820 --> 2:55:09.420]  elsejohnshowbandness.tv. You can find me at stupeters.tv. So much to cover an hour is just not enough
[2:55:09.420 --> 2:55:13.260]  time, but that's all that I am blessed with to be here with you today. We're going to have Dr.
[2:55:13.260 --> 2:55:18.380]  Jane Ruby. Everybody's been talking about this shedding thing that has been going on. She has been
[2:55:18.380 --> 2:55:25.100]  researching this thing to the hilt. And the question is, who can shed? How does it shed?
[2:55:25.100 --> 2:55:30.060]  How does it affect you? Is there a reversal for the injected, the inoculated, all these different
[2:55:30.060 --> 2:55:37.260]  questions? She's making news today. She's going to break news here on InfoWars. She's going to
[2:55:37.260 --> 2:55:42.380]  break news on the Alex Jones show and she is going to bless us with her presence. That's going to be
[2:55:42.380 --> 2:55:47.180]  a lot to get to. She's not available here for about another few minutes. But before that,
[2:55:47.180 --> 2:55:53.500]  I want to talk to you also about rehashing some of the things that I'm wondering why this wasn't
[2:55:53.500 --> 2:56:00.860]  brought up during the world's most prolific trial of Derek Chauvin in the so-called murder of George
[2:56:00.860 --> 2:56:08.620]  Floyd. Now, there were some things that were never discussed and I want to know why. I briefly
[2:56:08.620 --> 2:56:14.220]  talked about this at stupeters.tv during a show the other day, but I really want to get into it.
[2:56:14.220 --> 2:56:20.220]  And so today we're going to be joined by a former prosecutor. Wayne Ferguson will be here. But
[2:56:20.220 --> 2:56:26.220]  whether or not you agree with, you know, the way that the officers handled the situation, whether
[2:56:26.220 --> 2:56:33.020]  or not you agree with the department-approved tactics of Officer Derek Chauvin, former Minneapolis
[2:56:33.020 --> 2:56:39.580]  police officer Chauvin, that's not what I want to discuss here. I'm not here to debate the police
[2:56:39.580 --> 2:56:44.860]  tactics with you and I don't care if you're a cop that agrees with him or disagrees with him. That's
[2:56:44.860 --> 2:56:50.540]  not... We're all people who want justice and I know that due process is such a racist term. It's
[2:56:51.260 --> 2:56:55.260]  expecting for that to happen in the world of instant gratification. In a world where we are
[2:56:55.260 --> 2:57:01.260]  surrounded by people who are running toward a jab, tripping over each other, signing up for this
[2:57:01.260 --> 2:57:07.260]  thing, that by the way, it took a billion dollars in vaccine confidence to get people to go take.
[2:57:07.260 --> 2:57:12.460]  It's beyond me. People are walking around with ineffective, dirty, contaminated diapers on their
[2:57:12.460 --> 2:57:17.820]  face, voluntarily, vowing never to take them off again. That is the world that we live in. So to
[2:57:17.820 --> 2:57:22.860]  try to make sense of some of this to certain people is not going to happen. But we all, I think,
[2:57:22.860 --> 2:57:28.700]  want the same thing, which is justice and a clear picture of truth. And so my question is about a
[2:57:28.700 --> 2:57:35.260]  person who was directly responsible for the outcome, a person who had the opportunity to change it,
[2:57:35.260 --> 2:57:41.660]  that nine-minute video that we're all well too familiar with, those nine minutes on the streets
[2:57:41.660 --> 2:57:49.100]  at 38th and Chicago on the south side of Minneapolis, never had to happen. And I want to know why
[2:57:49.100 --> 2:57:55.340]  we're not talking about it. I'd like to pose the question why Derek Chauvin's criminal defense team
[2:57:55.980 --> 2:58:01.340]  didn't really raise this as a major issue. Now, if you watched the trial in its entirety,
[2:58:01.340 --> 2:58:08.140]  you might remember the testimony of Jenna Scurry. She's the dispatcher. She's employed by the
[2:58:08.140 --> 2:58:14.940]  Minneapolis Emergency Communication Center, MECC. She was responsible for the response of police,
[2:58:14.940 --> 2:58:21.100]  fire, and medics to that scene in front of Cup Foods at 38th and Chicago. She was the principal
[2:58:21.660 --> 2:58:27.260]  dispatcher for the call. She had certain responsibilities that were extremely important
[2:58:27.260 --> 2:58:36.620]  for many reasons, but she violated policy and nobody is talking about it. Why? We're going to go
[2:58:36.620 --> 2:58:40.380]  over this and I'm going to have Wayne Ferguson in here to talk about whether or not this would
[2:58:40.380 --> 2:58:46.780]  have made a difference. But the Minneapolis dispatcher, primary policy who's responsible for
[2:58:46.780 --> 2:58:52.860]  tracking the NPD officers, updating their CAD, their computer screens, and then making sure that the
[2:58:52.860 --> 2:58:59.500]  public is afforded the proper resources that they are needed, the dispatcher's role in the delivery
[2:58:59.500 --> 2:59:04.460]  of those public safety services and the protection of her police, she has certain guidelines,
[2:59:04.460 --> 2:59:10.940]  certain policies that she's trained on in order to provide those services to the public and to
[2:59:10.940 --> 2:59:16.380]  the cops and she didn't. She violated policy and on May 25th, those nine minutes would have never
[2:59:16.380 --> 2:59:21.100]  happened. That video would have never existed because Chauvin and Floyd would have not spent
[2:59:21.100 --> 2:59:28.620]  those nine minutes together. Have she not violated policy? The police dispatcher responsibility
[2:59:28.620 --> 2:59:34.140]  policy is clearly outlined. She's been trained that each decision made by personnel working
[2:59:34.140 --> 2:59:41.580]  in these positions is based on policy and procedure and she violated that. I'm going to expose that
[2:59:41.580 --> 2:59:45.980]  and we're going to talk about it with Wayne Ferguson coming up on the Alex Jones show as we
[2:59:45.980 --> 2:59:50.220]  continue. My name is Stu Peters from stupeders.tv. We'll be back in just a couple of minutes.
[2:59:52.380 --> 2:59:57.660]  Warning, warning, warning. The globalists have launched a massive counter offensive
[2:59:57.660 --> 3:00:02.460]  against populist forces worldwide. They are censoring, they are attacking, they are arresting
[3:00:02.460 --> 3:00:08.140]  patriots all over the world. Churches in Europe, Australia, the UK and Canada and even California,
[3:00:08.140 --> 3:00:14.940]  New York are being swat teamed and closed because they're non-essential. The tyranny is incredible,
[3:00:14.940 --> 3:00:19.660]  but in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida where we have a history of more liberty,
[3:00:19.660 --> 3:00:25.580]  all the lockdowns are over, ladies and gentlemen. This is martial law. This has all been a massive
[3:00:25.580 --> 3:00:30.300]  martial law drill and now it's more important than ever to spread the word about info wars
[3:00:30.300 --> 3:00:34.780]  and to support info wars. We have three of our best selling products selling out but despite that
[3:00:34.780 --> 3:00:41.500]  they're all massively discounted. Turbo force, it's 40% off. We've got ultimate fish oil,
[3:00:41.500 --> 3:00:47.020]  50% off and winter sun for your immune system, it's 50% off as well. Best deal ever, take advantage
[3:00:47.020 --> 3:01:04.380]  of it at info wars store.com and fund the info war. The police dispatcher responsibility policy
[3:01:04.380 --> 3:01:09.660]  is clearly outlined. She was trained on it but Jenna scurry violated that policy which resulted
[3:01:09.660 --> 3:01:14.700]  in that nine minute video, the world's most prolific trial. The death of George Floyd,
[3:01:14.700 --> 3:01:20.060]  although I believe was imminent because of ingesting three times the lethal amount of fentanyl,
[3:01:20.060 --> 3:01:25.500]  could have been prevented if he was provided the attention that was necessary and those
[3:01:25.500 --> 3:01:32.140]  lifesaving efforts could have started many, many, many minutes earlier because Jenna scurry's policy
[3:01:32.140 --> 3:01:38.780]  says that she should have started fire rescue but never did. Now let me just break this down for
[3:01:38.780 --> 3:01:46.380]  you. When about a minute 32 into their contact, officers there requested medics code two. That
[3:01:46.380 --> 3:01:52.140]  means kind of a routine response, no lights and sirens but just seconds later they asked for
[3:01:52.140 --> 3:01:57.660]  Jenna scurry to step up the medic response to code three. Well they originally told her
[3:01:58.220 --> 3:02:05.900]  that Floyd was bleeding from the mouth yet a head injury. Her policy at the MECC clearly states that
[3:02:05.900 --> 3:02:13.580]  a head injury automatically adds fire rescue. Now station 17 for the Minneapolis fire department is
[3:02:13.580 --> 3:02:19.100]  six blocks away from 38th and Chicago out in front of cup foods there. That full body camera
[3:02:19.100 --> 3:02:23.100]  footage by the way is displayed on YouTube and every, I mean there's no place that you can go.
[3:02:23.980 --> 3:02:29.180]  There's no excuse for not seeing that body cam footage but she had all kinds of different
[3:02:29.180 --> 3:02:33.580]  things at her disposal including something that she normally doesn't have which is video. She was
[3:02:33.580 --> 3:02:41.340]  actually watching this thing occur. So when she requested, when they requested officer excuse me
[3:02:41.340 --> 3:02:46.620]  medical for a head injury, she's automatically supposed to add fire rescue. These firefighters
[3:02:46.620 --> 3:02:53.020]  were sitting on their hands. Rescue was six blocks away. That response time for six blocks,
[3:02:53.020 --> 3:02:59.260]  how long does it take you to drive six blocks? I mean less than a minute but instead they waited
[3:02:59.260 --> 3:03:07.100]  for nine minutes. Now when Floyd was pulled out of the vehicle and given over to medics and then
[3:03:07.100 --> 3:03:11.100]  they went to a secondary location, they are the ones that had to call fire rescue but those
[3:03:11.100 --> 3:03:18.700]  life-saving efforts would have started a long time prior to that. Now the primary policy,
[3:03:18.700 --> 3:03:24.300]  it's right here laid out for you, dispatching calls for service, tracking of the MPD officers,
[3:03:24.300 --> 3:03:32.940]  we went over all of that but radio and CAD in that order are the primary responsibilities
[3:03:32.940 --> 3:03:36.380]  of the dispatcher when assigned to the dispatcher position. It says it in bold right there,
[3:03:36.380 --> 3:03:43.820]  the primary responsibility. So why did Jenna Scurry not talk to her cops for more than five
[3:03:44.380 --> 3:03:49.020]  minutes? Didn't ask for a status update, didn't ask if they were good to go, didn't ask if they
[3:03:49.020 --> 3:03:55.420]  needed any additional resources, it's her job. She didn't add fire rescue. Then when they asked
[3:03:55.420 --> 3:04:01.420]  her just seconds later to step up that emergency response to code three, lights and sirens,
[3:04:01.420 --> 3:04:07.500]  that is the cops telling Jenna Scurry, we need medical here, we want them here now.
[3:04:07.500 --> 3:04:13.900]  Whoever can get to the scene first, we want them here. She still did not add fire to the call.
[3:04:13.900 --> 3:04:23.980]  Why? Now I have personal knowledge of police procedure because of my 18-year career working
[3:04:23.980 --> 3:04:29.020]  as a bail enforcement agent. As a fugitive investigator, I worked alongside cops for 18
[3:04:29.020 --> 3:04:33.820]  years specifically in the city of Minneapolis. A head injury, I'm going to quickly tell you
[3:04:33.820 --> 3:04:39.980]  right now, automatic fire rescue is added to a call. She didn't add it for the head injury,
[3:04:39.980 --> 3:04:44.220]  code three response, we want them here right now, she didn't add it then either.
[3:04:46.300 --> 3:04:52.460]  So since making the policy violation discovery, I contacted six senior Minneapolis police officers,
[3:04:52.460 --> 3:04:57.100]  three of which are sergeants and have many years of experience dealing with uncooperative suspects
[3:04:57.100 --> 3:05:02.220]  and situations requiring medical response, all of them. A hundred percent of them said
[3:05:02.220 --> 3:05:07.740]  that it's standard procedure for code three medical requests to dispatch fire to the call.
[3:05:07.740 --> 3:05:11.100]  Ninety percent of the time or eight times out of ten, maybe 80 percent of the time,
[3:05:11.100 --> 3:05:18.860]  the cops canceled fire, but they're still sent, they're still added. Now I reached out to a
[3:05:18.860 --> 3:05:25.820]  senior dispatcher from MECC who works there, where Jenna Scurry works, and she said, quote,
[3:05:25.820 --> 3:05:30.460]  in the case of Floyd, both would be started, meaning EMS and fire, and it would be up to the
[3:05:30.460 --> 3:05:35.420]  cops to cancel fire. So she concurs with what all six cops said. So then I asked another veteran
[3:05:35.420 --> 3:05:40.860]  officer about this who responded to me, of course, those should have been added. From the cops'
[3:05:40.860 --> 3:05:45.260]  perspective and from what they were dealing with, it's easy to focus on all the A-holes yelling,
[3:05:45.260 --> 3:05:50.060]  by then the cops assumed that they had asked for medical code three response and had asked for
[3:05:50.060 --> 3:05:54.460]  medics for a head injury, which should automatically include fire rescue. So she violated policy.
[3:05:54.460 --> 3:05:58.780]  Well, why is this important? Because station 17, again, is just six blocks away,
[3:05:58.780 --> 3:06:05.340]  and those nine minutes would have never happened. As an additional frustration,
[3:06:06.220 --> 3:06:10.860]  she testified that she was watching the milestone cameras and that she felt something was wrong.
[3:06:10.860 --> 3:06:15.260]  She testified to that, but yet she didn't communicate with her officers for another
[3:06:15.260 --> 3:06:22.300]  five minutes and finally did so only to update them, to advise them of EMS location,
[3:06:22.300 --> 3:06:27.660]  which was at the wrong place. Five minutes, if something wasn't right, wouldn't the first
[3:06:27.660 --> 3:06:33.420]  step to take to be to communicate with her cops to find out what was going on, what was needed,
[3:06:33.420 --> 3:06:36.460]  what she could provide them with? I mean, these are just common sense questions,
[3:06:36.460 --> 3:06:41.740]  but what about actual policy? Well, when they were first requested for a head injury,
[3:06:41.740 --> 3:06:47.260]  they should have been added. That's in her policy. When the response was requested to be
[3:06:47.260 --> 3:06:51.820]  emergent stepped up to code three, meaning the first available medical resources to this scene
[3:06:51.820 --> 3:06:57.260]  right now, they still weren't added and she still didn't communicate with her cops for five minutes.
[3:06:57.260 --> 3:07:01.660]  She was, it couldn't be more clear that she was in violation of the clearly written directives
[3:07:01.660 --> 3:07:06.860]  pertaining to the criteria for adding rescue when they're not automatically part of the response.
[3:07:06.860 --> 3:07:11.740]  The very first bulleted point in that policy says that rescue should be added for spinal
[3:07:11.740 --> 3:07:15.980]  neck or head injuries and she didn't do it. He had a head injury. The cops said he was bleeding
[3:07:15.980 --> 3:07:23.500]  from his mouth. That's not a leg injury. That's not an arm injury. He's bleeding from his mouth.
[3:07:23.500 --> 3:07:29.980]  That's a head injury. During her testimony, Scurry explained what code three means. She's very
[3:07:29.980 --> 3:07:35.260]  familiar with the term. She said, quote, emergent. They want them here as soon as possible.
[3:07:38.540 --> 3:07:42.060]  From a common sense, from a policy and from a procedural standpoint,
[3:07:42.060 --> 3:07:46.460]  she was in complete violation. This is the policy that she has been trained on.
[3:07:47.260 --> 3:07:50.620]  Why didn't Chauvin's defense team make a really big deal out of this?
[3:07:50.620 --> 3:07:58.460]  She made comments about how her attention was distracted away from the cameras because she
[3:07:58.460 --> 3:08:02.060]  was going back and forth between her screen, adding remarks, dispatching other calls. Yet
[3:08:02.060 --> 3:08:09.260]  she only dispatched two other incidents during that entire time and still didn't talk to her cops
[3:08:09.900 --> 3:08:13.660]  for five minutes. Now, remember, we just displayed it on the screen here. According to police,
[3:08:13.660 --> 3:08:20.380]  dispatcher responsibility is clearly outlined. Radio and CAD in that order are the primary
[3:08:20.380 --> 3:08:26.380]  responsibility of the dispatcher. So why the radio silence for five minutes? Why no rescue?
[3:08:26.380 --> 3:08:31.980]  Why the policy violation? And more importantly, why is it being shoved under the rug when Scurry's
[3:08:31.980 --> 3:08:37.100]  violation of that policy contributed directly to the death of George Floyd and had she acted
[3:08:37.100 --> 3:08:41.900]  in accordance with policy and added rescue who were only six blocks away, George Floyd would
[3:08:41.900 --> 3:08:46.700]  have been rendered the emergency medical attention that her cops were screaming for on the radio.
[3:08:46.700 --> 3:08:55.340]  Joining us right now is Attorney Wayne Ferguson. He was a prosecutor. He is now the founder and
[3:08:55.340 --> 3:09:03.260]  the big boss over at Ferguson Law PA. Would this have made a difference, Wayne? If these people,
[3:09:03.260 --> 3:09:07.340]  if his defense team would have brought this up, these clear policy violations, could this have
[3:09:07.340 --> 3:09:11.820]  made a difference in the criminal outcome or conviction in this case? Absolutely,
[3:09:11.820 --> 3:09:16.060]  could have made a difference. And I don't think it can be overstated how big of a deal that this
[3:09:16.060 --> 3:09:21.980]  is that you're bringing up. I'm looking at the, granted I'm a Florida attorney, but I am looking
[3:09:21.980 --> 3:09:28.060]  at the Minnesota jury instructions. Right here in the jury instructions, it says for him to be
[3:09:28.060 --> 3:09:33.260]  found guilty to cause death, this is the definitions, the legal definitions that were given to the
[3:09:34.460 --> 3:09:39.980]  jury. And it says the cause of death means that the defendants or actions were the substantial
[3:09:39.980 --> 3:09:45.100]  factor in the causing of George Floyd's death. The defendant is criminally liable for all the
[3:09:45.100 --> 3:09:50.780]  consequences of his actions that occur. And this is the important part in the ordinary, natural,
[3:09:50.780 --> 3:09:54.220]  and course of events. And Stu, I think one of the big things that you're bringing up is there's
[3:09:54.220 --> 3:10:01.100]  something ordinary about the situation, right? I mean, if I'm the defense attorney, I'd be
[3:10:01.900 --> 3:10:08.220]  screaming this because what you say is, this is nothing ordinary and natural about this.
[3:10:08.220 --> 3:10:15.980]  You're saying that the ordinary policy says that you're supposed to dispatch medic and when you're
[3:10:15.980 --> 3:10:21.180]  supposed to do all these things, and it never happened. I mean, this is a general election of
[3:10:21.180 --> 3:10:26.860]  duties. And frankly, I mean, you're talking about a head injury. I mean, is that the ordinary,
[3:10:26.860 --> 3:10:30.220]  natural course of events for them not to call? No, it's absolutely not.
[3:10:32.940 --> 3:10:36.300]  Add fire rescue for any head injury. I reached out to John Elder,
[3:10:36.300 --> 3:10:40.540]  the PIO for the Minneapolis Police Department. He said that they couldn't comment because the
[3:10:40.540 --> 3:10:45.100]  911 is not a function of the police department, but rather an enterprise member of the city of
[3:10:45.100 --> 3:10:48.380]  Minneapolis. More on this when we come back. Stick around. Don't go anywhere. My name is Hugh.
[3:10:49.900 --> 3:10:55.180]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with the
[3:10:55.180 --> 3:10:59.660]  globalist attack of humanity, of all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know
[3:10:59.660 --> 3:11:05.580]  a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure. So I get to see things,
[3:11:05.580 --> 3:11:09.580]  the general public doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members
[3:11:09.580 --> 3:11:16.780]  of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really,
[3:11:16.780 --> 3:11:21.020]  really away from the establishment. They don't want to go along with the globalist,
[3:11:21.020 --> 3:11:26.780]  but they're scared. They're looking for leadership. Well, that's where M4 comes in. You fund us.
[3:11:26.780 --> 3:11:32.140]  You support m4.com. You get great products at the same time. We will then go out and do what the
[3:11:32.140 --> 3:11:37.340]  globalists say is unpopular, but the globalists will target you for to show people that it's
[3:11:37.340 --> 3:11:43.820]  safe to tell the truth and to take the heat. That's our job. So please keep us on air so we can
[3:11:43.820 --> 3:11:49.260]  hit the barbed wire so we can be the shock groups in the information war. Fund us at m4store.com.
[3:11:50.700 --> 3:11:55.260]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious. I'm saying it because it's the key
[3:11:55.260 --> 3:12:02.700]  to victory over these criminals. Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half
[3:12:02.700 --> 3:12:08.700]  of the CDC's top brass and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it,
[3:12:08.700 --> 3:12:14.540]  have taken the so-called COVID-19 frankenshot. I'm going to say it the second time. Around half
[3:12:14.540 --> 3:12:23.020]  of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the frankenshots. They don't trust it.
[3:12:23.020 --> 3:12:27.100]  You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[3:12:27.100 --> 3:12:32.300]  This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world. This is an absolute
[3:12:32.300 --> 3:12:38.060]  red flag smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more times. Around half of the individuals that
[3:12:38.060 --> 3:12:43.740]  work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff refused to take the vaccines. That's right. The doctors,
[3:12:43.740 --> 3:12:48.060]  nurses, and scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine. And you, you shouldn't either. You
[3:12:48.060 --> 3:12:55.740]  should warn everyone you know about the truth. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:13:08.940 --> 3:13:11.260]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm even speaking
[3:13:11.260 --> 3:13:17.340]  to the CDC where you can find me. We're talking about these blatant and clear policy violations
[3:13:17.340 --> 3:13:22.940]  by the emergency dispatcher for the city of Minneapolis during the George Floyd incident
[3:13:22.940 --> 3:13:28.300]  that led to the conviction of officer, former officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of
[3:13:28.300 --> 3:13:33.980]  murder. And we've talked about how the cops were there screaming for medical help on the air
[3:13:33.980 --> 3:13:38.380]  originally for a head injury, asking for a routine response. Floyd was bleeding from the mouth.
[3:13:38.380 --> 3:13:43.500]  Jenna Scurry automatically, by her policy, should have added fire to that call.
[3:13:44.140 --> 3:13:49.900]  Firefighters, rescue rigs, six blocks away. How long does it take you to drive six blocks?
[3:13:49.900 --> 3:13:56.060]  We talked about that. Nine minutes is what it took. There is fire station number 17,
[3:13:56.060 --> 3:14:04.060]  just six blocks away from 38th and Chicago, where officers were asking for medical response. Just
[3:14:04.060 --> 3:14:10.540]  seconds later, they upgraded that response level begging for Jenna Scurry to send them emergent.
[3:14:10.540 --> 3:14:15.660]  Code three, lights and sirens. We want them here now. She still did not add fire. She said she was
[3:14:15.660 --> 3:14:21.740]  watching all of this unfold on cameras right in front of her and testified that normally dispatchers
[3:14:21.740 --> 3:14:27.420]  don't have access to that kind of visual of the scene. So even being provided with additional
[3:14:27.420 --> 3:14:32.940]  information of what was going on there, she still did not upgrade. She still did not add fire in
[3:14:32.940 --> 3:14:40.940]  complete violation and blatant disregard for policy and common sense and didn't talk to her cops on
[3:14:40.940 --> 3:14:46.620]  the radio, which is her primary function, according to the description, according to her policy,
[3:14:46.620 --> 3:14:51.980]  and according to her procedure, her primary function when dealing with this stuff is the radio
[3:14:51.980 --> 3:14:58.220]  and the CAD. What was she doing? She only dispatched two other calls. Now, if it can get more disturbing,
[3:14:58.220 --> 3:15:04.860]  even more disturbing than all of this is that call to her sergeant that she testified she made.
[3:15:04.860 --> 3:15:13.820]  Now, this didn't happen until what was it? 20, 30 hours. That's 8.30 p.m. 12 minutes after they took
[3:15:13.820 --> 3:15:22.060]  George Floyd out of that squad car. Two minutes after EMS requested rescue to start to the scene,
[3:15:22.060 --> 3:15:27.900]  which they should have never had to request because rescues should have arrived on the scene
[3:15:27.900 --> 3:15:35.500]  long before them had Jenna Scurry followed her policy, the policy that she's trained on. Now,
[3:15:35.500 --> 3:15:44.300]  it's believed that she still has a job. She also has not been criminally tried or prosecuted or
[3:15:44.300 --> 3:15:50.860]  charged. But if all of these other officers that were there that were begging her for this medical
[3:15:50.860 --> 3:15:59.660]  response, if they were there and they're all being charged because they're supposedly complicit or
[3:15:59.660 --> 3:16:07.260]  aided or added to the death of George Floyd, well, so did she. And why is nobody asking this
[3:16:07.260 --> 3:16:13.100]  question? If she was so concerned like she testified, why did she wait so long to call her
[3:16:13.100 --> 3:16:17.180]  sergeant? Now, as I said, I reached out before we went to the break to John Elder. He's the public
[3:16:17.180 --> 3:16:22.060]  information officer for the Minneapolis Police Department. I call him for comment. I text him
[3:16:22.060 --> 3:16:26.940]  rather. He told me that 911 is not a function of the Minneapolis Police Department, but rather an
[3:16:26.940 --> 3:16:31.820]  enterprise member of the city of Minneapolis. So I reached out then to the Minneapolis Emergency
[3:16:31.820 --> 3:16:37.420]  Communications Center, MECC, to try to get ahold of Jenna Scurry's supervisor or somebody there
[3:16:37.420 --> 3:16:42.620]  that could comment on this. But as of right now, the only response that they have given me is that
[3:16:42.620 --> 3:16:46.780]  we're not going to comment because there's an ongoing criminal probe into other officers
[3:16:46.780 --> 3:16:50.780]  and there's still an investigation going on in a trial that will occur or multiple trials that
[3:16:50.780 --> 3:16:55.660]  will occur. There's also the federal DOJ civil rights trials and violations that Biden's going
[3:16:55.660 --> 3:17:00.620]  to come after them for. And I have also an inside source. I've never revealed this before. I'll do
[3:17:00.620 --> 3:17:06.220]  it right now here on Info Wars on the Alex Jones show. I have an inside person that works in the
[3:17:06.220 --> 3:17:11.580]  Minnesota Department of Corrections. Now, this person has been with the Department of Corrections
[3:17:11.580 --> 3:17:18.940]  for over two decades. They have been responsible for supervising the custody status of baby rapers,
[3:17:18.940 --> 3:17:24.620]  killers, cop killers, murderers, serial killers. All of these people not once ever has any elected
[3:17:24.620 --> 3:17:31.660]  representative ever requested information about an inmate. And now I'm getting information from
[3:17:31.660 --> 3:17:38.140]  this source, which can't obviously be in writing because of the sensitivity of this information,
[3:17:38.140 --> 3:17:44.220]  but that the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walls, has contacted the commissioner
[3:17:45.340 --> 3:17:50.540]  of corrections, the supervisor that oversees all of the Minnesota prison system,
[3:17:51.260 --> 3:17:55.900]  and requested all of Derek Chauvin's communications while he has been in custody.
[3:17:57.100 --> 3:18:01.500]  Why would the governor, who's a non law enforcement official, be requesting that
[3:18:01.500 --> 3:18:07.660]  information? Now, again, I cannot confirm that because I don't have the physical evidence in
[3:18:07.660 --> 3:18:14.540]  my hand that this has been done, but I have no reason to discredit or otherwise not believe
[3:18:14.540 --> 3:18:20.540]  my source who's worked there for over two decades. This person is very concerned about that happening,
[3:18:20.540 --> 3:18:25.340]  and it's very clear that this political prisoner is trying to be, they're attempting to bury him
[3:18:27.900 --> 3:18:35.100]  beyond belief. Now, 911 dispatchers are often taught that seconds save lives.
[3:18:35.100 --> 3:18:46.060]  In this case, rescue would have made that difference. That nine minute video would have never existed
[3:18:47.340 --> 3:18:54.780]  because those nine minutes would have never occurred if that dispatcher, Jenna Scurry,
[3:18:54.780 --> 3:19:01.980]  had taken her job seriously and followed policy. Those nine minutes would have never occurred,
[3:19:01.980 --> 3:19:07.420]  and George Floyd may still be alive. Joining us here for the last couple of minutes of this
[3:19:07.420 --> 3:19:12.860]  segment is Attorney Wayne Ferguson, Ferguson Law PA. He's in Florida, but he's very familiar
[3:19:12.860 --> 3:19:20.860]  with these Minnesota statutes and this direction to the jury. Wayne, before we went, you said
[3:19:20.860 --> 3:19:25.980]  that this positively could have made a difference in the trial. Why could you speculate, and I know
[3:19:25.980 --> 3:19:30.620]  that you're not here, and I know that you weren't involved, but can you speculate as to what
[3:19:30.620 --> 3:19:38.700]  possible reasons Derek Chauvin's defense team might have had for not really making a serious
[3:19:38.700 --> 3:19:45.820]  issue out of this blatant, clear violation of policy that can be easily substantiated
[3:19:45.820 --> 3:19:53.500]  through radio traffic, body cam footage, all of the audio, the 911 recordings, the bystander video,
[3:19:53.500 --> 3:19:58.700]  the policy that we've laid out here. It clearly shows that Jenna Scurry did not act inside of
[3:19:58.700 --> 3:20:04.220]  that policy with medics and proper medical care sitting just six blocks away. Why would a defense
[3:20:04.220 --> 3:20:09.660]  team just let that breeze by without creating a hellstorm?
[3:20:11.820 --> 3:20:17.420]  Stu, I have no idea. That's a great question. I would be screaming this at the jury, like I said
[3:20:17.420 --> 3:20:23.260]  before, because here's the thing. The jury instructions say the defendant is not criminally
[3:20:23.260 --> 3:20:29.420]  liable if a superseding cause caused the death. A superseding cause is one that intervenes or
[3:20:29.420 --> 3:20:36.380]  one that changes or alters the natural sequence of events. So, to your point, if this never
[3:20:36.380 --> 3:20:40.700]  would have happened, would that have altered the natural course of events? Absolutely. It wouldn't
[3:20:40.700 --> 3:20:47.340]  have happened. So, the jury was told in the jury instructions that if there was a superseding cause,
[3:20:47.340 --> 3:20:56.460]  Mr. Chauvin is not guilty. But yet, this wasn't raised, and it's very strange at best why they
[3:20:56.460 --> 3:21:02.380]  didn't do that. Well, we really appreciate you being here. We appreciate your insight on that.
[3:21:03.340 --> 3:21:09.660]  Wayne Ferguson, Ferguson Law PA out of Florida. We appreciate your expertise. You know, and you
[3:21:09.660 --> 3:21:17.660]  got to try to start thinking about all of the reasons why, and in a world full of mis and
[3:21:17.660 --> 3:21:23.420]  disinformation and all of these conspiracy theories. I interviewed George Papadopoulos
[3:21:23.420 --> 3:21:29.020]  yesterday talking about John Durham and why it's taking so long on the Durham deal.
[3:21:29.020 --> 3:21:34.940]  You start thinking about everything involved with a global effort to like unseat a president,
[3:21:34.940 --> 3:21:39.660]  you know, to hijack an election, to topple an entire political system, and Black Lives Matter
[3:21:39.660 --> 3:21:45.820]  being the fastest growing political party in the world. You got to consider everything to be a
[3:21:45.820 --> 3:21:50.460]  possibility. More of the Alex Jones show coming up next. The scientific dictatorship that I've
[3:21:50.460 --> 3:21:56.460]  been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational. The globalists
[3:21:56.460 --> 3:22:01.500]  are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover. But
[3:22:01.500 --> 3:22:05.500]  the good news is we've been working and you've been working, and others have been working across
[3:22:05.500 --> 3:22:10.540]  the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong.
[3:22:10.540 --> 3:22:15.100]  We're incredible. And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating
[3:22:15.100 --> 3:22:20.460]  it. If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential,
[3:22:20.460 --> 3:22:25.340]  getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time,
[3:22:25.340 --> 3:22:30.060]  supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because

[3:24:52.940 --> 3:24:57.900]  contaminated water, soil and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental
[3:24:57.900 --> 3:25:03.020]  conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants. For the first
[3:25:03.020 --> 3:25:08.140]  time, the bio pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio remediation products
[3:25:08.140 --> 3:25:13.260]  to the everyday consumer. Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro,
[3:25:13.260 --> 3:25:17.980]  a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system. BioSeptic Pro contains
[3:25:17.980 --> 3:25:22.940]  live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like as competitors. This stuff lives in your septic
[3:25:22.940 --> 3:25:28.700]  system. It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective
[3:25:28.700 --> 3:25:33.500]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system. BioSeptic
[3:25:33.500 --> 3:25:39.340]  Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms. Visit thebiopros.com

[3:25:59.740 --> 3:26:26.060]  There it is right there, studenteaters.tv. You've got to get over there. It's also at
[3:26:26.060 --> 3:26:31.500]  info wars website, and you can check it out there as well. We've got to get right into this. There's
[3:26:31.500 --> 3:26:35.180]  a lot of very important information to get to on these companies that are pushing these evil
[3:26:35.180 --> 3:26:41.660]  injections. They skipped over all the animal studies, all these preclinical trials, all this
[3:26:41.660 --> 3:26:48.060]  work prior to gabbing humans. Dr. Jane Ruby has, she brought us the shedding thing. We've been
[3:26:48.060 --> 3:26:55.020]  talking about the shedding. We now have revealed that inside of these injections is a substance
[3:26:55.020 --> 3:27:02.940]  that's not approved for humans or even veterinary use. We've studied the SARS-CoV-2 and spike proteins,
[3:27:02.940 --> 3:27:08.380]  but Dr. Ruby is here now because she has a bombshell. She's making news today on a report
[3:27:08.380 --> 3:27:13.980]  about where these spike particles were showing up, and that is the source of the shedding. Dr. Ruby,
[3:27:13.980 --> 3:27:20.940]  thanks a lot for being here. My pleasure, Stu. I've got this incredible report. It's actually
[3:27:20.940 --> 3:27:29.900]  buttressed by a number of preclinical researchers with regard to the potential mechanism or vehicle,
[3:27:29.900 --> 3:27:35.180]  if you will, for this shedding phenomenon, which Pfizer itself, in its own documentation,
[3:27:35.180 --> 3:27:40.780]  wand about with regard to men who have gotten the jab and then are intimately involved or even
[3:27:41.340 --> 3:27:49.420]  with close proximity to their wives in terms of a fear of miscarriage. The vehicle that this
[3:27:49.420 --> 3:27:54.460]  shedding seems to be happening through, and I've never said that science was going to be pretty,
[3:27:55.260 --> 3:28:03.100]  but it's fecal. It could be fecal transmission. It looks like it is a fecal oral or a fecal hand
[3:28:03.100 --> 3:28:09.020]  to oral. Why do I say this? What they have found is that when this jab and the material in it
[3:28:09.580 --> 3:28:14.780]  forces your body to make the spike proteins, and everybody should be very familiar with what
[3:28:14.780 --> 3:28:21.900]  these things are now, what it does is the process is called a proteolytic process, big fancy name
[3:28:21.900 --> 3:28:27.020]  for when the process of forcing you to make the spikes occurs. These things don't happen in a
[3:28:27.020 --> 3:28:34.780]  vacuum, Stu. The cells send out what's called exosomes. These exosomes can take the spike
[3:28:34.780 --> 3:28:39.100]  proteins, and we know that the spike proteins are going to end up in every cell in your body
[3:28:39.100 --> 3:28:45.260]  very quickly, but these exosomes are the transport mechanism to get the spike protein into every
[3:28:45.260 --> 3:28:51.500]  cell in your body, including a concentration, if you will, in the feces. One researcher found
[3:28:51.500 --> 3:28:58.460]  that fecal RNA from these spike proteins is detected in over 70% of patients with viral
[3:28:58.460 --> 3:29:03.980]  shedding through their GI tract. And as I said, it's not pretty. We've heard about other diseases
[3:29:03.980 --> 3:29:10.220]  that are transmitted through the fecal oral route. It comes from not washing your hands properly after
[3:29:11.100 --> 3:29:17.180]  passing feces, and I have said to people before breaking this, just get different bathrooms
[3:29:17.180 --> 3:29:23.260]  or use different bathrooms because it looks like there is a transmission mechanically, possibly
[3:29:23.260 --> 3:29:29.180]  through the hands. But remember, there have been studies for years now talking about how if you
[3:29:29.180 --> 3:29:34.780]  flush the toilet after passing feces, the fecal material does get on your countertops, your
[3:29:34.780 --> 3:29:39.820]  toothbrushes. Those are not myths, and so we think that we're putting this together, and if we are,
[3:29:39.820 --> 3:29:46.060]  we can at least offer some hope and let people protect themselves. I wanted to share from a
[3:29:46.060 --> 3:29:53.500]  couple of researchers out in Portland, Oregon, if you can imagine this, in a virus vaccine journal,
[3:29:53.500 --> 3:29:59.260]  they actually addressed, directly addressed, the vaccine shedding. And what they basically said is
[3:29:59.260 --> 3:30:04.940]  that through the exosomes, it is very possible and very likely that these spike proteins are
[3:30:04.940 --> 3:30:11.500]  being transmitted. Now, remember what I said from the beginning. We know that the spike protein is
[3:30:11.500 --> 3:30:17.420]  the pathogen. That is what that means is that's what's causing the illness. The spike protein is
[3:30:17.420 --> 3:30:22.300]  what makes you sick, makes you come down with the flu-like symptoms, and they are highly contagious
[3:30:22.300 --> 3:30:28.460]  because remember their function, as they stick out from the cellular or, you know, viral cellular
[3:30:28.460 --> 3:30:35.420]  capsule, is to snag and damage healthy cells that are flying by. So this is just unprecedented,
[3:30:35.420 --> 3:30:39.820]  and I don't see this anywhere in the news. I do think you're going to start to hear more and more
[3:30:39.820 --> 3:30:45.020]  of it, and I'm happy to break it on your show here with Alex Jones and Company, because after
[3:30:45.020 --> 3:30:52.460]  all, Alex has been a major predictor of all of these atrocities. So you're saying, basically,
[3:30:52.460 --> 3:30:59.740]  that if an injected person, if you're living with an injected person, maybe your spouse got
[3:30:59.740 --> 3:31:04.940]  injected prior to this information, being at their disposal, maybe they work for Delta Airlines,
[3:31:04.940 --> 3:31:10.140]  where it's being required that you that you're vaccinated before you're allowed to work, or
[3:31:10.140 --> 3:31:15.260]  one of these other, you know, globalist, manipulated companies that is unconstitutionally
[3:31:15.260 --> 3:31:19.340]  forcing people to become inoculated with an experimental injection that we have proven
[3:31:19.340 --> 3:31:25.580]  to be damaging, VAERS numbers are being deleted, and still through the VAERS data, even after
[3:31:25.580 --> 3:31:32.620]  we exposed individual cases of child deaths, five-month-old babies after breastfeeding,
[3:31:32.620 --> 3:31:37.260]  that is part of the shedding that you're talking about. The five-month-old did not get inoculated.
[3:31:37.260 --> 3:31:43.900]  The five-month-old did not get the vaccine, quote-unquote. His or her mother was who received
[3:31:43.900 --> 3:31:50.700]  the vaccine, and then through breastfeeding, apparently, is how this person, this baby,
[3:31:51.580 --> 3:31:56.220]  experienced, you know, catastrophic organ failure and then ultimately death. We have 15,
[3:31:56.220 --> 3:32:01.180]  16, 17-year-olds that were being reported to VAERS. Since we brought attention to that,
[3:32:01.180 --> 3:32:08.940]  the corruption has gotten into VAERS. Those particular VAERS ID numbers that I shared on
[3:32:08.940 --> 3:32:15.900]  the national platform have been removed. They've been deleted. The VAERS search function altogether,
[3:32:15.900 --> 3:32:22.780]  Dr. Ruby, was disabled for 48 hours after that broadcast, and then Tucker Carlson brought
[3:32:22.780 --> 3:32:28.460]  attention to that, that the VAERS functionality was being hindered or disabled in some way,
[3:32:28.460 --> 3:32:33.420]  shape or form, alluding to a possible collusion or conspiracy to prevent the information from
[3:32:33.420 --> 3:32:40.220]  becoming public. But despite all of the corruption and despite all of the variants and the factors
[3:32:40.220 --> 3:32:46.300]  and the numbers and the reporting, it's really all we have to go on, and that is still suggesting
[3:32:46.300 --> 3:32:53.340]  that there are now over 73,000 vaccine-related injuries or deaths resulting from these
[3:32:53.340 --> 3:32:57.820]  injections that we used to refer to as experimental, but I don't think it's an experiment.
[3:32:57.820 --> 3:33:01.820]  I think they know exactly what they were doing, and there's evidence to suggest, Dr. Ruby, that
[3:33:01.820 --> 3:33:08.060]  they knew about this stuff. Yes, they definitely knew about it, Stu. As I said, and we posted it
[3:33:08.060 --> 3:33:14.220]  on the show before, Pfizer put out a warning in their protocol documents about the transmission.
[3:33:14.220 --> 3:33:18.700]  And remember, we've been talking about transmission for a long time, but we haven't really had a
[3:33:18.700 --> 3:33:24.540]  handle or much of a handle on the mode of transmission. These folks also, these researchers
[3:33:24.540 --> 3:33:30.540]  also said that there were high concentrations in sputum, mucus, epithelial lining. Epithelial
[3:33:30.540 --> 3:33:37.900]  lining lines your organs, and bronchial lavage. That's a different story. But the point of this
[3:33:37.900 --> 3:33:45.340]  is that over 70% of these spike proteins are found in fecal material. There is a definite
[3:33:45.340 --> 3:33:50.860]  mechanical, what I mean by that is it's not biochemical, it's physical, from inside the
[3:33:50.860 --> 3:33:57.260]  body to outside the body of transmission. And this is incredibly dangerous, but I also think
[3:33:57.260 --> 3:34:02.700]  it suggests that there is a way to protect ourselves from the unvaccinated. I'm getting
[3:34:02.700 --> 3:34:07.900]  a ton of mail since being on your show and Alex's show from people saying, look, I've got a relative,
[3:34:07.900 --> 3:34:13.500]  a family member of parents, a significant other who's vaccinated, or as I like to say,
[3:34:13.500 --> 3:34:19.100]  experimentally injected. And how much risk am I at? And I think you're at somewhat a high risk,
[3:34:19.100 --> 3:34:24.060]  but now we know where it might be coming from. So we could do some practical things like a little
[3:34:24.060 --> 3:34:29.580]  more hand washing and using different bathrooms. We don't know how long this effect lasts. And
[3:34:29.580 --> 3:34:35.260]  the part that makes me really angry and concerns to is that they've known about it all along.
[3:34:35.260 --> 3:34:41.260]  And the mechanism for these jabs is to force your body, I want to keep emphasizing this,
[3:34:41.260 --> 3:34:48.700]  to force your body to do what? To replicate in the billions these spike proteins that we
[3:34:48.700 --> 3:34:55.420]  now know are the pathogens. They're the disease causers of COVID-19. And they're causing much
[3:34:55.420 --> 3:35:01.500]  more than that. They're really competing with the ACE2 receptor, which is the ACE2, the ACE2
[3:35:01.500 --> 3:35:07.100]  is protecting your body. And what's happening is by these spike proteins kind of nudging out
[3:35:07.100 --> 3:35:14.860]  the ACE2 enzyme and jumping on that receptor, the spikes are causing all kinds of physical damage,
[3:35:14.860 --> 3:35:18.860]  like the bleeding, the blood clots, the miscarriages, the damage to placenta.
[3:35:19.740 --> 3:35:24.140]  Very scary stuff. Glad that there is some positive takeaway that there's
[3:35:24.140 --> 3:35:30.700]  a way to try to cut down on some of this spread. Maybe not engage in gay sex would be number one
[3:35:30.700 --> 3:35:37.180]  of them anal sex, obviously, and then also to maybe use a different bathroom. There's also
[3:35:37.180 --> 3:35:44.300]  a meeting that nobody's talking about that the CDC had way back in December of 2020. And we're
[3:35:44.300 --> 3:35:48.300]  going to talk about that after the break. This is the Alex Jones show. My name is Stu Peter. Stick
[3:35:48.300 --> 3:35:58.220]  around. As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[3:35:59.500 --> 3:36:07.500]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date. Super male vitality specifically

[3:36:36.860 --> 3:36:42.540]  out of this herb packed formula. So what are you waiting for? Go to the infor store. Never been
[3:36:42.540 --> 3:36:50.780]  a better time than right now. Super male vitality at inforstore.com. Gerald and South Carolina,
[3:36:50.780 --> 3:36:55.100]  go ahead, you're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey Alex, welcome. Would like to say first off,
[3:36:55.100 --> 3:36:59.900]  thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've
[3:36:59.900 --> 3:37:05.980]  been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay, I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria
[3:37:05.980 --> 3:37:11.660]  infection on my lung that'll never go away. Living defense saved my life. They had me on
[3:37:11.660 --> 3:37:17.260]  antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back. I wanted to
[3:37:17.260 --> 3:37:23.340]  just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24,
[3:37:23.340 --> 3:37:30.300]  verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be
[3:37:30.300 --> 3:37:37.260]  hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[3:37:37.260 --> 3:37:42.540]  and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at brother. And that's because God's name is
[3:37:42.540 --> 3:37:46.700]  on the founding of this country, no matter what they say. And that's why the enemy hates it because
[3:37:46.700 --> 3:37:54.700]  God created this country. Listen up, Patriots. I'm running a sale that's the biggest I've ever run
[3:37:54.700 --> 3:37:59.580]  on three products that are already selling out. Well then why am I selling it then at 50% off
[3:37:59.580 --> 3:38:03.820]  or 60% off depending on which sale you go with? Because I know a lot of you are on the fence,
[3:38:03.820 --> 3:38:08.300]  you haven't tried it, and I know you're going to get hooked once you do. So for one week only,
[3:38:08.300 --> 3:38:15.260]  we're running 50% off on ultimate fish oil, 50% off on winter sun with D3 and K-3 immune system,
[3:38:15.260 --> 3:38:19.740]  and oh my gosh, people love this so much. It's sold out for months back in limited supply.
[3:38:19.740 --> 3:38:26.700]  Turbo force 10 hour clean energy is 40% off, but you can get them all three together in the optimum
[3:38:26.700 --> 3:38:33.020]  trifecta pack for 60% off. We've never offered that on these products. It's basically a lost
[3:38:33.020 --> 3:38:36.700]  leader. I want you to get them. I want you to try them. I want you to love them. So believe me,
[3:38:36.700 --> 3:38:42.380]  you're going to be a blown away. Go to infowarstore.com. We're running this Monday through Sunday and
[3:38:42.380 --> 3:38:49.100]  the deal is over. Best deal ever. Take advantage of it at infowarstore.com and fund the info war.
[3:38:50.540 --> 3:38:55.420]  14 months ago, I began to sell the broadcast every day when the first world collapses,
[3:38:55.420 --> 3:39:00.380]  the third world dies. We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving
[3:39:00.380 --> 3:39:06.540]  parts that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the
[3:39:06.540 --> 3:39:11.020]  third world and really hurt the first world. Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages
[3:39:11.020 --> 3:39:15.260]  all over the United States. That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers
[3:39:15.260 --> 3:39:19.500]  that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down. Plus,
[3:39:19.500 --> 3:39:24.620]  the Keystone pipeline's been shut down along with other pipelines. The left is now blowing up dams
[3:39:24.620 --> 3:39:29.100]  across the U.S. We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[3:39:29.100 --> 3:39:33.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave. The third world is exploding as well. The borders
[3:39:33.900 --> 3:39:38.220]  have been removed until you wake up. And this is a globalist Chicom takeover. Gregory said,
[3:39:38.220 --> 3:39:43.580]  you have no hope. They're announcing that there will be less than two thirds of the gas needed
[3:39:43.580 --> 3:39:48.140]  this summer. So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at
[3:39:48.140 --> 3:39:56.060]  you and your family. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:40:18.860 --> 3:40:25.820]  FreeWorldNews.tv. That is, of course, the news sites. The banning just continues. The globalists
[3:40:25.820 --> 3:40:32.780]  in their panic, in all of the panic to try to keep the people from exposing the truth about
[3:40:32.780 --> 3:40:36.620]  everything that's going on as these globalists continue to tighten the news, controlling world
[3:40:36.620 --> 3:40:42.300]  economies, changing healthcare. Now the buzzwords are social security and cryptocurrency. Why?
[3:40:43.340 --> 3:40:47.740]  I've got something on that over at stupeters.tv. I hope you'll join us there. We have Dr. Jane
[3:40:47.740 --> 3:40:52.540]  Ruby here. Very important stuff. She's making news today, folks, breaking information on how this
[3:40:52.540 --> 3:41:00.220]  shedding occurs, which is really bad news for homosexuals specifically. But also if you share
[3:41:00.220 --> 3:41:05.420]  a bathroom with somebody who's been injected or inoculated, try to avoid doing that if you can,
[3:41:05.420 --> 3:41:12.860]  because right now Dr. Ruby is suggesting that feces or fecal matter is the primary way that this
[3:41:12.860 --> 3:41:17.260]  shedding is occurring, which could make you very sick, ultimately even lead to your death bleeding
[3:41:17.260 --> 3:41:21.100]  from your eyes and ears. I mean, this stuff is actually occurring, folks. This isn't hyperbole
[3:41:21.100 --> 3:41:26.380]  for shock value programming here on infowars. But the second issue that I want to address with Dr.
[3:41:26.380 --> 3:41:34.300]  Ruby is this, nobody's talking about the CDC's big meeting called the update on December 20th
[3:41:34.860 --> 3:41:39.580]  before this whole JAB program ramped up. And it seems that the committee had a whole lot of
[3:41:39.580 --> 3:41:47.900]  recommendations, Dr. Ruby, to protect people that everyone is ignoring in this big JAB push. What did
[3:41:47.900 --> 3:41:55.100]  you discover about this meeting? Well, you know, Stu, all we heard from the beginning from experts,
[3:41:55.100 --> 3:42:01.740]  the CDC, Fauci, all these people is that the vaccines are safe, the injections are safe,
[3:42:01.740 --> 3:42:07.580]  babies, unborn babies, pregnant women, all of a sudden now we have this report coming out from
[3:42:07.580 --> 3:42:14.140]  a December 2020 meeting. And what I've learned is that that committee had a whole lot of recommendations
[3:42:14.140 --> 3:42:21.660]  to their audience. And let me share something with you. They talked about the fact that the vaccine
[3:42:21.660 --> 3:42:27.420]  should be deferred for anyone with an allergic reaction. And let me say, they defined allergic
[3:42:27.420 --> 3:42:32.700]  reaction. First of all, the most severe form of an allergic reaction is an anaphylactic reaction,
[3:42:32.700 --> 3:42:40.220]  which is a full body, you know, can't breathe, swelling, airway shuts down. It's a momentary
[3:42:40.220 --> 3:42:45.020]  crisis and you need immediate emergency medical help. But beyond that, and there have been a
[3:42:45.020 --> 3:42:51.660]  lot of those, but beyond that, they define, and appropriately so I might add, that the definition
[3:42:51.660 --> 3:42:58.780]  of an immediate allergic reaction also includes signs or symptoms such as urticaria, which is itching,
[3:42:58.780 --> 3:43:05.260]  angioedema, which is any swelling anywhere in your ears, your nose, your throat, respiratory
[3:43:05.260 --> 3:43:11.180]  distress. How many times have we seen in the VAERS database, wheezing, strider, which is sort of an
[3:43:11.180 --> 3:43:17.500]  audible attempt to breathe, like a wheezing type thing that occurs within four hours of
[3:43:17.500 --> 3:43:23.980]  administration. So they're talking about, first of all, defining that and giving the audience
[3:43:23.980 --> 3:43:29.740]  of doctors guidance. And guess what the guidance was, Stu? And I'll read it directly from their
[3:43:29.740 --> 3:43:35.420]  report. And this is in the public domain as well. Here's my favorite bullet point. Persons with an
[3:43:35.420 --> 3:43:42.780]  immediate allergic reaction to the first dose of mRNA vaccine should not receive additional
[3:43:42.780 --> 3:43:49.820]  doses of either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Let me repeat a part of that sentence. Anyone
[3:43:49.820 --> 3:43:57.020]  who gets a reaction to the injection should not get an additional dose. That in other words,
[3:43:57.020 --> 3:44:02.700]  that those both of those companies with mRNA require a second dose. Stu, this is outrageous.
[3:44:02.700 --> 3:44:07.980]  And this is not even touching on the other issue that we're now looking at. Excipients,
[3:44:07.980 --> 3:44:14.700]  you're showing now, you know, actually the breakdown of symptoms and really in the first column,
[3:44:14.700 --> 3:44:22.620]  they're telling doctors to either defer the first shot or and or don't give them the second shot.
[3:44:22.620 --> 3:44:26.860]  We don't hear that right now. We're hearing that they're setting up clinics in schools
[3:44:26.860 --> 3:44:33.020]  and they're enlisting the help of pediatricians. I'm sure financially by incentivizing them
[3:44:33.020 --> 3:44:39.260]  to jab now babies, you know, months old as well as small children. This has got to stop.
[3:44:39.260 --> 3:44:42.140]  They're not even following their own guidelines to doctors.
[3:44:42.140 --> 3:44:50.140]  Well, that's not surprising. You know, yesterday it broke that this SM 102 it's been it's been kind
[3:44:50.140 --> 3:44:57.580]  of talked about, but this is that lipid nanoparticle that is it's not even approved for human or
[3:44:57.580 --> 3:45:05.100]  veterinary use. It's got this Luciferase name, which may be actually a religious exemption
[3:45:05.100 --> 3:45:08.460]  for people. You're not going to put anything in your body with the name Lucifer in it.
[3:45:08.460 --> 3:45:14.940]  So maybe you want to know take note of that. And then also now you were talking about this eight
[3:45:14.940 --> 3:45:20.780]  month old that was jabbed. You broke that the other day. There was a big story on the youngest
[3:45:20.780 --> 3:45:25.740]  person to be quote unquote vaccinated or jabbed with this. That little poor baby has no idea
[3:45:26.300 --> 3:45:31.180]  the rest of his life, you know, why he's going to have all these side effects and weird things
[3:45:31.180 --> 3:45:37.180]  happening to him. The positive takeaway is that the daily count of people receiving dose one
[3:45:37.180 --> 3:45:43.580]  reported to the CDC by the date administered here in the United States has gone down significantly
[3:45:44.140 --> 3:45:48.620]  since Alex Jones and myself have begun really talking about this specifically to the thanks
[3:45:48.620 --> 3:45:53.820]  of people like you and other brave doctors like Kerry Meday and you know, Simone Gold and some
[3:45:53.820 --> 3:45:56.620]  of these other people that have been coming forward. McCullough. There's some other really
[3:45:56.620 --> 3:46:01.660]  good doctors that are being brave out here coming forward. I talked to a person in the UK
[3:46:01.660 --> 3:46:07.500]  who says that a coroner during an inquest is actually going to confirm that it was the injection
[3:46:07.500 --> 3:46:14.460]  that killed his wife Kim. We talked about that. But now let's talk about this. What about the
[3:46:14.460 --> 3:46:20.540]  question that hasn't been asked the billion dollars that was spent of taxpayer money a billion
[3:46:20.540 --> 3:46:26.140]  that's a billion with a B of your money and of my money that was allocated towards what they're
[3:46:26.140 --> 3:46:32.780]  calling vaccine confidence. Now, Dr. Ruby, you just said that these people are ignoring the
[3:46:32.780 --> 3:46:37.180]  guidance, right? They're ignoring the warnings. They've been warned. They had this. There was a
[3:46:37.180 --> 3:46:41.580]  conference, you know, the CDC way back in December. They knew about all this. They're still pushing
[3:46:41.580 --> 3:46:46.460]  for this. And now a billion dollars spent in vaccine confidence. What does that mean? Well,
[3:46:46.460 --> 3:46:52.540]  what that means is that they're using social media like Facebook and Twitter. They're paying these
[3:46:52.540 --> 3:46:58.700]  these oligarchs, basically, which is the reason why your fact checked. It's the reason why you're
[3:46:58.700 --> 3:47:02.780]  censored. It's the reason why your accounts get banned, suspended or deleted because they are paid
[3:47:02.780 --> 3:47:08.220]  to do that by the globalists who want you so desperately to be injected with this thing. And
[3:47:08.220 --> 3:47:12.620]  the reason they want you injected with this thing right now is because Dr. Ruby, I'm going to
[3:47:12.620 --> 3:47:18.780]  speculate. It's more than likely with this, this lipid nanoparticle, this ingredient that's not
[3:47:18.780 --> 3:47:24.140]  even approved for humans or let alone veterinary use. It's going to come out that we're seeing the
[3:47:24.140 --> 3:47:30.380]  decrease in people that are signing up to get this unknown jab. And I believe that the FDA is
[3:47:30.380 --> 3:47:36.540]  going to not have an easy time approving this thing. So the push to get it to get to get everybody
[3:47:36.540 --> 3:47:42.540]  inoculated before the FDA says we can't we can't approve this thing. Do you agree that that that
[3:47:42.540 --> 3:47:48.380]  might be an over the target analysis of why this money is being spent on on convincing everybody
[3:47:48.380 --> 3:47:55.260]  to sales pitch to go get inoculated? Of course. In fact, I think they want to push this thing
[3:47:55.260 --> 3:48:01.180]  so far to get as many people injected as possible before people really find out what this is really
[3:48:01.180 --> 3:48:06.220]  about what's going on and what's inside of these things. And by the way, if you didn't get the
[3:48:06.220 --> 3:48:12.380]  Moderna, but you got the Pfizer or any of the others, don't feel like you've escaped this SM102
[3:48:12.380 --> 3:48:17.420]  and the dangers of it. There are other excipients that are used for the nanolipid particle,
[3:48:17.420 --> 3:48:22.300]  like like polyethylene glycol. You might say, well, they use it in small amounts, you know,
[3:48:22.300 --> 3:48:27.100]  and it's in the human body and, you know, face injections were by cosmetologists and things
[3:48:27.100 --> 3:48:33.180]  like that. No, this is a very dangerous material. We have no idea. They won't disclose how much of
[3:48:33.180 --> 3:48:38.220]  it what the concentration is in that injection. It could be very, very different from just the
[3:48:38.220 --> 3:48:43.740]  whatever the normal amounts are. And so I think there's a rush and I think everyone should be
[3:48:43.740 --> 3:48:51.100]  super suspicious. Why would they rush to vaccinate and inject people with something that is now
[3:48:51.100 --> 3:48:58.380]  over? There is virtually zero. There are virtually zero cases of death cases. I mean,
[3:48:58.380 --> 3:49:04.860]  and now we're pushing it on our small children and babies to kind of finish this whole process up.
[3:49:04.860 --> 3:49:09.420]  I keep telling people, Stu, they've got it. They've got to wait. You don't lose anything
[3:49:09.420 --> 3:49:14.060]  right now by holding off this thing. And the reason why there aren't any new cases and we're
[3:49:14.060 --> 3:49:17.420]  coming to find out right now that it's not really the virus that's making you sick,
[3:49:18.540 --> 3:49:24.380]  but rather that it's the spike proteins and the spike proteins are found in and created by
[3:49:24.380 --> 3:49:28.780]  whatever is inside of these injections, which now we're slowly starting to realize
[3:49:28.780 --> 3:49:36.140]  are things that are not even approved for animals. Dr. Jean Ruby, so much and breaking news here.
[3:49:36.140 --> 3:49:42.540]  I'm Alex Jones show at freeworldnews.tv about this shedding and what is causing it. We certainly
[3:49:42.540 --> 3:49:47.820]  appreciate your expertise and the responsibility in not coming out here causing a panic because
[3:49:47.820 --> 3:49:52.140]  you told me yesterday that you were looking into something that could help identify this
[3:49:52.140 --> 3:49:56.540]  shedding stuff. If you have information tips or a story that you want to get to Dr. Ruby,
[3:49:56.540 --> 3:50:00.460]  she wants to make her personal proton email available to you by the way at Dr.
[3:50:00.460 --> 3:50:08.460]  Jean Ruby at protonmail.com and we appreciate her being here when it's coming out. He's got the
[3:50:08.460 --> 3:50:12.700]  war room and my name is Stu Peters. By the way, I want to remind you to get over to
[3:50:12.700 --> 3:50:18.220]  stupeters.tv after you leave freeworldnews.tv to check out that George Papadopoulos interview.
[3:50:18.220 --> 3:50:24.300]  If you want to know what's taking so long with the Durham report, well, he names names. He goes
[3:50:24.300 --> 3:50:29.100]  right into all of the reasons. He all of the players that are involved. This is a global
[3:50:29.100 --> 3:50:35.900]  concerted effort to topple the entire political system of our republic and it's shocking.
[3:50:35.900 --> 3:50:59.900]  My name is Stu Peters. Thanks for having me on the Alex Jones show. We'll see you next week.
