[00:00.000 --> 00:18.840]  Well, it's very traitorous what's happened and State Representative David Simpson told
[00:18.840 --> 00:20.720]  us about this this morning.
[00:20.720 --> 00:27.320]  They rewrote the bill in the House to say that basically for any reason they can grope
[00:27.320 --> 00:32.000]  you so they took a bill saying we're going to enforce the law that police or anybody
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.160]  else can't stick their hands down your pants without a warrant and they've said now basically
[00:36.160 --> 00:41.400]  if government feels like it they can and they're now selling that now remember the
[00:41.400 --> 00:46.400]  House unanimously voted a month ago to enforce the law and say you can't touch on the outside
[00:46.400 --> 00:51.520]  of the inside of the pants or skirt or whatever it is and now they've twisted that to say
[00:51.520 --> 00:57.760]  yes TSA for any reason can basically give you a proctology exam if they want to so the
[00:57.760 --> 01:02.800]  95 year old ladies down to cancer get ready there a world of hurts coming this is all

[09:43.920 --> 09:53.800]  falls water in southern oregon northern california for a fish that's not even indigenous and
[09:53.800 --> 09:59.560]  ruined tens of thousands of farmers property and livelihoods why would the feds do something
[09:59.560 --> 10:07.520]  so naked so abusive why would the tsa grab members of the texas legislators genitals
[10:07.520 --> 10:12.880]  and crush them and say this is punishment i mean the state reps the head of the energy
[10:12.880 --> 10:19.200]  commission happened to him as well said that they were told you're now being punished when
[10:19.200 --> 10:25.040]  they found out they were texas legislators in new orleans a few weeks ago flying out why
[10:25.040 --> 10:33.960]  would they do something so insanely wild why would gmo companies like monsanto openly
[10:33.960 --> 10:40.600]  brag that they plan on infecting all of the natural food crops on the planet with their
[10:40.600 --> 10:48.280]  genetics so you don't have a choice and have to eat gmo why would obama come out yesterday
[10:48.280 --> 10:55.320]  and say there's not even a discussion of the constitution and he doesn't even need to discuss
[10:55.320 --> 11:04.560]  it why would congress people yesterday call illegal aliens in to testify and to sit behind
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.240]  the head of homeland security who was a traitorous governor of course in arizona trying to open
[11:10.240 --> 11:16.200]  the borders up and openly say these people are going to be our future presidents when
[11:16.200 --> 11:24.960]  everyone knows you've got to be natural born in this country to run for president why i
[11:24.960 --> 11:35.560]  ask you would they do such brazen things and the list goes on and on it is a psychological
[11:35.560 --> 11:45.200]  warfare tactic to exercise power over people and to break their will and i have likened
[11:45.200 --> 11:52.120]  it in the psychology and there's actual declassified british u.s. french russian psychological warfare
[11:52.120 --> 11:57.560]  manuals where they talk about breaking the will of a population but to use a pop culture
[11:57.560 --> 12:05.640]  example i don't watch a lot of television and i forget the name of the hpo special but
[12:05.640 --> 12:13.200]  five six years ago i caught 15 20 minutes of it it was a show about pimps and the they
[12:13.200 --> 12:23.200]  talked to several pimps and and and they explained the pimp game and the pimp game is to get
[12:23.200 --> 12:32.400]  young women who are runaways get them addicted to drugs and then absolutely beat them torture
[12:32.400 --> 12:38.280]  them treat them like absolute garbage and these women even when they're not on drugs
[12:38.280 --> 12:46.600]  grovel and plead and they ask the pimps well what do you give your whores and he said
[12:46.600 --> 12:53.000]  i give him nothing they don't keep any of the money they're lucky if i buy him a piece
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.560]  of chicken and then they cut to this woman who's been run over and beaten and she's
[12:58.560 --> 13:04.880]  half dead in the hospital room and her mother's there in the pimp arrogantly comes in again
[13:04.880 --> 13:10.360]  right in front of the mother the mother should have attacked him comes right in see he's even
[13:10.360 --> 13:18.440]  pimping her the old days folks he'd be taken out back and hung but or or there'd be a daddy
[13:18.440 --> 13:22.160]  there with that girl who would you know pimple never make it in the building but see we've
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.600]  learned that when somebody's arrogant we just lay down to him and she's begging the pimps
[13:27.600 --> 13:31.840]  she's saying i'm so sorry i'm in this hospital i'm gonna get back on my feet baby i'm gonna
[13:31.840 --> 13:36.480]  get back on my feet i'm gonna make you that money and she's begging and pleading with
[13:36.480 --> 13:41.840]  him like she's bad that she's almost dead and the woman looks the mother looks at the
[13:41.840 --> 13:47.840]  pimp and says what have you done to my baby well it should be what mama's doing to him
[13:47.840 --> 13:52.840]  let me just tell you you ever do anything to my children you're not gonna have to worry
[13:52.840 --> 13:59.480]  about the police i'm on record you're deader than a hammer you're deader than a hammer
[13:59.480 --> 14:04.840]  and that's why we had liberty in this country because in the old days if you were corrupt
[14:04.840 --> 14:09.960]  police if you were corrupt government if if if if you were thugs out of control people
[14:09.960 --> 14:15.720]  didn't care if they were outnumbered they would sell their life to make sure you got
[14:15.720 --> 14:22.240]  justice and that's the essence of liberty standing up calling the bluff of bullies calling
[14:22.240 --> 14:31.280]  the bluff of thugs but instead america is like a sore covered crack whore with cigarette
[14:31.280 --> 14:36.600]  burns all over her body so malnourished her hair is all falling out now i've seen examples
[14:36.600 --> 14:41.720]  of beautiful young women two or three years later that that the pimps can't sell for five
[14:41.720 --> 14:48.400]  dollars and then they just shrivel up they get hiv they die they die a hepatitis whatever
[14:48.400 --> 14:53.560]  the case is they're so malnourished you know they die of cervical cancer you can really
[14:53.560 --> 14:58.240]  only get that generally unless you're extremely malnourished and have an autoimmune problem
[14:58.240 --> 15:06.920]  and have been with ten thousand men now that's what america is america is a disheveled seventy
[15:06.920 --> 15:17.400]  nine pound crack whore in a flop house on a dirty mattress and the globalist are done
[15:17.400 --> 15:21.600]  with us they're sucking the country dry they're using our military up they're done with us
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.280]  just like grease just like iran just like everywhere else they've broken our will and
[15:26.280 --> 15:32.520]  it's time to realize you got nothing to lose nothing to lose but to get aggressive and
[15:32.520 --> 15:38.440]  in the face of the system and to decry it you know i have a lot of famous prominent people
[15:38.440 --> 15:43.760]  call me and it's it's almost always the same they want to thank me and they want to say
[15:43.760 --> 15:47.440]  that they appreciate what i'm doing but they're not ready to come out and speak out at this
[15:47.440 --> 15:54.480]  time and generally when i talk to them you know i i i wish they had the courage because
[15:54.480 --> 16:01.200]  if we don't all stand up it's over for society we're going to have a malice or Stalinist
[16:01.200 --> 16:05.720]  or hitlerian type scenario you can see it all now happening because corruption has just
[16:05.720 --> 16:12.760]  been completely turned loose and but but but sometimes i talk to prominent people who are
[16:12.760 --> 16:17.400]  off record who've had such incredible things happen to their family and then i'm not at
[16:17.400 --> 16:23.800]  liberty to talk about it that you would be embarrassed to tell them they need to do more
[16:23.800 --> 16:31.760]  i mean i was telling this person last night and they're listening probably right now some
[16:31.760 --> 16:36.600]  of the things that i've been through and he said oh but how about this and and what they
[16:36.600 --> 16:41.040]  told me of course was on record i mean it's well known event but just to just to think
[16:41.040 --> 16:47.120]  about it how ruthless this system is and at a certain point ladies and gentlemen you've
[16:47.120 --> 16:52.720]  got to realize the cowering down the laying down the giving into the intimidation is the
[16:52.720 --> 17:00.080]  essence of our destruction because you think things are bad now it it's only going to get
[17:00.080 --> 17:06.480]  worse it's only going to intensify we haven't even begun the accelerated slide down the
[17:06.480 --> 17:12.520]  slippery slope i mean look at these articles obama on libya i don't even have to get to
[17:12.520 --> 17:18.920]  the constitutional question just total arrogance people are saying doesn't he know it's clearly
[17:18.920 --> 17:23.160]  illegal even all these democrats and nadler and franken are saying he's got to get congressional
[17:23.160 --> 17:28.800]  approval what is he thinking why would he dare say i've got the un authority when it's
[17:28.800 --> 17:35.040]  so clearly cut and dry well it's cut and dry police have to have warrants to come in your
[17:35.040 --> 17:38.880]  house but all over the country federal courts and state courts are ruling no more warrants
[17:38.880 --> 17:46.240]  needed it's cut and dry that illegal aliens aren't just left alone they are above the
[17:46.240 --> 17:52.760]  law in 800 plus sanctuary cities and the police are on record they arrest them for drunk driving
[17:52.760 --> 18:00.160]  they're just released by the judges and they get reprimanded but then i am seen as a milk
[18:00.160 --> 18:06.360]  cow citizen whether you're white ispanic black whatever the case is you if you're american
[18:06.360 --> 18:12.560]  boom it's open season on you now now why is that because the globalists want a north american
[18:12.560 --> 18:18.800]  union they want open borders they don't want to empower mexico see i i believe in win win
[18:18.800 --> 18:22.960]  i i i believe mexico needs to win if we're going to win i want those people to have
[18:22.960 --> 18:27.200]  freedom i want them to have a second amendment i want them to have free speech but then they
[18:27.200 --> 18:31.200]  come up here and wave mexican flags and tell me how bad america is and that they want this
[18:31.200 --> 18:37.320]  to be mexico and 80 plus percent of the fans in southern california boo the star spangled

[24:14.360 --> 24:20.280]  first get into a little clip here obama on libya i don't even have to get to the constitutional
[24:20.280 --> 24:27.120]  question and because he goes on to say this is not a war and it's just all about you know
[24:27.120 --> 24:33.640]  showing you a red car and you go that's a red car and they go no it's a green car and
[24:33.640 --> 24:37.840]  they go no you're a conspiracy theorist i say it's a red car even though it's really a green
[24:37.840 --> 24:43.880]  car it's like the fella called in yesterday where the tsa grabbed and crushed his genitals
[24:43.880 --> 24:49.520]  and he's a medical company worker salesman and he went back to his company said i can't
[24:49.520 --> 24:54.200]  fly anymore and they said why are you a conspiracy theorist there was no debating that they're
[24:54.200 --> 25:02.400]  grabbing and squeezing men and women's genitals brass you name it but but see now if you even
[25:02.400 --> 25:08.640]  have an opinion about your body the pimp says bam punches in the nose you're like baby why
[25:08.640 --> 25:13.480]  did you punch me in the nose i didn't punch you in the nose shut up bam what was that
[25:13.480 --> 25:17.360]  you didn't punch me in the nose that's right that's not blood coming out of your nose it's
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.280]  ketchup now thank me for the ketchup you're like yes thank you for the ketchup and and
[25:22.280 --> 25:26.600]  so americans that have bought into the lies they're going to buy in more and more no matter
[25:26.600 --> 25:31.760]  how bad it gets just like the germans just like the russians just like the chinese that
[25:31.760 --> 25:36.400]  they just okay i'll do whatever you say whatever you say you say the sky's red it's red even
[25:36.400 --> 25:43.080]  though it's blue it's a bluebird so here is ron paul talking about it and you know commenting
[25:43.080 --> 25:49.000]  and and the reporter is straight-faced saying well obama says it isn't a war need and he
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.040]  doesn't need it she's playing along with it almost like ron paul is the weirdo that's
[25:56.040 --> 25:59.160]  like seeing in years ago saying that there was no trans texas corridor and there were
[25:59.160 --> 26:03.720]  billboards up they were designating the roads it was all over our news but they knew the
[26:03.720 --> 26:07.960]  other 49 states didn't know about the nafta highway starting in texas and so they would
[26:07.960 --> 26:12.680]  say ron paul's crazy he believes in a nap the super highway in a trans texas corridor
[26:12.680 --> 26:17.000]  all the official government documents all the official admissions all of it happening
[26:17.000 --> 26:27.400]  but they just go ha ha ha ron paul said the sky was blue ha ha ha see they're creating
[26:27.400 --> 26:32.800]  a false reality and you go up that ladder if you buy into it now let's go ahead and
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.140]  play this clip here it is congressman paul thank you for joining us first of all you
[26:38.140 --> 26:42.240]  think the president does not have the right to engage the u.s and the nato led effort
[26:42.240 --> 26:44.880]  in Libya without Congress' approval.
[26:44.880 --> 26:49.280]  Today in his press conference, the President made clear that he believes the law does allow
[26:49.280 --> 26:52.080]  him to make this commitment on his own.
[26:52.080 --> 26:54.600]  Listen to this for a moment, if you would.
[26:54.600 --> 27:02.000]  I'm not a Supreme Court Justice, so I'm not going to put my constitutional law professor
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  hat on here.
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.920]  Do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers Resolution?
[27:08.920 --> 27:11.240]  The answer is no.
[27:11.240 --> 27:14.600]  So I don't even have to get to the constitutional question.
[27:14.600 --> 27:18.440]  Simply sir, what's your reaction?
[27:18.440 --> 27:20.320]  That's a horrible statement.
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.120]  No, he should get to the Constitution.
[27:24.120 --> 27:26.880]  He doesn't have to be a constitutional lawyer.
[27:26.880 --> 27:27.880]  Oh, that's enough.
[27:27.880 --> 27:28.880]  You take an oath of office.
[27:28.880 --> 27:32.600]  Look, ladies and gentlemen, the Congress has come out and said you have to come to us.
[27:32.600 --> 27:36.520]  We have three branches of government for a reason, and then he knows it'd take the
[27:36.520 --> 27:39.040]  Supreme Court years to ever hear a case about this.
[27:39.040 --> 27:44.640]  It'd be a constitutional crisis if the Supreme Court tried to block the President, and it's
[27:44.640 --> 27:48.400]  the Congress that has that power to declare war.
[27:48.400 --> 27:53.520]  So he's saying Congress doesn't matter.
[27:53.520 --> 27:54.520]  This isn't a war.
[27:54.520 --> 27:56.440]  I'm just doing this.
[27:56.440 --> 27:59.320]  And he says it with a straight face.
[27:59.320 --> 28:04.400]  As the President has said, as Congressman Nadler has said, for the office of the presidency
[28:04.400 --> 28:12.560]  to be an imperial power, to be a king, to be an emperor, to be a absolute dictator.
[28:12.560 --> 28:20.280]  And Ron Paul goes on to talk about this pure precept or this idea that, well, it's like
[28:20.280 --> 28:24.240]  Dick Cheney saying, I'm not even in the executive and under executive control.
[28:24.240 --> 28:27.800]  I am an office unto myself, a new branch of government.
[28:27.800 --> 28:29.440]  Remember that?
[28:29.440 --> 28:35.840]  And so here's Obama out in the open just doing this and saying it's not a war on top
[28:35.840 --> 28:36.840]  of it.
[28:36.840 --> 28:43.320]  He went on to say, if you go to the full speech, but now shifting gears, as we go out to break
[28:43.320 --> 28:49.440]  and come back and talk more about this, illegal aliens step boldly out of shadows at Dream
[28:49.440 --> 28:50.440]  Act hearing.
[28:50.440 --> 29:00.840]  These are illegal aliens and it gets worse, a Durban, Senator Durban made the following
[29:00.840 --> 29:01.840]  statement.
[29:01.840 --> 29:05.920]  When I look around this room, I see Americans future, our doctors, our teachers, our nurses,
[29:05.920 --> 29:10.160]  our engineers, our scientists, our soldiers, our congressmen, our senators, and maybe our
[29:10.160 --> 29:12.600]  president.
[29:12.600 --> 29:18.400]  But the illegal aliens and legal people in LA were massively booing the Star Spangled
[29:18.400 --> 29:22.080]  Banner and see, I'm supposed to go, oh, well, political correctness.
[29:22.080 --> 29:26.320]  In fact, we'll come back from break and play this clip and go over that.
[29:26.320 --> 29:33.040]  So Obama says he doesn't need Congress, doesn't matter what Congress says.
[29:33.040 --> 29:38.480]  It's an issue for the Supreme Court, so he kicks the can down the road and wouldn't even
[29:38.480 --> 29:41.680]  look up when he was saying it.
[29:41.680 --> 29:45.960]  And again, they're just doing all of this out in the open, more and more brazen, rubbing
[29:45.960 --> 29:46.960]  our noses in it.
[29:46.960 --> 29:50.080]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[29:50.080 --> 29:53.800]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[29:53.800 --> 29:57.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:57.600 --> 30:02.320]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[30:02.320 --> 30:07.080]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize
[30:07.080 --> 30:08.080]  risk.
[30:08.080 --> 30:09.320]  Saving means to make money.
[30:09.320 --> 30:13.520]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[30:13.520 --> 30:19.080]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[30:19.080 --> 30:24.880]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[30:24.880 --> 30:26.480]  or antibacterials.
[30:26.480 --> 30:32.120]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[30:32.120 --> 30:34.400]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[30:34.400 --> 30:37.680]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[30:37.680 --> 30:39.760]  to do something you've never done before.

[30:59.280 --> 31:03.920]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[31:03.920 --> 31:08.240]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[31:08.240 --> 31:12.920]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[31:12.920 --> 31:13.920]  you to have.
[31:13.920 --> 31:19.600]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[31:19.600 --> 31:23.920]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[31:23.920 --> 31:27.920]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[31:27.920 --> 31:31.400]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[31:31.400 --> 31:35.120]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[31:35.120 --> 31:39.800]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[31:39.800 --> 31:43.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[31:43.680 --> 31:45.040]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[31:45.040 --> 31:49.280]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[32:00.440 --> 32:05.360]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying
[32:05.360 --> 32:09.440]  raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[32:09.440 --> 32:13.920]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[32:13.920 --> 32:19.760]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[32:19.760 --> 32:25.040]  As of July 1st, eFoodsDirect is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship
[32:25.040 --> 32:28.240]  you the best storeable food on the planet.
[32:28.240 --> 32:33.000]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by

[33:11.280 --> 33:16.480]  Here's some of the news that's coming up, California announcing huge taxes on the internet
[33:16.480 --> 33:20.480]  and other states moving in, that means also tracking and controlling it.
[33:20.480 --> 33:27.760]  The power to taxes, the power to destroy jobless claims hit 428,000 for 12 straight weeks,
[33:27.760 --> 33:32.480]  over 400,000 a month.
[33:32.480 --> 33:40.200]  TSA lets a Nigerian man fly from New York to LA with fake ID, day old boarding pass.
[33:40.200 --> 33:47.600]  Oh, I mean, the government got another African on the plane in Amsterdam, he was called the
[33:47.600 --> 33:52.960]  Christmas Day Underwear Bomber, and they helped get him his documents, and then they
[33:52.960 --> 33:56.720]  still wouldn't let him on the plane, and it turned out the US government basically ordered
[33:56.720 --> 34:04.520]  the whole thing, but I guess that's okay, but getting back just to the arrogance of
[34:04.520 --> 34:09.360]  the system before I get into the whole illegal alien situation, here's Paul Joseph Watson's
[34:09.360 --> 34:11.680]  article, Obama on Libya.
[34:11.680 --> 34:16.760]  I don't even have to get to the constitutional question, just I don't even have to even debate
[34:16.760 --> 34:17.760]  it.
[34:17.760 --> 34:22.960]  I'm not even going to discuss what Congress is saying, because I can do whatever I want.
[34:22.960 --> 34:26.560]  During a speech yesterday, Barack Obama delivered probably the most arrogant statement thus
[34:26.560 --> 34:32.960]  far, betraying his open hostility to the rule of law as it applies to his administration's
[34:32.960 --> 34:37.960]  illegal war on Libya.
[34:37.960 --> 34:43.120]  Really dismissing criticism from Congress and remarking, I don't even have to get to
[34:43.120 --> 34:44.360]  the constitutional question.
[34:44.360 --> 34:45.360]  That's a quote.
[34:45.360 --> 34:50.360]  Speaking to CNN Congressman Ron Paul reacted to Obama's disregard for the Constitution
[34:50.360 --> 34:56.840]  by labeling his claim a horrible statement, quote, you take an oath of office to obey
[34:56.840 --> 35:02.360]  the Constitution, the Constitution is very clear, you don't go to war without a declaration,
[35:02.360 --> 35:03.360]  said Paul.
[35:03.360 --> 35:09.280]  And Obama said, I don't even have to get to the constitutional question.
[35:09.280 --> 35:10.280]  You hear that?
[35:10.280 --> 35:19.560]  With Congress suing him and his own party saying, obviously this is wrong.
[35:19.560 --> 35:24.160]  They don't care.
[35:24.160 --> 35:28.080]  But should Obama's rampant hypocrisy really surprise us?
[35:28.080 --> 35:35.440]  This is the Nobel Peace Laureate who has more U.S. troops deployed than at any other time
[35:35.440 --> 35:39.920]  under George W. Bush, and by the way, they have the numbers out this week, record numbers
[35:39.920 --> 35:46.640]  of U.S. troops getting killed this month in Iraq, but it's peace, though.
[35:46.640 --> 35:51.600]  This is a man who came to power promising to end war, yet has involved the United States
[35:51.600 --> 35:58.480]  in more conflicts than Bush ever presided over, but they're not wars, though, so.
[35:58.480 --> 36:01.880]  It's even more Orwellian, they're kinetic peace actions.
[36:01.880 --> 36:07.480]  Obama has used word games and mental gymnastics to claim he hasn't violated the war powers
[36:07.480 --> 36:13.280]  resolution, even as universities, apartment blocks and marketplaces are bombed killing
[36:13.280 --> 36:14.880]  innocent civilians.
[36:14.880 --> 36:19.080]  And even as the two top Pentagon lawyers that the president has never ignored told him he
[36:19.080 --> 36:24.480]  had to get congressional approval, he said, I have gotten the lawyer's approval and it
[36:24.480 --> 36:28.520]  turned out that was a lie when it came out that he was lying, he said, I don't need their
[36:28.520 --> 36:29.520]  approval.
[36:29.520 --> 36:36.440]  Well, I don't know if he needs those lawyers approval, but they've always talked to the
[36:36.440 --> 36:41.840]  lawyers, but certainly he needs Congress's approval.
[36:41.840 --> 36:44.720]  This is a man who came to power promising to end the war.
[36:44.720 --> 36:48.760]  Remember that Obama has used word games and mental gymnastics to claim he hasn't violated
[36:48.760 --> 36:53.800]  the war powers resolution, even as universities, apartment blocks and marketplaces are bombed
[36:53.800 --> 37:00.840]  killing innocent civilians, communications are blocked, TV stations bombed, power bombed,
[37:00.840 --> 37:03.680]  phone systems bombed with the people inside.
[37:03.680 --> 37:08.240]  And even as top admirals now admit that the scope of the mission is all about regime change
[37:08.240 --> 37:10.280]  and that they are trying to kill Gaddafi.
[37:10.280 --> 37:14.360]  Well, obviously they are, but he lies and says, no, we're not it, no, we're not.
[37:14.360 --> 37:19.120]  The Obama administration still clings to the ludicrous fallacy that the bombardment of
[37:19.120 --> 37:20.480]  Libya is not a war.
[37:20.480 --> 37:26.320]  Indeed, the White House itself characterized the goal in Libya as installing a democratic
[37:26.320 --> 37:31.920]  system, a euphemism for regime change, acknowledging that the agenda goes far beyond protecting
[37:31.920 --> 37:35.720]  civilians as Obama claimed during his March 19 speech.
[37:35.720 --> 37:42.440]  Remember way back in March three plus months ago, while White House counsel Bob Bauer claims
[37:42.440 --> 37:48.040]  the, that because the U.S. and NATO has reserved its campaign to airstrikes relying on al-Qaeda
[37:48.040 --> 37:51.800]  terrorists to the dirty work on the ground aided by U.S., British and French special
[37:51.800 --> 37:56.040]  forces, this means the U.S. is not engaged in sustained fighting.
[37:56.040 --> 38:01.520]  In other words, because the conflict is pretty much a Turkey shoot so far with Gaddafi unable
[38:01.520 --> 38:08.360]  to zap fighter jets out of the sky, that turns an act of aggressive warfare into a loving
[38:08.360 --> 38:13.600]  exercise of peaceful slaughter.
[38:13.600 --> 38:14.800]  And it goes on.
[38:14.800 --> 38:20.960]  Barack Obama, the Nobel Peace Laureate, committed U.S. forces to the bombardment, promising
[38:20.960 --> 38:26.360]  it would last days, not weeks, three months and a billion dollars later as Obama is now
[38:26.360 --> 38:32.560]  preparing to do the one thing he explicitly promised not to do, send in ground troops
[38:32.560 --> 38:38.920]  because NATO and the U.S. backed al-Qaeda terrorists just aren't getting the job done properly.
[38:38.920 --> 38:44.160]  Having ignored his own constitutional lawyers on the legality of the conquest Obama then
[38:44.160 --> 38:50.160]  set about doing something else he promised was not on the agenda, targeting Gaddafi directly
[38:50.160 --> 38:56.600]  for assassination and regime change, NATO bombs have thus far failed to accomplish that feat,
[38:56.600 --> 39:03.920]  but killing Gaddafi's three grandchildren on May 1 was at least a consolation.
[39:03.920 --> 39:08.200]  It's abundantly clear that Obama's arrogance portrays a president who lives in a world
[39:08.200 --> 39:12.080]  of complete make-believe, well they're selling that to us, yes, thinking his loyalties lie
[39:12.080 --> 39:18.000]  with the U.N. and NATO and that Congress can go whistle in the wind, unsurprising therefore
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.760]  that during the same speech yesterday Obama characterized the people who will be hit by
[39:22.760 --> 39:29.960]  his tax increase, those who earn collectively 250,000, that's 125,000 a piece, a year as
[39:29.960 --> 39:35.120]  private jet owners to own a private jet even a smaller one, you better be making a couple
[39:35.120 --> 39:45.160]  million a year, a big one, 10, 15 million a year, I mean this is just incredible.
[39:45.160 --> 39:52.320]  Another example of his strident delusion, meanwhile the big multinational billionaires
[39:52.320 --> 39:56.280]  who openly write the tax code are exempt from all this stuff, when they say get the rich
[39:56.280 --> 40:00.920]  people that's so the ultra rich can grab the middle classes money and give it to the banks
[40:00.920 --> 40:08.840]  as quote bailouts and even that's a lie, it's complete open robbery.
[40:08.840 --> 40:12.960]  Three years ago before Obama and even defeated McCain for the presidency we foresaw how this
[40:12.960 --> 40:17.240]  corporate marketing creation would be used when you link to our article and video to
[40:17.240 --> 40:22.320]  front a new wave of humanitarian wars sold on false pretenses.
[40:22.320 --> 40:27.560]  Obama may eventually withdraw a portion of his troops from Iraq but mark our words they
[40:27.560 --> 40:32.720]  won't be home long before they are sent off to bomb another broken back third world country.
[40:32.720 --> 40:38.360]  This time the name of a United Nations backed humanitarian war, Justice Bill Clinton presided
[40:38.360 --> 40:43.860]  over the Somalia, Serbian wars with the full support of the establishment political left.
[40:43.860 --> 40:48.200]  We wrote a November 4, 2008 an article titled the more things change the more they stay
[40:48.200 --> 40:52.120]  the same and that was our prediction that came true.
[40:52.120 --> 40:57.840]  Now that said let me give you the news behind the news, the story behind the story, the
[40:57.840 --> 41:05.160]  rest of the story is Paul Harvey would say good day, how are they going to launch a ground
[41:05.160 --> 41:10.040]  invasion in late September early October as we've confirmed from sources at military
[41:10.040 --> 41:16.640]  bases at Fort Bragg, Fort Hood and Germany and private sources, letters and phone calls
[41:16.640 --> 41:22.480]  on top of it confirming just that from currently serving also contractor mercenaries and the
[41:22.480 --> 41:27.520]  wives of military people has been confirmed across the board that they've been told they're
[41:27.520 --> 41:32.560]  going in that doesn't mean it's 100% when they tell them be ready we're going in sometimes
[41:32.560 --> 41:36.680]  they pull back but I'd say 90% chance that's going to happen.
[41:36.680 --> 41:44.680]  How will they sell armored brigades, first cabin or three corps and others going in?
[41:44.680 --> 41:48.360]  How will this be sold to us as another act of peace?
[41:48.360 --> 41:52.200]  Well we're now seeing the chatter, we've been seeing it for three months but it's reaching
[41:52.200 --> 41:58.720]  fever pitch that Gaddafi is going to attack America and they're running TV ads across
[41:58.720 --> 42:05.680]  the country with Adam Gadan, the American Al Qaeda, Adam Perlman, I mean if you believe
[42:05.680 --> 42:09.400]  the grandson of the former head of the ADL who was arrested for beating up Muslims,
[42:09.400 --> 42:15.480]  now it's a big beard and says go buy guns at gun shows, kill everyone and then the government
[42:15.480 --> 42:19.040]  comes and says we've got to ban the gun shows because Al Qaeda is going to use them.
[42:19.040 --> 42:26.080]  I mean this is 100% transparent and remember you're told that the police state is for the
[42:26.080 --> 42:30.440]  Muslims okay, live in the real world ladies and gentlemen.
[42:30.440 --> 42:34.200]  We get the Homeland Security, the Mike reports, countless other reports sent to us by law
[42:34.200 --> 42:38.520]  enforcement, others get them, the government admits they're real documents, at first when
[42:38.520 --> 42:43.280]  we got them a few years ago people couldn't believe them, where almost all, and that's
[42:43.280 --> 42:50.120]  in the news again today, almost all of the counterterrorism training is done in the United
[42:50.120 --> 42:54.920]  States with police and others to federalize them to meet American Al Qaeda and they say
[42:54.920 --> 43:02.360]  it's militias, it's Ron Paul supporters, they are going to link up with Al Qaeda.
[43:02.360 --> 43:09.000]  Oh yes, and you now hear them arresting people saying they're terrorist for selling legal
[43:09.000 --> 43:17.640]  gold coins and in the Liberty dollar case, you got to sell them for 13, 14 years, openly
[43:17.640 --> 43:21.960]  criticizing the Federal Reserve saying get your own silver and gold, anybody can, that's
[43:21.960 --> 43:26.880]  why they have all these commemorative mints, in fact he ran the Hawaiian Royal Mint, I
[43:26.880 --> 43:35.440]  remember seeing ads for that 30 years ago, Bernard Von Notehouse and even the Associated
[43:35.440 --> 43:40.200]  Press lawyers wrote articles and said we've looked at this conviction, he didn't violate
[43:40.200 --> 43:45.760]  U.S. code, this wasn't counterfeit Federal Reserve notes, themselves counterfeit U.S.
[43:45.760 --> 43:53.480]  notes and it didn't matter, the FBI and the federal U.S. attorneys said, and I read this
[43:53.480 --> 43:58.600]  again last week, they actually said we're going to infiltrate, disrupt and bring down
[43:58.600 --> 44:06.680]  these domestic terrorists that criticize the Federal Reserve, I mean it's, so the point
[44:06.680 --> 44:13.240]  is they're getting ready to start blowing stuff up and saying Qaddafi did it, how else
[44:13.240 --> 44:19.320]  did they get into Iraq, they stage 9-11 and you're like oh that's not true, the hijackers
[44:19.320 --> 44:25.280]  were at U.S. military bases, Newsweek, Associated Press, the U.S. embassies weren't going to
[44:25.280 --> 44:29.640]  let Muhammad out and others back in 9 months before 9-11 and they were ordered to let the
[44:29.640 --> 44:34.480]  men and told their terror designation as a CIA cover, they worked for us, I mean that's
[44:34.480 --> 44:39.760]  Toronto Star, that's Reuters, I've interviewed the people that worked at the embassy, Springman
[44:39.760 --> 44:45.120]  and others, he was the head of the visa section, same story with Kennedy, the undersecretary
[44:45.120 --> 44:50.000]  of state, when he got under heat for all the witnesses saying that the U.S. government
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.320]  got Mutalib the underwear Christmas Day bomber on the plane, this is on record, before it
[44:54.320 --> 44:58.320]  was on record then the government admitted it, we had witnesses on the plane who saw the
[44:58.320 --> 45:04.880]  sharp dressed man without a visa, we had the visa without the passport that the State Department
[45:04.880 --> 45:10.360]  was ordered to get him a visa and then help him get on the plane and he looked drugged,
[45:10.360 --> 45:14.720]  I mean the government puts drugged people with firecrackers in their pants so they can
[45:14.720 --> 45:19.000]  put naked body scanners in all the airports and further enslave us and then because a
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.680]  firecracker goes off in somebody's pants, they come after our basic liberties, if real
[45:23.680 --> 45:31.280]  terrorists blew up 100 airplanes, we wouldn't give up our basic liberties, I mean look what's
[45:31.280 --> 45:37.560]  been sold to us that if criminals are doing something wrong or terrorists might buy guns
[45:37.560 --> 45:41.880]  in America, we have to have our second amendment restricted, do you see how dangerous that
[45:41.880 --> 45:49.040]  idea is or Al Qaeda is now going to hit shopping malls and Walmarts so now TSA has to be there,
[45:49.040 --> 45:52.440]  we told you years ago because they said that was their plan it would happen, now they're
[45:52.440 --> 46:01.320]  rolling it out, it's total occupation, face it for what it is and so they're now going
[46:01.320 --> 46:07.920]  public with what was private and behind the scenes that the FBI and the ATF and the threat
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.600]  fusion centers and Intregard and the clergy response teams and the citizen spies and
[46:12.600 --> 46:21.160]  the Boy Scouts trained to spy on their parents on record now, all of this, oh guess what
[46:21.160 --> 46:27.880]  is not for 100 Al Qaeda left in Afghanistan, let's say it's all real, 100 guys in Afghanistan
[46:27.880 --> 46:34.520]  we've got to do this, 100 guys, a country of 320 million people, 320 million people because
[46:34.520 --> 46:41.720]  of 100 guys we've got to do all this, baloney, baloney, as if the government could ever
[46:41.720 --> 46:46.640]  protect you with this giant spy network and then you find out what they're spying on,
[46:46.640 --> 46:52.800]  they are telling the police these people that want to end the Fed, these anti-U.N. people,
[46:52.800 --> 46:58.440]  these people that don't want open borders, they're terrorist, they're going to attack,
[46:58.440 --> 47:05.720]  get ready, when they do, we've got to start arresting them en masse, so right as the economy
[47:05.720 --> 47:10.920]  is imploding, right as society is being brought down, right as they admit we're going into
[47:10.920 --> 47:15.480]  a depression and global receivership to these private banks that engineered it on record
[47:15.480 --> 47:23.360]  like Greece and others, oh my gosh, Gaddafi is going to blow stuff up, he's working with
[47:23.360 --> 47:28.400]  Al Qaeda, this is what the news is saying today and yesterday and the last couple months
[47:28.400 --> 47:34.720]  the main threat is domestic groups linking up with Al Qaeda and Gaddafi, the militias
[47:34.720 --> 47:41.400]  are working with Gaddafi and Al Qaeda, the red, white and blue, super patriot militias
[47:41.400 --> 47:45.720]  are working with Al Qaeda, ladies and gentlemen, the militias disappeared after 9-11 because
[47:45.720 --> 47:50.520]  most of the people bought it and went and stuck stickers on their cars saying terrorist
[47:50.520 --> 47:55.680]  hunting license, if anyone believes that, I got a bridge on the surface of the sun,
[47:55.680 --> 48:03.440]  I'm ready to sell you, but what's the other problem saying Al Qaeda backed Gaddafi forces
[48:03.440 --> 48:09.640]  are going to blow stuff up, it was Gaddafi that got the criminal court to issue in 1998
[48:09.640 --> 48:15.880]  the first, the FBI had done an event at that point, international inter-poll arrest warrant
[48:15.880 --> 48:20.680]  for Osama bin Laden, when it came out in the news that they were trying to use Al Qaeda
[48:20.680 --> 48:28.720]  in Libya to kill Muammar Gaddafi, but they think you're so dumb, they're now telling
[48:28.720 --> 48:35.200]  you he's working with Al Qaeda when on record the main rebel forces, LA times, New York
[48:35.200 --> 48:44.600]  times admittedly the main forces in the east of Libya are real Al Qaeda, real Sunni based
[48:44.600 --> 48:50.240]  Muslims that have been in Iraq battling the United States because there are some real
[48:50.240 --> 48:57.120]  groups, but originally founded and organized by the CIA in the 1980s, actually 1979 under
[48:57.120 --> 49:03.480]  Cardi and Brazilian if you want to get technical, but that's just like five years ago Bush
[49:03.480 --> 49:08.680]  put out a press release on the White House website saying we're working with four liberation
[49:08.680 --> 49:14.720]  groups to try to overthrow Iran and they listed the four groups and three of the four were
[49:14.720 --> 49:22.520]  Saudi Arabian based Wahhabi Al Qaeda groups and conducting bombings inside Iran, the fourth
[49:22.520 --> 49:28.560]  group was a Kurdish group and then our news would still say and McCain would still say
[49:28.560 --> 49:34.800]  on the news that Iran is working with Al Qaeda and that Iran is going to blow us up and might
[49:34.800 --> 49:40.160]  be behind 9-11 or a new attack and then Muhammad Karzai about a year later, this is now four
[49:40.160 --> 49:46.000]  years ago, is at a outdoor press conference at the Rose Garden with Bush and Bush looks
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.120]  at him and says Iran is helping the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Karzai knows
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.160]  this is broadcast to the Arab world where they know the difference between a Sunni and
[49:55.160 --> 50:00.760]  a Shiite and they know Iran's Shiite and a constant war with the Sunnis with the Wahhabi
[50:00.760 --> 50:07.960] ists and you know that's like saying the Dallas Cowboys are the San Francisco 49ers
[50:07.960 --> 50:12.520]  to a football fan, Karzai knew how crazy that sounded of course Bush was playing to the
[50:12.520 --> 50:17.880]  dumbed down American audience and he said respectfully Mr. President Iran fights Al Qaeda,
[50:17.880 --> 50:23.920]  they are Shiite and they're helping us in Afghanistan sir because there are some rebel
[50:23.920 --> 50:29.360]  groups and they again call those Al Qaeda and Bush said no you are incorrect they are
[50:29.360 --> 50:37.440]  Al Qaeda and Karzai said okay because it was so ridiculous Iran is not Al Qaeda, Qaddafi
[50:37.440 --> 50:42.760]  is not Al Qaeda, okay I mean I want to get this straight for everybody regardless of
[50:42.760 --> 50:47.600]  what you think Al Qaeda is when they tell you Qaddafi is going to launch Al Qaeda attacks
[50:47.600 --> 50:52.640]  ladies and gentlemen they think you're a moron and when they tell you Iran is with Al Qaeda
[50:52.640 --> 51:00.400]  get used beyond idiocy, we'll be right back with the illegal alien situation.

[54:30.920 --> 54:37.680]  so nothing can stand in their way to their global plutocratic fraud system based on ponsy
[54:37.680 --> 54:44.720]  schemes and so they're flooding the united states with illegal aliens now remember it's
[54:44.720 --> 54:54.200]  on record that Mexico has the most abusive immigrant policy in the Americas. From Chile
[54:54.200 --> 55:01.280]  all the way to Alaska, no country, no state, one-year forced labor in open-air, mosquito-infested
[55:01.280 --> 55:09.160]  facilities. Many times they beat to death Guatemalans that come in. I mean, it is incredible.
[55:09.160 --> 55:12.520]  Until recently, Americans couldn't even really buy property in Mexico, and it's still highly
[55:12.520 --> 55:18.280]  restricted. Extremely nationalistic. But America, the United States, is not supposed to have
[55:18.280 --> 55:23.560]  its nationalistic ideas. And so we've had the last two years, the illegal aliens caught
[55:23.560 --> 55:28.840]  working for Homeland Security, building part of the show fence in Texas and Arizona. Complete
[55:28.840 --> 55:34.660]  joke, they've now canceled it. Helping build part of the invisible fence as well, the high
[55:34.660 --> 55:40.320]  tech fence. There's been associated press in Fox News articles where they have a few
[55:40.320 --> 55:44.160]  staged raids a year, and the Border Patrol now admits they do this on the border. They're
[55:44.160 --> 55:49.480]  only allowed to arrest during certain quota media events, that they'll go to a meatpacking
[55:49.480 --> 55:56.520]  plant, arrest of 1,200 illegals in one case, and take them to give them green cards and
[55:56.520 --> 56:02.880]  then government jobs on the spot. So the illegal aliens from Latin America, particularly Mexico,
[56:02.880 --> 56:11.440]  are now the Hessian mercenaries economically, like the British, you know, German slash Hessian
[56:11.440 --> 56:17.880]  mercs were militarily in 1776, and for the next seven years of that war. And so they're
[56:17.880 --> 56:25.720]  brought in with the traitor in chief, Mr. Napolitano, excuse me, I'm sorry, Janet Napolitano,
[56:25.720 --> 56:33.080]  I'm Mrs. Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security, and she's there with them in the
[56:33.080 --> 56:41.480]  testimony with illegal aliens. There you have government aiding in crime, huge felonies,
[56:41.480 --> 56:46.840]  they don't care, just like Obama doesn't need a congressional approval to launch these wars.
[56:46.840 --> 56:55.680]  And there's Denver Post, abuse immigrants get special US visas. Now, and I guess that
[56:55.680 --> 56:59.920]  I haven't read that article, what is that about abused immigrants from Mexico abused
[56:59.920 --> 57:05.040]  by Mexico? I just know you can pull up articles where Mexico admits they're the most abusive
[57:05.040 --> 57:09.880]  in this area of the world. Okay, now let's go ahead and play this clip. After using illegal
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.120]  immigrants as props to push the Dream Act, Senator Durbin of Illinois made the following
[57:14.120 --> 57:18.960]  statement at a Senate committee hearing. When I look around this room, I see America's
[57:18.960 --> 57:23.560]  future, our doctors, our teachers, our nurses, our engineers, our scientists, our soldiers,
[57:23.560 --> 57:28.560]  our congressmen, our senators and maybe our president. So now I guess Schwarzenegger can
[57:28.560 --> 57:33.520]  be our president, you don't need the 22nd amendment. Let's play that clip. Here it is.
[57:33.520 --> 57:42.920]  Let me ask everyone here today who is a Dream Act student to stand and be recognized. Thank
[57:42.920 --> 57:46.240]  you so much for being here, for the sacrifice you made to come.
[57:46.240 --> 57:47.240]  Illegal aliens.
[57:47.240 --> 57:52.000]  You can be seated. When I look around this room, I see America's future, our doctors,
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.480]  our teachers, our nurses, our engineers, our scientists, our soldiers, our congressmen,
[57:57.480 --> 58:02.600]  our senators and maybe our president. Hey, gee, can I go down to Mexico and get a bunch
[58:02.600 --> 58:07.080]  of welfare? Because that's the big dirty secret, is that the immigrants do work hard
[58:07.080 --> 58:11.240]  on average, but they also get welfare. And there's news articles about that today. Heroin
[58:11.240 --> 58:18.360]  dealers getting welfare while they're on probation. But again, the immigrants are good, Americans
[58:18.360 --> 58:23.200]  are lazy and bad, even though we work more than anybody else in the western world. Americans
[58:23.200 --> 58:28.280]  are bad, worse to come. But the illegal aliens that boo the Stark Spangle Banner at major
[58:28.280 --> 58:33.600]  soccer events and cheer to some have been lauding right up for 9-11 at a soccer event.
[58:33.600 --> 58:43.480]  That's our future presidents. Not a natural born. No. No. We'll be right back.
[58:43.480 --> 58:51.640]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.640 --> 58:55.640]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[58:55.640 --> 59:00.480]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[59:00.480 --> 59:05.520]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is
[59:05.520 --> 59:11.040]  the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses
[59:11.040 --> 59:16.960]  the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the
[59:16.960 --> 59:22.760]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale
[59:22.760 --> 59:28.320]  of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the
[59:28.320 --> 59:33.600]  Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making
[59:33.600 --> 59:40.760]  production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[59:40.760 --> 59:47.760]  technology of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:33.240]  You know, I really can't do justice to his amazing bio, but perhaps I'll try later in
[1:00:33.240 --> 1:00:38.840]  the hour, but we've got so many things happening in the world. I don't know if I always agree
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:42.960]  with Lenin LaRouche's solutions, but I certainly know that he's got an incredible grasp on
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:49.960]  history and has been, well, just doing a lot of amazing things over the last 50 years.
[1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:56.520]  And of course, larouchepub.com is just one of their websites. He's been a presidential
[1:00:56.520 --> 1:01:03.960]  candidate, I don't know, former CIA director called him the best private intelligence network
[1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:09.960]  in the world. He was well-known back in the 80s for landing his helicopter at the CIA
[1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:14.320]  base in Lainley and being received by the director. Made a lot of folks jealous of him,
[1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:19.120]  and that's when Bush went after him. And I meant to pull that up today before the interview,
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:23.200]  you know, just so we could mention some of those stories. We'll see if LaRouche can talk
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:28.600]  about some of that today. But I first wanted to get Lenin LaRouche to break down where
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:32.440]  the state of the world is right now. This is a short segment, long segment coming up
[1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:38.120]  in a moment. But joining us from Germany is Lenin LaRouche. Thank you for joining us.
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:43.440]  Good to join you. Again, via video Skype, we see Financial
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:48.000]  Times of London talking about the end of dollar hegemony. The Chinese, since you last joined
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:53.360]  us, said that we are basically already have a technical default. Do you agree with that?
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:58.480]  Well, it's worse than that. We are in a general breakdown crisis of the international, you
[1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:05.560]  know, the transatlantic system. Everything is about to go down. There are remedies. But
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:10.680]  as long as this president remains president, there's no chance that these remedies will
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:20.760]  be supplied. However, as we know now, he has committed an act, a lie, which makes him impeachable.
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:25.280]  Now the question is whether the impeachment rage will be strong enough to put him out
[1:02:25.280 --> 1:02:31.320]  or not. But an attempt at impeachment at this time would cripple this guy and make him more
[1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:37.520]  accessible to control our legitimate institutions in the United States. Under those conditions,
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:42.760]  we can be hopeful. Well, I can ask a lot of questions here, but
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:46.240]  just a preview of what's coming up in the next hour. And again, we appreciate your time
[1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:51.120]  and your busy schedule, Mr. LaRouche. What are some of the topics that you would like
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:54.560]  to address for people out there? Because I have a lot of questions, but what do you
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:58.840]  think's most important right now? Well, first of all, is we have a problem
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:05.680]  with the British. They are, in a sense, controlling our destiny because we have a president who
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:11.520]  is nothing but a British asset. He's not, and he's not really a very stable person,
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:16.840]  and he has some very bad policies. So therefore, that's one of our big problems. Another one
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:22.040]  is that the entire system, the transatlantic system is now coming down. We've reached a
[1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:30.200]  point at which the failure of the last attempt at bailout, that this has created a situation
[1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:36.200]  which Europe has not yet corrected, which means that right now, Europe, and therefore
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:42.680]  also the United States, is on a slide down toward a breakdown as early as sometimes as
[1:03:42.680 --> 1:03:50.320]  coming month. There are remedies, of course, but the question is, if this guy remains president,
[1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:55.200]  is it possible to apply any of those remedies which do exist?
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:04:02.280]  Well, when we come back, we'll cover the waterfront, geopolitically, what's happening with the
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:09.600]  banks imploding Greece by design, Ireland, and others. And I'd first like to get your
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:13.880]  analysis, sir, on, because you do know the Anglo-American establishment. You're probably
[1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:21.200]  better than anybody. What their in-game is, what the strategy or stratagem is, and so
[1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:27.600]  we can know our enemy and then understand why they're doing what they're doing. And
[1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:34.160]  then I want to get your forecast on what you believe will happen versus what they're attempting
[1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:39.280]  to do. And then we'll talk about solutions and a lot more. And then later, I notice you
[1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:43.680]  never talk about yourself. And over the years doing research on you, you've had one of the
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:51.880]  fullest, most interesting lives. And so I think it's important for you to talk about
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:58.560]  your historical experiences as well. Lyndon LaRouche is our guest. I'm Alex Jones, GCNLive.com,
[1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:03.760]  their site, LaRouchePub.com. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:09.000]  century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:13.840]  this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've
[1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:18.840]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:25.000]  shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:30.440]  of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:35.600]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:39.760]  Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying,
[1:05:39.760 --> 1:05:44.600]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[1:05:44.600 --> 1:05:50.640]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet you're copy of Fall of the Republic on
[1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:59.640]  DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:04.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:06:04.320 --> 1:06:08.640]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:12.960]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:18.040]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:22.680]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:28.320]  is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:32.640]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:37.280]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:41.480]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:45.560]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can
[1:06:45.560 --> 1:06:52.320]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government

[1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:05.720]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying
[1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:11.160]  raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves. They haven't increased their prices
[1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:16.080]  on great long-term food reserves since last year. With the rising cost of raw materials
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:23.240]  and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer. As of July 1st, eFoodsDirect is forced to increase
[1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:28.720]  their prices so they can still ship you the best storeable food on the planet. Until the
[1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:37.640]  end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-5633.

[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:34.760]  National Security Council member Norman A. Bailey admitted in television interviews
[1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:39.320]  that he had regular meetings with the LaRouche group in Lennon, LaRouche, and that he circulated
[1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:45.120]  LaRouche material to the National Security Council. LaRouche, you can also research in
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:50.480]  the 80s, would give briefings to the CIA director and reportedly, you know, would land at the
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:55.800]  Lainley base via his private helicopter. I mean, I introduced LaRouche that way because
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:09:00.360]  LaRouche never really talks about himself. And Lennon, LaRouche, before we go any further
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:04.560]  and break down the world crisis that you've predicted and everything that's unfolding
[1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:09.160]  and why the system has come after you over the years, will you please, I know you don't
[1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:13.800]  like talking about yourself joining us via video connection from Germany where you are
[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:18.320]  right now, but I mean, can you please spend two or three minutes kind of chronicling your
[1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:24.760]  life and what you've done and, you know, from World War II? I mean, you're 90 years old,
[1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:25.760]  correct now, sir?
[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:28.680]  Not quite. I was born in 1922.
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:29.680]  So you're almost 90?
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:32.320]  I'm getting, looking at it.
[1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:37.600]  Because you look like you're about 79 or something.
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:39.640]  I'm fortunate in that respect.
[1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:44.360]  I mean, well, I mean, anyway, you slice it, you're one of the most interesting people
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:48.880]  that I've ever had the pleasure of interviewing. I mean, I just want to say that.
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:49.880]  Thank you.
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:55.680]  Well, listen, I know, because you never do this and your surrogates don't do it either.
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:10:00.040]  Please spend some time because I don't think I can adequately, I mean, mark some of the
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:06.080]  high points, low points, some of the incredible things you've seen and witnessed in your life.
[1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:11.680]  Well, I think that my experience became significant after World War II. During the war, I was
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:15.760]  there, but I wasn't too significant. I had some experiences and kept caught up in the
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:19.920]  immediate post-war period while I was still in no service.
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:27.360]  And at a later point, I emerged as an economist. And I, of course, I had the advantage that
[1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:33.560]  most of the economists are not competent in the major things that have to be done in forecasting
[1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:40.800]  because they believe in the current system of forecasting, which is based on the dollar,
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:46.480]  for example, or on currencies. And currencies do not necessarily correspond to the real
[1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:53.480]  physical economy. And in my view, and most of my work has been in this area, is to force
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:11:00.240]  the issue to my forecasting of certain kinds of major events, which have been always correct
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:06.400]  where my rivals have been failures, because they insist on statistical forecasting based
[1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:13.880]  on monetarist considerations. I base my forecasting on physical considerations. That is, what
[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:19.760]  are we doing to increase the productivity of our nation per capita, per square kilometer?
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:26.520]  What are we doing to increase the energy flux density we have for making our nation more
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:31.160]  productive? These are the factors I consider. And when we have policies which are based
[1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:36.920]  on a monetary system, leaving a Wall Street system sort of thing, that people are worried
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:43.360]  about Wall Street. I'm worried about the real economy. And repeatedly, Wall Street always
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:48.200]  fails because it's actually a thief. And it's more interesting what they can extract from
[1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:54.720]  people than for fostering real production. For example, look at China today. What is
[1:11:54.720 --> 1:12:03.720]  China doing? China is absorbing the industries we have shut down inside the United States.
[1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:08.600]  And this means that we are becoming more and more helpless because we no longer have the
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:13.920]  food supply. We no longer have the production, the actual production, which we as a nation
[1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:21.360]  control on which our economy depends. We're now in a very grave crisis. And I fear that
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:26.560]  as long as this fellow remains president, we're up for it, as they say in Britain.
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:30.360]  We're going to speak to that and get into the imminent collapse of the Euro that you
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:35.080]  predicted many years ago that now is mainstream news. Soros admitting that there's going
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:41.520]  to be some type of crack up. I want to get into Obama and the British connection and
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:45.400]  where you see things going geopolitically. But continuing for a few more minutes to
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:49.960]  talk about Lenin LaRouche, so new listeners out there, most of them know who you are,
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:55.240]  but only have seen a snapshot in the media characterizing you one way or the other.
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:58.720]  What happened in the 1980s? Because you had breakthroughs then when you were actually,
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:02.880]  I've talked to folks that were there at the time. They say Ronald Reagan was reading your
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:08.720]  intelligence reports. It was admitted that the director of the CIA and the National Security
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:13.600]  Council people were listening to you. And then later, of course, that's why George Herbert
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:19.560]  Walker Bush came after you and tried to set you up for some things. But what was happening
[1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:24.040]  in the power structure that the highest levels of the US government were listening to you
[1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:25.040]  in the 1980s?
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:29.080]  Well, there were a number of reasons. First of all, I was involved in the formation of
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:35.920]  the Fusion Energy Foundation during the 1970s, which became a leading science institution
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:44.680]  in the United States. And while I was doing that, I ventured into other areas. I came
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:50.120]  up with a proposal of what became known later as the Strategic Defense Initiative. It was
[1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:56.920]  initially my own proposal based on evidence which I had. This then, at a later point,
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:05.440]  some of these old boys from the former intelligence services of World War II came into me and
[1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:11.440]  said, we like what you're doing. So I expanded it. And then I went on, especially in the
[1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:19.760]  very beginning of the 1980s, to extend this. And I had a major part of the retired senior
[1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:25.320]  military figures of Germany, France, Italy, and so forth, and many in our own country
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:30.880]  of that same circle. And they recognized that what I was doing in proposing this, that this
[1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:39.400]  was the way we should go. And we went in that direction, except that the president of that
[1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:46.000]  time, Broglie Reagan, endorsed this proposal. We made a shot at getting it. We were frustrated
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.560]  largely because of the liberals inside our political system. They thought that this was
[1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:57.320]  terrible, but obvious to us that we could have an arrangement in which the Soviet Union
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:04.640]  would change its policies to work with us on our side, so to speak. And it was a very
[1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:10.600]  good policy. A number of Soviet leaders agreed with me, agreed this was a good policy.
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:15.240]  Well, you proposed something, a different form of SDI, though, from what it, from the
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:19.880]  way it was sold, though, correct? I mean, what was your plan for SDI?
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:25.880]  Well, the point was, is to negotiate, which I did with the Soviet government, before
[1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:35.920]  a new head was put in. And with those people, we'd had this extensive discussion for several
[1:15:35.920 --> 1:15:41.940]  years. And in this discussion, we outlined what the problems were, the danger of a nuclear
[1:15:41.940 --> 1:15:50.720]  war fought through the atmosphere and through space, and how much better it would be to resolve
[1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:56.080]  our problems step by step, first of all, to realize that we cannot have a thermonuclear
[1:15:56.080 --> 1:16:00.840]  war. Therefore, the idea, and you cannot have a war that would not be thermonuclear among
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:07.480]  major nations. Therefore, we had to find an agreement on the most upper ending. And there
[1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:12.680]  was a lot of agreement. That's why we had the German, French, Italian, general officers
[1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:17.360]  and people like that in high ranking positions, as well as in the United States, who agreed
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:23.440]  to this. But then, as you know, the certain forces in the United States, including the
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:28.720]  politicians, killed it, because they used all this alarmist nonsense. And then, of course,
[1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:33.560]  the head of the Soviet Union would come in then, was a real problem. He was a British
[1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:39.840]  asset ascension. And Gorbachev, his successful real successor, was a mess, as Phil is for
[1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:46.840]  the present day. So these, we lost the fight. And then people like George H. W. Bush, he
[1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:51.280]  got pretty much a slob. I wouldn't want to give too much credit for him for intellect.
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:57.160]  He's all whimpering, whining, all George. And it's not as in any manner. So they moved
[1:16:57.160 --> 1:17:02.600]  in a different direction. And it was decided to get rid of me. It was actually an assassination
[1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:10.320]  plot was set up through the Department of Justice. The President's circles, then Reagan,
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:16.120]  killed that. They kept at it. And they went to frame me up and get me in prison. They've
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:21.480]  tried to find a court they could do it in. And they'd got it. Then after about five
[1:17:21.480 --> 1:17:26.280]  years of that incarceration, I came back out and did the same old thing I always did.
[1:17:26.280 --> 1:17:32.120]  And I'm still doing it today. I'm in a great time, building a youth movement, which is
[1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:38.320]  science-oriented and classical culture-oriented. And we're doing a good job. We're the limit
[1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:43.760]  number of people. And I think we have the seeds of a good future coming out of that
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:49.560]  process now. There's a demand for it throughout the world. I think we can do it.
[1:17:49.560 --> 1:17:50.560]  All right.
[1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:51.560]  I'm a decent President.
[1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:56.560]  Well, very, very interesting. Is the best website for folks to visit? LaRouchePub.com?
[1:17:56.560 --> 1:18:04.000]  Because I know you have several.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.240]  What is the best website for folks to visit?
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:12.600]  Well, I think we're running the best right now because we do have, we're not that
[1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:20.080]  prolific. We produce about three to four products a day, which are broadcasts and webcasts,
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:26.040]  as they say. It's the best, it's some of the best scientific work done today because
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:32.280]  one of our big functions is we have a science group, which is a factor in science in the
[1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:40.160]  world today. This is what we work from largely. We also specialize on music because my understanding
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:47.520]  is that the ability to perform physical science is typified by cases like Max Planck and Einstein,
[1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:53.440]  that all the great scientists, or most of them, were involved as classical musicians,
[1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:58.440]  some with a professional quality, like Einstein or Planck, the classical musicians. And so
[1:18:58.440 --> 1:19:05.440]  this idea of a classical culture as the foundation for physical science and its progress is the
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:10.880]  concept we work from. Therefore, we do tend to recruit people as recruits who have some
[1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:15.800]  scientific background. And we have a team that's made some very important discoveries
[1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:18.000]  in other roles in this pre-field.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.360]  All right, Alen and LaRouche, we've got to go to break. When we come back, we'll get
[1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:28.000]  into the hardcore issues here today, the imminent collapse of the Euro, what that means, what
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:33.440]  the Anglo-American establishment's goal is, what they would do if they're unopposed, what
[1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:38.120]  you believe is going to happen in your forecasting, it's all coming up with Alen and LaRouche
[1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:46.400]  straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv. Stay with us. And then
[1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:51.920]  economist George Humphrey will be joining us in studio coming up today as well to talk
[1:19:51.920 --> 1:20:00.120]  about a host of issues. Not just the economy, stay with us. We'll be right back.
[1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:05.000]  Since 2007, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government have injected as much as 20 trillion
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:10.280]  dollars into the economies of the world. And yet the globe's economies continue to contract.
[1:20:10.280 --> 1:20:16.260]  Our government is borrowing $58,000 per second. If they stop spending, the economy collapses.
[1:20:16.260 --> 1:20:21.360]  If they continue spending, the economy collapses. And if they raise interest rates, the economy
[1:20:21.360 --> 1:20:23.840]  collapses. Prepare now.

[1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:03.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:08.040]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:22:08.040 --> 1:22:12.320]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:17.400]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:22.040]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[1:22:22.040 --> 1:22:27.680]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:36.660]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[1:22:36.660 --> 1:22:40.880]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[1:22:40.880 --> 1:22:44.920]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can

[1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:11.520]  Some people will say, hey, why are you interviewing Lyndon LaRouche? Well, hey, I've actually done
[1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:15.320]  15, 16 years of research and got a lot of good information out of it. I don't totally
[1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:21.840]  agree with everything. But that's what free and open debate in society is about, is looking
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:28.320]  at all perspectives. And that's why reading from the Washington Post, January 15, 2006,
[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:33.520]  some officials find intelligence network useful. Norman Maley, former National Security Council
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:37.640]  advisor, recalls, that's the real government, that soon after he joined the National Security
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:42.600]  Council, he received a call from NSC officials asking him to talk to a group of followers
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:46.560]  of right wing presidential candidate. Notice they call him right wing and then they call
[1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:52.040]  him left wing. LaRouche, he was offering intelligence information to the agency. Maley said the
[1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:56.880]  NSC senior director of international economic affairs said he found the visitor's intelligence
[1:24:56.880 --> 1:25:02.560]  on economics and foreign affairs surprisingly on target. And then the Washington Post goes
[1:25:02.560 --> 1:25:05.760]  through this whole saga and it was really going on before that. So I just want new
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:12.000]  listeners to understand that this guy, well, I mean, just if you read the whole history,
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:16.680]  it's amazing. Lyndon, this is a short segment, big long 18 minute one coming up, but you've
[1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:21.360]  got the floor. Where are we right now economically in the world? They're having to more and more
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:26.640]  admit we're really in a depression. What is the banking cartel based in London and New
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:31.160]  York? What is their goal? What's happening to the euro? What's happening in Greece?
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:35.360]  What's coming here? Well, there's a long term trend which is centered
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:42.800]  on certain people in the United Kingdom, which is the desire to reduce the human population
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:53.360]  to some people say two billion people, some say one. And recently, the one is preferred.
[1:25:53.360 --> 1:26:00.240]  The policy of the so-called green revolution people, there's the anti technology people
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:05.760]  is precisely that. And for example, the worst case right now happens to be in Germany, where
[1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:14.320]  the green change is heading. And it means a disaster for the total population of Germany.
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:20.160]  It's a weaker in France, where they do have a dependency upon nuclear power. Italy does
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:24.360]  not yet have nuclear power. They once did, but let's take it away from them. So we're
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:32.600]  in that kind of situation. But the worst of it is that at this point, with this president,
[1:26:32.600 --> 1:26:39.200]  who is nothing but a British puppet, there's no exaggeration whatsoever. One knows his
[1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:43.720]  affinities for the British royal family and for their policy.
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:49.560]  We've never seen such groveling by a president. Pardon me? We've never seen presidents groveling
[1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:56.880]  like this, bowing down to Queenie. They created him. How do you think all the money was cooked
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:05.800]  up under very suspicious circumstances to overwhelm the presidential campaign with him, with money
[1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:12.240]  behind it? And my view is some of the people using this money should have gone to prison.
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:17.360]  Because the tactics were being used by spreading a fund, which is coming largely from drug
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:23.400]  money and similar kinds of sources, and splitting it up into little pieces, and then putting
[1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:31.160]  the pieces into the campaign of the presidential candidate. They overwhelmed with sheer money,
[1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:37.160]  overwhelmed the legitimate campaign, which was being run for the president. Now, on the
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:42.960]  basis of his debt to the British, who put him in the office inside the United States
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:50.480]  with his flood of money, he now actually has got control over the presidency. There are
[1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:56.920]  people in the United States, particularly older people who are less political and more,
[1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:03.840]  shall we say, institutional, who understand this. And we are prepared to dump this bum
[1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:10.680]  from office. Now we have the perfect grounds for doing so. We had a ground out of the 25th
[1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:15.360]  Amendment on him earlier. It should have been exercised. It was not. Now we've caught
[1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:22.720]  him in an outrage, outrage of an impeachable offense against the United States in a fraudulent
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:29.160]  policy on warfare in Libya. We have him there. There are some weaklings in the United States
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:35.360]  who are afraid to close in on this guy. But I know if he is not thrown out of office very
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:43.320]  soon, and I mean in the weeks immediately ahead, this United States cannot survive the kinds
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:49.080]  of conditions which we're going into in the month of July. It doesn't mean we're going
[1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:53.560]  to collapse in July, but it means we're going through a process which will collapse somewhere
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:58.920]  along with the summertime. We're already seeing bizarre flash mobs and riots popping up all
[1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:05.320]  over the United States right now. That's there. Well, you have two of them. One has like Twitter
[1:29:05.320 --> 1:29:13.120]  – Twitter operates a riot-creating operation, doing just what it's normal operations. But
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:19.600]  behind what Twitter does as just an organization, Twitter as an organization is control, control
[1:29:19.600 --> 1:29:25.880]  from the top. And you have a generation of youths who have a very poor orientation in
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:28.680]  life. It wasn't their fault. It was given to them.
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:32.720]  Mr. LaRouche, stay there. Long segment coming up. I want you to get into the Euro. What
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:37.120]  the Anglo-American Establishment goal is, your idea is to fix it. I'm going to just
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:40.840]  give you the floor for 18 minutes when we come back. I'll have a few questions I throw
[1:29:40.840 --> 1:29:45.600]  in, but I want you to really finish up with Twitter and then flesh out to understand it.
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:49.560]  What is the Anglo-American goal so we know what's coming ahead and what are these going
[1:29:49.560 --> 1:30:11.560]  to happen?
[1:30:11.560 --> 1:30:37.920]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:58.320]  in the world.
[1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:07.280]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[1:31:07.280 --> 1:31:12.000]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:21.560]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride
[1:31:21.560 --> 1:31:30.840]  in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the
[1:31:30.840 --> 1:31:38.960]  crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.
[1:31:38.960 --> 1:31:44.840]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled
[1:31:44.840 --> 1:31:50.000]  quality. Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:56.440]  you can ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans
[1:31:56.440 --> 1:31:59.480]  got it, others don't.
[1:31:59.480 --> 1:32:04.120]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:32:04.120 --> 1:32:08.440]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:32:08.440 --> 1:32:12.760]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:17.840]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:22.520]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[1:32:22.520 --> 1:32:28.160]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:32.480]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:37.140]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[1:32:37.140 --> 1:32:41.360]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[1:32:41.360 --> 1:32:45.440]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can

[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:25.960]  Well, he's predicted much of what is now unfolding with great precision. Lenin LaRouche
[1:33:25.960 --> 1:33:31.080]  is our guest. We're going back to him in just one moment. Their websites are larouchepob.com
[1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:38.040]  and larouchepac.com is really a nice website, very high-tech. I like to look at it, but
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:42.680]  also the information. So check out larouchepac.com as well. Before we go back to Lenin LaRouche,
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:46.600]  to really get into the nitty gritty of where the economy is, what these people's in-game
[1:33:46.600 --> 1:33:51.600]  plan is. We don't defeat them. He already went there a bit with the world population
[1:33:51.600 --> 1:33:55.640]  reduction agenda. I mean, it's on record. I know it's frightening and sounds crazy,
[1:33:55.640 --> 1:34:00.240]  but as you know, as listeners here, we cover the White House Science czar and Henry Kissinger
[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:03.840]  and Ted Turner and Prince Philip. I mean, they say they're building a world government
[1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:10.840]  to shut off our resources and kill us. I mean, the one-child policy of China is theirs. China
[1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:16.840]  was paid to do that. So that's all coming up, but I want to remind you this special ends

[1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:36.600]  all of this, where is the world right now? What is happening with the economy? What's
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:40.880]  going on with the euro? What's happening with Greece? What's happening with all the war
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:45.560]  clouds gathering? Where do you see the world right now?
[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:53.800]  Well, first of all, we're headed toward a general collapse throughout the transatlantic
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:36:00.000]  region. It's centered, of course, in Europe and centered in the United States, but it's
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:06.480]  extended throughout the Americas. It's extended into Africa and through parts of Asia. This
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:11.560]  is the area that's in trouble. Right now, it's coming down. One problem is you have
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:16.800]  Europe that has come down to Europe, which is part of a system called the euro system
[1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:22.080]  with its own currency or euro currency. It's always this form of globalization in which
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:27.720]  the nations are losing their sovereignty at a rapid rate in order to become a members
[1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:34.480]  or blob of an assortment of nations. This thing is now in the process of coming down.
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:40.400]  The breakdown of the process was established in New York City by a gentleman called Strauss
[1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:47.080]  Kahn, who was at that point the head of the IMF, the International Monetary Fund. He
[1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:54.200]  was caught in the attack, which was considered rape of a woman. For that, he was picked up
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:36:59.560]  at the plain side before he could board the plane to France. He then went some time in
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:05.320]  Rikers Island, the famous prison in the York City area, and he's now sitting on the roll
[1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:13.960]  with a little special detachment to his shoe. There he sits, awaiting trial, which would
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:21.160]  be in some duration. The significance of this is that Strauss Kahn's elimination from the
[1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:29.360]  operation killed the bailout operation, which had been intended. The effect of the inability
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:37.800]  of that crowd to get a bailout going again resulted in a deterioration because what you're
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:43.080]  getting is a bunch of money, which is not money. You're getting electronic money, not
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:49.840]  even electronic, electronic fake money, which is out there, which is a bailout. This stuff
[1:37:49.840 --> 1:37:57.000]  has no redeemable value except to collect debts from victims, including countries that
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:03.040]  have victims, including the United States. We are being looted as a nation, and as our
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:07.640]  people are being looted, our industries are being looted. Our states, the four states
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:12.400]  of Berkeley and the state of bankruptcy now, because they can't meet the debt requirements
[1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:19.080]  to bail themselves out at the end of the fiscal year. Other parts of the nation are being
[1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:25.160]  crushed by an accelerating rate. For example, our military is on a threat right now. The
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:31.480]  military of the United States is going to be slashed massively if something is not done
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:37.000]  about it. That's going to leave us in a very strange degree of vulnerability, not because
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:42.880]  of foreign wars as such, but simply because our military is one of the final institutions
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:48.960]  which is still more or less functioning. Every one of our institutions is crumbling. If we
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:55.240]  do not get this bum out of office now, and the grounds existed under the 25th Amendment
[1:38:55.240 --> 1:39:02.360]  for some time, the grounds now are, of course, his violation of the War Powers Act, for which
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:07.760]  he should be thrown out of office as a crime against the nation, with whatever penalties
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:12.800]  apart from being thrown out of office, go with that. But he's not. And as long as this
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:19.680]  bum, with these practices as president, remains in office, he will continue to do everything
[1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:25.320]  to destroy the United States. If we don't get him out, you could kiss the United States
[1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:32.040]  goodbye when you're still able to kiss. That's where it stands. Now, there are many options.
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:37.560]  We have wonderful options in the United States if we chose to use them. We could rebuild
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:45.480]  our entire central water system in the United States. We could create industry and create
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:51.640]  agriculture where it does not exist or where it's being destroyed. The destruction of agriculture
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:57.360]  by the storms which have hit during the recent period have destroyed the food supply of the
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:02.480]  United States to a critical degree in the immediate period ahead. And there are no plans
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:07.720]  to restore it. The farmers of bankrupt, they have no credit available to meet the crimes.
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:13.400]  They couldn't go with something now. The whole region of the Mississippi River, the Ohio
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:19.240]  Basin, the Missouri Basin, the food supply is being destroyed.
[1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:25.440]  Again, we're talking live to Lyndon LaRouche. You really need to know introduction of larouchepac.com
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:31.400]  and larouchepub.com. Lyndon, 20 years ago, you said NAFTA globalism would do this to
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:40.120]  us that was part of this deindustrialized program. But what is the British model of this corporate
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:46.000]  and perium going to do when it's built up China and Russia and others are still standing
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:54.480]  and when their main command base, their main titan, the United States, is accelerating its
[1:40:54.480 --> 1:41:02.000]  destabilitation? I mean, what is the method to that madness? And A, and then B, you have
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:07.120]  a report out dealing with Obama in violation of the War Powers Act. Why are they becoming
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:13.760]  so arrogant in his speech yesterday saying, I don't even need to discuss the Constitution
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:16.760]  anymore? I mean, what is he getting us ready for?
[1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:21.880]  Well, what you have to remember, our system of government was unique. Everyone found it.
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:29.400]  It was at the time we had won the Revolutionary War, we had a great problem of debt, the debt
[1:41:29.400 --> 1:41:35.800]  of what became the respective states of that period. There was apparently no solution because
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:43.800]  each of these states of the United States was vulnerable to this debt and danger of
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:47.720]  going into bankruptcy and the British were just waiting to move back in and take us back
[1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:52.320]  over to that method. Alexander Hamilton, who was a protege really
[1:41:52.320 --> 1:41:58.000]  advantageous and frightened, introduced the reform which established our republic on
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:03.800]  the constitutional system rather than a collection of states. In other words, we departed the
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:11.760]  European standard of states, maybe a centralized form of government with a central government
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:17.680]  and went to a system which is based on a system of national credit. This was the basis
[1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:25.200]  of which the Constitution was written. Therefore, our system, in contrast to the European monetary
[1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:32.400]  systems, our system is in its horary, by virtue of our Constitution, a credit system, not
[1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:37.440]  a monetary system. Now, when Eruy Rosell, of course, put us back
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:44.560]  on the credit system in his presidency, it was undermined and then in 1999 it was destroyed
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:50.720]  by the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had been the bulwark of our entire recovery
[1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:57.400]  during the 1930s and thereafter. So, that destruction in 1999 of the Glass-Steagall
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:05.240]  Act opened the gates for a complete takeover by the British international monetary interests.
[1:43:05.240 --> 1:43:12.800]  That today is our problem. Now, we can get out of this mess. All we have to do is re-enact
[1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:19.560]  the original Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which was functioning more or less up until about
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:27.040]  1999. Once that's done, then all the foley money, the Mall Street money and the British
[1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:34.720]  money goes into a different department of banking. It's not a part of the federal debt. It's
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:41.440]  a part of the market for speculative investment, the Wall Street market. Therefore, once we
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:49.960]  cast Glass-Steagall, if we do it, and there's a strong movement for that now, if we do that,
[1:43:49.960 --> 1:43:57.840]  then we are able to get rid of several or tens of trillions of dollars of foley debt,
[1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:04.080]  which the nation is now carrying, which is ruining our states, destroying our population.
[1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:10.520]  We can reverse that process. Obama is the advocate of the British interest. He's a tool
[1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:16.800]  for the British. They own him. They control his mind. He's just an agent who was bought,
[1:44:16.800 --> 1:44:23.240]  whose presidency was bought by a vast influx of drug money and other corrupt currency.
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:28.800]  But for this drug money flood, which brought Obama into the presidency, he would not have
[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:34.520]  been president. And that's the situation. So now we're at the point where the policies
[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:39.840]  of Obama are the enemy of the United States, the enemy of our existence. We're not talking
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:45.280]  about a long term enemy. We're talking about a sharp term enemy. We can be destroyed irreparably
[1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:47.000]  within a few weeks of that.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:53.200]  Explain the technicals of that because the collapse by design, I mean, they're on record
[1:44:53.200 --> 1:45:01.560]  engineering it to absorb. Greece, Ireland, Iceland is resisted. They now admit it is
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:08.000]  inevitable into Italy, Portugal. I mean, can you lay out the technicals of how you're
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:14.480]  saying in a few weeks this could accelerate, break down that chain of events?
[1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:21.920]  The point is, if you acknowledge, if you try to collect what the British essentially control,
[1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:27.880]  which is a worthless debt, the mass of many trillions of dollars and more, there are actually
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:37.040]  quadrillions of phoning value out there clamoring for being fed. All we have to do is pass glass
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:43.000]  table again now with the understanding of what we've been through. If we do that, these
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:47.600]  guys will go bankrupt. They're fainfully claims against the United States.
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:51.760]  Because that will further implode the current Ponzi scheme they've got and to quantify it,
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:56.640]  correct me if I'm wrong, they've created 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives. They bought off
[1:45:56.640 --> 1:46:01.400]  our governments to buy into the debt and it's a black hole if we don't pull out of it, there's
[1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:02.400]  no hope.
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:08.200]  Exactly. The point is, the debt we have is not legitimate debt of our government under
[1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:13.600]  our constitution. Therefore, that debt would go back to Wall Street and Wall Street would
[1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:18.760]  have to find its own resources to pay the debt, the phony debt that it created.
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:25.000]  Okay, what do we do when they hold this hostage as they openly do and implode the stock market?
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:28.960]  Do we then just arrest them for financial terrorism because they're on record in Europe
[1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:35.800]  and the US threatening to implode things if they can't hold us hostage? So what's the
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:43.320]  process there? Because it is truly us or them and they are the fraudsters. But any governor
[1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:48.400]  that goes after him, any grand jury, any congressperson, as you know, they get busted for something
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:53.880]  or their plane blows up. So how do you stop them?
[1:46:53.880 --> 1:47:01.840]  Very simply, Glass-Steagall. If we reenact the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which was canceled
[1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:09.200]  in 1999, if we do that, we are immediately in a new situation in which the only currency,
[1:47:09.200 --> 1:47:15.720]  the only credit system operating is the United States government's treasury system. We then
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:23.920]  have to use the power of the treasury under those conditions to utter credit, not money,
[1:47:23.920 --> 1:47:28.880]  credit. We give credit to the projects which we think are worth the public investment in
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:35.160]  them. We support private industries and so forth, which are going to do this. Like agriculture.
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:40.920]  We have a crisis in agriculture in the United States. We have a food supply which is insufficient
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:46.760]  for our total population right now. We can get that back if we put the investment back
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:55.160]  into the Mississippi, the Iowa and the Missouri River areas alone. These areas will give us
[1:47:55.160 --> 1:48:01.240]  a growth in food supply. We have major projects, infrastructure projects, not what they call
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:06.560]  infrastructure, but real ones, like Nalapa. We can change the character and improve the
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:12.800]  character qualitatively, simply by using public credit to loan it in the places where it will
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:19.480]  do the most good, from a strategic standpoint. For example, take the state of California.
[1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:25.680]  The state of California is dying under these conditions. We can rescue it. We have other
[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:31.200]  states, three other states that are dying right now under the terms of the present
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:32.200]  conditions.
[1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:36.960]  The banksters want, because when we have the IMF World Bank documents, when their policies
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:41.240]  implode things further, they come in and buy things up for pennies on the dollar, then
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:46.760]  they implode it more, more, more. That's why they buy into the Malthusian view and the
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:52.720]  social Darwinistic view that their psychopathic activity is a favor for humanity. Of course,
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:49:01.680]  they adopt these bankrupt game theory philosophies and RAM corporation ideas, because it feeds
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:07.760]  in as a rationale for what they're doing, but at the end of the day, they're destroying
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:14.320]  the very civilization that they fed off of. They're actually in danger of killing their
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:20.360]  host. If they are successful, in the end, won't they destroy their own system as well,
[1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:23.480]  but their predator instinct can't be stopped?
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:28.120]  This is all intentional. The intention is to reduce the world population from over 7
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:35.280]  billion people to one in the shortest possible time. If you understand that, then you know
[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:41.000]  what's going on. If you don't understand that, you really don't know what's going on.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:47.120]  The point is, you're looking at a whole system, and the system was born with the founding
[1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:51.800]  of the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire, the original one, collapsed, but then it was revived
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:58.240]  as Byzantium. That collapsed. It was revived as a crusader system. That collapsed, and
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:04.400]  then after a whole series of wars in Europe, it was established as a new empire with William
[1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:10.600]  of Orange, who carried the flag of the new Venetian party from the Netherlands into
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:19.680]  England and Ireland and did a lot of killing, but his outcome of his actions with the 70
[1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:27.280]  years' war, which concluded in 1763, established the British kingdom as an imperial power on
[1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:33.760]  the plight, including his control of India, his control over what? Nova Scotia, Canada,
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:37.800]  and so forth. So this was the fight we used in the other side.
[1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:40.680]  Stay there, stay there, William of Orange. Let's come back and finish up with that key
[1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:47.920]  area on the other side. Please continue. So basically, we're seen as weevils that have
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:53.440]  invaded their grain bags, and we need to be exterminated, and that's what they all write.
[1:50:53.440 --> 1:50:58.360]  They all say that's their philosophy, their religion, their driving system, and it's
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:51:02.760]  admitted. What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:07.680]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your
[1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:12.160]  money? Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed Zero Debt 100.com, a program

[1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:08.480]  Landon LaRouche is with us for this five-minute segment and a one-minute break, a little five
[1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:12.720]  minutes we do at the start of the hour, then George Humphrey in studio with us, economist,
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:16.960]  former Austin City Council member, successful businessman, good friend of mine, author,
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:21.080]  filmmaker, he's going to be in studio with us to cover a host of issues and towards the
[1:54:21.080 --> 1:54:24.040]  end of the hour, I promise we'll also open the phones up if you have any questions for
[1:54:24.040 --> 1:54:30.000]  me. Landon LaRouche is our guest joining us via video Skype from Germany. You were getting
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:38.720]  into their plan for world population reduction. I mean, look at California, going into the
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:43.840]  total implosion, 30-plus percent unemployment, even 60 minutes in an analysis that admitted
[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:51.160]  that last year. Their answer is ram through a 20-plus percent carbon tax on California.
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:57.320]  I mean, if that isn't proof of the economic genocide, what is Landon LaRouche?
[1:54:57.320 --> 1:55:04.760]  Well, that's what you're getting. You're getting that. There is real genocide and it's intentional
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:09.920]  that the Obama administration is an instrument of that policy of genocide. If you look at
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:15.080]  the policies which are uttered by the Obama administration itself, which is apart from
[1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:21.640]  many other sources inside the United States, you find that only Obama and what he represents
[1:55:21.640 --> 1:55:28.040]  and his immediate cronies are the people who are behind in the health care in other fields
[1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:37.000]  to increase the killing rate of what is considered an excessively large U.S. population. So we're
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:43.280]  not involved in a political quarrel. We're involved in an existential issue. Are we going
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:50.120]  to be human or are we going to be cannibals? That's where we are. If you go with Obama,
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:53.960]  you're for the cannibal class. And that's what we're headed for.
[1:55:53.960 --> 1:55:57.920]  Is that why they put him in? Because he's black and they thought that would give him
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:03.200]  political cover? Because it's admitted that the carbon taxes proposed at Copenhagen would
[1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:08.680]  kill at least a billion people if they were implemented within five years. And that was
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:12.600]  just the first rollout. And they told the Third World, hey, go for this. We're going
[1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:16.680]  to tax the West. Give it to you. Then they got the treaty and it was right at double
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:22.000]  the taxes that the West would pay on people making less than $2 a day. It was a death
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  sentence.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  I know. I know.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:30.720]  I know you know. But I mean, how do we stop these people? They're madmen.
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:36.400]  They are criminals. And we have to understand that. We have to establish our government
[1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:44.520]  again, free of the Obama syndrome. And also the George W. Bush Jr., which is almost as
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:46.720]  bad, not quite as bad as Obama.
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:50.560]  What is your view of the political field right now in the United States?
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:52.560]  Bobby.
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:55.920]  What is your view of the political candidates?
[1:56:55.920 --> 1:57:02.880]  I think what we have now is we have among some senators and among members of the House
[1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:08.360]  of Representatives. And in terms of the leading institutions of the gubernatorial system,
[1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:13.120]  has a lot of good people in it. We have the ability, and we're pushing for the Glass
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:17.240]  League of the United States. And it's a very serious and it's a growing movement right
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:23.000]  now. We're moving to reinstall Glass League. That'll change the whole game. We in the United
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:29.760]  States, with our government as long as we control it, has a capacity to create credit.
[1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:32.560]  We can put the United States back to work.
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:37.480]  So it's policy. They could turn this around anytime they wanted to, but they don't want
[1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:38.480]  that to happen.
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:41.560]  What happens if we don't? I mean, couldn't we impeach Obama? There's more than one way
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:47.180]  to skin a cat. I mean, couldn't we go after Obama for the war powers issue? I mean, Ron
[1:57:47.180 --> 1:57:51.240]  Paul was on this two days ago. He said it's absolutely impeachable.
[1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:55.840]  He's impeachable on that ground. He's impeachable because he's insane also. And he couldn't
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:00.760]  be what he is if he weren't insane. This man is a mental case of a certain type.
[1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:05.200]  He thinks we have 57 states. He doesn't even know the ages of his daughters now. There's
[1:58:05.200 --> 1:58:10.200]  news today asking if Obama was starting to have mental problems.
[1:58:10.200 --> 1:58:19.000]  He's crazy, but he's like the famous Nero, Emperor Nero. He's got the same syndrome of
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:25.840]  the Emperor Nero in psychological. But the point is he's used as a tool by the British
[1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:31.320]  monarchy personally. That is, he is not an agent of some conspiracy. He's an agent of
[1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:34.320]  one conspiracy and the agent of the British monarchy.
[1:58:34.320 --> 1:58:41.760]  All right, we're back in one minute. Let's all lose our gas. Stay with us.

[2:00:27.800 --> 2:00:31.720]  We've only got five minutes left with him. I really appreciate him joining us from Germany.
[2:00:31.720 --> 2:00:35.040]  You can't wait till he gets back to the United States. He has a really good studio and better
[2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:39.880]  audio there. Lyndon LaRouche is our guest and everything he's saying is accurate from the
[2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:45.040]  Globalistown Statements, the Anglo-American Establishment, what their goal is, and things
[2:00:45.040 --> 2:00:50.160]  are accelerating very, very quickly. Lyndon LaRouche, I'm concerned about false flag
[2:00:50.160 --> 2:00:56.760]  terror because they've got reports out today. Kurt Nemo's got one at Infowars.com. Napolitano
[2:00:56.760 --> 2:01:02.480]  warns Europeans that Gaddafi's giving weapons to Al Qaeda. They're about to strike. They've
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:07.760]  got the Federal Goon Force TSA now going on the streets. And I see them needing a political
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:15.000]  diversion ahead of the economic calamities that are accelerating to stage some events
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:19.800]  and then claim that foreigners did it as a pretext to take liberty and to legitimize
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:27.760]  all these new wars. What are, from your research, some of the tricks that the ruling class may
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:32.600]  use to try to block the people from removing them from power?
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:37.880]  Well, let's take the case of 9-11 as a good example of exactly how this whole system works
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:44.200]  still today, including that kind of problem you referred to. What happened was is that
[2:01:44.200 --> 2:01:52.240]  the British system, to a certain branch of its operations, together with the Saudi Kingdom,
[2:01:52.240 --> 2:01:59.320]  set up an operation, a secret operation, which they would take oil prices in the Gulf, at
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:08.800]  the Gulf prices, then move it up to the coast of Europe, northern, and then they would sell
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:15.080]  it on the market at a European price, which is much above the Saudi price. They would,
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:23.280]  however, list the oil delivered at the Saudi Gulf price. This created a vast fund, the largest
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:29.160]  available fund, for dirty operations, military and others, which existed in the world at
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:37.560]  that time. This funding was used for what was called 9-11, and the whole operation was
[2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:43.560]  based on this, the 9-11 operation. Now, this was well known. The evidence of the direct
[2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:50.260]  relationship of the Saudi ambassador to Washington and his involvement in recruiting and backing
[2:02:50.260 --> 2:02:56.840]  and funding some of the pilots who actually flew those planes was conclusive evidence,
[2:02:56.840 --> 2:03:03.640]  which was buried under the pressure of then the Bush administration. But that is the truth.
[2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:09.280]  The truth was never told publicly, though many of us knew it. The evidence existed,
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:14.640]  we knew it, other people knew it, but it was never presented in the press. Even the people
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:20.840]  who were on the commission who were investigating precisely this line of investigation were
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:26.880]  pressed not to open them out. The same was practically a natural secret, but it was the
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:35.120]  alliance of the Saudi Kingdom and this faction inside the British system, which funded, directed,
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:41.400]  and created the 9-11 incident. And that's a fact we have to remember. We're in this
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:49.320]  kind of mess because the Bush administration obtained dictatorial powers over the presidency
[2:03:49.320 --> 2:03:56.200]  and over the Congress through the terror caused by this event. And that's the thing that's
[2:03:56.200 --> 2:04:03.360]  still harassing us today. And we should get the record clear. Now, the key thing here
[2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:10.480]  is, we have a bunch of congressmen, good ones, they're normal members of Congress, but to
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:16.120]  the extent that they're fragmented and are not working together on a common cause, they
[2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:20.880]  are not effective in dealing with a president who is rotten and an enemy of the United States.
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:25.000]  Well, Mr. LaRouge, we would love to have you up if you can do it again. And he says it's
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:30.920]  a critical time the next few weeks to continue. We are just flat out of time, but bottom line,
[2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:39.920]  you're saying 9-11 is a type of inside job? Yeah, it was a total inside job and involved
[2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:45.920]  Bush all over the place. Remember, the whole family was there in Texas at the time that
[2:04:45.920 --> 2:04:50.160]  Ben Laden was functioning up in New York. Mr. LaRouge, let me, I'm going to get George
[2:04:50.160 --> 2:04:53.280]  Humphrey in here, but let me do two minutes with you on the other side. Can you do that?
[2:04:53.280 --> 2:04:58.440]  Barney? Two minutes. I do two more minutes with us on the other side, okay? I'm going
[2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:03.520]  to come back and finish up, but this is too big. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[2:05:03.520 --> 2:05:09.160]  in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing
[2:05:09.160 --> 2:05:14.080]  off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've
[2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:19.160]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:25.400]  shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For
[2:05:25.400 --> 2:05:30.600]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel, hell
[2:05:30.600 --> 2:05:36.000]  bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying,
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:44.920]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[2:05:44.920 --> 2:05:51.840]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[2:08:00.720 --> 2:08:06.160]  This communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[2:08:06.160 --> 2:08:08.800]  a war on for your mind.
[2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:22.680]  All right, we're going to let Len LaRouche go but he's been gracious enough to stay with
[2:08:22.680 --> 2:08:31.040]  us. LaRouchePAC.com, LaRouchePUB.com, both very interesting and informative websites,
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:35.600]  talking about the global plan for world government population reduction, the British Empire through
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:41.640]  the corporate system, corporate topocracy, the kleptocracy. But sir, you were talking
[2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:47.800]  about 9-11 being a total inside job and so you're saying you are concerned in the geopolitical
[2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:54.720]  calculation that they may stage new events as their flagging system goes forward. Can
[2:08:54.720 --> 2:08:59.040]  you finish with that and then your statement that you got cut off making about we've got
[2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:01.120]  good Congress people but?
[2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:08.760]  Well, the Glass-Steagall Act will unite enough members of Congress to create a force which
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:16.560]  will be able to face up to the threat of the Obama administration. If we stop, succeed,
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:21.560]  and pushing the Glass-Steagall Act through at least one house of the Congress, we will
[2:09:21.560 --> 2:09:27.720]  then have crippled the Obama dictatorship and that will lead to the elimination of him
[2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:33.200]  from the presidency. Under those conditions, Asian American people, thinking they've got
[2:09:33.200 --> 2:09:40.080]  that nation back after all these years, will be able to mobilize themselves as an organized
[2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:46.280]  force and take the measures needed to save our nation. We can do it. We need a sense
[2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:51.560]  of the courage and unity among enough of our people to unite around the Congress, around
[2:09:51.560 --> 2:09:57.520]  the right people of the Congress to, as a force of government, get our country back.
[2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:02.760]  Now, if we don't do it, we're going to lose it. So now we've got to mobilize by the best
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:04.560]  political choice of a strategy.
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:11.600]  But do you agree with me, sir, that the stage terror attack is one of the dangerous cards
[2:10:11.600 --> 2:10:16.520]  up the sleeve? Because remember the thing I see engaging the preparatory brainwashing
[2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:20.200]  where they're saying terrorists are about to hit. When they hit, give your rights up,
[2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:26.080]  where your protectors, wars are good, police state is good. I see them prepping the public
[2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:32.160]  mind, the gal lighting, preparing the ground for new stage terror. Do you have any comments?
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:40.320]  It's actually correct. If we restore a sense of unity among a majority of members of the
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:47.640]  U.S. Congress, I guarantee you we can win this fight and win it in short order. That's
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:49.640]  what we have to do.
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:55.880]  But we're getting close to a point where it's going to get, I mean, if things don't change
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:11:04.120]  in the next few months and I'm trying, I'm out there to organize this process. We need
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:08.520]  it. I'm an old man, I shouldn't be president, but I'm too old even to consider the job.
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:14.680]  But I'm prepared to commit myself fully to this objective as a lifelong objective.
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:19.440]  Lenin LaRouche, thank you so much for spending so much time with us. We're very, very thankful
[2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:23.240]  for your insight and your perspective.
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:24.240]  Thank you.
[2:11:24.240 --> 2:11:28.200]  All right, there goes Lenin LaRouche from Deutschland. We are now joined. The rest of
[2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:31.400]  the hour, maybe a little bit into the next, it'll be internet only then, here on this
[2:11:31.400 --> 2:11:36.280]  Thursday Addention, but the next 50 minutes live on the radio to all the MNFM affiliates,
[2:11:36.280 --> 2:11:41.560]  Global Shortwave Satellite XM, George Humphrey, a good friend of mine now going back more
[2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:47.680]  than 16, 17, 18 years. I think I met him when, with Pat Buchanan's campaign before I even
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:52.360]  got on access TV 16 years ago and then radio, but George Humphrey served two terms as a
[2:11:52.360 --> 2:12:00.160]  member of the Austin City Council, place four. He helped co-found the Austin citizens for
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:07.640]  economical energy. He, of course, has written books and made the films and is just a great
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:13.280]  guy fighting the new world order, you know, outside the normal political box. He is just
[2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:17.920]  a guy who absolutely love and so much is happening. So much is going on, George. I got a lot of
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:22.360]  questions I want to cover with you, you know, the wars, the police state, but something
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:25.960]  when you, when you dropped by the office the other day, because a lot of time you're outside
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:29.560]  the country, you're also a successful businessman. You know, I mean, you're a true Globetrotter.
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:37.280]  You brought up the psychological warfare of the rap stars, the Lady Gaga, the movies,
[2:12:37.280 --> 2:12:42.000]  where vampires and killers and serial killers aren't bad guys. It's sexy. They have shows
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:47.840]  where serial killers are the hero. I mean, they are trying to psychically wound us, aren't
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:52.920]  they? And so that was the big topic you wanted to talk about is why they're doing that, you
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:58.600]  know, trying to really introduce this negative vibe, this negative energy, this defeatist
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:04.120]  systems we accept and all the TV shows about the end of man, the world after humans, how
[2:13:04.120 --> 2:13:09.280]  wonderful it'll be, how ugly we are. They want us to think that, that we're weak and
[2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:13.600]  bad because they know the opposite because we're coming to this critical juncture. Talk
[2:13:13.600 --> 2:13:16.960]  about that for the rest of this segment. They don't want to get into a whole bunch of issues
[2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:21.160]  and take phone calls. Absolutely, Alex. But first of all, I want to say thank you very
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:27.840]  much because so many of the issues that you talk about are so basic and fundamental and
[2:13:27.840 --> 2:13:33.120]  they're pretty dad gum scary from one point of view. And I remember when I first started
[2:13:33.120 --> 2:13:37.600]  getting into this stuff about 20 years ago, I was getting ready, I was thinking I was
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:42.920]  going to run for US Congress and I knew that if I ran for Congress or if I even opened
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:48.520]  my mouth about this, my future in politics was gone. And so it was kind of scary. But
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:52.560]  I'll tell you what, the choice that I made, the choice that you've made, the choice that
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:58.720]  most of you have made to tell the truth, to speak about the beauty of our countries,
[2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:04.120]  to speak about the Republic, to speak about freedom. You know what? Not only is it the
[2:14:04.120 --> 2:14:08.800]  right thing to do, but it's the fun thing to do. And coming down to Alex's place, this
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:14.160]  place is alive. And even though Alex is, for most of you who don't know him, he's intense
[2:14:14.160 --> 2:14:20.280]  and he raises his voice. He's one of the coolest guys I know. He's so full of love.
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:26.560]  And it's really fun down here. It's fun to work for the right things. And so what I'm
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:31.640]  really focusing on these days, and I've gone the whole gambit, I'm an economist, I've written
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:37.640]  books about the Federal Reserve, Glass-Steagall, I was writing about 13 years ago, you know,
[2:14:37.640 --> 2:14:40.760]  and all this stuff has come true, all the things that Alex and I have been talking
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:53.280]  about for years and years. What we are facing as a nation, as a community, as individuals,
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:15:01.600]  as a family, it's so much bigger than what I even was aware of even four or five years
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:09.320]  ago. Clearly, the fight on the economic, political, cultural levels that are going on are so
[2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:15.280]  essential. And I'll tell you what, for all of the people listening, Alex Jones is doing
[2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:21.200]  more for your freedom and for the health of this world than almost anybody I know. He
[2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:28.280]  is the rearguard action. He's the guy who's keeping the wolves off of our tails and giving
[2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:34.760]  us the time so that we can create, so that we can become free, so that we can create
[2:15:34.760 --> 2:15:41.000]  communities so that we can disconnect from the matrix. And talking about and understanding
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:49.400]  the real economic issues, the absolute fraud of the Federal Reserve, the complete matrix
[2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:54.480]  level of the economics of this world. I mean, it's just so mind-blowing, it's so easy to
[2:15:54.480 --> 2:16:01.360]  prove. The fact that our political structure is a joke. Republican, Democrat, it doesn't
[2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:08.720]  make any difference. Bush, Obama, they are controlled by the same slave masters. Absolute
[2:16:08.720 --> 2:16:16.000]  fact. And probably 98% of you already know that. Our cultural institutions. And that's
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:24.040]  where a lot of the power is, because as Alex has, it is an information war. There's a war
[2:16:24.040 --> 2:16:33.040]  on for your mind. And it's my belief that probably 90% of those of us who call ourselves
[2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:38.080]  patriots and who really are aware of fiat currency and of what's going on with the power
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:45.880]  elite and the Bilderberg, we're still enslaved by the system. And so what I've been working
[2:16:45.880 --> 2:16:52.120]  on is going deeper and deeper on the other way. And it's just like in the Star of David,
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:58.600]  as above so below. And while this show helps not thousands or hundreds of thousands, millions
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:05.040]  of people wake up to the, where the rubber meets the road of the, of the lies of our
[2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:10.840]  government, of the, of the lies of our economy, of the lies of Wall Street, of the lies of
[2:17:10.840 --> 2:17:16.640]  our churches, not all the churches, but many of the churches is that there is something
[2:17:16.640 --> 2:17:23.120]  bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger going on. What the game that we're playing is huge. And I
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:29.240]  have a very, very, very dear friend in India who always reminds me life is a dream. Realize
[2:17:29.240 --> 2:17:38.480]  it. Life is a challenge. Meet it. Life is a game. Play it. And life is love accepted.
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:45.680]  And so as I see it, as I see it, there's this huge tsunami of a wave of change coming at
[2:17:45.680 --> 2:17:53.360]  us, at all different levels. And it's a quest. It's a challenge. This is a trial. This is
[2:17:53.360 --> 2:17:58.520]  all, I mean, and the system knows that as Revelation says, the kings of the earth and
[2:17:58.520 --> 2:18:04.000]  the merchants trafficked in the souls of men, they want your mind. They want your soul.
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:10.120]  Absolutely. They want our soul. And it's amazing. I've watched that movie, Matrix, the first
[2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:20.280]  one 34 times, and it's so correct in one way. They want our energy. Why are they, you know,
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:27.520]  we as human beings, why are we destroying this world? Why are we destroying our families?
[2:18:27.520 --> 2:18:34.960]  Why are we creating such incredible bloodshed? Why are we using depleted uranium and Bosnia
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:40.960]  and Serbia and Afghanistan? And, you know, it's, it's, we're, we're destroying, we're
[2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:46.360]  leaving traces of this mineral that will poison for thousands of years. We're human
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:52.000]  beings. Four billion years. Yeah. Yeah. And the half life of 235 is 237,000 years. That's
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:59.240]  just the half life. And why are we using this uranium? And what I have become, I am becoming
[2:18:59.240 --> 2:19:04.680]  more and more aware of, and I'm becoming more aware every day is that what we're facing
[2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:09.640]  is, they're not he who can kill the body, but kill the soul. They want that soul, folks.
[2:19:09.640 --> 2:19:14.640]  That's why they tell you don't have one. They want it bad. Exactly. And, and as Alex has
[2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:24.240]  said over and over and over is that this is a spiritual choice. This is a time of choice.
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:31.120]  And always remember, as scary as a lot of this stuff is, we can change it. We as human
[2:19:31.120 --> 2:19:36.440]  beings, when we get our act together, when we integrate our energies, when we get the
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:41.740]  right information, when we make our hearts and our minds and our bodies strong and join
[2:19:41.740 --> 2:19:50.240]  with others, then we are undefeatable. We can create such beautiful, wonderful qualities
[2:19:50.240 --> 2:19:55.640]  as human beings. All right, stay there. That's like nails on a chalkboard to the new world
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:20:01.080]  loader vampires will be right back with George Humphrey. I'm Alex Jones. If you've ever wanted
[2:20:01.080 --> 2:20:04.520]  to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting
[2:20:04.520 --> 2:20:08.080]  news. There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy. It's called
[2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:12.440]  proto grow and it's dynamite in the garden. Proto grow is a bioactive superfood for plants
[2:20:12.440 --> 2:20:16.040]  that works by providing true broad spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their
[2:20:16.040 --> 2:20:19.680]  full genetic expression. What does this mean in the garden? It means mouth watering fruits
[2:20:19.680 --> 2:20:23.440]  and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength,
[2:20:23.440 --> 2:20:27.240]  blue ribbon garden produce jam packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements,
[2:20:27.240 --> 2:20:31.520]  giant pumpkins, even high potency, high brits wheatgrass. Proto grow is a proprietary blend
[2:20:31.520 --> 2:20:34.920]  of full spectrum nutrients from the sea. It literally contains the basic building blocks
[2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:39.120]  of life itself. In fact, proto grow is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record
[2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:43.320]  time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[2:20:43.320 --> 2:20:47.040]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and might just be the ultimate hard
[2:20:47.040 --> 2:20:51.080]  times barter item. To grow tastier fruits and vegetables right now, go to grow like
[2:20:51.080 --> 2:21:01.640]  crazy.com. That's grow like crazy.com or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365.
[2:21:01.640 --> 2:21:06.200]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:11.960]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from
[2:21:11.960 --> 2:21:17.760]  underneath the Americans at home. We've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:23.160]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[2:21:23.160 --> 2:21:28.240]  citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[2:21:28.240 --> 2:21:34.400]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[2:21:34.400 --> 2:21:38.920]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches
[2:21:38.920 --> 2:21:42.520]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[2:21:42.520 --> 2:21:48.720]  does care. And right now in Washington D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[2:22:00.080 --> 2:22:04.200]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[2:22:04.200 --> 2:22:08.120]  dollar has been evaluating. What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects
[2:22:08.120 --> 2:22:12.440]  your personal finances. Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:15.920]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver. They both have maintained their purchasing
[2:22:15.920 --> 2:22:22.120]  power for 6,000 years. If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back
[2:22:22.120 --> 2:22:28.120]  in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[2:22:28.120 --> 2:22:32.040]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million. The answer to protecting
[2:22:32.040 --> 2:22:41.280]  your assets is simple. Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237-extension169. Get all your

[2:22:59.760 --> 2:23:03.080]  Will I have garlic breath after I take Alley C?
[2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:07.440]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Alley C. And
[2:23:07.440 --> 2:23:12.440]  the answer is Alley C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:16.760]  the active ingredient in crushed garlic. But we'll not give you garlic breath. Scientifically
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:21.120]  proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number,
[2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:26.200]  severity, and duration of common colds. Our powerful Alley C contains 300 milligrams of
[2:23:26.200 --> 2:23:31.800]  stabilized allicin. Just one tablet of Alley C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves. It's
[2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:36.440]  effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal, and viral infections, and helps lower
[2:23:36.440 --> 2:23:40.880]  high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent. Boosts
[2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:45.560]  resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Alley C. For more information
[2:23:45.560 --> 2:23:55.040]  than to order Alley C, call 877-888-7126 or go to garlichealthproducts.com. That's 877-888-7126
[2:23:55.040 --> 2:24:02.040]  or go to garlichealthproducts.com. Fight back with Alley C.
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:47.720]  admitted government funding. They admit that they, for 50-something years, have been testing
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:54.520]  flicker rates, trying to lower people's brainwaves. Everything they do is to make you depressed,
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:24:59.200]  unhappy, to feel inadequate. At one level, it's a Madison Abbey to make you feel inadequate
[2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:04.560]  so they can sell you the cosmetic, or sell you the breast job, or whatever the case is.
[2:25:04.560 --> 2:25:09.640]  But there's no doubt that these people are into darkness. They are psychopathic. They
[2:25:09.640 --> 2:25:15.160]  have armies of sociopaths that serve them, and they're threatened by technological development.
[2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:19.760]  They're threatened by enlightenment, and they're trying to bring in a new dark age desperately.
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:24.800]  Why is that from your research, George? Well, it's all about power. It's all about beings
[2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:31.000]  who are in control of our economic, political, cultural institutions, who are in separation
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:35.400]  consciousness, who don't want to give the power back. They're the big bullies. They're
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:40.840]  the people who don't share. They're the guy out in the playground who whips up on younger
[2:25:40.840 --> 2:25:47.280]  kids. And I know that listening to Alex when he was young, he stood up to the bully, and
[2:25:47.280 --> 2:25:51.280]  he might've gotten smacked in the face, but he stood up. I did the same thing, and I bet
[2:25:51.280 --> 2:25:58.480]  many of you have done the same thing. People, it is time for us to get off of our knees
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:05.600]  as a culture. They have had us. They, when I say they, the power elite, the plutocracy,
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:10.680]  the Bilderberg, whatever you want to call these rascals, is that they have controlled
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:17.040]  the economic institutions for so long, and clearly anyone who knows anything realizes
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:23.160]  it's a total sham. But where they really get us is subconsciously. They get us through
[2:26:23.160 --> 2:26:28.160]  the chemtrails. They get us through the temerosol. They get us through the fluoride. They get
[2:26:28.160 --> 2:26:33.840]  us through the lousy educational. Miss Penault is turning men into women. Absolutely. You
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:40.200]  know, we can go on and on and on and on and on about this. And this is really important.
[2:26:40.200 --> 2:26:46.160]  This is the first step is to become aware of what's going on, because as I see it, the
[2:26:46.160 --> 2:26:51.520]  game I'm playing, I am no longer a martyr. I'm here to win this thing. And what does
[2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:59.120]  winning mean? It means that I have joy, I have health, and I have love, and that I as
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:04.640]  a human being have those qualities, and that I share that, and that our culture, our country,
[2:27:04.640 --> 2:27:09.720]  our world, starts taking better care of itself. We start telling the truth that there is more
[2:27:09.720 --> 2:27:15.320]  peace, there is more cooperation, is that the level of violence goes down. Our quality
[2:27:15.320 --> 2:27:21.240]  of government goes back to a republic style of government. We become sustainable in the
[2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:25.880]  real way, not the way these politically correct people are talking about. They always create
[2:27:25.880 --> 2:27:31.040]  counterfeits. They always create these false things. But I'm talking about living within
[2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:37.440]  our means, but really focusing on what is important. And what is important is not more
[2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:42.120]  – and I make money, I love money, I chase money, but what's really important is not
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:47.200]  more money, it's not more goods, it's not more materialism. It's how much love we
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:48.200]  have in our hearts.
[2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:52.680]  Well, it's in the hierarchy of needs where is money. If money is to secure your family,
[2:27:52.680 --> 2:27:57.160]  be strong, be able to protect yourself, then that's one thing. But if you put it at the
[2:27:57.160 --> 2:28:01.240]  top of your hierarchy of needs, it should be way down at the bottom, but it's like
[2:28:01.240 --> 2:28:05.360]  fuel. I don't worship gasoline I'm putting in my car, but I got to have it.
[2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:10.840]  Yes, absolutely. And you know what? We are human beings, and we can do better, and we're
[2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:15.280]  starting to do better. And just like 20 years ago, when you and I first started talking
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:20.240]  about this stuff, people used to go crazy with me. You were telling me your daughter
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:22.520]  out in Southern California that it's on fire out there.
[2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:29.480]  I'll tell you what. All over the world now, all over the world, people are coming up to
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:33.800]  me. I spend about four months a year in Asia, and I'm walking down the streets in some
[2:28:33.800 --> 2:28:38.360]  little Asian town and they say, hey, didn't I see you on an Alex Jones film? Hey, didn't
[2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:43.560]  I see you do that film called 9-11, The Great Illusion? Hey, I read your book. Oh, I've
[2:28:43.560 --> 2:28:48.760]  heard you on Alex Jones. My daughters and Santa Cruz, all of her friends are aware of
[2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:54.080]  Alex and what he's doing. People stop me everywhere. And you know what? I love it.
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:28:58.760]  And that's not us bragging. We're a sonar paying for folks that aren't known. Yes.
[2:28:58.760 --> 2:29:02.760]  You don't know because nobody knows who you are. We are public figures, and it's getting
[2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:07.680]  more and more as a gauge. We see the awakening. That's why we're so positive, and that's
[2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:12.040]  why the system's going so nuts because they know that the awakening, that's why I'm
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:16.360]  getting chills like all the time now. Used to, I barely got them. I'm having chills constantly.
[2:29:16.360 --> 2:29:23.600]  I used to be, I used to wake up in the middle of the night sweating cold bolts. I was scared,
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:27.280]  you know. And you know what? I still have some trembles every, you know, when I see
[2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:33.640]  what's going on, it still gets me really angry. But now I'm excited. I'm having chills
[2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:37.800]  of good down to go. Absolutely. Like the other day I was in Randalls and all these, you know,
[2:29:37.800 --> 2:29:42.720]  these people, I have no idea. But not only here in Austin, Texas. All over the world.
[2:29:42.720 --> 2:29:46.520]  Or in Santa Cruz. And we have a connection to all these people. We're brothers and sisters
[2:29:46.520 --> 2:29:52.000]  together for liberty. The world is coming together. Stay there. We're on the march.
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:30:01.320]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.320 --> 2:30:05.600]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with
[2:30:05.600 --> 2:30:10.200]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[2:30:10.200 --> 2:30:14.040]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[2:30:14.040 --> 2:30:19.520]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver
[2:30:19.520 --> 2:30:24.200]  Lungs Generator. Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and
[2:30:24.200 --> 2:30:29.840]  ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[2:30:29.840 --> 2:30:35.720]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:42.360]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure
[2:30:42.360 --> 2:30:49.400]  to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[2:30:49.400 --> 2:30:54.520]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works. As well, we are always ready to answer
[2:30:54.520 --> 2:31:00.160]  any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[2:31:00.160 --> 2:31:04.800]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:31:04.800 --> 2:31:09.120]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:31:09.120 --> 2:31:13.440]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:18.520]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[2:31:18.520 --> 2:31:23.160]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[2:31:23.160 --> 2:31:28.800]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:31:28.800 --> 2:31:33.120]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[2:31:33.120 --> 2:31:37.760]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[2:31:37.760 --> 2:31:42.000]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:46.040]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can

[2:32:00.400 --> 2:32:07.320]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[2:32:07.320 --> 2:32:12.240]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[2:32:12.240 --> 2:32:21.240]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They're so
[2:32:21.240 --> 2:32:30.560]  bright in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset
[2:32:30.560 --> 2:32:39.000]  in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.

[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:18.880]  building what's done now. We're now developing the TV show. I could have had it out a year
[2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:22.480]  ago, but we're always so busy with all the other things and TV shows and interviews and
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:23.480]  things we're doing.
[2:34:23.480 --> 2:34:27.520]  I'm going to ask George, he's got the tour now, what he thinks of the new facilities.
[2:34:27.520 --> 2:34:32.800]  It's now 16,000 square feet. We've got two studios over there, technically three. I'm
[2:34:32.800 --> 2:34:36.840]  trying to hire the people and train the people and that's a whole process as you know, but
[2:34:36.840 --> 2:34:40.640]  we're going to the next level and Glenbeck's imitating us, which I think is great, but
[2:34:40.640 --> 2:34:44.840]  we're going to beat him to his September 12th launch. And I've got to go ahead and get
[2:34:44.840 --> 2:34:49.200]  around to next week announcing the launch date and how the show is going to be made
[2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:53.080]  up and what we're going to do, but it's going to be a highly produced 30 minutes. It's not
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:56.200]  going to be some two hour thing. It's really going to be power packed and I'm going to
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:00.280]  do it every day after the show and then stream it live to prismplanet.tv folks. And we've
[2:35:00.280 --> 2:35:04.840]  already got a lot of TV networks, foreign and domestic willing to pick it up. So a lot
[2:35:04.840 --> 2:35:11.760]  of exciting things happening here at info wars.com. But also I want to tell you about
[2:35:11.760 --> 2:35:18.520]  some of the sponsors that make this broadcast possible. One of them is inner food is a revolutionary
[2:35:18.520 --> 2:35:22.520]  hundred percent organic green super food energy drink with powerful nutrition for better
[2:35:22.520 --> 2:35:27.440]  health energy, mental clarity and immune system support. It was even voted best super food
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:32.600]  by our friend, Mike Adams from natural news because it's comprised of nearly 50% chlorella,
[2:35:32.600 --> 2:35:37.560]  spirulina, kelp and dulls. It is also high in the naturally occurring iodine, which can
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:42.160]  help safeguard against the harmful effects of radiation. Give them a call today at eight
[2:35:42.160 --> 2:35:46.120]  six, six, seven, six, two, nine, two, three, eight or visit them on the web at inner food

[2:36:22.200 --> 2:36:31.080]  800-259-9231. George, there's so many other issues, so many other things that are happening
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:35.240]  but what I'm seeing develop is that as more of us have been willing to tell the truth,
[2:36:35.240 --> 2:36:42.560]  you 20 years ago, myself 16, almost 17 years ago, folks that came before us, that now it's
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:49.600]  easier for people to talk about these real issues and so that's really threatening the
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:54.280]  establishment. So they're now coming out and saying, if you don't like the government
[2:36:54.280 --> 2:37:00.760]  grabbing your genitals at the TSA, you're a conspiracy theorist. So now even known facts,
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:04.400]  if you don't like them, you're a conspiracy theorist, which now means heretic.
[2:37:04.400 --> 2:37:10.560]  Well, you know what? We got to stop playing their game. These little minions, these slaves,
[2:37:10.560 --> 2:37:14.880]  these, I don't even know what the right word is.
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:21.360]  They make me funny. They're the kids that you didn't want to play with. They're the
[2:37:21.360 --> 2:37:27.840]  kids who are not very nice. They're the people you don't want to have over for dinner. You
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:36.960]  know what? If they want to call us conspiracy theorists, too bad. You know what? It's just
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:43.200]  so silly and you know what? Alex has been putting his money where his mouth is. He's
[2:37:43.200 --> 2:37:47.280]  doing these incredible things. And if you don't make some, you know, and what do you
[2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:51.600]  think of the studios? Alex, your studios are unbelievable. Well, I haven't even done
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:58.120]  the real tour yet. Friends, I've known this guy since he was a teenager, since he was
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:05.880]  slapping stuff around the back of his car and doing it with passion, even then passion.
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:10.240]  And through the law of conscious manifestation and the law of attraction, bringing good
[2:38:10.240 --> 2:38:18.640]  people together, he has created the center of truth information around the world. And
[2:38:18.640 --> 2:38:22.120]  you know, I talk to a lot of people, they say, well, they don't like Alex because he
[2:38:22.120 --> 2:38:27.640]  yells and I say, look, the things he's getting through, he's just get through that information,
[2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:34.240]  listen to him, because what he's saying is so right on. And he's gone from zero, zero
[2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:37.720]  to having this incredible. Well, George, I mean, I mean, I'm only one little thing in
[2:38:37.720 --> 2:38:42.880]  a larger whole, but I mean, out of a lot of, but a lot of boulders by the side of the
[2:38:42.880 --> 2:38:46.840]  ocean, I'm a big boulder, but there's millions of them. My issue though is boulders, but
[2:38:46.840 --> 2:38:52.760]  I mean, I never exactly, but I mean, I never calculated this success. I never calculated
[2:38:52.760 --> 2:38:56.560]  the anger that, you know, the yelling, the breaking through, but people are in a trance.
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:39:00.760]  So people who are already awake, sometimes it's grading, but it's like cold water on
[2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:06.120]  somebody who's passed out. Exactly. And that's what I'm saying, because it takes a lot of
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:11.320]  knocking at the door of a lot of people who've really shut down. And you know what? Once
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:15.600]  you get through, and once you start hearing it, and once it starts clicking, you start
[2:39:15.600 --> 2:39:21.640]  realize, oh my God, OMG. And I'll tell you what, Alex, not only is telling the truth,
[2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:27.240]  but he's also being sponsored by some incredibly good people and helping them. For example,
[2:39:27.240 --> 2:39:33.040]  one of his products, inner food, it's a fabulous product. You know, the folks that developed
[2:39:33.040 --> 2:39:40.320]  it, Steve St. Clair, fine guy, very conscious, been on the same side, doing the same things
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:45.920]  that we're doing. And to win this war, we, you, everybody, we have to.
[2:39:45.920 --> 2:39:48.520]  They're always telling me, I need to get healthier. And I have actually listened to you. I've
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:52.960]  been trying healthy. Take a little bit of it every day and you get healthier, but enough
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:57.440]  about me though. I mean, I mean, you're too nice, but, but, but like overall, what is
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:40:02.040]  your, what do you think of Obama? I mean, you were in the Obama deception when, when,
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:08.000]  when, when he was a president elect, uh, he was being called the Messiah God and you
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:12.680]  stepped out and, and, and, and went on the record in that film and now it's all come
[2:40:12.680 --> 2:40:19.600]  true. Unfortunately. Well, it's not very hard to figure this stuff out. This guy shows up.
[2:40:19.600 --> 2:40:25.480]  We don't know where he's from. He says he's from Hawaii. Even back then people were saying,
[2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:31.400]  where was he born? Where did he go to school? Where are his records? Why, how did he speak
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:38.000]  at the 2004 democratic convention? Nobody knew him. I mean, it's so easy to figure
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:43.160]  out folks. Is he a great speaker? He's an incredible speaker. Would he be interesting
[2:40:43.160 --> 2:40:49.080]  to have dinner with? Yeah, probably. But the guy is a fraud. He's a puppet. He's just
[2:40:49.080 --> 2:40:50.080]  the same.
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:54.640]  But the point is when you came out against him early on back then, I mean, that was going
[2:40:54.640 --> 2:40:58.200]  on a limb with friends and family because they said, after George Bush, we're ready
[2:40:58.200 --> 2:41:03.280]  for our Messiah and they credit, of course, it's the it's the back and forth. It's the
[2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:09.320]  it's the straw dog. It's the Trojan horse folks. Anything that the predominant media
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:18.680]  brings you is a Trojan horse. George Bush, Bill Clinton, Bush's Obama friends. But I
[2:41:18.680 --> 2:41:25.080]  think I believe that probably 85% of you are aware of that and past that we know that these
[2:41:25.080 --> 2:41:29.320]  folks are puppets. They we know that they want to be our slaves, but you were talking
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:33.040]  about the Great Awakening, the system's going to throw everything they can at us. What are
[2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:38.120]  you systems broken? Did you saw the movie, the Inception, right? That one Leonardo Caprio
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:43.360]  where all the buildings would just fall down by themselves through their thoughts? Friends,
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:49.280]  you know that the economic system of this world is deteriorating. It's built on sand.
[2:41:49.280 --> 2:41:56.440]  There's nothing there. This $1.39 trillion in the QE one and two programs. It's all
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:42:02.680]  digital magic. It's not there. It's fault. There is no money and they'll swat team your
[2:42:02.680 --> 2:42:07.000]  house and kill you if you don't give up your house when you're bankrupt. Sometimes the
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:10.960]  banks even take it when they when they don't even own it. But then the banksters are allowed
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:15.640]  to create thousands of trillions and then we're supposed to bow down and and it is happening
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:23.000]  all over the world in Greece and Ireland and Portugal and Zimbabwe all over the world.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:27.920]  And it's but it's happening here. The debt per person in the United States of America
[2:42:27.920 --> 2:42:35.040]  is about three times, not including the derivatives of what it is in Greece. And friends, it's
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:41.960]  just a matter of time. So protect yourself. Invest some of your money. This is my own
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:48.560]  point of view and hard bullion, gold and silver, gold and silver and get yourself real. It's
[2:42:48.560 --> 2:42:54.280]  only gone up 400% since 2000. You know, do you remember back in the 90s when we were
[2:42:54.280 --> 2:42:59.480]  talking about this stuff and people were just going, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. And you
[2:42:59.480 --> 2:43:07.120]  know what, if you'd invested $10,000 or $1,000 back in 2000, it'd be worth who knows right
[2:43:07.120 --> 2:43:11.720]  now and especially if you put it in any futures. If you'd have put a thousand in silver, it
[2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:18.120]  would be worth a 7,000 prop. I think close eight. It depends on wearing yours. Whatever
[2:43:18.120 --> 2:43:21.240]  seven, 8,000 doesn't make any difference. If you bought it at $5 an ounce, what would
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:28.200]  it be $5 an ounce? It would be it is $33 an ounce, five, six, seven times. Yeah, right
[2:43:28.200 --> 2:43:33.360]  now. Yeah. And then in gold, it holds about five, four times, four and a half times, but
[2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:39.600]  gold and that's a bad investment have been you conspiracy theorists, conspiracy theorists.
[2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:46.640]  I'm one of those patriots. But anyway, just FYI, my opinion is, is that as the dollar
[2:43:46.640 --> 2:43:53.080]  and as the euro and as the other fiat currencies lose value, which they will as more and more
[2:43:53.080 --> 2:43:58.120]  people wake up because of the massive debt, because there really is nothing there, it's
[2:43:58.120 --> 2:44:04.680]  out of thin air is that the hard assets, a monetary assets will go up in value. Well,
[2:44:04.680 --> 2:44:09.960]  if you wrote the book, what is it? 97 or 98 when they were debating getting rid of Glass-Steagall.
[2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:13.520]  I remember listening to it on book on tape. Yeah. Because I've read them all. The first
[2:44:13.520 --> 2:44:16.760]  one was common sense. Common sense and introduction to the dangers of the new world. And then
[2:44:16.760 --> 2:44:21.160]  you said they're gonna, they have these derivatives. They're talking about getting rid of Glass-Steagall.
[2:44:21.160 --> 2:44:25.200]  If they do that, it'll take a decade or so. Everything will totally implode. They'll set
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:31.840]  up their world bank and now we're here. You know what? And that wasn't so hard to figure
[2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:36.920]  out then. I mean, you know, it's just basic fundamentals. All you do is follow the money
[2:44:36.920 --> 2:44:41.760]  and where it goes. And the Glass-Steagall, you know, I'd love it if they brought Glass-Steagall
[2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:49.600]  back. My opinion is it's too late to fix the sinking ship, but it's not a bad thing as
[2:44:49.600 --> 2:44:54.960]  one ship goes down. We, the people of this nation, the clear thinking people of this
[2:44:54.960 --> 2:44:59.920]  nation who believe in truth, who believe in love, who believe in cooperation is that we
[2:44:59.920 --> 2:45:04.000]  are going to build the new society. And I'm not being wild or anything.
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:07.640]  No, no. We've got to be here to explain to people what happens to the globalist. This
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:12.040]  is the way, I think Stuart Rhodes likened it when I was talking to him. I don't think
[2:45:12.040 --> 2:45:21.600]  it was on air, but he said, this is the USS Titanic and it's sinking and the UN ship,
[2:45:21.600 --> 2:45:24.680]  the new world order ship pulled up and said, we will save you, but really it's cannibals
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:29.900]  on board that want to eat you. I mean, I added that part. And then we're the USS Liberty
[2:45:29.900 --> 2:45:36.840]  the USS Constitution, the USS humanity, freedom, free will, goodness, decency, you know, light.
[2:45:36.840 --> 2:45:41.120]  We're pulling up saying, don't get on that ship. Get on this ship. Yes. And you look
[2:45:41.120 --> 2:45:44.840]  at those vampires over there, the gang way telling you to get on board with them. They're
[2:45:44.840 --> 2:45:49.760]  the ones that blew the hole in the ship. And as we've said before, friends get off your
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:57.560]  knees, detach from the existing matrix, detach is you say like, like Babylon mentally, spiritually,
[2:45:57.560 --> 2:46:01.920]  I come out of you, you're a fraud. I don't believe any of it. And you know what? A lot
[2:46:01.920 --> 2:46:09.520]  of you who don't know Alex, a lot of you don't realize that this guy right here, he's got
[2:46:09.520 --> 2:46:16.360]  a solid connection with spirituality. He realizes that the soul is eternal and that telling
[2:46:16.360 --> 2:46:23.400]  the truth and love are the essential eternal elements. And yet, and he is the reason he
[2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:27.960]  can come here and do this day after day and show this bravery, the reason he can go down
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:35.680]  to the Capitol like he did last week and speak to our to our slave masters is because he's
[2:46:35.680 --> 2:46:41.760]  not afraid and neither should you because you know what? The game's over. The game of
[2:46:41.760 --> 2:46:47.320]  the imperialist, the game of these people, it still appears like they're in charge, but
[2:46:47.320 --> 2:46:51.440]  they can't continue. It's it's gone. It's over and they're making all these shows of
[2:46:51.440 --> 2:46:56.240]  forces sticking their hands down our pants in a wild attempt to get control back. And
[2:46:56.240 --> 2:47:01.120]  it's not going to work. And Alex has been giving us the time and most of you who are
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:05.400]  out there, you're giving us the time. No, they're giving us the time. Each one of you
[2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:11.040]  out there can just speak to one person this week, just speak to one new person. They have
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:16.160]  no idea the crossroads or some do that everything, every mind we free, every person we get to
[2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:22.240]  look at reality now is is is incalculably valuable to humanity and the species. You remember
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:26.360]  that book I used to give out called The Hundredth Monkey that talked about, you know, if four
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:30.280]  and five to six percent of the population. Those are studies in Japan. Yes, absolutely.
[2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:35.200]  It's a true story. And when a new concept comes through, people first of all ignore it, then
[2:47:35.200 --> 2:47:39.200]  they laugh at it, then they get violent with it. And then is enough a critical mass gets
[2:47:39.200 --> 2:47:46.200]  aware of it, then it just happens. And you know what? For so long, less than one percent
[2:47:46.200 --> 2:47:50.080]  of the population has been aware of this stuff. But in the last couple of years, our numbers
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:55.800]  are increasing, increasing, increasing, increasing. And if we're just about at the tipping point,
[2:47:55.800 --> 2:48:00.640]  and if just the people of this show and this show goes out, I don't know how many people
[2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:06.920]  listen to show a week and count internet everything. It's about 10 million a week. It's amazing.
[2:48:06.920 --> 2:48:11.960]  And if just 50 percent of you can speak to one person and get one person the next two
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:17.840]  weeks to wake it up, think of what that means, because this there is a war on for your minds.
[2:48:17.840 --> 2:48:24.000]  And the important thing to remember is don't speak about it with this about fear. See it
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:28.640]  is a game. This life is a game. Let's play it. There's a there's a war between good and
[2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:33.120]  evil going on. Come in for the big win because you're already going to be in the war regardless.
[2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:36.080]  They're already going to run over you. You might as well stand up and come in for the
[2:48:36.080 --> 2:48:39.040]  big win. It's like why not play the game? Let's say
[2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:43.880]  see this is a wave. Get your surfboard out and let's surf this wave. Let's have some
[2:48:43.880 --> 2:48:50.720]  fun with it because we can make this society our own lives, our families. We can have so
[2:48:50.720 --> 2:48:56.720]  much more fun. We can be so much more healthy and we can have such big smiles on our face.
[2:48:56.720 --> 2:49:00.480]  And so, you know, at first, for a long time, I was really scared about this stuff and we
[2:49:00.480 --> 2:49:04.720]  have to go through that. But you know what? It's not so scary. I mean, you know, I'm
[2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:08.600]  concerned for sure because there's going to be turbulence and there's going to be some
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:12.040]  tough times and some people probably are going to get hurt. But we're living in an incredible
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:18.320]  time. We're blessed to be living in this time of great tumult. We are blessed. This is this
[2:49:18.320 --> 2:49:22.400]  is the center of the universe. This planet of ours, this world of ours, what's going
[2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:27.360]  on right now? And you know, one of the things I talked to Alex about is that I go to India
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:33.240]  and I read all this prophecy stuff I read about going from the age of Pisces to Aquarius
[2:49:33.240 --> 2:49:37.720]  and from the Kali Yuga to the Satya Yuga and I read all about the Mayan calendar. But there's
[2:49:37.720 --> 2:49:42.480]  real science behind this. There's this thing called the galactic shift and the processional
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:49.440]  shift that is real science and things are changing. And you know what? This is not some
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:54.480]  new age or weird stuff. It's just fact. And so we might as well play with it. Anybody
[2:49:54.480 --> 2:49:59.800]  who can look at their eyes can see that the world has changed so much in the last 20 or
[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:05.840]  30 years. The whole solar system is changing. The whole solar system and friends, as I was
[2:50:05.840 --> 2:50:12.400]  probably most of you know, every planet in our solar system, according to Voyager 1 and
[2:50:12.400 --> 2:50:18.480]  Voyager 2 and the National Institute of Science of Russia has increased their heat. All the
[2:50:18.480 --> 2:50:23.040]  planets are getting hotter because we're getting into an area where we're getting more
[2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:26.960]  radiation. No, that's right. They admit because they're doing samples not just from the sun
[2:50:26.960 --> 2:50:30.960]  or the moon manipulating weather because the moon is more of a, you know, a lensing effect
[2:50:30.960 --> 2:50:34.960]  when it blocks the sun or doesn't block and it controls the tides. But what's happening
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:40.720]  is is that more radiation just from space, more particles is saturating the atmosphere.
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:46.880]  It's coming in. And there's no question about this. This is fact. Now that doesn't mean
[2:50:46.880 --> 2:50:52.560]  that we shouldn't and we must be fabulous stewards of this. I am a tree. Stay there.
[2:50:52.560 --> 2:50:55.080]  We got to go to break. We got to go to break. We're going to come back, take two segments
[2:50:55.080 --> 2:50:58.400]  of calls, five minutes at the end of the show and then we got five minutes overdrive, George
[2:50:58.400 --> 2:51:00.920]  Humphrey. Stay with us.

[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:18.240]  Okay, I want to go to five callers, Dave through Mark, but real fast you were talking
[2:54:18.240 --> 2:54:24.480]  about the old Ben Laden finger in the break. Well, it's so funny to me. Do any of you listening
[2:54:24.480 --> 2:54:29.360]  have any people that you know in your life who just don't tell the truth and who are
[2:54:29.360 --> 2:54:34.840]  perpetual liars? And at first, you know, they speak with a forked tongue and it confuses
[2:54:34.840 --> 2:54:40.120]  you, but then after a while and you get to know them, if they're still in your life,
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:49.760]  it becomes almost a joke. And it's like right now, I mean Osama Ben Laden taken by the SWAT
[2:54:49.760 --> 2:54:57.760]  team and then they supposedly kill him and dump his body. First of all, probably 90%
[2:54:57.760 --> 2:55:01.640]  of you know that he died in either 2002 or 2003 from kidney failure.
[2:55:01.640 --> 2:55:05.320]  Yeah, but on top of it, they have fake situation, rim photos and later myth they're fake and
[2:55:05.320 --> 2:55:07.440]  then he didn't have a firefight with them.
[2:55:07.440 --> 2:55:13.760]  It's like 9 11 is that there's not one or two or a dozen. There are hundreds of factual
[2:55:13.760 --> 2:55:19.840]  pieces of information that show that the story is a fairytale. And so to me, like it's like,
[2:55:19.840 --> 2:55:23.160]  but in this thing about Osama right now, what a joke.
[2:55:23.160 --> 2:55:25.080]  It's like saying Santa Claus is real.
[2:55:25.080 --> 2:55:30.720]  How can they do this? But you know what? Every time they lie, you know what the price of
[2:55:30.720 --> 2:55:38.040]  a lie is? The price of a lie is the truth. And as the you know, the lie of 9 11 is the
[2:55:38.040 --> 2:55:43.360]  truth that actually boomerangs back on him. It's called karma. The lies that they tell
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:49.560]  us every day that you and others are exposing is the truth. And as horrible as these things
[2:55:49.560 --> 2:55:54.480]  are, they're coming back to is the karma or what goes around comes around or whatever
[2:55:54.480 --> 2:55:55.480]  you want to call it.
[2:55:55.480 --> 2:56:03.400]  But we are those of us who believe in the truth, who believe in God, who believe in
[2:56:03.400 --> 2:56:10.960]  honesty and integrity and who believe on respect for human life is that things are changing
[2:56:10.960 --> 2:56:16.240]  and as dark as these days seem, things are getting better. And I don't like to talk about
[2:56:16.240 --> 2:56:20.520]  winter lose because the only reality is right now, but we're winning this thing.
[2:56:20.520 --> 2:56:23.880]  They've decided to lose. So it's not even winter lose. They've decided to lose. Dave
[2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:27.960]  in California, you're on the air with George. He's putting his headphones on. Dave, thanks
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:29.800]  for holding. Welcome.
[2:56:29.800 --> 2:56:34.880]  Thank you. Prison Planet TV member Dave from California. Now, two things I just want to
[2:56:34.880 --> 2:56:39.680]  know how the bringing back of Glass-Steagall will help cancel out those derivatives. And
[2:56:39.680 --> 2:56:44.880]  this weekend on the television set on those riots and Athens, we saw what looked like
[2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:53.800]  a three-foot by six-foot sign and it said, golden sex employee of the decade and it looked
[2:56:53.800 --> 2:56:58.040]  like it had George Papandreou's picture in it in English right there in Athens.
[2:56:58.040 --> 2:57:01.800]  Now, they're waking up. I mean, getting rid of Glass-Steagall, I mean, bringing Glass-Steagall
[2:57:01.800 --> 2:57:04.520]  back, that wouldn't let them create these derivatives.
[2:57:04.520 --> 2:57:08.760]  Yeah. Well, first of all, it's not going to happen or at least I don't think it's going
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:12.520]  to happen. It would be a positive step, but I don't think it'll happen. And then your
[2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:17.400]  question is a very, very good one. How would it would reverse these derivatives? And the
[2:57:17.400 --> 2:57:24.000]  snakes are already out of the bag. You know, we've had $1.3 trillion in the QE programs
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:29.920]  in the last 16 months. And as I was saying to a friend here the other day, is that probably
[2:57:29.920 --> 2:57:34.360]  80% of that what we call money or currency has gone to money heaven because it's been
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:40.840]  paying off the interest of those toxic derivatives. Otherwise, we would have had much, much, much,
[2:57:40.840 --> 2:57:45.640]  much more inflation in the system. So your question is a good one, and I don't have a
[2:57:45.640 --> 2:57:46.640]  good answer for it.
[2:57:46.640 --> 2:57:50.640]  All right. Thank you, Dave. Tim and we're going out to break, but Tim and Washington,
[2:57:50.640 --> 2:57:53.480]  go ahead. We'll take you out to break and hold the music down. Go ahead.
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:55.480]  Yeah. How's it going, guys?
[2:57:55.480 --> 2:57:56.480]  Good. Go ahead.
[2:57:56.480 --> 2:58:01.760]  I was curious. You were mentioning movies like The Matrix and everything like that. Do you
[2:58:01.760 --> 2:58:07.240]  think there's some similarities to the movie They Live and the quote-unquote signal that
[2:58:07.240 --> 2:58:12.800]  keeps everybody precipitated? And the type of rowdy piper having to beat his friend up
[2:58:12.800 --> 2:58:16.120]  to make him put the glasses on to see the truth?
[2:58:16.120 --> 2:58:17.120]  Exactly.
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:22.720]  Absolutely. Your view on They Live. I've got to jump. Oh, man, that's an amazing movie.
[2:58:22.720 --> 2:58:29.200]  And look at these movies because this guy called Spielberg, he's head of the bad guys
[2:58:29.200 --> 2:58:30.520]  as far as Hollywood.
[2:58:30.520 --> 2:58:36.000]  Yeah. I mean, what do you think John Carpenter's doing though with They Live? I think...
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  It's hard. Stay there. We'll be right back.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:51.920]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[3:00:17.880 --> 3:00:23.680]  Just to make clear, if you're saying you like they live, if you're saying that all these
[3:00:23.680 --> 3:00:28.680]  other films, I mean, clearly they're conditioning us and others, no doubt. Ronnie in Texas,
[3:00:28.680 --> 3:00:30.680]  Ronnie, you're on the air.
[3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:37.080]  Thank you, sir. During my most recent visit to the Capitol yesterday, I spoke personally
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:42.080]  with Lieutenant Governor delusional David Scrooge-Lewes, and I was angrily filling out
[3:00:42.080 --> 3:00:46.600]  a tiny card when Lieutenant Governor walked right up to me to talk, and he pretended to
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:51.520]  be on our side, and he said a few great slogans, and he told me he'd ask about some doctors
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:55.600]  about what I'd told him about my experience with medicinal marijuana, but really I called
[3:00:55.600 --> 3:01:01.160]  Mr. George Emphrey to ask you for your help. With the City Council of Criminals and Sociopaths,
[3:01:01.160 --> 3:01:06.520]  they made a special rule to exclude me, Ronnie, Referseed, and others.
[3:01:06.520 --> 3:01:10.120]  Yeah, that's right. They're now excluding regular speakers, and they're making it harder
[3:01:10.120 --> 3:01:11.120]  to speak.
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:16.280]  God, you know, Ronnie, when I was a city councilman, right or wrong, I would get to the office
[3:01:16.280 --> 3:01:22.320]  about 6.45, 7 o'clock every morning, and we had what was called the bullpen, and it's
[3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:26.760]  my belief that an elected representative, one of their biggest things is to talk and
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:33.400]  to listen to the people of the community, and if somebody disagreed with the position
[3:01:33.400 --> 3:01:38.920]  that I had, I would always put them first in line, and listening to the people. I am
[3:01:38.920 --> 3:01:43.360]  a former city council member, and actually I'm a pretty nice guy and very polite, and
[3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:50.480]  I don't call names. Most of the council members will not return my phone calls or my letters
[3:01:50.480 --> 3:01:51.480]  right now.
[3:01:51.480 --> 3:01:53.480]  I keep writing them, I keep sending them.
[3:01:53.480 --> 3:01:57.280]  No, no, when you go down there and look at them, they are incredibly well-
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:01.320]  They're scared. They're scared because, you know, just like this water treatment plant
[3:02:01.320 --> 3:02:06.520]  number four, they're saying, we've got to have more water. Whoa, look, go out to Lake
[3:02:06.520 --> 3:02:11.480]  Travis. It's empty. Creating another water treatment plant is not going to make more
[3:02:11.480 --> 3:02:16.320]  water. There's a reason that there was less than 200,000 indigenous people in Texas before
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:20.840]  the first settlers came here, because there wasn't enough water. We're out of water now,
[3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:24.800]  and you can build all the water treatment plants you want, but it doesn't make more
[3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:30.040]  water. It's just like fluoride in the water. Every objective study has shown that fluoride
[3:02:30.040 --> 3:02:37.320]  is a thyroid inhibitor, not good for your teeth, and is bad for your health. Case closed,
[3:02:37.320 --> 3:02:44.400]  so objective, and yet these people are not waking up to the reality.
[3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:48.560]  But more than that, I had a whole water story I meant to get to, and I didn't get to it,
[3:02:48.560 --> 3:02:52.080]  but it turns out the Army Corps of Engineers waited and didn't release the water, let it
[3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:56.200]  build up to flood, and now they're trying to buy up people's land for nothing, and they're
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:03:01.800]  sending water through Travis down to farmers that aren't even using it. So there's only
[3:03:01.800 --> 3:03:05.000]  shortages. They're also trying to accentuate that.
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:09.120]  So a lot of people don't realize that more people are homeless on the Mississippi River
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:14.560]  right now from the floods than all the homeless people that were in New Orleans. Both were
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:21.160]  terrible situations, but the lack of support for the people on the Mississippi from Washington
[3:03:21.160 --> 3:03:27.480]  because they did not vote for Obama. And you know, this is simple, hardcore politics.
[3:03:27.480 --> 3:03:31.720]  And that's like when we have fires in Texas, Obama won't even come or help openly because
[3:03:31.720 --> 3:03:36.480]  Texas doesn't like him. I mean, that's what's like Obama supporters, they get health care
[3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:39.320]  waivers. I mean, this is real. I mean, they don't have to get the insurance.
[3:03:39.320 --> 3:03:44.080]  This is hardcore politics, and friends, we have to be aware of it. And at the same time,
[3:03:44.080 --> 3:03:50.160]  if we want to win, we have to disengage, we have to understand this stuff and see it like
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:55.440]  a keto, let this information go so we don't get sucked into it, but spend our time getting
[3:03:55.440 --> 3:04:00.720]  strong and healthy and joyful and creating a types of community and lifestyles.
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:04.560]  Yeah, we've got to be optimistic and we've all got to not let ourselves get sucked into
[3:04:04.560 --> 3:04:09.120]  the negativity. I mean, cover the hard issues, be bold about it, but at the same time realize
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:13.120]  that we need to keep our heads about us and that incredible things are happening. I apologize
[3:04:13.120 --> 3:04:18.240]  to Michael and Mark. We'll be back live tomorrow 11am to 2pm, Lord willing. And then of course
[3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:21.400]  back Sunday, 4pm to 6pm. And I hope everybody has a great 4th that you like coming up as
[3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:25.920]  well, but we'll be live tomorrow. George, it's always great when you orbit back through
[3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:28.880]  town. How many months a year are you in Austin now?
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:34.520]  4 months a year. And I love Austin. Austin is one of the real vortexes of energy in the
[3:04:34.520 --> 3:04:39.240]  world. It's a great place and there's a lot of great places and I love traveling around
[3:04:39.240 --> 3:04:40.240]  meeting new people.
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:44.240]  Alright, buddy. Well, it's always good seeing you here. There's a lot of great energy, plus
[3:04:44.240 --> 3:04:46.040]  the good, the bad, the ugly are all moving here.
[3:04:46.040 --> 3:04:49.640]  Oh man, Austin's a great place and thanks for having me on. Go, Alex!
[3:04:49.640 --> 3:04:55.280]  Ah, go George, man. You're awesome. Great job with the crew today and just continue to watch
[3:04:55.280 --> 3:05:00.280]  MFallWars.com and PrismBuddy.com for just more keenish boring out. Bye, bless.
