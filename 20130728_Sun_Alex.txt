[00:00.000 --> 00:17.200]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:30.000 --> 00:46.920]  Ladies and gentlemen it is Sunday the 28th day of July 2013 I am your host Alex Jones and we're
[00:46.920 --> 00:56.800]  gonna be here for the next two hours and I talk about this more and more we're living in momentous
[00:56.800 --> 01:03.200]  times and I brace myself each day for the broadcast in an attempt to try to focus my
[01:03.200 --> 01:14.400]  intellect and really try to present you with the historical reasoned analysis that I have
[01:14.400 --> 01:20.680]  developed that has proven to be quite accurate the historical current research futurist research
[01:20.680 --> 01:27.640]  and constantly staying focused on these issues and interviewing the world experts on every
[01:27.640 --> 01:34.800]  subject you can imagine from political science to geo politics to quantum mechanics nanotech
[01:34.800 --> 01:45.240]  robotics Machiavellian Venetian technologies of propaganda right through Joseph Goebbels
[01:45.240 --> 01:53.560]  I've done my homework back when it comes to understanding this information I've done a
[01:53.560 --> 01:59.880]  pretty good job it comes articulating it that's another subject entirely because the breadth
[01:59.880 --> 02:08.600]  and width of reality is so complex that the real genius is being able to communicate things in a
[02:08.600 --> 02:19.160]  overall gestalt that is complex while still being simplistic and speaks to the general population's
[02:19.160 --> 02:28.200]  subconscious mind that is already aware of these truths but has just not consciously focused on
[02:28.200 --> 02:33.400]  that and to put it plainly the Pentagon brags about this in public documents and reports we're
[02:33.400 --> 02:41.560]  going to be getting into this hour they are attempting to keep the general mind in a subconscious
[02:41.560 --> 02:47.000]  state and to program the subconscious so that the subconscious will control the conscious
[02:47.800 --> 02:53.480]  and to where the public will never wake up to just how out of control obvious the tyranny has got
[02:55.400 --> 02:58.920]  and so all I'm trying to do here is just point out what's already going on
[02:58.920 --> 03:06.840]  the elephant in the living room as they say and to get people to realize that our salvation lies
[03:06.840 --> 03:12.120]  in admitting the problems we've got so we can get away from these problems we didn't get here
[03:12.120 --> 03:17.240]  overnight we won't get over it overnight the journey of a thousand miles does start with
[03:17.240 --> 03:23.160]  the with the thought to make the single step and then to finally take that step but they've so
[03:23.160 --> 03:29.080]  preconditioned people that everything I say and do I know is already pre-programmed in people
[03:30.760 --> 03:37.480]  it's pre-programmed in me I say we attacked Iraq wrongly and lied about WMDs we fund Al Qaeda
[03:38.120 --> 03:44.680]  i.e. America we know that the private criminal corporate interest that have hijacked the nation
[03:44.680 --> 03:51.480]  are the authors and the drivers and the the the progenitors of it we have have gone along with it
[03:51.480 --> 03:57.160]  some of us consciously some of us unconsciously but but we're not the the main culprits
[03:59.480 --> 04:03.480]  and so I know that when I say the Pentagon brags that they've brainwashed
[04:03.480 --> 04:08.040]  the American people I know the programming at one level and is oh my gosh you're bad
[04:08.040 --> 04:14.360]  melding our precious troops no no no no no one is more brainwashed than people in the military
[04:14.360 --> 04:19.800]  or at least the power structure wishes that actually they're the easiest to wake up because
[04:19.800 --> 04:24.760]  they're in the middle of it and go wait a minute this guy makes perfect sense that's exactly what's
[04:24.760 --> 04:30.120]  always been going on why didn't I see it well you were in a group think scenario and I'm doing
[04:30.120 --> 04:37.080]  like a cult deprogramming intervention here and the military though does have an older American
[04:37.080 --> 04:43.320]  code still in it from before the globalists took over so they also hear what I say and remember
[04:43.320 --> 04:49.240]  that's right that's that's America what that guy's saying not these people coming in from FEMA giving
[04:49.240 --> 04:54.680]  us briefings that George Washington's a piece of trash and and that communists are wonderful
[04:54.680 --> 04:58.120]  we'll be right back folks this is a powerful broadcast what i'm going to cover when we come back

[07:06.040 --> 07:19.800]  it is sunday the 28th day of july 2013 i'm your host alex jones and i'm talking
[07:19.800 --> 07:26.520]  point free teleprompter free i come to you with deep historical research 18 years on air i am a
[07:26.520 --> 07:32.200]  documentary filmmaker and i run the info wars dot com ritz syndicated radio transmission as well
[07:32.200 --> 07:38.200]  as the nightly news and i have a team of 40 plus crew members coming to you from deep in the heart
[07:38.200 --> 07:46.200]  of texas broadcasting nationwide and worldwide thank you so much for joining us on this sunday
[07:46.200 --> 07:55.960]  broadcast we're not going to be talking about weiner vowing to stick it out until later in
[07:55.960 --> 08:01.160]  the next hour because it does illustrate the absurdity of what we'll put up with from politicians
[08:02.440 --> 08:07.240]  and there's actually a rhyme and a reason to this politicians and these frontmen like bill
[08:07.240 --> 08:11.320]  clinton and others are just meant to lower our standards i will talk about that some one of
[08:11.320 --> 08:18.120]  the big national stories going on right now and i'm going to get into some off the chart news
[08:18.120 --> 08:25.320]  news member back in march i don't know was it five months ago back five months ago four five
[08:25.320 --> 08:30.040]  months ago they were going to take 10 out of everybody's bank accounts in cyprus and then
[08:30.040 --> 08:34.120]  other european countries they're talking about now to give to private bankers as a bail in you've
[08:34.120 --> 08:38.840]  heard of giving the bankers trillions of your tax money to bail them out from derivatives crimes
[08:38.840 --> 08:44.280]  they've committed synthetic garbage synthetic debt obligations the list goes on and on we've all
[08:44.280 --> 08:48.760]  you know seen that well how about now and they're actually talking about this in congress now a
[08:48.760 --> 08:56.120]  bail in well first it was going to be 10 percent and then people put up with that so that was going
[08:56.120 --> 09:04.200]  to be 15 and 22.5 now it's going to be 47.5 of the nation's bank accounts now they call that a
[09:04.200 --> 09:09.080]  haircut 47.5 percent because you can't have these big mega bankers that are being bailed out who
[09:09.080 --> 09:14.840]  created trillions and fake fraud go to jail like bernie made off or ken lay no no no instead they
[09:14.840 --> 09:21.240]  get your bank account now and that's Reuters by the way so it was going to be 22.5 but now it's
[09:21.240 --> 09:30.040]  going to be 47.5 cyprus uh lenders set bank of cyprus bail in at 47.5 percent you know it's like
[09:30.040 --> 09:34.920]  hey we're going to rob your bank account at almost half but but we don't call that robbery we call it
[09:34.920 --> 09:42.440]  a bail in and then doesn't that sound nice okay so that's the type of news that's the fruits of the
[09:42.440 --> 09:47.960]  new world order the fruits of globalism the fruits of naftan gatton the atlantic treaty
[09:47.960 --> 09:55.160]  organization and all of the authoritarianism that were sold as security no authoritarianism and
[09:55.160 --> 10:01.160]  cronyism and big centralized mega banks running big centralized governments is called nightmare
[10:01.160 --> 10:10.040]  tyranny it's not called progress it's not called progressive it's no it's called swindles so big
[10:10.040 --> 10:15.720]  they say it's too big to fail so the whole society commits to it and i'm affixing it but all that
[10:15.720 --> 10:22.440]  does is empower them so we're gonna be talking about that now what i'm going to talk about here
[10:22.440 --> 10:29.000]  today is undoubtedly and i say this a couple times a year because things get more and more wild
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.840]  this is undoubtedly the most important crystallization or epiphany
[10:37.240 --> 10:43.240]  clarity that i have ever ever had and the clarity has been intensifying the evidence
[10:43.240 --> 10:48.040]  has been overwhelming you've seen it mainstream media even reports on it i mean this is when i
[10:48.040 --> 10:51.880]  talk about this you're going to go yeah tell us something we didn't know but the point is it's
[10:51.880 --> 11:00.920]  the depth of it and and this is devastating news to the globalist and this is incredibly
[11:02.040 --> 11:07.240]  important news for free humanity and you know i tell you like it is in fact i get up here with
[11:07.240 --> 11:12.520]  such hardcore news i know it actually demoralizes people sometimes and scares people and could be
[11:12.520 --> 11:16.200]  called fear mongering but i'm just reporting on what's going on in i don't think you're cowards i
[11:16.200 --> 11:21.160]  think you'll know the truth and know the threat and get out of your catatonic state talking to the
[11:21.160 --> 11:24.920]  general public not our regular listeners to understand what's happening you know our our
[11:24.920 --> 11:30.040]  collective house is on fire and i'm here saying hey get up i can't carry you out of here your
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.280]  house is on fire there's like flames lapping the bed it's already burned up half the people in the
[11:34.280 --> 11:43.080]  house and you're you're saying i'm a conspiracy theorist no no i i'm documented with top economist
[11:43.080 --> 11:47.800]  in 1998 that they were going to create worldwide derivatives bankrupt the world economy in the
[11:47.800 --> 11:53.000]  next 15 years and bring in world government how did i know it was in club of rome and devos and other
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.440]  press releases this stuff's all public saw a clips a day of like evelyn diroth child bragging
[12:00.440 --> 12:04.440]  about it a few years ago about how they implode the world of currencies and bring in a planetary
[12:04.440 --> 12:10.040]  currency and it's all happening and that was on bloomberg of all places in fact i meant to
[12:10.040 --> 12:15.800]  i am you guys that clip i think the actual oh you do have it good okay we'll get to that remind
[12:15.800 --> 12:21.720]  me this is too much see folks remind me next hour to play that please thank you so it's frustrating
[12:21.720 --> 12:25.480]  to watch them say this watch them do this watch them carry it out
[12:27.960 --> 12:31.560]  and then sit there people are ignorant go that's your opinion no it's not my opinion
[12:34.040 --> 12:41.560]  now you can take basically some of my conclusions and say i'm wrong but whatever the point is we
[12:41.560 --> 12:47.400]  need to be upset about what's going on and happening now i sent out some tweets at twitter
[12:47.400 --> 12:52.360]  dot com four slash real alec shows you can follow us by going there uh in the last few hours that

[14:53.240 --> 15:00.200]  us and the allies were coming in and it totally clicked and i'm gonna try to go over this again

[20:24.200 --> 20:27.560]  rallying patriots worldwide
[20:31.800 --> 20:34.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:41.960 --> 20:48.760]  all right this is not going to be junior league radio where we boil things down to fifth grade
[20:48.760 --> 20:54.760]  level and repeat slogans all day and make fun of the brainwashed liberals that are really
[20:54.760 --> 21:03.640]  authoritarians this is this is this is real history folks okay real history because i became
[21:03.640 --> 21:09.000]  kind of a military history novice as a teenager i've read hundreds of military history books
[21:09.000 --> 21:14.600]  mainly on the last hundred year period and so i've read declassified british psychological
[21:14.600 --> 21:21.000]  warfare manuals u.s. army psychological warfare manuals a nazi psychological warfare manuals i
[21:21.000 --> 21:27.240]  i know what goes on at the pentagon and i read the declassified stuff that they've put out so
[21:27.880 --> 21:32.200]  when we talk about this i know more about the command structure and how all these people work
[21:32.200 --> 21:36.920]  than the average person in the military does because they're compartmentalized and actually
[21:36.920 --> 21:41.480]  in the speech that was given last week that's gotten no attention except for dredgerport.com
[21:41.480 --> 21:48.760]  and info wars.com the hedge spokesman for the pentagon public affairs said we've got to get
[21:48.760 --> 21:54.440]  uncompartimentalized and we look like fools to everybody and basically admitted that they're
[21:54.440 --> 22:00.200]  the most brainwashed people out there and so what's happening is they're realizing their propaganda
[22:00.200 --> 22:05.160]  is show over the top that it's backfiring and it's making the people in the military who are
[22:05.160 --> 22:09.720]  engaged in propaganda believing it's for a good cause completely turn against them that's why
[22:09.720 --> 22:16.920]  they're so worried about whistleblowers. Now you know last week the Associated Press announced
[22:16.920 --> 22:22.520]  so did Reuters that they're now going to have domestic propaganda with the CIA and defense
[22:22.520 --> 22:27.720]  department targeting the american people that's big national news now that's always been going on
[22:27.720 --> 22:32.840]  to a certain extent but there's the headline u.s. repeals propaganda bans spreads government made
[22:32.840 --> 22:38.120]  news to americans that's already been going on it's not really government news it's globalist news
[22:38.120 --> 22:42.920]  that have hijacked the government that's anti-gun anti-family i mean you see it it's in sitcoms the
[22:42.920 --> 22:49.240]  news the dramas that isn't just some liberal bias liberal is a psyop these aren't liberals see
[22:49.240 --> 22:53.720]  everything's a lie folks and i'm going to decode it for you right now okay
[22:55.880 --> 23:00.840]  now if you're a radio listener you've got to go to info wars.com and look at the video i'm talking
[23:00.840 --> 23:07.480]  about while the show's on i'm just distracting watch it after the show but the point is it's a 35
[23:07.480 --> 23:13.960]  minute press conference and when you see the people in the audience and the questions they ask
[23:14.680 --> 23:19.720]  and some of these people are like generals kernels you know heads of air force tv divisions
[23:20.360 --> 23:26.920]  they're getting up there going nobody believes us anymore and i want to stop lying and he goes well
[23:26.920 --> 23:34.040]  we tell as much as we can now now let's not yes we uh i agree but we can i mean it's it's really an
[23:34.040 --> 23:39.800]  embarrassing moment because this is meant to be a psyop they've been authorized to do this because
[23:40.360 --> 23:44.200]  they need to come out and say oh we want to be your friend we want to work with all the independent
[23:44.200 --> 23:49.640]  media now which means sponsorships and buyoffs and taking people over it's what they're trained to do
[23:49.640 --> 23:55.720]  in other countries turned against us publicly but they need to get the troops who believe the
[23:55.720 --> 24:02.440]  mission is good to buy into it because once they're hooked once they bite on the worm they
[24:02.440 --> 24:08.200]  don't know there's a hook there so it has to sound good up front to the public and the military
[24:08.200 --> 24:12.280]  and then once they get them into it then via peer pressure and the rest of it they'll follow the
[24:12.280 --> 24:19.720]  program to embed themselves in the alternative media now now again they announced last week
[24:19.720 --> 24:22.920]  they're going to infiltrate the media they're going to influence us they're going to run
[24:22.920 --> 24:28.440]  psyops on us this they blown the bugle were they were being charged this is a captured u.s military
[24:28.440 --> 24:35.880]  you can watch army war college uh you know professors like thomas barnett whose pro-neural
[24:35.880 --> 24:43.480]  order admitting it on c span that they work for basically foreign offshore corporations
[24:43.480 --> 24:50.600]  so so the country's been soft could there's been a soft coup d'etat by these interests and they
[24:50.600 --> 24:56.600]  don't want to counter coup that's it as they try to do their mop up operation get rid of the states
[24:56.600 --> 25:04.280]  bankrupt the country fully to bring in more social control to make us dependent this is all publicly
[25:04.280 --> 25:09.880]  written up too by the way i'm not just saying this it's outrageously public but again they have to
[25:09.880 --> 25:15.480]  kind of make a lot of it public and only thinly veil some of the more vicious aspects because
[25:15.480 --> 25:20.040]  it's got to look like it's no big deal in front of the police and military it's all part of just
[25:20.040 --> 25:27.000]  parading i mean here's an example my wife was at a marathon in waco this weekend saturday and they
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.120]  had different youth cores out in uniforms running checkpoints in fact she got video of this this
[25:32.120 --> 25:38.680]  is so commonplace that i haven't even had her email it to the office yet so we can put it together
[25:38.680 --> 25:43.160]  this is in a bunch of clips when they told her get out of there she's like why are there people
[25:43.160 --> 25:48.440]  at checkpoints with youth brigades and the police they're like get out of here get out of here see
[25:48.440 --> 25:51.800]  don't ask questions to my wife at a marathon
[25:54.360 --> 26:00.120]  and it's it's high school proms you name it'll have us army there or checkpoints i've got all
[26:00.120 --> 26:04.920]  these clips they're pouring in of checkpoints in tennessee checkpoints in california checkpoints
[26:04.920 --> 26:11.880]  in michigan where you'll have us army national guard tsa viper teams swat teams local police
[26:11.880 --> 26:16.760]  searching everyone and pointing guns as part of a drill yeah the drill is that everybody used to
[26:16.760 --> 26:24.600]  do just north korea on steroids i've talked to reporters who've been in north korea as reporters
[26:25.720 --> 26:29.960]  for years and they go well no it's already controlled so it's not like that except in
[26:29.960 --> 26:37.240]  certain areas i mean this is this is flaming authoritarianism so what's the big story i'm
[26:37.240 --> 26:42.360]  getting at because we'll go to break and come back with it what's the massive story i'm going to
[26:42.360 --> 26:50.280]  break down for you i go to drudge saturday yesterday and i and i see pentagon spokesman
[26:50.280 --> 26:57.880]  public affairs must change with the times and he's saying we can't let drudge report and other
[26:57.880 --> 27:05.640]  alternative media and blogs communicate with the public we we can't cover stuff up it's a 35 minute
[27:05.640 --> 27:09.880]  press conference because it's gonna get out anyways and when you watch this whole thing
[27:09.880 --> 27:15.880]  they're going people come ask questions they go but we're told to lie and he's like oh i know but
[27:15.880 --> 27:21.240]  we want to be their friends now so you can see how how freaked out and depressed but then other
[27:21.240 --> 27:24.760]  people got tears in their eyes you mean we're not going to lie to him about how we're trying to
[27:24.760 --> 27:29.560]  detect their guns yeah i mean it's it's because they here's the reason the military is our number
[27:29.560 --> 27:33.560]  one audience even though a novice would tune in to think i was criticizing the military
[27:34.120 --> 27:38.920]  if i was a german in 1935 i wouldn't be against the military i'd be against who was in control of it
[27:38.920 --> 27:46.200]  adolf aila was settler i wouldn't be against the russian military in 1947 i'd be against Stalin
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.840]  who was in control and so the military more than anybody hears me on the air for 18 years
[27:52.840 --> 27:57.400]  talking about stuff that nobody knew about before i got on there and broke it down because a lot of
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.400]  people on the inside brought me stuff and i was the only guy crazy enough to cover it when i saw proof
[28:02.600 --> 28:05.960]  and when i'd go to these drills and stuff and they threatened to kill me and stuff i went what
[28:05.960 --> 28:10.600]  you're training to take guns you just threatened me when my camera was off and then i go back to
[28:10.600 --> 28:15.880]  my hotel room and it's broken into so i was like this is america i didn't believe this stuff i just
[28:15.880 --> 28:21.080]  came here to cover what you're doing and it's the generals doesn't want you taping this well i know
[28:21.080 --> 28:25.400]  why it was guys in john deer hats though when you came taking our guns and the marines were
[28:25.400 --> 28:30.520]  practicing killing them and i got footage of it and of course the marines were hopping mad
[28:30.520 --> 28:34.920]  they were told they were going to be court martial related to stop me that's what i'm telling you
[28:34.920 --> 28:41.080]  folks i found the treason and i talked about it the military went yeah we do do that that is wrong
[28:41.080 --> 28:45.480]  that's why the military loves this show that's why this broadcast is such a danger to them
[28:45.480 --> 28:48.760]  that's why drudge is such a danger that carries our news on a weekly basis
[28:50.280 --> 28:55.000]  is because we know the secrets we know the program i'm going to break it down and play these clips

[33:44.200 --> 33:48.920]  of a prison planet by the kleptocrats that don't like freedom because they want to secure their
[33:48.920 --> 33:55.800]  ill-gotten gains and we're fighting it with the info war hence info wars dot com all right i'm
[33:55.800 --> 34:02.840]  going to get to these defense department clips at the official authorized prepared statement
[34:04.040 --> 34:08.760]  of george little assistant to the secretary of defense republic affairs with all these generals
[34:08.760 --> 34:16.680]  and everybody packed at fort mead maryland nsa headquarters okay because they know that
[34:16.680 --> 34:20.200]  they're listening to the phones they've got computers that break down the real poll numbers
[34:21.320 --> 34:24.840]  forbs went out and has hired data mining companies to find that it's like
[34:24.840 --> 34:29.960]  80 something percent of people are pro-gun uh congress has lower than a 10 percent approval
[34:29.960 --> 34:37.240]  rating i mean the system's in trouble folks they have no credibility and so now you've got
[34:37.240 --> 34:42.120]  the military commanders that are civilian and basically globalists run in many cases
[34:43.080 --> 34:47.160]  trying to maintain control over the military but then you've also got a lot of people in
[34:47.160 --> 34:50.840]  government who are civilian who know what's going on and are upset i've talked to so many
[34:51.400 --> 34:58.440]  nsa people and reporters and whistleblowers and they say listen alex uh people are listening to
[34:58.440 --> 35:02.680]  you in the government and there's a little oversight on government they all get away with
[35:02.680 --> 35:07.880]  they just sit and listen to you at these military bases and we see it i mean some days like 10 percent
[35:07.880 --> 35:12.040]  of the traffic we're getting of millions of visitors is from military bases and government
[35:12.040 --> 35:18.600]  bases and i mean believe me they don't have 50,000 60,000 100,000 people from the government
[35:18.600 --> 35:24.760]  listening every day who are being paid to do that and they're and by the way it's not just junk
[35:24.760 --> 35:31.320]  traffic we can follow it they're buying stuff so let's make this clear the government is not our
[35:31.320 --> 35:37.800]  enemy the criminals that have hijacked it are the problem and who have hijacked our bill of
[35:37.800 --> 35:42.280]  rights and constitution now now before i get these clips let me just play i could play all the media
[35:42.280 --> 35:46.920]  attack in years truly but for every time i'm attacked they attack drudge matt drudge of
[35:46.920 --> 35:53.240]  drudgereport.com probably let's not exaggerate 15 20 times for every time they attack him
[35:54.760 --> 35:58.600]  you know for every time i'm attacked he gets attacked 15 times or more because you know his
[35:58.600 --> 36:03.160]  side is probably five times bigger than ours it's the biggest news aggregator in the world bigger
[36:03.160 --> 36:06.680]  than twitter and facebook combined that's new york times own study it's probably bigger than that
[36:06.680 --> 36:11.320]  believe me i know nothing's bigger than a drudge link to our website and we we have our own big
[36:11.320 --> 36:14.520]  stories that become sometimes the number one story on the web without drudge but most of
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.080]  the time it is drudge that does that i mean it's like the big gun and i have to know it's really
[36:19.080 --> 36:23.720]  independent from a kind of paleo conservative libertarian constitutional spin but but the
[36:23.720 --> 36:28.920]  reason i talk about it is why is the pentagon and the white house and the just department
[36:28.920 --> 36:33.160]  constantly bad mouthing and attacking it we're scared of it because they know it's real folks
[36:34.520 --> 36:38.920]  why are they attacking us they know we're real and it shakes them up that they can't control
[36:38.920 --> 36:44.040]  the narrative because all we do is go okay here's a clip of obama saying he would not raise any taxes
[36:44.040 --> 36:49.240]  on poor people and no payroll tax he did he did all that here's obama saying no lobbyist he breaks
[36:49.240 --> 36:54.120]  all records here's obama saying he cut the deficit he more than tripled it you know on and on and on
[36:54.120 --> 36:58.920]  and on it's simply that we're going uh here's what he said here here's what he said here
[36:59.720 --> 37:06.040]  because the corporate prostitutes the parrot press that's what they are the
[37:08.040 --> 37:12.520]  they're not the prostitutes that's a good term for prostitute press but i mean more they're just
[37:12.520 --> 37:18.120]  the parrot press the paratutes i guess you could call and across the prostitute and a parrot with
[37:18.120 --> 37:23.720]  a prostitute you get a prostitute a parrot prostitute but the issue here is is that they're
[37:23.720 --> 37:29.160]  panicking because they're not all powerful like hitler or chelchescu or all our julius sees
[37:29.160 --> 37:35.960]  are any of these corrupt systems and we could see the new world order fall if you believe it
[37:37.080 --> 37:40.840]  but they've gone into all the churches with cognitive infiltration on record
[37:40.840 --> 37:44.680]  the last 50 years and told them it's always the end of the world next week so why get involved
[37:44.680 --> 37:50.120]  do what government says roman's 13 hitler's favorite quote render and a seizure garbage out of context
[37:51.080 --> 37:56.120]  so that's a sigh up folks we we we could fix america we wouldn't be perfect we can make it
[37:56.120 --> 38:00.760]  better it's all in increments we didn't go to hell in a handbasket overnight folks we're not
[38:00.760 --> 38:06.600]  going to go back to basic liberty overnight either and it's not just the government it's the general
[38:06.600 --> 38:10.920]  public is either either good and wholesome we're the people that hold the society up and and honorable
[38:10.920 --> 38:15.800]  and enjoy being nice and enjoy being giving and caring and then there's all the crazy people
[38:15.800 --> 38:21.080]  obsessed with narcissism and and lunacy and mental illnesses up everywhere and the toxins
[38:21.080 --> 38:25.080]  in the environment contributing to it i mean you all see the craziness intensifying and the statistics
[38:25.080 --> 38:30.440]  show it we've all got to get ourselves right with god you know you took the bible out of schools
[38:30.440 --> 38:34.280]  folks look what happened cause and effect even if you don't believe the bible's real at least it
[38:34.280 --> 38:40.680]  was some basic morals it was something now look at who leads our country all the stuff you see on
[38:40.680 --> 38:45.320]  mtv and the rest of it people say oh you goody two shoes you can't handle it no i know what it
[38:45.320 --> 38:50.760]  does to young minds an adult can see stuff like that it doesn't really do anything to him not young
[38:50.760 --> 38:57.080]  people we have a we're being screwed up here and i look at this footage of the pentagon we'll have
[38:57.080 --> 39:01.320]  to get to in the next segment but right now let's get to these first clips and then i'll explain
[39:01.320 --> 39:05.480]  why this is so big there's just a few of them there's so many hundreds of these this is just five
[39:05.480 --> 39:11.720]  or six of them here is hillary clinton saying the government's losing the info war the the the
[39:11.720 --> 39:15.480]  globalist offshore banks that have hijacked it well because when they say our government folks
[39:15.480 --> 39:20.440]  it's not our government that's on red they brag they've conquered america and the rest of the world
[39:20.440 --> 39:25.160]  pretty much let's go ahead and go to hillary clinton so they're telling you to at a cfr meeting
[39:25.160 --> 39:29.640]  that they're losing to their people they don't nobody watches c span we're losing we're losing
[39:29.640 --> 39:35.240]  we better do something you see the enemies losing we're winning let's go to it we are engaged in
[39:35.240 --> 39:40.600]  an information war you know during the cold war we did a great where have i heard of that for
[39:40.600 --> 39:46.440]  america's message out after the berlin wall fell we said okay fine that you know we're on it we're
[39:46.440 --> 39:53.960]  done we we are in an information war and we are losing that war i'll be very good my assessment
[39:53.960 --> 39:58.760]  yeah because because even though america had problems the soviets were super evil so you
[39:58.760 --> 40:02.920]  could get a lot of power grabbed and and and do a lot of stuff and have americans go along
[40:02.920 --> 40:06.680]  because you were fighting people that we knew were pretty super you know corrupt
[40:09.240 --> 40:13.640]  but see now it's al-qaeda that you publicly run everybody knows that now that's in the news
[40:14.280 --> 40:17.960]  it's like robert gibbs said well there's been a drone program for years and it's you know pretty
[40:17.960 --> 40:21.640]  much illegal but we're not allowed to say it exists even though it's admitted to exist and
[40:21.640 --> 40:25.640]  that's like the man behind the curtain that discredits us remember he said that a few months ago
[40:25.640 --> 40:30.440]  and they all laughed well you guys all think we don't know you're conning us we know now let's go
[40:30.440 --> 40:35.560]  to the next and the and by the way do you think army psyops and air force and marine and navy
[40:35.560 --> 40:40.520]  psyops you think they know america's being sold out they're being told a lie to us you think they
[40:40.520 --> 40:45.880]  like doing that there are a lot of great people in our military they are freaked out i talked to
[40:45.880 --> 40:51.240]  them and i saw it in this pentagon press briefing coming up okay let's go to the next clip there's
[40:51.240 --> 40:59.320]  so many of these uh let's uh go to senior white house advisor obama pfeiffer of three months ago
[40:59.320 --> 41:03.000]  or two months ago saying they can't communicate with anybody or let even undersecretaries of
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.280]  state talk to the press because drudge report will get it what we all get what we'll get what
[41:08.280 --> 41:15.080]  we'll get info wars dot com will get drudge will get we will get what you said oh my goodness and
[41:15.080 --> 41:22.360]  then you can't can't control it let's go to that club you guys love drudge i'm not the only one up
[41:22.360 --> 41:29.080]  here um and um why does it drive conversation in your world the way it seems to well it's not
[41:29.080 --> 41:32.680]  it doesn't it's not that it drives our conversation in our world i'm fairly ambivalent to what drudge
[41:32.680 --> 41:37.080]  puts up on a daily basis but it i mean there's a it's let this is less true now than it was before
[41:37.080 --> 41:44.040]  but there's a pavlovian um response from you know some media outlets it's like why are you asking
[41:44.040 --> 41:48.440]  me about this well it's on drudge you know and so it's you know in some cases what do you say to
[41:48.440 --> 41:52.920]  that that's sort of it i sort of ask me to repeat them you know say that to themselves out loud
[41:52.920 --> 41:58.040]  again and think about it um let's stop right there let's stop right there according to every
[41:58.040 --> 42:06.360]  metric and all the press you see drudge only becomes more powerful more influential by the minute
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.000]  because the other media is becoming more fractured there's like a singularity of news
[42:12.200 --> 42:17.480]  but a few sites maybe six or seven drudge is the biggest info wars is in the middle
[42:18.920 --> 42:26.280]  get bigger or maintain while everything else loses their audience so number one he's lying oh well
[42:26.280 --> 42:31.960]  it doesn't have any power anymore but uh you know you've got to laugh at that and that's what
[42:31.960 --> 42:36.360]  that's the talking point that big sis did when we come back in congress she goes well i don't
[42:36.360 --> 42:45.640]  look at drudge about bullets drudge was linked to ap and to forbs but see they didn't say that
[42:45.640 --> 42:49.560]  it's links folks most of it to mainstream news just the stuff they don't want to be the big
[42:49.560 --> 42:55.240]  talking point drudge is secret because he takes a lot of mainstream stuff that the gatekeepers
[42:55.240 --> 43:01.880]  don't want to be a big issue and pushes it out there we'll be back with the introducing pro one

[47:27.560 --> 47:33.880]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[47:33.880 --> 47:40.920]  all right so we're talking about real media independent media media that actually tries
[47:40.920 --> 47:46.760]  to find out what's really going on it could be across the political spectrum just i know some
[47:46.760 --> 47:51.480]  left-wing sites that i would actually call left-wing that actually you know try to report on real
[47:51.480 --> 47:55.800]  things they report on both the right wing and left you know right wing and left wing like counter
[47:55.800 --> 48:04.600]  punch but we're discussing here today the obsession by the white house the justice department the
[48:04.600 --> 48:11.720]  pentagon the dinosaur mainstream parrot media the demon parrot media that just parrot each other's
[48:11.720 --> 48:16.920]  you know vomit back on forth on each other like a dog going back to its vomit i hate to use that
[48:16.920 --> 48:24.200]  analogy but it is a bible verse and they're just obsessed with anyone that dare point out that
[48:24.200 --> 48:29.880]  they're a pack of liars and that they almost have no audience i mean you see the numbers broadcast
[48:29.880 --> 48:39.080]  tv cable tv cable news it is in freefall because people in the survey say they don't trust them
[48:39.080 --> 48:42.920]  so he's just tuned in i played hillary clinton saying they're losing the info or the criminals
[48:42.920 --> 48:48.440]  that run our government then we have uh senior advisor five first saying don't look at rudge
[48:48.440 --> 48:52.600]  you know he's so horrible basically the whole clip he says we can't let our people talk to anybody
[48:52.600 --> 48:56.840]  in the press even undersecretaries of major departments because drudge will get it you
[48:56.840 --> 49:03.000]  can go watch the full clip on info wars dot com uh then you've got uh white house this is drudge
[49:03.000 --> 49:10.120]  j carney and then you've got dhs secretary jant napolitano going oh whoa whoa whoa you didn't
[49:10.120 --> 49:15.400]  just say drudge did you i mean that's kooky made up stuff i mean and then she goes there's no
[49:15.400 --> 49:19.000]  bullets we're not buying bullets of course turned out they bought exactly what we said it was on the
[49:19.000 --> 49:27.080]  fed biz website and then it turned out ap roiders la times forbs all went yeah this is like five times
[49:27.080 --> 49:31.320]  what you ever bought and you're buying armored vehicles and doing riot control training what's
[49:31.320 --> 49:37.000]  this for everybody knows now they bought the bullets and said we were liars everybody knows
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.520]  they're deploying the drones and so we were liars see that's the thing they they can't lie in a vacuum
[49:44.040 --> 49:48.360]  because there are places like drudge report dot com and speaking of drudge report dot com
[49:48.360 --> 49:52.680]  let's put it up on screen before we go these other clips uh if you go there and click on the
[49:53.320 --> 50:03.640]  left hand side linked in red you can see the drudge headline dealing with the exact story
[50:03.640 --> 50:09.640]  we're talking about pentagon vows american people should hear it from us not a scoop on the drudge
[50:09.640 --> 50:15.400]  report and that links through to our article government promises to stop lying because drudge
[50:15.400 --> 50:20.840]  report spotlight shows the power of real media and breaking through the electronic berlin wall
[50:22.600 --> 50:27.960]  now i've talked about that but but again this shows that the establishment understands that
[50:27.960 --> 50:31.480]  we're having an effect on them and all the numbers show that now let's go to two more of the clips
[50:31.480 --> 50:35.560]  and i've got to get to the pentagon briefing before the shower ends second hour's coming up
[50:36.120 --> 50:41.720]  let's go ahead and go to the next clip this is the winehouse press secretary if someone mentions
[50:41.720 --> 50:50.440]  a story on drudge doesn't matter if it's bbc or info wars dot com or or the hill or media matters
[50:50.440 --> 50:54.600]  it doesn't matter what it is well media matters room of the white house so they'll agree with that
[50:54.600 --> 51:00.040]  they will flip out on it and say it doesn't exist uh so let's go ahead uh to that next clip
[51:00.840 --> 51:05.480]  thanks jane uh i have a question i think there's a a report out today i think it's on the drudge
[51:05.480 --> 51:13.480]  report uh that the president uh be mindful of your sources all right hit pause right there
[51:13.480 --> 51:18.600]  hit pause back it up against this bad audio from winehouse dot gov for radio listeners want to
[51:18.600 --> 51:23.240]  play it again they want to talk about an article linked on there remember this is a story this is
[51:23.240 --> 51:28.600]  a page of links occasionally you know they they break something but the point is is it's it's
[51:28.600 --> 51:35.640]  links stories they don't want you to see and he says oh watch your sources and they all laugh
[51:35.640 --> 51:40.680]  they're all like because they wish they were on drudge report dot com a lot of them are on
[51:40.680 --> 51:45.960]  drudge report dot com so they're going why am i bad i'm on there see everybody gets this folks
[51:46.760 --> 51:50.680]  let's go i mean this is just like the super bowl of websites they're at the super bowl i mean why
[51:50.680 --> 51:54.920]  is that a bad thing it's not even a drudge report it's the stories that that drudge things are
[51:54.920 --> 51:59.560]  important that are important drudge just has a good pulse on what's happening let's go ahead
[51:59.560 --> 52:04.920]  and go back to the club i have a question i think there's a a report out today i think it's on the
[52:04.920 --> 52:14.680]  drudge report uh that the president uh be mindful of your sources and just asking the question
[52:15.240 --> 52:20.840]  that the president told someone he believes mitt romney wants to pick a general portray us
[52:20.840 --> 52:25.560]  as a running mate do you have any information on that that's enough and of course it turned out
[52:25.560 --> 52:29.320]  the portray has had been approached and it was in discussions didn't happen but i mean it's so it's
[52:29.320 --> 52:33.480]  like next they're going to say bill clinton was with monica lawinsky but broke on drudge too and
[52:33.480 --> 52:38.360]  everybody knows he did not have sex with that woman oh they caught you drudge you're wrong
[52:38.360 --> 52:44.440]  about monica oh he was right about that oh oh oh wait a minute okay all right well let's go to
[52:44.440 --> 52:49.800]  the next clip here and i and i gotta stop hearing and get to the big briefing that's the big news here
[52:49.800 --> 52:54.600]  uh at the pentagon where they say we've got to basically stop lying to the public uh let's go
[52:54.600 --> 52:59.800]  to uh janet napolitano saying don't listen to drudge not responding why are you buying bullets
[52:59.800 --> 53:05.240]  that are on record and thousands of weapons and thousands of armored vehicles no just oh i don't
[53:05.240 --> 53:09.880]  listen to drudge let's go to that club i don't know if i would put forbes and drudge in the same
[53:09.880 --> 53:16.680]  sentence but uh uh like let me be as clear as i can be uh please drudge out of it i wouldn't
[53:16.680 --> 53:21.240]  i think they're credible but forbes is definitely a credible uh magazine and when they use that
[53:21.240 --> 53:26.840]  on drudge we hear silence from the department uh and americans see the ammo shelves empty you know
[53:26.840 --> 53:32.120]  all that feeds that uh well like i said it got into the blogosphere and it went viral we understand
[53:32.120 --> 53:37.640]  that and and and then if you go watch the full thing when i have time i mean she just goes on to
[53:37.640 --> 53:42.680]  say we're not getting these bullets it's all lie so i mean we're we're in cuckoo puff land here
[53:42.680 --> 53:49.240]  okay they're counting on you not going and checking but because it's on drudgereport.com
[53:49.240 --> 53:54.040]  and info wars.com and worldnetdaily.com and to a certain extent dailycaller.com and they
[53:54.040 --> 53:57.320]  attack me constantly i don't care whatever i just want to beat the new world order all the other
[53:57.320 --> 54:02.760]  sites they don't control the narrative we have more traffic than them i don't walk around on red
[54:02.760 --> 54:07.080]  carpets you know with my boyfriend like anderson cooper or whatever they don't bring my wife and
[54:07.080 --> 54:11.240]  kids on tv and take them around on red carpets but i've got a bigger audience than anderson cooper
[54:11.240 --> 54:17.080]  it's all an illusion drudge has an audience probably ten times anderson cooper anderson
[54:17.080 --> 54:21.800]  cooper's got like a half million viewers folks this weekend show has two million listeners
[54:21.800 --> 54:29.320]  conservatively weekday three million it's all a hoax it's all a fraud and the pentagon gets that
[54:29.320 --> 54:33.480]  and doesn't want to be in the bunker mentality joseph gerbils in the last year of world war two
[54:34.120 --> 54:39.480]  the nazi propaganda minister i've seen the speech he gave with subtitles uh it was on a pbs
[54:39.480 --> 54:45.080]  documentary the point is he said we must stop lying to the people in a speech to the ss because
[54:45.080 --> 54:49.640]  they don't when our when our propaganda is an obvious lie it doesn't work when they see the
[54:49.640 --> 54:54.280]  truth you've got to be honest but then try to basically spin it to still support us within the
[54:54.280 --> 55:00.440]  truth and that's what the pentagon's doing here because their own troops and own syop officers
[55:00.440 --> 55:06.280]  in droves are awake and want to be good patriotic americans and remember what the old army and old
[55:06.280 --> 55:11.240]  air force and old marines were about in the old handbooks even in the 60s were george washington
[55:11.240 --> 55:19.080]  patriotic bill of rights constitution due process we don't torture we don't lie we don't steal now
[55:19.080 --> 55:23.960]  it's we lie we steal because we're the good guys and we kill and we torture and so the pentagon
[55:24.600 --> 55:28.280]  i mean it's a 35 minute briefing i got a bunch of these clips when we come back in the next
[55:28.280 --> 55:32.520]  hour i'll play the clip where one syops person gets up and goes the public doesn't believe us
[55:32.520 --> 55:38.120]  we've got to stop lying these people nodding their heads in the audience i mean it they're
[55:38.120 --> 55:43.160]  told a lie to us every day they don't want to domestically come in and engage in propaganda
[55:43.160 --> 55:48.840]  this is really freaking them out they know this is authoritarianism and he talks about the drudge
[55:48.840 --> 55:54.760]  report here too so uh here it is pentagon spokesman public affairs must change with times and by
[55:54.760 --> 56:00.600]  the way what's it from can't believe it it's from drudge it's from defense dot gov that's what the
[56:00.600 --> 56:05.560]  the video and audio and uh and text that drudge linked to because you know you can't trust him i
[56:05.560 --> 56:09.560]  mean he's just linked to the defense department's own website because i mean he's a big liar just
[56:09.560 --> 56:14.200]  like us let's go ahead and go to the clip number one here it is all leaders must understand the
[56:14.200 --> 56:17.880]  role of the press and the importance of working with the media this is the head of the pentagon
[56:17.880 --> 56:23.960]  p we cannot hide our bad news stories bad news gets out one way or the other and we must come to
[56:23.960 --> 56:29.640]  terms with telling the bad stories as well as the good when bad things happen the american people
[56:29.640 --> 56:37.800]  should hear from us not as a scoop on the drudge report unlike many fine red wines bad news does not
[56:37.800 --> 56:42.520]  get better with age all right let's stop there this requires let's stop there you got to go watch the
[56:42.520 --> 56:46.920]  whole 35 minute report on info wars dot com or just go to drudge report dot com it's the left
[56:46.920 --> 56:50.840]  hand side red linked um say hi to matt and the crew another listening because they just linked
[56:50.840 --> 56:55.480]  that up there on the site and i'm glad because i saw this on drudge estate and just freaked out over
[56:55.480 --> 57:01.880]  and it was nowhere else ladies and gentlemen that because i haven't got to the meat yet of this i
[57:01.880 --> 57:07.400]  mean they've got their people generals and kernels and the heads of air force you know news getting
[57:07.400 --> 57:13.640]  up and going no one believes us we lie all the time you know and and then and then it hurts our
[57:13.640 --> 57:18.360]  people and we want to tell the truth you can only tell the truth when your mission is really good
[57:18.360 --> 57:22.440]  and here's the problem america's been taken over to a great extent so a lot of the mission isn't
[57:22.440 --> 57:28.600]  good anymore you see i mean that's it i want america to be good i want our military to be good
[57:28.600 --> 57:34.920]  and our military wants to be good and we can do this if we realize patriotism is standing up with
[57:34.920 --> 57:40.120]  the bill of rights constitutional declaration of independence and basic common human decency

[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.760]  all right when we come back in the next segment of some stations don't care of this little five
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.760]  minute tidbit because i'm kind of cocking me the way i set up this clock years ago we're about to
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:29.320]  change them to a more normal clock in their future we're going to finish up with the dod
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:37.640]  press briefing by the head of dod not just pentagon but the entire defense department public
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:46.680]  affairs head saying public affairs is killing us spin is killing us lying is killing us and
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.600]  the people in the audience look the moralized freaked out some have tears in their eyes
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.960]  people get them go i want to tell the truth you mean i could stop lying now i haven't gotten to
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:00.920]  the meat and potatoes of this yet because when i have a headline we probably should have had part
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:05.880]  of that in the transcript government promises to stop lying because of drudge report spotlight
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.720]  they use the word lying and we need to stop lying in the piece but then it's not in our article
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.480]  it doesn't matter people aren't complaining because it's in the video but i think we should
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.480]  have those tidbits of course honestly the story got finished being written at about two in the morning
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.840]  and then i woke up and called the the writer and said is it done and then read it and then
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:30.520]  approved it and then went up this morning it's just my problem is is and i'm shell shocked by
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:36.360]  all this the magnitude of it how real it is watching what they're doing and seeing that most
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.640]  these government people either aren't bad people or they're compartmentalized or they are corrupt
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:47.080]  and evil but don't know how media works and to know the next move they're going to make and to
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:54.360]  see the talking points and the tricks it's pathetic and it's scary too because they're not like some
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.480]  omnipotent parent up there that has all the answers folks and knows how to you know it's got everything
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:05.960]  in control oh they're in control of our lives to a great extent but they're not in control of themselves
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.120]  and and i think about private business and private life how many egomaniacs there are
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:18.360]  are how many backstabbers how many liars how many criminals how many nuts how many delusional
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:24.920]  fruit cakes there are in this modern society and how dishonorable as much as a third of the
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:31.240]  population is and another 20 percent is totally gullible and follows them it is scary to think
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:37.080]  about the people some people i know in my life if they were a general or if they were a pr person
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:41.400]  or if they were a media reporter they would be hell on wheels and you know what they are hell on
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:49.880]  wheels when you lay down to authority you get a dictator you get a whole pot an at all fitler a
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:59.240]  mouse a tongue a gingus con and they have lady and paler and they just start killing people and
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.840]  dominating and stealing stuff for fun because that's what they're into i like to take friends out and
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:10.760]  buy them a big dinner and let the wine flow freely i just love giving to people just as it feels good
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:16.200]  it's not like i'm a goody two shoes i just it feels good to like treat people it's fun to
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.960]  have people over to your house cook them dinner hang out you know fun to go to their house i got
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:24.040]  friends that love to be hospitality to me and really enjoy it then you go to some people's
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:27.560]  houses don't act weird about everything and it's like they're uptight and i just they don't like
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:31.800]  being nice to you but then they it's all about getting something and you know they're gonna
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:37.320]  want something and it's coming and you know it's just like wow i just want to be around good people
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.440]  you know i just and i want people to know out there if stuff gets more and more corrupt
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.680]  as things get more and more evil in this world i know you feel like there aren't good people and
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.960]  i know you feel like so what why should i be good listen there are more good people than you know
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.640]  we're just not acting out like the evil people are and god knows what you're doing the universe
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:04.920]  if it's energy whatever it's always darkest before the dawn and i really think humanity's greatest
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:10.760]  time of achievement is coming right now and we just spread our wings we're gonna make it
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:16.120]  to not just the best time in our little short transient lives out out brief candle of shakespeare
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:22.360]  wrote but in the lives of our species because i'm telling you i look at images of my five-year-old
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:27.800]  daughter last night at that restaurant she'd gone to see it a um archaeology display in
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:34.040]  wake of mammoths and saber-tooth tigers and 20-foot sloths and she stuck to french fries in her mouth
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:39.000]  i got a photo of it was said i'm a saber-tooth tiger and she was so cute and i just right then
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.080]  was willing to give up everything a thousand times just just for her to have a future and and
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:49.240]  once you realize it's about your kids and about their children and their children everybody's
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:54.920]  children then it doesn't even matter then it's everything there's no more fear you're just gonna
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:01.080]  do the right thing and then it's it's it's all answered are we choosing our own destiny or has
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:06.280]  it been pre-selected for us as we've moved through history every great leader has had to understand
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:13.400]  the potential of information billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:20.520]  how to tap into your psyche from compulsory state education to the hollywood media brainwashing
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:26.520]  machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.240]  that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it they can take total
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:36.200]  control of your awareness all of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game how to
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:42.440]  engineer the opinion of the american people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.360]  oh there's another one another plane just passed state of mind because there's a war on for your
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:55.160]  mind get your copy of state of mind the movie at info wars dot com and remember every order at info
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:04.360]  war store dot com receives a free citizen rulebook from the front lines of the information war it's
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:19.080]  alex jones you know i don't claim to be an old wise man i'm not even 40 years old yet i'm 39
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:23.160]  people think i'm like 50 because i've put somewhere on these tires let me tell you
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:26.360]  you've been on the air 18 years been involved politically for 20
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.600]  been awake for probably 25 years and had a lot of interesting life experiences but i think about
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.640]  my grandfathers that were in world war two and i think about all the old timers i knew and how
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:42.600]  hard working they were and how smart they were and how decent they were and i think about all the
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.880]  great achievements of america and how great our country's been and i read all the army training
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.680]  manuals and and officer training publications that that they've had for hundreds of years i've
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.440]  read over dozens of those listeners are always mailing them to us i was sent one that was over
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:02.440]  170 years old it's back there in the back office all falling apart for the u.s army back from the
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:09.080]  1820s and it's all about liberty and freedom and small government and the individual and being
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:13.960]  honorable and building an incredible society and then i see what the globalist have built
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:19.480]  and what they've done to the u.s army that is older than america folks it's that it was founded by
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:25.480]  george washington as a militia commander in virginia and then modeled off that and and and became our
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:32.840]  army in july 4 1776 and i look at what they've turned the army into and i look at those army
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:39.320]  soldiers from the enlisted all the way up in the syop meetings and they are genuinely freaked out
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:43.880]  because they know syops and they know what's being done to america and they hear my show folks and
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:49.880]  they know i'm singing from the same sheet of music as they are but i'm deciphering it and telling the
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:57.320]  truth of what it really is and there it's not a power trip by the way it's the opposite i wish
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:02.040]  i could have a big ego and be on delusional power trip like so many people that get a thimble of power
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:08.200]  as i get more and more influence it is crushing to be under the microscope what do you say about
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:15.000]  an ant who's under a magnifying glass you call them unlucky and to be able to see what i cover and
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.080]  what i do have an effect and it's like wow i need to do a better job and then i try to imagine people
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:27.720]  in corporate pr and government pr who i know on average love their kids and at a certain point you
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:35.480]  can't package bull anymore and say it's for a greater good i met with a former cia section chief
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:40.760]  son who's a famous writer for esquire doing a big profile on me and i i approve so much stuff to him
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.960]  and you know i saw him have somewhat of a new level of awakening but who knows that i'll get
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:52.600]  past the editors and you just come to the realization of we either wake people up and change what's
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:59.080]  going on or we go into a new dark age because we've reached that event horizon crossroads right now
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.240]  we're really going into it we're really entering it right now i've been saying the last few years
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:09.880]  we're getting close to that no we're now entering it i can say this week we have crossed into the
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:16.840]  vortex no one should be saying you're bored i'm here to tell you i mean this is history
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.840]  maker to break it for humans what we're going to go through because if we have a new
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.960]  world war three type deal or some crazy tyranny come to power you're going to talk about billions
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:31.000]  dead here i mean this is going to want stuff gets out of control and you let the worst people get
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.400]  in charge you may not believe in the devil folks but he believes in you and whether it's archetypal
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:43.240]  or not it will manifest and the mushroom clouds and the bio weapons and the mass death and the dirty
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:49.560]  bombs and the civil wars will kick off and nobody wants that and everybody listening to me that's
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:56.040]  got any connection to reality any spiritual connection any discernment any street smarts
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:02.440]  good old boy guts whatever you call it you know i'm telling you gospel truth right out of my soul
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:07.880]  right out of my heart and i mean the decision is now because they're either gonna have this big
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.640]  moment of truth and use it to bring in total tyranny and just okay you're under a tyranny
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:17.960]  forget the pretenses this is the way it is basically martial law under another name security
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:24.040]  or we're gonna have a big monologue and a big debate and a big uh this first will be a monologue
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:29.640]  for the mainstream media then a debate about the future of humanity and if there's any real debate
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:35.080]  we start reversing the pendulum back towards sanity back towards liberty and by increment
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.960]  we can turn this around for ourselves and our children and our posterity because posterity is
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.600]  everything i am the posterity of my forebears that came here on the mayflower on both sides of my
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:51.320]  family i am the posterity that fought against the tories in 1776 i am the posterity that
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.680]  that my family on both sides that helped found texas at the very core of starting the whole thing
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:02.520]  at washington the brazos the jones family the eras family all of them and my father and my mother
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:07.080]  meeting each other at the university of texas in a in a union that went back hundreds of years
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:12.200]  to families that met together hundreds of years ago in the past not even knowing it i mean there's
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:17.240]  so much going on in this world that isn't in all your little atheist books ladies and gentlemen
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:23.800]  there is a destiny for humanity and all of our ancestors that worked so hard that we have basic
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.600]  freedom now to all be squandered away for nothing i guess i've got time to go this next clip before
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:34.360]  we go to break let's again this is a defense department thing i watched it at at at at at
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:40.520]  five a.m. this morning again i watched it yesterday and i watched it again this morning and i made
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:44.760]  notes and but you've got to go see the whole thing because because you see the faces you see the
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.080]  tears in their eyes they can't believe the pentagon is saying let's not lie anymore and
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:54.520]  everyone's we can tell the truth and and here's just one of the clips here's just one of the clips
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:01.240]  where the public affairs for air force television that's the person making sure the
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:06.760]  spins right has tears in her eyes and she says no one believes as they think we're liars and she
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:12.440]  talks about how they've lied about the jets and you know bad oxygen and it turned out bad contractors
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:16.280]  they tried to lie about that even the jets were crashing well we can't talk bad about our contractors
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.760]  and and and he kind of gets scared though because she's admitting it's out lying us
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:25.480]  you tell what you can and i think this guy's probably actually a good guy he gets and we're
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.600]  really see america has gotten to the point now where's the moment of truth that crossroads
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.600]  that event horizon where everybody working in the system knows man this is only going to get
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.680]  worse and we don't turn this around and they're all looking at their kids and going i've studied
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.480]  history this is what the bad guys do see it's that point of looking in your kids eyes ladies and
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:48.760]  gentlemen and you as listeners have to have that and people that make fun of us have to have that
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:54.680]  listen what what more has to come out about torture and government drug dealing and lying and
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:01.000]  propaganda and stealing money and foreign banks running us an illegal spying what more has to
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.280]  come out before you join the republic let's let's go to this incredible exchange and then we'll come
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.400]  back and get into some other news but uh here's part of it right now this happened thursday for you
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.720]  it's my first time up here i'm staff sergeant hostetler i work for a air force production
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:22.600]  my question is that you mentioned that we need to start telling the story about the bad news
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.560]  as well as the good and the issue that i see that we're facing i just got back from afghanistan
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:32.120]  and the issues that we've faced before you know the the big incident that i can think of before
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:37.400]  i left was when the air force pilots talked about the epoxy that they were experiencing
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:44.840]  it seems like we have this culture in our career to kind of glaze over these issues and put out
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:50.440]  this positive press on no our jets are fine and so with the good and the bad i don't think the american
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:57.000]  people actually trust us to deliver accurate information how are we what's the plan to change
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.760]  that in the way ahead because to continue the way we have to continue to put that positive spin
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.440]  it feels like we're losing a lot of our audience because they're not listening
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:11.400]  because we keep saying the same thing over everything is okay and it's not like or with
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:15.960]  the sexual assault issues oh it's not okay experiencing an air force so how do we change
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:22.200]  that culture from that pao up because a lot of times the speaking from my perspective and i can
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:28.840]  only speak from my perspective and a junior enlisted perspective the younger generations get it
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:34.760]  that we have to start being honest and forthright and it's difficult to convey those ideas and
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:41.160]  convince the chain of command to necessarily follow those or to be or to stop writing to put
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:46.440]  that first foot forward before someone else leaks our story is there a plan to kind of all right
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.280]  let's stop right there and i mean i mean the main body of it comes up after that you've got to go
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.160]  to info wars dot com or drudge report dot com has the video linked from the left hand side linked
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.760]  and read i mean again it's like watching a movie you got to go watch the 35 minutes because then
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.320]  he's like well we try to tell the truth but we can't always it's it's extremely powerful
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:10.440]  and then other people get up and and say yeah people don't believe us anymore well yeah
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  because there's criminal elements in there folks that ordered a murder of pat telman
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.760]  and then a story how he charged an al-qaeda nest and then the air force colonel the coroner
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:29.720]  that was doing the coroner work for the army would not lie and say that he hadn't been killed
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:33.960]  up close with powder burns and then the witnesses came out they'd execute him because he was going
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.440]  to come back and speak out against the war i mean this is like and that's why she's shaking
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.440]  and has tears in her eyes because it's dangerous talk about all this but they're only bringing
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:48.360]  this out now because they realize they've lost all credibility just just lying constantly
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.920]  and there's a lot more this is a big deal though ladies and gentlemen that across the board they
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:01.720]  realized they don't control the narrative the lives don't work anymore now is the perfect

[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:43.480]  better than that guy they're not trolling they're serious that's how dumb down they are i did a
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:50.120]  satire piece based on the screw tape letters of c.s lewis where the devil's talking to a demon
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:54.680]  how to get souls we know what the devil really thinks i did it like a four minute video and
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:22:01.240]  people think i'm a devil worship or no they are freaking out that i played the part of the devil
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:06.360]  the video is up on our youtube channel i tweeted it out at real alex jones on twitter it's titled
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:11.720]  leaked dhs let me find the actual name of it i'm going for memory it's called off the main page
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:16.760]  of info wars dot com that our youtube page is the featured video there i put it up last night it's
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:22.840]  got only 86 000 views it'll probably get a million views though secret dhs training video leaked
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.720]  you know what i'm going to premiere some of the films that are in the running will announce
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:33.000]  third place tomorrow second place tuesday first place wednesday first place is a hundred thousand
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.840]  dollars for the paul revere contest you can go to info wars dot com for slash paul to see the top
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:46.200]  35 entrance of over 600 incredible films you want to be entertained shocked amazed awakened enlightened
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:56.040]  informed edified this is the site but uh we're gonna announce that 115 000 winners in the next
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:01.080]  three days want to play a few clips because we just been playing some of the top 35 entries
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:05.320]  that that that conformed to radio because a lot of them don't don't fit some of the best ones that
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:09.960]  actually don't fit on radio we're gonna play some of those coming up in the next segment but perhaps
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:16.600]  i didn't tell you guys to actually get secrets of dhs training video leaked uh but uh perhaps we'll
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:21.560]  just play it right off youtube for folks right now see if you can cue that up and we'll we'll
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:28.920]  we'll go out to break with that because because you know you can't just say hey here's what freedom
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:34.920]  does it creates wealth and power and independence and individualism and that's how you get stronger
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:38.520]  is you know well don't let somebody win in sports somebody might get their feelings are
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:44.040]  let's just stop sports all together well now everybody's of couch potato on riddler adderall
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:53.480]  it's the same idea of uh of don't let you know anybody actually be free uh out there they'll be
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:24:02.040]  enslaved well that's why i put a video out from my perspective of what i think real evil is personified
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:08.360]  historically on radio it's powerful but not as powerful as if you look up secret dhs training
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:15.480]  video leaked uh because it it shows the images of the crimes the torture the murder abortion
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:20.120]  all the things the new world order are doing so this is based loosely on c s lewis a famous
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.680]  christian who was not a devil worshiper he did a thing from the devil's perspective just like
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:33.800]  the famous book on uh falston met the stafeles was written by a christian to expose evil i have
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.200]  to explain that to people i know not our general audience with some people uh let's go ahead and
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:46.040]  go to part of this club that we the director of homeland security welcomes you to the federal

[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:58.120]  and of course i did the voice of the devil and his son uh just try to get people thinking about
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.600]  it even if you don't believe in a physical devil there are incredibly evil things in history so i'm
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:07.240]  showing you know mass murders of history while the devil talks about how he wants to destroy
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:14.360]  creation which is what the bible says the devil wants to do and hey even if a devil in real what
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:21.000]  the globalists are doing sure looks like something the devil would do and so that's my point uh in
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.320]  producing that it's just some dark satire it's not a real dhs uh no peace but but but i it's
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:32.440]  actually model after real dhs intro videos they show them where here is the gun owner he may be a
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.600]  terrorist those who believe in george washington are extremists i mean i've played those that
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:42.840]  those are real it's like satire what they do is so satirical i have to make my own to illustrate
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:48.600]  how crazy it is we're going to come back hit the big news and then these premiere film clips for

[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:15.800]  in the weekday show uh but continuing here the good news is i have family in the army mainly
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:20.120]  kind of an army history a bunch of family in the army and they're all awake or patriots
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.960]  they know what's going on they didn't agree with me 10 years ago they go how did you know all this
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:29.240]  it's all true now and that's what everybody else in the military marines army air force navy
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:37.080]  they're all incredibly awake navy is awake but not as much as marines army air force i'm
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:41.880]  not trying to say the navy's bad i just i found a lot of coast guards awake but that's its own
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:48.760]  branch separate from navy i don't know what's going on but navy it's not 50 that are awake when i
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:53.080]  talked to them on the street it's like more like 25 but the other departments it's like 50 so that's
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:35:00.840]  a very positive thing uh and and understand that the globalist above our countries are funding all
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:07.080]  these different interests to create crises so we need a big military it's see it's full spectrum
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:12.040]  dominance they play us off against each other they fund both sides as it's historically
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:19.480]  been documented by the Rothschild's Rockefellers and others so that's why i got into that is that
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:26.120]  the entire government is freaking out about the alternative media and just as google has become
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:31.720]  synonymous with search engine drudge report drudge report dot com has become synonymous with
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:41.240]  real news and and probably 60 of it is mainstream news i'm doing a dead reckoning 20 is government
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:47.080]  press releases and just what government said one day and what they said the next and then 20 is
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:54.200]  alternative media and they're just freaked out more about oh they're going to show obama saying
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:58.120]  he wouldn't come after guns five years ago and then saying he's got to take your guns now
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.880]  and then he never promised to come after your guns it's the contradiction they don't want to be
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:09.240]  called it's like the emperors new clothes he's been conned to pay you know millions of you know
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:14.840]  pounds and gold to get this magic suit but he's really butt naked no one will call the king on it
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:21.160]  but a three-year-old says the emperor is naked and they don't want us calling that i want to play
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:25.000]  one more clip before we get into this financial news then start reviewing some of these films
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:31.240]  that are in the running to win the hundred fifteen thousand dollars let's go ahead uh liberty minded
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:37.080]  films the liberty film festival online film festival let's go ahead and go to chris christy i love how
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:42.280]  paul ryan we're told is the most conservative thing since sliced bread and is going to save the earth
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:47.480]  turns out he's a total globalist anti-gun pro open border new world order obama care loving
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:53.640]  piece of trash i love how chris christy's going to save everybody and now you know i think he
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:37:00.280]  must be brock obama's uh worshipper you know to chris christy obama is his god and he's always
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:07.400]  attacking rand paul and libertarians just like joe biden just like uh obama and just like curl
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:13.960]  rove the republican and democratic party leadership cannot stand that there's libertarian
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:18.760]  constitutionalists who are actually pro america in common sense and want a future for this country
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:24.760]  so let's go to chris christy's clip i i love all these esoteric debates that people are getting in
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:29.800]  senator rampall for example well listen you can name any number of people of ovega and he's one of
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:35.960]  them i mean these esoteric intellectual debates i want them to come to new jersey and sit across
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:43.640]  from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation and and and they won't because
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:48.520]  that's a much tougher conversation to have so as a country and whoever's the leader is christy
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.600]  obama being in the white house do you think no i don't think so i drift towards libertarianism
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:58.040]  he works at chrisco but i think but i think he started to cause it i don't think it's because
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:02.840]  in reaction to him you know they say john wane at 25 pounds of maybe he's gonna digested meat
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:07.320]  and it's called when he dies he's gonna stop that and i'm at chris christy's got like 400 pounds
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:11.400]  of somebody who had top secret clearance i said one man when he sits in that chair and starts to
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:17.000]  hear those briefings his tune's gonna change fast all right there yeah that's a bunch of bull

[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:35.320]  children show and it's anti-family anti-male anti-dad anti-america anti-gun anti-private
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:44.200]  property bull i know your agenda baren harkinen i know your agenda chris christy i know obama's
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:49.960]  agenda by the propaganda you vomit on us every day so don't give me your stuff about when he sits in
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.440]  that chair and sees all the what the declassified stuff that our government runs al-qaeda because
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:59.320]  our government's been hijacked by criminal banks that's helped stage 9 11 with al-qaeda so they could
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:09.960]  take our liberties i am sick of you and your lies pig oh man i tell you what all right that kind of
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:17.160]  clip gets me really mad that arrogant piece of trash who literally who literally there's like a foot

[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:30.040]  in under 30 his most fawning idiot supporters know he's a con artist and obama's nobody but a brand
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:35.000]  to sell tyranny and i'm done with him i've always been done with him but now i realize how dangerous
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:40.680]  he was i i didn't realize five years ago i didn't really oppose obama in his election i was like i
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:44.040]  don't like mccain i don't like him they're all new older look at mccain saying we've got a band

[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:33.960]  lfa mobster you would want to have a prosperous powerful america because that's what generates
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:38.680]  the wealth for you to suck off of but instead you have the tyrants instinct to shut it all down
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:43.000]  because you want to dominate everybody and make them poor so they gotta come begging to you because
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.360]  the truth is you don't just want wealth and power you want to dominate everybody because you're a
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:55.240]  cowardly piece of filth little scumbag at the end of the day monopoly person and let me tell you
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:41:00.120]  something you're going on the ash heap of history buster all right i want to go to one of these first
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:04.120]  clips here from the film review them we'll come back and play more before i go into a complete
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:09.480]  commission fit this is only a minute and two seconds from drop of water a crew of missionaries to
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:14.920]  cambodia talk about how democide government mass killing unfolded in this clip from the beginning
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:21.000]  of the film it's like 20 minutes long it's on info wars dot com four slash paul for paul revere
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.120]  you need to see this incredible film our government helped fund the commaroos that did this here it is
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:32.760]  today 54 percent of the country is under the age of 30 an unwanted malnourished orphans litter the
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:38.360]  streets thrown away like garbage and despite the u.n occupation of the 90s political corruption
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:45.400]  infests every level of government we just taught the kids how to kill the parents how you said that
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:50.680]  parents are enemy paul pot took away their ability to dream when he managed to do that for a whole
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:56.680]  generation of people by making a young boy kill his young sister or kill his own mother so making
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:00.200]  the husband kill the wife or the wife kill the husband to help us understand what the country
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:05.000]  experienced under paul pot in the kamae rouge some of the boys brought us to toll slang prison
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.520]  also known as s21 it was a school that was converted into a prison where suspects were
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:16.200]  interrogated under torture before being executed the first group of people brought there were
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:22.120]  former members of government the military and police then it was journalists writers and artists
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:28.200]  then it was anyone with an education even people who wore glasses were suspected of being enemies
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:32.920]  of the people that's right tyranny isn't fun because it puts criminals in charge
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:39.080]  where the journey is the destination they just want to torture and kill it's an exact program
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:43.320]  it's starting here and by the way notice they had people be complicit in the killing it's like
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:47.960]  abortion once you've done it now you're going to defend it instead of admitting you were wrong
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:53.240]  now you're part of the cult instead of forgiving yourself for what you've done asking god for
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:58.280]  forgiveness and then fighting against it you commit to it and chant hell satan at the texas
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:03.960]  capital that's what's caught on tape protecting your home with a security system is a must but
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:09.320]  when it comes to protecting your family your home and belongings there's no need to sign a long term
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:15.560]  contract listen there was some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long

[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:53.560]  pharma and the american medical association um let's go ahead and play a clip of that film
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:49:00.680]  modern medicine revered as the champion of sickness and the savior of well-being with the advent of
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:07.320]  surgery anesthesia antibiotics vaccines and chemotherapy it has come a long way from its
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:12.840]  crude beginnings despite all of these technological advancements there seems to be a discrepancy with
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:18.760]  the results chronic diseases kill at record rates a life expectancy descends on a downward
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:24.280]  spiral as treatments supposedly improve the conditions they were set out to remedy do not
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:29.480]  what if you were to discover that the current leading cause of death in the united states of
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:35.080]  america isn't stroke cancer or even heart disease but modern medicine itself
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:46.200]  in 1907 the am a confided in the carney d foundation to finance an in-depth study of medical
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:52.760]  education in america abraham flexner an educator in the employee of john d rockefeller was hired
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:58.440]  to survey the country and compiled data on every medical school after five years of touring the
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:04.520]  nation flex and returned with his data and what is now known as the flex report what followed was
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:10.040]  the complete reformation in medical education many medical schools were forced to shut down
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:15.320]  specifically all those that taught homeopathic medicine as the practice was deemed scientifically
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:20.520]  invalid by flexner schools that adhered to flex their standards and advocated synthetic
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:25.880]  drug treatments received millions of dollars in donations from the carney game rockefeller
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:32.360]  foundations the chicago headquarters of the american medical association is the spokesman
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:40.120]  for the majority of its 110 000 doctor members table publicist dr morris fishpine who opposes any
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:45.960]  radical departure from long-established medical practice we insist that the practice of medicine
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:53.320]  is a doctor's problem the doctor is the only one entitled by training by experience and by law
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:51:01.560]  to take care of the sick medicine is still a profession it must never become a business
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:08.200]  or a trade never the subservient tool 100 years after the publication of the flex report
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:12.920]  its influence on social perception in regards to health care have never been more prominent
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:18.280]  for although we have a multitude of medical treatment options the vast majority of us choose
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:24.360]  md directed medicine for no other reason that's where everyone else does and again the audio is
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:30.040]  powerful but the video i mean i mean at first rate when it comes to the graphics and things i mean
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:35.640]  it's like hollywood level the audio's mid mid-grade which were mid-grade many respects i'm not like
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:40.680]  being holly toydy here it's just that the the the the footage the graphics are world-class
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:44.200]  and yeah they got rid of the other four different branches of medicine
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:50.840]  that had always been there and just brought in md but not just md directed rocker fowler directed
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:56.200]  where they could suppress all the real treatments and things very important film see that in full
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:02.040]  it in full wars dot com four slash paul in sickness and in hell let's go to political earth this is
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:06.920]  incredible a cartoon satire that illustrates the absurd political spectrum let's play a
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:16.520]  short clip of that here on the transmission washington dc one of the most evil places on political
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:24.520]  earth doesn't mean conditions here cry extremely hostile for civilized life the only thing that
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:33.400]  reigns in this economic climate is credits out of ten hour and yet there are political animals
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:42.440]  that live here all the time and one of the most remarkable is hunting for power just over there
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:52.040]  david attenborough with obama of politicians their hunting strategy divide and conquer
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:58.520]  the there they go taking up separate positions around the target some from the land some

[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:43.800]  into this strategy the politicians are herding the cattle down the proverbial slippery slope
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:52.040]  in this race to the bottom you're either a predator
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:59.800]  all right that's good and again you could air something like this on discovery channel if
