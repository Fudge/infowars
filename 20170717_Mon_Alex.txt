[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:31.000 --> 00:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us as we kick off another global transmission on this Monday, the 17th day already of July 2017.
[00:43.000 --> 01:01.000]  Remember this headline from November 5, 2016? Madam President Newsweek printed up hundreds of thousands of Madam Presidents. You can still buy one for like $3 on eBay. Hillary Clinton's historic journey to the White House.
[01:01.000 --> 01:17.000]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, President Trump really has a 65% approval rating. They claim it's 37% right now. We also have mobs of youth attacking police for no reason. That video is coming up today. It's all key intel.
[01:17.000 --> 01:35.000]  But first, remembering Dr. Michael Kaufman, who I just learned last night, died a month ago. A great patriot who first exposed Jenna 21. Without him, right now, we would be up the creek without a paddle. But because of his key seminal work, the sleeping giant is awake.
[01:35.000 --> 01:56.000]  Basically, back in the early 1990s, I was leading a multi-million dollar research effort on global warming, contacting and working with scientists all over the world. And it became pretty obvious to me that by 1992, actually in the early 1990s, that man probably wasn't causing global warming.
[01:56.000 --> 02:10.000]  We have now overwhelming evidence that man is not causing global warming. And that's why I think they're ramping up this hype and scare story that Hurricane Sandy was caused by global warming and so forth.
[02:11.000 --> 02:20.000]  But nonetheless, at that particular point in time, I was also following what was going on in an organization called the IUC and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
[02:20.000 --> 02:29.000]  Now, some of you probably know this because you've heard me before, but most of our international treaties are written by the IUC and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
[02:30.000 --> 02:41.000]  The Convention on Biological Diversity was one of those. And at the same time, there was another project called the Wildlands Project, which was basically also coming out of the United Nations.
[02:41.000 --> 02:49.000]  The Wildlands Project called for setting aside 50% of the United States into wilderness, as you suggested just a few minutes ago.
[02:50.000 --> 02:59.000]  And the same people that were writing this particular project, the Wildlands Project, were also writing the Convention on Biological Diversity.
[03:00.000 --> 03:07.000]  And it didn't take a rocket scientist for me to realize that they're one of the same things. And when the treaty finally came out, all the language was there.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  It was really sanitized. You couldn't really see it. It sounded like motherhood and apple pie.
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  But when the Global Biodiversity Assessment was published, it was actually written by the IUCN and the World Resources Institute.
[03:20.000 --> 03:28.000]  When that was published by the UN, it was basically referred back to the Wildlands Project and named the authors and so forth in doing that.
[03:28.000 --> 03:38.000]  I had been in August of 1994 down to the Senate trying to convince them that this was the Wildlands Project wasn't the heart of the Convention or the treaty.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  They ignored me because it didn't say anything in the treaty about it.
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  When the Global Biodiversity Assessment came out a month or two later, it was still in draft form.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  We didn't have the actual copy. That wasn't going to be published until the end of 1994.
[03:52.000 --> 03:59.000]  But we had the draft copy in it specifically said the Wildlands Project. It was a smoking gun.
[04:00.000 --> 04:06.000]  I had been doing actually drawing maps for two years. I don't know why I was drawing them. I just really felt compelled by God to do it.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  I didn't have any idea why. It was a lot of work, but nonetheless I did.
[04:11.000 --> 04:22.000]  When the draft of the GPA came out, I sent FedEx down to the U.S. Senate along with the map. There was actually a couple of us working on it at the time.
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  That map was blown up into a four by six foot poster taken out of the Senate floor at three o'clock in the afternoon.
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  The closure vote was scheduled for four o'clock on September 29th. It just literally died on the fine.
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.000]  Mitchell, Senator Mitchell, the majority leader at the time just took it right off the exciting calendar. It was never voted on.
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  But that's how close we came to having this actually passed and ratified by the Senate.
[04:47.000 --> 04:56.000]  And as you said, very accurately, it's now the marching orders of the U.S. government and every federal agency through a document called Sustainable America.
[04:57.000 --> 05:03.000]  Hi, folks. We'll be right back. He was the first to discover all this. And again, we are now winning.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  All right, so let me get this straight.
[05:06.000 --> 05:17.000]  Hillary Clinton, when accused of using her private e-mail server to send out classified information, immediately deleted her e-mails and physically smashed her hard drives.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  Yet liberal logic says she's innocent and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing.
[05:23.000 --> 05:35.000]  And now Donald Trump Jr. is accused of breaking campaign laws because he had an e-mail exchange and a meeting with a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  Donald Trump Jr. immediately published his e-mails, which showed no wrongdoing.
[05:42.000 --> 05:48.000]  Yet liberal logic says he's guilty. They haven't found the exact law yet, but he's got to be guilty of something, right?
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  After all, he is the son of Donald Trump and there must be a Russian conspiracy.
[05:54.000 --> 06:00.000]  But wait a minute. It turns out that the Russian lawyer has deep state connections to all things anti-Trump.
[06:01.000 --> 06:03.000]  You can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[06:05.000 --> 06:16.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[06:16.000 --> 06:25.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[06:30.000 --> 06:39.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[06:39.000 --> 06:54.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[08:26.000 --> 08:35.000]  And we are GO! Another global transmission is airborne. And we're going stratospheric, we're going intergalactic, we're going interstellar.
[08:36.000 --> 08:48.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday, the 17th day of July 2017. I'm your host Alex Jones, and I'm extremely honored to be here with you today. Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:48.000 --> 09:02.000]  I've got a lot of guests and a ton of big news breaking, but I was sitting there this morning thinking and I thought I need to lead the broadcast and have it basically be a thematic discussion
[09:03.000 --> 09:14.000]  to really wake people up on two big issues that intertwine and intersect together. And if you understand these two intertwined issues, you understand it all.
[09:14.000 --> 09:35.000]  Presidential daily tracking poll has rasmussen with the president at 43, galapasing at 47. If you then take out the 47% that didn't vote in 2016, you can argue that only 36% of the country supports Trump.
[09:35.000 --> 09:55.000]  And we're seeing baiting going on by Psycho Joe and his fiance on the morning show trying to bait the president back into talking about him to make them relevant.
[09:55.000 --> 10:08.000]  And you've got Breitbart coming out and saying that the globalist are panicking. Morning Joe revives President Bannon Smear as nationalism gains traction in the White House.
[10:09.000 --> 10:23.000]  That is being reported by the New York Times, the Washington Post, but we told you two months ago, patriots, nationalists, conservatives, free marketeers, people that like prosperity, folks that don't want to live in North Korea,
[10:23.000 --> 10:34.000]  just common sense, non-suicidal, non-destructive types, positive types are going to really like what Trump does. The first 70 days, he went pure hardcore Americana.
[10:35.000 --> 10:45.000]  He then compromised a little bit, believed the Republicans that they would carry out a good agenda. If he acquiesced, they stabbed him in the back about two months ago at about day 100.
[10:45.000 --> 10:54.000]  He made a hardcore libertarian patriot turn even more hardcore than he'd been during the campaign. He dug his heels in.
[10:55.000 --> 11:11.000]  They responded, as I predicted they would, almost nine months after they got caught doing it last time, coming in with fake polls, fake polls.
[11:11.000 --> 11:19.000]  Now, how do I know these polls are fake? Because I've done the research and I talked to the folks that head up the different polling agencies.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  In 2016, you couldn't pay for an honest poll on Trump.
[11:26.000 --> 11:38.000]  It was the first time in modern history that all the major polling companies, including liberal and historically conservative polling companies, would not give you a fair poll because the Democrats were spending so much money
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  paying for fake polls they bought up the market.
[11:42.000 --> 11:54.000]  And the Republican establishment promised to go along with this lie and to not expose the polling agencies because the never Trumpers, the blue bloods, the neocons, the rhinos wanted Trump defeated so badly.
[11:54.000 --> 12:18.000]  And I came out and I laid out the facts from scientific bots and Google bots and Bloomberg bots and by bots, that's spiders, crawling data across the web, giving major corporations the heads up view that Trump was 10 to 20 points depending on what time he was in the campaign, what period ahead of Hillary.
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.000]  That's why they were panicking, saying she was invincible, saying she was going to win.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  I guess they must have watched too many Oprah Winfrey shows about the secret.
[12:28.000 --> 12:34.000]  That's why they printed up Newsweek by the hundreds of thousands saying Madam President and that she had been elected days before.
[12:34.000 --> 12:50.000]  But they didn't print up that Trump had been elected days before because they believe their own line. They saw after the RNC in July, Trump with 20 points or more in major scientific internal polls.
[12:50.000 --> 13:10.000]  The lowest he ever got was 10 points ahead of her. And I told you that over and over again. But I said just like she stole it from Sanders and stole the nomination and then stole many states from Trump, they were going to try to steal the electors and make them faithless electors.
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  They then came out and said that's a hoax by Alex Jones. Nobody's planning to try to get electors to not seat the president in the electoral college.
[13:18.000 --> 13:27.000]  Nancy Pelosi went to Homeland Security and the Justice Department and asked for me to be arrested for death threats, which I hadn't made.
[13:28.000 --> 13:44.000]  I got that from two different sources. Folks who question Larry Nichols was one of the sources. I got another source telling me that the next day, Pelosi's daughter goes on Fox and says that I've been having people threaten her that they want me arrested.
[13:44.000 --> 13:56.000]  But she was running the faithless elector operation. So they tried all these mind games. They knew that she was behind. They stole five states. They tried to steal six.
[13:57.000 --> 14:08.000]  You've got the heads of six state election agencies coming out saying, no, Homeland Security, the Democrats were breaking in trying to flip the votes in live time in key battleground states, but they failed.
[14:08.000 --> 14:19.000]  They failed. Trump then said that as many as three and a half million illegals voted according to Intel he had that was from Pew Research and Mason Dixon University.
[14:20.000 --> 14:34.000]  New data came out from Harvard a month ago. The data shows from the sample 5.7 million, according to the algorithm, with the sample of 10,000 from registered voters that Harvard got.
[14:34.000 --> 14:42.000]  They then indexed it and said that would be 5.7 million people voting in the name of dead people and illegals voting.
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  And now 48 states are refusing to give over the voter data.
[14:47.000 --> 15:08.000]  So people are asking, we see these polls of Trump at 46, 45, 43. But you hear Democrats call in saying every Democrat I know sees their 401k up, sees more business in their restaurant, sees more business in their store, sees their orders up.
[15:08.000 --> 15:20.000]  Not every Democrat that has a job is pro-Trump now because they understand we're trying to bring back prosperity and a system that gives us a prosperous free market economy.
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.000]  So what happened during the campaign and what's happening now? Here it is today.
[15:27.000 --> 15:40.000]  Rasmussen, daily presidential tracking poll, shows him at 43 with 57% disapproving. Now they do that in the demographics by who they target, who they call, who they get to respond.
[15:41.000 --> 15:51.000]  But also by oversampling, you can read again in Rasmussen and in the others, they always had this one, it's nine points. In others, they had even more.
[15:51.000 --> 16:02.000]  So what they do is they disparage it, claiming Democrats are a larger percentage of the population. So they add into the equation artificially nine points against the president.
[16:03.000 --> 16:12.000]  Now, on average, it's about 15 points. And you look at the different polls they had during the campaign where they would add 30 plus points in phone polls.
[16:12.000 --> 16:22.000]  They would add 30 plus percent more Democrats to who they took polls from in the demographics claiming that was, quote, fair.
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  Well, of course, Hillary was then 20 points ahead in those polls.
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.000]  That's the arrogance of these people running this crone-like witch on the whole idea that, well, she's a woman.
[16:36.000 --> 16:42.000]  So we'll be able to force this establishment seahag on the population.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  Now continuing, globalist panic.
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  Morning Joe revives President Bannon smear as nationalism games traction in the White House.
[16:54.000 --> 17:01.000]  And it goes over the fact that what we told you months ago is indeed the fact Trump is bearing down, digging his heels in on the globalist.
[17:01.000 --> 17:08.000]  And they say, you know, if 40 percent of the public didn't vote, then only 36 percent actually voted.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  So how do you like that? You're a failure. You're a minority.
[17:12.000 --> 17:21.000]  Well, in any broken coalition divided in concord nation, it's going to end up being the biggest minority that ends up running things.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  So seeing a broken coalition strategy, it's a two-way street if the public's awake.
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  Now, let's break down how they really did this and how I knew Trump was going to win from the science.
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this. You're a radio listener, infowars.com, forward slash show to find the live free feeds.
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  Please spread those feeds as well. You are the power and the resistance and the engine of this operation.
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.000]  Without you, we're nothing.
[17:47.000 --> 17:57.000]  Newsweek, special commemorative edition, Madam President Hillary Clinton's historic journey to the White House, printed the week before by the hundreds of thousands.
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  Now, here's CNN asking, how are the polls so wrong? Then they never give you a reason.
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  They want to keep you in the dark. Here's another. The polls clearly got it wrong.
[18:09.000 --> 18:16.000]  The autopsy will take months. CNN, and they never gave us the autopsy, did they?
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  MSNBC skews poll to put Clinton in the lead.
[18:21.000 --> 18:27.000]  Poll, most see Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead. CNN.
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  National polls, tight race, Clinton hanging on.
[18:32.000 --> 18:41.000]  2016 polls continue to show tough map for Donald Trump. Trump versus Clinton. Could the polls be wrong?
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  Now, let's look at the real facts why they were panicking.
[18:45.000 --> 18:52.000]  They have high tech surveillance over Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, NSA, you name it.
[18:53.000 --> 19:00.000]  And they knew that the popular mention for Trump had him at 63 to 70 points at his high, 55 is low.
[19:00.000 --> 19:11.000]  They knew with the different Bloomberg business terminals that are hooked in to every major corporate operation in the country of any large size
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.000]  and hooked into Thompson Reuters and hooked into all the other big databases. Let's skip this network break. This is too important.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  They knew. Thank you, sir. They're talking to me, folks.
[19:21.000 --> 19:25.000]  App maker. Trump will win election.
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  Now, see, that was August 13th. App maker.
[19:32.000 --> 19:39.000]  And then it goes into major apps that, again, are able to interface with samples of millions of users of the apps.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  And then they can go in and track what you're saying and doing on the app with AI computers.
[19:44.000 --> 20:00.000]  And the AI computer said Trump's going to win Gigantor. And there are thousands of data points per person every week when you're using these apps.
[20:01.000 --> 20:04.000]  You add that together with millions of users. You have billions of data points.
[20:05.000 --> 20:11.000]  You add that into all the other algorithms. You get trillions of data points, quadrillions of data points.
[20:11.000 --> 20:21.000]  It's just compounds. So they knew good and well he was winning and they tried to steal the election, but six states were waiting and blocked them.
[20:24.000 --> 20:31.000]  Trump would have won five other states and would have won the popular vote if they didn't have all this garbage going on.
[20:32.000 --> 20:39.000]  Despite a majority of opinion polls showing 2016 presidential election going to Democrat Hillary Clinton, a smartphone app developer says his data suggests
[20:39.000 --> 20:44.000]  challenger Trump will be the victor. Based on the stats we see, he looks strong, said Rick Malenty.
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  Let's get him on. Co-founder of San Diego based Crazy Raccoons, maker of zip questions and answer app.
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  His app poses questions and poll responses based on the average of 100,000 daily users.
[20:58.000 --> 21:05.000]  I go with Trump based on what I see. Absolutely. And he goes into, he was seeing Trump at 60, 65%.
[21:05.000 --> 21:13.000]  Let's continue. Trump will win the election and it's more popular than Obama in 2008.
[21:14.000 --> 21:20.000]  AI system finds CNBC and business readers actually want to get the truth occasionally.
[21:21.000 --> 21:28.000]  I'm just going back folks. You understand they're doing the same thing now when they tell you he's plunging in polls.
[21:28.000 --> 21:36.000]  But see polls are finite. So they can't just keep dropping, dropping, dropping, dropping because nobody's going to buy that, you know, 1% or 5% supporting.
[21:37.000 --> 21:55.000]  So they always want to show it at 50 and then drop it and say, oh, look, he's in trouble and then raise it back up but not report on it and then drop it again to keep creating the illusion, the simulation in the minds of the sheeple and of weak minded conservatives to start deserting Trump.
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  Trump will win the election and is more popular than Obama in 2008.
[22:01.000 --> 22:10.000]  AI system finds an artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential election, which Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton, the race for the White House.
[22:10.000 --> 22:25.000]  Mog AI was developed, founder of Indian startup. It takes 20 million data points and forms public platforms, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. that analyzes the information to create predictions.
[22:26.000 --> 22:35.000]  And it found a massive win for Obama and a massive win for Trump. And it found that October 28 10 days before the election.
[22:35.000 --> 22:41.000]  We're going to continue for a few hours here because I've got hundreds of these AI studies if you want them.
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  Now, what did the news say? This insane cuckoo head, Alex Jones says Trump's 15 points ahead.
[22:49.000 --> 22:58.000]  Because if you average the AI stats out from hundreds of firms reporting it, Trump was 10 to 20 points ahead. What's the average of that? 15.
[22:58.000 --> 23:09.000]  I don't need a supercomputer to know that. Hundreds of AIs saying 10 to 20 points ahead. Hundreds. None of them saying behind. None of them saying five points ahead.
[23:10.000 --> 23:21.000]  10 to 20 points. What's in the middle? 15. 15 points ahead. 15 points ahead. 15 points ahead. But again, they keep hammering you. He's unpopular. He's hated.
[23:21.000 --> 23:28.000]  Better not wear a shirt out in public. We'll knock you upside the head with a bottle.
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.000]  TechCrunch, analysis of social media, did a better job of predicting Trump's win than the polls.
[23:35.000 --> 23:43.000]  Robot that keeps calling Alexis correctly has called the U.S. presidential race. Unindependent for Donald John Trump.
[23:43.000 --> 23:58.000]  So that's why I raise all of us at the start of the broadcast today. They're telling you everywhere that he's unpopular, that he is less popular than leprosy, than gonorrhea, than AIDS, than cancer. None of it's true.
[23:59.000 --> 24:10.000]  But super weak-minded losers that actually believe if they buy into trendiness and buy into mainstream media that believe that they're going to end up being successful, that they're going to end up having a great future,
[24:10.000 --> 24:20.000]  they don't know what to do. So they get more hysterical. They get more worthless degrees. They go into more debt. They get more trendy.
[24:21.000 --> 24:29.000]  They fully commit to the cult believing that it's going to somehow deliver to them if they just go to the next level of commitment.
[24:29.000 --> 24:45.000]  And if they force us onto the globalist plantation and onto that program of total nihilistic idiocy and total anti-free speech, total societal collapse, that somehow then they'll be transported to Valhalla.
[24:45.000 --> 24:58.000]  What it is is a bunch of betas and cucks and weaklings. I don't mean physically beta, I mean mentally beta, who are afraid of prosperity, afraid of prowess, afraid of competition.
[24:59.000 --> 25:07.000]  They're attempting en masse to bring that down, believing somehow in a collapse, they will end up being preeminent in a collapse.
[25:07.000 --> 25:19.000]  The real alpha males that have been trying to fix things and trying to create prosperity are going to absolutely turn into monsters and destroy you.
[25:20.000 --> 25:29.000]  History shows that. But again, this has happened before in decadent, tolerant societies. The strong become passive, the weak become aggressive.
[25:29.000 --> 25:37.000]  As the Bible says, children will rule over your parents, women will rule over the men. This happened in other cultures.
[25:38.000 --> 25:53.000]  And then it blooms because of the massively spoiled rotten society and then it collapses and then super hyper road warrior, lowest common denominator alpha male physical garbage takes over instead of super alpha.
[25:53.000 --> 26:06.000]  That's, you know, spacesuits and jet packs and cancer cures. So what happens is masses of people generally take the restraint of hyper alpha males that actually want to build big open free societies.
[26:07.000 --> 26:14.000]  They see that as weakness. They pull it down and then they open the gate for the monsters to come in. The Marauders.
[26:14.000 --> 26:25.000]  And that leads me to the next big story I'm going to cover when we come back. Swedish liberal party. It's one of the big parties there wants to legalize necrophilia and child porn info wars.com story.
[26:26.000 --> 26:32.000]  If you're against necrophilia, that's sex with dead people. You're not a liberal. Well, just ask Jimmy Seville Prince Charles best friend. It's true.
[26:32.000 --> 26:43.000]  The liberal youth league says it wants to make Sweden a more tolerant society by endorsing quote ruthless mass immigration, necrophilia and even child pornography.
[26:44.000 --> 26:58.000]  Yes, really, if you thought you heard it all in terms of Sweden and their Stockholm syndrome and the progressive basket case of Europe, the thing again, during a tweet storm, the youth group made plain its desire to see Sweden adopt the euro signal currency and joint NATO.
[26:58.000 --> 27:07.000]  But the organization's social policies were real eyebrow razors. They want to submit to the establishment. That's part of it. If you are against necrophilia, you're not liberal. The group explained.
[27:08.000 --> 27:21.000]  For those who don't know necrophilia is having sex with dead people. How progressive. The L U F also wants open borders, ruthless mass immigration close quote and it's calling for legalization of cartoon child pornography, polygamy and incest.
[27:21.000 --> 27:28.000]  The group has also previously called for legalization of sex with animals. And again, this is what the intelligence agencies run by globalists want.
[27:29.000 --> 27:38.000]  This is to make the mainline liberal parties that just want to have rape by Muslims of women legal. Literally, they're not legalizing it, but only for Muslims. It's their culture.
[27:39.000 --> 27:46.000]  They're making cucking for Stockholm syndrome, the actual law, hence Stockholm Sweden. I mean, that's why the term comes from there.
[27:46.000 --> 27:56.000]  And so this group's meant to move the Overton window and make the other groups not look extreme that just want to be able to legalize having sex with you with your child down to age 10.
[27:57.000 --> 28:11.000]  When they come to your door, this is official UN policy under Nambla. You have to let your 10 year old go with them. If your 10 year old wants to go and they literally pull up with the ice cream trucks with the puppies and other kids and say, we're going to the mall.
[28:11.000 --> 28:19.000]  We're going to go have fun. And there's cartoons saying go with the adults. It's fun. Don't listen to your parents. This is now in Europe. Okay.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  And then your kid will just go with the pot belly pedophile with the PBP.
[28:25.000 --> 28:33.000]  So people don't want to believe this. This is the sexualization of children. They're teaching it in school. That's why Nickelodeon is teaching kids masturbation.
[28:33.000 --> 28:40.000]  There's a YouTube video Paul reported on last week where they're on YouTube teaching, you know, six year olds how to masturbate. And you're like, what's the point of this?
[28:41.000 --> 28:57.000]  It's getting you used to seeing adults sexualizing children because that's their final sacrament as the society collapses is aborting the kids, keeping them alive, selling their body organs until you finally a sangui ate them and then have a big celebratory joke about it.
[28:57.000 --> 29:07.000]  And it's always taught by the most weak looking, soul sucked looking adults. You watch all these sexualization videos. I mean, look at the woman teaching the kids.
[29:08.000 --> 29:21.000]  She looks like something out of a nightmare. Like you go into a subterranean cave where there's been a race of slaves for 5000 years. And you know, they're just like these pale, flat faced, um, inbred features.
[29:21.000 --> 29:33.000]  It's literal hell gates being opened. Now when we come back, we're going to play the number one video over the weekend. It's got more than 10 million views now.
[29:34.000 --> 29:44.000]  It's where they took my voice and put it to, uh, put it to folk music and they think this hurts us. This helps us and our traffic is only exploding.
[29:44.000 --> 29:53.000]  So we're going to play this piece coming up and then later in the week, I'm going to re-release it with all the documentation to what time Warner put out.
[29:53.000 --> 30:13.000]  We must keep the internet free from communist government restrictions and parameters. Why? Because it would stop memes and erase heroes. Don't believe me? Look at China.
[30:13.000 --> 30:27.000]  Chinese President Xi Jinping was famously memed with Barack Obama in 2013 when a picture of the two was compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Two. This happened again after an awkward handshake with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to a handshake between Pooh and Eor.
[30:28.000 --> 30:37.000]  Other images such as Winnie the Pooh and a car have been memed alongside President Xi in his limo. But because the meme of President Xi and Winnie the Pooh has gotten so popular, China has now censored it from the internet.
[30:37.000 --> 30:46.000]  This is commonplace in communist China. As a recently deceased political dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo has had his name completely censored from the virtual world.
[30:47.000 --> 30:55.000]  Try sending his name and a message to a friend and the message will disappear into cyberspace. Xiaobo died in Chinese custody and most people in China have no idea who he is.
[30:56.000 --> 31:02.000]  Keep the internet free in America. Stop net neutrality. Save meme magic. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[31:02.000 --> 31:10.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:11.000 --> 31:25.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[31:25.000 --> 31:32.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:33.000 --> 31:42.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[31:43.000 --> 31:50.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:50.000 --> 31:57.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:57.000 --> 32:26.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today in M4warStore.com.
[32:27.000 --> 32:36.000]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes, NAR, lipoic acid, BiOPQQ and many others.
[32:37.000 --> 32:44.000]  BiOPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies and just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[32:45.000 --> 32:55.000]  Visit M4warStore.com and read the reviews for yourself. Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third party certified review agency Power Review.
[32:55.000 --> 33:02.000]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at M4warStore.com before it sells out again. That's M4warStore.com.
[33:03.000 --> 33:19.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the M4war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[33:19.000 --> 33:27.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.000 --> 33:39.000]  It is an absolute fact that they are sexualizing our children. It is an absolute fact that the social engineers admit they're trying to break our will and condition us to accept anything and everything.
[33:39.000 --> 33:48.000]  But then we can't say mother or father all over the US or Europe on an entrance form for your elementary students because someone else might not have a mother or father.
[33:48.000 --> 34:08.000]  And they've got all these non-binary terms. They're using our open society, they're using our kindness, they're using our incredible western hospitality, the globalist are, to turn us against ourselves and destroy every bedrock institution.
[34:08.000 --> 34:18.000]  That's all coming up and I'm going to get into the latest economic, military news, Kid Rock getting ready to run for the Senate. There's just so much to go over. Hillary caught red-handed.
[34:19.000 --> 34:28.000]  The big question is, why isn't she being indicted for money laundering and for violating campaign finance rules and espionage? Big story up on M4warStore.com.
[34:28.000 --> 34:40.000]  Incredible footage of Al Qaeda and ISIS going in and attacking a Catholic church. Then I dovetail that with the Pope saying he doesn't want to hear about Christian roots.
[34:41.000 --> 34:51.000]  I've actually pulled up the London Guardian article where he actually is quoted as saying it. People don't believe this stuff when I say it because it sounds crazy. I know it does.
[34:51.000 --> 34:57.000]  But he's defending Islamic attacks. So that's all coming up.
[34:58.000 --> 35:07.000]  Before I go any further, I want to just remind listeners that we're running some of the biggest specials we've ever run for the entire month of July.
[35:08.000 --> 35:15.000]  But I told you, if some of the items started selling out, that we'd have to pull them from the specials.
[35:15.000 --> 35:37.000]  Obviously, if you sign up for auto-ship on any item, like the Coffee or the Secret 12, Vitamin B12, or the Knockout, or the Brain Force, or the Supermail Vitality, or the X2 Survival Shield, we hold it back at whatever level you ordered it at so that it can ship to you in 15 days a month, 90 days, 6 months, you can cancel any time.
[35:37.000 --> 35:53.000]  An additional 10% off. But barring if you sign up for auto-ship, we are about to sell out of Supermail Vitality, Survival Shield X2, the Gut Health Support Pack, because biome defense is getting low.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  We've got plenty of the Myco ZX. That just came back in.
[35:56.000 --> 36:11.000]  We've got the DNA force back in stock, but that's unbelievably starting to run low. We're going to have to pull by Wednesday. It's going to be pulled the DNA force 20% off, the Secret 12.
[36:12.000 --> 36:20.000]  I'm going to keep it 25% because it just came back in. The Gut Health Support Pack will still have the Myco ZX. We're not going to have the biome defense 30% off with it.
[36:20.000 --> 36:33.000]  The X2 won't be 30% off. The Supermail won't be 30% off. The Brain Force Plus now a 20% more. In each bottle, people love this product. It is our number one best seller. It's not our most profitable because the price is so low.
[36:34.000 --> 36:43.000]  Similar brands that have similar ingredients are $50 to $60. It is $20 discounted right now. You cannot beat Brain Force. Try that today.
[36:43.000 --> 36:54.000]  All of those will end Wednesday by the end of the show. I'm going to add a few other things back onto the sale that we are just now getting back in.
[36:55.000 --> 37:03.000]  Those items have to because Tim just came to me and said we're running low on all four of those items. Quite frankly, I don't like selling out.
[37:03.000 --> 37:12.000]  So now we get down to like 5% of inventory. I just go back to regular price until more comes in. Again, again, if you sign up for auto, ship an additional 10% off.
[37:13.000 --> 37:20.000]  But these are amazing supplements and you know it's going to fund an organization that is committed to fighting the globalist and that is getting big results.
[37:20.000 --> 37:33.000]  High quality products. Very affordable prices. Funding the tip of the spear for human liberty. Getting results. Changing history together. Win, win, win, win, win. Total 360 win.
[37:33.000 --> 37:52.000]  Not some delusional, fancy guru positivity, but real action, real force of nature, real strength with all of us together working together, focused together, spreading the word together, getting intel together and supporting each other.
[37:52.000 --> 38:02.000]  We're unstoppable with God's grace.
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.000]  I just cut liners for five new stations this morning that have picked us up and I want to tell our stations I know over the years I have not serviced you properly.
[38:10.000 --> 38:23.000]  I've been so busy and so focused and working with GCN, nothing against them. I just, they get busy. I get busy there in Minnesota. I'm in Texas and sometimes I haven't cut liners. I haven't been on your stations as a guest.
[38:24.000 --> 38:38.000]  I haven't done the things I should do the other talk show hosts do because I've been in the trenches. I apologize for that. I've hired two people to do affiliate relations and I've hired two people to help me service the stations.
[38:38.000 --> 38:47.000]  And so now, in fact, I didn't mean to do this. I just thought of this. Will you go ask David for his email? I know what it is, but I want to double check. I'm giving the right one out.
[38:48.000 --> 39:00.000]  I want to give out to our affiliates these emails where you can send your liners, send your interview request. I'll give it at the start of the next segment so that we can service you properly.
[39:00.000 --> 39:10.000]  Sure, the general email is affiliates at Info Wars. I was going to give you some of these new guys who are great guys, some of the biggest networks in the country, their info.
[39:11.000 --> 39:19.000]  We got two people now working full time to make sure I do the liners. If you've got local sponsors that I agree with the product on, I'll voice it for you.
[39:19.000 --> 39:30.000]  I will come to local affiliates that have been carrying us for at least a year and then have done good in the ratings, which all of them do. I will come on your local station and do interviews.
[39:31.000 --> 39:40.000]  I am going to make up for 20 plus years of being so grassroots that I couldn't service our affiliates properly. I appreciate you. I apologize for not doing it.
[39:40.000 --> 39:52.000]  We've gone over 200 affiliates and now that's the missing link is cutting promos, cutting liners and doing that. I mean, I've done some of that over the years, but I am really going to be committed to doing it now.
[39:53.000 --> 40:06.000]  I've hired two people. Nothing against GCN. They're still doing affiliate relations as well, but I'm taking basically the entire production over myself because outside of GCN, I'm going to be launching some new radio and TV shows.
[40:06.000 --> 40:14.000]  I'm going to work with them if they want to carry them. That's fine. I still like GCN. They're great. They're in Minnesota. I need to be able to run things myself here.
[40:15.000 --> 40:21.000]  I told Ted this about a year ago. I officially let him know about six months ago that I'm going to be launching my own network, my own shows.
[40:21.000 --> 40:39.000]  We can be in full control of it. I'm still a partner with GCN. They're great guys. There's no middleman here now. Affiliates at infowars.com. I want to send out to all the stations care packages of videos, books, water filtration systems.
[40:39.000 --> 40:52.000]  I just ran into the manager of Barton Springs Saturday. I was there with my children and the manager came over and said he ordered a propure about four years ago and they loved it. They would take the spring water out and drink it and how great it was.
[40:53.000 --> 41:02.000]  Then he said that somebody dropped it and broke the filters. I'm going to deliver it today. Barton Springs is a free propure because that's what it's all about.
[41:02.000 --> 41:15.000]  If you want a fun package of t-shirts and books and videos, DVDs, we will send it out to every station out there. Just tell us what you want, station managers, station owners, and you're going to get it.
[41:16.000 --> 41:27.000]  I got two people full time ready to take care of you. The stations are really, really responding. I'm going to change the clock soon too. I was pigheaded. I was very pigheaded.
[41:27.000 --> 41:38.000]  20 years ago, Ted Anderson said, this is the clock you need. All the stations carry news. They come in at six after. I said, I don't want to carry government propaganda because all there was was Fox and CBS.
[41:39.000 --> 41:49.000]  I said, I don't want to carry that. He said, okay, later they got USA Radio Network. That's better. We always have that weird clock. We have a five minute segment and then three minutes of ads and I come in at eight after.
[41:49.000 --> 41:58.000]  And then we're going to send out to the affiliates to the next few days, new clock. It's the standard radio clock to make sure you like it. We're going to be going to the standard radio clock for everybody.
[41:59.000 --> 42:12.000]  We're going to do all that stuff. So very, very exciting, very, very pleased to be doing that. And the stations are a static because we have at least 50 emails last year from stations saying, we will carry your show.
[42:12.000 --> 42:21.000]  You must go to the regular clock. You must go to the regular clock. You must go to the regular clock. And I don't know why I never did it.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  Wow. I want all those stations. I'm going to do that. And now we can produce every day twice a day.
[42:29.000 --> 42:41.000]  Three minutes of info wars news with the radio minutes you hear together those vignettes to have original news if the stations choose to carry it or they can carry whatever other news they want.
[42:42.000 --> 42:52.000]  So very, very exciting. We're going to launch David Knight show on the new clock coming up on September 20th. I think it's the date. No, no, no.
[42:52.000 --> 43:01.000]  August 20th. I'm going from memory or teleprompter free. And then we're going to launch new shows in September as well. So a lot of exciting things coming up.
[43:02.000 --> 43:10.000]  I'm done basically ranting about that. It's just that it's not just about taking care of info wars and our operations. It's about also helping our local stations and local affiliates.
[43:10.000 --> 43:27.000]  So please make donations to local stations. Please thank them, become a sponsor, support their sponsors and let them know why you're supporting them. And more importantly, spread the word about those local AM and FM stations because that's where we're reaching the big giant audiences.
[43:28.000 --> 43:36.000]  Oh, more good news. The federal election commission, the Democrats have called for me to be criminally investigated last week.
[43:36.000 --> 43:47.000]  Now, the FBI announced that under orders from Obama, they had opened an investigation of Breitbart dredge report info wars for being influenced by the Russians.
[43:48.000 --> 43:59.000]  That is a criminal investigation. It doesn't mean we're criminals. It is a criminal investigation. It's totally made up. It's like investigating me for being a Martian spy or a spy from, you know, Obama's Uranus.
[43:59.000 --> 44:09.000]  That said, the Republican controlled group came out and said this is a witch hunt. Americans have free speech. This is asinine. These websites have been around for decades.
[44:10.000 --> 44:17.000]  The American people elected Trump, not Russia and basically stop your fear mongering. The proper slapdown.
[44:17.000 --> 44:28.000]  So that is very exciting. But know this, there are dirty tricks. There is harassment. There is garbage that goes on behind the scenes and try to shut down our affiliates to try to get them to not carry us.
[44:29.000 --> 44:36.000]  That's why it's important to pray for those stations, appreciate them and know that they're standing up for this country and that we should stand up with them.
[44:36.000 --> 44:48.000]  So make that commitment to support our affiliates today now more than ever because the broadcast is growing, but we need to cover our flanks, not just our main attack force.
[44:48.000 --> 45:07.000]  Okay. I want to get back into the decadence. I want to get back into how they're trying to brainwash the public, how they're trying to make us hopeless, how they're trying to collapse society to then bring in total tyranny after the break.
[45:07.000 --> 45:24.000]  But before I go any further, I'm going to put on screen a screenshot from this morning from Super Deluxe that's owned by Time Warner that puts out some comical videos where there's four, excuse me, five plus million views of this video.
[45:24.000 --> 45:39.000]  5.5 million views. Now, if you go to their other site, there's three million downloads and if you go to their YouTube, there's another half million views. So you add that together. That's over eight million views.
[45:40.000 --> 45:49.000]  And the view counts are usually a day or two behind. I said Saturday that it had seven million views because it did. A whole new story began that I was lying about that.
[45:49.000 --> 46:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've produced films that have been viewed over a hundred million times. Paul Watson has created videos that get seen 35 million times. They can't stand the fact that our content is number one.
[46:01.000 --> 46:15.000]  I just showed you one platform 5.5 that went up Saturday morning. You'll have 20 million views in a week. People say it's a hit piece. No, it's not. The corporate guys are old and dumb. And by old, I mean old thinking. They think this stuff hurts me.
[46:15.000 --> 46:27.000]  This stuff only helps me. Okay. And so I know it sends people to hear what I've actually said when I'm actually doing. I've been through this so long, I know.
[46:28.000 --> 46:36.000]  And the people making it, by the way, they know it's helping us. They're huge fans. You go to Super Deluxe. It's super liberal and super trending. They now have totally woken up.
[46:36.000 --> 46:46.000]  We can see them coming in. We can see the demographics off our Google systems that the liberals are now listening and they love it and we're actually waking them up through the celebration of making fun of each other.
[46:47.000 --> 46:56.000]  CNN could have responded to being attacked by Trump like this and it would have made them super popular. I love it. I've always loved it. I love being made fun of by my children.
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.000]  I love being made fun of by my wife. I love making fun of my friends. It's good nature.
[47:00.000 --> 47:10.000]  Now, this is some nasty topics they put in there and I'm going to take it this week. Rob do this with McBrain and we're going to add documents and video clips to everything I say.
[47:11.000 --> 47:20.000]  Everything I say. I'm going to show you potbellied people with green colored skin screaming, I love Satan. I kill my children and then howling.
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.000]  I'm going to show you them keeping babies alive and harvesting their organs. I'm going to show you everything I say in this video.
[47:26.000 --> 47:36.000]  But no, this was the number one video this weekend with eight plus, probably nine million if you add it all together and there are a few days behind.
[47:37.000 --> 47:46.000]  When the counters update, you watch in a few days, it'll be 50 million views total, 20 million on one platform, 15 on another, 10 on another.
[47:46.000 --> 47:57.000]  I know how these algorithms work. So imagine, imagine this is bigger than any movie that's out right now and it's meant to be an attack by the corporates, but only makes us greater.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper. Here it is, super deluxe.
[48:01.000 --> 48:15.000]  That's why we're trying to do simple things pointing out that we're meant to be a nature to be natural and this is where you find the source that God made to transcend the new world order.
[48:15.000 --> 48:31.000]  And that's why they want to try to keep us out of it.
[48:45.000 --> 48:54.000]  We do.
[49:15.000 --> 49:32.000]  That's me walking on River Rocks.
[49:45.000 --> 50:00.000]  That's why we're trying to do simple things pointing out that we're meant to be a nature to be natural and this is where you find the source that God made to transcend the new world order.
[50:00.000 --> 50:15.000]  That's why we're trying to do simple things pointing out that we're meant to be a natural and this is where you find the source that God made to transcend the new world order.
[50:15.000 --> 50:30.000]  That's why we're trying to do simple things pointing out that we're meant to be a nature to be natural and this is where you find the source that God made to transcend the new world order.
[50:30.000 --> 50:45.000]  That's why we're trying to do simple things pointing out that we're meant to be a natural and this is where you find the source that God made to transcend the new world order.
[50:45.000 --> 51:00.000]  That's why we're trying to do simple things pointing out that we're meant to be a natural and this is where you find the source that God made to transcend the new world order.
[51:00.000 --> 51:15.000]  That's like that's a sign of our victory.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  Your family deserves the best.

[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  Fullycookedbacon.com
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  Go Berkey.com
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.000]  Easy, affordable, effective.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  I'm told her and Obama just stink.
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.000]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[54:43.000 --> 55:04.000]  I can't wait for the full album and the word is that the album is being produced.
[55:04.000 --> 55:13.000]  This is the 21st century. This is 2017.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  This is how the globalists fall.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  This is how they go down.
[55:17.000 --> 55:27.000]  Because they all are such narcissists, they take themselves so seriously and they're all trying to project this image of power and invincibility.
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.000]  They can't stand it when they get made fun of.
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  I get all these calls going, how are you taking this?
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.000]  I am loving it.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  You go look at the comments.
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  I read hundreds of them on Facebook and on YouTube of the, you know, 8-9 million views.
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  And it's, I used to hate Alex. I love him now.
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  And I went and listened to a show and it actually makes a lot of sense.
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  Why, why didn't I see this?
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  And they're putting it out to hurt me.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  But I've talked to people at these companies.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  Not at Super Deluxe, but a bunch of them.
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  They're like, oh, we totally know you're on target.
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  We know you're not some, you know, crazy right winger.
[56:01.000 --> 56:02.000]  We know you're a libertarian.
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.000]  We're all controlled.
[56:03.000 --> 56:04.000]  We hate it.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  Our bosses are so dumb though.
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.000]  They think stuff like this hurts you and they let us put it out.
[56:09.000 --> 56:20.000]  I almost don't want to let folks know the secrets, but it's just absolutely amazing.
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  And I can't even keep track of Colbert and The Daily Show.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  I mean, I saw last week, three or four clips that I didn't even have time to watch all of them,
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  where they're attacking me and making fun of me all over entertainment, television,
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  and misrepresenting what I stand for.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  Everybody knows they're liars and they're just coming and finding the truth.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  There's very small groups of minority people.
[56:42.000 --> 56:50.000]  I don't mean minority racially, but, you know, small minorities of liberals that really believe
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  that if you're being made fun of, you're not in the cool kid class.
[56:53.000 --> 57:02.000]  No, when everyone's talking about you and you're changing the world and your listeners just got a rebel president elected
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  and the economy's coming back, that's called really winning.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  And I don't get up here and talk about myself winning to be on a power trip.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  I want you to know you're winning.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  You've broken with the globalist.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  You're not a conservative.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  You're not a liberal.
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.000]  You're a person that just wants common sense and prosperity.
[57:21.000 --> 57:29.000]  The problem is they've gotten a lot of the so-called lefts hyped up into a position where they think being nasty,
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  being mean, being hateful.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  John Bowen did a report.
[57:31.000 --> 57:37.000]  We're going to play in the first five minutes of the next hour about proof that liberals commit more crimes than any other group.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  This is in major studies.
[57:39.000 --> 57:46.000]  You can just search engine liberals six times more likely to not give to charity nine times more likely to steal.
[57:46.000 --> 57:49.000]  I tend to always flip that statistic in my head.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  You got a search engine that for me.
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.000]  It's like BBC, Toronto Star.
[57:54.000 --> 58:00.000]  I mean, they've done Canadian, US, British, German, Australian, Chinese, Russian studies.
[58:00.000 --> 58:10.000]  And they always find between six, nine, 10 times more likely for liberals to say they're giving to charity, but they don't.
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  Say they're against stealing, but they steal.
[58:12.000 --> 58:13.000]  Just search engine.
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.000]  Conservatives give the biggest tips.
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  It's a fact.
[58:19.000 --> 58:24.000]  I've had waiters come over and go, you know, I used to be kind of a big liberal until I learned liberals don't tip.
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.000]  They're really stingy people.
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  Liberals are meaner, cheaper, more willing to steal than conservatives.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  And then it links to some of the studies.
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.000]  Yeah.
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  All right.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  And again, that's modern terms.
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.000]  Those aren't liberals.
[58:37.000 --> 58:43.000]  Those are follower trendies that don't know why they're not successful because they're not trailblazers.
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  They're not innovators.
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.000]  That's what we are.
[58:45.000 --> 58:46.000]  We're not conservative.
[58:46.000 --> 58:47.000]  We're not liberal.
[58:47.000 --> 58:48.000]  We're innovators.
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  We're rugged individuals.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  We're fire-breathing.
[58:54.000 --> 59:04.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[59:09.000 --> 59:18.000]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[59:20.000 --> 59:24.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[59:24.000 --> 59:30.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[59:30.000 --> 59:47.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[59:47.000 --> 59:50.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[59:50.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield InfowarsLive.com.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  Here's John Bowne's powerful report.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Clinton is to lead the Democratic Party in 2018 midterm elections, which pretty much the campaigning force started in the last few weeks. She has incredible negative numbers.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  She has a lot of nominations from him, but it gets better. Nancy Pelosi is to be the co-head.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  With her, along with, you can't make this up, Elizabeth Warren, a.k.a. Pocahontas.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  All incredibly unpopular, even in their own party, and they've tried to unseat, obviously, Nancy Pelosi.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  They've tried to have Hillary put out the pasture, but it doesn't happen.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  But you know what? Maybe it's good to keep the old guard in because even though they're super unpopular, if you look at who's coming up next, it's even more frightening.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  Linda Sarsour, who has at least three close family members in Israeli prisons for terrorism, because this, ladies and gentlemen, is a Palestinian, which means basically a vagabond in the Middle East.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  Saudi Arabia won't take him. Jordan won't take him. Egypt won't take him. Syria won't take him. Sudan won't take him.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Somalia won't take him. Iran won't take him. No one will take a Palestinian because any Arab will tell you, or any Muslim will tell you, that Palestinians 24-7 are trying to take over your political process.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  And wherever they go, discord terrorism starts.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  When we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad, that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers, not only abroad in the Middle East or in the other side of the world, but here in these United States of America where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  We're winning the Info War, and imagine if you start a fight with the libertarians, the conservatives, the veterans, 90% of the veterans being patriots, the police, the military, the patriots, the people with the resources, the middle class, multicultural groups that want freedom.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  You're fools. I've been to your communist rallies. I've been to your anti-file rallies. You guys look like you don't even know how to wipe your butts.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  I don't say that meanly. You look uncared for. You can tell you were putting a crib. You were never taken care of. Most of you were foster children who weren't even giving enough milk.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  You've got shriveled brains. You're six times more likely not to give to charity, nine times more likely to steal in major surveys.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Hundreds of studies. I understand you've been told by the corporate media, you're going to get ahead. If you could pull down the middle class, you'll get some booty.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  You'll get some goodies. You'll get some spoils. You'll get some loot. You're not going to get it. They didn't get it in Venezuela.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  They didn't get it in Russia. They didn't get it in North Korea. They didn't get it in China. You don't get it.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Limited free market is what has developed untold wealth. True free market will take us to the stars and beyond.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  They don't want you to do others unlimited resources in the human mind.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  We've already come 95% of the way we need to go to life extension out to a point where we're technically immortal.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  We are already there. We're at the threshold and are facing the globalists. And once they're out of the way, ladies and gentlemen, it's unlimited what we're about to have.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  But of course they're teaching us all to hate each other and kill each other and act like fools.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  And a lot of you aren't going to win and you're not going to transcend because you have bought into this either as a globalist or as a minion.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  Either selfishly as a globalist or selfishly as a minion.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  You're profane and you're not meant to pass the gate. And it's very sad.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  Alright, start your engines. We have got masses of key news and intel straight ahead.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  We're going to break down what is going to look like in a post-analyst society. Straight ahead on Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  You can also combine a CNN's fake news sign with one of our CNN's ISIS t-shirts available now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal control in humanity and its fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer emitted on camera to James O'Keith and Project Veritas.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  Together, remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that have been fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  For more contest rules, visit infowars.com for a slash contest. This is Kit Daniels.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  MycoZX is back in after five plus months sold out. Talk about next level probiotic. It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast, latest technology of 4.8 stars. It's been sold out for months, big waiting lists, limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  Nobody's got something that's good. Save 30% off of MycoZX and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 billion live in each pill.

[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  I got no friends. I got no friends that are idiots that believe mainstream media. Thank God.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  So good to be rejected by the rotting, collapsing establishment. Yeah, McGinnis is a trailblazer. He started Vice News. It's now been bought by HBO. He's produced major films.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  He, of course, is a cultural analyst who is trying to promote the return of men and women. Everybody else can be whatever group they want to be, but men and women are allowed to exist and men can act like men and women can act like women.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  And guess what? That's popular because that's what mammals do. And so I want to get him on for the next 30 minutes. Then we'll take your calls after that to give us his take on what he thinks the big central issues are in the world today.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  I mean, it's clearly the Republicans that are blocking Trump from getting his health care reform in. The answer is remove them and get more people in the freedom caucus. I want to get his take on that.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  I've also got the liberals going more and more insane, calling for free speech to be banned. We have the Federal Elections Commission calling for criminal investigation of myself, Judge and Breitbart.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  That got shot down over the weekend, but they just said that we shouldn't be allowed to have our speech because we're beating them.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  And then this story on infowars.com, Swedish Liberal Youth Party wants to legalize necrophilia and child porn. They also want to make it legal for Muslims to rape women. And they also have come out and said they want ruthless mass immigration.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  So this is cucking that Gavin McGinnis, I think was one of the guys six, seven years ago pointed out that this cuckolding is what the left is really all about.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  He was the first guy I heard six, seven years ago to define it kind of like the sexual situation where a man wants to see two or three guys with his wife or whatever, because that excites him.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  But this is beyond that. It's like a form of humiliation. And so now they're having anti-racism rallies where then the women get raped and massed by the Muslims.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  Again, I don't want to bash the Muslims. They've announced that we're weak and here to be conquered and taken over. And so we'll discuss all this with Gavin McGinnis right now. Gavin, good to have you on with us.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  Thanks for having me.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  I always get you on. We don't do some pre-interview. We haven't talked since you were on last time. I threw out a few issues here. But what's front and center for you right now?
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  Well, all of that is front and center for me. The war on traditional Western values. And you know what's happening in Sweden? I was just talking to that YouTuber, Angry Foreigner.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  And he said, the Swedish women, the liberals, the hippies, they've created this masculinity vacuum. And with no one to have sex with, they're starting to take in these refugees that are called boys, but are really 18.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  And these hippie liberal feminist women in Sweden are having sex with the teenage boys they take in in a sick, depraved outcome of smashing traditionalism. I mean, it's right out of the Bible. It's Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  It really is. We go back into these cycles every time. Have we hit the bottom of it yet?
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  I don't know. I don't know if the left will ever be satiated. I mean, you look at Iran right after 1979. They got everyone in hijabs, everyone in burqas. They beat you with a cane and they'll kill you if you're gay.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  And they're still not satisfied. They're still giving people fines every day and lashes for daring to not perfectly adhere to Islam. And I think it shows that both Islam and the left are totally insatiable.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  I don't think they'll ever be satisfied. I mean, look what's going on right now. There was a big talk last week about the Guardian. They had this article and it said, the best thing you can do for the environment is to stop having babies.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  And they show three white kids there. The only time you don't see diversity in baby pictures. And then in the same breath, they're saying, we need more refugees. Bring in refugees. We're not replenishing our population.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  Now, when you juxtapose those two next to each other, what does that say? It says, let's eradicate ourselves and get replaced.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  You're right. And you know, I was just thinking of a major feminist magazine called Medusa two weeks ago came out and said, if you're white and have a white boyfriend, that's not good.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  Because whites are inherently the cause of all problems. This is white people publishing mainly the magazine. But if you're having a white baby, abort it.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  So it's now a religious sacrament to kill white babies. I mean, I think we're far from hitting the bottom here.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  Yeah, I think you're right. I mean, look at South Africa. I was at a bar the other day and someone there was wine vendors trying to sell to the bartender.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  And he goes, no, I don't want any wine from South Africa. Now they abolish apartheid a quarter of a century ago.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  Right now they have a new apartheid where whites can't get up in the world. They live in these refugee camps.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  And I'm sorry to make everything racial, but South Africa is a great example of what happens when you decide you're going to declare revenge on a group of people.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  So is Jim Bobway. Jim Bobway ran it all the white farmers and now they have like five million times inflation.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  Total and utter decay there of cheeseburger and Zimbabwe is 14 million of their dollars.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  A long distance call is also in the millions of dollars.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  So I keep saying to these liberals who just hate themselves and hate the West, what do you have to replace it?
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  I understand you want to sabotage us. I understand the women's marches in bed with Linda Sarsour because they see her as an effective weapon in eradicating traditionalism.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  But what's your plan B? And you realize they don't have a plan B.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  They're just like the black bloc. They're just like Antifa. They want to burn Western society to the ground.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  They want to remove all the statues. They want to burn all the books, but they have no plan B.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  And you know what happens when you do that? You create a vacuum and a worst case scenario sneaks in and that's Sharia.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  How do you think Trump's doing six months in? I think he's crushed ISIS, three trillion in the stock market, 60 plus percent reduction in illegals coming across,
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  pulling us out of the carbon taxes. I mean, other than the Republicans blocking him on tax cuts and Obamacare, I give him a 99 basically.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  I was thinking this morning, he was the liberals creation. He's like the toxic Avenger and he's a mutant.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  And they keep saying to us, they go, he's not presidential. And I say, we tried presidential. We brought you Mitt Romney.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  I don't think the guys ever had a beer. We brought you Ted Cruz. I'm not sure he's had sex with anyone but his wife.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  Perfect Jesus figures and the media ate them alive.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  All right. So in our lab, we created a monster and this beast is just destroying the mainstream media. I mean, CNN is done.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  And his wife speaks five languages. It's like a diplomatic, just a nuclear weapon dominating. And so now out of the mutant slurry,
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  out of the cesspit of a poison comes Kid Rock, which the polls already shows probably going to win and they're going into total hissy fits.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  What did you think was going to happen, liberals? We kept trying to play fair. You kept cheating.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  All right, we're going to bring out the monsters, unleash the Kraken. And by the way, while he's doing great with all the culture wars,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  I'm just seeing nothing but jobs and the Dow is up. I mean, he talked to it. There's fun little metrics.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  Like he talked to someone in real estate and they go, I was facing, I was worried about, I'd have to get a new career back before 2016.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  And now the houses are just flying off the shelves. The economy is booming.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  That's what that's my biggest issue is every metric shows we went from going into a depression, a recession in most areas to now the engines turning back on.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  It's sputtering some, but it's roaring back to life. And they're going, no, no, no, no, take your foot off the accelerator.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  No, no, no, no, turn it off. And every metric shows that the economy is coming back and we're crushing radical Islam and we're bringing in immigrants
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  that, you know, that don't have criminal records. We're doing common sense things and they're just freaking out.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  Well, you know, leaders have a lot of power and my ideal scenario is there is no White House. There is no Department of Education.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  There is no Department of Energy. It's all privatized, but you need someone doing something.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  And if you look up in Canada, you can see what happens when you have an incompetent leader.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  He's giving $10 million to a terrorist Omar Kader, whose family lived with Osama bin Laden.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  We stopped out there telling folks about this guy because he's letting people out of prison that reportedly have killed like unarmed medics in the army.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  And tell folks about this.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  He killed Chris Spears. I think it was a Marine who was trying to save him. He shot a medic in the eye.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  He's lost his vision in that eye. Yet when we get there, this terrorist who was throwing bombs at Americans, we pick him up.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  We air helicopter him to Germany. We fix his eye. Then he goes to Abu Ghraib because he's a terrorist.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  And Canada is so embarrassed that he had an uncomfortable time there.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  Meanwhile, he said killing Chris Spears was the best thing he ever did.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  That the government is now rewarding him $10 million.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  Now, his sister was just arrested, I believe, in Turkey for terrorist activity.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  This family that caters is two generations of funding terrorism and Justin Trudeau is giving him $10 million.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  He's making Canadians less safe by funding terrorism.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  So these leaders can screw up your life.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  Look at Obama with Title IX where he rewarded colleges for finding rapists.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  So the next thing you know, there's a rapist under every stone.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  I hate all politicians. I like Trump the best because he seems to hate them too the way Reagan does.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  But these guys with their maniacal spending hurts Americans.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  And let me ask you this question. Looking at Canada, Trudeau says stop being America first.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  It doesn't mean we want to hurt Canada or hurt Japan or hurt Mexico.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  If your country isn't for you first and your interest where you pay taxes, there's no such thing as citizenship.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  Globalism is where these multinationals are tax-exempt. They have their own country, country crony capitalism.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  And then you pay for everything and you have no rights.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  How did they ever sell the idea that we should ditch America first and that that somehow was bad?
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  If your country isn't first for you, if you're not first in your life, then who is?
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  How did we get here? Remember Trump was in Poland.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  He was getting attacked for praising symphonies, which apparently is racist, and praising Western society.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  And Noah Rothman wrote a great article about this where he said, how did we get here?
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  We have the left criticizing what is basically Clintonian centrism.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  If you listen to a Clinton speech in 1994 about illegal immigration, it sounds way stricter than Trump.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  He was anti-gay marriage. Trump is more left-wing than 1994 Clinton in many ways.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  And he said, we also have liberals defending Jihad when Sarsour declares Jihad in America.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  They go, well, Jihad can be good.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  And then lastly, they have them criticizing what is basically just normal American politics defending the Western world.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  And the left is saying, no, any defense of the West is vaguely racist.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  That's right. This is bullying all free speech and non-existence.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  One more segment with Gavin McGinnis.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  He, of course, is joining us live via Skype right now.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  We'll be back, but let's go out with the sacrilege that Donald Trump engaged in.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  Meanwhile, the major Islamist groups are openly chanting and saying they're going to bring us down, and that's their goal.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  All right.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  They can't afford term life insurance to buy a million dollars of affordable term life for you.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  All you need to do is call Big Lou at 800-476-5281.

[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  If there's a toxic chemical-biological gas smoke emergency while traveling at home or on your job, are you protected? Are you prepared?
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  There are over 400,000 fires in the USA every year.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  Up to 85% of all deaths on a fire are due to smoke inhalation.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  Three minutes without air, and we as humans will die.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  Be prepared and escape safely with our safe escape smoke hoods, giving you up to 60 minutes of breathable air protection.

[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  Katie Armor has been on a mission to manufacture the most comfortable body armor on the market.

[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  And we were talking about the fact that there are a bunch of followers in a cult and they're only getting more extreme.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  When you were breaking down some of your experiences with your old liberal friends, please repeat that.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  Well, I'm a member of the funny community, so a lot of my friends were liberals, comedians.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  That goes without saying.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  If you're a comedian in 2017, you're liberal, especially in New York City.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  And when Obama was elected, I wasn't thrilled.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  I didn't like that you were treating him like the Messiah just because he's black.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And I knew that he was going to screw up the country, and I hated all this faith in government.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  But I didn't ex anyone.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  And I've lost 100% of my liberal friends to the point where if I walk into a room and I'll see someone that our kids have played together,
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  there's this sort of hush-hush murmuring going on, like I'm up for pedophile charges or something really serious.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  And you keep going, why didn't you even call me?
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  Like, why didn't you contact me and ask me any of this?
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  It's just accepted that if you like Trump, you're a Nazi and you've gone off the rails and we can't be friends anymore.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  But you also told me privately that most of your old friends do say,
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  listen, I know you're right, but I got to keep my job.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  They know it's a cult.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  They're afraid.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  That's why they're not talking to you.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  Yes, sorry.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  There's different groups within that.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  So there's the group that is totally brainwashed and they go, you're evil. We can't be around you anymore.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  Get lost, Nazi.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  And then there's maybe a 30% contingent within that where they go, look, I agree with you.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  I love America, but I can't be seen with you right now.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  It's bad for my career.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  And you'd go, I'd understand if I was a Nazi, if I was a racist, if I was a homophobe, you might have a point.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  But you're basing all this on rumors from some anonymous blog.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  It's beyond that. It's bullying. It's weaponized. They're saying, we know you didn't do this.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  We know you're not a witch, but we're going to say you are.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  If you don't agree to whatever we say, we're going to shun you.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  We're going to outcast you.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  We're going to call you horrible names.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  We're going to say you're a Russian agent.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  Now they've got members of Congress, like Congressman Quigley, literally his name is Quigley of Illinois,
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  saying if you talk to any Russian, you're talking to Putin and no one's allowed to talk to Russians.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  That's a quote from Friday.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  Look, if you're the president's son and you hear a rumor that someone has dirt on Hillary, please pursue it.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  I want to hear about it. It's your job as a public figure to pursue something very juicy.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  Hillary was looking for dirt from the Russians on Trump. It's all complete hoax.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  Especially Hillary. Every time we hear there's dirt, it's something huge. Benghazi was huge.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  The emails were huge. Seth Rich is huge. Vince Foster is huge.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  I want to know if you have a secret about Hillary, tell me about it.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  But one thing I want to get back to you were saying earlier, look at our radical views that we have.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  We like the Western world.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  You know, the world everyone is trying to get to.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  We also oppose Sharia law.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  We had a rally in New York City about a month ago, and there's all these people showing up to protest us for opposing Sharia.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  And you go, I chose Sharia as a very hyperbolic example of a worst case scenario, and you don't even accept that.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  I choose the West as something I think we could all agree on, and you don't even agree on that.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  So they are the radicals. They've gone so far left that they're like some weird purple-haired feminist from your college days,
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  and they've mainstreamed it, and now you're a freak for having basically the same views as your old man.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  Exactly. We've always been tolerant. We're the real liberals, and they're trying to make us conform to their new weird, bizarre orthodoxy.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  They're like the most crazed street preachers, and I'm not bashing street preachers in general,
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  but some of the ones that scream at you with bad breath and, you know, do more harm than good.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  That's how the left is, is like crazed street preachers.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  And it's just so weird that they don't call you first.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  I mean, David Cross, he's a comedian, and we were best friends for a long time.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  He did text me, and he goes, hey, were you Zeke Highling at Deplora Ball?
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  And I go, no dude, that's a fucking screen, excuse my language, that's a screen grab where I was gesticulating and someone froze it.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  I won't even do it now, or they'll do it again. But besides him, everyone else just goes, uh-oh, well, he's a Nazi, and they don't even text you.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  This is when your kids have been playing together, when you've been on vacation together for years, and they just text you like you've left the Scientology Church.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  But it shows they were never really their friends. They were never really your friend.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  They were all just trying to social climb in the whole fake liberal corporate monstrosity.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  If I found out, if there was a story going on that you murdered someone, I would text you and go, Alex, what's going on here? Is this true?
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  I wouldn't just go, oops, there's the murderer. Now that's murder, a felony, a serious offense.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  We're just supporting Trump, liking the West, and-
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  Exactly, you'll notice the Left had some real red problems, but it went too far.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  They've gone way past McCarthy, and they're the ones that made hundreds of movies and wrote hundreds of books whining about, you know, red scare.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  And now Russia isn't even red.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  Gavin McGinnis, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  Folks, should find out more about you at gabin underscore m-c-i-n-n-e-s and also at the Rebel Media.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  Look forward to talking to you more soon, my friend. Great points.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  Thanks, Alex. Thanks for having me.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  I just make total sense of everything you said, but again, that's radical. That's evil.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  No, they're selling tyranny, so they can't have reasonable stuff exist because it discredits the garbage.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  On the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  We must keep the internet free from communistic government restrictions and parameters.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  Why? Because it would stop memes and erase heroes.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  Don't believe me? Look at China.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  Chinese President Xi Jinping was famously memed with Barack Obama in 2013, when a picture of the two was compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Two.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  This happened again after an awkward handshake with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to a handshake between Pooh and Ior.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  Other images such as Winnie the Pooh and a car have been memed alongside President Xi and his limo.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  But because the meme of President Xi and Winnie the Pooh has gotten so popular, China has now censored it from the internet.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  This is commonplace in communist China.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  As a recently deceased political dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo has had his name completely censored from the virtual world.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  Try sending his name and a message to a friend and the message will disappear into cyberspace.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  Xiaobo died in Chinese custody and most people in China have no idea who he is.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000]  Keep the internet free in America.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  Stop net neutrality. Save meme magic.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  For info wars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  This is a popular model in America.

[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal. You got yourself an entire meal.

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  Devin was on the fence by it because I've got caveman, superman of vitality, secret swell, vitamin, mineral fusion.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  I've got the body armor.

[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest. That's really incredible.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. I haven't felt sweet.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys. I love the info wars true.

[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  I saw the light. It's a good thing to see the light.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  No more fear of the devil, of the world, of the petty people that are obsessed with the system.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  The world is still here but you're not part of it. It's amazing.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  And then you see the world for what it really is. You see the beauty clear.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  You see the ugliness and evil clear. You have discernment. You're born again.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  There's a false spirit in most of these churches, though, of magical thinking, of Satanism.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  It's amazing to watch it.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  Before we go any further here, I just want to let listeners know that I am very, very excited about the fact that we've been carrying these little, very inexpensive colloidal silver impregnated toothbrushes
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  that are one of our best sellers, even though I never plug them, I personally use them.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  And they're super inexpensive. They're $4.99. We've got three packs of them, you name it.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  And that way you're not just, you know, putting the bad bacteria and things back on the brush that even hot water doesn't really get off.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  It's dying so the brush is really clean and healthy. And if you've been sick, then you don't throw away the toothbrush because, you know, the colloidal silver is killing it so you can reuse it.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  You might want to still throw it away. They're so inexpensive. I throw, I go through a lot of these toothbrushes.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  And then I noticed, I said, I love this company.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  Do they have other toothbrushes? And they said, yeah, they have a travel toothbrush with silver and they have a mechanical toothbrush.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  And it's so inexpensive. That's what blew me away. We'll put it up on screen for TV viewers and for radio listeners.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  So it is the mouthwashers toothbrush. It's available at infowarstore.com.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  Also, it goes great with super blue non fluoride toothpaste with iodine and nano silver.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  Again, those are the normal anti microbial adult toothbrush for 499. These are the mechanical toothbrushes for 1995 that is available exclusively at infowarstore.com.

[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple 82533139.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  Again, introducing the new mouthwashers power toothbrush and advanced oral care pack now available at infowarstore.com.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  The mouthwashers power toothbrush offers a unique 3D action while the revolutionary anti microbial dual layer silver flossing bristles reach into areas untouched by prior toothbrushes for deep cleansing.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  The gentle oscillations have leave teeth and gums feeling just as clean as after professional general cleansing.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  The revolutionary flossing bristle operates at 50,000 oscillations per minute with up and down motion. It's high quality, but very, very affordable.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  The advanced flossing bristles brushes away cavities, gensivitis, causing food and plaque buildup.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  The advanced oral care pack contains one of these new power toothbrushes, a super blue toothpaste, and a bottle of Mrix Essentials organic mouthwash.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  This is all you need for the ultimate in oral care available at infowarstore.com, or triple 82533139.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  I've got free shipping on top of that throughout the month of July that ends in about 13 days.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  And on top of that, we're going to have to pull the brain force plus from the 30% off because it's about to sell out.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  Super Mill Vitality X2 and more, but we're going to add some other things on to sale for 20, 30% off as I promised to do right through the month.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  So we're going to end that sale in two days on those particular items.

[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  The funder operation, a true 360 win at every level.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  Now, I'd like to give out the toll free number to take some phone calls ahead of our next guest joining us a little bit into the next hour.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  He's the individual, the scientist, the entrepreneur who's started and launched multi, you know, $100 million companies.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  He's not another politician or lawyer, not knocking all the lawyers, but we don't need 80% of Congress to be lawyers.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  Shiva will be joining us.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  Dr. Shiva will be joining us.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  Shiva for the U.S. Senate, who has now broken through on mainstream news, is doing very well in the polls and has the Democrats and Pocahontas shaking in their boots.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  What do you think a kid rock running?
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  He's a libertarian conservative.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  He wants free market.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  He's a Trumper.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  I know he's friends with Jesse James, friend of mine, says he's a great guy.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  What do you think of him getting ready to run?
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  I know it has the Democrats scared as well.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  800-259-9231-800-25992-31.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  We will get you up and on the air.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  Now, before I go any further, let me get into some of these video clips.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  We have Bernstein of Woodward and Bernstein that totally set up Nixon by the deep state because Nixon was trying to turn our economy on.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  Busted him for some two-bit burglaring idiocy of G. Gordon-Liddy and E. Howard Hunt, a few others who were shut up by the CIA that were surveilling everything they did.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  That's all been declassified.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  He's coming out saying, Trusher, Rump collusion, we are in the midst of a cold civil war in this country.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  Oh, and he says that it's big national news.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  I told you we were in a civil war during the campaign.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  I told you we're going into a hot civil war with Democrats trying to start a real one and calling for violence and hashtag Hunt Republicans and all the rest of the garbage.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  And then that ties into another clip I'm going to get to with Vanity Fair's Eric Eichenwald saying that Fox News is aiding and abetting the Russians.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  So now Fox is in bed with the Russians and this is what I keep telling the Republicans and the Murdoch sons and all of them.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  I know you want to be cool at all the New York high society garbage where all you narcissist mummies go, all your facelifts, all your unhappy families, all your failure.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  They're going to bring everything down.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  The globalists do not want any freedom or even fake conservatism out there.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  They don't want any opposition because globalism is so unpopular.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  It can only work if there's no opposition.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  And so all these Republicans trying to go along with this fake Republican witch hunt that won't go after Hillary for all of her real Russia and China connections.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  You are sticking your own stupid necks in a guillotine morons.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  The Democrats had announced they wanted you to be a failed party and only a regional party and loyal opposition.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  They want it all shut down.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  And so Trump and the American people, we together must defeat the Republican fake rhinos, the neocons, the establishment liberals, Hollywood, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, the multinationals that want to sew up the global economy and don't want prosperity.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  It's that simple.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  When they told Trump you could never turn the economy back on.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  He knew he could because they had their foot on our neck.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  They want a global slowdown.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  They admitted that in 2008.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  They admitted that in 2010.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  They admitted it in 2015 when Obama went to Africa and said, you can't have a good life, but I'm going to have one.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  They're institutionalizing poverty or institutionalizing garbage.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  I didn't come and set this up to be a loser and be on the sidelines.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  I came to sell and promote freedom and free market next to globalism.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  I know it would win and it's starting to gain traction because if you spread the word globally from Greece to Poland to Ukraine to France to Germany to the UK to the United States to Australia to Catalonia in Spain.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  We're on the march.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  The empire is on the run.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  We can do it together, ladies and gentlemen, but we've got to have eye of the tiger.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  I did a really important segment in the first 30 minutes of the broadcast today where I laid out mainline news.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  After the fact that bots major a bot is just a term for major computer spiders going out tracking data, collating it and putting it through AI algorithms.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  Robots, basically robots, AI analyzing that Trump was 10 to 20 points ahead the entire general election.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  That's how I said he was going to win if we could stop them from stealing it.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  And now they're back out with the same fake polls again.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  Eight months later, nine months later, they think you're dumb and don't remember it.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  So we've got to bring all those articles back.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  We've got to expose all that again.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  These are the weapons systems.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  This will defeat them.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  Of course, Trump listened to me during the campaign and after, because Trump knows I've got my head screwed on straight.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  Bannon, his chief advisor, is basically just an older version of me.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  All I'm doing is promoting Americana.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  You know, Marilyn Monroe, 57 Chevy's, moon launch, low taxes, nice houses, swimming pools, good medicine, free open societies.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  But the nihilists want to undermine it.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  I'm going to get to that a little bit later.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  I keep saying I am, but I haven't got to it yet.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  The nihilists want to undermine it.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  And I'm going to explain the paradigm, how they're the useful idiots.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  How they're the people that want to live in the limelight, the universal dream.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  And if they can't live in the limelight through existential envy, they're going to pull down anybody who's successful.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  Instead of getting in to, quote, rush to the wonderment and the magic of the universe and the universalness of empowering everybody who will be empowered.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  But there's a double edged sword.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  You've got to crush those that try to stop you from becoming empowered and trying to bring you down because they don't want you to be successful.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  Envy, jealousy is the great destroyer.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  So here he is, Bernstein, the Paragon, the mountain of journalistic power, perched pathetically, swollen, both in reality and figuratively, there on CNN and MSNBC and all these channels that he goes and pontificates from about, we are now in a civil war.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  Russia has brought us into great crisis.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  And I told you, the enemy, they say, isn't the liberals.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  It's not the conservatives.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  It's not whether you want low taxes or high taxes.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  It's Russia, the old powerful evil, the globalists or the outsiders.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  They're the cancer.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  They're the poison.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  They're the people that came in.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  They're the people that are usurping us and saying, we can't have a nation.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  We can't have America first.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  We can't have families.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  We can't keep our tax money.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  We've got to be under their control.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  We've got to do what they say because they crave the control.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  And now they jealous.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  We're in a civil war and Russia's behind it.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  But don't worry.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  They're the guardians.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  They'll decide who's good.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  They'll decide who's a heretic.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  They'll decide who's a witch.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  They'll decide who can have a radio show, who can be on TV.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  They'll decide.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  Just like last week, I couldn't believe I was reading it with a straight face.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  New York Times, Washington Post, straight face.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  Warren Buffett.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  Carlos Slim.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  Jeff Bezos.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  Three of the richest men in the world.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  They're all in the top five.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  Controlling multi-trillion dollar operations.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  Coming in, looking at you with a straight face and saying, we need Congress to shut down alternative media because it's too popular.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  We want Google to be ordered Congress to force feed our newspapers because they've all gone bankrupt.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  Yes.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  Imagine a restaurant where they make you go to the restaurant.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  They make you pay for it.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  And then they feed you basically rotten rats.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  They force rotten, furry, stinking rats with maggots coming out of their eyeballs, out of their hind ends.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  They cram those in your mouth and go, isn't that taste good?
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  Want some more CNN?
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  Here, let's have a big fat, juicy, maggot stuffed, rotting rat right at the pinnacle of its stench and bloated and reanimated, filled with the maggots of lies.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:08.000]  Yes, bouncing back from death only for a brief second as a facsimile of its once living vestige now only of other scruffy-less creatures.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Bernstein on Trump-Russia collusion.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  Here it is.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  The difference between Watergate and now, one of the big differences is that we are in the midst of a cold civil war in this country.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  A political and cultural civil war and all of our reporting is taking place in the context of that cold civil war and nothing quite like that existed at the time of Watergate.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  That part of the cold civil war itself is the configuration of media with Fox News, with CNN being perceived by different sets of viewers as representing different truths.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  When, in fact, Fox has changed American politics as perhaps no institution has since its invention in 1996, our politics has been changed inalterably by this right-wing counter-force, whatever you want to call Fox News.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  So you're the leftist counter-force that says we shouldn't use the word mother and father in schools. You're the counter-force saying we gotta pay for everybody's sex change. You're the counter-force that says we gotta bring in unlimited illegals, then fill them full of anti-American hate and bring in unvetted radical Muslims.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  You're the folks that don't want tax cuts for the middle class. You're the people that wanted us to sign on to the TPP and transfer sovereignty to a secret group and be the only major nation paying carbon taxes.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  You wanted us to do all this and then you go, oh, look, Fox News did change things. Fox News, New Talk Radio, had a much bigger audience than all of cable news combined.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  They knew there was a market, so they created Fox News to control the conservative movement.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  And now there's a civil war in Fox because Hannity and a few other people are true to what they want to do, like Tucker Carlson.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  There are a few people on there like Lou Dobbs, Judge Napolitano, there's a handful and they kind of stick them on the back bench.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  When they get on the main Fox, they have the highest ratings. You can put Lou Dobbs on every night at 9 o'clock, he'd have as much ratings as Sean Hannity.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  And he says we're in a civil war with the globalists taking over, trying to overthrow the government and go after us. That's what's really happening.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  Straight talk from Lou Dobbs, real, genuine, focused, heartfelt, Americana, your gut tells you he's good. The evidence shows you he's good.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  You look at a slime bag like Bernstein, he's a parasite who thinks he's better than you because he's been insecure his whole life.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  Now, let's go to the next one. This is the talking point. Here's another one. Here's another one of these.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  This is MSNBC, the same talking point. Fox is the enemy. Fox is Russian now. See, everyone's a Russian. Everyone can't be trusted, but the globalists who tell you don't be America first.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  Don't be America first. Don't be America first. No, no, let the globalists run things because we're going to protect you from the Russians.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  No, you're the outsiders. You're the enemy. Here's this idiot from Vanity Fair.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  Fox is a propaganda network. It functions off of the idea of breaking people up into teams. So they are aiding and abetting the enemy.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  They are aiding and abetting those people we are currently at war at with the Russians in order to play for their team, to make it GOP versus Democrats.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  It's not. It is the United States of America versus people who are a country that is trying to destroy our democracy, break up the Western Alliance.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  And in the process, Fox News is saying, don't worry about the Russians. Don't worry about the people trying to attack democracy. Let's attack instead.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  I've got to come back and play that from the beginning. I mean, this is the new talk point. We're at war with Russia. Russian scum. That's what they're pushing.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  A bunch of weird trendy leftists that want to start a war, hoping they can round up all their opposition, claiming we're foreign agents.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  You guys better hope a civil war doesn't start. You chicken necks.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  It's been said any society has only three missed meals away from chaos. Those times may be near.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  Think about it. Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance. That's where my patriot supply comes in. Get a four-week survival food supply for only $99.

[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  Look at this Drudge Report headline. OJ set for freedom.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  Oh, I'm going to get into that a little bit next hour. I'm going to go to your phone call and see if we have a guest popping in.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  He's running against Pocahontas.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  But they just reminded me, I'd forgotten this, that Kirk Eichenwall of Antifair got caught in a tweet he put out with Tinnacle porn tabs on his screen.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  And I had to look that up. I'd actually seen it before pop up, like monsters raping women and stuff.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  And I'm like, what the daylights is that? And I went and researched it after I saw it.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  And it turns out, obviously, that's a whole gateway into what we see being pushed over in Sweden and things by the whole liberal youth party that wants to legalize basically cartoons of children being raped.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  But in the Tinnacle porn, it's like little women, little children and big demons raping them, murdering them. It's like Satan porn, basically.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  And I don't subject myself to stuff like that. I've still never seen the footage of people eating feces. I've never seen horses having sex with people.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  I just refuse to look at it. But Tinnacle porn has literally been popping up since I was on MySpace 10 years ago.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  But just the front page stuff of like Xenomorph from Alien, you know, raping a child.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  I mean, it's the most horrible stuff and it's bombarded all over the Internet.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  And he said, oh, he was having a discussion with his wife and kids. I forgot about this, about whether it was child porn or not.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  I mean, now he wants World War III. He says we're at war with Russia when he goes on MSNBC and that everyone, including Fox News, is part of it as Russian agents.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  And why is he like some creepy looking dude? I mean, it's always the same. What is going on here?
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  I mean, I guess you watch demons tearing children apart and, you know, raping them. I don't know if that's what he watches, but that's what Tinnacle porn genre is.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  Maybe he was just researching it with his children. But just so many of these pundits just keep getting caught up in de Blasio's aid and Wiener and, you know, all the sexting and Lolita Express and Epstein and the Pope's deputy getting busted and, you know, all the rest of it.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  It just really shows what's going on in these guys' brains who are really crazed to control this country.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  But before I get to the clip of him, here's Maxine Waters saying the whole Trump family is just a criminal clan.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  And then the cover of Time Magazine is, or was it Newsweek, is caught red-handed and they put a Hitler mustache on Trump Jr. on Donnie. Here it is.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  Thank you, Leader Pelosi, for organizing all of us today who have taken some action in dealing with the Trump family criminal enterprise.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  Let's unveil the criminal activity, the unconstitutional activity of this president and his family.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  Here's the man that discusses Tinnacle porn with his children, according to him. Here he is.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  This is a propaganda network. It functions off of the idea of breaking people up into teams. They are aiding and abetting the enemy.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  They are aiding and abetting those people we are currently at war at with the Russians in order to play for their team.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  It's not. It is the United States of America versus people who are a country that is trying to destroy our democracy, break up the Western alliance.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  And in the process, Fox News is saying, don't worry about the Russians, don't worry about the people trying to attack democracy.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  Let's attack instead the intelligence agencies giving us these conclusions.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  Let's pretend the Democrats are involved and let's return to tax cuts.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:47.000]  It is propaganda and it has to stop.
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.000]  I'm serious. He may have a tentacle porn spore in his brain.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  Unfortunately, he's a conservative.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000]  We'll be back.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:09.000]  We'll be back.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  And this part is most important.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:43.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the info war.
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  That's infowarslives.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  That's coming up. He'll join us for a few segments and I'll continue with your phone calls right now.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  We've got Doug, Joshua, Debbie, Zach, Stephen and many, many others.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  Let's go to Zach in Florida because he wants to talk about Hillary's pay to play.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  I'm going to put a report out later this week just showing them hundreds of millions from Saudi Arabia, other countries, the Russians, you name it.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  Just showing where she's caught red handed taking money for policy.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  But then Trump's son meeting with some Russians about dirt on her is the end of the world and we're at war with Russia.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  So Mr. Ayaduray will be joining us coming up the real Indian running against Pocahontas coming up in the next segment.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  But right now let's go to Zach in Florida. Zach, you're on the air.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  Yes, Alex. How you doing? It's great to be back on and I wanted to just update a little tidbit when it comes to this pay to play,
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  which is really just this premeditated predatory behavior that's been going on since the 90s.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  What I think is a major key here is if we could get Lewis Farrakhan into the equation because Lewis Farrakhan has been dealing with the Clintons since the 90s.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  You could pull up the article from the New York Times in 96 where the Clintons blocked his $1 billion donation from Muammar Gaddafi,
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  the nation of Islam here in the States, in order to open up kind of a free market independent small business economy.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  No, they blocked that.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  Sure, you can say what you want about Farrakhan, who I've met with at dinner with and all the rest of it.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  But he's right about getting people off welfare, getting your own community things.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  And he's been quasi for Trump and then not for Trump because his constituency wouldn't go for it.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  But you're right. Farrakhan hates the Clintons.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  So in 96, they block his $1 billion loan and they run through the White House and they do this type of thing.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  Later on during the Obama administration, he gets another loan.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  But of course, Hillary Clinton wasn't her foundation getting the money so she wasn't going to do this thing along with her plans.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  Folks that don't know, I'm going to do a whole report this week that just details.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  The Clintons have gotten more than $15 billion from foreign governments in the last 15 years.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  It's over a billion a year and almost all of it is illegal.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  Hell, Trudeau in Canada is giving massive money to them.
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  But again, they get everybody involved in the crime so that it's too big to prosecute.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  You see, they do that on purpose.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  So could you imagine Hillary Clinton is involved in blocking money coming to the U.S. to create local jobs?
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  But yet she'll take money from a foreign government in order to, you know...
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  Just like they gave $97 million we covered it yesterday to the phosphate operations overseas and then they gave her money in turn.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  So she pays to ship the jobs overseas.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  And it just shows how brainwashed the left is because this is supposed to be a pro-minority group.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, she does not care about minorities. She is a predator.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  This money that was blocked from Libya was going to the African-American community.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  Okay, so where's the uproar? Where's the uproar from Black Lives Matter?
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  $5 billion, you know, organics, quote-unquote dollars coming into the economy.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  No, that's blocked. But you know, she could do no wrong on the left eyes.
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  This just proves that this is a surface level...
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  We have them in the WikiLeaks.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  We have them in the WikiLeaks saying we can't let people get self-sufficient.
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  We've got to keep them poor, desperate and in the dark.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  During the election, you have a clip from Lewis Farrakhan.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  Making a mistake, she has blood on her hands.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  She's guilty of the murder of Muakaddafi.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  Whether you look at it from a sovereign country's perspective
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  or if you look at it from the debacle of our troops in Benghazi or our ambassador in Benghazi.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  Let me make this clear. The blood is on her hands.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  Billions of dollars were traded hands here and someone's dead.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  And look at her track record. Everywhere you go, she's surrounded by these crazy stories
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  and Lewis Farrakhan has a clip where he calls her a wicked woman during the campaign against Trump.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  Pretty much sides with Trump. Tells his congregation that look into Hillary's dealings
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  and look into what she did to quote-unquote,
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  No, I know. I mean, in person, Lewis Farrakhan was pro-Trump.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  And then when he had pro-Trump statements, no media would pick it up.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  And I've since been invited back to go.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  It's not that I don't want to go interview Farrakhan again. It's a big interview.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  He's been so slammed. I haven't been traveling much the last year,
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  but I'll probably get another interview with him soon because they want to do it in person.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  So it's just hard for me to travel with some of the stuff that's been going on.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  As people see, I've had the globalist after me, 24-7.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  So I have been kind of hiding out in the rear with the gear.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  Thank you, Zach. We'll be back with Doug, Joshua, Debbie and others.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  But first, the real Indian who's running against Pocahontas in the Senate
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000]  and organizing in the polls. We'll talk to Dr. Shiva.
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:34.000]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener,
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  in his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news,
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  which a CNN producer omitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  We need to come together to remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:59.000]  that have then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  For more contest rules, visit infowars.com or slash contest. This is Kit Daniels.
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:09.000]  MycoZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  Talk about next level probiotic. It's the antifungus, antigeast,
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  latest technology of 4.8 stars. It's been sold out for months.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000]  Big waiting list, limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000]  and to have the California standards. Nobody's got something that's good.

[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know,
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  have terrible bowel and Crohn's type stuff. It didn't exist years ago.
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000]  Now it's epidemic, but I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000]  and come on here and tell you what it did for them, because regardless,

[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. We're now well into the third hour.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  And here's a little snip of our guess it's coming up, breaking down exactly why he's running against
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  the fraud that is Elizabeth Warren, a.k.a. Pocahontas.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  If you do the same and beat Elizabeth Warren, Senator Warren, that would be a double sensation.
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  Well, I think only a real Indian can defeat the fake Indian.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  I sent her a DNA test kit for her birthday and I was very sad that she returned it.
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  And I tweeted it out and it went viral all over the internet.
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  Because see, the issue of real Indian and fake Indian, there's a truth there
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  because here's a woman who actually checked off the box saying that she's a Native American.
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  And this foretells a person who is basically a self-serving elitist,
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  is willing to cut in line as she needs, is willing to promote policies, for example, illegal immigration.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  So others can cut in line. I came in as a legal immigrant.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  You know, my dad came first. We had to wait about a year.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  So there's essentially disrespect for the law and disrespect for the country.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  By the way, folks, I knew who our guess was when I had him on a few months ago
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  whenever Owen Schreuer recommended we have him on.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  And I knew who he was. I knew he created companies that produce hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  and hired thousands of people. I knew that they had stuff kind of like email,
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  but he was the first guy to actually package it and name it that when he was in college.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  I guess high school. I mean, he really is a great entrepreneur.
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  The example of what we want in Congress, in the presidency, in the state houses,
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  that actually understands where the power comes from the people, from working hard,
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  from ideas, from the human mind, not from the elite establishment.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  And we've got Dr. Shiva Ayaduray on the bottom of the hour.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  Then I'll go right back to your phone calls. And I've seen the polls.
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  He is racing up against her. He's starting to raise a lot of small donations.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  He's getting on Fox News. You name it. They're starting to demonize him.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  They're really, really scared of him. And the website is Shiva4Senate.com.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  So since you were on a month, month and a half ago, a lot has happened.
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  You've gotten a lot of traction. Very, very exciting.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  Tell us, tell us where the battlefield is right now, because it shows we've got to get more good people in Congress,
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  more good people in the House and Senate, because we've got the Democrats and Republican establishment blocking Trump.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  We've got the Freedom Caucus, doing a great job. We've got him via executive power delivering.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  But, you know, we've got to help Trump. And I know you're wanting to get in there to help make America great again.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  So since we last talked, where is Elizabeth Warren, a.k.a. Pocahontas in our sites?
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  Thanks, Alex. Thanks for having me on. Elizabeth Warren is running for her life in many ways.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  And it's, and the way that it's manifesting itself is that the local media, Alex, the Boston Globe, the Herald, W.R.K.O.,
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  even a guy called Howie Carr, and I'll come back to this.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  There's a new fake Trump movement, which has aligned itself with the rhinos as well as the Democrats,
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  are essentially running scared, and they don't even mention me or very little mention in the local press.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  Exactly. So now that they can't beat us, they're now going to try to run as us.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  Exactly. Exactly. So, you know, as I mentioned, I think you mentioned,
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  I have a degree in biological engineering at PhD from MIT, and what's been fascinating over the last 100 days
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  is I've had to put on my biology hat to understand the biology of the swamp creatures in Massachusetts.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  And that biology is fascinating. What it's revealing is, as you said, is, you know, we had the establishment swamp creatures,
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  which were the rhinos and the Democrats in Massachusetts. Now what's happening, Alex, is they've created fake Trumpers.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  In fact, I'm not even going to mention this guy's name. I just call him the dirty deal.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  And he is essentially being put forward as a puppet in Massachusetts, so the GOP rhinos and the Democrats will have a weakling against Warren,
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  and we're destroying him everywhere we go.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  And I've seen the photos. There's fake photos of him with Trump shaking hands, everything.
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  Exactly. And in fact, what I did was I literally had one of the leading forensic guys in the world do an analysis of that photo,
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  and it's a complete fake. This guy's literally photoshopped. I think I may send him the book called Photoshop for Idiots,
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  or Photoshop for Dummies, probably the former, because I don't think he's ready for the dummies one yet.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  And he's literally photoshopped a picture, and Trump really has three hands in this picture, but that's what you have going on.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  And what's fascinating is that the rhino Democrat media complex within Massachusetts is trying to keep me up,
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  but they have a problem because we got on Fox, we tweet, you know, we get out there with, you know, great media like you guys who tell the truth.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  So I think we're in a literally a bold new American Revolution, and every day Donald Trump stays in office, we win.
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  We cannot measure Donald Trump's success based on which bill gets passed or not.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  What we can measure it on is the fact that people like me, people like Kid Rock, people like Omar Navarro,
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  we're coming out and this movement is explosively growing. And more importantly, we're able to, you know, expose these fake Trumpers,
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  and I think that's the next phase of the movement.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  That's right, you're there to be part of the debates, win, lose, or draw, you win by participating, and then we're there exposing them,
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  we're there building a populist libertarian movement to take over the Republicans, and we're so close to winning.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  Ron Paul and myself and others created the original Tea Party. It scared the Republicans, so they tried to co-opt it.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  Instead, they just brought us in, we pretty much took over, and now there's a civil war inside the Republican Party,
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  and that's why the Democrats are trying to announce it's all Russian and say it's some outside threat,
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  because it's the only venue where there's a real reassurgence of Americana and an attempt to have a big tent bring everybody in around free market,
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  around prosperity. They're totally panicking, and exactly. He's done a great job executively.
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  They're trying to block him to kill his agenda. They're trying to kill the economy. They're trying to raise interest rates,
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  showing how scared they are, but despite that, people in major polls blame the Republican and Democrat establishment for blocking Trump.
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  And so, exactly. Every day he's in there, defeats them with their political correctness. It gets better Supreme Court justices,
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  federal federal judges. I've got AP Reuters, infowars.com, Board Patrol Union chief praises, miraculous drop in illegal immigration or Trump.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  63% now. It was 40-something percent. We've got Board of Patrol energized like never before, infowars.com says Union President.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  It's not evil to have a border. Mexico has a border. China has a border. Russia has a border. India has a border.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  South Africa has a border. This is globalism conquering us, saying we can't say America first. Well, if we don't have a country that's for its people,
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  what are we paying taxes for, Shiva?
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  Exactly. And the reality is Hollywood elites, when I was out there, had amazing borders around their home.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  And these are the same people trying to tell us we should not have borders. I came here, as I mentioned in that Fox News interview,
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  legally, I had to wait a year. My dad came here first, and self-serving elites like Elizabeth Warren, who cut in line, you know,
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  checked off that box, as I mentioned, saying that she was a Native American, to get into Harvard. These are the same people
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  who promote these self-serving, elitist policies, saying that we should not have a border.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  By the way, Alex, I mentioned, you know, I sent Elizabeth Warren a DNA test kit. She refused it. We took it on the internet when viral.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  I actually had my 23andme DNA test done. It turns out I'm actually a lot of dot, but I also have a little Native American in me.
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  It's a little bit, but I got some in me. So I'm a lot of dot and a little feather, as I'd like to say.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  So you got a real, real Indian running against the fake Indian. But I think we cannot forget what you've just brought up.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  You know, we had the Trump Revolution. The Trump movement needs to expand. And that expansion is being forced all by, as you said,
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  I think we both mentioned at the Civil War. And that Civil War now is being led by what I call fake Trumpers on the front end,
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  that the rhinos and the Dems are using. And in Massachusetts, we have this dirty deal guy who's out there.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  So we are going to expose him, destroy him, because it's part of getting out the true narrative of what it means to be an American.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  As you mentioned, we need people who are creators. We need people who are soldiers. We need people who are inventors, innovators.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  That's what the founders of this country wanted. They did not want swamp creature, career politicians or dirty deals.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  And that's what I'm here for. And I love this country, Alex. And I'm so happy that this movement is growing.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  And every day it's growing. And I think it's a fantastic opportunity for all of America to see this grow.
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  And we need to get everyone participating, everyone to support this president, because he's fighting a major war against a deep state.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:15.000]  In Massachusetts, we have a microcosm of that deep state, but I would also argue the belly of the beast of the swamp,
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:21.000]  because you have the elites here. You have the self-serving elites who come up with all the narrative that goes out to the media.
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  We have a permanent corporate and governmental bureaucracy, a bunch of boss hogs,
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  whether you're in Massachusetts or Texas or anywhere, you get these entitled boss hogs.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  That's why in Texas, one town will be free, open, happy. Taxes go to the real things.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  And then you drive into another one, you can feel it going across the county line.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  The cops act different. The people look upset. I mean, it's like North Korea versus the United States.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:50.000]  Political policy is everything when it comes to the culture of the people, and we want to get back to America.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  I don't get why the left pushes they want collectivism when all it creates is abject nightmares.
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  Yeah, I mean, in Massachusetts, one of the interesting conditions, and this is reflected in the national level,
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:06.000]  for every 17 skilled job openings, only one person is skilled. Yes, we need to keep lower taxes.
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  Any dummy can tell you that. But the realities, the establishment Democrats and Republicans have not produced enough skilled jobs.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:18.000]  What they have created is, and Massachusetts is a mecca of this, the educational industrial complex.
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  Every parent sends their kids to colleges. They end up with 50, $600,000 loans.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  And those student loans don't even go to the students. They go right from the government to these large universities
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  where people like Elizabeth Warren can get paid $350,000 for teaching one course.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  Students are coming out. They can't read.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  Again, I'm glad you mentioned this because you've got a huge education and started all these companies,
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.000]  and I'm not going to go over all the stuff you've done at MIT and everywhere else.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  This would take 20 minutes and all the things you've invented.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  But they think I'm bashing vaccines when I want them to be cleaned up and not being given liability protection.
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  Or they think, you know, I'm bashing science when I'm worried about GMO and the studies show the problems a lot of it's causing.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  Or they think that I'm against education. No, they turned it into brainwashing.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  They engineered it for an economy that doesn't exist anymore.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.000]  And as you know, most degrees are worthless now.
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  I'm saying we should have education designed for our high-tech world.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  And then these leftists get saddled with these fake educations.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  They want a desperate liberal world that will exist with their education.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  Sorry, they got conned.
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  And that's the big issue. They got to admit they got conned.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  Yeah, they got completely conned.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  You know, I was fortunate, Alex, because I've been working as we've shared since I was 14 when I built that first email system.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:42.000]  I went to MIT and I figured out MIT after a couple of years that a lot of the professors there were not as smart as they were projecting.
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  So I kept one foot in, but I was always working full-time, Alex.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  So I was able to take what I needed, but I was also able to get those degrees so I can use them as weapons one day.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  Because now they can't say that I'm a nobody.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.000]  So I did this in a very strategic way, but I have always been working and that's what creates America.
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000]  It's people who work every day.
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:27.000]  Exactly, exactly. I was going to college and I was already successful.
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:46.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:17.000]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make them protest,
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports,
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:42.000]  bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:46.000]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:57.000]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:03.000]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:09.000]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos. Those times may be near.
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:14.000]  Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:19.000]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:25.000]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:32.000]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:38.000]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance. That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  Dr. Shiva Ainure is running against Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us. Starting in the next segment,
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:30.000]  I'll go directly to your phone calls and a lot of news I haven't gotten to yet. But first off, 40 people shot over the weekend in Chicago,
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  with some of the most draconian gun laws in the nation. Why is it that everywhere Democrats are in control of a city, they have epidemic, crime, poverty and collapse?
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  It's because they're an organized crime system and the Republicans are part of that criminal system at the top.
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  But we're coming to the end of the line here where the left says we're there in an existential civil war and that Fox News, myself, anybody that wants prosperity or America first is a Russian agent.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  Let me see, I'm a Russian agent because I want Trump to turn our coal and oil back on that lowered the prices of exports for Russia and hurt them worse than Obama could have ever done with sanctions.
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  I don't want to hurt Russia. Sorry, America first. Again, none of it is reality based. So Dr. Shiva, why are Democratic Party areas such hell holes?
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  Bottom line, entire philosophy of the Democratic Party and obviously their establishment counterparts in the Republican Party is to create a party or situation of dependency, Alex. It's not about what the founders had that there was supposed to be a direct connection between us and our creator without any intermediaries.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  These people want to create dependencies like, you know, they want to create the opioid epidemic. That's what they want.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  Well, let's talk about that. You're a really smart cookie. Why have they increased multi-hundred times the amount of opiates dumped out and the very same government that allowed it acts like it's the savior and comes out with stronger drugs to counter the other drugs?
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  That's like getting rid of opium with heroin at the end of the Civil War.
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  Yeah, I mean, if you actually look at this whole concept of the opioid model, you remember if you ever went to your doctor, they'd ask you what was your level of pain?
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  Remember they used to have a scale level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? Well, they had something for the low end of it, you know, like Advil, whatever, Tylenol, and they had stuff for the high end like morphine.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  And then they created a middle end because there was no drug there. They saw market opportunity. So a bunch of academics in some of the academic institutions created that and that was their way that they started getting people addicted.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  That was the first model because essentially created a market opportunity. The entire opioid epidemic is a result of a pharma industrial complex process that they put through and now we have all this opioid epidemic taking place.
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  The interesting thing, Alex, is there are solutions to the opioid epidemic. We came across an amazing doctor who actually was able to detox people in the home and he was shut down by the local Democrat Attorney General here.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  It's a very interesting story. It's a movie coming out called Hero in America.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:18.000]  Well, please come on the nightly news with the director and tell us about that. I mean, what's incredible is they demonize us for selling organic shampoo.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:26.000]  They now call shampoo and toothpaste that I sell and coffee snake oil. They say, I claim my coffee is good. I mean, this is now next level.
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  They claim that when I sell selenium or things that it's a con game, even though you got to have selenium to live and all the cancer studies, but then exactly half their ads are for opiates and stuff that'll kill you.
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  Mainstream media is a joke.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  Yeah. I mean, starting around the 70s, you had the pharmaceutical companies and the health insurance companies start to dictate health policy in America.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  And if you look at from the 70s all the way to, you know, 2000 when Romney care, same as Obamacare was implemented, what we now have is we have the health insurance industrial complex and the pharmaceutical industrial complex.
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  And that's why they're going from surgery to pills. Exactly.
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  Now they say, sorry, we're not going to fix your back with surgery. We're going to give you a bunch of pills.
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  Exactly. So it's knives and drugs medicine. It's wartime medicine after you get screwed up and they want you to get screwed up. It's not about prevention.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  I mean, a lot of this stuff, I think everybody I know goes to the doctor over nothing and they're pushing opiates home.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  Yeah. And if you look at the actual model, when you look at the healthcare model, you go to your doctor, what in the 70s you paid what 15, 20 bucks, you got to scratch.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  That's what it was. Now we pay 15, 20 bucks as a copay. On top of it, we're playing all this insurance.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  The health insurance companies are essentially dictating medical policy right now.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  You've had the wiping out of the local family doctor, your local healer, which was every village is supposed to have the local healer like my grandmother was.
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  And they've all had to join this corporatized medicine.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.000]  We've got to get you in the Senate because it's the big corporations, the big insurance companies in banks.
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  That's right.
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  Road Obamacare bipartisanly to rip everybody off, to make you buy it, to put big insurance companies in control of medicine.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  And you're right. Big Pharma is now our doctor and input mortality is going up.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  Our life expectancy is dropping and they are and flesh eating bacteria is spreading and the opioids are everywhere.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  They are killing us.
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  Yeah. And the bottom line is the immune system of the average person is getting destroyed year over year over year.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  And fundamentally, the immune system is what you need necessary to prevent us from cancer and all these disease.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  Listen, Dr. Shiva, you're amazing.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  But regardless, let's start talking soon. I'm about to launch a bunch of new shows. I would like to seriously have you be part of them for wars because you're so knowledgeable.
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  All right. Well, thank you so much, sir. We'll be right back.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000]  Thank you so much. Thank you. Shiva for Senate dot com.
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:51.000]  Well, amazing. That's Dr. Shiva. I do array running for Senate against Pocahontas.
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000]  Be sure to get behind him.
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:30:04.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:11.000]  We must keep the internet free from communist government restrictions and parameters. Why? Because it would stop memes and erase heroes.
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000]  Don't believe me? Look at China.
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:21.000]  Chinese President Xi Jinping was famously memed with Barack Obama in 2013, when a picture of the two was compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Two.
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:27.000]  This happened again after an awkward handshake with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to a handshake between Pooh and Eeyore.
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:32.000]  Other images such as Winnie the Pooh and a car have been memed alongside President Xi and his limo.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  But because the meme of President Xi and Winnie the Pooh has gotten so popular, China has now censored it from the internet.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000]  This is commonplace in communist China.
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  As a recently deceased political dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Jiabo has had his name completely censored from the virtual world.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:55.000]  Try sending his name and a message to a friend and the message will disappear into cyberspace. Jiabo died in Chinese custody and most people in China have no idea who he is.
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:59.000]  Keep the internet free in America. Stop net neutrality. Save meme magic.
[02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:17.000]  For infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:34.000]  Hello workers, your family, your children. Through the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:42.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects to themselves.
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:52.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:58.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:03.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowars.com.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:38.000]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:41.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:48.000]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used its biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:56.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:04.000]  Learn more about infowars life super blue toothpaste at infowarslife.com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:17.000]  There's a need for a new world order, but it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:25.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:30.000]  Alright, I'm going right to your phone calls this second and then.
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:38.000]  Trevor Noah has put a new demonization piece out against us and I thought I'd play it not just because it's about us, Comedy Central,
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:46.000]  but because it illustrates how pathetic these people are and how they've got to talk about us, try to keep any viewers.
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:52.000]  For a month they've been attacking myself and Gwyneth Paltrow because she sells supplements and I sell supplements.
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  They never point out that Jeff Bezos is the biggest supplement seller in the world with whole foods.
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  They never point out that, again, D Magazine and others that first started this show that I sell coffee and they call it snake oils.
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.000]  And again, they're attacking a selling shampoo now.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:18.000]  I'm not allowed to sell fluoride free toothpaste that's made by the same manufacturer as Tom's of Maine with iodine and colloidal silver,
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  you know, they have known antibacterial health benefits.
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  But see, I am allowed.
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  They're not God and people know the value despite what they say and do.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  So we have the new mechanical toothbrush that has embedded colloidal silver in it, mouthwashers, 3D action flossing bristle,
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:44.000]  put up with the same folks that have the little disposable ones that we sell that have colloidal silver in them.
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  And we have that discounted when you get it with our super blue fluoride free toothpaste that is now back in stock.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  You can also get our 10 to 1 mouthwash that is organic, essential oils from Immersed Essentials.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  10 to 1 stimulates gums.
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  It's amazing.
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.000]  People just love it.
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  It's real strong though.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  More like 20 to 1, I think they say it's 10 to 1.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  You can get all those discounted in the advanced oral care pack or get them by themselves at infowarslife.com or by calling triple 825-33139.
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.000]  We can't run this operation so you get great products while funding the true tip of the spear.
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000]  Free shipping throughout the month of July as well.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:28.000]  And a bunch of specials due in Wednesday because we're selling out of Brainforce, X2, SuperMail and other products that should be back in within a month or so,
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:32.000]  but we can't continue those specials because they are running out.
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  So take advantage of that today and thank you for the support.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  Now, let's go to calls.
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  Let's talk to who's been holding the longest here.
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  Is it Doug?
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  Is it Joshua?
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:42.000]  Is it Debbie?
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:48.000]  Is it Steve or is it Mailman?
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  Joshua has been holding the longest in Georgia.
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  You're on the air.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  Thanks for calling.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  Alex, I'm just going to go straight into it.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  I worked.
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  I was a lead system administrator for a company called CPSI as Computer Systems Programs Incorporated out of Mobile, Alabama.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  At the beginning of the year, they were caught orchestrating an attack against their own customers with ransomware with the FBI.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:26.000]  I've been trying to go public since January, mainly with you since March of 2017.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  I've contacted all 100 senators, 50 governors, one mayor, 75 plus.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:34.000]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:38.000]  We don't screen phone calls, but I get, and I'm sure you're credible.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  I mean, I don't know that, but I'm sure you are.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:46.000]  And so I'll get these calls where I've got to like vet things, look at it, figure it out.
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  And I understand I get lots of stuff sent to me and they never can follow it up because we just want a big enough operation and so much is happening.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  Has there been anything in the news specifically about this company?
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  No.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000]  I've been trying to go public.
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  Okay.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  Okay.
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:08.000]  I'm going to get your name and number right now because I'm not saying you're a fraud, but we're on the radio in Mobile, Alabama.
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  It's one of our affiliates is there.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  And one way people like to get us thrown off radio stations is they'll have somebody call in with an attack on a local business.
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:22.000]  Then it'll be misrepresented in the news that I made that attack on the local business that will be picked up nationally.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  Notice they'll show no proof that I said it, but they'll still do it.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  I'm not saying that's the case with you, but I'm going to get your name and number and I'm going to give it to say Kit Daniels.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  And then you can send him some information.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  So please get that information from Joshua Scott and give that to Kit Daniels.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  But you're talking about domestic terrorism.
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  I know that a lot of big companies like Google have been caught spying on their users and so has Apple and so has Amazon.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  So, you know, there's no doubt that stuff goes on.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  I just don't know about the company you're talking about in particular Joshua.
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  And so, again, I've got to, I mean, I have guests that come on and say random stuff as well to set me up.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  Everybody's seen that.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000]  And then the media says that I've said that.
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  Let's talk to Doug in California here on the year.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  Good morning.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  Good morning again, Alex.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  The Christian word Jesus must be looking down favorably on me because I called you twice and I'm on again.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  I was just talking about the immigration with a guest around a week or so ago.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  And what I was trying to, the point I was trying to make was that with this new immigration law,
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  well, we have to make sure that the Congress is going to be criminalizing the non-compliance of ice holes with local public elected and public servants
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  so we can get the real enforcement of our immigration law and make our communities safer.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  I listened to your last segment with Dr. Shiva and I was very impressed.
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  I've been following him a little bit as running for the Senate.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  And I don't know, hope you recall who I was before.
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  And I have been a local person active in political pursuits here in Santa Cruz area in the Monterey Bay area,
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  but mostly, more importantly, as kind of to educate people on our natural systems, our natural environment,
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  particularly our water.
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  So I've run locally here and actually if I decided I'm going to be running for Congress against Congressman Pelosi,
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  Congressman Pelosi in San Francisco and I wanted to make that announcement on your show.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  Well, that's awesome.
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  Why don't you, when you get a website and stuff, send us an email.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  We might have you on the show.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  Tell us more about that as soon as that website gets launched.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:46.000]  Thank you for the call.
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  Let's go ahead now and go to Stephen in Florida.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  Stephen, you're on the air.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  Go ahead.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  Hey, good afternoon.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  First of all, I wanted to give a call and tell you a screener.
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  I wanted to talk about testimonies.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  And first of all, what I want to say is I've got a good friend that he was having major sinus and all kinds of problems like that.
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  He's actually had surgery for polyps and he's just got a lot of problems.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  He's on antibiotics.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  So I gave him half a bottle of the silver bullet I had.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  And it was amazing within a day.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  He said all the green phlegm was gone.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000]  He's breathing a whole lot better.
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:34.000]  I told him to get the MycoZX and the Biome Defense probiotics because he's got issues with the, what's that stuff called?
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  The Candida fungus.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  The fungus, yeah.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  And so, you know, I told him to get that and then I also told him to get the Yontangi tangerine, which would help him a lot with his overall health.
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  That's from m4shealth.com.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  It's amazing.
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  Yeah.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  So that, you know, I just want to encourage everyone out there before I get to that.
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  I've heard some testimonies from people on the wrong side of these issues, but support this operation.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  This is like Alex says, it's your war bonds.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  You're putting the word out there.
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  You're supporting what is supporting the truth.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  And that's what this is all about.
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  And the reason this is important now, as you know this, I've encountered people, the stuff they have said to me and talked,
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  I've gone to veterans and said, you know, I've seen them wearing a veteran's hat and say, hey, aren't you glad we finally got a real American in the White House now?
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  That's for our veterans.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  And they're telling me, well, I don't like Trump.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:27.000]  And I'm like, why?
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  Well, because he's getting rid of Obamacare.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  I voted for Hillary, you know, because he wants to find out all personal information for the voting situation, you know, and they're just uninformed.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  No, what Trump's doing is following federal law to make sure he legals and dead people aren't voting, which they've caught them doing.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  Right.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.000]  The globalists came in.
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  They're overthrowing our system.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  We're not against immigrants.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  We're a nation of immigrants.
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  They're being used as a weapon.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  And until that stops, we've got to get control of this situation.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  And that's the bottom line.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  God bless you.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  And I appreciate your testimony.
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  I'm going to say this as a layperson from my own research about fungus and candida and mold.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  Okay.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  Everybody knows it's all over the news that it's causing brain tumors.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  It's causing, you know, most of the bats to die.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  Weird molds are killing turtles.
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  Fungus is killing fish.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  I mean, it's, it's mutating.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  It's out of control.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  Our environment's changing.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  These are the real environmental plagues.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.000]  And from my research and do your own.
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  This is separate from me pitching my CoZX.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  This is from my research.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  What's happening?
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  They know that candida fungus molds create these slime walls in your intestines and then
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  they manipulate the metabolic system of your gut.
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  That's what natural bacteria are supposed to do.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  And then they basically feed on the sugars and other things and then control basically
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  your gut flora.
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  And that's why people that have big yeast infections in their guts and other things are known to
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000]  always want sugar in things.
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  I mean, you see this on the news.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  This is what doctors are saying.
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:02.000]  And most of what I'm saying is just known.
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  And then once it gets control of your gut, you're being colonized.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  Then it gets control of your sinus.
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  And then it starts getting into your blood and then it gets into your brain.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:15.000]  And a lot of the new brain tumors you read about are literal fungus tumors growing in
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  people's brains.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000]  I mean, this is scary stuff.
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  Now am I saying my CoZX is going to knock all that out?
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  No.
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:26.000]  It's known to go in with concentrated herbs and knock out the slime wall where it's taking
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  control of your gut in your stomach, in your upper and lower intestines.
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  Okay.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  And just like I've got so many friends and family who obviously don't want to come on
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  here.
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  Everybody knows about robotics and it's just established that good probiotics are changing
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  the world because bad pesticides get in our guts.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  They knock out the good bacteria.
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  Then the bad ones that are immune stay there.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  They fill up the area, but then the other areas get filled up with yeast, mold, stuff like
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  Candida.
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  And I mean, a lot of people in this office that have been in the military, you name it
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  for 20 years, had irritable bowel, constantly having problems.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  I said, take biome defense.
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:06.000]  Two months later, no more irritable bowel.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  I have another very close friend who they told has Crohn's-like symptoms.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.000]  This is before I ever had our biome defense.
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  I said, go to Whole Foods, get one of their better full-spectrum antibiotics, and it basically
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  knocked it out for the person.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000]  We don't have the gut flora we need.
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  So I went out with group.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:28.000]  We produced biome defense.
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  Very best out there we could do.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:31.000]  Excellent.
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:32.000]  And it goes great with the MycoZX.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:35.000]  But since we mentioned this, I'm going to go to break and come back after this.
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000]  Here's Trevor Noah last week.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.000]  This is like last Wednesday.
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000]  I wasn't going to air it, but now I am.
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:45.000]  With some other comedian on there, making jokes about myself and Gwyneth Paltrow, and
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:49.000]  not saying what I actually sell, saying what she sells, because she's got some funny names
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.000]  for her stuff.
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  We've looked at the ingredients.
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  It's pretty good stuff.
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.000]  Up against us and what we're doing.
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  You know, group has a degree from MIT.
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:04.000]  Group has a bunch of degrees, because he has one in nutrition and one as a naturopath
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  and one as a chiropractor.
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  They make fun of that.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  Again, it's lying by omission.
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:10.000]  It's lying by omission.
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000]  He's one of the top developers in the country.
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:16.000]  But I get stuff developed by the big companies that make stuff for whole foods.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  Group makes about half our line, but he's a great guy.
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:20.000]  He's highly respected.
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  But it's like our toothpaste is made by the folks that make toms of Maine.
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:25.000]  We just go get the best made.
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  Colloidal silver.
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  My wife had a sinus infection.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000]  Antibodies were knocking it out.
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  Three days ago, I started dumping colloidal silver down her nose.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  You have her lay over the bed, put it in, and it's gone away.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:40.000]  Am I saying it's going to help every time? No, but silver is known to go after viruses and bacteria.
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000]  It's been known by every culture.
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  It's not debatable.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:48.000]  At the hospitals, they have bandages now with silver, because everything else stopped working.
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  But they don't want you to know that.
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:54.000]  I've been promoting silver for 20 years.
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000]  You go into a Walgreens now, or CVS.
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:59.000]  They've got 20 products with it in it.
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  Silver gels, you name it.
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  And it's not even as good as the stuff we sell.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  But it works.
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  So they're demonizing normal behavior.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:09.000]  Is it going to help you every time?
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  Should you take silver and not antibiotics?
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000]  No, that's your decision.
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  There's a lot of stuff silver won't knock out.
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  It's one more weapon against these bugs that are becoming totally immune.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000]  And I hope it keeps working.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000]  It may stop.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  I've got children, man.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000]  But they make a joke out of all this.
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  Let's go to this demonization piece.
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:31.000]  Here it is.
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:34.000]  It will probably be a long time before we know the full Russia-Trump story.
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  One thing is clear.
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  America is really divided right now.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000]  The big question is, where is this headed?
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  A civil war or a dance-off?
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:44.000]  For more on this deep division, please welcome to the show
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  our newest Daily Show correspondent, Mr. Michael Kosta.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  Well, thanks, Trevor.
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  It's great to be here, but just so you know, it's actually doctor.
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:02.000]  Let's back it up a few seconds with this other comedian on there.
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  They hold up signs saying, here, at the times they want.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:06.000]  See?
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000]  All fake, all stage.
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000]  Let's continue.
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  Yay, we all agree with you.
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:14.000]  Good pressure.
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  Thanks, Trevor.
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:18.000]  It's great to be here, but just so you know, it's actually doctor, Michael Kosta.
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  Wait, wait.
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:20.000]  You're an actual doctor?
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:21.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:24.000]  According to medicalcertificateonline.com, I am.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  So that's a blank.
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  They don't say who's saying they're a doctor when they're not.
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  They don't say who's a fraud.
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  It's like they say, Alex Jones is deeply racist, unalloyed racist,
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  and then don't show the clip.
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:40.000]  He just holds up a piece of white paper and says, we're all fakes.
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  That's why the royalty chose to eat off silver,
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000]  even when they could eat off gold.
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  Is that why they kept milk in cellars to keep it cold in Old England and France
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  and kept it to silver containers?
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  And they found milk lasted longer when kept cold and in silver?
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:02.000]  Or they thought it was wives' tales when the British,
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  200 years before anybody else discovered vitamin C,
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  and they gave limes to their sailors so they wouldn't get scurvy,
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  so they could be 2,000 miles from home and pull up to a Spanish or Dutch ship
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  and defeat them because they were all weak from no vitamin C.
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  And the limies, that's why Brits are called limies,
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  the limies, they put the lime in the water, in the rum, in the grog,
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:28.000]  the limies.
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  But see, I'm informed, I know you die without vitamin C.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  But see, to them, this is all a big joke,
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  something to make fun of what selenium does,
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  or what silver does to your gums.
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:46.000]  They don't want you to know, they think it's all funny,
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  that in the old days when they traveled with milk on wagon trains out west,
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000]  when they couldn't keep stuff refrigerated,
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  they'd throw silver dollars into the milk and into the buttermilk.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  See, they don't want you knowing that, they want to just make it all a big joke.
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  Let's continue.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000]  That's a blank.
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  Now Trevor, as a professional doctor,
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:09.000]  I'm here to prescribe a cure for America's division,
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  a spoonful of optimism.
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  It may seem that Americans are being driven apart, but plenty are coming together.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  Take right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, he runs In Full Wars.
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  I was told by a genetic engineer about a project they were on in England once,
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  and I never told a story on there, because it's so fantastical.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  They had tanks, people with gills, and they were little babies,
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  and they were just gulping, clawing at the sides.
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  You see a turtle at the zoo, and it runs out, and you feel for it.
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  They got humanoids crossed with fish and stuff. I mean, we're screwed, people.
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  I mean, do you understand that?
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  Pause again.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  I got up three seconds.
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  So, just type in MIT, human animal chimeras are gestating on farms across the United States last year.
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  I can show you a thousand medical reports or more from major universities going back 30 years
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  with human animal hybrids, and I was told at a conference in New York
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  by a well-known genetic engineer who whistled blue on GMO, who'd been on the show off record,
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:20.000]  over drinks, that he and his colleagues had been involved in government projects
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  where they were splicing humans, animals, fish, you name it.
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  And he said, when you see a pig with a human face, or you see what looks like a peniped with a human face
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:34.000]  that's a seal or even a fish, it is scary.
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  I can Google right now and show you mice with human faces, mice with ears growing on them,
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  cockroaches with microchips in them 25 years ago.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  But see, they don't care. You can go search it yourself.
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  They don't want it discussed.
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:52.000]  They're inoculating everyone to accept it as they now roll it out.
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  The Chinese announced yesterday, dogs that are three times more muscular created in test tubes and then given birth tubes.
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:05.000]  And now they're about to start announcing that they've cloned the humans that are superhuman.
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000]  That was mainstream news Sunday.
[02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000]  But see, mainstream media can report it.
[02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:14.000]  When I reported decades before, just like NSA spying, it's more kooky.
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:19.000]  I had a woman at Barton Springs public outside pool with my kids this weekend.
[02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:20.000]  It's a spring-fed pool.
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:23.000]  And I'm out there and she walks over and she goes, hi, are you Alex Jones?
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.000]  And she goes, oh, are the fish going to watch you with little cameras?
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  And I went, no, I mean, I just reported on the appliances watching and listening to people decades ago from whistleblowers.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.000]  I said, it's now confirmed. I said, isn't it confirmed?
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000]  She went, just kept smiling.
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:45.000]  And I was like, okay, well, I mean, are you just trying to just hit on me or something?
[02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000]  And I guess that's kind of what it was.
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:52.000]  But even for her, she thought that it would just be cutesy to do that.
[02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000]  It's not cutesy.
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:58.000]  You could buy 20 years ago in Hong Kong.
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:51:59.000]  Bazaars.
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:02.000]  This was like CBS news 20 years ago.
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:06.000]  Rhesus monkeys that are part jellyfish and glow blue.
[02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  And it said, though, that sometimes they, the, the, the stinging cells grow too large.
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:16.000]  And then you have to put the monkeys down because it starts burning them.
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000]  The stinging cells.
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:22.000]  I mean, they were selling jellyfish monkeys 20 years ago.
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000]  That's mainstream news, folks.
[02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:29.000]  This isn't a joke, but we're in this compartmentalized world right next to all this advanced technology,
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  but we can't have a debate about it because the average man is too busy talking about fantasy football,
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:36.000]  strutting around.
[02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000]  I can talk to other men.
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:39.000]  There it is.
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:40.000]  MIT technology review.
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:41.000]  Oh, they'll tell us about it.
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  Glowing monkeys inherit jellyfish genes.
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:47.000]  Oh, MIT told us eight years ago.
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:51.000]  I'm, folks, I'm telling you, I mean, I was reading this stuff on air 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:52.000]  But again, it doesn't matter.
[02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000]  Trevor Noah will edit it out.
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  And I'll go, there's little monkeys that are part jellyfish and it's painful.
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:04.000]  And they'll just go, even though their editors know they cut out the clips where I showed you the articles.
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  China unveils gene technology to create super humans with hyper muscular test tube dogs.
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:10.000]  They're not test tube dogs.
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:11.000]  Scroll down.
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:12.000]  Look at one.
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:16.000]  More than a decade ago, China rolled out human milk producing cows.
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000]  They're part human.
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:24.000]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go back to Trevor Noah and then I'll go to your calls.
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  Here's the rest of this BS.
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:26.000]  Good people.
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:29.000]  I mean, do you understand that?
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000]  Humanoid's crossed with fish, so mermaids.
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:32.000]  You hate mermaids?
[02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000]  Who hates mermaids?
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:37.000]  Now, you wouldn't think that guy has much in common with, say, how...
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:44.000]  So you got humans crossed with aquatic life.
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:49.000]  And they're gulping and they're horrified and they're in cages just like a turtle.
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:50.000]  You know, a huge turtle at the zoo.
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  They got them.
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:55.000]  San Antonio Zoo's got like the biggest alligator stabber turtle I've ever seen in a tank basically
[02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:56.000]  inside of its body.
[02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:59.000]  And it's just like, ooh, I mean, I feel for it.
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000]  But see, he doesn't want you to feel.
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000]  Now I'm racist against mermaids.
[02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:06.000]  See, I don't want these creatures living in cages.
[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:07.000]  I want to have a debate about it.
[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000]  I want them to have rights.
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:12.000]  And so I'm a bigot.
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000]  See how that works? Let's continue.
[02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000]  It's crossed with fish, so mermaids.
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000]  You hate mermaids?
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:19.000]  Who hates mermaids?
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  Now, you wouldn't think that guy has much in common with, say,
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:25.000]  Hollywood Gueneth Paltrow, the founder of Goop.
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:28.000]  That's her website where she markets an alternative brand of wellness
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.000]  that for some reason her followers pay actual money for.
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000]  I've always been that person.
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  But Big Pharma, they have drug ads.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000]  They have all their other ads on there.
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  Where at the end of the drug ad, it tells you all the ways it can kill you.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  The opioids, the Prozac type drugs, the blood thinners,
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  all the fake statins that literally eat your brain and eat your liver
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000]  and admit it to be total frauds.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  And Tylenol, that's worse than a bottle of Jack Daniels, they now admit.
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  You know, give that to kids, that's okay.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  They run all this poison.
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  They sexualize your kids.
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:04.000]  And then they make fun of Gueneth Paltrow that she dare have her own line of supplements
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:08.000]  because that might cut in on Jeff Bezos and Whole Foods and Amazon
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:12.000]  and the $600 million a year to fund the Washington Post
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000]  trying to kill the recovery of this country.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  The word is, you don't get to sell products and then fund your own political views.
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:22.000]  You watch our Big Pharma ads and get ready to drop dead
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  because these little guys are funny.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  They're the anointed comics on Trevor Noah. Here it is.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:36.000]  Ben, who has sort of introduced the culture or the media to things that people think are weird.
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  I usually make my own smoothie with a lot of different moon juice powders.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:46.000]  There's great proteins and adaptogens and things to help with adrenal fatigue.
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  It was.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  Oh my gosh, adrenal fatigue. Oh my gosh.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  All these herbs and things and eating healthy.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  Oh my, that's so, this is whacked out, this healthy looking woman
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  and she's telling you about, you know, how to take things for your immune system
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000]  when they admit our immune systems are cratering.
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  This woman is the enemy. Let's continue.
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:06.000]  Beauty.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  Perhaps nothing is more interesting than the TMI topic of vaginal steaming,
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  which was in a movie about Kim Drell, too.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:18.000]  Vaginal steaming.
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000]  So everybody's always known from the Native Americans, you name it.
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000]  Go get in the hot water, steam your body.
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  You know, they'll tell you people that have other problems with their bodies.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  Go steam for your skin, for your body, but oh, oh, this is kooky.
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:32.000]  This is kooky.
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  Again, only me, it can be your guru. Let's go back to it.
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  Wow. Vaginal steaming.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  That phrase is both too much information and somehow not enough information.
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  Well, it's pretty clear to me, frankly.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  Oh, okay, but I'm confused.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  Why are we talking about Gwyneth Paltrow and Alex Jones?
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:54.000]  Because they show us how not divided America is.
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  You think they have nothing in common, but they do.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  On both their websites, they push a lot of the same strange dietary supplements.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  The exact same supplements.
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  They just market them differently.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  Take Maka, a supplement that's said to increase sex drive, which I bought but do not need.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  Now, on Goop, you can find Maka in their moon juice sex dust.
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  But on Infowars, it's super male vitality. Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  Both sites also recommend alternative remedies like active silver,
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  oothe-thero root, and deboned salmon enemas.
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:34.000]  There's no such thing as deboned salmon.
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000]  I wonder why they're so similar.
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  Because we go out and research what's known to really work,
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:42.000]  what's clean sources and doesn't have side effects,
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:46.000]  and is seen as FDA key term, grass certified.
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  Meaning the government says it's safe and good.
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:50.000]  Do you understand?
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:56.000]  That's why we sell it because it's popular because it works.
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  And ours is cold press and concentrated into a fine oil.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  Quite frankly, better than the powder.
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:06.000]  We also sell Andrew Plexus lower price, the same as her sex dust.
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  Why is it so similar?
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:08.000]  I didn't even know she sold this.
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  Because these are the things that work.
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  That's why we sell them.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  We want them to work.
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:16.000]  So you buy them again.
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  Duh!
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:20.000]  It gets funnier.
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  Who do we got coming up?
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000]  We got Lord Knight.
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  I'm going to call this a little bit with him.
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:26.000]  I promise.
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:27.000]  I'm going to Debbie.
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  I'm going to Mailman.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  I'm going to Gus.
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:30.000]  I'm going to Eric.
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  I'm going to Craig.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:32.000]  But I got to finish this as well.
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  Hour number four is straight ahead.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000]  If you simply spread the link and spread the word,
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:38.000]  nothing can stop you.
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  You are the human intelligence.
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:43.000]  We will override the AI and be victorious because of you.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:44.000]  Stay with us.
[02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000]  Hour number four is only 70 seconds away.
[02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000]  This is the Info War.
[02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:54.000]  Aquaman Summon Three Giant Whales.
[02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000]  Not a group you developed living defense for us.
[02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:57.000]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000]  Why is this so good?
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:04.000]  that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:07.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food
[02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000]  and water and beverages in my system.
[02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:13.000]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000]  which is anything that's harmful to your body
[02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:21.000]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000]  These are all parasites.
[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:26.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said.
[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:27.000]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000]  You have the neem in there.
[02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:32.000]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:35.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:36.000]  All right.
[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:37.000]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in
[02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:38.000]  because I'm going back on it today.
[02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:39.000]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000]  Living Defense, InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000]  that's great for your body, period.
[02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:48.000]  And you support the broadcast, InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir,
[02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000]  and this great product.
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000]  We're about to go back to where we were.
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  Another time.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000]  We're about to go back to the future.
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:30.000]  His lab was green, and we would do it.
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  And Chris, you distinctively know it.
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000]  you are the Resistance.
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:39.000]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  Broadcasting Worldwide.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  We're into hour number four.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  I'm going to coast a little bit with David Knight.
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  He's coming in the next segment.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  I promise.
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  Let me finish up with the demonization
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  of Gwyneth Paltrow and yours truly.
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  For daring to sell supplements,
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:06.000]  the very same compounds,
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  because we want to sell the best sellers.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  You know, that's what works.
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000]  Just re-compound and make them better.
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  That whole food sells.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:14.000]  The GNC sells.
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  I mean, we sell, I know for a fact,
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  coming out this week, the same whey powder.
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  That a top company sells it nationwide for.
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:27.000]  And we're going to sell it for $6 less per container.
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  Same thing.
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  Other stuff, I'm selling for way less than what I mean.
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000]  But again, that D magazine and others said,
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000]  look, he sells coffee.
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000]  They believe that you're so weak minded
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  that you think it's cookie.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000]  That I, there it is on screen.
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000]  That I would sell coffee.
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  Coffee.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  Coffee.
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000]  I go to the Paltrow and Alex Jones
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  on the same alt health page.
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000]  Again, this is like just attempts
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000]  to create this synergy because they know
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  putting my name in things gets ratings up.
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:00.000]  Which is great.
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  It's great for us too.
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:02.000]  It's just that, believe me,
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  the failing dying media has to pick fights
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  with us to get attention.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  But in the aggregate,
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  they have a much bigger audience, all of them together.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  So I play along with them as I'm sucking their audience
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  out of them and waking them up
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  and loving every minute of it.
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  So let's go back to the demonization piece
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000]  with some teleprompter reading guys
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  that a whole room full of writers put together.
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:22.000]  Here it is.
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:25.000]  Both sites also recommend alternative remedies
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  like active silver,
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  urethro root and deboned salmon enemas.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  Okay, I made that last one up.
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  They're backing up again.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000]  Notice they say poison there.
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  They mix in pretty much subliminally,
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  just like they put a Hitler mustache
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000]  very lightly on the cover of,
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:42.000]  was it Timer Newsweek?
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000]  I forget Donald Trump Jr.
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  where it says caught red-handed,
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  pull that up for me please.
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  Poisoned,
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  Poseidon Extreme.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  And then it's got ocean flow formula.
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  Again, none of that's true.
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  Again, Hitler mustache.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  The Russians aren't even coming anymore.
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:02.000]  Red-handed.
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000]  Lie after lie after lie.
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  Let's continue.
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  Okay, I made that last one up.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  But we all know when you lose the bones,
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  you lose the health benefits.
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  Okay, Michael.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  Dr. Buster.
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:16.000]  So Gwyneth Paltrow puts the same herbs
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000]  in her green smoothies as Alex Jones
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  puts on his pizza steaks,
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  but I still don't understand what this has to do
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000]  with a divided America.
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  Of course not.
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  You don't have a medical degree.
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  Now, Trevor, do you know what this is?
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000]  A horseshoe?
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  Wrong.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  This is a symbol of a political theory
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:36.000]  named the horseshoe theory of politics.
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  Now it states the far left and the far right
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000]  rather than being at opposite ends
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  of a linear political continuum.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  They closely resemble one of another
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000]  much like the ends of a horseshoe.
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  So it's actually a horseshoe.
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:54.000]  So Gwyneth is here, Alex is here.
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:55.000]  Pretty close.
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:58.000]  In fact, the extreme fringes have a ton in common.
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000]  Both don't believe in vaccines.
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000]  Both think 9-11 was an inside job.
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000]  Both like birds.
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000]  You know, when you think about it,
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  the movie Birdman,
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  isn't that really just a fancy duck dynasty?
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  What birdman is nothing like duck dynasty?
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  Maybe we can all learn from the extremes
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  and focus on what brings us together.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000]  A healthy skepticism of authority
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  and, well, a powdered drink that gives you boners.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  Okay?
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  I mean, if it'll bring us together in America.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:28.000]  No, no, no.
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  Don't drink that.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000]  That kicks in.
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  The true political spectrum is
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000]  tyranny on one end, liberty on the other
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  and where you want to be in that spectrum.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  And a libertarian constitutional republic
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:42.000]  that's going to stand towards basically total anarchy.
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  But you can't ever have total anarchy
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  because then it always creates back to the first stage.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  But you want this most limited government
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000]  all based on individual achievement.
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  That builds men.
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000]  Just giving people things creates monsters.
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  That's a historical fact.
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000]  I promise, right out of the gate.
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000]  They misrepresent it because they hate it
[03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000]  because it will defeat them.
[03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:10.000]  They want to announce the CNN is fake news contest,
[03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:13.000]  an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:14.000]  The contest is simple.
[03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV
[03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  with the CNN is fake news sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000]  with the CNN is fake news sign or t-shirt
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  and is also heard to say,
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000]  CNN is fake news, infowars.com is real.
[03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign
[03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000]  with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:34.000]  available now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000]  Listener, to realize that you have the power
[03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000]  to save civilization from the criminal cabal
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000]  controlling humanity in this fake news propaganda machine
[03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:41.000]  called CNN.
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public
[03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000]  that CNN is fake news,
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000]  which a CNN producer admitted on camera
[03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000]  to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN
[03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000]  simply regurgitates globalist propaganda
[03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000]  thought of by multinational think tanks
[03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000]  that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought
[03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000]  and run humanity into a ditch.
[03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000]  For more contest rules, visit infowars.com
[03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:04.000]  for slash contest. This is Kit Daniels.

[03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000]  limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds
[03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000]  and to have it be California standards.
[03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:21.000]  Nobody's got something that's good.

[03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members
[03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000]  on that have terrible bowel and groans type stuff
[03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000]  that didn't exist years ago, now it's epidemic.
[03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead
[03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000]  and come on here and tell you what it did for them

[03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000]  The larger the particle,

[03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000]  Well, coming up, what is it?
[03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000]  August 20th, David Knives could be the first guy
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000]  to kick off the new line of broadcasts
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000]  we're going to have here.
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000]  And then coming up on September 4th,
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000]  we're going to kick off with Owen Schreuer,
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000]  Roger Stone,
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  and of course Mike Cernovich.
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000]  That's going to be very, very powerful transmission
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000]  every day at four o'clock
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  at the three o'clock central,
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000]  four o'clock eastern.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000]  So that's all coming up.
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000]  I'm going to go right to your calls
[03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  for folks that have been holding patiently
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000]  Debbie-based mailman Gus, Eric and Craig
[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000]  in this segment.
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  Alex, we talked on Friday
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  about this GOP operative
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000]  who was going to expose the Clintons
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000]  and we talked about suspicious circumstances
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000]  of his suicide.
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000]  Now we've got a Haitian official
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000]  who's going to testify on Tuesday
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000]  about the Clinton Foundation in Haiti
[03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000]  and he committed suicide over the weekend.
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000]  By firearm.
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  So that's one of the interesting things.
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  We kind of look at insurance
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000]  and of course we have insurance covers
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000]  that they don't want to have
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000]  people have an option.
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000]  So they want to put you in these Cadillac situations
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  as Rand Paul has said,
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000]  this is a super fund for the insurance companies
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  and we've said from the very beginning
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000]  this was written by and for the insurance companies
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000]  it was designed to fail.
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000]  They want to get single payer, which is what Hillary Clinton pushed
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  when she became first lady.
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000]  She tried to take over our health center.
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000]  And Pocahontas, so that was the plan.
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  That's right.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000]  It's designed to screw you over by big mega banks
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  No, no, it's not. It's something free for me.
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  Just like I'm going to win the Nigerian
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  email. I'm rich now.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000]  The lottery is real.
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  They just will not admit their con.
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  And then they want to go get more worthless educations
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  and they want to make us their slaves
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000]  because they're chumps to the globalist.
[03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000]  So how do we protect ourselves from all these chumps?
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000]  Well, you know, interestingly, Alex
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  on Friday when we talked about this,
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  we mentioned the fact that while you got the national Democrats
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000]  like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000]  who were trying to push this single payer system
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  in California, they've been looking at it for a long time.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  Jerry Brown, who's now the governor back in the 90s
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000]  was campaigning on that.
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  And he just said, you can't solve a problem
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000]  by making the problem bigger.
[03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  Where's the money going to come from?
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000]  And finally they hit the wall.
[03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000]  Like Venezuela or North Korea, they're about to collapse.
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000]  And then guess what?
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  You ain't getting nothing now.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  Once you wreck everything, you dumb
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  slobs that love the new world order.
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000]  You destroyed the golden goosey-woosey.
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000]  I mean, again, I hate the globalist,
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.000]  but they're all exempt offshore.
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  And they talk about the public
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  like they're the biggest idiots on earth.
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000]  And when I've been invited to go to the Kissinger group
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000]  or invited to join the globalist
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  and offer $10 million contracts, all that,
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  people go, oh, you weren't offered that.
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  Now look, we're 10 times bigger than that.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  Just like people go, oh, you didn't have,
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000]  you know, 7 million views of that video this weekend.
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000]  Oh, I'm sorry, it's like 10 million now.
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  People just can't understand.
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  We are for real.
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000]  Do you have that through your head?
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  Do you have that through your head?
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000]  We know what we're talking about.
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  We want you to be prosperous.
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  We want to turn things around.
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000]  We're the good guys.
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  That's where everybody wants to come to America.
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  Because we are good guys and we have a conscience,
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:29.000]  but we can be guilted
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.000]  into going along with globalist garbage
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:33.000]  because we have such a big conscience.
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  And the final equation is good people,
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:37.000]  every race, color, and creed
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  that are one race, the red-blooded race,
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  to stop being chumps.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  Be nice to people that deserve it,
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  but stop rolling over and being pushed around.
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000]  This country was founded
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000]  on not trusting the government.
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:51.000]  This country was founded on having small government.
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  It was founded on not worshiping royalty.
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  Why are we worshiping Queen Elizabeth
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  and the rest of her inbred moron family?
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000]  That is not America, David.
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000]  You know, absolutely, Alex.
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  And when we look at what's going on
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:05.000]  with the healthcare situation,
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  Rand Paul said that this is welfare.
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  This is a super fund
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  for the insurance companies,
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  but you can also see what's happening on the Republican side.
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000]  We've got Mitch McConnell handing out massive favors
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000]  to individual senators
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  to buy their votes.
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  And it's the center of the Republican party
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  that is at war with Trump,
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  that is at war with the agenda
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  that GOP voters have voted for
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000]  in every election.
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  And by the way, they admitted,
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  Obamacare has been to get worse and worse,
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  and as it gets worse, the bailouts,
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  the big banks get worse,
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000]  and worse to save it,
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000]  will fully take control of healthcare now
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000]  and manage it all.
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.000]  And then unless you're part of the elite,
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000]  you're not going to get healthcare anymore.
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  Welcome to Idiotville.
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  How many liberals have called or on the street gone,
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  I wish it was like England or Cuba
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  where I get free healthcare.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000]  Hey, Dumbo, it's horrible healthcare
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  in those countries, Dumbo.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000]  Let's talk about what's going on in England.
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:03.000]  We got that little baby 11 month old Charlie Gard
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000]  that Trump said, hey, if we can help,
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000]  they won't let this kid go.
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  Because they want to set the precedent
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000]  that you don't get the healthcare
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000]  terminated, executed.
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000]  You are obsolete, little baby.
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.000]  If they are the single payer,
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000]  they will have the single decision
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000]  as to what happens to your healthcare.
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.000]  Because we're all in this together, a single payer,
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  and you getting too much treatment takes from me.
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.000]  We have a set some pie,
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  and so yin, yin, yin, yin.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  They're all these, oh my gosh, let's go to phone calls.
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:33.000]  Let's go to Debbie
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  in the United States of New Jersey.
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000]  You're on the air, come on down.
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  Debbie?
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  Debbie?
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000]  Let's get ready to rumble.
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000]  Are you there, Debbie?
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  Yes, I'm sorry.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  I just wanted to say that the demons
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000]  in our government are laughing at us every time
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  anybody talks about
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000]  the Constitution of the United States
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  of our forefathers.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000]  Because they know full well
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  under the Constitution of the Corporation
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000]  of the United States
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000]  and we need to encourage
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000]  Trump
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000]  to abolish the IRS
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  who is the pit bull to the internal
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  Yes, in 1913 we got the
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000]  income tax, we got the Federal Reserve,
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000]  we got the 17th Amendment to bring our senators
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  from the states
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000]  elected by the legislature.
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  The House was generally elected, but the Senate
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000]  was a creature of the states.
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000]  That was when the real balance went out, and you're right.
[03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  They declare a civil emergency
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000]  every year with a sergeant of arms
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:35.000]  and that's how they ignore everything.
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  It's important for people to understand
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000]  what the Constitution is so they understand
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  that we're not under it. That's why we point out
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000]  these discrepancies between what they do
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  and what the Constitution says.
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:47.000]  Great point, Debbie, anything else?
[03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  Also, they're taxing,
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  they're not explaining the difference between
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.000]  income and wages. They're taxing
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:55.000]  our work wages so you're getting
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.000]  paid for a half an hour's work.
[03:14:57.000 --> 03:14:59.000]  We're not even supposed to do that under the Constitution.
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:01.000]  That's in the Communist Manifesto.
[03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:03.000]  Right.
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:05.000]  I'm just saying that if Trump
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000]  would push more to abolish
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  this criminal entity,
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:11.000]  we would gain our sovereignty
[03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.000]  and learn how to discharge our debt.
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000]  Great point, Debbie. Thank you for holding.
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  You're awesome. That's the big issue here
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.000]  is that Trump
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.000]  said he would do the commission to look at vaccines.
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000]  That hasn't happened yet. He's been busy.
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  The two people he put in over that are pro-vaxxers,
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:27.000]  pro-liability protection,
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  unlimited whatever,
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  and he's not going after the IRS
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:33.000]  when he's got them red-handed going after
[03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  millions of conservatives,
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:37.000]  libertarians, veterans groups, 501C3s.
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000]  I mean, they've been a true terrorist organization,
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000]  caught red-handed, their abuses continue,
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  they're unconstitutional.
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:45.000]  Trump needs to go
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  after the Internal Revenue Service.
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000]  He needs to do it. They're already trying
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000]  to bring him down. Why not go all the way?
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  Thank you, Debbie.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000]  Let's take another call here.
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.000]  Let's talk to Mailman in California.
[03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000]  From the great state of California,
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  Mailman, go ahead.
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:03.000]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:05.000]  Yes, I can, my friend.
[03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:07.000]  All right.
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:09.000]  I'm calling for an opportunity
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:11.000]  for info warriors to give a black eye
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  to Bezos
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:15.000]  through Amazon and his shady dealings.
[03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:17.000]  Yes, they get $1.48 from every taxpayer
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:19.000]  on every item they ship.
[03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:21.000]  A little special deal for them.
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:23.000]  I want to encourage every
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  info warrior out there to look up this article
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000]  by the Wall Street Journal
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  where it all gets explained.
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:31.000]  Google do a search engine on that
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:33.000]  and USPS,
[03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:35.000]  Amazon,
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:37.000]  and Priority or Special Delivery
[03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:39.000]  I think is what the name of the article was.
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:41.000]  Just like, I guess you made over $10 billion
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.000]  on the Obama phone,
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:45.000]  Carlos Slim of Mexico,
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  $10 billion to his fat little wallet,
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:49.000]  screwing over taxpayers
[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:51.000]  for free phones.
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:53.000]  And then he buys the New York Times
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.000]  and shovels anti-American propaganda down our throat.
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:57.000]  That's Carlos Slim
[03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  who was in Congress last week
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000]  asking them to censor the new media
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.000]  because it's costing him money.
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:05.000]  What an arrogant piece of garbage!
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000]  Go ahead, Mailman.
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000]  Info warriors out there,
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000]  if you guys read this, understand it.
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.000]  Once you know it
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:15.000]  and you know that they're breaking up the law
[03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:17.000]  because there's a law from 2006
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:19.000]  that says you treat first-class mail
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:21.000]  a certain way
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:23.000]  and these Amazon packages are taking priority over it
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  and that's against the law.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.000]  It is against the law, absolutely.
[03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:29.000]  But it's okay. Bezos is only worth $89 million.
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  He only wants your guns,
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:33.000]  wants your family,
[03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:35.000]  wants you sterilized, wants world government,
[03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:37.000]  gets CIA money, owns the Washington Post.
[03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:39.000]  He's only sworn to destroy you and your family.
[03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:41.000]  We should all buy everything from Amazon
[03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:43.000]  and we should all pay him tax money
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:45.000]  to undercut everybody.
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:47.000]  That's $85.1 billion today.
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:49.000]  So I just, I like Zuckerberg
[03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  who called me a dumb afer though.
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:53.000]  He said, I hate my users.
[03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:55.000]  That's okay because he's liberal.
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  Good point, Mr. Mailman.
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:59.000]  Can I say something here, Alex?
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:01.000]  It illustrates the leverage that these guys have
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:03.000]  because he's got the Washington Post
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:05.000]  and that's big leverage that he got
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:07.000]  and he got it for a song.
[03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:09.000]  This guy who got $20 billion increase in net worth
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.000]  just the first five months of this year
[03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:13.000]  bought Washington Post for one quarter
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.000]  and then he got CIA
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:17.000]  $600 million
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.000]  to basically fund this operation.
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.000]  Exactly.
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:23.000]  And then all of it pay him money
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:25.000]  on every package, $1.48
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  and it's illegal because Bezos
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:29.000]  is liberal.
[03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:31.000]  Oh, just like Apple owns the most enslaved factories
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.000]  with suicide nets
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:35.000]  on the roofs
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:37.000]  and in the stairwells
[03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:39.000]  and they force abort because
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:41.000]  they're all like little liberal, trendy nerd guys.
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:43.000]  So it's okay, they own slave camps.
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:45.000]  Yeah, and they get this kind of leverage
[03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:47.000]  from the Congress.
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:49.000]  Bezos, he's liberal.
[03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:51.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:53.000]  I mean, you look at that little bit of money that he used to get...
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:55.000]  But it's okay because he's liberal.
[03:18:55.000 --> 03:18:57.000]  He's liberal and you're not.
[03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:59.000]  He has moral high ground.
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:01.000]  Zuckerberg has moral high ground.
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:03.000]  Zuckerberg helps Muslims round up people
[03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  that criticize Allah and who are executed
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:07.000]  and he helps them get executed.
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:09.000]  I like Facebook.
[03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:11.000]  He's Zuckerberg.
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.000]  No, that's okay.
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:15.000]  You don't want to worship him? Look at him laughing.
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:17.000]  I'm liberal.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:19.000]  I'm sorry.
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:21.000]  Okay, thank you, mailman.
[03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:23.000]  Let's talk to...
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:25.000]  Let's talk to Eric.
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:27.000]  Eric in Wisconsin.
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  Come on down.
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:31.000]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:33.000]  Well, I'm...
[03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:35.000]  I'm in pretty good mood today.
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:37.000]  Well, that's always a good thing.
[03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:39.000]  So,
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000]  the other day,
[03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:43.000]  I was saying that I was talking to my wife
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:45.000]  and it really dawned on me because I study history too.
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:47.000]  And you thought about Zuckerberg looks like a vampire?
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  I'm sorry.
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.000]  Well, it kind of does actually now that you mentioned it.
[03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:53.000]  Well, basically,
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:55.000]  they are really taking
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:57.000]  everything from the ancient gods
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:19:59.000]  and are redoing it to us.
[03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:01.000]  Because if you...
[03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:03.000]  Yes, everything you read about in mythology,
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:05.000]  from human animal crosses to
[03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:07.000]  elites, you know, living on armored
[03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:09.000]  mountaintops, it's all happening again.
[03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:11.000]  Yes, almost like it happened before.
[03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  We just had Macron become a Jupiter.
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:15.000]  He said, I am the god Jupiter.
[03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:17.000]  I rule. Yes, go ahead.
[03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:19.000]  Yeah, so basically,
[03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:21.000]  and when I told my wife that,
[03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:23.000]  she kind of looked at me cross-eyed, I said, think about it.
[03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.000]  They think that it's their right
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:27.000]  to meddle in our lives
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:29.000]  for absolutely no reason.
[03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  I just...
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:33.000]  It's amazing sometimes and most people don't see it.
[03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:35.000]  Well, you have to understand,
[03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.000]  with these sociopaths, psychopaths and others,
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:39.000]  they love to throw it in your face
[03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:41.000]  and as they get more power, they get more reckless.
[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:43.000]  They're crying out for help.
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:45.000]  Not their psychopathic cerebral cortex,
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.000]  but the overall humanity
[03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:49.000]  that's still in them wants to kill them.
[03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:51.000]  And so they...
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:53.000]  That's why they always lead us to wars and death
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:55.000]  and then if nobody will take them out,
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  they usually commit suicide
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:20:59.000]  because they just want to kill everybody
[03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.000]  because they want to kill themselves.
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:03.000]  But they set up their say,
[03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:05.000]  I am the great and powerful Oz.
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.000]  I am invincible.
[03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:09.000]  But when the little dog pulls back the curtain,
[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:11.000]  well, then you see that it's the little man
[03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:13.000]  back there who's been scared
[03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:15.000]  all along.
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:19.000]  Exactly.
[03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:21.000]  And then I have one other thing, too,
[03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:23.000]  because I have been a listener to you
[03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:25.000]  the last few years.
[03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:27.000]  And how you used to tell people,
[03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:29.000]  you know, get off the fence, do something,
[03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:31.000]  I actually did because I am a patriot.
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:33.000]  So I started a social media
[03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  website based on
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.000]  read on the speech since everyone wants to seem
[03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:39.000]  to take it away from us.
[03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:41.000]  So it's called
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:43.000]  voiceanything.com.
[03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:45.000]  I basically combined it.
[03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:47.000]  Your phone broke up when you said the name of the website.
[03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:49.000]  It broke up when you said the name of the website. What was it?
[03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:51.000]  Voiceanything.com.
[03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:53.000]  That's a great name. Voiceanything.com.
[03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:55.000]  Thank you so much. I'll check it out.
[03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:57.000]  And again, folks, it's important
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:21:59.000]  when you leave Facebook in places
[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:01.000]  or create
[03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:03.000]  your own website or have a website you're on, then
[03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:05.000]  use Facebook to draw people
[03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:07.000]  into the free open web.
[03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:09.000]  It's the fake corporate
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:11.000]  cable on the internet system that they
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:13.000]  admit they want to
[03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:15.000]  dominate control everybody with. So what you do is you
[03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:17.000]  use them to then push to your new
[03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  platform.
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:23.000]  Let me ask you this question. We're going to go to Craig.
[03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  We know it's a big farmer wanting to make money
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:27.000]  and we know they criticize us
[03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:29.000]  showing high quality known supplements
[03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:31.000]  that people need, like vitamin mineral mixes
[03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:33.000]  and amino acids. I mean, oh my gosh, how evil.
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  You know, higher absorption rate.
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:37.000]  Oh, we're selling cold silver or coffee or shampoo.
[03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:39.000]  How evil.
[03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:41.000]  But
[03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:43.000]  they admit opioid
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:45.000]  prescriptions have gone up
[03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:47.000]  100% the last year
[03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:49.000]  and I was reading in the last five years, it's like 300%
[03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:51.000]  and suddenly
[03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:53.000]  I know a lot of people who I've been friends
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:55.000]  with who are just out of my life
[03:22:55.000 --> 03:22:57.000]  because they're on opioids
[03:22:57.000 --> 03:22:59.000]  and are just they live and watch TV now
[03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  and basically to take opiates.
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:03.000]  I mean, it is just everywhere
[03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:05.000]  and it's thank God
[03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:07.000]  the few times I've taken I'm allergic to them.
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.000]  I had compound fracture and stuff
[03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:11.000]  you know, shoot me up with a morphine.
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:13.000]  I started vomiting everywhere for five hours.
[03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:15.000]  I just don't
[03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:17.000]  I mean, clearly they did it on purpose
[03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:19.000]  but who green lighted let's just flood
[03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:21.000]  opium everywhere and
[03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:23.000]  opioid derivatives.
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:25.000]  Maybe it was Petraeus and the CIA when they were in Afghanistan
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:27.000]  you know, because that's what basically happened
[03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:29.000]  in Afghanistan. We went there.
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:31.000]  You saw the opium production
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:33.000]  and went from 7% in 2001
[03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.000]  to 93% of global production
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.000]  by 2015. That's right.
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:39.000]  Record crops every year.
[03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:41.000]  So what are they going to do with that? Well, they need to get some money
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:43.000]  for that crop that they're raising.
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:45.000]  So it's probably something like the crack cocaine epidemic
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.000]  we saw Alex. I wouldn't be surprised
[03:23:47.000 --> 03:23:49.000]  if we got some reporter
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:51.000]  who uncovers this at some point time
[03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:53.000]  and finds out that that's exactly what's behind this
[03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:55.000]  opioid epidemic
[03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:57.000]  and then that reporter winds up getting killed
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:23:59.000]  just like we had with Dark Alliance
[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:01.000]  and Kerry Webb.
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:03.000]  And I love how mainstream media
[03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:05.000]  acts like
[03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:07.000]  they're exposing all this now.
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:09.000]  They're the ones that make the money and take web.
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:11.000]  He was coming on my show in a month
[03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:13.000]  when his new book was about to get published and come out
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:15.000]  proving all the awards he got
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:17.000]  were accurate and then there was CIA drug dealing
[03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:19.000]  and then now it was like
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:21.000]  Sikaro that's based on a composite of true stories
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:23.000]  that's been confirmed
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:25.000]  out of some of the folks that were actually involved in it
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:27.000]  but I'll just leave it at that
[03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  and that was them consolidating three cartels down to one
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:31.000]  basically and it's admitted
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:33.000]  that elements of our government bring in the main narcotics
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:35.000]  that happened in Vietnam but they again act like
[03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:37.000]  it's kooky and weird to be
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:39.000]  learned. What they do is they take the general public
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:41.000]  that's not informed and they go don't be insecure
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:43.000]  call someone informed
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:45.000]  a conspiracy theorist
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:47.000]  and feel good about
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:49.000]  laughing at knowledge and that's what
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:51.000]  the modern liberalism is.
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:53.000]  Any investigation of what they're doing
[03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.000]  any contradiction of their official
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:57.000]  story is immediately pushed out there as a conspiracy
[03:24:57.000 --> 03:24:59.000]  theory and Gary Webb was initially
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:01.000]  when he put out his investigation it was excellent
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:03.000]  he won awards and then the establishment
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  organized
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:07.000]  a concerted effort to take him down
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:09.000]  the LA Times and others they had
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:11.000]  the CIA was involved that's been classified
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:13.000]  the LA Times editor was CIA
[03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  which is what they're doing now to Trump
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000]  I call it the Alexpionage
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:19.000]  because it's basically the spy
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:21.000]  services as well as the
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  political establishment the media establishment
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:25.000]  that are organized to take Trump
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:27.000]  down and they don't care
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:29.000]  what is true and what isn't true they're going to
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:31.000]  keep repeating these lies because that's a tactic
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:33.000]  of propaganda to destroy his reputation
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:35.000]  so that they can come after him destroy his
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:37.000]  presidency and they have slowed down
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:39.000]  his ability to get some
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:41.000]  of his agenda through that's a key part of what's happened
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:43.000]  is the fact that they're on defense
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:45.000]  and they keep coming up with it
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  remember when they derail it successfully
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:49.000]  they haven't derailed it all
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000]  it's their fault they're behind it
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  we're winning by fighting
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:55.000]  think how far we've already come globalism is
[03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:57.000]  collapsing they're in crisis
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:25:59.000]  we are having devastating victories
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:01.000]  it doesn't mean they may not kill Trump
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:03.000]  or myself or others but together
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:05.000]  we're going over the top we're winning
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:07.000]  Craig in New Mexico on the opioids
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:09.000]  give us your take
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:11.000]  I'm calling
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:13.000]  for the people that actually
[03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:15.000]  need the opioids that can't
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:17.000]  get them and
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:19.000]  there's a lot of us out here
[03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  and we are being called drug addicts
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:23.000]  and we are not
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  well that's another paradigm
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  they let you get on them and then they try to
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:29.000]  take them away from me well the other thing too
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:31.000]  is what they're doing with medical marijuana
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:33.000]  that's helpful for some people to get off
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:35.000]  of the more dangerous prescription opioids
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  but they won't let you sorry go ahead and call
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:39.000]  they will not
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:41.000]  give the opioids to the people that
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:43.000]  need them and also on the other hand
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  they won't give surgery
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:47.000]  I need laser surgery which they
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:49.000]  have made me unable to
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.000]  get by $15,000
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:53.000]  copay
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.000]  and all the doctors in my area
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:57.000]  that give out the opioids have been
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  taken out and
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.000]  it's ridiculous for the people
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:03.000]  I had a friend of mine's son
[03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  call me trying to get pills off me
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.000]  and I almost lost my friend
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:09.000]  because I told him because of people like
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:11.000]  him people like me that actually
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:13.000]  need the drugs cannot get them
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.000]  anymore you're talking about palliative
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:17.000]  care they call the drug addict
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:19.000]  and nobody addresses
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:21.000]  the other end of the spectrum
[03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:23.000]  those of us who need them
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:25.000]  well sir I want to be clear there's obviously
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  folks sure I understand there's people that
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:29.000]  it works for doesn't give you a problem
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:31.000]  and it helps alleviate pain we're not
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  saying that then there's extremes like
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:35.000]  you bought took so many made him go deaf
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:37.000]  you know so I just
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  well part of the drug war is that
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:41.000]  they have come down on doctors
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:43.000]  who would prescribe painkillers for people
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000]  who were suffering from cancer
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:47.000]  hey my dad was happy to retire from dentistry
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.000]  he only does it he has his license but just for the family
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.000]  because they would
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000]  just give people painkillers for wisdom
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:55.000]  teeth that were pulled out and then
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:57.000]  the state police would show up and go through all the records
[03:27:57.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  yeah and they were pretty good
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:01.000]  now the feds completely run it
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.000]  and my dad says look they've just made healthcare
[03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:05.000]  where it's just impossible yeah I mean because
[03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:07.000]  they're wrecking it folks because they're just you know
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:09.000]  no more eye surgery here's your cane
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:11.000]  you know and no more knee surgery here's your
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:13.000]  cane thank you Craig sorry to hear
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:15.000]  you're having those problems yes I know I've talked to doctors
[03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:17.000]  there is the whole end
[03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:19.000]  what they're doing is doctors
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:21.000]  that were giving it to real people that needed
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:23.000]  their gone it's only if you follow
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:25.000]  the computer and the HMO
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:27.000]  when it tells you
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:29.000]  it's when you prescribe it separate
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  see it's all computer yeah it's all
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:33.000]  computerized now folks
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:35.000]  my dad managed over a hundred dental offices believe me I know
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:37.000]  centralized control of healthcare
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:39.000]  so what it really is as long as you follow what the
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:41.000]  computer says you're covered because the computer said
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:43.000]  and see the doctors didn't want to only follow
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:45.000]  what it says
[03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:47.000]  and it's all actuaries done by bioethicist
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:49.000]  and algorithms remember the headline
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:51.000]  last year IBM decides
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  when troops get care
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:55.000]  they go oh we weren't doing death panels at these
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:57.000]  VA bases
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:59.000]  it was the computer decided
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:01.000]  so the computer is going to be your death panel
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:03.000]  just like in Nazi Germany it was an IBM computer
[03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:05.000]  decided how long you lived
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:07.000]  gosh in the great state of Florida you're on the air
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:09.000]  go ahead
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:13.000]  I'm just calling in today to sound the
[03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:15.000]  alarm you know the last
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:17.000]  couple months with the release of the
[03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:19.000]  Puerto Rican nationalist guy that was
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:21.000]  at the front of the Puerto Rican Day Parade
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  in New York there's been a lot of articles about
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  the island of Puerto Rico now
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:27.000]  I'm an American of Hispanic descent
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:29.000]  living down here in the sunshine state
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:31.000]  and I can tell you just from what I've seen
[03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:33.000]  in the last few years we've been flooded with people
[03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:35.000]  from the island of Puerto Rico
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:37.000]  hold on I'm going to come back to you
[03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:39.000]  I mean David's got a whole show prepared and I apologize
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:41.000]  but soon we'll have more air time than you ever want
[03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:43.000]  we're going to come back and finish up with you
[03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:45.000]  because I want to hear this because yeah
[03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:47.000]  it's going under it's bankrupt just like we are
[03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:49.000]  we don't have this recovery and so I want to hear
[03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:51.000]  your take on that because that's the thing if Trump
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:53.000]  isn't successful I mean it's going to be a depression
[03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:57.000]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[03:29:57.000 --> 03:30:23.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[03:30:23.000 --> 03:30:27.000]  Pan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to a handshake between
[03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:29.000]  Poo and Eor other images such as Winnie the Pooh
[03:30:29.000 --> 03:30:31.000]  and a car have been memed alongside President
[03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:33.000]  G in his limo but because the meme of
[03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:35.000]  President G and Winnie the Pooh has gotten so popular
[03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:37.000]  China has now censored it from the internet
[03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:39.000]  this is commonplace in communist China
[03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:41.000]  as a recently deceased political dissident
[03:30:41.000 --> 03:30:43.000]  and Nobel Peace Prize winner Lou Jaubot
[03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:45.000]  has had his name completely censored from
[03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:47.000]  the virtual world try sending his name
[03:30:47.000 --> 03:30:49.000]  in a message to a friend and the message
[03:30:49.000 --> 03:30:51.000]  will disappear into cyberspace
[03:30:51.000 --> 03:30:55.160]  Chabot died in Chinese custody, and most people in China have no idea who he is.
[03:30:55.160 --> 03:30:59.240]  Keep the internet free in America. Stop net neutrality. Save me magic.
[03:30:59.240 --> 03:31:25.240]  For infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.

[03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:10.840]  on major third party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family. I take
[03:32:10.840 --> 03:32:15.320]  this, my family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore truthful

[03:32:25.400 --> 03:32:30.840]  difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[03:32:30.840 --> 03:32:35.800]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my superfemale. I had a few bottles at my house,
[03:32:35.800 --> 03:32:41.160]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great,
[03:32:41.160 --> 03:32:46.600]  looking good. So, and I know my hair's luxurious once again. So obviously,
[03:32:46.600 --> 03:32:52.920]  superfemale is amazing. I love it. Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one
[03:32:52.920 --> 03:32:57.000]  product that I would say is life changing, that I would suggest it's nascent iodine,
[03:32:57.000 --> 03:33:02.520]  Survival Shield X2. It's got a five star rating. It's a win-win at infowarslife.com.
[03:33:02.520 --> 03:33:23.880]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:32.520 --> 03:33:43.880]  We'll set aside the alienation. Get on with the fascination.
[03:33:45.080 --> 03:33:48.760]  All right, David Knight's taking over. I wanted to finish up with Gus just briefly.
[03:33:50.200 --> 03:33:55.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have said that we're going to have a super summer sale that would go
[03:33:55.880 --> 03:34:02.840]  throughout the month of July. The problem is we're running out of the BrainForce Plus Neutropic.
[03:34:02.840 --> 03:34:07.880]  We're running out of Supermale Vitality, Survival Shield X2, and some of the other best-selling
[03:34:07.880 --> 03:34:12.360]  products. So, I'm going to continue free shipping throughout the month of July, but in the next few
[03:34:12.360 --> 03:34:18.120]  days, I'm going to have to end the 30% off on BrainForce Plus, the amazing Neutropic. Now,
[03:34:18.120 --> 03:34:26.200]  it's 20% more in each bottle. The 30% off on Supermale Vitality, the Survival Shield X2, I just
[03:34:26.200 --> 03:34:32.600]  have to do it. I'll continue the sale on Secret 12, DNA Forces back in stock, the Myco ZX, amazing
[03:34:32.600 --> 03:34:36.840]  antifungal yeast candida in the gut and the intestines. That's back. I'm going to have to
[03:34:36.840 --> 03:34:42.520]  end the 30% off. The others were running low on Biome Defense that, again, is 30% off when you get
[03:34:42.520 --> 03:34:50.200]  it with the Myco ZX. So, you support the broadcast and you fund Infowars that is in the eye of the
[03:34:50.200 --> 03:34:56.440]  storm right now, but help us not just continue, but hopefully expand in the face of the globalists.
[03:34:56.440 --> 03:35:01.560]  So, never a better time to take advantage of these great prices of the free shipping
[03:35:01.560 --> 03:35:07.400]  and to support the broadcast, but only a couple days more. Infowarslife.com or
[03:35:07.400 --> 03:35:14.040]  AAA-253-3139. I'll make good on the specials going throughout the month with the free shipping.
[03:35:14.040 --> 03:35:19.000]  We'll add some of the other items that aren't selling out or have come back into stock at 25,
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:25.400]  30, or even 40% off, but our best-selling products, Brainforce, Supermale, Survival Shield X2 and
[03:35:25.400 --> 03:35:31.960]  Myome Defense, we've got to stop those 30% off here in the next 48 hours or so. So, take advantage
[03:35:31.960 --> 03:35:38.520]  of those again at Infowarslife.com. And again, for myself, the crew and everybody else, you
[03:35:38.520 --> 03:35:44.520]  have forged with your support, your prayers, spreading the word, not believing the globalist
[03:35:44.520 --> 03:35:51.480]  lies, researching facts for yourself. You have built Infowars. You are the Infowar. And so,
[03:35:51.480 --> 03:35:57.400]  take pleasure and satisfaction in knowing we would be in dire straits right now, this country
[03:35:57.400 --> 03:36:03.080]  and this world, if we weren't seeing this nationalist awakening globally that isn't perfect,
[03:36:03.080 --> 03:36:09.480]  but is instinctive in the right direction and ascending shock waves across the world. David,
[03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:15.240]  what would you call this time we're in today? Well, it's really a real crisis, isn't it? I mean,
[03:36:15.240 --> 03:36:19.720]  we've got danger and opportunity right at the same time. And this could go either way. That's why
[03:36:19.720 --> 03:36:23.640]  it's so important for us to get behind Trump. And it's important for Trump to get behind his agenda.
[03:36:23.640 --> 03:36:28.120]  We've had an article last week where I was talking about that. It was actually coming out of the
[03:36:28.120 --> 03:36:32.440]  Washington Post. I said, for the first time, I grew with Washington Post. He has these massive
[03:36:32.440 --> 03:36:37.960]  rallies is incredibly popular. And if you could pull people together and get them to hammer
[03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:44.280]  these establishment Republicans who don't care anything about our freedoms except for the next
[03:36:44.280 --> 03:36:47.240]  election. That's why these people are saying, we're not going to do anything that's going to
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:50.680]  really change Obamacare. We're going to kind of keep this from here. We're going to play it safe
[03:36:50.680 --> 03:36:54.840]  because we want to get reelected. Well, you let them know that they're not going to get reelected
[03:36:54.840 --> 03:36:59.160]  if they don't do what we voted for for four elections. You got to make it clear that that's
[03:36:59.160 --> 03:37:04.200]  not going to happen if they don't work with Trump on this agenda, if they're going to block him
[03:37:04.200 --> 03:37:07.720]  because they want to do something for the establishment. That's the key thing. They have
[03:37:07.720 --> 03:37:12.680]  to understand there has been a sea change here. And I think a big part of that is for Trump to
[03:37:12.680 --> 03:37:18.360]  energize the electric and get these people to come after the establishment Republicans,
[03:37:18.360 --> 03:37:22.680]  the so-called moderates. That's right. They're never going to compromise. Yeah. He's got to
[03:37:22.680 --> 03:37:26.600]  rally the troops to remove the establishment Republicans, to remove the Democrats. They're
[03:37:26.600 --> 03:37:30.520]  a cancer. Only one is their job. And you told them you're not going to have your job if you
[03:37:30.520 --> 03:37:34.520]  don't stand with what we voted for. And I want to go to Gus and then have you take over because
[03:37:34.520 --> 03:37:39.400]  in your stack today was Puerto Rico and in your stack was Illinois. We're not taking pleasure
[03:37:39.400 --> 03:37:43.160]  that Puerto Rico is going under. We're not taking pleasure in Illinois and deep trouble under
[03:37:43.160 --> 03:37:46.920]  globalist management. A lot of great people in that state. It's coming everywhere. You think
[03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:53.880]  California is bad? Everywhere is infected by this. And when it starts falling, it's going to be like
[03:37:53.880 --> 03:37:59.800]  it's going to be like dominoes. So Gus was bringing up what's going on in Puerto Rico. Go ahead, Gus.
[03:38:00.840 --> 03:38:06.520]  Well, yeah, you know, they're being crushed with $122 billion in debt. And you know, Puerto Rico
[03:38:06.520 --> 03:38:12.440]  historically votes 80 plus percent Democrat. A lot of people may not know this, but even though
[03:38:12.440 --> 03:38:16.520]  they're not a state, Puerto Ricans, when they're born, they're basically citizens and they come
[03:38:16.520 --> 03:38:21.720]  and go as they wish without a green card. The problem is, is that crushing debt has over the
[03:38:21.720 --> 03:38:27.160]  last decade pushed about almost 20% of the island's population into the United States. Historically,
[03:38:27.160 --> 03:38:31.320]  they go to the northeast, but over the last 10 years, they flooded into central Florida and
[03:38:31.320 --> 03:38:37.880]  Orlando. My fear is, is that the Trump train won't go any further than 2020 because all the
[03:38:37.880 --> 03:38:41.800]  Puerto Ricans that are running here into central Florida are going to flip Florida permanently
[03:38:41.800 --> 03:38:47.960]  blue. So I think we all need to write our congressman and just kind of rid ourselves of the island,
[03:38:47.960 --> 03:38:53.800]  because we're not going to get Republican votes from these guys. And they're anti-Trump pretty
[03:38:53.800 --> 03:39:02.600]  much across the board. So why is it the Cubans that have been under communism go 90% Republican?
[03:39:02.600 --> 03:39:06.600]  Not the Republicans are perfect, but it's better than pure communism. Why don't the Puerto Ricans
[03:39:06.600 --> 03:39:13.720]  or the Venezuelans or anybody get socialism? Does it work? It's a nightmare. Well, the problem,
[03:39:13.720 --> 03:39:18.520]  the thing with Cubans is, is now you can look at them two different ways. Your, your premariel
[03:39:18.520 --> 03:39:23.240]  boat lift Cuban, you know, they're very capitalist. And a lot of them, the reason they vote Republican
[03:39:23.240 --> 03:39:28.440]  is because they hate Kennedy for bailing on the Bay of Pigs. But your post-Mariel Cuban is more
[03:39:28.440 --> 03:39:33.320]  likely born and raised under socialism. And all these young Cubans, they tend to vote Democrat.
[03:39:33.320 --> 03:39:38.360]  So that Cuban stronghold the Republican party has, it's fading and it's fading fast,
[03:39:38.360 --> 03:39:44.040]  but Puerto Rico is going to be more impactful a lot quicker. That they're pushing for statehood
[03:39:44.040 --> 03:39:48.200]  so we can wipe the debt off their books. No, I understand. I just don't get how
[03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:52.840]  you leave communism or socialism and then you come somewhere else and then try to recreate it.
[03:39:52.840 --> 03:39:57.080]  It's like Californians. Yeah, or New Yorkers. Yeah, they come here and then they want to do
[03:39:57.080 --> 03:40:02.440]  what they did there. And I'm like, listen, stay there. If you want to have state income taxes,
[03:40:02.440 --> 03:40:06.840]  I mean, Texas already has high taxes just compared to California. They're low. I mean,
[03:40:06.840 --> 03:40:11.160]  I pay so many taxes. They don't understand why the area that they're coming from is collapsing.
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:16.120]  That's the key thing. They don't understand in New York or, uh, or Michigan or in California,
[03:40:16.120 --> 03:40:20.200]  why those areas are collapsing. They come back and they come out before like hiking and smell,
[03:40:20.200 --> 03:40:23.080]  just throw a beer can down. And I'm not some huge environmentalist, but I don't want to see
[03:40:23.080 --> 03:40:29.080]  beer cans everywhere. And I'm like, dude, you need to pick your beer can up. Oh, somebody else will
[03:40:29.080 --> 03:40:33.480]  do it. And it's like, you know what, I don't like when I'm in a river stepping on a beer can or a
[03:40:33.480 --> 03:40:38.440]  bottle, cut my foot open, I go, pick your beer can up. And it's the same thing. Like I use the
[03:40:38.440 --> 03:40:43.560]  allegory of a pig in the pool. People will do it. Don't think that everybody else is doing it.
[03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:48.360]  Like it's weird. I guess when I was like a kid that I did up and go to the bathroom at the pool,
[03:40:48.360 --> 03:40:52.600]  everybody else was just peeing in it. And I guess that's really, it's like, I don't get in the
[03:40:52.600 --> 03:40:57.800]  fast lane and drive slow. I get out of the fast lane. The public's so dumb, especially people
[03:40:57.800 --> 03:41:01.800]  with Democrat stickers, it's usually Democrats, you know, coexist stickers, whatever, that are in
[03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:07.240]  the fast lane going under the speed limit. They don't even know their obstruction is David.
[03:41:07.240 --> 03:41:10.920]  Yeah, well, you know, when you look at the situation in terms of taxes,
[03:41:10.920 --> 03:41:14.520]  they think somebody else is going to pay for this. They think somebody just like you, your analogy,
[03:41:14.520 --> 03:41:18.520]  they think somebody else is going to pick up the can. Well, they're happy to kick this can down the
[03:41:18.520 --> 03:41:22.680]  road because they believe that it's going to be somebody else who's taxed and not them. And that's
[03:41:22.680 --> 03:41:27.240]  the key delusion that they operate under in these areas under Democrat control. They're always
[03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:31.240]  told they're going to get something from government, but it's never going to cost them anything. That's
[03:41:31.240 --> 03:41:36.040]  the core mentality. And they're throwing cigarette butts and tin cans and baby diapers all over the
[03:41:36.040 --> 03:41:40.840]  trail. And they don't even understand it's messing the trail up for them. They think they're getting
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:46.440]  ahead. And that's the dirt ball equation. And I mean, I want to start a national movement. I want
[03:41:46.440 --> 03:41:49.640]  $5,000 fines when you're in the fast lane driving below the speed limit. I mean,
[03:41:50.200 --> 03:41:54.760]  somebody, I mean, I know I've got, I'm not a road rager, but I do when somebody's going 45 and a
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:42:01.400]  60. Yeah. I mean, I do drive beside them and I go, that's the fast lane. I go fast lane. You get
[03:42:01.400 --> 03:42:06.920]  out of it. It's the passing lane. You'll go back to driver safety. Gus, thank you for the call.
[03:42:06.920 --> 03:42:11.160]  David, take over. Thanks for letting me take over 42 minutes of the transmission. I know you've
[03:42:11.160 --> 03:42:15.560]  got a full plate there. So we really appreciate you. Sure. Natalie News coming up tonight,
[03:42:15.560 --> 03:42:20.440]  seven o'clock as well. Keep going, David. Thanks. And August 21st, new show in the morning,
[03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:23.960]  eight to 11. It's going to be an early morning show. So tune in. We're going to have a lot of
[03:42:23.960 --> 03:42:28.920]  breaking news as it happens at sunrise. This is going to be starting at o dark 30 for me and
[03:42:28.920 --> 03:42:34.040]  others who are coming in here. I want to talk about this Haitian official because I think this is
[03:42:34.040 --> 03:42:40.120]  interesting in light of the fact we just had another GOP operative who was found committee
[03:42:40.120 --> 03:42:44.440]  suicide. There's no political killings. Lincoln died of natural causes. So did Kennedy. That's
[03:42:44.440 --> 03:42:49.320]  right. That's right. Lead poisoning. In this case that we talked about on Friday, this guy's name
[03:42:49.320 --> 03:42:55.240]  was Peter Smith, and he was found with a bag around his head and helium attached to it.
[03:42:55.240 --> 03:43:00.440]  And he had written a suicide note saying, no foul play whatsoever. I did this because I've
[03:43:00.440 --> 03:43:05.080]  got an expiring life insurance policy of $5 million. Now, that right there should tell you
[03:43:05.080 --> 03:43:12.440]  that something is wrong. If you're going to have a shotgun, yeah, no foul play here. Don't worry
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:17.720]  about this. Nobody writes that in a suicide note. And the very fact that he says, I'm doing this
[03:43:17.720 --> 03:43:21.400]  because I want to collect insurance. Well, you're not going to collect insurance on a suicide. I
[03:43:21.400 --> 03:43:25.800]  don't know who's got a policy that pays on suicides. But now we have a Haitian official
[03:43:25.800 --> 03:43:31.720]  who was supposed to testify on Tuesday talking about the corruption in Haiti. He has now been
[03:43:31.720 --> 03:43:37.800]  found dead by gunshot wound that has been reported registered as a suicide by the government.
[03:43:37.800 --> 03:43:43.800]  They say this man's name was Eberwein, Klaus Eberwein. He was a former Haitian government official
[03:43:43.800 --> 03:43:49.000]  who is expected to expose the extent of Clinton's foundation corruption and malpractice. He was
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:53.080]  going to do it next week. He was found dead in Miami at the age of 50 with a gunshot wound.
[03:43:54.040 --> 03:43:58.200]  Not long before his death, he acknowledged that his life was in danger because he was going to
[03:43:58.200 --> 03:44:02.920]  expose corruption in the Clinton Foundation. How many times we heard this before? We had the DC
[03:44:02.920 --> 03:44:08.280]  madam come on with Alex Jones and saying, and Alex said, you're not thinking about committing
[03:44:08.280 --> 03:44:14.360]  suicide. Absolutely not. I'm not going to do this. We had Aaron Schwartz, who was taking on the NSA
[03:44:14.360 --> 03:44:21.720]  and the Intelligence Surveillance Establishment, fighting them over SOPA, SISPA and ACTA, PIPA,
[03:44:21.720 --> 03:44:25.080]  all these different variants that they had come up with. He had defeated them multiple times.
[03:44:25.080 --> 03:44:29.800]  This guy was a fighter. He was getting in their face. He was not somebody who's going to be cowed
[03:44:29.800 --> 03:44:35.560]  down by a prosecutor. And yet, we were told that after they came against him with trumped-up charges
[03:44:35.560 --> 03:44:41.960]  that he committed suicide because he was concerned about 30 years in jail. The wife of the prosecutor
[03:44:41.960 --> 03:44:47.640]  who was coming after him, Carmen Ortiz, her husband, because she was getting criticized for all this
[03:44:47.640 --> 03:44:52.280]  that she offered him a deal of only like 30 days to get out of this. Not 30 years if he would just
[03:44:52.280 --> 03:44:57.160]  plead guilty to something and then removed that report. So we've seen this happen over and over
[03:44:57.160 --> 03:45:02.280]  again, but especially with the Clintons. We have this long list of Clinton sides. And this is what
[03:45:02.280 --> 03:45:06.600]  he had said before he died about the Clinton Foundation. So the Clinton Foundation, they're
[03:45:06.600 --> 03:45:12.680]  criminals, they're thieves, they're liars, they're a disgrace. And he said that at a protest outside
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:17.240]  the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year. And again, he was due to appear on
[03:45:17.240 --> 03:45:22.360]  Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, where he was widely
[03:45:22.360 --> 03:45:27.960]  expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from
[03:45:27.960 --> 03:45:34.440]  international donors. But then we find out, as he's talking about this, he said in his estimation,
[03:45:34.440 --> 03:45:40.520]  he was accused actually of fraud and corruption. He said, no, it's not me, it's the government,
[03:45:40.520 --> 03:45:46.280]  it's the Clintons. And what he said with that was there was only 0.6% of donations granted by
[03:45:46.280 --> 03:45:50.920]  international donors to the Clinton Foundation actually went to Haitians. He said another
[03:45:50.920 --> 03:45:59.640]  9.6% went to the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% or $5.4 billion was funded to non-Haitian
[03:45:59.640 --> 03:46:05.400]  organizations. So there's two ways that the Haitians are getting ripped off in this. After a
[03:46:05.400 --> 03:46:09.400]  natural disaster, people send a lot of money to them. And of course, as we always see, corrupt
[03:46:09.400 --> 03:46:13.880]  governments take a big cut of that. But in this case, it was really more organizations like the
[03:46:13.880 --> 03:46:18.760]  Clinton Foundation that didn't turn the money over to them. They just kept it. They fundraised
[03:46:18.760 --> 03:46:23.000]  off of the earthquake, off of the tragedy, but then didn't do anything with the money.
[03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:29.480]  That's one aspect of it. The other thing, as we've interviewed people from Haiti,
[03:46:29.480 --> 03:46:33.720]  talking about what's going on there, why are the Clintons so interested in Haiti?
[03:46:33.720 --> 03:46:39.080]  Well, because there's a vast amount of mineral wealth there that's tied up in the land. And they
[03:46:39.080 --> 03:46:43.800]  want to be able to get the access to that mineral wealth. Just as we saw the Clintons involved with
[03:46:43.800 --> 03:46:49.160]  the sale of 20% of our uranium to the Russians, they want to get their claws on what is happening
[03:46:49.160 --> 03:46:53.480]  in Haiti, even though it is one of the poorest countries in the world. We just had some friends
[03:46:53.480 --> 03:47:00.120]  get back from a vacation in the Dominican Republic, which is on the same island, Hispaniola, as Haiti
[03:47:00.120 --> 03:47:06.200]  is. The per capita income from the Dominican and the Dominican Republic is about a quarter of what
[03:47:06.200 --> 03:47:13.160]  it is here in the United States. It's $17,000. The US is just under $60,000 per capita income.
[03:47:13.160 --> 03:47:16.760]  They said the people there were desperately poor. They're constantly coming after them for money
[03:47:16.760 --> 03:47:21.560]  and that sort of thing. But they said they had massive border wall and fence to keep the Haitians
[03:47:21.560 --> 03:47:27.880]  out. Why? Because even though the per capita income in the Dominican Republic is only about $17,000,
[03:47:27.880 --> 03:47:35.160]  in Haiti, it's only $769. So one of the poorest, if not the poorest country in the world, setting on
[03:47:35.160 --> 03:47:41.400]  some of the most, the wealthiest reserves of minerals and other things in Haiti. That's why
[03:47:41.400 --> 03:47:49.080]  the Clintons are there. And as this article from shtfplan.com points out, Eberwein was
[03:47:49.080 --> 03:47:53.800]  expected to testify, but then he winds up committing suicide shortly before. Where have
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:47:58.680]  we seen this before? Well, we've seen it all the time from the Clintons, haven't we? Think about
[03:47:58.680 --> 03:48:03.240]  Vince Foster. Think about all these other people that we have seen, the many Clinton sides that
[03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:07.640]  happen over and over again. Real quickly, I want to talk about Rand Paul and what he had to say
[03:48:07.640 --> 03:48:13.000]  about healthcare. Because I think he is spot on with what's going on. He said it's a giant bailout
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:17.400]  super fund for insurance companies. And he said this over the weekend. He said, I think
[03:48:17.400 --> 03:48:21.560]  the longer the bill is out there, the more conservative Republicans are going to discover
[03:48:21.560 --> 03:48:26.920]  that it is not repeal. And the more that everybody's going to discover that it keeps the fundamental
[03:48:26.920 --> 03:48:31.480]  flaw of Obamacare. He said that on face and nation yesterday. So basically what the Republicans are
[03:48:31.480 --> 03:48:38.600]  trying to do is to subsidize the death spiral of Obamacare. That's precisely what McConnell and
[03:48:38.600 --> 03:48:43.080]  the so-called centrist Republicans are doing. They're the establishment and there's no difference
[03:48:43.080 --> 03:48:47.320]  between these people and the Democrats. Let's understand that. He said it also has nothing
[03:48:47.320 --> 03:48:52.760]  to do with repeal. Rand Paul said, I mean, we promised the voters that for four elections.
[03:48:52.760 --> 03:48:57.400]  Four elections. When are they going to keep their promise? He said, I'm not for any more taxpayer
[03:48:57.400 --> 03:49:03.240]  money going to an industry that makes $15 billion a year. They're getting their subsidies. Where
[03:49:03.240 --> 03:49:08.200]  are they getting it? As we pointed out with Jerome Corsi, they're stealing all of the assets of the
[03:49:08.200 --> 03:49:13.320]  now profitable Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac investments. These are things that people have invested in.
[03:49:13.320 --> 03:49:18.440]  As I said, my father, when he was preparing for his retirement, he's now deceased. But he had
[03:49:18.440 --> 03:49:23.800]  invested money into these types of investments, Fannie and Freddie. There were conservative real
[03:49:23.800 --> 03:49:27.640]  estate mortgages that were guaranteed by the government. And yet it is the government that
[03:49:27.640 --> 03:49:33.720]  came in after Congress would not fund Obamacare, came in and took all the money there. They did
[03:49:33.720 --> 03:49:38.760]  what they called a net asset suite, took everything out of it. It's basically what we call theft.
[03:49:39.400 --> 03:49:43.720]  And that's the way they're funding many of these subsidies, that and massive taxes.
[03:49:43.720 --> 03:49:46.840]  I think one of the most interesting things that came out of this over the last couple of days,
[03:49:46.840 --> 03:49:51.800]  this was all introduced on Friday. We saw the Cruz amendment coming in and then we saw insurers
[03:49:51.800 --> 03:49:56.280]  coming out in opposition to the Cruz amendment. Why would they oppose something that would allow
[03:49:56.280 --> 03:50:02.360]  them to offer different products? They don't want competition from even other insurers.
[03:50:02.360 --> 03:50:07.640]  They want to make sure that everybody is forced to buy their Cadillac policies. And when I say
[03:50:07.640 --> 03:50:13.560]  Cadillac policies, I mean having to buy maternity insurance if you're a young single male. They
[03:50:13.560 --> 03:50:18.600]  want everybody to pay for everything. And then they can justify higher and higher rates,
[03:50:18.600 --> 03:50:23.080]  people who are paying for this and not getting it from subsidized stolen money,
[03:50:23.960 --> 03:50:27.000]  see that their insurance rates are going up, that they're skyrocketing.
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:30.760]  And we have these insurers now who don't want to have any competition.
[03:50:30.760 --> 03:50:35.400]  So what the Cruz amendment said was if you sell the mandated policies that are in Obamacare,
[03:50:35.400 --> 03:50:40.520]  which the insurance companies put that in there because that's what they wanted everybody to
[03:50:40.520 --> 03:50:44.360]  buy, guess what? They don't want you having a choice. They don't want anybody offering you
[03:50:44.360 --> 03:50:48.920]  anything else. And if we go back and look at this, all of these prohibitions against selling
[03:50:48.920 --> 03:50:54.200]  insurance across state lines, probably there because the insurance companies lobbied for it.
[03:50:54.200 --> 03:51:16.360]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.

[03:52:03.800 --> 03:52:08.740]  They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that
[03:52:08.740 --> 03:52:13.920]  their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows
[03:52:13.920 --> 03:52:19.020]  and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their
[03:52:19.020 --> 03:52:25.000]  ex-president to endorse the resistance. All to make them march, make them protest, make
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:31.480]  them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars,
[03:52:31.480 --> 03:52:36.760]  shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding. Until the only
[03:52:36.760 --> 03:52:43.120]  option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens,
[03:52:43.120 --> 03:52:48.840]  they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way
[03:52:48.840 --> 03:52:55.520]  we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched

[03:54:59.480 --> 03:55:04.800]  to last, but that's part of our July summer special at infowarsstore.com. Thank you so
[03:55:04.800 --> 03:55:09.480]  much for your support. That's what allows us to grow and to extend the shows and the
[03:55:09.480 --> 03:55:11.880]  hours that we're going to be on air.
[03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:17.640]  I want to talk a little bit about this report that we see about a lady who came here from
[03:55:17.640 --> 03:55:21.320]  Australia, a place where they have no guns. She doesn't like guns in the United States.
[03:55:21.320 --> 03:55:26.000]  She thinks that she can trust the police to keep her safe at all times. So she called
[03:55:26.000 --> 03:55:32.200]  911 on Saturday night. Her name was Justine Damon. She had come to America. She had married
[03:55:32.200 --> 03:55:36.880]  an American here. And she had been speaking to the police. She called the police. She's
[03:55:36.880 --> 03:55:42.240]  standing there in her pajamas. She's talking to the police through the driver's window.
[03:55:42.240 --> 03:55:47.280]  And then somehow, for some reason, the cop that is sitting in the passenger seat pulls
[03:55:47.280 --> 03:55:53.000]  out a gun and shoots her dead. Absolutely amazing. How many times have we seen people
[03:55:53.000 --> 03:55:58.840]  who call the police get shot by the police? And this is something that happens way too
[03:55:58.840 --> 03:56:03.960]  often. Anybody can make a mistake. But I have to say, when we were looking at the situation,
[03:56:03.960 --> 03:56:09.280]  for example, in New Mexico, we had that shooting, if you remember, a few years ago of the homeless
[03:56:09.280 --> 03:56:15.640]  man and it was all captured on the police bodycams. And it was very disturbing to see
[03:56:15.640 --> 03:56:19.440]  how this went down and how they had been working with this guy for quite some time. They knew
[03:56:19.440 --> 03:56:24.000]  that he was not a danger to them. They shot him dead from a short distance after they
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:31.640]  had been talking to him for quite some time. And at the same time, we had someone who was
[03:56:31.640 --> 03:56:37.160]  there in New Mexico who had been one of the instructors at the State Police Academy and
[03:56:37.160 --> 03:56:44.360]  had been teaching officers coming in, training officers for decades, say, I am not going
[03:56:44.360 --> 03:56:49.400]  to teach your shoot first curriculum. You have changed the way that we interact with
[03:56:49.400 --> 03:56:54.040]  the public. You have told and you're teaching the officers to shoot first. And this is an
[03:56:54.040 --> 03:56:58.720]  experienced police instructor. He says, I'm not going to be a part of that. This is the
[03:56:58.720 --> 03:57:04.800]  issue, folks, the training that we have here. This guy who shot this lady dead was a relatively
[03:57:04.800 --> 03:57:11.800]  new officer. I think he had been working for the police for only about two years. So something
[03:57:11.800 --> 03:57:16.360]  of a rookie. But the real issue is the way that they're training them, the shoot first
[03:57:16.360 --> 03:57:21.040]  issues. And when I look at this article that was on the Dredge Report about facial recognition
[03:57:21.040 --> 03:57:27.360]  coming to police body cameras, do you realize just how dangerous this is? We've had situations.
[03:57:27.360 --> 03:57:33.480]  I remember seeing artificial intelligence is going to alert police to suspicious behavior.
[03:57:33.480 --> 03:57:38.560]  And they call the SWAT team on a guy that was essentially trying to change his flat
[03:57:38.560 --> 03:57:43.160]  tire. They saw him kind of lurking around and standing around the outside of the vehicle
[03:57:43.160 --> 03:57:49.080]  for a while. Then he bends down. You can't see him on the other side of the car. So they
[03:57:49.080 --> 03:57:53.160]  thought he was stealing the car, that he's getting under the car. But it was flagged
[03:57:53.160 --> 03:57:58.480]  by the artificial intelligence. When the police are told that there's some kind of crime going,
[03:57:58.480 --> 03:58:04.000]  that's ongoing, that could be a danger to them, then they come with their guns drawn
[03:58:04.000 --> 03:58:08.320]  and they're ready to shoot. And they are instructed to do that. It is a shoot first
[03:58:08.320 --> 03:58:13.520]  curriculum. That's part of really what we saw with Flando Castile. Absolutely outrageous
[03:58:13.520 --> 03:58:17.800]  that this guy, who was pulled over for a minor traffic violation. Of course, the reason
[03:58:17.800 --> 03:58:22.120]  the black community is upset about this, he's pulled over 52 times in a short period for
[03:58:22.120 --> 03:58:26.000]  minor traffic violations, never had done anything wrong. He was licensed to carry. He told him
[03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:30.880]  I've got a gun on and they get in this back and forth and he gets shot seven times. That
[03:58:30.880 --> 03:58:35.760]  was the other part of it. That is what we have to be concerned about. Black or white,
[03:58:35.760 --> 03:58:40.120]  we have to change the way that the police are engaging with all of us. We have to get
[03:58:40.120 --> 03:58:48.520]  control over that. Join us tonight for the Emperor's Nightly News. This is GCN, the Genesis
[03:58:48.520 --> 03:59:06.560]  Communications Radio Network.
