[00:00.000 --> 00:18.280]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:36.200 --> 00:40.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:40.400 --> 01:09.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, September 1st. The year is 2022 and we are cruising
[01:09.520 --> 01:20.720]  right in to a new world order takeover. Design collapsed the world economy, world IDs, Mark
[01:20.720 --> 01:31.000]  of the Beast. Thank you so much for joining us on this emergency Thursday transmission.
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.680]  I am witnessing, you are witnessing, we are all experiencing the greatest levels of brainwashing
[01:37.680 --> 01:48.080]  and outright lies, gaslighting that we have ever seen. Three days ago, I went on Steve
[01:48.080 --> 01:53.120]  Bannon's show and on my own broadcast and I went through a laundry list of the Democrats
[01:53.120 --> 01:58.760]  saying right wingers are about to be violent, Trump supporters are fascist, we are all planning
[01:58.760 --> 02:03.280]  violence and I said the last thing we want is violence and they are desperate, the world
[02:03.280 --> 02:07.880]  is turning against the whole new world order and they have pre-programmed all this to do
[02:07.880 --> 02:14.480]  what they did on January 6th or with the governor Whitmer, false flag, kidnapping operation,
[02:14.480 --> 02:19.600]  provocateur operation. The last thing we want is violence and I believe they are preparing
[02:19.600 --> 02:25.200]  when I was 68 days, it was 71 days then, out of the midterms, to stage something. My gosh
[02:25.200 --> 02:32.360]  it is as obvious as the nose on our face, on your face, my face. And the spin in the
[02:32.360 --> 02:39.680]  last two days by CNN and MSNBC and the young turds and all of them is Alex Jones is calling
[02:39.680 --> 02:46.080]  for violence. Then they play clips where I say they are planning stage stuff. So now
[02:46.080 --> 02:50.400]  they don't even, they used to do where they would to show a clip, they show a clip that
[02:50.400 --> 02:57.200]  says the opposite and then say I am calling for violence and saying oh what does he know,
[02:57.200 --> 03:05.120]  he is planning something. They want to stage stuff or provocateur it to blame us, we don't
[03:05.120 --> 03:10.160]  want violence, we are politically winning. They are hoping election fraud could put them
[03:10.160 --> 03:17.160]  over the top. Great example, all the major polls showed in the Alaska special election
[03:17.160 --> 03:21.600]  the Sarah Palin was going to win big but they got mail in ballots and the Republicans let
[03:21.600 --> 03:29.760]  them redistrict things and so while she loses to a Democrat for the first time a Republican
[03:29.760 --> 03:36.360]  has lost for that seat in 50 years, swimming against the tide, total fraud, that's what
[03:36.360 --> 03:42.560]  they have done. So people ask how am I taking all the attacks on them for wars? I mean we
[03:42.560 --> 03:46.240]  are all under attack, they are turning the power off, they are disintegrating the borders,
[03:46.240 --> 03:51.920]  they are devaluing the currency, inflation is off the chart, power bills on average are
[03:51.920 --> 03:56.760]  up 47% this year so far. I mean my God, a third of people they are announcing nationally
[03:56.760 --> 04:02.720]  in the national survey can't pay their damn power bill. California told people yesterday
[04:02.720 --> 04:06.720]  don't charge your electric cars, there is not enough power, which they know there is
[04:06.720 --> 04:11.760]  not, they have all the equations. This is the deliberate destruction of the western
[04:11.760 --> 04:17.000]  world to bring us under a feudal model like they used in the third world and the biggest
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.600]  issue is that leftist and minions of the system who are mercenaries at every level from school
[04:23.600 --> 04:30.520]  teachers up to propagandists at CNN to the Justice Department behave and act like they
[04:30.520 --> 04:35.520]  are on a winning team going through with all this and all you are doing is destroying
[04:35.520 --> 04:41.640]  and burning down your own house. This isn't normal corruption that just wants control,
[04:41.640 --> 04:48.080]  this is corruption that wants a new dark age and we are going to be covering it all a day
[04:48.080 --> 04:53.080]  but this is a big deal folks and by the way we passed the point our return, the collapse
[04:53.080 --> 04:57.040]  is already happening and it is going to get a hell of a lot worse so get ready to stay
[04:57.040 --> 05:01.520]  with us.
[05:01.520 --> 05:07.840]  Just look at these headlines from Reuters, World Faces on Presented Global Hunger Crisis
[05:07.840 --> 05:15.000]  UN Chiefs says going into 2023, World Food Program warns of global food catastrophe,
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.080]  looming global catastrophe, the world could run out of food by 2023, major studies say
[05:20.080 --> 05:24.720]  and the reports go on and on. We told you this was a designed program by the globalist
[05:24.720 --> 05:28.320]  two and a half years ago, we told you energy and food prices would explode and now they
[05:28.320 --> 05:32.960]  are up more than 40% in the US alone, some areas of the world are up over 100%. The only
[05:32.960 --> 05:36.440]  way you beat inflation and protect yourself and your family is with high quality swarble
[05:36.440 --> 05:43.720]  food ready to ship right now at preparetoday.com and a very rare sale of 10% off site wide

[05:59.000 --> 06:04.000]  yourself and your family while you still can.
[06:04.000 --> 06:11.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[06:11.000 --> 06:31.320]  The well planned, designed, accelerated collapse of the caring capacity of the industrial society
[06:31.320 --> 06:39.880]  that supports almost 8 million people on this planet is being deliberately turned off and
[06:39.880 --> 06:46.400]  anybody going along with this, including the establishment or psychotics, this will cause
[06:46.400 --> 06:52.560]  massive civil unrest, massive war, massive starvation, it's already happening, the total
[06:52.560 --> 06:57.240]  collapse of the third world into the first world, hell on earth and I told you when
[06:57.240 --> 07:00.400]  they started the lockdown two and a half years ago this was the plan because they've written
[07:00.400 --> 07:06.400]  the plan, they blame it on global warming when they're the ones doing it, oh a virus
[07:06.400 --> 07:10.080]  came out of a lab because of global warming, oh the border is collapsing because of global
[07:10.080 --> 07:15.000]  warming, no because of your lockdowns, in some cases over two years long in the third
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.920]  world not letting farmers and others work so they were starving to death so they have
[07:18.920 --> 07:27.920]  to come here, it is a premeditated plan so here's the big front and center issue, on
[07:27.920 --> 07:33.280]  Tuesday and Wednesday, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, I did my own
[07:33.280 --> 07:38.880]  show, I did Steve Bannon show, I did a lot of broadcast and I said you can see all the
[07:38.880 --> 07:42.560]  pre-programming in the media, they say the right wing is about to be violent, they're
[07:42.560 --> 07:46.160]  about to engage in terror attacks, the FBI says the number one terror threat is right
[07:46.160 --> 07:49.920]  wingers with no evidence of that, we know they staged the Whitmer event, we know they
[07:49.920 --> 07:54.440]  helped provocateur January 6th and they are losing political control and everybody's
[07:54.440 --> 07:58.440]  turning against them, so they're betting on election fraud and persecution of their
[07:58.440 --> 08:03.960]  political opposition and staging events to claim that we're the violent ones, that's
[08:03.960 --> 08:10.480]  their move, that's the clear move they're engaged in right now and I came out on Monday
[08:10.480 --> 08:16.520]  and Tuesday and talked about this and now everything from CNN to the young Turks to
[08:16.520 --> 08:22.560]  all of them have gone completely ape and are misrepresenting and saying tonight, Alex
[08:22.560 --> 08:29.440]  Jones calls for violence, in fact guys, I want to play the young Turks clip, but I want
[08:29.440 --> 08:34.680]  to read the headline too, you can just print me that one page of the headline because I
[08:34.680 --> 08:40.080]  don't have the exact headline in front of me, but it's Alex Jones calls for political
[08:40.080 --> 08:48.800]  violence and when you actually watch the clip and then read the comments, they're saying
[08:48.800 --> 08:55.640]  that's it, arrest him or that's it, it's time to kill him and then mainline media operatives
[08:55.640 --> 09:01.480]  on Twitter are calling for me to be shot and saying if you see Smiley and M4's t-shirt,
[09:01.480 --> 09:07.760]  shoot them, that's being left up on Twitter, so they're the ones that burn down the cities,
[09:07.760 --> 09:11.280]  they're the ones that say confront the political opponents and be violent, they're the ones
[09:11.280 --> 09:15.640]  doing all this, they're the ones that have been caught staging events like the Whitmer
[09:15.640 --> 09:21.760]  situation and dressing up like white supremacists and going to pro-America rallies to try to
[09:21.760 --> 09:29.800]  foment dissension, that's their major move, and yes, please put the headline back on
[09:29.800 --> 09:37.200]  screen, there it is, Alex Jones tells his audience to use political violence and prepare
[09:37.200 --> 09:43.640]  for war, so you go watch the piece, that's from the young Turks, it's the same talking
[09:43.640 --> 09:47.920]  point, it's the same thing, it's all over the news now, trended on Twitter yesterday,
[09:47.920 --> 09:52.960]  Alex Jones wants violence and there's nowhere me calling for violence, in fact I'm calling
[09:52.960 --> 09:57.400]  for the opposite and I'm saying they're getting ready to set us up and then they set me up
[09:57.400 --> 10:10.600]  and say I'm calling for violence, that's how stupid they think you are, meanwhile we don't
[10:10.600 --> 10:14.880]  just have swallows well and others over the years saying we'll use nuclear weapons on
[10:14.880 --> 10:21.720]  gun owners, remember that, we now have Biden and his press secretary saying yeah, we're
[10:21.720 --> 10:25.440]  worried about Republicans being fascist and worried about violence and worried about them
[10:25.440 --> 10:31.520]  taking America's rights and today Biden is set to give a big speech about the big threat
[10:31.520 --> 10:38.320]  of domestic terrorism and the Republican Party, they're trying to outlaw their political opposition,
[10:38.320 --> 10:45.040]  they're trying to create a uniparty, Biden says the military can obliterate the second
[10:45.040 --> 10:50.080]  amendment, headline, remember the time the swallows well said and it would be a short
[10:50.080 --> 10:55.240]  war my friend, the government has news, too many of them, but they're legit, I'm sure
[10:55.240 --> 11:01.960]  if we talked we could find common ground to protect our families and communities, Biden
[11:01.960 --> 11:11.600]  goes on to say that a 223 or 556 round goes out of a barrel at four or five times the
[11:11.600 --> 11:15.320]  rate of any other bullet, that's another lie, he says a 9mm bullet is the most powerful
[11:15.320 --> 11:18.560]  and blows the lung out of your body, it's actually a weak round, it's just all pure
[11:18.560 --> 11:26.840]  crap, absolute babbling BS, White House team's Trump supporters extremist threat, so they're
[11:26.840 --> 11:33.320]  telling you it's imminent the right wingers are going to attack everything, KJP says
[11:33.320 --> 11:40.160]  Joe Biden thinks Maga Republicans are an extreme threat for our democracy, freedom and rights,
[11:40.160 --> 11:45.320]  meanwhile we've got a peaceful Marine that only went in the capital, USMC veteran Ryan
[11:45.320 --> 11:56.320]  Nichols has spent 590 days of solitary confinement and the Atlantic Monthly owned by the Jeffrey
[11:56.320 --> 12:03.960]  Epstein folks says they fear fascism, it's here, the Republicans are fascist and they've
[12:03.960 --> 12:10.480]  got to be dealt with right now, so the writings on the wall was 68 days out, I hope by exposing
[12:10.480 --> 12:14.600]  this and I hope by knowing there's a lot of good FBI agents and other federal agents
[12:14.600 --> 12:21.000]  that are whistleblowers that exposed the Russia gate was fake and exposed and leaked audio
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.680]  that the Whitmer kidnapping plot was staged and all these other whistleblowers now coming
[12:27.680 --> 12:33.240]  out exposing that they hid the Hunter Biden laptop and the FBI files under secret and
[12:33.240 --> 12:38.600]  ordered the FBI not to investigate it, that's their Achilles heel is good people in every
[12:38.600 --> 12:44.560]  level of society not complying and standing up and saying this stuff is wrong, this fight
[12:44.560 --> 12:54.200]  for the soul of the world, the soul of America has been going on a long time ladies and gentlemen
[12:54.200 --> 13:00.040]  and I just want to say something here before I get into all this, I was offered the big
[13:00.040 --> 13:07.800]  Fox News shows more than 10 years ago, I was offered to go meet with Henry Kissinger, Kissinger
[13:07.800 --> 13:13.320]  group by the head of the Kissinger group Rothkopf, get in front of my producer, one of the few
[13:13.320 --> 13:16.040]  stories I could tell because the others were off record, there were a bunch of other off
[13:16.040 --> 13:23.160]  record and I said no, because the offer was public, I mean it was stated not public but
[13:23.160 --> 13:28.320]  stated it was open that we're going to manage you and run you, you can still be the populist
[13:28.320 --> 13:34.840]  leader but you'll have a seat at the table but you're going to be part of the team and
[13:34.840 --> 13:38.760]  you'll be the other end of the controlled opposition and I said I don't want to be part
[13:38.760 --> 13:44.840]  of that because I know this is an anti-human new world order and is corrupt and evil and
[13:44.840 --> 13:51.120]  destined to fail and I don't want to be a big fat cat and destroy and enslave people.
[13:51.120 --> 13:54.600]  That's why it's so frustrating that I've been successful thanks to your support and
[13:54.600 --> 13:59.520]  our hard work in independence and liberty and freedom and we've proven betting on humanity
[13:59.520 --> 14:03.280]  was the right thing to do but I've been through the gauntlet, I've been through the trials,
[14:03.280 --> 14:06.320]  I've been through the tribulations, I've been to the mountain, I've been down the
[14:06.320 --> 14:10.600]  valleys, I've been in the caves, I've been into their system and I know who they are
[14:10.600 --> 14:15.760]  and the whole thing's out the open now, 9 out of 10 dying of COVID or triple vaxed,
[14:15.760 --> 14:21.880]  mainline British Medical Journal, lands it, I mean folks they're killing everybody, they're
[14:21.880 --> 14:28.000]  attacking us on 100 fronts, this is a psychotic death cold, you know why would they do that
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.160]  because they have an instinct for dominance and control, they think there's too many of
[14:31.160 --> 14:34.520]  us and in some cases we are getting fat and lazy and there are too many of us in some
[14:34.520 --> 14:38.440]  cases but you don't then hand them godlike power to run around and slaughter everybody
[14:38.440 --> 14:41.760]  because of it, when they're the very worst people they've made things as bad as they
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.400]  can because they don't want competition.
[14:45.400 --> 14:49.120]  So to everybody that served the system and been fools and part of this, you can see now
[14:49.120 --> 14:54.680]  it's really bad, you won't have a good standard of living, you won't have a future, now a
[14:54.680 --> 14:58.720]  lot of you are scared so you join the system and think well I'll just have a good position
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.720]  on the pile of skulls, you're a fool but you know people that have already sold out to
[15:03.720 --> 15:08.040]  evil they're weak, they come from weak families, they're sad people, some of them may wake
[15:08.040 --> 15:12.400]  up but that's not where our solution is, our solution is praying to God, being peaceful,
[15:12.400 --> 15:17.520]  being politically active, but being bold and waking others up who are good, hearted but
[15:17.520 --> 15:20.720]  who are not aware of what's happening and people are ready to hear the truth now, they're
[15:20.720 --> 15:25.080]  ready to wake up but you can bet when I started saying they're going to stay something big
[15:25.080 --> 15:29.960]  before the election they went completely crazy and the talking point went out to say Jones
[15:29.960 --> 15:34.320]  is calling for violence because they're so scared of what I'm saying, we're over the
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.440]  target, we know how to beat the enemy politically, culturally, economically, spiritually but
[15:39.440 --> 15:45.320]  we've got to understand we're not in our normal comfort zones, everyone is in extreme grave
[15:45.320 --> 15:50.520]  danger including the New World Order and their idiot minions who are literally pushing us
[15:50.520 --> 15:56.200]  into the inferno, this is going to be incredibly violent and incredibly destructive if we don't
[15:56.200 --> 16:00.200]  turn it back now, peace now.
[16:00.200 --> 16:05.240]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular
[16:05.240 --> 16:10.880]  system, for your brain, for every part of your body but what I don't see being promoted

[17:11.600 --> 17:15.480]  week, I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go Turboforce is my favorite

[17:19.560 --> 17:26.360]  of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you, nobody wakes up in the morning
[17:26.360 --> 17:29.040]  and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life, I'm going to wake
[17:29.040 --> 17:32.680]  up today, you know what, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over
[17:32.680 --> 17:36.640]  there healthier, happier and richer, I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend,
[17:36.640 --> 17:39.440]  I don't think that happens very often, it's never happened to me, I've never had anyone
[17:39.440 --> 17:42.800]  knock on my door and said Tate, you're such a good guy, how can I improve your life in
[17:42.800 --> 17:43.800]  every single way?

[21:50.040 --> 21:56.120]  against the second amendment here it is and for those brave right wing americans to say

[22:01.800 --> 22:06.000]  to fight against the country you need a f-15 you need to something a little more than a
[22:06.000 --> 22:14.920]  gun no i'm not joking think about this think about the rationale we use that's you and
[22:14.920 --> 22:21.440]  here are the headlines democrats say republicans planning violence fbi says republicans planning

[22:46.800 --> 22:50.880]  the headline alex jones sells his audience use political violence and prepare for war
[22:50.880 --> 22:55.760]  did said no such thing called for peace in that very segment but they edit it and then
[22:55.760 --> 23:02.520]  try to deceive but the edit doesn't even say what they say i said i mean this is lying
[23:02.520 --> 23:08.000]  at new levels here it is seventy one days we're going to see some very violent fireworks
[23:08.000 --> 23:18.000]  i would predict racially motivated mass shootings bombings poisonings attacks on power supplies
[23:18.000 --> 23:24.120]  being blamed on the right wing they intend to bring in a full dictatorship in the next
[23:24.120 --> 23:30.480]  71 days and we are all strapped to this thing this is such a dangerous time and i would
[23:30.480 --> 23:36.920]  advise the globalist who are mid level that think they're about to have a leftist revolution
[23:36.920 --> 23:40.360]  the globalist don't actually plan the higher levels have that they plan on having a civil
[23:40.360 --> 23:47.720]  war that brings down america and you'll be the fall guy now where am i calling for violence
[23:47.720 --> 23:54.240]  it's not there imagine putting that out and they go on for 10 minutes in sam culling for
[23:54.240 --> 24:02.000]  violence and if you read the comments this is all over the place jones used to be in
[24:02.000 --> 24:08.040]  a mental hospital jones wants civil war and domestic terrorism alex jones the full blown
[24:08.040 --> 24:15.160]  fire and brimstone preacher they go on a bunch of them call for my arrest call for my death
[24:15.160 --> 24:23.600]  shoot them all i'm in this is what they're saying i mean imagine being a viewer of these
[24:23.600 --> 24:29.400]  people and and they tell you a clip says something and it doesn't say that and then you call
[24:29.400 --> 24:36.000]  for our death just you're in a cult you believe two men can have a baby the left is openly
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.760]  now promoting in public schools we have the clips here all over the country from texas
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.120]  california to new york florida and democrat held areas that it's minor attractive persons
[24:45.120 --> 24:50.320]  don't be mean to somebody that wants to have sex with children they're a minor attracted
[24:50.320 --> 25:04.320]  person well that's a sexual preference man so how do we stop them staging the next big
[25:04.320 --> 25:09.120]  event i mean they're already putting an election fraud they're already using mail-in ballots
[25:09.120 --> 25:12.360]  they're already having millions of people that moved out of state voting over and over again
[25:12.360 --> 25:17.760]  they got dead people voting from thirty forty years ago they've got it all going on and
[25:17.760 --> 25:22.680]  they're trying to outlaw people that don't want open borders or don't want force inoculations
[25:22.680 --> 25:27.520]  or don't want new lockdowns or question elections and they're on the news saying we need to silence
[25:27.520 --> 25:31.480]  anybody that says the elections might not be fair even though the number one rule the
[25:31.480 --> 25:35.800]  state department overseeing elections is that you should be able to say you thought they
[25:35.800 --> 25:39.480]  were stolen whether you're right or not and there should be oversight and and in the
[25:39.480 --> 25:44.360]  u.s could not even get near passing its own state department rules for a free and fair
[25:44.360 --> 25:51.320]  open election and then you've got democrats in more than a hundred local races around
[25:51.320 --> 25:58.160]  the country and state races and more than thirty congressional races openly trying with democrat
[25:58.160 --> 26:07.000]  party lawyers to get judges in court cases to bar current republican members of congress
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.320]  and people running for congress from being able to be on the ballot how is that not the
[26:12.320 --> 26:19.440]  definition of trying to stop people's votes by disqualifying who they want that's the
[26:19.440 --> 26:26.440]  ultimate form of election fraud to just not let someone run the whole national strategy
[26:26.440 --> 26:31.240]  for countering domestic terrorism but on a june of last year where it says our main
[26:31.240 --> 26:35.960]  enemy is the republicans and gun owners and veterans and people that question elections
[26:35.960 --> 26:43.120]  or lockdowns or force inoculations it says it yeah the rand corporation that's helping
[26:43.120 --> 26:48.240]  quarterback a lot of this domestic terrorism in the midterms race for domestic terror
[26:48.240 --> 26:55.160]  says the big globalist think tank i put that back on screen please they are full pedal
[26:55.160 --> 27:01.800]  to the metal saying this is in it and i go yeah it's imminent for you to stage it you've
[27:01.800 --> 27:07.080]  got the motive you've got the history you've been caught doing it their answer is did you
[27:07.080 --> 27:11.040]  hear what alex jones called for violence i'm on there saying we don't want violence don't
[27:11.040 --> 27:15.320]  get sucked into violence don't get provocateur into violence they've got all these heads

[27:19.560 --> 27:27.320]  now this is going on and i'm up here saying let's not be violent let's not get sucked
[27:27.320 --> 27:33.080]  into this and then their answer is jones is calling for violence that is wartime level
[27:33.080 --> 27:37.560]  propaganda they've run more articles on us the last five years i looked it up then they
[27:37.560 --> 27:43.720]  ran for the two thousand three gulf war hundreds of thousands of articles they put out articles
[27:43.720 --> 27:49.040]  every day they get put on every tv station in the country every local newspaper hammering
[27:49.040 --> 27:54.240]  alex jones because they see me as a populist and as their enemy and as an american and
[27:54.240 --> 28:01.440]  they think if they can turn you against me they'll can turn anybody against you god put

[28:22.280 --> 28:29.760]  to frame us to have a pretext to bring in real martial law if you think the six hundred
[28:29.760 --> 28:36.080]  or so political presidents who almost six hundred days without being able to even have
[28:36.080 --> 28:42.840]  a trial in solitary confinement sped that's the beta test for everybody so yeah there's

[33:26.800 --> 33:33.800]  well you're living I'm living in incredibly historic dangerous times but all over the
[33:33.800 --> 33:37.520]  world from Canada to Australia to zealand to South America and Brazil all over eastern
[33:37.520 --> 33:41.720]  Europe the US people are waking up to the global milterberg group world economic forum
[33:41.720 --> 33:50.400]  mafia here is a major leader member of parliament pierre polyvir in Canada saying he will move
[33:50.400 --> 33:56.600]  to ban ministers if he becomes the new leader of Canada from serving on the board of the
[33:56.600 --> 34:03.600]  world economic forum or being their alumni here's the clip
[34:03.600 --> 34:29.520]  you
[34:29.520 --> 34:33.520]  Minister of Serenity involved in the World Economic Forum.
[34:35.520 --> 34:37.520]  Rousing applause.
[34:37.520 --> 34:39.520]  Yeah! Freedom!
[34:39.520 --> 34:43.520]  You don't want outside corporate globalist dictatorships.
[34:44.520 --> 34:47.520]  If you want to know what victory looks like,
[34:47.520 --> 34:49.520]  if you want to know how to stop these people
[34:49.520 --> 34:51.520]  who are cutting off your power,
[34:51.520 --> 34:52.520]  dissolving your borders,
[34:52.520 --> 34:53.520]  deviling your currency,
[34:53.520 --> 34:55.520]  targeting your children,
[34:55.520 --> 34:58.520]  coming at you with lockdowns and forced injections,
[34:58.520 --> 35:02.520]  it's all the Fortune 500 through the World Economic Forum
[35:02.520 --> 35:04.520]  that is their spokesperson.
[35:04.520 --> 35:07.520]  And that's why whatever Klaus Schwab says happens,
[35:07.520 --> 35:10.520]  because they have penetrated the majority of governments
[35:10.520 --> 35:14.520]  and are in control of half the government cabinets of the world
[35:14.520 --> 35:16.520]  in Klaus Schwab's own words,
[35:16.520 --> 35:18.520]  and I think that's a conservative estimate.
[35:19.520 --> 35:21.520]  That's illegal.
[35:21.520 --> 35:23.520]  That's ridiculous.
[35:23.520 --> 35:25.520]  That's outrageous.
[35:25.520 --> 35:29.520]  And we can stop them with this information.
[35:29.520 --> 35:31.520]  In fact, I'm going to take that clip
[35:31.520 --> 35:33.520]  and post it on the live show feed today,
[35:33.520 --> 35:35.520]  the live show, Emergency Red Alert,
[35:35.520 --> 35:37.520]  headline we've got up there,
[35:37.520 --> 35:39.520]  because that's the stuff of victory.
[35:39.520 --> 35:41.520]  And that's why I hammer it.
[35:41.520 --> 35:42.520]  I know regular listeners are like,
[35:42.520 --> 35:45.520]  Jones, every hour you say identify the World Economic Forum,
[35:45.520 --> 35:46.520]  identify the Great Reset,
[35:46.520 --> 35:47.520]  identify the World Shutdown,
[35:47.520 --> 35:49.520]  identify it, we know that.
[35:49.520 --> 35:51.520]  Well, the general public doesn't know it yet.
[35:51.520 --> 35:54.520]  And if we're in a war and we don't know who the enemy is,
[35:54.520 --> 35:56.520]  we don't have a chance of winning.
[35:56.520 --> 35:59.520]  If we know who the enemy is and they're horrible
[35:59.520 --> 36:01.520]  and they want horrible things for people,
[36:04.520 --> 36:06.520]  you don't want to be conquered by these folks.
[36:06.520 --> 36:08.520]  They're bad, and so it's a no-brainer.
[36:08.520 --> 36:10.520]  They have a bad audiology.
[36:10.520 --> 36:12.520]  They're sick, evil, inbred globalists
[36:12.520 --> 36:14.520]  with a bunch of filthy royalty running it,
[36:14.520 --> 36:16.520]  a bunch of Bill Gates and fouchy trash.
[36:16.520 --> 36:20.520]  And all we got to do is light them up with information
[36:20.520 --> 36:24.520]  lays the target for peaceful political annihilation
[36:24.520 --> 36:26.520]  of their system.
[36:26.520 --> 36:28.520]  And yes, I'm on a kamikaze mission,
[36:28.520 --> 36:30.520]  not because I'm a badass,
[36:30.520 --> 36:32.520]  or not because I got to prove something to people.
[36:32.520 --> 36:35.520]  I can't take it from them.
[36:35.520 --> 36:37.520]  I will not support pedophilia.
[36:37.520 --> 36:39.520]  I will not support devil worship.
[36:39.520 --> 36:40.520]  I will not support market-to-beast.
[36:40.520 --> 36:42.520]  I will not support world government
[36:42.520 --> 36:44.520]  because I don't want to be cut off from God.
[36:44.520 --> 36:46.520]  And folks, you are eternal beings.
[36:46.520 --> 36:48.520]  And if you don't stand against this,
[36:48.520 --> 36:50.520]  you will be cut off from God,
[36:50.520 --> 36:54.520]  and in your gut right now, you know it.
[36:54.520 --> 36:56.520]  People ask, how do you not have fear?
[36:56.520 --> 36:58.520]  How do you keep going?
[36:58.520 --> 37:00.520]  I mean, join these people?
[37:00.520 --> 37:02.520]  Join Satan?
[37:04.520 --> 37:06.520]  I do have fear of God
[37:06.520 --> 37:08.520]  in being cut off from God.
[37:08.520 --> 37:12.520]  I don't have one ounce of fear of these people
[37:12.520 --> 37:14.520]  because I want to away from them.
[37:14.520 --> 37:16.520]  Do I feel weak sometimes?
[37:16.520 --> 37:18.520]  Am I mad at myself? I'm not strong enough?
[37:18.520 --> 37:20.520]  Am I flesh as weak?
[37:20.520 --> 37:22.520]  Absolutely.
[37:22.520 --> 37:24.520]  But I know stuff's going to get worse
[37:24.520 --> 37:26.520]  and worse and worse,
[37:26.520 --> 37:28.520]  and you're going to wish later you'd done something.
[37:28.520 --> 37:30.520]  You're going to wish later you'd been all in
[37:30.520 --> 37:32.520]  against these people,
[37:32.520 --> 37:34.520]  but they just incrementally turn up the heat
[37:34.520 --> 37:36.520]  like the frog in the pot.
[37:36.520 --> 37:38.520]  So let me hit a bunch of news here today
[37:38.520 --> 37:40.520]  because folks have asked, hey, about once a week
[37:40.520 --> 37:42.520]  you're not doing the show, you're gone some,
[37:42.520 --> 37:44.520]  why are you doing it?
[37:44.520 --> 37:46.520]  Why are you here?
[37:46.520 --> 37:48.520]  Because when I'm fresh,
[37:48.520 --> 37:50.520]  and I get up at like 5 a.m.,
[37:50.520 --> 37:52.520]  I make better decisions
[37:52.520 --> 37:54.520]  and I can do things,
[37:54.520 --> 37:56.520]  and I just, I can work till 10 at night,
[37:56.520 --> 37:58.520]  but I just, at 48,
[37:58.520 --> 38:00.520]  I keep working like a robot,
[38:00.520 --> 38:02.520]  but the decisions aren't good.
[38:02.520 --> 38:04.520]  So I'm having
[38:04.520 --> 38:06.520]  seven days a week on Saturdays and Sundays,
[38:06.520 --> 38:08.520]  and at least one or two days a week,
[38:08.520 --> 38:10.520]  I'm now cutting how much to do the show
[38:10.520 --> 38:12.520]  because I'm battle-planning
[38:12.520 --> 38:14.520]  how to keep this operation on air
[38:14.520 --> 38:16.520]  and I'm just sitting in my office for hours
[38:16.520 --> 38:18.520]  and just thinking about
[38:18.520 --> 38:20.520]  the New World Order and their operations
[38:20.520 --> 38:22.520]  and just trying to get full integration
[38:22.520 --> 38:24.520]  with the Holy Spirit,
[38:24.520 --> 38:26.520]  and it takes real focus to do that
[38:26.520 --> 38:28.520]  to get the downloads.
[38:28.520 --> 38:30.520]  And I'm getting them, I'm getting super intense
[38:30.520 --> 38:32.520]  enemy operation blueprints, okay?
[38:32.520 --> 38:34.520]  And the enemy knows that and they're really upset.
[38:34.520 --> 38:36.520]  So I just, I have to have some downtime
[38:36.520 --> 38:38.520]  to just sit in a room
[38:38.520 --> 38:40.520]  in a dark room
[38:40.520 --> 38:42.520]  and just sit for hours focused,
[38:42.520 --> 38:44.520]  and that's what I've been doing.
[38:46.520 --> 38:48.520]  And quite frankly,
[38:48.520 --> 38:50.520]  I really should just go off the air for a few weeks
[38:50.520 --> 38:52.520]  because I need to just totally
[38:54.520 --> 38:56.520]  conjugate
[39:00.520 --> 39:02.520]  on what we need to do,
[39:02.520 --> 39:04.520]  and I don't compare myself to some biblical prophet,
[39:04.520 --> 39:06.520]  but we are in these latter days,
[39:06.520 --> 39:08.520]  there's no doubt about that,
[39:08.520 --> 39:10.520]  and what do they all do, what did Christ do?
[39:10.520 --> 39:12.520]  He went away to the desert,
[39:12.520 --> 39:14.520]  went away to the mountains, went away
[39:14.520 --> 39:16.520]  to just totally focus
[39:16.520 --> 39:18.520]  and really get the download
[39:18.520 --> 39:20.520]  and really get prepared.
[39:20.520 --> 39:22.520]  But you know what, we're in the middle of it now,
[39:22.520 --> 39:24.520]  so there's no time for that.
[39:24.520 --> 39:26.520]  But everybody should be thinking about this,
[39:26.520 --> 39:28.520]  everybody should be spending time praying,
[39:28.520 --> 39:30.520]  everybody should be getting on your knees.
[39:30.520 --> 39:32.520]  I'll sit there in a dark room for like an hour,
[39:32.520 --> 39:34.520]  I'll write some notes
[39:34.520 --> 39:36.520]  and then, man, it's just like I get on my knees
[39:36.520 --> 39:38.520]  and just the
[39:38.520 --> 39:40.520]  and it's just
[39:40.520 --> 39:42.520]  right there.
[39:42.520 --> 39:44.520]  And it's that act of
[39:44.520 --> 39:46.520]  submission, and the quiet place,
[39:46.520 --> 39:48.520]  the most high, and my understanding of the enemy
[39:48.520 --> 39:50.520]  and how to defeat them is so clear when I'm in that place,
[39:50.520 --> 39:52.520]  and we need to be in that place
[39:52.520 --> 39:54.520]  and not let them distract us from our main mission.
[39:54.520 --> 39:56.520]  We've got to think 10, 20, 30 moves ahead,
[39:56.520 --> 39:58.520]  we have the Holy Spirit,
[39:58.520 --> 40:00.520]  the real intelligence,
[40:00.520 --> 40:02.520]  that'll dwarf anything the enemy can even imagine,
[40:02.520 --> 40:04.520]  but we've got to get in touch
[40:04.520 --> 40:06.520]  with the source.
[40:06.520 --> 40:08.520]  So I need listeners,
[40:08.520 --> 40:10.520]  I'm asking listeners to pray for me
[40:10.520 --> 40:12.520]  and to help give me discernment
[40:12.520 --> 40:14.520]  and focus and strength
[40:14.520 --> 40:16.520]  so that I can interface
[40:16.520 --> 40:18.520]  in a more pure manner
[40:18.520 --> 40:20.520]  and I need you to do those same prayers for yourself.
[40:20.520 --> 40:22.520]  I'm not telling you what to do, but I just,
[40:22.520 --> 40:24.520]  that's the Holy Spirit
[40:24.520 --> 40:26.520]  guiding me. We need to just pray
[40:26.520 --> 40:28.520]  for interface with God.
[40:28.520 --> 40:30.520]  Now that said, oh, it's taken over
[40:30.520 --> 40:32.520]  in a little while, and I haven't hit one
[40:32.520 --> 40:34.520]  tenth of what I came in here to cover,
[40:34.520 --> 40:36.520]  because I wasn't even going to do the show today.
[40:36.520 --> 40:38.520]  I'll be here all four hours,
[40:38.520 --> 40:40.520]  maybe four hours tomorrow.
[40:40.520 --> 40:42.520]  And
[40:42.520 --> 40:44.520]  all this stuff is so insanely powerful.
[40:44.520 --> 40:46.520]  I'm not just saying this, it's almost like
[40:46.520 --> 40:48.520]  with 20 minutes left of the hour,
[40:48.520 --> 40:50.520]  you can't do this justice.
[40:50.520 --> 40:52.520]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[40:52.520 --> 40:54.520]  Again, here's the key.
[40:54.520 --> 40:56.520]  They get you to adapt to being a slave,
[40:56.520 --> 40:58.520]  and they hit you with it
[40:58.520 --> 41:00.520]  and it just keeps increasing.
[41:00.520 --> 41:02.520]  You just think, well,
[41:02.520 --> 41:04.520]  subconsciously you can deal with it,
[41:04.520 --> 41:06.520]  but we can't.
[41:06.520 --> 41:08.520]  And what I'm getting at here is,
[41:08.520 --> 41:10.520]  this is the main attack.
[41:10.520 --> 41:12.520]  This is the beginning of the main assault.
[41:12.520 --> 41:14.520]  And we're in the middle of the beginning right now.
[41:14.520 --> 41:16.520]  And the beginning will soon be over,
[41:16.520 --> 41:18.520]  and then we're going to be in the thick
[41:18.520 --> 41:20.520]  of stuff that is just going to,
[41:20.520 --> 41:22.520]  if you think you've seen craziness
[41:22.520 --> 41:24.520]  in the last three years,
[41:24.520 --> 41:26.520]  sweetheart, none of us have seen anything.
[41:26.520 --> 41:28.520]  And I'm just telling you, you better run up
[41:28.520 --> 41:30.520]  under God's wings, because
[41:30.520 --> 41:32.520]  this is going to be the main test.
[41:32.520 --> 41:34.520]  And I bet on humanity,
[41:34.520 --> 41:36.520]  I had four children,
[41:36.520 --> 41:38.520]  and I did it because it was the right thing to do,
[41:38.520 --> 41:40.520]  but man, I got to tell you,
[41:40.520 --> 41:42.520]  every day I think about my children,
[41:42.520 --> 41:44.520]  I think about your children, I think about what we're up against,
[41:44.520 --> 41:46.520]  and we have just got to get back
[41:46.520 --> 41:48.520]  to God, and we got to do it now.
[41:48.520 --> 41:50.520]  Not next week, not next month.
[41:50.520 --> 41:52.520]  We got to make fighting this
[41:52.520 --> 41:54.520]  tyranny our 100%
[41:54.520 --> 41:56.520]  focused, and we got to sacrifice,
[41:56.520 --> 41:58.520]  and we got to commit, and we got to be
[41:58.520 --> 42:00.520]  men and women, and we got to be strong,
[42:00.520 --> 42:02.520]  and understand that only total commitment
[42:04.520 --> 42:06.520]  will spare the children
[42:06.520 --> 42:08.520]  the brunt of the attack. It is not up to us,
[42:08.520 --> 42:10.520]  it's men to survive this.
[42:10.520 --> 42:12.520]  It is not up to you as women to survive this.
[42:12.520 --> 42:14.520]  Stop thinking about your own lazy,
[42:14.520 --> 42:16.520]  weak asses.
[42:16.520 --> 42:18.520]  I'm lazy, I'm weak too,
[42:18.520 --> 42:20.520]  but in Christ I'm strong.
[42:20.520 --> 42:22.520]  You got to get there,
[42:22.520 --> 42:24.520]  and you got to get there now.
[42:24.520 --> 42:26.520]  Just believe me,
[42:26.520 --> 42:28.520]  kissing the New World Order's ass
[42:28.520 --> 42:30.520]  ain't going to get you out of this.
[42:30.520 --> 42:32.520]  It's going to make it worse.
[42:32.520 --> 42:34.520]  You don't have any choice, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:34.520 --> 42:36.520]  You have zero choice.
[42:36.520 --> 42:38.520]  Be annihilated and destroyed and cut off from God,
[42:38.520 --> 42:40.520]  or join God in eternity.
[42:40.520 --> 42:42.520]  Now, damn it, that's not a choice,
[42:42.520 --> 42:44.520]  is it? Join God now.
[42:44.520 --> 42:46.520]  Now.
[42:46.520 --> 42:48.520]  Take the decision.
[42:48.520 --> 42:50.520]  I love Jesus. I hate Satan.
[42:50.520 --> 42:52.520]  I love God.
[42:52.520 --> 42:54.520]  I love the children. I love creation.
[42:54.520 --> 43:22.520]  I love beauty. I hate evil.
[43:36.520 --> 43:38.520]  Now, vitamin mineral fusion is our overall best selling product.
[43:38.520 --> 43:40.520]  It finally came in a month ago,
[43:40.520 --> 43:42.520]  and we've almost sold out of the first shipment.
[43:42.520 --> 43:44.520]  Hopefully, more is coming in a few months.
[43:44.520 --> 43:46.520]  But if you want to experience vitamin mineral fusion,
[43:46.520 --> 43:48.520]  and its effects for yourself,
[43:48.520 --> 43:50.520]  or maybe you already love it, you want to stock up.
[43:50.520 --> 43:52.520]  Thanks for keeping us on the air,
[43:52.520 --> 43:54.520]  vitamin mineral fusion is 40% off,
[43:54.520 --> 43:56.520]  even though it's selling out at infowarstore.com.
[43:56.520 --> 43:58.520]  Thanks for your support.
[43:58.520 --> 44:00.520]  There is nothing, there is no more
[44:00.520 --> 44:02.520]  epitome of free speech
[44:02.520 --> 44:04.520]  than right here.
[44:04.520 --> 44:06.520]  And that's what people
[44:06.520 --> 44:08.520]  recognize and resonate with.
[44:08.520 --> 44:10.520]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find
[44:10.520 --> 44:12.520]  a better place for information.
[44:12.520 --> 44:14.520]  You might not agree with everything.
[44:14.520 --> 44:16.520]  You might not agree with all our perspectives,
[44:16.520 --> 44:18.520]  but we cover all the information.
[44:18.520 --> 44:20.520]  And there's nowhere else really that does it
[44:20.520 --> 44:22.520]  like we do here. Thank you for that, Ward.
[44:22.520 --> 44:24.520]  infowarstore.com, by the way,
[44:24.520 --> 44:26.520]  the products he mentions, infowarstore.com
[44:26.520 --> 44:28.520]  is where to get them, folks, and we do have
[44:28.520 --> 44:30.520]  the best supplements. I mean, just like we try
[44:30.520 --> 44:32.520]  our best with our news coverage
[44:32.520 --> 44:34.520]  and our information,
[44:34.520 --> 44:36.520]  we do the best with our supplements
[44:36.520 --> 44:38.520]  as well.
[44:38.520 --> 44:40.520]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[44:40.520 --> 44:42.520]  Folks, this is a joke.
[44:42.520 --> 44:44.520]  I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off.
[44:44.520 --> 44:46.520]  By the way, it works for me.
[44:46.520 --> 44:48.520]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula
[44:48.520 --> 44:50.520]  is working for me.
[44:50.520 --> 44:52.520]  Quite well, I might add.
[44:52.520 --> 44:54.520]  Quite well, my barber appreciates
[44:54.520 --> 44:56.520]  hair and beard support for men.
[44:56.520 --> 44:58.520]  I go and see him quite often now.
[44:58.520 --> 45:00.520]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria
[45:00.520 --> 45:02.520]  or pump gas, or whether you're a farmer,
[45:02.520 --> 45:04.520]  a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[45:04.520 --> 45:06.520]  Fortune and Money magazine
[45:06.520 --> 45:08.520]  have all done these profiles.
[45:08.520 --> 45:10.520]  You see it every year. 30 different tax returns,
[45:10.520 --> 45:12.520]  30 different answers.
[45:12.520 --> 45:14.520]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[45:14.520 --> 45:16.520]  And almost all of them
[45:16.520 --> 45:18.520]  just screw you over,
[45:18.520 --> 45:20.520]  especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[45:20.520 --> 45:22.520]  because they're part of the system
[45:22.520 --> 45:24.520]  and they don't want the general public
[45:24.520 --> 45:26.520]  understanding this and knowing this.
[45:26.520 --> 45:28.520]  So it's a very important situation with inflation
[45:28.520 --> 45:30.520]  and all the things out there hurting everybody
[45:30.520 --> 45:32.520]  to be able to
[45:32.520 --> 45:34.520]  do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful
[45:34.520 --> 45:36.520]  that allows you to keep more of your money.
[45:36.520 --> 45:38.520]  We wouldn't even be here
[45:38.520 --> 45:40.520]  if I hadn't gotten great tax advice
[45:40.520 --> 45:42.520]  in the last few years.
[45:42.520 --> 45:44.520]  The only way you fail is not
[45:44.520 --> 45:46.520]  writing down the URL
[45:46.520 --> 45:48.520]  jonestaxrelief.com
[45:48.520 --> 45:50.520]  or call 833-900-4285
[45:50.520 --> 45:52.520]  833-900-4285
[45:52.520 --> 45:54.520]  833-900-4285
[45:54.520 --> 45:56.520]  833-900-4285
[45:56.520 --> 45:58.520]  833-900-4285
[45:58.520 --> 46:00.520]  833-900-4285
[46:00.520 --> 46:02.520]  Do you see Alex Jones crazy?
[46:02.520 --> 46:04.520]  He's a conspiracy theory guy.
[46:04.520 --> 46:06.520]  He's a nutcase. He's got these rants and all that.
[46:06.520 --> 46:08.520]  What they miss
[46:08.520 --> 46:10.520]  is that this guy's ahead of the curve
[46:10.520 --> 46:12.520]  on so many different topics
[46:12.520 --> 46:14.520]  with no signal, not noise.
[46:14.520 --> 46:16.520]  If you look at the signal
[46:16.520 --> 46:18.520]  and you compare that
[46:18.520 --> 46:20.520]  to PBS and NPR and BBC
[46:20.520 --> 46:22.520]  and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there
[46:22.520 --> 46:24.520]  versus what your collective body
[46:24.520 --> 46:26.520]  has put out there
[46:26.520 --> 46:28.520]  and if you're sitting in a human being
[46:28.520 --> 46:30.520]  and just watching it, you say, well, Alex Jones
[46:30.520 --> 46:32.520]  is ahead of this. Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[46:32.520 --> 46:34.520]  You are one of the great thinkers
[46:34.520 --> 46:36.520]  of this. That is very rare.
[46:36.520 --> 46:38.520]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation
[46:38.520 --> 46:40.520]  and see that.
[46:40.520 --> 46:42.520]  I got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me
[46:42.520 --> 46:44.520]  I read this thing. I go, this is it.
[46:44.520 --> 46:46.520]  This is no Beatrix.
[46:46.520 --> 46:48.520]  You're not going to be flipping pages.
[46:48.520 --> 46:50.520]  You're going to be having a pin out and you're going to be underlining stuff.
[46:50.520 --> 46:52.520]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones.
[46:52.520 --> 46:54.520]  Order your copy now
[46:54.520 --> 47:10.520]  at amazonforinfowarsstore.com.
[47:26.520 --> 47:28.520]  I'm going to drill back into this
[47:28.520 --> 47:30.520]  because this is such a big deal just where we're at.
[47:30.520 --> 47:32.520]  Of course, there will be more of this tomorrow.
[47:32.520 --> 47:34.520]  It's all out in the open.
[47:34.520 --> 47:36.520]  Look at these headlines.
[47:36.520 --> 47:38.520]  We should ask the archivist
[47:38.520 --> 47:40.520]  just because it's not about tooting our horn.
[47:40.520 --> 47:42.520]  Look, we were right again.
[47:42.520 --> 47:44.520]  It just really impresses people online
[47:44.520 --> 47:46.520]  and gets tens of millions of views every time.
[47:46.520 --> 47:48.520]  I say something 10, 20 years ago and it comes exactly true.
[47:48.520 --> 47:50.520]  But I wasn't
[47:50.520 --> 47:52.520]  imagining this stuff.
[47:52.520 --> 47:54.520]  10 years ago, I came up with a plan
[47:54.520 --> 47:56.520]  for carbon taxes for all of it
[47:56.520 --> 47:58.520]  and for the thermostats and all the smart
[47:58.520 --> 48:00.520]  gadgetry
[48:00.520 --> 48:02.520]  to control what goes on in your house and your car and your life
[48:02.520 --> 48:04.520]  and to surveil you in live time.
[48:04.520 --> 48:06.520]  And now the Club of Rome and the Bilderberg Group
[48:06.520 --> 48:08.520]  and their front group, the WEF
[48:08.520 --> 48:10.520]  are all out in the open about that.
[48:10.520 --> 48:12.520]  But in China
[48:12.520 --> 48:14.520]  and now in the United States,
[48:14.520 --> 48:16.520]  in Colorado
[48:16.520 --> 48:18.520]  the major power companies
[48:18.520 --> 48:20.520]  are
[48:20.520 --> 48:22.520]  controlling your thermostat
[48:22.520 --> 48:24.520]  because again, they cut the energy off,
[48:24.520 --> 48:26.520]  they get rid of the generation systems,
[48:26.520 --> 48:28.520]  they cut the oil and the gas off
[48:28.520 --> 48:30.520]  and then
[48:30.520 --> 48:32.520]  they say to Californians,
[48:32.520 --> 48:34.520]  you can't charge your cars with non-electricity.
[48:34.520 --> 48:36.520]  And the numbers vary
[48:36.520 --> 48:38.520]  but a third of the cars
[48:38.520 --> 48:40.520]  by 2030 are electric like they want.
[48:40.520 --> 48:42.520]  You need a thousand more coal power plants.
[48:42.520 --> 48:44.520]  The energy won't be there
[48:44.520 --> 48:46.520]  by design.
[48:46.520 --> 48:48.520]  Germany's and Spain are already doing this.
[48:52.520 --> 48:54.520]  So look at this headline.
[48:54.520 --> 48:56.520]  The Denver Channel, mainstream news.
[48:56.520 --> 48:58.520]  Thousands of Excel customers
[48:58.520 --> 49:00.520]  locked out of thermostats during energy emergency.
[49:00.520 --> 49:02.520]  They say they took control
[49:02.520 --> 49:04.520]  of their thermostats for their own good.
[49:04.520 --> 49:06.520]  This was also done some in Texas a few years ago
[49:06.520 --> 49:08.520]  when they wouldn't let us up power
[49:08.520 --> 49:10.520]  during the blizzard.
[49:10.520 --> 49:12.520]  There it is.
[49:12.520 --> 49:14.520]  And people get these messages
[49:14.520 --> 49:16.520]  on their damn smart meters.
[49:16.520 --> 49:18.520]  Why would you put one in?
[49:18.520 --> 49:20.520]  Why would you do this?
[49:20.520 --> 49:22.520]  They don't ask, they just come put a smart meter in.
[49:22.520 --> 49:24.520]  Which then spies on all the other
[49:24.520 --> 49:26.520]  gadgetry, including your
[49:26.520 --> 49:28.520]  stinking cell phone.
[49:28.520 --> 49:30.520]  Told you,
[49:30.520 --> 49:32.520]  told you, I've been
[49:32.520 --> 49:34.520]  hammering this for 25 years
[49:34.520 --> 49:36.520]  and now we're here.
[49:36.520 --> 49:38.520]  It continues.
[49:38.520 --> 49:40.520]  That's just one article.
[49:40.520 --> 49:42.520]  Just
[49:42.520 --> 49:44.520]  days after phasing out
[49:44.520 --> 49:46.520]  new gas cars, California
[49:46.520 --> 49:48.520]  says, quote, avoiding charging
[49:48.520 --> 49:50.520]  electric vehicles amid
[49:50.520 --> 49:52.520]  grid emergency.
[49:52.520 --> 49:54.520]  Tucker Carlson does
[49:54.520 --> 49:56.520]  a great report breaking down how
[49:56.520 --> 49:58.520]  they use more carbon electric cars
[49:58.520 --> 50:00.520]  because it's carbon that generates most of the power.
[50:00.520 --> 50:02.520]  And they're toxic
[50:02.520 --> 50:04.520]  the way they make them, but that's okay.
[50:04.520 --> 50:06.520]  It's liberal.
[50:06.520 --> 50:08.520]  Another report.
[50:08.520 --> 50:10.520]  Major cities around the country
[50:10.520 --> 50:12.520]  say, sorry, forget
[50:12.520 --> 50:14.520]  not having clean water. Now you're not
[50:14.520 --> 50:16.520]  going to get water.
[50:16.520 --> 50:18.520]  There is no first world and third world
[50:18.520 --> 50:20.520]  anymore. There is the ascending
[50:20.520 --> 50:22.520]  world and there is the descending world
[50:22.520 --> 50:24.520]  and this is the descending world.
[50:24.520 --> 50:26.520]  Jackson, Mississippi says
[50:26.520 --> 50:28.520]  perhaps permanently
[50:28.520 --> 50:30.520]  there's a video clip
[50:30.520 --> 50:32.520]  you're not going to have
[50:32.520 --> 50:34.520]  power anymore. You're not going to have water
[50:34.520 --> 50:36.520]  anymore. They said you're not just
[50:36.520 --> 50:38.520]  don't get running water anymore.
[50:40.520 --> 50:42.520]  They flipped the switch folks, it's a great
[50:42.520 --> 50:44.520]  reset.
[50:44.520 --> 50:46.520]  You mean the mayor
[50:46.520 --> 50:48.520]  saying it?
[50:50.520 --> 50:52.520]  What is the answer? It goes back to that Canadian
[50:52.520 --> 50:54.520]  member of parliament, it's very popular
[50:54.520 --> 50:56.520]  running for prime minister.
[50:56.520 --> 50:58.520]  He says we're going to ban
[50:58.520 --> 51:00.520]  people that work for the World Economic Forum
[51:00.520 --> 51:02.520]  and outside force from
[51:02.520 --> 51:04.520]  office. How about we arrest their asses?
[51:04.520 --> 51:06.520]  All rules
[51:06.520 --> 51:08.520]  of the game, industrial architecture
[51:08.520 --> 51:10.520]  and physical supply chains will now have to change.
[51:12.520 --> 51:14.520]  Wholesale electricity prices have now collapsed
[51:14.520 --> 51:16.520]  in Europe after going up
[51:16.520 --> 51:18.520]  nine fold but it's not
[51:18.520 --> 51:20.520]  because the price is going down, no one
[51:20.520 --> 51:22.520]  can pay the bill. A third of
[51:22.520 --> 51:24.520]  American households can't pay their
[51:24.520 --> 51:26.520]  power bill in a national survey. It's
[51:26.520 --> 51:28.520]  half the Germans
[51:28.520 --> 51:30.520]  and their answer is don't
[51:30.520 --> 51:32.520]  take showers anymore and poop
[51:32.520 --> 51:34.520]  in the street.
[51:34.520 --> 51:36.520]  Energy crisis hits
[51:36.520 --> 51:38.520]  pubs harder than lockdown
[51:38.520 --> 51:40.520]  says industry bosses, remember they told you
[51:40.520 --> 51:42.520]  climate lockdowns are coming next
[51:42.520 --> 51:44.520]  after the virus lockdown
[51:44.520 --> 51:46.520]  and now, well how are they going to have that?
[51:46.520 --> 51:48.520]  Because you're not going to have the gas or fuel to go anywhere.
[51:48.520 --> 51:50.520]  You're not going to have the electricity.
[51:50.520 --> 51:52.520]  It's here, it ain't
[51:52.520 --> 51:54.520]  coming.
[51:54.520 --> 51:56.520]  It's everything the Extinction Rebellion
[51:56.520 --> 51:58.520]  does, the grassroots they're doing at the top
[51:58.520 --> 52:00.520]  as above so below.
[52:00.520 --> 52:02.520]  But the backlash against
[52:02.520 --> 52:04.520]  the WEF is growing.
[52:04.520 --> 52:06.520]  German economy minister
[52:06.520 --> 52:08.520]  Habek reportedly pushing for nuclear
[52:08.520 --> 52:10.520]  plants to stay on grid even though
[52:10.520 --> 52:12.520]  the government's ordering them turned off.
[52:12.520 --> 52:14.520]  Oh, we don't have any gas or fuel.
[52:14.520 --> 52:16.520]  We don't have oil.
[52:16.520 --> 52:18.520]  We don't have coal power plants. Turn the
[52:18.520 --> 52:20.520]  nukes off.
[52:22.520 --> 52:24.520]  What's happening with global warming?
[52:24.520 --> 52:26.520]  Nothing. They're turning
[52:26.520 --> 52:28.520]  your power off.
[52:28.520 --> 52:30.520]  Millions of Americans face
[52:30.520 --> 52:32.520]  eviction in coming months.
[52:32.520 --> 52:34.520]  Another big story in FullWars.com from
[52:34.520 --> 52:36.520]  Schiff Gold.
[52:36.520 --> 52:38.520]  U.S.
[52:38.520 --> 52:40.520]  Manufacturing Survey signals
[52:40.520 --> 52:42.520]  weakest growth in over two years.
[52:42.520 --> 52:44.520]  Prices paid plunges.
[52:44.520 --> 52:46.520]  Yeah, they created inflation with depression
[52:46.520 --> 52:48.520]  which is stagflation.
[52:48.520 --> 52:50.520]  The straw that breaks
[52:50.520 --> 52:52.520]  the market's back, the Fed
[52:52.520 --> 52:54.520]  must do 3.9 trillion
[52:54.520 --> 52:56.520]  in QT to control inflation which will expand it.
[52:56.520 --> 52:58.520]  And it goes on
[52:58.520 --> 53:00.520]  and on and on.
[53:00.520 --> 53:02.520]  But don't worry, we've got to do it because
[53:02.520 --> 53:04.520]  listen, do you want to hear something
[53:04.520 --> 53:06.520]  even more scary than Omnicron?
[53:06.520 --> 53:08.520]  Associated Press, NPR,
[53:08.520 --> 53:10.520]  Zombie Ice
[53:10.520 --> 53:12.520]  will raise sea levels more than twice
[53:12.520 --> 53:14.520]  as much as previously forecast.
[53:14.520 --> 53:16.520]  They were all supposed to already be underwater.
[53:16.520 --> 53:18.520]  Sea levels haven't gone up, but they put out thousands
[53:18.520 --> 53:20.520]  of stories today. Zombie Ice, we're all
[53:20.520 --> 53:22.520]  going to be underwater as the Democrats
[53:22.520 --> 53:24.520]  and globalist by oceanfront property.
[53:24.520 --> 53:26.520]  This is a big article from the Daily Skeptics.
[53:26.520 --> 53:28.520]  It actually shows the satellite photos
[53:28.520 --> 53:30.520]  in real numbers. The real and convenient truth
[53:30.520 --> 53:32.520]  is that Arctic sea ice has grown
[53:32.520 --> 53:34.520]  massively since the
[53:34.520 --> 53:36.520]  age of satellites in the 1950s
[53:36.520 --> 53:38.520]  to the biggest and thickest it's ever been.
[53:38.520 --> 53:40.520]  But hey, two men can have
[53:40.520 --> 53:42.520]  a baby, right?
[53:46.520 --> 53:48.520]  I've got
[53:48.520 --> 53:50.520]  three stacks of public schools
[53:50.520 --> 53:52.520]  promoting sex with children publicly now.
[53:52.520 --> 53:54.520]  Told you that was next. Hey,
[53:54.520 --> 53:56.520]  what's wrong with adults screwing kids?
[53:58.520 --> 54:00.520]  It just goes
[54:00.520 --> 54:02.520]  on and on because evil's
[54:02.520 --> 54:04.520]  out of the closet. Evil's took the mask off.
[54:04.520 --> 54:06.520]  This is evil making its
[54:06.520 --> 54:08.520]  move. And what does Satan do?
[54:08.520 --> 54:10.520]  Satan kills, steals,
[54:10.520 --> 54:12.520]  and destroys.
[54:12.520 --> 54:14.520]  Now, I got called last night by Tony
[54:14.520 --> 54:16.520]  Lyons at Skyhorsy. He said
[54:16.520 --> 54:18.520]  we have a very good chance of sending
[54:18.520 --> 54:20.520]  the Great Reset on Amazon to number
[54:20.520 --> 54:22.520]  one. And if that happens, it'll make the book
[54:22.520 --> 54:24.520]  20 times bigger. It's a great book. It's the
[54:24.520 --> 54:26.520]  blueprint of the New World Order and how to stop them. The Great
[54:26.520 --> 54:28.520]  Reset and the War for the World. And that would be
[54:28.520 --> 54:30.520]  a major funding boon for us. So it's like
[54:30.520 --> 54:32.520]  hitting the lottery. If it goes to number
[54:32.520 --> 54:34.520]  one, no matter what they do, it just
[54:34.520 --> 54:36.520]  magnifies. It's been as high as
[54:36.520 --> 54:38.520]  number six. It's number nine today.
[54:38.520 --> 54:40.520]  It's number one in more than 50
[54:40.520 --> 54:42.520]  charts in the United States and the world
[54:42.520 --> 54:44.520]  right now. The Great Reset and the War for

[54:46.520 --> 54:48.520]  Kindle. Everything the book is now shipping
[54:48.520 --> 54:50.520]  as well. But I want you to get it at

[54:52.520 --> 54:54.520]  for friends and family. We can send it
[54:54.520 --> 54:56.520]  to number one today and
[54:56.520 --> 54:58.520]  now is the time to do it. And you
[54:58.520 --> 55:00.520]  got to go look at the reviews that are
[55:00.520 --> 55:02.520]  pouring in. Currently today
[55:02.520 --> 55:04.520]  it was number nine earlier. It's number 16
[55:04.520 --> 55:06.520]  right now.
[55:06.520 --> 55:08.520]  But you look at it where it's number
[55:08.520 --> 55:10.520]  one in bestsellers and political corruption
[55:10.520 --> 55:12.520]  and misconduct.
[55:12.520 --> 55:14.520]  And the Kindles number three.
[55:14.520 --> 55:16.520]  That's
[55:16.520 --> 55:18.520]  beating free books being put up by
[55:18.520 --> 55:20.520]  Obama. Bestsellers in globalization.
[55:20.520 --> 55:22.520]  Number one and number three.
[55:22.520 --> 55:24.520]  Bestsellers
[55:24.520 --> 55:26.520]  in United States history.
[55:26.520 --> 55:28.520]  Number one.
[55:28.520 --> 55:30.520]  Kindle.
[55:30.520 --> 55:32.520]  Number six.
[55:34.520 --> 55:36.520]  And it goes on and on. You got to go
[55:36.520 --> 55:38.520]  read
[55:38.520 --> 55:40.520]  the reviews. Number one in
[55:40.520 --> 55:42.520]  history.
[55:42.520 --> 55:44.520]  Think they like that? That's a major
[55:44.520 --> 55:46.520]  thing for them.
[55:46.520 --> 55:48.520]  Number one
[55:48.520 --> 55:50.520]  in bestsellers
[55:50.520 --> 55:52.520]  and media studies. Think they like that?
[55:52.520 --> 55:54.520]  Bestsellers
[55:54.520 --> 55:56.520]  in corruption and misconduct. Number one.
[55:56.520 --> 55:58.520]  Bestsellers
[55:58.520 --> 56:00.520]  in world history. Number one.
[56:00.520 --> 56:02.520]  And read the reviews.
[56:02.520 --> 56:04.520]  People are blown away.
[56:04.520 --> 56:06.520]  Five stars out the rear end.
[56:06.520 --> 56:08.520]  Thank you everybody
[56:08.520 --> 56:10.520]  for what you're doing. We're in this fight together.
[56:10.520 --> 56:12.520]  And this is a message that humanity
[56:12.520 --> 56:14.520]  is the blueprint of the Death Star.
[56:14.520 --> 56:16.520]  Humanity wants to take on the New World Order.
[56:16.520 --> 56:18.520]  Alex Jones is right
[56:18.520 --> 56:20.520]  about far more than he's wrong about.
[56:20.520 --> 56:22.520]  He's the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[56:22.520 --> 56:24.520]  Joe Rogan.
[56:24.520 --> 56:26.520]  Then the quotes from Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson
[56:26.520 --> 56:28.520]  and others.
[56:28.520 --> 56:30.520]  If Alex Jones is just a crackpot,
[56:30.520 --> 56:32.520]  why are the most powerful people
[56:32.520 --> 56:34.520]  in the country trying to silence him?
[56:34.520 --> 56:36.520]  No one
[56:36.520 --> 56:38.520]  bothers the censor of the Flat Earthers.
[56:38.520 --> 56:40.520]  Maybe Alex Jones is onto something. Read this book
[56:40.520 --> 56:42.520]  and drive yourself who's crazy.

[59:12.520 --> 59:14.520]  or heating up the herbs

[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:34.520]  accused of having sex with students
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:36.520]  it just goes on and on
[1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:38.520]  and on and then I got
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:40.520]  this giant stack of nose
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:44.520]  over 20 states file legal brief

[1:03:56.520 --> 1:03:58.520]  the tyranny is ongoing and they admit the shot
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:00.520]  doesn't work and it hurts you
[1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:02.520]  it needs to stop now

[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:18.520]  of the world and a huge
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:20.520]  new study that Joe Rogan sent me this morning

[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:36.520]  they're not going to stop you
[1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:38.520]  and I cannot explain to you how big it will be

[1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:30.520]  Thursday
[1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:34.520]  and it is a tremendous success
[1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:36.520]  story that
[1:06:36.520 --> 1:06:38.520]  we're able to have a top selling
[1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:40.520]  book on Amazon
[1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:42.520]  and quite frankly on our website
[1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:44.520]  it's done well as well
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:46.520]  those numbers don't go to Amazon
[1:06:46.520 --> 1:06:48.520]  but that's a tremendous success story
[1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:50.520]  in the face of censorship
[1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:52.520]  but that doesn't
[1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:54.520]  take away from the issue
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:56.520]  of big tech
[1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:58.520]  colluding with the democrat party
[1:06:58.520 --> 1:07:00.520]  to censor their opposition
[1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:02.520]  and we have another
[1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:04.520]  instance of this
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:06.520]  with the
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:08.520]  popular website used to be one of the top
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:10.520]  news websites on the internet
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:12.520]  and that's WND.com
[1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:14.520]  you've probably been there a lot
[1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:16.520]  read a lot of their stories over the years
[1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:18.520]  and we're being joined now
[1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:20.520]  by their managing editor David
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:22.520]  Coop Leon
[1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:24.520]  and he's an award winning journalist
[1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:26.520]  long time managing editor of WND.com
[1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:28.520]  the best selling author
[1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:30.520]  of the marketing of evil
[1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:32.520]  and so much more
[1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:34.520]  and so David
[1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:36.520]  you guys have been enduring the big tech
[1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:38.520]  censorship for a while
[1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:40.520]  talk about that but first
[1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:42.520]  what was the most recent instance
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:44.520]  that you guys were enduring
[1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:46.520]  that is quite frankly a little
[1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:48.520]  shocking and disturbing what we saw
[1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:50.520]  in WND
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:52.520]  yeah thanks Owen it is
[1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:54.520]  it is pretty shocking because
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:56.520]  everybody in the conservative space
[1:07:56.520 --> 1:07:58.520]  is used to getting
[1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:00.520]  taken down suppressed
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:02.520]  demeaned, defamed
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:04.520]  deplatformed
[1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:06.520]  by big tech as we
[1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:08.520]  WND has going back to 2014
[1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:10.520]  before
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:12.520]  most other conservative sites got it
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:14.520]  and we were demonetized
[1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:16.520]  by them last year
[1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:18.520]  you know the advertising
[1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:20.520]  based business model that most
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:22.520]  online news sites work from
[1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:24.520]  has been destroyed by that
[1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:26.520]  but what happened recently
[1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:28.520]  we're almost two weeks now
[1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:30.520]  where Google suddenly decided
[1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:32.520]  to basically blacklist
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:34.520]  WND
[1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:36.520]  and so what happens is if you go to Google
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:38.520]  and you put in WND
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:40.520]  or WND.com
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:42.520]  or really any
[1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:44.520]  writer or headline
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:46.520]  WND you get taken
[1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:48.520]  to a page that says
[1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:50.520]  I'll read it to you it says
[1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:52.520]  WARNING visiting this website
[1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:54.520]  may harm your computer
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:56.520]  exclamation point
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:08:58.520]  ok so
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:00.520]  what's that all about
[1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:02.520]  so we find out
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:04.520]  that there was temporarily
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:06.520]  like two weeks ago
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:08.520]  a new ad that came onto the site
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:10.520]  that apparently had a piece
[1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:12.520]  of malware
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:14.520]  which was immediately taken off
[1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:16.520]  like two weeks ago
[1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:18.520]  this ad was taken off
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:20.520]  of our site ok and yet here we are
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:22.520]  almost two weeks later
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:24.520]  and anybody in the world who goes
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:26.520]  to
[1:09:26.520 --> 1:09:28.520]  worldnetdaily.com
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:30.520]  wnd.com they get this warning
[1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:32.520]  and now here's the irony Owen
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:34.520]  if you click through
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:36.520]  on that one that thing that says
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:38.520]  warning there's a couple paragraphs
[1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:40.520]  to say you know turn back
[1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:42.520]  this is like you know a nuclear explosion
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:44.520]  on your computer if you do this
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:46.520]  it says if you want to see
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:48.520]  I'm paraphrasing you want to see
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:50.520]  what we found on this website
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:52.520]  yeah there it is safe
[1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:54.520]  browsing diagnostic page
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:56.520]  you click on that and you know what you get
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:09:58.520]  you get something that says
[1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:00.520]  quote no unsafe content
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:02.520]  found it's been like
[1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:04.520]  that night and day for two weeks
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:06.520]  no unsafe content found
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:08.520]  and yet they're effectively
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:10.520]  back listing a WND
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:12.520]  and then here's the word
[1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:14.520]  even for me the worst part
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:16.520]  is that the lifeblood of
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:18.520]  a big news site is your email list
[1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:20.520]  we have hundreds of thousands of people
[1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:22.520]  we've been around more than 25 years
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:24.520]  a big email list
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:26.520]  people that are have subscribed
[1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:28.520]  to our email list ok
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:30.520]  they are emailing us night and day
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:32.520]  and saying your emails
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:34.520]  are going to my spam folder
[1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:36.520]  it doesn't matter how many times I
[1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:38.520]  know how you can go in and designate
[1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:40.520]  this is not spam I want this to come to my inbox
[1:10:40.520 --> 1:10:42.520]  ok they do that no matter how many
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:44.520]  times it still goes
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:46.520]  to their spam folder some of them are even
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:48.520]  telling us when you
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:50.520]  click on the links
[1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:52.520]  you know news sites they promote
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:54.520]  their latest breaking news there's links in there
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:56.520]  you click on the link and the link is dead
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:10:58.520]  you can't click through to the
[1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:00.520]  story because don't you know
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:02.520]  it's dangerous so I think
[1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:04.520]  on what's been happening
[1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:06.520]  is that the email providers
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:08.520]  are taking their cue
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:10.520]  from Google they're following Google's lead
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:12.520]  Google is saying this is an unsafe site
[1:11:12.520 --> 1:11:14.520]  and so the email providers
[1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:16.520]  I guess understandably from their point of view
[1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:18.520]  are saying this is an unsafe site
[1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:20.520]  we're not going to deliver the emails
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:22.520]  to the intended recipients
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:24.520]  so it's all a crock
[1:11:24.520 --> 1:11:26.520]  and even again
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:28.520]  by their own diagnostics
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:30.520]  Google says there's nothing here
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:32.520]  this is all political
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:34.520]  because
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:36.520]  because we're conservative and Christian
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:38.520]  and love America
[1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:40.520]  and don't believe men can become women
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:42.520]  etc etc and that's
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:44.520]  really what boils down to
[1:11:44.520 --> 1:11:46.520]  and whether they realize this or not
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:48.520]  my guess is that they do
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:50.520]  most
[1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:52.520]  people who browse through the internet
[1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:54.520]  just they're ignorant they don't know what's going on
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:56.520]  and so let's say they find
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:58.520]  a story that peaks their interest somewhere
[1:11:58.520 --> 1:12:00.520]  on the internet they click it and then this
[1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:02.520]  warning pops up well they're
[1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:04.520]  going to exit out they're going to see this
[1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:06.520]  and they're going to think well okay I don't want to harm
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:08.520]  my computer maybe this is a virus
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:10.520]  maybe this is malware maybe this is
[1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:12.520]  some fake site or something so they just click out
[1:12:12.520 --> 1:12:14.520]  and so this is another way
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:16.520]  of
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:18.520]  censoring the truth
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:20.520]  by having unknowing
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:22.520]  indifferent ignorant people
[1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:24.520]  oh look this is an interesting story about
[1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:26.520]  the COVID vaccine or this is an interesting
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:28.520]  story about the
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:30.520]  oh I'm going to click WND.com boom they click it
[1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:32.520]  and then this warning pops up oh no
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.520]  I don't want to do that
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:36.520]  and so this is what they do
[1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:38.520]  for people that don't know any better
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:40.520]  now people
[1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:42.520]  have been following WorldNet Daily WND.com
[1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:44.520]  for a long time they know better they say oh I know
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:46.520]  this isn't malware I know this isn't a virus
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:48.520]  site I'll find a way to get through this
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:50.520]  block that Google has put on you
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:52.520]  but how long
[1:12:52.520 --> 1:12:54.520]  how long has WorldNet Daily been
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:56.520]  online
[1:12:56.520 --> 1:12:58.520]  longer than Google
[1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:00.520]  we were founded in
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:02.520]  1997 so we're in our
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:04.520]  26th year
[1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:06.520]  we've all seen the photos of Google
[1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:08.520]  how it started in the garage of
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:10.520]  Sergey Brin and the other guy
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:12.520]  and so forth and grew from there
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:14.520]  we were around first
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:16.520]  and honestly since you asked me that
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:18.520]  oh and
[1:13:18.520 --> 1:13:20.520]  back then the internet was like
[1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:22.520]  it was like the Wild West
[1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:24.520]  you know
[1:13:24.520 --> 1:13:26.520]  not a lot of rules
[1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:28.520]  lots of dangers and stuff
[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:30.520]  man you could go out
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:32.520]  and homestead
[1:13:32.520 --> 1:13:34.520]  something and really do something
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:36.520]  out there and that's there we go
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:38.520]  there's the Google
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:40.520]  in its initial humble phase
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:42.520]  before it became evil
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:44.520]  so yeah this is
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:46.520]  the internet is like the opposite now
[1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:48.520]  of what it was then it was
[1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:50.520]  wide open spaces you can do great things
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:52.520]  if you've got the energy and the initiative
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:54.520]  and the vision
[1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:56.520]  which you know Joseph Farrow
[1:13:56.520 --> 1:13:58.520]  was the founder of WND
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:00.520]  way back in 1997
[1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:02.520]  and a lot of people said this is a fad
[1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:04.520]  you know it's slow
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:06.520]  and this is going to go away
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:08.520]  but they said that about television too
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:10.520]  and now of course it's the entire
[1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:12.520]  gateway to information
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:14.520]  in the world and the primary gatekeeper
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:16.520]  of that information
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:18.520]  is Google
[1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:20.520]  Google decides what you can see
[1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:22.520]  and so what's really
[1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:24.520]  strange is like
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:26.520]  I don't know if Google ever
[1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:28.520]  actually can de-platform
[1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:30.520]  somebody because they're a search engine
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:32.520]  as opposed to like Twitter I know Info Wars
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:34.520]  has been de-platformed by all these different
[1:14:34.520 --> 1:14:36.520]  sites and platforms
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:38.520]  but
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:40.520]  they're coming as close as they can
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:42.520]  to de-platforming us
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:44.520]  by blacklisting us in this way
[1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:46.520]  because honestly
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:48.520]  all of us I have have turned away
[1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:50.520]  and I go to some site I've never heard of
[1:14:50.520 --> 1:14:52.520]  just like you said Owen and say
[1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:54.520]  okay this is a dangerous site
[1:14:54.520 --> 1:14:56.520]  there's something weird here
[1:14:56.520 --> 1:14:58.520]  I don't want to screw up my computer
[1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:00.520]  so I turn back
[1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:02.520]  it's understandable
[1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:04.520]  and so we're blessed that we have
[1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:06.520]  a large following that's been there
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:08.520]  for a very long time
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:10.520]  who say no this is BS
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:12.520]  and this is WND
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:14.520]  I've gone here every day for years
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:16.520]  so they see through it
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:18.520]  and things are still done and as I say
[1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:20.520]  arguably
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:22.520]  as bad or worse as what they're doing
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:24.520]  to the
[1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:26.520]  email because they're
[1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:28.520]  poisoning our email
[1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:30.520]  people are not
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:32.520]  email is how you promote your stories
[1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:34.520]  it's how you sell things
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:36.520]  it's how you raise donations
[1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:38.520]  it's really your life blood
[1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:40.520]  it's how you reach the people
[1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:42.520]  it's how you reach the people
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:44.520]  and it's
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:46.520]  I couldn't survive without it
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:48.520]  and folks look
[1:15:48.520 --> 1:15:50.520]  I don't say these things lightly like the Democrats
[1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:52.520]  I don't want to see violence but I mean
[1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:54.520]  sabotaging communications
[1:15:54.520 --> 1:16:16.520]  is an act of war

[1:20:30.520 --> 1:20:32.520]  with google is
[1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:34.520]  if it's a site that they don't want you to go to
[1:20:34.520 --> 1:20:36.520]  they just put a warning label up
[1:20:36.520 --> 1:20:38.520]  we're talking
[1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:40.520]  to world net dailies
[1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:42.520]  david coupellian
[1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:44.520]  right now on this story
[1:20:44.520 --> 1:20:46.520]  and it's just shocking
[1:20:46.520 --> 1:20:48.520]  because i've seen this everywhere
[1:20:48.520 --> 1:20:50.520]  they have new waves of censorship
[1:20:50.520 --> 1:20:52.520]  they're going to erase you

[1:20:56.520 --> 1:20:58.520]  and facebook they're going to find a way
[1:20:58.520 --> 1:21:00.520]  they're going to shut down your email chain
[1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:02.520]  they're going to put up warnings on all the browsers
[1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:04.520]  and tech that they control
[1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:06.520]  so people don't go to your website
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:08.520]  it's really amazing stuff
[1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:10.520]  and
[1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:12.520]  matt drudge said it right david
[1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:14.520]  he said they want us all in internet
[1:21:14.520 --> 1:21:16.520]  ghettos
[1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:18.520]  and i always think about this
[1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:20.520]  i want people to fully comprehend
[1:21:20.520 --> 1:21:22.520]  and i think i'm really starting to understand
[1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:24.520]  what matt drudge meant
[1:21:24.520 --> 1:21:26.520]  and it's like this
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:28.520]  when info wars was allowed
[1:21:28.520 --> 1:21:30.520]  on youtube and facebook and twitter
[1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:32.520]  but let's just say youtube
[1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:34.520]  if this show went live on youtube right now
[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:36.520]  100,000 tuned in immediately
[1:21:36.520 --> 1:21:38.520]  just right out of the game
[1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:40.520]  it would be 100,000
[1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:42.520]  but for some reason
[1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:44.520]  we can't recreate
[1:21:44.520 --> 1:21:46.520]  that number anywhere else
[1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:48.520]  so people only want to go
[1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:50.520]  into the ghetto
[1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:52.520]  they're used to being in the ghetto
[1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:54.520]  they live in the ghetto
[1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:56.520]  and so that's the problem david
[1:21:56.520 --> 1:21:58.520]  i'm sure once you guys got hit
[1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:00.520]  with the censorship at world net daily
[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:02.520]  i'm guessing it affected your bottom line
[1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:04.520]  how did that affect your traffic
[1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:06.520]  how did that affect your bottom line
[1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:08.520]  when it came to finances and advertising
[1:22:08.520 --> 1:22:10.520]  well
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:12.520]  it's a little early to say
[1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:14.520]  but i can say that donations
[1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:16.520]  dropped
[1:22:16.520 --> 1:22:18.520]  i write a lot of the donation
[1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:20.520]  pitches they're not just sort of can donations
[1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:22.520]  they're very very
[1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:24.520]  prayerful from the heart donation
[1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:26.520]  pitches to people that have read us
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:28.520]  and relied on us for a long time
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:30.520]  and it's a good barometer
[1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:32.520]  of what the support level is
[1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:34.520]  that dropped way down
[1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:36.520]  and that has to be because
[1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:38.520]  simultaneously we're hearing from people
[1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:40.520]  saying hey your emails
[1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:42.520]  are going to my spam folder
[1:22:42.520 --> 1:22:44.520]  you know i don't check
[1:22:44.520 --> 1:22:46.520]  my spam folder
[1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:48.520]  i get literally thousands of emails
[1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:50.520]  every single day
[1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:52.520]  i don't check my spam folder
[1:22:52.520 --> 1:22:54.520]  every day and that means a lot of people
[1:22:54.520 --> 1:22:56.520]  don't so they're just missing it
[1:22:56.520 --> 1:22:58.520]  the people that say hey that's going to my spam folder
[1:22:58.520 --> 1:23:00.520]  okay they're seeing it and they're emailing us
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:02.520]  but for every one that that's happening
[1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:04.520]  too there are many where they're just missing it
[1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:06.520]  so that's one measure
[1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:08.520]  of it
[1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:10.520]  traffic is down we got something like
[1:23:10.520 --> 1:23:12.520]  Joseph Farah said he's one
[1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:14.520]  one analytics said it was down
[1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:16.520]  like 10% okay 10%
[1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:18.520]  is huge okay when you're
[1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:20.520]  operating on margins
[1:23:20.520 --> 1:23:22.520]  you know W&D
[1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:24.520]  used to pull down a lot of
[1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:26.520]  money per year in gross revenue
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:28.520]  back when the internet
[1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:30.520]  was free and i remember
[1:23:30.520 --> 1:23:32.520]  i remember you know
[1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:34.520]  six figure advertising contracts
[1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:36.520]  for a single advertiser for a year
[1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:38.520]  and a lot of those so
[1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:40.520]  that is what supported us and we had over
[1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:42.520]  50 employees
[1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:44.520]  and it was really going then and big tech
[1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:46.520]  came and destroyed
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:48.520]  the whole advertising based business
[1:23:48.520 --> 1:23:50.520]  model not just for us but for everybody
[1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:52.520]  that's why you have to support yourself
[1:23:52.520 --> 1:23:54.520]  with products with
[1:23:54.520 --> 1:23:56.520]  an ad free option you know
[1:23:56.520 --> 1:23:58.520]  the insider basically
[1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:00.520]  readers have to support you
[1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:02.520]  that is the new model for
[1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.520]  pretty much everybody in our space
[1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:06.520]  whichever ghetto we happen to
[1:24:06.520 --> 1:24:08.520]  be in but
[1:24:08.520 --> 1:24:10.520]  you know and the thing is
[1:24:10.520 --> 1:24:12.520]  if you want to like drill down
[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:14.520]  like why are they doing this
[1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:16.520]  in our case we don't have to
[1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:18.520]  guess because they told us
[1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:20.520]  when they demonetized us they told us
[1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:22.520]  two things one i already mentioned
[1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:24.520]  about they said they'll read it to you say
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:26.520]  they google
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:28.520]  does not allow content that
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:30.520]  incites hatred against
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:32.520]  as usual you know veterans
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:34.520]  you know religions
[1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:36.520]  old age
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:38.520]  disability as though anybody in the world
[1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:40.520]  criticizes people because
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:42.520]  they're old or disabled and then they
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:44.520]  get to the real thing oh on the basis
[1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:46.520]  of sexual orientation gender
[1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:48.520]  gender identity oh that's it
[1:24:48.520 --> 1:24:50.520]  okay so if we
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:52.520]  object to like you know
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:54.520]  castrating and doing mastectomies on
[1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:56.520]  children which sounds like
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:24:58.520]  something out of Hitler Germany
[1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:00.520]  then we are that's hatred
[1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:02.520]  okay and the other thing
[1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:04.520]  is that they said
[1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:06.520]  google does not allow content
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:08.520]  that promotes harmful health claims
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:10.520]  or
[1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:12.520]  or relates to a
[1:25:12.520 --> 1:25:14.520]  current major health crisis
[1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:16.520]  i wonder what that could be and
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:18.520]  contradicts authoritative scientific
[1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:20.520]  consensus like Anthony Fauci
[1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:22.520]  authoritative yes respect my
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:24.520]  authority
[1:25:24.520 --> 1:25:26.520]  right so we for
[1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:28.520]  ever since the
[1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:30.520]  beginning of really of the
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:32.520]  pandemic two and a half years ago
[1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:34.520]  WND has been a strong
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:36.520]  suit for us we have
[1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:38.520]  repeatedly you know interviewed all the
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:40.520]  the you know
[1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:42.520]  Dr. McCullis and Malone's
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:44.520]  and Solanko's and all the
[1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:46.520]  rest of it and we
[1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:48.520]  we've really been on the edge
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:50.520]  of promoting
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:52.520]  the you know off label
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:54.520]  uses of yes ivermectin hydroxy
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:56.520]  chloroquine all that from by the way
[1:25:56.520 --> 1:25:58.520]  they just came out the CDC now admits
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:00.520]  that ivermectin is good for
[1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:02.520]  covid they just published that
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:04.520]  yes yeah after a whole lot of people
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:06.520]  died from not having it
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:08.520]  because it's a cheap you know effective
[1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:10.520]  already safe and effective
[1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:12.520]  according to the FDA drugs so therefore
[1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:14.520]  we can't use it
[1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:16.520]  and the same thing with the
[1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:18.520]  with the vaccines we
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:20.520]  publicized the fact that the CDC
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:22.520]  redefined
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:24.520]  the word vaccine
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:26.520]  to make it fit with the MRNA
[1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:28.520]  the other you know whatever you want to call
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:30.520]  you showed the two definitions you
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:32.520]  showed the before definition and the
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:34.520]  post definition
[1:26:34.520 --> 1:26:36.520]  and of course they say we redefined
[1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:38.520]  it in order to provide greater transparency
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:40.520]  can you believe it
[1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:42.520]  they're covering
[1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:44.520]  their greater transparency we're
[1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:46.520]  changing the we're changing the language
[1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:48.520]  for greater transparency and then
[1:26:48.520 --> 1:26:50.520]  and then that's what they do they build up
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:52.520]  these protected social groups
[1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:54.520]  they prop up and build up these protected
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:56.520]  social groups you know say
[1:26:56.520 --> 1:26:58.520]  it's gay people or trans people and then
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:00.520]  oh you can't say
[1:27:00.520 --> 1:27:02.520]  anything about them or they ban
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:04.520]  you that's what Google is telling you now
[1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:06.520]  that's exactly right
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:08.520]  that's really where it comes down to
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:10.520]  what's what's news right now
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:12.520]  is what they don't want
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:14.520]  what's in other words what's really truthful
[1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:16.520]  having to do with
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:18.520]  you know Joe Biden and his
[1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:20.520]  agenda and Biden is a puppet
[1:27:20.520 --> 1:27:22.520]  the people behind him
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:24.520]  having to do with with COVID
[1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:26.520]  having to do with immigration
[1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:28.520]  having to do with this whole
[1:27:28.520 --> 1:27:30.520]  transgender craze and with these
[1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:32.520]  social media driven
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:34.520]  mass hysteria where you have
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:36.520]  these you know you have
[1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:38.520]  just to give you an example the
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:40.520]  mass hysteria there is a whole thing
[1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:42.520]  where tons of teenage girls
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:44.520]  have developed what appears to be
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:46.520]  Tourette syndrome just
[1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:48.520]  from watching people with Tourette
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:50.520]  syndrome on tiktok ok it's
[1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:52.520]  just a
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:54.520]  you can read about it it's a psychological
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:27:56.520]  spiritual phenomenon where if you are
[1:27:56.520 --> 1:27:58.520]  insecure and you are
[1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:00.520]  in an emotional state
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:02.520]  you can actually draw in
[1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:04.520]  these attributes you know little children become
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:06.520]  like their parents this is not some
[1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:08.520]  some you know I've never
[1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:10.520]  heard about that that is
[1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:12.520]  that is literally straight out of South Park
[1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:14.520]  episode I feel every day I'm in South Park
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:16.520]  episode right but that
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:18.520]  that one has been well documented
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:20.520]  and written up in peer-reviewed medical
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:22.520]  journal as a real phenomenon
[1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:24.520]  so therefore the same thing there you go
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:26.520]  so somebody's quick one to
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:28.520]  trigger there that's good the same
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:30.520]  thing with this whole this trans
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:32.520]  thing you have these because
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:34.520]  of social media and you have
[1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:36.520]  you know you have
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:38.520]  all these people on social media and as
[1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:40.520]  our friend Tucker Carlson said recently
[1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:42.520]  you know having a
[1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:44.520]  purple-haired loser with a nose ring
[1:28:44.520 --> 1:28:46.520]  tell your six-year-old to get a sex change
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:48.520]  is not why exactly and they're influencing

[1:32:54.520 --> 1:33:20.520]  at infowarstore.com
[1:33:20.520 --> 1:33:26.520]  one more segment here with David Cappelli and the managing editor at worldnetdaily.com
[1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:28.520]  and I'm telling you it's the oddest thing
[1:33:28.520 --> 1:33:30.520]  you could have 100,000 people
[1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:32.520]  tuned in to info wars on YouTube
[1:33:32.520 --> 1:33:34.520]  excited oh it's info wars it's Alex Jones
[1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:36.520]  and then the screen would go blank
[1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:38.520]  and they say what happened
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:40.520]  well they got banned off of YouTube
[1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:42.520]  but you can go to banned out video and watch the same thing
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:44.520]  well I don't want to go to banned out video though
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:46.520]  so it's like the same thing it's like if they don't see
[1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:48.520]  worldnetdaily on Facebook or Twitter
[1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:50.520]  or YouTube or Google
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:52.520]  then people just don't go there
[1:33:52.520 --> 1:33:54.520]  I don't understand the psychology but that's what it is
[1:33:54.520 --> 1:33:56.520]  it's something about the mainstream
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:33:58.520]  there's something about
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:00.520]  it's the same psychology of why people like
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:02.520]  watching live TV
[1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:04.520]  like you feel like you're part of the group
[1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:06.520]  you feel like you're in the in crowd
[1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:08.520]  and so it's the same thing with these internet ghettos
[1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:10.520]  Matt Drudge really had the foresight there
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:12.520]  but
[1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:14.520]  there's all other kinds of things going on
[1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:16.520]  we've got Biden about to give his speech tonight
[1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:18.520]  you know his last
[1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:20.520]  soul of the nation speech is what he calls it
[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:22.520]  he called for unity
[1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:24.520]  he said we need to not treat each other like enemies
[1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:26.520]  well now
[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:28.520]  all the rhetoric building up to his new
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:30.520]  soul of the nation address
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:32.520]  that he's going to be giving soon
[1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:34.520]  has been divisive
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:36.520]  hate filled rhetoric
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:38.520]  accusing anybody that's not a democrat
[1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:40.520]  of basically being a terrorist
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:42.520]  what do you expect
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:44.520]  from Joe Biden in his
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:46.520]  soul of the nation speech
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:48.520]  do you think he's going to be more divisive
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:50.520]  perhaps the most divisive speech in American history
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:52.520]  or do you think he's going to go back to
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:54.520]  the unifying message that we all know is BS
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:34:58.520]  he'll probably try to do both
[1:34:58.520 --> 1:35:00.520]  he'll probably try to
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:02.520]  touch on the unifying thing
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:04.520]  but oh and let me
[1:35:04.520 --> 1:35:06.520]  you're hitting a hot wire here with me
[1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:08.520]  here let me just say something about this
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:10.520]  this whole business of
[1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:12.520]  you know
[1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:14.520]  fascist or semi-fascist
[1:35:14.520 --> 1:35:16.520]  and Nazis
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:18.520]  the whole
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:20.520]  people you know they were flummoxed
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:22.520]  we see that parents go to school board
[1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:24.520]  meetings and they stand up and say
[1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:26.520]  stop indoctrinating my children
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:28.520]  with communist propaganda
[1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:30.520]  and then the DOJ
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:32.520]  brands them as a
[1:35:32.520 --> 1:35:34.520]  domestic terrorist and
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:36.520]  violent extremist we keep
[1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:38.520]  seeing this kind of stuff
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:40.520]  if you are
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:42.520]  to oppose them in any way you are
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:44.520]  a white supremacist
[1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:46.520]  America is the least racist
[1:35:46.520 --> 1:35:48.520]  nation in case anybody didn't know
[1:35:48.520 --> 1:35:50.520]  in the history of the world
[1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:52.520]  it is the most successful
[1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:54.520]  multi-ethnic nation ever
[1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:56.520]  this is the least racist nation but somehow
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:58.520]  all of us are white supremacist
[1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:00.520]  terrorists and so forth
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:02.520]  and I contend
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:04.520]  that they have been speaking to us
[1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:06.520]  in code really
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:08.520]  until recently just recently
[1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:10.520]  they started talking all about
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:12.520]  like Christian nationalists
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:14.520]  white Christian nationalists
[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:16.520]  always has this little
[1:36:16.520 --> 1:36:18.520]  little nasty sort of
[1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:20.520]  racist sounding words
[1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:22.520]  and so forth okay but basically
[1:36:24.520 --> 1:36:26.520]  what they are really opposed to
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:28.520]  is Christianity
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:30.520]  they are opposed to Christian
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:32.520]  the great
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:34.520]  center right American
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:36.520]  middle class that is Christian
[1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:38.520]  that is
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:40.520]  that believes in the Constitution
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:42.520]  that believes in the
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:44.520]  Judeo-Christian morals
[1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:46.520]  that this country or culture was
[1:36:46.520 --> 1:36:48.520]  based on
[1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:50.520]  that is the engine of America
[1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:52.520]  you know culturally and financially
[1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:54.520]  and economically
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:56.520]  the center right middle class
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:36:58.520]  that is what they are at war with and that is
[1:36:58.520 --> 1:37:00.520]  essentially what we call
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:02.520]  Judeo-Christian, Judeo-Old Testament
[1:37:02.520 --> 1:37:04.520]  Christian New Testament basically
[1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:06.520]  biblical values the 10 commandments
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:08.520]  the Sermon on the Mount
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:10.520]  the values that made America great
[1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:12.520]  that made you know I've been a journalist
[1:37:12.520 --> 1:37:14.520]  for 40 years now I started
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:16.520]  during the Reagan term
[1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:18.520]  and it was morning in America
[1:37:18.520 --> 1:37:20.520]  and basically this was not a theocracy
[1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:22.520]  it was just a basically
[1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:24.520]  Judeo-Christian
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:26.520]  freedom loving
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:28.520]  country okay and
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:30.520]  they hate that because the truth is
[1:37:30.520 --> 1:37:32.520]  the people that run
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:34.520]  Google and the rest
[1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:36.520]  of you talk about the New World Order
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:38.520]  and the World Economic Forum
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:40.520]  and the Biden administration all these people
[1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:42.520]  they are loyal to something else
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:44.520]  that most of us most of people listening right now
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:46.520]  they may have an idea
[1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:48.520]  because they're paying attention they know what it is
[1:37:48.520 --> 1:37:50.520]  but they can't really
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:52.520]  feel the way these
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:54.520]  people feel you're talking about a class of
[1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:56.520]  sociopaths people who
[1:37:56.520 --> 1:37:58.520]  can
[1:37:58.520 --> 1:38:00.520]  who can look right into a camera
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:02.520]  meaning looking into the eyes of millions of people
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:04.520]  or the television camera and lie
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:06.520]  without any conflict okay these
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:08.520]  are people that could you know pass the polygraph
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:10.520]  test they don't have any inner conflict
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:12.520]  any conscience over overlying
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:14.520]  we don't
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:16.520]  you and I and people listening don't have
[1:38:16.520 --> 1:38:18.520]  feelings like this we might know
[1:38:18.520 --> 1:38:20.520]  what it is to be angry or upset
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:22.520]  or greedy or whatever we don't know
[1:38:22.520 --> 1:38:24.520]  what it is to
[1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:26.520]  dream of controlling entire populations
[1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:28.520]  of people those thoughts at our very
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:30.520]  worst never occur to us okay
[1:38:30.520 --> 1:38:32.520]  so we're dealing with some very
[1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:34.520]  dark hearted
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:36.520]  souls going on here and that's
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:38.520]  really
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:40.520]  this world has always been a battleground
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:42.520]  between good and evil okay and it
[1:38:42.520 --> 1:38:44.520]  goes on in our minds
[1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:46.520]  and it projects out into the world
[1:38:46.520 --> 1:38:48.520]  that's what we're caught up in here and there are
[1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:50.520]  a lot of good people out there in America
[1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:52.520]  a lot of really good decent people
[1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:54.520]  that are just as appalled as you
[1:38:54.520 --> 1:38:56.520]  and I are everything they're seeing
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:38:58.520]  but unfortunately the
[1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:00.520]  the oligarchy the people in power right
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:02.520]  now that have the upper hand are the
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:04.520]  ones that I'm describing
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:06.520]  and it really if you boil it all
[1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:08.520]  down it is a war
[1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:10.520]  against God and therefore
[1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:12.520]  against Christianity against God
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:14.520]  and his commandments and his ways
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:16.520]  because that's what this world
[1:39:16.520 --> 1:39:18.520]  has always been about it's been a war between
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:20.520]  good and evil and we're we're in the middle
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:22.520]  of it right now yeah and I mean it feels
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:24.520]  like we're at the peak of it but then
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:26.520]  the calendar turns and then you feel
[1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:28.520]  like you're at the peak of it again
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:30.520]  and we're just
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:32.520]  flying to these midterms now 68 days
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:34.520]  away you know that there's going to be some
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:36.520]  big crazy development in between now and
[1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:38.520]  then that's just how these things go and
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:40.520]  I'm so glad you know getting into the psychology
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:42.520]  of it I try to get into the psychology of
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:44.520]  it a lot because it's important for people
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:46.520]  to understand that aspect of it
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:48.520]  because where you when you understand where it's coming
[1:39:48.520 --> 1:39:50.520]  from at a psychological level
[1:39:50.520 --> 1:39:52.520]  you can recognize what's evil
[1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:54.520]  and what's not now
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:56.520]  some of the psychology we can relate
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:39:58.520]  to a lot of it
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:00.520]  we just have to recognize and observe
[1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:02.520]  but that's it exactly
[1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:04.520]  people I mean myself people get confused
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:06.520]  say why why how can they be
[1:40:06.520 --> 1:40:08.520]  such liars how can they stare us
[1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:10.520]  right in the eye and lie to us
[1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:12.520]  time and time again how can they be such
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:14.520]  thieves how can they be such
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:16.520]  thieves funding all these
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:18.520]  wars across the planet spending trillions
[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:20.520]  of dollars as as
[1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:22.520]  Americans are struggling to make ends meet
[1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:24.520]  how can they be such low life scum
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:26.520]  how can they have such disdain and hatred
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:28.520]  for the American people
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:30.520]  yeah exactly we can't relate to that we don't want
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:32.520]  other people to suffer we don't want to control
[1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:34.520]  other people and that's why I try to get
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:36.520]  mostly young
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:38.520]  people to understand but everybody needs
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:40.520]  to understand the very psychology
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:42.520]  of the American
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:44.520]  left versus the American right the American
[1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:46.520]  left wants to control you they
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:48.520]  believe in human control
[1:40:48.520 --> 1:40:50.520]  and they want to be the control factor
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:52.520]  whereas the American right believes in
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:54.520]  self-control self-government
[1:40:54.520 --> 1:40:56.520]  you're in charge of yourself
[1:40:56.520 --> 1:40:58.520]  live and let live where on the
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:00.520]  left it's no you can't be in control
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:02.520]  yourself therefore I need to be in control
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:04.520]  of yourself and when people understand
[1:41:04.520 --> 1:41:06.520]  that they'll understand
[1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:08.520]  okay now I know why
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:10.520]  the left-wing ideology
[1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:12.520]  has been the most blood drenched
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:14.520]  ideology in world history
[1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:16.520]  and and on one thing
[1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:18.520]  one really great trick they have
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:20.520]  this is why Biden is calling us all
[1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:22.520]  fascists why they call Donald Trump
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:24.520]  worst in Hitler because
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:26.520]  if you or I or your listeners were alive
[1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:28.520]  during Nazi Germany in the
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:30.520]  third Reich and we had opportunity
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:32.520]  to lie, cheat, steal
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:34.520]  rig an election
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:36.520]  in order to get rid of Hitler
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:38.520]  and to save millions of lives
[1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:40.520]  will we do it damn right
[1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:42.520]  it would be immoral not to
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:44.520]  it would be a moral imperative there were
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:46.520]  16 known plots to assassinate
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:48.520]  Hitler they all failed
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:50.520]  and all those people are
[1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:52.520]  considered heroes to this day
[1:41:52.520 --> 1:41:54.520]  so by calling
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:56.520]  not just Trump but
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:41:58.520]  half of his followers are deplorables
[1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:00.520]  all that by calling us terrorists
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:02.520]  and Nazis and Hitler
[1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:04.520]  it somehow
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:06.520]  if you're in Hitler Germany there are no rules
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:08.520]  you know Klaus von Stauffenberg
[1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:10.520]  and all the rest of it
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:12.520]  they were lying they're at war
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:14.520]  war is deception
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:16.520]  they're behind enemy lines of course
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:18.520]  they're lying and cheating and so the left
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:20.520]  loves it where there are no
[1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:22.520]  rules
[1:42:22.520 --> 1:42:24.520]  because they want us dead
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:26.520]  that's why
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:28.520]  they want us dead and they want to justify it
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:30.520]  by calling us Nazis
[1:42:30.520 --> 1:42:32.520]  well you know
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:34.520]  we lost 400,000
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:36.520]  people in World War II to
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:38.520]  stop the Nazis and then we hired
[1:42:38.520 --> 1:42:40.520]  100 of their scientists
[1:42:40.520 --> 1:42:42.520]  David Capelli and thank you so much
[1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:44.520]  for joining us folks you gotta go right to
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:46.520]  WND.com now

[1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:50.520]  you gotta go right to their website now
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:52.520]  because they're getting banned everywhere
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:54.520]  I know I'm gonna make that a habit when I'm looking for my news

[1:42:58.520 --> 1:43:00.520]  People say Alex Jones crazy
[1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:02.520]  he's a conspiracy theory guy he's a nutcase
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:04.520]  he's got these rants and all that
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:06.520]  what they miss
[1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:08.520]  is that this guy's ahead of the curve
[1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:10.520]  there's so many different topics
[1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:12.520]  of signal not noise
[1:43:12.520 --> 1:43:14.520]  if you look at the signal
[1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:16.520]  and you compare that
[1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:18.520]  to PBS and NPR and BBC
[1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:20.520]  and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there
[1:43:20.520 --> 1:43:22.520]  versus what your collective body
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:24.520]  has put out there
[1:43:24.520 --> 1:43:26.520]  and if you're setting a human being and just watching it
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:28.520]  you say well got Alex Jones is ahead of this
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:30.520]  not only that he can have explained it
[1:43:30.520 --> 1:43:32.520]  you are one of the great thinkers of this
[1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:34.520]  that is very rare you gotta go back
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:36.520]  almost to the revolutionary generation
[1:43:36.520 --> 1:43:38.520]  and see that
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:40.520]  in this new book I gotta tell you

[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:50.520]  about fish oil we went out

[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:00.520]  these two supplements sell out quite frequently
[1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:02.520]  but we got both in stock and on sale right now
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:04.520]  but those sales coming to an end
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:06.520]  after this weekend
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:08.520]  so get to InfowarsStore.com
[1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:10.520]  for more information
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:12.520]  I want to address something here
[1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:14.520]  in fact guys did you
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:16.520]  get those tweets that I sent you
[1:49:16.520 --> 1:49:18.520]  to print please
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:20.520]  can you bring those in to me
[1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:22.520]  so
[1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:24.520]  I'm trying to think of the best way
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:26.520]  to handle this
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:28.520]  and really the best way
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:30.520]  is to just do this
[1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:32.520]  and then get into the commentary
[1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:34.520]  and that's to say
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:36.520]  there are
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:38.520]  dozens if not even maybe hundreds
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:40.520]  who watch
[1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:42.520]  this transmission they're tuned in
[1:49:42.520 --> 1:49:44.520]  right now
[1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:46.520]  at Media Matters and other places
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:48.520]  hi guys you watch us every day hello
[1:49:48.520 --> 1:49:50.520]  and their only job is to
[1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:52.520]  tune in here and then
[1:49:52.520 --> 1:49:54.520]  write negative stories about us
[1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:56.520]  and that's all they do
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:49:58.520]  and two of the most recent examples
[1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:00.520]  and Alex played one of them earlier
[1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:02.520]  and that was on the Young Turks
[1:50:02.520 --> 1:50:04.520]  and
[1:50:04.520 --> 1:50:06.520]  they upload
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:08.520]  the segment where they're talking about Alex Jones
[1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:10.520]  because they all watch the show
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:12.520]  Alex Jones tells his audience to use political violence
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:14.520]  and prepare for war but
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:16.520]  and so they're insinuating that Alex Jones calls for violence
[1:50:16.520 --> 1:50:18.520]  and then you play the clip and there's no calls for violence
[1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:20.520]  whatsoever
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:22.520]  it just doesn't even exist
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:24.520]  and so
[1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:26.520]  you also had a new individual
[1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:28.520]  this must be the new one hi hi Ari
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:30.520]  hello it's nice to meet you it looks like you just got a job at Media Matters
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:32.520]  your job is now to watch Infowars
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:34.520]  and write hit pieces on us congratulations sounds like a great life
[1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:36.520]  I'm sure your parents are proud of you
[1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:38.520]  and so she's watching
[1:50:38.520 --> 1:50:40.520]  and she
[1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:42.520]  saw me hosting the other day
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:44.520]  and she says
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:46.520]  if I worked for Alex Jones I'd be
[1:50:46.520 --> 1:50:48.520]  very careful what I tell my audience
[1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.520]  is a false flag but I guess
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:52.520]  Owen Shroyer's built different
[1:50:52.520 --> 1:50:54.520]  yeah Ari I am
[1:50:54.520 --> 1:50:56.520]  built different but that's neither here nor there
[1:50:56.520 --> 1:50:58.520]  now
[1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:00.520]  here's what's funny the story that I'm
[1:51:00.520 --> 1:51:02.520]  covering that she even
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:04.520]  puts in the video
[1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:06.520]  because we put it on the screen we don't just
[1:51:06.520 --> 1:51:08.520]  we don't just make
[1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:10.520]  crap up around here and just give you
[1:51:10.520 --> 1:51:12.520]  false rhetoric around here I mean
[1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:14.520]  there's a reason why there's 100 news stories on the desk
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:16.520]  every day and the crew is in there piling
[1:51:16.520 --> 1:51:18.520]  through news stories and every guest we have
[1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:20.520]  says wow you guys are good you pulled that story up
[1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:22.520]  I just mentioned because the crew is sitting in there
[1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:24.520]  just typing away getting all the
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:26.520]  news stories pulled up putting it all there for documentation
[1:51:26.520 --> 1:51:28.520]  so we document
[1:51:28.520 --> 1:51:30.520]  I would say 90%
[1:51:30.520 --> 1:51:32.520]  of the stuff that we cover here
[1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:34.520]  with
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:36.520]  the documents the stories what have you
[1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:38.520]  the videos 90% of what we cover
[1:51:38.520 --> 1:51:40.520]  is fully completely documented
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:42.520]  now it's a talk show
[1:51:42.520 --> 1:51:44.520]  that's teleprompter free so it's impossible to
[1:51:44.520 --> 1:51:46.520]  document everything because I'm flying off
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:48.520]  the cuff here but folks
[1:51:48.520 --> 1:51:50.520]  so
[1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:52.520]  she insinuates she says oh
[1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:54.520]  Owen Shroyer is saying that this is a false flag
[1:51:54.520 --> 1:51:56.520]  the story
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:58.520]  I'm reading
[1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:00.520]  that she's covering the headline
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:02.520]  is literally false alarm
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:04.520]  that's literally the
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:06.520]  headline in the story that I'm covering
[1:52:06.520 --> 1:52:08.520]  and it's even in the video
[1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:10.520]  see there's the story right there
[1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:12.520]  see that's how fast the crew works I don't have the story
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:14.520]  in front of me but there they have it
[1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:16.520]  bomb threat at Boston Children's Hospital
[1:52:16.520 --> 1:52:18.520]  was false alarm
[1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:20.520]  so I cover that story
[1:52:20.520 --> 1:52:22.520]  talking about how Jussie
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:24.520]  Smallette fakes hate crimes talking about how
[1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:26.520]  AOC makes up stories about
[1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:28.520]  what happened to her on January 6th
[1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:30.520]  there's all these different examples they're investigating this
[1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:32.520]  BYU athlete that claims someone called her
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:34.520]  the n-word there's been a large investigation
[1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:36.520]  nobody can find any proof of it
[1:52:36.520 --> 1:52:38.520]  so there's all so yeah you liberals fake crap
[1:52:38.520 --> 1:52:40.520]  all the time it's all you do
[1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:42.520]  just like Chris
[1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:44.520]  Jacob pretending he was in
[1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:46.520]  Kuwait getting bombed
[1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:48.520]  he's in a basement in Atlanta fake news
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:50.520]  CNN
[1:52:50.520 --> 1:52:52.520]  there's a whole news story out there about how you guys
[1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:54.520]  fake stuff all the time
[1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:56.520]  and then I'm just covering a story
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:52:58.520]  that says it's a false alarm
[1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:00.520]  and Media Matter says wow
[1:53:00.520 --> 1:53:02.520]  Owen Schreuer says false flag
[1:53:02.520 --> 1:53:04.520]  so okay
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:06.520]  you guys are liars
[1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:08.520]  that's your job
[1:53:08.520 --> 1:53:10.520]  you hate us you want us dead I get it
[1:53:10.520 --> 1:53:12.520]  I know that's who you are
[1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:14.520]  here's what I find funny
[1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:16.520]  and this is really what it comes down to
[1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:18.520]  oh and you're doing the same
[1:53:18.520 --> 1:53:20.520]  and they do the same thing to Matt Walsh now
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:22.520]  he's all dead
[1:53:22.520 --> 1:53:24.520]  Chrissy Strope
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:26.520]  white Christian terrorists like Matt Walsh
[1:53:26.520 --> 1:53:28.520]  are going to get people killed
[1:53:28.520 --> 1:53:30.520]  what did Matt Walsh do?
[1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:32.520]  he shares a public profile
[1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:34.520]  page of a doctor
[1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:36.520]  who brags about adolescent top surgery
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:38.520]  that's all he did
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:40.520]  it's a public page
[1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:42.520]  and he just shares it
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:44.520]  and liberals say oh he's trying to get you killed
[1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:46.520]  no you're the ones that want us killed
[1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:48.520]  but you're too cowardly
[1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:50.520]  because here's my point
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:52.520]  so Ari Drennan is tuned in right now
[1:53:52.520 --> 1:53:54.520]  she might even do
[1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:56.520]  a video or a story about this segment
[1:53:56.520 --> 1:53:58.520]  but here's what I've noticed
[1:53:58.520 --> 1:54:00.520]  like when I called out Ron Flopowski the other day
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:02.520]  he has not mentioned us once since then
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:04.520]  because he's a total fraud
[1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:06.520]  and a coward
[1:54:06.520 --> 1:54:08.520]  so here's what I say to
[1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:10.520]  the Media Matters
[1:54:10.520 --> 1:54:12.520]  team that's tuned in today
[1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:14.520]  and Ari I'm sure you're tuned in today too
[1:54:14.520 --> 1:54:16.520]  it's your job
[1:54:16.520 --> 1:54:18.520]  to be on air and debate us
[1:54:18.520 --> 1:54:20.520]  I'm just curious
[1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:22.520]  I'm just curious if you're so
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:24.520]  intellectually superior
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:26.520]  if your
[1:54:26.520 --> 1:54:28.520]  political savvy is so superior
[1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:30.520]  to ours if you're so much smarter
[1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:32.520]  and brighter and better than we are
[1:54:32.520 --> 1:54:34.520]  then why don't you ever come on the air
[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:36.520]  to debate us
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:38.520]  why don't you ever engage
[1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:40.520]  in political discourse
[1:54:40.520 --> 1:54:42.520]  why do you hide behind
[1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:44.520]  your computer desks
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:46.520]  watching us 24-7
[1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:48.520]  writing hit pieces about us because you want us dead
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:50.520]  why don't you ever
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:52.520]  open up for a public debate
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:54.520]  if you don't want to come on this platform
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:56.520]  fine why don't you ever reach out for comment
[1:54:58.520 --> 1:55:00.520]  you never reach out for comment
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:02.520]  the hundreds of times you've written about me
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:04.520]  not whatsoever received an email requesting comment
[1:55:06.520 --> 1:55:08.520]  why don't we do it on your platform
[1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:10.520]  you want to have a debate let's do it on your platform
[1:55:10.520 --> 1:55:12.520]  you guys can hire the team
[1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:14.520]  of people to try to confuse me and trick me
[1:55:14.520 --> 1:55:16.520]  please bring it on
[1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:18.520]  I welcome the day liberals will finally debate
[1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:20.520]  I'm
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:22.520]  begging for the day I can actually get
[1:55:22.520 --> 1:55:24.520]  into a political debate with a liberal democrat again
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:26.520]  you won't do it because
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:28.520]  you know you're intellectually inferior
[1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:30.520]  you know your policies don't work
[1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:32.520]  and you're cowards and frauds
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:34.520]  so you tune in here
[1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:36.520]  every day listening to Alex Jones
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:38.520]  or Owen Schreuer
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:40.520]  and it's your job to tune in here
[1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:42.520]  and tell us your negative stories about us
[1:55:42.520 --> 1:55:44.520]  but for all the hours
[1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:46.520]  you spend watching and all the hours
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:48.520]  you spend trying to destroy us and get us killed
[1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:50.520]  you will never face us
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:52.520]  will you
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:54.520]  you'll never confront us in person
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:56.520]  you'll never send us a request
[1:55:56.520 --> 1:55:58.520]  for comment on your stories
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:56:00.520]  and you'll never come on the air to debate
[1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:02.520]  and I just wonder why
[1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:04.520]  but we all know
[1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:06.520]  why don't we
[1:56:06.520 --> 1:56:08.520]  we all know why
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:10.520]  because you know you can't debate
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:12.520]  and you know if you tried to
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:14.520]  debate you would get absolutely annihilated
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:16.520]  and embarrassed
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:18.520]  but here's your chance every time
[1:56:18.520 --> 1:56:20.520]  one of these new media matters
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:22.520]  members pops up to watch us
[1:56:22.520 --> 1:56:24.520]  and write hit pieces about us
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:26.520]  I always offer them the same thing
[1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:28.520]  come on air and debate
[1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:30.520]  come on air and prove how bad I am
[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:32.520]  come on air and prove how dumb I am
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:34.520]  come on air and prove how intellectually
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:36.520]  and morally superior to me
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:38.520]  go ahead and do it
[1:56:38.520 --> 1:56:40.520]  so far I'm owe for
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:42.520]  ever
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:44.520]  trying to get you on the air so
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:46.520]  let's see what happens so
[1:56:46.520 --> 1:56:48.520]  this is how it goes every time folks
[1:56:48.520 --> 1:56:50.520]  they watch the show, they write hit pieces about us
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:52.520]  they never reach out for comment
[1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:54.520]  I come on the air and say why don't you
[1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:56.520]  ever reach out for comment
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:56:58.520]  why won't you ever come on the air and debate
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:00.520]  and then they never cover me again
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:04.520]  whether it's Jared Holt
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:06.520]  or now it's
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:08.520]  or Timothy Johnson or maybe now it's
[1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:10.520]  Ari Drennan
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:12.520]  so come on Ari
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:14.520]  you say I'm built different
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:16.520]  come on here and explain it
[1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:18.520]  you say I shouldn't be telling
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:20.520]  people about a false flag even though
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:22.520]  it's the actual Boston Children's Hospital
[1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:24.520]  saying it was a false alarm
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:26.520]  tell me how you've got me
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:28.520]  tell me how you've figured it out
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:30.520]  tell me how wrong I am Ari
[1:57:30.520 --> 1:57:32.520]  you won't do it because you're a coward
[1:57:32.520 --> 1:57:34.520]  and a fraud just like all
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:36.520]  your cohorts at Media Matters

[1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:40.520]  in this country
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:42.520]  and just like the Democrats
[1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:44.520]  that won't debate Republicans
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:46.520]  not a single Democrat will have a debate before the midterms

[2:00:34.520 --> 2:00:36.520]  basically every other time I host this show at this point
[2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:38.520]  the biggest world right now
[2:00:38.520 --> 2:00:40.520]  is a story that is being completely ignored
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:42.520]  by the mainstream media
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:44.520]  yet again as it relates
[2:00:44.520 --> 2:00:46.520]  to Ukraine
[2:00:46.520 --> 2:00:48.520]  as our own government sends billions more
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:50.520]  in military aid that mysteriously
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:52.520]  just vanishes into thin air
[2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:54.520]  as the Biden administration commits
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:56.520]  to sending billions more
[2:00:56.520 --> 2:00:58.520]  of military aid that just vanishes into thin air
[2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:00.520]  what was happening
[2:01:00.520 --> 2:01:02.520]  weeks after the start of the war
[2:01:02.520 --> 2:01:04.520]  back at the end of March
[2:01:04.520 --> 2:01:06.520]  beginning of April
[2:01:06.520 --> 2:01:08.520]  this isn't being reported anywhere
[2:01:08.520 --> 2:01:10.520]  it's being reported by one
[2:01:10.520 --> 2:01:12.520]  single news outlet
[2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:14.520]  pro-western by the way
[2:01:14.520 --> 2:01:16.520]  pro-Ukraine news outlet
[2:01:16.520 --> 2:01:18.520]  we're going to get on to what they said
[2:01:18.520 --> 2:01:20.520]  in the next segment
[2:01:20.520 --> 2:01:22.520]  ton of news though
[2:01:22.520 --> 2:01:24.520]  we've got a lot more on
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:26.520]  lockdown COVID pandemic vaccines
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:28.520]  of course we had another big scandal
[2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:30.520]  which should have been one of the biggest stories
[2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:32.520]  in the world here in the UK
[2:01:32.520 --> 2:01:34.520]  last week where it came out
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:36.520]  that the potential next prime minister basically said
[2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:38.520]  the cabinet ministers
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:40.520]  in the British government had no say
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:42.520]  on what the lockdown policy
[2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:44.520]  was going to be throughout the COVID pandemic
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:46.520]  in many cases they weren't even told
[2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:48.520]  what the policy was going to be
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:50.520]  it was a scientific dictatorship
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:52.520]  of the elite
[2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:54.520]  they weren't even canvassed
[2:01:54.520 --> 2:01:56.520]  it was basically a rogue scientific
[2:01:56.520 --> 2:01:58.520]  dictatorship in control
[2:01:58.520 --> 2:02:00.520]  of lockdown policies in the United Kingdom
[2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:02.520]  and that continues to reverberate
[2:02:02.520 --> 2:02:04.520]  in terms of excess deaths
[2:02:04.520 --> 2:02:06.520]  caused by lockdown
[2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:08.520]  untreated illnesses
[2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:10.520]  caused by a certain other thing
[2:02:10.520 --> 2:02:12.520]  as well which we're going to get into
[2:02:12.520 --> 2:02:14.520]  China is locking down again
[2:02:14.520 --> 2:02:16.520]  they're still pursuing
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:18.520]  this disastrous zero COVID policy
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:20.520]  which a lot of our own
[2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:22.520]  scientific establishment still want
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:24.520]  to pursue as viewers
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:26.520]  a few months ago
[2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:28.520]  they're now locking down another city
[2:02:28.520 --> 2:02:30.520]  in Chengdu this time we've seen the footage
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:32.520]  people screaming
[2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:34.520]  from high-rise apartment buildings
[2:02:34.520 --> 2:02:36.520]  people scrambling to get out of supermarkets
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:38.520]  because they literally announced a lockdown
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:40.520]  that minute
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:42.520]  that second and if you don't get
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:44.520]  out of there in time
[2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:46.520]  you are locked down
[2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:48.520]  we have the German foreign minister
[2:02:48.520 --> 2:02:50.520]  saying that she
[2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:52.520]  representing her country supposedly
[2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:54.520]  representing Germans will continue to
[2:02:54.520 --> 2:02:56.520]  support Ukraine throw money into
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:02:58.520]  the black hole to prolong the war
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:00.520]  a thousand miles away
[2:03:00.520 --> 2:03:02.520]  no matter what German people think
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:04.520]  she actually came out and admitted that
[2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:06.520]  during one of these NGO conferences
[2:03:06.520 --> 2:03:08.520]  so we're going to get into that as well
[2:03:10.520 --> 2:03:12.520]  Gazprom the Russian
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:14.520]  energy giant state backed has just
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:16.520]  announced record profits
[2:03:16.520 --> 2:03:18.520]  really going well that cutting off
[2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:20.520]  Russia isn't it sanctioning them
[2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:22.520]  meanwhile you'll find out
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:24.520]  what people in Colorado experience
[2:03:24.520 --> 2:03:26.520]  during a heat wave
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:28.520]  when they tried to adjust their
[2:03:28.520 --> 2:03:30.520]  air conditioning thermostats
[2:03:30.520 --> 2:03:32.520]  and were basically locked out
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:34.520]  from doing so little taste
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:36.520]  of the great reset there for you
[2:03:36.520 --> 2:03:38.520]  Germans should go vegan
[2:03:38.520 --> 2:03:40.520]  to save the environment another proposal
[2:03:40.520 --> 2:03:42.520]  from the Green Party which is basically
[2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:44.520]  now a huge power block
[2:03:44.520 --> 2:03:46.520]  semi in control of the German government
[2:03:46.520 --> 2:03:48.520]  they've risen that far they're really enjoying
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:50.520]  this great reset agenda
[2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:52.520]  prices in UK stores
[2:03:52.520 --> 2:03:54.520]  sought a 17 year high
[2:03:54.520 --> 2:03:56.520]  of course I've spoken before
[2:03:56.520 --> 2:03:58.520]  about the cost of living
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:00.520]  crisis in the United Kingdom
[2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:02.520]  despite the fact that we're supposedly
[2:04:02.520 --> 2:04:04.520]  not even dependent on Russian gas
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:06.520]  turns out we're actually buying
[2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:08.520]  Chinese gas which is in turn buying it
[2:04:08.520 --> 2:04:10.520]  from Russia so we are buying Russian gas
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:12.520]  but we're not dependent on it
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:14.520]  we have heating bills now
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:16.520]  increasing by thousands and thousands
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:18.520]  of percent a quarter of Brits saying
[2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:20.520]  they'll simply refuse to turn
[2:04:20.520 --> 2:04:22.520]  the heating on at all
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:24.520]  throughout the entire winter
[2:04:24.520 --> 2:04:26.520]  we've got three quarters of pubs
[2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:28.520]  the heart of communities
[2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:30.520]  the heart of heritage in England
[2:04:30.520 --> 2:04:32.520]  threatening to close over
[2:04:32.520 --> 2:04:34.520]  the next six months or so
[2:04:34.520 --> 2:04:36.520]  because of the current thing crisis
[2:04:36.520 --> 2:04:38.520]  we're going to get into that
[2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:40.520]  we're going to get into the Notting Hill Carnival
[2:04:40.520 --> 2:04:42.520]  the celebration a showcase
[2:04:42.520 --> 2:04:44.520]  of diversity of multiculturalism
[2:04:44.520 --> 2:04:46.520]  an annual event that is also
[2:04:46.520 --> 2:04:48.520]  annually beset by violent
[2:04:48.520 --> 2:04:50.520]  crimes sexual assaults
[2:04:50.520 --> 2:04:52.520]  and in this case a fatal stabbing
[2:04:52.520 --> 2:04:54.520]  we'll get into all that more on the other side
[2:04:54.520 --> 2:04:58.520]  so we don't need to go away
[2:04:58.520 --> 2:05:00.520]  everybody knows that high quality fish oil
[2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:02.520]  does fantastic things
[2:05:02.520 --> 2:05:04.520]  for your cardiovascular system
[2:05:04.520 --> 2:05:06.520]  for your brain for every part of your body
[2:05:06.520 --> 2:05:08.520]  but what I don't see being
[2:05:08.520 --> 2:05:10.520]  promoted is the fact that it has
[2:05:10.520 --> 2:05:12.520]  natural
[2:05:12.520 --> 2:05:14.520]  psychotropic effects
[2:05:14.520 --> 2:05:16.520]  it certainly does for me
[2:05:16.520 --> 2:05:18.520]  when I take a couple of these capsules
[2:05:18.520 --> 2:05:20.520]  from an hour before bed my sleep
[2:05:20.520 --> 2:05:22.520]  my dreams are amazing
[2:05:22.520 --> 2:05:24.520]  now there are actually some studies out there
[2:05:24.520 --> 2:05:26.520]  linking it to amazing
[2:05:26.520 --> 2:05:28.520]  events in the brain
[2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:30.520]  but I want you to experience it
[2:05:30.520 --> 2:05:32.520]  yourself we know it's good for your heart
[2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:34.520]  we know it's good for your brain
[2:05:34.520 --> 2:05:36.520]  we know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[2:05:36.520 --> 2:05:38.520]  and every other function of your body
[2:05:38.520 --> 2:05:40.520]  but I want you to experience
[2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:42.520]  this high grade fish oil

[2:05:44.520 --> 2:05:46.520]  and see what it does if you take it before bed time
[2:05:46.520 --> 2:05:48.520]  ultimate fish oil

[2:05:50.520 --> 2:05:52.520]  now exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[2:05:52.520 --> 2:05:54.520]  thank you all for your support
[2:05:54.520 --> 2:06:22.520]  you're really going to miss out if you don't get it
[2:06:22.520 --> 2:06:24.520]  the then Chancellor of the UK
[2:06:24.520 --> 2:06:26.520]  in the running to be Prime Minister
[2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:28.520]  he's probably not going to win
[2:06:28.520 --> 2:06:30.520]  but it came out basically that he had no say
[2:06:30.520 --> 2:06:32.520]  and locked down the cabinet ministers
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:34.520]  within the government were told
[2:06:34.520 --> 2:06:36.520]  what was going to happen they had no role
[2:06:36.520 --> 2:06:38.520]  in deciding what was going to happen
[2:06:38.520 --> 2:06:40.520]  despite the fact that they were literally
[2:06:40.520 --> 2:06:42.520]  the government
[2:06:42.520 --> 2:06:44.520]  the entire response to the pandemic was driven by
[2:06:44.520 --> 2:06:46.520]  basically a scientific
[2:06:46.520 --> 2:06:48.520]  dictatorship of medical advisors
[2:06:48.520 --> 2:06:50.520]  with no responsibility
[2:06:50.520 --> 2:06:52.520]  no representation of the British people
[2:06:52.520 --> 2:06:54.520]  well it came out two weeks ago
[2:06:54.520 --> 2:06:56.520]  that the effects
[2:06:56.520 --> 2:06:58.520]  of lockdown may now be killing more
[2:06:58.520 --> 2:07:00.520]  people than Covid itself
[2:07:00.520 --> 2:07:02.520]  of course we said
[2:07:02.520 --> 2:07:04.520]  this would happen right at the start
[2:07:04.520 --> 2:07:06.520]  we warned everybody about it
[2:07:06.520 --> 2:07:08.520]  we were called granny killers
[2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:10.520]  we were called Covid idiots
[2:07:10.520 --> 2:07:12.520]  now it's happening this is based on official statistics
[2:07:12.520 --> 2:07:14.520]  from the ONS out of the UK
[2:07:14.520 --> 2:07:16.520]  non-covid excess deaths
[2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:18.520]  continue to outstrip Covid deaths
[2:07:18.520 --> 2:07:20.520]  1,000 people dying each week
[2:07:20.520 --> 2:07:22.520]  from conditions
[2:07:22.520 --> 2:07:24.520]  other than the virus
[2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:26.520]  above and beyond the average of excess deaths
[2:07:26.520 --> 2:07:28.520]  in any previous five
[2:07:28.520 --> 2:07:30.520]  year period
[2:07:30.520 --> 2:07:32.520]  we have this out of the daily skeptic today
[2:07:32.520 --> 2:07:34.520]  excess non-covid deaths
[2:07:34.520 --> 2:07:36.520]  top 15,317 weeks
[2:07:36.520 --> 2:07:38.520]  as mysterious wave
[2:07:38.520 --> 2:07:40.520]  of heart deaths continues
[2:07:40.520 --> 2:07:42.520]  now bear in mind
[2:07:42.520 --> 2:07:44.520]  that we had a media
[2:07:44.520 --> 2:07:46.520]  sustained with daily Covid death
[2:07:46.520 --> 2:07:48.520]  tolls for a period of what
[2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:50.520]  18 months, 2 years
[2:07:50.520 --> 2:07:52.520]  where every single day
[2:07:52.520 --> 2:07:54.520]  they would laboriously explain to you
[2:07:54.520 --> 2:07:56.520]  how many people had died of Covid
[2:07:56.520 --> 2:07:58.520]  didn't matter that a lot of those deaths
[2:07:58.520 --> 2:08:00.520]  were actually
[2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:02.520]  due to several of the comorbidities
[2:08:02.520 --> 2:08:04.520]  had nothing really to do with Covid
[2:08:04.520 --> 2:08:06.520]  they would drum beat
[2:08:06.520 --> 2:08:08.520]  that into the population on a daily basis
[2:08:08.520 --> 2:08:10.520]  for a period of nearly 2 years
[2:08:12.520 --> 2:08:14.520]  now we have 1,000
[2:08:14.520 --> 2:08:16.520]  excess non-covid excess deaths
[2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:18.520]  a day in the United Kingdom
[2:08:18.520 --> 2:08:20.520]  the media barely even talks
[2:08:20.520 --> 2:08:22.520]  about it, well there is an investigation
[2:08:22.520 --> 2:08:24.520]  into it finally from the government
[2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:26.520]  we'll wait to see what happens out of that
[2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:28.520]  but again it's being found
[2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:30.520]  that in many cases these
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:32.520]  excess deaths aren't just
[2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:34.520]  people not being treated for cancer
[2:08:34.520 --> 2:08:36.520]  and in many cases
[2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:38.520]  they are cardiovascular deaths
[2:08:38.520 --> 2:08:40.520]  gee I wonder
[2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:42.520]  what that could be
[2:08:42.520 --> 2:08:44.520]  so as there have been 15,357
[2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:46.520]  excess non-covid deaths
[2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:48.520]  registered in England and Wales
[2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:50.520]  in the last 17 weeks since the end of April
[2:08:50.520 --> 2:08:52.520]  according to official data
[2:08:52.520 --> 2:08:54.520]  that's 9.5%
[2:08:54.520 --> 2:08:56.520]  more than expected based on an
[2:08:56.520 --> 2:08:58.520]  average of the previous 5 years
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:00.520]  this is above and beyond
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:02.520]  this is something extraordinary
[2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:04.520]  that we haven't seen before
[2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:06.520]  in the week ending August 19
[2:09:06.520 --> 2:09:08.520]  the most recent week for which data is available
[2:09:08.520 --> 2:09:10.520]  10,982 deaths were
[2:09:10.520 --> 2:09:12.520]  registered in England and Wales which is
[2:09:12.520 --> 2:09:14.520]  18.6% above
[2:09:14.520 --> 2:09:16.520]  the 5 year average
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:18.520]  says of these
[2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:20.520]  551 mentioned COVID-19 on the death
[2:09:20.520 --> 2:09:22.520]  certificate as a contributory cause
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:24.520]  354 mentioned COVID-19
[2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:26.520]  as underlying cause leaving
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:28.520]  1,365 deaths
[2:09:28.520 --> 2:09:30.520]  from a different underlying cause
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:32.520]  it goes on
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:34.520]  to point out that there appears to be
[2:09:34.520 --> 2:09:36.520]  a direct correlation and there's a graph
[2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:38.520]  in this article showing it
[2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:40.520]  between the fourth dose
[2:09:40.520 --> 2:09:42.520]  booster rollout among
[2:09:42.520 --> 2:09:44.520]  over 75s in England
[2:09:44.520 --> 2:09:46.520]  and this wave of excess
[2:09:46.520 --> 2:09:48.520]  deaths in fact you look at the graph
[2:09:48.520 --> 2:09:50.520]  it tracks almost exactly
[2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:52.520]  there's vaccine researcher Theo Shetters
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:54.520]  has highlighted a similar
[2:09:54.520 --> 2:09:56.520]  correlation in the Netherlands
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:09:58.520]  and race concerns the vaccines may be contributing
[2:09:58.520 --> 2:10:00.520]  to the deaths
[2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:02.520]  correlation which was strong
[2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:04.520]  during the spring and early summer
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:06.520]  has not continued in England and Wales
[2:10:06.520 --> 2:10:08.520]  it's remained high
[2:10:08.520 --> 2:10:10.520]  so the boosters have
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:12.520]  dropped off but the actual
[2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:14.520]  excess deaths among over 75s
[2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:16.520]  has remained high as depicted
[2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:18.520]  in the second graph in this article
[2:10:18.520 --> 2:10:20.520]  so this may be an indication
[2:10:20.520 --> 2:10:22.520]  of ongoing vaccine injury perhaps
[2:10:22.520 --> 2:10:24.520]  in conjunction with the effects of previous
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:26.520]  COVID infection or the operation
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:28.520]  of another cause
[2:10:28.520 --> 2:10:30.520]  so again it tracks almost entirely
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:32.520]  the spring boosters
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:34.520]  and they're talking about
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:36.520]  cardiovascular excess deaths
[2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:38.520]  so it's following
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:40.520]  a welcome intervention from Oxford professor
[2:10:40.520 --> 2:10:42.520]  Carl Hennigan the government has now said
[2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:44.520]  it's looking into what's causing this
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:46.520]  unusual level of excess deaths
[2:10:46.520 --> 2:10:48.520]  however the vaccines have not
[2:10:48.520 --> 2:10:50.520]  yet been mentioned as a possible
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:52.520]  contributory factor despite the deaths being
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:54.520]  largely cardiovascular in nature
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:10:56.520]  the vaccines having
[2:10:56.520 --> 2:10:58.520]  known adverse effects on the heart
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:00.520]  and circulatory system
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:02.520]  again they're not cancer
[2:11:02.520 --> 2:11:04.520]  death there is some of that going on
[2:11:04.520 --> 2:11:06.520]  but it says the fact that cancer deaths
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:08.520]  are not above average
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:10.520]  counts against the suggestion that
[2:11:10.520 --> 2:11:12.520]  the main cause of death is denial of
[2:11:12.520 --> 2:11:14.520]  healthcare access during the pandemic
[2:11:14.520 --> 2:11:16.520]  meanwhile New York Post reports
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:18.520]  Canadian junior
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:20.520]  hockey captain dies during
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:22.520]  tournament game
[2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:24.520]  another healthy fit
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:26.520]  young athlete just suddenly collapsing
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:28.520]  out of nowhere with
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:30.520]  cardiovascular issues and dying
[2:11:30.520 --> 2:11:32.520]  we've seen it with football players
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:34.520]  we've seen it with numerous other sportsmen
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:36.520]  and women for the past two years
[2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:38.520]  well now rising Canadian junior
[2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:40.520]  hockey player Eli Palfreman
[2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:42.520]  reportedly died in the locker room
[2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:44.520]  during a pre-season game in Ontario
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:46.520]  on Tuesday night
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:48.520]  the 20 year old Ontario native
[2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:50.520]  collapsed during the first intermission
[2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:52.520]  of the air centennials pre-season
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:54.520]  tournament game at the North Dumfries
[2:11:54.520 --> 2:11:56.520]  community complex according to the Toronto Sun
[2:11:56.520 --> 2:11:58.520]  emergency officials
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:00.520]  were unable to revive
[2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:02.520]  the star forward
[2:12:02.520 --> 2:12:04.520]  they've not disclosed the cause of death
[2:12:04.520 --> 2:12:06.520]  and the centennials organisation
[2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:08.520]  said it will not speculate out of respect
[2:12:08.520 --> 2:12:10.520]  for the family's right to privacy
[2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:12.520]  we don't know what the cause of death was
[2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:14.520]  but again yet another 20 year old athlete
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:16.520]  can peak physical condition
[2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:18.520]  just suddenly collapsing
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:20.520]  with cardiovascular issues out of nowhere
[2:12:20.520 --> 2:12:22.520]  meanwhile BBC
[2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:24.520]  news reports Covid in China
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:26.520]  Chengdu lockdown after outbreak
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:28.520]  remember we had those
[2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:30.520]  scenes of people screaming
[2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:32.520]  from their apartment blocks
[2:12:32.520 --> 2:12:34.520]  people rushing to get out of supermarkets
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:36.520]  because they literally announced
[2:12:36.520 --> 2:12:38.520]  these zero Covid policy lockdowns
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:40.520]  in these Chinese cities
[2:12:40.520 --> 2:12:42.520]  and it applies from that second
[2:12:42.520 --> 2:12:44.520]  from that minute
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:46.520]  even during the height of the pandemic
[2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:48.520]  in the west you know they'd announced the new lockdown
[2:12:48.520 --> 2:12:50.520]  a couple of days in the future
[2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:52.520]  well now it's the
[2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:54.520]  instantly authorities announce it
[2:12:54.520 --> 2:12:56.520]  and bear in mind
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:12:58.520]  China was the model
[2:12:58.520 --> 2:13:00.520]  Professor Neil Armstrong
[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:02.520]  the guru of our modelling
[2:13:02.520 --> 2:13:04.520]  of our lockdown campaign in the United Kingdom
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:06.520]  said we didn't think
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:08.520]  we could get away with what the communist
[2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:10.520]  Chinese were doing but then we saw
[2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:12.520]  Italy get away with it
[2:13:12.520 --> 2:13:14.520]  and we thought we could get away with it
[2:13:14.520 --> 2:13:16.520]  it was literally modelled on their policy
[2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:18.520]  and many of these hysterical
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:20.520]  Covidians
[2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:22.520]  over the course of the past six months
[2:13:22.520 --> 2:13:24.520]  have wanted us to aspire
[2:13:24.520 --> 2:13:26.520]  to a zero Covid lockdown policy
[2:13:26.520 --> 2:13:28.520]  well how's it going in China
[2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:30.520]  Chengdu has become the latest
[2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:32.520]  Chinese city to be locked down as Beijing
[2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:34.520]  continues to pursue its controversial zero
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:36.520]  Covid policy
[2:13:36.520 --> 2:13:38.520]  around 21 million people have been ordered to
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:40.520]  stay indoors with just one person per household
[2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:42.520]  allowed out for essential shopping
[2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:44.520]  they're still pursuing this
[2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:46.520]  they get a handful of infections
[2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:48.520]  they lock down in tiger cities
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:50.520]  of 21 million people
[2:13:50.520 --> 2:13:52.520]  now again
[2:13:52.520 --> 2:13:54.520]  it kind of counters the narrative
[2:13:54.520 --> 2:13:56.520]  although there's a lot of evidence
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:13:58.520]  that it came out of the lab
[2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:00.520]  that it was deliberate because
[2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:02.520]  why is China
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:04.520]  committing Harry Carey sacrificing its own economy
[2:14:04.520 --> 2:14:06.520]  by continuing this
[2:14:06.520 --> 2:14:08.520]  disastrous zero Covid policy
[2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:10.520]  if they deliberately released the virus
[2:14:10.520 --> 2:14:12.520]  surely they wouldn't do that
[2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:14.520]  surely they just encourage
[2:14:14.520 --> 2:14:16.520]  other countries competitors to do that
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:18.520]  but again they've locked down
[2:14:18.520 --> 2:14:20.520]  yet another city
[2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:22.520]  does Chengdu's residents
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:24.520]  have to stay home from six o'clock local time
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:26.520]  on Thursday all be tested over the coming days
[2:14:26.520 --> 2:14:28.520]  but it was not clear
[2:14:28.520 --> 2:14:30.520]  when restrictions would be lifted
[2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:32.520]  so they're still laboring
[2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:34.520]  under zero Covid
[2:14:34.520 --> 2:14:36.520]  insanity
[2:14:36.520 --> 2:14:38.520]  I'm going to come back in the next segment though
[2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:40.520]  and talk about what I believe
[2:14:40.520 --> 2:14:42.520]  is the biggest story being ignored
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:44.520]  by the mainstream media today
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:46.520]  and that is the fact that
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:48.520]  we have a cost of living crisis
[2:14:48.520 --> 2:14:50.520]  we have Boris Johnson out in public
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:52.520]  visiting Ukraine
[2:14:52.520 --> 2:14:54.520]  giving speeches saying that
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:14:56.520]  the Ukraine people are paying
[2:14:56.520 --> 2:14:58.520]  in blood that we need to pay
[2:14:58.520 --> 2:15:00.520]  in the form of higher
[2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:02.520]  energy bills and this isn't just
[2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:04.520]  a little spike in your electricity
[2:15:04.520 --> 2:15:06.520]  in your gas bill
[2:15:06.520 --> 2:15:08.520]  this is half the country entering
[2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:10.520]  fuel poverty
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:12.520]  we had average yearly household bills
[2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:14.520]  at the start of this year
[2:15:14.520 --> 2:15:16.520]  down at around £1,000
[2:15:16.520 --> 2:15:18.520]  £1,200 a year
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:20.520]  as of October
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:22.520]  they're going to basically quadruple
[2:15:22.520 --> 2:15:24.520]  and now next year early next year
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:26.520]  they're talking about the average yearly household bill
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:28.520]  for energy in the United Kingdom
[2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:30.520]  surpassing £6,000
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:32.520]  that is going to
[2:15:32.520 --> 2:15:34.520]  put half the country
[2:15:34.520 --> 2:15:36.520]  into fuel poverty
[2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:38.520]  it's going to put about a third of the country into
[2:15:38.520 --> 2:15:40.520]  actual basic poverty
[2:15:40.520 --> 2:15:42.520]  that's why they're talking about civil unrest
[2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:44.520]  they're talking about riots on threes
[2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:46.520]  but none of it had to happen
[2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:48.520]  and when we come back on the other side
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:50.520]  we're going to tell you precisely why
[2:15:50.520 --> 2:16:14.520]  we're going to tell you exactly why we're going to tell you that
[2:16:14.520 --> 2:16:20.520]  not of US history it's already number one over 40 categories like political science you name it
[2:16:20.520 --> 2:16:22.520]  40 plus categories is number one
[2:16:22.520 --> 2:16:24.520]  ladies and gentlemen drum roll please
[2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:26.520]  of books in the world
[2:16:26.520 --> 2:16:28.520]  the great reset in the war for the world
[2:16:28.520 --> 2:16:32.520]  is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
[2:16:32.520 --> 2:16:34.520]  we are now number nine
[2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:36.520]  in the world
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:38.520]  this is major
[2:16:38.520 --> 2:16:40.520]  this is political
[2:16:40.520 --> 2:16:42.520]  this could fund our war chest
[2:16:42.520 --> 2:16:44.520]  everybody and by ten copies
[2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:46.520]  send this blueprint
[2:16:46.520 --> 2:16:48.520]  to the death star and the new world order
[2:16:48.520 --> 2:16:50.520]  because you read this you know their whole plan how to stop them

[2:16:52.520 --> 2:16:54.520]  it's going to go to number one
[2:16:54.520 --> 2:16:56.520]  what do you make of that
[2:16:56.520 --> 2:16:58.520]  we brought the game changing product
[2:16:58.520 --> 2:17:00.520]  previously only available to
[2:17:00.520 --> 2:17:02.520]  major oil companies
[2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:04.520]  around the world to the civilian market two years ago

[2:20:22.520 --> 2:20:24.520]  the German foreign minister came out yesterday
[2:20:24.520 --> 2:20:26.520]  and basically
[2:20:26.520 --> 2:20:28.520]  in front of an NGO
[2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:30.520]  forum with a bunch of these
[2:20:30.520 --> 2:20:32.520]  WEF great reset types

[2:20:46.520 --> 2:20:48.520]  weapons to the current
[2:20:48.520 --> 2:20:50.520]  thing over in Ukraine
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:20:52.520]  we're going to be 1000 miles away
[2:20:52.520 --> 2:20:54.520]  we stand with you as long as you need us
[2:20:54.520 --> 2:20:56.520]  then I want to deliver
[2:20:56.520 --> 2:20:58.520]  she said no matter what my German voters
[2:20:58.520 --> 2:21:00.520]  think
[2:21:00.520 --> 2:21:02.520]  but I want to deliver to the people of Ukraine
[2:21:02.520 --> 2:21:04.520]  was she elected by the people
[2:21:04.520 --> 2:21:06.520]  of Ukraine or was she elected by Germans
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:08.520]  by the way
[2:21:08.520 --> 2:21:10.520]  polls now showing that Germans
[2:21:10.520 --> 2:21:12.520]  increasingly unhappy with this
[2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:14.520]  policy that has left them
[2:21:14.520 --> 2:21:16.520]  suffering through a cost of living crisis
[2:21:16.520 --> 2:21:18.520]  to the point where local governments
[2:21:18.520 --> 2:21:20.520]  warm up spaces in major cities
[2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:22.520]  so people who can't afford to pay their
[2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:24.520]  heating bills won't
[2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:26.520]  freeze to death
[2:21:26.520 --> 2:21:28.520]  but I mentioned it at the top of the show
[2:21:28.520 --> 2:21:30.520]  the biggest story that they are ignoring
[2:21:30.520 --> 2:21:32.520]  let's get into it
[2:21:32.520 --> 2:21:34.520]  daily skeptic summarizes it
[2:21:34.520 --> 2:21:36.520]  did Boris Scottle peace talks between Ukraine
[2:21:36.520 --> 2:21:38.520]  and Russia
[2:21:38.520 --> 2:21:40.520]  there were peace talks back in early
[2:21:40.520 --> 2:21:42.520]  April that were all set to be finalized
[2:21:42.520 --> 2:21:44.520]  then Boris Johnson
[2:21:44.520 --> 2:21:46.520]  turns up in Ukraine on a surprise visit
[2:21:46.520 --> 2:21:48.520]  lo and behold
[2:21:48.520 --> 2:21:50.520]  the peace talks are scuppered
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:52.520]  this video is called
[2:21:52.520 --> 2:21:54.520]  it's a scam we're going to play that
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:56.520]  I'm going to talk about the fallout from all this
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:21:58.520]  but here it is it's a scam
[2:21:58.520 --> 2:22:00.520]  let's roll it
[2:22:02.520 --> 2:22:04.520]  well what do you know
[2:22:04.520 --> 2:22:06.520]  looks like we've been conned yet again
[2:22:06.520 --> 2:22:08.520]  turns out they had a peace deal between
[2:22:08.520 --> 2:22:10.520]  Ukraine and Russia all but
[2:22:10.520 --> 2:22:12.520]  finalized back in early April
[2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:14.520]  then it mysteriously got scuppered
[2:22:14.520 --> 2:22:16.520]  and now we have to face the misery
[2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:18.520]  of a cost of living crisis
[2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:20.520]  that could drag on for years and years
[2:22:20.520 --> 2:22:22.520]  foreign affairs
[2:22:22.520 --> 2:22:24.520]  a pro-western, pro-Ukraine news
[2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:26.520]  outlet reports
[2:22:26.520 --> 2:22:28.520]  according to multiple former senior US officials
[2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:30.520]  in April 2022 Russian
[2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:32.520]  and Ukrainian negotiators appear to have
[2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:34.520]  tentatively agreed on the outlines
[2:22:34.520 --> 2:22:36.520]  of a negotiated interim settlement
[2:22:36.520 --> 2:22:38.520]  Russia would withdraw to its position on February 23rd
[2:22:38.520 --> 2:22:40.520]  when it controlled part of the Donbas region
[2:22:40.520 --> 2:22:42.520]  and all of Crimea and in exchange
[2:22:42.520 --> 2:22:44.520]  Ukraine would promise not to
[2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:46.520]  seek NATO membership and instead
[2:22:46.520 --> 2:22:48.520]  receive security guarantees from a number of countries
[2:22:48.520 --> 2:22:50.520]  so why did the peace talks
[2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:52.520]  break down? because according to a report
[2:22:52.520 --> 2:22:54.520]  by Ukrainska Pravda
[2:22:54.520 --> 2:22:56.520]  which again is a pro-western newspaper
[2:22:56.520 --> 2:22:58.520]  in Ukraine Prime Minister Boris
[2:22:58.520 --> 2:23:00.520]  Johnson paid a surprise visit
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:02.520]  to President Zelensky and told him
[2:23:02.520 --> 2:23:04.520]  straight up even if Ukraine
[2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:06.520]  is ready to sign some agreements
[2:23:06.520 --> 2:23:08.520]  on guarantees with Putin
[2:23:08.520 --> 2:23:10.520]  they are not
[2:23:10.520 --> 2:23:12.520]  sabotage the peace deal
[2:23:12.520 --> 2:23:14.520]  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
[2:23:14.520 --> 2:23:16.520]  was also called on the idea of a peace deal
[2:23:16.520 --> 2:23:18.520]  because they thought early
[2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:20.520]  reports of Ukrainian victories
[2:23:20.520 --> 2:23:22.520]  on the battlefield which we now know
[2:23:22.520 --> 2:23:24.520]  were somewhat fancifully exaggerated
[2:23:24.520 --> 2:23:26.520]  by the media meant the war
[2:23:26.520 --> 2:23:28.520]  could be prolonged three days
[2:23:28.520 --> 2:23:30.520]  after Boris Johnson's surprise
[2:23:30.520 --> 2:23:32.520]  visit the Istanbul peace deal
[2:23:32.520 --> 2:23:34.520]  was dead quite convenient for Boris
[2:23:34.520 --> 2:23:36.520]  the continuation of conflict providing
[2:23:36.520 --> 2:23:38.520]  a useful distraction from his party
[2:23:38.520 --> 2:23:40.520]  gate scandal but this war
[2:23:40.520 --> 2:23:42.520]  could have been over within weeks
[2:23:42.520 --> 2:23:44.520]  of it beginning nearly
[2:23:44.520 --> 2:23:46.520]  five months ago but it didn't
[2:23:46.520 --> 2:23:48.520]  happen because certain forces
[2:23:48.520 --> 2:23:50.520]  didn't want the war to end
[2:23:50.520 --> 2:23:52.520]  it's a scam all this misery we now
[2:23:52.520 --> 2:23:54.520]  face due to this war people
[2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:56.520]  literally freezing to death because they're unable
[2:23:56.520 --> 2:23:58.520]  to afford the heating bill three quarters
[2:23:58.520 --> 2:24:00.520]  of British pubs facing permanent closure
[2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:02.520]  ripping the heart out of communities
[2:24:02.520 --> 2:24:04.520]  half the country entering fuel
[2:24:04.520 --> 2:24:06.520]  poverty a quality of life permanently
[2:24:06.520 --> 2:24:08.520]  deformed living standards
[2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:10.520]  crushed destitution
[2:24:10.520 --> 2:24:12.520]  depression suicide all of that
[2:24:12.520 --> 2:24:14.520]  could have been avoided with this
[2:24:14.520 --> 2:24:16.520]  peace deal but no the regime
[2:24:16.520 --> 2:24:18.520]  wanted the war to go on
[2:24:18.520 --> 2:24:20.520]  and how dense is the population
[2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:22.520]  letting all this happen right under
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:24.520]  their noses I got this electricity
[2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:26.520]  built today how in the name of God
[2:24:26.520 --> 2:24:28.520]  is this possible oh gee I wonder
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:30.520]  it really is a mystery
[2:24:30.520 --> 2:24:32.520]  maybe if you'd actually questioned
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:34.520]  what your own governments were doing instead of being
[2:24:34.520 --> 2:24:36.520]  more concerned with feeling smug about
[2:24:36.520 --> 2:24:38.520]  yourselves by flaying your little flags
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:40.520]  maybe your business wouldn't be going
[2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:42.520]  to the wall right now the German
[2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:44.520]  foreign minister just came out and admitted
[2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:46.520]  she doesn't care what the German people
[2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:48.520]  think you know the very people
[2:24:48.520 --> 2:24:50.520]  she's supposed to represent she's gonna support
[2:24:50.520 --> 2:24:52.520]  the current thing whatever happens
[2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:54.520]  but if I give the promise
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:24:56.520]  to people in Ukraine
[2:24:56.520 --> 2:24:58.520]  we stand with you as long
[2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:00.520]  as you need us
[2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:02.520]  then I want to deliver
[2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:04.520]  no matter what my German voters think
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:06.520]  but I want to deliver to the people of Ukraine
[2:25:06.520 --> 2:25:08.520]  yeah granny's freezing to death
[2:25:08.520 --> 2:25:10.520]  is apparently a price worth paying to maintain
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:12.520]  the liberal world order
[2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:14.520]  no matter what my German voters think
[2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:16.520]  the social fabric of society being ripped apart
[2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:18.520]  at the seams is apparently a minor piece
[2:25:18.520 --> 2:25:20.520]  of collateral damage to prolong a war
[2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:22.520]  a thousand miles away
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:24.520]  no matter what my German voters think
[2:25:24.520 --> 2:25:26.520]  let's take a brief pause there so I can tell you about
[2:25:26.520 --> 2:25:28.520]  the sponsor of this video it's no exaggeration
[2:25:28.520 --> 2:25:30.520]  to say that things are getting scary
[2:25:30.520 --> 2:25:32.520]  out there the biden administration
[2:25:32.520 --> 2:25:34.520]  has already printed more money in the past
[2:25:34.520 --> 2:25:36.520]  two years than the previous
[2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:38.520]  100 years combined
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:40.520]  the national debt just hit a record
[2:25:40.520 --> 2:25:42.520]  30 trillion dollars
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:44.520]  and inflation is the highest we've seen
[2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:46.520]  since 1982 if you
[2:25:46.520 --> 2:25:48.520]  have retirement savings your money could be at
[2:25:48.520 --> 2:25:50.520]  serious risk they're basically burning
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:25:52.520]  your cash torching your family's
[2:25:52.520 --> 2:25:54.520]  financial future you're gonna let
[2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:56.520]  them destroy everything you've worked
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:25:58.520]  for you're just gonna sit back and become
[2:25:58.520 --> 2:26:00.520]  a victim of the deliberate decimation
[2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:02.520]  of your living standards are you just
[2:26:02.520 --> 2:26:04.520]  gonna submit and eat the bugs

[2:26:36.520 --> 2:26:38.520]  now back to the video
[2:26:38.520 --> 2:26:40.520]  where is all this money of ours they're sending
[2:26:40.520 --> 2:26:42.520]  over there even going
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:44.520]  much of it down a giant gaping
[2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:46.520]  black hole Boris Johnson
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:48.520]  sent nearly 2.5 billion
[2:26:48.520 --> 2:26:50.520]  pounds of taxpayer money Joe Biden
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:52.520]  has sent over 10 billion dollars of
[2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:54.520]  US taxpayer money for what
[2:26:54.520 --> 2:26:56.520]  CBS News reported that 70%
[2:26:56.520 --> 2:26:58.520]  of the money is completely
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:00.520]  wasted do we have any sense
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:02.520]  as to where they're going
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:04.520]  we don't know there is really
[2:27:04.520 --> 2:27:06.520]  no information as to
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:08.520]  where they're going
[2:27:08.520 --> 2:27:10.520]  at all you know all this stuff goes
[2:27:10.520 --> 2:27:12.520]  through the border and they're kind of like something happens
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:14.520]  they kind of like you 30%
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:16.520]  maybe reaches its
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:18.520]  destination 30% and sends
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:20.520]  their own report of course only 30%
[2:27:20.520 --> 2:27:22.520]  of it reaches its final destination
[2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:24.520]  it's a scam
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:26.520]  the whole narrative that we need to end
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:28.520]  your crippling energy bills because Putin
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:30.520]  bad is also a scam
[2:27:30.520 --> 2:27:32.520]  we're buying Russian gas anyway
[2:27:32.520 --> 2:27:34.520]  only by means of China
[2:27:34.520 --> 2:27:36.520]  at exorbitant prices
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:38.520]  despite lower domestic demands due to
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:40.520]  its constant lockdowns China has
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:42.520]  bought over 2.35 million
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:44.520]  tons of liquefied natural gas
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:46.520]  this year so far
[2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:48.520]  much of it from Russia
[2:27:48.520 --> 2:27:50.520]  and who's the sucker buying all that excess
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:52.520]  natural gas being sold by China
[2:27:52.520 --> 2:27:54.520]  at vastly inflated prices
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:56.520]  Europe has zero
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:27:58.520]  head reports citing the financial time
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:00.520]  China has been quietly reselling
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:02.520]  that evil tainted Russian
[2:28:02.520 --> 2:28:04.520]  LNG to the one place that
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:06.520]  desperately needs it more than anything
[2:28:06.520 --> 2:28:08.520]  Europe and of course it's charging a kidney's
[2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:10.520]  worth of markups in the process
[2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:12.520]  we're ending our dependence on
[2:28:12.520 --> 2:28:14.520]  Putin's hydrocopy oh yeah we're no longer
[2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:16.520]  dependent on Russian gas
[2:28:16.520 --> 2:28:18.520]  we're just dependent on Chinese gas
[2:28:18.520 --> 2:28:20.520]  that's coming from Russia
[2:28:20.520 --> 2:28:22.520]  meanwhile the Russian state backed
[2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:24.520]  energy firm Gazprom just announced
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:26.520]  record profits it's a scam
[2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:28.520]  Boris Johnson's got the nerve
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:30.520]  to insist that Brits just blithely
[2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:32.520]  accept exorbitant energy bills
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:34.520]  to support the current thing
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:36.520]  if we're paying in our energy

[2:28:42.520 --> 2:28:44.520]  are paying
[2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:46.520]  in their blood after he sabotaged
[2:28:46.520 --> 2:28:48.520]  a peace deal that would have avert
[2:28:48.520 --> 2:28:50.520]  at all this we're paying higher
[2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:52.520]  energy bills and still using gas
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:54.520]  that originated in Russia

[2:32:02.520 --> 2:32:04.520]  or rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire
[2:32:04.520 --> 2:32:06.520]  Fortune and Money magazine
[2:32:06.520 --> 2:32:08.520]  have all done these profiles
[2:32:08.520 --> 2:32:10.520]  you see it every year 30 different tax returns
[2:32:10.520 --> 2:32:12.520]  30 different answers 50 different tax returns
[2:32:12.520 --> 2:32:14.520]  50 different answers
[2:32:14.520 --> 2:32:16.520]  and almost all of them just
[2:32:16.520 --> 2:32:18.520]  screw you over especially the big firms
[2:32:18.520 --> 2:32:20.520]  and the big tax groups because they're part of the system
[2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:22.520]  and they don't want the general public
[2:32:22.520 --> 2:32:24.520]  understanding this and knowing this
[2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:26.520]  so it's a very important situation
[2:32:26.520 --> 2:32:28.520]  with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[2:32:28.520 --> 2:32:30.520]  to be able

[2:32:36.520 --> 2:32:38.520]  we wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice
[2:32:38.520 --> 2:32:40.520]  in the last few years
[2:32:40.520 --> 2:32:42.520]  the only way you fail
[2:32:42.520 --> 2:32:44.520]  is not writing down the URL
[2:32:44.520 --> 2:32:46.520]  jonestaxrelief.com
[2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:48.520]  one word jonestaxrelief.com
[2:32:48.520 --> 2:32:50.520]  or call 833-904-285
[2:32:50.520 --> 2:33:00.520]  833-904-285
[2:33:32.520 --> 2:33:34.520]  so the peace deal was in place
[2:33:34.520 --> 2:33:36.520]  in early April
[2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:38.520]  a matter of weeks after the start
[2:33:38.520 --> 2:33:40.520]  of the Ukraine-Russia war
[2:33:40.520 --> 2:33:42.520]  foreign affairs is now reporting it
[2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:44.520]  admitting it Russian and Ukraine negotiators
[2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:46.520]  agreed
[2:33:46.520 --> 2:33:48.520]  a peace treaty
[2:33:48.520 --> 2:33:50.520]  then Boris Johnson turns up
[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:52.520]  no doubt with his orders
[2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:54.520]  three days later the peace deal is dead
[2:33:54.520 --> 2:33:56.520]  the regime basically said
[2:33:56.520 --> 2:33:58.520]  no we want this war to continue
[2:33:58.520 --> 2:34:00.520]  we want it to be prolonged
[2:34:00.520 --> 2:34:02.520]  we know it's going to exacerbate
[2:34:02.520 --> 2:34:04.520]  a cost of living crisis
[2:34:04.520 --> 2:34:06.520]  all across Europe
[2:34:06.520 --> 2:34:08.520]  doesn't matter where all in for this
[2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:10.520]  where all in for the great reset
[2:34:10.520 --> 2:34:12.520]  because that was their agenda anyway
[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:14.520]  to lower your living standards
[2:34:14.520 --> 2:34:16.520]  more Ukraine military aid coming
[2:34:16.520 --> 2:34:18.520]  White House says
[2:34:18.520 --> 2:34:20.520]  US National Security Council spokesman
[2:34:20.520 --> 2:34:22.520]  John Kirby said Wednesday the Biden
[2:34:22.520 --> 2:34:24.520]  administration was preparing to announce
[2:34:24.520 --> 2:34:26.520]  more packages of military aid
[2:34:26.520 --> 2:34:28.520]  up to four civilian of course
[2:34:28.520 --> 2:34:30.520]  on the way
[2:34:30.520 --> 2:34:32.520]  we're being told here in the UK
[2:34:32.520 --> 2:34:34.520]  by the prime minister
[2:34:34.520 --> 2:34:36.520]  that it's all part of getting out
[2:34:36.520 --> 2:34:38.520]  of our dependency on Russian energy
[2:34:38.520 --> 2:34:40.520]  even though China
[2:34:40.520 --> 2:34:42.520]  is buying the gas from Russia
[2:34:42.520 --> 2:34:44.520]  and then selling it to European countries
[2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:46.520]  at exorbitant prices
[2:34:46.520 --> 2:34:48.520]  so we're still getting Russian gas
[2:34:48.520 --> 2:34:50.520]  we're just paying more money for it
[2:34:50.520 --> 2:34:52.520]  and it's coming through China
[2:34:52.520 --> 2:34:54.520]  it's a complete and utter scam
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:56.520]  Breitbart reports despite sanctions
[2:34:56.520 --> 2:34:58.520]  Russian state gas company
[2:34:58.520 --> 2:35:00.520]  post record profits
[2:35:00.520 --> 2:35:02.520]  that of course is gas from
[2:35:02.520 --> 2:35:04.520]  they posted a profit roughly
[2:35:04.520 --> 2:35:06.520]  equivalent to $41 billion
[2:35:06.520 --> 2:35:08.520]  that compares
[2:35:08.520 --> 2:35:10.520]  to their previous record profit
[2:35:10.520 --> 2:35:12.520]  which was around
[2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:14.520]  2 trillion rubles
[2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:16.520]  far lower
[2:35:16.520 --> 2:35:18.520]  than their new record profit
[2:35:18.520 --> 2:35:20.520]  because they're selling the gas to China
[2:35:20.520 --> 2:35:22.520]  they're selling it all over the world
[2:35:22.520 --> 2:35:24.520]  we're buying the gas from China
[2:35:24.520 --> 2:35:26.520]  we're the suckers while being told
[2:35:26.520 --> 2:35:28.520]  that we need to make sacrifices
[2:35:28.520 --> 2:35:30.520]  to become independent of Russian energy
[2:35:30.520 --> 2:35:32.520]  we're still getting Russian energy
[2:35:32.520 --> 2:35:34.520]  meanwhile in Colorado
[2:35:34.520 --> 2:35:36.520]  power company seizes control of thermostats
[2:35:36.520 --> 2:35:38.520]  during heat wave
[2:35:38.520 --> 2:35:40.520]  got a smart meter
[2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:42.520]  that means you're no longer in control
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:44.520]  of your own heating or air conditioning
[2:35:44.520 --> 2:35:46.520]  22,000 households in Colorado
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:48.520]  lost the ability
[2:35:48.520 --> 2:35:50.520]  to control their thermostats
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:35:52.520]  after the power company seized control
[2:35:52.520 --> 2:35:54.520]  of them during a heat wave
[2:35:54.520 --> 2:35:56.520]  basically what happened
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:35:58.520]  temperatures soared past 90 degrees
[2:35:58.520 --> 2:36:00.520]  people went to adjust their AC
[2:36:00.520 --> 2:36:02.520]  and they were met with a message
[2:36:02.520 --> 2:36:04.520]  which said energy emergency
[2:36:04.520 --> 2:36:06.520]  or maybe climate emergency
[2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:08.520]  oh but
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:10.520]  climate change lockdowns
[2:36:10.520 --> 2:36:12.520]  they're just a conspiracy theory aren't they
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:14.520]  even though India's literally doing them
[2:36:14.520 --> 2:36:16.520]  has been doing them for years
[2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:18.520]  so they were told there was an energy emergency
[2:36:18.520 --> 2:36:20.520]  and they were restricted from altering
[2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:22.520]  the temperature inside
[2:36:22.520 --> 2:36:24.520]  their own homes because of the smart meters
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:26.520]  again we've seen Spain
[2:36:26.520 --> 2:36:28.520]  Italy
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:30.520]  Germany, France
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:32.520]  all literally impose rules, laws
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:34.520]  backed by threats of onerous
[2:36:34.520 --> 2:36:36.520]  fines up to 600,000 euros
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:38.520]  for businesses, shops
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:40.520]  bars, cafes, restaurants
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:42.520]  in Spain for example
[2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:44.520]  right now at the height of summer
[2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:46.520]  it's still you know
[2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:48.520]  way in the 90s in that region
[2:36:48.520 --> 2:36:50.520]  they can't put their AC
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:52.520]  below 80 Fahrenheit
[2:36:52.520 --> 2:36:54.520]  27 degrees Celsius
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:56.520]  in European money
[2:36:56.520 --> 2:36:58.520]  as a rule
[2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:00.520]  as a mandate passed by the government
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:02.520]  they face onerous fines
[2:37:02.520 --> 2:37:04.520]  if they break that regulation
[2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:06.520]  meanwhile Germans could go vegan
[2:37:06.520 --> 2:37:08.520]  should go vegan to save environment
[2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:10.520]  propose a green party
[2:37:10.520 --> 2:37:12.520]  now in control basically of the German government
[2:37:12.520 --> 2:37:14.520]  German Green Party minister calls
[2:37:14.520 --> 2:37:16.520]  for tax on meat
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:18.520]  notice that all these things that they wanted
[2:37:18.520 --> 2:37:20.520]  anyway, the energy
[2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:22.520]  dependency, the soaring
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:24.520]  electricity bills, the soaring gas
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:26.520]  bills, the not eating
[2:37:26.520 --> 2:37:28.520]  meat, all of that now comes into play
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:30.520]  based on
[2:37:30.520 --> 2:37:32.520]  the spooky boogeyman of Russia
[2:37:32.520 --> 2:37:34.520]  and Putin
[2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:36.520]  yet the agenda was already in place anyway
[2:37:36.520 --> 2:37:38.520]  the inflation was already rising
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:40.520]  before the invasion
[2:37:40.520 --> 2:37:42.520]  prices in UK stores saw to 17
[2:37:42.520 --> 2:37:44.520]  year high, that's the food inflation
[2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:46.520]  going crazy, driving inflation
[2:37:46.520 --> 2:37:48.520]  quarter of Brits will refuse
[2:37:48.520 --> 2:37:50.520]  to turn on heating this winter
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:52.520]  British pubs at risk
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:54.520]  of closure
[2:37:54.520 --> 2:37:56.520]  and in fact we've got a video on this now
[2:37:56.520 --> 2:37:58.520]  people don't realize how integral
[2:37:58.520 --> 2:38:00.520]  pubs are to basically
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:02.520]  English culture, English heritage
[2:38:02.520 --> 2:38:04.520]  now 75%
[2:38:04.520 --> 2:38:06.520]  of them, that's over
[2:38:06.520 --> 2:38:08.520]  30,000 pubs businesses
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:10.520]  in the United Kingdom face being
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:12.520]  terminated
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:14.520]  shut down for good as a result
[2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:16.520]  of this contrived cost
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:18.520]  of living current thing crisis
[2:38:18.520 --> 2:38:20.520]  is a video
[2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:22.520]  the end of the pub
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:24.520]  let's roll it
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:26.520]  another devastating side effect of the current thing crisis
[2:38:26.520 --> 2:38:28.520]  three quarters of pubs
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:30.520]  in the UK face permanent
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:32.520]  closure due to unaffordable
[2:38:32.520 --> 2:38:34.520]  energy bills 75%
[2:38:34.520 --> 2:38:36.520]  that's roughly 30,000
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:38.520]  pubs across the entire country
[2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:40.520]  tens of thousands of livelihoods ruined
[2:38:40.520 --> 2:38:42.520]  family businesses wrecked
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:44.520]  the heart ripped out of 30,000
[2:38:44.520 --> 2:38:46.520]  towns and villages up and down the country
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:48.520]  thanks to green energy
[2:38:48.520 --> 2:38:50.520]  and the current thing pubs and brewers
[2:38:50.520 --> 2:38:52.520]  face bill hikes of up to 300%
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:54.520]  Martin Robinson
[2:38:54.520 --> 2:38:56.520]  co-owner of Ye Olde Fighting
[2:38:56.520 --> 2:38:58.520]  Fox Pub in St Albans
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:00.520]  reputed to be the oldest pub in England
[2:39:00.520 --> 2:39:02.520]  told the Epoch Times that his gas and electric bills
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:04.520]  had increased from 1,800 a month
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:06.520]  to 5,500
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:08.520]  Robinson said the high energy price
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:10.520]  has almost made it pointless to open
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:12.520]  adding that another planned increase in October
[2:39:12.520 --> 2:39:14.520]  by 80% could wipe everyone out
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:16.520]  I think people don't realize how many places
[2:39:16.520 --> 2:39:18.520]  are about to close he said
[2:39:18.520 --> 2:39:20.520]  the British pub is not just a place to get drunk
[2:39:20.520 --> 2:39:22.520]  it's a community centre
[2:39:22.520 --> 2:39:24.520]  it's a refuge
[2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:26.520]  it's a friendly focal point
[2:39:26.520 --> 2:39:28.520]  it's a piece of heritage
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:30.520]  some pubs in Britain are over a thousand years old
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:32.520]  they survived Viking raids
[2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:34.520]  the Black Death and the Second World War
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:36.520]  but many of them won't survive
[2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:38.520]  the double whammy of lockdown
[2:39:38.520 --> 2:39:40.520]  and the current thing crisis
[2:39:40.520 --> 2:39:42.520]  the government says quote
[2:39:42.520 --> 2:39:44.520]  no national government can control the global
[2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:46.520]  factors pushing up the price of energy
[2:39:46.520 --> 2:39:48.520]  and other business costs
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:50.520]  I'll tell you what you can control
[2:39:50.520 --> 2:39:52.520]  sending nearly 2.5 billion pounds
[2:39:52.520 --> 2:39:54.520]  of taxpayer money to a foreign country
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:39:56.520]  1500 miles away
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:39:58.520]  to prolong a war
[2:39:58.520 --> 2:40:00.520]  while pensioners at home are going to be freezing
[2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:02.520]  to death this winter because they can't afford
[2:40:02.520 --> 2:40:04.520]  to put the heating on
[2:40:04.520 --> 2:40:06.520]  pursuing disastrous net zero
[2:40:06.520 --> 2:40:08.520]  climate change hysteria
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:10.520]  that will ensure energy bills remain high
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:12.520]  whatever happens in Ukraine
[2:40:12.520 --> 2:40:14.520]  caving to eco-mentalists
[2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:16.520]  by banning fracking which would have
[2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:18.520]  single-handedly saved us from all this
[2:40:18.520 --> 2:40:20.520]  you could have controlled all that couldn't you
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:22.520]  I want to hope all the upper middle class pretentious
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:24.520]  twats in the affluent areas
[2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:26.520]  are really pleased with themselves
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:28.520]  I hope that when they try to go for a Christmas
[2:40:28.520 --> 2:40:30.520]  drink at their local pub
[2:40:30.520 --> 2:40:32.520]  only to find it's being shut down
[2:40:32.520 --> 2:40:34.520]  forever hope they give themselves
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:36.520]  a nice pat on the back
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:38.520]  could at least you got to feel smug about yourselves
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:40.520]  by flying that little Ukraine flag in the back garden
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:42.520]  eh?
[2:40:42.520 --> 2:40:44.520]  I mentioned it before
[2:40:44.520 --> 2:40:46.520]  the article is here
[2:40:46.520 --> 2:40:48.520]  quarter of Brits will refuse to turn on
[2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:50.520]  heating this winter
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:52.520]  they've got this energy price cap
[2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:54.520]  which is going to rise in October pushing up bills
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:56.520]  by 80%
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:40:58.520]  that means the average yearly household bill
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:00.520]  will rise from £1,900
[2:41:00.520 --> 2:41:02.520]  and that's already a huge rise on earlier this year
[2:41:02.520 --> 2:41:04.520]  so that's about
[2:41:04.520 --> 2:41:06.520]  I don't know, $3,000
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:08.520]  to £3,500
[2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:10.520]  that's about $5,000
[2:41:10.520 --> 2:41:12.520]  that's just by October
[2:41:12.520 --> 2:41:14.520]  next year it's going to go to £6,500
[2:41:14.520 --> 2:41:16.520]  that's about
[2:41:16.520 --> 2:41:18.520]  $5,500
[2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:20.520]  per year
[2:41:20.520 --> 2:41:22.520]  on electricity and gas
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:24.520]  for heating which of course is going to push people
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:26.520]  into fuel poverty
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:28.520]  going to push people into basically civil unrest
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:30.520]  many observers are now saying
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:32.520]  then you've got this weird thing going on in the background
[2:41:32.520 --> 2:41:34.520]  where the movement for people
[2:41:34.520 --> 2:41:36.520]  to cancel their direct debits
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:38.520]  and to stop paying their electricity bills
[2:41:38.520 --> 2:41:40.520]  is being driven
[2:41:40.520 --> 2:41:42.520]  is being promulgated by
[2:41:42.520 --> 2:41:44.520]  weird shadowy NGO groups
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:46.520]  linked into the very great reset
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:48.520]  that this complements
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:50.520]  in the first place
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:52.520]  so it's kind of a contrived thing
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:54.520]  that you have these
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:41:56.520]  again shadowy NGO groups
[2:41:56.520 --> 2:41:58.520]  tied in with government, tied in with the WEF
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:00.520]  telling people
[2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:02.520]  to revolt, telling people
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:04.520]  not to pay their bills
[2:42:04.520 --> 2:42:06.520]  telling people to demand government
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:08.520]  give them massive payouts
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:10.520]  and as a telegraph columnist here
[2:42:10.520 --> 2:42:12.520]  Alistair Heathrow in the article
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:14.520]  getting people even more dependent
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:16.520]  on the government
[2:42:16.520 --> 2:42:18.520]  as a result of this contrived crisis
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:20.520]  he said mass immediate intervention is inevitable
[2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:22.520]  but must be designed to avoid
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:24.520]  hastening Britain's shift into demagoguery
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:26.520]  welfareism and socialist central planning
[2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:28.520]  all steps down
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:30.520]  Hayek's road to serfdom
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:32.520]  that the leftist and green elites
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:34.520]  are longing us to take
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:36.520]  so again they're getting people dependent
[2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:38.520]  on income from the state
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:40.520]  the government paying off their gas bills
[2:42:40.520 --> 2:42:42.520]  and of course at what cost
[2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:44.520]  well the cost of their freedom
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:46.520]  the cost of installing smart meters
[2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:48.520]  that spy on you in your own homes
[2:42:48.520 --> 2:42:50.520]  and then can be shut off remotely
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:52.520]  if there's an emergency
[2:42:52.520 --> 2:43:20.520]  we'll be back
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:22.520]  we'll be back
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:43:58.520]  several years ago
[2:43:58.520 --> 2:44:00.520]  I approached one of the top companies
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:02.520]  in the U.S. that supplies
[2:44:02.520 --> 2:44:04.520]  the highest quality signature reducing
[2:44:04.520 --> 2:44:06.520]  Faraday cages, the Pentagon
[2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:08.520]  and other U.S. government agencies
[2:44:08.520 --> 2:44:10.520]  and now they have produced specifically
[2:44:10.520 --> 2:44:12.520]  for us this made America
[2:44:12.520 --> 2:44:14.520]  onion line at a very
[2:44:14.520 --> 2:44:16.520]  affordable price
[2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:18.520]  whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone
[2:44:18.520 --> 2:44:20.520]  or big pouches that
[2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:22.520]  protect laptops and iPads
[2:44:22.520 --> 2:44:24.520]  or big bags that promote
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:26.520]  whatever electronics you want to put in
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:28.520]  like desktop computers
[2:44:28.520 --> 2:44:30.520]  it is all exclusively available

[2:44:32.520 --> 2:44:34.520]  under the Redux name
[2:44:34.520 --> 2:44:36.520]  Redux is info wars
[2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:38.520]  taking the highest quality products
[2:44:38.520 --> 2:44:40.520]  and bringing them directly to you
[2:44:40.520 --> 2:44:42.520]  at infowarstore.com
[2:44:42.520 --> 2:44:44.520]  in this insane world you are crazy

[2:44:46.520 --> 2:44:48.520]  identity theft, hackers, criminals
[2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:50.520]  corporations, governments
[2:44:50.520 --> 2:44:52.520]  this is one of the hottest items out there today
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:44:54.520]  that's exclusively available
[2:44:54.520 --> 2:44:56.520]  at infowarstore.com
[2:44:56.520 --> 2:44:58.520]  the globalists are fighting around the clock
[2:44:58.520 --> 2:45:00.520]  to destroy the family
[2:45:00.520 --> 2:45:02.520]  to destroy heterosexual relationships
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:04.520]  to annihilate our marriages
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:06.520]  and the studies are all clear
[2:45:06.520 --> 2:45:08.520]  the number one cause of
[2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:10.520]  marital splits is
[2:45:10.520 --> 2:45:12.520]  that there is problems in the bedroom
[2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:14.520]  and the number one issue men have
[2:45:14.520 --> 2:45:16.520]  is a reptile dysfunction
[2:45:16.520 --> 2:45:18.520]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:45:18.520 --> 2:45:20.520]  the left makes big jokes about this
[2:45:20.520 --> 2:45:22.520]  because they don't want people having lasting

[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:04.520]  it's alex jones
[2:47:08.520 --> 2:47:10.520]  you're listening to the summit.news
[2:47:10.520 --> 2:47:12.520]  radio hour
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:14.520]  with paul joseph watson
[2:47:18.520 --> 2:47:20.520]  a couple of videos I want to play
[2:47:20.520 --> 2:47:22.520]  here in the final segment
[2:47:22.520 --> 2:47:24.520]  I'm going to get onto the knotting hill
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:26.520]  a big celebration of diversity
[2:47:26.520 --> 2:47:28.520]  multiculturalism in London
[2:47:28.520 --> 2:47:30.520]  so as always didn't quite go to
[2:47:30.520 --> 2:47:32.520]  the narrative
[2:47:32.520 --> 2:47:34.520]  first though I want to get to this video
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:36.520]  which is about Lizzo
[2:47:36.520 --> 2:47:38.520]  the private jet flying award
[2:47:38.520 --> 2:47:40.520]  receiving superstar
[2:47:40.520 --> 2:47:42.520]  who got up on stage at the vmas
[2:47:42.520 --> 2:47:44.520]  this week or on sunday night
[2:47:44.520 --> 2:47:46.520]  and claimed yes
[2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:48.520]  that she is actually oppressed
[2:47:48.520 --> 2:47:50.520]  Lizzo claims she's oppressed
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:52.520]  here it is, here's the video
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:54.520]  plus plus
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:47:56.520]  plus sized singer Lizzo gave a speech
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:47:58.520]  at the vmas last night during which
[2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:00.520]  she claimed she was oppressed
[2:48:00.520 --> 2:48:02.520]  so remember when you're voting for your favourite artist
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:04.520]  vote to change some of these laws
[2:48:04.520 --> 2:48:06.520]  that are oppressing us
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:08.520]  what? laws that are oppressing us
[2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:10.520]  what laws the civil rights act
[2:48:10.520 --> 2:48:12.520]  was passed nearly 60 years ago
[2:48:12.520 --> 2:48:14.520]  what are you even talking about?
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:16.520]  oppressing us
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:18.520]  you're literally standing on a world stage
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:20.520]  with rapt media attention
[2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:22.520]  a needle made out of precious metal
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:24.520]  being adulated and worshipped
[2:48:24.520 --> 2:48:26.520]  by an audience of millions
[2:48:26.520 --> 2:48:28.520]  oh my god so oppressed
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:30.520]  you literally arrived there in a private jet
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:32.520]  you live in a house worth 26 million dollars
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:34.520]  it's a hard not life isn't it?
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:36.520]  oppressing us
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:38.520]  Lizzo spent the rest of her speech
[2:48:38.520 --> 2:48:40.520]  screaming incoherently about her haters
[2:48:40.520 --> 2:48:42.520]  while claiming she wasn't bothered by them
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:44.520]  it's explaining us
[2:48:44.520 --> 2:48:46.520]  there's no people bitch
[2:48:46.520 --> 2:48:48.520]  there's a wider point here though
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:50.520]  why is this person given so much attention
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:52.520]  by the malevolent forces
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:54.520]  that control popular culture
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:56.520]  lest we forget earlier this year
[2:48:56.520 --> 2:48:58.520]  she literally celebrated gaining more weight
[2:48:58.520 --> 2:49:00.520]  I'm not trying to be mean
[2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:02.520]  people struggle with drug addiction
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:04.520]  they struggle with alcoholism
[2:49:04.520 --> 2:49:06.520]  they struggle with weight loss
[2:49:06.520 --> 2:49:08.520]  what do we tell drug addicts?
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:10.520]  here's 10 kilos of heroin
[2:49:10.520 --> 2:49:12.520]  and a lifetime supply of syringes
[2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:14.520]  what do we tell alcoholics?
[2:49:14.520 --> 2:49:16.520]  here's a giant crate of Jim Beam
[2:49:16.520 --> 2:49:18.520]  now of course we don't say that
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:20.520]  do we hand people who are trying to quit smoking
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:22.520]  an airport brick of Malbra Red
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:24.520]  no so why are we supposed
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:26.520]  to celebrate Lizzo's obesity
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:28.520]  why is it exalted by the culture
[2:49:28.520 --> 2:49:30.520]  as some kind of achievement?
[2:49:30.520 --> 2:49:32.520]  obesity now kills more people worldwide
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:34.520]  than car crashes
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:36.520]  it shouldn't be being glorified by Lizzo
[2:49:36.520 --> 2:49:38.520]  or anyone else don't tell her that though
[2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:40.520]  she'll probably claim she's being oppressed again
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:42.520]  oppressing us
[2:49:42.520 --> 2:49:44.520]  now let's get to these
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:46.520]  final stories
[2:49:46.520 --> 2:49:48.520]  we have another transgender
[2:49:48.520 --> 2:49:50.520]  athlete who is trying to hang out
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:52.520]  with a bunch of teenage girls
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:54.520]  completely normal of course
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:56.520]  31 year old transgender footballer celebrates
[2:49:56.520 --> 2:49:58.520]  being able to use same changing room
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:00.520]  as team of teenage girls
[2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:02.520]  this is a 31 year old
[2:50:02.520 --> 2:50:04.520]  biological male
[2:50:04.520 --> 2:50:06.520]  in the Netherlands
[2:50:06.520 --> 2:50:08.520]  male to female transgender
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:10.520]  who actually got given a passport
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:12.520]  by the Dutch government
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:14.520]  and he is now a woman
[2:50:14.520 --> 2:50:16.520]  a report by Dutch news outlet
[2:50:16.520 --> 2:50:18.520]  VRPO reveals the struggles
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:20.520]  that margeline shepherds
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:22.520]  underwent trying to comply with rules set by
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:24.520]  the Royal Football Association
[2:50:24.520 --> 2:50:26.520]  now in its infinite bigotry
[2:50:26.520 --> 2:50:28.520]  the Royal Football Association
[2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:30.520]  in the Netherlands said
[2:50:30.520 --> 2:50:32.520]  you're a 31 year old man
[2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:34.520]  what the hell are you doing
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:36.520]  trying to compete
[2:50:36.520 --> 2:50:38.520]  against a bunch of 15 year old girls
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:40.520]  at soccer
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:42.520]  that's bigoted and transphobic
[2:50:42.520 --> 2:50:44.520]  so after initially encountering those
[2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:46.520]  difficulties with his hometown team
[2:50:46.520 --> 2:50:48.520]  shepherds travelled 200km
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:50.520]  to join up with a team of teenage girls
[2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:52.520]  in Lyssa with him proclaiming it
[2:50:52.520 --> 2:50:54.520]  to be the best time of his life
[2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:56.520]  yeah I bet it was
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:50:58.520]  he said I was finally accepted by my
[2:50:58.520 --> 2:51:00.520]  teammates I joined in
[2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:02.520]  he added that the ability to use the same
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:04.520]  dressing room as the young girls
[2:51:04.520 --> 2:51:06.520]  was quote the best gift I could get
[2:51:06.520 --> 2:51:08.520]  because now he's officially
[2:51:08.520 --> 2:51:10.520]  a woman of course
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:12.520]  basically then
[2:51:12.520 --> 2:51:14.520]  they've now come back and said no
[2:51:14.520 --> 2:51:16.520]  it's not about you identifying as a woman
[2:51:16.520 --> 2:51:18.520]  it's the fact that you're a grown man
[2:51:18.520 --> 2:51:20.520]  with a 31 year old body
[2:51:20.520 --> 2:51:22.520]  competing against
[2:51:22.520 --> 2:51:24.520]  15 year old girls you clearly
[2:51:24.520 --> 2:51:26.520]  no matter what hormones you're taking
[2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:28.520]  have a physical
[2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:30.520]  advantage
[2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:32.520]  and again as we previously highlighted
[2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:34.520]  similar case with a biological male in his 30s
[2:51:34.520 --> 2:51:36.520]  who identified as a transgender woman
[2:51:36.520 --> 2:51:38.520]  was allowed to
[2:51:38.520 --> 2:51:40.520]  compete in Gaelic soccer
[2:51:40.520 --> 2:51:42.520]  in a final against 16 year old girls
[2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:44.520]  and then whenever anyone
[2:51:44.520 --> 2:51:46.520]  complained about it on twitter
[2:51:46.520 --> 2:51:48.520]  they had their account banned so yes
[2:51:48.520 --> 2:51:50.520]  that is the modern state of
[2:51:50.520 --> 2:51:52.520]  women's rights 30 year old
[2:51:52.520 --> 2:51:54.520]  men competing against
[2:51:54.520 --> 2:51:56.520]  15 and 16 year old girls
[2:51:56.520 --> 2:51:58.520]  winning because they now identify
[2:51:58.520 --> 2:52:00.520]  as women let's talk about
[2:52:00.520 --> 2:52:02.520]  the Notting Hill Carnival though
[2:52:02.520 --> 2:52:04.520]  we have a video on this I'm going to
[2:52:04.520 --> 2:52:06.520]  come back after and talk about it because again
[2:52:06.520 --> 2:52:08.520]  this carnival was cancelled
[2:52:08.520 --> 2:52:10.520]  for a couple of years because of the pandemic
[2:52:10.520 --> 2:52:12.520]  I'm surprised that even happened
[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:14.520]  that was probably racist
[2:52:14.520 --> 2:52:16.520]  now we had it returning
[2:52:16.520 --> 2:52:18.520]  with a vengeance in 2022
[2:52:18.520 --> 2:52:20.520]  the Notting Hill Carnival
[2:52:20.520 --> 2:52:22.520]  let's go to the video first and I'll come back
[2:52:22.520 --> 2:52:24.520]  and tell you the crime stats
[2:52:24.520 --> 2:52:26.520]  that emerged out of this celebration
[2:52:26.520 --> 2:52:28.520]  of diversity
[2:52:28.520 --> 2:52:30.520]  and multiculturalism here's the video
[2:52:30.520 --> 2:52:32.520]  there's still this archaic perception
[2:52:32.520 --> 2:52:34.520]  among some people mainly Americans
[2:52:34.520 --> 2:52:36.520]  that England is some quaint
[2:52:36.520 --> 2:52:38.520]  oasis of charm populated
[2:52:38.520 --> 2:52:40.520]  with polite sophisticated
[2:52:40.520 --> 2:52:42.520]  gentile people hmm let's take
[2:52:42.520 --> 2:52:44.520]  a look
[2:52:44.520 --> 2:52:56.520]  not in the major cities it is and
[2:53:08.520 --> 2:53:10.520]  welcome to London
[2:53:10.520 --> 2:53:12.520]  and more specifically the Notting Hill Carnival
[2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:14.520]  long celebrated
[2:53:14.520 --> 2:53:16.520]  as the best diversity has to offer
[2:53:16.520 --> 2:53:18.520]  if by best you mean hundreds
[2:53:18.520 --> 2:53:20.520]  of arrests dozens of sexual assaults
[2:53:20.520 --> 2:53:22.520]  scores of violent assaults
[2:53:22.520 --> 2:53:24.520]  looting theft vandalism
[2:53:24.520 --> 2:53:26.520]  and this year one fatal stabbing
[2:53:26.520 --> 2:53:28.520]  the murder investigation is underway
[2:53:28.520 --> 2:53:30.520]  after a man was stabbed to death at the Notting Hill Carnival
[2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:32.520]  several other stabbings
[2:53:32.520 --> 2:53:34.520]  and violent incidents were also reported
[2:53:34.520 --> 2:53:36.520]  this kind of carnage happens at Notting Hill Carnival
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:38.520]  every single year
[2:53:38.520 --> 2:53:40.520]  without fail there are countless
[2:53:40.520 --> 2:53:42.520]  violent videos on Twitter
[2:53:42.520 --> 2:53:44.520]  and I can't even play them here because this video
[2:53:44.520 --> 2:53:46.520]  would get banned if this were something like
[2:53:46.520 --> 2:53:48.520]  the FA Cup final or the Grand National
[2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:50.520]  and this kind of chaos erupted
[2:53:50.520 --> 2:53:52.520]  every year the spectators
[2:53:52.520 --> 2:53:54.520]  would be banned from attending
[2:53:54.520 --> 2:53:56.520]  but we're just supposed to ignore
[2:53:56.520 --> 2:53:58.520]  the annual Notting Hill Carnival
[2:53:58.520 --> 2:54:00.520]  presumably because showering it with anything
[2:54:00.520 --> 2:54:02.520]  other than a fusive praise
[2:54:02.520 --> 2:54:04.520]  would be racist it's
[2:54:04.520 --> 2:54:06.520]  morosely humorous to observe how the media
[2:54:06.520 --> 2:54:08.520]  and the authorities despite the clear
[2:54:08.520 --> 2:54:10.520]  orgy of violence and criminality
[2:54:10.520 --> 2:54:12.520]  on show
[2:54:12.520 --> 2:54:14.520]  desperately tries to spin it because how dare
[2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:16.520]  anyone even suggest anything
[2:54:16.520 --> 2:54:18.520]  slightly negative about this
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:20.520]  homage to multiculturalism
[2:54:20.520 --> 2:54:22.520]  BBC News quoted someone from the Met Police
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:24.520]  as saying the carnival had been
[2:54:24.520 --> 2:54:26.520]  largely positive and good natured
[2:54:26.520 --> 2:54:28.520]  apart from all the arrests
[2:54:28.520 --> 2:54:30.520]  sexual assaults, violent attacks,
[2:54:30.520 --> 2:54:32.520]  stabbings it's the most flagrant
[2:54:32.520 --> 2:54:34.520]  180 since CNN called the George Floyd
[2:54:34.520 --> 2:54:36.520]  riots mostly peaceful
[2:54:36.520 --> 2:54:38.520]  demonstrations. Again, imagine if it was
[2:54:38.520 --> 2:54:40.520]  Liverpool vs Manchester United
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:42.520]  in the FA Cup final at Wembley
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:44.520]  imagine if the police had made over
[2:54:44.520 --> 2:54:46.520]  200 arrests in response
[2:54:46.520 --> 2:54:48.520]  to countless crimes, violent assaults
[2:54:48.520 --> 2:54:50.520]  and a Liverpool fan being stabbed
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:52.520]  to death. Would the media and the police
[2:54:52.520 --> 2:54:54.520]  describe that as a largely positive
[2:54:54.520 --> 2:54:56.520]  and good natured event?
[2:54:56.520 --> 2:54:58.520]  Of course not! There'd be national
[2:54:58.520 --> 2:55:00.520]  hand wringing, official investigations
[2:55:00.520 --> 2:55:02.520]  and mass supporter bans.
[2:55:02.520 --> 2:55:04.520]  The double standard really is quite
[2:55:04.520 --> 2:55:06.520]  remarkable when you think about it.
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:08.520]  I mean, what are they saying that black
[2:55:08.520 --> 2:55:10.520]  people shouldn't be expected to behave
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:12.520]  as well as white people?
[2:55:12.520 --> 2:55:14.520]  Talk about the bigotry of low expectations.
[2:55:16.520 --> 2:55:18.520]  Yeah, they're calling it a carnival
[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:20.520]  of carnage. London Mayor
[2:55:20.520 --> 2:55:22.520]  Sadiq Khan came out during this
[2:55:22.520 --> 2:55:24.520]  weekend of rampant criminality
[2:55:24.520 --> 2:55:26.520]  and said that the vibes at the
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:28.520]  Notting Hill Carnival were
[2:55:28.520 --> 2:55:30.520]  quote, immaculate. Let's take
[2:55:30.520 --> 2:55:32.520]  a look at the score sheet.
[2:55:32.520 --> 2:55:34.520]  74 police officers
[2:55:34.520 --> 2:55:36.520]  injured. Now imagine if this happened
[2:55:36.520 --> 2:55:38.520]  at any other event in England.
[2:55:38.520 --> 2:55:40.520]  It'd be cancelled, it'd be shut down.
[2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:42.520]  74 police officers
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:44.520]  injured. One female constable
[2:55:44.520 --> 2:55:46.520]  put in a headlock and sexually
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:48.520]  assaulted. Eight other
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:50.520]  recorded sexual assaults.
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:52.520]  Inerable acts of vandalism and theft.
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:54.520]  One murder, of course,
[2:55:54.520 --> 2:55:56.520]  one guy was stabbed part of this
[2:55:56.520 --> 2:55:58.520]  gang scene, this
[2:55:58.520 --> 2:56:00.520]  drill rap gang scene. He died.
[2:56:00.520 --> 2:56:02.520]  Six other stabbings.
[2:56:02.520 --> 2:56:04.520]  A record number of knives
[2:56:04.520 --> 2:56:06.520]  seized after 441
[2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:08.520]  stop-and-searchers. Of course
[2:56:08.520 --> 2:56:10.520]  Sadiq Khan tried to desperately
[2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:12.520]  limit the amount of stop-and-searchers
[2:56:12.520 --> 2:56:14.520]  on the streets of London. Knife crime
[2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:16.520]  exploded dramatically afterwards.
[2:56:16.520 --> 2:56:18.520]  209 total
[2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:20.520]  arrests at the Notting Hill
[2:56:20.520 --> 2:56:22.520]  Carnival. Again, if that was
[2:56:22.520 --> 2:56:24.520]  any other sporting or music
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:26.520]  festival, it would get
[2:56:26.520 --> 2:56:28.520]  shut down forever.
[2:56:28.520 --> 2:56:30.520]  Now, the actual police
[2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:32.520]  Federation chief came out afterwards
[2:56:32.520 --> 2:56:34.520]  and basically
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:36.520]  put his neck on the line and said
[2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:38.520]  it should be cancelled. They're calling for
[2:56:38.520 --> 2:56:40.520]  serious action to be taken.
[2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:42.520]  He said, for the last two years, my colleagues
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:44.520]  have spent the August Bank holiday
[2:56:44.520 --> 2:56:46.520]  because it was locked down and there wasn't
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:48.520]  a carnival taking place.
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:50.520]  Not being assaulted in large numbers,
[2:56:50.520 --> 2:56:52.520]  why not? Because the Notting Hill
[2:56:52.520 --> 2:56:54.520]  Carnival did not take place.
[2:56:54.520 --> 2:56:56.520]  He said, but today we're having to again
[2:56:56.520 --> 2:56:58.520]  face the fallout from policing the event.
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:57:00.520]  The tragedy is that someone has
[2:57:00.520 --> 2:57:02.520]  been killed. And again,
[2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:04.520]  in previous years, they've had
[2:57:04.520 --> 2:57:06.520]  300-400 arrests and yet
[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:08.520]  it still goes on, on a year
[2:57:08.520 --> 2:57:10.520]  to year basis. Again, supposed to be
[2:57:10.520 --> 2:57:12.520]  a celebration of different cultures
[2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:14.520]  coming together, diversity,
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:16.520]  multiculturalism.
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:18.520]  Every time it happens, there's
[2:57:18.520 --> 2:57:20.520]  mass sexual assault, mass
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:22.520]  stabbings, mass thefts,
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:24.520]  burglary, criminality across
[2:57:24.520 --> 2:57:26.520]  the board. But again, because
[2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:28.520]  it's predominantly black and brown people
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:30.520]  involved, no one's allowed to criticize
[2:57:30.520 --> 2:57:32.520]  it. You have to celebrate it as
[2:57:32.520 --> 2:57:34.520]  a glorious, beneficence,
[2:57:34.520 --> 2:57:36.520]  a glorious homage to multiculturalism
[2:57:36.520 --> 2:57:38.520]  and nothing will happen. It will go on.
[2:57:38.520 --> 2:57:40.520]  That's going to wrap it up for Summit News.
[2:57:40.520 --> 2:57:42.520]  Stay tuned though for the 4th hour
[2:57:42.520 --> 2:57:56.520]  coming right up. Keep it locked in.
[2:58:26.520 --> 2:58:28.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody
[2:58:28.520 --> 2:58:30.520]  should visit mfoldworkstore.com
[2:58:30.520 --> 2:58:32.520]  today and get Ultimate Fish Oil
[2:58:32.520 --> 2:58:34.520]  finally back at stock for

[2:58:36.520 --> 2:58:38.520]  fans and big supporters, you're going to love it.
[2:58:38.520 --> 2:58:40.520]  You already know how great it is. But for folks
[2:58:40.520 --> 2:58:42.520]  who don't have experience, experience
[2:58:42.520 --> 2:58:44.520]  Ultimate Fish Oil for yourself,
[2:58:44.520 --> 2:58:46.520]  try taking some before bedtime
[2:58:46.520 --> 2:58:48.520]  and see what happens with your dreams.
[2:58:48.520 --> 2:58:50.520]  People say Alex Jones is crazy. He's a
[2:58:50.520 --> 2:58:52.520]  conspiracy theory guy. He's a nutcase.
[2:58:52.520 --> 2:58:54.520]  He's got these rants and all that.
[2:58:54.520 --> 2:58:56.520]  What they miss
[2:58:56.520 --> 2:58:58.520]  is that this guy's ahead of the curve
[2:58:58.520 --> 2:59:00.520]  on so many different topics
[2:59:00.520 --> 2:59:02.520]  of signal, not noise.
[2:59:02.520 --> 2:59:04.520]  If you look at the signal
[2:59:04.520 --> 2:59:06.520]  and you compare that
[2:59:06.520 --> 2:59:08.520]  to PBS and NPR and BBC
[2:59:08.520 --> 2:59:10.520]  Jones put out there
[2:59:10.520 --> 2:59:12.520]  versus what your collective body has put out there
[2:59:12.520 --> 2:59:14.520]  and if you're
[2:59:14.520 --> 2:59:16.520]  a human being and just watching it
[2:59:16.520 --> 2:59:18.520]  and you say, well, Alex Jones is ahead of this.
[2:59:18.520 --> 2:59:20.520]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[2:59:20.520 --> 2:59:22.520]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[2:59:22.520 --> 2:59:24.520]  That is very rare. You've got to go back
[2:59:24.520 --> 2:59:26.520]  almost to the revolutionary generation
[2:59:26.520 --> 2:59:28.520]  and see that. In this new book
[2:59:28.520 --> 2:59:30.520]  I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me
[2:59:30.520 --> 2:59:32.520]  I read this thing. I go, this is it.
[2:59:32.520 --> 2:59:34.520]  This is no beetry.
[2:59:34.520 --> 2:59:36.520]  You're not going to be flipping pages.
[2:59:36.520 --> 2:59:38.520]  You're going to be underlining stuff.
[2:59:38.520 --> 2:59:40.520]  The Great Reset
[2:59:40.520 --> 2:59:42.520]  by Alex Jones.

[2:59:44.520 --> 2:59:46.520]  or infowarstore.com
[2:59:48.520 --> 2:59:50.520]  Leading a frontal assault
[2:59:50.520 --> 2:59:52.520]  on the lies of the New World Order
[2:59:52.520 --> 2:59:54.520]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:59:58.520 --> 3:00:00.520]  It's called the Great Reset.
[3:00:00.520 --> 3:00:02.520]  Tough guy.
[3:00:02.520 --> 3:00:04.520]  It's called the New World Order.
[3:00:04.520 --> 3:00:06.520]  It's wanting to squeeze the economy
[3:00:06.520 --> 3:00:08.520]  and make people poor so they can
[3:00:08.520 --> 3:00:10.520]  loan us fiat money to take control of our lives
[3:00:10.520 --> 3:00:12.520]  with a social credit score
[3:00:12.520 --> 3:00:14.520]  and a universal basic income. That's everything.
[3:00:14.520 --> 3:00:16.520]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[3:00:16.520 --> 3:00:18.520]  The whole world is going to be about
[3:00:18.520 --> 3:00:20.520]  surveillance and control
[3:00:20.520 --> 3:00:22.520]  and them manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[3:00:22.520 --> 3:00:24.520]  It's all being officially announced.
[3:00:24.520 --> 3:00:26.520]  We've got articles everywhere. Their press releases
[3:00:26.520 --> 3:00:28.520]  saying
[3:00:30.520 --> 3:00:32.520]  and the crew asked me during the break
[3:00:32.520 --> 3:00:34.520]  are you alright?
[3:00:34.520 --> 3:00:36.520]  Are you feeling okay?
[3:00:36.520 --> 3:00:38.520]  They're going to start
[3:00:38.520 --> 3:00:40.520]  a couple hundred million people.
[3:00:40.520 --> 3:00:42.520]  I'm pretty freaked out.
[3:00:42.520 --> 3:00:44.520]  This is real.
[3:00:44.520 --> 3:00:46.520]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:00.520]  They're dying right now.
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:02.520]  Ian, your freaking house is starting
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:04.520]  to bedding for God to help them
[3:01:04.520 --> 3:01:06.520]  and no one's coming because God
[3:01:06.520 --> 3:01:08.520]  tells us to get up and take action
[3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:10.520]  and then we don't do anything.
[3:01:10.520 --> 3:01:12.520]  And that paralyzes
[3:01:12.520 --> 3:01:14.520]  God.
[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:16.520]  Yeah, God can do it.
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:18.520]  God needs us to do it
[3:01:18.520 --> 3:01:20.520]  because that's not what we will.
[3:01:20.520 --> 3:01:22.520]  Once again, not for the first time
[3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:24.520]  what has seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory
[3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:26.520]  turned out to be the truth.
[3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:28.520]  Yeah, I'm upset. I'm really.
[3:01:28.520 --> 3:01:30.520]  What's wrong with you?
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:32.520]  I'm really freaked out.
[3:01:32.520 --> 3:01:34.520]  I'm really freaked out.
[3:01:34.520 --> 3:01:36.520]  I'm really freaked out, you see,
[3:01:36.520 --> 3:01:38.520]  because this is real.
[3:01:38.520 --> 3:01:40.520]  The supply chain being cut off.
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:42.520]  The energy grid being cut off is real.
[3:01:44.520 --> 3:01:46.520]  And we're going into a time
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:48.520]  now where we're not going to be on the air.
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:50.520]  I mean, if we don't back this off,
[3:01:50.520 --> 3:01:52.520]  if we don't get sane people to stop the globalist,
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:54.520]  I mean,
[3:01:54.520 --> 3:01:56.520]  we won't be here in six months.
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:01:58.520]  We won't be here in six months.
[3:02:06.520 --> 3:02:08.520]  Who is the most banned
[3:02:08.520 --> 3:02:10.520]  news network in the world?

[3:02:44.520 --> 3:02:46.520]  Jones
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:48.520]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:50.520]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:55.520]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:02:57.520]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[3:02:57.520 --> 3:03:00.520]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:03.520]  that control things and make all the important decisions.
[3:03:03.520 --> 3:03:04.520]  Forget the politicians.
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:06.520]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea
[3:03:06.520 --> 3:03:08.520]  that you have freedom of choice.
[3:03:08.520 --> 3:03:10.520]  You don't.
[3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:12.520]  You have no choice.
[3:03:12.520 --> 3:03:13.520]  You have owners.
[3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:15.520]  They own you.
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:17.520]  They own everything.
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:19.520]  They own all the important land.
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:21.520]  They own and control the corporations.
[3:03:21.520 --> 3:03:23.520]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate,
[3:03:23.520 --> 3:03:25.520]  the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:27.520]  They've got the judges in their back pockets.
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:29.520]  And they own all the big media companies.
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:31.520]  So they control just about all of the news and information
[3:03:31.520 --> 3:03:32.520]  you get to hear.
[3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:34.520]  They got you by the balls.
[3:03:34.520 --> 3:03:37.520]  They want obedient workers.
[3:03:37.520 --> 3:03:39.520]  Obedient workers.
[3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:41.520]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines
[3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:43.520]  and do the paperwork and just dumb enough
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:45.520]  to passively accept jobs with the lower pay,
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:47.520]  the longer hours to reduce benefits,
[3:03:47.520 --> 3:03:49.520]  the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension
[3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:51.520]  that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:54.520]  And now they're coming for your social security money
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:58.520]  so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:00.520]  It's a big club.
[3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:02.520]  And you ain't in it.
[3:04:02.520 --> 3:04:03.520]  You said recently, quote,
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:07.520]  when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[3:04:07.520 --> 3:04:08.520]  You better believe it.
[3:04:08.520 --> 3:04:10.520]  So what specifically did they do?
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:12.520]  If I ask them, if I need them,
[3:04:12.520 --> 3:04:14.520]  you know, most of the people on this stage,
[3:04:14.520 --> 3:04:16.520]  I've given to just so you understand.
[3:04:16.520 --> 3:04:17.520]  A lot of money.
[3:04:17.520 --> 3:04:20.520]  You and I are not in the big club.
[3:04:20.520 --> 3:04:23.520]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[3:04:23.520 --> 3:04:25.520]  It's called the American Dream
[3:04:25.520 --> 3:04:28.520]  because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[3:04:28.520 --> 3:04:30.520]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want.
[3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:32.520]  They don't want a population of citizens
[3:04:32.520 --> 3:04:33.520]  capable of critical thinking.
[3:04:33.520 --> 3:04:36.520]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people
[3:04:36.520 --> 3:04:37.520]  capable of critical thinking.
[3:04:37.520 --> 3:04:39.520]  And I think she didn't know.
[3:04:39.520 --> 3:04:40.520]  That doesn't help them.
[3:04:40.520 --> 3:04:42.520]  That's against their interest.
[3:04:42.520 --> 3:04:43.520]  That's right.
[3:04:43.520 --> 3:04:46.520]  On the front lines of the information war,
[3:04:46.520 --> 3:04:48.520]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:04:56.520 --> 3:04:58.520]  So many people over the years
[3:04:58.520 --> 3:05:01.520]  have walked up to me randomly on the street and said,
[3:05:01.520 --> 3:05:04.520]  super male vitality is incredible.
[3:05:04.520 --> 3:05:06.520]  Why does it work so well?
[3:05:06.520 --> 3:05:07.520]  And the answer is very simple.
[3:05:07.520 --> 3:05:09.520]  It takes from Chinese medicine
[3:05:09.520 --> 3:05:11.520]  and other ancient traditions
[3:05:11.520 --> 3:05:14.520]  known herbal compounds that boosts libido,
[3:05:14.520 --> 3:05:15.520]  stamina and energy,
[3:05:15.520 --> 3:05:18.520]  and it comes from cold pressed herbs.
[3:05:18.520 --> 3:05:22.520]  So they're not boiling or heating up the herbs
[3:05:22.520 --> 3:05:24.520]  that are known to have these natural effects.
[3:05:24.520 --> 3:05:26.520]  It's cold pressed.
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:29.520]  It's been sold out for eight months or more.
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:32.520]  It's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com
[3:05:32.520 --> 3:05:36.520]  for 25% off super male vitality.

[3:05:38.520 --> 3:05:40.520]  which is also 25% off.
[3:05:40.520 --> 3:05:42.520]  But if you get both these products together,
[3:05:42.520 --> 3:05:46.520]  they're 40% off in a combo at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:46.520 --> 3:05:49.520]  So X2 and super male vitality,
[3:05:49.520 --> 3:05:52.520]  40% off together or 25% off individually
[3:05:52.520 --> 3:05:54.520]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:54.520 --> 3:05:57.520]  It's amazing. Try it today.
[3:05:57.520 --> 3:06:00.520]  U.S. senators in both parties saying,
[3:06:00.520 --> 3:06:03.520]  we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first
[3:06:03.520 --> 3:06:05.520]  and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before.
[3:06:05.520 --> 3:06:08.520]  What do you think that makes the Russians do?
[3:06:08.520 --> 3:06:12.520]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[3:06:12.520 --> 3:06:14.520]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[3:06:14.520 --> 3:06:16.520]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces
[3:06:16.520 --> 3:06:18.520]  on maximum alert.
[3:06:18.520 --> 3:06:20.520]  Only one level above that on their death con,
[3:06:20.520 --> 3:06:23.520]  just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[3:06:23.520 --> 3:06:27.520]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news
[3:06:27.520 --> 3:06:30.520]  saying let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[3:06:30.520 --> 3:06:32.520]  Think of their interests.
[3:06:32.520 --> 3:06:35.520]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast
[3:06:35.520 --> 3:06:38.520]  with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:41.520]  within five minutes on average of being launched.
[3:06:41.520 --> 3:06:45.520]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5,
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:48.520]  land-launched systems that can also launch from ships
[3:06:48.520 --> 3:06:51.520]  that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[3:06:51.520 --> 3:06:54.520]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:57.520]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed system
[3:06:57.520 --> 3:06:59.520]  that we don't have.
[3:06:59.520 --> 3:07:01.520]  It's on record the U.S. has those systems.
[3:07:01.520 --> 3:07:04.520]  The point is it's called mutually assured destruction
[3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:06.520]  or mad for a reason
[3:07:06.520 --> 3:07:10.520]  because anyone that would violate the mad doctrine is insane.
[3:07:10.520 --> 3:07:13.520]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war,
[3:07:13.520 --> 3:07:15.520]  especially when Russia is not starting to fight with us,
[3:07:15.520 --> 3:07:17.520]  and especially after we just heard for years
[3:07:17.520 --> 3:07:20.520]  that everything happening in this country is run by Russia
[3:07:20.520 --> 3:07:22.520]  when that was all a giant lie.
[3:07:22.520 --> 3:07:24.520]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[3:07:24.520 --> 3:07:29.520]  All right, folks.
[3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:33.520]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Infowars show,
[3:07:33.520 --> 3:07:35.520]  the Alex Jones show here on Infowars.com.
[3:07:35.520 --> 3:07:36.520]  I'm Mike Adams.
[3:07:36.520 --> 3:07:38.520]  I'm going to be hosting this hour,
[3:07:38.520 --> 3:07:40.520]  and we've got an amazing guest coming up,
[3:07:40.520 --> 3:07:43.520]  Shiri Sapir at the bottom of this hour.
[3:07:43.520 --> 3:07:44.520]  She's from Arizona.
[3:07:44.520 --> 3:07:47.520]  She is with the Kerry Lake Campaign for Governor.
[3:07:47.520 --> 3:07:51.520]  And we're going to get into what's happening to the attempted
[3:07:51.520 --> 3:07:56.520]  perversion of children, the hypersexualization of children
[3:07:56.520 --> 3:07:59.520]  that's going on right now all across the country.
[3:07:59.520 --> 3:08:02.520]  And in Arizona, we have an amazing opportunity
[3:08:02.520 --> 3:08:06.520]  to push back against that and put parents in charge
[3:08:06.520 --> 3:08:09.520]  so that teachers don't turn into groomers
[3:08:09.520 --> 3:08:12.520]  that are capturing and indoctrinating our young children
[3:08:12.520 --> 3:08:13.520]  and perverting them.
[3:08:13.520 --> 3:08:16.520]  We're going to get to that roughly at the bottom of this hour.
[3:08:16.520 --> 3:08:17.520]  So stay tuned.
[3:08:17.520 --> 3:08:19.520]  But we've got some other breaking news today
[3:08:19.520 --> 3:08:21.520]  to share with you.
[3:08:21.520 --> 3:08:24.520]  And by the way, Infowars is tomorrow's news today.
[3:08:24.520 --> 3:08:25.520]  But check this out.
[3:08:25.520 --> 3:08:30.520]  This story, it was first sent to me by one of my physician friends.
[3:08:30.520 --> 3:08:33.520]  You're going to hear about RSV.
[3:08:33.520 --> 3:08:35.520]  This is a respiratory virus.
[3:08:35.520 --> 3:08:38.520]  An mRNA vaccine is being developed for RSV.
[3:08:38.520 --> 3:08:42.520]  And I want the producers to search for this article.
[3:08:42.520 --> 3:08:46.520]  Participants needed for RSV clinical trial.
[3:08:46.520 --> 3:08:49.520]  This is from the Newton Times Herald.
[3:08:49.520 --> 3:08:52.520]  Apparently, some companies are recruiting guinea pigs
[3:08:52.520 --> 3:08:55.520]  for this trial because they're trying to get ready
[3:08:55.520 --> 3:09:01.520]  to push a massive RSV mRNA annual vaccine for all Americans.
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:05.520]  And they're touting the number of elderly people
[3:09:05.520 --> 3:09:08.520]  who are infected with RSV, which in reality,
[3:09:08.520 --> 3:09:12.520]  it's a very, very small number of elderly people.
[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:16.520]  In reality, RSV affects mostly premature babies.
[3:09:16.520 --> 3:09:20.520]  But they're going to hype up the scare factor on this,
[3:09:20.520 --> 3:09:23.520]  trying to say that all Americans are infected
[3:09:23.520 --> 3:09:25.520]  or at risk of being infected.
[3:09:25.520 --> 3:09:28.520]  And they're going to push another mRNA vaccine on everybody.
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:32.520]  You've already seen talk of them combining the annual flu shot
[3:09:32.520 --> 3:09:34.520]  with the COVID mRNA vaccine.
[3:09:34.520 --> 3:09:36.520]  They want an annual shot.
[3:09:36.520 --> 3:09:37.520]  And that's just one.
[3:09:37.520 --> 3:09:40.520]  Now we're talking RSV mRNA.
[3:09:40.520 --> 3:09:44.520]  So that could be two annual shots with mRNA folks.
[3:09:44.520 --> 3:09:46.520]  Do I need to tell you the obvious?
[3:09:46.520 --> 3:09:48.520]  I think you get it if you're watching this.
[3:09:48.520 --> 3:09:52.520]  They're going to keep injecting people until they're dead.
[3:09:52.520 --> 3:09:56.520]  And it's just going to keep going on with every vaccine
[3:09:56.520 --> 3:09:57.520]  they can possibly find.
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:10:02.520]  Now, in other breaking news, this was on CNBC.com today.
[3:10:02.520 --> 3:10:03.520]  Shocking news.
[3:10:03.520 --> 3:10:07.520]  Amazon took all US solar rooftops offline last year
[3:10:07.520 --> 3:10:11.520]  after flurry of fires and electrical explosions.
[3:10:11.520 --> 3:10:15.520]  So it turns out that Amazon, in their attempts to go green,
[3:10:15.520 --> 3:10:19.520]  they have covered the rooftops of many of their fulfillment
[3:10:19.520 --> 3:10:23.520]  warehouses with, I don't know, millions of square feet
[3:10:23.520 --> 3:10:26.520]  of solar panels probably across all these buildings.
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:29.520]  And these solar panels and the electrical systems
[3:10:29.520 --> 3:10:32.520]  that are connecting them keep catching on fire.
[3:10:32.520 --> 3:10:34.520]  Where the fire department has to respond,
[3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:37.520]  between April 2020 and June 2021,
[3:10:37.520 --> 3:10:40.520]  solar panels atop Amazon fulfillment centers caught fire
[3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:45.520]  or experienced electrical explosions at least six different times.
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:48.520]  The rate of incidence is unacceptable.
[3:10:48.520 --> 3:10:51.520]  And above industry averages.
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:55.520]  One affected an 880,000 square foot warehouse.
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:10:59.520]  Some 220 solar panels and other equipment in the facility
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:02.520]  were damaged by a three alarm fire.
[3:11:02.520 --> 3:11:04.520]  And then it goes on to talk about other fires.
[3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:07.520]  At least four other Amazon fulfillment centers caught fire
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:10.520]  or experienced electrical explosions due to failures.
[3:11:10.520 --> 3:11:15.520]  So this shows that critical fire or arc flash events
[3:11:15.520 --> 3:11:18.520]  are now bringing down the solar infrastructure on top of
[3:11:18.520 --> 3:11:21.520]  Amazon buildings, begs the question, doesn't it?
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:25.520]  We're told that we should dismantle our fossil fuel
[3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:29.520]  infrastructure in America and all across western Europe as well.
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:32.520]  Good luck this coming winter to see how that goes for France
[3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:34.520]  and Germany and the UK and so on.
[3:11:34.520 --> 3:11:37.520]  But we're told solar panels are the future.
[3:11:37.520 --> 3:11:40.520]  We're told that fossil fuels are the past.
[3:11:40.520 --> 3:11:44.520]  California has banned the sale of new combustion engine vehicles
[3:11:44.520 --> 3:11:46.520]  beginning in just 13 years.
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:48.520]  And then they turn around and tell people,
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:51.520]  but please don't charge your electric vehicles
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:55.520]  between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. because the grid can't handle it.
[3:11:55.520 --> 3:12:01.520]  And barely a fraction of Californians even own an electric vehicle.
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:06.520]  What happens if some significant portion of the California population
[3:12:06.520 --> 3:12:09.520]  owns electric vehicles or buys them and then they all start
[3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:12.520]  plugging them in, folks, the grid is going down.
[3:12:12.520 --> 3:12:16.520]  I mean, it's about to go down today, right now.
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:19.520]  And we're finding out from Amazon that all the solar panels
[3:12:19.520 --> 3:12:22.520]  on the rooftops are setting their warehouses on fire.
[3:12:22.520 --> 3:12:24.520]  Are you starting to see the picture here, folks?
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:29.520]  This green energy economy is not ready for prime time.
[3:12:29.520 --> 3:12:32.520]  And I'm not opposed to green energy at all.
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:36.520]  I love the fact of if we could get free energy systems
[3:12:36.520 --> 3:12:38.520]  or low-cost energy systems.
[3:12:38.520 --> 3:12:39.520]  I mean, I had a guest on here.
[3:12:39.520 --> 3:12:41.520]  We talked about low-energy nuclear reactions.
[3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:44.520]  Leonard, it has zero emissions.
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:47.520]  And that's a solution for heating buildings and heating water
[3:12:47.520 --> 3:12:48.520]  and all kinds of things.
[3:12:48.520 --> 3:12:52.520]  I'm all in favor of new energy solutions,
[3:12:52.520 --> 3:12:56.520]  but let's not flip the switch until we're ready for that.
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:12:58.520]  You can't just turn off the power grid and tell people,
[3:12:58.520 --> 3:13:02.520]  hey, buy an electric car, and then you can't charge it.
[3:13:02.520 --> 3:13:04.520]  Are you government people?
[3:13:04.520 --> 3:13:05.520]  Are you psychopaths?
[3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:07.520]  What's wrong with you?
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:09.520]  No wonder everybody's fleeing California.
[3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:12.520]  Well, Amazon's finding out the same thing with their investments.
[3:13:12.520 --> 3:13:14.520]  All right, here's what's next.
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:15.520]  I want to talk about.
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:18.520]  Remember, we've got Shiri Sapir coming on at the bottom
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:19.520]  of this hour.
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:22.520]  So be sure to stand by for that.
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:25.520]  I did a story today on natural news
[3:13:25.520 --> 3:13:29.520]  about the engineered takedown of the infrastructure
[3:13:29.520 --> 3:13:31.520]  that keeps humanity alive.
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:34.520]  And that's what we're talking about here, the food takedown.
[3:13:34.520 --> 3:13:37.520]  You've seen all the fires of the production facilities.
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:39.520]  You've seen the shortage of fertilizer.
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:42.520]  You've seen the supply chain parts collapse
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:44.520]  for agricultural equipment.
[3:13:44.520 --> 3:13:47.520]  We're talking about the water system collapse.
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:49.520]  Look at Jackson, Mississippi.
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:53.520]  Their water system went down because it rained, folks.
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:56.520]  Didn't anybody in Mississippi think that, oh, it's going to rain
[3:13:56.520 --> 3:13:58.520]  someday in Jackson, Mississippi?
[3:13:58.520 --> 3:14:00.520]  Are you kidding me?
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:02.520]  There's water falling out of the sky,
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:05.520]  and they can't deliver water to the people in the pipes.
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:07.520]  It's because America's infrastructure is crumbling,
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:09.520]  but it's on purpose.
[3:14:09.520 --> 3:14:13.520]  In fact, the mayor of Jackson there, Lumumba,
[3:14:13.520 --> 3:14:18.520]  he said that it was due to, quote, decades of deferred maintenance.
[3:14:18.520 --> 3:14:20.520]  And it's not his fault.
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:22.520]  He hasn't been mayor for decades.
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:24.520]  He's just pointing out the obvious.
[3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:28.520]  If you don't maintain the infrastructure, it crumbles and collapses.
[3:14:28.520 --> 3:14:31.520]  And if you don't maintain it on purpose,
[3:14:31.520 --> 3:14:33.520]  then you get the collapse on purpose.
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:34.520]  That's what's happening in Jackson.
[3:14:34.520 --> 3:14:38.520]  180,000 people have no water coming out of the pipes there.
[3:14:38.520 --> 3:14:41.520]  And then the mainstream media mocks info boards
[3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:43.520]  for telling people to get water filters.
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:45.520]  Boy, there are 180,000 people in Jackson
[3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:47.520]  who wish they had water filters right now.
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:50.520]  I can assure you of that.
[3:14:50.520 --> 3:14:53.520]  But think about what this means.
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:14:55.520]  Every time it rains, you're not going to have water.
[3:14:55.520 --> 3:14:58.520]  I mean, how do we get into this backwards system?
[3:14:58.520 --> 3:15:02.520]  Now, America can send a billion dollars a week to Ukraine
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:04.520]  to make sure that their government runs
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:06.520]  and to protect their borders and make sure their infrastructure
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:10.520]  has something working while America's infrastructure crumbles.
[3:15:10.520 --> 3:15:14.520]  Where the water doesn't work and the electricity doesn't work in California.
[3:15:14.520 --> 3:15:18.520]  And the food supply is crumbling on purpose, of course.
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:21.520]  And then the Democrats say we need 50 million dollars
[3:15:21.520 --> 3:15:25.520]  to feed the illegal aliens that come into the United States
[3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:27.520]  while the American people go hungry and starve
[3:15:27.520 --> 3:15:29.520]  and are about to become homeless by the millions
[3:15:29.520 --> 3:15:33.520]  because, well, they can't afford to pay rent because of inflation.
[3:15:33.520 --> 3:15:36.520]  $2,000 a month is now average rent in America.
[3:15:36.520 --> 3:15:37.520]  That's average.
[3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:41.520]  3.8 million people are about to be evicted in the next couple of months.
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:43.520]  Mass homelessness across America.
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:45.520]  It's all on purpose, folks.
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:47.520]  Of course, you heard it here first on Infowars.com.
[3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:49.520]  Alex Jones has been mourning about this for years.
[3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:50.520]  As usual, he was right.
[3:15:50.520 --> 3:15:51.520]  Stay with us.
[3:15:51.520 --> 3:16:18.520]  We'll be right back with more news straight ahead.
[3:16:26.520 --> 3:16:30.520]  Just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[3:16:30.520 --> 3:16:34.520]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[3:16:34.520 --> 3:16:36.520]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[3:16:36.520 --> 3:16:38.520]  Folks, this is a joke.
[3:16:38.520 --> 3:16:39.520]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[3:16:39.520 --> 3:16:40.520]  It's 75% off.
[3:16:40.520 --> 3:16:42.520]  By the way, it works for me.
[3:16:42.520 --> 3:16:47.520]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[3:16:47.520 --> 3:16:49.520]  Quite well, I might add.
[3:16:49.520 --> 3:16:53.520]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[3:16:53.520 --> 3:16:55.520]  I go and see him quite often now.
[3:16:55.520 --> 3:16:57.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get this book,
[3:16:57.520 --> 3:17:00.520]  our funding problems will be over and it's starting to happen.
[3:17:00.520 --> 3:17:02.520]  That's why I said, yeah, go to Infowars.com.
[3:17:02.520 --> 3:17:04.520]  Get the book and start shipping in a couple of weeks.
[3:17:04.520 --> 3:17:06.520]  The great reset in the war for the world.
[3:17:06.520 --> 3:17:10.520]  But I said, go to Amazon because it's the number one book chart in the world.
[3:17:10.520 --> 3:17:14.520]  And if it goes to number one, not a political, not of history, not of US history,
[3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:18.520]  it's already number one over 40 categories like political science, you name it.
[3:17:18.520 --> 3:17:20.520]  40 plus categories is number one.
[3:17:20.520 --> 3:17:25.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll please of books in the world.
[3:17:25.520 --> 3:17:31.520]  The great reset in the war for the world is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[3:17:31.520 --> 3:17:35.520]  We are now number nine in the world.
[3:17:35.520 --> 3:17:36.520]  Woo!
[3:17:36.520 --> 3:17:37.520]  This is major.
[3:17:37.520 --> 3:17:38.520]  This is political.
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:40.520]  This could fund our war chest.
[3:17:40.520 --> 3:17:43.520]  Just go to Amazon.com, everybody, and buy 10 copies.
[3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:47.520]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order
[3:17:47.520 --> 3:17:49.520]  because you read this, you know their whole plan how to stop them.
[3:17:49.520 --> 3:17:51.520]  Get the great reset in the war for the world now.
[3:17:51.520 --> 3:17:52.520]  It's going to go to number one.
[3:17:52.520 --> 3:17:53.520]  What do you make of that?
[3:17:57.520 --> 3:18:02.520]  Sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain breakdowns.

[3:20:20.520 --> 3:20:21.520]  All right, Mike Adams here.
[3:20:21.520 --> 3:20:26.520]  We're going to continue talking about the collapse of the energy and food
[3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:29.520]  and even the healthcare infrastructure in America.
[3:20:29.520 --> 3:20:35.520]  This is a deliberate global collapse of the infrastructure that keeps humanity alive.
[3:20:35.520 --> 3:20:38.520]  And we were just talking about in the last segment, you know, Amazon,
[3:20:38.520 --> 3:20:42.520]  all the solar panels on the roof, they keep catching on fire in facilities.
[3:20:42.520 --> 3:20:45.520]  So Amazon had to turn off all the solar energy at one point.
[3:20:45.520 --> 3:20:47.520]  I think they eventually turned it back on.
[3:20:47.520 --> 3:20:54.520]  But think about all the installations of the wind turbines and solar panels.
[3:20:54.520 --> 3:20:57.520]  And then California is saying that by the year 2045,
[3:20:57.520 --> 3:21:01.520]  all retail electricity that's sold to people has to be, quote, zero emissions.
[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:05.520]  Folks, there is no such thing as zero emissions electricity.
[3:21:05.520 --> 3:21:06.520]  It does not exist.
[3:21:06.520 --> 3:21:09.520]  Even wind turbines, it ends up creating landfill
[3:21:09.520 --> 3:21:12.520]  because the wind turbine blades, which are made out of carbon fiber,
[3:21:12.520 --> 3:21:14.520]  they don't just dissolve.
[3:21:14.520 --> 3:21:16.520]  You got to bury them somewhere.
[3:21:16.520 --> 3:21:18.520]  And so that's landfill.
[3:21:18.520 --> 3:21:19.520]  And then what about the solar panels?
[3:21:19.520 --> 3:21:23.520]  There's going to be a massive waste, a landfill collection of old,
[3:21:23.520 --> 3:21:25.520]  used up solar panels.
[3:21:25.520 --> 3:21:29.520]  And what about all the lithium ion car batteries for your electric vehicles?
[3:21:29.520 --> 3:21:32.520]  Folks, have you seen the headlines out there?
[3:21:32.520 --> 3:21:35.520]  People buying a used electric vehicle and they take it in and say,
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:36.520]  it's not working.
[3:21:36.520 --> 3:21:37.520]  It's not holding the charge.
[3:21:37.520 --> 3:21:39.520]  I can only drive it down the driveway.
[3:21:39.520 --> 3:21:40.520]  What do I do?
[3:21:40.520 --> 3:21:42.520]  They say, oh, you need to upgrade the battery pack.
[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:43.520]  Oh, okay.
[3:21:43.520 --> 3:21:44.520]  Great.
[3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:47.520]  How much is the battery pack?
[3:21:47.520 --> 3:21:48.520]  $29,000.
[3:21:48.520 --> 3:21:49.520]  What?
[3:21:49.520 --> 3:21:51.520]  I didn't even pay that for the car.
[3:21:51.520 --> 3:21:52.520]  Yeah.
[3:21:52.520 --> 3:21:56.520]  The battery packs basically 30 grand for your car.
[3:21:56.520 --> 3:21:59.520]  All the people out there buying electric vehicles right now,
[3:21:59.520 --> 3:22:04.520]  do they realize they're going to have to spend another 30 grand or so
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:06.520]  about every three to five years?
[3:22:06.520 --> 3:22:11.520]  It's like, it would be cheaper to replace the entire diesel engine
[3:22:11.520 --> 3:22:13.520]  in a diesel pickup.
[3:22:13.520 --> 3:22:17.520]  I mean, way cheaper than to keep buying these battery packs, folks.
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:19.520]  And then if you have an electric vehicle,
[3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:21.520]  you're not allowed to charge it.
[3:22:21.520 --> 3:22:23.520]  And by the way, when they have smart meters in place everywhere,
[3:22:23.520 --> 3:22:25.520]  which is the case in many places,
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:29.520]  and then they decide that, oh, your social credit score isn't good enough
[3:22:29.520 --> 3:22:33.520]  for you to have the allowable kilowatt hours of electricity,
[3:22:33.520 --> 3:22:36.520]  because you tweeted something mean
[3:22:36.520 --> 3:22:40.520]  and you posted something against transgenderism on Facebook.
[3:22:40.520 --> 3:22:44.520]  So we've cut your electricity rationing score.
[3:22:44.520 --> 3:22:48.520]  Now, you're only allowed to charge your vehicle for 27 minutes.
[3:22:48.520 --> 3:22:51.520]  So you can't even drive it to the grocery store,
[3:22:51.520 --> 3:22:54.520]  not that you could use your credit card there anyway,
[3:22:54.520 --> 3:22:57.520]  because it would be a central bank digital currency system
[3:22:57.520 --> 3:22:59.520]  where they're surveilling your wallet and saying,
[3:22:59.520 --> 3:23:01.520]  oh, you're not allowed to buy food either,
[3:23:01.520 --> 3:23:03.520]  because you oppose the current regime.
[3:23:03.520 --> 3:23:07.520]  Yeah, there's the technocracy future that's coming for you right there.
[3:23:07.520 --> 3:23:08.520]  Keep all that in mind.
[3:23:08.520 --> 3:23:11.520]  I want to offer some solutions here in this segment.
[3:23:11.520 --> 3:23:14.520]  And then we're going to be joined by Shiri Sapir in the next segment,
[3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:16.520]  very fascinating interview coming up.
[3:23:16.520 --> 3:23:18.520]  But for this segment,
[3:23:18.520 --> 3:23:20.520]  here's something I've been urging everybody to do.
[3:23:20.520 --> 3:23:24.520]  And that is, I want you to think about this term off-grid,
[3:23:24.520 --> 3:23:29.520]  but I want you to apply it to everything that keeps you alive.
[3:23:29.520 --> 3:23:32.520]  You need an off-grid solution to food,
[3:23:32.520 --> 3:23:34.520]  obviously, you know, storeable food,
[3:23:34.520 --> 3:23:37.520]  grow some food, sprouting, hydroponics, whatever,
[3:23:37.520 --> 3:23:39.520]  local farmers markets,
[3:23:39.520 --> 3:23:42.520]  but you need an off-grid solution for energy.
[3:23:42.520 --> 3:23:45.520]  You need to have some kind of backup solar storage system,
[3:23:45.520 --> 3:23:47.520]  some solar panels just for emergencies,
[3:23:47.520 --> 3:23:50.520]  just to charge electronic devices and a laptop,
[3:23:50.520 --> 3:23:51.520]  if nothing else.
[3:23:51.520 --> 3:23:54.520]  You need off-grid communications,
[3:23:54.520 --> 3:23:56.520]  because what happens when the cell towers go down
[3:23:56.520 --> 3:23:58.520]  or your phone gets disconnected?
[3:23:58.520 --> 3:24:00.520]  You need off-grid shelter,
[3:24:00.520 --> 3:24:03.520]  which means really a home that you own
[3:24:03.520 --> 3:24:06.520]  that you can live in when the power grid stops functioning.
[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:09.520]  Can you survive without, you know, electric heat?
[3:24:09.520 --> 3:24:11.520]  Maybe do you have a wood-burning stove
[3:24:11.520 --> 3:24:13.520]  or some other means of heat?
[3:24:13.520 --> 3:24:14.520]  What about air conditioning?
[3:24:14.520 --> 3:24:16.520]  Can you survive without it?
[3:24:16.520 --> 3:24:18.520]  Can you open the windows and have some ventilation
[3:24:18.520 --> 3:24:20.520]  and still live there, or are you going to get cooked alive?
[3:24:20.520 --> 3:24:23.520]  Because today's homes are designed to be closed up
[3:24:23.520 --> 3:24:25.520]  and sealed up like ovens,
[3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:27.520]  instead of having, you know, ventilation
[3:24:27.520 --> 3:24:29.520]  the way they used to build them,
[3:24:29.520 --> 3:24:30.520]  especially in the American Southwest
[3:24:30.520 --> 3:24:32.520]  with the old Adobe home styles,
[3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:34.520]  which didn't need air conditioning
[3:24:34.520 --> 3:24:36.520]  because they were naturally cool with Adobe
[3:24:36.520 --> 3:24:39.520]  and Tapia and straw bale homes and all those kinds of things.
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:41.520]  Stone, all that.
[3:24:41.520 --> 3:24:44.520]  So off-grid solutions are the way to go.
[3:24:44.520 --> 3:24:46.520]  And I just saw during the commercial break
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:49.520]  Infowars has a website of some of their off-grid solutions
[3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:51.520]  that are some of their sponsors.
[3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:54.520]  So I'm obligated to tell you about that.
[3:24:54.520 --> 3:24:57.520]  Infowarsoffgrid.com is the website.
[3:24:57.520 --> 3:24:59.520]  I mean, I'm not technically obligated.
[3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:01.520]  I'm just saying that it's my responsibility
[3:25:01.520 --> 3:25:03.520]  to connect you with solutions.
[3:25:03.520 --> 3:25:05.520]  So check out that website to support Infowars.
[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:07.520]  Infowarsoffgrid.com.
[3:25:07.520 --> 3:25:10.520]  And then, of course, I had to bring this...
[3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:12.520]  What is this? Let me get the right side here.
[3:25:12.520 --> 3:25:14.520]  The silver coin here.
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:16.520]  Silver is off-grid money.
[3:25:16.520 --> 3:25:18.520]  And so is gold.
[3:25:18.520 --> 3:25:20.520]  Precious metals, that's off-grid money.
[3:25:20.520 --> 3:25:22.520]  And you could also argue in a sense
[3:25:22.520 --> 3:25:25.520]  that cryptocurrency is decentralized
[3:25:25.520 --> 3:25:27.520]  sort of off-grid money in the sense
[3:25:27.520 --> 3:25:29.520]  that it's not tied to central banks,
[3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:31.520]  although, of course, cryptocurrency requires
[3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:34.520]  a functioning power grid to be usable.
[3:25:34.520 --> 3:25:37.520]  But it's decentralized, so that's a big plus.
[3:25:37.520 --> 3:25:39.520]  But if you don't have off-grid money,
[3:25:39.520 --> 3:25:42.520]  off-grid food, off-grid maybe power,
[3:25:42.520 --> 3:25:45.520]  off-grid health solutions,
[3:25:45.520 --> 3:25:48.520]  like nutrition, some herbs, some tinctures,
[3:25:48.520 --> 3:25:51.520]  some knowledge, some antiseptics, some iodine,
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:53.520]  if you don't have off-grid solutions,
[3:25:53.520 --> 3:25:55.520]  then you're dependent on a hospital
[3:25:55.520 --> 3:25:57.520]  that will probably have no electricity.
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:00.520]  A hospital that's staffed by murderers
[3:26:00.520 --> 3:26:02.520]  who are called doctors
[3:26:02.520 --> 3:26:04.520]  who are pushing people onto ventilators
[3:26:04.520 --> 3:26:06.520]  and denying you treatment with ivermectin.
[3:26:06.520 --> 3:26:08.520]  Because they don't want to save lives.
[3:26:08.520 --> 3:26:10.520]  They want to destroy lives.
[3:26:10.520 --> 3:26:12.520]  And by the way, the NIH is now admitting
[3:26:12.520 --> 3:26:14.520]  that they are studying ivermectin
[3:26:14.520 --> 3:26:16.520]  as a possible treatment for COVID-19.
[3:26:16.520 --> 3:26:18.520]  Two years too late NIH after you killed,
[3:26:18.520 --> 3:26:21.520]  what, 600,000 plus Americans already?
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:23.520]  Good job.
[3:26:23.520 --> 3:26:25.520]  But off-grid is the way to go, folks.
[3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:28.520]  And I've done books about this,
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:32.520]  about how you got to go from a high-tech preparedness solution
[3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:34.520]  to a low-tech backup option,
[3:26:34.520 --> 3:26:38.520]  and then what I call a no-tech backup option.
[3:26:38.520 --> 3:26:41.520]  And no-tech means it works without electricity.
[3:26:41.520 --> 3:26:43.520]  It works without the grid.
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:45.520]  And the Europeans, especially, they're out there
[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:47.520]  buying firewood like crazy right now,
[3:26:47.520 --> 3:26:49.520]  trying to acquire wood-burning stoves
[3:26:49.520 --> 3:26:51.520]  or making their own out of steel barrels, you know?
[3:26:51.520 --> 3:26:54.520]  Figuring, what am I going to burn this winter like furniture?
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:26:56.520]  How about you go to Brussels
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:27:00.520]  and take all those giant stacks of regulations for the EU?
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:02.520]  Burn those, man. You could heat the whole country
[3:27:02.520 --> 3:27:05.520]  just by burning regulations across Europe.
[3:27:05.520 --> 3:27:07.520]  I mean, there's your solution right there.
[3:27:07.520 --> 3:27:11.520]  Or I say jokingly, set fire to your electric vehicle.
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:13.520]  Folks, that's a joke. Don't actually do that,
[3:27:13.520 --> 3:27:15.520]  because it's a very dangerous fire
[3:27:15.520 --> 3:27:17.520]  that the fire department can't even put out.
[3:27:17.520 --> 3:27:19.520]  But you've got to have solutions for all of this,
[3:27:19.520 --> 3:27:21.520]  or you're going to get stuck.
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:23.520]  You're going to end up freezing.
[3:27:23.520 --> 3:27:25.520]  You're going to end up collapsing in Germany right now.
[3:27:25.520 --> 3:27:28.520]  Here it is. The entire German economy
[3:27:28.520 --> 3:27:31.520]  is being plunged into the dark ages.
[3:27:31.520 --> 3:27:33.520]  Manufacturers, this was reported by Financial Times,
[3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:34.520]  I think, yesterday.
[3:27:34.520 --> 3:27:38.520]  Manufacturers in Germany are halting production today.
[3:27:38.520 --> 3:27:40.520]  This is in September, folks.
[3:27:40.520 --> 3:27:42.520]  They're halting production. Why?
[3:27:42.520 --> 3:27:44.520]  Because there's no energy.
[3:27:44.520 --> 3:27:46.520]  There's no electricity, because natural gas,
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:49.520]  coming through what I call the Doom Stream 1 pipeline,
[3:27:49.520 --> 3:27:50.520]  you know, Nord Stream 1.
[3:27:50.520 --> 3:27:53.520]  Russia shut it down for more maintenance.
[3:27:53.520 --> 3:27:56.520]  And even when it's on, it's only running at 20%,
[3:27:56.520 --> 3:28:00.520]  which is the ratio is 20% gas, 80% Doom.
[3:28:00.520 --> 3:28:02.520]  And I think Putin screams down the pipeline,
[3:28:02.520 --> 3:28:05.520]  hey, no charge for the Doom, you know, good luck.
[3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:08.520]  Germany is going to starve to death.
[3:28:08.520 --> 3:28:10.520]  We're talking about millions of people
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:14.520]  who will be homeless or freezing or starving, dying, jobless.
[3:28:14.520 --> 3:28:16.520]  German industry is shutting down,
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:18.520]  and all we hear from these people is,
[3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:20.520]  oh, we need more solar panels.
[3:28:20.520 --> 3:28:23.520]  Really, the ones that burn up all the time?
[3:28:23.520 --> 3:28:25.520]  That's your solution?
[3:28:25.520 --> 3:28:28.520]  You shut down the entire fossil fuel industry
[3:28:28.520 --> 3:28:30.520]  because you wanted to appease the insane rantings
[3:28:30.520 --> 3:28:34.520]  of a teenage girl that was lecturing you on economic policy,
[3:28:34.520 --> 3:28:36.520]  and you were dumb enough to follow that policy,
[3:28:36.520 --> 3:28:38.520]  now you're starving and freezing and you're jobless,
[3:28:38.520 --> 3:28:40.520]  and your industry is shut down.
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:42.520]  And then you complain?
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:45.520]  Folks, it's called cause and effect.
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:47.520]  They're getting what they put in place.
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:49.520]  It's unreal.
[3:28:49.520 --> 3:28:51.520]  We don't all make the same mistake.
[3:28:51.520 --> 3:29:20.520]  Right back after this break, stay with us.
[3:29:22.520 --> 3:29:24.520]  And thanks. I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[3:29:24.520 --> 3:29:25.520]  I'm going to wake up today.
[3:29:25.520 --> 3:29:27.520]  You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day
[3:29:27.520 --> 3:29:30.520]  trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[3:29:30.520 --> 3:29:32.520]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[3:29:32.520 --> 3:29:34.520]  I don't think that happens very often.
[3:29:34.520 --> 3:29:35.520]  It's never happened to me.
[3:29:35.520 --> 3:29:36.520]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[3:29:36.520 --> 3:29:37.520]  Tate, you're such a good guy.
[3:29:37.520 --> 3:29:39.520]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[3:29:39.520 --> 3:29:41.520]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that,
[3:29:41.520 --> 3:29:42.520]  and that was me.
[3:29:42.520 --> 3:29:43.520]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[3:29:43.520 --> 3:29:45.520]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[3:29:45.520 --> 3:29:46.520]  I want to take control of my health,
[3:29:46.520 --> 3:29:47.520]  and that's why you need to go to infowars.com,
[3:29:47.520 --> 3:29:50.520]  take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[3:29:50.520 --> 3:29:51.520]  Don't buy into the group thing.
[3:29:51.520 --> 3:29:52.520]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[3:29:52.520 --> 3:29:53.520]  Drink the Turbo Force.
[3:29:53.520 --> 3:29:55.520]  Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[3:29:55.520 --> 3:29:57.520]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet,
[3:29:57.520 --> 3:29:59.520]  especially as you get older, you gain weight,
[3:29:59.520 --> 3:30:01.520]  even if you eat a lot less.
[3:30:01.520 --> 3:30:02.520]  But I got to tell you,
[3:30:02.520 --> 3:30:06.520]  infowars is only about bringing you amazing products that really work.
[3:30:06.520 --> 3:30:08.520]  So we looked at the supplement market
[3:30:08.520 --> 3:30:10.520]  that we find a lot of our operations with,
[3:30:10.520 --> 3:30:11.520]  and we said,
[3:30:11.520 --> 3:30:16.520]  what are the best-selling, natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products
[3:30:16.520 --> 3:30:17.520]  that are out there?
[3:30:17.520 --> 3:30:19.520]  We went and looked at the top 10,
[3:30:19.520 --> 3:30:23.520]  and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[3:30:23.520 --> 3:30:27.520]  But with our new product from X7, Diet Force,
[3:30:27.520 --> 3:30:34.520]  we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences
[3:30:34.520 --> 3:30:36.520]  that's just two amazing things for your body.
[3:30:36.520 --> 3:30:38.520]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds,
[3:30:38.520 --> 3:30:40.520]  I'm just a little bit overweight, in the last three months,
[3:30:40.520 --> 3:30:44.520]  and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also Exercise.
[3:30:44.520 --> 3:30:47.520]  Well, now Diet Force is exclusively available right now

[3:30:59.520 --> 3:31:02.520]  is fat burners, is weight loss formulas.

[3:31:05.520 --> 3:31:09.520]  but most of them do it in a toxic way.
[3:31:09.520 --> 3:31:11.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research
[3:31:11.520 --> 3:31:16.520]  on the safest, healthiest ways to take your overall body's metabolic
[3:31:16.520 --> 3:31:21.520]  system and your metabolism and turn that clock back
[3:31:21.520 --> 3:31:25.520]  by turning up your metabolism.

[3:32:01.520 --> 3:32:04.520]  for your brain, for every part of your body.
[3:32:04.520 --> 3:32:07.520]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that
[3:32:07.520 --> 3:32:12.520]  it has natural psychotropic effects.
[3:32:12.520 --> 3:32:14.520]  It certainly does for me.
[3:32:14.520 --> 3:32:17.520]  When I take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed,
[3:32:17.520 --> 3:32:20.520]  my sleep, my dreams are amazing.

[3:32:22.520 --> 3:32:26.520]  linking it to amazing events in the brain.

[3:32:51.520 --> 3:32:53.520]  Thank you all for your support,
[3:32:53.520 --> 3:33:16.520]  and I'll see you in the next one.
[3:33:16.520 --> 3:33:23.520]  It's Mike Adams.
[3:33:23.520 --> 3:33:25.520]  All right, buckle up folks, we're going to go into the world of
[3:33:25.520 --> 3:33:29.520]  gender, bender, fantasy land, Alice in Wonderland territory
[3:33:29.520 --> 3:33:30.520]  here today.
[3:33:30.520 --> 3:33:32.520]  Oh my goodness, wait till you hear this.
[3:33:32.520 --> 3:33:34.520]  Just shortly, I'm going to set this up,
[3:33:34.520 --> 3:33:37.520]  but we're going to bring in Shiri Sapir,
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:42.520]  who is an advisor, she's working with the Kerry Lake campaign,
[3:33:42.520 --> 3:33:44.520]  Kerry Lake for Governor of Arizona.
[3:33:44.520 --> 3:33:47.520]  I'll bring her in a second, but let me kind of introduce this.
[3:33:47.520 --> 3:33:50.520]  Summit.News and Infowars has been carrying this story,
[3:33:50.520 --> 3:33:52.520]  I believe this morning, reports.
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:33:55.520]  California school district textbook claims there are eight
[3:33:55.520 --> 3:33:58.520]  genders, and of course you have to wonder why eight?
[3:33:58.520 --> 3:34:00.520]  Why not 70?
[3:34:00.520 --> 3:34:03.520]  Why stop at eight?
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:06.520]  In that story, it says that mother charges that kids are being
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:08.520]  exploited by very evil people.
[3:34:08.520 --> 3:34:12.520]  The book, this California school book that's in
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:15.520]  documenting children is saying there are different genders,
[3:34:15.520 --> 3:34:19.520]  including androgynous, bi-gender, cis-gender, gender fluid,
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:21.520]  gender non-conforming, and gender questioning.
[3:34:21.520 --> 3:34:24.520]  And I was thinking, well, we should put in gender bender from
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:25.520]  atrazine.
[3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:28.520]  Once again, Alex Jones was right about atrazine,
[3:34:28.520 --> 3:34:29.520]  being a chemical castrator.
[3:34:29.520 --> 3:34:33.520]  That's the number two most common herbicide used in America,
[3:34:33.520 --> 3:34:36.520]  by the way, right after glyphosate, in case you're curious.
[3:34:36.520 --> 3:34:40.520]  The book also lists sexual preferences as hetero, homo,
[3:34:40.520 --> 3:34:43.520]  and bisexual, as well as andro-sexual, polysexual,
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:46.520]  scolio-sexuals, I've never even heard,
[3:34:46.520 --> 3:34:50.520]  demisexual, pan-sexual, gyna-sexual, and asexual,
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:53.520]  like when I throw in a kind of sexual,
[3:34:53.520 --> 3:34:58.520]  sexually frustrated, auto-sexual, which is like when that
[3:34:58.520 --> 3:35:01.520]  crazy guy is trying to hump the tailpipe of your Volkswagen
[3:35:01.520 --> 3:35:03.520]  in the parking lot, hey, dude, get away from my car.
[3:35:03.520 --> 3:35:05.520]  I'm still making payments on that thing.
[3:35:05.520 --> 3:35:06.520]  I can't drive it around like that.
[3:35:06.520 --> 3:35:09.520]  But it's anything goes right now.
[3:35:09.520 --> 3:35:10.520]  It's insane.
[3:35:10.520 --> 3:35:12.520]  No, seriously, there are people like that.
[3:35:12.520 --> 3:35:13.520]  Just letting you know.
[3:35:13.520 --> 3:35:17.520]  But Shiri Sapir joins us now to give us her take,
[3:35:17.520 --> 3:35:20.520]  which may or may not coincide with all the stuff
[3:35:20.520 --> 3:35:23.520]  that I just said, but her take on what's going on
[3:35:23.520 --> 3:35:25.520]  with indoctrination of children in schools.
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:27.520]  Shiri, thank you for joining us today.
[3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:32.520]  It's great to have you on.
[3:35:32.520 --> 3:35:36.520]  Okay, now, I'm glad you're joining us here
[3:35:36.520 --> 3:35:39.520]  and letting the producers know I'm not hearing Shiri.
[3:35:39.520 --> 3:35:43.520]  So go ahead and plug her into the audio so I can hear her
[3:35:43.520 --> 3:35:46.520]  and give her a chance to speak there
[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:48.520]  in an actual conversation.
[3:35:48.520 --> 3:35:50.520]  But I appreciate her coming on.
[3:35:50.520 --> 3:35:52.520]  In the meantime, I'm going to mention something
[3:35:52.520 --> 3:35:53.520]  and just stand by Shiri.
[3:35:53.520 --> 3:35:54.520]  We'll get this sorted out.
[3:35:54.520 --> 3:35:57.520]  But I'm going to mention the fact that parents
[3:35:57.520 --> 3:36:00.520]  are now taking over school boards in Florida
[3:36:00.520 --> 3:36:02.520]  and other places all across the country
[3:36:02.520 --> 3:36:04.520]  because of this issue that we're talking about.
[3:36:04.520 --> 3:36:08.520]  The schools are hiring these groomers
[3:36:08.520 --> 3:36:10.520]  and the word is accurate.
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:14.520]  They're trying to groom children to indoctrinate them
[3:36:14.520 --> 3:36:18.520]  into these LGBT lifestyles while cutting parents
[3:36:18.520 --> 3:36:22.520]  out of the loop so that parents have no say whatsoever
[3:36:22.520 --> 3:36:24.520]  in the future of their own children.
[3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:27.520]  So again, here to comment about that is Shiri Sapir.
[3:36:27.520 --> 3:36:30.520]  Her website is S-A-P-I-R SapirA-Z.com.
[3:36:30.520 --> 3:36:32.520]  Sorry about that technical glitch, Shiri.
[3:36:32.520 --> 3:36:34.520]  Welcome to the show.
[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:36.520]  Hi, thank you so much for having me.
[3:36:36.520 --> 3:36:38.520]  It's great to have you on now.
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:42.520]  Tell us what you are concerned with there in Arizona
[3:36:42.520 --> 3:36:45.520]  and your involvement with the Kerry Lake campaign.
[3:36:45.520 --> 3:36:47.520]  What you're trying to achieve there
[3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:51.520]  in terms of parental rights and protecting children?
[3:36:51.520 --> 3:36:53.520]  Well, a couple of years ago,
[3:36:53.520 --> 3:36:56.520]  as we started seeing the COVID shutdowns
[3:36:56.520 --> 3:36:59.520]  and the schools really rejecting our children,
[3:36:59.520 --> 3:37:01.520]  I decided to run for superintendent of public instruction
[3:37:01.520 --> 3:37:03.520]  in the state of Arizona.
[3:37:03.520 --> 3:37:05.520]  He's sort of the secretary of education.
[3:37:05.520 --> 3:37:07.520]  I never thought about running for office.
[3:37:07.520 --> 3:37:10.520]  It was quite the ride for 17 months.
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:12.520]  I ran a great campaign.
[3:37:12.520 --> 3:37:14.520]  The primary was a couple of weeks ago.
[3:37:14.520 --> 3:37:16.520]  But I started running because, again,
[3:37:16.520 --> 3:37:18.520]  the shutdowns, the masks, the vaccines,
[3:37:18.520 --> 3:37:21.520]  and the critical race theory that we started to get
[3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:23.520]  more and more information about in the schools
[3:37:23.520 --> 3:37:25.520]  and being indoctrinated.
[3:37:25.520 --> 3:37:27.520]  But I got to tell you, the more I learned,
[3:37:27.520 --> 3:37:29.520]  the more I found that the sexualization
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:32.520]  and grooming of our children is in the forefront
[3:37:32.520 --> 3:37:36.520]  of the goals that these educational institutions,
[3:37:36.520 --> 3:37:38.520]  if you want to call them that,
[3:37:38.520 --> 3:37:41.520]  have right now for our children.
[3:37:41.520 --> 3:37:43.520]  There is nothing more important for them right now
[3:37:43.520 --> 3:37:47.520]  than to drive in this LGBTQ and gender ideology
[3:37:47.520 --> 3:37:50.520]  into the core of our children.
[3:37:50.520 --> 3:37:53.520]  And I was outraged as a mom of three young children.
[3:37:53.520 --> 3:37:57.520]  I was outraged as a human being in a decent society
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:00.520]  who listens to some of the speech that these teachers bring
[3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:03.520]  in front of our children, the books, the pornography,
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:05.520]  the survey, the data mining.
[3:38:05.520 --> 3:38:07.520]  It's just so vast.
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:09.520]  And it's so difficult to explain.
[3:38:09.520 --> 3:38:11.520]  Some people, it's really difficult for them to believe that.
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:15.520]  I mean, I ran all around Arizona to the littlest counties.
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:18.520]  Some people just can't believe this is really happening
[3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:20.520]  in our schools, but it is.
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:23.520]  And it's really a nationwide disease that we have.
[3:38:23.520 --> 3:38:25.520]  It's probably the whole Western world right now
[3:38:25.520 --> 3:38:27.520]  that is kind of infected with this issue,
[3:38:27.520 --> 3:38:29.520]  just like what you just talked about
[3:38:29.520 --> 3:38:32.520]  in your opening statement of this segment,
[3:38:32.520 --> 3:38:35.520]  this gender ideology and multiple different genders
[3:38:35.520 --> 3:38:38.520]  and all these things are really taking over
[3:38:38.520 --> 3:38:41.520]  every aspect of our lives, and we need to stop it.
[3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:43.520]  One of the big issues, Shiri, and again,
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:45.520]  thank you for your concern about this and your energy
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:47.520]  and your effort to work to empower parents
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:49.520]  and protect children.
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:51.520]  One of the big issues is that many children
[3:38:51.520 --> 3:38:54.520]  are being pushed into life-altering decisions
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:38:58.520]  that result in the surgical mutilation of their bodies,
[3:38:58.520 --> 3:39:01.520]  irreversible removal of reproductive organs.
[3:39:01.520 --> 3:39:03.520]  You can't change that.
[3:39:03.520 --> 3:39:05.520]  You can't bring back the parts that were taken away.
[3:39:05.520 --> 3:39:09.520]  And we're seeing the rising issue of transgenderism regret.
[3:39:09.520 --> 3:39:11.520]  So a lot of these, or some, I should say,
[3:39:11.520 --> 3:39:13.520]  and I think we're going to see larger numbers,
[3:39:13.520 --> 3:39:16.520]  some of these former children, as they move into adulthood,
[3:39:16.520 --> 3:39:18.520]  they're saying, whoa, wait a minute, what happened to me?
[3:39:18.520 --> 3:39:20.520]  I was groomed or I was brainwashed.
[3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:23.520]  Are you hearing more stories like that, Shiri?
[3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:26.520]  Oh, yes, and I encourage your listeners to go on
[3:39:26.520 --> 3:39:29.520]  and Google and look for the detransitioning youth.
[3:39:29.520 --> 3:39:33.520]  There are thousands of children around the country right now
[3:39:33.520 --> 3:39:35.520]  that share their horrific stories
[3:39:35.520 --> 3:39:38.520]  of what they've gone through physiologically,
[3:39:38.520 --> 3:39:42.520]  and it's hard to believe that parents and doctors take part
[3:39:42.520 --> 3:39:47.520]  in such life-altering and body-altering procedures.
[3:39:47.520 --> 3:39:49.520]  Thankfully, in Arizona, just this last session,
[3:39:49.520 --> 3:39:53.520]  we actually passed a law that bans transitioning
[3:39:53.520 --> 3:39:56.520]  of any kind of surgeries in minors,
[3:39:56.520 --> 3:39:59.520]  which is shocking to me that in the United States of America
[3:39:59.520 --> 3:40:03.520]  in 2022, we actually need to ban mutilation.
[3:40:03.520 --> 3:40:05.520]  I mean, think about this for a second.
[3:40:05.520 --> 3:40:07.520]  That's incredible.
[3:40:07.520 --> 3:40:09.520]  So, yeah, we got it in Arizona,
[3:40:09.520 --> 3:40:12.520]  but it's all over the rest of the country,
[3:40:12.520 --> 3:40:14.520]  and it's unbelievable.
[3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:17.520]  Yeah, I mean, what you just said, really,
[3:40:17.520 --> 3:40:19.520]  we have to drive that point home,
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:24.520]  that child mutilations are legal in most states in America,
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:28.520]  and that this is being done by the medical profession,
[3:40:28.520 --> 3:40:32.520]  the same medical profession that tells us trust the science,
[3:40:32.520 --> 3:40:36.520]  and then they abandon physiology in many medical schools.
[3:40:36.520 --> 3:40:39.520]  They rip out chapters of chromosomes and gender,
[3:40:39.520 --> 3:40:42.520]  and they replace it with this made-up stuff.
[3:40:42.520 --> 3:40:45.520]  And by the way, different states disagree
[3:40:45.520 --> 3:40:47.520]  on how many genders there are,
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:49.520]  so how can they tell us that this is even a fact
[3:40:49.520 --> 3:40:52.520]  when all their, quote, facts disagree with each other?
[3:40:52.520 --> 3:40:55.520]  They're just making it up as they go along.
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:40:57.520]  Yes, I would like to be a fly on the wall
[3:40:57.520 --> 3:40:59.520]  in this classroom of the teacher that teaches
[3:40:59.520 --> 3:41:02.520]  the first week of biology that has to do with gender,
[3:41:02.520 --> 3:41:05.520]  and I just want to hear what they tell these children,
[3:41:05.520 --> 3:41:08.520]  because I remember they told us there is the X chromosomes,
[3:41:08.520 --> 3:41:11.520]  X, X, X, Y, there's the conversation there in that classroom.
[3:41:11.520 --> 3:41:13.520]  What is going on right now in our schools?
[3:41:13.520 --> 3:41:16.520]  They want to be there and share it with the world
[3:41:16.520 --> 3:41:20.520]  so people understand the madness of that type of conversation
[3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:22.520]  that is taking place in front of our children,
[3:41:22.520 --> 3:41:24.520]  and they're young, they're super young,
[3:41:24.520 --> 3:41:27.520]  and people need to understand that, you know,
[3:41:27.520 --> 3:41:30.520]  our children are, they just want to be long, okay,
[3:41:30.520 --> 3:41:33.520]  and they are now incentivizing our children
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:36.520]  and kind of say, you know, your parents are, you know,
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:38.520]  they're conservative and they are outdated,
[3:41:38.520 --> 3:41:40.520]  they don't know what they're talking about,
[3:41:40.520 --> 3:41:42.520]  you can feel safe here with us,
[3:41:42.520 --> 3:41:44.520]  with the amount of information that is being brought
[3:41:44.520 --> 3:41:46.520]  in front of the children, and I have a bunch of books here,
[3:41:46.520 --> 3:41:49.520]  I'll be happy to share some of the information,
[3:41:49.520 --> 3:41:52.520]  some of the surveys, some of the questions that they're giving.
[3:41:52.520 --> 3:41:55.520]  I'll give you guys an example, because I really want people
[3:41:55.520 --> 3:41:57.520]  to start understanding the kind of questions
[3:41:57.520 --> 3:41:59.520]  that are coming in front of our children.
[3:41:59.520 --> 3:42:03.520]  This is from a survey here in Prescott, Arizona.
[3:42:03.520 --> 3:42:07.520]  One of the questions is to children aged 12,
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:10.520]  if you've never slept with a person of the same sex,
[3:42:10.520 --> 3:42:14.520]  is it possible that all you need is a good gay lesbian lover?
[3:42:14.520 --> 3:42:16.520]  At this proportion, the majority...
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:19.520]  How old are the children being asked this question?
[3:42:19.520 --> 3:42:23.520]  12 or 13 in a camp in Prescott, Arizona.
[3:42:23.520 --> 3:42:25.520]  Unreal.
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:29.520]  At this proportion, the majority of child molesters
[3:42:29.520 --> 3:42:31.520]  are heterosexuals, do you consider it safe
[3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:35.520]  to expose children to heterosexual teachers?
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:37.520]  Even with all the social support...
[3:42:37.520 --> 3:42:39.520]  I'm sorry to interrupt, we've got to go to break here,
[3:42:39.520 --> 3:42:41.520]  continue some of this. This is outrageous.
[3:42:41.520 --> 3:42:44.520]  This is shocking that our children are being exposed to this
[3:42:44.520 --> 3:42:46.520]  through the public school system.
[3:42:46.520 --> 3:42:48.520]  Stay with us here, folks. We're going to be right back after this break.
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:53.520]  More with Shiri Sapir on infowars.com, the Alex Jones Show.
[3:42:53.520 --> 3:42:55.520]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:55.520 --> 3:42:58.520]  Everybody knows that high-quality fish oil
[3:42:58.520 --> 3:43:01.520]  does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system,
[3:43:01.520 --> 3:43:04.520]  for your brain, for every part of your body.
[3:43:04.520 --> 3:43:07.520]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that
[3:43:07.520 --> 3:43:12.520]  it has natural psychotropic effects.
[3:43:12.520 --> 3:43:14.520]  It certainly does for me.
[3:43:14.520 --> 3:43:16.520]  When I take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed,
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:20.520]  my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[3:43:20.520 --> 3:43:22.520]  Now, there are actually some studies out there
[3:43:22.520 --> 3:43:25.520]  linking it to amazing events in the brain,
[3:43:25.520 --> 3:43:28.520]  but I want you to experience it yourself.
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:30.520]  We know it's good for your heart.
[3:43:30.520 --> 3:43:32.520]  We know it's good for your brain.
[3:43:32.520 --> 3:43:34.520]  We know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[3:43:34.520 --> 3:43:36.520]  and every other function in your body,
[3:43:36.520 --> 3:43:39.520]  but I want you to experience this high-grade fish oil,
[3:43:39.520 --> 3:43:42.520]  this ultimate fish oil at infowars.com
[3:43:42.520 --> 3:43:45.520]  and see what it does if you take it before bedtime.

[3:43:49.520 --> 3:43:51.520]  at infowars.com.
[3:43:51.520 --> 3:43:53.520]  Thank you all for your support.
[3:43:53.520 --> 3:43:55.520]  You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[3:43:55.520 --> 3:43:58.520]  Seven months ago, in December of 2021,
[3:43:58.520 --> 3:44:02.520]  we launched the first in the three-coin founding member series,
[3:44:02.520 --> 3:44:04.520]  George Washington slaying the dragon.
[3:44:04.520 --> 3:44:06.520]  Then, we launched the Tree of Liberty coin,
[3:44:06.520 --> 3:44:08.520]  and finally, the second amendment,
[3:44:08.520 --> 3:44:10.520]  come and take it, Molan Lobby coin.
[3:44:10.520 --> 3:44:16.520]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-coin series,
[3:44:16.520 --> 3:44:21.520]  exclusively right now at 1776coin.com.
[3:44:21.520 --> 3:44:24.520]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members
[3:44:24.520 --> 3:44:27.520]  for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[3:44:27.520 --> 3:44:30.520]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made
[3:44:30.520 --> 3:44:32.520]  of the sheepdog chasing the wolf
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:34.520]  and a personal message.
[3:44:34.520 --> 3:44:40.520]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776coin.com.
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:42.520]  This is history happening now.
[3:44:42.520 --> 3:44:45.520]  Infowars thanks for your support is changing the world,
[3:44:45.520 --> 3:44:49.520]  and this is the final 75 three-coin set
[3:44:49.520 --> 3:45:05.520]  exclusively available at 1776coin.com.

[3:45:55.520 --> 3:45:57.520]  We are now living in the void,
[3:45:57.520 --> 3:46:00.520]  sliding towards collapse in the strange space
[3:46:00.520 --> 3:46:03.520]  between what we've known and what's to come.
[3:46:03.520 --> 3:46:07.520]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is
[3:46:07.520 --> 3:46:09.520]  don't panic, stay calm,
[3:46:09.520 --> 3:46:12.520]  because now is the time that we must get our bearings
[3:46:12.520 --> 3:46:16.520]  and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[3:46:16.520 --> 3:46:19.520]  There is nothing stopping we, the people,
[3:46:19.520 --> 3:46:23.520]  from making our own rules and building our own society.
[3:46:23.520 --> 3:46:26.520]  All we got to do is survive the crash.
[3:46:26.520 --> 3:46:29.520]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[3:46:29.520 --> 3:46:33.520]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[3:46:33.520 --> 3:46:36.520]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now,
[3:46:36.520 --> 3:46:39.520]  including food, water, and survival gear,
[3:46:39.520 --> 3:46:42.520]  to keep us strong and at the ready.
[3:46:42.520 --> 3:46:46.520]  Go to preparetoday.com for the essentials,
[3:46:46.520 --> 3:46:50.520]  storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power,
[3:46:50.520 --> 3:47:14.520]  and more at preparetoday.com.
[3:47:14.520 --> 3:47:21.520]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show
[3:47:21.520 --> 3:47:26.520]  with Mike Adams.
[3:47:26.520 --> 3:47:28.520]  All right, we're going to continue here shortly
[3:47:28.520 --> 3:47:30.520]  with Sherry Sapir from Arizona,
[3:47:30.520 --> 3:47:34.520]  who is the chair of the Education Reform Coalition
[3:47:34.520 --> 3:47:37.520]  with Kerry Lake, who's running for governor of Arizona.
[3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:41.520]  Kerry Lake absolutely deserves your vote and your support.
[3:47:41.520 --> 3:47:43.520]  All of you listening in Arizona, real quick,
[3:47:43.520 --> 3:47:45.520]  I've got to bring this in.
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:49.520]  Freight Waves is now reporting that shippers' revenge
[3:47:49.520 --> 3:47:53.520]  is coming for truckload carriers.
[3:47:53.520 --> 3:47:56.520]  And they're saying that all these truckers
[3:47:56.520 --> 3:47:59.520]  who were not getting paid enough
[3:47:59.520 --> 3:48:01.520]  are going to start charging much higher rates
[3:48:01.520 --> 3:48:04.520]  to transport goods across America.
[3:48:04.520 --> 3:48:06.520]  Now, I just want to say for the record,
[3:48:06.520 --> 3:48:09.520]  I don't think shippers' revenge is the right term for this.
[3:48:09.520 --> 3:48:12.520]  I 100% support America's truckers.
[3:48:12.520 --> 3:48:14.520]  If you're a trucker listening to this,
[3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:16.520]  we'd love you guys and gals.
[3:48:16.520 --> 3:48:19.520]  Without you, America would fall.
[3:48:19.520 --> 3:48:21.520]  Nothing would get delivered.
[3:48:21.520 --> 3:48:23.520]  We believe you deserve to get paid
[3:48:23.520 --> 3:48:25.520]  for the hours away from home,
[3:48:25.520 --> 3:48:27.520]  the hours on the road, the long hours,
[3:48:27.520 --> 3:48:29.520]  the crazy drivers, all the truck stops
[3:48:29.520 --> 3:48:31.520]  by the state police on the highway patrol
[3:48:31.520 --> 3:48:33.520]  and all that nonsense that you have to endure.
[3:48:33.520 --> 3:48:36.520]  I think it's about time that you got paid
[3:48:36.520 --> 3:48:38.520]  for keeping America alive, frankly.
[3:48:38.520 --> 3:48:40.520]  So I am 100% pro trucker.
[3:48:40.520 --> 3:48:43.520]  It's not revenge. It's just making an honest living, folks.
[3:48:43.520 --> 3:48:45.520]  So anyway, but yeah, rates are going to go up.
[3:48:45.520 --> 3:48:47.520]  Everything's going to get more expensive
[3:48:47.520 --> 3:48:48.520]  all across the board.
[3:48:48.520 --> 3:48:50.520]  But continuing now with Shiri Sapir.
[3:48:50.520 --> 3:48:52.520]  Again, she's with the Education Reform Coalition
[3:48:52.520 --> 3:48:55.520]  with the upcoming, I hope the upcoming governor,
[3:48:55.520 --> 3:48:57.520]  Kerry Lake of Arizona.
[3:48:57.520 --> 3:49:00.520]  Yes, we can do better than Ducey and others.
[3:49:00.520 --> 3:49:01.520]  Shiri Sapir joins us.
[3:49:01.520 --> 3:49:05.520]  Her website is sapiraz.com.
[3:49:05.520 --> 3:49:07.520]  Shiri, thank you for continuing with us right now.
[3:49:07.520 --> 3:49:10.520]  Can you continue with some of the highlights from that
[3:49:10.520 --> 3:49:12.520]  insane list of some of the questions that children
[3:49:12.520 --> 3:49:15.520]  being asked in public schools?
[3:49:15.520 --> 3:49:16.520]  Sure.
[3:49:16.520 --> 3:49:18.520]  So a lot of the other questions that we're asking
[3:49:18.520 --> 3:49:22.520]  these young children was a disproportionate majority
[3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:25.520]  of child molesters are heterosexual.
[3:49:25.520 --> 3:49:27.520]  Do you consider it safe to expose children
[3:49:27.520 --> 3:49:30.520]  to heterosexual teachers so they're really making
[3:49:30.520 --> 3:49:34.520]  heterosexual or being heterosexual bad?
[3:49:34.520 --> 3:49:37.520]  Another question, which if you pay attention to this,
[3:49:37.520 --> 3:49:38.520]  this is just in one page.
[3:49:38.520 --> 3:49:41.520]  They really hit all the spots.
[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:43.520]  They encourage them.
[3:49:43.520 --> 3:49:45.520]  They promote underage sex.
[3:49:45.520 --> 3:49:47.520]  They say that heterosexual is bad.
[3:49:47.520 --> 3:49:50.520]  Then they go on to, even with all the social support
[3:49:50.520 --> 3:49:53.520]  marriage receives, the divorce rate is spiraling.
[3:49:53.520 --> 3:49:56.520]  Why are there so few stable relationships
[3:49:56.520 --> 3:49:58.520]  among heterosexuals?
[3:49:58.520 --> 3:50:01.520]  So they're breaking the family, the nuclear family,
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:03.520]  the sensitivity of marriage.
[3:50:03.520 --> 3:50:04.520]  And then they go on to that.
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:06.520]  They're not even mentioning it's gay and lesbian.
[3:50:06.520 --> 3:50:08.520]  It's LGBT couples that have the highest rates
[3:50:08.520 --> 3:50:12.520]  of mental illness and domestic violence and suicides.
[3:50:12.520 --> 3:50:14.520]  But of course they don't mention any of that, do they?
[3:50:14.520 --> 3:50:16.520]  Of course not.
[3:50:16.520 --> 3:50:19.520]  Nothing that they say here is necessarily factual.
[3:50:19.520 --> 3:50:21.520]  It's just confusing enough for the little child to believe
[3:50:21.520 --> 3:50:23.520]  because I remember when I was a kid,
[3:50:23.520 --> 3:50:25.520]  when a teacher brought something in front of me,
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:27.520]  I believed it.
[3:50:27.520 --> 3:50:29.520]  I believed that whatever text was in front of me,
[3:50:29.520 --> 3:50:32.520]  whatever book, whatever assignment was true.
[3:50:32.520 --> 3:50:35.520]  Why would our kids think differently right now?
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:38.520]  So that's why this is so dangerous.
[3:50:38.520 --> 3:50:40.520]  Let me ask you this, Sheri.
[3:50:40.520 --> 3:50:43.520]  Because time is limited here, if Carrie Lake wins the election
[3:50:43.520 --> 3:50:45.520]  and let us pray that she does, and again,
[3:50:45.520 --> 3:50:47.520]  she deserves everyone's support,
[3:50:47.520 --> 3:50:50.520]  what is she going to do or let's say,
[3:50:50.520 --> 3:50:53.520]  what would you advise her to do to empower parents
[3:50:53.520 --> 3:50:55.520]  and protect children in the state of Arizona
[3:50:55.520 --> 3:50:57.520]  once she's governor?
[3:50:57.520 --> 3:50:59.520]  Well, one good thing that just happened in Arizona
[3:50:59.520 --> 3:51:02.520]  is the expansion of empowerment scholarship accounts,
[3:51:02.520 --> 3:51:05.520]  which really Arizona is now leading the nation with school choice.
[3:51:05.520 --> 3:51:10.520]  I do believe that the only way for us to really manage
[3:51:10.520 --> 3:51:13.520]  this tremendous problem that we have on our hands
[3:51:13.520 --> 3:51:15.520]  is to bring school choice.
[3:51:15.520 --> 3:51:18.520]  Some competition will maybe make them act a little bit better
[3:51:18.520 --> 3:51:20.520]  in the district schools, and if not,
[3:51:20.520 --> 3:51:22.520]  at least the parents will have that option
[3:51:22.520 --> 3:51:24.520]  to take their children somewhere else.
[3:51:24.520 --> 3:51:27.520]  I pulled my kids out and put them in a private school.
[3:51:27.520 --> 3:51:29.520]  I will not put my children in that environment
[3:51:29.520 --> 3:51:32.520]  because I'm not trusting what may come in front of them,
[3:51:32.520 --> 3:51:34.520]  and that's a terrible place to be.
[3:51:34.520 --> 3:51:36.520]  This should not be the case at all,
[3:51:36.520 --> 3:51:38.520]  but laws are being violated,
[3:51:38.520 --> 3:51:42.520]  and there are actionable items that these people are doing
[3:51:42.520 --> 3:51:44.520]  and bringing in front of our kids
[3:51:44.520 --> 3:51:46.520]  that they're actionable under the law,
[3:51:46.520 --> 3:51:48.520]  and for some reason, nobody's interested
[3:51:48.520 --> 3:51:51.520]  in putting these people in jail, to me.
[3:51:51.520 --> 3:51:54.520]  And now there is plenty of statute,
[3:51:54.520 --> 3:51:58.520]  so we can work with the legislature to maybe, you know,
[3:51:58.520 --> 3:52:00.520]  tighten up some of these laws,
[3:52:00.520 --> 3:52:02.520]  but they're already on the books.
[3:52:02.520 --> 3:52:04.520]  Nobody is enforcing them.
[3:52:04.520 --> 3:52:08.520]  For some reason, once the child is in the brick and mortar building,
[3:52:08.520 --> 3:52:09.520]  everything goes.
[3:52:09.520 --> 3:52:11.520]  Some of the things that you would be charged with,
[3:52:11.520 --> 3:52:15.520]  if you were to give that to a child outside of that school building,
[3:52:15.520 --> 3:52:17.520]  you would be charged with class profiling
[3:52:17.520 --> 3:52:19.520]  according to Arizona law.
[3:52:19.520 --> 3:52:22.520]  You are able to do that inside the classroom. Why?
[3:52:22.520 --> 3:52:24.520]  That is extraordinary.
[3:52:24.520 --> 3:52:26.520]  What is your sense of the Arizona legislature
[3:52:26.520 --> 3:52:29.520]  and their level of support for protecting children
[3:52:29.520 --> 3:52:31.520]  also from groomers and indoctrination
[3:52:31.520 --> 3:52:33.520]  and brainwashing, hypersexualization,
[3:52:33.520 --> 3:52:37.520]  so that if Kerry Lake is a governor soon
[3:52:37.520 --> 3:52:39.520]  and then we have the Arizona legislature,
[3:52:39.520 --> 3:52:43.520]  which I think in many ways has been really exceptionally good, by the way,
[3:52:43.520 --> 3:52:48.520]  plus your, I'm sorry, the reform coalition,
[3:52:48.520 --> 3:52:52.520]  is that like a really wonderful combination of synergy
[3:52:52.520 --> 3:52:55.520]  that's gonna break through the nonsense
[3:52:55.520 --> 3:52:58.520]  and really help protect children from here forward?
[3:52:58.520 --> 3:53:03.520]  Yes, this is a multi-fold kind of a battle that we have.
[3:53:03.520 --> 3:53:05.520]  Number one, the governor does have a lot of power
[3:53:05.520 --> 3:53:07.520]  to put the right people in place,
[3:53:07.520 --> 3:53:10.520]  to appoint the right people to key positions.
[3:53:10.520 --> 3:53:13.520]  The legislature does have a lot of power to change laws,
[3:53:13.520 --> 3:53:15.520]  to put some teeth in some of the laws.
[3:53:15.520 --> 3:53:17.520]  We did pass some really good legislation,
[3:53:17.520 --> 3:53:20.520]  even though the Republican majority was pretty thin.
[3:53:20.520 --> 3:53:24.520]  We passed the banning of masks and vaccines,
[3:53:24.520 --> 3:53:31.520]  and 2495 was really banning any sexual explicit content
[3:53:31.520 --> 3:53:32.520]  in front of children.
[3:53:32.520 --> 3:53:33.520]  So we've done a lot of good things,
[3:53:33.520 --> 3:53:37.520]  banning male and girl sports, for instance.
[3:53:37.520 --> 3:53:38.520]  All of these things happened this last session,
[3:53:38.520 --> 3:53:42.520]  so the legislature has a lot of power to bring good things in.
[3:53:42.520 --> 3:53:45.520]  The problem I see that we need Kerry Lake,
[3:53:45.520 --> 3:53:47.520]  if she becomes the governor,
[3:53:47.520 --> 3:53:49.520]  and our next attorney general to do,
[3:53:49.520 --> 3:53:51.520]  is to enforce the law,
[3:53:51.520 --> 3:53:53.520]  to make sure that these people are held accountable.
[3:53:53.520 --> 3:53:55.520]  There is just not enough accountability
[3:53:55.520 --> 3:53:57.520]  in the public schools right now,
[3:53:57.520 --> 3:53:59.520]  and that is something that we have to bring about,
[3:53:59.520 --> 3:54:02.520]  because if we don't make example of some of these people,
[3:54:02.520 --> 3:54:04.520]  they're gonna continue to do what they're doing,
[3:54:04.520 --> 3:54:05.520]  and just so you understand,
[3:54:05.520 --> 3:54:09.520]  the district forced these teachers to ask for the pronouns
[3:54:09.520 --> 3:54:12.520]  of the child, or to declare their own.
[3:54:12.520 --> 3:54:14.520]  All their emails, signature of these teachers
[3:54:14.520 --> 3:54:17.520]  and administrators have a pronouns attached to them.
[3:54:17.520 --> 3:54:19.520]  What kind of world are we living in?
[3:54:19.520 --> 3:54:20.520]  Why is this important?
[3:54:20.520 --> 3:54:24.520]  Who is the AG candidate that you think
[3:54:24.520 --> 3:54:29.520]  is going to best enforce these laws and protect children?
[3:54:29.520 --> 3:54:31.520]  Well, the Republican Abe Hameded
[3:54:31.520 --> 3:54:34.520]  is going against a extreme radical liberal,
[3:54:34.520 --> 3:54:36.520]  so I'm really hoping he's gonna win,
[3:54:36.520 --> 3:54:39.520]  and he actually put me on his advisory as well.
[3:54:39.520 --> 3:54:42.520]  So I'm hoping that between all of these great leaders,
[3:54:42.520 --> 3:54:44.520]  I mean, leadership matters, there's no two ways about it.
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:46.520]  If we get the right people in place,
[3:54:46.520 --> 3:54:48.520]  and I tell people where we feel discouraged,
[3:54:48.520 --> 3:54:50.520]  and many of us do, because it's very overwhelming
[3:54:50.520 --> 3:54:53.520]  for families and parents to have to go through this.
[3:54:53.520 --> 3:54:56.520]  Some of the mothers I know are literally private investigators.
[3:54:56.520 --> 3:54:59.520]  They have to go through all these websites and information,
[3:54:59.520 --> 3:55:00.520]  and it's exhausting.
[3:55:00.520 --> 3:55:02.520]  We have life to live, we wanna work,
[3:55:02.520 --> 3:55:03.520]  we wanna go to church,
[3:55:03.520 --> 3:55:05.520]  we wanna be happy with our children,
[3:55:05.520 --> 3:55:07.520]  yet we need to go through all these.
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:11.520]  So if we have some key players that are pro-family
[3:55:11.520 --> 3:55:15.520]  and pro-children, I mean, it's really about children after all,
[3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:18.520]  I think we can get a lot of these lifted, heavy lifting done
[3:55:18.520 --> 3:55:20.520]  for the families of Arizona,
[3:55:20.520 --> 3:55:23.520]  and I can tell you the superintendent that we have right now in Arizona,
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:26.520]  Kathy Hoffman, she is the radical liberal.
[3:55:26.520 --> 3:55:27.520]  She actually has QChat,
[3:55:27.520 --> 3:55:30.520]  so she has in the Department of Education website in Arizona,
[3:55:30.520 --> 3:55:33.520]  you can go as a child, a minor,
[3:55:33.520 --> 3:55:36.520]  and go on QChat and speak to adults
[3:55:36.520 --> 3:55:38.520]  who are not even professionals of any kind,
[3:55:38.520 --> 3:55:44.520]  LGBTQ adults and talk to them about whatever situation you have in your life
[3:55:44.520 --> 3:55:46.520]  and you actually have an escape button on that chat
[3:55:46.520 --> 3:55:50.520]  if you want to escape quickly when your parent walks into the room.
[3:55:50.520 --> 3:55:52.520]  I saw that in the news, yeah, right.
[3:55:52.520 --> 3:55:58.520]  It's like a grooming chat board that's run with a way to hide it from parents.
[3:55:58.520 --> 3:55:59.520]  That's insane.
[3:55:59.520 --> 3:56:01.520]  But let me mention this.
[3:56:01.520 --> 3:56:03.520]  I love the fact that you're a mother
[3:56:03.520 --> 3:56:07.520]  and that you bring that passion as a woman and as a mother to this issue
[3:56:07.520 --> 3:56:09.520]  and Kerry Lake being a woman.
[3:56:09.520 --> 3:56:12.520]  I think you two working together on these issues,
[3:56:12.520 --> 3:56:15.520]  it's a powerful, passionate combination.
[3:56:15.520 --> 3:56:18.520]  Even feminism is under attack today
[3:56:18.520 --> 3:56:21.520]  by a lot of sectors of the LGBT movement.
[3:56:21.520 --> 3:56:23.520]  Somehow they don't like women anymore.
[3:56:23.520 --> 3:56:24.520]  I love the fact.
[3:56:24.520 --> 3:56:26.520]  I would love to see Kerry Lake as the governor
[3:56:26.520 --> 3:56:28.520]  and I would love to see you in there
[3:56:28.520 --> 3:56:31.520]  helping her get information and make these decisions about children
[3:56:31.520 --> 3:56:33.520]  because mothers have a special connection that frankly,
[3:56:33.520 --> 3:56:35.520]  it's different from what fathers have.
[3:56:35.520 --> 3:56:37.520]  It's different. What are your thoughts on women
[3:56:37.520 --> 3:56:39.520]  being involved in this issue?
[3:56:39.520 --> 3:56:41.520]  Absolutely.
[3:56:41.520 --> 3:56:43.520]  I'm not a birthing person.
[3:56:43.520 --> 3:56:45.520]  I don't care what the Democrats want to call me.
[3:56:45.520 --> 3:56:46.520]  I'm a mother.
[3:56:46.520 --> 3:56:50.520]  And the fact that all these women that fought for feminism,
[3:56:50.520 --> 3:56:53.520]  now they're okay with calling it breast milk
[3:56:53.520 --> 3:56:55.520]  or chest milk instead of breast milk
[3:56:55.520 --> 3:56:58.520]  and being a birthing person instead of breast milk.
[3:56:58.520 --> 3:57:00.520]  I mean, how do you pay with this?
[3:57:00.520 --> 3:57:02.520]  As a feminist, I'm asking,
[3:57:02.520 --> 3:57:05.520]  how are you, as a feminist, to have some men coming
[3:57:05.520 --> 3:57:09.520]  and competing with you in any kind of a contest?
[3:57:09.520 --> 3:57:13.520]  So the beauty about the Democrats and the liberals,
[3:57:13.520 --> 3:57:15.520]  it's not even the Democrats, it's the far left,
[3:57:15.520 --> 3:57:19.520]  is that they are so good at dictating narrative
[3:57:19.520 --> 3:57:21.520]  and we just kind of fall along.
[3:57:21.520 --> 3:57:23.520]  And it was okay for as long as it was us,
[3:57:23.520 --> 3:57:25.520]  you know, we could take it.
[3:57:25.520 --> 3:57:27.520]  They're coming after our children.
[3:57:27.520 --> 3:57:29.520]  We're out of time for this.
[3:57:29.520 --> 3:57:31.520]  I apologize. You were on a great role there.
[3:57:31.520 --> 3:57:33.520]  We're gonna have to have you back.
[3:57:33.520 --> 3:57:34.520]  We'll be in touch after this.
