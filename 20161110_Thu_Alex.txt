[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[00:14.000 --> 00:20.440]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[00:20.440 --> 00:25.000]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure,
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.320]  wanton, henchmen of totalitarianism.
[00:28.320 --> 00:34.240]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary
[00:34.240 --> 00:37.000]  Clinton's economic agenda.
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.200]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[00:40.200 --> 00:46.920]  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world, while the factories
[00:46.920 --> 00:51.400]  and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit.
[00:51.400 --> 00:56.440]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new
[00:56.440 --> 00:57.440]  dark age.
[00:57.440 --> 01:01.320]  That's what the U.N. Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[01:01.320 --> 01:08.920]  When we abandoned the policy of America first, we started rebuilding other countries instead
[01:08.920 --> 01:09.920]  of our own.
[01:09.920 --> 01:14.520]  Not a world Winston that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger, a world
[01:14.520 --> 01:19.520]  that gets uglier and stupider and more stunting.
[01:19.520 --> 01:24.320]  Government should allow Hillary Clinton to become president of the United States.
[01:24.320 --> 01:26.640]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:26.640 --> 01:27.640]  I voted for Hillary.
[01:27.640 --> 01:30.120]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[01:30.120 --> 01:32.280]  You want an image of the future Winston?
[01:32.280 --> 01:34.920]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:34.920 --> 01:41.360]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[01:41.360 --> 01:45.880]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all of these countries she took money against.
[01:45.880 --> 01:49.520]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[01:49.520 --> 01:51.040]  They're mistreated.
[01:51.040 --> 01:52.920]  She claims to be their champion.
[01:52.920 --> 01:56.440]  Look at me Winston and see the black circles around my eyes and see how ugly and weak I
[01:56.440 --> 02:01.000]  am expressing myself and dying and I torture people 18 hours a day and I have a horrible
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000]  life.
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.120]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity.
[02:06.120 --> 02:07.120]  We're here to hurt humans.
[02:07.120 --> 02:10.080]  We're here to suck your guts out.
[02:10.080 --> 02:37.440]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:37.440 --> 02:42.280]  In which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[02:42.280 --> 02:52.480]  Of the declared ones right now Donald Trump.
[02:52.480 --> 02:57.600]  Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States exclamation
[02:57.600 --> 03:02.600]  point at real Donald Trump.
[03:02.600 --> 03:19.480]  At least I will go down as a president.
[03:19.480 --> 03:21.160]  You're awake by the way.
[03:21.160 --> 03:23.000]  You're not having a terrible, terrible dream.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.040]  Also, you're not dead and you haven't gone to hell.
[03:26.040 --> 03:27.040]  This is your life now.
[03:27.040 --> 03:28.040]  This is our election now.
[03:28.040 --> 03:29.040]  This is us.
[03:29.040 --> 03:30.040]  This is our country.
[03:30.040 --> 03:31.040]  It's real.
[03:31.040 --> 03:39.400]  This is our country.
[03:39.400 --> 03:56.120]  Here's what I have to say real life.
[03:56.120 --> 03:59.380]  Oh man, I think it's up to my captain, come on.
[03:59.380 --> 04:00.380]  Oh!
[04:00.380 --> 04:01.380]  Oh!
[04:01.380 --> 04:02.380]  Oh!
[04:02.380 --> 04:03.380]  Oh!
[04:03.380 --> 04:04.380]  Oh!
[04:04.380 --> 04:05.380]  My goodness!
[04:05.380 --> 04:06.380]  That is a bitch!
[04:06.380 --> 04:07.380]  That's a bitch!
[04:07.380 --> 04:08.380]  That is a bitch, that is a bitch!
[04:08.380 --> 04:09.380]  What?
[04:09.380 --> 04:10.380]  What's your problem?
[04:10.380 --> 04:11.380]  That is a bitch!
[04:11.380 --> 04:12.380]  I mean, is this a bitch?
[04:12.380 --> 04:13.380]  What are you doing here?
[04:13.380 --> 04:14.380]  What's your problem?
[04:14.380 --> 04:15.380]  Is this a bitch?
[04:15.380 --> 04:16.380]  Are they arresting you?
[04:16.380 --> 04:17.380]  Ah!
[04:17.380 --> 04:18.380]  That's a bitch!
[04:18.380 --> 04:19.380]  No!
[04:19.380 --> 04:20.380]  Ah!
[04:20.380 --> 04:21.380]  Ah!
[04:21.380 --> 04:22.380]  He found the female edge pre-lux at Austin.
[04:22.380 --> 04:23.380]  They actually do that.
[04:23.380 --> 04:24.380]  Do you like it?
[04:24.380 --> 04:25.380]  Do you like it?
[04:25.380 --> 04:29.640]  B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B.
[04:29.640 --> 04:31.120]  God my President!
[04:31.120 --> 04:35.480]  We're a red hammer and sickle flag we wish we were in the North Korea Starling.
[04:35.480 --> 04:39.120]  Ah! Get out of the cell phones and all the money and jobs.
[04:39.120 --> 04:41.220]  We hate it, we're lazy.
[04:41.220 --> 04:43.980]  This is no little food, we owe it 400 pounds.
[04:43.980 --> 04:45.980]  That's that!
[04:45.980 --> 04:51.980]  We kicked my daddies and out, we're all girls, we're going to run things down.
[04:51.980 --> 04:54.980]  And our witch queen didn't help us.
[04:54.980 --> 04:58.980]  I'm so good.
[04:58.980 --> 04:59.980]  I'll be back.
[04:59.980 --> 05:08.980]  During CNN's election night coverage, former Obama adviser Van Jones argued that the 2016 election was a white lash against a change in country.
[05:08.980 --> 05:15.980]  In part, he said, not shocking CNN is still race-baiting, even though it's clearly over for them.
[05:15.980 --> 05:18.980]  The uphill battle Trump will face, however, is just beginning.
[05:18.980 --> 05:20.980]  Clinton supporters are staging civil unrest.
[05:20.980 --> 05:23.980]  We've seen this in parts of the country like Oregon and California,
[05:23.980 --> 05:30.980]  and more than 100 protesters gathered in Oakland, California this morning, attempting to block freeways, and at least one was hit by a car.
[05:30.980 --> 05:41.980]  Protesters were also seen in masks outside of Trump supporters' party in San Francisco, and Clinton supporters were filmed marching through Portland, Oregon, shouting expletive Donald Trump and setting fire to the U.S. flag.
[05:41.980 --> 05:46.980]  This news comes as death threats against Donald Trump flood social media.
[05:46.980 --> 05:53.980]  Well, can we count on the liberal media in this country to whine, refusing to accept Trump's victory as a hashtag, I'm still with her.
[05:53.980 --> 05:54.980]  Hey, accept it.
[05:54.980 --> 05:58.980]  In the spirit of tolerance, I'm Margaret Hill reporting for Infowars.com.
[05:58.980 --> 06:02.980]  You ever wonder what happened to America?
[06:02.980 --> 06:06.980]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[06:06.980 --> 06:08.980]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[06:08.980 --> 06:11.980]  I'm Charity Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[06:11.980 --> 06:17.980]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[06:17.980 --> 06:23.980]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[06:23.980 --> 06:29.980]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[06:29.980 --> 06:32.980]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[06:32.980 --> 06:33.980]  We're the solution.
[06:33.980 --> 06:36.980]  Americans ain't nothing more to it than that.
[06:36.980 --> 06:45.980]  Starring Alex Jones, Charity Daniels, and special ops general Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[06:45.980 --> 06:54.980]  More sheds and tears over the red, white, and blue. Revelation, the movie.info. Americans need to see this film.
[06:54.980 --> 06:58.980]  Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[06:58.980 --> 07:05.980]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[07:05.980 --> 07:08.980]  Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[07:08.980 --> 07:13.980]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[07:13.980 --> 07:19.980]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[07:19.980 --> 07:22.980]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[07:22.980 --> 07:24.980]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[07:24.980 --> 07:28.980]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[07:28.980 --> 07:33.980]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant.
[07:33.980 --> 07:36.980]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[07:36.980 --> 07:40.980]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[07:40.980 --> 07:46.980]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.
[07:46.980 --> 07:51.980]  InfoWarsLife.com and the product we make. We fight the globalists. We fight the new world order.

[08:11.980 --> 08:21.980]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting statewide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:21.980 --> 08:25.980]  To be clear, Tuesday night in the Wednesday morning, I did celebrate on there.
[08:25.980 --> 08:29.980]  And yesterday, after I had about two and a half hours of sleep, I did celebrate on there.
[08:29.980 --> 08:35.980]  But I said, look, just as night follows day, George Soros and the globalists are going to go into high gear
[08:35.980 --> 08:42.980]  and they're going to launch riots all over the country and they're going to intensify this racial division crap.
[08:42.980 --> 08:47.980]  And we need to really get on the offense about this and get very, very aggressive.
[08:47.980 --> 08:56.980]  Because it is outrageous how criminal this is to literally have the paid buses that come in with the white graduate student agitators.
[08:56.980 --> 09:01.980]  And it's true. They're all white, basically. We have it on video all over the United States.
[09:01.980 --> 09:06.980]  My crew has got it themselves in more than 15 cities. We've done whole pieces on it.
[09:06.980 --> 09:12.980]  And they're the ones saying deck the halls with dead cops. They're the ones saying, you know, all this crap.
[09:12.980 --> 09:21.980]  And you have professional government-funded, corporate-funded, university-funded agitators that are leading mobs of idiots.
[09:21.980 --> 09:26.980]  And it is absolutely seditious. This is not free speech.
[09:26.980 --> 09:34.980]  And I'm not saying shut down the general public's speech. I'm saying when you have paid agitators of multinational groups
[09:34.980 --> 09:40.980]  that have been banned in countries all over the world, the State Department got caught sending these people into Russia
[09:40.980 --> 09:49.980]  to try to overthrow Russia and they would have press conferences on C-SPAN and CNN and they would admit we're trying to overthrow Russia.
[09:49.980 --> 09:56.980]  I mean, no wonder Russia is upset with the United States. This is a multinational global system trying to overthrow us and trying to overthrow Russia.
[09:56.980 --> 10:05.980]  That's why there's this solidarity, folks. We're in World War 4. It's an economic, psychological warfare operation to understand something.
[10:05.980 --> 10:10.980]  This is not my opinion. This is from the textbooks, from the battle plans.
[10:10.980 --> 10:15.980]  I want to explain something to the leftists and their minions and all the rest of you, okay?
[10:15.980 --> 10:24.980]  And number one, you're not leftists. Number two, you are absolutely nothing but useful idiots, manipulated with a corporate template
[10:24.980 --> 10:33.980]  that's basically identical worldwide and that's used to destabilize countries and destroy a middle class so that people are permanently poor and stupid and under globalist control.
[10:33.980 --> 10:40.980]  This is their admitted plan under the Royal Commission in 1949. And everything after that is a regurgitation.
[10:40.980 --> 10:50.980]  Cloward and Piven, just all of this stuff where they admit we want you austere, we want you not having anything, so we can permanently control you.
[10:50.980 --> 10:58.980]  And Tragedy and Hope, Carol Quigley writes about this in a book, a secret book for the State Department and the CIA that was later published.
[10:58.980 --> 11:07.980]  None of this is my opinion. Now, the media is continuing to freak out saying, oh my God, the President of the United States follows Alex Jones' worldview.
[11:07.980 --> 11:17.980]  No, that's not what's happening. As much as I'd love to say that Donald Trump's getting his information from me, maybe 10% of it. He's not.
[11:17.980 --> 11:26.980]  He's getting it from top generals. He's getting it from top people in banking because folks, if you actually read globalist publications, they admit all this.
[11:26.980 --> 11:35.980]  They just put their spin on it that it's good. So the reason people are so frightened hearing Donald Trump like the mouth of Alex Jones is it's not.
[11:35.980 --> 11:45.980]  I'm the first person nationally to actually break all this down and roll out how it really works. This isn't my perspective on things.
[11:45.980 --> 11:56.980]  The globalists are selling this soft, stupid, race division, sex division, nanny state, political correctness, garbage.
[11:56.980 --> 12:08.980]  And they're selling a system of more student loans and more debt and more payday loan facilities and more rental centers and more permanent renter class.
[12:08.980 --> 12:15.980]  That's their admission. Huge screw jobs where you pay more for a 200 square foot apartment than you do for a thousand foot because the city passes a law.
[12:15.980 --> 12:24.980]  They've done it now. Eight different major cities, Austin's one of them, to rip you off, but they go, look, it's liberal. We just screwed you. Hardcore.
[12:24.980 --> 12:29.980]  You're like, thank you. It's trendy to live in a coffin and pay more than a thousand foot square.
[12:29.980 --> 12:34.980]  They have you paying more for a jail cell than a normal sized decent apartment.
[12:34.980 --> 12:39.980]  That's one microcosm. They are there to screw you to the wall.
[12:39.980 --> 12:47.980]  And in WikiLeaks, they're foaming at the mouth about how much they hate you and how stupid you are and how they want to make you poor and keep you in the dark.
[12:47.980 --> 12:55.980]  That fundamentally pisses Donald Trump off. It fundamentally pisses me off. So listen, I don't deserve the credit. Everybody's trying to give it to me right now.
[12:55.980 --> 13:01.980]  We have the credit for having energy and knowing humanity could win and turn the tide. And we're just beginning to do that.
[13:01.980 --> 13:07.980]  But you know who gets the credit? The people from the Renaissance 500 years ago.
[13:07.980 --> 13:21.980]  We are all just rediscovering the better parts of civilization. We're now discovering the real engine of growth and prosperity and independence and diversity and freedom and true liberalism.
[13:21.980 --> 13:32.980]  What we have been fighting is the counterfeit. So if you look at what Trump's doing, you look at what Trump's saying and what he's promoting, he's promoting 90% of the time he does some stuff I don't like.
[13:32.980 --> 13:40.980]  The Renaissance, the new enlightenment, freedom, free market, everything that made us great, innovation. That's what's happening.
[13:40.980 --> 13:54.980]  And they're selling this whole disease narrative and they're delusional all buying into this cult mentality in the major media, in the major corporations, in these major systems.
[13:54.980 --> 14:03.980]  That they really believe delusionally that they were invincible and they were unstoppable, but they don't even have a culture to push.
[14:03.980 --> 14:06.980]  Globalism doesn't want you to have any type of culture.
[14:06.980 --> 14:19.980]  Well, an empty culture of infighting and being alone and hating everyone and not having a family and not having a tribe, that's never going to sell up against the American system.
[14:19.980 --> 14:34.980]  And that's why for the last 240 plus years, it has been the main design of every major corporate imperial empire from the British East India Company to the British Empire itself and then modern inculcations,
[14:34.980 --> 14:49.980]  and the economic progeny of those systems to shut it down and create a worldwide monopoly control grid owned by less than six major combines.
[14:49.980 --> 14:53.980]  And that's what they admit they're building.
[14:53.980 --> 14:59.980]  And you have these poor little leftists who if you ask them, are you for TPP, if they know what it is, they'll say no.
[14:59.980 --> 15:01.980]  Well, Trump's against it too, but Hillary's for it.
[15:01.980 --> 15:03.980]  They're not living in the real world.
[15:03.980 --> 15:05.980]  They go to their university.
[15:05.980 --> 15:13.980]  They have the little change agent graduate student who's been handling them since the day they got off the bus with zits on their face and are scared at college.
[15:13.980 --> 15:16.980]  And they go, come on here into this area.
[15:16.980 --> 15:19.980]  You know, there's a lot of racist here and a lot of rape here and a lot of bad things.
[15:19.980 --> 15:21.980]  You need to be scared.
[15:21.980 --> 15:24.980]  You're literally being marched into a cult.
[15:24.980 --> 15:30.980]  And then they inflict you with mental illness.
[15:30.980 --> 15:39.980]  They inflict you with a chip on your shoulder and then you've got the arrogant, frat, you know, people that hate the frat next door to them and there's some racism going on there.
[15:39.980 --> 15:43.980]  And then the more you fight with them, the more they fight with you and then hate you.
[15:43.980 --> 15:46.980]  And now we've all been vulcanized like a big prison.
[15:46.980 --> 15:50.980]  Everybody put in their little areas and now we can all be manipulated and controlled.
[15:50.980 --> 15:56.980]  And that's where this whole thing is going.
[15:56.980 --> 16:04.980]  So if the mainstream media wants to know why they have 6% trust rates and that was before this of this election, it's because you have no credibility.
[16:04.980 --> 16:06.980]  Your polls are all fake.
[16:06.980 --> 16:07.980]  You got caught with your pants down.
[16:07.980 --> 16:10.980]  We've been proven right in spades.
[16:10.980 --> 16:15.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, I talked to folks across the local spectrum.
[16:15.980 --> 16:16.980]  I talked to heavy hitters.
[16:16.980 --> 16:18.980]  I was checking every day.
[16:18.980 --> 16:24.980]  Trump was ahead at the end of the RNC in July by almost 20 points in every major poll.
[16:24.980 --> 16:26.980]  The elite were crapping themselves.
[16:26.980 --> 16:28.980]  So they started adding 20, 30, 40 points.
[16:28.980 --> 16:31.980]  Remember to those polls to make Hillary look like she was ahead.
[16:31.980 --> 16:38.980]  That closed at some with the public because of the perception he was losing big, but only to about 10 points.
[16:38.980 --> 16:40.980]  Remember how many times I told you this hundreds of times?
[16:40.980 --> 16:48.980]  The New York Times and others made big jokes and go, Alex claims there's these internal polls and he always falls back on them.
[16:48.980 --> 16:53.980]  Yes, there were real polls done where they just didn't add 20% more Democrats and Trump was always winning.
[16:53.980 --> 16:55.980]  And now you see the exact numbers I told you.
[16:55.980 --> 16:57.980]  In fact, he would have won even bigger.
[16:57.980 --> 17:02.980]  He had a landslide sea change electoral win.
[17:02.980 --> 17:04.980]  He did not have that when it came to popular vote.
[17:04.980 --> 17:10.980]  But if you go into the states, we had Bev Harris, the big Democrat on yesterday, top elections expert.
[17:10.980 --> 17:13.980]  She said clearly they stole it from Trump in and then she listed.
[17:13.980 --> 17:14.980]  What was it?
[17:14.980 --> 17:21.980]  Five states because it would have been a hammer blow of biblical proportions.
[17:21.980 --> 17:28.980]  Probably the biggest landslide in this country's history if they wouldn't have stolen all those different counties.
[17:28.980 --> 17:31.980]  So ladies and gentlemen, that's what happened here.
[17:31.980 --> 17:39.980]  And we're sitting here on the verge of the globalist counter strike, which is going to be economic.
[17:39.980 --> 17:43.980]  I know he's there saying build the wall is going to meet the White House today and then meet with Republican leaders.
[17:43.980 --> 17:46.980]  We'll try to tell them to get in line.
[17:46.980 --> 17:55.980]  It's going to be a battle between the will of Donald J. Trump and these people and we have to be behind Trump in his constitutional agenda and support him.
[17:55.980 --> 17:57.980]  Because they're always going to put the narrative out.
[17:57.980 --> 17:58.980]  He can't control himself.
[17:58.980 --> 17:59.980]  He doesn't know what he's doing.
[17:59.980 --> 18:00.980]  Oh, it's his fault.
[18:00.980 --> 18:02.980]  The stock market fell on and on and on.
[18:02.980 --> 18:04.980]  Notice the stock market is actually up right now.
[18:04.980 --> 18:09.980]  And Wall Street, the general traders were chanting lock her up.
[18:09.980 --> 18:13.980]  We're going to play that after this break because the general Wall Street gets it.
[18:13.980 --> 18:19.980]  It's the big mega Wall Street, only four or five big firms that control most of the show.
[18:19.980 --> 18:29.980]  And they've been consolidating control over banking and over stocks and over everything else, making it harder for little guys and middle sized guys and even big guys who aren't part of the inside club to operate.
[18:29.980 --> 18:40.980]  So there's a lot of different revolutionary forces here that if you look at the globalist structure, we have a very good chance of turning this around.
[18:40.980 --> 18:50.980]  This is a total culture war, not the one they want to have where it's your black or your white or your Hispanic or your Asian, but a culture war over.
[18:50.980 --> 18:52.980]  Do you want lower taxes?
[18:52.980 --> 18:53.980]  Do you want more prosperity?
[18:53.980 --> 18:57.980]  Do you want the American system or do you want Venezuela or North Korea?
[18:57.980 --> 19:06.980]  Because historically, despite what your professors and change agents are telling you, this system never delivers to you.
[19:06.980 --> 19:09.980]  It only delivers to those that want a monopoly.
[19:09.980 --> 19:14.980]  We've got a bunch of clips I want to play today, a lot of guests coming on the broadcast as well.
[19:14.980 --> 19:17.980]  Such a historic time to obviously be alive.
[19:17.980 --> 19:26.980]  But it's painful to see not just the Van Jones Tuesday night coining the term, but now it's been picked up all over the networks that this was a white lash.
[19:26.980 --> 19:28.980]  Actually, I have the numbers right here.
[19:28.980 --> 19:32.980]  Trump did better than Romney among Hispanics and blacks massively.
[19:32.980 --> 19:45.980]  See, that's folks that actually ever got to hear him speak or who have real jobs and live in the real world and aren't just college students or Bernie Sanders supporters who aren't living in the real world.
[19:45.980 --> 19:54.980]  That's what they're scared of because if he can unify everybody and bring everybody into the Tea Party movement, it's game over for the globalist folks because this will spread worldwide.
[19:54.980 --> 19:58.980]  Again, America will become the leader of promoting true freedom.
[19:58.980 --> 20:02.980]  Charlie Daniels, he's always defended the Second Amendment.
[20:02.980 --> 20:05.980]  Let me just read a little thing here from agenda 21.
[20:05.980 --> 20:08.980]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[20:08.980 --> 20:10.980]  Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you?
[20:10.980 --> 20:12.980]  It's going to be coming after your guns.
[20:12.980 --> 20:15.980]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.
[20:15.980 --> 20:17.980]  Then beef was for supper.
[20:17.980 --> 20:21.980]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand.
[20:21.980 --> 20:23.980]  DVDs now available.
[20:23.980 --> 20:30.980]  Wash, shed some tears over the red, white and blue. Revelation, the movie.
[20:54.980 --> 21:06.980]  There is an affordable alternative to the high cost of health care that offers freedom from insurance while providing compliance with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[21:06.980 --> 21:12.980]  Imagine having access to quality affordable health care that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor and hospital.
[21:12.980 --> 21:18.980]  Members can share up to 100% of necessary medical expenses, including some alternative treatments.

[21:58.980 --> 22:12.980]  Think about this. Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pigments and antidepressants.
[22:12.980 --> 22:16.980]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[24:21.980 --> 24:33.980]  Then why did everybody want to move here and why was it such a game changer? Because the limited developments in freedom were light years ahead of what anybody else had done and became the model of the world.
[24:33.980 --> 24:43.980]  The good aspects of the Republic are what the globalists want to remove and bring in ancient, total, imperial control.
[24:43.980 --> 24:53.980]  You look at globalism, it's the return of the kings. It's the corporate kings. It's like the 1970s rollerball movie with James Cahn, writ large.
[24:53.980 --> 25:04.980]  That's what they're establishing, in their own words. That's why they made movies about it, throwing it in your face. This is what they're setting up and it's anti-human, it's anti-freedom.
[25:04.980 --> 25:13.980]  Now, that said, this is history, this is a huge victory, but the fight is just beginning. He has to go in and let those Republicans know.
[25:13.980 --> 25:21.980]  I have people behind me, I have a mandate, you've seen the media collapse, you've seen the Republican establishment, you've seen everything they have thrown at Trump.
[25:21.980 --> 25:28.980]  And if they try to block him, he is going to absolutely, in the next election, remove all of them.
[25:28.980 --> 25:43.980]  He could start with major moves for recalls. It's time for the president to use his power with the people to mobilize them, because Paul Ryan and all these people, they want the power structure for themselves and
[25:43.980 --> 25:50.980]  Trump is not going to sit there and sell favors to them to go along with him. That's why they're so angry.
[25:50.980 --> 25:58.980]  And the stock market, you notice, they tried to plunge it to scare everybody, and we've looked at it in the open market committee of the president, it's not in there propping it up.
[25:58.980 --> 26:05.980]  But guess what? It's going up, just as small investors, medium-sized and others, are jubilant. Look at DrugsReport.com.
[26:05.980 --> 26:18.980]  Trump rocks market investors exuberant, and then there's all these economists, including liberal ones, going, you know what, actually, if he does what he says he's going to do, it's a super good plan.
[26:18.980 --> 26:28.980]  This is a guy that finishes most of his hotels 50% early and under budget.
[26:28.980 --> 26:37.980]  I mean, I guess it's the Scott in him, and he admits that, that he's an absolute penny-pinsher and ball-buster, and just get ready, globalist, because Trump is coming after you.
[26:37.980 --> 26:50.980]  You have been pissing on this country forever, and it's going to stop. And that's why there's such this exuberance in Russia, because, again, they've been under the very same corporations and banks that are squatting on top of us right now.
[26:50.980 --> 27:00.980]  Does that mean if we kick the globalist out, everybody's going to be fine? No. And the globalist owns so much, they control so much, they're still going to be there, it's still going to be wealthy, still be owning almost everything.
[27:00.980 --> 27:08.980]  It's just they're not going to squeeze out the last few factories, the last few jobs, and make us all live in coffin apartments, and not have cars, and not have vacations.
[27:08.980 --> 27:16.980]  They admit they want to permanently end us, saying, we're hurting the earth, then you get rid of your jumbo jets first.
[27:16.980 --> 27:22.980]  No, you want to conquer us, you want to rub out people with prosperity that ain't happening.
[27:22.980 --> 27:33.980]  And that's why they're saying, lock her up chanting on the stock market, and CNN, MSNBC, and others don't know what to do.
[27:33.980 --> 27:39.980]  MSNBC, you name it, because it's dawning on them, we really are hated, we really don't have power.
[27:39.980 --> 27:46.980]  You see, as they got exposed, and as the media got totally exposed, is active shills against the American people, not just well-meaning liberal idiots.
[27:46.980 --> 27:52.980]  As it came out, they were a lot step military operation, run by George Soros, run by the White House and Hillary.
[27:52.980 --> 27:57.980]  They've gone from being reviled to absolutely hated forever.
[27:57.980 --> 28:05.980]  That means any sponsors associated with you, it means your families, everybody, you are anathema, you are the enemy.
[28:05.980 --> 28:14.980]  And I've been talking to folks, their husbands, their wives are saying, turn against us, don't be part of this, everybody hates us now, the neighbors all hate us, everyone's turning against us.
[28:14.980 --> 28:28.980]  That illusion that was there, that they were large and in charge and unstoppable, and we had to just accept the will of Harvard, and accept the will of the LA Times, the New York Times, and just accept the will and use what words they said,
[28:28.980 --> 28:40.980]  and mother and father are bad, and the state runs our kids, and force inoculations, and GMOs good for you, and we're going to launch all these wars, but it's okay because we're liberals, and we're going to arrest a bunch of reporters for no reason.
[28:40.980 --> 28:47.980]  People have turned against you, and it's a lot worse than you even think, delusionals.
[28:47.980 --> 28:51.980]  So you're saying, oh my gosh, Alice Jones' narrative, it's taken over.
[28:51.980 --> 29:02.980]  It's not my narrative, it's the return of Americana, it's the return of the most successful system the world's ever seen, dumbasses.
[29:02.980 --> 29:12.980]  You didn't fully extinguish it out, and now it's going to come roaring back like the phoenix, let's go out to break with them chanting, lock her up.
[29:12.980 --> 29:27.980]  My colleague Carl Kentenia, and I'm reading this, and on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, according to Carl Kentenia, people were booing, shouting, lock her up.
[29:27.980 --> 29:37.980]  These are the Wall Street people, some individuals, I mean we know it wasn't the entire room, but it was enough that Carl Kentenia, responsible journalist, this is what was happening.
[29:37.980 --> 29:43.980]  And then we're going to come back, we're actually digging it up, but there it is, again, where'd lock her up come from?
[29:43.980 --> 29:58.980]  Hmm, where'd Hillary for President come from again? We'll be right back, stay with us.
[30:14.980 --> 30:21.980]  Now the Drudge Report linked to this Bloomberg article, US stocks rally falters near records as Trump platform assessed.
[30:21.980 --> 30:27.980]  Yeah, that's right, they actually took the time to look at his plan and go, wow, more people are going to have more money, and we're going to make more money.
[30:27.980 --> 30:40.980]  And of course Bloomberg's trying to put a hazy spin on this headline, but the fact is the Dow Jones industrial average rose to an all-time high as investors speculated on the industries and companies that stand to benefit from Donald Trump's surprise election victory.
[30:40.980 --> 30:50.980]  The Dow rose 125 points, Goldman Sachs came out and said Trump's promise to revive American infrastructure means commodities used to build everything from airports to bridges will benefit under his presidency.
[30:50.980 --> 30:59.980]  That's right, at this point, if Trump does what he says, we can look to a new era of economic prosperity. Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[30:59.980 --> 31:14.980]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[31:14.980 --> 31:24.980]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. Pop two of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like being everything just kind of clears up.

[31:37.980 --> 31:47.980]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 6 45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[31:47.980 --> 31:58.980]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at InfowarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[32:29.980 --> 32:33.980]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.

[33:24.980 --> 33:31.980]  Analysis. Trump would have beaten Obama in 2012. The New World Order is in trouble.
[33:31.980 --> 33:39.980]  Main Street Media has a big article out on that. The World Government is in trouble that the leaders of the World Government are panicking, even though the World Government doesn't exist.
[33:39.980 --> 33:50.980]  It's kind of like death panels being in the Obamacare bill or the IRS giving you $5,000 fines, but it also doesn't exist. That's the racist Alex Jones saying that.
[33:50.980 --> 33:55.980]  Oh, where was I racist? We don't care. It's a magic word. We use it over and over again. We're so intellectual.
[33:55.980 --> 34:02.980]  No, they know that their audience are a bunch of buffoons who just hear that word and like pee pee on themselves.
[34:02.980 --> 34:08.980]  You like to come in a room or something, a little dog is scared of you and he doesn't know anything. He's kind of like, pfft.
[34:08.980 --> 34:14.980]  It's just like, you know, Obamacare is meant to really hurt the economy and screw you. Big megabanks wrote it and they're laughing at you.
[34:14.980 --> 34:20.980]  There's a gruber that wrote it saying he thinks you're an idiot and it's meant to trouble your prices. No racist, pfft.
[34:20.980 --> 34:30.980]  It's like, okay, all right, literally. We have footage, but they're cussing so much we can't play it because it would just be nothing but beeps of what we call the New Age Creeligs discovered.
[34:30.980 --> 34:35.980]  These two women, there's a bunch of them out there. This is just in downtown Austin.
[34:35.980 --> 34:44.980]  Two days before the election, screaming and screaming and screaming like, like, like they're being murdered, like they have just found dead children.
[34:44.980 --> 34:51.980]  I mean, it is the most hysterical out of their mind just, he's a hobo, he wants to hurt the king.
[34:51.980 --> 35:06.980]  And then he's like, whoa, when did he say that? It's like a cat fight. This is just at the start.
[35:06.980 --> 35:11.980]  And they just inflict and infect these women's brains with scientific warfare.
[35:11.980 --> 35:18.980]  And then they teach all the men to walk around and ask real beta and then like, prostrate themselves with the women and go, I'm beta, I'm beta.
[35:18.980 --> 35:21.980]  And then the woman's totally mad because there's no real men around, but she doesn't know why.
[35:21.980 --> 35:25.980]  Subconsciously, she hates men, but she really loves them.
[35:25.980 --> 35:31.980]  You ought to see these social justice warrior women though, man, because when you really start arguing with them and laughing with them and smiling, they start getting really excited, their cheeks get all red.
[35:31.980 --> 35:36.980]  They're like, I'm like, this is a test. Give me your phone number.
[35:36.980 --> 35:42.980]  They're like, maybe. I was like, oh, yeah, that's what I thought. Listen, sweetheart, did you not have a daddy at home?
[35:42.980 --> 35:50.980]  I'm sorry you didn't. I'm not saying that mean. It's just so sad that they think the state is their daddy.
[35:50.980 --> 35:57.980]  And they see a big orange-headed toad hopping around that just wants to cut their taxes and empower the country.
[35:57.980 --> 36:02.980]  And they're scared of it. They're scared of Americana. And that's what Donald Trump is.
[36:02.980 --> 36:08.980]  A big, fat slice of it. A big, ridiculous slice of it.
[36:08.980 --> 36:13.980]  America is ridiculous. It's big. It's rich. It's opportunities. It's decadence.
[36:13.980 --> 36:19.980]  I'm not even saying it's all good, but it's better than what the New World Order wants.
[36:19.980 --> 36:27.980]  The big orange toads are a lot better than weirdo billionaires devil worshiping, bringing little kids to party where they simulate drinking blood.
[36:27.980 --> 36:37.980]  Let me see. People doing that and saying they want to make us poor and they hate us in the WikiLeaks or someone that openly wants to hire minorities and put them in charge of major operations and create wealth.
[36:37.980 --> 36:48.980]  That's very horrible person. Under $40,000 a year he's trying to get a bill passed where you pay zero tax.
[36:48.980 --> 36:56.980]  I've seen people with $40,000 paychecks. There's some of them in this office and I've seen as I sign the cheques what's being taken out of them.
[36:56.980 --> 37:04.980]  $10,000 a year. You don't want to keep that? Okay, I'm sorry. That's what that big, fat orange toad wants to do.
[37:04.980 --> 37:11.980]  By the way, I don't mean that meanly. I kind of call myself a toad. That's like a nickname that my parents have for me. I've had it for a while.
[37:11.980 --> 37:14.980]  My kids call me the toad, so it's a very endearing thing.
[37:14.980 --> 37:22.980]  But look at Trump. He is like a magical, large golden toad hopping around and they just don't know why they can't beat him.
[37:22.980 --> 37:30.980]  It's like Diller, the big globalist media guy, said he has a magical evil behind him.
[37:30.980 --> 37:35.980]  Nobody, it's called not wanting to screw people over. That's what it is.
[37:35.980 --> 37:44.980]  That's why I try to brand him constantly. He's wanting to screw everybody because the truth is he just does hard nose deals with big corporations and they know it and don't like it because he did it his way.
[37:44.980 --> 37:50.980]  You know the Frank Sinatra song? I did it my way. That's what Trump's done.
[37:50.980 --> 37:58.980]  Alright, let's stop right there. I want to start getting to these clips, but before I do that, here's the really sad stuff.
[37:58.980 --> 38:02.980]  We have a stack of videos here.
[38:02.980 --> 38:11.980]  And I've met reports more of this happening in Austin. It's very, very sad and it's meant to elicit a prison culture where if there's enough racial attacks on white people,
[38:11.980 --> 38:21.980]  it's going to create a big racist backlash when 90% of Hispanics and blacks and other folks are not foaming at the mouth races that want to beat you up in a parking lot.
[38:21.980 --> 38:32.980]  I pulled into a Dutch shell yesterday and had two different people who knew who I was kind of bugged their eyes out at me and one guy started going like this.
[38:32.980 --> 38:39.980]  I just went standing by my car and the guy walked off. I guess I wasn't like a woman or some little person.
[38:39.980 --> 38:45.980]  I mean, I'm not the toughest guy around. I'm an old guy these days, but he's a pretty big black guy.
[38:45.980 --> 38:51.980]  I was just like, uh, man, jump on top of him, put his head in the concrete and the second he moves at me.
[38:51.980 --> 38:56.980]  I didn't want to hurt him, but I'm going to put him down. I just got to start carrying a gun at all times.
[38:56.980 --> 39:01.980]  That's really sad part, but that's it. I'm carrying all the time now, just because I'm just going to try to get in my car.
[39:01.980 --> 39:05.980]  People try to attack me. I'm going to engage him. I'm not going to be the big tough guy I was when I was 20.
[39:05.980 --> 39:10.980]  I'm just going to try to get back and just stay back because I'm not looking for any trouble.
[39:10.980 --> 39:18.980]  I don't want to hurt these zombies, but man, I tell you, they've been brainwashed and I had a black guy bow up and Hispanic guy,
[39:18.980 --> 39:24.980]  pretty wild-eyed and then the guy behind the counter where I'm sitting there getting my Gatorade.
[39:24.980 --> 39:29.980]  No Gatorade's crappy, but I give myself a treat occasionally. I like how orange Gatorade tastes.
[39:29.980 --> 39:35.980]  And he's like, man, things are crazy. Yeah. I'm like, yeah, it's horrible.
[39:35.980 --> 39:39.980]  Trump was cut everybody's taxes and he goes, I don't know. I like it. I like it. Man, it's scary.
[39:39.980 --> 39:46.980]  People are pissed. This is in South Austin. And I'm like, whoa, I guess I see.
[39:46.980 --> 39:53.980]  Oh, I'm the type of guy that goes in and eats barbecue and he's tossing and hangs out and, you know, likes to go to blue collar areas.
[39:53.980 --> 39:59.980]  What it'll cause is me not to do that. See, and that then isolates everybody and we're now in our prison.
[39:59.980 --> 40:05.980]  And that's what DrudgeReport.com has linked. Shock video from Chicago and there's videos pouring in across the country.
[40:05.980 --> 40:09.980]  Police cars getting burned, things being blown up, people being killed. You name it.
[40:09.980 --> 40:16.980]  A shock video, black mob viciously beats white Trump voter and it's all on tape.
[40:16.980 --> 40:23.980]  We're going to be playing that. You got folks on national TV saying, you know, we need to kill these people.
[40:23.980 --> 40:29.980]  People have to die. Anti-Trump protesters calls for violence on CNN.
[40:29.980 --> 40:34.980]  And then I was talking to some of the crew here this morning and they said, well, no, one fellow works here,
[40:34.980 --> 40:39.980]  lives next door to a cab driver who got attacked by two Hispanic males and mugged.
[40:39.980 --> 40:45.980]  And they got the license plate. The guys even got arrested later and they said, we're going to beat you up because you're white.
[40:45.980 --> 40:50.980]  And the person was like, white. They go, Trump is sort of beating him. But of course, robbing.
[40:50.980 --> 40:57.980]  See, most criminals aren't pure sociopaths, so they want to think what they're doing is right and okay.
[40:57.980 --> 41:03.980]  And that's what I wanted to say here. Think about how the mainstream media is and what you've done.
[41:03.980 --> 41:11.980]  Like Putin said, look what you've done putting Al-Qaeda in charge of Syria, killing 300 plus thousand people.
[41:11.980 --> 41:16.980]  It's like 400,000 last time I checked, but 200 plus thousand are Christians.
[41:16.980 --> 41:24.980]  Look what you've done for no reason just to be evil. And now you're really up there on TV going, racist KKK has taken the country.
[41:24.980 --> 41:29.980]  He's going to deport everyone and kill everyone and enslave you and hurt you and he hates women, he hates gays.
[41:29.980 --> 41:35.980]  And all this made up or exaggerated, twisted stuff. And then a bunch of people, whether they be white, black, Hispanic,
[41:35.980 --> 41:41.980]  that are kind of the desperate-eyed, lottery ticket mentality, just get into the hype and go, I'm mad, then I'm going to go out and do something.
[41:41.980 --> 41:46.980]  And I look at these photos and videos of the women that are out protesting. It's like 70% women in most cases.
[41:46.980 --> 41:53.980]  They look totally desperate, scared, but well-fed in this horrible country.
[41:53.980 --> 42:00.980]  Just stumbling around, bitching, totally just screaming and yelling and a bunch of mindless hysteria.
[42:00.980 --> 42:10.980]  And what are they doing? They're ensuring that the incredible altruism and Christian edict to try to mop up classism,
[42:10.980 --> 42:15.980]  statism, racism, that was the greatest in this country anywhere in history.
[42:15.980 --> 42:23.980]  Well, I was taught it was the worst. That's why, folks, because it was the idea and it was building. They have to destroy that.
[42:23.980 --> 42:32.980]  So they're creating the total division right now. They're doing it right now, destroying Martin Luther King's dream right now
[42:32.980 --> 42:40.980]  so they can rule us by the great game, divide and conquer. Divide and conquer. And they've done it.
[42:40.980 --> 42:48.980]  We have to set about being very, very focused, very, very truthful, very, very brave and standing up to this and explaining to people
[42:48.980 --> 42:52.980]  and deprogramming them and reaching out to them and understanding what's happening.
[42:52.980 --> 43:00.980]  But we also have to route the source of it, the Democratic Party, the Republican Party leadership, the MSM, what's left of it, because they're gone.
[43:00.980 --> 43:04.980]  They're going to try to reorganize right now. And you can see they're all shell-shocked.
[43:04.980 --> 43:13.980]  But their only instinct is to double down with the race-baiting and to say this election was a white lash.
[43:13.980 --> 43:19.980]  When record numbers, I have them right here. It's in the Associated Press. They even admit it, of blacks and Hispanics voted for Trump.
[43:19.980 --> 43:25.980]  Record numbers. People are leaving the Democratic Party plantation. They're leaving the Republican Party plantation.
[43:25.980 --> 43:37.980]  And Trump needs to deliver now with tax cuts and to hold spending where it is and to actually have real projects in this country to create jobs and to create innovation
[43:37.980 --> 43:46.980]  and to get people to positively again think about building up society and having optimism, which can very easily be done.
[43:46.980 --> 43:50.980]  We can fire this engine up in just a few months. Here's the problem. And here's my advice to Donald Trump.
[43:50.980 --> 43:56.980]  I'm going to shoot some special reports on this that are going to be talking to him probably today.
[43:56.980 --> 44:03.980]  He was saying to him, he's smart, he knows this, but here's the bottom line.
[44:03.980 --> 44:14.980]  They're going to try to implode the economy before he even physically gets in, in middle of January.
[44:14.980 --> 44:21.980]  They're going to work as hard as they can. And I said this Tuesday night, Wednesday morning, Drudge linked to it.
[44:21.980 --> 44:28.980]  We put the video on screen. I think the headline for memory is globalist to exact headline.
[44:28.980 --> 44:37.980]  Globalist plan to destroy economy to bring down Trump.
[44:37.980 --> 44:40.980]  And then obviously blaming on him when it's their whole system. He hasn't even gotten involved yet.
[44:40.980 --> 44:46.980]  They did plunge the market, but now because of individuals getting involved and people having more exuberance over and over,
[44:46.980 --> 44:51.980]  there's going to be tax cuts. It's gone way back up 300, 400 points. Just that's epic.
[44:51.980 --> 44:59.980]  So the good news is there's a fight going on and it's between people that understand what's going on and folks that are not aware of what's happening.
[44:59.980 --> 45:09.980]  And then there's that little group in between that's trying to manipulate both sides against each other when prosperity for everybody is what's going to make this country and this world have a future.
[45:09.980 --> 45:23.980]  And you read the WikiLeaks, it's all about picking winners and losers and keeping people poor so you can dominate them and control them and use them like chattel.
[45:23.980 --> 45:35.980]  It is the most selfish, satanic, evil crap I've ever seen. And Christ said, it'd be better for you to kill yourself than to hurt these children.
[45:35.980 --> 45:45.980]  And if you elaborate on that, it means childlike minds. I mean, who would go rob, say, a down syndrome, say, 10-year-old walking down the street?
[45:45.980 --> 45:51.980]  You know, we hear about that. It's worse. We hear that, you know, some people mugged a 30-year-old man. It's still bad that he's a man.
[45:51.980 --> 45:56.980]  But, you know, if you mug a retarded kid, see a political correctness, mugging a kid's okay. Just don't say retarded.
[45:56.980 --> 46:01.980]  No, I'm going to use the words I want. Nothing gets retarded to children. That's the word. Retarded. Help back.
[46:01.980 --> 46:07.980]  It's a war on words. And then next, mentally disabled, oh, disabled isn't the right word. See, it's all about them controlling language.
[46:07.980 --> 46:17.980]  Retarded child. Mugging them is terrible because we know they're even more disadvantaged. It's an even more cowardly move.
[46:17.980 --> 46:25.980]  We have an instinct to protect and build up the least of us. And they're removing that from us. Oh, let's kill the retarded child.
[46:25.980 --> 46:31.980]  That's what the big liberals are calling for. Let's kill grandma. But we love grandma and we represent grandma.
[46:31.980 --> 46:36.980]  But, kill her and hire 10 teachers. Bill Gates said.
[46:36.980 --> 46:43.980]  Who robs a pregnant woman? Steve Snatch's neck was on Florida's woman's neck just hours before she gave birth. See, people get outraged by that.
[46:43.980 --> 46:50.980]  So, I have all these videos I'm going to play in a moment of the latest knockout games and people being attacked, people being beat up.
[46:50.980 --> 46:57.980]  Imagine the image of, say, a bunch of Caucasian men beating up a Hispanic woman. People would be outraged.
[46:57.980 --> 47:01.980]  It happens with people waving Mexican flags. Nobody cares to a white woman.
[47:01.980 --> 47:08.980]  The hundreds of videos out every few months of black people beating whites, sometimes to death, and it's just all a big joke.
[47:08.980 --> 47:14.980]  It's because they inherently deserve it. Some poor white guy.
[47:14.980 --> 47:20.980]  And then they're beating them up. An old guy. It's just a total joke.
[47:20.980 --> 47:27.980]  But I'll tell you this right now. And they're in his car robbing him while all this is going on.
[47:27.980 --> 47:34.980]  The answer to this is carrying a firearm.
[47:34.980 --> 47:47.980]  And the beating just goes on and on and on and on and on and on. And it's totally racial. It's just like five guys in KKK robes beating up some old black guy.
[47:47.980 --> 47:53.980]  Remember the old black guy that got drugged to death in East Texas? It was the biggest national story for several years.
[47:53.980 --> 48:04.980]  And what was crazy was that he'd been a prison guy himself. They'd been in the prisons, been in prison wars with each other. The KKK and then the black race group, he was him.
[48:04.980 --> 48:07.980]  And they drug him to death. And it was wrong. It was terrible.
[48:07.980 --> 48:17.980]  Then three black males about a year later in the same town saw an old drunk white bum and drug him to death.
[48:17.980 --> 48:19.980]  Now here's the difference. They had been in a gang war with each other.
[48:19.980 --> 48:26.980]  This was a completely innocent drunk white bum doing nothing to black people and they killed him. Now listen, both things are evil.
[48:26.980 --> 48:32.980]  No one covered it but the local newspaper. That's how controlled the media is in this country.
[48:32.980 --> 48:43.980]  Is that it's so controlled that all these racial attacks happening to where now, I guess I cannot safely, especially with my children in this climate,
[48:43.980 --> 48:58.980]  I have to, for safety, like it's a prison, you've succeeded MSNBC. I'm going to more and more have to segregate from areas where, because I'm white, I'm going to be attacked.
[48:58.980 --> 49:10.980]  I mean, it's defundant. It's going on. And it's intensifying. And this is what the so-called liberals have done to us. This is what liberals do.
[49:10.980 --> 49:19.980]  No, this is what George Soros does, stirring up the different Islamic groups to bring down their countries, funding the Arab Spring and the media promoting it like it was a good thing.
[49:19.980 --> 49:28.980]  And what they did in Ukraine and what they do everywhere else, they go and find the different racial or religious divisions and they turn them against each other.
[49:28.980 --> 49:43.980]  In the Ukraine, it's Catholic against Orthodox. It's Russian against Ukrainian. In Eastern Ukraine, what's it mean? I mean, doesn't Ukraine just mean border?
[49:43.980 --> 49:53.980]  Eastern Ukraine is always important to Russia. It's just total mental illness, folks, but they go in there and they create this division and they play it off and people go along with it.
[49:53.980 --> 50:00.980]  And do you know how? I'm going to skip this break. Do you know how George Soros overthrew Ukraine two and a half years ago? He brags.
[50:00.980 --> 50:15.980]  He got $5 billion of our tax money. He matched it $2 billion, $7 billion, and they went out and they had TV stations they bought, air stuff constantly showing bad cops shooting people and beating people.
[50:15.980 --> 50:27.980]  Then they said the whole government did this, used a few case points and then started shooting police and then burning things and then they called it a civil war and then our media got behind it and then the CIA got behind it and they overthrew Ukraine.
[50:27.980 --> 50:40.980]  Now, you see what they're doing here now. This is an attempt to overthrow the country and it got so desperate that even our own corrupt agencies said they're really going to overthrow the whole thing and bankrupt everything and really have a race war.
[50:40.980 --> 50:48.980]  You know what? We already know they're doing all this pedophile stuff and stealing and everything. We've got the files. Go ahead and release them. This is too much.
[50:48.980 --> 50:58.980]  Finally, some sanity. And if Hillary wouldn't have conceded because they were already trying to steal the election and they did steal some states, you know what's ready to come out.
[50:58.980 --> 51:07.980]  And I told you months before it was pedophilia and I told you months before it was devil worship. I told you, they attacked me. Oh, Alex says we're devil worshipers. He's crazy.
[51:07.980 --> 51:19.980]  There's nothing on these WikiLeaks. Oh, and they're Satanists. Of course they're Satanists. Have you read the other? So I can't wait to make them poor, keep them the dark and hopeless.
[51:19.980 --> 51:31.980]  We all agree, submerging them into despair is the way to do it. Totally bankrupting them. These pathetic scum. I mean, who sits around like writing emails. I feel the American people. I hate these black people in Mexicans.
[51:31.980 --> 51:42.980]  So sick of them asking for stuff. And it's just like, what the hell? Then they go on TV and go, thank God they're also stupid. And they got Charlie Rose and all the White House writers.
[51:42.980 --> 52:00.980]  Yeah, we wrote stuff about how they'd be able to keep their doctor. That was a really funny one. They're so disconnected. They're celebrating how they're effing everybody over on TV because they live in all the big compact cities with the desperate, dumbed down, poor people.
[52:00.980 --> 52:13.980]  Whether they're white or black, you look at them, they look like their souls have been sucked down to shuffling around. So they pull up with their $200,000 Mercedes and go into their multi-million dollar flats and they sit there and like shove the mate aside and hop around and laugh.
[52:13.980 --> 52:24.980]  And they look out the window, all the poor, desperate people that watch TV all day and have had their souls sucked and been taught they're ugly and poor and bad because they're not on lifestyles of the rich and famous.
[52:24.980 --> 52:33.980]  Madison Avenue has warped their brains. There's psychological warfare manuals on this. They've taken their families away. They've taken their honor away. They've taken away who they were.
[52:33.980 --> 52:41.980]  They've given them poisoned food so they don't even know who they are. And all these little demonic, skexy vultures are perched on top of them, looking down on them.
[52:41.980 --> 52:53.980]  And then Obama realizes there's still a spirit in the country of people that have guns and grow things and aren't under our full control yet. What do we do? We call them white people.
[52:53.980 --> 53:08.980]  And we make it all racial. So if they ever don't want to go along with something, they're racist. And then we tell all our slaves in the inner cities, you know, you don't have a good life because there's white people in Montana.
[53:08.980 --> 53:25.980]  You know why they won? White people did it. And the KKK is taking over. And then you wonder why you get out of gas station, you wander in, and it's almost a war scene. And you're thinking, am I being paranoid? Is that guy looking like he wants to attack me?
[53:25.980 --> 53:38.980]  And then that guy checks out on the guy behind the counter. Hispanic guy goes, yeah, Alex is pretty scary. People are pretty mad. What do you think? I said, well, Trump's going to cut taxes for poor people. He goes, I know I like it. He goes, it's scary.
[53:38.980 --> 53:59.980]  I walk outside. Big black guy comes walking over. Look at me like he's thinking about saying something. I just go, okay. But I mean, we are so far gone, ladies and gentlemen. We are so far gone. They have literally set up abortuaries in all these neighborhoods.
[53:59.980 --> 54:18.980]  They have literally destroyed these people's families, shipped drugs and done it all. Now, as an organized army of dumbed down zombies, they're going to forge these giant unwashed masses into the final detonator to sink the country.
[54:18.980 --> 54:32.980]  Think about that, and we will be just like Venezuela, folks. So you want to go under hardcore social engineering, you're looking at it. And so understand, when you see MSNBC and CNN, these are sworn enemies of you and your family.
[54:32.980 --> 54:47.980]  This is a war. I mean, think of it as a naval battle or a space battle. Imagine Info Wars is like Defense Ship One, or Defense Ship Five doesn't matter, but like out there blasting with the truth in a war with their own documents.
[54:47.980 --> 54:58.980]  And they're just mining the waters with racism, racism, sexism, homophobe, infight, infight, divide and conquer. That's all they've got.
[54:58.980 --> 55:08.980]  And again, they teach themselves, they brag how to lie, how to deceive, how to eff you over. That's why you read these emails. It's so nasty. You say, how are these people also evil?
[55:08.980 --> 55:20.980]  It's not that that's so common. It's that you don't get in their club unless you sit around talking about how much you hate the general public. You understand that?
[55:20.980 --> 55:29.980]  I had some other guests. I've pretty much canceled them. I've got Rappaport coming on because I want to just take time to play clips and cover the news, but we're in incredibly positive straits.
[55:29.980 --> 55:39.980]  They try to steal everything. And here's the positive news. They were going to get four to five Supreme Court justices. This is a reprieve on the execution of the country.
[55:39.980 --> 55:48.980]  They already had fully dissolved the borders and were trying to collapse the economy by letting everybody with diseases come in at record levels, not even treating them.
[55:48.980 --> 55:54.980]  Which is a serious crime on multiple levels.
[55:54.980 --> 56:01.980]  They were going to launch a war with Russia and they still might try in the next two months. They were going to do a hellish thing.
[56:01.980 --> 56:13.980]  I mean, we had true evil scurrying around, couldn't believe it was in full control of the new Atlantis, couldn't believe it was in, had actually seized the mythical republic.
[56:13.980 --> 56:26.980]  They actually have it in their hands partway and we're about to finish it. And along comes Donald Trump and Info Wars and Drudge and these movements that were already there and Americana waiting for its spirit to come right back in.
[56:26.980 --> 56:34.980]  And now the Phoenix is beginning to fire up. It is not risen again, but the fire has been...
[56:34.980 --> 56:42.980]  And the enemy is screaming in fear. Like a volcano is going off. They see the fire in the night.
[56:42.980 --> 56:48.980]  Because what happens once prosperity flows and honor and strength and we rediscover who we are and we come together.
[56:48.980 --> 56:55.980]  And all these people manipulating us against each other have been exposed for who they are. Their control is over.
[56:55.980 --> 57:01.980]  See, you don't want control. You're a patriot. You just want your own life. You build things. They want control.
[57:01.980 --> 57:05.980]  Before I go any further, because they're going to kill me because I never plug. I want to thank everybody for your support.
[57:05.980 --> 57:13.980]  We have extended it. They actually taken it down this morning. I said, no, this is a victory. This is a celebration. I'm extending it right through this weekend, but then we have to stop.
[57:13.980 --> 57:23.980]  Thirty to forty percent off all the storable food. Thirty percent off, no, I tell you, thirty percent off. X2, DNA, four, thirty percent off. Everything is thirty to forty percent off except for the apparel.
[57:23.980 --> 57:31.980]  That's fifteen percent off. Trump is my president shirt is about to sell out. It's limited edition. That will be gone.
[57:31.980 --> 57:39.980]  InfowarsStore.com is the umbrella site. InfowarsLive.com is the sub-site. Made in 1776.com is the Made in America apparel sub-site.
[57:39.980 --> 57:43.980]  But you can find it all at InfowarsStore.com. Free shipping, free shipping, free shipping.
[57:43.980 --> 57:54.980]  And by the way, we are ready into the next phase of the war proving we deliver, proving we are totally committed and the zeitgeist of resistance that we are now ready to take this like a military operation.
[57:54.980 --> 58:06.980]  We've got one battered attack cruiser, folks. All right? And we have sunk more enemy ships than probably anybody out there in this fight, okay?
[58:06.980 --> 58:12.980]  And we want to launch more ships. I don't want the responsibility, but I don't. Maybe we need ten ships.
[58:12.980 --> 58:20.980]  Maybe we need to be bigger than Fox News. Five times bigger. Ten times bigger. That's up to you. I mean bigger. I mean having the personnel, having a thousand people, not sixty.
[58:20.980 --> 58:25.980]  If we have sixty people, imagine what a hundred would do. Two hundred, three hundred.
[58:25.980 --> 58:30.980]  I don't want to actually do that because of infiltration and other issues, but we want to hire ten, fifteen more people.
[58:30.980 --> 58:38.980]  And if you fill our coffers, you better believe. I'm going to reload and launch another frigate and retool this one for the next attack profile.
[58:38.980 --> 58:43.980]  Stay with us. We are victory. We are 1776. We are America.
[58:43.980 --> 58:48.980]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:48.980 --> 58:53.980]  Dr. Griff, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[58:53.980 --> 58:58.980]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[58:58.980 --> 59:07.980]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[59:07.980 --> 59:12.980]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[59:12.980 --> 59:18.980]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[59:18.980 --> 59:20.980]  These are all parasites.
[59:20.980 --> 59:22.980]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[59:22.980 --> 59:26.980]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[59:26.980 --> 59:30.980]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[59:30.980 --> 59:33.980]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[59:33.980 --> 59:36.980]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[59:36.980 --> 59:43.980]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you can support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[59:43.980 --> 59:45.980]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[59:45.980 --> 1:00:12.980]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:00:12.980 --> 1:00:17.980]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:17.980 --> 1:00:20.980]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[1:00:20.980 --> 1:00:33.980]  Live from the infowars.com studio, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:33.980 --> 1:00:38.980]  Well, you want to celebrate? I've had some sleep. I'm ready to celebrate.
[1:00:38.980 --> 1:00:45.980]  I just, I love this country so much because I know what it represents and I know why the enemy hates it so much.
[1:00:45.980 --> 1:00:52.980]  That when I see it barely saved, but still in deep, deep trouble, it upsets me.
[1:00:52.980 --> 1:00:57.980]  But seeing like an animal that's down and that people are making fun of it, that gets to me.
[1:00:57.980 --> 1:01:07.980]  And I don't know about Russia. And I think about how our globalists that control us literally put the Russian Revolution in place and did all of that.
[1:01:07.980 --> 1:01:13.980]  Now that top historian's on and they could totally concur. That's a fact.
[1:01:13.980 --> 1:01:19.980]  And then you think Russia has thrown off the very same globalist and it's certainly not perfect.
[1:01:19.980 --> 1:01:29.980]  But you're trying to reorganize and imagine if Trump is able to not have the globalist keep this whole war with Russia going.
[1:01:29.980 --> 1:01:35.980]  And if the United States allied with Russia under free market terms and business and all the rest of it,
[1:01:35.980 --> 1:01:39.980]  China is the true evil and is so satanic.
[1:01:39.980 --> 1:01:43.980]  Unless they satanic, I mean mobile execution vans, 80 plus million debt under Mao,
[1:01:43.980 --> 1:01:50.980]  our elite put those communists in there. We could support independence movements in China and actually reform China
[1:01:50.980 --> 1:01:58.980]  and have better trade deals with China and have better free trade deals and fair trade deals to give a living wage to the Chinese
[1:01:58.980 --> 1:02:01.980]  to rise humanity, not have a giant sucking sound.
[1:02:01.980 --> 1:02:09.980]  Ross Perot explained this to everybody, okay? When you pay more, then your employees can buy more products
[1:02:09.980 --> 1:02:14.980]  and you build a better civilization. Humans can build whatever level of comfort we want.
[1:02:14.980 --> 1:02:21.980]  The problem is it creates decadence. That's a byproduct and a problem.
[1:02:21.980 --> 1:02:28.980]  But he explained it and we ought to find those clips from those presidential debates but also when he was on Larry King with Al Gore.
[1:02:28.980 --> 1:02:34.980]  This is a good deal, Larry. Okay, stop interrupting me. I'm explaining this one more time.
[1:02:34.980 --> 1:02:40.980]  Before we did this latest trade deal, two years ago, this was two years ago, with Canada,
[1:02:40.980 --> 1:02:45.980]  they were getting paid $35 to $40 an hour on average. Now, our auto workers $25 an hour.
[1:02:45.980 --> 1:02:51.980]  Now, within a year of that happening, they've already dropped down to $25 and we've dropped down about $5.
[1:02:51.980 --> 1:02:58.980]  Mexico's paid less than about $1 an hour manufacturing. Let's say they go up to $3 and I'm paraphrasing this based on what he said before.
[1:02:58.980 --> 1:03:04.980]  We're going to go down to like $10 and they're going to go down about $3. This is a giant sucking sound.
[1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:08.980]  Then, once that's happened, that'll move to China or that'll move somewhere else where it's even less.
[1:03:08.980 --> 1:03:12.980]  You cannot lower the wages and then open up to this trade and not destroy the economy.
[1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:19.980]  Now, was Ross Perot right or was Ross Perot wrong? And who supported Ross Perot? Donald Trump.
[1:03:19.980 --> 1:03:26.980]  You paid millions of dollars to put op-eds in the New York Times, the Washington Post and hundreds of other papers written by Trump saying,
[1:03:26.980 --> 1:03:33.980]  Don't do this. Don't do this. This is a bad deal.
[1:03:33.980 --> 1:03:38.980]  And look what happened. That's why they hate Trump, folks.
[1:03:38.980 --> 1:03:43.980]  He'll do deals with China. He doesn't want them to totally collapse. That will make us collapse.
[1:03:43.980 --> 1:03:50.980]  But it's going to be equitable deals where we raise the economy. He wants to put some golf courses in over there.
[1:03:50.980 --> 1:03:55.980]  I mean, we can have whatever economy we want, folks, but we have to decide that we're going to demand on a quality system.
[1:03:55.980 --> 1:04:00.980]  By the way, CJ pointed this out because I'm not good at pitching stuff. He's absolutely right. I'm never plugging.
[1:04:00.980 --> 1:04:05.980]  We're running deals right now where you can get brain force for like $11 and there's free shipping.
[1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:07.980]  And he's right. At that level, it's a lost leader.
[1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:12.980]  So if you want to support the broadcast when we have deals that are this big, please buy some of the other products.
[1:04:12.980 --> 1:04:16.980]  DNA force, 30% off. 34% off a bunch of other items.
[1:04:16.980 --> 1:04:20.980]  Everything in the store is massively marked down with free shipping.
[1:04:20.980 --> 1:04:27.980]  And 10% off when you sign up for auto ship on things that are obviously things that you reorder.
[1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:31.980]  You order a crank powered solar panel, shortway radio.
[1:04:31.980 --> 1:04:34.980]  You'll probably never need another one or 20 years.
[1:04:34.980 --> 1:04:39.980]  But something like survival shield X2 or DNA force or supermail vitality need that every month or every two months.
[1:04:39.980 --> 1:04:43.980]  You can sign up for auto ship. Additional 10% off and a lot of stuff is a lost leader.
[1:04:43.980 --> 1:04:48.980]  If we lose money for new listeners that might be public school educated on all these products.
[1:04:48.980 --> 1:04:50.980]  So absolutely check them out.
[1:04:50.980 --> 1:05:13.980]  Thank everybody for their support infowarstore.com, big news trade ahead and your phone calls.
[1:05:21.980 --> 1:05:27.980]  That's right. They actually took the time to look at his plan and go, wow, more people are going to have more money and we're going to make more money.
[1:05:27.980 --> 1:05:31.980]  And of course Bloomberg is trying to put a hazy spin on this headline.
[1:05:31.980 --> 1:05:40.980]  But the fact is the Dow Jones industrial average rose to an all time high as investors speculated on the industries and companies that stand to benefit from Donald Trump's surprise election victory.
[1:05:40.980 --> 1:05:42.980]  The Dow rose 125 points.
[1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:49.980]  Goldman Sachs came out and said Trump's promise to revive American infrastructure means commodities used to build everything from airports to bridges
[1:05:49.980 --> 1:05:51.980]  under his presidency. That's right.
[1:05:51.980 --> 1:05:55.980]  At this point, if Trump does what he says, we can look to a new era of economic prosperity.
[1:05:55.980 --> 1:05:58.980]  Rob Dew reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news.
[1:05:58.980 --> 1:06:11.980]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential for power grid chaos.
[1:06:11.980 --> 1:06:19.980]  EMP, cyber warfare, onto mentioned dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[1:06:19.980 --> 1:06:22.980]  My friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot worse.
[1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:28.980]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.
[1:06:28.980 --> 1:06:32.980]  Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house.
[1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:36.980]  The solutions from science system simply put this thing is amazing.
[1:06:36.980 --> 1:06:39.980]  Solutions from science only makes the best equipment.
[1:06:39.980 --> 1:06:42.980]  Go to power grid chaos dot com.

[1:07:35.980 --> 1:07:44.980]  In short the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[1:07:44.980 --> 1:07:49.980]  But info wars live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[1:08:07.980 --> 1:08:11.980]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:08:11.980 --> 1:08:19.980]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:08:19.980 --> 1:08:27.980]  The entire political map has been rewritten not disturbed worldwide mainstream media is totally discredited and in freefall collapse.
[1:08:27.980 --> 1:08:40.980]  The Democratic Party and the Republican snot nose establishment are in total crisis mode and realize that none of their BS is working and they were just hit with a giant tsunami.
[1:08:40.980 --> 1:08:52.980]  Repudiating their globalist crony capitalist anti free market fascist dirt bag system.
[1:08:52.980 --> 1:08:54.980]  They've been hit by Brexit.
[1:08:54.980 --> 1:08:57.980]  They've been hit by Russia pulling out leading the pack.
[1:08:57.980 --> 1:09:06.980]  They have been hit by other independence movements all over the world anti globalism movements in Brazil in Spain in Portugal in Greece in Italy.
[1:09:06.980 --> 1:09:16.980]  We're all this close folks and they said in the Washington Post I hammered all this and the Financial Times and the Economist world governments in crisis.
[1:09:16.980 --> 1:09:23.980]  If Hillary falls she's the final domino just like in FIFA Vendetta when he.
[1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:29.980]  It's that final domino on the inspector says it was like it was all connected it was.
[1:09:29.980 --> 1:09:37.980]  And only after you've been doing this so long and you see these things come to fruition and you witness these sea chains do you know.
[1:09:37.980 --> 1:09:44.980]  That there is a hand involved the invisible hand the globalist think it's their little hand and no there's a much bigger hand.
[1:09:44.980 --> 1:09:47.980]  Look at the story here on drugs.
[1:09:47.980 --> 1:09:50.980]  The new new world order.
[1:09:50.980 --> 1:09:53.980]  And it goes in the New York Times.
[1:09:53.980 --> 1:09:57.980]  Trump's victory promises to up in the international order.
[1:09:57.980 --> 1:10:02.980]  Which is George Soros and a handful of other scumbags.
[1:10:02.980 --> 1:10:09.980]  Tax exempt above the law screwing everyone over.
[1:10:09.980 --> 1:10:18.980]  And what's stunning is that the New York Times everybody else thought they could just keep telling us it's ridiculous there's no way Trump will win.
[1:10:18.980 --> 1:10:20.980]  And I'm sitting here.
[1:10:20.980 --> 1:10:25.980]  I'll just tell you involved in internal real scientific polls.
[1:10:25.980 --> 1:10:31.980]  And if these polling agencies even do them you've got to agree to never even publish.
[1:10:31.980 --> 1:10:34.980]  Your results they won't give you a real poll.
[1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:39.980]  Unless you say you won't publish it I'm serious because then that's called internal polling.
[1:10:39.980 --> 1:10:42.980]  And then we checked other polls I talked to other people.
[1:10:42.980 --> 1:10:47.980]  And I've paid for public polls before and they had all the newspapers New York Times Washington Post.
[1:10:47.980 --> 1:11:04.980]  Where he's been going Alex Cointley again claimed he has access to internal polls and said Trump's 10 to 15 points ahead in in in the red states 345678 points in swing states and may even take some blue states and did he take some blue states.
[1:11:04.980 --> 1:11:06.980]  Did he take almost all the swing states.
[1:11:06.980 --> 1:11:08.980]  Did he win just like I told you.
[1:11:08.980 --> 1:11:13.980]  Was I did I just oh Hillary and Obama or devil or spurs oh it comes out.
[1:11:13.980 --> 1:11:15.980]  Oh Trump's going to win.
[1:11:15.980 --> 1:11:19.980]  I mean I had Beth Harris on your stand I laid out my analysis.
[1:11:19.980 --> 1:11:22.980]  She said yeah that's basically spot on.
[1:11:22.980 --> 1:11:24.980]  And I'm not bragging.
[1:11:24.980 --> 1:11:32.980]  It's just that I don't watch football and baseball and stand around with my buddies talking about the engine in my car all day long.
[1:11:32.980 --> 1:11:34.980]  I live this stuff.
[1:11:34.980 --> 1:11:36.980]  I know what I'm talking about.
[1:11:36.980 --> 1:11:46.980]  It's such a repudiation of the snot noses that they sit around like followers together all chirping like a bunch of birds in a tree.
[1:11:46.980 --> 1:11:55.980]  That they have the answers like parents repeating the same four or five lines over and over again and then laughing at us.
[1:11:55.980 --> 1:12:03.980]  So they've collapsed they're a joke but the Empire will try to reconstitute and strike back you better believe it.
[1:12:03.980 --> 1:12:06.980]  The difference is and the biggest game changer is this.
[1:12:06.980 --> 1:12:14.980]  And I don't have time today because I want to take your calls and get into news to explain what happened but but it's a microcosm of our victory so I'll get into it now.
[1:12:14.980 --> 1:12:19.980]  And stuff I figured out about 10 years ago has since actually come out.
[1:12:19.980 --> 1:12:24.980]  You know that's what's crazy you figure something out then later it comes out exactly like you saw.
[1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:28.980]  They're so smart but but once we know their game it's over.
[1:12:28.980 --> 1:12:31.980]  They were worried about a states rights movement 25 years ago.
[1:12:31.980 --> 1:12:36.980]  A legitimate states rights movement of guys in suits and ties running for office taking our country back.
[1:12:36.980 --> 1:12:55.980]  So they went and they financed FBI Southern Poverty Law Center ADL operatives and others to go out with money and to go to the poorest areas and to basically create an anti-government militias which are constitutional.
[1:12:55.980 --> 1:13:01.980]  You can always tell which militias are run by feds or double agents because they'll say Jones is saying we're feds. He's a fed. He's a fed.
[1:13:01.980 --> 1:13:06.980]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The militias constitutional it's good. All able-bodied men are part of it. It's wonderful.
[1:13:06.980 --> 1:13:08.980]  There are a lot of great militias out there.
[1:13:08.980 --> 1:13:19.980]  The fed will go he said all the militias are racist and work for the fed and then that guy's probably speaks for the British accent but then he goes off and I'm telling you.
[1:13:19.980 --> 1:13:22.980]  I've actually seen people before switch into a whole other accent.
[1:13:22.980 --> 1:13:26.980]  They're like let's get down here later. Give the command team to the main base.
[1:13:26.980 --> 1:13:41.980]  I mean, you know, it's total sire to try to stir up the Liberty movement and brand the states rights movement as a bunch of KKK crazy racist people, you know, brewing methamphetamine in their backyard.
[1:13:41.980 --> 1:13:47.980]  So they could then roll up all the other militias and plant pipe bombs on their property and send people to prison.
[1:13:47.980 --> 1:13:52.980]  This is what they do. So it's just like they branded that as racist because they were worried about it.
[1:13:52.980 --> 1:13:58.980]  They went and branded the Tea Party started by Ron Paul Liberty movement that the Republicans try to take over as racist.
[1:13:58.980 --> 1:14:05.980]  So the Hispanics, blacks, others would not feel like they could be libertarians.
[1:14:05.980 --> 1:14:11.980]  You see, they just get rid of the whole section, kind of go to the mall and they say, sorry, there's no men's clothing here. There's no women's clothing here.
[1:14:11.980 --> 1:14:19.980]  You know, it's like what? It's only unisex. It's the same thing of not letting you have the opportunity like you're not allowed to go to a Republican event.
[1:14:19.980 --> 1:14:22.980]  You can't be a libertarian because they're all racist at that.
[1:14:22.980 --> 1:14:28.980]  But then people start actually going to those events and finding out it's the opposite and the paradigm starts shattering.
[1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:33.980]  So they go into panic mode to try to keep it in place and make it all be race based 10 times worse than it was.
[1:14:33.980 --> 1:14:40.980]  And it backfires in record numbers of Hispanic Americans and black Americans voting for Trump seeing through it.
[1:14:40.980 --> 1:14:49.980]  But those that are susceptible to the programming when they even turn it up more to try to keep them on the plantation, they get more violent.
[1:14:49.980 --> 1:14:51.980]  You understand?
[1:14:51.980 --> 1:14:57.980]  And so then that creates a perception that there's this bigger racist backlash against white people going on,
[1:14:57.980 --> 1:15:03.980]  which is meant to create the perception of whites actually getting into character and acting racist.
[1:15:03.980 --> 1:15:07.980]  It's social engineering and they think we're dumb. They're stirring us up against each other.
[1:15:07.980 --> 1:15:11.980]  It's stupid and we shouldn't do it and we shouldn't be part of it.
[1:15:11.980 --> 1:15:16.980]  But that doesn't mean then we virtue virtue signal and then adopt all the nomenclature of the left.
[1:15:16.980 --> 1:15:21.980]  We don't adopt any of that.
[1:15:21.980 --> 1:15:27.980]  But we destroy them with the truth and prosperity by going, we're not going to have reparations of people.
[1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:30.980]  Almost no whites in America had any ancestors that owned slaves.
[1:15:30.980 --> 1:15:33.980]  Most people immigrated here after slavery even ended.
[1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:37.980]  Even then it was 2% of the families that had slaves. What do you mean reparations?
[1:15:37.980 --> 1:15:42.980]  But we agree there's been economic degradation and segregation and problems that did economically suppress people.
[1:15:42.980 --> 1:15:47.980]  So Trump wants a special tax incentives and tax cuts for black people.
[1:15:47.980 --> 1:15:51.980]  And conservatives are like, yay! Could you ever get the left to get something through?
[1:15:51.980 --> 1:15:55.980]  But they wouldn't do that because they don't want you to have your own money.
[1:15:55.980 --> 1:16:01.980]  They want strings attached to it.
[1:16:01.980 --> 1:16:09.980]  You know, I'm going to go to these clips and I'm going to cover the news.
[1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:18.980]  But let's play the clip here of sorry, let me get to it, of these sorry, sorry, sorry dumbed down people.
[1:16:18.980 --> 1:16:24.980]  People have to die anti-Trump protesters calls for violence on CNN.
[1:16:24.980 --> 1:16:27.980]  Let's play this clip and by the way, this is just the stuff being caught on video.
[1:16:27.980 --> 1:16:30.980]  And there are scores of these videos coming out every hour.
[1:16:30.980 --> 1:16:37.980]  As the media says, oh good, look at the good people out protesting, never calling it racial assault, never calling it attacks.
[1:16:37.980 --> 1:16:42.980]  People have to die anti-Trump protesters calls for violence on CNN.
[1:16:42.980 --> 1:16:46.980]  And boy, does this woman look like she's done any killing?
[1:16:46.980 --> 1:16:48.980]  She look like she can do any killing?
[1:16:48.980 --> 1:16:55.980]  I love how it's always the softest, dumbest people that are the ones talking about violence.
[1:16:55.980 --> 1:17:01.980]  Cupcake, if the globals are ever successful and really kick off a full-scale civil war,
[1:17:01.980 --> 1:17:06.980]  let me explain something to you and your controllers like George Soros very slowly.
[1:17:06.980 --> 1:17:08.980]  I told you you were going to lose this election.
[1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:11.980]  I told you a tsunami would block even your election fraud.
[1:17:11.980 --> 1:17:15.980]  I told you they were going to release pedophilia on your bosses and devil worship.
[1:17:15.980 --> 1:17:17.980]  It did get released.
[1:17:17.980 --> 1:17:20.980]  Now, you have to understand something.
[1:17:20.980 --> 1:17:26.980]  Next face, if you're dumb enough to actually start a big bloody civil war in this country,
[1:17:26.980 --> 1:17:28.980]  it's not going to go the way you thought it was.
[1:17:28.980 --> 1:17:30.980]  Guarantee.
[1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:34.980]  And last time I checked, sweetheart, looking at the folks out there on the streets,
[1:17:34.980 --> 1:17:36.980]  I don't care if they're black, white, Hispanic.
[1:17:36.980 --> 1:17:42.980]  They are the dumbest-looking, soulless-looking, softest, punkish morons I've ever seen.
[1:17:42.980 --> 1:17:52.980]  You folks couldn't lead an insurrection robbing a Walmart.
[1:17:52.980 --> 1:17:55.980]  I mean, what are black Friday mobs going to do, huh?
[1:17:55.980 --> 1:17:57.980]  Give me a break.
[1:17:57.980 --> 1:18:00.980]  You're dumbasses and you're jokes.
[1:18:00.980 --> 1:18:04.980]  And you're following people that have oppressed you and used you.
[1:18:04.980 --> 1:18:07.980]  But even though you've been through all the psychological brainwashing,
[1:18:07.980 --> 1:18:11.980]  you sit here in the lap of luxury eating so much food it's killing you.
[1:18:11.980 --> 1:18:13.980]  Look, I've been fat too. I'm not criticizing anybody that's fat.
[1:18:13.980 --> 1:18:16.980]  But just look at almost everyone running around bitching.
[1:18:16.980 --> 1:18:19.980]  They're young. They're stupid. They weigh twice as much as they should.
[1:18:19.980 --> 1:18:21.980]  They're living in La La Land.
[1:18:21.980 --> 1:18:23.980]  This country's not free. You're just giant and fat.
[1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:31.980]  You've got so much food. I mean, there are people starving all over the world.
[1:18:31.980 --> 1:18:34.980]  It's a joke.
[1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:36.980]  So let's play this lady. Here it is.
[1:18:36.980 --> 1:18:38.980]  Lily, Lily, your sign.
[1:18:38.980 --> 1:18:41.980]  Our lives begin to end today.
[1:18:41.980 --> 1:18:44.980]  We become silent about the things that matter.
[1:18:44.980 --> 1:18:46.980]  If we don't fight, who's going to fight for us?
[1:18:46.980 --> 1:18:49.980]  People had to die for freedom where we're at today.
[1:18:49.980 --> 1:18:52.980]  We can't just do rallies. We have to fight back.
[1:18:52.980 --> 1:18:55.980]  There will be casualties on both sides.
[1:18:55.980 --> 1:18:59.980]  That won't be because people have to die to make a change in this world.
[1:18:59.980 --> 1:19:00.980]  I know.
[1:19:00.980 --> 1:19:02.980]  Enough with your racism. Stop splitting families.
[1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:05.980]  Don't split my family.
[1:19:05.980 --> 1:19:08.980]  And you're fearful that you're going to lose friends and relatives.
[1:19:08.980 --> 1:19:11.980]  Let me address this.
[1:19:11.980 --> 1:19:14.980]  I go down to Cancun once a year or so because it's a two-hour flight from Austin.
[1:19:14.980 --> 1:19:17.980]  It's direct. Go down there and get some sun, whatever.
[1:19:17.980 --> 1:19:22.980]  I mean, they give you a visas tag and one time I lost it.
[1:19:22.980 --> 1:19:25.980]  And they literally almost arrested me, flipped out with everybody's stuff,
[1:19:25.980 --> 1:19:27.980]  and said, why don't you have the tag?
[1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:29.980]  You've got to be out the day we say.
[1:19:29.980 --> 1:19:31.980]  And I said, this is the day. They're like, you said five days.
[1:19:31.980 --> 1:19:33.980]  This is the sixth day. And I went, I filled it out wrong.
[1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:36.980]  Because they had, you know, my dad's was with us.
[1:19:36.980 --> 1:19:38.980]  I mean, our families separated.
[1:19:38.980 --> 1:19:40.980]  I mean, every other country, you've got to come in legal.
[1:19:40.980 --> 1:19:41.980]  You've got to go out legal.
[1:19:41.980 --> 1:19:43.980]  And Trump's actually going to create a system where you can just,
[1:19:43.980 --> 1:19:45.980]  if you don't have a bunch of felonies, you just come right back in.
[1:19:45.980 --> 1:19:47.980]  Give me a break.
[1:19:47.980 --> 1:19:49.980]  Our borders are wide open, dummy.
[1:19:49.980 --> 1:19:51.980]  But you just sit there.
[1:19:51.980 --> 1:19:54.980]  I can't.
[1:19:54.980 --> 1:20:03.980]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in,
[1:20:03.980 --> 1:20:06.980]  one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about on the debates or anywhere
[1:20:06.980 --> 1:20:11.980]  is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential for power grid chaos.
[1:20:11.980 --> 1:20:17.980]  EMP, cyber warfare, onto mentioned dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms,
[1:20:17.980 --> 1:20:19.980]  all a very real threat to our grid.
[1:20:19.980 --> 1:20:22.980]  My friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot worse.
[1:20:22.980 --> 1:20:26.980]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce
[1:20:26.980 --> 1:20:28.980]  their own supply of backup electricity.
[1:20:28.980 --> 1:20:32.980]  Now, I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house,
[1:20:32.980 --> 1:20:34.980]  the solutions from science system.

[1:21:58.980 --> 1:22:00.980]  Hi, my name is Stephen Holstein.
[1:22:00.980 --> 1:22:05.980]  In my 20s, I had used stimulant and anabolic steroids to the point where my adrenal glands were shot.
[1:22:05.980 --> 1:22:08.980]  I suffered from extreme fatigue and inability to handle stress.
[1:22:08.980 --> 1:22:15.980]  For over six years, I had been taking adrenal supplements including herbs, glandulars, vitamin C, and vitamin B5.
[1:22:15.980 --> 1:22:18.980]  All these supplements did was treat the symptoms and produced only minimal results.
[1:22:18.980 --> 1:22:23.980]  Now, just after one month on Synergy 1 and ADR medics, I truly feel rejuvenated.
[1:22:23.980 --> 1:22:27.980]  I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement.
[1:22:27.980 --> 1:22:30.980]  I did just ten minutes after taking ADR medics.
[1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:34.980]  I then noticed Synergy 1 made me wake up rested and with much more energy.
[1:22:34.980 --> 1:22:37.980]  No more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising.
[1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:42.980]  I had almost considered going to another country for stem cell therapy as the last resort.
[1:22:42.980 --> 1:22:46.980]  But now, I truly feel rejuvenated on Synergy 1 and ADR medics.
[1:22:46.980 --> 1:22:48.980]  Success happens with synergistic nutrition.

[1:24:05.980 --> 1:24:11.980]  The toll-free number to join us on this live Thursday Global Broadcast is 800-25 at 992-31800.
[1:24:11.980 --> 1:24:16.980]  Coming up, we're going to be taking your calls and I'm going to get to a bunch of the clips I haven't covered yet.
[1:24:16.980 --> 1:24:22.980]  Obviously, we've got Trump going to meet with Obama at the White House and going to meet with Republicans as well.
[1:24:22.980 --> 1:24:27.980]  Hillary says that we should let there be a peaceful transference of power yesterday,
[1:24:27.980 --> 1:24:31.980]  but I told everybody, Soros is only going to double down with the decentralization and they have.
[1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:39.980]  So that's all coming up. We have shocking footage of black racist KKK equivalents just beating up innocent white people
[1:24:39.980 --> 1:24:43.980]  because they just said, you're white, you're a Trump supporter. This is happening all over the country.
[1:24:43.980 --> 1:24:47.980]  For every time it's caught on video, I'd say it's happened 300, 400 times.
[1:24:47.980 --> 1:24:50.980]  I mean, the reports from all over Austin, I'm hearing it's bad.
[1:24:50.980 --> 1:24:54.980]  And folks will approach white people and say, are you a Trump?
[1:24:54.980 --> 1:24:58.980]  And then the anger gets so bad that you start beating them or mugging them or attacking them.
[1:24:58.980 --> 1:25:04.980]  And this is all being led by university professor operatives and people in classic social engineering.
[1:25:04.980 --> 1:25:09.980]  It is very, very, very, very, very, very, very sad.
[1:25:09.980 --> 1:25:11.980]  And they're all getting their degrees in this.
[1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:14.980]  You know, used to people wouldn't join the military if they wanted to go fight.
[1:25:14.980 --> 1:25:18.980]  Now women kind of joined the social justice warrior corps.
[1:25:18.980 --> 1:25:22.980]  Then they go out and agitate and then cops get killed, innocent people get beat up.
[1:25:22.980 --> 1:25:26.980]  And it's causing thousands of black people to get killed in Chicago additionally a year
[1:25:26.980 --> 1:25:30.980]  just because now the police are slow rolling and not going into the areas.
[1:25:30.980 --> 1:25:34.980]  But this is true racism. This is the true face of evil.
[1:25:34.980 --> 1:25:38.980]  I mean, I would be just as disgusted if this was five, six white guys beaten up a black person.
[1:25:38.980 --> 1:25:41.980]  In fact, I'd be more disgusted because I'd be ashamed of myself even though I'm not associated with it.
[1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:43.980]  This is very shameful.
[1:25:43.980 --> 1:25:45.980]  Now talk about race-based politics.
[1:25:45.980 --> 1:25:47.980]  The Republicans are the ones that ended it.
[1:25:47.980 --> 1:25:50.980]  They weren't perfect, but that's the party of Lincoln.
[1:25:50.980 --> 1:25:52.980]  And it was the Christians that pushed for all that.
[1:25:52.980 --> 1:25:57.980]  And then people like my grandfather that ran for county government in one after World War II.
[1:25:57.980 --> 1:26:02.980]  The first Republican in that side of the family in ever.
[1:26:02.980 --> 1:26:05.980]  Family didn't ostracize him, but they were mad at him.
[1:26:05.980 --> 1:26:08.980]  But the point was they ended up taking the county over with Republicans.
[1:26:08.980 --> 1:26:12.980]  And they did the desegregation and they cut the taxes.
[1:26:12.980 --> 1:26:18.980]  And let's just say this, quite frankly, growing up there'd be a lot of black folks on Christmas
[1:26:18.980 --> 1:26:22.980]  and in other dates bringing us pies and watermelons and stuff like that.
[1:26:22.980 --> 1:26:25.980]  And so I love my grandfather so much because they did some of the stuff on all the other scenes.
[1:26:25.980 --> 1:26:28.980]  He was a tough guy, my dad's dad's, but it didn't matter.
[1:26:28.980 --> 1:26:33.980]  But it's just particularly weird to be attacked when the KKK actually attacked my family
[1:26:33.980 --> 1:26:34.980]  and they could make a whole movie out of it.
[1:26:34.980 --> 1:26:35.980]  I'm not going to get into it.
[1:26:35.980 --> 1:26:37.980]  It's just too rich.
[1:26:37.980 --> 1:26:38.980]  I'll just leave it to you like that.
[1:26:38.980 --> 1:26:41.980]  Now we see this whole KKK movement going on with Hispanics.
[1:26:41.980 --> 1:26:43.980]  Most Hispanics aren't buying into it.
[1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:45.980]  And I'm not saying that in a patronizing way, it's true.
[1:26:45.980 --> 1:26:47.980]  Demographically, it's just not happening.
[1:26:47.980 --> 1:26:48.980]  It doesn't matter.
[1:26:48.980 --> 1:26:51.980]  It's a few percentage points that push us over the edge.
[1:26:51.980 --> 1:26:57.980]  So Buckley had the idea to overlay Google Maps of the counties that went red and that went blue.
[1:26:57.980 --> 1:27:03.980]  And then to overlay the only areas in the sea of red that went blue.
[1:27:03.980 --> 1:27:06.980]  Every sanctuary city went blue.
[1:27:06.980 --> 1:27:08.980]  This is the demographic warfare.
[1:27:08.980 --> 1:27:13.980]  Now imagine in Mexico or anywhere else if America was saying send our people down there by the millions
[1:27:13.980 --> 1:27:16.980]  and then vote to turn it over to our form of government.
[1:27:16.980 --> 1:27:17.980]  They would arrest you.
[1:27:17.980 --> 1:27:18.980]  This is sedition.
[1:27:18.980 --> 1:27:20.980]  So Buckley, I'm glad you found this.
[1:27:20.980 --> 1:27:21.980]  This is amazing.
[1:27:21.980 --> 1:27:23.980]  I'm going to give this to Don Salazar or Paul Watson.
[1:27:23.980 --> 1:27:25.980]  They tend to do the immigration beat.
[1:27:25.980 --> 1:27:26.980]  But this is stunning.
[1:27:26.980 --> 1:27:27.980]  What made you think to do this?
[1:27:27.980 --> 1:27:34.980]  Well, you know, I was watching the show and I was watching all the episodes of all the violence that has been caused across the nation.
[1:27:34.980 --> 1:27:40.980]  And we all know, of course, that this is all being funded by sorrows and all the globalists that are trying to destabilize the country
[1:27:40.980 --> 1:27:47.980]  by influencing these poor people, influencing their minds and trying to bring the hatred up inside of them.
[1:27:47.980 --> 1:27:52.980]  You know, for instance, here in Austin, they blocked off the major, one of the major bridges here, arteries.
[1:27:52.980 --> 1:27:54.980]  It took me over an hour and a half to get home.
[1:27:54.980 --> 1:27:57.980]  In fact, I just stopped at a coffee shop and just read magazine's drink coffee.
[1:27:57.980 --> 1:28:07.980]  But the point is, is that there were lines and lines of buses waiting just about six blocks away ready to, they had brought these people and ready to spirit them away.
[1:28:07.980 --> 1:28:11.980]  And then they attacked police, police cars here, did a bunch of other stuff that were bused in.
[1:28:11.980 --> 1:28:17.980]  And again, I was about three miles from this and literally had people bowing up to me and stuff because I was white.
[1:28:17.980 --> 1:28:20.980]  And I was just like, man, imagine like a little white guy or a woman.
[1:28:20.980 --> 1:28:23.980]  I mean, I mean, I don't want to listen.
[1:28:23.980 --> 1:28:24.980]  I got kids, folks.
[1:28:24.980 --> 1:28:26.980]  I don't want to hurt people, but I'm going to do another mode now.
[1:28:26.980 --> 1:28:27.980]  Exactly.
[1:28:27.980 --> 1:28:30.980]  The thing that this proves, though, is that this was not an organic uprising.
[1:28:30.980 --> 1:28:39.980]  It wasn't people that were there that are sickened by some political circumstance, you know, and have a righteousness and hitting the streets.
[1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:41.980]  It's people that are bought and paid for.
[1:28:41.980 --> 1:28:46.980]  Yeah, if people rioted in New York over the devil worship and the pedophile stuff, I'd be like, let's join them.
[1:28:46.980 --> 1:28:47.980]  Exactly.
[1:28:47.980 --> 1:28:48.980]  No, no, no.
[1:28:48.980 --> 1:28:53.980]  It's not we're going after the devil worshipers or people that actually did something or some child molester that got off.
[1:28:53.980 --> 1:28:55.980]  We were just randomly beating white people up.
[1:28:55.980 --> 1:28:56.980]  Right.
[1:28:56.980 --> 1:29:03.980]  So as I was watching these videos and I saw all the usual suspects, I saw Mecha, La Raza, I saw the communists.
[1:29:03.980 --> 1:29:10.980]  I saw the same people that are always at the front of these groups leading them with the bandanas over their heads so they can't be identified.
[1:29:10.980 --> 1:29:15.980]  And I thought to myself, wait a minute, what is the driving force behind this?
[1:29:15.980 --> 1:29:23.980]  And really, I was listening to this guy who is a city councilman here in Austin on NPR yesterday.
[1:29:23.980 --> 1:29:36.980]  And he was talking about how he was so scared that Donald Trump was going to influence the cities that are right now allowing for all immigrants to just be here.
[1:29:36.980 --> 1:29:37.980]  Period.
[1:29:37.980 --> 1:29:38.980]  That's right.
[1:29:38.980 --> 1:29:46.980]  It is a UN, it is a UN immunization program worldwide to ignore the national government have cities shell out to it.
[1:29:46.980 --> 1:29:47.980]  This is an admitted program.
[1:29:47.980 --> 1:29:48.980]  We'll be back.
[1:29:48.980 --> 1:29:59.980]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:59.980 --> 1:30:07.980]  Now we're just two months away from January 2017 when President Trump takes power, but let's take a look at how his tax plan may impact your returns.
[1:30:07.980 --> 1:30:12.980]  NBC is reporting if Trump sticks to his campaign promises, here are the major things his administration will change.
[1:30:12.980 --> 1:30:17.980]  They'll reduce seven federal tax brackets down to three with rates of 12%, 25% and 33%.
[1:30:17.980 --> 1:30:25.980]  Increases in the standard deduction from $6,300 to $15,000 for single filers and from $12,600 to $30,000 for married couples.
[1:30:25.980 --> 1:30:33.980]  The irony is all those Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires, athletes and rock stars that all supported Hillary Clinton are going to be seeing some of the biggest tax returns.
[1:30:33.980 --> 1:30:39.980]  In fact, Forbes is reporting that Trump's tax plan could save LeBron James over $15 million per year.
[1:30:39.980 --> 1:30:48.980]  But the coup de gras in Trump's tax plan will be lowering the business tax rate from 35% to 15% and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.
[1:30:48.980 --> 1:30:55.980]  This is going to unleash a rash of hirings across the country and hopefully bring businesses who moved overseas back to the United States, thereby increasing jobs.

[1:32:17.980 --> 1:32:32.980]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[1:32:32.980 --> 1:32:35.980]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.
[1:32:35.980 --> 1:32:58.980]  Heritage, mom and apple pie, and beef was for supper.
[1:33:05.980 --> 1:33:16.980]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.980 --> 1:33:27.980]  What we're seeing is 21st century warfare. We are seeing the attempted tech-down of the number one most wealthy powerful nation that has built an empire.
[1:33:27.980 --> 1:33:35.980]  You're seeing it be captured by multinational corporations using the oldest trick in the book, divide and conquer.
[1:33:35.980 --> 1:33:45.980]  To create a race class war in the country and the horrible, evil universities spewing out people with worthless degrees.
[1:33:45.980 --> 1:33:52.980]  Huge hordes of idiot graduate students leading race mobs.
[1:33:52.980 --> 1:34:02.980]  And man, you talk about evil. You look at these white professors and these people that are stirring all this up, they know exactly what they're doing.
[1:34:02.980 --> 1:34:12.980]  Behind closed doors to a man, I've talked to him, many of them. They start laughing and they go, of course we're taking over, of course it's manipulation.
[1:34:12.980 --> 1:34:18.980]  They think they're so smart buckly because they know how to screw somebody. And I'm tired of them.
[1:34:18.980 --> 1:34:23.980]  What do you want to say to folks out there? Because we're going to go back over this map in a moment. We've added another graphic in there we're going to show.
[1:34:23.980 --> 1:34:26.980]  But for radio listeners, describe what we're looking at here.
[1:34:26.980 --> 1:34:32.980]  Well, basically I spent a lot of my time up here at Info Wars looking at metrics of all different types.
[1:34:32.980 --> 1:34:37.980]  Whether it's viewership or it's marketing or sales.
[1:34:37.980 --> 1:34:45.980]  So I'm always looking at different numbers and I was going through a lot of the different maps from the election today.
[1:34:45.980 --> 1:35:00.980]  Kind of reviewing different circumstances and I saw this really dramatic map that just showed a sea of red that basically the vast majority of the area in the United States voted Republican and for Trump.
[1:35:00.980 --> 1:35:09.980]  And there you see it right there. I don't know what the percentage is, but I would say that's probably 90% of the geographic landmass voted for Trump.
[1:35:09.980 --> 1:35:12.980]  Now, of course we all know that people are concentrated in cities.
[1:35:12.980 --> 1:35:18.980]  I think your dead record is right. I think that's right about 90%. In fact, I was seeing them say that last night. It's about 90% geographically.
[1:35:18.980 --> 1:35:29.980]  But then if you overlay the admitted sanctuary cities where they ignore the federal law and give the illegals all this free stuff, which then further banks reps the city, but brings in more political control and then more federal dollars.
[1:35:29.980 --> 1:35:36.980]  If you look at it, it's every piece of blue in the sea of red is an admitted command base.
[1:35:36.980 --> 1:35:48.980]  And it's funny you brought this up because we were exposing just 21 years ago and we got some of their internal maps where they were admitting they have all these triangles where they triangulate the blue with the red.
[1:35:48.980 --> 1:36:02.980]  And they have five and 10 and 20 year maps like like like the communists in China. It's crazy how they're going to bring people in to those and then expand like pieces on a board to then take over the states.
[1:36:02.980 --> 1:36:10.980]  And that's what I'm saying. It's military precision, folks. It's military dedication, military precision and understand.
[1:36:10.980 --> 1:36:18.980]  I wouldn't care if we brought in 3040 million people from Latin America, if they don't have criminal backgrounds and they're hardworking. That's we need people.
[1:36:18.980 --> 1:36:28.980]  That's fine with me. The great, wonderful, but they bring in many of the unwashed, the politicos, they bring them in, they brainwash them, they piss them off.
[1:36:28.980 --> 1:36:35.980]  They turn them into communists and socialists and la raza and listen, you were born in Guatemala. You lived there until you were eight.
[1:36:35.980 --> 1:36:42.980]  You know, with your dad and mom and the rest of the family and you grew up on the streets of Guatemala City.
[1:36:42.980 --> 1:36:46.980]  And I mean, I remember when you were a kid, you stay with us, you know, like you dream in Spanish back then.
[1:36:46.980 --> 1:36:52.980]  I hear somebody talking to Spanish wake up, you know, you in the bunk bed next to me and you've been a DJ and before that a bartender and all the jobs.
[1:36:52.980 --> 1:36:57.980]  I mean, you have experience because you speak fluent Spanish. The type of racist stuff is not most people speak Spanish, but it's a good percentage.
[1:36:57.980 --> 1:37:01.980]  They're just like everybody else. There's races out there, but there's this attitude and they're always shocked.
[1:37:01.980 --> 1:37:05.980]  You know, come back at them with Spanish. But this is just the reality. This is going on.
[1:37:05.980 --> 1:37:16.980]  This isn't about Spanish speaking people conquering America. It's about coming in and being run by the Ford Foundation and by globalists like George Soros and being used to kill a birthright.
[1:37:16.980 --> 1:37:20.980]  That if you become a citizen of lower taxes and guns and freedom and what made America great.
[1:37:20.980 --> 1:37:26.980]  And if you look at Hispanic culture on average, it's one of the most compatible systems of what the real culture is with Americana.
[1:37:26.980 --> 1:37:31.980]  In fact, you see Hispanics love Americana. In fact, everybody else is abandoning it.
[1:37:31.980 --> 1:37:40.980]  It seems to be Hispanics that are embracing it. So it's this juxtaposed of Hispanics that aren't these brainwashing camps and ever go out and have a job and live or successful and love it.
[1:37:40.980 --> 1:37:44.980]  But the new world order is totally betting on you to win and bring down the country.
[1:37:44.980 --> 1:37:49.980]  I'm asking how do we bet on you to save it and be the future that you are? It's your country.
[1:37:49.980 --> 1:37:57.980]  It's going to be 70% Hispanic in like 30 years. It's yours. Are you going to let them con you out of stealing it and blowing it up?
[1:37:57.980 --> 1:37:59.980]  I mean, this is crazy. So what do you want to say, Buckley?
[1:37:59.980 --> 1:38:08.980]  Well, I think that's a great point because there's this liberal ideology that they sort of own, you know, the minorities, i.e. the blacks or the Hispanics.
[1:38:08.980 --> 1:38:27.980]  But if you go into these neighborhoods, you'll see that Hispanics are primarily Catholic, they're primarily conservative, they're primarily really hardworking people who want low taxes and they want prosperity and they want to have a good environment for small businesses to thrive in.
[1:38:27.980 --> 1:38:32.980]  Now, if you think about the ideologies of the left versus the ideologies of the right, who are they aligned with?
[1:38:32.980 --> 1:38:41.980]  You know, but however, the liberals all think that just because these people are of different colored skin, they're not white, that somehow they owe their allegiance to liberals.
[1:38:41.980 --> 1:38:46.980]  And that is just, to me, that's actually one of the most intense forms of racism.
[1:38:46.980 --> 1:38:52.980]  And when just 40 years ago, it was the Democrats saying, don't let Hispanics in the country.
[1:38:52.980 --> 1:38:53.980]  Exactly.
[1:38:53.980 --> 1:38:59.980]  But then they flipped. They went, oh, Republicans, you're going to end all the race-based stuff. We're just going to flip and take that away from you.
[1:38:59.980 --> 1:39:01.980]  By the way, we're better at race politics than you are.
[1:39:01.980 --> 1:39:11.980]  Exactly. And so one of the things that has really been a stark contrast for me in this election is if you go and you look at all the communications and everything that Donald Trump said, he is always talking about the people.
[1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:19.980]  He's always talking about how we're going to bring the country up, fix the infrastructure, you know, let mothers be able to stay home longer with their children.
[1:39:19.980 --> 1:39:27.980]  Lots of really compassionate, constructive stuff. And we go back and we dig through all those Podesta emails and all the emails in between Hillary and Huma Abedain.
[1:39:27.980 --> 1:39:34.980]  Not one, not one email about them talking about how they're going to better the environment for the American public.
[1:39:34.980 --> 1:39:41.980]  All it was was self-serving stuff. And so that boils down to me. To me, that boils down to the fact that they know that they have minorities hoodwinked.
[1:39:41.980 --> 1:39:51.980]  They know that they have them by the hook. And it's only this ideology, it's only this concept and this idea that they have so deeply ingrained into their society.
[1:39:51.980 --> 1:39:57.980]  I agree. It's total entitlement. And the New York Times have this Trump's Last Stand and they talk about memos they've gotten and people they talk to.
[1:39:57.980 --> 1:40:05.980]  They're like, Trump's insecure. He's always asking people and working with people about how he can make minorities like him and what he can do for them.
[1:40:05.980 --> 1:40:13.980]  He's pathetic. This is like, oh, we have secret stuff. He really wants to figure out how to fix things. Meanwhile, he got Podesta emails and he's dumb black people.
[1:40:13.980 --> 1:40:19.980]  And I want to rip this person off. I'll see you at the devil worship meeting. We've got plenty of blood and semen for you to drink.
[1:40:19.980 --> 1:40:27.980]  Yeah, it's disgusting. And I think it just really illustrates the core of what their souls are like, you know, what their ambitions are.
[1:40:27.980 --> 1:40:29.980]  Their ambitions aren't for the betterment of society.
[1:40:29.980 --> 1:40:33.980]  I just want prosperity, but then don't do it at my expense and tell me I'm inherently bad.
[1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:34.980]  Exactly.
[1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:36.980]  This is nothing but dumb down tribalism.
[1:40:36.980 --> 1:40:45.980]  And the thing that's nauseating is that the media has been in lockstep with them on this. The media has just really just amplified their message, their PR message.
[1:40:45.980 --> 1:40:58.980]  Well, I've always said, and one of the next things we should do is we need to get a couple folks to understand what's going on to speak fluent Spanish and create a Spanish version radio and TV show every day to just turn this information out.
[1:40:58.980 --> 1:41:01.980]  Because this is key in the battle and the next phase.
[1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:03.980]  Buckley, what do you want to say to folks in Spanish?
[1:41:03.980 --> 1:41:19.980]  Well, I'm sorry about my Spanish because I'm forgetting a lot, but I swear that we here at Infowars are working for you. We're working for the country, for all the people there who are suffering and who are working hard.
[1:41:19.980 --> 1:41:34.980]  And maybe sometimes it's difficult to understand, but if you continue to know here at Infowars and listen to what we have to do, you will understand. I swear.
[1:41:50.980 --> 1:42:00.980]  To overthrow the country, merge us into Mexico and Canada and get rid of everybody's sovereignty and exploit everyone. And then they're bringing in all these third world populations forget.
[1:42:00.980 --> 1:42:08.980]  We talk about Mexicans all day. It's now Chinese, the main group. They're bringing them in as a new permanent underclass to exploit.
[1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:26.980]  And then you get the memos. They admit they're exploiting. They admit they want to drive down wages. They admit they want to get rid of a middle class. It's the thing is, it's so diabolical that if people ever get how diabolical the Democrats and the Republican leadership are, they're over forever because folks, they're true villains.
[1:42:26.980 --> 1:42:33.980]  And people say, well, why is that? Because sociopaths and psychopaths start recruiting other psychopaths in and other control freaks and other mercenaries.
[1:42:33.980 --> 1:42:42.980]  So at a certain point, it's a flash point. If you're not in the meetings going screw these people, I love lying to them. It's a trash. I'll see the devil works for me. Good. I'll see you later.
[1:42:42.980 --> 1:42:59.980]  You know, you're like, whoa, this is like Twilight Zone. They're so evil. That's how history is. They're a very small group of people. Black, white, you know, anybody who's a psychopath, a sociopath, a mercenary, a sadist, it's a lot of different groups, but they all fit together in kind of legions of doom.
[1:42:59.980 --> 1:43:08.980]  And so you either in history dominate and defeat them or they run everything. There's no in between. These aren't people you co-exist with because they're never going to co-exist.
[1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:18.980]  I mean, I finally saw another Hillary sticker last night. In fact, I think there's some video of it. And it was the first time I saw a Hillary sticker where they weren't in the fast lane.
[1:43:18.980 --> 1:43:21.980]  So blocking everybody that normally that's, you know, who's doing it.
[1:43:21.980 --> 1:43:23.980]  That's a pretty good analogy right there.
[1:43:23.980 --> 1:43:27.980]  No, I'm serious. Always. I see somebody in the fast lane going slow, although they're going to have Democrats there.
[1:43:27.980 --> 1:43:29.980]  And they call themselves progressives.
[1:43:29.980 --> 1:43:30.980]  Oh, they're going to have a co-exist sticker.
[1:43:30.980 --> 1:43:31.980]  That's the irony.
[1:43:31.980 --> 1:43:39.980]  Exactly. So I, yeah, they're blocking my life. So I get up there and it says, you know, we need to stop war, peace on Earth.
[1:43:39.980 --> 1:43:42.980]  And then love Trump's hate.
[1:43:42.980 --> 1:43:48.980]  Trump around the world, all the top analysts say he's the detente, he's the peace stick. Hillary's World War Three.
[1:43:48.980 --> 1:43:54.980]  But here they are with their Democrat and Hillary stickers and they've got a peace on Earth deal.
[1:43:54.980 --> 1:43:57.980]  Again, it is congruent with reality. It's not real.
[1:43:57.980 --> 1:44:03.980]  Yeah, I honestly, you know, feel bad for these people that have to walk around all day with this cognitive dissonance in their head.
[1:44:03.980 --> 1:44:09.980]  You know, repeatedly telling themselves that whatever the mantra is, you know, I'm good. I'm not racist. I'm good.
[1:44:09.980 --> 1:44:12.980]  Whatever they have to do in their head to justify, you know.
[1:44:12.980 --> 1:44:23.980]  Look, we got rid of a lot of the henpecking, Bible thumping, you know, oppressive, Pharisee style, control freak Christianity that isn't real Christianity.
[1:44:23.980 --> 1:44:26.980]  OK, so we've gotten rid of a lot of that Victorian stuff.
[1:44:26.980 --> 1:44:29.980]  And so, but it all passed on to political correctness.
[1:44:29.980 --> 1:44:37.980]  So these, these, these are the same as people screaming at you on the street telling you, you've got to go to their church and you're with the devil because you're, you know, your wife's wearing high heels.
[1:44:37.980 --> 1:44:41.980]  You know, those are folks that drive people away from Christianity. OK, it's the same thing.
[1:44:41.980 --> 1:44:43.980]  It's just like, you're a racist, you're a, hey, hey, hey.
[1:44:43.980 --> 1:44:46.980]  It's just not even, you're like, get out of my way, man. What is your problem?
[1:44:46.980 --> 1:44:48.980]  Which is the actual inverse of tolerance.
[1:44:48.980 --> 1:44:52.980]  And if you go out on social media and you see how all these, you know,
[1:44:52.980 --> 1:45:02.980]  Hilt, Hiltards, I don't know what they're calling them these days, but all the people that are, that are, that are basically, you know, following, following Hillary over the cliff, you know, how vicious they are and how nasty they are.
[1:45:02.980 --> 1:45:05.980]  And, and that's the, it's the inversion.
[1:45:05.980 --> 1:45:10.980]  Oh, Troyer found the most insane women ever where we can't show because it's almost all cussing.
[1:45:10.980 --> 1:45:16.980]  They are screaming like, like zombies in a movie, scrabbling at, you know, trying to get in or something.
[1:45:16.980 --> 1:45:19.980]  They're just like completely out of their minds.
[1:45:19.980 --> 1:45:22.980]  And it's why he's doing nothing to them.
[1:45:22.980 --> 1:45:24.980]  Right. Well, but that's what they're trained for.
[1:45:24.980 --> 1:45:33.980]  They, they're trained that if, if they're louder than you are, then they have the right to overpower you with their voice, even though what they're saying doesn't make any rational sense.
[1:45:33.980 --> 1:45:46.980]  And so, you know, to bring this all the way back to, to what we were talking about with the sanctuary cities and Soros is that the globalists are trying their damnedest to get inside and destabilize this country from the inside, cause, cause divisiveness,
[1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:55.980]  and try to, to get us fighting each other. Because if you look at it from, from the perspective, if you, if you back way out, the globalists are point zero, zero, zero, zero, one percent.
[1:45:55.980 --> 1:45:58.980]  And all they do is they're on a really, really long lever.
[1:45:58.980 --> 1:46:05.980]  And all they can do is throw a whole bunch of money at people to get them angry and freaked out about an imaginary circumstance.
[1:46:05.980 --> 1:46:10.980]  And if we can break their conditioning, if we can break through the lies and break through.
[1:46:10.980 --> 1:46:18.980]  Well, that's it, because, because it creates a, it creates real uncomfortableness where, you know, people are getting attacked all over Austin.
[1:46:18.980 --> 1:46:22.980]  I mean, all the people are going, yeah, this person got attacked, yeah, they got attacked yesterday, yeah, yeah, people got attacked last night.
[1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:27.980]  I mean, I mean, now I've got to like watch where I pull in. This is what the evil media has done.
[1:46:27.980 --> 1:46:28.980]  Exactly.
[1:46:28.980 --> 1:46:32.980]  And now that's going to create real racism because not everybody is sophisticated like I am.
[1:46:32.980 --> 1:46:37.980]  That's true. Well, here we are at Info Wars and we don't, like you always say, we don't always get it a hundred percent right.
[1:46:37.980 --> 1:46:41.980]  You know, we're just sort of looking at the tea leaves and digging through all the information.
[1:46:41.980 --> 1:46:48.980]  But at the very least, we're getting a big wide swath of information and comparing historical context to what is happening right now.
[1:46:48.980 --> 1:46:56.980]  And I believe that right now in this election, I mean, we have, we've quadrupled in size as far as our audience is concerned, as far as our reach is concerned.
[1:46:56.980 --> 1:46:58.980]  And we're, we're winning this war.
[1:46:58.980 --> 1:47:06.980]  And by the way, if all the new listeners just tell somebody else about it again, like the last wave did, and then another wave, we're going to have, I don't even want to say this on air,
[1:47:06.980 --> 1:47:14.980]  because right now with the election, let's not exaggerate, our last peak was about 30-something million people in a week, one way or another, tuning in.
[1:47:14.980 --> 1:47:26.980]  I can announce to folks that on current trends, by Sunday, by Sunday, I think, conservatively, we would have had 80 million people that we can actually register,
[1:47:26.980 --> 1:47:31.980]  register real IP addresses, real videos watched, ratings we can check with stations.
[1:47:31.980 --> 1:47:38.980]  I mean, right now we're sitting at 65 million conservatively, 65 million people.
[1:47:38.980 --> 1:47:42.980]  Let me say this, because Alex, Alex is actually a really humble person in real life.
[1:47:42.980 --> 1:47:43.980]  He's a really humble person.
[1:47:43.980 --> 1:47:46.980]  He gets on here and he screams and he shouts and he gets really intense because he's trying to get your attention.
[1:47:46.980 --> 1:48:00.980]  But one of the things that Alex has done is that he has taken almost 90% of the funds that we generate here at Infowars and put them back into, into the system, into what we are building.
[1:48:00.980 --> 1:48:02.980]  And people, I've seen it a hundred times.
[1:48:02.980 --> 1:48:08.980]  People who haven't been here in a year in our offices show up and go, oh my God, wow, this is huge.
[1:48:08.980 --> 1:48:09.980]  This is twice as big.
[1:48:09.980 --> 1:48:10.980]  This is amazing.
[1:48:10.980 --> 1:48:11.980]  Look what you guys are doing.
[1:48:11.980 --> 1:48:15.980]  And so that's what Alex has been doing for 20 years, year over year.
[1:48:15.980 --> 1:48:17.980]  We've been growing almost exponentially.
[1:48:17.980 --> 1:48:19.980]  And the reason why is because he's not greedy.
[1:48:19.980 --> 1:48:29.980]  The reason why is because he believes in this in his heart and he's putting all of the effort that he has, including all of the monetary resources that we get and build back into,
[1:48:29.980 --> 1:48:30.980]  Infowars.
[1:48:30.980 --> 1:48:36.980]  And let's expand on why, why I use military terminology because the globalist, it is military.
[1:48:36.980 --> 1:48:38.980]  This is a scientific attack, folks.
[1:48:38.980 --> 1:48:39.980]  Think of it as space aliens.
[1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:40.980]  It's not space aliens.
[1:48:40.980 --> 1:48:49.980]  But what I'm saying is the technocrats see themselves as a breakaway civilization and they're doing things chemically, culturally, everything like they're better than us to play us off.
[1:48:49.980 --> 1:48:51.980]  And as long as we don't know the experiments going on, they're going to win.
[1:48:51.980 --> 1:48:55.980]  We're here to show the experiments happening and I know this is the takeover.
[1:48:55.980 --> 1:48:56.980]  I get chills.
[1:48:56.980 --> 1:48:59.980]  I know they're predators, like a guy breaking in my house, man.
[1:48:59.980 --> 1:49:01.980]  But I have the energy to stop them.
[1:49:01.980 --> 1:49:02.980]  I'm not special.
[1:49:02.980 --> 1:49:04.980]  We're under attack, folks.
[1:49:04.980 --> 1:49:05.980]  Here's the beautiful part.
[1:49:05.980 --> 1:49:08.980]  Here's the beautiful part is that we are not beholden to anybody.
[1:49:08.980 --> 1:49:09.980]  We're not beholden to anybody.
[1:49:09.980 --> 1:49:11.980]  We don't answer to George Soros.
[1:49:11.980 --> 1:49:13.980]  We don't answer to any huge corporations.
[1:49:13.980 --> 1:49:15.980]  We don't answer to our advertisers or anything.
[1:49:15.980 --> 1:49:17.980]  We can say what we believe here.
[1:49:17.980 --> 1:49:21.980]  And that's why what you get here is 99.9% of the truth.
[1:49:21.980 --> 1:49:26.980]  Sometimes you're wrong, but that 1% that we're wrong is sure as hell doesn't compare to the 99%.
[1:49:26.980 --> 1:49:27.980]  Right, Alex?
[1:49:27.980 --> 1:49:28.980]  Well, they're trying to lie on purpose.
[1:49:28.980 --> 1:49:30.980]  And speaking of that, we haven't plugged this whole hour.
[1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:33.980]  I want to hire four or five more writers, camera people, editors.
[1:49:33.980 --> 1:49:37.980]  And I think that's probably yet growth-wise because it's just too much to handle.
[1:49:37.980 --> 1:49:39.980]  And that's what we need to take advantage of.
[1:49:39.980 --> 1:49:40.980]  M4warstore.com.

[1:54:59.580 --> 1:55:04.980]  The matter how beautiful the people may be and how amazing their culture there's something twisted there. There's an evil
[1:55:04.980 --> 1:55:15.260]  We're trying to promote freedom worldwide. I'm gonna start the next hour and I'm gonna go right to Andrew and the UK and Dave and David and I

[1:55:24.420 --> 1:55:26.420]  before we go any further
[1:55:26.980 --> 1:55:31.380]  There's a bunch of clips. I mean I tell you Matt does such a great job with the rest of crew getting all these dozens of clips
[1:55:31.380 --> 1:55:36.020]  We have Putin congratulating Trump. We've got
[1:55:37.980 --> 1:55:43.780]  White House doesn't rule out pardoning Hillary that is so huge MSNBC reporters stock exchange chanting walk her up
[1:55:44.900 --> 1:55:47.100]  We've got mass celebrations are up across Russia
[1:55:49.420 --> 1:55:51.180]  Meanwhile, oh
[1:55:51.180 --> 1:55:55.060]  It's not because they're racist is because they don't want World War three and then meanwhile
[1:55:55.060 --> 1:56:00.980]  We've got shock video again black mob viciously beats white Trump supporter emotional clothing supporter Hillary needs to sue the US
[1:56:00.980 --> 1:56:02.980]  This is just so pathetic
[1:56:03.700 --> 1:56:07.740]  And then mainstream media now has picked up the line Van Jones started it a white lash
[1:56:08.260 --> 1:56:13.380]  That's right. We want to make America great again. That means cut the taxes. We've been a depression
[1:56:13.860 --> 1:56:18.660]  The economy's been falling apart for a while most of the cut areas nation look like a bomb hit it
[1:56:19.660 --> 1:56:22.180]  And that's what that means. It doesn't mean a white lash
[1:56:22.180 --> 1:56:29.860]  Was it a big dominant group of white people that voted for Trump absolutely with record numbers of blacks and Hispanics
[1:56:32.260 --> 1:56:39.060]  So sad so nasty so evil so just just absolutely despicable
[1:56:39.660 --> 1:56:42.020]  And I'm gonna say this right now to the establishment
[1:56:43.060 --> 1:56:49.540]  You're arrogant scum like you always become delusional and you always fall the problem is there's nuclear weapons now
[1:56:49.540 --> 1:56:56.900]  So none of us can afford to let you get to the failure point you have to be dealt with and that's why you think the awakenings hardcore now
[1:56:56.900 --> 1:56:59.380]  You've seen nothing the military and the police
[1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:05.820]  Knew I was telling them the truth because they were on the inside and knew that I was aware of real information. I
[1:57:06.660 --> 1:57:09.460]  Reverse engineered it decompartmentalized it so did our guests
[1:57:10.460 --> 1:57:14.220]  Then when you try to launch a civil war the last five years to destabilize things
[1:57:14.220 --> 1:57:19.220]  They completely broke with you and finally figured out it's do or die. They had to choose a side
[1:57:20.180 --> 1:57:23.140]  Rediscovering Americana rediscovering the Republic. It's happened
[1:57:25.540 --> 1:57:29.260]  Not that our government's perfect, but it's not the globalist out to get everybody yet
[1:57:29.860 --> 1:57:34.460]  You know spirit dinners devil worshipping with Alistair Crowley witches. I mean, you know
[1:57:35.140 --> 1:57:37.980]  People get it. You're evil. They've seen the WikiLeaks. They know
[1:57:37.980 --> 1:57:45.420]  Media that signed on to this hollywood with more than 20 movies about blacks being killed and murdered by white people and kkk
[1:57:45.820 --> 1:57:49.660]  Just to traumatize people they put out in the last year that all failed
[1:57:50.660 --> 1:57:52.140]  Billions spent
[1:57:52.140 --> 1:57:53.820]  churning out garbage
[1:57:53.820 --> 1:58:00.380]  Everything you can throw at us and trying to steal and stealing several states that Ferris is a Democrat she confirms a bunch of states
[1:58:00.820 --> 1:58:03.580]  Over a hundred percent of the people were voting in precincts for Hillary
[1:58:03.580 --> 1:58:08.940]  Always right at the end late night stuffing ballot boxes. You failed miserably
[1:58:10.060 --> 1:58:14.340]  Because you are of your father the devil you worship a loser
[1:58:15.540 --> 1:58:19.260]  That's why you're so unhappy. It's why no amount of money or power ever makes you happy
[1:58:19.700 --> 1:58:22.700]  So do the world a favor before you try to burn America down or
[1:58:23.180 --> 1:58:26.780]  Try to push abortion or try to start World War three. I don't want you to die
[1:58:26.780 --> 1:58:30.780]  I want you to repent wake up, but a lot of you won't so if you're so into death kill yourselves
[1:58:30.780 --> 1:58:36.940]  I'm serious. If death's so sexy and cool, you might go to devil worship parties. Just let your wrist

[2:00:06.100 --> 2:00:08.180]  I demand he and some of the crews start a weekly show
[2:00:08.380 --> 2:00:11.700]  He was saying we gotta do it on corrupt. We've got to do an in-zone dance
[2:00:12.860 --> 2:00:14.460]  We got to do it
[2:00:14.460 --> 2:00:18.780]  On the front lines of the info war because that's a silent back on them
[2:00:18.780 --> 2:00:22.220]  They always want to laugh at us to moralize us make us feel like losers
[2:00:22.740 --> 2:00:25.780]  Make us think that we can never stand for anything. It's right. They want to bully us
[2:00:26.700 --> 2:00:31.860]  They want to get in our face and tell us we've got a rollover and that we're bad people
[2:00:32.620 --> 2:00:36.300]  You're the losers. You're the liars. You're the ones that are failures. You're a joke
[2:00:37.300 --> 2:00:43.100]  So that's a great point. I'm gonna go to some phone calls here and then we'll take calls as John Rapport joins us as well
[2:00:43.100 --> 2:00:45.980]  But Matt look, I agree with you. I've been up
[2:00:47.140 --> 2:00:53.220]  20-something hours. I slept three hours. I wasn't depressed when I came in. I just said get ready. They're gonna try to deactivate
[2:00:53.380 --> 2:00:59.300]  You know the border even more. They're gonna try to plunge the stock market. They're gonna try to burn down cities
[2:00:59.300 --> 2:01:01.380]  They're gonna try to and they're doing that right now
[2:01:02.180 --> 2:01:05.420]  And so we have more battles to fight but you're right
[2:01:05.420 --> 2:01:11.980]  This has been a gigantic victory the fact that they won't get their Supreme Court justices the fact that so that he's gonna cut taxes on
[2:01:11.980 --> 2:01:19.380]  People making $40,000 or less to zero is kind of just be such a great thing for blue-collar areas
[2:01:19.380 --> 2:01:24.820]  This is gonna just absolutely bring so many people up in the middle class. This this is this is an amazing time to be alive
[2:01:24.820 --> 2:01:26.820]  This is very exciting
[2:01:28.420 --> 2:01:30.420]  Jump in Matt
[2:01:31.060 --> 2:01:33.660]  No, I was actually I mean he's talking here in the break is making great points
[2:01:34.780 --> 2:01:38.940]  I'm going comment on that one of the things that I understand that you know
[2:01:38.940 --> 2:01:42.820]  The phrase a plan for the
[2:01:43.860 --> 2:01:49.540]  Hope for the best plan for the worst, you know, I was listening to a guy who's a screenwriter and
[2:01:50.860 --> 2:01:55.100]  He basically said yesterday, you know, this this election does prove one thing
[2:01:56.180 --> 2:02:04.100]  That your hopes are just as valid as your fears and I think that's a big deal because you point out sometimes
[2:02:04.100 --> 2:02:11.020]  The you know, what could actually happen some of these scenarios and I think you do a very good job at identifying
[2:02:11.580 --> 2:02:16.980]  The way that some of these elite people think because you know, if they believe we're below them
[2:02:16.980 --> 2:02:23.020]  Why wouldn't they do that? Why wouldn't they think that way, you know, and so we need to let them know we're above them
[2:02:23.020 --> 2:02:29.380]  I totally agree. There's some hope so no, you're right. We should talk about what we can build instead of just what they're gonna do to us
[2:02:29.380 --> 2:02:35.500]  It's just that they're these horrible nasty things attacking us constantly. That's why I get too focused on them
[2:02:35.500 --> 2:02:41.060]  You're absolutely right. We should talk more about how good things could be without George Soros and David Rockefeller running our lives
[2:02:43.900 --> 2:02:51.140]  Yeah, and that's that's the beauty of Trump, you know, is that it gives you the ability to take control of your own life back, you know
[2:02:52.260 --> 2:02:56.540]  And to feel good about the economy again, they they don't want us to feel good
[2:02:56.540 --> 2:03:00.500]  They don't want us to feel like we don't you notice they tried to plunge the stock market
[2:03:00.500 --> 2:03:03.620]  But all these other small people came into it. They've now pushed it way back up
[2:03:03.620 --> 2:03:06.180]  But regardless we can't be held hostage by them
[2:03:08.340 --> 2:03:15.180]  Yeah, and it's hilarious when you bring up the stocks, you know, how well some people are doing they were making moves yesterday morning and you know
[2:03:16.300 --> 2:03:21.820]  Unfortunately the military defense stocks, you know defense contractor stocks those those went up
[2:03:21.820 --> 2:03:28.420]  Energy stocks, I think those those rose yesterday morning as well. So yeah, I've got a roommate who?
[2:03:28.860 --> 2:03:32.860]  Does invest and he said yesterday was actually a very good day for him
[2:03:33.420 --> 2:03:37.980]  So, well, let me break this down one of the danger areas with Trump is the fact that
[2:03:38.500 --> 2:03:42.620]  He does want a giant military. I'm not against this having a powerful military
[2:03:43.420 --> 2:03:49.540]  But they have overrun our military. They've degraded it on purpose the globalist have and put it in a derelict state
[2:03:49.540 --> 2:03:54.260]  We need to make it smaller but reorganized and better for defense not for conquest
[2:03:54.260 --> 2:04:00.340]  And that's what Trump actually wants to do and then have a lot of technological innovations through that and relaunch our space program
[2:04:00.340 --> 2:04:02.900]  I mean notice we've gotten rid of the space program. This is crazy
[2:04:03.540 --> 2:04:09.980]  Well also reassessing the purpose of some of these missions like NATO like that was a big point that Trump brought up, you know
[2:04:09.980 --> 2:04:12.820]  It's we're gonna make them pay for part of it
[2:04:12.820 --> 2:04:16.060]  I mean if you're gonna keep it, we're not gonna pay for 60% of NATO anymore
[2:04:16.060 --> 2:04:23.380]  Of course, and there should be coalitions amongst free nations free countries, but that's it. NATO shouldn't be its own thing
[2:04:24.060 --> 2:04:30.500]  Dictating us. Yeah, and you know, there's some big deficiencies of NATO, you know, especially when looking at
[2:04:31.300 --> 2:04:32.700]  border states
[2:04:32.700 --> 2:04:38.400]  Where Russia can strike, you know that I was watching a general he he gave a press release man
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:43.540]  It's couple couple months ago, and he was talking about how the Russians could basically
[2:04:43.540 --> 2:04:50.300]  Attack a country, but NATO's response would have to be a liberation campaign because
[2:04:51.060 --> 2:04:57.260]  They would they don't have the ability to move throughout borders, which makes NATO terribly inefficient. That's right
[2:04:57.260 --> 2:05:00.480]  We'll be right back. And so we're just two months away from January
[2:05:01.100 --> 2:05:06.060]  2017 when President Trump takes power, but let's take a look at how his tax plan may impact your returns
[2:05:06.300 --> 2:05:11.220]  NBC is reporting if Trump sticks to his campaign promises here are the major things his administration will change
[2:05:11.220 --> 2:05:18.500]  They'll reduce seven federal tax brackets down to three with rates of 12 percent 25 percent and 33 percent increases in the standard deduction from
[2:05:18.900 --> 2:05:21.900]  6300 to $15,000 for single filers and from
[2:05:22.340 --> 2:05:28.340]  12,600 to $30,000 for married couples the irony is all those Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires
[2:05:28.620 --> 2:05:33.180]  Athletes and rock stars that all supported Hillary Clinton are going to be seeing some of the biggest tax returns
[2:05:33.180 --> 2:05:36.940]  In fact Forbes is reporting that Trump's tax plan could save LeBron James over
[2:05:36.940 --> 2:05:44.660]  $15 million per year, but the coup de gras and Trump's tax plan will be lowering the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent
[2:05:44.700 --> 2:05:47.420]  And eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax
[2:05:47.420 --> 2:05:53.440]  This is going to unleash a rash of hirings across the country and hopefully bring businesses who moved overseas back to the United States
[2:05:53.440 --> 2:05:57.980]  Thereby increasing jobs Rob do reporting for info wars comm and info wars nightly news
[2:05:57.980 --> 2:06:03.580]  You ever wonder what happened to America because of what we did on this day

[2:08:39.700 --> 2:08:45.700]  Monika in Canada Justin in Florida. We're everybody in this hour and more pull free number to join us 800 25
[2:08:45.700 --> 2:08:52.620]  99231 the seismic defeat of the globalists here in the United States coupled with Briggs it coupled with the Russians in the last decade
[2:08:52.620 --> 2:08:57.780]  Pulling out of the New World Order is the end of the current world government system and by the way
[2:08:57.780 --> 2:09:00.380]  I've been saying that for months the New York Times today
[2:09:00.980 --> 2:09:02.980]  link up on drudgereport.com
[2:09:03.340 --> 2:09:04.860]  admits just that
[2:09:04.860 --> 2:09:11.780]  All the delusional insiders all the delusional groupers on TV saying how dumb we are the emails by the hundreds of thousands
[2:09:11.780 --> 2:09:13.940]  How much they hate us how they want to make us poor?
[2:09:14.460 --> 2:09:21.860]  We have to continue to get the WikiLeaks and publish about them and go back through them and keep hammering and hammering and hammering this criminal class
[2:09:21.860 --> 2:09:28.740]  Hillary must be prosecuted. Obama came out and said he may give her a pardon. He said that this morning. Here it is
[2:09:32.300 --> 2:09:34.300]  Here you go. Thanks Josh
[2:09:34.660 --> 2:09:37.540]  Donald Trump during the campaign pledged to
[2:09:38.500 --> 2:09:43.740]  Jail Hillary Clinton if he was elected over the federal investigation center on the way
[2:09:44.380 --> 2:09:50.660]  Some legal experts have said that President Obama could close off that opportunity if he pardons Hillary Clinton
[2:09:50.660 --> 2:09:53.140]  Is that something that the president is considering doing?
[2:09:53.660 --> 2:09:57.180]  Well, Jordan as you know the president has
[2:09:59.100 --> 2:10:03.900]  Offered clemency to a substantial number of Americans who
[2:10:05.700 --> 2:10:07.700]  Were previously serving time
[2:10:09.980 --> 2:10:12.220]  In in federal prisons and
[2:10:13.620 --> 2:10:18.700]  We didn't talk in advance about the president's plans to offer clemency attending those individuals
[2:10:18.700 --> 2:10:25.900]  And it's because we don't talk about the president's thinking particularly with any space with respect to any specific cases
[2:10:27.780 --> 2:10:31.820]  That may apply to you know pardons or commutations
[2:10:33.940 --> 2:10:40.220]  Thanks, all right now next we have Vladimir Putin congratulating one of the first world leaders to do it yesterday
[2:10:41.540 --> 2:10:44.860]  At a state event for the victory and he of course said last week
[2:10:44.860 --> 2:10:50.540]  This will be a vote against globalism and financial sovereignty against elites that have hijacked the United States
[2:10:51.140 --> 2:10:56.700]  Similar to the elites that have hijacked Russia. Well, it's the exact same elites. So this is the world
[2:10:57.900 --> 2:11:02.540]  Pulling away from the exploitive garbage that is Obamacare and all of it and Trump
[2:11:03.260 --> 2:11:09.900]  Has come out and said he's moving forward with meetings today with the Republicans to push to build the wall and to repeal Obamacare
[2:11:09.900 --> 2:11:16.060]  So this is the big first test and Trump as he's told you publicly and myself publicly and privately
[2:11:16.060 --> 2:11:20.300]  I will not disappoint you. He is going to set his will and your will against them
[2:11:20.300 --> 2:11:26.700]  And if he can do this, he'll be as great as George Washington or greater if he's able to carry this out already the feet of the landslide
[2:11:27.660 --> 2:11:31.660]  Against their fraud and the rest of it bev Harris confirmed. They stole some states from Trump
[2:11:32.700 --> 2:11:35.100]  He is he is our victory
[2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:42.380]  It's huge and is seismic and repudiates everything they're doing and everything they stand for it also shows their arrogance
[2:11:42.780 --> 2:11:44.780]  They really believed they were invincible
[2:11:45.340 --> 2:11:49.260]  Like every other elite has in history and that's what's so dangerous because now we have nuclear weapons
[2:11:49.660 --> 2:11:54.140]  We can't have the mistakes that other people made like a Hitler or a or a
[2:11:54.860 --> 2:11:56.860]  Mussolini or a
[2:11:57.820 --> 2:12:00.940]  You know somebody like Napoleon it can't be done now
[2:12:00.940 --> 2:12:08.540]  And they're so disconnected. They're so arrogant billion spent Hollywood everything they had thrown at the American people world leaders lecturing us
[2:12:08.540 --> 2:12:14.540]  Everyone telling us we couldn't and they're now in stum. We'll talk to John Rappaport about the paradigm shift the sea chains
[2:12:14.540 --> 2:12:16.540]  It's here and where he sees them going next, but
[2:12:16.940 --> 2:12:20.700]  They could set a new coffin blaming on patriots. They could blow up a school and say we did it
[2:12:20.940 --> 2:12:28.940]  These folks are arrogant. Hopefully they've been knocked down enough that they don't cause some chain reaction because we know they want a civil war
[2:12:28.940 --> 2:12:35.340]  And I told you folks they start that we went even bigger. I don't want to go down that road. It's going to be messy and dangerous
[2:12:35.900 --> 2:12:38.860]  But I told them they were going to lose this
[2:12:39.580 --> 2:12:46.540]  Told you we had internal polls. I talked to so many polling agencies. I talked to other folks. I'm not going to obviously the Trump campaign did not want it out
[2:12:46.540 --> 2:12:51.580]  That's what I keep saying. It's rigged folks. It's rigged. They would go out and get 10 15 polls
[2:12:52.540 --> 2:12:54.940]  Big corporate top polls, but private polls
[2:12:54.940 --> 2:13:03.900]  And because they won't even do them for you unless they do their methodology just do straight up polling to this and he was way ahead
[2:13:03.900 --> 2:13:05.340]  I told you that
[2:13:05.340 --> 2:13:10.540]  So we're going to play this clip then take a few calls and go to Rappaport and then back to calls. But right now, here's Putin
[2:13:12.540 --> 2:13:14.540]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:13:14.540 --> 2:13:24.140]  A few hours ago presidential elections have finished in the United States of America
[2:13:28.540 --> 2:13:30.940]  We have been following this campaign with attention
[2:13:30.940 --> 2:13:40.940]  And I'd like to congratulate the American people with the end of the electoral cycle
[2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:50.940]  And I'd also like to congratulate Mr. Donald Trump with his victory in these elections
[2:13:50.940 --> 2:14:04.940]  We have heard his electoral slogans when he was still a candidate of the president
[2:14:04.940 --> 2:14:16.940]  And he spoke about resuming and restoring relations between Russia and the United States
[2:14:16.940 --> 2:14:34.940]  We understand that the way to that would be difficult if you're taking into account the current state of degradation of relations between the U.S. and Russia
[2:14:34.940 --> 2:14:48.940]  And as I have repeatedly said, that is not our fault that the Russian-American relations are in that poor state
[2:14:48.940 --> 2:15:02.940]  That Russia is ready and wants to restore the full-fledged relations with the United States
[2:15:02.940 --> 2:15:18.940]  I repeat, we understand that this will be a difficult way, but we are ready to play our part in it
[2:15:20.940 --> 2:15:28.940]  And do everything to return the Russian-American relations to the stable and sustainable development track
[2:15:28.940 --> 2:15:32.940]  Trump did better than Romney among Hispanics and blacks
[2:15:32.940 --> 2:15:38.940]  U.S. stocks jumped along with bond yields after Trump shocked Peso Falls
[2:15:38.940 --> 2:15:44.940]  And we've got all the clips of Obama saying he'd never be president making jokes, Hillary in the mainstream media
[2:15:44.940 --> 2:15:48.940]  This isn't some foil where he's really an operative and they tricked the globalists or they tricked us
[2:15:48.940 --> 2:15:54.940]  This is 100% real folks and they are in panic. Will they back off and be more sane?
[2:15:54.940 --> 2:16:00.940]  Or will they go ahead with the economic system of trying to have a controlled economy and make everybody else poor?
[2:16:00.940 --> 2:16:04.940]  Because that's their admitted plan and that's not popular with almost anybody
[2:16:04.940 --> 2:16:08.940]  Well, how will they counter-strike? We're going to your calls, a few of them there
[2:16:08.940 --> 2:16:12.940]  As I said, the John Rappaport, NoMoreFakeNews.com and then back to calls Andrew in the U.K.
[2:16:12.940 --> 2:16:16.940]  Thanks for holding her on the ear
[2:16:16.940 --> 2:16:18.940]  Hello
[2:16:18.940 --> 2:16:20.940]  Welcome
[2:16:20.940 --> 2:16:24.940]  I was just saying because I've got a Twitter account and I'm always on Twitter
[2:16:24.940 --> 2:16:34.940]  And I've seen today the gentleman at the junction, the road junction, with his car getting beaten by the other gentleman
[2:16:34.940 --> 2:16:37.940]  I use the word gentleman loosely on that
[2:16:37.940 --> 2:16:41.940]  And I remember Charlotte and what went on in Charlotte
[2:16:41.940 --> 2:16:47.940]  And I'm just now waiting to see the BLM be activated and for the real violence to start
[2:16:47.940 --> 2:16:52.940]  And I'm getting quite angry, I'm fat and shaking, I wish I was in your country myself
[2:16:52.940 --> 2:16:59.940]  Well, let me tell you, the problem is that they want to ignite civil unrest and then say that it's a race war
[2:16:59.940 --> 2:17:05.940]  And it's just a lot of really dumb teenagers and thug types that are taught that it's cool to go beat an old man
[2:17:05.940 --> 2:17:09.940]  A lot of it isn't happening, this happened in Chicago because a lot of folks don't pack
[2:17:09.940 --> 2:17:12.940]  A lot of it doesn't happen in Texas because then a lot of people are armed
[2:17:12.940 --> 2:17:20.940]  It's very, very sad, it's the media manipulating people and you know, to watch five or six teenagers beat up or young men beat up an old guy is sad
[2:17:20.940 --> 2:17:23.940]  But according to MSNBC, he's white so he deserves it
[2:17:23.940 --> 2:17:29.940]  These are the folks, I mean even Time Magazine actually said in sort of Newsweek that rioting and attacking people is good
[2:17:29.940 --> 2:17:31.940]  Remember that? They said it's time to attack white people
[2:17:31.940 --> 2:17:37.940]  This is white people of course saying it, not because they want to reform anything but because they want us all at each other's throats
[2:17:37.940 --> 2:17:40.940]  It's very, very nasty
[2:17:40.940 --> 2:17:48.940]  Yeah well, I hope it all plays out and it plays out well and you stop them because the way I look at them is the way I look at the IRA
[2:17:48.940 --> 2:17:51.940]  I IRA through the troubles when I was in the military
[2:17:51.940 --> 2:17:58.940]  They are a domestic terrorist organization now funded by George Soros and Rockefeller and all the other foundations just throw money at them
[2:17:58.940 --> 2:18:01.940]  You don't know where that money goes but obviously they know where the money goes
[2:18:01.940 --> 2:18:06.940]  Well that's an interesting point you make that George Soros was also, he's evolved in everything basically
[2:18:06.940 --> 2:18:13.940]  I don't know how he's, how is he able to travel freely when he's been caught funding every destabilization group out of the sun?
[2:18:13.940 --> 2:18:18.940]  He's got more money and more power than all of us put together dude
[2:18:18.940 --> 2:18:26.940]  He killed Ukraine, the top 5% of Ukrainians ruined the country, not the 95%
[2:18:26.940 --> 2:18:30.940]  And yet you're picking on Russia, what the hell are you doing?
[2:18:30.940 --> 2:18:32.940]  You don't do stuff like that buddy
[2:18:32.940 --> 2:18:37.940]  You don't poke down like Russia, Russia has 20 million men in the Second World War
[2:18:37.940 --> 2:18:43.940]  Do you honestly think that they're not going to be bothered about losing 20 million more to destroy this lot?
[2:18:43.940 --> 2:18:46.940]  Really?
[2:18:46.940 --> 2:18:52.940]  Well that's right and we have George Soros banned from Russia and they kicked out all his groups last year
[2:18:52.940 --> 2:18:59.940]  And our media said that Russia was a tyranny for kicking out thousands of operatives, US citizens and others in there
[2:18:59.940 --> 2:19:04.940]  I can't believe they were even letting Soros operate until last year, we should let him operate
[2:19:04.940 --> 2:19:09.940]  This isn't free speech, he is a globalist criminal, a frickin international terrorist
[2:19:09.940 --> 2:19:13.940]  And I want Donald Trump to have his ass thrown in prison, I'm tired of him
[2:19:13.940 --> 2:19:19.940]  About two weeks ago and it was, I think it was called Russia or something like that
[2:19:19.940 --> 2:19:23.940]  It was the first bit and then it went to another bit which was a Russian newspaper
[2:19:23.940 --> 2:19:32.940]  It was a photo of the Russian newspaper and they had the English subtitles to what the thing said
[2:19:32.940 --> 2:19:38.940]  And basically they put a hundred million dollars in the wall, get the whole life mounted on his head
[2:19:38.940 --> 2:19:43.940]  If he hides it in the US, he's in trouble, if he hides it in Europe, he's in trouble
[2:19:43.940 --> 2:19:47.940]  The only place he can go is the Middle East and he'll be in trouble there
[2:19:47.940 --> 2:19:49.940]  That's right, thank you for the call, I'm going to skip this break
[2:19:49.940 --> 2:19:53.940]  We're going to go to Rep4 for a moment and just start going back and forth with calls for the rest of the hour
[2:19:53.940 --> 2:19:56.940]  With John Rep4 at NomeroFakeNews.com co-hosting with us writing Shotgun
[2:19:56.940 --> 2:19:59.940]  And now that he's moved and stuff, he's been moving the last few months
[2:19:59.940 --> 2:20:01.940]  He's going to be co-hosting some and also hosting by himself some
[2:20:01.940 --> 2:20:05.940]  He's invited here to host once a week for an hour if he'd like to, does a great job
[2:20:05.940 --> 2:20:08.940]  NomeroFakeNews.com, again I'm Alex Jones, your host
[2:20:08.940 --> 2:20:13.940]  We're going to go to David and Nevada and again Monika and Justin and Dave and others
[2:20:13.940 --> 2:20:23.940]  But when you think about the repudiation of the entire global government, corporate, Anglo-American establishment
[2:20:23.940 --> 2:20:25.940]  That's what they call themselves
[2:20:25.940 --> 2:20:30.940]  When you look at the repudiation of it and people worldwide against it
[2:20:30.940 --> 2:20:39.940]  It's very sickening to see how they're using race-based systems when they're called the Anglo-American establishment
[2:20:39.940 --> 2:20:44.940]  I mean you couldn't be working for the establishment more than when you work for La Raza or Mecho
[2:20:44.940 --> 2:20:50.940]  The Ford Foundation or Black Lives Matter, I mean these truly are the useful morons of the planet
[2:20:50.940 --> 2:20:54.940]  Now five people try to attack and kill me, I'm going to defend myself and I'm too old
[2:20:54.940 --> 2:20:58.940]  I'm not going to even try to act like John Wayne anymore, I'd probably do a pretty good job
[2:20:58.940 --> 2:21:01.940]  Those little thugs would be really easy, it's like a joke
[2:21:01.940 --> 2:21:04.940]  But I'm probably breaking my hands and I'm serious about that
[2:21:04.940 --> 2:21:09.940]  That's the only problem I'm presenting on people full power, that he's my elbows and my hands are so broken up
[2:21:09.940 --> 2:21:14.940]  But second amendment folks, but I don't want to get in a pissing match with these idiots, I'd rather wake them up
[2:21:14.940 --> 2:21:24.940]  John Rappaport, where should we start today? Seismic, historic, over the top, I mean you always tend to really hit it from an interesting angle
[2:21:24.940 --> 2:21:27.940]  A illuminating angle, what do you say?
[2:21:27.940 --> 2:21:32.940]  You spoke about solutions a few minutes ago Alex and I think that's where we're at
[2:21:32.940 --> 2:21:37.940]  Because Trump has been listening and his people have been listening
[2:21:37.940 --> 2:21:40.940]  Roger Stone's been listening
[2:21:40.940 --> 2:21:45.940]  What are the solutions now? Where do we go? Of course Trump has his agenda and so forth
[2:21:45.940 --> 2:21:51.940]  And I've mentioned this on the show before, bringing back life to the inner cities in America
[2:21:51.940 --> 2:21:54.940]  Of course that means bringing jobs back home
[2:21:54.940 --> 2:21:59.940]  But you know the other day I looked on a search engine and I found in Chicago
[2:21:59.940 --> 2:22:06.940]  Not just an urban farm, but a directory of urban farms
[2:22:06.940 --> 2:22:14.940]  I saw at least eight of these local operations that are all geared to growing fresh nutritious food for people
[2:22:14.940 --> 2:22:17.940]  By people who live there and so on and so forth
[2:22:17.940 --> 2:22:19.940]  That's a revolution, right there
[2:22:19.940 --> 2:22:27.940]  Let's put a hundred, a thousand, five thousand of these urban farms and inner cities across America for a pittance
[2:22:27.940 --> 2:22:31.940]  People themselves could form their businesses and make money
[2:22:31.940 --> 2:22:34.940]  If Trump is listening to this, here's a clue
[2:22:34.940 --> 2:22:37.940]  You want to bring back inner cities?
[2:22:37.940 --> 2:22:42.940]  Of course you offer people jobs, good jobs, and also programs like this
[2:22:42.940 --> 2:22:48.940]  That for a tiny amount of money can reverse life completely in these inner cities
[2:22:48.940 --> 2:22:53.940]  So I think that the new administration in Washington
[2:22:53.940 --> 2:22:58.940]  If they have a clue about anything and they seem to, are going to be listening to people like us
[2:22:58.940 --> 2:23:02.940]  Because we've been looking at solutions all along
[2:23:02.940 --> 2:23:04.940]  This is nothing new for us
[2:23:04.940 --> 2:23:09.940]  It's funny you say that Putin two years ago launched a national program, but it's local run
[2:23:09.940 --> 2:23:12.940]  With taxing citizens and things to go all organic
[2:23:12.940 --> 2:23:15.940]  And become the number one world producer of organics in just five years
[2:23:15.940 --> 2:23:20.940]  And in the main release they said this is how humanity gets back to the soil, this activates our human roots
[2:23:20.940 --> 2:23:23.940]  It's spiritual, we have to get away from TVs
[2:23:23.940 --> 2:23:26.940]  Even a few hours a week and get out in the soil with other people
[2:23:26.940 --> 2:23:29.940]  And then actually eat the food we bring in, it's a chain reaction
[2:23:29.940 --> 2:23:33.940]  And you know what, I'm busy but I'm going to do it, I'm going to sponsor an East Austin farm
[2:23:33.940 --> 2:23:37.940]  I'm going to sponsor that for the public, I'm going to have a lot of money
[2:23:37.940 --> 2:23:40.940]  And we're going to just put folks in the community in charge
[2:23:40.940 --> 2:23:44.940]  And I think the communists will probably attack it, they'll attack this little cat section where, and that's how evil they are
[2:23:44.940 --> 2:23:47.940]  But you're absolutely right John, this is the answer
[2:23:47.940 --> 2:23:52.940]  Solutions, and if you go ahead and do that, which I think is great
[2:23:52.940 --> 2:23:59.940]  Just point out to the people that very quickly they can make this into a profit making business of their own
[2:23:59.940 --> 2:24:03.940]  So they can eat fresh nutritious food that they grow for nothing
[2:24:03.940 --> 2:24:05.940]  And then they can sell the food
[2:24:05.940 --> 2:24:09.940]  And all of a sudden you've got free market coming back into the inner cities
[2:24:09.940 --> 2:24:14.940]  And it's the spirit of humans cultivating and producing life
[2:24:14.940 --> 2:24:17.940]  It's spiritual, it isn't only written in books but it's true
[2:24:17.940 --> 2:24:21.940]  Like Jefferson said, the farmer has the spirit and the ethic and everything
[2:24:21.940 --> 2:24:25.940]  For the moral society, we have to go back to human activity
[2:24:25.940 --> 2:24:30.940]  And my feeling is, and I mentioned this to a couple of friends yesterday
[2:24:30.940 --> 2:24:35.940]  If you're living in an inner city and all of a sudden it starts to blossom with
[2:24:35.940 --> 2:24:38.940]  You know, one of these, several of these enterprises
[2:24:38.940 --> 2:24:45.940]  Growing food naturally, growing the outdoors, growing it in abandoned buildings, growing it in all kinds of places
[2:24:45.940 --> 2:24:52.940]  Now the people that live there are invested in that community in a way that they've never been before in their memory
[2:24:52.940 --> 2:24:57.940]  Now they're feeding themselves and growing food and selling the food and making a profit
[2:24:57.940 --> 2:25:03.940]  They're in business, and now their demand
[2:25:03.940 --> 2:25:11.940]  The level of their demand to live in a safe community free of thugs and gangs and drugs and so forth
[2:25:11.940 --> 2:25:16.940]  Reaches a new peak level that it's never been at before
[2:25:16.940 --> 2:25:21.940]  This is not just, I want the freedom to be able to go down to the AMPM
[2:25:21.940 --> 2:25:25.940]  Because that's the only store that's there, you know, no
[2:25:25.940 --> 2:25:32.940]  We've got something to protect now that's real, that's feeding us and making us money on a true product
[2:25:32.940 --> 2:25:37.940]  So where are you going to see life in those inner cities completely transformed?
[2:25:37.940 --> 2:25:41.940]  That's right, you are so on target, I want to intersperse calls because it'll take us in great different directions
[2:25:41.940 --> 2:25:46.940]  But after we take some more calls, what are other areas you want to get into?
[2:25:46.940 --> 2:25:49.940]  Well, I think we should continue to talk about solutions
[2:25:49.940 --> 2:25:59.940]  What solutions can we feed this new movement that has developed using Trump in a way as a symbol
[2:25:59.940 --> 2:26:03.940]  You know, whatever else you want to say, a battering ram
[2:26:03.940 --> 2:26:07.940]  The movement is gigantic, it got its legs under it with Ron Paul
[2:26:07.940 --> 2:26:13.940]  These are many of the same people, these are many of the same people who have been outside the system
[2:26:13.940 --> 2:26:17.940]  That are now starting to look back in and say, well, what can we do?
[2:26:17.940 --> 2:26:21.940]  And that's what I was explaining to folks when Paul didn't win, he won by building the movement
[2:26:21.940 --> 2:26:26.940]  And then Trump even if he lost would have won, but now that we've won, we've got to deliver
[2:26:26.940 --> 2:26:33.940]  Exactly, so more answers, more solutions about, you know, what can revive this country
[2:26:33.940 --> 2:26:36.940]  Of course, bringing back jobs
[2:26:36.940 --> 2:26:41.940]  And this is America, we can revive it, they've beaten us down with the spirit of infighting and wickedness
[2:26:41.940 --> 2:26:45.940]  It's going to be easy if we just keep hard charging and all of us do little things
[2:26:45.940 --> 2:26:50.940]  I'm going to go over, I'm going to look at sites, I'm going to do it, I'm going to sponsor some local churches or something
[2:26:50.940 --> 2:26:53.940]  And I'm going to help put in a big farm over here
[2:26:53.940 --> 2:26:57.940]  Fantastic, fantastic, here's another one, health freedom
[2:26:57.940 --> 2:27:04.940]  I was there in the early 90s as an active, really active person in this whole thing that exploded
[2:27:04.940 --> 2:27:10.940]  That some people will still remember when they raided Jonathan Wright's clinic up in the state of Washington
[2:27:10.940 --> 2:27:13.940]  Who was, you know, giving people B vitamins
[2:27:13.940 --> 2:27:19.940]  And then all of a sudden the FDA was coming out and talking about restricting people's access to nutritional supplements
[2:27:19.940 --> 2:27:29.940]  So this was before email or any of that, and Congress had millions of letters that were more than they had ever received before on any other issue
[2:27:29.940 --> 2:27:33.940]  Those people are still out there, and basically what they're saying is
[2:27:33.940 --> 2:27:38.940]  We demand the right to have voluntary choice in how we take care of our own bodies
[2:27:38.940 --> 2:27:42.940]  And with no interference from the outside, period, that's it
[2:27:42.940 --> 2:27:48.940]  And, you know, they call it the natural health movement, or health freedom movement is really what it is
[2:27:48.940 --> 2:27:53.940]  And a couple states actually passed laws, and what those laws stated was
[2:27:53.940 --> 2:28:03.940]  Okay, look, if you are a practitioner of any kind and you are treating a person for a condition with a natural remedy
[2:28:03.940 --> 2:28:10.940]  That is no more harmful than the medical remedy for that same condition
[2:28:10.940 --> 2:28:13.940]  You're free to do whatever you want, you're free to do it
[2:28:13.940 --> 2:28:17.940]  Well, that's a pretty good idea, that's a good starting point
[2:28:17.940 --> 2:28:24.940]  If we begin to expand that again and say, look, Trump, whoever's listening, there are millions of people out there
[2:28:24.940 --> 2:28:30.940]  Well, by the way, I mean, Barron did get hurt a little bit by a vaccine, he's gotten better reportedly, and I'm not supposed to get into that
[2:28:30.940 --> 2:28:36.940]  The point is, that's why Trump was saying, hey, vaccines are bad, watch out, there's too many of them, because he's experienced it
[2:28:36.940 --> 2:28:38.940]  Yeah, he absolutely has
[2:28:38.940 --> 2:28:41.940]  So here, coming in behind that
[2:28:41.940 --> 2:28:53.940]  The right of every person, especially parents, to decide on what is health for their family, whatever they want to do, that is their choice
[2:28:53.940 --> 2:29:03.940]  If that became a spearheaded movement within Washington, within the Trump administration, you would have countless millions of people coming back
[2:29:03.940 --> 2:29:11.940]  Well, sure, exactly, look at the WikiLeaks, they're all figuring out how to screw people over and keep folks from having any part of the pie
[2:29:11.940 --> 2:29:15.940]  When we get people and they're trying to build the pie, they'll all be kings over fabulous wealth
[2:29:15.940 --> 2:29:20.940]  I mean, this is a huge engine, they've been blocking it on purpose, we know that
[2:29:20.940 --> 2:29:24.940]  Exactly, exactly, there's more to say about this, I hear some music
[2:29:24.940 --> 2:29:28.940]  Yes, we're going to come back, take calls more into this, but we'll talk about how the empire is going to strike back
[2:29:28.940 --> 2:29:36.940]  Now, callers, I'm going to get better now, and I promise to take your calls, Monique and Justin and David and David and VC, everybody will get to all your calls
[2:29:36.940 --> 2:29:41.940]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com is the tip of the spear in the fight against the New World Order
[2:29:41.940 --> 2:29:47.940]  Because it's the truth, folks, and once the public knows the paradigm that we're under globalism, it's over
[2:29:47.940 --> 2:30:03.940]  We are now two days into the historic election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States
[2:30:03.940 --> 2:30:10.940]  And all those doom and gloom cries from the mainstream media that the markets were going to tank and businesses were going to go bankrupt
[2:30:10.940 --> 2:30:12.940]  Well, of course, it's just a bunch of hot air
[2:30:12.940 --> 2:30:19.940]  Now, the drugs report linked to this Bloomberg article, US stocks rally falters near records as Trump platform assessed
[2:30:19.940 --> 2:30:25.940]  Yeah, that's right, they actually took the time to look at his plan and go, wow, more people are going to have more money and we're going to make more money
[2:30:25.940 --> 2:30:29.940]  And of course, Bloomberg's trying to put a hazy spin on this headline
[2:30:29.940 --> 2:30:38.940]  But the fact is the Dow Jones industrial average rose to an all-time high as investors speculated on the industries and companies that stand to benefit from Donald Trump's surprise election victory
[2:30:38.940 --> 2:30:49.940]  The Dow rose 125 points, Goldman Sachs came out and said Trump's promise to revive American infrastructure means commodities used to build everything from airports to bridges will benefit under his presidency
[2:30:49.940 --> 2:30:54.940]  That's right, at this point, if Trump does what he says, we can look to a new era of economic prosperity
[2:30:54.940 --> 2:31:19.940]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News

[2:32:20.940 --> 2:32:28.940]  In the history of InfowarsLife, we brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, SuperMell Vitality and so many others
[2:32:28.940 --> 2:32:32.940]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[2:32:32.940 --> 2:32:38.940]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects
[2:32:38.940 --> 2:32:42.940]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products
[2:32:42.940 --> 2:32:49.940]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard
[2:32:49.940 --> 2:32:52.940]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure
[2:32:52.940 --> 2:32:55.940]  That's InfowarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion
[2:32:55.940 --> 2:32:58.940]  Take action now before we sell out
[2:33:03.940 --> 2:33:06.940]  Rally Patriots Worldwide
[2:33:06.940 --> 2:33:08.940]  That was the vision
[2:33:10.940 --> 2:33:12.940]  Now the reality
[2:33:12.940 --> 2:33:16.940]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic
[2:33:16.940 --> 2:33:18.940]  It's Alex Jones
[2:33:18.940 --> 2:33:25.940]  And I can historically, economically, culturally, most important spiritually
[2:33:25.940 --> 2:33:29.940]  See into possible futures
[2:33:29.940 --> 2:33:35.940]  The AI seduction will be our greatest challenge
[2:33:35.940 --> 2:33:42.940]  Not succumbing to virtual realities that are supposedly unfathomable ecstasies
[2:33:42.940 --> 2:33:47.940]  Not giving up our supposed human bodies for what we believe is some silicon upgrade
[2:33:47.940 --> 2:33:51.940]  But in truth, it's just death, and the biggest con game the universe has ever seen
[2:33:51.940 --> 2:33:54.940]  I want to talk to Rappaport Sun, he'll do a little bit in the next hour
[2:33:54.940 --> 2:33:56.940]  He'll get to see Artie with me maybe 10, 15 minutes
[2:33:56.940 --> 2:33:59.940]  If he can't understand just on what he sees as big future threats
[2:33:59.940 --> 2:34:02.940]  Because people are always, you're being so negative, you're being so negative
[2:34:02.940 --> 2:34:06.940]  We have to admit the threats to be able to turn it around and not succumb to them
[2:34:06.940 --> 2:34:08.940]  But this is a big game changer
[2:34:08.940 --> 2:34:12.940]  And we see the race-based politics, we see the sanctuary cities
[2:34:12.940 --> 2:34:15.940]  The Democrats believing they can do this colonization program
[2:34:15.940 --> 2:34:22.940]  We have to absolutely counter all of that
[2:34:22.940 --> 2:34:28.940]  And really bring true information, true ideas, true economy
[2:34:28.940 --> 2:34:33.940]  Because if we just let the globalists set up these systems and then keep people under their control
[2:34:33.940 --> 2:34:38.940]  They are being designed to basically be the zombie army of the New World Order
[2:34:38.940 --> 2:34:42.940]  And my sheet said that future Artie was doing the fourth hour, that's why I announced that
[2:34:42.940 --> 2:34:45.940]  Owen Schreuer is doing the fourth hour, so he'll write a chocolate one
[2:34:45.940 --> 2:34:49.940]  He's always a firecracker, love Owen the great work he's doing
[2:34:49.940 --> 2:34:52.940]  Before I go any further here, just briefly
[2:34:52.940 --> 2:34:56.940]  We've launched the paid app, it's $4.95 a month, half-priced out of the gaze
[2:34:56.940 --> 2:35:01.940]  And we've been so busy with the 52-hour, we actually went 60 hours yesterday
[2:35:01.940 --> 2:35:05.940]  60-hour broadcast and everything else, it just launched two days ago
[2:35:05.940 --> 2:35:08.940]  But there are some original videos uploaded on there and some live feeds they've done
[2:35:08.940 --> 2:35:12.940]  But the crew is all getting a tutorial today, like three o'clock on how they can use
[2:35:12.940 --> 2:35:17.940]  It's really easy to do and start uploading their own special reports, live events, feeds, myself
[2:35:17.940 --> 2:35:21.940]  On a daily basis, so that's one reason to do it
[2:35:21.940 --> 2:35:27.940]  And then also there's discounts in there that you could save the amount of money on your first purchase on anything in the store
[2:35:27.940 --> 2:35:31.940]  I mean, we put a lot of lost leaders in there, I mean, 50% off select items
[2:35:31.940 --> 2:35:35.940]  I don't mean just some side item we're not selling, we'll take the hottest stuff we've got and sell it at that
[2:35:35.940 --> 2:35:39.940]  So, the only place you can find bigger discounts that we've got running for this special that is this weekend
[2:35:39.940 --> 2:35:43.940]  Is the InfoWars app, infowars.comfordslash.app
[2:35:43.940 --> 2:35:46.940]  Or go to the Google Play Store or to the app store
[2:35:46.940 --> 2:35:48.940]  It's InfoWars Prime
[2:35:48.940 --> 2:35:54.940]  If you go to infowars.comford slideshap, you can find the free version
[2:35:54.940 --> 2:35:59.940]  You scroll down to find that, or there you can pay for the prescription, the prescription, the subscription one
[2:35:59.940 --> 2:36:04.940]  Because it is a subscription to tyranny, the prescription to stop it
[2:36:04.940 --> 2:36:10.300]  it because it pays for the bandwidth of this platform. This is going to be like YouTube,
[2:36:10.300 --> 2:36:16.460]  but our own platform that's high-tech being updated that hundreds of reporters and users
[2:36:16.460 --> 2:36:20.940]  that I plan to end up getting on here will be able to then put intel out. So we'll have reporters
[2:36:20.940 --> 2:36:26.620]  like Millie Weaver on the East Coast or you know other reporters you know let's say out in New Mexico
[2:36:26.620 --> 2:36:33.180]  who are then able to whenever they want to file a report from home or the street or during a rally
[2:36:33.180 --> 2:36:39.500]  or a plane crash or a baby's birth or gardening or whatever it is I could just say here boom
[2:36:39.500 --> 2:36:44.220]  you're a trusted reporter or contributor you're part of InfoWars Prime and it's got a lot of other
[2:36:44.220 --> 2:36:51.740]  it's got alerts so we can send you emergency alerts also update alerts infowars.com slash app
[2:36:51.740 --> 2:36:54.460]  and I want to thank you all for your support and then briefly we do have as I said free shipping

[2:37:08.140 --> 2:37:13.340]  nine and you're making it all possible just like Trump didn't take corporate money or globalist
[2:37:13.340 --> 2:37:17.740]  money and didn't take Hollywood money and they all put billions against him he won well InfoWars
[2:37:17.740 --> 2:37:22.860]  is winning going directly to you he broke all records of small donations he's against NAFTA
[2:37:22.860 --> 2:37:28.380]  GATT the TPP globalization we're under your calls in a moment but I appreciate Monique holding but a
[2:37:28.380 --> 2:37:32.540]  wrap up what do you make of just everything they did everything they threw at him failing
[2:37:32.540 --> 2:37:37.660]  because the people were behind him they tried to steal some states they did he still won in a
[2:37:38.700 --> 2:37:43.900]  electoral college landslide what do you think's going on in the globalist war rooms right now
[2:37:45.820 --> 2:37:51.900]  well they're trying to figure out everything they can possibly do to stop him I mean they want to
[2:37:51.900 --> 2:38:00.780]  promote tremendous civil unrest in the country no question about it it wouldn't surprise me if we saw
[2:38:00.780 --> 2:38:09.340]  quote a national student strike in America where they would somehow organize you know many we're
[2:38:09.340 --> 2:38:14.620]  talking high schools colleges just to go out on strike block roads run around and then and then
[2:38:14.620 --> 2:38:19.580]  have a fake grip consciousness that they're fighting racism anybody that's a nationalist is now a
[2:38:19.580 --> 2:38:25.260]  racist you're you're part of the white lash so a giant demonization of white people yeah a giant
[2:38:25.260 --> 2:38:31.500]  a giant demonization and also a demonization of the country as a whole it's like uh if you want
[2:38:31.500 --> 2:38:36.780]  to boil this thing down it's like somebody walks up to one of the people in the protest said look
[2:38:36.780 --> 2:38:41.980]  I can get you a job it's a productive job I know you're not working I know you have no money do you
[2:38:41.980 --> 2:38:47.980]  want a job a decent job no I don't want any of that I don't want anything to do with that
[2:38:47.980 --> 2:38:53.180]  or where it comes from or the society that promotes it or the infrastructure that allowed it to be
[2:38:53.180 --> 2:39:00.380]  created I want to stand out here and destroy everything that I can that's my mission because
[2:39:00.380 --> 2:39:05.500]  that's love baby you know I mean it's complete and by the way that's what they do I had this guy
[2:39:05.500 --> 2:39:10.220]  asked me yesterday you liked Trump and I went yeah he he wants to cut taxes 40 000 dollars
[2:39:10.220 --> 2:39:19.660]  you're less and the guy went oh yeah you started thinking about his own bank account right well
[2:39:19.660 --> 2:39:23.660]  they don't get how hard it is to build this infrastructure I love how soft these kids are
[2:39:23.660 --> 2:39:27.580]  they're sitting there in the middle of this infrastructure that is falling apart they'll
[2:39:27.580 --> 2:39:32.620]  be crying for mommy if it does I love black lives matter up in Dallas when the black lives matter guy
[2:39:32.620 --> 2:39:37.340]  kills five cops and shoots other people and they're running around screaming police help us police
[2:39:37.340 --> 2:39:45.260]  police really really I mean I've never seen anything like it because here we have an opportunity
[2:39:45.260 --> 2:39:51.580]  we started off by talking about solutions okay we have an opportunity to plug in now because
[2:39:51.580 --> 2:39:58.300]  the alternative media as is called is so much more powerful than it's ever been it's a dwarfing
[2:39:59.100 --> 2:40:04.300]  the traditional media or the major media which are dying I mean they're just and now they're not
[2:40:04.300 --> 2:40:08.620]  in control they don't get to hand it over as easy they don't get to wage war against us as easy
[2:40:08.620 --> 2:40:13.340]  they don't get their supreme court justices they don't get wow whether they have left they have
[2:40:13.340 --> 2:40:18.700]  nothing left except to whine and complain and try to be clever about it and so forth you look at
[2:40:19.420 --> 2:40:25.100]  two days ago I looked at the editorial pages of New York Times it was unbelievable one writer after
[2:40:25.100 --> 2:40:31.740]  another those more me little turtles talking about Trump and this and a president danger
[2:40:31.740 --> 2:40:35.900]  and there the country is going to hell you know and all their little stuff I mean they had like
[2:40:35.900 --> 2:40:40.620]  six or seven editorial writers spewing out this nonsense and they only say like five different
[2:40:40.620 --> 2:40:46.220]  lines yeah you're a racist you're a bigot you're a homophobe you're dumb you're uneducated you're
[2:40:46.220 --> 2:40:51.900]  a dumb midwestern white person and they're almost all white people I it's this weird thing where
[2:40:51.900 --> 2:40:57.020]  someone screams you can't have an opinion you're an effing white male and it's some mom's basement
[2:40:57.020 --> 2:41:02.380]  zit faced I'm like it's this point it's the archetype lazy bomb telling you this to your face
[2:41:03.740 --> 2:41:07.980]  what was it three weeks ago report came out on the New York Times that in this quarter
[2:41:08.700 --> 2:41:18.060]  the category I think they called it profitable acts assets sank 97 percent at the New York Times
[2:41:18.060 --> 2:41:26.940]  that's right a last quarter 97.5 percent loss in revenue and they're refinancing the financing
[2:41:26.940 --> 2:41:32.060]  of the red ink that they originally financed and they're tapping and here's the deal all that
[2:41:32.060 --> 2:41:37.180]  kingpin mexico money I mean the mexican slush fund you know the kingpin wink wink owns them
[2:41:38.300 --> 2:41:42.380]  the guy that gets obama phone money now there's no reason for him to even own it because it didn't
[2:41:42.380 --> 2:41:48.380]  pay off exactly so why should he even be there in fact you said that before the election you said
[2:41:48.380 --> 2:41:52.460]  if they lose they're gonna call all these executives in and say you're all fired we're cutting all
[2:41:52.460 --> 2:41:58.220]  these divisions none of you were able to deliver right look what's gonna I mean look what's gonna
[2:41:58.220 --> 2:42:04.860]  happen to the Clinton Foundation uh all these people that gave money and expected favors to
[2:42:04.860 --> 2:42:11.100]  continue on into the future with Hillary Clinton as president and now all of a sudden what favors
[2:42:11.100 --> 2:42:16.380]  are they going to get they're not going to get any favors well we donated 15 million dollars
[2:42:16.380 --> 2:42:23.100]  to you turkeys and where's the payoff so now what I expect to be happening is some of these
[2:42:23.100 --> 2:42:29.980]  people that are very angry are going to start themselves leaking information more information
[2:42:29.980 --> 2:42:34.700]  on the Clinton Foundation because this is a parallel state department I mean instead of
[2:42:34.700 --> 2:42:40.540]  diplomatic give and take that supposedly is the earmark of the state department this is you give
[2:42:40.540 --> 2:42:45.100]  and then we let you take you know that's sure we're going to call us right now but I got to
[2:42:45.100 --> 2:42:47.820]  ask you this question and we'll continue on to the next hour we're gonna go to him now
[2:42:49.900 --> 2:42:55.660]  the Clinton's had to try to steal this because they're in a corner what are they thinking now
[2:42:55.660 --> 2:43:00.060]  though as the whole world turns against them a and then b people are saying well Trump needs to
[2:43:00.060 --> 2:43:04.620]  be nice so the stock market stays up it needs to be conciliatory and but they're not ever gonna
[2:43:04.620 --> 2:43:10.060]  back off justice has to be done we're not vindictive he has to fulfill the promise there have to be
[2:43:10.060 --> 2:43:14.140]  indictments there has to be a special prosecutor this whole nest must go to prison
[2:43:14.140 --> 2:43:21.100]  exactly you can't suddenly say I'm the great healer and we're gonna build bridges that would
[2:43:21.100 --> 2:43:29.180]  be a serious mistake on his part he got here by claiming that he was going to drain the swamp
[2:43:29.980 --> 2:43:35.740]  well they're right in the middle of the swamp there they are the most visible figures you've
[2:43:35.740 --> 2:43:41.420]  got to continue to go after giant giant squid and and and flesh eating octopuses there's
[2:43:41.420 --> 2:43:46.380]  Bill and Hillary the giant stinking monsters that have come out of the loins of George Soros
[2:43:47.900 --> 2:43:54.940]  I mean what would you do what I would do prosecute file charges arrest them
[2:43:56.060 --> 2:44:01.740]  take them to court don't make a deal that's what Putin did with the oligarchs bring out all the
[2:44:01.740 --> 2:44:11.180]  evidence let's see it all release the evidence open court prosecute don't give in don't budge
[2:44:11.180 --> 2:44:18.060]  an inch keep moving forward attack because justice is on your side and it doesn't matter what major
[2:44:18.060 --> 2:44:21.980]  media say or this or that and the other thing because enough evidence is going to come out
[2:44:22.540 --> 2:44:28.540]  so that whatever the new york times or cbs or cnn has to say they're going to end up with egg on
[2:44:28.540 --> 2:44:31.580]  their face just like they did that's right and i'm going to tell trump something he knows this
[2:44:31.580 --> 2:44:34.780]  he's a he's a good guy he's a great guy the patriots the people in the government the
[2:44:34.780 --> 2:44:41.820]  military that risked their lives let them get killed uh trust you but if you don't deliver
[2:44:43.980 --> 2:44:48.140]  understand Hillary's gonna be the least of your problems that's right if you don't deliver so
[2:44:48.700 --> 2:44:55.580]  you got here by saying certain things so you've got to deliver now and you can't back off of the
[2:44:55.580 --> 2:45:02.140]  clintons and you can't say well so many people feel sorry for them now and let's listen to the
[2:45:02.140 --> 2:45:09.500]  uh uh sci-op advisors who say well uh the surveys show that people want you to leave them alone and
[2:45:09.500 --> 2:45:14.620]  let them slink off no no no no no no no no no leave them right there in the spotlight
[2:45:15.180 --> 2:45:19.340]  appoint a new attorney general that's not going to mess around that's right keep them in the spotlight
[2:45:19.340 --> 2:45:23.580]  trump or the or or it's or all of it's going to be on us we've got to go on offense because that's
[2:45:23.580 --> 2:45:29.820]  our defense exactly you keep them back on their heels with seven or eight different vectors at
[2:45:29.820 --> 2:45:37.340]  the same time so they have to play defense you've got to do this you can't just think that everything
[2:45:37.340 --> 2:45:43.020]  is okay now because the empire is already striking back and they intend to keep striking back okay
[2:45:43.020 --> 2:45:50.380]  fine that's the game that's the war all right bill hillary you're in the spotlight baby now we're
[2:45:50.380 --> 2:45:55.020]  going to take you to court now we're going to show everything that we know about you the whole
[2:45:55.020 --> 2:45:58.940]  works and by the way private citizens have been affected by this pay-to-play and breaking laws and
[2:45:58.940 --> 2:46:03.180]  bid rigging and stuff so private citizens should look in the wiki licensee of your company or you
[2:46:03.180 --> 2:46:07.980]  are in there and start your own class actions absolutely and remember what happened in oklahoma
[2:46:07.980 --> 2:46:13.340]  city when uh charles keys formed the uh citizen grand and the lawyers said we found out exactly
[2:46:13.340 --> 2:46:18.300]  above the building up even all their names exactly so how about some citizen grand juries around the
[2:46:18.300 --> 2:46:24.860]  country empowering themselves to uh you know make a case their case against the clintons and what
[2:46:24.860 --> 2:46:28.940]  and then those get delivered to real grand juries or state houses a lot of times cause a real investigation
[2:46:28.940 --> 2:46:32.940]  it's a mock event but it has the effect and they can also have some legal effect uh monica thank
[2:46:32.940 --> 2:46:37.340]  you for holding your real trooper i've been out of control today uh we're going to send monica uh
[2:46:37.340 --> 2:46:40.300]  any type of interest circle she wants us to address john oh that's a hassle let's do it
[2:46:40.300 --> 2:46:48.460]  monica thank you for calling today from canada hi thanks for having me i i've got two observations
[2:46:48.460 --> 2:46:53.340]  as a canadian and a question for you because we're on pins and needles with this question
[2:46:53.340 --> 2:46:59.740]  um first of all the observation is the elitist i live in western canada alberta the province of
[2:46:59.740 --> 2:47:06.940]  oil and they shut down our oil fields the elitist shut down our oil fields and why we know this
[2:47:06.940 --> 2:47:16.620]  is that the east canadian east is shipping oil from venezuela and saudi arabia and yet they shut
[2:47:16.620 --> 2:47:22.300]  down the alberta oil well you know who did that again it's soros again because he controls with
[2:47:22.300 --> 2:47:29.500]  berkshire hathaway uh and uh the guy that owns that all of the major railwaves that are involved
[2:47:29.500 --> 2:47:35.980]  they're warren buffett i mean you can't make this up and trump was the first one to address hey
[2:47:35.980 --> 2:47:42.460]  why is opac you know running our oil and that's saudi but anyway that's my great how trump is
[2:47:42.460 --> 2:47:47.820]  right on like nine nine percent of stuff he just he isn't out to screw us no and you know it's he's
[2:47:47.820 --> 2:47:54.140]  gonna you know what happens in the states affects canadian people don't know man it was soros and
[2:47:54.140 --> 2:47:59.260]  berkshire hathaway warren buffett that spent it was like 50 million dollars over the last six years
[2:47:59.260 --> 2:48:04.620]  killing the pipeline for your oil to come to us all the way down they made all these rules where
[2:48:04.620 --> 2:48:09.580]  it has to be shipped in again as you said by tanker and then on their trains which is a tax
[2:48:09.580 --> 2:48:14.460]  where they tax everybody all the way over across canada in the east but they're all these liberals
[2:48:14.460 --> 2:48:20.540]  not even knowing there's an invisible berkshire hathaway tax george soros tax it's what i mean
[2:48:20.540 --> 2:48:27.820]  everything we look at these people are involved scamming us wrap up work and and yeah i mean
[2:48:27.820 --> 2:48:32.860]  they're taking here's my piece and then i get another piece here and i get another piece here
[2:48:32.860 --> 2:48:41.340]  and i get another piece here but of course i'm a socialist i'm a great guy i want equal treatment
[2:48:41.340 --> 2:48:45.740]  for everybody as long as i can keep taking my piece here my piece there my piece here my piece
[2:48:45.740 --> 2:48:52.140]  there right so there's soros funding move on dot org that's organizing whatever it is 200 by
[2:48:52.140 --> 2:48:56.140]  violent demonstrations funds the fake admire middle groups who mail meaning hollywood folks
[2:48:56.140 --> 2:49:01.580]  tying themselves to pipelines they have no idea what they're doing no i am go ahead anything else
[2:49:02.700 --> 2:49:09.660]  yes um in wiki leaks yesterday um it was the first part of the very first thing out of wiki
[2:49:09.660 --> 2:49:16.540]  leaks tying our prime minister to bedesta he would our prime minister was asking the clinton's to
[2:49:16.540 --> 2:49:22.700]  write his speech before he got elected i know you can't tell you can't tell us that the elitists are
[2:49:22.700 --> 2:49:26.940]  running canada worse than the state well i run a pretty good size operation and and you know my
[2:49:26.940 --> 2:49:30.540]  kids sometimes they help you know how homework and i'm like can you just write your own article
[2:49:30.540 --> 2:49:35.100]  i can't imagine hillary and her staff were like writing the new york times washington post canadian
[2:49:35.100 --> 2:49:41.980]  you know premier is just the they do work like demons john yeah they do they work like demons
[2:49:41.980 --> 2:49:47.420]  because they have to try to you know it's like uh people are running after you and you have to
[2:49:47.420 --> 2:49:51.580]  keep on running in order to stay ahead and that's what the clinton's have been doing for at least
[2:49:51.580 --> 2:49:58.700]  30 years is trying to stay ahead of prosecution for crimes and they they're continuing to run
[2:49:59.340 --> 2:50:04.380]  hillary figured well the best way to do this is to walk into the oval office and take over
[2:50:04.380 --> 2:50:09.900]  because then i can really get rid of all the people that are chasing me but that didn't work out
[2:50:10.540 --> 2:50:17.420]  and so now they would like to slink away but as we just discussed that should not be in the cards
[2:50:17.420 --> 2:50:23.100]  they should be right in the spotlight here's the new attorney general here's the right thing to do
[2:50:23.100 --> 2:50:28.300]  and it keeps the heat off of our america agenda he's got to do it he's got to do it we have to go
[2:50:28.300 --> 2:50:33.100]  on full offense look they're look they're activating the soros crowds the buses we caught the buses
[2:50:33.100 --> 2:50:39.660]  last night on tape they see all hillary it she's still attacking she's not being conciliatory

[2:55:06.460 --> 2:55:11.340]  they're going into high gear to further try to divide the country this is a big repudiation of that
[2:55:12.380 --> 2:55:18.780]  but they're only doubling down is that because that's the only tactic they know or is it because
[2:55:19.900 --> 2:55:24.220]  down the road they believe demographically if they can turn different groups of people against
[2:55:24.220 --> 2:55:29.340]  each other that's the only way the elite can rule i want to go to calls right before but just briefly
[2:55:29.340 --> 2:55:35.340]  this looks like stupidity to me i mean i think their calculus is wrong they thought they were
[2:55:35.340 --> 2:55:39.580]  going to win here a civil war is going to blow up in their face as well i mean i've looked at
[2:55:39.580 --> 2:55:44.220]  the topography of this and all the real folks that are working and successful i don't care what
[2:55:44.220 --> 2:55:49.340]  color they are want no part of a civil war or shooting police in the back of the head that's
[2:55:49.340 --> 2:55:54.380]  right it's going to do the same thing that happened to them during the election campaign it's going to
[2:55:54.380 --> 2:56:01.340]  jump right back at him because millions of people are going to say what is that i don't want that
[2:56:02.380 --> 2:56:07.260]  i don't want this certainly any place near me and i've got friends all over the country
[2:56:07.260 --> 2:56:14.140]  they don't want it either what is this we don't want it it's not productive it's not asking for
[2:56:14.140 --> 2:56:20.940]  something that we you know we can solve problems without this we don't need well john i can tell
[2:56:20.940 --> 2:56:24.700]  this is hurting you so you're trying to think of solutions and i agree too but it's the worst i've
[2:56:24.700 --> 2:56:29.100]  ever seen it um it happened to me twice just to have everybody i know that's basically white
[2:56:29.100 --> 2:56:34.060]  especially white women i guess there's some you know they're seen as weak folks are coming over and
[2:56:34.060 --> 2:56:37.820]  like really bugging their eyes out asking are you a trump supporter and some people say yeah
[2:56:37.820 --> 2:56:43.020]  they're getting beaten um this this this is really shameful i mean i'm wondering what type of mind
[2:56:43.020 --> 2:56:48.220]  control msnbc has been able to have a just how shameful do they have any shame over there what
[2:56:48.220 --> 2:56:55.020]  they've done no absolutely not none of these media outlets do they're just covertly trying to stir up
[2:56:55.020 --> 2:56:59.660]  civil unrest civil war do you imagine if i got up here and said black people are out to get you and
[2:56:59.660 --> 2:57:02.940]  you just see any of them out there you need to you know beat them up i mean that's what newsweek
[2:57:02.940 --> 2:57:07.580]  and time remember they said last year they said it's time to burn cities right i mean but burn
[2:57:07.580 --> 2:57:14.300]  your own town i mean what the hell is this it's complete insanity that's their agenda that's what i
[2:57:14.300 --> 2:57:20.060]  mean these reporters and these editors and i've been around them long enough to know you've worked
[2:57:20.060 --> 2:57:25.500]  at major newspapers as an investigator so what do they do they pick up a paycheck they know what
[2:57:25.500 --> 2:57:30.460]  they're supposed to do and they do it they know if they don't do what they're supposed to do they're
[2:57:30.460 --> 2:57:37.580]  out they are one thing that mainstream reporters are very good at is detecting which way the winds
[2:57:37.580 --> 2:57:42.220]  are blowing and what they're supposed to say and what they're supposed to do and they can do it
[2:57:42.220 --> 2:57:48.220]  that's their skill okay now the trend is saying this now we have to go in that direction that's
[2:57:48.220 --> 2:57:54.220]  what the bosses want that's what i'm here to do i'm a sellout basically as one reporter
[2:57:54.220 --> 2:57:59.740]  said on wikileaks hey i'm a hack tell me what to do and i'll do it well that's what they all are
[2:57:59.740 --> 2:58:06.380]  they're all hacks they're all waiting to be told what to do and so i have so many guests on and they

[3:00:21.820 --> 3:00:24.860]  destroyer was gonna host the fourth hour but i'm all hyped up i'm gonna be here too but
[3:00:25.500 --> 3:00:29.900]  i have to have a quick meeting for five minutes during this break after we take some calls

[3:00:33.740 --> 3:00:37.980]  in and i'll be in the guest seat and we're gonna be talking to john rapaport no more fake news
[3:00:37.980 --> 3:00:44.060]  dot com about future threats bigger fights what he sees down the road because again all these
[3:00:44.060 --> 3:00:49.500]  space cadets folks think if i bring something up negative it's been to depress them or make them
[3:00:49.500 --> 3:00:56.860]  feel powerless no it's so you know what's coming so we can defeat it but again the jellyfish never
[3:00:56.860 --> 3:01:02.540]  mattered i'm here raising the alarm for folks that do care and i you know i misunderstood a lot of
[3:01:02.540 --> 3:01:05.740]  this earlier in life i'm talking about that a little bit later on the broadcast but i just saw
[3:01:05.740 --> 3:01:10.380]  the state as the vehicle the elites so i always saw it as bad and a big state is always bad
[3:01:11.500 --> 3:01:15.180]  but then i thought maybe the enforcers are really bad because that's how the state will
[3:01:15.180 --> 3:01:18.860]  try to make me do this but it's enforcers even though they have problems historically
[3:01:18.860 --> 3:01:23.660]  that are willing to put themselves on the line and who do live in the real world and so those
[3:01:23.660 --> 3:01:28.780]  were the very people that were actually listening to me and actually responding on average the most
[3:01:28.780 --> 3:01:32.780]  even though i was critical of them and didn't understand it all they'd laugh at me and say
[3:01:32.780 --> 3:01:37.420]  you'll get it down the road and now as i've experienced more and more of this my knowledge
[3:01:37.420 --> 3:01:42.460]  basis clicked and i just wonder you know as we get older uh if we go down the path of knowledge
[3:01:42.460 --> 3:01:49.660]  i mean does it get better and better john rapaport i think it does absolutely and one of the big
[3:01:49.660 --> 3:01:55.420]  things up the road we have to look at here alex is the trade treaties i mean obama is going to try
[3:01:55.420 --> 3:02:01.420]  to ram the tpp the trans specific partnership through during the lame duck session of congress
[3:02:02.220 --> 3:02:06.780]  this is another one of these big globalist trade treaties uh people have certainly heard
[3:02:06.780 --> 3:02:10.140]  let's get to that in the rest of the hour you're awesome let's go to a call i'm being a pig here
[3:02:10.140 --> 3:02:13.260]  with john i want to take some calls john in florida you're on the air thanks for holding
[3:02:16.940 --> 3:02:23.020]  john are you there my friend uh or justin in florida go ahead yeah i'm here welcome go ahead
[3:02:23.020 --> 3:02:29.100]  justin hey thanks for having me on i appreciate it um yeah so basically i just i have some
[3:02:29.100 --> 3:02:34.540]  solutions on you know and i'm glad that you guys brought the topic of solutions um
[3:02:35.260 --> 3:02:42.940]  because you know at this time we know america wants justice and uh you know citizens grand jury
[3:02:42.940 --> 3:02:46.700]  like you guys have mentioned would be great but most people just don't know how to do that
[3:02:46.700 --> 3:02:53.500]  or how to get that started and a lot of them like i can talk about on the air but some of them
[3:02:53.500 --> 3:02:58.380]  i really can't so you may have if you want to talk further on those at a later time we'll do that
[3:02:59.020 --> 3:03:02.540]  well you're on the air live brother so you want to you know i mean give us some of your ideas for
[3:03:02.540 --> 3:03:06.780]  solutions all i know is this pull our money out of big corporate institutions that are globalist
[3:03:07.500 --> 3:03:14.220]  support independent media and culture uh reach out to people educate people uh and you know have
[3:03:14.220 --> 3:03:20.700]  organic farms by american uh expose the globalist agenda i mean what else can we do yeah i mean i
[3:03:20.700 --> 3:03:27.580]  like i like those ideas um i'm thinking some trump sponsored outreaches to where we're getting into
[3:03:27.580 --> 3:03:33.020]  the community now um when he come when he came to florida he drew a huge crowd when he went
[3:03:33.020 --> 3:03:36.860]  everywhere he went in the united states he drew a huge crowd so it's not a problem of getting people
[3:03:36.860 --> 3:03:41.500]  together to go out and spread the word and keep spreading the word and keep doing the job that
[3:03:41.500 --> 3:03:46.460]  we need done but we need to stay connected with real people you know we need to make sure that
[3:03:46.460 --> 3:03:50.620]  our new president which my new president is donald j trump and we need to be sure
[3:03:51.420 --> 3:03:57.260]  that i agree and and and john report what about this i think trump should do because he's such a
[3:03:57.260 --> 3:04:04.300]  workhorse maybe a week long 25 city tour where he goes directly into these blue zones directly into
[3:04:04.300 --> 3:04:10.700]  the sanctuary cities and says look if there's felons in your town we need them out we're
[3:04:10.700 --> 3:04:15.340]  saying you have to be here legally that's common sense mexico does that china does that but i want
[3:04:15.340 --> 3:04:19.900]  to bring jobs here i want to i want to build you up i'm your friend these democrats are just
[3:04:19.900 --> 3:04:26.140]  basically keeping you as a permanent undocumented underclass if he does that suddenly there's
[3:04:26.140 --> 3:04:32.300]  going to be visible people that have been invisible for a long time i'm not talking about the people
[3:04:32.300 --> 3:04:38.220]  who are uh illegals in the sanctuary cities i'm talking about people that are out of work people
[3:04:38.220 --> 3:04:43.100]  who have been thrown out of work by the globalists they're going to start showing up and he's going
[3:04:43.100 --> 3:04:47.900]  to be talking to them and that's the big game changer that's the key come visible that's why
[3:04:47.900 --> 3:04:51.900]  trump knew he'd win we're getting people of a race color and creed that were disenfranchised
[3:04:51.900 --> 3:04:56.940]  and not even in the system to come back we'll be right back great points tested more calls straight
[3:04:56.940 --> 3:05:03.420]  ahead now we're just two months away from january 2017 when president trump takes power but let's
[3:05:03.420 --> 3:05:08.140]  take a look at how his tax plan may impact your returns mbc is reporting if trump sticks to his
[3:05:08.140 --> 3:05:12.140]  campaign promises here are the major things his administration will change they'll reduce seven
[3:05:12.140 --> 3:05:17.260]  federal tax brackets down to three with rates of 12 percent 25 percent and 33 percent increases in
[3:05:17.260 --> 3:05:24.460]  the standard deduction from 6300 to 15 000 for single filers and from 12 600 to 30 000 for married
[3:05:24.460 --> 3:05:29.340]  couples the irony is all those silicon valley millionaires and billionaires athletes and rock
[3:05:29.340 --> 3:05:33.500]  stars that all supported hillary clinton are going to be seeing some of the biggest tax returns in
[3:05:33.500 --> 3:05:38.380]  fact forbs is reporting that trump's tax plan could save lebron james over 15 million dollars per
[3:05:38.380 --> 3:05:43.340]  year but the coup de grau and trump's tax plan will be lowering the business tax rate from 35
[3:05:43.340 --> 3:05:48.460]  percent to 15 percent and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax this is going to unleash
[3:05:48.460 --> 3:05:52.780]  a rash of hirings across the country and hopefully bring businesses who moved overseas back to the
[3:05:52.780 --> 3:05:57.420]  united states thereby increasing jobs robert reporting for info wars dot com and info wars
[3:05:57.420 --> 3:06:03.420]  nightly news you know in the coming election no matter who gets in one of the biggest issues nobody's
[3:06:03.420 --> 3:06:08.380]  talking about on the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid the potential
[3:06:08.380 --> 3:06:16.300]  for power grid chaos emp cyber warfare not to mention dangerous weather hurricanes ice storms
[3:06:16.300 --> 3:06:21.420]  all a very real threat to our grid my friends chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot
[3:06:21.420 --> 3:06:26.620]  worse that's why i believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply
[3:06:26.620 --> 3:06:31.980]  of backup electricity now i've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house the
[3:06:31.980 --> 3:06:37.580]  solutions from science system simply put this thing is amazing solutions from science only
[3:06:37.580 --> 3:06:44.140]  makes the best equipment go to power grid chaos dot com that's power grid chaos dot com to check
[3:06:44.140 --> 3:06:51.180]  it out now this is key right now get 70 off their top of the line perfect power solar generator

[3:06:59.020 --> 3:07:05.900]  completely different try a bottle of it rob do joins us you worked i guess like 20 plus hours

[3:07:15.740 --> 3:07:19.340]  and i really wanted to do a good job on the interview i got my bottle of brain force right
[3:07:19.340 --> 3:07:24.780]  there and popped two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like everything just kind of clears up
[3:07:24.780 --> 3:07:29.820]  it's got four and a half stars people really love it read about it find out why third party
[3:07:29.820 --> 3:07:34.620]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic
[3:07:34.620 --> 3:07:38.780]  based systems that will blow your socks off i haven't pulled it all night or like that in a
[3:07:38.780 --> 3:07:43.900]  while but i probably could not have done it without brain force i went home about 645 this morning

[3:08:05.980 --> 3:08:14.220]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:14.220 --> 3:08:22.860]  welcome back to the alex jones show we are in the fourth hour owen shroyer filling in here alex
[3:08:22.860 --> 3:08:27.740]  will be rejoining us here momentarily john rapport still with us of no more fake news dot com
[3:08:28.620 --> 3:08:34.700]  and it's very important folks we need to remember this we need to continue to harp this we need to
[3:08:34.700 --> 3:08:41.660]  continue to preach this we need to continue to sing this we won and it's not just about donald trump
[3:08:41.660 --> 3:08:49.020]  it's the fact that we beat the mainstream news we beat obama we beat the pope we beat all of
[3:08:49.020 --> 3:08:53.900]  these fake leaders who told us we couldn't have trump said there's no way trump could win tried
[3:08:53.900 --> 3:08:59.820]  to brainwash us into thinking trump could never win we beat all of them and i know that we got
[3:08:59.820 --> 3:09:03.820]  to get back to fighting the good fight here we got to deal with these protesters that
[3:09:03.820 --> 3:09:10.300]  we all expected would kick off but we beat them we beat them and i think that it's okay for us to
[3:09:10.300 --> 3:09:16.620]  take some solace in that fact and to take some time to actually enjoy that and i'm curious you know
[3:09:16.620 --> 3:09:22.220]  john what what are you thinking right now as we've entered this time where we're looking at
[3:09:23.020 --> 3:09:30.380]  perhaps we're taking back the narrative we're taking back the reality and still though we're
[3:09:30.380 --> 3:09:35.900]  facing this backlash with the mainstream media continuing to shovel out nonsense the brainwash
[3:09:35.900 --> 3:09:41.820]  protesters going out on the streets and protesting what how does this come to a head do you think
[3:09:41.820 --> 3:09:51.980]  john rap report and is there an end in sight what i see is the seesaw has shifted tremendously
[3:09:53.340 --> 3:10:00.780]  as alex and i were talking in the last hour alternative media as people like to call it
[3:10:00.780 --> 3:10:09.420]  it is on such a rise now is expanded to such an incredible degree that major media just don't
[3:10:09.420 --> 3:10:15.500]  know what to do they just don't know how to deal with it they don't talk about it it expands anyway
[3:10:15.500 --> 3:10:23.340]  they talk about it it gets bigger even bigger that fueled with however you want to look at it
[3:10:23.340 --> 3:10:29.500]  the victory of trump or the defeat of hillary is now throwing the whole globalist agenda
[3:10:29.500 --> 3:10:38.300]  into grave doubt so we have tremendous victories on our side right now and we have to inject
[3:10:39.580 --> 3:10:45.820]  as a friend of mine was saying to me yesterday real solutions into this mix and we can do it and
[3:10:45.820 --> 3:10:53.020]  they will be noticed because the size of the alternative media is now so powerful it's not
[3:10:53.020 --> 3:11:00.460]  like somebody off in a corner saying hey mr president i've got this idea and so uh no this
[3:11:00.460 --> 3:11:08.220]  is gigantic websites all over the world that are reporting news actual news truthful news
[3:11:09.100 --> 3:11:15.180]  are blowing up it's huge well and you know there is so if we talk about solutions here
[3:11:15.180 --> 3:11:20.940]  for example millions of people already hear about it and they be and and trump notices it
[3:11:20.940 --> 3:11:27.740]  roger so notices all kinds of people notice it not just the incoming president is having a huge
[3:11:27.740 --> 3:11:34.940]  effect now and the crazy thing or i guess the difference is you know our audience is actually
[3:11:34.940 --> 3:11:41.260]  engaged our audience is actually active they'll go out they'll build a garden uh they'll go out
[3:11:41.260 --> 3:11:48.300]  they'll make a health product to fight the uh fluoride in the water whereas so we're ingesting
[3:11:48.300 --> 3:11:51.820]  solutions or we're injecting solutions as you said but you think about the other side of the
[3:11:51.820 --> 3:11:57.740]  spectrum the cnn audience uh the msnbc audience what are they doing what's their solution they're
[3:11:57.740 --> 3:12:03.260]  out in the streets protesting they're burning american flags they're starting five they're just
[3:12:03.260 --> 3:12:10.460]  sitting there you know that's the other thing they're doing zombie land uh huh the news here we go
[3:12:10.460 --> 3:12:15.980]  okay it's the news again oh look at that oh look at that oh yeah okay that's the end of the news
[3:12:15.980 --> 3:12:22.300]  okay and then tomorrow they do the same thing here's talking about solutions
[3:12:25.100 --> 3:12:31.180]  health freedom as i said to alex in the last hour a couple of states some years ago passed
[3:12:31.180 --> 3:12:38.220]  laws that said no matter what kind of practitioner you are health practitioner if you're treating
[3:12:38.220 --> 3:12:47.020]  a person for a condition with a remedy that is no more harmful than the medical remedy for the
[3:12:47.020 --> 3:12:54.220]  same condition you're home free nobody can do anything to you that's a pretty good idea now
[3:12:54.220 --> 3:13:01.660]  just imagine for a moment that some state roll the dice who cares what it is uh let's say south
[3:13:01.660 --> 3:13:07.020]  carolina decides that they're going to pass that and they're going to back it up no matter what's
[3:13:07.020 --> 3:13:14.700]  the medical authorities say health freedom what happens all manner of health practitioners from
[3:13:14.700 --> 3:13:22.700]  all over the country including the best of the best move to south carolina and set up shop not only
[3:13:22.700 --> 3:13:27.980]  that but their clients and potential clients and all kinds of people that want natural health
[3:13:28.940 --> 3:13:33.980]  move to south carolina because they know they can get it and it's going to be free of government
[3:13:33.980 --> 3:13:41.260]  intervention now south carolina's economy is booming in a way that it's never boomed before
[3:13:41.260 --> 3:13:46.780]  that's called a solution that's called freedom that's called the kind of thing that could be
[3:13:46.780 --> 3:13:53.900]  encouraged by this incoming administration just on the basis of economics alone do you want to
[3:13:53.900 --> 3:14:01.820]  make your state extremely prosperous think about this no harm no foul you've got chiropractors
[3:14:01.820 --> 3:14:07.020]  acupuncturists herbalists nutritionists of all stripes and so on and so forth forget about
[3:14:07.020 --> 3:14:13.900]  the dietitians and all these other organizations and the medical idiots and boards that are trying
[3:14:13.900 --> 3:14:19.740]  to enforce everything on everybody and destroy their freedom no we're going to pass a law you
[3:14:19.740 --> 3:14:25.740]  guys are out of it you do what you want to everybody else can do what they want to and the economy
[3:14:25.740 --> 3:14:34.380]  is going to blow up in whatever state decides to do that that's called the free market and i think
[3:14:34.380 --> 3:14:38.780]  one of the biggest solutions is just already happening organically where people are just
[3:14:38.780 --> 3:14:43.660]  finally engaged they're finally getting informed it's not just the drive-by media audience it's
[3:14:43.660 --> 3:14:48.540]  not just the people who supported obama i mean where have they been for the last eight years
[3:14:48.540 --> 3:14:53.660]  they haven't held obama's feet to the fire on any of the promises he broke i guarantee you
[3:14:53.660 --> 3:14:58.380]  if trump goes sideways the first minute he goes sideways all the people that voted for trump
[3:14:58.380 --> 3:15:03.180]  will be on him the media is going to be on him the entire time anyway will be on him so i think
[3:15:03.180 --> 3:15:08.220]  that that's a solution here that's just kind of already ingrained into the election of trump into
[3:15:08.220 --> 3:15:12.380]  the trump movement that we're already seeing where americans are starting to care about the country
[3:15:12.380 --> 3:15:18.220]  they're starting to see what the real threats to the future of this country were and they're
[3:15:18.220 --> 3:15:23.580]  identifying them and that's why we've elected trump into office despite everything that they've
[3:15:23.580 --> 3:15:28.380]  tried to wage to keep him out of office i want to go to a couple more callers these guys have been
[3:15:28.380 --> 3:15:33.100]  kind enough to wait uh for hours just to come on the show uh let's go to david in nevada who wants
[3:15:33.100 --> 3:15:39.340]  to talk about the zombie-like quality of the protesters go ahead david hello hello hello can
[3:15:39.340 --> 3:15:45.180]  you hear me can you hear me oh i can hear you loud and clear david okay great yeah hey did you see
[3:15:45.180 --> 3:15:50.380]  those protesters this morning which one's exactly the one's burning the american flag those those
[3:15:50.380 --> 3:15:55.020]  those disgraceful protesters look look at all of them look at the different ones and look in their
[3:15:55.020 --> 3:15:59.900]  eyes well look here's the deal here's the deal david okay i mean i'm sure that you've seen
[3:15:59.900 --> 3:16:03.500]  i'm sure that you've seen the videos that i've done where i go out on the streets and i confront
[3:16:03.500 --> 3:16:09.420]  these protesters folks this is not a theory we've proven this time and time again the protesters
[3:16:09.420 --> 3:16:14.540]  against trump are the dumbest most brainwashed ignorant misinformed people you're ever going
[3:16:14.540 --> 3:16:20.860]  to meet in your life i'm sorry i'm not trying to be mean i'm calling a spade a spade these are the
[3:16:20.860 --> 3:16:27.100]  dumbest most brainwashed people that can't even answer a simple question okay so we're not making
[3:16:27.100 --> 3:16:31.740]  this up i'm not sitting here demonizing trump protesters because i'm a trump voter no i went
[3:16:31.740 --> 3:16:36.460]  and tried to engage with these people they are complete morons i'm sorry go ahead david
[3:16:36.460 --> 3:16:44.860]  yeah well and the rabbit hole goes even deeper than you imagine because they actually are literally
[3:16:44.860 --> 3:16:52.140]  zombies well here's the thing they they're they're zombified by the television they're zombified
[3:16:52.140 --> 3:16:56.140]  by the television they're taking fluoride their whole life it's the hearsay mafia and you know
[3:16:56.140 --> 3:17:01.340]  what the funny thing is about it so these are college students right these are the majority
[3:17:01.340 --> 3:17:05.260]  of these protesters are college students of course they don't want to go to class who wants an
[3:17:05.260 --> 3:17:09.660]  education there's no future for me anyway what's the point of going to class i'm just going to spend
[3:17:09.660 --> 3:17:12.940]  you know tens of thousands of dollars for this higher education and then i'm just going to protest
[3:17:12.940 --> 3:17:19.260]  my way through college but guess what the teachers the faculty the administrators are right in there
[3:17:19.260 --> 3:17:25.340]  with them they're leading the protests even john rapaport i used to be a teacher so i can talk
[3:17:25.340 --> 3:17:33.580]  to this specifically that's right you take three or four generations of teachers and dumb them down
[3:17:33.580 --> 3:17:38.220]  continually to the point where they can't even teach their own subject competently
[3:17:38.860 --> 3:17:45.660]  and don't want to so what are they going to do any excuse to let the kids out is going to be great
[3:17:45.660 --> 3:17:53.580]  for them yeah any ideas that they can stick into their heads or values as opposed to actually saying
[3:17:53.580 --> 3:18:00.060]  okay we have to open our books now kids here's page 132 and we're going to go over this until
[3:18:00.060 --> 3:18:06.860]  everybody understands it for a lot of teachers now that's too much they can't do it they weren't
[3:18:06.860 --> 3:18:13.820]  raised that way they weren't educated that way so much easier to say now we're going to talk about
[3:18:13.820 --> 3:18:19.500]  getting along with each other now we're going to talk about different colors and ethnicities and this
[3:18:19.500 --> 3:18:27.020]  and that and sexual orientation and all the insane values that they have no business discussing
[3:18:27.020 --> 3:18:33.020]  in public schools and they're going to do it because it's the easy way out frankly it's easier for
[3:18:33.020 --> 3:18:39.660]  them to do that and so oh there's a protest okay let's go exactly day off and i get paid and that's
[3:18:39.660 --> 3:18:44.700]  not a solution what is that a solution to what is the protest going to do folks it's done nothing
[3:18:44.700 --> 3:18:50.780]  these people have been protesting for years now black lives matter has been protesting for years
[3:18:50.780 --> 3:18:55.420]  the anti-trump protesters have been protesting for over a year what have you accomplished you've
[3:18:55.420 --> 3:19:00.300]  accomplished nothing actually i'll correct myself you did accomplish something you helped get
[3:19:00.300 --> 3:19:06.460]  donald trump elected and see they don't even realize it they're eating their own garbage
[3:19:06.460 --> 3:19:11.180]  they're sitting here they're sitting here eating their own garbage that they can't even see that
[3:19:11.180 --> 3:19:17.020]  they helped get donald trump elected because reasonable logical people saw who the anti-trump
[3:19:17.020 --> 3:19:22.220]  protesters were and then they got scared that these are the people in control of the future and they
[3:19:22.220 --> 3:19:27.660]  ran to the polls to vote for donald trump so thank you very much but it's funny you know here's a

[3:24:17.740 --> 3:24:23.260]  john raport we're going to talk about future threats um coming threats protests and again
[3:24:23.260 --> 3:24:27.900]  though i think it's worth starting every segment with this i'd like to know what alex thinks about
[3:24:27.900 --> 3:24:33.260]  this is he rejoins us and we're going to play a clip from uh rt here in a second uh talking about
[3:24:33.260 --> 3:24:39.100]  this but alex we beat the mainstream media we beat obama we beat the protesters we beat the
[3:24:39.100 --> 3:24:43.580]  pope we beat the corrupt established the communist chinese president that told us we could not have
[3:24:43.580 --> 3:24:48.300]  trump we beat the kitchen sink so it's time it's time to just let them know we beat you
[3:24:48.300 --> 3:24:54.460]  quit trying but here's rt talking about american media having to walk back the embarrassment that
[3:24:54.460 --> 3:25:05.820]  was their election coverage can it get any more awkward than this around the world the politicians
[3:25:05.820 --> 3:25:12.620]  journalists and diplomats who branded donald trump racist and right wing are having to backpedal
[3:25:12.620 --> 3:25:17.820]  british foreign secretary boris johnson is one of them back when he was mayor of london he said
[3:25:17.820 --> 3:25:23.100]  there were parts of new york he'd be afraid to go to for fear of bumping into donald trump
[3:25:23.100 --> 3:25:28.940]  now he's britain's top diplomat johnson says he's very much looking forward to working with him
[3:25:29.900 --> 3:25:35.820]  over in the republic of ireland is the defense minister who's on the defensive before trump
[3:25:35.820 --> 3:25:42.940]  became the republican nominee ender kelly branded trump racist and dangerous but now he's heading
[3:25:42.940 --> 3:25:48.060]  for the white house i listened very carefully to the president elect this morning very happy
[3:25:48.060 --> 3:25:51.900]  that the government would walk with a new administration when appointed by the president
[3:25:51.900 --> 3:25:59.020]  elect the big rigs in brosles are also shifting into reverse gear days before voters cast their
[3:25:59.020 --> 3:26:06.220]  ballots european council president donald tusk tweeted this my wife's latest comment one donald
[3:26:06.220 --> 3:26:12.300]  is more than enough by wednesday though the olive branches were out or at least invitations for
[3:26:12.300 --> 3:26:18.860]  trump to come to an e u u s summit as soon as possible nato's former secretary general too
[3:26:18.860 --> 3:26:24.300]  changed his tune once the results were in we don't know what will be the concrete policies of a
[3:26:24.300 --> 3:26:31.420]  trump administration i think they could be very dangerous for the world i congratulate donald
[3:26:31.420 --> 3:26:36.940]  trump on the election victory his administration must display global leadership and defend friends
[3:26:36.940 --> 3:26:42.460]  and allies global leadership is a hard word in diplomatic circles handed over to the globalist
[3:26:42.460 --> 3:26:47.100]  that's the global leadership but jahadi's poop in the public pool is to just wipe your social media
[3:26:47.100 --> 3:26:51.580]  timeline and then rape kids and say it's okay it's tolerance late trump on his win was british prime
[3:26:51.580 --> 3:26:58.140]  minister tereza may perhaps to make amends for her predecessor labeling trump stupid divisive
[3:26:58.140 --> 3:27:04.860]  and wrong over comments about stopping muslim's entering the u.s despite tereza may's diplomacy
[3:27:04.860 --> 3:27:08.060]  look these are people that just run around stealing money all day and wrecking economies and the
[3:27:08.060 --> 3:27:12.300]  knowledge they just go racist racist racist and hop around and that's all they've got
[3:27:12.300 --> 3:27:18.540]  to all the country where so many citizens signed a petition trying to ban trump from entering
[3:27:18.540 --> 3:27:24.460]  the parliament was forced to debate the issue and politicians but it showed the total intimidation
[3:27:24.460 --> 3:27:27.260]  they were involved in like a few final calls here after the break as people went holding we're going
[3:27:27.260 --> 3:27:32.780]  to go to uh expect more back vc and uh a few others have been holding really a long time i v and
[3:27:32.780 --> 3:27:39.420]  hunter and tere maya and uh and and jason but this is a short segment a total a total repudiation
[3:27:39.420 --> 3:27:43.580]  it shows their arrogance it shows their disconnect and it shows though i don't think they're going
[3:27:43.580 --> 3:27:48.220]  to stop i think they're going to counter strike back well and this shows the nature the shill nature
[3:27:48.220 --> 3:27:54.780]  of these politicians too they will say and do anything to just stay in office that's all they
[3:27:54.780 --> 3:27:58.220]  care about they don't care about the countries that they represent they don't care about the
[3:27:58.220 --> 3:28:01.660]  economies they claim to want to fix they don't care about the borders they don't john ravaport
[3:28:01.660 --> 3:28:05.900]  isn't it refreshing to just to know that trump isn't perfect but he is his own man and pigheaded
[3:28:05.900 --> 3:28:11.100]  i mean that's his crime he's not from this big swarm of locusts globalists that are a minority
[3:28:11.100 --> 3:28:15.660]  worldwide but from every country religion and race but have decided they rule the earth
[3:28:15.660 --> 3:28:20.540]  they're now getting a rude awakening that know you don't you snuck in with globalism corporate
[3:28:20.540 --> 3:28:25.420]  conquest now we're aware of the conquest it's illegitimate it's illegal it doesn't work it
[3:28:25.420 --> 3:28:30.700]  sucks guess what this is just the beginning you're losing on every crime go ahead and try to hold
[3:28:30.700 --> 3:28:34.540]  this hostage go ahead and blow up our economy like you threatened with bricks under this watch
[3:28:34.540 --> 3:28:39.900]  what happens will arrest your ass go ahead so what happens now when a couple of these trade
[3:28:39.900 --> 3:28:48.460]  treaties get struck down bang all of a sudden the globalist plan to increase corporate domination
[3:28:48.460 --> 3:28:55.260]  over the world instead of corporate tribunals instead of court systems and sovereign nations
[3:28:55.260 --> 3:29:03.420]  goes down the toilet now when that happens that is going to be a major blow against the empire
[3:29:03.420 --> 3:29:10.300]  that would be okay uh we said we were coming to washington to get rid of globalism here's one
[3:29:10.300 --> 3:29:22.860]  of their major major pieces and we just killed it like a fly like a nafta cat tpp tpp ttip
[3:29:23.580 --> 3:29:30.700]  kafta you know the whole world wto expose the entire and they've all engaged in racketeering
[3:29:30.700 --> 3:29:35.100]  to get these things done secret so if they don't go along with us restoring the republic and free
[3:29:35.100 --> 3:29:40.300]  and fair trade oh they'll have to be indictments against all of them and if we could if we got a
[3:29:40.300 --> 3:29:44.620]  riko investigation on this deal look out all right and remport was already pointed out he said
[3:29:44.620 --> 3:29:50.300]  absolutely they've committed crimes it's time to prosecute the white collar criminals the empires on
[3:29:50.300 --> 3:30:01.420]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network we are now two days into the historic election of
[3:30:01.420 --> 3:30:06.540]  donald trump as the next president of the united states and all those doom and gloom cries from
[3:30:06.540 --> 3:30:11.740]  the mainstream media that the markets were gonna tank and businesses were gonna go bankrupt well
[3:30:11.740 --> 3:30:15.820]  of course it's just a bunch of hot air now the drudge report linked to this bloomberg article
[3:30:15.820 --> 3:30:21.340]  us stocks rally falters near records as trump platform assessed yeah that's right they actually
[3:30:21.340 --> 3:30:25.580]  took the time to look at his plan and go wow more people are gonna have more money and we're gonna
[3:30:25.580 --> 3:30:31.020]  make more money and of course bloomberg's trying to put a hazy spin on this headline but the fact
[3:30:31.020 --> 3:30:35.100]  is the dow jones industrial average rose to an all-time high as investors speculated on the
[3:30:35.100 --> 3:30:39.500]  industries and companies that stand to benefit from donald trump's surprise election victory the
[3:30:39.500 --> 3:30:44.860]  dow rose 125 points goldman sex came out and said trumps promised to revive american infrastructure
[3:30:44.860 --> 3:30:49.980]  means commodities used to build everything from airports to bridges will benefit under his presidency
[3:30:49.980 --> 3:30:54.060]  that's right at this point if trump does what he says we can look to a new era of economic

[3:33:09.020 --> 3:33:17.020]  transmission you are the resistance from the front lines of the information war it's alex
[3:33:17.020 --> 3:33:25.260]  jones careful what you wish you might just get it and that's what was at a big state party
[3:33:25.260 --> 3:33:31.420]  in russia yesterday after trump one of your tv viewer it's two tough guy images in a russian
[3:33:31.420 --> 3:33:36.860]  painting of latimer putin and uh and donald trump is that just the humor level of this is really good
[3:33:36.860 --> 3:33:42.300]  and i think somebody put a screen with fake red square during the soviet era we've now been captured
[3:33:42.300 --> 3:33:49.020]  by russia folks now get ready for donald trump is trying to cut your taxes by what's that putin
[3:33:50.540 --> 3:33:55.340]  100 percent of you make 140 000 years when it comes out to and everybody else huge tax cuts
[3:33:55.340 --> 3:34:00.540]  which will cause more tax receipts to come in so we just keep spending the same it'll pay off
[3:34:00.540 --> 3:34:05.020]  problem was reagan let them double and triple spending it doubled tax increases again or or
[3:34:06.620 --> 3:34:11.660]  revenue but they increase spending way more the answer is leave it the same cut taxes to the people
[3:34:11.660 --> 3:34:16.620]  bring all the corporate money back and we're off the races let's take a few phone calls here
[3:34:16.620 --> 3:34:20.620]  john rapaport is riding shotgun with us we're coming from the info wars new centers in austin
[3:34:20.620 --> 3:34:27.340]  texas stupendous mega massive victories for humanity so far but the enemy is striking back
[3:34:27.340 --> 3:34:31.820]  imagine there's gonna be riots and attacks and more racial garbage all night long but most americans
[3:34:31.820 --> 3:34:36.060]  where we race color and creed see right through it uh who's been holding the longest let me see
[3:34:36.060 --> 3:34:43.260]  hear them vc in texas you're on the air oh halex it's great to talk to you man listen you're doing
[3:34:43.260 --> 3:34:51.020]  a fantastic job your crew it's unbelievable i mean i i've been a political junkie since uh 79
[3:34:51.020 --> 3:34:58.780]  when c span started up i grew up in the vietnam era and watergate so it's only natural for people
[3:34:58.780 --> 3:35:04.940]  to get caught up in their own political climates and and so i really never caught on to the republican
[3:35:04.940 --> 3:35:12.700]  party very much and uh but i i very much uh supported uh uh ross perot thought he was great
[3:35:12.700 --> 3:35:18.620]  that was a great hope boy i wish we had listened to him but didn't didn't al gore turn out to be a
[3:35:18.620 --> 3:35:26.380]  complete liar you know and see i supported gore when he came up in his thing because i didn't
[3:35:26.380 --> 3:35:31.500]  like bush i thought there's too much military industrial complex and you know i wish i could
[3:35:31.500 --> 3:35:37.020]  be a citizen caller that can call it and talk to you for an hour's air time because there's so much
[3:35:37.020 --> 3:35:44.540]  filled up inside me then you've got me amped up on this political process here and you know i could
[3:35:44.540 --> 3:35:51.180]  go over it all i mean i supported obama in 2008 and what a disastrous mistake that was but i grew
[3:35:51.180 --> 3:35:57.660]  up here in austin i i went to aderson the same high school you did i grew up in that area west
[3:35:57.660 --> 3:36:03.420]  wait a minute i went to school in russia yeah you were classmates with putin weren't you
[3:36:04.060 --> 3:36:11.020]  actually i'm glad we're putin son yeah i can see the resemblance alex i'm sorry go ahead sir
[3:36:12.700 --> 3:36:19.180]  i was in there probably uh before uh well well before you were but you uh probably had buford
[3:36:19.180 --> 3:36:25.020]  as your principal but anyway let me let me go on to the thing is is that a trump i'm just very very
[3:36:25.020 --> 3:36:31.100]  concerned that he's going to be co-opted i mean he's an instigator you know he is the rebel within
[3:36:31.100 --> 3:36:36.780]  the republican party i loved a lot of ron paul's ideas and things like that they're going to try
[3:36:36.780 --> 3:36:42.540]  to co-opt him and i and i think it's great that he supposedly has been listening to you for all
[3:36:42.540 --> 3:36:47.900]  these years but you look at already some of his advisors and stuff who surround him no no i hear
[3:36:47.900 --> 3:36:52.300]  you there are some issues with people like uh new gandridge but but but but and and let's go to that
[3:36:52.300 --> 3:36:58.780]  with uh john rapaport let me explain something some of trump's kids have listened trump knows i
[3:36:58.780 --> 3:37:03.580]  i've talked to trump some our movement when he goes to events and a third of the people
[3:37:03.580 --> 3:37:07.500]  are wearing hillard for prison shirts and our listeners are there he's picking up on all that
[3:37:07.500 --> 3:37:12.540]  and it's meshing with his populism so let's get it clear donald trump is not some alex jones but
[3:37:13.340 --> 3:37:18.380]  the american people are rediscovering americana i didn't write up this this whole cosmology
[3:37:18.380 --> 3:37:21.340]  we're covering things that are factual and already there but that's a good point
[3:37:21.340 --> 3:37:28.460]  how do we keep trump honest john rapaport first time we see it out of the box that somebody really
[3:37:29.260 --> 3:37:38.860]  bad gets appointed outrage uproar wrong move this is an insider this is somebody who's just a hold
[3:37:38.860 --> 3:37:45.500]  over from bush this is a neocon you don't need this guy you don't want this guy who told you
[3:37:45.500 --> 3:37:51.900]  to appoint this guy let's run it down i make the distinction between two things with presidential
[3:37:51.900 --> 3:37:58.780]  appointees yeah you need people who know how the game is played in washington the details and
[3:37:58.780 --> 3:38:04.140]  the ins and the outs of the official game and the unofficial game sure it's a big city with a
[3:38:04.140 --> 3:38:13.100]  mega complex bureaucracy but those people should just be there to give you technical data and advice
[3:38:13.100 --> 3:38:18.860]  on procedure right point they should this is this is excellent they shouldn't be running anything
[3:38:18.860 --> 3:38:23.740]  they just have the boyfriend you never put him in charge of anything they're just there
[3:38:24.460 --> 3:38:29.340]  in a kind of a robotic way okay joe so what's happening right here no okay well this is what's
[3:38:29.340 --> 3:38:34.300]  happening and he's here and that's you know okay thank you joe go back to your cubby home now now
[3:38:34.300 --> 3:38:39.980]  we decide what we're going to do joe never becomes the department chairman gatekeeper
[3:38:39.980 --> 3:38:47.020]  exactly so that's what we have to watch out for and to me this is one of the callers absolutely
[3:38:47.020 --> 3:38:55.820]  right this is the key if he's going to surround himself with the same old tired people there's
[3:38:55.820 --> 3:39:02.220]  going to be major trouble major trouble this cannot happen and we have to watch it i agree the good
[3:39:02.220 --> 3:39:07.180]  news is the few people he has gotten from the establishment he's used as like a tour guide
[3:39:07.180 --> 3:39:11.820]  until he figures this out i mean that was my old joke about he's got to go into a goblins nest he
[3:39:11.820 --> 3:39:17.420]  needs a guide to take him into the goblins nest and if he uses people just as guides that's fine
[3:39:17.420 --> 3:39:25.820]  but if we uh you know catching kissing goblins if we catching in bed with a goblin you know that
[3:39:25.820 --> 3:39:30.300]  is not going to be a good thing but to be serious they turn that into this huge you know vine huge
[3:39:30.300 --> 3:39:37.660]  viral deal with 20 million views or something that particular joke editing it together but he really
[3:39:37.660 --> 3:39:41.980]  got there by being outside the box he changed the whole system he recognized that time of
[3:39:41.980 --> 3:39:47.340]  change has come he recognized a rotting empty media i mean he really did show incredible
[3:39:48.220 --> 3:39:54.380]  instincts in what he's done and and being able to gauge and tune in to the ether john yeah no
[3:39:54.380 --> 3:40:00.780]  question about it and as i keep saying he ran his campaign against the media that was the smartest
[3:40:00.780 --> 3:40:04.620]  thing he did right from the get go because he never could have gotten his message across
[3:40:05.260 --> 3:40:09.980]  if he had played ball with the media and on exactly and he won't get the agenda through now
[3:40:09.980 --> 3:40:14.380]  playing ball and the one thing i don't like i bitched about it as he said it live he's like oh
[3:40:14.380 --> 3:40:18.140]  thank you hillary really all owe you a great debt that's the first time i've heard him lie in the
[3:40:18.140 --> 3:40:22.540]  campaign i get being gracious wanting to have a stock market crash and wanting to be like the big guy
[3:40:22.540 --> 3:40:27.660]  they still kept attacking within minutes like piranha um i would have just said well we're the
[3:40:27.660 --> 3:40:32.060]  winner too bad we haven't seen a public concession justice will be done we're going to move forward
[3:40:32.060 --> 3:40:35.580]  i'm a president for all americans you've heard a bunch of lies from the media now you're going
[3:40:35.580 --> 3:40:40.380]  to be able to hear me with daily briefings to you about what's really happening uh and we're
[3:40:40.380 --> 3:40:44.220]  going to restore this country but we've been infiltrated by a lot of foreign multinational
[3:40:44.220 --> 3:40:49.340]  interest so i have to let you know that our the work has just begun we've only gotten a beachhead
[3:40:49.340 --> 3:40:53.020]  now in the retaking of america want to thank you all for everything you've done in your support
[3:40:53.020 --> 3:40:58.780]  this is the return of 1776 god bless you all exactly and when you talk about daily briefings
[3:40:59.660 --> 3:41:08.620]  that's it that's it right there because he's up against uh a tsunami so daily briefings mean
[3:41:08.620 --> 3:41:14.060]  to me and this should be a clue to him okay folks this is what happened today
[3:41:14.060 --> 3:41:19.900]  i want to tell you straight out these are the people i met with this is where we met this was
[3:41:19.900 --> 3:41:25.820]  on the agenda this is what i told them that i want and this is what they came back at me with
[3:41:25.820 --> 3:41:30.380]  these are the people that are blocking why you put me here i think you just ought to have all the
[3:41:30.380 --> 3:41:35.420]  summits live and and and all his major meetings just be would be revolutionary on c-span i think
[3:41:35.420 --> 3:41:39.260]  that's actually a great idea and that would get more people to be tuned into what the government's
[3:41:39.260 --> 3:41:43.660]  doing and to the caller's point i don't know if you saw the story trump makes first white
[3:41:43.660 --> 3:41:47.260]  house visit as president elect trump actually visited the white house yeah let's show some of
[3:41:47.260 --> 3:41:51.260]  that video it's him pulling up earlier today we google it and this is what obama said i believe
[3:41:51.260 --> 3:41:55.180]  that this is important for all of us regardless of party political preferences to come together
[3:41:55.180 --> 3:41:59.580]  work together and deal with many challenges we face i want to emphasize to you mr president elect
[3:41:59.580 --> 3:42:03.820]  that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed
[3:42:03.820 --> 3:42:07.100]  the country succeeds but i'm just curious where the protesters why aren't they're listening to
[3:42:07.100 --> 3:42:12.540]  obama on that and uh getting out they're following the 500 bucks a day they get from 12 sorrows look
[3:42:12.540 --> 3:42:16.700]  dude was down there like that they had hundreds of buses hundreds buses were blocking roads
[3:42:16.700 --> 3:42:21.980]  bringing him into ryan well and they're already planning on protesting on january 20th we've
[3:42:21.980 --> 3:42:26.140]  got facebook groups being made i've got some flyers we can we can cover that later but then
[3:42:26.140 --> 3:42:30.140]  trump said we discussed in in his conversation with obama i can only imagine after the things
[3:42:30.140 --> 3:42:34.860]  that obama and trump have said about each other during this campaign how how that conversation
[3:42:34.860 --> 3:42:39.500]  went out of the cameras we discussed a lot of different situations some wonderful and some
[3:42:39.500 --> 3:42:43.260]  difficulties i'm very much looking forward to dealing with the president in the future including
[3:42:43.260 --> 3:42:47.180]  counsel mr president it was a great honor meeting with you and i look forward to meeting with you
[3:42:47.180 --> 3:42:50.700]  many many more times in the future so perhaps this is the first time maybe we look at trump and say
[3:42:50.700 --> 3:42:56.860]  hey why are you cozying up to obama but again you know with this with the things that trump is saying
[3:42:56.860 --> 3:43:00.460]  i'm just saying something right now i don't like obama but his body language is better
[3:43:00.460 --> 3:43:04.220]  with trump than it is around hillary he does not like hillary well hillary is just i mean
[3:43:04.940 --> 3:43:08.540]  i couldn't even imagine what my body language would be like around hillary honestly i i don't
[3:43:08.540 --> 3:43:14.300]  know i don't want to know but remember it was obama and it was hillary who were sitting here
[3:43:14.300 --> 3:43:19.180]  reminding trump pointing the finger at trump you need to make sure the transition of power is peaceful
[3:43:19.180 --> 3:43:23.100]  this is a tradition in this country transition to power peaceful but then what do we see from
[3:43:23.100 --> 3:43:29.500]  the obama and hillary supporters violent protests in the street burning flags and nothing from obama
[3:43:29.500 --> 3:43:33.420]  nothing from hillary i guess this is the first time obama's basically said hey let's work together
[3:43:33.420 --> 3:43:37.100]  let's come together no no i agree that was signal that they were backing off but the fact we don't
[3:43:37.100 --> 3:43:41.260]  hear any repudiation of this and i mean give me a break man if you're going to wave flags wave
[3:43:41.260 --> 3:43:45.900]  something like the swiss flag that's successful or or or something else or christian boy they're
[3:43:45.900 --> 3:43:51.180]  like commie flags commie just came to produce automobiles they're waving mexican flag saying
[3:43:51.180 --> 3:43:56.380]  donald trump is not my president well duh he's the president of the united states not mexico
[3:43:56.380 --> 3:44:01.100]  what these people have no logic there's no train of thought well it's all the liberation theology
[3:44:01.100 --> 3:44:04.540]  cramp they've been taught and i mean this is absolutely the us pissed on mexico and back and
[3:44:04.540 --> 3:44:10.620]  forth there were fricking six flags over texas like eight flags over over uh california the russians
[3:44:10.620 --> 3:44:16.460]  used to have california i mean it is a damn war over here nobody could take this from the comanches
[3:44:16.460 --> 3:44:21.180]  that's why it was the texas finally did and then they say oh we killed all the comanches no everybody
[3:44:21.180 --> 3:44:25.340]  just got basically intermarried i mean it's just the realities have all been totally distorted i want
[3:44:25.340 --> 3:44:29.740]  to hit a few calls here doing a great job today everybody genre out for other future threats you
[3:44:29.740 --> 3:44:32.380]  see we've covered them here i mean we're we're hitting a lot of them here i'm worried about
[3:44:32.380 --> 3:44:37.580]  assassination of trump i i know he's for real i mean he's perfect but he's for real he's not
[3:44:37.580 --> 3:44:42.460]  under global's control he's not a satanist he's not to get people he wants prosperity he's a
[3:44:42.460 --> 3:44:46.620]  little bit authoritarian a little bit classic alpha male strong man that's why he and pootie
[3:44:46.620 --> 3:44:50.300]  poot like each other i don't want to be under a pootie poot strong man and i get pootie poot
[3:44:50.300 --> 3:44:54.540]  had to be strong to get the globalist out but you know whatever uh i'm i'm really concerned
[3:44:54.540 --> 3:45:01.180]  though they're gonna try to kill trump uh sure it's possible no question about it i mean it's a time
[3:45:01.180 --> 3:45:06.380]  monitored tradition somebody goes up against the established power you get rid of them so
[3:45:07.020 --> 3:45:11.420]  that's always a concern absolutely but can't the established power look at the tea leaves and say
[3:45:11.420 --> 3:45:14.380]  we don't want to be dumb like hitler in the bunker we want to give up long before that
[3:45:15.260 --> 3:45:21.420]  everything we do we're losing brexit russia here catalonia on and on on uh uh uh island
[3:45:22.140 --> 3:45:26.140]  we've got to start pulling back because even the global system their publications admit
[3:45:26.140 --> 3:45:29.340]  that aren't even public i mean you can get them but they're not distributed widely
[3:45:29.340 --> 3:45:33.100]  we really did screw everybody globalism really didn't make everybody poor but us
[3:45:33.100 --> 3:45:38.140]  our money won't be worth anything most places if society collapses we might want to actually uh
[3:45:38.140 --> 3:45:42.940]  back off this so so there's even discussions of like stiglas the former head of the world bank
[3:45:42.940 --> 3:45:49.020]  for 15 years he's been saying we got to stop this yeah there is some discussion of it but
[3:45:49.020 --> 3:45:54.300]  they're not going to back off at the highest levels of globalism because they just they built
[3:45:54.300 --> 3:45:59.180]  a structure to rule the world i mean the structure is already there they're not going to just
[3:45:59.180 --> 3:46:04.060]  say okay guys let's tear it down because uh you know we're causing too much trouble
[3:46:04.060 --> 3:46:09.020]  they are causing too much trouble and one of the things that's going to be happening quite
[3:46:09.020 --> 3:46:15.260]  soon if not already is that ceo's of major corporations are going to be going to the
[3:46:15.260 --> 3:46:20.300]  big Rockefeller globalists and saying hey guess what our consumer base is shrinking around the
[3:46:20.300 --> 3:46:26.060]  world you said that if we played your game that we could be selling more products to everybody
[3:46:26.060 --> 3:46:31.900]  and it's not working out so what's going on here there are divisions within globalism no
[3:46:31.900 --> 3:46:37.900]  question about it my main concern is with the intricacies of the washington power structure
[3:46:37.900 --> 3:46:43.740]  and what happens when trump gets into that and tries to solve that and work through it
[3:46:43.740 --> 3:46:48.220]  to push through basic i mean he's going to have to be nice to the ones that are nice
[3:46:48.220 --> 3:46:52.620]  mean to the ones that are in calcitrant follow the constitution go to the public with a bully
[3:46:52.620 --> 3:46:58.300]  pulpit and he has to run over everyone that threatens him or tries to play kingpin he has
[3:46:58.300 --> 3:47:03.820]  to run these bastards over and then when one of them plays a game or does a dirty trick oh guess
[3:47:03.820 --> 3:47:08.700]  what you committed all these crimes previously you've been indicted and this isn't my call for
[3:47:08.700 --> 3:47:13.740]  authoritarianism this is a foreign authoritarian group okay so they're lucky we're not like the
[3:47:13.740 --> 3:47:18.220]  french with de Gaulle kicking you know nato out and trying to control france they're like we don't
[3:47:18.220 --> 3:47:22.300]  have paired troopers running up arresting all the ceo's right now okay and i'm not calling for that
[3:47:22.300 --> 3:47:26.700]  but they're the ones that occupy us so if they don't back off the gloves come off the john
[3:47:27.980 --> 3:47:37.020]  yeah sure uh let's go i'm ready for that anytime the thing is what trump is saying and what the
[3:47:37.020 --> 3:47:43.740]  people behind him want him to do are very simple things these are not uh you know rocket science
[3:47:43.740 --> 3:47:49.420]  type things so you know i know and here's the deal we're done calling bluffs and everybody's
[3:47:49.420 --> 3:47:54.460]  going to say in washington you know mr president you don't really understand how things run here
[3:47:54.460 --> 3:47:59.660]  i mean what you're trying to do is to light a fire in a in a structure that's you know five
[3:47:59.660 --> 3:48:03.980]  million stories high and you've got to go up to this floor and that floor and do this and do that
[3:48:03.980 --> 3:48:09.260]  and whatever whatever and he's got to keep his head straight and the lie is it isn't really a
[3:48:09.260 --> 3:48:15.180]  structure it's a big fraud built out of endless money in our blood sweat tears we need it we
[3:48:15.180 --> 3:48:20.780]  need to demolition a lot of this stuff anyways exactly exactly i mean i'd love to see him eliminate
[3:48:20.780 --> 3:48:26.860]  two or three cabinet posts and just i agree the first thing you should do is go in and reorganize
[3:48:26.860 --> 3:48:31.980]  all those things put the agencies together lay lay them off man americans have been dc's the
[3:48:31.980 --> 3:48:36.940]  richest city in the world they get fatter all the time we're hurting so until we start getting some
[3:48:36.940 --> 3:48:41.420]  wealth and until our companies get built and our industry and our kids and until we don't have the
[3:48:41.420 --> 3:48:46.460]  highest infer mortality in the freaking industrialized world you're out on your asses well and let's be
[3:48:46.460 --> 3:48:51.020]  clear too because i can already see this happening if donald trump gets in and starts to drain the
[3:48:51.020 --> 3:48:56.860]  swamp like he talks about this is not authoritarianism this is not a dictator this is a guy who's
[3:48:56.860 --> 3:49:01.660]  getting rid of the corrupt establishment he's got a mandate from the people who are who are in tens
[3:49:01.660 --> 3:49:06.620]  of thousands of emails hundreds of thousands bragging about how we're dumbasses and how they're
[3:49:06.620 --> 3:49:12.460]  robbing us and giggling and laughing okay so i want to see indictments i want to see these people
[3:49:12.460 --> 3:49:17.340]  in prison and it will be shocking for the people who have been above the law in this country for
[3:49:17.340 --> 3:49:21.820]  decades to finally face justice of course it'll be shocking and i can already see what the mainstream
[3:49:21.820 --> 3:49:28.220]  media will say he's a dictator he's an authoritarian he's going power crazy so we we need to be ahead
[3:49:28.220 --> 3:49:32.380]  of the curve on that but i mean here's a problem if he does just go in and try to play patty cake
[3:49:32.380 --> 3:49:37.020]  and try to get a few things done and let them all act like they're his friends now he'll just drift
[3:49:37.020 --> 3:49:42.860]  off we won't get half of what we need and then we're done he he really wants to be on this crusade
[3:49:42.860 --> 3:49:49.100]  he has these are globalist foreign operatives we can absolutely they've all committed major
[3:49:49.100 --> 3:49:54.620]  crimes and it's time to prosecute them and i'm serious they either get out of the way and let
[3:49:54.620 --> 3:50:00.380]  us fix this country or it's prison do you want george soros has been inciting violence around
[3:50:00.380 --> 3:50:03.660]  the world for years get this man should be in jail i mean i mean here's the deal that's why
[3:50:03.660 --> 3:50:08.060]  at the top alex when you and i started talking that's what we're talking about the prosecutions
[3:50:08.060 --> 3:50:15.100]  have to go forward they can't stop now this has to be part of the whole pattern here you can't
[3:50:15.100 --> 3:50:19.180]  just say well and now we're going to have peace with everybody and everybody's because they said
[3:50:19.180 --> 3:50:22.540]  next year they were going to shut down our free speech they've been calling for my arrest yeah
[3:50:22.540 --> 3:50:27.500]  you can't slow down now sorry john you have to prosecute these people you have to arrest them
[3:50:27.500 --> 3:50:31.260]  you have to put them in jail you have to take them to court you have to show the evidence
[3:50:31.260 --> 3:50:38.860]  and say okay massive numbers we're talking about here you're out you're prosecuted you're out
[3:50:38.860 --> 3:50:43.900]  you're prosecuted i mean that's what draining the swamp means if that's what he really
[3:50:43.900 --> 3:50:50.140]  intends to do and for the people that say oh this is it sounds like the soviet system no no no no
[3:50:50.140 --> 3:50:55.420]  no by the way we all set up as an oppression to begin with the whole bureaucratic system
[3:50:55.420 --> 3:51:01.020]  is criminal to begin with that's right and if we just get say ten of the kingpins pressed all this
[3:51:01.020 --> 3:51:05.980]  time if we just indict say ten of the kingpins we know are criminals hillary you name it all their
[3:51:05.980 --> 3:51:11.180]  minions will flip on them instantly we'll get the entire rolodex of crime you think one guy's email
[3:51:11.180 --> 3:51:17.340]  rock them down mike let's one little window folks we'll get the whole stinking mess we'll roll up
[3:51:17.340 --> 3:51:22.540]  all of them the pedophile rings the devil worshipers man there's going to be oh these guys are in
[3:51:22.540 --> 3:51:30.380]  trouble here look at this go to the fda find three people that are willing to roll over because you
[3:51:30.380 --> 3:51:34.940]  you've got evidence on and say we want to know everything criminal it's been going on at the
[3:51:34.940 --> 3:51:41.740]  fda with approving drugs that kill people collusion with monsanto lying etc etc etc right
[3:51:41.740 --> 3:51:47.660]  that's what we want now you can either go to jail for a year or you can go to jail for 30 years
[3:51:47.660 --> 3:51:53.260]  so what are you going to do and all of a sudden like you say everybody comes out of the woodwork
[3:51:53.260 --> 3:51:59.420]  confessions everywhere everybody rolls over on everybody else this is how deep the corruption
[3:51:59.420 --> 3:52:07.660]  runs at all these agencies so if you're going to move ahead move ahead don't stop don't pretend
[3:52:07.660 --> 3:52:12.220]  it's all well and good because it's not and here's the reason we have to move ahead they've built a
[3:52:12.220 --> 3:52:17.260]  corrupt system anathletically american system and they want to shut us down when we're not
[3:52:17.260 --> 3:52:21.660]  corrupt and are doing nothing wrong so it's survival they deserve it they're evil we've
[3:52:21.660 --> 3:52:26.380]  caught them they're corrupt people risk their lives and died to bring us the wiki links and
[3:52:27.740 --> 3:52:32.220]  listen by up here leading a movement to have them arrested you know hillary for president 2016
[3:52:32.220 --> 3:52:36.300]  i'm not going to just give up now that we've had this level of victory because it means nothing if
[3:52:36.300 --> 3:52:40.380]  we win this victory and then lose down the road we have to press we have to do the right thing i
[3:52:40.380 --> 3:52:44.860]  still want hillary in jail just because she didn't win the white house doesn't mean i don't want her
[3:52:44.860 --> 3:52:51.180]  in jail of course of course this is part of the deal like alex said look they built this system
[3:52:51.820 --> 3:52:57.340]  which is as he said antithetical to the original meaning of the constitution in the country that's
[3:52:57.340 --> 3:53:01.980]  what they did they said look we don't care about severely limited central government i mean who
[3:53:01.980 --> 3:53:07.180]  cares about that we want to rule the system and the only way to do that is to keep making it bigger
[3:53:07.180 --> 3:53:10.140]  and bigger here's where i'd start here's where i'd start we should have we should have a mock trial
[3:53:10.140 --> 3:53:15.020]  have everybody come to town and do this we should start with the iris open and shut persecuting christians
[3:53:15.020 --> 3:53:18.700]  conservatives libertarians put people in jail even the newark times admit this whole hispanic
[3:53:18.700 --> 3:53:25.340]  american lady who had like a six-top counter and two tables for 50-something years her her gross every
[3:53:25.340 --> 3:53:30.860]  day was like 400 500 she made a couple hundred dollars you know a week she lived in a tiny house
[3:53:30.860 --> 3:53:37.180]  she deposited all her money in the bank every day religiously her life savings was 37 thousand dollars
[3:53:37.180 --> 3:53:41.500]  and the iris said we know you're innocent we know there's no drugs it's all kind of for but under
[3:53:41.500 --> 3:53:46.060]  our regulations it's structuring and they took all her money and then we're getting ready to
[3:53:46.060 --> 3:53:52.380]  prosecute her when congress had an investigation and dropped it and congress found 50 000 cases
[3:53:52.380 --> 3:53:57.900]  in the previous year and this is the new york times of other people totally i mean dude they
[3:53:57.900 --> 3:54:05.740]  are sending iris out to rob 79 year old hispanic grandmas of their life savings i mean it's just
[3:54:05.740 --> 3:54:13.260]  like oh start there iris commissioner you're going to freaking prison you witch exactly move over to
[3:54:13.260 --> 3:54:21.100]  the cdc move over to the fda terrific terrific all the internal cdc documents where they admit that
[3:54:21.100 --> 3:54:26.620]  they're causing autism and hurting people of course bring freedom back bring choice back
[3:54:27.260 --> 3:54:32.620]  liberate people this is what would happen if you did this we'd have a renaissance we'd be rolling
[3:54:32.620 --> 3:54:38.780]  in wealth and people would walk down the street they wouldn't even know why they feel better
[3:54:39.340 --> 3:54:44.540]  but they would that's how history actually works that's a great point we say the renaissance once
[3:54:44.540 --> 3:54:49.500]  it cranked up and it was like hysteria just and just took more development 20 years and last hundred
[3:54:49.500 --> 3:54:55.260]  and just books everywhere and designs and ships and cathedrals and dresses and and plays and and
[3:54:55.260 --> 3:55:00.460]  medicines and inventions and clocks being and just running around just frothing that's the saddest
[3:55:00.460 --> 3:55:05.820]  part about this is the protesters the people that hate donald trump they they're completely missing
[3:55:05.820 --> 3:55:09.660]  out on this history they don't really know what's going on they're being used like pawns in a game
[3:55:09.660 --> 3:55:14.780]  of chess and they got smartphones in their hands the product of technology bitching they're in the
[3:55:14.780 --> 3:55:19.900]  west it's like a freaking space station compared to every communist hellhole but it's like if you
[3:55:19.900 --> 3:55:25.900]  call like wandering out bitching in these civilization oh god it's so hard uh trumps a misogynist
[3:55:25.900 --> 3:55:31.020]  really because kelly and conway his campaign manager just became the first woman to successfully
[3:55:31.020 --> 3:55:36.780]  manage a campaign to victory how's that for misogyny who bought them tv's bitch tell me that
[3:55:37.980 --> 3:55:42.300]  but but but here's the thing they're completely missing it they're going to continue to protest
[3:55:42.300 --> 3:55:45.820]  they're going to have these huge protests january 20th on the inauguration day so alex i don't know
[3:55:45.820 --> 3:55:49.980]  if you actually heard this here's my idea this is what we should do if you want to steal this idea
[3:55:49.980 --> 3:55:53.740]  for me that's perfectly fine because protests are breaking out all over the united states right now
[3:55:53.740 --> 3:55:57.100]  mainly on the west coast happening in new york chicago here's what we're going to do to these
