[01:00.000 --> 01:06.640]  you emotional incontinence you had urinary incontinence no I said emotional
[01:06.640 --> 01:13.320]  incontinence sorry as Western civilization collapses which it is so
[01:13.320 --> 01:17.720]  does our ability to deal with minor day-to-day struggles without breaking
[01:17.720 --> 01:22.680]  down and wallowing in a pitiful puddle of our own self-indulgent fragility we're
[01:22.680 --> 01:27.640]  indoctrinated with emotional incontinence by television America has been
[01:27.640 --> 01:32.360]  collectively turned into Kim Kardashian's cry face I've just been like so
[01:32.360 --> 01:37.960]  unhappy you don't think I feel bad the masses overdose on reality TV thinking
[01:37.960 --> 01:42.800]  that it's actually reality and then mimic it in their own lives the more
[01:42.800 --> 01:48.160]  insipid sentimentality displayed on TV the more it manifests itself in the
[01:48.160 --> 01:53.600]  here and now vacuous people live their lives vicariously through celebrities
[01:53.600 --> 01:59.200]  and television then base their own personalities on that reality TV doesn't
[01:59.200 --> 02:05.480]  reflect reality it contrives reality it relentlessly broadcasts the message the
[02:05.480 --> 02:15.080]  ostentatious OTT often dumb displays of emotion are to be imitated people
[02:15.080 --> 02:19.320]  breaking down and sobbing because Gordon Ramsay had his team renovate their
[02:19.320 --> 02:27.120]  restaurant a stunning fresh coat of paint we've updated the upholstery new
[02:27.120 --> 02:35.680]  plates no you're not supposed to cry over a paint job and some new furniture
[02:35.680 --> 02:41.160]  the same is true of YouTube youtubers are rewarded for emotional incontinence
[02:41.160 --> 02:47.880]  and oversharing the try not to cry challenge constantly trying a whining
[02:47.880 --> 02:52.680]  about their drama and their breakups the viewers lap it up like water in the
[02:52.680 --> 02:58.480]  desert then ape their behavior always everyone cries as a baby last year
[02:58.480 --> 03:03.240]  Twitter users revealed what made them cry the answers included people who
[03:03.240 --> 03:07.600]  cried at not being able to fit all the things they wanted to in their bag
[03:07.600 --> 03:12.760]  getting the wrong source with chicken McNuggets and crying at a picture of a
[03:12.760 --> 03:19.120]  man because he looked like he was nice the floodgates of emotional incontinence
[03:19.120 --> 03:24.040]  they're also flung open whenever a celebrity dies why do people whimper
[03:24.040 --> 03:28.920]  and sob over dead celebrities they never knew and in many cases rarely even
[03:28.920 --> 03:33.560]  thought about until they died does this betray another form of weakness our
[03:33.560 --> 03:39.480]  inability to process the concept of death itself or mass public outpourings of
[03:39.480 --> 03:44.360]  grief and canonization of dead celebrities a sign that humanity has
[03:44.360 --> 03:50.280]  never been more afraid of its own mortality a sign that excessive emoting
[03:50.280 --> 03:56.200]  is making us both more insecure and more insincere as Theodore Dalrymple wrote
[03:56.200 --> 04:00.840]  we live in an age of emotional incontinence when they who emote the
[04:00.840 --> 04:06.800]  most are believed to feel the most as we become increasingly atomized by the
[04:06.800 --> 04:11.680]  breakdown of the family structure and its replacement by this empty late-stage
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.800]  capitalist corporate monoculture authentic expressions of private love
[04:16.800 --> 04:22.120]  have been replaced by spurious public displays of counterfeit emotion why are
[04:22.120 --> 04:26.800]  we constantly told that there's a stigma around depression that there's a
[04:26.800 --> 04:32.680]  stigma around expressing emotion there isn't the opposite is true it's
[04:32.680 --> 04:37.360]  constantly drilled into us that depression is normal and the emotional
[04:37.360 --> 04:46.520]  incontinence and oversharing is to be encouraged you can barely go the age the
[04:46.520 --> 04:52.200]  age ladies and gentlemen of psychological incontinence is up on info wars
[04:52.200 --> 04:56.160]  calm the full video from Paul Watson we'll be back with the most censored
[04:56.160 --> 05:02.160]  broadcast in the Western Hemisphere we knew it was coming the whole thing was
[05:02.160 --> 05:07.640]  for me like first demonize info wars lie about us build a straw man then sue us
[05:07.640 --> 05:12.040]  to add credibility to that then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook
[05:12.040 --> 05:17.080]  with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia and then wallah
[05:17.080 --> 05:21.960]  two weeks later ban info wars completely off of the dozens of major

[06:01.600 --> 06:28.440]  it's Friday August 17th 2018 there's only 81 days left until most important
[06:28.440 --> 06:34.000]  elections in the US history we are the tip of the spear attempting to alert the
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.680]  American people in the world to the threat of globalism and the all-out
[06:37.680 --> 06:43.120]  assault on Western civilization and America whatever you do realize the
[06:43.120 --> 06:47.800]  globalists have made a miscalculation and are committed to shut down this
[06:47.800 --> 06:52.000]  transmission with every form of assault you can imagine because they believe
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.720]  you're stupid and won't notice what's happening that they can bring in their
[06:55.720 --> 07:00.360]  draconian Chinese communist style censorship and America but we are here
[07:00.360 --> 07:04.840]  exposing it they are scared of this information because it is the answer to
[07:04.840 --> 07:08.600]  their corruption again thank you so much for joining us on this Friday global
[07:08.600 --> 07:15.720]  broadcast let me tell you what's coming up today and then I'll get into all of it
[07:15.720 --> 07:23.160]  the left as I've told you for 20 plus years is brainwashed to hate America and
[07:23.160 --> 07:27.780]  is trained by the high schools the colleges the mainline churches the
[07:27.780 --> 07:33.840]  culture that America is the ultimate evil in the world because the globalist
[07:33.840 --> 07:38.600]  want a one-world planetary government that controls America and other Western
[07:38.600 --> 07:46.480]  nations to enforce their planetary plan of absolute and complete domination now
[07:46.480 --> 07:51.480]  that's known now they tried to deny that any of that existed for decade after
[07:51.480 --> 07:55.440]  decade after decade while they built their world government but once they
[07:55.440 --> 07:59.200]  had to emerge the world government once they had to take it out of the shipyards
[07:59.200 --> 08:03.320]  and actually put it into the ocean the world can now see the dreadnought the
[08:03.320 --> 08:08.480]  corrupt battleship of tyranny the the aircraft carrier of lies that is the
[08:08.480 --> 08:12.760]  one-world government planetary program so all over the world it's in big trouble
[08:12.760 --> 08:17.880]  because it's authoritarian it's above the law it is tax exempt it is
[08:17.880 --> 08:24.740]  diplomatically immune it is totally maniacal and anti-human and as the
[08:24.740 --> 08:27.760]  public begins to learn about that and learn that it's anti-prosperity and
[08:27.760 --> 08:33.320]  anti-human there's going to be a giant resistance that forms they have decided
[08:33.320 --> 08:37.240]  to take me building up as this monster and then use me as the first domino to
[08:37.240 --> 08:41.960]  fall to eradicate free speech in the West that is all confirmed now law firms
[08:41.960 --> 08:44.680]  in DC have gone and looked at the statements by Democrats in Congress
[08:44.680 --> 08:49.360]  their own secret reports that have concurred that by next year they plan to
[08:49.360 --> 08:54.040]  basically end the First Amendment in America it's our job to raise the alarm
[08:54.040 --> 08:58.840]  bell that either doing that and that be it's got to be stopped so the first thing
[08:58.840 --> 09:02.120]  I'm going to cover when we come back in the next segment it'll be the second
[09:02.120 --> 09:06.720]  thing I cover I'm about to cover one big topic now that ties into this is the
[09:06.720 --> 09:10.600]  fact that the Republicans don't understand what's happening they've been
[09:10.600 --> 09:15.400]  manipulated I'm not calling for government regulation of the Internet I'm
[09:15.400 --> 09:18.960]  not calling for regulation of these corporations but it's already happened
[09:18.960 --> 09:25.680]  by fiat via the EU and its fines and regulations via these companies wanting
[09:25.680 --> 09:29.740]  to move to China they're going under China's regulatory auspices and they're
[09:29.740 --> 09:35.200]  unifying without asking anybody an unofficial global corporate charter of
[09:35.200 --> 09:39.680]  censorship and control and then the Republicans sit back like a bunch of
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.000]  fools and go well we're not going to get involved in what companies do they're
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.720]  private companies you can't operate as a utility and then have rules that you
[09:49.720 --> 09:54.240]  only selectively enforce on nationalist capitalist middle-class patriots
[09:54.240 --> 09:58.600]  pro-military pro-second amendment people and we all know that's what's going on
[09:58.600 --> 10:02.760]  so this is false advertising it's racketeering it's monopoly practices
[10:02.760 --> 10:08.120]  when you have the top six companies all in the same day ban info wars and then
[10:08.120 --> 10:16.040]  20 other companies plus follow suit that is called a monopoly combine the very
[10:16.040 --> 10:20.120]  worst monopoly system where a group of monopolies work in concert it's called
[10:20.120 --> 10:26.600]  a car kill and so we're going to get the message out and we've been put this
[10:26.600 --> 10:29.720]  message out of the White House to Congress and it's one big reason we've
[10:29.720 --> 10:35.280]  been banned but I'm willing to do it I'm not going to play along with the
[10:35.280 --> 10:41.560]  systems I'm not me there it is Apple banned Alex Jones and then the Domino's
[10:41.560 --> 10:48.240]  started to fall I didn't even know they actually written an article using that
[10:48.240 --> 10:51.360]  term but that's exactly what I've been calling it it's the domino effect and
[10:51.360 --> 10:56.600]  then they go oh hip hip hooray take Alex Jones down a lot of conservatives go
[10:56.600 --> 10:59.640]  well they've built a strong man about him they've demonized him I'm not going
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.360]  to really defend him and then you're next and of course it's now it's now
[11:04.360 --> 11:09.080]  happen so this is extremely draconian these big companies together represent
[11:09.080 --> 11:13.000]  over 90% of the internet and so now they're saying we're not going to even
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.720]  let people advertise on our platforms regular people even have bank accounts
[11:16.720 --> 11:20.920]  jihad watch has had their mastercard taken away they had for 20 years now
[11:20.920 --> 11:27.080]  mastercard says you can't bank you can't live oh it's just a private company
[11:27.080 --> 11:32.440]  they are organizing like a tyranny's always do to link up it's the linking up
[11:32.440 --> 11:38.320]  of companies in a cartel to persecute groups that is totally illegal that is
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.600]  the most dangerous expression of communism and fascism and authoritarianism it
[11:42.600 --> 11:46.760]  is the it is the tail-tale sign censorship cartels linking together
[11:46.760 --> 11:52.080]  trying to kick you out of the market it is exactly what Adolf Hitler did it's
[11:52.080 --> 11:56.200]  exactly what the island and did it's exactly what Mao Zedong did it's
[11:56.200 --> 12:01.880]  exactly what Hugo Chavez did it's exactly what Fidel Castro did it's
[12:01.880 --> 12:07.600]  exactly what these regimes do 100% it's what Mussolini did I need to a
[12:07.600 --> 12:14.880]  Mussolini it is the blood the guts the bone the brain the skin the hair the
[12:14.880 --> 12:21.600]  arms the everything of of tyranny it's it we know what it looks like we know
[12:21.600 --> 12:26.440]  what it acts like we know it behaves we know what it is
[12:26.440 --> 12:36.400]  so see I've already kind of gotten into my whole argument that we must stop this
[12:36.400 --> 12:44.440]  now by Congress not having any control over the internet they have removed net
[12:44.440 --> 12:52.520]  neutrality now again Obama called it net neutrality but what that was was
[12:52.520 --> 12:55.880]  bringing in regulations so these companies could censor whoever they
[12:55.880 --> 12:59.920]  wanted to have liability protection the Republican said we're reversing that but
[12:59.920 --> 13:04.240]  then they didn't put anything in its place so then it became even more of a
[13:04.240 --> 13:12.880]  free-for-all but again it's global America's only 325 million people China's
[13:12.880 --> 13:17.960]  a billion and a half India's a billion 100 million the EU is 350 something
[13:17.960 --> 13:21.360]  million there's all these other places and the EU is coming in with billion
[13:21.360 --> 13:24.240]  dollar fines every few weeks against these companies to go under their
[13:24.240 --> 13:27.200]  regulations they're not gonna just create all these different regulations for
[13:27.200 --> 13:30.840]  different countries and regions there they're adopting the EU and Chinese
[13:30.840 --> 13:34.160]  model they're building the Chinese censorship engines and they're building
[13:34.160 --> 13:40.560]  them here and they're just unifying it so by Congress leaving this vacuum open
[13:40.560 --> 13:45.840]  and and by all of us sitting here like fools going word open society these are
[13:45.840 --> 13:49.400]  private companies they can do what they want the Democrats are now all over the
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.400]  news banning all Republicans even talking about their campaigns or putting
[13:53.400 --> 13:56.960]  their campaign ads up on their Facebook or Twitter or YouTube but the Democrats
[13:56.960 --> 14:01.080]  can operate all they want anti-fiction say we're gonna put bullets in Congress's
[14:01.080 --> 14:04.720]  heads and kill Trump and kill his family and kill talk show hosts and I go well
[14:04.720 --> 14:07.680]  folks you better have your battle rifles ready by your bed because they may
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.920]  actually attack your houses it's already been happening that turns into I said
[14:11.920 --> 14:15.960]  battle rifles for the media and they don't show it do they because they've
[14:15.960 --> 14:23.720]  gone next level fraud folks this shows they're going for broke so there is a
[14:23.720 --> 14:31.720]  vacuum there is a system of Congress asleep at the switch drooling and the
[14:31.720 --> 14:36.000]  Googles and and Facebooks and apples of the world patting them on the back like
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.040]  their complete morons while they adopt the EU and Chinese model and merge the
[14:41.040 --> 14:47.160]  censorship systems in standardization and now they're saying hell if we win the
[14:47.160 --> 14:52.480]  house we're gonna go ahead with full internet takeover and total censorship
[14:52.480 --> 14:56.280]  that's been out for weeks and Senator Warner on Monday released more documents
[14:56.280 --> 15:00.560]  calling for it I've got one of the top first-minute law firms in the country
[15:00.560 --> 15:05.160]  and they looked at it and they could not believe it this is true tyranny but are
[15:05.160 --> 15:09.640]  are you thinking they're not gonna just fill that vacuum whenever Governor
[15:09.640 --> 15:13.160]  Cuomo said America was never great America is a piece of crap and CNN
[15:13.160 --> 15:18.440]  agreed with him that's coming up they're telling you the truth they are such in

[18:18.560 --> 18:22.480]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[18:22.480 --> 18:27.160]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[18:27.160 --> 18:31.720]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[18:31.720 --> 18:36.400]  of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal

[20:07.800 --> 20:26.600]  music
[20:37.800 --> 20:56.560]  You are watching the most censored, most attacked, most underseaged, most demonized broadcast
[20:56.560 --> 20:59.760]  in the Western Hemisphere.
[20:59.760 --> 21:05.840]  Much of the East is already behind an iron curtain of the Chinese Great Firewall.
[21:05.840 --> 21:11.120]  In Politico, we can put that article up on screen, came out and said, welcome to the
[21:11.120 --> 21:19.120]  age of worldwide digital censorship online with China and the EU directing it.
[21:19.120 --> 21:23.320]  And Congress sits there sucking their thumb saying, we're not going to regulate these
[21:23.320 --> 21:29.680]  private companies, meaning they leave a vacuum and those companies are now under EU and Chai
[21:29.680 --> 21:36.160]  Com control and are officially moving to China and censoring everything here.
[21:36.160 --> 21:40.360]  And spying on everywhere you go and what you do, Google is more of a threat to our freedoms
[21:40.360 --> 21:42.560]  than the NSA could ever imagine.
[21:42.560 --> 21:44.520]  Apple has the worst slave factories.
[21:44.520 --> 21:46.220]  Apple pays the least taxes.
[21:46.220 --> 21:52.920]  Apple is a venomous, hateful group, but they camouflage themselves with gay pride parades
[21:52.920 --> 22:01.960]  and Black Lives Matter fundraisers, absolutely wicked beyond imagination, but not a word
[22:01.960 --> 22:07.280]  from Tim Cook about China executing gays.
[22:07.280 --> 22:10.360]  But now they've come out of the closet, the America haters.
[22:10.360 --> 22:16.200]  If you go to the universities or you've been brought up in the last 30, 40, 50 years in
[22:16.200 --> 22:21.640]  this country, most schools, most government institutions teach America hating, Christian
[22:21.640 --> 22:28.120]  hating, capitalism hating, they give you a false history.
[22:28.120 --> 22:29.920]  You don't learn about the Trojan War.
[22:29.920 --> 22:33.480]  You don't learn about ancient China or you don't learn about the Revolutionary War.
[22:33.480 --> 22:35.440]  You learn about America being racist.
[22:35.440 --> 22:37.480]  You learn about America being sexist.
[22:37.480 --> 22:42.720]  But it's been a big wake up call when Governor Cuomo, who told Christians and conservatives
[22:42.720 --> 22:47.240]  and gun owners get out of the state, people said, you're joking to your, he goes, no,
[22:47.240 --> 22:51.200]  get the H out, he said.
[22:51.200 --> 22:53.800]  Remember that?
[22:53.800 --> 22:58.000]  And then CNN and others came out to his defense, even though he backed off of it.
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.560]  He's speaking to fellow Democrats about America's never been great.
[23:01.560 --> 23:02.560]  America's bad.
[23:02.560 --> 23:04.200]  America's mean to women.
[23:04.200 --> 23:09.120]  You need to have chips on your shoulders and then come under my pimp's control.
[23:09.120 --> 23:10.920]  I'll pimp you out good.
[23:10.920 --> 23:13.560]  So that kind of blew up in his face.
[23:13.560 --> 23:15.200]  So he said, oh, I didn't mean it.
[23:15.200 --> 23:16.200]  It's out of context.
[23:16.200 --> 23:19.600]  And then CNN and others go, no, no, no, America is bad.
[23:19.600 --> 23:23.800]  Well, that's what they're already teaching because they want to conquer the idea of free
[23:23.800 --> 23:24.800]  market.
[23:24.800 --> 23:28.280]  They want to make everybody think that America isn't theirs, that they couldn't be wealthy
[23:28.280 --> 23:33.000]  or successful or free or make their own choices or that the potential of the American system
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.720]  is the most powerful potential the world's ever seen and that we have been exceptional
[23:36.720 --> 23:40.920]  because of our ideals of rugged individualism.
[23:40.920 --> 23:44.920]  But they're fundamentally threatened with that.
[23:44.920 --> 23:51.760]  And as Trump said, he can't imagine what a worse statement is from Cuomo, that America's
[23:51.760 --> 24:02.760]  never really been that great or that it will never be that great.
[24:02.760 --> 24:05.880]  He asked the question in the tweet.
[24:05.880 --> 24:13.040]  He doesn't know which one of the statements is worse.
[24:13.040 --> 24:19.360]  So let's go ahead and play, everybody's been seeing for the last two days, but then we'll
[24:19.360 --> 24:21.880]  play CNN and others defending it.
[24:21.880 --> 24:23.040]  Here it is.
[24:23.040 --> 24:27.400]  We're not going to make America great again.
[24:27.400 --> 24:32.240]  It was never that great.
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.440]  We have not reached greatness.
[24:36.440 --> 24:44.400]  We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.
[24:44.400 --> 24:53.040]  We will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51 percent
[24:53.040 --> 24:56.000]  of our population is gone.
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.840]  I think points like yours that are focusing only on the negative and not even acknowledging
[25:01.840 --> 25:06.280]  700,000 new jobs for black people in this country, record low unemployment and the rest
[25:06.280 --> 25:07.280]  of it.
[25:07.280 --> 25:10.840]  It's tantamount to what Andrew Cuomo said today that upset me, too, that America has
[25:10.840 --> 25:11.840]  never been great.
[25:11.840 --> 25:28.040]  Let's focus on what we've done well and let's focus on what America is doing well and how
[25:28.040 --> 25:37.400]  about we look at what we can do rather than to call each other names and cut each other
[25:37.400 --> 25:38.880]  down and be divisive.
[25:38.880 --> 25:42.320]  I don't think this is, I think America is tired of the division.
[25:42.320 --> 25:43.320]  Starts at the top, Gina.
[25:43.320 --> 25:44.320]  Guess what?
[25:44.320 --> 25:47.240]  As soon as your president stops calling people names, maybe you'll set a better example for
[25:47.240 --> 25:50.320]  everyone else.
[25:50.320 --> 25:51.560]  You know what they're doing, right?
[25:51.560 --> 25:53.120]  It's called demoralization.
[25:53.120 --> 25:54.120]  What's Trump trying to do?
[25:54.120 --> 25:55.520]  Get our morale up.
[25:55.520 --> 25:57.000]  We are literally being demoralized.
[25:57.000 --> 26:03.440]  When an enemy government comes in and captured a nation, the first thing they do is demoralize
[26:03.440 --> 26:07.600]  the population and tell them the worst parts of their history and harp on it and then get
[26:07.600 --> 26:10.840]  collaborators to come and join and say, yeah, I hate the country.
[26:10.840 --> 26:16.120]  I'll go out and work against it and help you take it over.
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.480]  That's what they do in red dawn at the reeducation camp that is a fictional camp, but based on
[26:20.480 --> 26:23.680]  what real Soviet camps would do to countries they'd taken over.
[26:23.680 --> 26:27.360]  So let's put one of Trump's many tweets about Como on screen.
[26:27.360 --> 26:30.080]  I'm going to read this and there's never been true words spoken.
[26:30.080 --> 26:32.240]  Here it is.
[26:32.240 --> 26:40.980]  How does a politician, Como, know, known for pushing people and businesses out of his state?
[26:40.980 --> 26:47.080]  Not to mention having the highest taxes in the US survive making the statement, we're
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.040]  not going to make America great again.
[26:51.040 --> 26:55.040]  It was never that great.
[26:55.040 --> 26:57.720]  Which section of the sentence is worse?
[26:57.720 --> 26:58.720]  It's really hard.
[26:58.720 --> 27:00.320]  Well, I think the worst part is this.
[27:00.320 --> 27:03.400]  You could say America wasn't great if you had a chip on your shoulder and a twisted
[27:03.400 --> 27:04.400]  view.
[27:04.400 --> 27:05.560]  I didn't understand the real complexities.
[27:05.560 --> 27:09.200]  You could say if you were ignorant that America was never great.
[27:09.200 --> 27:10.200]  I don't agree with that.
[27:10.200 --> 27:11.840]  It's obviously stupid and doesn't know history.
[27:11.840 --> 27:13.360]  You measure America up.
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.080]  All the foreign historians, Japanese, French, German, Russian, Mexican, Chilean, they all
[27:18.080 --> 27:20.680]  said just incredible.
[27:20.680 --> 27:24.040]  Great background, the buildings, the construction, the invention.
[27:24.040 --> 27:25.440]  Nobody could build a Panama Canal.
[27:25.440 --> 27:26.440]  Two countries failed.
[27:26.440 --> 27:27.440]  We built it.
[27:27.440 --> 27:29.120]  Then gave it to the chai comms.
[27:29.120 --> 27:31.960]  We go in, fight countries, turn them back over to them.
[27:31.960 --> 27:34.600]  Nobody else does that.
[27:34.600 --> 27:38.240]  But you can sit there and argue, okay, we were never great if you're ignorant.
[27:38.240 --> 27:46.520]  But to say and will never be great is saying you are a piece of crap.
[27:46.520 --> 27:47.640]  You are my slave.
[27:47.640 --> 27:48.720]  I am over you.
[27:48.720 --> 27:50.720]  We suck.
[27:50.720 --> 27:51.720]  Stay demoralized.
[27:51.720 --> 27:53.240]  Stay on assistance.
[27:53.240 --> 27:54.240]  Never get off welfare.
[27:54.240 --> 27:55.560]  I control you.
[27:55.560 --> 27:56.560]  Keep down.
[27:56.560 --> 27:57.680]  You're a nobody.
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.240]  Super negative crap that is the poison of these people.
[28:02.240 --> 28:03.240]  You get around Democrats.
[28:03.240 --> 28:04.400]  You go to their events.
[28:04.400 --> 28:06.800]  They're all like this.
[28:06.800 --> 28:10.680]  They're either desperate, scared, poor people that a bunch of rich elitists look down on.
[28:10.680 --> 28:17.520]  I was telling my wife that Democrats in Congress historically have about 80% of the wealth.
[28:17.520 --> 28:19.560]  Democrats in Congress, they have most of the wealth.
[28:19.560 --> 28:20.560]  They're the rich people.
[28:20.560 --> 28:21.560]  She goes, really?
[28:21.560 --> 28:22.560]  I thought they're the party of poor people.
[28:22.560 --> 28:23.560]  And I go, no.
[28:23.560 --> 28:26.080]  They're the party of keeping you poor.
[28:26.080 --> 28:28.960]  Almost every billionaire is a Democrat.
[28:28.960 --> 28:30.200]  All of them.
[28:30.200 --> 28:34.920]  Carlos Slim, the Mexican kingpin, made $5 billion off U.S. taxpayers for Obama phones.
[28:34.920 --> 28:36.560]  It's all a big kickback scheme.
[28:36.560 --> 28:37.800]  It's all a big scam.
[28:37.800 --> 28:41.360]  They are trying to suppress you and tell you you're ugly and you're a piece of crap
[28:41.360 --> 28:42.720]  and make you fight with each other.
[28:42.720 --> 28:47.120]  It's in the WikiLeaks that they want to demoralize us and have race conflict.
[28:47.120 --> 28:48.120]  They're monsters.
[28:48.120 --> 28:49.120]  They're scum.
[28:49.120 --> 28:50.120]  They're filth.
[28:50.120 --> 28:51.120]  My God.
[28:51.120 --> 28:52.120]  They're the enemy.
[28:52.120 --> 28:56.920]  They are the enemy and they're planning false slags against themselves to be the victim.
[28:56.920 --> 28:59.120]  They're monster criminals.
[28:59.120 --> 29:03.400]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists, get back to nature.

[33:26.160 --> 33:30.200]  Okay folks, I've got to get to the news today because I didn't get to a lot of it the last
[33:30.200 --> 33:32.880]  few days because we've been under such attack and that's been one of the top stories in
[33:32.880 --> 33:38.120]  the country for two weeks that we're under massive censorship attack and that is draconian
[33:38.120 --> 33:39.520]  and that it's been for everybody.
[33:39.520 --> 33:45.560]  But I need to get into massive asset attacks in the UK, massive rape attacks all over
[33:45.560 --> 33:51.000]  Sweden and Europe, thousands of cars being burned, people being stabbed, murdered.
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.000]  This is all Islamic jihad but the media is covering it up and there are resting people
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.640]  that point out that it's al-Qaeda related and ISIS related.
[34:00.640 --> 34:05.560]  They are now taking people off their credit card companies here in the US if they are
[34:05.560 --> 34:10.120]  pro-Israel or speak out against jihad.
[34:10.120 --> 34:14.080]  Whether you're for Israel or not, people have a right to be pro-Israel, right, like jihad
[34:14.080 --> 34:15.080]  watch.
[34:15.080 --> 34:21.840]  This is really, really dangerous and I told everybody that I was only the first domino.
[34:21.840 --> 34:28.560]  Even Politico has the headline that just came out yesterday, I hadn't seen this, welcome
[34:28.560 --> 34:32.360]  to the new era of digital censorship, it's dangerous to ask tech companies to decide
[34:32.360 --> 34:36.640]  what's legitimate free speech.
[34:36.640 --> 34:40.640]  And they admit and now others are admitting and I know some big names are about to become
[34:40.640 --> 34:46.480]  public in defense of infor wars very strongly because folks understand what's happening.
[34:46.480 --> 34:49.920]  And I'm going to explain it one more time, I'm going to do it the next segment because
[34:49.920 --> 34:52.400]  I want to lay all this out.
[34:52.400 --> 34:58.440]  The EU has fined tens of billions of dollars against US based tech giants.
[34:58.440 --> 35:03.280]  To get out of that, they're just moving to China where the EU never even tries to enforce
[35:03.280 --> 35:06.160]  stuff because the Chinese ignore it.
[35:06.160 --> 35:13.880]  So by creating that vacuum, Congress has allowed China and has allowed the EU particularly
[35:13.880 --> 35:18.960]  to take control of our internet, we're now going under their policies.
[35:18.960 --> 35:23.320]  And I'm going to continue to lay it out in reports here on air but it's in the news.
[35:23.320 --> 35:28.120]  So Congress must act under national security issues to have an internet bill of rights
[35:28.120 --> 35:32.400]  and to say we're going to follow our own rules here and these companies that have operated
[35:32.400 --> 35:37.680]  like utilities and have said that they are monopolies and have said that they are the
[35:37.680 --> 35:42.920]  open digital soap box and the Democrats admit, take Jones out of the digital soap box, take
[35:42.920 --> 35:45.920]  him out of the town square, silence him.
[35:45.920 --> 35:53.360]  And have said it, senators have said it, that are quarterbacking it, do you understand that?
[35:53.360 --> 35:57.880]  We have the reports, it's all admitted, you guys pull me up, I had all the articles with
[35:57.880 --> 36:02.960]  the Congress and senators saying, don't just silence Jones, silence everyone.
[36:02.960 --> 36:06.160]  And then the Republicans go, we're free market companies, you do whatever they want.
[36:06.160 --> 36:10.200]  These are things bigger than the country combined.
[36:10.200 --> 36:15.200]  You had Apple and Google and Twitter and Facebook and another 20-something companies together,
[36:15.200 --> 36:20.720]  you're talking about a GDP close to the country, you're talking about the infrastructure
[36:20.720 --> 36:21.720]  of how people communicate.
[36:21.720 --> 36:26.000]  I understand the average Congressperson is like 70 and still uses landlines and stuff
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.200]  but baby, that ain't how we're talking.
[36:28.200 --> 36:32.960]  Well, you have a right to use a telegraph if you want Jones, really, they're trying
[36:32.960 --> 36:37.560]  to get Akamai that we've used for five, six years and paid millions of dollars.
[36:37.560 --> 36:44.160]  They've had a mutiny inside Akamai telling them, don't let us buy services to stream
[36:44.160 --> 36:45.640]  our own video.
[36:45.640 --> 36:48.680]  They're trying to take down our credit card providers, already took one down.
[36:48.680 --> 36:55.120]  We're under racketeering criminal assault.
[36:55.120 --> 36:59.320]  Now I want to make an addendum, just a little point here, I want to add this on to what
[36:59.320 --> 37:09.280]  I said earlier in the last segment, if you just joined us, I want to add this point in.
[37:09.280 --> 37:14.120]  The Democrats are suddenly coming out all over TV, not just Colombo but on CNN, MSNB,
[37:14.120 --> 37:19.440]  CNBC and saying we hate America and America was never great and it will never be great
[37:19.440 --> 37:25.520]  because their psychology is keeping you desperate and basically at a subsistence level so that
[37:25.520 --> 37:26.800]  you're never independent.
[37:26.800 --> 37:30.240]  They want to arrest your development, they want to keep you under their control, they
[37:30.240 --> 37:35.560]  want to keep you depressed, CNN, MSNBC, NPR, I was talking to the cruder in the break with
[37:35.560 --> 37:38.920]  a lot of Democrat friends, they go, yeah, they're all depressed, they think America
[37:38.920 --> 37:43.600]  sucks, they think they suck, believe me, Colmo doesn't think it sucks, he's ruling
[37:43.600 --> 37:50.800]  over you, Hillary doesn't think it's bad, think about how bizarre that statement is
[37:50.800 --> 37:57.680]  and America will never be great, it's never been that great and it'll never be great because
[37:57.680 --> 38:03.440]  they want you as their slaves, they don't want to compete in a real renaissance because
[38:03.440 --> 38:08.440]  control freaks like them in communist China or the Democratic Party or in Venezuela or
[38:08.440 --> 38:12.000]  any of these places get left behind.
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.320]  Like the EU, it's got unelected bureaucrats that set it up that sit over it, they're exempt
[38:17.320 --> 38:23.160]  from taxes and cannot be removed, it's a Politburo and they want to make people depressed,
[38:23.160 --> 38:27.480]  they want to break down the general society, everywhere Democrats and globalists and socialists
[38:27.480 --> 38:32.080]  are in control, you have ultra rich people ruling over the population and rivers of
[38:32.080 --> 38:39.480]  crap all over the streets, it's what their spirit creates, it's what they push, it's
[38:39.480 --> 38:43.920]  what they do, they're trying to demoralize us like a foreign army that has captured
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.600]  us would do, that's the facts.
[38:47.600 --> 38:53.080]  Now, coming up, I'm going to get into their master plan for total censorship and how it
[38:53.080 --> 38:58.600]  can be stopped and how we approach Congress with this that they absolutely must act once
[38:58.600 --> 39:04.400]  they get their heads out of their rear ends because they've been mantraed in by the Heritage
[39:04.400 --> 39:08.680]  Foundation and all these groups that it's free market to let China have 100% tariffs
[39:08.680 --> 39:14.200]  on us and we have none on them or it's free market to have Canada with a 280% tariff on
[39:14.200 --> 39:21.840]  all dairy, milk, cheese, yogurt, everything, tens of billions of dollars a year and then
[39:21.840 --> 39:23.360]  we have none on them.
[39:23.360 --> 39:28.600]  That's why we've got Canadian dairy all over the US and there's no US dairy in Canada because
[39:28.600 --> 39:37.840]  it is a 100% wall of 280% tariff, you cannot ever compete with that.
[39:37.840 --> 39:38.840]  Is that free market?
[39:38.840 --> 39:46.920]  No, that's the opposite of free market and it's the same thing with the Internet.
[39:46.920 --> 39:49.880]  They don't get involved saying we're going to have a level playing field, they open
[39:49.880 --> 39:55.400]  up a giant vacuum and Big Tech's spending a lot of money up on Capitol Hill to keep
[39:55.400 --> 40:00.560]  people dumb like Matt Gaetz and others and they need to get smart right now because they
[40:00.560 --> 40:07.480]  know what's going on but they stay tone deaf to it because they think, well, Big Tech's
[40:07.480 --> 40:11.880]  going to put money in my real estate campaign but I just don't get on their ass.
[40:11.880 --> 40:18.280]  You'll never get reelected any of you if you don't do something about this now.
[40:18.280 --> 40:23.480]  Now I've sacrificed to be blacklisted everywhere to tell the truth and save the country and
[40:23.480 --> 40:27.440]  that's what I should do and it's what you should do, man up and start acting like men.
[40:27.440 --> 40:32.800]  Now that said, if you notice you go to infowars.com now, we'll take three or four of the top most
[40:32.800 --> 40:38.960]  important videos of the day that are emergency transmissions and we post them there.
[40:38.960 --> 40:42.120]  I want you to download them, I want you to stream them, I want you to put them on your
[40:42.120 --> 40:47.120]  own site, I want you to edit them, do whatever you want, just magnify them and amplify them
[40:47.120 --> 40:51.240]  and get them out and that's what people are doing all over the country and all over the
[40:51.240 --> 40:52.240]  world.
[40:52.240 --> 40:56.400]  It might be going into an Apple store and putting infowars.com on every screen or doing
[40:56.400 --> 41:00.920]  it at your computer class at college or doing it at the airport.
[41:00.920 --> 41:04.040]  There's a video on infowars.com of a lady doing that.
[41:04.040 --> 41:10.200]  It's all happening or legally and lawfully posting handbills up that infowars.com is
[41:10.200 --> 41:18.440]  verboten and it will backfire with the Streisand effect if you do that and it's begun to happen
[41:18.440 --> 41:23.480]  so I want to salute you, I want to thank you, I want to encourage you and I want to ask
[41:23.480 --> 41:25.480]  everybody to continue it.
[41:25.480 --> 41:31.600]  The front page of infowars.com every day, many times we'll have a special splash page
[41:31.600 --> 41:36.960]  with what I believe is the most critical information and then you can go to all the sites and link
[41:36.960 --> 41:43.320]  to the shopping cart, you name it, but listen, they took $3 million of our funding for the
[41:43.320 --> 41:49.360]  next year, they took away Cridio that approached us when we got kicked off Adroll a year and
[41:49.360 --> 41:52.000]  a half ago.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.120]  That is crippling and devastating.
[41:54.120 --> 41:55.440]  We need to make that money up.
[41:55.440 --> 41:56.600]  They're hitting me with all these lawsuits.
[41:56.600 --> 42:01.680]  We can defeat it and we're going to hold out but we need you to seriously commit and understand.
[42:01.680 --> 42:03.880]  I told you we're under attack, you're under attack.
[42:03.880 --> 42:07.880]  When you fund us, you are funding yourself and do you want to see them win?
[42:07.880 --> 42:08.880]  I know you don't.
[42:08.880 --> 42:15.760]  So go to infowars.com and get supplements you need, get books and videos and forbidden
[42:15.760 --> 42:23.760]  information t-shirt or latest shirt with our infowars.com at the top and then an image
[42:23.760 --> 42:29.360]  of myself with a table in my mouth saying is forbidden information.
[42:29.360 --> 42:33.320]  White t-shirt and black, very, very powerful message.
[42:33.320 --> 42:34.320]  It's happening.
[42:34.320 --> 42:35.320]  It's going down.
[42:35.320 --> 42:39.840]  It's here and it's up to you to strike back against it peacefully and lawfully because
[42:39.840 --> 42:43.960]  this is the greatest time in our lives, in our history, they're trying to take down America
[42:43.960 --> 42:50.280]  right now and if we don't win this election coming up, it's going to be an even crazier
[42:50.280 --> 42:55.320]  fight so we need to understand the next month and a half, the next two months is so incredibly
[42:55.320 --> 42:59.320]  critical only what 81 days, ladies and gentlemen, 81 days.
[42:59.320 --> 43:00.320]  We knew it was coming.
[43:00.320 --> 43:02.320]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[43:02.320 --> 43:07.560]  First demonize info wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[43:07.560 --> 43:12.880]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[43:12.880 --> 43:16.360]  children and Islamophobia and then wallah.
[43:16.360 --> 43:22.280]  Two weeks later, ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we
[43:22.280 --> 43:26.440]  were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds.
[43:26.440 --> 43:32.520]  Go to info wars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link.
[43:32.520 --> 43:36.000]  Whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.160]  It's also critical to go to info wars.com, forward slash newsletter and give us your
[43:40.160 --> 43:44.360]  email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our
[43:44.360 --> 43:45.360]  own platform.
[43:45.360 --> 43:50.080]  But whatever you do, tell folks about info wars.com, forward slash show, how they can
[43:50.080 --> 43:54.440]  download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with
[43:54.440 --> 43:57.600]  the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[43:57.600 --> 43:59.560]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[43:59.560 --> 44:03.400]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an
[44:03.400 --> 44:05.080]  info wars life.

[44:36.680 --> 44:37.880]  You can also swallow it.
[44:37.880 --> 44:43.920]  It's a supplement with iodine, a super high quality silver and a lot more without you.
[44:43.920 --> 44:44.920]  We couldn't do it.

[47:03.400 --> 47:31.640]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:33.400 --> 48:00.280]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[48:00.280 --> 48:09.540]  First Chinese and EU's of the world, not just around the world but in the United States,
[48:09.540 --> 48:17.360]  Congress's inaction has created a huge vacuum that has green-lighted Google, Apple and many
[48:17.360 --> 48:28.200]  companies that originated and now build censorship engines to have the code keys to the I cloud
[48:28.200 --> 48:30.440]  That's access to all of your private information
[48:31.540 --> 48:33.580]  in the hands of the Chinese government.
[48:33.580 --> 48:37.440]  Meanwhile, the EU is bringing in regulatory control.
[48:37.440 --> 48:42.440]  The name of people's privacy has nothing to do with it.
[48:43.200 --> 48:46.400]  With giant fines against Google and others,
[48:47.280 --> 48:49.760]  and Facebook and the billions of dollars
[48:49.760 --> 48:53.440]  to make them regulatory comply with EU rules
[48:53.440 --> 48:56.400]  that censor speech, and Facebook and others
[48:56.400 --> 48:59.760]  have hired former senior Stasi members,
[49:00.880 --> 49:03.880]  can't make this up to help report people
[49:03.880 --> 49:07.200]  that criticize radical Islam or who are nationalists
[49:07.200 --> 49:09.740]  so they can be arrested and or fined.
[49:10.840 --> 49:15.840]  So I'm reaching out to congressman Matt Gaetz
[49:16.240 --> 49:18.240]  and congressman Jim Jordan and many others
[49:18.240 --> 49:20.300]  who seem to be intelligent and pro-American,
[49:20.300 --> 49:22.580]  but on this subject have not really said enough
[49:22.580 --> 49:24.200]  because they're spinning it like,
[49:24.200 --> 49:25.540]  well, these are private companies.
[49:25.540 --> 49:28.520]  No, they've said they operate as public squares.
[49:28.520 --> 49:30.000]  They operate as utilities.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.120]  The left is saying silence conservatives
[49:32.120 --> 49:33.840]  from the public square.
[49:33.840 --> 49:35.640]  They admit that I am the first domino.
[49:35.640 --> 49:37.000]  I'll show you some news articles,
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.240]  mainstream news here in a minute.
[49:38.240 --> 49:40.560]  It's not Stalix Jones saying it.
[49:40.560 --> 49:41.520]  And I'm being silenced
[49:41.520 --> 49:43.740]  because I've been beating the drum for this.
[49:44.920 --> 49:45.920]  What should Congress do?
[49:45.920 --> 49:48.120]  Well, you should hold hearings on the subject.
[49:49.320 --> 49:51.080]  And you should look at how many members of Congress
[49:51.080 --> 49:52.960]  themselves have been completely shadow banned
[49:52.960 --> 49:56.920]  or have been governed curtailed down over 90%.
[49:56.920 --> 49:58.720]  And that Breitbart studies show
[49:58.720 --> 50:01.000]  conservative sites on Facebook,
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.920]  Google and Apple platforms like Breitbart
[50:03.920 --> 50:06.100]  and the Daily Caller and others
[50:06.100 --> 50:09.920]  have been cut back 93% from 80%
[50:09.920 --> 50:12.460]  just a few months ago on their reach.
[50:12.460 --> 50:15.080]  They're not letting people communicate.
[50:15.080 --> 50:17.080]  They're not letting users on Facebook
[50:17.080 --> 50:20.520]  go to the Breitbart website or the Info Wars website
[50:20.520 --> 50:21.800]  and share it.
[50:21.800 --> 50:25.000]  They're getting in front of them preemptively.
[50:26.720 --> 50:29.640]  These companies engage in false advertising.
[50:29.640 --> 50:31.640]  They advertise as the public square
[50:31.640 --> 50:34.120]  as long as you've played by their rules.
[50:34.120 --> 50:37.920]  But their rules are all subjectively put into place
[50:37.920 --> 50:41.560]  by SJW leftist that have been hired
[50:41.560 --> 50:43.200]  to run and captain these systems.
[50:43.200 --> 50:46.640]  So again, Congress and the president's inaction
[50:46.640 --> 50:48.520]  and we the people's inaction
[50:48.520 --> 50:52.360]  has created a vacuum and a perfect storm.
[50:52.360 --> 50:54.000]  We're dying dinosaur media,
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.200]  the scared democratic party
[50:56.200 --> 50:58.000]  that the public's realigning against
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.560]  and foreign governments have now colluded
[51:00.560 --> 51:03.200]  to bring in total internet control.
[51:03.200 --> 51:05.800]  I know Congress is aware that Senator Warner
[51:05.800 --> 51:08.360]  has circulated plans to have the Democrats
[51:08.360 --> 51:10.400]  take over the web if they win the midterms.
[51:10.400 --> 51:13.280]  I'm sure you've seen Senator Murphy say that quote,
[51:13.280 --> 51:15.920]  I'm the tip of an iceberg of conservative news
[51:15.920 --> 51:17.360]  that needs to be banned.
[51:17.360 --> 51:19.680]  I'm sure you know all this is going on.
[51:20.800 --> 51:22.880]  I'm sure you know that Google's moving to China
[51:22.880 --> 51:24.720]  and setting up a censorship search engine there
[51:24.720 --> 51:27.080]  and that their own executives have leaked
[51:27.080 --> 51:28.360]  in mainstream news here,
[51:28.360 --> 51:30.280]  but it got no attention
[51:30.280 --> 51:33.280]  that they're helping set up censorship engines here
[51:33.280 --> 51:35.240]  because they're gonna unify it with China.
[51:35.240 --> 51:38.360]  China is now the giant sucking sound.
[51:38.360 --> 51:41.120]  And because we won't stand up for true net neutrality
[51:41.120 --> 51:42.160]  and because we won't stand up
[51:42.160 --> 51:44.120]  for a true internet bill of rights,
[51:44.120 --> 51:46.040]  we're no longer the leader in the world
[51:46.040 --> 51:49.920]  by advocating our responsibility by stepping down
[51:49.920 --> 51:53.440]  and letting China and the EU and the big banks
[51:53.440 --> 51:57.080]  and corrupt Silicon Valley trained by the big universities,
[51:57.080 --> 51:58.800]  the big America hating groups
[51:58.800 --> 52:02.260]  to want to silence flyover country.
[52:03.320 --> 52:04.760]  This is devastating information.
[52:04.760 --> 52:06.920]  Here's some of the articles just to do it.
[52:06.920 --> 52:10.120]  Twitter purges accounts across the platform again.
[52:11.280 --> 52:12.840]  Anyone that had ever had any strikes
[52:12.840 --> 52:14.120]  or ever had any problems,
[52:14.120 --> 52:16.200]  well now you're being completely banned.
[52:16.200 --> 52:18.240]  Social media platform Twitter has begun banning
[52:18.240 --> 52:19.840]  a large number of accounts
[52:19.840 --> 52:21.960]  from the website specifically focusing on accounts
[52:21.960 --> 52:23.240]  that have previously been banned
[52:23.240 --> 52:26.160]  or have received suspensions.
[52:26.160 --> 52:28.080]  And they're going after everybody
[52:28.080 --> 52:30.600]  from Gavin McGinnis to Laura Loomer.
[52:30.600 --> 52:33.160]  And then continuing here, here's another one, Politico.
[52:33.160 --> 52:35.880]  Welcome to the new era of global digital censorship.
[52:35.880 --> 52:38.400]  It's dangerous to ask tech companies to decide
[52:38.400 --> 52:39.560]  what's legitimate free speech.
[52:39.560 --> 52:41.480]  Well, they don't, the Democratic Party,
[52:41.480 --> 52:46.000]  the Southern Prairie Law Center, the ADL, Snopes,
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  Media Matters run by George Soros,
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.020]  they all have created databases.
[52:52.280 --> 52:54.320]  They have now been brought into the fact checkers
[52:54.320 --> 52:56.200]  to flag information.
[52:58.160 --> 53:00.400]  And then you know the famous disinfo
[53:00.400 --> 53:03.560]  that they're constantly getting caught involved in.
[53:03.560 --> 53:05.680]  If the sky is blue, they say it's red.
[53:05.680 --> 53:07.600]  So I'm asking Congress, I'm asking the public,
[53:07.600 --> 53:10.640]  I'm asking everyone to take this information
[53:10.640 --> 53:12.600]  and to investigate it yourself and to do something
[53:12.600 --> 53:14.320]  because the First Amendment is so critical.
[53:14.320 --> 53:18.920]  And I want to add this right now, we're live on Friday.
[53:20.460 --> 53:22.780]  But we're going to take the video report here.
[53:22.780 --> 53:25.420]  We're going to post it at the front page of infowars.com
[53:25.420 --> 53:27.880]  along with other key reports that all of you
[53:27.880 --> 53:29.480]  can go get the link to.
[53:29.480 --> 53:32.080]  We're going to post them as articles on infowars.com.
[53:33.600 --> 53:37.300]  And we need you to send these video reports to Congress.
[53:37.300 --> 53:40.440]  We need you to go to the congressman's
[53:40.440 --> 53:42.480]  Facebooks, their Twitters, everywhere
[53:42.480 --> 53:44.000]  and communicate with them.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.600]  They're trying to censor us, but they can't stop you
[53:46.600 --> 53:49.160]  going around them directly to them digitally
[53:49.160 --> 53:50.680]  or directly to the Capitol
[53:50.680 --> 53:53.300]  or directly to their home offices.
[53:54.160 --> 53:57.160]  Go in, sit down with their chief of staff.
[53:57.160 --> 53:59.400]  Go sit down with their people and show them this.
[53:59.400 --> 54:01.760]  And whoever does this will be the champion
[54:01.760 --> 54:04.540]  of the First Amendment and will get incredible support
[54:04.540 --> 54:07.440]  from the left and right, the left at the grassroots level
[54:07.440 --> 54:10.120]  who aren't complete tyrants are upset about this.
[54:10.120 --> 54:11.480]  Noam Chomsky's upset about this.
[54:11.480 --> 54:14.520]  This is dangerous, folks.
[54:14.520 --> 54:16.240]  This is serious.
[54:16.240 --> 54:18.640]  Again, Apple, Band Alex Jones, infowars.
[54:18.640 --> 54:20.280]  Then the dominoes started to fall.
[54:20.280 --> 54:23.200]  Vox calls for everything I do to be banned.
[54:23.200 --> 54:26.400]  And then now they brag, get rid of all the conservatives.
[54:26.400 --> 54:28.760]  And I've got articles in my stack today
[54:28.760 --> 54:31.200]  where congressional candidates across the country
[54:31.200 --> 54:33.080]  aren't even allowed to communicate on Facebook
[54:33.080 --> 54:34.200]  or Twitter with their users.
[54:34.200 --> 54:36.040]  They can't put out their campaign ads.
[54:36.040 --> 54:37.080]  Those are blocked.
[54:37.080 --> 54:38.640]  They can't even pay to have them run,
[54:38.640 --> 54:42.600]  but Democrats can all run their ads.
[54:42.600 --> 54:46.100]  Now that is a donation in kind.
[54:46.100 --> 54:49.660]  Imagine if ABC, National News,
[54:49.660 --> 54:51.520]  you tried to buy a political ad with them
[54:51.520 --> 54:55.480]  and they said no, but then they took their competitors ad.
[54:55.480 --> 54:57.200]  Imagine if a local CBS affiliate,
[54:57.200 --> 54:59.280]  you tried to go buy a bunch of ads
[54:59.280 --> 55:03.320]  for your run for governor say in Massachusetts.
[55:03.320 --> 55:04.440]  And they say, we're not letting you
[55:04.440 --> 55:06.520]  because you're a Republican,
[55:06.520 --> 55:08.800]  but we're gonna let the Democrat run.
[55:08.800 --> 55:10.560]  Come on, folks, this is racketeering.
[55:10.560 --> 55:12.160]  This is unfair trade practices.
[55:12.160 --> 55:13.160]  This is criminal.
[55:13.160 --> 55:14.000]  This is corrupt.
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.120]  This is out of control.
[55:16.520 --> 55:18.400]  And these ads that are being run,
[55:18.400 --> 55:20.360]  one we're showing right now are Asian Americans
[55:20.360 --> 55:21.840]  and others showing their families
[55:21.840 --> 55:23.840]  and how they love America and how they're winners
[55:23.840 --> 55:25.400]  and how they're not victims.
[55:25.400 --> 55:26.800]  And the Democrats are saying,
[55:26.800 --> 55:30.760]  you're not going to run those ads
[55:30.760 --> 55:32.560]  because you're telling America
[55:32.560 --> 55:33.880]  that they're not demoralized.
[55:33.880 --> 55:35.560]  You're telling America they're winners.
[55:35.560 --> 55:38.000]  You're telling America that you're doing a great job.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.080]  And the ad we're showing right now for TV viewers,
[55:40.080 --> 55:41.760]  radio listeners is on infowars.com.
[55:41.760 --> 55:42.600]  It's been banned.
[55:43.840 --> 55:46.840]  Good, wholesome ads of Congress women from Tennessee
[55:46.840 --> 55:48.240]  talking about how they love America,
[55:48.240 --> 55:49.400]  how they love their family
[55:49.400 --> 55:52.480]  and good conservative candidates
[55:52.480 --> 55:54.840]  or from places like New York,
[55:54.840 --> 55:56.800]  banned from even advertising,
[55:56.800 --> 55:58.000]  banned from the marketplace.
[55:58.000 --> 55:59.280]  Oh, but they're private companies.
[55:59.280 --> 56:00.600]  They can do what they want.
[56:01.800 --> 56:04.480]  So the newspaper wouldn't take your money to run an ad.
[56:04.480 --> 56:05.760]  That wouldn't be unfair to red practices.
[56:05.760 --> 56:06.720]  That wouldn't be discrimination.
[56:06.720 --> 56:07.880]  That wouldn't be a scandal.
[56:07.880 --> 56:09.960]  That wouldn't be something you talk about.
[56:11.640 --> 56:13.160]  Congress is asleep at the switch.
[56:13.160 --> 56:14.080]  And this is the big issue.
[56:14.080 --> 56:15.080]  The president has tried.
[56:15.080 --> 56:17.680]  He's spoken some about how shadow banning is illegal.
[56:18.600 --> 56:20.240]  Twitter's just playing games with me right now
[56:20.240 --> 56:21.760]  to act like I violated their rules
[56:21.760 --> 56:22.680]  so they can go on the news
[56:22.680 --> 56:25.040]  and misrepresent what I've said and not show it.
[56:25.040 --> 56:26.880]  Jack Gorsy, you know, Jones says
[56:26.880 --> 56:28.520]  he wants to kill the media with guns.
[56:28.520 --> 56:31.360]  I know it's terrible, but I suspended him for it.
[56:31.360 --> 56:33.440]  So when they do finally ban me, it looks legitimate.
[56:33.440 --> 56:34.800]  I never said they're anybody with guns.
[56:34.800 --> 56:35.640]  It's a lie.
[56:36.880 --> 56:38.440]  I said, Antifa says they're coming to your house
[56:38.440 --> 56:40.600]  to kill Congress members in law enforcement.
[56:40.600 --> 56:42.600]  Have your firearms ready to protect yourself.
[56:42.600 --> 56:43.840]  That's a second amendment.
[56:43.840 --> 56:46.200]  But it's everything's like a big university now.
[56:46.200 --> 56:47.680]  A big brainwashing center.
[56:48.640 --> 56:50.280]  Congress should take action on the universities
[56:50.280 --> 56:51.280]  being anti-free speech.
[56:51.280 --> 56:54.320]  These bullies, these mobs of betas are out of control.
[56:55.400 --> 56:57.400]  You know, in the land of the beta male,
[57:00.240 --> 57:02.320]  these mobs of little cowards are kings.
[57:02.320 --> 57:05.280]  In the land of the beta male, censorship is numero uno.
[57:05.280 --> 57:08.560]  In the land of the beta male, Brian Stelter is God.
[57:08.560 --> 57:10.640]  But in the land of rebels, in the land of freedom,
[57:10.640 --> 57:12.960]  the land of success, the land of alpha males,
[57:12.960 --> 57:15.240]  Info Wars is number one.
[57:15.240 --> 57:16.680]  We are proud to be rebels.
[57:16.680 --> 57:17.920]  We're proud to be hunted.
[57:17.920 --> 57:19.280]  We're proud to be attacked.
[57:19.280 --> 57:20.840]  I'm honored to be in the crosshairs.
[57:20.840 --> 57:24.120]  I swore before God that I would stand against the globalists
[57:24.120 --> 57:25.960]  and as long as God gives me strength
[57:25.960 --> 57:29.960]  and will air in my lungs and my big red heart full of light,
[57:29.960 --> 57:32.160]  I'll march on forward, stumbling sometimes
[57:32.160 --> 57:35.040]  always with grim determination, climbing the hill,
[57:35.040 --> 57:37.680]  always getting stronger even as I get weaker,
[57:37.680 --> 57:41.160]  even as I prepare to go into our final launch phase.
[57:41.160 --> 57:42.880]  The enemy is sharpening their knives.
[57:42.880 --> 57:47.160]  I enter the arena with love in my heart and lighten my eyes.
[57:47.160 --> 57:49.080]  Please support us, we'll be right back.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.360]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia,
[57:53.360 --> 57:54.560]  you're on the air worldwide.
[57:54.560 --> 57:55.400]  Thanks for holding.
[57:55.400 --> 57:56.520]  Hey, Alex, mate.
[57:56.520 --> 57:58.800]  I've been following you since I was 14
[57:58.800 --> 58:00.160]  and I'm 32 now.
[58:00.160 --> 58:02.920]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet,
[58:02.920 --> 58:05.280]  it was just blue text on a white screen
[58:05.280 --> 58:08.360]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet
[58:08.360 --> 58:09.680]  and I thought it was pretty cool
[58:09.680 --> 58:12.200]  and read all the books and seen all the DVDs
[58:12.200 --> 58:13.480]  and followed all your guests
[58:13.480 --> 58:14.840]  and I've been using your products
[58:14.840 --> 58:17.200]  since the first iteration of Survival Shield
[58:17.200 --> 58:19.080]  and since then I'm on the X2,
[58:19.080 --> 58:21.600]  the SuperMail Vitality Decay Man,
[58:21.600 --> 58:24.320]  the Real Red Pill, micro-ZX body.
[58:24.320 --> 58:25.160]  It's all amazing.
[58:25.160 --> 58:26.000]  Thank you, brother.
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.480]  it's like you're just detoxing the mind,
[58:31.480 --> 58:34.360]  you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit
[58:34.360 --> 58:36.280]  and it's just the more you know God,
[58:36.280 --> 58:39.200]  the more you fear God, but the more you chase God
[58:39.200 --> 58:40.920]  and I wanted to say that it's an honor
[58:40.920 --> 58:43.280]  to stand side by side with you, the crew
[58:43.280 --> 58:46.360]  and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[58:50.360 --> 58:52.880]  Do you realize that when you spread the links
[58:52.880 --> 58:55.840]  from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos,
[58:55.840 --> 58:58.000]  you are changing the world?
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.800]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist.
[59:01.800 --> 59:04.800]  It is you, the Info Warriors, across the planet
[59:04.800 --> 59:06.160]  that stood against the bullying,
[59:06.160 --> 59:07.560]  that stood against the peer pressure,
[59:07.560 --> 59:09.320]  that stood against the threats
[59:09.320 --> 59:10.600]  that have now changed the world
[59:10.600 --> 59:12.560]  and that's why you've been on the team,
[59:12.560 --> 59:15.120]  supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[59:15.120 --> 59:16.560]  You are the InfoWard
[59:16.560 --> 59:18.880]  and now because of their intensifying censorship,
[59:18.880 --> 59:20.800]  it's more important than ever
[59:20.800 --> 59:24.040]  that everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter
[59:24.040 --> 59:26.320]  and sign up via email so there's no way
[59:26.320 --> 59:29.160]  the censors can get between us with critical videos,
[59:29.160 --> 59:32.120]  articles, breaking news, Intel, you name it.
[59:32.120 --> 59:34.360]  And so now I ask you more than ever
[59:34.360 --> 59:37.720]  to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos,
[59:37.720 --> 59:40.120]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[59:40.120 --> 59:42.000]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up
[59:42.000 --> 59:47.000]  for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[59:47.160 --> 59:50.160]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[59:50.160 --> 59:55.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:58.440 --> 1:00:03.440]  The year is 1995
[1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:07.520]  and InfoWars launches the last
[1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:10.360]  of America's counter-globalist probes.
[1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:14.360]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones
[1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:17.520]  are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit
[1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:20.320]  which freezes his life support systems
[1:00:20.320 --> 1:00:24.920]  and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:27.600]  Transdimensionally, over the space time continuum
[1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:28.760]  through full space.
[1:00:28.760 --> 1:00:31.000]  Where people are extremely lazy,
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.080]  the social engineers are there laughing.
[1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:36.280]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago
[1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:37.920]  is now real.
[1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:41.320]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic,
[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:43.720]  not knowing how to be men and women run around frantic,
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:44.560]  not knowing how to be women.
[1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:47.480]  And they don't understand that it's an animating
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:51.120]  contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:53.120]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:57.080]  It's fulfilling InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[1:00:58.920 --> 1:01:00.920]  All right, let me take some time out here
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:03.960]  to just explain something to listeners
[1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:05.720]  who've been listening a long time.
[1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:07.240]  I tend to repeat a lot of things
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:09.680]  even though I have hundreds of riveting videos
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:12.200]  and articles that are all incredibly important.
[1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:14.520]  And if I was just trying to entertain people,
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:16.240]  I could make the show a lot more entertaining.
[1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:17.560]  In fact, I ought to one day a week
[1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:19.400]  call it entertainment news.
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:20.680]  And by that, it'll be real news,
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:22.960]  but the stuff that's I think most interesting,
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:25.360]  like people shooting home intruders
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:27.400]  and a guy trying to acid attack people
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:28.920]  getting beat up by vigilantes.
[1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:30.960]  And just every five minutes,
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:33.720]  some riveting incredible stuff, I could do that all day.
[1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:37.840]  But instead, I strategically,
[1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:40.440]  like it's a wartime emergency report,
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:44.280]  try to leverage you, the incredible audience to,
[1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:47.640]  hey, Congress doesn't understand there's a vacuum.
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:50.400]  And China and the unelected EU
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:51.640]  are both coming into that
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:53.120]  and taking control of regulation
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:55.200]  because they can put massive pressure
[1:01:55.200 --> 1:01:57.560]  on US-based companies to move there
[1:01:57.560 --> 1:01:59.120]  and to roll over to them
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:00.640]  and to shut everybody down, that's happening.
[1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:03.040]  So it'd be like saying,
[1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:05.280]  oh, Lockheed Martin's a private company.
[1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:07.880]  Well, this is a really important part.
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:09.720]  I'll add this to the earlier video.
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:12.520]  I'm gonna add this to both reports.
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:13.960]  We just did live that I'm gonna put up later
[1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:15.760]  and send to Congress, let's add this point.
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:17.640]  You know, Congress, they keep saying,
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:18.920]  oh, we're private companies,
[1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:20.480]  let us censor all the conservatives
[1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:22.920]  and not let Republicans run ads on our platforms
[1:02:22.920 --> 1:02:24.040]  and all this crazy stuff.
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:25.760]  But if Lockheed Martin,
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:28.120]  that builds a lot of our secret spacecraft
[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:29.600]  and weapons systems and the rest of it,
[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:31.840]  if they said, hey, we're a private company,
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:33.080]  we can do whatever we want,
[1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:36.120]  we're gonna give China everything we've got.
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:38.520]  We're gonna give them our hundred killer satellites.
[1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:42.360]  We're gonna give them our supersonic missiles.
[1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:43.720]  We're gonna give them our avionics.
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:45.160]  We're gonna give them the codes
[1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:47.680]  so they can run all of our GPS satellites.
[1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:51.360]  Congress would laugh at you.
[1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:53.080]  But they've been taken
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:56.640]  to all the heritage foundation dinners and stuff and taught.
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:02:58.720]  China having a hundred percent tariff on us
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:01.040]  or Canada, 280%, that's free market.
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:03.840]  And well, Google and Apple and Twitter and Facebook,
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:05.160]  they're all free companies.
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:08.280]  So they're allowed to censor whoever they want
[1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:11.200]  and then throw the election for the Democrats.
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:13.880]  They are national security infrastructure.
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:15.600]  They said they were infrastructure.
[1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:18.360]  They told to get Obama to pass all those laws
[1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:21.080]  three years ago to give them immunity
[1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:22.360]  that they were a public utility.
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:24.160]  We all had a right to the internet.
[1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:27.800]  And now they've used that combine,
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:29.640]  that cartel of monopolies.
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:33.360]  The worst constellation, oligopoly combines.
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:34.520]  Now read your history books
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:37.880]  to openly try to bar everybody from the marketplace.
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:39.880]  So again, oh, is it free market?
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:44.880]  That Boeing can just give all its secrets away to China.
[1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:49.040]  Or how about the other defense contractors?
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:53.840]  And you'd be like, no, that's insane.
[1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:56.920]  How did we allow the same law firm that sued Remington,
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:03:59.760]  our oldest firearm company out of business
[1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:03.560]  that's suing me with the same Sandy Hook parents?
[1:04:03.560 --> 1:04:07.160]  How did Congress, how did the government allow Remington
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:10.440]  that makes the 308 rifles used by our snipers
[1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:11.480]  to be bankrupted?
[1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:13.640]  How do we allow our critical infrastructure?
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:18.440]  How do we allow our last lead smelting mine
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:20.960]  in Colorado five years ago to close?
[1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:23.080]  So China has all of the lead smelting.
[1:04:23.080 --> 1:04:26.720]  We can't even produce bullets in this country.
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:30.280]  We have to buy it from China and then put the jackets on them.
[1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:37.280]  We have been strategically sabotaged and it needs to stop.
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:39.800]  It's unbelievable, it's so obvious.
[1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:42.320]  Oh, private company, you know what?
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:44.280]  Let all these defense contractors,
[1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:46.360]  let all these companies, you know, give all our secrets away.
[1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:47.680]  Well, they're a private company, no.
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:49.640]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break
[1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:52.400]  with a ton of critical news and information.
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:54.120]  Please, however you're watching, spread the links.
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:55.280]  They're trying to shut us down.
[1:04:55.280 --> 1:04:56.280]  They can't stop you.
[1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:00.960]  I want to plow into all of this.
[1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:03.760]  But I'm going to spend a few minutes here first,
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:05.640]  just encouraging listeners to understand
[1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:09.920]  that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
[1:05:09.920 --> 1:05:14.920]  or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com,
[1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:18.160]  you are funding the revolution.
[1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:20.240]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:23.120]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products
[1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:24.280]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:24.280 --> 1:05:25.400]  I don't want to thank everybody that has,
[1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:27.720]  but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:30.440]  with colloidal silver and with high quality
[1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:31.520]  atomic iodine in it.
[1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:33.920]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:36.560]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones,
[1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:39.280]  that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well,
[1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:43.720]  infowarslife.com or AAA2533139.
[1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:46.320]  And your purchase of the products stands with us,
[1:05:46.320 --> 1:05:48.000]  stands with America, stands with Trump,
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:49.360]  stands against the globalists
[1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:51.000]  and their satanic pedophile armies.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:53.600]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are
[1:05:53.600 --> 1:05:54.760]  and they're coming back against us
[1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:55.760]  so we need your support.
[1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:07.720]  This message is transmitted at the request
[1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:10.360]  with the President of the United States of America
[1:06:10.360 --> 1:06:12.440]  and the Office of Homeland Security.
[1:06:12.440 --> 1:06:14.240]  In compliance with the United Nations,
[1:06:14.240 --> 1:06:15.960]  the President of the United States
[1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:17.760]  has declared martial law.
[1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:19.480]  Curfew is now in place.
[1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:21.040]  Return to your homes.
[1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:23.400]  Any congregating with two or more people outside
[1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:27.880]  of your homes will result in you being arrested on site.
[1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:30.440]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:06:30.440 --> 1:06:32.680]  you are the resistance.
[1:06:32.680 --> 1:06:35.080]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:43.800]  You know when Sadiq Khan, the Islamist mayor
[1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:48.720]  of London got elected two years ago,
[1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:53.200]  the first thing he did was ban images of women in swimwear
[1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:55.240]  on government billboards and property.
[1:06:55.240 --> 1:06:57.360]  And in London, the city of London
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:06:59.440]  and also the Queen of England owns
[1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:00.640]  some of the city of London,
[1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:02.760]  they make a lot of money off of billboards.
[1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:06.320]  So they sent any women in bathing suits,
[1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:08.520]  not just bikinis, that is now banned.
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:12.360]  And Paul Watson tweeted this out the other day,
[1:07:12.360 --> 1:07:14.560]  see if you can find it, tweeted out yesterday.
[1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:18.880]  It shows women in bikinis, actual ads banned in London,
[1:07:18.880 --> 1:07:23.680]  women in full bathing suits banned in London.
[1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:26.120]  There it is, Sadiq Khan moves to ban body shaming ads
[1:07:26.120 --> 1:07:28.000]  in London transport, and he did.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.960]  But Paul Watson shows what's banned.
[1:07:29.960 --> 1:07:33.040]  But then the burqa isn't women forced
[1:07:33.040 --> 1:07:37.000]  to fully cover their bodies or they get beaten,
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.080]  even killed, and of course they have their genitals
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:41.600]  cut off as well when they're young girls
[1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:42.960]  or get acid thrown on their faces.
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:44.240]  That's all wonderful.
[1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:47.400]  That's all good.
[1:07:47.400 --> 1:07:49.120]  And I have articles here out of the UK
[1:07:49.120 --> 1:07:50.920]  where their crime rates the highest ever recorded,
[1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:52.400]  worse than New York City,
[1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:55.120]  but prosecutions are at all time lows
[1:07:55.120 --> 1:07:58.200]  and they just let these people run around
[1:07:58.200 --> 1:08:00.400]  and do whatever they want.
[1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:03.400]  So that's why this is so insane,
[1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:07.440]  is that Sadiq Khan says you can't have women
[1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:09.800]  in government advertising,
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:12.760]  that is in government owned buildings,
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:17.400]  government owned buses, government owned billboards,
[1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:20.480]  you can't show women in bathing suits
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:23.240]  or men with their shirts off, I forgot that part,
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:27.000]  but we can put burqas over women's heads.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:27.840]  That's okay.
[1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:29.440]  See how sick this is?
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:30.720]  And the left's all into that.
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.880]  They're becoming like the super right wing
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:34.040]  with all the modesty stuff.
[1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:36.360]  The lady they've got named Steele,
[1:08:36.360 --> 1:08:37.320]  Pulitzer Prize winner,
[1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:39.920]  it's like being given an iron cross these days.
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:41.240]  She wrote an article about how some company
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:43.200]  had a pool part of people in bathing suits.
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:45.640]  And so the sexual harassment
[1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:47.920]  because some of the women weighed 400 pounds
[1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:48.760]  and they were embarrassed
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:51.400]  that other women were wearing bikinis.
[1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:54.880]  So that's the next level of this cult.
[1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:55.880]  Just like colleges everywhere
[1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:58.280]  are taking down images of the football players
[1:08:58.280 --> 1:09:01.160]  and muscular males off fieldhouse walls
[1:09:01.160 --> 1:09:03.000]  or like old quarterbacks that were there 20 years ago
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:06.080]  because that's threatening because the beta cuts,
[1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:07.040]  they're threatened by it.
[1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:09.520]  So it's all about those that are the victims,
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:12.200]  those that are controlled by the globalist.
[1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:14.240]  Coming together and telling us you can't say mother,
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:16.240]  you can't say father, you can't be strong.
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:17.760]  Masculinity doesn't exist.
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:20.240]  Remember that video that UT professor telling Owen Schreuer?
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:21.400]  Masculinity doesn't exist.
[1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:23.160]  Oh, sorry.
[1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:24.280]  You can't see it.
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:30.960]  You can't see it because YouTube deleted it.
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:34.880]  So let's go over the whole Islamic situation
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:37.280]  because Siddiq Khan also said,
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:41.520]  don't worry, just get used to the Islamic terror attacks.
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:45.240]  He said that a lot and in a way it's true.
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:47.680]  The acid attacks, the stabbings, the car crashes,
[1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:50.960]  the attacks, we don't even cover one out of 100 now.
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:52.720]  And it turns out, oh, this guy was from Sudan.
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:54.120]  Oh, this guy was from Somalia.
[1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:55.160]  This guy was from Iraq.
[1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:57.480]  Oh, this guy was a ISIS member
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:09:59.160]  that put women into sex slavery
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:05.360]  and now on a German street, Yazidi sex slave,
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:07.760]  right by hundreds and hundreds of ISIS men,
[1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:13.360]  trapped both in Iraq and in German exile,
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:17.120]  runs into the man that held her as a sex slave
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:21.600]  now on full welfare as a refugee.
[1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:30.240]  Can you imagine what it's like for these women?
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:35.240]  For these women, it is unbelievable.
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:40.360]  Oh, I can't even cover a tenth of this now.
[1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:43.400]  But when we do, we get banned off Twitter, Facebook,
[1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:48.400]  you name it, when they banned me off Vimeo last week,
[1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:50.880]  some little failed video thing,
[1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:53.360]  we were putting stuff out anywhere we can.
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:10:59.080]  You know, we don't lay down, we fight.
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:01.720]  We fail, we die trying.
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:03.480]  And they, I read the letter on air,
[1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:06.280]  it said, you falsely claim that an Islamic training camp
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:08.120]  had been found and that they were training,
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:10.600]  reportedly training to take on the police
[1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:11.760]  and shoot up schools.
[1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:13.680]  I mean, that was all over the nose.
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:14.920]  But just like the illegal alien
[1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:17.080]  that shot Kate Steinle in the back
[1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:18.560]  and they virtue signal to San Francisco
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:20.600]  and said, you're allowed to shoot her in the back.
[1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:24.000]  She's allowed to die in her father's arms, you go free.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:25.920]  They virtue signal the judge said,
[1:11:25.920 --> 1:11:28.400]  no, it's racist, you're black and Muslim.
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:30.240]  If you'd have been white, you wouldn't get in trouble.
[1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:32.480]  An underground giant training base
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:33.720]  with the kids telling police
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:35.480]  we're being trained to shoot up schools
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:36.600]  and people that had disappeared
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:38.040]  from different states being held there.
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:41.520]  And a three year old found dead on the property
[1:11:41.520 --> 1:11:45.560]  in underground tunnels who died in a ritual
[1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:47.480]  of torturing him, they're now reporting,
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:51.600]  to bring forth the prophet Jesus and make him be reborn.
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:56.520]  Don't worry, the local liberal government
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:12:00.720]  has brought in tens of thousands of tons of sand
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:04.160]  and is using bulldozers to cover the compound.
[1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:07.800]  And they said, if you were white,
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:10.800]  you would not be in jail if a dead three year old
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:15.200]  reportedly killed in a ritual to make him turn into Jesus.
[1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:22.560]  And they're now releasing him on $2,000 bond, $20,000.
[1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:25.520]  That means you gotta pay too, but the judge at a waiver,
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:26.640]  no money paid.
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:31.000]  Do you hear what I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:34.640]  Do you hear what I just said?
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:38.680]  I guarantee you, this would never happen,
[1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:43.680]  but let's say I knocked my wife's teeth out.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:50.040]  I would end up being in jail for a couple of weeks
[1:12:50.040 --> 1:12:52.400]  and then I'd end up getting a serious conviction.
[1:12:53.320 --> 1:12:55.320]  And then maybe serve probation.
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:59.200]  But I mean, you got a dead little kid where they say,
[1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:03.560]  we were making him become the prophet Jesus to be reborn.
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:05.040]  It was a ritual of trial.
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:07.160]  They were torturing the child reportedly for days
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:11.880]  in some whacked out supercook voodoo from New York.
[1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:14.880]  That's where these guys are from, meets Islam.
[1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:18.040]  They're all tied into the co-conspirator
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:19.800]  of the World Trade Center.
[1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:21.000]  It's all confirmed.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.240]  They believe they're Islamic royalty.
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:26.120]  They're complete loon, whacked jobs
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:31.120]  that reportedly tortured a three-year-old to death.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.440]  And the judge goes, you're being discriminated against.
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:39.160]  You may go free from your underground tunnels.
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:43.320]  Children of Linda Sorceress Mentor
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:45.880]  arrested for terrorist training camp.
[1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:47.960]  But it's okay.
[1:13:47.960 --> 1:13:52.960]  It's just like Cruz in Florida, the mass shooter.
[1:13:56.400 --> 1:13:57.480]  He'd been arrested.
[1:13:57.480 --> 1:13:58.320]  He'd threatened to kill people.
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:13:59.160]  He'd robbed people.
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:00.360]  He'd vandalized.
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:02.240]  And they said, well, his last name's Cruz.
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:04.920]  We have a new program where minorities don't go to jail
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:06.640]  the first 15 times or so.
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:08.160]  He's having a minority.
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:12.320]  Some of the last name Cruz adopted his ass.
[1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:14.400]  He was on Prozac, all those other stuff.
[1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:18.480]  It's the same story over and over again, isn't it?
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:20.160]  And they let him go and they let him do it
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:21.960]  and the police stood down yet again.
[1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:24.280]  That's the same deal.
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:25.560]  Oh, you're a black Muslim.
[1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:28.400]  Well, we found a dead tortured three-year-old
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:29.640]  in your property.
[1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:31.840]  They're like, well, we were gonna make him become Jesus.
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:35.040]  But Jesus had to go through the ritual
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:38.200]  of the catternine tails and the crucifixion.
[1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:41.360]  Oh, well, you just tortured a three-year-old to death.
[1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:45.360]  Whoa, we didn't understand.
[1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:47.640]  Let us release you immediately.
[1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:55.760]  And Governor Cuomo is on TV saying,
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:58.200]  America was never great and it will never be great.
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:14:59.040]  Close quote.
[1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:03.760]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:06.760]  And then I say, Antiva says they're coming to kill
[1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:08.680]  Congressmen and the president of their houses.
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:10.920]  They should all have rifles ready to protect themselves.
[1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:12.440]  That turns into Alex Jones is threatened
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:14.920]  to attack the media unless your whole doesn't quote me.
[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:17.240]  He just goes, Jones is coming to kill us with guns.
[1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:18.680]  I'm scared.
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:21.000]  And Jack Gorsy goes, I know, I know.
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:26.600]  Just do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:28.120]  America was never great.
[1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:29.280]  It will never be great.
[1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:31.960]  We ought to play the clips from, you know,
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:33.800]  they're based on real stuff in the Soviet Union,
[1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:35.560]  where it's like, I'm not like I was a crap hole
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:37.400]  in this horrible in red dawn.
[1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:42.200]  Can you pull up the concentration camp scene
[1:15:42.200 --> 1:15:43.760]  from red dawn where they go see their family
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:45.960]  and in the background, like, I'm not okay.
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:48.720]  It's a pigsty of filth and crap was never great.
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:50.680]  And then meanwhile, it's not red dawn, the movie,
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:52.320]  it's Governor Cuomo, the Democrats.
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:53.880]  And when he says America sucks, they go,
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:57.200]  yay, oh yes, oh.
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:15:59.760]  If you like alkaline water or know someone that does,

[1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:29.400]  to produce thyroid hormones, which

[1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:43.920]  of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber
[1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:47.200]  is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:51.720]  throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.

[1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:04.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:19.680]  It's 1159 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam
[1:20:19.680 --> 1:20:21.800]  with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:23.880]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers
[1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:25.840]  and sisters in the occupied zone.
[1:20:25.840 --> 1:20:27.880]  The chair is against the wall.
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:30.080]  The chair is against the wall.
[1:20:30.080 --> 1:20:32.080]  John has a long mustache.
[1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:34.120]  John has a long mustache.
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:37.160]  It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory.
[1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:39.880]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines,
[1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:41.200]  this is your song.
[1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:48.880]  But they took a lot of people away.
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:51.000]  People that they thought were going to make trouble for them.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:52.680]  People that had guns and things they wanted.
[1:20:52.680 --> 1:20:54.240]  They just took them away.
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:55.600]  Where?
[1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:57.680]  We had education camps that they call it.
[1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:00.400]  So where do we have to break through our kind of private idea
[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:02.720]  that kids belong to their parents, or kids
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:04.200]  belong to their families and recognize
[1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:05.720]  that kids belong to whole communities?
[1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:11.520]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:15.920]  And we need the type of camps that you all run.
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:17.120]  I mean, really.
[1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:20.520]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[1:21:20.520 --> 1:21:22.840]  Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds
[1:21:22.840 --> 1:21:25.800]  where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:27.560]  Come on, I'm a sorry citizen.
[1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:29.600]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:32.480]  What kind of a situation in the US would you see that happening?
[1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:33.920]  I mean, we've got a lot of competition
[1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:37.240]  with a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:39.520]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:42.920]  that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs
[1:21:42.920 --> 1:21:47.080]  and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:49.400]  These people are radicalized, and they
[1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:50.960]  don't support the United States.
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:53.000]  And they're disloyal to the United States.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:55.360]  It's our right and our obligation
[1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:57.680]  to segregate them from the normal community.
[1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:06.960]  This is what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:09.560]  We're building a domestic army because the government
[1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:12.000]  is afraid of its own citizens.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:15.080]  Put your gun down, really?
[1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:20.080]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:22.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.800]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:26.640]  Over it!
[1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:31.360]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots
[1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:32.240]  are not.
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:34.920]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:37.440]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:22:37.440 --> 1:22:42.160]  you are the resistance.
[1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:58.360]  I always thought folks came to take over the country,
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:22:59.920]  Americans, to stand up.
[1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:01.920]  It's not being done militarily.
[1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:03.440]  It's being done propaganda.
[1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:06.520]  On Corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:10.080]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:17.880]  So imagine the parallels of a Red Dawn and a re-education
[1:23:17.880 --> 1:23:22.400]  camp where they were showing, based on reports, what
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:24.640]  would go on in Soviet or Chinese re-education
[1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:28.080]  camps, bad-mouthing the previous system,
[1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:28.960]  the previous government.
[1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:30.360]  That's what they teach at universities.
[1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:31.560]  America sucks.
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:33.320]  It's horrible.
[1:23:33.320 --> 1:23:34.240]  It's bad.
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:36.920]  And so Cuomo and CNN and MSNBC all come out and say,
[1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:38.080]  we hate America.
[1:23:38.080 --> 1:23:39.360]  You know, America was never great.
[1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:42.720]  It's never going to be great, because you're not great.
[1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:44.920]  Because they want full control of everything.
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:46.160]  They want to overthrow it.
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:47.000]  They want to dominate it.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:49.040]  It's a classic playbook they're playing.
[1:23:49.040 --> 1:23:51.160]  So I thought we'd play a few clips just to remind folks
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:56.840]  from the original 1980s, Red Dawn, which now you see it,
[1:23:56.840 --> 1:23:58.080]  the enemy didn't come from without.
[1:23:58.080 --> 1:24:03.360]  As our founder said, the enemy came from within.
[1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:05.600]  And we've got, under the Democrats and Obama, leaked
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:06.280]  army document.
[1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:08.080]  They admitted it was real.
[1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:11.280]  That came out, what, six years ago,
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:13.720]  that Obama was training the military to confiscate guns
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:14.800]  and put Americans in camps.
[1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:17.120]  But that woke our military up.
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:19.280]  The fact that even top brass, who were globalists,
[1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:20.920]  saw that and said, we're not doing this,
[1:24:20.920 --> 1:24:24.360]  that began to get it to where info wars was so listened to.
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:26.240]  Because I was saying this on the outside,
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:28.360]  it was happening on the inside.
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:30.480]  So now we have a beachhead to take the government back.
[1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:33.720]  We're seeing the full forces of the Chai comms, the EU,
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:36.640]  Hollywood, the big banks trying to maintain control
[1:24:36.640 --> 1:24:40.400]  over America, trying to force us back into submission.
[1:24:40.400 --> 1:24:42.520]  And they'll never get away with it now.
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:44.560]  It can still get really bad.
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:46.320]  They're going to stage some false flags clearly
[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:47.840]  and blame me and blame Trump.
[1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:49.240]  That's very clear.
[1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:50.640]  But it's not going to work.
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:52.240]  This is not 1995.
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:53.560]  That dog won't hunt.
[1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:55.600]  But if I worked at one of these big tech companies
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:57.720]  or federal buildings or mainstream media,
[1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:00.160]  you need to be watching very careful.
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:02.160]  You need to be, you know, you pick up on something,
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:04.000]  you need to warn people and get out of there quickly.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.760]  Because let me tell you, right now you are,
[1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:08.800]  there's 81 days left till this election.
[1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:11.920]  And this is the most important in US history.
[1:25:11.920 --> 1:25:13.840]  Our beachhead has to be secured.
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:15.040]  And they're making their moves.
[1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:16.680]  And this is an incredible time to be alive.
[1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:18.720]  But let's play a few of these clips
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:20.840]  with the whole reeducation situation they're pushing.
[1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:22.960]  Our colleges are already reeducation camps.
[1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:23.800]  Here it is.
[1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:30.800]  This is it.
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:35.800]  Ready?
[1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:43.000]  So that's once they're in the camp.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:44.520]  We're going to go to that in a moment.
[1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:46.440]  But for congruency, first in the movie,
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:48.520]  they go into a store, they talk to the girl.
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:50.120]  That's the clip we're going to play.
[1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:51.720]  She talks about where folks went.
[1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:53.880]  Well, we're already in a digital camp.
[1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:55.640]  They've already sent the conservatives,
[1:25:55.640 --> 1:25:57.480]  the Christians, the patriots, the pro-military,
[1:25:57.480 --> 1:25:59.600]  the pro-constitution, the pro-secondment people,
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:01.120]  have already been shadow banned.
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:03.400]  Now we're being banned everywhere.
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:05.000]  And so that's how this works is,
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.440]  Matt Drudge warned two and a half years ago
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:08.960]  of drudgereport.com, God bless him.
[1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:10.720]  They was warned by high level government officials
[1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:11.920]  and a Supreme Court justice,
[1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:14.360]  the one conservative that's still around,
[1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:16.280]  and that this was all coming.
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:21.000]  And it's down here.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:22.080]  So here it is.
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:25.560]  Look, have you seen my father?
[1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:27.280]  I called, there was no answer.
[1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:29.120]  I went by the station, it was empty.
[1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:32.920]  Okay, listen.
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:33.840]  I'm going to tell you something
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:35.040]  I'm not supposed to talk about.
[1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:36.080]  Nobody is.
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:36.920]  But...
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:37.760]  No, what?
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:40.640]  But they took a lot of people away.
[1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:42.760]  People that they thought were going to make trouble for them.
[1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:44.480]  People that had guns and things they wanted,
[1:26:44.480 --> 1:26:46.000]  they just took them away.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:47.360]  Where?
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:50.480]  We education camps, that's what they call it.
[1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:51.320]  The drive-in.
[1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:52.800]  I heard they took a lot of people to...
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:53.640]  Dad?
[1:26:55.520 --> 1:26:56.360]  I pray for you.
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:02.880]  America is a warhouse where the revolutionary ideals
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:06.080]  of your war father are corrupted and sold,
[1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:09.200]  and allied by sectors of your nation.
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:12.160]  You will pass on the pledge of freedom by then,
[1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:14.640]  and won the battle and the victory
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:20.640]  of our nation for the whole world, for the power of the sea.
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:24.440]  We're going to get to some more of that here in just a moment,
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:27.320]  but you hear it right there, America is a warhouse.
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:29.960]  It's a piece of crap, it's all falling apart, blah, blah, blah.
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:31.960]  And then we keep Como instead.
[1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:33.080]  And then now you're Como,
[1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:35.520]  but instead of like America is a warhouse,
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:37.360]  it was never great, it's never going to be great.
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:40.400]  They're like, yeah, it sucks.
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:41.240]  Yeah.
[1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:44.880]  Because, you know, he said, oh, I misspoke,
[1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:47.040]  but CNN defended him, but he didn't misspoke
[1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:48.080]  because you hear them.
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:50.400]  This is their religion.
[1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:51.520]  They all feel like losers.
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:53.280]  They don't feel like they have a seat at the table.
[1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:55.080]  They want to run it all.
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:58.000]  And it's all funded by big banks that are tax exempt.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:27:59.600]  Play the clip.
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:02.640]  We're not going to make America great again.
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:04.000]  It was never that great.
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:07.440]  Yeah.
[1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:11.560]  We have not reached greatness.
[1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:14.680]  We will reach greatness
[1:28:14.680 --> 1:28:19.520]  when every American is fully engaged.
[1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:22.400]  We will reach greatness
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:27.120]  when discrimination and stereotyping against women,
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:31.440]  51% of our population is gone.
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:33.200]  That is a total psychological warfare,
[1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:35.920]  opt to turn women against community and break society.
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:37.000]  And notice he does the MPR thing
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:37.840]  when we talk to him.

[1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:04.440]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created
[1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:06.760]  the powerful MycoZX formula to help you
[1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:08.080]  combat internal yeast.
[1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:10.200]  As the years went on and more toxins
[1:30:10.200 --> 1:30:11.560]  were pumped into the environment,
[1:30:11.560 --> 1:30:14.440]  our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula
[1:30:14.440 --> 1:30:15.920]  to help support your gut health.
[1:30:15.920 --> 1:30:19.320]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula,
[1:30:19.320 --> 1:30:21.720]  a unique natural formula designed to support
[1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:24.600]  the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[1:30:44.640 --> 1:30:47.640]  that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing
[1:30:47.640 --> 1:30:48.360]  properties.

[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:19.960]  to beat back the globalists
[1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:23.120]  and to destroy their campaign of censorship
[1:32:23.120 --> 1:32:27.680]  in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:30.200]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you

[1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:57.480]  we are unstoppable.
[1:33:00.800 --> 1:33:03.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:03.880 --> 1:33:31.400]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on your mind.
[1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:36.120]  America will never, was never great.
[1:33:36.120 --> 1:33:40.480]  And it will never be great, either.
[1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:42.000]  Yay!
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.840]  We're not a cult of psychoscom.
[1:33:44.840 --> 1:33:45.800]  We're not weirdos.
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:47.440]  We're not dangerous.
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:49.160]  We love you, Cuomo.
[1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:54.480]  If you are a Christian, if you are a pro-lifer or pro-gun,
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:56.600]  get out of my state.
[1:33:56.600 --> 1:33:59.520]  Those are real quotes from two years ago.
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:03.160]  Ernie Sanders, it's up on infowars.com.
[1:34:03.160 --> 1:34:04.960]  There's a new article out.
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:07.560]  America now believes in socialism.
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:09.560]  We are going to do it.
[1:34:09.560 --> 1:34:11.960]  It is going to be good.
[1:34:11.960 --> 1:34:14.680]  I never worked a day in my life.
[1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:18.520]  I did not have a job till I was 40 years old.
[1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:20.920]  I honeymooned in the Soviet Union,
[1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:24.880]  where we could have our way with Christians.
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:27.520]  You have to understand, when you're as ugly and stupid
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:33.160]  as I am, all you want to do is screw people over.
[1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:34.480]  And I will do it.
[1:34:34.480 --> 1:34:38.520]  Don't you worry about that.
[1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:40.720]  I mean, it sounds like they've had a bigger lobotomy.
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:44.080]  Cuomo or Sanders.
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:46.280]  I mean, let's play this one more time.
[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:50.040]  America was never that great.
[1:34:50.040 --> 1:34:53.080]  It's more like, America never that great.
[1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:55.440]  And America never going to be great,
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:57.280]  because we're mean to the women.
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:34:58.400]  We put them in burkas.
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:34:59.840]  We chop off the genitals.
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:01.440]  We sell them into sex slavery.
[1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:03.560]  They have the highest rate of college education.
[1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:05.400]  They live longer than anybody else.
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:07.320]  And we're being mean to these women.
[1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:09.800]  You do what I tell you.
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:15.640]  Tell you alpha males are bad, unless it's me.
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:19.320]  Look at my baby brother.
[1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:21.920]  My baby brother on CNN.
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:26.040]  We are going to tell you, when we take the money
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:28.920]  from the Gulf states, the dictators in China
[1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:34.600]  for CNN, to put out propaganda.
[1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:36.880]  And then if info was tried to spread articles out
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:39.440]  of Germany of sex slave women that
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:43.120]  run into their ISIS captors in Germany,
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:47.520]  we are not going to allow it to be seen.
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:51.440]  Because we in start now.
[1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:55.280]  We in start of now.
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:56.960]  Let's hear from him.
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:35:58.920]  I'm not dangerous.
[1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:01.560]  Never been great, not going to be great.
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:04.080]  Here it is.
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:07.120]  We're not going to make America great again.
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:08.280]  It was never that great.
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:16.040]  We have not reached greatness.
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:23.680]  We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.
[1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:24.680]  That's good.
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:26.000]  So let me try to talk like him.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:29.160]  Let me just read an article like him.
[1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:30.960]  Like you're totally, that's how Hillary do it.
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:33.480]  She talk like, she go to Kentucky and she go,
[1:36:33.480 --> 1:36:36.680]  ah, you doing there, partner?
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:42.840]  I hate rabbits as much as I hate republicans.
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:51.600]  Daisy, Daisy, I am a howl 9,000 computer,
[1:36:51.600 --> 1:36:59.720]  programmed in Chicago, Illinois in 2001.
[1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:01.200]  Let me read it like he does.
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:02.640]  I mean, how crazy are the Democrats trying
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:05.200]  to run a reanimated corpse like Hillary?
[1:37:07.880 --> 1:37:11.240]  I'm going to read the news like Governor Cuomo.
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:26.520]  Yazidi, ex-slave, trapped both in Iraq and in German exile,
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:33.040]  runs into her sexual capital.
[1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:40.840]  But you see, that is how we end up taking care of her.
[1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:46.360]  He's putting her under Islamic control.
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:47.840]  Oh, look, they had a bunch of stabbings.
[1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:51.040]  It's up on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:53.360]  People being disemboweled during London stabbings
[1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:56.480]  for no reason, acid attacks, all the fun that's going on.
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:05.040]  But again, we shouldn't be talking about all that.
[1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:07.200]  Look at this.
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:09.480]  China police detained man for asking,
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:11.760]  why can't Taiwan be called Taiwan?
[1:38:15.040 --> 1:38:16.840]  But don't worry, they're going to run your internet.
[1:38:16.840 --> 1:38:20.520]  So everything's OK.
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:24.120]  Let's go into just a small portion of the Islamic love
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:26.960]  we're facing today.
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:29.520]  So you've got the Yazidi sex slave meeting your captor.
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:32.080]  We're going to play that in a minute.
[1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:43.240]  Mother of two, listen to this, mother of two
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:47.680]  looked like an acid attack victim after ditching steroids.
[1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:49.360]  That's an interesting story that they've
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:53.560]  mixed in the middle of my acid attack stack.
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:54.480]  There it is.
[1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:57.440]  Acid attack survivor Sue's ex-boyfriend
[1:38:57.440 --> 1:38:59.960]  for compensation in Germany.
[1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:01.640]  It's a nice little Islamic thing to do,
[1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:03.520]  but the media never says it.
[1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:09.760]  Turkey's economic collapse could send millions of migrants
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:12.840]  into Europe, analysts warn.
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:14.920]  And he's threatening, give me everything I want.
[1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:17.280]  Let me have my own Islamic party to control Europe,
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:19.360]  or I'll flood you with Islamists.
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:21.880]  But either way, they're going to do it.
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:25.560]  UK's criminal prosecutions at record low despite crime
[1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:27.800]  near all time high.
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:32.440]  That's an article upon infowars.com for one on Telegraph.
[1:39:32.440 --> 1:39:36.040]  Prosecutors have reached an all time low despite crime
[1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:37.240]  soaring in a new record.
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:40.320]  High official government figures reveal the number of people
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:43.600]  dealt with by criminal justice system in England and Wales
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:46.680]  fell 7% in the last year, while record crime
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:53.720]  shot up 11% to 5.5 million, mainly acid attacks and stabbings.
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:55.040]  Oh, I never even covered this.
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:59.760]  So you guys print me again, the liberals from DC, husband
[1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:02.440]  and wife, who of course worked for the government
[1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:04.080]  mainstream media.
[1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:06.240]  And then they said, there is only love in the world.
[1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:07.840]  Islam loves us.
[1:40:07.840 --> 1:40:09.720]  So they went on a bike trip to the Middle East
[1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:11.760]  and then to Central Asia.
[1:40:11.760 --> 1:40:14.360]  And they were in Tajikistan, only a few days.
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:17.800]  Her, and it's really a European writer, liberals.
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:19.840]  And a truckload, because they literally
[1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:22.440]  posted it, of Islamists ran them over
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:25.160]  and then stabbed them to death, and there's
[1:40:25.160 --> 1:40:29.120]  actual video of it, as they begged for their lives saying,
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:29.760]  we love you.
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:30.760]  We love you.
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:32.320]  And they stabbed them to death.
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:32.920]  There it is.
[1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:34.880]  Millennial couple bikes through ISIS territory
[1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:39.160]  to prove humans are kind and yet killed.
[1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:42.040]  So I mean, these are well-meaning people, man,
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:43.280]  but they are in a cult.
[1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:46.000]  They think churches are bad.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:47.200]  They think guns are bad.
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:49.160]  They think America's bad, on average.
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:50.360]  They're like, Como.
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:54.960]  America would never wait, never will be great.
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:59.320]  But Tajikistan is great until you ride your bike
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:02.840]  to Tajikistan and you know what happened.
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:05.240]  They run you over, and as you beg for your life
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:08.200]  or they've already hit you and two other cyclists,
[1:41:08.200 --> 1:41:10.240]  six men get out of the car screaming
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:17.520]  death to non-believers and stab you to death.
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:19.640]  And that's just like all the liberal websites.
[1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:21.440]  You're like, no, no, no, no.
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:22.640]  Islam is a religion of peace.
[1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:25.960]  It's a wondrous thing.
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:33.360]  Meanwhile, all the usual suspects have fled Europe
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:34.800]  and come here.
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:36.200]  You know, the big Formula One owners,
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:38.040]  spoiled rotten daughters, they've left Europe.
[1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:40.200]  They've left England, said the crime rate's too high.
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:41.760]  It's a hellhole.
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:44.720]  You've got all these other big movie stars that were in Europe.
[1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:45.640]  They said, oh my god, the crime's you,
[1:41:45.640 --> 1:41:46.840]  however, we're moving to the US.
[1:41:46.840 --> 1:41:48.480]  I mean, you understand what the Middle East is like
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:55.000]  or North Africa, it is bunker cuckoo land.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:56.640]  You know, like in Star Trek, the Klingons
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:41:57.680]  have women as slaves.
[1:41:57.680 --> 1:41:58.720]  They're like on chains.
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:41:59.800]  It's like that's terrible.
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:03.320]  That's what the mainline Muslims did.
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:03.960]  But you like it.
[1:42:03.960 --> 1:42:05.800]  It's kind of like all the, you know,
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:08.000]  Islamist food places and hookah bars
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.480]  are the coolest places for the girls.
[1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:12.360]  And the coolest thing is you get an Islamist's boyfriend
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:15.120]  until they get on an airplane with them
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:18.320]  and fly the Middle East and never leave sex slavery.
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:20.360]  It turns out your so-called husband already married six women.
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:21.840]  They flew back for sex slavery.
[1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:23.000]  But it's so trendy.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.560]  You're like, oh my god, so trendy, so trendy.
[1:42:25.560 --> 1:42:30.880]  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:33.840]  Failed politics, scandals, migrant violence,
[1:42:33.840 --> 1:42:37.360]  St. Macron, authorities destroyed a Mexican compound
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:39.800]  where Islamist's trained kids carried out school shootings
[1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:42.280]  in the dead body of a reportedly tortured to death
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:44.880]  little three-year-old was found, who died in a ritual
[1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:46.720]  to make him come out as the Christ.
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:51.640]  And the judge said, hey, just like the illegal alien
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:53.720]  shot the woman in the back, he gets to go free,
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:55.400]  they're like, hey, you want torture cut to death?
[1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:58.080]  Hey, come on, have a good time.
[1:42:58.080 --> 1:43:00.760]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout

[1:43:58.520 --> 1:43:59.880]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[1:43:59.880 --> 1:44:03.680]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a straw man,
[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:06.200]  then sue us to add credibility to that,
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:09.160]  then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook
[1:44:09.160 --> 1:44:13.200]  with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:17.240]  And then voila, two weeks later ban InfoWars completely
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:21.040]  off of dozens of major platforms where we were all
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:24.280]  in the top five or top 10 news feeds.

[1:46:56.120 --> 1:47:06.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:20.120]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:23.120]  I can always be down.
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:25.120]  This little mural hacker.
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:32.120]  He left his living in cheap hotels.
[1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:34.120]  The desert's quiet.
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:36.120]  Cleveland's cold.
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:40.120]  And so the story ends with Ronald.
[1:47:40.120 --> 1:47:42.120]  I don't need your prayers.
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:44.120]  It's true.
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:48.120]  Just think of you for left it to.
[1:47:48.120 --> 1:47:52.120]  He only did what he had to do.
[1:47:52.120 --> 1:48:09.120]  And now he's grown old.
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:13.120]  Let's go ahead and get right to the news.
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:18.120]  I remember like 22 years ago having dinner
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:20.120]  with General Benton K. Parton,
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:22.120]  the head of Air Force Development,
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:24.120]  and then later the head of the Air Force
[1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:26.120]  and the head of HAARP
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:28.120]  and the head of secret space programs.
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:30.120]  I mean, you name it.
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:32.120]  This guy knew everything.
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:34.120]  And I remember him saying,
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:36.120]  nothing matters but the communist program.
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:38.120]  And he goes, and it's funded by big banks.
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:40.120]  John Burke Society, it's all accurate.
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:44.120]  I've been there. I've seen it.
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:46.120]  And he said, the number one thing
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:48.120]  communists want is to get rid of the death penalty
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:50.120]  because they know once there's a revolution
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:52.120]  they can get their people out of prison.
[1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:54.120]  And the number one thing they want to do
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:56.120]  is if they can't do that,
[1:48:56.120 --> 1:48:58.120]  they will let leftist off for murders
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:49:00.120]  and their protected groups before the uprising
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:02.120]  and it's a signal.
[1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:04.120]  And he talked about how they would go in,
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:06.120]  take over one country, suck it dry,
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:08.120]  exploit it to domino against the next.
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:10.120]  There I was like, you know,
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:12.120]  sitting at Lubies in Waco
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:14.120]  just giving a speech at an event
[1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:16.120]  where they've been for like two hours,
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:18.120]  two hours and a half.
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:24.120]  And again, that guy was traveling around the country
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:26.120]  to talk to groups of 100, 200, 300.
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:28.120]  He's been every dime he had
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:30.120]  doing it on his own dime.
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:32.120]  Fast forward
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:34.120]  to the shooter at Parkland.
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:36.120]  He'd been arrested for vandalism,
[1:49:36.120 --> 1:49:38.120]  for robbery,
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:40.120]  for threatening to kill people at least 15 times.
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:42.120]  The police had been out to his place 30 plus times.
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:44.120]  The FBI had been called
[1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:46.120]  more than 10 times,
[1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:48.120]  but there was part of a promise program
[1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:50.120]  because he had the last name Cruz.
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:52.120]  He was a white kid.
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:54.120]  He was protected
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:56.120]  because Hispanics,
[1:49:56.120 --> 1:49:58.120]  Cuban Americans had adopted him
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:00.120]  but both of them had died.
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:04.120]  So this white,
[1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:06.120]  crazy person
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:08.120]  gets a virtue signal.
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:12.120]  He was known as the school shooter.
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:14.120]  That's how he got his attention
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:16.120]  around threatening girls when bang, bang, you're dead.
[1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:18.120]  The police stood down that day,
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:20.120]  but look at this.
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:22.120]  Undocumented immigrant acquitted in Kate's timely death
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:24.120]  admits he shot her in the back
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:26.120]  as she was out having at her lunch
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:28.120]  with her father.
[1:50:28.120 --> 1:50:30.120]  She died in her father's arms.
[1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:34.120]  But look at the Democrat
[1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:36.120]  in the photo of your TV viewers
[1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:38.120]  smiling with pleasure
[1:50:38.120 --> 1:50:40.120]  because it's a virtue signaling ritual.
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:42.120]  He had a guy go that admits he shot her
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:44.120]  in the back
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:46.120]  with no conviction,
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:48.120]  no parole.
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:50.120]  I mean, my God, folks,
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:52.120]  you'd get more trouble if you got caught
[1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:54.120]  drinking and driving.
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:58.120]  He'd been deported
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:00.120]  four times at all these other convictions,
[1:51:00.120 --> 1:51:02.120]  but they let him go
[1:51:02.120 --> 1:51:04.120]  even though he squared up that revolver
[1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:06.120]  and right there in the back.
[1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:08.120]  But see,
[1:51:08.120 --> 1:51:10.120]  you see that once you go out,
[1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:12.120]  but no, I see it all the time
[1:51:12.120 --> 1:51:14.120]  in Europe and the UK
[1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:16.120]  and here in Australia.
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:18.120]  Look at this article.
[1:51:18.120 --> 1:51:20.120]  It's up on infowars.com. It's got links.
[1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:22.120]  Paul Joseph Watson, the Associated Press.
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:24.120]  The son
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:26.120]  of the imam, the unindicted co-conspirator
[1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:28.120]  famous for the first
[1:51:28.120 --> 1:51:30.120]  World Trade Center bombing,
[1:51:30.120 --> 1:51:32.120]  his son
[1:51:32.120 --> 1:51:34.120]  reportedly runs off with a three-year-old
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:36.120]  a year ago
[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:38.120]  that's a missing person kidnapped.
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:40.120]  Those reports are filed. The kids
[1:51:40.120 --> 1:51:42.120]  sometimes get calls out
[1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:44.120]  to families saying, get me out of here, it's hellish.
[1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:46.120]  14 children,
[1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:48.120]  12 of them trained to shoot people,
[1:51:48.120 --> 1:51:50.120]  reportedly.
[1:51:50.120 --> 1:51:52.120]  I know this has already been in the news, but now that they're going to be released,
[1:51:52.120 --> 1:51:54.120]  the judge has ordered it.
[1:51:54.120 --> 1:51:56.120]  No money paid, $20,000 bond,
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:51:58.120]  but she waived it.
[1:51:58.120 --> 1:52:04.120]  It's a signature bond.
[1:52:04.120 --> 1:52:06.120]  The lawyers get up, Democrat lawyers
[1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:08.120]  and they go, if they were white
[1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:10.120]  or they were Christian, their children would not be taken
[1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:12.120]  and they would not be in jail.
[1:52:12.120 --> 1:52:14.120]  You're out in a compound with tunnels, middle of nowhere,
[1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:16.120]  and the kids tell
[1:52:16.120 --> 1:52:18.120]  people calling, help us, we're starving
[1:52:18.120 --> 1:52:20.120]  there's no water, they're training us to kill people.
[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:22.120]  That's on record, that's on record
[1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:26.120]  that the prosecutors are brought forward.
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:28.120]  If you're black, purple, polka-dotted, Christian, Muslim, whatever,
[1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:30.120]  your ass is under the jail.
[1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:32.120]  There's a three-year-old
[1:52:32.120 --> 1:52:34.120]  dead
[1:52:34.120 --> 1:52:36.120]  in their statements in a ritual
[1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:38.120]  where they had to, I guess,
[1:52:38.120 --> 1:52:40.120]  the way this weird ass stuff works
[1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:42.120]  was torture him to make Jesus come out.
[1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:46.120]  That's what's being reported.
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:48.120]  I don't care how the three-year-old died.
[1:52:48.120 --> 1:52:50.120]  You got a dead three-year-old
[1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:52.120]  in your property that's missing from another state,
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:54.120]  been dead for over a year
[1:52:58.120 --> 1:53:00.120]  and just like no neighbors called
[1:53:00.120 --> 1:53:02.120]  on the San Bernardino husband and wife
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:04.120]  that went to the Christmas party to kill Christians and Jews
[1:53:04.120 --> 1:53:06.120]  and killed a bunch of people,
[1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:08.120]  their neighbors said, well, they were making bombs
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:10.120]  and they were saying they were going to kill everybody,
[1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:12.120]  but we didn't want to be politically incorrect.
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:14.120]  And the feds that investigated them two years before
[1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:16.120]  were under judicial review
[1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:18.120]  and almost indicted for religious persecution
[1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:20.120]  because they had them under investigation
[1:53:20.120 --> 1:53:22.120]  for going to Pakistan
[1:53:22.120 --> 1:53:24.120]  and going to Saudi Arabia at terrorist
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:26.120]  training camps.
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:30.120]  Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:32.120]  So authorities destroyed
[1:53:32.120 --> 1:53:34.120]  New Mexico compound where Islamists
[1:53:34.120 --> 1:53:36.120]  has trained kids to carry out school shootings, reportedly.
[1:53:36.120 --> 1:53:38.120]  That's on infowars.com. It says right here
[1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:40.120]  from the Associated Press
[1:53:42.120 --> 1:53:44.120]  on Thursday, authorities
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:46.120]  found the decomposing body
[1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:48.120]  of the three-year-old Abdul
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:50.120]  Gawan Wahan
[1:53:50.120 --> 1:53:52.120]  who was killed in a religious ritual
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:54.120]  by his father, Sir Ja'a
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:56.120]  Ayan Wahajan,
[1:53:56.120 --> 1:53:58.120]  the son of the famous New York Imam
[1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:00.120]  who was also identified as a coconut
[1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:02.120]  spirit or the 93 World Trade Center bombing.
[1:54:02.120 --> 1:54:04.120]  The suspects hoped that the boy
[1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:06.120]  would be resurrected
[1:54:06.120 --> 1:54:08.120]  as Jesus
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:12.120]  and help the group target
[1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:14.120]  corrupt institutions and people.
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:16.120]  Now, I looked up this weird, super strange
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:18.120]  angle of Islam that ties into
[1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:20.120]  voodoo and stuff, and this is what
[1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:22.120]  the best investigators believe. He was tortured
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:24.120]  to death, catternined
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:26.120]  tailed, crucified
[1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  the body was almost unidentifiable.
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:30.120]  That's what this ritual is.
[1:54:30.120 --> 1:54:32.120]  I looked it up.
[1:54:32.120 --> 1:54:34.120]  This three-year-old
[1:54:34.120 --> 1:54:36.120]  was tortured like Christ,
[1:54:36.120 --> 1:54:38.120]  reportedly. Catternined
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:40.120]  tailed, crucified
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:44.120]  bound in an underground
[1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:46.120]  tomb to rise as Christ.
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:50.120]  And these people
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:52.120]  are being released!
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:56.120]  America was never great.
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:54:58.120]  It never will be great.
[1:54:58.120 --> 1:55:00.120]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:02.120]  Oh, they all took the revolver and shot her in the back.
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:04.120]  Go free! Hell!
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:06.120]  She's white? It's okay.
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:12.120]  He died in a ritual.
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:14.120]  How did he rise again? Well, that's okay.
[1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:16.120]  They should obviously be in a lunatic
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:18.120]  asylum.
[1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:20.120]  But one thing Reagan did wrong
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:22.120]  was they did defund the state hospitals
[1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  in the early 80s
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:26.120]  and God Almighty help us.
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:28.120]  I mean,
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:30.120]  whack jobs, people.
[1:55:30.120 --> 1:55:32.120]  Total
[1:55:32.120 --> 1:55:34.120]  complete whack jobs.
[1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:38.120]  They only found the baby
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:40.120]  yesterday. Remember the early reports for her?
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:42.120]  The dead body of the child died in the
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:44.120]  affidavits. The cops filed.
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:46.120]  The state police and the local police
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:48.120]  were like, don't release them. The kids
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:50.120]  all told us and they found the dead baby!
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:52.120]  They found the dead three-year-old
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:54.120]  just like the kids told them
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:56.120]  and they're still going free!
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:06.120]  Because they're signaling to their people
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:08.120]  to whatever you want, go crazy, we're gonna let you out.
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:10.120]  They said,
[1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:12.120]  the left wants to release all the criminals to go wild.
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:14.120]  I'm like, roll in my eyes. We got too many prisons
[1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:16.120]  in general. He's like, yeah, that doesn't
[1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:18.120]  matter. How about leftist operatives?
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:22.120]  He goes, they built all the prisons
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:24.120]  to train the people, Jones.
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:26.120]  And I was like, obviously he was smart.
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:28.120]  I was young. I haven't plugged the salary.
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:30.120]  We don't find this will be shut down.
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:32.120]  It's that simple. We have a bunch of incredible
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:34.120]  products, the best fish oil, the best
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:36.120]  fish oil for your kids, honor roll, the best
[1:56:36.120 --> 1:56:38.120]  X2, brain force, fluoride free toothpaste.
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:40.120]  If everyone just goes and signs up for the toothpaste,
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:42.120]  signs up for auto-ship, additional
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:44.120]  10% off, they'll come to you each month,
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:46.120]  you'll fund the operation, we'll defeat the globalist.
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:48.120]  If not, well, unfortunately,
[1:56:48.120 --> 1:56:50.120]  nine times out of ten it is us that crash through the enemy
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:52.120]  brigades and
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:54.120]  I wish it wasn't us. I wish we had a bunch of people
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:56.120]  beside us and we were winning on every front,
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:58.120]  but we're winning because of them full wars and your support.
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:00.120]  And I'm not being arrogant about it.
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:02.120]  I'm actually, I really want to be made obsolete,
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:04.120]  man. I really, really, really do not want
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:06.120]  to be the type of spear. I don't want to march
[1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:08.120]  point anymore. I love my kids and my family, but I'm
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:10.120]  going to do it. But I need money.
[1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:12.120]  I need big fat dollar signs.
[1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:14.120]  Can you see how we're the number one enemy after
[1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:16.120]  Trump? And I don't have $9 billion.
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:18.120]  He's already spent, reportedly, a billion and a half
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:20.120]  dollars of his own money in the lawsuits and the filings
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:22.120]  and everything. He's already lost a billion and a half
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:24.120]  dollars. God bless him. I'm ready to lose everything I
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:26.120]  got. I don't give a damn about money. I use it
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:28.120]  as the fuel to be independent. I need money

[1:58:48.120 --> 1:58:50.120]  The scientists at Impholwars Life
[1:58:50.120 --> 1:58:52.120]  have created a powerful formula for
[1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:54.120]  inflammatory support and joint support.
[1:58:54.120 --> 1:58:56.120]  Discover the power of ancient
[1:58:56.120 --> 1:58:58.120]  medicine with bodies.
[1:58:58.120 --> 1:59:00.120]  Bodies contains one of the most potent
[1:59:00.120 --> 1:59:02.120]  forms of turmeric available.
[1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:04.120]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years
[1:59:04.120 --> 1:59:06.120]  and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:08.120]  It is well known in traditional medicine
[1:59:08.120 --> 1:59:10.120]  for exuding properties.
[1:59:10.120 --> 1:59:12.120]  Our pure turmeric extract plus
[1:59:12.120 --> 1:59:14.120]  peppering from black pepper makes for
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:16.120]  optimal absorption to help boost and support

[1:59:28.120 --> 1:59:30.120]  contains over 95%
[1:59:30.120 --> 1:59:32.120]  of the active ingredients. Bodies

[1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:36.120]  herbs such as spearmint, sage,
[1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:38.120]  lemon balm, and thyme
[1:59:38.120 --> 1:59:40.120]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[1:59:56.120 --> 1:59:58.120]  So when your wife says,
[1:59:58.120 --> 2:00:00.120]  Alex, please pass the potatoes.
[2:00:00.120 --> 2:00:02.120]  What does Elon Musk say? He says,
[2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:04.120]  I've been at the big corporate board rooms
[2:00:04.120 --> 2:00:06.120]  where they say humanity will be
[2:00:06.120 --> 2:00:08.120]  obsolete by 2015.
[2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:10.120]  This is the consensus at Google and Facebook
[2:00:10.120 --> 2:00:12.120]  and Twitter. I mean, this is what,
[2:00:12.120 --> 2:00:14.120]  this is the plane and we're going to
[2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:16.120]  make machines become gods. But first
[2:00:16.120 --> 2:00:18.120]  we've got to reduce the world
[2:00:18.120 --> 2:00:20.120]  population 90%. Well, they're
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:22.120]  the ones actually hurting the environment in most cases
[2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:24.120]  and doing all the, you know, cross-human animals
[2:00:24.120 --> 2:00:26.120]  and stuff, and just all these abominations.
[2:00:26.120 --> 2:00:28.120]  And in the media, I started to say,
[2:00:28.120 --> 2:00:30.120]  Jones is insane. There's no human animal
[2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:32.120]  hybrids. It's freaking
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:34.120]  MIT 20 years ago wrote about it.
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:36.120]  It's just, they don't roll that stuff around.
[2:00:36.120 --> 2:00:38.120]  It's like they don't show you the primate
[2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:40.120]  center in Bastrop, one of the biggest in the world
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:42.120]  where they've got every monkey and ape
[2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:44.120]  and then you've got strapped in, big computer
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:46.120]  screens, testing drugs on them,
[2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:48.120]  testing
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:50.120]  flicker rates on the screens.
[2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:52.120]  Then we get our kids filtered water
[2:00:52.120 --> 2:01:13.120]  and the dude says, look, what a coat. There's nothing in the water.
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:23.120]  You've been a messin'. Well, you shouldn't have been a messin'.
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:25.120]  And now someone else is gettin' all your best.
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  These boots are made for walkin'.
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:31.120]  And that's just what they'll do.
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:33.120]  It's pretty pathetic.
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  They have all these.
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:37.120]  Seein' in folks.
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:39.120]  Openly
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  attacking every one of our sponsors for years.
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:43.120]  Attacking publishers are going to put books out.
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:45.120]  Tortuously interfering with everything I do.
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:47.120]  Trying to shut everything down.
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:49.120]  And then
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:51.120]  they just keep lyin'.
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:53.120]  Now, crank it up.
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:55.120]  And you keep losing
[2:01:55.120 --> 2:01:57.120]  when you oughta not bet.
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:01:59.120]  That's right.
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:01.120]  You keep saying it
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:03.120]  when you oughta be a changin'.
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:05.120]  I like the part about, I just found a brand new box
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:07.120]  of matches.
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:09.120]  But you ain't been right yet.
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:11.120]  These boots are made for walkin'.
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:13.120]  And that's just what they'll do.
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:15.120]  That's just what they'll do.
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:17.120]  One of these days.
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  One of these days these boots
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:21.120]  are gonna walk all over you.
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:23.120]  And they think they're gonna win, no, they're not.
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:25.120]  Now, Sabelle Evans is gonna join us in the next segment.
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:27.120]  Former FBI, CIA translator
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:29.120]  helped break all the big news
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:31.120]  about 9-11. You name it.
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  She's coming on. She's formerly from Turkey.
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:35.120]  To break down the global,
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:37.120]  is trying to sabotage relations with Turkey
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  to have a big international disaster
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:41.120]  for Trump.
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:43.120]  They've been trying to sabotage the peace deal
[2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:45.120]  with North Korea. You name it.
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:47.120]  She's with Newsbud.
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:49.120]  That's gonna be comin' up
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:51.120]  in the next segment with Herb.
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:53.120]  And so much more
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:55.120]  that we're gonna be getting into.
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:57.120]  Some of the other news I haven't gotten into
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:02:59.120]  will also get in with Herb.
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:01.120]  The way the media acts like
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:03.120]  John Brennan's having his free speech taken.
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:05.120]  John Brennan
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:07.120]  deserves his national security clearance.
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:09.120]  He says, kill the president. He's a traitor.
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:11.120]  He's using his national security
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:13.120]  clearance to talk to people in government
[2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:15.120]  to then get classified info and then spin it.
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:17.120]  John Brennan
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  lied to Congress and said that not one
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:21.120]  civilian was killed in drone strikes by Obama.
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.120]  His other
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  clapper, his other
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:27.120]  supporter, former head of the
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:29.120]  Office of National Security,
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:31.120]  the group that manages all the security
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:33.120]  agencies, the Office of
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:35.120]  National Intelligence.
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:37.120]  What's the name of that? I can't keep track
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:39.120]  of all the 17 agencies. It's the top agency.
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:41.120]  The Office of National Intelligence
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:43.120]  famously told Congress that
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:45.120]  no one's ever been
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:47.120]  spot on the U.S. by the NSA.
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:49.120]  I mean, these people are a joke.
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:51.120]  So they're saying to us that
[2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:53.120]  they're
[2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:55.120]  doing all of this and it's just
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:57.120]  completely insane. They're saying that Trump
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:03:59.120]  is bad because he pulled his national security
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:01.120]  clearance. It's all just
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:03.120]  like, anyways, to say this guy
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:05.120]  is not an American. This guy is a
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:07.120]  mentally ill monster
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:09.120]  who was brought into this because he's
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:11.120]  all part of subverting and
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:13.120]  parasiting and taking the country over
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:15.120]  for corrupt aims.
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:17.120]  I mean, John Brennan is a famously corrupt person
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:19.120]  who joined the Communist Party,
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:21.120]  voted for it when he was an adult.
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:23.120]  He's just a saboteur
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:25.120]  and in my
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:27.120]  view, he's a very, very monstrous individual. Plus, he
[2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:29.120]  watched a video the way he walks around
[2:04:29.120 --> 2:04:31.120]  and scared him. He was like
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:33.120]  I'm John Brennan.
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:35.120]  I'll screw America over. Obama loves
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:37.120]  me. So's
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:39.120]  Romaniel.
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  Thoros likes me. I'm John Brennan.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:43.120]  He's scared of me.
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:45.120]  Now, some people aren't scared of you.
[2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:47.120]  Some people aren't scared of you, Brennan.
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:57.120]  We knew it was coming.
[2:04:57.120 --> 2:04:59.120]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[2:04:59.120 --> 2:05:01.120]  First demonize Info Wars, lie about us,
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:03.120]  build a straw man, then
[2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:05.120]  sue us to add credibility to that,
[2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:07.120]  then have a few fake strikes on YouTube
[2:05:07.120 --> 2:05:09.120]  and Facebook with nebulous terms
[2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:11.120]  like bullying children and
[2:05:11.120 --> 2:05:13.120]  Islamophobia. And then wallah.
[2:05:13.120 --> 2:05:15.120]  Two weeks later, ban Info Wars
[2:05:15.120 --> 2:05:17.120]  completely off of dozens
[2:05:17.120 --> 2:05:19.120]  of major platforms where
[2:05:19.120 --> 2:05:21.120]  we were all in the top 5
[2:05:21.120 --> 2:05:23.120]  or top 10 news feeds.
[2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:25.120]  Go to

[2:05:33.120 --> 2:05:35.120]  It's also critical to go to

[2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:41.120]  stay in contact with you and send you videos

[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:45.120]  you want to do, tell folks about
[2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:47.120]  InfoWars.com.
[2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:49.120]  How they can download the free Android
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:51.120]  and iPhone apps. How they can then
[2:05:51.120 --> 2:05:53.120]  reach out to others with the information
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:55.120]  and point out this is the verboten info.
[2:05:55.120 --> 2:06:23.120]  I don't want you to see.
