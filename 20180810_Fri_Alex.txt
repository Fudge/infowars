[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:25.000 --> 00:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday Global Transmission.
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.000]  Hard to believe it's already the 10th day of August 2018.
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours on 1818.
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  Okay, let's lay out what's happening right now.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  China is the most bloodthirsty, murderous authoritarian regime in planetary history,
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  killing conservatively over 100 million of their own people.
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  The Rockefellers and others by the 60s began a program to build them up against the U.S.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  to actually help put them in power in 1949.
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  That is a historical fact.
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  They are now in control of Google to a great extent, in complete control of Apple.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  Apple is now state run.
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  They are implementing a purge not just against Info Wars, but against everyone else.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  In fact, it's all over the news that their next target is Stephen Crowder,
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  and they list a bunch of other mainline popular conservatives, particularly with young people.
[01:51.000 --> 02:00.000]  Notice that three days ago, Media Matters run by George Soros said our next target is the climate deniers.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  People that don't want to pay a global carbon tax and don't think that man-made global warming is real.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  And the evidence points towards that.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  They are now being perched.
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.000]  So I told everybody they've been demonizing me for a year and a half
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  so that everyone when they went after my free speech would think, oh, that's just Alex Jones.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  And there's this evil straw man that's Alex Jones.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  And so it's okay for him to lose his free speech.
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  But now you've got Congressman Murphy and others saying, no, he's the tip of the rotting iceberg.
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  We want them all off now because they're really panicked.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  The numbers are coming in. They're going to lose the midterms currently, even with all their election fraud.
[02:41.000 --> 02:49.000]  Now, that said, China fired six shots at US Navy in the South China Sea today.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  This is China leave immediately.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  Now, that's in the Express News. It's in the BBC. Almost no coverage of this here.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  They are now in the main straight.
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  The South China Sea, with these little islands they've built, with these dredges, with missile emplacements and artillery,
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  threatening everyone saying we are in control.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  They're even saying they control part of the Philippines.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  So China is threatening to invade Taiwan.
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.000]  They're telling US airlines, you better not say Taiwan on your destination.
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  Or you can't come into the airspace and we've got fighter planes in the air.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  So China is running around being extremely out of control and aggressive.
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  But they're getting their butt kicked by Trump because they've got a $300 billion intellectual property theft
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  that's conservative $300 billion, $500 conservative billion in trade deficit with us each year.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  And Trump said, you're going to give us something back, just something.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  At least you're going to use some lubrication.
[03:51.000 --> 04:01.000]  And they said, no. So six months after the tariffs began, China is now starting to back off
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  and starting to remove some of the counter tariffs they put.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  They're like, okay, okay.
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  Trump's like, yeah, you're going to give us a couple hundred billion.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  You're going to give us something.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  I understand out in San Francisco and liberal land, pissing on America is a religion.
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  Mountain our head on the wall is all these weird leftists that got brainwashed in college that hating flower country is their religion.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  It literally is.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  But that religion is destroying the country that makes us successful.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  And you're doing it for China?
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  You talk back to the police in China.
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  The thing they do is cut your testicles off and then slit the artery right on the front of your thigh
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  and they let you bleed out on the ground.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  This dead body is just rotting here and there.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  No one takes care of old people.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  It's hell on earth in many areas.
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  But you don't care.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  You want to bring down America and have your way with it.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  It doesn't matter.
[04:54.000 --> 05:17.000]  That's why we've introduced the Info Wars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[06:54.000 --> 06:55.000]  is now complete.
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  When I left you, I was but a learner.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  Now I am the master.
[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  Only a master of evil, Darth.
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  Your power is a weak old man.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  You can't win, Darth.
[07:10.000 --> 07:32.000]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[07:32.000 --> 07:46.000]  No!
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  We are number one trending app in news.
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  Number one trending.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  Click on that for a larger image, please.
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  Number one trending.
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.000]  Guess what we are?
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  Total out of thousands of news apps.
[08:01.000 --> 08:10.000]  We are number three total in the world surpassing CNN and Fox News.
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  That was a couple days ago.
[08:14.000 --> 08:23.000]  Now we're number one in the news apps and climbing towards number one worldwide for all apps at current growth rates by next week.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  Up against apps that have been there for years and promoted on these platforms.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  They are hollow frauds.
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  We now have a bigger news app in the New York Times and CNN combined.
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.000]  And they're both lobbying as hard as they can to have those apps destroyed.
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  What will that do?
[08:42.000 --> 08:51.000]  Don't worry, Tim Cook, who's moved to China and now brought the Chinese government in to run the iCloud and all your iKeys, all your code keys.
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.000]  That's on record.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  That's why they really want me off here.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  He says, I'm being monitored.
[08:56.000 --> 09:13.000]  Oh my goodness, you're monitoring the app that is my streams and my internet and our articles that adults choose to go download and that we paid to have put in your store.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  So we can give it away for free.
[09:15.000 --> 09:23.000]  And we're dominating all the other free apps of the New York Times and CNN and you don't know what to do.
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  By the way, there's more dis info out there from CNN news and all of them.
[09:28.000 --> 09:40.000]  I noticed that seeing in the web cops, the racketeers that spend all their time trying to get everybody to platform to shut down conservative nationalist pro Trump speech ahead of the midterms.
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  I noticed yesterday they were doing reports on things out of context.
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.000]  I said about David Hogg and about Parkland and about other events and I just said delete that stuff.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  It's not even what they're twisting when I said, but just just to take the super high road, delete it.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  That turns into Twitter finally took action and took down the evil tweets of Alex Jones.
[10:02.000 --> 10:16.000]  David Hogg was wearing a literal armband and posing for its saluting with his fist up on the air calling for gun confiscation and people were calling that Nazi.
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  And I said, well, it sure looks like that, but it doesn't matter.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  The left calls people Nazis all the time.
[10:23.000 --> 10:31.000]  And that's when YouTube gave me one of the false strikes back in February was for talking about him saying you can't talk about the victim.
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.000]  David Hogg, even though he's a public figure, calling me a con man and a piece of garbage.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  I didn't call that him that.
[10:40.000 --> 10:48.000]  That show my tweets, David Hogg, I sent him respectful tweets and I said, I'd like you to come on the show since you're challenging me to a debate.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  And then he backed out of the debate.
[10:51.000 --> 11:06.000]  So they are currently trying to take me off of Twitter as everyone knows, it's one of the big national news stories.
[11:06.000 --> 11:14.000]  And they're currently trying to get us delisted off of iTunes app and off of the Android, where you go with a contract, you pay for it.
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  And then all it is is a hub for people on their devices.
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  Now you talk about monopoly practices by Android and by Apple.
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  If they try to say then you can't have an app on there on their platform.
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  That is antitrust 101.
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  And they're trying to figure out how do they get around to that?
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  How do they get that done?
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  Don't worry, we're monitoring his app.
[11:42.000 --> 11:51.000]  Just like you monitor the poor Chinese people when you report on them being Falon Gong or Christians they get taken and their organs harvested after they work in slave labor for a couple of years.
[11:51.000 --> 11:58.000]  And some rich Westerner, you know, like Steve Jobs needs a liver and we all know what happens.
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  Remember Steve Jobs said he wouldn't let his own kids play with an iPad when they first came out because it brain damages them.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  That's confirmed.
[12:06.000 --> 12:18.000]  But they'll sit up there all high and mighty with their slave factories, some of the worst in the world under Foxconn, under Apple contract with suicide nets and forced abortion and one-child policies and forced drugging.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  And that's all cute and funny, isn't it?
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  Because Apple is Chinese communist run.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  That's main stream news.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  There's more news about it today and how Google is building a total censorship system in America and in China.
[12:32.000 --> 12:41.000]  They're testing their system here on Americans.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  New listeners won't believe they have mobile suicide trucks in every town.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  New listeners won't believe they have suicide nets around Foxconn.
[12:50.000 --> 13:01.000]  Don't just show the photos, just type into the web, click web and type in suicide nets Foxconn Apple factories and then type in mobile execution vans China.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  You'll get AP, Reuters, CBS News.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  But from 10 years ago, they will not report it now because that's a big, big no-no.
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  So I have requested, and I'm going to read this statement when we come back from break.
[13:18.000 --> 13:43.000]  My statement calling for hearings in Congress and I demand respectfully that I be able to be at those hearings and be able to lay out what's really happened because I've been demonized and I've been lied about and they've done all these horrible things that I need to be able to sit there as an American as my birthright and do that.
[13:43.000 --> 13:50.000]  Now, let me tell you what's coming up after I get into that.
[13:50.000 --> 14:00.000]  China has fired six warnings at US Navy ships in the South China Sea saying this is China leave immediately when for thousands of years no one has said that they own the South China Sea.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  This is very, very aggressive.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  They're doing that because Trump is winning the trade war against them, but they were already expanding and out of control.
[14:07.000 --> 14:18.000]  Turkish lira plunges 20% versus dollar and Trump authorizes doubling metals tariffs on Turkey and their dictator said it doesn't matter.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  They have their dollars.
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  We have our God.
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  China has reversed itself on oil tariffs after they realized it would hurt them more than it would hurt us.
[14:29.000 --> 14:37.000]  All these countries have one sided tariffs on us and all Trump is doing is saying we're not even going to meet you at the level of your tariffs on us.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  He said 50 billion.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  They said no.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  He said 100 billion.
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  They said no.
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  He said 200 billion.
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]  They said no.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  He said 300 billion.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  They said no.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  He said 350 billion.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  They said whoa.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  Okay.
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  Yeah.
[14:50.000 --> 14:58.000]  See because he stood firm and the left and CNN and the New York Times all these groups trained and hired because they hate America because they're globalist collaborators.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  They can't stand to see a strong real president.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  They can't stand to see the country coming back.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  They don't know what to do.
[15:04.000 --> 15:14.000]  So they're throwing everything they've got at midterms to try to have illegal aliens vote and people vote in the names of dead peoples and they just don't know what to do.
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  They just don't know how they're going to do this.
[15:18.000 --> 15:33.000]  So now they've jumped the shark and engaged in massive censorship which shows that their censors and said in thousands of papers and universities everywhere shut Alex Jones up and shut everybody else up including U.S.
[15:33.000 --> 15:43.000]  Senators and Congresswomen are showing the horrible nightmare authoritarians they are thinking you're so stupid you won't recognize it and do something about it.
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  This is an incredible time to be alive right now an amazing time to see this battle for the republic.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  The second American Revolution goes global 1776 worldwide.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  I tried other brands but I came back to my sunshine.

[20:23.000 --> 20:32.000]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[20:32.000 --> 20:46.000]  So, in the United States of America, CNN is openly full-time lobbying to have InfoWars.com taken off the air.
[20:46.000 --> 20:53.000]  They want us kicked off every platform. They are gleefully pushing to get the number one apps taken down
[20:53.000 --> 21:02.000]  because we're number one with a three-week-old app, and they're a joke.
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  And all their billions of dollars and all the money they get from Gulf State dictators and Communist China
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.000]  and all the things they've done, people can't stand them.
[21:11.000 --> 21:18.000]  They have to pay to be on an airport and pay to be on in bars and pay to be on everywhere.
[21:18.000 --> 21:28.000]  Very offensive. I was in the Trump Hotel, beautiful, nice hotel in the old post office there in D.C. a few months ago,
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  and there was CNN on the big television over the bar. I was going to throw up.
[21:33.000 --> 21:40.000]  I just can't get away from it. It's all force-fed.
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  But everyone you know cannot stand these people, and now they're all over the news going,
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  he denied that David Hogg was a real student, never said that.
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  He says their crisis actors never said that. He says the shooting didn't happen, never said that.
[21:55.000 --> 22:03.000]  But they think if they say it enough that somehow I shot the people there instead of the government standing down,
[22:03.000 --> 22:13.000]  Nick Cruz being in one of these leftist programs where they let him off of all these different crimes
[22:13.000 --> 22:23.000]  as part of a program for, quote, minorities so that they don't get sent into the prison system.
[22:23.000 --> 22:30.000]  But he wasn't even a minority. His last name was just Cruz. He was a white kid.
[22:30.000 --> 22:35.000]  So these people are like smiling demonic jack-o'-lanterns at CNN.
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  Skelter, all of them. Up there, one minute saying Trump criticizing the press is anti-free speech.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  No, that's called free speech countering you liars. He wants to kill us.
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.000]  He wants blood, they say. He's going to cause terrorism. He's going to cause all this violence.
[22:49.000 --> 22:59.000]  Then they're calling for real violence, for uprisings, and all this other garbage.
[22:59.000 --> 23:05.000]  And then the next segment they'll call for me and others to be banned off the Internet saying we're fake news,
[23:05.000 --> 23:13.000]  when that's all objective, subjective. It's all what you see, what you think, what you research.
[23:13.000 --> 23:17.000]  So we've reached a new level. You know, I should have started the broadcast with this,
[23:17.000 --> 23:22.000]  but the China news is so huge that they're claiming all the South China Sea and firing on U.S. ships.
[23:22.000 --> 23:27.000]  It's just amazing what's happening in Turkey and the U.S. Capitol ramping up security,
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  head of white nationalist rallies, and they've got the one-year anniversary of Charlottesville coming up
[23:31.000 --> 23:38.000]  where the police corralled the alt-right people right into the antifust so the explosion could happen.
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.000]  And by Soros funding that, he's partially the blame for the poor woman that died.
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  That turned into them spinning it and saying, and I said, the CIA staged it,
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.000]  and that some photographer staged it when that's not what I said.
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  They just twisted that and sued me for that.
[23:55.000 --> 24:02.000]  And everybody knows that in Portland and in San Francisco and in Charlottesville and in Maryland,
[24:02.000 --> 24:11.000]  the police have stood down. We even have the documents in Maryland in Baltimore where the antifa was working with them
[24:11.000 --> 24:18.000]  and even had designated areas they were allowed to protest and engage in violence and even throw things at police
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  as part of an attempt to escalate the general public into rioting to bring in a civil emergency for Obama.
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  But the plan failed. Go to infowars.com or search Incident.
[24:30.000 --> 24:39.000]  2015 plan to bring in martial law for Obama.
[24:39.000 --> 24:45.000]  Document show 2015 plan to bring in civil emergency and martial law in Maryland.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  Read the documents for yourself, and that's why they want to shut down
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  because they don't want the future plans they've got coming out.
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  There it is. Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  That broke January 20th of this year. I suggest everyone read it.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  That's why they want info wars shut down. That's why they're trying to shut our servers down.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  Oh, people go, oh, it's just a private company.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  Oh, well, now we're going to have your server company shut you down.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  Oh, it's just a private company. Now you can't ride the bus or the airplane.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  This is a global China social score system of total control.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  And look, scroll back up if you're a TV viewer. Scroll back up.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  You can see that our video report documenting and has been removed. See?
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  Oh, they're scrubbing more and more and more and more.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  They're getting their job done.
[25:35.000 --> 25:42.000]  Not only is CNN a propped up, failed, anti-free speech, anti-American engine of lies
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  that murder the truth. They're now out murdering free speech
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  and murdering other people's ideas and engaged in classic racketeering
[25:51.000 --> 25:57.000]  like the brown shirts in Nazi Germany, working in concert to go around to private companies
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  and try to have us deplatformed from basic services.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  But you better bake that gay cake. Okay.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  But I don't get my electricity next, I guess.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  And here's the big enchilada. When we come back, I'm going to say it.
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  We started the show with this. This is the big, big, big issue that hit me so hard last week
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  and hit me again this morning when I was really cogitating and thinking deeply about this.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  They're going to make their move on Trump the next three months.
[26:22.000 --> 26:28.000]  They're making their move on free speech now. This is unprecedented criminality that we're witnessing
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  and that signifies that they are getting ready to make their move in a big way.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  Now, some of the things you can do to counter them.
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  Go to mfullwars.com, forward slash show. Go subscribe to our podcast directly,
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  where it's super hard for them to stop us from getting information to you.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  It's going to be critical as things unfold. They don't want us on air when all this goes down.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  They don't want us advising the president.
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  They don't want the military and the police listening, which they do.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  You've got to counter them and say, learn why they don't want you to hear Jones.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  Go directly to mfullwars.com, forward slash show.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  The Android and Apple app, it's good to be number one on news.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  It's good to be in the top 30 of all apps when it's only a three and a half week old app.
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  It sends a big message to the sensors that they're failing.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  But the number one issue is, we're only canary in the coal mine.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  They're going after everybody right now, big time.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  And they've now announced, I've got a stack of news I haven't gotten to yet,
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  where they say, get all the other conservatives now.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  Shut them all down ahead of the election.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  Our democracy depends on, it says, Senator Murphy.
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.000]  What a bizarre statement.
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  It's so in America. It's so naked. It's so, they're now banning thousands of sites
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  on Facebook and YouTube of scientists and others that criticize manmade global warming
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  and point out it's a giant global carbon tax scam.
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.000]  They're making their move, just like Europe banning criticizing radical Islam.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  It's all happening. And they're putting messages up over it in real time,
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  run by the Southern Prairie Law Center saying it's not true.
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.000]  Just punk kids that work there in control of it and put messages over climate scientists.
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  They're interposing themselves in front of our communications.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  They got rid of the comments on infowars.com.
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  They got discuss us that we'd had for seven, eight years to say, no, you're hate,
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  because we just define you as subhuman, as hate.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  That's what's hateful. So you can't have comments.
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.000]  We have our own commenting system now back on infowars.com, newswars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  But it's on their attempt to silence you ahead of a big move against Trump.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  Now, how could that unfold? What am I expecting to see?
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  I'm going to lay out the different scenarios that are all in one general path,
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  but different permutations of that on the other side.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  But currently, we are in an economic and covert military war with China.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  They've got a lot of collaborators in this country that have officially moved to China,
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.000]  like Tim Cook and like Google and Alphabet, its parent company.
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.000]  Slingbow, a new frontier in archery and truly modern twist on this primitive survival tool.
[29:26.000 --> 29:55.000]  Feel the thrill only at Slingbow.com.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  MediaHempSolutions.com. That's mediahempsolutions.com.
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.000]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[30:30.000 --> 30:35.000]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[30:35.000 --> 30:42.000]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[30:50.000 --> 30:57.000]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[30:57.000 --> 31:00.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.000]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage.
[31:04.000 --> 31:10.000]  And that's why we need you to go to the site now if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals.
[31:10.000 --> 31:20.000]  Please consider a contribution. 25, 50, 100, 250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here
[31:20.000 --> 31:25.000]  to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship
[31:25.000 --> 31:51.000]  in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[31:51.000 --> 31:56.000]  And now it's the infowars official app taken on the globalist at Point Blank Range
[31:56.000 --> 32:22.000]  with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[32:22.000 --> 32:29.000]  Thank you.
[32:52.000 --> 32:56.440]  Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and
[32:56.440 --> 33:03.600]  point out, this is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[33:03.600 --> 33:12.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:12.560 --> 33:14.680]  We are drugs out.
[33:14.680 --> 33:18.080]  We are following other people's opinions.
[33:18.080 --> 33:20.360]  We are controlled by the media.
[33:20.360 --> 33:22.760]  Today, it all changes.
[33:22.760 --> 33:25.440]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[33:25.440 --> 33:28.360]  It is a choice, just like what I said, slavery is a choice.
[33:28.360 --> 33:33.240]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[33:33.240 --> 33:36.960]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f**k you, f**k you, how are we going to get
[33:36.960 --> 33:38.760]  a different result out of hate?
[33:38.760 --> 33:41.200]  Why don't we just try love?
[33:41.200 --> 33:42.800]  Why don't we just try love?
[33:42.800 --> 33:46.760]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[33:46.760 --> 33:50.960]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy mother f**kers to change something.
[33:50.960 --> 33:53.960]  Steve Jobs is crazy, now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[33:53.960 --> 33:58.560]  They say drugs crazy, they say I'm crazy, but I'm here to show love.
[33:58.560 --> 34:03.760]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[34:03.760 --> 34:07.880]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[34:07.880 --> 34:16.920]  This is Alex Jones.
[34:16.920 --> 34:20.760]  The right-wing smitter machine has gotten Alex Jonesified this election cycle.
[34:20.760 --> 34:21.760]  The guy named Alex Jones.
[34:21.760 --> 34:22.760]  Alex Jones.
[34:22.760 --> 34:23.760]  From Info Wars.
[34:23.760 --> 34:24.760]  From Info Wars.
[34:24.760 --> 34:25.760]  Yeah.
[34:25.760 --> 34:26.760]  Alex Jones.
[34:26.760 --> 34:27.760]  Alex Jones.
[34:27.760 --> 34:30.280]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[34:30.280 --> 34:33.080]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true.
[34:33.080 --> 34:37.680]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[34:37.680 --> 34:42.480]  At Conspiracy du Jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[34:42.480 --> 34:44.680]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[34:44.680 --> 34:47.680]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's yours.
[34:47.680 --> 34:52.680]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by
[34:52.680 --> 34:57.320]  changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton's body count stories that's
[34:57.320 --> 34:58.960]  supporting a website in Fort Worth.
[34:58.960 --> 35:01.160]  And this really is just so disgusting.
[35:01.160 --> 35:04.360]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[35:04.360 --> 35:10.160]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[35:10.160 --> 35:13.160]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[35:13.160 --> 35:18.320]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind of incorporated
[35:18.320 --> 35:19.320]  into the campaign.
[35:19.320 --> 35:21.440]  If Trump gets elected, he's going to be Secretary of Defense.
[35:21.440 --> 35:23.440]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[35:23.440 --> 35:24.440]  Move, bitch!
[35:24.440 --> 35:25.440]  Get out of the way!
[35:25.440 --> 35:26.440]  Bill Clinton is a rapist at InfoWars.com.
[35:26.440 --> 35:27.440]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[35:27.440 --> 35:28.440]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[35:28.440 --> 35:35.760]  Bill Clinton is a rapist at InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com, Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[35:35.760 --> 35:41.400]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[35:41.400 --> 35:46.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[35:46.000 --> 35:54.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[35:54.920 --> 35:58.720]  You know why InfoWars is still on Twitter, but banned everywhere else?
[35:58.720 --> 36:08.720]  By Apple, by Google, by Facebook, by Spotify, by Stitcher, by WebChimp, by Disgust.
[36:08.720 --> 36:14.720]  They even have the Democrats going after our servers trying to file false reports on those
[36:14.720 --> 36:15.960]  to get our servers taken down.
[36:15.960 --> 36:17.200]  We can go down any time.
[36:17.200 --> 36:20.520]  That's what's happening in America right now.
[36:20.520 --> 36:25.280]  The only reason we're still on Twitter is because of this tweet from the President,
[36:25.280 --> 36:30.720]  Twitter, shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good.
[36:30.720 --> 36:34.440]  We will look into this discriminatory legal practice at once.
[36:34.440 --> 36:37.440]  Many complaints.
[36:37.440 --> 36:41.040]  And look, I welcome Jack Dorsey not being the vanguard of censorship like he's been
[36:41.040 --> 36:43.280]  the last few years.
[36:43.280 --> 36:44.280]  Twitter's a very interesting thing.
[36:44.280 --> 36:46.240]  He invented very, very nice.
[36:46.240 --> 36:49.360]  The problem is, is they let Democrats be as violent and threatening and out of control
[36:49.360 --> 36:50.360]  as they want.
[36:50.360 --> 36:51.360]  Islamists, you name it.
[36:51.360 --> 36:56.840]  They take us questioning David Hogg, who's in three different videos saying, I was at
[36:56.840 --> 36:57.960]  home when the shooting started.
[36:57.960 --> 37:01.600]  I rode my bike and then the shooting was over by then and then him saying he was in the
[37:01.600 --> 37:07.840]  school while the shooting's happening and I've got those videos and that he was there
[37:07.840 --> 37:08.840]  when it started.
[37:08.840 --> 37:10.640]  I mean, I've got all the news reports right here.
[37:10.640 --> 37:12.120]  I've already moved past that.
[37:12.120 --> 37:14.960]  I'm not saying the school shooting didn't happen.
[37:14.960 --> 37:20.520]  But you can go to Jamie White's article, update, confusion over where David Hogg was
[37:20.520 --> 37:24.360]  during school shooting, three different videos of him saying three different things.
[37:24.360 --> 37:28.240]  Now, in a free country, I'm allowed to point this out.
[37:28.240 --> 37:32.520]  If David Hogg thinks that's defamatory, his words, he can sue me.
[37:32.520 --> 37:34.000]  He can win in court.
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.480]  But just people filing lawsuits on me doesn't mean I get taken off the Internet.
[37:38.480 --> 37:43.000]  Just like they say if Mueller indicts you, it means you're a Russian agent.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.200]  But none of the indictments are about espionage.
[37:45.200 --> 37:46.520]  None of them are about collusion.
[37:46.520 --> 37:51.400]  It's all about bank accounts from 15 years ago.
[37:51.400 --> 37:56.600]  All right, I said I'd get to it, but a lot was breaking during the break.
[37:56.600 --> 38:01.560]  So a lot I can't get into on air right now, but I can tell you right now the White House
[38:01.560 --> 38:05.000]  is watching this very, very closely.
[38:05.000 --> 38:15.920]  So yeah, Jack Dorsey, Google, all you guys, Twitter, Apple, you guys have really gone
[38:15.920 --> 38:19.400]  far here and Jack Dorsey's smart.
[38:19.400 --> 38:22.080]  He knows he got singled out.
[38:22.080 --> 38:31.600]  He knows that he went a little too far and El Presidente is looking at him.
[38:31.600 --> 38:36.160]  And so he's got the people rebelling at Twitter saying, do more, ban them all, purge everyone.
[38:36.160 --> 38:42.280]  He's like, hold your horses, sweethearts.
[38:42.280 --> 38:43.280]  We're going to get them.
[38:43.280 --> 38:46.480]  We just got to be very delicate about it.
[38:46.480 --> 38:53.240]  I mean, he's been leading the vanguard and I welcome him backing off of it.
[38:53.240 --> 38:57.680]  That's why I went on Hannity who he knows talks to the president every day and said,
[38:57.680 --> 38:59.000]  oh, I'm not censoring anybody.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.600]  I'm not shadow banning.
[39:00.600 --> 39:01.600]  Really.
[39:01.600 --> 39:08.400]  That's why as soon as you took the shadow ban off us, we went from 20 retweets to 10,000.
[39:08.400 --> 39:14.000]  The next day after Trump did that, all of our tweets started working again.
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.800]  They were dialed down to nothing, to nothing.
[39:19.800 --> 39:20.960]  And then they play this game.
[39:20.960 --> 39:22.200]  Nobody's censoring.
[39:22.200 --> 39:33.120]  But now they're out in the open admitting that they're censoring everybody.
[39:33.120 --> 39:36.200]  And the question is, why are they doing this?
[39:36.200 --> 39:37.200]  And I'll get to it next segment.
[39:37.200 --> 39:38.440]  I said I would.
[39:38.440 --> 39:39.440]  This segment.
[39:39.440 --> 39:40.440]  I need another earpiece.
[39:40.440 --> 39:41.440]  We need to throw this one away.
[39:41.440 --> 39:42.440]  This is the broken one.
[39:42.440 --> 39:43.440]  I need a good one.
[39:43.440 --> 39:44.440]  It keeps popping out.
[39:44.440 --> 39:45.440]  It's driving me crazy.
[39:45.440 --> 39:46.440]  Thanks.
[39:46.440 --> 39:48.720]  I missed information overload at this point too.
[39:48.720 --> 39:52.080]  There is so much insanity going on.
[39:52.080 --> 39:55.440]  They have said they want an uprising and overthrow a coup d'etat against the president.
[39:55.440 --> 39:58.120]  They've said they're in a civil war, the last civil war.
[39:58.120 --> 40:01.920]  They've said that they want to purge all conservatives and patriots off the Internet.
[40:01.920 --> 40:04.920]  And now it's happening.
[40:04.920 --> 40:06.240]  And what are we going to do about it?
[40:06.240 --> 40:07.920]  They're making their move.
[40:07.920 --> 40:11.200]  They're making their move because America's coming back.
[40:11.200 --> 40:12.640]  America's coming together.
[40:12.640 --> 40:16.120]  The police are turning against Antifa and even places like San Francisco and Berkeley
[40:16.120 --> 40:19.920]  and arresting them and none of the patriots.
[40:19.920 --> 40:25.280]  We ran into a lot of liberal police in San Francisco who came over to our crew off record
[40:25.280 --> 40:28.720]  and said, look, I'm a liberal, but I like you guys and know what your real message is
[40:28.720 --> 40:30.080]  and we watch you.
[40:30.080 --> 40:34.200]  And that's why they went from the police protecting Antifa just a few months ago and
[40:34.200 --> 40:39.760]  letting them beat people up to the police going after them and doing their job.
[40:39.760 --> 40:53.320]  And not following the illegal orders of their globalist police chief.
[40:53.320 --> 40:54.320]  And who knows?
[40:54.320 --> 40:56.840]  Maybe the police chief isn't a globalist, but they gave bad orders before to sit there
[40:56.840 --> 40:59.000]  and aid to med this whole situation.
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.360]  But it's amazing to see CNN running around saying, shut Alex Jones down on Twitter.
[41:05.360 --> 41:07.640]  He says David Hogg is a crisis actor.
[41:07.640 --> 41:10.280]  He says David Hogg wasn't there during the shooting.
[41:10.280 --> 41:11.360]  He says no shooting happened.
[41:11.360 --> 41:12.560]  I said no such thing.
[41:12.560 --> 41:17.560]  I said he's in the drama club out of 3,000 students, four of them get picked who are
[41:17.560 --> 41:22.160]  already anti-gun, who've already given anti-gun speeches to be the spokesperson for all the
[41:22.160 --> 41:25.960]  other kids and then all the other young people don't get to go on the news and sell their
[41:25.960 --> 41:26.960]  point of view.
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.280]  And then David Hogg leads huge rallies all over the country, calls me a con artist, says
[41:31.280 --> 41:36.920]  I'm a snake all salesman and I politely respond back to him and then they say I'm beating
[41:36.920 --> 41:40.880]  up on some young person and I'm a bully.
[41:40.880 --> 41:44.840]  Hogg is in a man's world out there blaming gun owners for what happened.
[41:44.840 --> 41:48.360]  And it's all back again, see.
[41:48.360 --> 41:49.720]  And they keep running the headlines.
[41:49.720 --> 41:51.560]  Jones says nobody died at Parkland.
[41:51.560 --> 41:53.240]  They cannot find the video.
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.000]  They cannot find the audio with Sandy Hook because I used to play devil's advocate.
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.840]  They can because I was looking at all the angles, having people on for debates, looking
[42:01.840 --> 42:04.200]  at anomalies, saying I can see how it totally happened.
[42:04.200 --> 42:07.280]  A lot of these parents look very credible and I would say the other.
[42:07.280 --> 42:09.560]  They take that out and sue me for that.
[42:09.560 --> 42:11.520]  Obviously that's protected under the First Amendment.
[42:11.520 --> 42:16.840]  But now the Democrats are all over the news saying we want to get rid of New York Times
[42:16.840 --> 42:19.080]  versus Sullivan, the defense of the free speech.
[42:19.080 --> 42:21.880]  We want to basically repeal the First Amendment.
[42:21.880 --> 42:25.240]  That's what they're doing in their desperateness to suppress everybody.
[42:25.240 --> 42:28.240]  So that's why this is so incredibly historic.
[42:28.240 --> 42:37.840]  When we come back, I'm going to be very focused and I'm going to get into how they may try
[42:37.840 --> 42:41.280]  to take Trump out and what I think is coming next and why they've shut me off the air because
[42:41.280 --> 42:44.200]  they don't want me to be able to communicate to the full audience ahead of this so we can't
[42:44.200 --> 42:47.960]  report on it in a lifetime because they know what we say keeps coming true, that our credibility
[42:47.960 --> 42:50.400]  is so high, especially with intelligence agencies and others.
[42:50.400 --> 42:52.560]  They want us muffled, but it's backfired on them.
[42:52.560 --> 42:54.360]  So what are they going to do now?
[42:54.360 --> 43:03.520]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.680]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[43:07.680 --> 43:10.680]  every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[46:13.680 --> 46:17.720]  knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[46:17.720 --> 46:22.920]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[46:22.920 --> 46:27.120]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better

[47:03.520 --> 47:21.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.440 --> 47:27.200]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.600]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[47:31.600 --> 47:36.320]  One Tig Tygen is going to be joining us, one of the Patriot heroes of Benghazi.
[47:36.320 --> 47:39.360]  I see him as just a big of heroes bucking against Hillary and Obama and telling the
[47:39.360 --> 47:41.360]  truth about what happened when they were being threatened.
[47:41.360 --> 47:48.000]  I know where it's like to go up against the Clintons and Obama and it's not fun in public
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  or behind the scenes.
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.800]  He's going to be joining us in studio, he's speaking outside Austin this weekend.
[47:52.800 --> 47:56.600]  I'm tempted to take my kids out there so they can see what a real American looks like.
[47:56.600 --> 47:58.680]  He'll be in studio coming up.
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.600]  And then Dinesh D'Souza joins us coming up at the start of the next hour.
[48:03.600 --> 48:07.200]  Political president pardoned by the president, number two documentary filmmaker in world
[48:07.200 --> 48:10.920]  history, DB number one of Hollywood wasn't suppressing him.
[48:10.920 --> 48:17.680]  His new film, Death of the Nation is the antidote to the horrible KKK film, birth of a nation.
[48:17.680 --> 48:21.880]  And I don't normally get tears in my eyes during a film, but this was powerful because
[48:21.880 --> 48:27.720]  it just reminded me, it's so accurate, I'm quite the history buff, of just how evil
[48:27.720 --> 48:32.040]  the Democrats are and just how consciously wicked they are.
[48:32.040 --> 48:36.080]  So it is a film that they're trying to suppress.
[48:36.080 --> 48:37.080]  Everybody needs to go see it.
[48:37.080 --> 48:38.080]  That is coming up.
[48:38.080 --> 48:42.080]  And everybody also needs to go to infowars.com forward slash show and not just sign up for
[48:42.080 --> 48:46.120]  the free apps or sign up for the free newsletter, sign up for the free podcast so they can't
[48:46.120 --> 48:50.560]  censor you as easily getting to me and getting to the other broadcasters and guests who are
[48:50.560 --> 48:55.820]  the real, real tip of the spear here.
[48:55.820 --> 48:59.400]  You can then tell everybody you know, hey, here, you know, Alex Jones, you know, the
[48:59.400 --> 49:00.400]  forbidden thing.
[49:00.400 --> 49:02.880]  Why don't you hear what he's actually saying?
[49:02.880 --> 49:08.280]  Not what the Democrats, I mean, they had most of the Democratic party online and on
[49:08.280 --> 49:12.560]  Twitter and on CNN and I can't keep track of it, thousands of articles a day saying that
[49:12.560 --> 49:18.200]  I'm a Nazi and that I'm a terrorist and that I want violence and all these things out of
[49:18.200 --> 49:21.000]  context edited, none of it's even true.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.320]  It's crazy to watch their giant Psyop.
[49:23.320 --> 49:30.600]  And there's an article I'm going to get to what the intelligence communities insurance
[49:30.600 --> 49:33.840]  policy on the president would look like.
[49:33.840 --> 49:36.800]  It's a, it's a Hill article and if you read what they're doing to Trump and then think
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.840]  about what they're doing to info wars, this is the blueprint for everybody.
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.960]  Julian Assange has been on house arrest, the Ecuadorian embassy for six years, Tommy Robinson,
[49:47.960 --> 49:50.200]  you know, prison.
[49:50.200 --> 49:53.400]  They're trying to de-platform me and destroy me and sue me out of existence.
[49:53.400 --> 49:58.080]  This is what it looks like in 21st century information warfare to retake this country
[49:58.080 --> 50:03.480]  from the globalist and from the chai comms and it's all coming out.
[50:03.480 --> 50:07.680]  So let's go ahead and get into what, what's happening.
[50:07.680 --> 50:11.640]  When they started de-platforming us two weeks ago, I shared as soon as they're successful
[50:11.640 --> 50:19.160]  with us and I said, and they're going to do it, they're going to come after everybody
[50:19.160 --> 50:23.760]  else because I was reading what the democratic party websites were saying last week.
[50:23.760 --> 50:30.120]  They were saying, when we get Jones down, we want Stephen Crowder and we want all these
[50:30.120 --> 50:32.960]  other people down for Stephen Crowder.
[50:32.960 --> 50:36.160]  Even with shadow banning, his average video has two million views.
[50:36.160 --> 50:37.640]  Everything he does is a hit.
[50:37.640 --> 50:42.880]  I go to my kid's school, I go to mainline high schools with my kids for sporting events.
[50:42.880 --> 50:45.760]  Do you know Stephen Crowder?
[50:45.760 --> 50:51.520]  You know who I am, but you know Paul Watson, he works for you, you know Stephen Crowder.
[50:51.520 --> 50:57.600]  So smart, funny, good looking guys who are very appealing across the board and promoting
[50:57.600 --> 51:01.560]  America, they want them shut down, period.
[51:01.560 --> 51:03.560]  And now it's been announced.
[51:03.560 --> 51:05.120]  He is the next target.
[51:05.120 --> 51:09.600]  And man, he's really polite but effective and if they're calling him hate, because you
[51:09.600 --> 51:15.480]  can take stuff out of context and twist it, Crowder is very scripted and I don't mean
[51:15.480 --> 51:16.480]  that in the mean way.
[51:16.480 --> 51:18.040]  He's a famous actor in his own right, famous called actor.
[51:18.040 --> 51:21.920]  So he's able to then really do a lot of preparation and do what he does and it's because he is
[51:21.920 --> 51:24.840]  effective and is getting liberals to walk away is why they want him shut down.
[51:24.840 --> 51:26.760]  But I'm digressing.
[51:26.760 --> 51:30.960]  I said they're going to shut everybody down ahead of the midterms.
[51:30.960 --> 51:33.920]  They know they're losing, they're panicking.
[51:33.920 --> 51:37.000]  But they've also said they're going to have low intensity warfare.
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.320]  They're not going to just burn trash cans and knocks the windows out.
[51:39.320 --> 51:41.720]  They have said that they're going to start killing cops.
[51:41.720 --> 51:44.560]  This is what the antifa internal leaks are.
[51:44.560 --> 51:48.360]  They're going to start hitting some Republican Congressmen like they've already done at the
[51:48.360 --> 51:50.240]  baseball field.
[51:50.240 --> 51:53.320]  They're going to shoot their Republican neighbors, city council members.
[51:53.320 --> 51:57.800]  They are all just being told through the ether, like an al-Qaeda type situation where there's
[51:57.800 --> 51:58.800]  no cells.
[51:58.800 --> 52:05.480]  They just put out the order and then people that are adherents out there through the web,
[52:05.480 --> 52:06.480]  they carry it out.
[52:06.480 --> 52:08.120]  And all of that is being amplified.
[52:08.120 --> 52:09.720]  All of that is being pushed.
[52:09.720 --> 52:13.080]  All of that is being hammered.
[52:13.080 --> 52:18.760]  And so they want enough civil unrest in the country about a month before the midterms.
[52:18.760 --> 52:23.000]  And they're openly pushing to have the 25th Amendment invoked by the cabinet with enough
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.840]  threats on them and their families to then remove Trump.
[52:26.840 --> 52:31.160]  But they want the uprising in the background like they did when they backed the Arab Spring
[52:31.160 --> 52:37.720]  against their allies in areas like Egypt.
[52:37.720 --> 52:42.360]  This is the classic, sorrow style, leftist state department style, shaken bay cooperation
[52:42.360 --> 52:46.560]  or why they staged Benghazi to ship the weapons into Syria to start that level to collapse
[52:46.560 --> 52:50.800]  it into Turkey to open up the migration zone into Europe for the Islamic invasion, which
[52:50.800 --> 52:54.080]  they now admit is official.
[52:54.080 --> 53:02.840]  So they wouldn't make, here's the bottom line, they wouldn't make such a bold, full-throated
[53:02.840 --> 53:09.800]  attack on the First Amendment and absolute racketeering corporate coordination between
[53:09.800 --> 53:13.520]  $3 trillion of capital.
[53:13.520 --> 53:16.960]  You take the six companies that have blacklisted me, and they call it a blacklist, they're
[53:16.960 --> 53:22.800]  not calling it censorship, unpersoning, putting me into the phantom zone, $3 trillion is what
[53:22.800 --> 53:27.360]  they're estimated at about $3.1 trillion.
[53:27.360 --> 53:32.920]  So $3 plus trillion of companies that have moved to China are muscling in on America
[53:32.920 --> 53:36.880]  and they demonize me first, I'm the target because Hillary called me dark heart, knows
[53:36.880 --> 53:42.040]  we were effective at rebooting Americana, and they know that we're growing exponentially,
[53:42.040 --> 53:43.040]  so they got scared.
[53:43.040 --> 53:47.160]  They've already dialed back 93%, all the other conservative and nationalist sites, any type
[53:47.160 --> 53:56.240]  of pro-government, pro-military group, pro-Trump group, they're all banned, they're all blocked.
[53:56.240 --> 54:02.320]  But everybody else is already 93%, Paul Watson is left alone, he works with them for wars,
[54:02.320 --> 54:08.120]  but he's 97% because we have the analytics, we have the server logs, when they turn us
[54:08.120 --> 54:10.800]  off, man, they just flip a switch.
[54:10.800 --> 54:17.520]  So they wouldn't make a super ultra crazy bold move like this, which is right out of
[54:17.520 --> 54:24.720]  the Soviet Union, right out of Nazi Germany, unless they are planning to go for broke on
[54:24.720 --> 54:26.320]  every front, and now they're doing it.
[54:26.320 --> 54:32.200]  So civil unrest, targeted assassinations, destabilization ops, but here's the big one.
[54:32.200 --> 54:37.920]  They're going to try, I believe, in October, history mirrors itself, and it generally comes
[54:37.920 --> 54:41.400]  in late September into early, mid-October.
[54:41.400 --> 54:49.560]  They're going to try a stock market crash with civil unrest in October.
[54:49.560 --> 54:57.880]  And I just can't believe the globalists are siding with the Chai comms, and Hollywood's
[54:57.880 --> 55:01.080]  doing this, and that all these crazy people don't want America to come back.
[55:01.080 --> 55:04.120]  And everybody's been serving the globalists kind of half-assed, you didn't know what you
[55:04.120 --> 55:05.120]  were doing.
[55:05.120 --> 55:07.760]  You really should be joining the American team right now, because we've finally got
[55:07.760 --> 55:08.760]  a real president.
[55:08.760 --> 55:12.120]  The country's coming back, and this is crazy what you're doing, because if they're able
[55:12.120 --> 55:15.840]  to plunge the stock market and bring in civil unrest, bad enough to remove Trump, they're
[55:15.840 --> 55:20.760]  going to go for broke, and they're going to activate all sorts of sleeper cells.
[55:20.760 --> 55:23.800]  They're working with Iran, we know the left's working with Iran, they've got real sleeper
[55:23.800 --> 55:29.360]  cells, not like the fake al-Qaeda ones, they're going to start doing all sorts of nasty stuff.
[55:29.360 --> 55:34.400]  I wouldn't want to be in an apartment building, I'll tell you that, so, because I know what
[55:34.400 --> 55:38.160]  Hezbollah's planning, they're going to put up chlorine gas down your air conditioners.
[55:38.160 --> 55:41.760]  About eight o'clock at night, so, when everybody's sitting around to have dinner.
[55:41.760 --> 55:44.800]  So I mean, you can imagine the panic when you've got 5,000 people dead in the building
[55:44.800 --> 55:45.800]  in an hour.
[55:45.800 --> 55:50.360]  I mean, they are ready, they are lined up, they are, this is, this is how wars begin,
[55:50.360 --> 55:54.560]  and they think they're taking America down right now.
[55:54.560 --> 56:01.400]  Now, China started buckling and backing off on sanctions against the U.S. in the trade
[56:01.400 --> 56:06.360]  war, but they fired on U.S. ships, six warning shots, and said, get out of the area immediately
[56:06.360 --> 56:07.360]  or we'll attack you.
[56:07.360 --> 56:11.840]  So, this is a crazy time, and all these powerful forces have used our open society against
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.840]  us to try to bring our country down, and they wouldn't be making a bold move like this unless
[56:16.840 --> 56:22.440]  they were planning to go for broke, so, everybody better get maximum engaged politically, but
[56:22.440 --> 56:27.280]  also spend some of your time, I'd say 80% engaged politically, 20% of the time.
[56:27.280 --> 56:31.000]  They start killing political leaders and patriots.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.600]  If you're a political leader or a patriot in your area, and you don't even think yourself
[56:33.600 --> 56:37.560]  as a leader, you're on a list, they've got left as coming to your house to kill you.
[56:37.560 --> 56:43.200]  When they initiate this operation, if they really go for Trump, everybody else, they're
[56:43.200 --> 56:44.600]  not going to just take Trump out.
[56:44.600 --> 56:48.360]  They're going to go after Ron Paul, Senator Paul, they're going to go after me, they're
[56:48.360 --> 56:51.520]  going to go after you, they're going to go after judges, they're going to go after the
[56:51.520 --> 56:57.880]  Supreme Court, they're going to, let me tell you, they might set a nuke off in Congress.
[56:57.880 --> 57:00.480]  There is no link, they won't go.
[57:00.480 --> 57:01.880]  This is World War Four.
[57:01.880 --> 57:06.600]  The Cold War was World War Three, according to the CIA, and I agree with that.
[57:06.600 --> 57:11.400]  This is World War Four, this is it, does everybody better decide which side they're on, 30 seconds
[57:11.400 --> 57:13.200]  of plugging.

[59:53.560 --> 01:00:07.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:28.760]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and as soon as this with us for the next 30 minutes, I'm
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.840]  one of the great heroes of the Benghazi war and even bigger hero for telling the truth
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.360]  against Hillary and maybe even winning the election joining us in studio.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:41.360]  Dinesh D'Souza is with us.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.040]  He is the number two biggest filmmaker in history and that's being in Hollywood Outsider.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.680]  He's also a number one New York Times best-selling author of Death of a Nation.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:56.320]  You can find all that at BigLiveBook.com and on Twitter for now at Dinesh D'Souza, Facebook
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.680]  Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.600]  His film has been in the top 10 as it opened.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.840]  He's had one film that's been number one and he joins us now to talk about the film.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:11.360]  I saw it about a week after it came out and my wife who's pretty informed but she's kind
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.360]  of like a libertarian.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.320]  She said, I knew a lot of this but I didn't and she said, is that accurate?
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.320]  And I said, it's deadly accurate.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.960]  We went home that night and my parents were babysitting the kids and we spent like two
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:27.200]  hours looking at history and she goes, gosh, I didn't know all this and exactly this is
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:32.320]  a big hoax that's been exposed and if it gets out, I think it could win the midterms.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.320]  Dinesh.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:39.080]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on the show and yes, Death of a Nation, it's in 1,000 theaters
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.080]  right now.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.520]  It's doing really well as a book of the same title that's in the bookstores.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.920]  You know, a lot of people focus on fake news and what this movie and book deal with are
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:56.800]  fake scholarship, fake history, fake narratives about America that I debunk in the film.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.200]  Well, let me tell you, your other films are excellent but this one was a whole other level.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.600]  This is wow.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:09.000]  Well the left has been flinging these charges of racism and fascism.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.320]  They've been doing it at Trump.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:16.760]  They've been doing it at the right more generally and all of this is based on a historical claim
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:22.160]  that fascism is on the right and that racism, even though it might have once been in the
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:26.080]  Democratic Party, is now the staple of the Republican Party.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:33.400]  Now this is all pure bogus, bogus from start to finish and so, but it takes some unpacking
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.240]  and so in the movie, we kind of, we take you to Europe.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.120]  You see the rise of Italian fascism, of German national socialism.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.400]  There you see on the screen, that's the Nazi platform of 1933 and if you look at the screen,
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:51.640]  you'll see state control of banks and insurance and healthcare and education.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:56.920]  Well, I mean, it was the liberals that were always free eugenics and sterilizing the blacks
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.840]  and poor whites and everybody.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.320]  Everybody, it was the Republicans that were against it.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.440]  If you go to history books, it's right there.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:08.240]  I mean, was the Democrats, as you know, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute funded by the Rockefellers?
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:14.720]  Yeah, in the 1930s, there were deep ties between the Democratic Party and the progressives
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.200]  on this side of the Atlantic and the fascists in Europe.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.560]  I mean, Mussolini was praising FDR.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.960]  FDR was praising Mussolini.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:29.360]  I quote in the movie, the Nazi newspaper, the Volkischer Bio-Bachter, praising the new
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.360]  deal.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.080]  So all of this, you know, but it's amazing that we were educated people, but we don't
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.200]  know much about it.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.640]  It's not been in our textbooks.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.920]  It's not on the history channel, certainly not on Wikipedia.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:44.200]  So we are the victims, if you will, the suckers of progressive historiography, the progressives
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.400]  telling the tale their way, leaving a lot of inconvenient facts out, but happily all
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.360]  those inconvenient facts are now in the movie on the screen.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.360]  Well, my grandfather grew up in Dallas, and he was from partly German descent, some of
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.920]  the family still spoke German, and they didn't like Hitler.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.920]  He fought in World War II.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.520]  They thought it was really weird that they heard Roosevelt saying Hitler was good in
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.840]  the 30s, mid-30s, and then the German bun was saying join it, the Liberals were saying
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]  join it, and they didn't do it.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.720]  My grandfather told me all this when I was a little kid, and my mom would say, your
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:20.640]  grandfather's a little eccentric, honey, and my mom's great, but she couldn't believe
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.880]  it, though he was living it.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.440]  We have a scene in the film where the senior Nazis, the head of the Justice Department,
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:31.040]  important people are sitting around a table, and they're drafting the Nuremberg laws which
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.120]  make Jews into second-class citizens.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:38.120]  Now the Nazis have in their hands the democratic laws of the Jim Crow South.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.880]  They are literally crossing out the word black and writing in the word Jew.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.560]  So see what I'm saying, not that there was a parallel or similarity, the Nazis are using
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.160]  the democratic blueprint now.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.400]  Again someone watching the movie, if they don't know much, might be forgiven of thinking
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400]  Hitler-
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.400]  Stay there, Dinesh.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.400]  This is so powerful.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.160]  We'll come back with a trailer straight ahead.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:03.920]  I want to plow into all of this, that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:09.880]  encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:18.200]  or books or videos or other material from InfoWarStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.120]  I mean I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.120]  at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.760]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.920]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920]  children and adults.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.160]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, the colloidal silver
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:45.960]  and iodine as well, InfoWarsLife.com, or triple-A2533139, and your purchase of the products stands
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.480]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.760]  satanic pedophile armies, and that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:06:05.000]  they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:17.720]  The front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:22.520]  Lincoln was elected to unite a country and stop slavery.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:29.320]  Democrats smeared him, went to war against him, assassinated him, now their target is
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.320]  Trump.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:39.760]  Donald Trump wins the presidency, so help me God.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.760]  They say he's killing America.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.000]  There will be a vote, we'll impeach.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  They say he's a racist.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  This was a white lash.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  And a fascist.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  Who are the real racists?
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:58.720]  Northern Democrats had conspired together with Southern Democrats to take away the fruit
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.720]  of other people's labor.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.720]  Who are the real fascists?
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:03.720]  Zionist!
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:14.120]  Both Mussolini and Hitler set up and ran welfare states.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.920]  This was done by the Duke Gooders, the Liberals, the people who wanted to improve society.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.920]  Which party attacks off free speech?
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:24.000]  How dare you speak against the Vila!
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Our religious liberty and our personal safety.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  A nation dies when its people are not free.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  We too must fight for freedom, regardless of the price we pay.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  An end in terror is preferable to a terror with no end.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  The stakes could not be higher, we're talking about America, the greatest nation on earth.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  Lincoln saved America for the first time.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  It's now up to us to save America a second time.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have no stake in death of the nation.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  Never have when I have the nation.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  This is on.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  In fact, years ago, we even have one of the advertising groups want to advertise with us.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  And I said, no, I'll just promote it and play ads.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  The network I'm on, they bought some ads from a few years ago with their last film.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  I want Dinesh D'Souza on because he's had films that have been number one before.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  This one is already in a thousand theaters doing great.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  But I noticed I couldn't go to any of the theaters in the core of Austin, the Alamo Draft House.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  None of them are carrying it.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  They're blocking it.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  There's the company book.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  Everyone must see this film.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  I got to tell you, I am quite the researched history buff on the Civil War and America's founding.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  And also Andrew Jackson and these periods and World War II.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  And this film is extremely accurate, very avant-garde in that it's telling a truth that's been hidden.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  As Dinesh said earlier, we just joined us.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  There's fake news.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  What about fake scholars, fake history?
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  So Dinesh, in the film, it gets into the book burning of the Nazis.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  And boy, we see the left and the universities doing it today, Antifa as their brown shirts.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  It's just incredible, the parallels.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Yeah, today they don't have to make a big pyre of books and burn them because they don't assign them.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  They don't hire conservative professors.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  They try to drive right-wing speakers off the campus.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  I mean, look at the way they're trying to make you into a digital non-person.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  I mean, you have to go back to Aldous Huxley or Orwell to read these kinds of scenes,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  except they are in a way playing themselves out in America today.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  It's absolutely outrageous, and I think anyone who defends civil liberty in the First Amendment,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  I mean, where's the ACLU on all this, Alex?
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  The ACLU should be taking your case.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  We've talked to them, and they've said, no, a new time is here.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  The decisions are made to basically selectively repeal the First Amendment.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  You've got Senator Murphy in the news saying,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  Info Wars is the tip of the iceberg of hate, and he goes on to say, ban them all, and now they're calling for Fox News to be banned.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  Steven Crowder, they're now saying they're going to ban anyone that questions man-made climate change.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  I mean, they just pick me as the first domino, and they're testing to see what the Republicans do.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  Well, it starts with this. It's not just a digital banning.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  It's the cheering for it that I see on social media.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  I mean, what a totalitarian mindset.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  Now, with my movie, Death of a Nation, and by the way, you go to deathofanationmovie.com, you plug in your zip code,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  it will tell you, boom, where the movie is playing near you.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  But what the left is trying to do there is essentially either ignore it, an ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN,
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  not one word about the movie, even though it's in a thousand theaters.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  The people who do write about it like The Washington Post, Dinesh says that Hitler is a liberal Democrat.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  Well, that's pure nonsense. I don't say that. I would be a kook if I did.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  What I do say is that Hitler got some of his bigoted and murderous schemes from American progressives and from the Democratic Party,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  but they can't accuse me of saying that because that happens to be a historic-
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  Because of the Nuremberg trials, which I've actually read the transcript of and actually watched some of the original film of,
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  their main defense was they got a lot of from the U.S.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  That's right. The Nazis got progressive eugenics schemes, both for their sterilization laws and their euthanasia laws.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  By the way, the euthanasia laws were kind of a dress rehearsal for the Holocaust.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  The Nazis also got their Nuremberg laws from the Democratic Jim Crow laws.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  And you know, if you watch the movie, you might say, where's Dinesh getting this stuff?
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  This is why I wrote a book, because it has all the supportive documentation.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  In fact, I'm relying on the work of the Yale legal scholar, James Whitman, his book, Hitler's American Model.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  This guy has the transcripts of those Nuremberg meetings.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  So the left can't question this stuff and it's so damning.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  This is really why they have to say, don't go see the movie or misdescribe what I'm doing or try to ignore it all together.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  Well, our gun control laws later got translated just like they took our laws.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  The Democrats ended up taking their laws to pass the 68 Gun Control Act. You cannot make this up.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  Now, what happened, I think, Alex, is after World War II, the progressives who were coming to power in the Academy and the media,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  by the way, they knew that Nazism and fascism were on the left.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  They knew that the progressives and Democrats had been in bed with Mussolini, although not with Hitler,
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  but they didn't want young people to find out about this.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  And so this is when they settled upon the big lie to muddy the definition of fascism,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  to pretend that fascism was right-wing instead of left-wing, and ultimately to rewrite the history books to give people a bill of goods.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  And that's why the book and the movie, to unmask this progressive override.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Sure.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  And I noticed the little bit of pressure you've gotten, because they should just black me out as well.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  That's their tactic. Now they just lie about me.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  It was, oh, Dinesh is crazy. He just claims all this. I read Mein Kampf.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  I read Order of the Death said. I read Shearer's Rise of the Ball of Third Right.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  I read it from both sides and Hitler called himself a socialist.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  He believed that and then called himself a fascist.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  And you explained that in the film. That just means socialism,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  but using the power of the corporations to basically empower it.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  I mean, I read it in Hitler's own words.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  The Nazi Party means National Socialist Workers' Party.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  I mean, my God.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  I think you also see this not only with fascism, but with racism.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  The deep history of the Democratic Party and its complicity with racism.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  The reason I titled this movie Death of a Nation, it's a reference to birth of a nation.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  Which was the movie that Woodrow Wilson, a progressive Democrat,
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  showed in the White House to his cabinet.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  And the hero of that movie, I kid you not, is the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  So essentially what the progressives were saying, what the title of that movie means,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  is we don't like the founding. The birth of a nation is right now.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  We, the progressives, are starting America all over again.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  And the unifying principle, our unifying principle of the Democratic Party is bigotry.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  And by the way, you interview a bunch of top Nazis in the U.S.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  and they admit that they like birth of a nation.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  They don't think you should be here because you're an Indian American.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  It doesn't matter if you contribute, they're smart.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  I don't care what color you are, you're smart and I love you.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  And they admit in the movie, I don't give it all away,
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  that yeah, they're actually Democrats.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  It's so eye-opening to see these white nationalists
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  and one after the other, they have a deep history in the left.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  I put on Richard Spencer, the poster boy of white supremacy,
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  and out of his mouth he goes, I'm a progressive.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  I don't like Reagan. All my favorite presidents are Democrats.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  Why do they fetishize the 30s and 40s?
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  He even is wearing like a German-style 1938 outfit.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  I mean, what the hell?
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  When I first saw him, I noticed that he looked kind of antiquated,
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  almost like he was from a different era.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  And it's kind of in the interview that it emerges
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  that this guy would fit right in with Woodrow Wilson's progressive racism
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  in the teens and 90s.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  I don't know, Hitler was Time Magazine Man of the Year twice.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  They had like gardening magazines.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  That's what my grandfather told me.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  He said, listen, the US used to be pro-Hitler and it was incredible.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  And I heard all this and then later, that's why I got into history books.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  Then as we're going to break, when I'm going to come back,
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  I want to get into the contemporary times of what we're facing
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  that really prove your film because they're everywhere,
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  also on the right, saying, de-platform me, ban me,
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  but then once I'm restricted, then they lie even worse
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  and won't let me speak out.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  So there's this de-personing so they can then build this straw man of who,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  I suppose, lamb.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  I want to get your advice on what Trump should do as a country.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  I mean, they've had 10 congressional hearings,
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  five in the Senate, five in the House,
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  where I'm the main subject, never showing what I said, lying about me,
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  and saying, ban me off the web.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  And then as soon as it happened last week,
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  now they're banning everybody else.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  What do we do with the former political president
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  and part mother president, Dinesh D'Souza, stay with us.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  Get your Dylan bottle today at BYLN.CO.

[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  you could fight against heart disease naturally at Heart and Body Extract?

[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  It is well known in traditional medicine for exuding properties.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  Thomas Jefferson, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  Have you seen how Apple has moved to China and become state run as tax exempt and how
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  Google is helping build their internet sensor engines?
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  I mean, this is crazy, Denesh.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  You've got to remember that our civil rights laws do apply to private discrimination.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  They cover companies, particularly large companies, and you're not allowed to discriminate against blacks or against women if you're companies of a certain size.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  Besides, you also have a lot of this fanaticism going on at state-run institutions.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  I mean, Berkeley is a state-run institution, and it seems to me that if you have antifa thugs at a place like Berkeley,
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  suppressing people from speaking, what Trump should do is to send in the National Guard.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  Why? Because protecting our First Amendment rights is paramount.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  What do you expect to happen the next three months?
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  I mean, just the energy on the left, they're losing, they're failing even in special elections, but they are just going crazy.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  Well, this is a case where it's a test case for the right, because either we buckle and go soft, we go rhino, or we go tough.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  Now, remember in Lincoln's time, one of the reasons I put Trump and Lincoln on the cover.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  In Lincoln's time, he was surrounded by rhinos, Republicans in name only, who basically told him that trouble is brewing.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  You have to give up the Republican platform of 1860.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  You have to extend the Missouri Compromise line, the slavery line all the way to the Pacific, leave slavery alone south of that line.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  And Lincoln said, no, he goes, I will suffer death before I agree to that.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  I campaigned on this. The American people ratified it through an electoral majority.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  And isn't it crazy? He did suffer death. He did suffer death.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  And he did suffer death eventually, but he was, he was feel tough.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  And what we need from Trump here is not just wisdom, but we need a certain amount of courage.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  And the big question is, will the Republicans stand up and defend liberal, classically liberal principles?
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  No, no, I agree. And the parallels between Trump and Lincoln history are incredible.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  History is repeating again, or at least rhyming.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  What do you think Trump should do? Because he came out and said to Twitter, your shadow banning looks like it's illegal.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  They are the only one not to ban me.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  Showing the Republicans put pressure on tech, not the censor, they'll back off.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  But because they're not signaling that, they're all censoring and purging.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  Exactly. I would like to see a more resolute effort across the board, not just Trump, but also the Republican Congress,
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  begin hearings into all this stuff. I mean, censorship is an issue that we as Americans should agree.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  This is the bedrock foundation of our democracy.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  So if we can't stand up for the First Amendment, what can we stand up for?
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  I agree. We've got three minutes left, and I want to just give you the floor about other key points about the film.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  Obviously, I don't want to give the film away, but seriously, all your children need to see it.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  It's PG-13 or whatever, but I'd take 10-year-olds to this. Old people need to see it.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  Black, white, you need to know the real history. They're scared of this film.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  And the fact that at the end, there's a litmus test that if you expose Soros and his Nazi ties, that's why they've told me they're coming after me.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  So the fact that you did that, I got to tell you, Dinesh, you were already in my eyes in A+, an ace of spades, my friend,
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  but you went to royal flush level with what you did at the end of the movie.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  So congratulations on that because he will come after you.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  Well, the thing about Soros to remember is that when he's asked about his Nazi collaboration,
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  and by collaboration here, we mean at the age of 14, Soros is going around with another guy.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  They're literally the two of them confiscating the property of Jews.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  And Soros admits that he was part of that. He says he didn't directly do it, but he admits he was there,
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  and in that sense, he was a participant.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  Now, when he's asked, how do you feel any guilty as an adult now about it, he goes,
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  no, because I didn't invent Nazi confiscation policies. They were there anyway, it was going to happen anyway.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  And in the movie, we showed that that was basically what the Nazi doctor Mendeley said when he was accused of doing Nazi atrocities.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  He goes, wait a minute, I didn't invent the concentration camp. Those people were going to die anyway.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  So if I was going to do my own macabre experiments on them, I wasn't changing the outcome.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  And I was just following orders. It's such a weird sociopathic out.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  And to realize that this guy today is presenting himself as an anti-fascist, in fact, he's one of the funders of Antifa.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  I mean, the irony could not be deeper. If anyone associated with Trump had Soros' background, can you imagine the national uproar?
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  Well, I read stuff he wrote in the 70s where he thought he was God and stuff. I mean, the guy seriously is just, I don't know what his issue is.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  But as you said, he's one of the main funders of the left in America. And I've just seen the left degenerate into what they are now.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  We need to make Death of the Nation as big as your other films. It's already a big success.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  Again, everybody needs to take their family out to see it, because then it can go from what, a thousand theaters, even more than ash?
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  Yes, and it'll also get a wider distribution in the DVD. I mean, this could be a film that really educates and motivates people leading up to the midterm election.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  So just go to DeathofaNationmovie.com, put in your zip code. Boom, it'll tell you where it's playing. Go see it with your family and friends.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  I'd appreciate it. And you're putting fuel in my rocket to get this message out much more widely and powerfully.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  Well, exactly. When I was there, the theater was almost completely full, but there was a lot of older folks, some young people.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  We need a lot of young people there. This film really is powerful.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  And the average leftist, when they see this, I think will wake up and maybe come out of their programming.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  Vanessa Sousa, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  DeathofaNationmovie.com. And we'll talk to you again very, very soon. God bless.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  Bye-bye.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  All right. We'll be back in studio, ladies and gentlemen, with the heroes of Benghazi.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  Benghazi Hero Benghazi then went public about how they were ordered to stand down despite Hillary's threats. That's coming up straight ahead.

[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  Hey, Alex, mate. I've been following you since I was 14. I'm 32 now.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:14.000]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen,
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  and it had to load down the page on my dial-up into there.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the SuperMail Vitality Decay Man, the Real Red Pill, Michael ZX Body.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  It's all amazing. Thank you, brother.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  That's why Info Wars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue Line, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:16.000]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  They are voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  We came, we saw, we died.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  With her, you'll end up in World Wars.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  Of course not, because she's...
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  Alright, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  We'll try to get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  Well, Trump's got world peace going in North Korea.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  China has been screwing us over, so they fired at U.S. ships today in a warning so they can get out of the South China Sea.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  We hope nuclear war doesn't happen, but I bet on humanity.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  John Teagan is here with us.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  These guys went on television years after Hillary said they were liars and that nobody ordered to stand down.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  Even though there are thousands of people reportedly watching the surveillance footage from the drones knowing that that was the truth.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  And then told the truth to expose her lies, and then the Pentagon turned against Obama and Hillary.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  The intelligence agencies learned about what happened.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  We were talking to her in the break and he was agreeing that that was a real turning point for America in our military intelligence agency.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  She's really waking up to just how, I don't know, traitorous?
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  I mean, what would you call the people that were involved in that stand-up?
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  Good to have you here.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  Appreciate it.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  Appreciate it.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  Thanks for having me, man.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  Good to have you.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  It's a complete disgrace is what I would say.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  I mean, you know, the fact that, you know, again, Bob had given the stand down order that night, the CIA base chief.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  I don't think he realized really the assets that he had or capabilities that he had.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  And, you know, if we'd have left when we wanted to leave immediately, Ambassador Stephen and Sean Smith will still be alive today.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  Because, I mean, it took them over 15 minutes to start the buildings on fire.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  We would have been there.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  They'd have to engage with us and they wouldn't be able to just roam around the property and do what they wanted.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  So why do you think Hillary and them ordered the stand down and then lied about it?
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  Why?
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  It was during the election time.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  They were more worried about their political career than the people on the ground.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  I mean, that's, it's been shown over and over again that politicians really, truly don't care about the American people.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  They care about themselves and their career.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  So I just can't get the instinct, even if you have the forces there, especially to just cut people loose and lie about it.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  You know, that, that she, I don't think she really knew the mindset of the local Libyans themselves because they like this.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  I mean, I've never been in a Muslim country where they would come and shake your hand saying it's honored being American.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  They've never, you know, it's the one place where they bought our food, they bought our coffee, you know, and they actually generally wanted to talk to us and just like this.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  I mean, they walk across the street just to introduce themselves to us.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  And I just don't think she really knew the people that were there.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  If they were sending the military force to help out the ambassador and us, I don't think they would have batted an eye at it.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  I mean, for one, you're dealing with a lawless country.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  It wasn't like they had a really organized central government.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  Well, I wasn't there like you, but I've studied it.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  Kedav, he was a bad guy before, but he came in about eight years before, invested all his money in the West, thought Obama was his buddy, get all this.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  And so a lot of that was he was trying to build up Africa and thought he was buddies with the U.S.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  And then some of the other leftist groups were bringing in al-Qaeda forces out of Egypt, out of other countries, massing them in Benghazi and preparing for what was coming up.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  And so that's really why that was there.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  They didn't want a skirmish with U.S. forces or some folks getting wiped out to get in the way of their planned takedown completely of Libya.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  Yeah, I mean, again, it wasn't it wasn't the Libyans that attacked that really attacked us.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  It was outside.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  Foreign attackers that, you know, I'm sorry, it wasn't.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  I mean, I'm pretty sure some Libyans that were inside a group.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  But you ever learned where they'd come in from?
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  I've heard Egypt and other areas.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  Yeah, they've come from there's Egyptian, there's Saudi.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  I think there's a couple of Uzbekistanis in there.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  So I mean, they're all all over.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  Well, just giving it the 35,000 foot view.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  And of course, there's amazing film, 13 hours all about it.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  Looking at that, from my perspective, talking to people in the military and Congress, Benghazi was a turning point against Hillary and Obama.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  And the fact that they couldn't get you guys to shut up and you went on TV and said, no, they're lying, not us.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  That I think that was the final breaking point.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  I think you guys helped get Trump elected.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  I believe so, too.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  I definitely we know doing during the book, Tory ran into quite a few people that are Democrats and they're saying because of you guys came out and told them and still standing up to it.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  That's the reason why we're voting for Trump.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  It was it was a huge turning point and a big factor for her not getting elected.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  You know, like she kept saying, oh, what difference did it make?
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  Well, now she knows.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  But if I was even a sociopath, Machiavelli, if her ambassadors being overrun in a country and you can and you've already got like you said, you know, a bunch of special operations and a plane loaded 100 miles away ready to go take them out.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  Why wouldn't you be the hero and knock their ass out?
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  It's like this anti-American instinct to just cut some people off like you're nothing.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  Yeah, I would like to know that.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  I mean, I'd like to get inside their head and ask them why why wouldn't you, you know, what the military fast company there?
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  They changed it on a uniform three times.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  Why are you even worried about what they're wearing?
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  Just get them there.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  Well, without getting a secret classified stuff, I've been told by other green braids and stuff.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  How many one guy was in the plane loaded up?
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  I mean, how many groups are ready to come in there?
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  I believe they're that I know of.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  There was one that broke ground.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  I mean, they're in the air and there's actually one that was on the ground and got turned around.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  So there's two units that I know of that were there that night.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  I made it that night before everything was even over and he got told turned around.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  So that's like there's a storm.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  You run off in a river.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  You're calling your cell phone to the fire department.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  Come save me.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  They can come pull up and get you.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  We just sorry can't do it.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Yeah, pretty much they're like on the shoreline just watching you and then they walk away.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  I mean, again, it wasn't the military unit's fault.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  It's the the leader.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  No, I understand.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  They were playing.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  I have a mutiny.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  They only well that plus they don't really know what the situation is.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  They're just being told.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  You're loaded on a plane.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  You're sitting there.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  You don't know the power stone.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  Yeah.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  So again, you know, the pilots and a lot of guys, they knew what was happening.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  They they probably did what General Ham did in the that Admiral on the fleet did where they both got relieved.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  So, you know, we're going to go help and, you know, they both got relieved.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  And that's the next thing is that it wasn't a mess up, it goes up the chain, people are being relieved because they won't stand down.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  Why was it so important?
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  I was told by Colonel Shaffer a week after it happened.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  He got in a lot of trouble, but later country trip that they wanted those weapons to be shipped to Syria.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  And that's why they were standing down.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  Yeah, the weapon things.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  I never got involved with the weapon portion of it.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  I mean, you sit in some of the meetings, but, you know, they speak Arabic and I don't understand Arabic.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  So whatever they're talking about, I know like the biggest thing was the Stinger missiles, but we do that everywhere.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  We just go collect them as much as we can so they can't take down commercial airliners.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  But as for the small arm stuff, I never saw any of that personally.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  What a crazy time.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  You're looking at Hillary Clinton who probably watches a show sometimes.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  What's your views on Hillary and Obama just just in hindsight now?
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  You know, I just they're just extremely she's extremely untrustworthy.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  She lies about and just the fact she can lie to the family members at their receiving of their remains coming home and telling them,
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  say, oh, we're going to get this guy over this video.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  You know, I've talked to Rowan's mom, you know, I've talked to a lot of the family members and they say the exact same thing that they right there at.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  They lie to them right then and there about this video and they're going to get the guy and, you know, how could you even sit there and you know,
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  for a fact that it wasn't they got video footage.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  They got the security footage from the U.S. consulate. If it was a protest released, released the video.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  Well, sure, they made it about YouTube so they could censor.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  Yeah.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  Oh, some guy criticized your mom and had nothing to do with it.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  We're going to come back then and get into just all the different issues involved in the most important points you want to make.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  You kind of like the speech.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  You're going to be giving out Bastrop this weekend.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  It's sold out.

[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  They said it was a pretty accurate film and you watch that thing and it's just like, it's just crazy.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  Yeah, I mean, they did a really good job getting, you know, got everybody really involved, sucked everybody in and just, and they honored the four guys.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  I mean, they did a really good job with the movie.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  I mean, nothing can be 100% accurate, but I mean, like, if you were actually in that, it seems like you'd have at least flashbacks.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  Some bad things happen to my life. I don't like remembering them.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  But I mean, what was it like going in a big screen theater and watching something with a $200, $300 million budget, whatever it was about you?
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  Um, it was, it was very, very weird.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  I mean, like you said, we walked on the set and they had the, the annex set up and we walked to that front gate.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  It felt like we were right there at the annex in Benghazi. That's how I mean, it was really, really close.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  How'd they pull that off? Satellite images or?
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  Uh, yeah, in me, I had them change a lot of things. You know, Michael Bay.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  So you were an advisor on that?
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  Yeah, Michael Bay kind of complained a little bit, cost him like another hundred grand.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  It was a couple light bulbs, but, um, yeah, they did, they tried to get as accurate as they could.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  The concept wasn't, wasn't, um, too far off, but they did a really good job.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  I don't want to bring myself into the story, but it's one of the top stories in the country the last few weeks.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  They're deplatforming us, lying about what we've said.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  And then now they go, Oh, we took you off YouTube. We banned you streaming. Someone else did it.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  Well, now they're saying Jones is back on Facebook denying the band.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  So I knew this was coming next. Now they don't want other people grabbing our feeds or uploading our videos.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  They're now suppressing them.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  So this is true deplatforming where they're making me this unperson.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  And I know, because I talked to folks that were involved.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  I don't know how much you can get into, but the threats to families, to you guys in the year or two before you finally went public.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  And then I remember talking to a few guys off record and one on record.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  They said, look, it was actually the threats and intimidation is what made us finally go public.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  I mean, can you speak to that?
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  I mean, for us, um, directly.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  I mean, they can't really threaten us too much because we, they'd be sending guys like us for guys like us.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  So it's not, um, so threatening us ain't going to do too much.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  So I've heard a couple, a couple of the other guys that, uh, that said, you know, if you come out, you know, we're going to, obviously you're going to get fired.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  This and that are going to be a lot of pushback.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  Um, you know, just, just like the stand down order, they said, they're telling us that we're lying about the stand down order.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  But everything else that we ever talked about, you know, it was true, except for this one little incident with the stand down order.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  You know, there's, they just, I don't know what their, their big problem is why they're, what they're trying to hide.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  And the longer the firefight got, the more the stand down got, got exposed.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  Pretty much.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  I mean, we're there in direct contact for eight hours.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  I mean, direct, direct contact.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  And, you know, they got military bases that can send jets the 30 minutes away.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  I mean, you had the Italian, you got Suda Bay that's right there, uh, or Crete.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  You know, there's an air force base that's right there and why can't you send assets from there?
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  Describe the stand down without getting into any secret codes or anything.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  But as much as you can say, like what it was like, how many hours in what's happening, you finally get told stand down.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  It was within 15 minutes, 20 minutes of us getting ready to leave.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  So it happened fairly quickly.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  And it was Bob, the chief of base, you know, I got out of the vehicle and, you know, the longer you give the enemy, um, the chance to dig in,
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  they're going to dig in, which is going to make it a lot harder for us to push them out, which is going to make our lives in a lot more danger.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  So that's what I'm thinking.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  So I get out of the car, you know, I yell at the chief and I said, Hey, when you get over there now, we're losing the initiative.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  And he looks directly at me and they'll stand down.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  And so regardless of what any of the Adam shift people say, the orders stand down were given to us that night.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  It was given directly to me.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  So then why they, they sit there and they lie about it.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  I have no idea.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  And maybe just again, they're just trying to see why.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  Well, obviously there's a stand down because it, I mean, eight hours of pure stand down, why do they say 13 hours?
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  And that was the whole, the whole time that happened.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  Yeah.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  From the time we made, uh, from the time the consulate got contact until we actually went wheels up out of Benghazi contrast.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  I hate to just sit here and say how great Trump is.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  But I mean, it's night and day of the economy is coming back, taking care of the military, taking care of the borders, the people unifying the nation,
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  double the number of minorities supported than any other Republican.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  I mean, it's like, I look at Trump with all his energy and stamina next to Hillary falling down and lying.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  They say Trump's a liar.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  I've watched what he said and done.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  All he's done stole the truth.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  I mean, I just, it's night and day.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  Yeah.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  I mean, it's funny.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  You got these people, they say how he's racist.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  He's a liar.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  Well, give me example, how he's racist.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  Why is a liar?
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  What he has?
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  What has he not done yet that he said he's going to do?
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  I mean, it's a lot of things going to take time and it can happen overnight.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  Well, he's gotten a lot of it done.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  A lot of it done.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  I mean, he's got less than a year.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  I mean, look at the things he's changed.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  Look at the direction that other nations are taking towards us.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  Is it perfect?
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  No, it's not perfect, but you know what?
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  He's putting us back on top.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  And there's all these little cowards that sold the country out and thought they were powerful.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  I don't get how the universities and these elites, they literally, I used to hear this
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  like when I was a kid, I got sick of hearing, I didn't believe it.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  But now I know it's true.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  There is a literal hate of America and a hate of free market and a hate of success.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  I don't know how they train so many Americans to join that losing team.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  I don't get it.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  I think it goes back to the participation trophies.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  You know, you can still be a winner if you lose.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  That seems like that spot.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  Well, I didn't get into your background, but a few minutes on that.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  This is interesting to the listeners.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  Tell folks about your career, getting into the Marine Corps, all the combat and the contractor
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  of the CIA.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  What was that whole experience like?
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  It seemed, it was fun.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  I enjoyed it.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  You know, I joined the Marine Corps back in 95, got out as an E5 in 99 and, you know,
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  started contracting in 2003 and, you know, did it for, you know, good 10 solid years.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  A lot of people think that Benghazi happened and we all quit working.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  No, we all went, actually, I would, I did two more deployments.
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  I had to wait about six months for my lungs to heal from the fire going on the console.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  But, you know, I enjoyed the job.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  And, you know, not all of it was, you know, like, like the 13 hours movie.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  It was, you know, more mundane stuff, you know, kind of, you got to force yourself to
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  stay motivated.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  But, you know, I enjoyed the work.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  It was fun work.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  And if I could do it again, I probably would.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  You're saying that one part of the film that wasn't acting, you mean force yourself to
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  be motivated.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  I mean, I mean, like you were really exhausted.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  Well, I mean, just when, when stuff ain't going on, because there's a lot of times.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  Well, there's that thing where, where they've got Tonto falling asleep.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  Well, he does that anyways.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  He's, you know, he's a ranger.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  They do that.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  They sleep during, you know, tough times.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  So there's always Marines and army messing with each other.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  Oh yeah.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  All the branches.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  He was the only army guy there, right?
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  Yep.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  He was the only guy.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  That's, you know, that's like.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  So why is there a proclivity of mainly Marines and stuff in, in the CIA?
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  It's, it's not really.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  It's, it's a lot of those though, right?
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  Yeah, there is.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  There's a lot.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  I mean, there's a lot of SF guys that are doing it.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  You know, we had two sales, three Marines and a ranger.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  You know, you know, it just depends on the group of guys.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  You know, set like number of who gets what it's just, you just show up and that's who
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  you're with.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  So, you know, like we all knew each other for 30 days prior to the attack.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  And a lot of it's undercover, right?
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  You're like doing low keys security.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  It's all undercover.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  Yeah.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  But I mean, you guys stick out though in those countries.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  You mean I don't blend in.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  I don't look like a Merib.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  Well, another joke.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  Like I knew this one guy, like, you know, Tim Rames and he was like, he's like six, three,
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  six, four.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  And he just didn't fit into good in the hole.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  Yeah.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  Yeah.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  At all.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  But like you said, what's sad is I was told by people that have been over there.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  They said, Libya loved America.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  They wanted to be westernized.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  Gaddafi coming out of the dark and then he got set up.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  Let's take it.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  Gaddafi's a good guy.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  But why blow it all up and put al-Qaeda in charge?
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  Yeah.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  You know, he was after the 9-11, the first 9-11, you know, he really, he really saw
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  what was going on that, you know, the Bush junior wasn't messing around.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  So that's when he started turning and actually helping us go after the terrorist groups and
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  was helping us out.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  And, you know,
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  So why do you think Obama set him up then?
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.280]  You know, I think it might have been for a good cause initially because it really was
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:59.000]  the local 17th, 17th of March brigade.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.360]  That's how that's who was supposed to protect the consulate.
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.300]  They started the uprising in Benghazi initially.
[01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:07.600]  And that's kind of, it was just kind of where it started going.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:13.120]  And so it was mainly seemed like when I was paying attention, it was the locals, the civilians
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:15.240]  that were coming together and trying to push Gaddafi out.
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:18.240]  And, you know, he was using the airplanes against them, then NATO stepped in.
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:26.200]  You know, I think maybe they truly thought they could, I guess, make it a democratic
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:27.200]  nation.
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:31.280]  But now it's a failed state because we turned her back on them when, after we pretty much
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:35.560]  pulled out of Benghazi the whole, you know, like a week after the ambassador got killed,
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:40.720]  you know, a couple, I think 100,000 local Libyans or Benghazi came up, rose up against
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:45.320]  Anastasia and pushed them out of Benghazi by themselves because they didn't like the
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.320]  fact they killed the ambassador.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:48.680]  What was it like serving under Obama when he was the president?
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:52.000]  That would be a creepy feeling for me.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.360]  I think for us, as contractors working with the agency, it was a little bit different.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:58.240]  But you know, serving in the military, it definitely would have sucked.
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:02.800]  The rules of engagement was totally against you.
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:04.760]  You had to wait for somebody to physically shoot.
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:08.600]  They could be having their gun, bring their gun up as long as they don't pull the trigger,
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:10.120]  can't do anything.
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:12.840]  Unless they pull the trigger, then you can engage, but they pull the trigger, drop the
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:13.840]  gun.
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:14.840]  You're not supposed to engage them anymore.
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:16.240]  I remember reading that.
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.240]  That's it.
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:20.200]  So even if they shoot at you, you can't, if they drop the gun, you can't shoot back
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:21.200]  on them.
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.200]  Yeah.
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.920]  It's, and it was getting a lot of people killed.
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:29.080]  They were able to like, again, use buildings as cover, they shoot from the building and
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:30.080]  then they stopped shooting.
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:31.600]  You need a lot of bomb the building no more.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:35.280]  That's why a lot of the air support was pretty much useless because they had to wait for
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:39.120]  people back in the States to verify, yes, you can or no, you can't, they would have
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:42.560]  which reversed all the gains of the Middle East and cause the whole area of spring, it
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:43.560]  looks like.
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:44.560]  Yep.
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:45.560]  And then now look at what Mattis is doing.
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:46.560]  They've already freaking demolished.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.560]  We'll be back.

[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:01.840]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew

[01:59:51.480 --> 02:00:08.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:23.120]  Good morning.
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:42.440]  Let me in visa official pull over for inspection
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:50.000]  I'm sorry sir I can't do that pull over for inspection
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:01:02.520]  I'm willing you to die for your country. I'm gonna go right here right now
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:24.400]  Everybody this is Jack Silva Jack we train seals at Coronado so he knows the drill welcome to Club Med
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:35.400]  We need immediate assistance. We are overrun. Stay under attack. Let's go man. Stay under attack. Let's go! We gotta move!
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:50.400]  If you do not get here soon, we are all gonna die. You have a US ambassador at risk. The ambassador is in his safe haven. You are not the first responders. You are the last resort. You will wait.
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:58.400]  None of you have to go. But we are the only help they have.
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:19.400]  I called for his support. Now I came. You're not giving orders anymore. You're in my world now. We have 36 American lives to say.
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:42.400]  Tom Tidgen T-I-E-G-E-N is our guest on Dijon.com on Twitter for now at John Tidgen and he's here with us. My head's spinning because now Zuckerberg is in the New York Times.
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:53.400]  I'll cover this later saying reportedly suspects Alex Jones wanted to be banned from Facebook for the attention. So you banned me and make up stuff I said all over the internet.
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:03:12.400]  I'll take off 15 million subscribers total. 9 million on iTunes. And then you say I want to be banned. No I don't want to be banned. But I'll tell you this. I said this. I'm gonna keep saying what I'm saying even though you tell me I'll be banned if I do. So I've actually prepared for that.
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:23.400]  I love how they said they never want to censor anybody. But now they're all doing it John. And it's just getting crazier and crazier. Where do you think all this is going? I mean we're talking thousands of articles a day. I can't keep track.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:32.400]  I'm not this important. They are setting the precedent to shut down all conservatives which they now say ahead of the midterm. I think the president and Congress need to act.
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:44.400]  I mean I don't have, I got about half as far as you got. Maybe a fraction. But they do the same thing to me. And again I'm a small guy and I can tell.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:53.400]  Do you know who I saw first on Facebook and Twitter since they're the most? It was people showing your videos or you guys on the news. No, you guys have been the most censored.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:56.400]  Yeah I mean it's been going on since we started.
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:01.400]  That was the first question I was gonna ask and I'm interrupting. Let me start over. Talk about the censorship you've gone through.
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:10.400]  You know just for actually even for the movie. I mean the movie was totally censored. It was only in major theaters for like two weeks and they pulled it.
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:16.400]  Even though it was sold out every time they went in. But they don't want to show it like two times a day and that'd be it. They do that on purpose.
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:18.400]  They do it on purpose. Totally. I mean look.
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:25.400]  I remember when I went and saw it, it was totally packed about two weeks after. And I was like why is it only in two or three theaters? I remember that.
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:36.400]  Yeah. So they made sure I didn't want to really succeed. The course on iTunes and stuff like that is totally succeeding. I mean people have been really watching it since it came out on digital.
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:45.400]  I watched it twice. Stay there. I'm gonna come back and talk about the censorship. But I mean I remember people trying to share a meme of you guys or a video clip of you guys going no we were ordered to stand down on Megan Kelly.
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:55.400]  To our credit she did that or other. I mean that was there. And so that's experiencing our own veterans, our own heroes being censored by this dirt bag media back in 60.
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:27.400]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients and even support your immune system.
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:34.400]  Info Wars Life's cutting edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.

[02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:32.400]  The heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas. Transmitting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:50.400]  Don Tygens, our guest. John, t-i-e-g-e-n dot com. Remember folks' websites are more important than ever because we're not bitching and complaining here about all we're censored.
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:07:03.400]  You've got to go to infowars.com, you've got to go to newswars.com, you've got to go to John, t-i-e-g-e-n dot com and actually find out what's happening.
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:15.400]  Again, with 13 years of high profile security and force protection expertise within contract government agencies along with his military experience as the Marine Sergeant to bring a powerful thought-provoking and engaging presentation of his first-hand account of the Benghazi attacks to his audience.
[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:21.400]  You're traveling the country and you're one of these great guys and I'm like, hey, plug a book. Oh, I don't care, I'm not going to do that.
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:29.400]  Well, no, but tell folks what you're doing, how they get them to your college, their church, how do they get some real Americana injected right in their veins?
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:34.400]  You can do Instagram and get a hold of me, pretty much Instagram, Facebook or Twitter or the webpage.
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:35.400]  What's the best way? Plug them all.
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:39.400]  All of them. They're all John Tygen. Made it as easy as I possibly could.
[02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:40.400]  John Tygen.
[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:45.400]  So it's the easiest way to get hold of me is doing that.
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:47.400]  J-O-N-T-I-E-G-E-N.
[02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:53.400]  J-O-H-N-T-I-E-G-E-N dot com. Until I was trained in public school.
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:08:03.400]  We were getting into how you've been censured and the heroes of Benghazi and finally getting on Fox News and telling the truth about it and coming on this show as well with Chris Peranto and others.
[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:09.400]  I mean, you're not bitching and I know you guys don't want to do it, but talk about what you've been through trying to just tell your story.
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:22.400]  We just constantly push back. I'll see some posts, they'll be really big and then I post stuff about, that's either political or my opinion, and it just gets squashed.
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:28.400]  I mean, you can just see the big difference between the two. They can definitely, like I said, the shadow banning thing is happening constantly.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.400]  I get people that contact me and say, I haven't seen you posted in like two, three weeks.
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:37.400]  It's like, yeah, I usually post a couple of times a day. So even that just kind of tells you that you're being censored.
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:38.400]  That's a shadow man.
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:39.400]  Yep.
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:43.400]  But if you sit on a picture of just a sunset, suddenly 10,000 people respond.
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:44.400]  Yep.
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:51.400]  I sent a picture, I'd say something about, you know, Hillary or something like that and just nothing.
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:57.400]  Let's pull up Trump's tweet though. He put out the finally got Jack Dorsey listening where he said, it's illegal, the shadow banning.
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:00.400]  They now have computer sites that track it.
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:03.400]  And we know that Trump styled back 90 plus percent.
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:10.400]  My reporter Paul Watson is 97%. I'm kind of jealous because I was only 93% until they totally banned me.
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:16.400]  And it's not just Twitter doing it. 93% because you can see it on the graph. They just dial back 93%.
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:17.400]  Yeah.
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:19.400]  And it lets you hit a certain percentage.
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:20.400]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:27.400]  I mean, if you, yeah, it's, I don't know, because we'll do like, we'll do like boost a post and they'll come back.
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:30.400]  It's been denied because it has to do with politics.
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:36.400]  We have to appeal it and has nothing to do. It's just like a, I think we're helping to get a, because I got, I got a veteran nonprofit.
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:40.400]  So we're trying to help this veteran, you raise money for him for a burial.
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:42.400]  And it came back that it was a political post.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:45.400]  Well, that's what they said. Just so you know, you can pull this up.
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:52.400]  Project Veritas did internal stuff. The New York Times, YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter, where it's New York Times is liaison.
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:57.400]  And they go on the video as they go, who's the number? And I'm actually proud of this. I'm not that good.
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:00.400]  They go, well, who's the number one enemy? They go, Alex Jones.
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.400]  And they said, we pay everything he does. He's our enemy.
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:05.400]  Well, what else? Well, American flags and rednecks and veterans.
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:10.400]  And they just said, these dumbass veterans think they're talking, these are quotes, not me saying this.
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:14.400]  They think they're talking to people that we let them talk to 1%.
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:17.400]  I don't have you seen those videos, but it's sickening.
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:18.400]  It is.
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:21.400]  They think because you're trying to get somebody a prosthesis for their leg.
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:25.400]  And because you, what is it? They're jealous of people that are willing to serve.
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:29.400]  It's true. They have a inferiority complex. You know how many men are out there?
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:32.400]  We would think you're tough guys that don't like veterans or patriots or whatever.
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:37.400]  Or like if somebody's a, you know, a jujitsu champion, some punk in a bar goes, I'll kick your ass.
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:39.400]  It's like, but with the left, it's even worse.
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:43.400]  It's like these nerds have this hard on for veterans and heroes.
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:45.400]  And they just get off on suppressing it. It's true.
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:48.400]  They don't like that alpha male. I mean, they don't, they don't like that dominance.
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:51.400]  So that's the way they get their dominance.
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:54.400]  Exactly. It's a chicken. You know what way?
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:59.400]  A chicken crap dimensions of a coin I termed to like in this cyberspace to sit back and then
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:02.400]  you're somebody trying to defend their country and give them a future.
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:04.400]  They're not willing to die. You are.
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:10.400]  And they think of that as like, if they can shut you down and you either like these dumb ass veterans and rednecks
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:13.400]  and these info wars people, they don't even know.
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:16.400]  They think they're talking to people and you got to see these videos.
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:22.400]  I believe it. Yeah. There's something mentally wrong with them.
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:28.400]  Like I feel good knowing there's strong men and women and patriots dedicated to my country that are fighting for me.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:32.400]  I don't feel weak, but I see people that are stronger, stronger than me. I feel strong.
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:37.400]  Yeah. I mean, you can, you can also a lot of, I mean, you can censor a lot of good people on social media stuff.
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:41.400]  But what I do, I travel around so much you can't, you can't censor me when I'm traveling.
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:47.400]  So and that's where Antifa comes in. They think they can shut down the internet,
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:51.400]  but everybody's just going on the ground and we're winning there as well.
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:56.400]  Talk about that. Yeah. I mean, that's the more I travel, the more I get out there and more I still, I keep,
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:59.400]  I keep speaking and speak my mind and stuff. And then yeah.
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:03.400]  So just because you're shut down by my social media doesn't mean you shut me down.
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:06.400]  And that's why all the young people need to come to your events.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:10.400]  They need to get social media, their own platform, but also on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:15.400]  and they should all videotape you and stream it live and let them see shut all those kids down.
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:18.400]  And they'll shut some of them down, but that'll make them even more awake.
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:22.400]  Yeah, it will. I mean, how do we force multiply the youth?
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:28.400]  Get educated, man. They got to actually, you know, the sad thing is a lot of teachers nowadays are teaching the kids.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:35.400]  They're, they're going back to the anti-American. I mean, I just, we just helped get one teacher out of California fired last year
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:40.400]  for doing the same thing. Very much. He was, you know, talking, you know, saying military,
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:43.400]  if you join the military, you're the lowest of the low, you're the dumbest of the dumb.
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:49.400]  Well, does this teach you to realize majority of the Fortune 500 companies are veteran owned or started by veterans?
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:52.400]  But that's, that's the thing that's going on in schools nowadays.
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:55.400]  They're just doing everything they can to bash America. And these are the school teachers.
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:13:01.400]  So you got to pay attention to what your kids are being taught in school if you really want to change the direction.
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:04.400]  I mean, they're, you know, they're teaching about the seven pillars of Islam,
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:06.400]  but they won't teach anything about Christianity.
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:10.400]  Oh my gosh, I used to hear this 10 years ago and I was never for radical Islam,
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:14.400]  but I thought it was high that they're teaching them in schools and making them go.
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:20.400]  And now there's videos and photos in, in, in Austria and in Sweden and in everywhere.
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:25.400]  And they make the kids go and actually bow down to Allah. They cover up the rapes.
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:29.400]  Finland said a 40 year old man could rape a nine year old. It says religion.
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:33.400]  I mean, I'm just like, why the red carpet to radical Islam?
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:37.400]  I have no idea. But again, it goes back to the parents being involved in their kids life.
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:42.400]  I mean, do you want to save this country? Get involved and don't just let the system teach them.
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:52.400]  I've been asking a lot of the questions here, but John, just looking at the state of the country and the censorship and what the Democrats are doing.
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:56.400]  I, they're calling for civil war. They're calling for violence. I know they've got anti-fa.
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:01.400]  We've had undercover people ourselves and others have reported training for this uprising to kill cops and military.
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:06.400]  And I know they're a bunch of wimps, but at the same time, they get enough people to do that can be very disruptive.
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:10.400]  I don't know if Trump and others really realize how serious a threat this is.
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:17.400]  It is. I mean, they're extremely violent. I mean, one day the conservative side, they're going to get end up getting violent.
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:20.400]  And that's what's going to get really scary.
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:27.400]  Because, you know, I think even people like people like me, the guys that I know, they don't want to have to get violent unless we have to get violent.
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:32.400]  I mean, we're going to wait till the last minute. And by the time that happens, it's going to be really scary.
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:38.400]  You know, anti-fa, they, they only go around pick on, you know, I wear make, make America great hat all the time.
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:41.400]  Nobody says a word to me. I don't know why, but.
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:51.400]  Oh, yeah, because you're a tough guy. That's the crazy. We watched them beat up a Hispanic guy with muscle dystrophy on his walker and he kicked their ass.
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:54.400]  Three of them. So that's what they actually banned us on Facebook for.
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:59.400]  Because there's a little Hispanic guy kicking these three white guys ass. They, they deleted that video.
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:07.400]  Yeah, it's because the archetypal image of the little Hispanic guy who is like partially paralyzed them beating him up and him fighting back.
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:10.400]  They can't deal with that. That's, it's over for them, but that's who they are.
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:14.400]  Yeah, it is. It's, they just pick on the, they pick on the week.
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:17.400]  And if they're in a big group, they really won't do it by themselves.
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:21.400]  I don't understand that. How as a man would you want to pick on the week? I don't even get that.
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:25.400]  I don't get that either. It's, yeah, I have no idea.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:31.400]  When we come back in the final segment, I'm going to give you the floor to like give us a presentation of the speech you're going to give.
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:36.400]  That's already on the overflow crowd and bass drop and how folks come and where do they go to sign up?
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:41.400]  If they want you to come speak to their college, their church, because you need to be in the mega churches. You need to be everywhere.
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:43.400]  Yes. Where do they go? What's the best website?

[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:47.400]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:55.400]  If you're 34, no tax, or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:22.400]  Supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word. You are the InfoWars.
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:37.400]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:52.400]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to. The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:19:07.400]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:51.400]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:20:16.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:38.400]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[02:20:38.400 --> 02:21:01.400]  The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but a learner. Now I am the master. Only a master of evil, Darth. Your power's a weak old man. You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:11.400]  Alright folks, John Tygan, one of the great patriot heroes, and he is a hero, Benghazi's here, but I'll tell you, physical courage, you're challenged with it, you do it.
[02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:19.400]  I think the courage of going public with the stand down is just as important with these other great men as what they did physically.
[02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:36.400]  He's a great testament. He's going to be speaking. Unfortunately, if I want to try to come up with my kids, I don't want to try to cheat, but I know it's filled up. Again, maybe we can have you back for an event where we get like a conference hall, like a thousand people or something, and maybe get Tonto Peranto out here as well, because I've been thinking about that.
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:43.400]  We should do more of these alive events. Like you said, they're suppressing us in cyberspace. The answer is get out physically on the ground.
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:50.400]  Get out publicly, get out and get, you know, boots, where the boots meet the ground. I mean, that's how it's going to start, especially for the conservative side.
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:58.400]  Well then, I'm not going to procrastinate. Before you leave, let's pick some dates a few months out for you to come in, and some of your other crew will get them in here.
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:06.400]  And let's have an event, and then I'll donate half the proceeds to the veterans group of your choice.
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:14.400]  Okay, I can do that. Because I used to do events 15 years ago with like 3,000 people. I just quit doing it because they mess with them so bad the left does.
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:19.400]  But I think if it's a veterans event and you guys are running and I promote it, I think it'll be left alone.
[02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:27.400]  Yeah, I think I've only had one going to do a speaking event at one college where they kind of, they kind of protest a little bit. It wasn't, but it wasn't bad.
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:32.400]  But there's still that last thing for veterans and people want, there's still a little bit of respect left.
[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:36.400]  So how do we leverage that to save the country?
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:46.400]  The biggest thing, I mean, just the media, they just, they really demonize the military. I mean, they issue all the, pretty much anything that's bad happens, they'll push that out more than anything that they do good.
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:47.400]  Oh, I know.
[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:50.400]  You know, so it's trying to turn that mindset of...
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:58.400]  I gotta tell you, everybody I've met, especially combat veterans, are the best people in business in life. They don't screw you over. They show up when they say they're going to do it.
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:06.400]  You know, you got a problem with your house, leaking at 2am, you call your buddy, you know, he shows up. I mean, it's really true that our vets are great people.
[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:15.400]  Yeah, we, you know, we're band of brothers who stick together as much as possible. So it's a good, good organization to be part of.
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:23.400]  I just got a message from high level folks in the government confirming the coordinated decision to ban Info Wars was personally made by Zuckerberg.
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:30.400]  That's in the New York Times right now, too, that he said, I wanted to be banned. No, I knew they were going to ban ahead of the midterms.
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:35.400]  So I didn't muffle my voice to kiss their ass and not get banned.
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:38.400]  They don't like it when you don't do that. They want you to be in line with them.
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:43.400]  Well, let me just tell a little Zuckerberg something and let me tell Jack Dorsey something at Twitter.
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:53.400]  You went on Hannity. No off air. You asked him to talk to the president. We're not going to shadow band because you've been doing it. Get the newsflash. I wrote help write the Adams reports once the president three weeks ago.
[02:23:53.400 --> 02:24:02.400]  And I'm writing a new report this weekend that's going to the president and I'm going to be talking to high level folks in the government as soon as I got off air at 2 30 today.
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:05.400]  So you guys think you're doing this flat footed. You're not.
[02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:09.400]  I mean, you think we're flat footed. We're not. And so we're going to be talking about what you're doing.
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:16.400]  I'm actually scared because I'm not that good of a guy. I mean, I'm not perfect. I'm not that strong. And I'm really freaked out that it's us at the tip of the spear.
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:19.400]  Exposing all this Jesus. I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:21.400]  Well, it also takes your audience to do the pushback as well.
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:24.400]  Well, it's that's what they fear. Exactly. It's the audience.
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:32.400]  Yeah, everybody has to push back. That's one difference between how Antifa is doing what they're doing because they're actually they are grouping together and they're going and doing.
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:35.400]  Of course, they're violent protest violent group, but they're doing it together.
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:38.400]  The same thing. We need to come together and start pushing back.
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:43.400]  They say in the New York Times that I called him a genetically engineered sociopath.
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:47.400]  It was a joke video, but he's a guy worth $88 billion.
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:50.400]  And the guy looks like a robot. It's a robot meme.
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:59.400]  I made a joke off other memes and read what was in the, you know, quotes at the bottom and they turned that into I called him an android.
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:01.400]  So I deserve to be banned in the New York Times.
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:02.400]  That's what I'm reading during the breaks.
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:05.400]  Like, dude, you're a public figure worth $88 billion.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:10.400]  You're going to ban me because he's actually he's going, he called me an android.
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:11.400]  I'm banning him.
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:14.400]  Maybe he went into a safe space after that, too.
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:17.400]  Exactly. I mean, like, dude, you're worth $88 billion.
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:20.400]  Like you're worried. I called you an android. It's an internet meme.
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:23.400]  Yeah, that's sad. That is sad.
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:26.400]  Yeah, these people just can't, you know, they take everything too personal.
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:27.400]  They can't take a joke anymore.
[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:29.400]  Have you ever had a chance to talk to Trump?
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:33.400]  I talked to him twice in person. No, three times.
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:35.400]  Yep. I think he's a down-to-earth guy. I mean, I like,
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:37.400]  Well, he respects people that are willing to put on the line.
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:38.400]  He loves Trump.
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:39.400]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:41.400]  So what'd he say to you? I mean, unless it was off record.
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:44.400]  Um, yeah, everything I talk about is really never off record.
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:47.400]  But no, he's a, you know, he just, you know, thanked us for our service.
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:48.400]  What we did have been gauzy and, uh,
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:50.400]  Let me guess, you said you're a real man.
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:52.400]  We need more people like you. We love you. America loves you.
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:53.400]  Pretty much. Yeah.
[02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:55.400]  Yeah. I mean, he's, he's always a home.
[02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:57.400]  Every time I met him, he's a pretty humble guy.
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:25:58.400]  That's what Trump's like.
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:00.400]  He's like, listen, I'm just trying to fix things.
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:03.400]  I'm glad there's strong people out there and let's just do it together.
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:06.400]  It's going to be hard. Let's do it. Let's just be men for our families.
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:08.400]  Yeah. He doesn't, it's me. What he's doing doesn't,
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:10.400]  I don't, I don't believe he's thinking for himself.
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:12.400]  I think he's thinking for the future of his kids and his family.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:14.400]  He's real. That's why they're so damn scared of him.
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:16.400]  I believe he's lost $2 billion doing this.
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:18.400]  Yeah. And they can't buy him off.
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:20.400]  And the more they mess with him, he's got that Scott at him.
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:22.400]  He just doesn't give in.
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:25.400]  Nope. He doesn't. He just fights back even harder.
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:28.400]  Do you imagine what it'd be like if we didn't have him right now?
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:33.400]  Um, we'd be a failure with a one. We'd be totally screwed.
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:37.400]  I mean, we, we definitely wouldn't be a thriving economy. That's for sure.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:39.400]  She had been selling.
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:43.400]  Again, I don't get how if you run America, why do you have it out to get it?
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:45.400]  Like the left does, you go to these meetings, I've covered them.
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:49.400]  We've said undercover people, they literally like F America, screw it, bring it down.
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:54.400]  And then they got like skinny jeans, like I'm wearing $80 jeans or we're in $200 jeans.
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:56.400]  They got $1,000 phones. I got a $500 phone.
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:01.400]  They got $200 shoes. I got $100 shoes. I got $1,000 watch. They got a 10,000.
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:06.400]  They're like grabbing Mercedes. It's like they got rich off America and they hate it.
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:08.400]  They don't want other people to succeed like they did.
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:12.400]  They want, they want people to pay to stay where they were or where they are, I guess.
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:13.400]  I mean, they know that's it.
[02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:16.400]  Again, their fear of the people to succeed like they did.
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:18.400]  Well, thanks to guys like you.
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:20.400]  We beat Hillary and America's got a fighting chance.
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:22.400]  But I'm telling you, it was only a beachhead.
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:25.400]  Let's do five more minutes on the side and talk about final comments from you.
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:28.400]  We're going to be talking to young people and others about this week and other events briefly.
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:30.400]  I didn't plug last hour, folks.
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:35.400]  There are thousands of articles a day, lies everywhere, never showing what we said.
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:39.400]  It's all lies, just like they do against Trump.
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:41.400]  I'm all in. I'm not worried about this.
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:42.400]  I just got to be right with God.
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:47.400]  But if you want to financially support us so that we can hire more reporters and expand what we're doing
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:53.400]  and do events with patriots like the gentlemen here with us right now, like John info or store.com.
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:58.400]  We're running the stop the bullies fight back against Internet censorship special.
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:07.400]  That is one of the biggest specials ever on all of the great supplements, all the great T shirts, the books, the films, whatever you do.
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:10.400]  Realize this isn't one more channel of entertainment.
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:17.400]  This is the channel they want shut down because they know who I've been talking to today.
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:21.400]  They know and they're crapping their breaches right now.
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:25.400]  So figure that out, ladies and gentlemen, or we lose.
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:27.400]  And hey, that doesn't matter with me. It's between me and God.
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:30.400]  As long as I do the right thing, that's all I'm worried about.
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:32.400]  But I'm telling you, this is your choice right now.
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:34.400]  Fight the bullies. Save the Internet.

[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:54.400]  And then we've got Joe Gilbert and the founder of judicial watch Larry Caiman coming on to talk about what's unfolding with all of that.
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:56.400]  So this is a crazy time to be alive.
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:34:05.400]  But but finishing up with our guests, John Tig, who's here with us, John T I E G E N dot com.
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:13.400]  You've got an event coming up in Bass Drop just any other points you'd like to make or just in three or four minutes what you say to young people are veterans groups.
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:17.400]  When you talk to them, what's the main message of Americana?
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:20.400]  You know, like we're going out there to restore an F4 fan.
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:22.400]  I mean, oh, from the Vietnam era.
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:25.400]  So that's the biggest thing that they're trying to do out here.
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:29.400]  You know, I go out and I tell the firsthand account what happened that night in Benghazi.
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:30.400]  I don't know.
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:31.400]  I don't sugarcoat anything.
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:41.400]  But you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of teamwork, overcoming adversity, you know, leadership from the bottom up, you know, and just always moving forward, always fighting through no matter what happens.
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:44.400]  You can't just stop and dwell on things that go wrong.
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:47.400]  So, you know, I've been doing that.
[02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:50.400]  And, you know, I also got my own veteran nonprofit.
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:53.400]  I go around and I do a lot of speaking to other veterans.
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:57.400]  And again, just telling the story out there and trying to get other veterans to tell their story.
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:02.400]  Because a lot of the healing, a lot of the PTS portion is a lot of guys, they don't talk about what they went through.
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:07.400]  So the more you can talk about what you went through, what's what you're what you're going through.
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:08.400]  It's you start to heal.
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:09.400]  It's a healing process.
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:13.400]  And for me, going out there and talking about happening at night, it's very therapeutic.
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:17.400]  So I do a lot of speaking for a lot of veterans and stuff like that.
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:26.400]  And, you know, is it accurate to say PTSD, a lot of this, you get ratcheted up to the superhuman level of like your everything's slowed down, everything's focused.
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:28.400]  And then you get back in regular life.
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:34.400]  And like, I'm not gonna say I PTSD, but doing this all the time, I feel great and have tons of energy when I'm working.
[02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:37.400]  But as soon as I'm not working, I feel like a retarded zombie.
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:39.400]  And that's my own personal experience.
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:42.400]  Is that like, or what spectrum is that?
[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:47.400]  You know, the thing about PTSD, it's all different forms of things that hit you with the PTS.
[02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:49.400]  I don't usually use the D because it means not a disorder.
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:52.400]  You know, you're just, it's just a stress.
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:54.400]  So what's it like then?
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:55.400]  I mean, explain.
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:59.400]  So what is it when I feel awake and alive when I'm working, but now when I don't, I feel like a dead zombie.
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:01.400]  And my dad says, he's a doctor.
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:03.400]  He says, well, that's PTSD, but I don't know that is.
[02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:07.400]  It could be a form of a little bit of PTSD, you know, you're so overstressing yourself.
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:10.400]  You get your drilling going constantly, then you crash.
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:12.400]  Sure. So, but what's the archetypal?
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:14.400]  What's the standard PTSD?
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:16.400]  Like for somebody that's been in heavy combat like you,
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:20.400]  I don't think there's really a standard because it affects each guy differently.
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:22.400]  No matter what, I mean, you can get extreme.
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:24.400]  Don't some people ramp up and get even more aggressive?
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:26.400]  They do. They can get extremely aggressive.
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:29.400]  You can go the wholly opposite, the totally opposite direction.
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:34.400]  You can be just totally antisocial. I mean, it's, there's no one, one cure fits all.
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:38.400]  That's why there's, like, I've had a couple of guys come to me that we've helped.
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:42.400]  He said, you know, I've hit, you know, I've went to four court, four places that helped me with PTSD.
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:43.400]  It didn't work.
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:45.400]  I was like, yeah, dude, you cannot just go.
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:46.400]  You have to keep going, keep trying.
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:47.400]  So he finally found one.
[02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:52.400]  We sent him to two of them and he finally found one that actually worked for him.
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:55.400]  Chris Gall got killed by a guy that was PTSD.
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:59.400]  The Marine, you know, he had a, and it was another one that.
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:02.400]  That whole thing was a little, it was smelling.
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:06.400]  So, so in your experience, just helping folks, PTSD, what is that?
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:09.400]  Isn't it helping other people and having a mission?
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:11.400]  I mean, what's the main thing that helps people that have PTSD?
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:15.400]  I think it's having something to do feel like you're involved in something.
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:17.400]  You've got to have a new mission.
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:18.400]  Yep. You got to have a new mission.
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:19.400]  You're doing something better than yourself.
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:21.400]  And I think that really helps.
[02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:24.400]  And again, the guys that go out, then they start talking about it.
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:25.400]  And they'll see the effects.
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:29.400]  I mean, I've had a lot of Vietnam veterans that come up since that sense.
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:31.400]  I heard your story and you're able to talk about it.
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:34.400]  I started opening up and I was able to talk about it, but they, but they're getting,
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:38.400]  they actually started getting involved with helping other veterans since then.
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:42.400]  So again, it's, it's just being involved in something that's better than yourself.
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:44.400]  I think that really helps with the PTS.
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:45.400]  Because that's it.
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:47.400]  You commit yourself and then the mission is taken away.
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:51.400]  And then now you're in this pathetic system where a bunch of jellyfish,
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:53.400]  you've got to have a new mission.
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:55.400]  You've got to find something to do.
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:58.400]  Well, that's, that's what I found just with people that I know that have been veterans
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:02.400]  and stuff, as long as they have a mission, they're shining and they're great people.
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:08.400]  But it's like, you can't go to those heights of human endurance and focus and then just go back to mediocrity.
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:11.400]  No, it's, it's, it's, it's really difficult.
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:15.400]  Again, it's, you just got to get out and do something.
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:17.400]  Well, you're a tough guy.
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:19.400]  Have you gone through PTSD?
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:22.400]  I'm pretty sure I got, I got a form of PTSD and TBI.
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:25.400]  How does it manifest with you if you don't mind me asking?
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:28.400]  Um, short fuse, extreme anger.
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:34.400]  Got little anxiety here and there sometimes, but yeah.
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:36.400]  Showed you short fuse.
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:37.400]  Like you don't even know what it does.
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:41.400]  It just suddenly you're like, and it goes from something that little tiny,
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:44.400]  you make that little tiny thing to an extreme big thing when it's really not.
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:45.400]  Well, that's the thing I've noticed.
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:46.400]  This is my own issues.
[02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:48.400]  I don't say a PTSD, but I have anger issues.
[02:38:48.400 --> 02:38:51.400]  Big stuff doesn't affect me at little stupid things.
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:53.400]  And it's weird.
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:56.400]  So yeah, the littlest thing will set you off and for the big thing, like,
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:59.400]  yeah, I know, whatever.
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:04.400]  So I love America.
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:06.400]  America has been a special nation.
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:10.400]  We've done a lot of big things and I, I just don't give people that hate America.
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:12.400]  I don't understand what their problem is.
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:15.400]  Just quantifying that as a patriot, a real American.
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:20.400]  Why do you think these people, I guess they just feel inadequate because
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:23.400]  America is so powerful, the spirit of it.
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:25.400]  Why don't they join with it?
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:27.400]  I don't understand that.
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:28.400]  I don't either.
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:35.400]  I don't, I don't think I really want to understand them, but I just, why could,
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:39.400]  if you hate the country so much, why don't you go to another country you agree with
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:43.400]  and go live there and then come back and tell us how much you still hate it.
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:44.400]  But that's not it.
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:46.400]  They want to dominate us.
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:51.400]  Yeah, they want to, you know, it's like going, I hate to do it to the Muslim community
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:53.400]  because not all of them are bad, but you got a lot of Muslims.
[02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:57.400]  They leave their country that they're suppressed that and then they, they come here
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:01.400]  and they start setting up Sharia, trying to do Sharia law in their own neighborhoods.
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:02.400]  You know, it's kind of like.
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:03.400]  Exactly.
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:06.400]  You had the proviso like always did, even though you've almost been, I don't,
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:10.400]  I love everybody, but the thing you can't say is that there's no Gones zones
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:14.400]  or that they cut women's generals off or they throw gays off buildings.
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:17.400]  And the gays go F you, we want to be thrown off buildings.
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:19.400]  And it's like, it's fundamentally sick.
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:22.400]  It is that we're just supposed to roll a red carpet out.
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:26.400]  When if I couldn't go to Saudi Arabia and preach the Bible, I couldn't go to.
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:27.400]  No.
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:30.400]  And then I'm, but I'm supposed to be tolerant to intolerant people.
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:31.400]  No.
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:33.400]  No, it's, it's, it's ridiculous, man.
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:38.400]  I mean, why, if you'd like it, why come somewhere new and change it to where you just left?
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:40.400]  It makes no sense at all.
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:43.400]  Or why make something worse than what it is?
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:44.400]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:45.400]  I know brown people.
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:46.400]  I know white people.
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:47.400]  I know black people.
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:48.400]  They love liberty.
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:49.400]  I love them.
[02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:51.400]  But don't come here and try to make me submit.
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:55.400]  I mean, I was in a restaurant on Monday, Cheesecake Factory, my $3, my wife,
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:58.400]  and income women in full Burkus.
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:01.400]  And I literally had an anxiety attack.
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:03.400]  My daughters are like, what is that?
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:07.400]  And it's women in Halloween costumes and beekeeper outfits.
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:08.400]  And I don't mean that meanly.
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:11.400]  And I mean, I'm sitting here.
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:12.400]  This is enslaved women.
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:16.400]  This is the, and then the feminists are telling me submit to this.
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:18.400]  But if daddy wears the pants, it's bad.
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:20.400]  Or if daddy loves Jesus, it's bad.
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:21.400]  But this is good.
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:25.400]  It's like, why did the feminist sign onto this?
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:26.400]  I don't know.
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:30.400]  They're going backwards enough forward.
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:36.400]  How did they get them like baby ducks to imprint on hating America?
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:38.400]  False narratives.
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:40.400]  And that's why they want to censor us.
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:42.400]  And you've given us the answer, John.
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:44.400]  The answer is be involved online.
[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:45.400]  Great.
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:47.400]  Everyone has to hit the streets.
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:50.400]  If it's going to a nursing home with your dog and let no people pet it or play the piano,
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:54.400]  just interfacing with real people, doing real things, going to a veterans group,
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:58.400]  supporting people, you know, whatever it is, just get involved.
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:41:59.400]  Yeah.
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:00.400]  Get out there and get involved.
[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:01.400]  That's, that's how you're going to push.
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:04.400]  Because again, you're being censored online no matter what you do.
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:07.400]  So get on the ground and you'll make more of an impact on the ground.
[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:09.400]  And you will probably in social media nowadays.
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:13.400]  All right, John, we appreciate you coming in here today.
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:15.400]  We're going to come back and cover the New York Times.
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:18.400]  We got two hours of this, but this is just some of the insanity.
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:21.400]  They got three New York Times people here, a Pulitzer Prize winner.
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:24.400]  It means like an iron cross from Hitler trying to get me and my family.
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:28.400]  We're going to play you some of this insanity on the other side and more straight ahead.
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:32.400]  John coming up, it's already sold out in Bastrop this weekend.
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:39.400]  But people can sign up at John, J-O-H-N-T-I-E-G-E-N.com.
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:41.400]  You can go there and find, get you to speak at their group.
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:42.400]  Hey, no BS.
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:45.400]  I want to get, pay you guys, take care of you guys, bring your whole families.
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:47.400]  Let's do a big event in the next few months and awesome.
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:48.400]  Yeah, sounds good to me.
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:49.400]  God bless you.
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:50.400]  Sir, thank you.
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:51.400]  Thank you.
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:43:05.400]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:10.400]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:11.400]  It's made in the USA.
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:18.400]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the informal war.
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:21.400]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:24.400]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:30.400]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:40.400]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:47.400]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:50.400]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:44:19.400]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfowarsLife.com.
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:42.400]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:55.400]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:39.400]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:55.400]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:37.400]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:55.400]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:24.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:39.400]  You know, I'm going to give people a big secret here. The reason I don't talk to the Washington Post and the New York Times or be in Hollywood movies is I always feel good.
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:48.400]  I always feel strong. But when I'm with them and I interface with them, I feel like I'm dying.
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:48:00.400]  And they had this Elizabeth Williamson woman who came to a TRO last week while they were trying to take my kids off fake filings that I endangered kids with no proof.
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:07.400]  So that's how bad this has gotten, all the fake YouTube stuff that Zuckerberg thinks I'm doing on purpose.
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:15.400]  In a big New York Times article today where he had messy coordinated a meeting, my unpersoning.
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:22.400]  And this lady sits here and says, I want to hear your truth. So I say, okay, I'll meet with you. I'll talk to you, but I'm going to record it.
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:26.400]  And we have her saying I can record it. They'll probably follow a thing and say I can't.
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:37.400]  And once I met with her, she went, no one blocked anybody to get into Trump's inauguration.
[02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:47.400]  And I'm not an elitist. I don't think about, oh, I have the golden ticket to get in right at the front of the VIP, right where the president is. I just thought, I'm going to get into the mall a mile away down here where I am.
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:54.400]  It turned out I was staying at the same condo as Ted Cruz next door to him for days.
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:59.400]  I'm staying with all these former CIA and Navy SEAL commandos, just like the guy we had in here.
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:04.400]  And I'm staying at this thing right next door. I'm leaving the last day on Saturday after the Friday inauguration.
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:10.400]  And there's your Ted Cruz walks out. That's been deleted off my YouTube now, but I'm sure somebody's got a copy.
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:13.400]  That's what I mean. True stranger than fiction.
[02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:22.400]  So she looks at me and she goes, I was there that day. I didn't see any anti-fair black lives matter blocking anybody from getting in.
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:31.400]  And she sat back and smiled like it was going to stir me up.
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:37.400]  Now you think about that. And then she sent me a text message and I blocked her at that point after she'd been here last week.
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:43.400]  Saying, I talked to my colleague to talk to you. He didn't see any anti-fair.
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:48.400]  Well, he talked to me inside the inauguration. No, you know what, Sherlock?
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:54.400]  It's these semantical games. And I realized they know they're frauds. They know they're liars.
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:50:04.400]  And they know we have a soul. So they keep engaging us, playing that game.
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:09.400]  Hillary Clinton is going to win 98% New York Times front page for three months.
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:13.400]  The moon has made a cheese.
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:19.400]  And that's it. They know they're gaslighting because I would never sit there and tell somebody a lot.
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:23.400]  I mean, I would never sit there and like try to make them feel bad.
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:26.400]  But they will do it all day long.
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:29.400]  So here's a few of the clips. The whole interview is coming out next week.
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:39.400]  They're doing some fake profile with the most crazy made up crap you could imagine trying to bring us down.
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:43.400]  And the first thing is she's like, well, what happens if you get taken off iTunes and stuff?
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:45.400]  How will it affect your business?
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:51.400]  And I said, I'm a free market guy. I'm all for money making, but it's not a business. It's a revolution.
[02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:59.400]  Our goal is to change the world. It's not to have a business or I would have joined the establishment.
[02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:01.400]  I just wanted money.
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:05.400]  And then she looks at me and she goes, what about your relationship working for RT?
[02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:11.400]  And she said it like she had just, you know, played the ace of spades.
[02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:14.400]  I've never worked for RT. I've never taken money from RT.
[02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:19.400]  I've been on them like four years other than I think Max Kaiser has a show on there. I've been on there twice.
[02:51:19.400 --> 02:51:22.400]  But that's the thing. They know I'm not a Russian agent.
[02:51:22.400 --> 02:51:27.400]  They're globalist agents of Carlos Slim, the Mexican kingpin.
[02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:35.400]  That's all they've got to project because they know they're done is a confidence game.
[02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:40.400]  I've turned down thousands and thousands of interviews since I talked to this lady,
[02:51:40.400 --> 02:51:45.400]  but I just been victorious over a fake temporary training order to take my kids.
[02:51:45.400 --> 02:51:49.400]  She was there. I said, well, if I report this, she'll put it out. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[02:51:49.400 --> 02:51:53.400]  Of course she won't now. It's a profile. It's all deception because with them,
[02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:59.400]  these are, in my view, heartless, soulless people who see someone who has a soul
[02:51:59.400 --> 02:52:07.400]  and if they can dominate me or you or America, they can be a real boy.
[02:52:07.400 --> 02:52:13.400]  So I thought I'd play some of this sickening audio.
[02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:19.400]  The whole thing comes out next week with articles and videos of this New York Times reporter
[02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:26.400]  and her cohorts who I saw in the courtroom looking at me like I was the enemy of humanity
[02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:31.400]  when they worked for the Nazi collaborator George Soros and Carlos Slim and the rest of it
[02:52:31.400 --> 02:52:36.400]  and Hillary Clinton, the pedophile Maven. And no matter what they do, we're winning.
[02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:40.400]  And their whole censorship of us is blown with their face. It's a beautiful time.
[02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:44.400]  But here's a few of the clips of what's coming up next week. Here it is.
[02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:49.400]  How did you first come into contact with Roger Stone?
[02:52:49.400 --> 02:52:56.400]  Oh, I guess Roger Stone. I was looking at JFK of him like almost five years ago
[02:52:56.400 --> 02:52:59.400]  and he was speaking and I met him there.
[02:52:59.400 --> 02:53:05.400]  And is he involved in the business or I know you've had him on the show a lot.
[02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:09.400]  Was he sort of your entree to Trump? Did he help facilitate?
[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:12.400]  Robert Mueller has actually asked over a dozen people about that.
[02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:18.400]  And I find that, talk about police state, you know, asking about Alex Jones and Roger Stone
[02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:21.400]  and what is Roger Stone, what does Roger Stone do?
[02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:27.400]  It is the same thing he did when he had a contract with Fox for five years for like $55,000 a year
[02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:33.400]  where someone is a contributor and I'm saying he had, I mean, Fox has hundreds of people
[02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:37.400]  as contributors and they pay him like $55,000 a year.
[02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:42.400]  I'm not going to get into Roger's, I promise, I try to give people answers that it's like real data.
[02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:45.400]  I mean, like describe your relationship with Roger Stone.
[02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:51.400]  There's nothing James Bondy, there's nothing sexy.
[02:53:51.400 --> 02:54:00.400]  I knew him as a JFK writer and I had him on a few times, you know, some of the shows covering JFK book he wrote.
[02:54:00.400 --> 02:54:03.400]  And then I forgot that, I had him on years ago.
[02:54:03.400 --> 02:54:07.400]  And then I met him and ran into him at a JFK event.
[02:54:07.400 --> 02:54:12.400]  So he was your entree to President Trump when President Trump as a candidate came on the show?
[02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:15.400]  Yeah, I mean, it was a, it was still going on the show.
[02:54:15.400 --> 02:54:17.400]  Yeah.
[02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:18.400]  Okay.
[02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:22.400]  Hey, can I ask you about your work for RT? Do you still do stuff for them?
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:24.400]  I have never worked for RT.
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:25.400]  Russia today?
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:26.400]  No, never worked for RT.
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:28.400]  Well, done videos for them?
[02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:30.400]  I have not done videos for them.
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:31.400]  Okay.
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:34.400]  Done videos, you mean have I been a guest on a TV show?
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:35.400]  Yeah.
[02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:36.400]  Yeah, that's not working for them.
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:40.400]  That's not, I mean, you realize people are going to hear all this.
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:41.400]  Yeah, of course.
[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:44.400]  I mean, it's going to be a whole documentary just out of this, man.
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.400]  Call it, How to Murder Truth.
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:51.400]  Because we can sit there and show everything I've said, everything I've done, back it up.
[02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:54.400]  And I've never been paid anything by RT.
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:55:00.400]  I've never had to pay for trips.
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:07.400]  It's just like when I've been on the BBC or CNN or Fox News or Japanese television,
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:15.400]  I have no, I have no financial or a relationship with RT, nothing.
[02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:16.400]  Yeah.
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:18.400]  Vice has been here twice.
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:20.400]  Didn't work for them either.
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:24.400]  I mean, hey, I'm sure what work have you done with The New York Times?
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:27.400]  So in the New York Magazine, they had an essay.
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:29.400]  But you understand, I do not work for you either.
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:31.400]  Oh, really?
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:33.400]  No, it's the same kind of question.
[02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:35.400]  I've interviewed by The New York Times.
[02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:39.400]  Either The New York Times talked to me on the street probably a hundred times.
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:43.400]  I've been interviewed by The New York Times probably 15 times.
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:45.400]  I've had him here a couple of times.
[02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:46.400]  It's been like a day with him.
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:48.400]  None of what I said got in the paper.
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:56:00.400]  What would happen if Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, who am I missing, Twitter, banned you from those platforms?
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:05.400]  What would happen to your business?
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:07.400]  What happened in my first amendment?
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:08.400]  What would happen to mine?
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:09.400]  What would happen?
[02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:10.400]  Well, it's prior restraint.
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:11.400]  So here's the deal.
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:13.400]  What was the place just banished that I've been on?
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:14.400]  Like, to the top?
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:16.400]  Uh, Spreaker or Stitcher.
[02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:18.400]  I've been on that since 2013.
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:19.400]  Yeah.
[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:20.400]  We went and looked.
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:23.400]  And we were always in the top 20 on there.
[02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:27.400]  Um, and so the marketplace of ideas, I'm on competition with Joe Rugged.
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:29.400]  He's the biggest podcast in the world right now.
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:31.400]  We were routinely better than Joe.
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:32.400]  Okay.
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:33.400]  On that platform.
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:34.400]  So I go, oh, God, this guy's super popular.
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:36.400]  We can't do more hearing this.
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:37.400]  What he actually says.
[02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:41.400]  So it was a virtue to say, well, he said, we've taken them off, you know, because they bully.
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:44.400]  Well, I had lawyers in here just a few days ago.
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:48.400]  So we're looking at the media that we're going to have to sue because we can't just sit there
[02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:52.400]  and have people never even show what we said or say we're taking them off.
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:53.400]  Everybody else should take him off.
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:54.400]  He should be destroyed.
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:57.400]  So you're going to sue Stitcher for taking you off?
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:57:01.400]  I put him on notice today, but I am, I am, I am, I have to.
[02:57:01.400 --> 02:57:03.400]  This is the first amendment.
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:05.400]  We podcast, they just pick us up.
[02:57:05.400 --> 02:57:06.400]  We pay for the bandwidth.
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:09.400]  We do everything and then they get advertisements and money.
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:13.400]  So that doesn't really do anything to me.
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:17.400]  Even if they took me off all those deals, it just, it makes it, oh man, the thing you want even more,
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:25.400]  but it's in the mood to sell the idea to the finally de-platform me here with, with, with, with laws,
[02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:26.400]  law suits, whatever.
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:28.400]  That's the admission.
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:33.400]  And so that was last Friday before all this happened, that they're setting the precedent to de-platform us.
[02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:35.400]  So that's how pathetic this is.
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:39.400]  But they're bringing up relations with RT because I've been a guest on the show.
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:41.400]  It's just so un-American.
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:45.400]  It's so dirty, but it's what big pathetic rotting media does.
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.400]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:59:37.400 --> 02:59:39.400]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[02:59:39.400 --> 02:59:41.400]  It's so essential to spread the word.
[02:59:41.400 --> 03:00:08.400]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:00:08.400 --> 03:00:11.400]  The Washington Post and New York Times are all reporting the big exclusive.
[03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:20.400]  It's up on infowarstore.com that Mark Zuckerberg, Sunday afternoon, met with the big tech giants
[03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:21.400]  and admitted collusion.
[03:00:21.400 --> 03:00:24.400]  Wow, that'll be great antitrust information.
[03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:26.400]  To say that, I think Jones wants to be banned.
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:34.400]  No, what I said was, Zuckerberg, was that I don't think my users are dumb efforts and
[03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:41.400]  that I'm ready for the big challenge and that I'm not going to curtail what I say about
[03:00:41.400 --> 03:00:47.400]  radical Islam throwing gays off buildings or anybody else for the rules you've put in
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:50.400]  place that are anti-American and draconian.
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:53.400]  Now, because this is the New York Times, it may not even be true.
[03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:56.400]  This is what the New York Times is reporting, so it's probably the opposite.
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:58.400]  Zuckerberg probably said the opposite.
[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:06.400]  Mark Zuckerberg personally made decision to ban info wars billionaires now citing what
[03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:08.400]  you can see and read.
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:15.400]  The New York Times report confirms that Mark Zuckerberg personally made the final decision
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:16.400]  to ban info wars.
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:19.400]  An article entitled Facebook banned info wars.
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:20.400]  Now what?
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:27.400]  Kevin Roos reveals late on Sunday after returning to his hotel room on a trip away from home,
[03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:33.400]  Zuckerberg made a decision he had hoped to avoid.
[03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:39.400]  The report adds that Facebook CEO got personally engaged and discussed info wars linked with
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:46.400]  other executives while speculating that Jones may have wanted to get banned to get the media
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:47.400]  attention.
[03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:49.400]  You already banned this.
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:51.400]  You already shadow banned this.
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:56.400]  Put us in a freaking Nazi gulag, dude, and then called us Nazis when I almost don't exist
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:01:58.400]  because of the Nazis.
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:01.400]  My kids are part Jewish asshole.
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:04.400]  You let these freaking ADL people call me a Nazi all day.
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:05.400]  I'm sick of it, man.
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:06.400]  I'm sick of it.
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:10.400]  I'm sick of your crap calling us Nazis, man, and Trump a Nazi.
[03:02:10.400 --> 03:02:12.400]  You know that's not true.
[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:20.400]  Zuckerberg initially considered whether info wars was being branded by partisan mob masses
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:22.400]  reported as post.
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:27.400]  This undoubtedly happened, but only after CNN had engaged in an intense lobbying campaign
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:29.400]  to have Jones banned.
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:34.400]  Zuckerberg decided to remove the info wars page entirely rather than just give the pages
[03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:35.400]  a strike.
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:39.400]  When he saw on the news that Apple had removed the info wars podcast.
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:41.400]  So it was a cascade had seen the news.
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:47.400]  Mr. Zuckerberg sent a note to his team confirming his own decision strikes against info wars.
[03:02:47.400 --> 03:02:49.400]  Mr. Jones would count individually.
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:51.400]  The pages would come down.
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:55.400]  The announcement arrived at 3 a.m. Pacific time.
[03:02:55.400 --> 03:02:57.400]  Wow, woke up at like 6 a.m. that happens.
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:03.400]  I guess right after this follows a revelation that Apple CEO Tim Cook personally took the
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:05.400]  decision to ban info wars podcast.
[03:03:05.400 --> 03:03:09.400]  Confirmation that both cook and Zuckerberg were involved underscores the stark reality
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:12.400]  that billionaires and John corporations that control the public.
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:16.400]  This course are now wielding more power for free space than governments.
[03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:20.400]  Alex Jones himself tweeted Friday should billionaires and these corporations get to decide
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:23.400]  what we say and what we read.
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:32.400]  I mean, folks, if you show Muslim articles, raping women from Germany, you get banned.
[03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:34.400]  So am I trying to get banned?
[03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:35.400]  No.
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:40.400]  Do I want to lose those pages that we built over years with 5 million likes?
[03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:41.400]  No.
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:44.400]  But am I upset I lost them?
[03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:45.400]  No.
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:48.400]  So I guess in a twisted way, you're right.
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:52.400]  I wanted to get you banned from engaging in censorship.
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:54.400]  Zucker, I don't care if you're worth $5 trillion.
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:57.400]  Don't f over freedom, dude.
[03:03:57.400 --> 03:04:01.400]  So they're trying to sell the idea of what they've done.
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:03.400]  This is an incredible moment in history right now.
[03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:05.400]  It's an incredible moment.
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:08.400]  And I'm just honored to be part of it personally.
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:10.400]  Everybody asked me how am I doing?
[03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:12.400]  I'm doing great.
[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:18.400]  But Mark Zuckerberg needs to know that the sleeping giant is awake and knows what's going on.
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:21.400]  And Congress and Trump need to take action.
[03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:26.400]  Because Zuckerberg doesn't own slave factories in China like Tim Cook.
[03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:28.400]  Let me tell you something.
[03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:31.400]  This guy's involved in really Nazi behavior.
[03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:32.400]  He's state-run.
[03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:34.400]  And I say, stop it.
[03:04:34.400 --> 03:04:35.400]  Stop it.
[03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:40.400]  Stop your murder of the people and the Chinese Christians and the Chinese Buddhists.
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:43.400]  No, Tim Cook, stop, stop, stop.
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:47.400]  You think I give a damn about money being big in the U.S. with what you're doing?
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:49.400]  No, no, no.
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:51.400]  Stop your violence.
[03:04:51.400 --> 03:05:13.400]  Stop it.

[03:05:58.400 --> 03:06:03.400]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:06:03.400 --> 03:06:06.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:06.400 --> 03:06:17.400]  So for those of you that have tuned in to the live streams at infowarstore.com, of course, my show, or have the free app, or subscribe to the podcast, you're about to see the verboten information.
[03:06:17.400 --> 03:06:30.400]  Not all of it's like a 20-minute clip that drew our incredible videographer shot in Portland, Oregon, and in Berkeley, California of the Antifa and what happened, but you're about to see a lot of it.
[03:06:30.400 --> 03:06:36.400]  This can't be seen on YouTube. This can't be seen on Facebook. This can't be seen on dozens of platforms.
[03:06:36.400 --> 03:06:39.400]  It's up on infowarstore.com. YouTube doesn't want you to see this video of Antifa.
[03:06:39.400 --> 03:06:44.400]  See the full video, infowarstore.com, and financially support us at infowarstore.com.
[03:06:44.400 --> 03:06:51.400]  But right now, let's just go to the verboten information.
[03:06:51.400 --> 03:07:00.400]  Owen Schroyer here for infowarstore.com. I'm currently driving, and we've got Drew here shooting HD shots right here getting B-roll.
[03:07:00.400 --> 03:07:05.400]  He's going to be putting together a documentary-style video of this weekend in Portland.
[03:07:05.400 --> 03:07:09.400]  And I wanted to let people know that we have landed. We're here safely.
[03:07:09.400 --> 03:07:20.400]  The narrative that's being spun already is that the proud boys or the Patriot prayer group or all of this stuff, these are the racist Nazi bigots that are invading Portland
[03:07:20.400 --> 03:07:26.400]  to, you know, plunder and pillage your town. And if you go on Twitter, this is all you see.
[03:07:26.400 --> 03:07:29.400]  So we'll see what happens, but that's kind of the groundwork.
[03:07:29.400 --> 03:07:33.400]  My name is Ruth Bielpanman. I'm the Sergeant Arms for the Seattle Chapter of Proud Boys.
[03:07:33.400 --> 03:07:44.400]  Antifa, their surface level attack is your racist, your Nazi, but really their agenda is anarchy and communism.
[03:07:44.400 --> 03:07:54.400]  They want to inflict anarchy into our system to uproot what we have as Americans here in Western culture and create a communist society.
[03:07:54.400 --> 03:08:00.400]  Portland is like the breeding ground for Antifa. It isn't really a location where they all meet up.
[03:08:00.400 --> 03:08:04.400]  Like Berkeley kind of is. This is where they live.
[03:08:04.400 --> 03:08:17.400]  It seems like the city council, the mayor and maybe even the police are all kind of linked into this way of life that accommodates these kind of groups.
[03:08:17.400 --> 03:08:20.400]  Are you getting like some pre-fight jitters right now?
[03:08:20.400 --> 03:08:21.400]  Definitely.
[03:08:21.400 --> 03:08:27.400]  You know, it's kind of like your birthday. You just get a little excited. You don't know if it's going to be a surprise or, you know.
[03:08:27.400 --> 03:08:33.400]  But actually, I'm more excited about seeing how many of our boys are going to show up.
[03:08:33.400 --> 03:08:37.400]  Hopefully tomorrow is going to be great. Hopefully everybody can maybe turn a new leaf.
[03:08:37.400 --> 03:08:42.400]  And who knows, maybe we can't have a beer and barbecue out here. Wouldn't that be the greatest story ever told?
[03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:48.400]  But I'm not sure that's going to be the case. We'll find out. Make sure to tune into Info Wars tomorrow.
[03:08:48.400 --> 03:09:00.400]  Okay, now it is 1023 here, local in Portland. We are going to be downtown and we are going to be live from the streets at the Patriot Prayer March in just over an hour.
[03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:09.400]  We've been on the right side of history forever.
[03:09:09.400 --> 03:09:18.400]  Every Ham Lincoln founded our party to fight slavery, stand up for freedom for everybody, and the left has been on the wrong side of every single time.
[03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:31.400]  The identity politics, now it's institutionalized racism. They're always on the wrong side of every fight.
[03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:41.400]  And today you guys are on the right side of that fight. So thank you for being here.
[03:09:41.400 --> 03:09:48.400]  There's tons of people with different beliefs and ideas. I think that eventually we've got to come together, but we can't do it if Antifa's in the middle constantly causing violence.
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:52.400]  It's not about race. It's about what's on the inside. We're here to promote freedom and God and that is it.
[03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:57.400]  And we actually have that American spirit where we're going to stand up for what we believe in, unapologetically, unafraid.
[03:09:57.400 --> 03:10:01.400]  Our country is getting soft. It's getting soft and we need leaders to step up.
[03:10:01.400 --> 03:10:08.400]  You put your country first. You put your family first. Put your community first. Whatever God is entrusting you with, you take care of it.
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:33.400]  Let's go!
[03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:39.400]  Traps. Every f***ing down there. They want to fight!
[03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:11.400]  If you fail to hear this, please order. You'll be subject to right control agents and impact weapons.
[03:11:11.400 --> 03:11:28.400]  Now and soon we'll service all people plus disperse. You'll work to disperse. If you fail to hear this, please order. You'll be subject to right control agents and impact weapons.
[03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:47.400]  You'll work to disperse. You'll work to disperse. You'll work to disperse. You'll work to disperse. You'll work to disperse.
[03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:52.400]  This footage is incredible. Trons everywhere. What a great job the team did.
[03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:55.280]  Under all that fire, this is what our team got.
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:57.000]  Look proud of them full-wars, folks.
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:58.680]  CNN could ever get this.
[03:11:58.680 --> 03:12:00.680]  Rally's gonna be awesome.
[03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:02.400]  And if you give it to me, if you give it to another girl,
[03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:03.640]  I'll give you a sign.
[03:12:03.640 --> 03:12:04.600]  Actually, I'll call her.
[03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:07.000]  Who are you with? Oh, yeah, Patriot Prayer, right?
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:07.600]  Yeah.
[03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:08.200]  Wrong.
[03:12:08.200 --> 03:12:10.400]  F***ing fascists.
[03:12:10.400 --> 03:12:11.600]  How you gonna call somebody?
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:13.800]  What the f***?
[03:12:13.800 --> 03:12:17.800]  Do you even, yeah, walk away with your silly f***ing asses?
[03:12:17.800 --> 03:12:20.200]  It was a successful day overall.
[03:12:20.200 --> 03:12:23.400]  But coming to a close, we're about to head to the next one.
[03:12:23.400 --> 03:12:24.800]  So, that's that.
[03:12:24.800 --> 03:12:27.800]  And anyway, so tune in to all the different streams
[03:12:27.800 --> 03:12:29.200]  that's gonna be going up on YouTube,

[03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:40.400]  to attend a rally in Berkeley, California.
[03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:41.600]  So, that's tomorrow.
[03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:44.600]  And for now, this is Jake Lloyd for enforce.com.
[03:12:46.600 --> 03:12:48.600]  Hi, F***ing you. I'm down at your f***ing studio stage.

[03:12:56.040 --> 03:12:57.600]  No, no, no.
[03:12:57.600 --> 03:12:58.600]  Get out of the friends because they're f***ing bad

[03:13:33.940 --> 03:13:37.940]  everything so I'm hoping it'll be a little more light-hearted and Antifa
[03:13:37.940 --> 03:13:41.860]  won't get too violent I'm told there's a big police presence so hopefully it'll
[03:13:41.860 --> 03:13:47.260]  be another day of for the most part peace and hopefully the people that show
[03:13:47.260 --> 03:13:50.680]  up with their faces covered in black hoodies decide not to engage in any
[03:13:50.680 --> 03:14:16.060]  violence today

[03:20:31.160 --> 03:20:37.040]  of censorship and evil i'm joel gilbert coming to you from the people's republic of california
[03:20:37.040 --> 03:20:41.800]  right from the left coast you know me as a frequent guest with alex and my new film trump
[03:20:41.800 --> 03:20:47.800]  the art of the insult in the info wars store please support the show by buying this film
[03:20:47.800 --> 03:20:53.240]  at the info wars store trump the art of the insult i want to give my takes first about
[03:20:53.240 --> 03:20:58.560]  what's happened this past week with censorship alex jones like most shows and commentators
[03:20:58.560 --> 03:21:03.720]  fills four hours a day of talk time that's about a thousand hours a year and alex's
[03:21:03.720 --> 03:21:09.240]  approach is to question everything you know and why not it's a democracy sometimes and
[03:21:09.240 --> 03:21:14.640]  actually very seldom he says things that turn out to be insensitive to some people or even
[03:21:14.640 --> 03:21:21.520]  off base but so do most other commentators if you've turned on what sean hennedy calls
[03:21:21.520 --> 03:21:30.240]  conspiracy tv msnbc these guys were obama vision obama vision since 2008 promoting the
[03:21:30.240 --> 03:21:36.040]  phony barack obama as a mainstream candidate hiding his radical past hiding the fact that
[03:21:36.040 --> 03:21:43.120]  his father was a russian spy hiding the radical agenda the most transparent president in history
[03:21:43.120 --> 03:21:49.720]  was promoted by msnbc and cnn they said that he would cut the deficit in half all his lies
[03:21:49.720 --> 03:21:57.480]  all lies they crashed the economy obama created a war between the classes race relations the
[03:21:57.480 --> 03:22:03.880]  list is endless so a few wacky things that alex jones might say for some people just
[03:22:03.880 --> 03:22:10.160]  pales in comparison to the damage that msnbc cnn have done and look at how they reacted
[03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:15.880]  when donald trump took the position after meeting vladimir putin that he was actually
[03:22:15.880 --> 03:22:21.400]  open to russians argument that they did not hack the desks emails the media and the democrats
[03:22:21.400 --> 03:22:27.080]  just kind of went crazy they said how dare you not trust the us intelligence services
[03:22:27.080 --> 03:22:33.520]  there's an official narrative you have to follow it well former cia director and obama fixer
[03:22:33.520 --> 03:22:39.360]  john brennan you know openly threatened trump after that accused him of treason called for
[03:22:39.360 --> 03:22:44.800]  his impeachment how dare you question the official narrative well we know in history
[03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:50.400]  that the intelligence community can be corrupt they have their own agenda they get infiltrated
[03:22:50.400 --> 03:22:58.440]  by those with alliances with foreign sources don't look further than obama and brennan
[03:22:58.440 --> 03:23:03.480]  in history of course the gulf of tonkin incident comes to mind that the vietnam war was prolonged
[03:23:03.480 --> 03:23:09.760]  and most historians to say say it didn't happen it was made up by us intel remember the first
[03:23:09.760 --> 03:23:16.320]  gulf war saddam hussein was lining up his forces threatening kuwait and us intelligence said that
[03:23:16.320 --> 03:23:21.120]  they were not going to invade kuwait there's no need to send a couple aircraft carriers just to
[03:23:21.120 --> 03:23:28.120]  make saddam stand down we don't need to do that and the result was war war is a failure of diplomacy
[03:23:28.120 --> 03:23:34.280]  it's a failure of intelligence same thing the second iraq war was based largely on an intelligence
[03:23:34.280 --> 03:23:41.880]  assessment that iraq had weapons of mass destruction war trillions of dollars five thousand more us
[03:23:41.880 --> 03:23:48.160]  soldiers hundreds of thousands of iraqis killed and the fatigue over the iraq war helped to bring
[03:23:48.160 --> 03:23:54.080]  obama's election the most destructive president since jimmy carter a man with a stealth radical
[03:23:54.080 --> 03:24:01.800]  socialist agenda who pretended to be moderate so the point is a lot of destruction can happen when
[03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:06.400]  a president just accepts anything the intel community says it's his job to bring his savvy
[03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:12.640]  experience from new york city from real estate to the real world experience to question everything
[03:24:12.640 --> 03:24:19.440]  now let's go back to alex jones his job as a commentator is to ask questions maybe dumb
[03:24:19.440 --> 03:24:24.120]  questions and challenge the narrative to stimulate the debate it's called free speech and free
[03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:31.120]  thinking and free speech by definition is free if you're offended if you don't like it you can
[03:24:31.120 --> 03:24:37.320]  change the channel that's what free speech is i would rather be in a country where a few people
[03:24:37.320 --> 03:24:43.800]  get their feelings hurt before they change the channel than one where the media and intel services
[03:24:43.800 --> 03:24:49.440]  just tell us what to think okay we're gonna bring on a larry claimant first a couple of
[03:24:49.440 --> 03:24:54.440]  guests today larry claimant we want to talk to larry the great conservative attorney head of
[03:24:54.440 --> 03:25:00.800]  freedom watch usa to talk about this censorship and everything that's happened this week larry are
[03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:07.880]  you with us today i am joel thank you for having me good to see you great larry look first of all
[03:25:07.880 --> 03:25:15.160]  were you shocked and if so how shocked were you at the collusion of the big tech to censor and try
[03:25:15.160 --> 03:25:22.280]  to remove the alex jones show from the internet i am shocked but it doesn't surprise me this is the
[03:25:22.280 --> 03:25:27.720]  left these big entities are controlled by ultra leftist forces whether it's facebook and mark
[03:25:27.720 --> 03:25:32.880]  zuckerberg whether it's twitter whether it's youtube whether it's any of them and what they're
[03:25:32.880 --> 03:25:38.760]  doing is they're colluding to limit speech from conservatives speech from libertarians speech
[03:25:38.760 --> 03:25:45.280]  from anybody who doesn't agree with their socialist pro radical islam pro radical feminist pro
[03:25:45.280 --> 03:25:51.520]  radical atheist pro illegal immigrant agenda and it's happening to everybody it's not just alex
[03:25:51.520 --> 03:25:56.800]  okay i've noticed just in the last two months that our subscriptions to youtube have stayed static
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:26:02.600]  our twitter has not gone up we've been doing some major things over here now alex is the most
[03:26:02.600 --> 03:26:10.120]  extreme example of retaliation against a conservative and i think there's an antitrust violation here i
[03:26:10.120 --> 03:26:17.480]  believe that alex could bring a case where this collusion to limit free speech it's a constitutional
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:23.080]  violation on a former antitrust lawyer of the antitrust division i helped break 18 up at nt when
[03:26:23.080 --> 03:26:29.160]  i was a young lawyer at the justice department uh he needs to fight back on this one and i think the
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:33.800]  rest of the conservative movement needs to fight back as well and i'm here to help i'm a lawyer
[03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:39.000]  41 years trial lawyer uh and i'm going to put my foot forward because it's not just alex but it's
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:44.040]  also freedom watch and everybody else that's being discriminated against in an anti-competent way
[03:26:44.920 --> 03:26:50.600]  all right well what can be done legally i keep hearing this argument that uh these are private
[03:26:50.600 --> 03:26:56.360]  companies and they can do what they want is there really a legal path to reverse this monopolistic
[03:26:56.360 --> 03:27:02.040]  behavior well you have private companies all the time that enter into agreements in restraint of
[03:27:02.040 --> 03:27:07.560]  trade so what you have here is a sherman one violation an agreement in restraint of trade at
[03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:12.520]  a minimum and that's what they're doing and of course they're also competitors of alex you know
[03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:20.280]  apple facebook twitter the others we're all competing you see so and you could also maybe
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:26.040]  call this a group boycott in a way so there's lots of avenues that can be pursued somebody's got to
[03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:33.800]  put their foot down here and action needs to be taken by alex by freedom watch by some of my clients
[03:27:33.800 --> 03:27:37.240]  who've been discriminated against they've been hurt they've had to lay off people with this
[03:27:37.240 --> 03:27:42.440]  discrimination it's a terrible situation and we can't allow it to continue it's it's really the
[03:27:42.440 --> 03:27:48.920]  first step in trying to take this country over by the ultra left and the radicals and they're doing
[03:27:48.920 --> 03:27:53.800]  it in the streets they're doing it in the media and they're doing it elsewhere and then you have
[03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:58.680]  of course people out there these apologists who claim to be conservatives like jonah goldberg
[03:27:58.680 --> 03:28:03.880]  you know the national review or ben Shapiro these people play both sides of the streets they've
[03:28:03.880 --> 03:28:10.040]  both anti trumpers you see and they try to placate the left by you know an apologist
[03:28:10.040 --> 03:28:15.720]  of what's happening and they infer that they're against alex and others out there so they can
[03:28:15.720 --> 03:28:22.280]  get themselves on bill mar or the view or you know wherever abc nbc so you need people that talk
[03:28:22.280 --> 03:28:27.480]  straight that's really good before we go to we got to go to a break in 20 seconds would you do
[03:28:27.480 --> 03:28:32.440]  a contingency agreement you've done this before where you represent the alex jon show and take
[03:28:32.440 --> 03:28:44.120]  this case forward to the supreme court if you have to would answer i would okay larry claimants on
[03:28:44.120 --> 03:28:48.440]  on board to fight this fight we'll be back with larry claimant and uh after the break and we'll
[03:28:48.440 --> 03:28:55.400]  continue talking about what can be done to ensure free speech healthcare reform is confusing but
[03:28:55.400 --> 03:29:00.040]  whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan keeping your doctor or being able to afford needed

[03:32:02.680 --> 03:32:09.240]  rely on rain water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[03:32:09.240 --> 03:32:15.800]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[03:32:15.800 --> 03:32:22.520]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[03:32:22.520 --> 03:32:28.680]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water
[03:32:28.680 --> 03:32:34.520]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:32:34.520 --> 03:32:41.720]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[03:32:41.720 --> 03:32:47.880]  the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain
[03:32:47.880 --> 03:32:53.240]  water supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[03:32:53.240 --> 03:33:09.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:09.160 --> 03:33:31.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show still on the air still fighting the forces of censorship and

[03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:56.120]  larry claimant want to ask you we know that presidents tend to bring on people from the
[03:33:56.120 --> 03:34:01.320]  world that they come from into the white house barack obama his world was chicago radicals
[03:34:01.320 --> 03:34:08.920]  uh he knew the people in the radical left movement acorn different lawyers la raza you name it
[03:34:09.480 --> 03:34:17.080]  he brought on the radicals into the government uh donald trump seems like his world was talk tv
[03:34:18.120 --> 03:34:24.600]  you know he liked he was a cable news junkie so we see people like larry cudlow you know
[03:34:24.600 --> 03:34:33.160]  uh the lawyers it seems like his entire world view and staff seems to be coming from uh cable tv
[03:34:33.160 --> 03:34:40.120]  news uh what do you think of his cable tv lawyers and what they can do for him and where this
[03:34:40.120 --> 03:34:48.280]  molar probe is is headed at this time tv lawyers it's 20 years ago uh i used to go to nate now's
[03:34:48.280 --> 03:34:54.360]  delicate test and still do in beverly hills when i'm out here and in eight nows there was always larry
[03:34:54.360 --> 03:35:01.240]  king and he would meet there with his staff every morning and he loved nate now and at some point
[03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:07.560]  his seventh wife he's actually had one more than Henry the eighth at six decided to run off with the
[03:35:07.560 --> 03:35:12.600]  gym instructor and everybody thought he was going to get divorced and a friend of mine who's a family
[03:35:12.600 --> 03:35:17.240]  lawyer in los angeles i said why do you think he's not getting divorced and she said well he has
[03:35:17.240 --> 03:35:21.880]  such a bad prenuptial agreement he can't afford to get divorced to be bankrupt i said why is that he
[03:35:21.880 --> 03:35:27.960]  says because everybody that he chooses or deals with has bagels in eight nows right he didn't
[03:35:27.960 --> 03:35:34.760]  get a first rate lawyer now here's what's happening to the president the president loves fox news and
[03:35:34.760 --> 03:35:38.600]  fox news has some good things on there i'm critical because they don't let you say what you really
[03:35:38.600 --> 03:35:45.160]  think that's why i love info wars and alex and you and and owin uh it's censored on fox news but
[03:35:45.160 --> 03:35:52.200]  nevertheless he's picking his lawyers off of fox news and who does he wind up with jay secolo who's
[03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:56.120]  a nice guy sees him on fox news so he thinks okay that's a great lawyer well jay is a great
[03:35:56.120 --> 03:36:01.000]  lawyer when it comes to religious rights but he's not a criminal defense lawyer rudy juliani
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:07.960]  who's always on fox news he picks him and rudy is is really nice guy too but he's kind of passed
[03:36:07.960 --> 03:36:14.200]  his prime and he's been going on tv spewing forth nonsense boss facts i don't think he
[03:36:14.200 --> 03:36:18.200]  doesn't intentionally i think he's just getting up there in years or maybe he's had a few drinks
[03:36:18.200 --> 03:36:23.240]  before he comes on hanity i don't know but but the president needs to wind up correcting him the
[03:36:23.240 --> 03:36:28.120]  president himself his own lawyer and it's getting the president in trouble but the big beef i have
[03:36:28.120 --> 03:36:34.680]  here right now is that they're sitting here letting the president get dragged along the legal guillotine
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:42.040]  is that robert moeller they just made him an offer that trump will testify to some extent with
[03:36:42.040 --> 03:36:47.960]  limited questions if the investigation will end well that's an offer that only moeller can refuse
[03:36:47.960 --> 03:36:52.360]  okay because you know it's question of manhood it's a question of what your jurisdiction is
[03:36:52.360 --> 03:36:57.960]  no prosecutor's going to take that uh and it's not it was a an ultimatum that was put forward
[03:36:57.960 --> 03:37:02.360]  to get moeller to refuse now what more what's moeller going to do after that he's going to
[03:37:02.360 --> 03:37:07.240]  send a subpoena to trump this is going to then be litigated all the way up to the supreme court
[03:37:07.240 --> 03:37:13.320]  it'll take a few years it'll get into the 2020 elections it will damage the president and it
[03:37:13.320 --> 03:37:18.360]  will result in an impeachment report in all likelihood interim impeachment report by moeller
[03:37:18.920 --> 03:37:24.280]  within the next month or so that will be intended to influence the midterm elections
[03:37:24.920 --> 03:37:30.280]  and it could influence likely would and we may wind up with a democrat house of representatives
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:35.400]  that impeaches the president and which grinds this country to a halt as we're trying to negotiate
[03:37:35.400 --> 03:37:41.240]  solutions to the nuclear crisis in north korea or on dealing with illegal immigration
[03:37:41.800 --> 03:37:46.920]  there's a lot of important issues out there so these lawyers by sitting there in earth
[03:37:47.720 --> 03:37:52.600]  are leading the president down the primrose path the disaster and the nation as well
[03:37:53.240 --> 03:37:57.480]  and they're having a great time on fox news but i'll tell you something we're not going to have a
[03:37:57.480 --> 03:38:02.600]  great time thanks to their inaction and what they can be doing joel is they should go into court
[03:38:02.600 --> 03:38:08.920]  right now we've said that in fact i heard mark levin say that last night on cable news i apparently
[03:38:08.920 --> 03:38:14.840]  he agrees with me that they should be challenging moeller's jurisdiction to proceed and grinding
[03:38:14.840 --> 03:38:20.440]  him to a halt now by the grace of god president would have been elected without the grace of god
[03:38:20.440 --> 03:38:24.600]  i think that's the only reason we don't have illy clinton right now is a miracle but the grace of
[03:38:24.600 --> 03:38:30.120]  god maybe we get a judge that'll put his foot down here and try to block it now in addition to that
[03:38:30.120 --> 03:38:35.000]  the president can be ordering the justice department to investigate moeller to investigate
[03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:42.040]  hillary clinton to investigate peter struck visa page bruise or i can tell you a big story about
[03:38:42.040 --> 03:38:47.400]  bruise or that hasn't come out lately either you know about his corruption but he can be doing those
[03:38:47.400 --> 03:38:52.360]  things now if he can be investigated the president why can't he have these people investigated and
[03:38:52.360 --> 03:38:58.680]  order sessions and rosinstein to do it so these these lawyers they're part of this
[03:38:58.680 --> 03:39:04.680]  washington establishment club they love the notoriety they love getting on tv they're nice people
[03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:10.920]  and you know i feel bad that i have to criticize them like this but they are not serving the
[03:39:10.920 --> 03:39:16.840]  president well and he needs to turn fox news off he needs to find real independent lawyers
[03:39:16.840 --> 03:39:22.120]  that'll put their their like on the line for him because it's not just for him it's for the entire
[03:39:22.120 --> 03:39:29.880]  country okay larry what is preventing uh i guess maybe i watch fox news too much what is preventing
[03:39:30.520 --> 03:39:35.720]  trump from simply firing robert moeller firing rosinstein and firing jeff sessions is completely
[03:39:35.720 --> 03:39:41.640]  useless and just saying look uh they haven't come up with anything we need to have an effective
[03:39:41.640 --> 03:39:48.360]  department of justice so i'm making these changes what prevents him from doing that nothing he is
[03:39:48.360 --> 03:39:54.120]  the head of the justice department he's the head of the executive branch but short of firing moeller
[03:39:54.120 --> 03:39:59.560]  or rosinstein or sessions for that matter i think you should get rid of sessions now obviously i mean
[03:39:59.560 --> 03:40:05.160]  the guy is not the brightest bold out there he even got holding contempt yesterday on something
[03:40:05.160 --> 03:40:10.440]  that was unnecessary deported some people uh who were already under court jurisdiction and judge m
[03:40:10.440 --> 03:40:16.200]  it's Sullivan is holding sessions in contempt potentially he needs to get somebody in there
[03:40:16.200 --> 03:40:22.520]  that's got some guts it's got some fortitude that knows what they're doing and the president can do
[03:40:22.520 --> 03:40:26.680]  that and he can also order the justice department to do things if he doesn't want to fire moeller
[03:40:26.680 --> 03:40:32.680]  if he doesn't want to fire sessions or rosinstein he can order an investigation of moeller for the
[03:40:32.680 --> 03:40:38.360]  illegal grand jury leaks that have been occurring for a year and a half for a criminal for uh
[03:40:39.160 --> 03:40:44.840]  obstructing justice himself that's what he's doing here we'll call mattiforce larry what do you think
[03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:51.800]  look uh we know that trumps has very strong gut instincts we know that his gut instinct is you're
[03:40:51.800 --> 03:40:57.560]  fired he would fire these guys in a second what are his lawyers telling him that are making him
[03:40:57.560 --> 03:41:02.920]  think i can't do this i'm gonna have a bigger problem if i fire these guys what could they
[03:41:02.920 --> 03:41:08.760]  possibly be saying yes that's the 64 000 question when i was a kid on a game show
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:14.920]  uh multiplied with inflation it's a million dollar question uh he's being told by his
[03:41:14.920 --> 03:41:20.360]  lawyers don't do it because it's politically unwise because it'll result in you getting impeached
[03:41:20.360 --> 03:41:25.720]  well you know what he's going to get impeached anyway so he might as well get rid of these people
[03:41:25.720 --> 03:41:30.680]  now and then take the lumps later he is the president the american people will back him
[03:41:30.680 --> 03:41:36.040]  we need strong action he needs to take the reins himself but these lawyers who are part
[03:41:36.040 --> 03:41:41.240]  of the swamp in washington now they all have lunch together juliani braggs all i'm a friend of
[03:41:41.240 --> 03:41:45.400]  moeller you know and and seckler's a nice guy and like i said he's a very good religious rice
[03:41:45.400 --> 03:41:50.040]  lawyer he really doesn't know what he's doing in the criminal sphere maybe he was a prosecutor
[03:41:50.040 --> 03:41:53.960]  of public defender for a very short period in his early life but he's not a seasoned criminal
[03:41:53.960 --> 03:42:01.640]  defense lawyer you can't send the president into the devil's lair have to me testify in any respect
[03:42:01.640 --> 03:42:06.440]  and and you can't play these games you know and the investigation will answer limited questions
[03:42:06.440 --> 03:42:15.240]  and then expect moeller not to issue a skating and incriminating impeachment report that will
[03:42:15.240 --> 03:42:21.240]  grind grind this country and the president to a halt something has to be done now and the president
[03:42:21.240 --> 03:42:26.920]  you know i watch you i watch very we just got a few seconds left tell us where people can go to
[03:42:26.920 --> 03:42:34.920]  your website and sign your petition but a freedom watch usa.org sign the petition have me appointed

[03:48:53.480 --> 03:48:57.080]  we'll go through them all frank why did you write about the 10 most destructive americans
[03:48:57.720 --> 03:49:03.560]  well you know it's interesting i as i obviously in my eighth decade i'm pushing 80 i'm not quite
[03:49:03.560 --> 03:49:12.520]  there yet but over all these years i've witnessed an unbelievable makeover of america now admittedly
[03:49:12.520 --> 03:49:17.400]  some of it's been good you know we have enjoyed impressive improvements in our standard of living
[03:49:17.400 --> 03:49:23.480]  uh for instance when i was a boy uh we lived in what was considered a middle-class neighborhood
[03:49:24.040 --> 03:49:31.240]  our house had one bathroom the family had one car there was no tv we did have radio radio and
[03:49:31.240 --> 03:49:39.560]  rotary dial phones um but basically very few at that time uh joel could even envision a space
[03:49:39.560 --> 03:49:46.440]  travel or iphone or ipads or facebook or or or live streaming high definition tv 24 hours a day
[03:49:46.440 --> 03:49:52.920]  although dick tracy did have a telephone on his wrist anyhow the other thing which is more
[03:49:52.920 --> 03:49:59.240]  important we had a government that we respected and we believe that that government generally
[03:49:59.240 --> 03:50:04.920]  acted in the interests of the american people and the media in those days known as the fourth
[03:50:04.920 --> 03:50:09.560]  as a state and by the way my father was a newspaper editor in pittsburgh pennsylvania
[03:50:09.560 --> 03:50:15.720]  uh the fourth estate was widely trusted to help set the political agenda and provide balance
[03:50:16.760 --> 03:50:21.720]  in our political system my father wrote editorials for the pittsburgh post gazette
[03:50:21.720 --> 03:50:28.360]  i regard him as the most ethical person i've ever known and in those days uh joel there were no
[03:50:28.360 --> 03:50:34.040]  liberal or right-wing newspapers uh although obviously newspaper editorials would make
[03:50:34.040 --> 03:50:40.840]  recommendations at election time but often they would recommend both republicans and democrats
[03:50:40.840 --> 03:50:47.000]  with the idea being that you know you just vote for the best person not for a particular party
[03:50:47.720 --> 03:50:54.680]  and even when tv finally matured you know the initial evening talk show hosts like johnny karson
[03:50:54.680 --> 03:51:00.520]  and uh so on they were usually even handed in their jokes about politicians and frankly they
[03:51:00.520 --> 03:51:09.480]  were very rarely vicious so let's let's talk about let's talk about when the the tide changed and
[03:51:09.480 --> 03:51:15.080]  who were the people that changed the tide to change this uh more balanced society where
[03:51:15.080 --> 03:51:21.080]  government was respected and newspapers were fair who do you think let's you know i i've got a list
[03:51:21.080 --> 03:51:26.680]  of 10 people um and arguably there are plenty of others who could or should be on the list but i have
[03:51:26.680 --> 03:51:33.960]  my top 10 and i will start with the at the bottom of the list is the guy named mark felt uh at that
[03:51:33.960 --> 03:51:40.440]  time uh when he was in the fbi during the nix of era he was the deputy director of the fbi
[03:51:41.160 --> 03:51:48.600]  and he ended up being deep throat during the watergate scandal this joel was the first public
[03:51:48.600 --> 03:51:56.200]  instance of a senior fbi official directly interfering in americans political affairs and
[03:51:56.200 --> 03:52:03.480]  he is the forerunner of comey struck lisa pageant andrew mccabe okay let's let's jump up to ted
[03:52:03.480 --> 03:52:10.200]  kennedy what did this liberal icon and kennedy brother do to bring about destruction to america
[03:52:10.200 --> 03:52:16.200]  uh kennedy everybody will remember as the guy who left uh mary joe compact me to die at chap
[03:52:16.200 --> 03:52:22.280]  aquatic uh but the real damage that he caused after uh he avoided punishment for her death and
[03:52:22.280 --> 03:52:28.680]  became a major uh force in the u.s senate as a democrat he pushing through a transformative
[03:52:28.680 --> 03:52:35.960]  liberal policies in both health care and education but the real damage that he did was the 1965
[03:52:35.960 --> 03:52:41.800]  immigration bill to change the quota system to increase the flow of third world act people
[03:52:41.800 --> 03:52:47.960]  without any skills in the united states and he essentially ended large-scale immigration from
[03:52:47.960 --> 03:52:55.720]  europe the damage okay let's is is quite clear today all right let's take icon walter cronkite
[03:52:55.720 --> 03:53:00.760]  you put him on the list how did walter cronkite the much beloved network anchor bring about
[03:53:01.320 --> 03:53:08.280]  destruction people of my era will remember that walter cronkite was a totally beloved figure
[03:53:08.280 --> 03:53:14.600]  and i was one of those who loved him i mean is the he cried when john f kennedy was assassinated
[03:53:14.600 --> 03:53:19.960]  he gave a remarkable performance when the men landed on the moon and everybody loved him
[03:53:19.960 --> 03:53:25.720]  but in fact what happened was that he had this famous broadcast from vietnam that described
[03:53:25.720 --> 03:53:31.400]  the ted offensive as a major victory for the communist and it's significantly turned the
[03:53:31.400 --> 03:53:38.520]  gullible american public against the vietnam war in fact you'll remember the ted offensive
[03:53:38.520 --> 03:53:45.160]  was a military disaster for the communists and this was later admitted by the north vietnamese
[03:53:45.160 --> 03:53:51.560]  military leaders themselves and even years later uh cronkite admitted that he got the story wrong
[03:53:51.560 --> 03:53:57.160]  but it was too late the damage was done so that was the original one of the original fake news
[03:53:57.160 --> 03:54:03.800]  pieces that caused tremendous damage let's jump up to uh jimmy carter known for his incompetence
[03:54:03.800 --> 03:54:10.600]  what stands out as most destructive act of jimmy carter well there were a couple but i would think
[03:54:10.600 --> 03:54:15.480]  the one that we would just have time to talk about today was the jimmy carter can easily be
[03:54:16.760 --> 03:54:23.720]  thought about as the guy who ignited modern day radical islam and the way he did that was he
[03:54:23.720 --> 03:54:30.520]  abandoned the shaw who in those days in iran uh was the head of what amounted to a secular country
[03:54:30.520 --> 03:54:36.920]  yes people were largely muslims but in fact it was a secular country and everyone all religions
[03:54:36.920 --> 03:54:44.120]  were retreated with respect carter ended up pulling out the rug from underneath the shaw
[03:54:44.120 --> 03:54:50.920]  and he paved the way for the ayatollah khamenei to come from paris and to take power in tehran
[03:54:51.720 --> 03:54:58.680]  as a result subsequently iran became the main state sponsor and promoter of international
[03:54:58.680 --> 03:55:05.400]  islamic terrorism and you know when the when the islamic forces took over our embassy in tehran
[03:55:05.960 --> 03:55:11.480]  carter was too weak to do anything about it and he had basically strengthened the rule of the radical
[03:55:11.480 --> 03:55:15.880]  islamic mullahs and they're still in power today let's keep moving because i got on too much time
[03:55:15.880 --> 03:55:23.400]  we're going to jump up to uh you know barry barack davis satoro who's saying obama the stealth
[03:55:23.400 --> 03:55:29.160]  communist that i've criticized of course in my movie dreams for my real father why did barack
[03:55:29.160 --> 03:55:33.960]  who's saying obama how did he bring destruction to america well you know each day we learn more
[03:55:33.960 --> 03:55:39.720]  about how he politicized and compromised key government agencies you know particularly the
[03:55:39.720 --> 03:55:46.600]  fbi the cia and the irs and as the the damage is that he has thoroughly shaken the public's
[03:55:46.600 --> 03:55:52.520]  confidence and the federal government to be fair and unbiased in its activities but even worse than
[03:55:52.520 --> 03:55:58.440]  that in my opinion is he could significantly set back race and other relations between americans
[03:55:58.440 --> 03:56:05.160]  by stoking black grievances and pushing radical identity politics and on top of that of course
[03:56:05.160 --> 03:56:11.400]  his open support for the iranian mullahs and his apologetic lead from behind foreign policy
[03:56:12.120 --> 03:56:17.560]  seriously weakened america abroad and uh we can do frank we can do a whole show
[03:56:17.560 --> 03:56:23.320]  but we can do a whole show on obama no question i want to make sure we get to the number one most
[03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:29.160]  destructive american i want to hear you talk about you listed him as john carrey former secretary of
[03:56:29.160 --> 03:56:35.640]  state why is john carrey the most destructive american of your lifetime okay you know sensible
[03:56:35.640 --> 03:56:41.000]  people could argue about his place on the list whether he deserves to be number one i put him
[03:56:41.000 --> 03:56:46.920]  on there because i regard him as the most single most despicable american who ever lived you know
[03:56:46.920 --> 03:56:52.280]  after he faked his three purple hearts during his service in vietnam he was able to leave the navy
[03:56:52.280 --> 03:56:59.640]  early and as a reserve naval officer in a clear violation of the uniform code of military justice
[03:56:59.640 --> 03:57:05.320]  he traveled to paris and he met privately with the nva and the vietcong and then he came back to
[03:57:05.320 --> 03:57:11.720]  the united states parroting the soviet party line about the war and he had the gall to testify before
[03:57:11.720 --> 03:57:17.720]  congress in which he had compared american soldiers to the hordes of jingas kahn he became a virtual
[03:57:17.720 --> 03:57:24.120]  spokesman for the communists it was a clear case joel of treason that is giving aid and comfort
[03:57:24.120 --> 03:57:29.240]  to the enemy in a time of war and then of course we saw what he did by giving a little money to the
[03:57:29.800 --> 03:57:34.200]  well he almost friend we got it we got to leave now but he almost became president it wasn't that
[03:57:34.200 --> 03:57:37.400]  you know three percent he would have been president frank hawkins thank you former
