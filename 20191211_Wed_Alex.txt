[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  Music
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  Well, let's play this out. They never told Trump about the concerns.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  Is it fair to say they came a point to where surveilling Carter Page became unlawful?
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  I will let the court decide that. The court has this report and will make that decision.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  Let's put it this way. If you don't have a legal foundation to surveil somebody and you keep doing it, is that bad?
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  Absolutely.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  Is that spine?
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  It's illegal surveillance. It's not court-authorized surveillance.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Whatever illegal surveillance means, they did it.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  So, all this stuff that they did in a legally surveilled Trump's campaign, they did because they had no legal basis after the January 2017 data dump by the Russian guy to believe that the dossier had a legal basis.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  The Russian guy, to believe that the dossier was reliable, they altered a sculptor information in June of 2017 that would have further proven that Carter Page is not a Russian agent.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  He was actually working with the CIA. Let me ask you very directly. Do you believe Carter Page is or ever was an agent of the Russian government trying to do harm to his country?
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  I'm going to refer to the evidence we found here, which is that at the end of this,
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  the FBI, at the end of these vises, told us that they had found no...
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Told us they had found no. And then the clip cuts were getting the longer clip, but they go on.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  We have the transcripts that they found no evidence of Russian collusion or Russian infiltration of any of the people.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  And it turns out, as I said back at the time, not just Page, but all those guys were working for the CIA.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  And then it was a cover story when it later came out in the news that they were under investigation and things that they themselves were the target.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  And that was just the cover. And then they were going out and seeking Russians to interface with, so that through them, it would then connect in to Trump.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  That was the mission. That was the plan by this entire gaggle of individuals from the swamp.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  And I said back at the time, I believe that Page is probably a mole and probably working for the CIA.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  And I'm on record saying that. Now they've spun it like, oh, they knew he was innocent and still they did this to him.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  It's far worse than that in my view, in my humble opinion. And we're still allowed to have those in America, aren't we?
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  But that's why Fiona Hill and all of them were so pissed a couple of years ago, listening to my show, and knowing that Trump was getting intel from it, because it was dead on about all these people.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  I mean, you could see this coming from a mile away.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  And I had the Secret Service call me and I had other agencies call me.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  And other agencies came and met with us and I'm gonna leave it at that.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  And they said, how do you know Trump was being spied on? That's classified. And I said, the Democrats bragged when he was president-elect that they had wiretaps.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  There were damn headlines all over the news.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  I mean, it's the laziness of these government people, because they're not just playing dumb, folks.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  And the whole theory of people are inept is true.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Now, the globalist on top used that ineptness.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  And I'm not saying everybody in the government's inept, but everybody knows how the general public is, how companies are, how everything is.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  People are in La La Land. People watch on average like five hours of TV a day.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  They'll have four hours of screen time on top of that. And everything's just kind of lackadaisical.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  And so people think I'm some type of rocket scientist.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  Because I remember the news saying, oh, we got Trump. He's a Russian.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  We were wiretapping the campaign. We were spying on it. And I got the Washington Post and the New York Times.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  He was president-elect. And even the day he was sworn in front page of the New York Times.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  Well, the president wanted us to give you a call and find out exactly who it is. It's running this coup.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  I'm like, really, the president? Well, yeah, he wanted you to know that. The president, yes.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  We appreciate you talking to us. So who's planning to kill him or overthrow him? What do you mean by coup?
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  And I said, they're running a coup. They're deep staters. Anybody who's a neocon or a Democrat in the State Department.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  Anyone that's ever worked for Soros or the Clintons or Obama or Bush, senior or junior, he cannot have a rounding.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  They're running a stay-behind network. No, no, no. What's a stay-behind network?
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  I'm like having hour-long conversations with senior Secret Service. You don't know what a stay-behind network is.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  Okay, they're in-beds. They're networks of globalists that are going to undermine and set the president up.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  And they're going to overthrow him however they can. I mean, did you see on CNN when they said he won't be in the office by Christmas?
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  Did you see him at the Aspen Institute, Clapper and Brennan? Well, Blitzer says, what do you mean you're going to remove him outside of impeachment?
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  And they just make evil faces. That's a threat to the president. Now, years later, it's called a coup. Everybody knows that.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  But I didn't need to get a call from an intelligence operative, the millions of them the government's got.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  I'm just walking around playing golf and talking into their shirt and trying to impress their girlfriends.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Oh, I've got a badge and a government security clearance. What the frickin' do? How about you study every day?
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  How about your research? What's going on? How about you know history?
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  And that's what's so frustrating about this is I became this big number one target all because I'm not lazy.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  And that's what's frustrating is it should be so easy to beat these people. But the average male in this country is beyond lazy, beyond uninformed, and beyond stupid.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  I talked to U.S. senators off the record, congresspeople on average, who are pretty good people. They still don't know anything.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  The fellow running the boom camera who's worked in TV for decades, he knows as much as I do or more about all these things.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  We have long conversations. He knows everything. But all those people are just out there working hard in America.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  All the political class doesn't know which end is up and can't find their fat asses with both hands.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  And it scares the hell out of me. But you know who's got a hunger for power? Criminals and pedophiles.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  They have that criminal energy that good people don't have.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  They're working around the clock to get access to your children and access to your bank accounts and access to control in your life because they crave it.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  And we need to start craving freedom. We need to start craving not being overrun by the globalists and their minions and start getting territorial and start getting pissed again.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  Because let me tell you, when I had all the girlfriends I wanted and had a great time and eaten great food and working out all the time and you know, I was not happy.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  When I started fighting tyranny 24-7, I'm so damn happy it makes my head spin.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  People are not fulfilled because they're empty. They don't have God. They don't have family. All they've got is Netflix.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  Well, man cannot live by Netflix alone.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  I'm going to stop preaching and go to your phone calls when we come back. I promise we've got a guest popping in.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  But I'm going to take calls throughout the broadcast. I'm going to get to everybody.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  I already took one call.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  Just briefly so I don't have to do it later.

[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  Well, that's pretty big news. Horowitz admits and congressional testimony in the Senate. FBI engaged in legal surveillance, the Trump campaign. We already know that.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  So then why'd he say no wrongdoing, no criminal activity in his damn report?
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  No, I'm the guy saying the report would be a nothing burger because they cover their ass. But Durham and bar aren't just signaling they're saying there's criminal investigations and they're taking action and that people have to be indicted.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  That shows you there's a real fight going on between these groups and they really legitimately hate each other.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  So that is a big, big deal. What do you think about that? What do you think about the impeachment and the tricks they've got up their sleeves?
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  Our Democrats saying even if they don't get rid of Trump this time, if he gets reelected, they're going to start it over again. They have to be repudiated. They absolutely have to be repudiated.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  They've got to be defeated. They've got to lose the house. They've got to lose control of the governorships they have.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  But instead, they're starting to gain seats because Trump's allowed the censorship and the election fraud.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  And I just hate seeing everybody so happy about Trump and so pleased with the job he's doing. And apprehensions at the border are down 60 plus percent and Trump is going off the pedophile rings and he is in a real trade war with China and he is trying to get the federal reserve to have policies that kickstart the economy.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  I mean, Trump's the real deal, which shows you there's not just pure evil in the world. Hell, this audience got him elected.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  But it just begs the question, are we going to watch him take it all away from us because they don't get in trouble for what they've done because in the blue cities they get control of. There's never real elections again.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  And they collapse society and loot it by design.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  Sergeant in California. Thanks for holding her on the air. Hey, Alex, it's great to talk to you again. I've been listening to you since I was in the military within the Marine Corps.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  I've actually called you back then when I was in back when I got back from Iraq and told you, you know, basically you guys are right about everything that you were reporting on as far as like the fake wars and fake WMD and all that stuff.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  And you've always been a household name in my house.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  Even to, you know, the point of being persecuted by my own family, you know, since then, you know, I've always stood up for you. I've always taken heat for it.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  And it's not even about that. It's like now I feel like we are so vindicated. I say we because you brought me the information like you do every day faithfully. And I got to see it and spread it and everybody that said I was full of crap and I'm listening to tin foil
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  and these are now saying good crap. What was I thinking. So I mean that instrumental. It's alone is instrumental in the fight.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  You are the one that woke me up. And about the beef state thing I never heard about it until Trump got elected.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  And especially during the election, I caught so much heat for you from people that were living on the coast. I live on the West Coast. I'm originally from the Midwest Indiana, but I live on the West Coast now and I was talking to people on the East Coast because I know some people over there in New York and man,
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  they hate your guts. They hate Trump and all this and that and Roger Stone and their little tricks and blah, blah, blah and laughing and giggling and stuff when things are going down at that point. But they all blocked me on Facebook. I'm on my fifth month of banning on Facebook.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  This this year alone for, you know, speaking my mind and I saw the hearings this morning with Diane Feinstein, asking Horowitz asked him three times.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  Is there a deep state and was there a political motivation for opening the investigation and all three times Horowitz said there was no political motivation and he dodged the deep state questions three times dodged the question he did not answer the deep state questions.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  But Diane Feinstein, the Chai Com control senator, tried making Horowitz jump through hoops and he refused to jump through the hoop. If that tells you something, that tells you something.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  Let's elaborate a little bit for us, Sergeant. When you talk about about feeling vindicated being vindicated people around you saying yeah, you were right, because that's what I'm seeing happen. That's why they wanted us off the air before all this began to come out and they failed miserably.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  That's why people out there that are censored have to understand you're censored because you're telling the truth. And as they censor more, the truth becomes even more precious and people dig for it like jewels in the mountainside.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  And as this evil intensifies and as we're proven right, we become more powerful folks. That's why they're having to censor, which only exposes the more that's an act of desperation. So give us your boots on the ground. A little bit of elaboration or why you're saying people now say we're vindicated because that that's what I'm seeing happen.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  Well, yeah, absolutely. So when I was in the Marine Corps, I was a platoon sergeant for roughly 30 to 40 Marines and every day during the daily morning accountability and formation, you know, I would pass on news and in the evening accountability
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  formation, I would pass on the news of the day that you had. And a lot of it had to do with the time because you were really harping on the devices in the, in the televisions and then the things that would listen if a dog bark, you know, you had a, you know, you had a dog commercial come on and now we're seeing it on our phones.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  And the, you know, my Marines would tell me all the time, Sergeant, you're crazy. And like, you know, my higher ups, you know, my, my, my superiors would tell me, Sergeant, you need to shut your mouth. We don't, there's no place for this here. We don't need it. It's a waste of time.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  And now here, here we are, you know, 10 years later, and I'm out and I have all my Marines contacting me going, Holy crap, Sergeant, you were right. You know, everything you told us is coming true. How'd you know?
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  And I always drop your name. Remember Alex Jones. And they're like, Oh yeah. Okay. I'm out now that now it's now it's coming together.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  And by the way, brother, that's the only way we're going to stay on air is that word of mouth. And now more than ever, people have to hear that information. I know what I'm stating is obvious. But again, that's why listeners have to understand you are beyond critical.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  You are the only hope we've got. And by the way, you're an incredible hope. You are victory. You are the info war. So keep it up because now people have to hear the other information. The next side of the equation sounds even crazier, but it's all going to be revealed.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  And it's all going to be coming out in the open. And so that's why it's so important. But yeah, the normal response when you're being illegally listened to by appliances is to tell people now look at wall way and how the Pentagon's banning that on basis.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  And now other big tech is spying on the Pentagon. And now the chai comms are pulling out all the US telecom stuff because we're spying on them. This is part of a giant awakening to this digital AI infrastructure that's anti human and is going to be misused against everybody that we need to be honest about.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  But the architecture has been built wrongly with backdoors to abuse everyone by the satanic global deep state. That is the new world order because there's not just the American deep state. There is a worldwide planetary satanic deep state.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Our deep state is only one tentacle of this, this creature, just like in the Stephen King novel it the clown is just the anglerfish's finger that it dangles out there. And so that's an amazing thing. Thank you, Sergeant.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Wow, we spent a whole segment with him, but he was a great caller. You're all great. We're going to get to everybody here. I appreciate everyone listening on this live Wednesday broadcast news wars dot com.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  It's time to take yourself to the next level. It doesn't matter if you're a man, doesn't matter if you're a woman, doesn't matter if you're old or young. As you age, preglonone levels in the body go down.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  Now in 60 seconds I don't have time to tell you what preglonone does but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis and then it just gets wilder from there.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  Medical science knows all about this but they suppress information about preglonone. We've got the best form of preglonone with a bunch of high quality vitamins and minerals in real red pill. Real red pill plus has some added energy as well.
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  Now you can get it for 65% off with a free bottle of Biotrus selenium that's from the mustard seed. The two go together in an incredible way.

[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  If it isn't broken then you can't fix it. That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us. This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post-human error.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet. This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do. It's the healthy thing to do. It's the thing that makes all of our lives better and that's taking care of our individual health.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  It's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season than to go to infowarstore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life changing in what they will do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life, your focus, your health, your stamina, your libido.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  But then of course it also funds the info war that is so incredibly critical. Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that the true 360 win?
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:33:07.000]  Spend your money on high quality products and have huge savings and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at infowarstore.com. That's infowarstore.com. Please make the right decision.
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  So let's play this out. They never told Trump about the concerns. Is it fair to say they came a point to where Surveiling Carter Page became unlawful?
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  I will let the court decide that. The court has this report and will make that decision.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  Let's put it this way. If you don't have a legal foundation to surveil somebody and you keep doing it, is that bad?
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  Absolutely.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  Is that fine?
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  It's illegal surveillance. It's not court authorized surveillance.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  Whatever illegal surveillance means, they did it.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  So all this stuff that they did in a legally surveilled Trump's campaign, they did because they had no legal basis after the January 2017 data dump by the Russian guy to believe that the dossier was reliable.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  They altered a sculptor information in June of 2017 that would have further proven that Carter Page is not a Russian agent. He was actually working with the CIA.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  Let me ask you very directly. Do you believe Carter Page is or ever was an agent of the Russian government trying to do harm to his country?
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  I'm going to refer to the evidence we found here, which is that at the end of this, the FBI at the end of these vises told us that they had found no evidence.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  And then I don't know why on the Twitter clip they cut off. He says, no, I have the transcript. He said no evidence of any of that. Again, getting me good clip for everybody right now. It's on YouTube.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  I can send it to the crew if they'd like.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  Go into Lee Stranahan, who lives in D.C. as the syndicated show Fault Lines Radio. He's in England, the U.K. for this big election that's a referendum on nationalism versus globalism.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  And there's giant million person marches in France happening right now, huge marches in Germany against the open borders and carbon taxes.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  Europe is really on fire right now and Lee Stranahan's right in the middle of it.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  But I know he wanted to have some comments on the IG report and his sources in D.C. and what he thinks is coming from Durham.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  If it's going to be more of the same whitewash or there's a real fight going on internally, as the Attorney General Barr has said there is.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  Well, Alex, look, I think I was so happy to see Durham come out right after the Horowitz report came out within a couple of hours and say, we do not agree with the conclusions.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  And look, I'm even glad to see Lindsey Graham show some spine there. He's somebody, I'm not a huge Lindsey Graham fan, but I'm glad to see him show some spine.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  Now, here's what I'm reporting, and this is very important.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  I pinned on my Twitter feed and Alex, you know the way I work. Everything is proven. There's nothing here that's not admitted by the people involved.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  There was a very significant omission in Horowitz's report. That's on page 116, 116 in the report.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  They make reference to the fact that Steel gave them material, gave the FBI material that they got from, and this is a quote from Horowitz, from a friend of a well-known Hillary Clinton supporter.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  Now, the friend and the well-known Hillary Clinton supporter, that is a mischaracterization and these two people are not named by name and who's who they are.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  The well-known Clinton supporter is Sid Blumenthal. The friend of the Clinton supporter is Cody Shearer. I'll talk about him in a second.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  That is a complete mischaracterization. So for one thing, Sid Blumenthal, everyone knows who Sid Blumenthal is, right?
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  He's not a Clinton supporter. He's not somebody who had a bumper sticker that said, I'm with her in the back of his car. That's a supporter, right?
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  He worked for the Clintons and he's worked with the Clintons since 1992 when he was one of the dirty tricks guys.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  Now, Cody Shearer, and what we're talking about here is what's called the second dossier, but as I'll explain, it's really the first dossier.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Alex, this is exactly the center of it, and the reason this is so important is this is what ties Hillary and Bill Clinton right into the Russiagate hopes.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  And that's why Horowitz leaving their names out is so significant.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  What happened was Cody Shearer, who's known Bill Clinton since 1969, since before he knew Hillary, Cody Shearer goes back as far as you can go with Bill Clinton.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  Back to Oxford, where strobe Talbot married Cody Shearer's twin sister, Brooke, okay?
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  Now, Cody Shearer has done this dirty trick stuff for Bill Clinton going back to 1992. He was the one who was going out and scaring Kathleen William.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  He was the one going out dealing with Jennifer Flowers and stuff like that, working with Sid Blumenthal.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  He's a well-known Clinton henchman from their first campaign, and so of course they're connected into the whole nest.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  They're involved going around getting the fake warrants, so go ahead and nail them for us.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  Well, here's what it is. When was Christopher Steele hired?
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  June 2016. The Horowitz report says that. When was Cody Shearer talking to people about his dossier?
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  The answer is March or April. That's in an article by Lee Smith that you can find where he talks about Cody Shearer talking to an ex-CIA guy named Bayer.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  What happened? So in other words, this is the first dossier. Now, let me explain how Sid Blumenthal works. You know this, Alex, but I want people to understand his fingerprints are all over this.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  So I've interviewed a mice show guy named Larry Johnson. Larry Johnson is an ex-CIA analyst who's done some great work over at the website Sixth Emperor Tyrannus.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  Larry Johnson actually worked with Sid Blumenthal. He regrets it now, but to try to help Hillary when she was going against Obama.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  And so here, Larry's told me this and he's named a couple stories. Here's what Sid Blumenthal does. He went to Larry and he said, hey, look, I understand there's a speech where Michelle Obama used the word whitey.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  So go look into that and talk to this source. And so Larry looked into it. There were three different sources that had found that, you know, that had found that, except here's what he found.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  When he looked into it further, he found that all three sources got that information from Sid Blumenthal. So what Sid does is he plants a story here, here and here, just like they did with the dossier.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  The sheer dossier had the same now debunked sex story about Trump that the steel dossier had. And don't forget it came first.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Yes. And so it's in the Horowitz report that Hillary Clinton created the fake trail for the illegal surveillance. And of course, it leads right back to her, which we always knew.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  But it is very interesting. I want to get into the election and what's happening in Europe. But just to pull back 35,000 foot view on this.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  I don't think any of us were surprised by the overall whitewash here, but you're right. There's some nice nuggets hidden there. But what's the lay of the land with the ongoing situation and what Durham's up to from your sources and your research?
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  And what are you expecting there?
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  Well, I think first off, Durham's not going to go probably as far as you or I would like. But that's OK. Because we have pretty high standards. But I think there's going to be indictments. They're already saying, don't forget, that this is a criminal investigation.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  And I think you could even see in that clip you played earlier that Horowitz is now taking a position. I wish, like I say, I have no idea why he left the name Sid Blumenthal and Cody Shear out of the report.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  But you can see that he's tentative. Let's call it that. But he's saying, well, I'm going to let the courts decide if you were to cut out the conclusion part of the Horowitz report and just read the report and come up with your own conclusions.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  You go, this is very damning. Right. And then just right at the end, they go, well, there's nothing, no bias. Well, if there's no bias, how do you account for the fact that there were 17 significant errors and everyone went against Trump?
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  In other words, it's not like there were five errors that helped him and 12 against him. 17 errors are all against Trump. Now, I don't have another explanation.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  Well, they're not errors when you falsify emails. But again, they can't let the investigation go any higher because these people were ordered to do this. And we all know who it leads back to.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  And then what about Carter Page being the CIA operative? I said that back at the beginning. I don't know if he was set up or, you know, whether he was working with him.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  I'll get your brieftake on that. But then I want to just get into the big election in the UK and why you're there and why this is such a big deal.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  And then at least trying to hand the fault lines radio will leave us and we're going to go right to your phone calls of everybody that's holding like Brian and Kevin and Peter and so many others.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  We'll just take calls right through to the end of the show with breaking news as it comes out. At least trying to hand leaves us. Mike Adams is in the fourth hour info wars dot com news wars dot com.

[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  It is Wednesday December 11th two thousand and nineteen your phone calls minutes away. I'm pretty sure by holding Lee Stranahan is in London England for the big elections that start tomorrow.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  Worse Johnson facing the left is trying to move from office but internal polls and public polls show them winning by a wide margin but there's massive election fraud there just like here that's been documented they're trying to leave the EU that they never even voted.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  He's making it go through Congress as he should. I opposed by the way many parts of it but at least it's being put through Congress and Lee Stranahan is there to cover this.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  I wanted to just finish though Lee with Carter Page. I'm not saying Carter Page is a bad guy. I'm not saying he's a good guy. I don't know.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  I just said it's pretty clear a lot of these guys are globalist operatives and these people they claim are CIA or FSB or being funded by FSB.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  I don't think they're just burning their own CIA people. I think they're just having them play along with it in the media to try to give it some credibility.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  And then Page does have a lawsuit of the media tries to say oh you really are still a Russian agent when there's no proof of that and that's defamation.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  What do you really think is going on with Carter Page. I just find it really interesting.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  Well let me give us some inside info Alex Andre Telezenko. We I've been on the show a number of times for the past couple of years.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  We were we were ahead of this. And again God bless you for letting me get the truth out about the Ukraine intervention. We've talked about it many times.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Now Andre Telezenko is the real whistleblower who was working at the Ukrainian Embassy when he was approached by Alexander Chalupa and said hey you need to work with me.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  I'm in the Hillary campaign and he chose not to do it in part because he's a Christian by the way.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  Alla Andre told me that when he was working at the Embassy this would have been back in March and April around that time before any of the Russian hacking stuff before that Washington Post story came out before anybody had heard of Carter Page.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  They at the Ukrainian Embassy and I want you to think about this Alex knew who Carter Page and George Papadopoulos were.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  When nobody ever heard of them. So why is it that the Ukraine. The answer is obvious that this was part of the network that was being set up to frame Trump.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  That was part of what was going on. And so they knew about that and they commented on it immediately. They're like yet Papadopoulos and Carter Page we got to get those guys.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  Now by the way Andre was at an appearance about a year ago on another network and George Papadopoulos was in the green room and he told him that story and I got word to Carter Page as well.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  I'm like look you were being signaled as sing sing singled out right singled out by the Ukrainians that were working with the Hillary campaign before you had any idea who they were.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  So Page is a good guy and so is Papadopoulos. But the point is that he was a CIA asset. They were even then going to set up their own. That is unbelievable.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  Now the time we have left let's shift gears into we can get negative about the globalist and negative about the corruption but it's all out in the open now.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  That is a really positive thing and all over Europe it would take hours to go over it. Giant populist takeovers. Millions marching today as we speak.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  This huge election this referendum on nationalism versus authoritarian globalism. You're there. Why are you in England and give us your breakdown.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  Well this is a big event and I'll tell you what's happened though. It's interesting. The polls have narrowed significantly just in the past two weeks.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  At one point the Tories the conservatives led by Boris Johnson had a 17 point lead. That is now down to single digits and it is rapidly closing. And here's why I think that is.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  It's not that people's thirst for real freedom has gone down. It's that the Brexit that Boris Johnson's presenting them number one is a very watered down version of Brexit.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  So it's taken three years to get through. And now it's basically the same thing that Theresa May was offering when they gave her the boot. Here's the other problem.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  The other problem is that Boris Johnson is not. First off Boris Johnson has never met a regime change war. He didn't like right.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  So with Boris Johnson and the conservatives you're getting a real mixed bag here which is he's promoting himself as I'm the Brexit guy.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  Not really that was Nigel Farage but OK. But but for OK he's promoting himself as a Brexit guy. The Brexit he's offering people is very watered down.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  And there have been a few scandals that have come out that have hurt Johnson that basically it's about the British equivalent of Social Security the National Health Service.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  It's their socialized medicine. But for them it's the equivalent of you know in America right now if you tried to take away Social Security people would go mental.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  And so there were scandals that had come out that they were going to sell the British system out to the corporates. So it wasn't like they were going to open up and make it free and good.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  They were going to sell it to the American corporates. And that has really hurt the conservatives. Now I think what you're going to see the same thing that we saw in Germany.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Italy. Israel. You've seen this all over the world. People can't get a government form basically. I think what you're going to get is a narrow conservative victory.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  And again that's a conservative party over here. And they're not really. And don't forget not all conservatives are pro-Brexit either. A lot of them are remain.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  The people who've tanked completely are the liberal Democrats. The liberal Democrats over here are staunchly remain. And they used to be the dominant political party in England.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  They would win every election. Now they're going to take a big hit. And I think labor is going to take somewhat of a hit and partially the reason why is that Corbyn the leader of the Labor Party over here.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  Corbyn has taken no position on Brexit. Corbyn is. You know I'll tell you who Corbyn reminds me of. Not just because he's a socialist. But here's the thing. He reminds me of Bernie Sanders.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  Because whatever criticisms you know I don't like socialism right. But who do you like better Sanders or Hillary Clinton. That's a bad choice right. But I like Sanders better than Hillary Clinton because she's dangerous in every single way.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  Exactly. That's a really good point. And Boris Johnson has played it off like he's this populist. And clearly it is a watered down version. But it does show the people are aware of globalism.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  They're trying to break away. I personally don't like the Labor Party because of their open borders Islamist stance. And I think the Boris Johnson is going to win. But we'll certainly have you pop in while you follow this.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  When will all the results begin. I know these elections take a few days over there. Well I think we'll know Friday. I think I think on Friday we'll have a very very good idea with exit polling and everything else.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  So the elections on Thursday. I'll tell you one thing. It's interesting Alex being here in London walking around the streets. You would have no idea there's an election tomorrow. You'd know Christmas is coming up.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  It's a London Christmas. I've never been here before. But it's very Christmassy. But I'm telling you people are so fatigued. Brexit for the people in Great Britain is is like our Russia gate. Most people are just sick of it.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  They don't know I understand. And that's what the globalist one is to drag it out. But in the end globalism is dead least ran a hand. Thank you so much.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  Thank you Alex. Great having him on. A lot of wonderful insights. Great journalist. All right. I promise we start the next hour. I'm giving you all the floor. I'm getting better about going to calls.

[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  I do have ADHD but you know I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties you know I kind of got a little out of hand and you know I listen you religiously in my truck every day.
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche this product changed my life but turbo force really changed my life.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  He was dead no longer take Adderall and I get by literally 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force and if you take a half a packet that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus you know a monster which is what 499 and you know I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  And if anybody's on the fence they really have to try it.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  We're really proud of turbo force so thank you sir commit to buy a lot of your products at M4store.com then help us spread the word let's just get busy M4store.com.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  Twilight is here the sun is setting on 2019 and we hurdle into the year 2020 only 330 days out from this incredibly historic election.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  And it's more important than ever to pray for President Trump and to pray for his provision and his protection he's completely surrounded and to pray for him to have discernment.
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  And to be bold and to take action and not listen to the advisors that tell him to hold back and that if he goes after the deep state that they'll remove him from office.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  They're trying to remove him regardless because they know that God put him in office and that he's going to continue his work and he's going to continue exposing him and bringing them down.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  But that if he doesn't execute in that office that God's given him that the globalist could win.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen now is the time more than ever to pray for President Trump and please pray for him for worse and please pray for all the children being targeted by the globalist.
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  Thank you and God bless you all.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  Alright I'm dedicated to taking your calls because I love the directions and the wildcards you take us in.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  And I'm going to your calls right now.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  I got to tell you I'm really proud of Caitlin Bennett, Millie Weaver, Will Johnson, Owen Troyer and more of our crew that is on the East Coast at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings right now ahead of the impeachment trial.
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  Millie Weaver is live tweeting from inside incredible developments where I guess Lindsey Graham is found as Cajones and is saying that it's like Jig or Hoover's back from the dead at the level of persecution of Trump and others and the press by the rogue FBI.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  The president can't even get control of these people.
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  Shifts got more power than president because their operatives are all in there but they're just exposing themselves. This happened in the 70s. The deep state took out Nixon.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  It then unraveled and took a bunch of them out for a while.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  Then their underlings came in with Bush but this time it's not going to be that way.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  This is a big deal. Positive things are happening. And then Owen and the crew out in Hershey, Pennsylvania last night, that incredible footage of the armored vehicle coming up in their designated area, loudspeaker, the Antifa.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  Just incredible footage at infowars.com and newswars.com, but especially on Millie's Twitter and Owen's. It's just incredible how you're keeping us in the game and how our crew is rising to the occasion.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  I'm really proud of what we've done and I should be more happy and more positive. I just get so pissed at the globalists. We all have to be very thankful to God.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Peter in Michigan. Peter, thanks for holding your trooper. Go ahead.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  Hi, Alex. I just wanted to hear your opinion on what do you think the probability is of any meaningful arrest of like deep state actors happening while Trump is president?
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  Because I took locker open as a campaign promise. It's pretty disappointing to see them attack him so unlawfully and nothing really happened.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  Well, that's really the big question and I accurately predicted that the IG report would say no conscious criminal activity and that the investigation was opened properly.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  But then you read it and he admits they were illegally spying. So even if you know something is illegal, it's illegal, or if you don't know it's illegal, it's illegal.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  Knowing it makes it more of a crime, but crimes have been committed. They must be prosecuted and I don't think Barr is just stalling now what I've been watching, what I've been seeing.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  I think he's trying to get indictments to move forward. I think they know they have to because the globalist chai con funded deep state is so unamerican, so virulent, so doddering, so dangerous that even other sections of the power structure that aren't really even, you know, pro America,
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  they just see why wreck the country for no reason. Why would a bunch of crazy people run in the ground and cause a civil war just because they have existential envy for the Republic.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  And so we've already seen incredible fireworks with Trump. It's not moving as fast as we want. But if I had to be a betting man, I think there's going to be some indictments low level folks and then they're going to start turning states evidence.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  And I think that if Trump could stop election fraud and get in in 2020, I think by then you will see them move against the deep state. That's why they're so scared.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  He's already been trying to move against them. He's already been trying to get us out of these endless wars. And the truth is coming out about Afghanistan being a fraud.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  And so that's why it's such a battle right now. Trump just doesn't have enough good men and women under him to execute his orders.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  So it's a battle. I don't know. I think it's I think it's 5050. I think it's up to us to I guarantee you if every event Democrats went to people jumped up and yelled at him with information and if Congress got legally and lawfully took over by protesters during all this,
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  I guarantee you we'd end up winning. But they need to see the energy from the people and that will translate into the so-called leaders because most of these people aren't leaders.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  They're puppets of the globalist and we're put there because they go with which way the wind blows. Well, then I'm here to give them the wind like the great North wind and let them know.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  Set our people free. Let us go out of Egypt. Thank you for the call. More calls in 60 seconds. I'm Alex Jones. This is the info war, not a spectator sport.

[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:15.000]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind. Well, Lindsey Graham, since his handler, John McCain made the jump into hyperspace has been growing a bigger and bigger set of eggs. Here he is.
[2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  To your team. You were able to uncover and discover abuse of power. I never believed would actually exist in 2019.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  How bad is it? Is this it was is was as if Jagger Hoover came back to life. The old FBI, the FBI that had a chip on its shoulder and wanted to intimidate people and find out what was going on in your life and the law be damned.
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  Martin Luther King and just fill in the names.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  The Jagger Hoover FBI was a lot better than the one we got now. But I get what he's saying. I mean, I'm.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  It's on record that.
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  Ted Gunderson ran the Co until pro against Martin Luther King.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  And made up a lot of the fake stuff. Some of it was true.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  Sent letters to his wife harassed him. He apologized for that before it even ever got declassified.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  But.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  The current FBI at the top is run by a bunch of anti American globalist leftist, but I get his point the corruption, the intimidation that we know the FBI has been caught doing decades ago is going on again.
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  And it's going on against the president and his supporters.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  And it's illegal.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  And it's out of control and they falsified records.
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  The only shot the FBI has.
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  Of not being totally discredited.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  Is prosecutions of the people that did this.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  And I get it goes all the way up to Obama and clapper good.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  We at least need criminal investigations opened. We need their asses indicted.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  They're trying to remove our president and done jack squat. They're attacking us and we haven't done anything. They've done everything.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  And let me tell you, I don't want to go the way of a banana Republic. We're very close. I don't want to discredit.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  Institutions in this country. There are institutions. We need to take control of them.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  We need to fix the government. It's never going to be perfect. We're all just people, but this one's out of control and rogue.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  You look at the arrogance of Strach and Page and McCabe on TV.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  And you look at Comey saying see Trump lied. We never spot on him. The damn report admits it.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  In fact, I'm going to your calls, but let's play this clip. This is.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  The former deputy director who became the acting director McCabe.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  On CNN last night and the headlines were, you won't believe what Trump got caught doing with the Russians.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  So I'm like, well, what's this? I knew it would be BS. Look, he had Lavrov behind the desk where he could get the secrets.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  And they're just like, he claims he's not a Russian. My God, either there's a Russian right there.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  I mean, you can't let him in the war room. I mean, they'll see, they'll see the big board.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  This is right out of Dr. Strangelove type stuff. And then I looked it up.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  I typed in Russian foreign ministers, Russian ambassadors in the White House.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  And there's all these photos of them at the oval desk and all the rest of it.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  But McCabe lies and says, we've never seen this before because the standard is the president can't talk to the Russians.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  If he does that, he's a Russian agent. When Eisenhower and Kennedy and others are on record getting drunk with them,
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  you can pull that up in articles. Yeah, there's one from BuzzFeed. Scroll the bottom. There's shots of them getting drunk together.
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  I mean, the idea of all of this is just insane. But that's what they're saying.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  And now the Democrats are saying, oh, we're still going to impeach him too for Russia. I played that first hour.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  And you can then find and click each visit and find them in the Oval Office. Brezhnev, all of them. They are getting drunk right there.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  I mean, this is just next level, ladies and gentlemen, that the president can't talk to the Russian foreign minister.
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  He's trying to paralyze everything.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  And then whenever Trump smiles at a Russian leader, they go, look, he's smiling. He shook his hand.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  What do they say when they talk? Oh, my gosh. I mean, don't believe me. Hear it from McCabe.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  I mean, you talk about lying to people. He's like, and then the host put her head down, just going, I just can't believe it.
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  This is taking normal behavior and turning it into something bad by these crazy people who openly hate America and tell us they hate the country.
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  But oh, we're impeaching him because he's endangering the nation with his abuse of power.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  Well, these are the people that don't want the country to exist in their opening statements in who they are.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  America sucks. It was never great. No borders, no walls, no USA at all. I said, I'd go to your calls, going to him.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  But you got to see this. This is McCabe, who reportedly has been indicted.
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  And the deputy head of the Justice Department didn't block it from getting killed months ago. That's confirmed.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  But he's still up there on CNN. Here it is.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  The president, obviously, we've had years go by here that he's spotted and called it a witch hunt and a hoax.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  And he meets with Lavrov today. The last time he met with Lavrov, of course, was the day after he fired Jim Comey.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  After everything that you know about this president and about the Russian investigation, do you believe that there's something truly off about Trump and Russia?
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  There's no question. There's something deeply odd about the way this president interacts with Russia.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  We have never seen anything like this before. You go back to the Helsinki meeting.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  You go back to all the claims that you just made denying the, or at least downplaying the effect of Russian meddling in the last election.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  I mean, that is just behavior we've never seen from a president. Russia is our most significant enemy on the world stage.
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  You've got to be absolutely on your game with each one of your interactions.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  I don't think we've ever seen a photograph out of the Oval Office along the lines of the one we saw today with Lavrov essentially almost standing behind the president, behind the resolute desk.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  It's remarkable. Maybe outdone only by the last photograph that Lavrov took in the Oval Office, which was taken, of course, by his own photographer because we didn't have one there.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  And Trump says he brought up election meddling. Lavrov says that he didn't, but then Lavrov brought it up and it's unclear exactly what happened.
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  Lavrov's exact comment was, well, you know, we haven't even actually discussed elections. What do you think happened?
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  Do you think that the president of the United States, after years of denying Russian meddling and saying that it could be, you know, some fat person in a basement, is his words?
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  Do you think that he now suddenly is bringing it up in a serious, meaningful way?
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  Really, really hard to imagine, right? And I think that, you know, the bigger point here is that this administration has such a terrible record of transparency and readouts from important phone calls and meetings in the White House.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  And of course, a terrible record of dealing with the truth that when you have a meeting in an incredibly important statement like this that they claim to have made, people can't help but step back and say, well, I'm really not sure.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  Oh my gosh, so he denied he's a Russian agent and then what do you do? Here he is with him, meeting with him.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  I mean, you saw, he was talking to one of, he had him in there behind him, like all the school kids that come in and all other foreign leaders.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  Wow, man. Let me tell you, I was supporting Trump, but after this, I don't know, this is the, I mean, they're paralyzing the president is what's happening.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  He can't talk to foreign leaders on the phone. He can't have people in for a meeting.
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  I mean, all the presidents have a red phone to Russia and China to talk to whoever they want, whenever they want.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  It's constantly going on. It should be going on.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  But when Trump talks to, I mean, I'm done talking about this. I know the audience gets it. It's just next level.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  And then Andy McCabe is the guy who lied to Congress.
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  They told Trump there was no illegal and there was an investigation going on of him when he knew and was involved running it.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  He lied to the president. He lied to Congress. He constantly lies.
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  And he just sits up there and says, the president has a problem with truth. There's only so much of this crap I can take.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  I don't know about you, but he's raping our president and our freedom and our nation and raping the name of all these agencies that now,
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  if you think they're bad people in these agencies now, they corrupt these agencies on purpose so that good people get out and then the bad people go and get in.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  This is all a process. The pedophilia, the homelessness, all this globalist garbage is designed to just get you to give up and throw your hands up.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  Well, you know what? I'm not giving up and we're close to breaking these people down.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  But man, I'll tell you, I'm not an vindictive mean person. I don't wish really harm against anybody, but I really do want to see that arrogant little bastard,
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  Andy McCabe, in an orange jumpsuit. I want to see him in prison. I want to see Comey in prison. I want to see Hillary in prison.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  I want to see Brennan more than anybody. Oh my God, don't you want to see him in prison? I mean, they are just arrogant scum.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  They need to be brought to justice. Damn it.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  I don't want to see him in prison.

[2:18:52.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  And they do what they do because they're slaves, because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God. And that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  Kevin in Los Angeles wants to get into the impeachment process and the Democrats. So let's go to him right now and then I've got a comment about it.
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  Mitch McConnell wants to hurry it through and get it done, which is what Trump first said two weeks ago.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  And then Trump sees how it's media coverage for weeks and weeks on the other side. He wants to drag it out.
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  I have a view on that. I'll tell you after the caller gives us his tag. Kevin, thanks for calling. Thanks for holding. Welcome.
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  Hi, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say, you know, I live in deep in the heart of demon rat territory.
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  I get to talk to these people almost every single day.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  And a vast majority of them are brainwashed, mind controlled. You can't get through to them. They won't even talk to you.
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  I even have my neighbor one day. I was talking about impeachment and asking him what he thought about it.
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  He's a known Democrat. I know that he is. He's all for child sexualization, all this stuff that's going on in schools out here.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  He can't even give me an answer. A vast majority of these people just give you a flat out, I don't talk politics.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:05.000]  And then when you ask them why you don't talk politics, because it's the reason why we're such in this quagmire that we're in.
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  They just walk away, put their hands over their ears.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  Well, that's it. They're just slaves. They just do what they're told and fight back against those that don't want to be slaves.
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  Yeah, they don't care. They have no inklinging of what's really going on.
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  Well, that's it. They don't want to care. They're lost. They will only stand up to keep us from being free. They have no energy unless it's meant to make us do something,
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  because they fundamentally understand that they're parasites that have joined with the evil that feed off of us.
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. And they're just downright evil individuals.
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  It is a spiritual battle that we are facing here. I'm a Christian and I get my life over to God when I was 11 years old and raised a Baptist.
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  And I have Christian fundamental, you know, I just live my life according to God.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  And these people are completely and totally ungodless. They have no God.
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  And you ask them if they believe in a higher power or anything else for that matter. They don't even have a straight answer for that.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  They're completely lost and delusional and they just sit and watch TV all day.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  This is the thing that I always get into when I'm having conversations with these people is, you know what the most pervasive item of electronics that is in everyone's home?
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  And it's a television. And then I go on and I tell them, do you think that the corporations, the massive corporations that fund and run these systems don't have an agenda behind it?
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  Well, you can turn it on. It's unified worldwide. Destroy the family, poison us, literally mutilate our children.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  They're putting chemicals and everything. Now they're publicly saying give us chemicals to sterilize us. You're absolutely right, Kevin.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  And it's only going to get worse. And then those of us that are awake are going to have to rebuild civilization.
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  And I mean, you're out there in LA. I'm here in Austin to watch how they will collapse the civilization around you is just crazy.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  And the madness that they're given over to is getting worse and worse where here's the good news and it's also bad news.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  The left is gone off the edge of the cliff. They're degenerating very, very fast.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  And so they're not even going to be able to function and put their pants on in a couple of years.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  And so they're a threat right now because they're still somewhat operable, somewhat mobile ambulatory.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  But that's not going to be the case very long. They are. Once you give yourself over to the spirit of death, the wages of sin are death.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  These people are going to, they're already happening, are just going to start committing suicide and dying right in front of us.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  And we can't get bummed out by all the evil and ourselves hurt ourselves or commit suicide.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  We have to serve justice, serve freedom, not worry about ourselves and stand up for the children and speak out for them and we'll be empowered.
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  God bless you and I appreciate your call. Here's the point I was going to make.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  Yes, impeachment is discrediting the Democrats.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  But if Trump lets them expand these hearings in the Senate, they're going to launch a bunch of staged events during the hearings.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  And they're going to bring forward a bunch of fake witnesses and other scandals.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  And so I think McConnell's right just to get this through as fast as possible.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  I think, I mean, I think McConnell is right to do that.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  But now the Democrats are dragging their feet so it goes through Christmas. It's just, it's about them dominating reality and making you look at them.
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  Would anybody really be looking at Pelosi or Nadler or Hillary or listening to them if they hadn't gotten in power?
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  They want to make you go through them to live.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  The psychic theft is what it is.
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  Okay, he's been holding the longest now.
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  That would be Mike and Texas and we'll go to Carlos in Canada and Dave in New York.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  Go ahead, Mike. Thanks for holding.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  Welcome.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  Two things.
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  I'm not sure if your listeners know, but the time is running out in a couple of days on the petition to pardon Roger Stone.
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  So people need to get on the stick on that one.
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  Number two, I'm curious, whatever happened to Millie Weaver's report on the Kentucky governor's race, did the governor decide to fight that or are the voters there fighting it?
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  What's happening?
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  No, the governor conceded and there was just evidence of total fraud by putting hundreds of thousands of people back on the voter rolls who had never even lived there, including legal aliens, illegal aliens, you name it.
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  And so she followed a bunch of reports on that.
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  Does that answer your question, Mike?
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  Yeah, I was kind of struck by the petition when I went there, I don't know, a week and a half, two weeks ago, that there were only about 14,000 signatures.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  And I thought maybe everyone's just saying, well, someone else is going to sign on to that petition.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  Well, there is a certain fatigue.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  I mean, it's really up to President Trump to pardon Roger Stone. His sentencing is coming up in a few months.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  And so the word is Trump's going to wait and see what happens at the sentencing.
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  We're going to be watching them very, very closely.
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  But yes, I mean, Trump's is standing for Roger Stone, Julian Assange, because these are people that did legal and lawful things.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  And, you know, a lot of it was working with the president and the president did tell Assange to release that information.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  Anything else, Mike?
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  Well, you know, we can at least give a fig leaf of cover to the president to pardon Roger Stone. I'm sure it's going to drive the Libs crazy when he does it.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  But if there's at least some public support for it, you know, there's, like I say, at least a fig leaf of cover.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  No, I totally agree with you.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  But I mean, I don't think he needs the fig leaf, though.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  There's no Russian connection.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  It's supposedly lying to Congress saying he never talked to Assange.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  Instead, he talked to a guy that talked to him.
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  That's that's not illegal.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  This is a kangaroo court.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  It's like he a judge found our Pio guilty.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  No jury was facing five years in prison and Trump pardoned it.
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  Trump didn't know about it till I told him.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  And that's crazy.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  And so we absolutely need to see that happen.
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  Great points, Mike.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  All right, Dave, HB, Carlos, Danny, Sam, Kyle, Jeff, your calls are all straight ahead on the other side of this board.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  This is the info war.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  Attention GCN self reliance listeners.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  Bill Hyde here.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:54.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:03.000]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better.
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:06.000]  And that's taking care of our individual health.
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:17.000]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season than to go to infowarstore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life changing.
[2:30:17.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  And what they will do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life, your focus, your health, your stamina, your libido.
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  But then of course it also funds the info war that is so incredibly critical.
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that's a true 360 win?
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  Spend your money on high quality products and have huge savings and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:54.000]  That's infowarstore.com. Please make the right decision.
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:08.000]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:15.000]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[2:31:15.000 --> 2:31:26.000]  We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God.
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:48.000]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post-human error.
[2:31:48.000 --> 2:31:54.000]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet. This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  At current sales rates, we're going to sell out of Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus by the end of the year.
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  But despite that, I'm still offering it at 65% off for those of you that have never experienced what is in the Real Red Pill and in the Real Red Pill Plus.
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  There is no one formula that you're going to find out there that is more game-changing.
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  It's 65% off right now. That's very close to cost with a free bottle of our best-selling Biotru Selenium for the mustard seed.
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  These two formulas go together and will supercharge your energy, your focus, your entire body.
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  The globalists know about this but have been suppressing it.
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:46.000]  Take advantage of it now. The Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus combo at Biotru Selenium at infowarstore.com and help yourself, your family and the Info War.
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:54.000]  Again, do your Christmas shopping for yourself and your family. You need to try the Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus and Biotru Selenium for yourselves.
[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:25.000]  On Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  I'm somebody that likes to mind my own business. But if I find out somebody's hurting innocent people and if I find out somebody's organizing evil, I'm going to oppose them.
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  Because I get that kind of instinct to not want to be at the forefront, to not want to grandstand, to not want to raise the alarm, but not want to yell and scream.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  But that's what you're supposed to do when you've got big problems.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  And so I'm sitting here looking at all the stuff going on and we need to expose the evil and the fact that it's being organized by really bad people who enjoy carrying out evil
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  because good people have not done anything that creates a vacuum where evil takes over. This is just science.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  And then it's only going to get worse till we oppose it. So yeah, it's a long, hard haul.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  It's the animating contest of liberty. But it's just like jogging or lifting weights or building a cabin in the woods.
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  I mean, you put the labors into something, you get great results back from it. I'm going to your calls here in a moment.
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  I have not really done any photo shoots or video shoots in shorts and a t-shirt. I'm going to do some, I think, next week.
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  I haven't weighed in a couple weeks. Last time I checked, I lost about 32 pounds in the last 90 days.
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  It's been about 110 days since I've been religiously taking the supplements. And that's really the big change I've made.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  And I know I've lost more weight than that now because all of my pants are falling off, including 36s.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  And I was up to 42s in a few years before that, where I initially lost some weight. I was up to about 44s about 10 years ago.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  So I'm at 36 right now. And it's baggy in the legs until you get up to my rear end. It's still pretty big, big muscles.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  But the products really are amazing. And when I'm pissed off and want to unscrew somebody's head, I just bang,
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  took some krill oil, and 30 minutes later, I'm already feeling it and feel calm. It gives you calm energy.
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  And that's what the write-ups about high-quality krill oil and fish oil, krill is just even stronger for every amount you take.

[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  There's too many to get into all of them, and I'm just going to leave it at that and trust that you'll make the right decisions.
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  And thank you for, I mean, look at how we're hitting on all cylinders.
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  Our reporters are all over the news again today, getting key questions out.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  Took over the Trump rally, got in the face of the leftist.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  You've got viral videos out of that informing everybody. It's information war, spurring others to go out and be vocal and hit the streets.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  With 327 days out of the election, our mission is beyond critical. You understand it. You know it.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  For me, though, I've got to really sit back and take a breath and go, wow.
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  I felt led by God 26, 7 years ago to get on air, took me a couple years to get on air.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  And 25 years later, we've all done some incredible things, and it's all because you thought we could change the world with me.
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  I mean, really, that's the magic.
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  We can pray all day to God and we know God's real and God gives us discernment and providence.
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  But God counts on us. God works through us.
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  And I think about what we've done just on a daily basis. I should be euphoric.
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  Instead, I'm completely driven and pissed off and I'm not doing enough.
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  But that's why we are game changing.
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  I mean, all of our reporters are just kicking ash because we really came to fight.
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  And it's your prayers that are literally energizing our reporters.
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  I'm not going to get into it. I'm going to go to your calls.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  But my discernment has gone way up to almost, oh my God, this is a little too much.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  Like, can you back off a little bit?
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  It's like, no, you said you wanted this here. You want that?
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  And it's getting wild.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  And I'm trying to gauge it and deal with it and handle it.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  And I apologize. I'm a jerk sometimes on air and off.
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  It's because just talk about like, it's like being autistic,
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  where there's just so much data coming in, so much happening.
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  It's like, because, you know, because you care.
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  You're not sticking your head in the sand.
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  I get why a lot of people clam up because reality is intense.
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  But you know what? Living in a false reality is called spiritual death
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  and I will not be part of it.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  But it is intense and I know it's intense and you're intense.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  And I'm very honored. You're listening and watching.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  I love you. I appreciate you and I am humble for your support.
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  God bless you. But I, I'll admit it.
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  Seeing how we just get better and better and more effective.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  Now I am just enraged by them trying to shut us down behind the scenes
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  and the stuff that's going on and just, I've got to control it.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  And I prayed to God to just get me where I'm not like a race car driver
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  that keeps going at 8,000 RPMs.
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  You don't have to race the engine blows.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  We've got to just, you know, cool it back a little bit sometimes.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  All right. Who's been on the longest now?
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  That'd be Kyle in Texas and then Carlos in Canada.
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  Kyle, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  Hello, Alex. Can you hear me?
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  Yes, sir. Thanks for calling.
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  Thank you for having me.
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  My name is Kyle. I'm 22 years old and I live in Dallas, Texas.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  And Alex, I'm contacting you today right now
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  because we have the most huge opportunity
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  that we as humans have ever had in our lives.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  We have the opportunity to literally turn our dreams into reality.
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  Alex, you don't understand how powerful and how just how big this moment is.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  Like we have the ability to actually expose what's happening in our government,
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  the people that own our grocery stores, the people that own our restaurants.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  We have the ability to really make a change.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  So I'm contacting you. I told your producers.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  I'm contacting you about ideas and I know what I know.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  I have ideas and immediate things that I know can help my brothers and sisters.
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  And Alex, I heard you were saying you're tired of people being lazy and stupid.
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  But Alex, I'm telling you, I grew up in poverty, you know, I'm from Texas.
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  I'm black and white.
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  And Alex, what it really is, is no one has ever just had to help.
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  Alex, I mean, and I don't look down for it. You've grown up with a way.
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  You've never, I mean, actually, I've never known you.
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  So I don't know if you've ever had a struggle for food and stuff.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  But Alex, you don't understand how powerful it is to finally know the truth of our reality.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  You know, like it, my brother.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  No, you're right. We can look at people that have never had a chance to see reality living in Plato's cave
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  and say, what's their problem?
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  But I understand they've been in the dark so long that you can't blame them because they just don't know.
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  That's why Christ said we have to set the cap as free.
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  No, no, I don't worry. God did not pamper me growing up.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  So and I had a lot of little special, special training sessions God gave me.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  So I'm definitely not sheltered, my friend.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  I've seen things few people have, believe me.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  Yeah. And so I'm like I say, if I can, I would love to talk to you in the middle of this break for literally a minute.
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  If I could just, you know, like,
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  Brother, you're live on air and I'm glad you care.
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  We love you to death.
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  But just get to it. What's going on? Tell me.
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  My Alex, look, I, it's, we can do it now.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Look, it's, you know, simple, like you, you remember Bill Cooper, Bob Marley, JFK, two pot.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  People have died.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  It's just a simple fact that you need to realize you are a chosen one.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  Alex, you are, you are, you are, you are the Martin Luther King and Jesus of our time.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I wouldn't compare Martin Luther King to Jesus.
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  Well, listen, what I'm telling you is, is that, is that everybody's waking up.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  And it's just because I woke up longer ago that other people waking up now.
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  It's all the exact same thing.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  We have a relationship with Christ and you're right.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  God's spirit's coming into the world a lot stronger.
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  But we don't want to ever confuse the people with God that God is shining through in little limited ways compared.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  But I hear what you're saying and it's exciting.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  And so now is the time to tell people, do you want the pro human future or the pro Satan future and really decide which side we're on?
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  I think that choosing is what's there.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  Write me a letter.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  I read most of them that come in.
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  PO Box is on the deal.
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  Call me back again.
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  I understand you're excited.
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  Too much to cover at all.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  More calls coming up.
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  Thank you.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  God bless you.
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  All right.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  Tons of calls straight ahead and I'm going to host a little bit at the next hour that Mike Adams is always informative.
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  He's beyond informative.
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  He has been.
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  Everybody's on fire.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  That's a guest here.
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  But he has been absolutely like a flamethrower of truth with these many documentaries he's been making at Bandod video.
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  Andy in Florida.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:56.000]  Thank you, Andy.
[2:42:56.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  Hey, Alex.
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  I love you, man.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  We love you.
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your products.
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  A little bit about me.
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  I'm 245 pounds.
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short.
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand and, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche. This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  He was there no longer take Adderall and I get by literally 13 hours a day.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, 499.
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  And I, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is.
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  We're really proud of turbo force.
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  So thank you sir. Commit to buy a lot of your products at infowarstore.com.

[2:45:55.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it. That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  This is the force seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post human error. This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet. This is the crossroads resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:24.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Don't forget the war room. He'll be on it today from the road there in DC. Also, they're going to New York covering all the impeachment garbage. Savannah Hernandez is hosting and doing a great job.
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  They're on radio and TV stations that pick it up across the country. Okay, Sam in Texas and Carlos, Sam in Texas, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. There are new levels of wokeness when someone comes into the Info War and the higher ones are getting back to God, studying the faith, looking again into the Bible.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  All these glitter bug preachers. Everybody's figured out that their purpose to steal their money. But there's a social plan that goes along with that too. And that is to ruin and scald people so that once they're burned, they give up on community.
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  They give up especially on financial partnership and on giving. And so I absolutely that's why that's why Sanders and Warren are trying to ban the tax reductions for Christmas giving.
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  You're absolutely right. The whole modern church is about turning people away from God. Absolutely.
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  That's a fact. And I just encourage people to reach out. If you're one of these people that doesn't fellowship and maybe once was around a fellowship and where you were a giver.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  And then you just saw that the whole thing was a shill. I would say God's economy is giving. Make some new friends. If you don't want to join a Bible study, start your own.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  You know, we've got. Oh, that's a great point. If you don't want to be with all these clicks and weirdos, start it yourself. But here's what's even more important. There's a major revival happening right now.
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  And it's not from people that are like Pharisees who just want power and control. People are having a relationship with God and people see the evil.
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  I know a lot of atheists and people that are becoming real Christians. And they hear this show. They're like, yeah, we don't like mainline church.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  We don't like all the, you know, the can't and all the thumping and all the we're better than you. And, you know, all that.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  That's just another form of political correctness, but a real relationship with God and saying, I don't want to be with the devil. I don't want to be with the pedophiles.
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  I don't want to be with people know that Satan is real and evil. They're running, trying to find God. Well, like Christ said, you're not going to find it in that synagogue of Satan.
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  When he was pointing at that church run by corrupt Pharisees, that's in the Bible. He said, you're going to find it with a personal relationship.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  The thing with heaven is within you. When you make that contact with God, then you find your brothers and sisters.
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  And that's why he went to the tax collectors and the prostitutes and everybody, not that he was endorsing tax collectors and prostitutes.
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  They were the most hated groups, but he was going to them to find people that weren't trying to take control of the church of that day. Does that make sense?
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  100%. Today, I am in the eighth chapter of the book of Judges, a book that's full of wars. And we can look at these books, look at these stories and see how God delivered, how His prophets and how His line warriors prevailed against their enemies.
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  By the way, in that particular one, they caught 77 princes of the city, put them in the stocks and chastised them, whipped them with thorns and briars of the desert.
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  So we want to talk about dealing with the deep state. The typology is in the Bible again and again and again and again.
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  But the point I want to leave the listeners with is if you're not giving financially, you're not the part of the solution that God wants you to be.
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  And you know, you don't have to give to Alex Jones. I encourage that and I do. But you can even pick one of the young reporters, pick somebody, reach out to them.
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  They've all got patreons. You know, so many are out there that host this or that show. Savannah's out there. Millie's out there.
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  They've all got a patreon. You can reach out to them and be a partner and be a friend and we can rebuild society before the dude who hits the fan.
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  Sam beautifully said, God bless you. I got to jump into everybody because Mike Adams is coming up. Let me just say this.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  People ask, well, why does, why does Millie Weaver and why does Caitlin Bennett have patreons if they're your reporters?
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  The travel is $100,000 alone for Caitlin. She wants to work every day, everywhere she goes. She gets 200, 300, 400,000 views.
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  She's waking, she's, I walk through the store. People are like, oh, we love Caitlin Bennett. She's got a two person crew. That's three of them.
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:55.000]  They stay at $40, $50 a night hotels. They don't, I mean, and I, it's a hundred grand just for the expenses. I pay that.
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  It was a hundred grand last year, but so far this year, like 80 something grand last year. And then I pay them per video and I pay for other things.
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  But it's maxed out. It doesn't exist. I bought an RV for the Weavers, not a super fancy one, but a decent one.
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  So they could save money than not the hotels. And that's been the last year and it's almost saved back the amount of money for travel.
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  And they're driving around with their, you know, two children doing it. And, you know, they're not getting rich, but it's that extra money that gets donated to them.
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  Exactly. Let's them then jump on planes and stuff because I got it capped at like a hundred and something thousand.
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  And that's what's frustrating is I could do so much more with all these reporters with Will Johnson with everybody. Will's like, I want to go to this.
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  I want to go to that. And I'm like, oh, we don't have the money. I mean, it takes a lot to send them all up there to these events to have the armored vehicle up there to have two security guys.
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  They both drive the vehicle with the truck that big and he's going to look out the window on the other side. You don't run folks over.
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  But we've got a team of like 10 people on the on the East Coast right now.
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  And it's the just plain tickets and armored vehicles and everything.
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  It was a lot of you have an armored vehicle. It's already paid for half itself in the last few months.
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  We can see the numbers coming in from the traffic and purchases of items that then we plow right back into the fight.
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  But this is a war and it takes money.
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  I've had Hillary Clinton's law firms pull all this. We've beaten most of their fake lawsuits, but they've got it.
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:19.000]  Well, wrote it on a lot of fronts and I've got plans. I can keep the transmissions going indefinitely.
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  I just need a lot of capital and I'm going to leave it at that.
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  OK, a lot of new things are you're going to see three, four months. I'm leaving it at that.
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  A lot of stuff. OK, and I'm not going to get into strategy and things like that here.
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  The enemy's watching right now. But believe me, they're messing with us the way they have and death threatened me and all the scams they pulled has not made me not have energy.
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  In fact, it's the opposite. And so you've got my commitment. I have never been this focused.
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  I have never been this aggressive. I have never. I mean, I can't handle it. I'll be honest with you. I mean, it's too intense right now.
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  I jumped out of bed at 5 a.m. like a jump of Jack. I had to make myself go to sleep.
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  I want to fight, fight, fight. I'm never giving up. These people are so evil. How the hell could we roll over to these people?
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  It's not going to happen. And I can feel your will and strength rising up and it's amazing.
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  And I am so thankful and just I just we've got to stay in this game.
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  Just do your Christmas shopping with us, folks, and support our local M&F stations and thank them as well.
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  And absolutely start your own shows. Go to City Council and speak. Go to Congress and speak. Just get out there.
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  Be leaders. I'm looking for the leaders. You know who you are. Don't count on us to do it all.
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  But the biggest way you can fund and know you're kicking ass on the front lines, money is temporarily in this world.
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  The number one thing that when you do it, it absolutely when money comes into us, you cannot put it anywhere.
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  Like a craps table on a number that's going to come through more hardcore.
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  It's just dynamite and they can't stand it. We've got dynamite and lightning bottled, folks.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  We've got you. We've got each other. We've got God. I'm ranting now. I apologize.
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  Carlos in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air, brother.
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  Thank you very much, Alex. You have a great team and I wish them all the best for the holidays, for Christmas and yourself.
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  Thank you, sir.
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  Yeah, what we're experiencing, you know, sometimes a psychiatrist once said, whatever you do, don't try to understand your patient.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  Okay, cure him, but don't try to understand the madness because then you won't get anywhere.
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  What we're witnessing here in the United States, in my opinion, and as a U.S. student of history, we're beginning to experience the Chicago School of Communism.
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  That's what it is. It's the old Leo Strauss idea that you lie. You get people all muddled up, confused.
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  The School of Neocons coming out, big force.
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  You have a power transition that has been deliberately aborted because of the fact that the people that were loyal to the Democrats for eight years
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  were told, hey, listen, wink at an odd, you stay there and bring down this president.
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  90 days, we'll get him out of office, we'll impeach him, we'll get him out.
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  And they run into a man who didn't have enough support, enough people that he could put in place.
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  Dr. Prisinek has said it over and over, you know, get people in place at you, but he didn't have enough.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  His family and a couple of others, you know, Roger Stone, well, they dealt with him.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  Flynn, they dealt with him.
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  You know, Manafort, they dealt with him.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  And now, you know, they're going after Giuliani.
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  That's the communist idea.
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  And that's, in my opinion, what you're experiencing.
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  And they keep throwing all these lies, and we keep returning them like tennis balls, and they keep us lying and lying.
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  That's right. They stay in charge because they set the agenda by always firing new lies that we respond to instead of action and indictments
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  and going and taking the communist rats down. And your Chicago Business School model, 110%, the neocons out of the Trotskyites,
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  they say that's who they are, and it's neocons behind the Democrats.
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  And that's why Trump's in danger, but they haven't gotten the amount of power.
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  It's a stalemate.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  And so I want to ask you, when we come back, Carlos, you're a smart cookie.
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  Where do you think this is going next and what Trump needs to do now?
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  Carlos is very smart. And so are these other amazing callers. He'll finish up.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  Then I'm going to go to H.B. Dave, Jim, Jeff, Ross, and Danny.
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  But that's it because Mike Adams is on at 15 after.
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  And let me tell you, I just cannot say enough about Mike Adams.
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  He's gone from being excellent to being as good as I've ever seen.
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  It's amazing. He's up in his game in the face of the tyranny.
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:49.000]  Driving into the operations center this morning, it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  I need to reach directly out of the audience and just spell out the facts.
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  When you spend your money at places like Dick's Sporting Goods,
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  you're financing a group that gives huge amounts of money to gun control disarming you and your family.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:05.000]  And then when you go down the list and look at these companies like Walmart,
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  did you know they're doing the same thing now?
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  Did you know that almost every big box store, including Target, they're the worst,
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:16.000]  are actually funding the transgender movement targeting children?
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  Do you know what Jeff Bezos and Amazon's up to?
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it'll make your head spin.
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  Why in the hell are we supporting these people?
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:30.000]  Why are you going to buy your Christmas presents for your family from these institutions
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  that hate America and hate your guts?
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  Do your shopping at infowarsstore.com and get great products.
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  And then rest assured, you're funding the resistance, you're funding the voice of liberty and the face of tyranny.
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:59:07.000]  Please shop at infowarsstore.com.
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:14.000]  And so it's very simple.
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:19.000]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see,
[2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  you see, we have to make the effort.
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  110% God will finish the move.
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  I want to attack.
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  I want to go after the globalists and just believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together,
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:37.000]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[2:59:37.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family,
[2:59:42.000 --> 3:00:08.000]  we're in this together.
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  Carlos, finishing up.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:17.000]  I mean, you're laying it out.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:23.000]  We have a rogue network, a deep state, neocon, and leftist that openly now bragged that they're going to remove
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  Trump and block what he wants to do and block the American people.
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  And they say, thank God for the deep state.
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  Thank God we disregard the flyover country and the president.
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  And that's flagrantly illegal.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:32.000]  So it should backfire.
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  They should all be removed and go to prison.
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:39.000]  But if Trump starts losing the stalemate,
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  then they're going to, I guess, become the new royalty and we'll put the bureaucrats and the CIA directors
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  will become kings and queens again and then they will give barony to their children.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:50.000]  And I'm not joking.
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  That's how royalty begins in places like North Korea where we have a third generation dictator.
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  That's right, Alex.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  So what does Trump need to do?
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  Well, Trump has to understand, first of all, that when you're looking at communism, surveillance was everything.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  And surveillance denies people the right to communicate and speak.
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  And when you have surveillance and you can identify people, they're in fear.
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  So you deny them the freedom to be informed.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:30.000]  Now, democracy is more than just a single vote.
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  Democracy is the right to be heard.
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  The right to have an informed vote and surveillance and denial of speech is certainly against democracy.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  And then the third thing is that once you have a decision made through democracy, you're supposed to obey it.
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  You're not supposed to use your personnel and the loyalties from previous administrations to attack the president of the United States.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  And now they're all out in the open. I don't see how they can survive.
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  They're this exposed unless we convert to pure communism, as you just said.
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  The president of the United States has the power and the wherewithal to educate the people on the values of democracy, on the values of the Constitution.
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  I don't think President Trump has dedicated two or three weeks of educating the people about the Constitution.
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  The Washingtonian view of what is to be American and the ideas that will eliminate these communist efforts.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  Look, if you remember, Stalin said, it's not he who votes that counts.
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  He who counts the votes that counts. That's a very, very important line to keep in mind.
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  And that's what they're doing and they've been caught and we know it and you're absolutely right.
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  And Trump must do almost nightly fireside chats and directly himself lay all this out and get people organized to remove these people.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  We have America has cancer and they've been emboldened the deep state by all their open criminal activity.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  And when let me ask this Carlos quickly, when this impeachment fails, and I believe it will, they've got some wildcards, but it's failing now.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  What will they do next? What will they only keep up in the ante and their maniac behavior because no one stops them?
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  They will increase the effort to silence people like info wars or anybody else who has a different opinion.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  Because when you have a different opinion, they'll call your names.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  They'll say you're an anti this or an anti that.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  But the thing is this in Soviet Russia, in Stalinist Russia to disagree with someone to say they would call you an anti Semite was a criminal offense punishable with death.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  Now, if you look at the AVL, that's what they're taking you.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  They're taking you slowly but surely to make it a criminal offense to even say I disagree with you.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  And they'll say, well, that's anti Semitic. Well, there you are.
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  Now, this is all the school of communism coming from Chicago and president, past president Obama really should have transitioned the country over to the new president.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  Regardless how it felt and said, look, we're behind the new president. Go home.
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  But of course they didn't showing how this country is in deep crisis.
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  Wow, Carlos, amazing call. We ought to just take that call and post it to band on video because Carlos, you still there?
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:31.000]  Yes, I am.
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  What should we title this video?
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  Communism is the worst coming from Chicago.
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  Communism or the deep state gets its blueprints from Chicago.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  Communists exactly like that.
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us. Mike Adams coming up.

[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:36.000]  There's a story up on info wars.com where Trump has tweeted out a Avengers comics in game Thanos meme who's like the villain and it's trolling the Democrats and they're all freaking out and saying oh my god he's a dictator he's coming for us.
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  It's called a joke but you know they have mainline sites now that fact check comedians and it's the arrogance of the system where they're going to ban memes they're going to out who made the CNN meme of you know Trump attacking CNN as a wrestler.
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  And it's just crazy how again they think we're so stupid. So here's no viewers Don Lemon freaking out by a meme somebody made and implying again that it's serious here it is.
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  In addition to all the lies and all the blustering at tonight's rally Trump's war room posted a meme on Twitter today showing Trump as a supervillain Thanos from the Marvel Avengers movies dispatching his Democratic enemies.
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  Take a look at this.
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  On the sound day and I recall that the first quarter business.
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  We in junior high school. What the hell. What is this. What. What. What.
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  I cannot believe that I'm even having to report this on the news.
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:18.000]  I know.
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  I can't even believe.
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  This is crazy.
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  This is literally crazy. Are you people insane.
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  Are you are you insane.
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  Go ahead troll the Democrats.
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  Stupid silly.
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:53.000]  You know what that's got you freaking out. Play this stupid juvenile mean game because you because you take yourself so serious.
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  History won't record this mean stupid crap.
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  But history will record this.
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  Oh the seriousness of what is happening.
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  But today is the day that the House of Representatives in the United States of America introduced articles of impeachment.
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  Against President Donald J. Trump the president of the United States of America for committing high crimes and misdemeanors.
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  I love to hear my voice. I love to hear myself talk.
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  They're the people that constantly attack free speech. They're the people that want to shut everybody down.
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  They're the people that call for violence against Trump and myself and his family.
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  And then somebody puts out a joke meme.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  Trump repurposes it puts it out as a joke saying we're not worried about that.
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  They are falling on their faces. He says.
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  You heard the tell history.
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:02.000]  History won't remember your meme.
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  I guess that means Google erased that immediately.
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  D list all the Clinton death list.
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  D list.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  Paul Krugman saying trouble never get the economy to 3%.
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:17.000]  Just D list everything because history will remember me.
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  Not you. Not you. Me.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  Well really on Twitter that's got like 4 million views right now.
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  I'm talking about 50 million.
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  Dude you've got like 100,000 viewers.
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  CNN used to have 10 million viewers an hour.
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:37.000]  You're a joke.
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:39.000]  People aren't tuning out as a competition.
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  They're tuning out because a bunch of pretentious people like you are boring.
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  Boring. Boring.
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  The highest ratings.
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  That CNN ever had.
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  When it came to political guess they even had a national story about it 2013.
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  Since their decline.
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:05.000]  When I was on Pierce Morgan.
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  And for a week they had triple the viewers after I came on.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:11.000]  Because I destroyed him.
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  I chewed him up and spit him out.
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  And that's why they're like oh Jones is banned from any show.
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:19.000]  Because I won't sit there and go along with their talking points.
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:23.000]  Bunch of pretentious trash.
[3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  Got Mike Adams waiting in the wings.
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  I really appreciate you guys.
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  I'm trying to get everybody. I'm getting better about calls aren't I?
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  A little bit better.
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  HB in FEMA region 4. HB thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  Alex good to talk to you again.
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  You woke my wife and I up in 08.
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  Appreciate that.
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:40.000]  Appreciate you.
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  Thank you so much.
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:46.000]  Thank you.
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:11:49.000]  I'll just blast him out here.
[3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  Free Roger Stone.
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  I wish Trump could get a hold of the big media.
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:58.000]  And tell us the TV station on TV.
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  But really my question was how come Biden's quid pro quo.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  I can't say it.
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  In Ukraine is not mentioned by anyone anywhere anymore.
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:09.000]  You covered it. You covered him saying it.
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  I don't think it's going to be a good idea.
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  I don't think it's going to be a good idea.
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:17.000]  To Russia.
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  You know everybody's lied to Congress and no charges against anybody.
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  I'm getting tired of you think Trump will pull the trigger in 20.
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:26.000]  I mean he's trying to pull the trigger right now.
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  It's going click click click. It's misfiring him.
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  He definitely is the real deal.
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  But I don't know.
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  I just know we got to keep the pressure on him brother and we got to get everybody to vote.
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  We got to expose election fraud.
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  And I don't think it's going to be a good idea.
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  I'm going to put my finger on the air. Go ahead.
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  Hi Alex.
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:46.000]  Thanks for having me.
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  We keep hearing about serious failures or illegal spying.
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  Or FISA abuse of power.
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:53.000]  I think we'd all be better off if we just called it what it is.
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  It's perjury.
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  And if we can't convict or prosecute these people for.
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  For perjury.
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:02.000]  For misrepresenting something to a court.
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  I mean I'm a little I'm a little afraid we're going to lose.
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:08.000]  But you're the best. I love listening to you.
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  You're my spiritual guide.
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  Thanks. Thanks for the time.
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  No Dave. Don't hang up. You're my spirit.
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  The listeners are my spiritual guide. But seriously.
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  You're right. Did you notice since this report came out the lies got even crazier.
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  By McCabe and coming like there was never even spying at all.
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:25.000]  The report says doesn't say that.
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  Trump's got Russians right in the White House.
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  Look at it. I mean they it's only encouraged him to get more flagrant hasn't it.
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  Definitely. And the best the best was when you told that story the other day about.
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  Guy walking in seeing something going on with his wife.
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  That was clear as day and the guy who was doing it to his wife gets up and says you stole my car.
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  That was the best story. And that's what's maddening.
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  You know that every night I'm looking at it going am I losing my mind.
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  It's just unbelievable.
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  Well that's because you're coaching smart Dave.
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  You know what's going on. I mean listen to you.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  You can form a sentence. I can form a sentence.
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  You go to a leftist event. They can't talk now.
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  It's scary. God bless you.
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  I'm trying to get everybody in here.
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Jeff in Tennessee. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  Hello Alex. How are you?
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  I'm a mixed bag. How are you?
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  Aggravated.
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  Yeah.
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  You know we sit here and we watch all of these.
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  This hearings and stuff going on.
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  You know why have they not, the guy before the last one that come on there,
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  he actually said the questions that I had.
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  What about Hillary Clinton?
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  Why has she not been brought forth on anything?
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:45.000]  She, the emails, the uranium.
[3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  Because she works for the globalists that had already thought this country was done for.
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:53.000]  That's why it's so great Trump's in there because literally they were slamming the door shut
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  and we put a door stop in. That's what Trump is.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  Like you stick your foot in the door. We stuck our foot in the door.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  That's what's happening and they're trying to slam the door on our foot right now.
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  We've got to just sit there and take the pain and keep our foot in it and ask the public,
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  hey, help us get the door open here.
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:11.000]  Yes sir. Now another problem.
[3:15:11.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  You know, Obama, I made the statement here to all my friends back before the election in 2016
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  that Obama never would leave office.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  He really has not left office.
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  You know, that's profound. I've said that before.
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  You're right. God bless you. I'm sorry to Jim and Danny.
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  Get their numbers and info. They want me to call them back first thing tomorrow.
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  I'll get them first back on. Mike Adams is loaded for bear as always.
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  He's taking over just a minute. Please don't forget.
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  You don't shop with us and you shop with the big globalists. You're crazy.

[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:55.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[3:15:55.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:01.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:05.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:08.000]  they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.

[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech,
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:18:01.000]  I actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many years ago,
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:03.000]  and I've found a few places where it's mentioned,
[3:18:03.000 --> 3:18:06.000]  but if you can find it, please send it to showtipstemfullwords.com.
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:09.000]  And he talked about in the darkest hours at the beginning of World War II
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:14.000]  the fact that there have been times in history where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:15.000]  and were assured of victory.
[3:18:15.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  Then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:21.000]  even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:24.000]  There's a third time when you know you're going to lose,
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:29.000]  but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much, much worse.
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:30.000]  That's a paraphrase.
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:35.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, we are in the position now of being able to win this easily
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:39.000]  if we find our spirit, find our focus, and don't give up and take action.
[3:18:39.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  But if we don't stand up and get involved, we're going to skip number two and go right to number three.
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:45.000]  That's a fact.
[3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:48.000]  They fear info wars because we are alive.
[3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:51.000]  It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:57.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars,
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:19:04.000]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:09.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new order's plans
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:13.000]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:18.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:21.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side
[3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:24.000]  and they do what they do because they're slaves
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:29.000]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:34.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves,
[3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:39.000]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[3:19:39.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:45.000]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  They fear the fact that we love God
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:20:17.000]  and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:26.000]  All right, Mike Adams is stepping in here for the remainder of the fourth hour today.
[3:20:26.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  Thank you for joining me.
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:32.000]  I was hearing some of the callers in the previous segment talking with Alex.
[3:20:32.000 --> 3:20:37.000]  I got to tell you, the info wars listeners and fans are the greatest people in America.
[3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:43.000]  It literally puts a smile on my face, makes me feel inspired for humanity.
[3:20:43.000 --> 3:20:48.000]  When I hear people called in and be so thoughtful and be so aware and have such courage,
[3:20:48.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  knowing what's coming and having the courage to face it because you can see where this is going.
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:59.000]  The Democrats cannot coexist with conservatives or Christians or gun owners or Trump supporters.
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:01.000]  They cannot coexist.
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  The Democrats have the philosophy of genocide and I'm going to talk about that today
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  and why it is up to us, we the people, the real Americans
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  to stand up against that genocidal mania of the radical left-wing Democrats
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:18.000]  and it's going to start, I now believe, in Virginia.
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  And I've just posted an article on this.
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:22.000]  I'll cover that article in a few minutes.
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  It's about Governor Northam now.
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:31.000]  My analysis is he's building a kill list of patriots to exterminate,
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  but he's calling it a gun registration list.
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:36.000]  It's actually a kill list.
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:38.000]  It's actually genocide.
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:42.000]  This is the governor that murders born alive human babies.
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:47.000]  And if they're willing to kill human babies, they're willing to kill you in the streets.
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:49.000]  Have no illusions about it.
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  I'll be talking about that in the next segment here on infowars.com.
[3:21:53.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  But first, a couple other breaking news items that are very important.
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:22:03.000]  Part of my goal is to give you the tools so that you can express yourself.
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:08.000]  You can bypass censorship, you can share important information, and you can find important information.
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:13.000]  And of course, as a contributor here to infowars, I've always done my part
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  to help infowars information get out there as well.
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  Brightdown.com, good news.
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:20.000]  It's exploding in popularity.
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  It's the alternative to YouTube.
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  It's like Band.video, except anybody can join.
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  And I have to apologize.
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:30.000]  The video transcoding time is now two hours of wait
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:35.000]  because so many people are using it, but Steve Quayle has just moved over 500 videos in process.
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:36.000]  Over to Brightdown.
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  Alan Keyes has launched his channel there.
[3:22:38.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  Children's Health Defense is there.
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:45.000]  Infowars and Alex Jones is the number one channel on Brightdown.com,
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:47.000]  even bigger than my own channel, Health Ranger Report.
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  But I got to tell you, Brightdown is exploding now because of the censorship of YouTube.
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:53.000]  And you can use it.
[3:22:53.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  It's free to use.
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  We got our costs under control.
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:22:58.000]  We're no longer losing money on that platform.
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:01.000]  We're not making any money, but it's breaking even and that's good enough.
[3:23:01.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  That's all we need.
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:04.000]  So you can use that.
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:05.000]  Do it.
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  Join up.
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:07.000]  Express yourself.
[3:23:07.000 --> 3:23:08.000]  Exercise free speech.
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  You're not going to be censored for being a patriot there.
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:11.000]  The second thing.
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:15.000]  Oh, and also, look, share the videos on Band.video.
[3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  I've got a channel there too.
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:19.000]  All the Infowars guests and hosts have channels there.
[3:23:19.000 --> 3:23:21.000]  All the shows are represented there.
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  Share those channels, bypass censorship.
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  And I believe the plan is for Band.video to, over time, open up to more and more people.
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:30.000]  I'm not the R&D staff there.
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:33.000]  So I don't know for sure what the schedule is, but I've heard that that's the plan.
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:34.000]  All right.
[3:23:34.000 --> 3:23:39.000]  Secondly, and I mean, why promote YouTube videos?
[3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:44.000]  Why are you using YouTube when you could be using Band.video or Brightdown.com or other alternatives?
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:45.000]  That's the key.
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:23:49.000]  Just stop using the globalist tools like YouTube and Google and so on.
[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:50.000]  You already know that.
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  I know you're the most informed audience in the world.
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:24:08.000]  Secondly, I'm releasing a new search engine that's going to compete with Google on the topic of health and vaccines, chemtrails, anything related to health and wellness, including geoengineering, including GMOs, including pharmaceuticals.
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  And today I'll announce the URL of that new search engine, which launches at the end of this year.
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:21.000]  Infowars will be indexed and Infowars Store will be indexed as well because Infowars Store offers all these natural health products.
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:29.000]  So when you are searching for solutions like iodine, you'll be able to find Infowars Store or other retailers that are offering natural products as well.
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:32.000]  That URL is webseed.com.
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:37.000]  Webseed, just like it sounds, W-E-B-S-E-E-D.com.
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  Infowars will be indexed.
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:48.000]  Coca-Cola is being indexed, of course, natural news. And I got to tell you, there will be hundreds of natural health websites there that are all being banned by Google.
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  And our plan is throughout 2020 to expand that search engine to other topics such as pro-second amendment, survival and prepping, politics, and many other topics that are currently being heavily censored by the powers that be.
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:12.000]  The reason I mention this here is, number one, this will help promote Infowars. This will help promote alternative, truthful information.
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:16.000]  Look, we are the real journalists in America. You know this. We are the ones telling the truth.
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:20.000]  I mean, if anything, just look at the hearings today of Horowitz in the Senate.
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  It came out that, yes, the FBI relied solely on the steel dossier, which is completely discredited, in order to justify the FISA warrants and the illegal spying on the Trump administration.
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  But dozens of mainstream news outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, all said that that wasn't true, that there was many pieces of evidence that justified the FBI spying.
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:52.000]  Well, guess what? Today we know that all those media outlets are fake news. Guess who told the truth? Alex Jones told the truth. David Knight told the truth.
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  Owen Shroyer told the truth. Infowars brought you the truth. We are the real media in America, or part of the real media.
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  The independent alternative media is the real media, including one American news that did an outstanding report the other day about corruption with Barisma and Ukraine and Ivanovich and so on.
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:16.000]  Just an outstanding video report. I'm sorry, I forgot the name of the reporter who did that report, but it was outstanding.
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:28.000]  The point is, what I'm going to be doing from here forward, folks, is not just coming in and giving you updates here on Infowars, but building tools and building platforms that all of us can use.
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  And we have the means to do it. We put millions of dollars into it, and it's working. We are sustainable, thanks to your support, and we have tools that can help set you free and bypass the tyrannical authoritarian censorship that's only getting worse by the day.
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:55.000]  Like YouTube recently said, well, they can cut off your channel if you're not, quote, commercially viable. Well, how do they make you not commercially viable? They demonetize your platform.
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:27:03.000]  And then they say, well, gosh, you're not making us any money. Your gun videos are not commercially viable. And why aren't they commercially viable? Because they cut you off from the revenues.
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:16.000]  I mean, it's a catch-22 trap. Of course, you're not commercially viable when they censor all the revenue. And then they cut you off. And they say, oh, see, we had to cut you off. You weren't earning us any money. Really? I'm not going to cut you off.
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  Now, we don't pay people for posting videos. We're lucky to be breakeven, but we're not going to cut you off. Your speech is more important than making a few pennies on some gun video.
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  Your speech is what's going to save this nation. And I really feel a sense of inspiration today that things are beginning to turn against the deep state. The deep state is being exposed.
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  As more people have read this IG Horowitz report, which initially looked like a total whitewash, and in some respects it was, they said the FBI wasn't biased. Really? All right, give me a break. Come on.
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  But as people are going through it over the last day or so, they're finding amazing revelations in that report, revelations that are damning to the deep state and to the FBI.
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:10.000]  I mean, Breitbart today, I got a story right here. Breitbart has a story, what, 10 disturbing findings in the Justice Department Inspector General report.
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  And almost every one of these 10 findings talks about how the FBI under James Comey and Barack Obama, the FBI was, and in some ways still is, a corrupt criminal cartel, a lawless organization that is destroying America from within.
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:33.000]  That's the FBI today, and I believe Christopher Wray is still part of that. And yes, Christopher Wray should be fired.
[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  But the truth is beginning to come out because of people like you, because of your support and your willingness to tell the truth and share the truth. I'm just going to help you do that with more and more tools.
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:29:05.000]  Much more analysis straight ahead. Stay with us. We'll be back after this break.
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:30:05.000]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it. That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:15.000]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family. We're being taken off the land.
[3:30:15.000 --> 3:30:25.000]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[3:30:25.000 --> 3:30:39.000]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[3:30:39.000 --> 3:30:52.000]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post-human error. This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet. This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[3:30:52.000 --> 3:31:04.000]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do. It's the healthy thing to do. It's the thing that makes all of our lives better, and that's taking care of our individual health.
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:15.000]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season than to go to infowarstore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life-changing.
[3:31:15.000 --> 3:31:23.000]  And what they will do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life, your focus, your health, your stamina, your libido.
[3:31:23.000 --> 3:31:32.000]  But then of course it also funds the infowar that is so incredibly critical. Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that's a true 360 win?
[3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[3:31:40.000 --> 3:31:48.000]  Spend your money on high-quality products and have huge savings, and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:48.000 --> 3:31:52.000]  That's infowarstore.com. Please make the right decision.
[3:31:52.000 --> 3:32:00.000]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come to InfoWars with free shipping store-wide and double-patriot points.
[3:32:00.000 --> 3:32:04.000]  Don't shop with Amazon or other big tech companies that hate your guts.
[3:32:04.000 --> 3:32:13.000]  Take the InfoWars Christmas Challenge and support the fight for freedom. Finish your Christmas shopping with one click and support the InfoWars.
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:25.000]  For the 12 days of Christmas, we're adding a new special every day, plus free shipping, double-patriot points, and extra stickers in every package to be good little elves and spread the InfoWars triggering libtards.

[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:22.000]  Alex Choncho with Mike Adams.
[3:33:22.000 --> 3:33:47.000]  A segment here for all Virginians who are proving to be incredibly courageous, incredibly patriotic individuals.
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:50.000]  This is a very important segment. I'm going to go into great detail about this.
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:59.000]  I'm going to ask you, share this video segment with anyone you know who lives in Virginia or near Virginia or who has a family member in Virginia.
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:05.000]  It's one of the founding states of our nation. It's been in existence for 243 years.
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  The state's slogan, loosely translated, means death to tyrants. Not exactly, but I think what is it?
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  Sixth Semper Tyrannus, I think, is the Latin of that slogan. But Virginia is now under attack from these globalists, these baby killers, baby butchering Governor Northam, who said that it's okay in his view to have a baby born alive, healthy, breathing alive, separate from the mother.
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  And then he said, well, we got to keep that baby comfortable until the mother decides to have it butchered and killed. I mean, I added the last part, but that's what he means, to keep it comfortable until the mother decides what to do with it.
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  And he means to kill it. Governor Northam, he's a demon. He's an anti-human demon. He's a scourge on humanity. I'm not going to hold back on this segment.
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  I'll just tell you what it is, okay? Governor Northam and the Democrats of Virginia are traitors. They are treasonous, anti-American, tyrannical, authoritarian scum of humanity.
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:17.000]  They are baby butchers, killers, mass murderers, and serial murder advocates. And they're coming for your guns.
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:38.000]  And what Governor Northam just announced yesterday is that he wants to build a gun registration list. And why would they want to register the home addresses of all the people who own guns in Virginia, even as 40-plus counties in Virginia have now declared themselves to be Second Amendment, Second Amendment Sanctuary Counties?
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:50.000]  And there are over 80 towns and cities and counties in total that have declared themselves to be Second Amendment Sanctuaries. Why? Why does this baby killer, Northam, want to know where you live?
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  Answer? He's not building a gun registration list. He's building a murder list. He's building a genocide list. He's building a list of who to go kill, because that's what Democrats always do.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:13.000]  This is what radical leftists always do throughout human history. And in a story I've just posted, it's up on infowars.com right now. You look at human history just in the 20th century alone.
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:22.000]  These gun control regimes, these radical leftists, fascists, and communists, they murdered over a quarter of a billion human beings.
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:33.000]  262 million living, breathing human beings have been exterminated by the same kind of people who share the mindset of Governor Northam.
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  He is, in fact, operating with the mindset of Pol Pot and Stalin and Chairman Mao and all the mass murderers of human history who exterminated hundreds of millions of human beings.
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  And Governor Northam says, it's okay to kill your baby. And if he thinks that that's okay, do you think he has any hesitation against killing you? No.
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  But first, he needs to do two things. He needs to, number one, know where you live, and number two, he needs to disarm you.
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:23.000]  So they start with a gun registration list, and they say, well, you can keep your AR-15 for a while until they come for it. You can keep your AR-15 that you purchase legally and lawfully as long as you register with Richmond.
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  As long as you let the government run by tyrannical Democrats know where you live and how many guns you have.
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  And by the way, if there was ever an argument to go out and buy a ghost gunner and start using the router on the AR-15 lowers and building your own rifles, this is the argument right here.
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  You need to have rifles that you build yourself, and it's legal to do so, I believe, currently in Virginia, it's legal to do so.
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:56.000]  You need to make your own rifles, because they are coming for your guns, and when they take those guns, they're going to use them against you.
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:38:03.000]  This is what history has shown again and again. First, they take your guns, and what, look, what's the reason for taking your guns?
[3:38:03.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  Again, I'll just say it uncensored here. It's because Governor Northam and the Democrats of Virginia, who are treasonous, evil, anti-American traders, they plan to do something that the citizens might shoot them for attempting to do.
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  They plan to commit atrocities against you. This is their plan. Remember, Democrats today, they have already announced that they want to mass murder people who wear MAGA hats, or President Trump himself.
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  They've said through their censorship that you don't have the right to speak on Google or Twitter or Facebook, and they've said you don't have the right to have a job because they've kicked you out of your careers if you support Trump.
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  They've said you don't have the right to exist, and now Governor Northam comes along and says you don't have the right to defend yourself against the Democrats who want to have you destroyed and exterminated.
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  To the people of Virginia, look, I'm a Texan. I'm a Texan, and I have much the same mindset as you can tell, but to the people of Virginia, I offer a warning to you today, maybe an awakening.
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  If you don't stop this tyranny, they will come to kill you. They will first disarm you, will first register you, and then disarm you, and then they will murder you.
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  And I know many of you already know this, and if you let them do that, you will be dead in a ditch, dug by Democrat-run bulldozers, because this is the genocidal mania and the lunacy and the violence that Democrats, it just saturates their very being.
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  This is who they are. If they weren't advocates of violence, how could they kill their own living, breathing babies?
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  They are seething with violence and seething with hatred for you, the citizens of Virginia.
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  The good men and women of this nation, of the state of Virginia, whose ancestors helped create the original founding of the United States of America, the original revolutionary war of independence for this nation.
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  All of that is being put at stake by these radical, lawless Democrats. And guess what? There are now state Democrats in Virginia lawmakers who are saying that if you declare your county to be a sanctuary, Second Amendment sanctuary, that you are a domestic terrorist.
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  You see how that logic works? Oh, and they say you're racist somehow, even though race has nothing to do with this, because every black man and woman in Virginia should also be armed in his or her own defense as well.
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:49.000]  This isn't about white people or Latino people. Every honest citizen of Virginia should be armed, and every honest citizen of Virginia should be outraged against what this treasonous governor Northam is attempting to carry out.
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  And every citizen of Virginia should be aware of what's going to happen if you try to appease these tyrants and say, OK, we'll just register our guns.
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  We'll just let them know the serial numbers of our AR-15s and how many we have and where we live. Yeah. And then they'll go away.
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  You think so? Don't be a fool. They are never going to go away. They're going to come to take your guns a year later after another mass shooting that they carry out.
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  They will plan the mass shootings. They will run the mass shootings, and then they will blame you, you who complied, you who are a law abiding citizen, you who did nothing wrong.
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  You never shot anybody, and you have no intention of doing so. You are a law abiding citizen of Virginia, and yet you are being punished by the tyrants whose real motivation inside their dark, twisted hearts and putrid minds,
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:51.000]  their motivation is to take your life from you and throw you in a ditch to get rid of their political opponents just like these same radical leftists have done throughout human history.
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  That's the truth. And that's why I beg you, share this video segment. It's on banned.video. It'll be posted on brighttion.com.
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  You won't find it on YouTube, obviously, because they don't want you to know the truth, and they don't want you to realize that sooner or later the people of Virginia are going to have to stop the tyrants.
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  They're going to have to band together and defend and restore the civil rights of all Virginians. In fact, the Second Amendment was written for precisely this context.
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:37.000]  This is what your duty is to defend the rights and the lives and the safety of the citizens of Virginia against the tyrants who are also letting violent criminal illegal aliens flood your state because of open borders policies.
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  You have the right to defend yourself, and you have the obligation to stop tyrants who are trying to overthrow your liberty and your sovereignty.
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:43:11.000]  Much more straight ahead. We'll be back after this break.
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:20.000]  Check in every day to find the new deals.
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:44:04.000]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it. That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[3:44:04.000 --> 3:44:23.000]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family. We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore
[3:44:23.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God, believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:53.000]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post-human error. This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet. This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[3:44:53.000 --> 3:45:19.000]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:25.000]  Well, I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche. This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:32.000]  It was a day I'd no longer take Adderall and I get by literally the 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:39.000]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, 499.
[3:45:39.000 --> 3:45:45.000]  And, you know, I just had to call in and tell you guys how great turbo force is. And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:53.000]  I'm really proud of turbo force. So thank you, sir. Commit to buy a lot of your products at m4store.com, then help us spread the word and let's just get busy m4store.com.
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  It's time to take yourself to the next level. It doesn't matter if you're a man, doesn't matter if you're a woman, doesn't matter if you're old or young.
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:05.000]  As you age, preglonone levels in the body go down.
[3:46:05.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  In 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglonone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis.
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:24.000]  And then it just gets wilder from there. Medical science knows all about this, but they suppress information about preglonone.
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:31.000]  We've got the best form of preglonone with a bunch of high quality vitamins and minerals in real red pill.
[3:46:31.000 --> 3:46:39.000]  Real Plus has some added energy as well. Now you can get it for 65% off with a free bottle of Biotru Selenium that's from the mustard seed.
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:50.000]  The two go together in an incredible way. The real red pill and real red pill plus 65% off with a free bottle of Biotru Selenium at m4store.com through the new year.
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:47:03.000]  Change your life, take yourself to the next level.
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:27.000]  They won't say they're murdering you. They will say they're aborting you because that's what they do when they murder children.
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:32.000]  It's just abortions, post birth abortion, and you notice they don't have any age limits on that, by the way.
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:38.000]  They don't say, oh, you can only abort a baby that's four hours old or four weeks old. They have no age limit.
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:44.000]  So look, when they take your guns and they come for you and actually use your guns to put a bullet in your head,
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:50.000]  they will say that they are just aborting people who are domestic terrorists. That's what they'll say.
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:57.000]  I mean, look, these people are so sick and so twisted, these Democrats, they can justify anything by twisting language around.
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:48:04.000]  I mean, look, they justify the chemical mutilation of children by calling it progressivism and tolerance and transgenderism.
[3:48:04.000 --> 3:48:14.000]  Really? No, you're just poisoning that child. You're just cutting apart their reproductive organs in some weird twisted surgical procedure.
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:18.000]  I mean, you're collecting baby parts in your abortion centers. You are sick, twisted people.
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:23.000]  The silence of the lambs has become a political party. It's called Democrats. I mean, it's sick.
[3:48:23.000 --> 3:48:27.000]  These people are sick, twisted, mentally ill demons and criminals.
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:31.000]  All right, I'm going to blow through some news here, some other news that you need to hear.
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:35.000]  Some very important things that hit my radar today.
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  Crypto, the FBI has made an arrest and the DOJ has charged currently three individuals for what they call a cryptocurrency scheme,
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:52.000]  which was a Bitcoin mining pool that they say built investors out of $722 million.
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:57.000]  And of course, these three people were arrested. They're facing about 25 years in prison now.
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:49:02.000]  But, okay, whatever, I want to point out something really interesting here.
[3:49:02.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  The FBI itself is a criminal cartel.
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:10.000]  And secondly, the far bigger scam is the Federal Reserve.
[3:49:10.000 --> 3:49:19.000]  The US dollar has lost 98% of its value since 1913. You know, a creature from Jekyll Island when the Fed was created.
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:22.000]  Is that not theft? Is that not a massive Ponzi scheme?
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:29.000]  And by the way, you are required to participate in that dollar denominated Ponzi scheme.
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:35.000]  The government takes money out of your pockets, essentially at gunpoint through confiscatory taxes.
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:41.000]  Now, this crypto scheme that the FBI says they busted, I don't remember anybody from that company coming to my house
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:45.000]  and putting a gun in my head and saying, you have to invest in our crypto scheme.
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:49.000]  No, people did it by consent.
[3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  And if you lost money with that, you lost money. You're probably new. You're playing a high-risk game.
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:50:00.000]  You lost money. But the Fed, the Federal Reserve, the fiat currency system, the fake money supply,
[3:50:00.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  they put a gun to your head and make you participate in their scam.
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  So in my opinion, that's far more evil than anything in cryptocurrency.
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:14.000]  I'm not defending whatever this crypto company did, this mining pool.
[3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:18.000]  Maybe they did lie to investors. Probably they did if the DOJ is to be believed.
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  I don't know. I'm just saying the Fed lies to us every day.
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  And the Fed steals money from your pocket every hour while you're sleeping because they're debasing the money supply.
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:31.000]  And yet, the FBI isn't investigating the Fed, right?
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:36.000]  No one goes to jail for counter-fitting currency when you do it at a national level.
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:40.000]  Hyperinflation, you know, look at Venezuela. Hey, the crooks are in charge.
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:42.000]  Same thing's true in Washington, D.C.
[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:47.000]  Oh, by the way, this reminds me, some other, this is real important.
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:56.000]  Why the Senate may let, they may eradicate this impeachment charge right away after the House votes for impeachment.
[3:50:56.000 --> 3:51:00.000]  The Senate doesn't want to trial. And you know why?
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  Because the Rhino Republicans are on the take and being bribed and getting kickbacks just like the Democrat senators.
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  And the way this works is that every piece of foreign aid that pumps billions of dollars into some foreign country like Ukraine,
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:20.000]  the people in power in America, whether it's presidents or vice presidents under Obama,
[3:51:20.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  Trump isn't doing this, but the others did, or senators, they all skim off that.
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:28.000]  They get kickbacks. Yes, they get kickbacks.
[3:51:28.000 --> 3:51:36.000]  And it's Republican senators and it's Democrat senators and it's people who had departments and committees and it's vice presidents and so on.
[3:51:36.000 --> 3:51:38.000]  State department people, they're all on the take.
[3:51:38.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  Why do you think we have so much, quote, foreign aid going out the door?
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:50.000]  Because it's coming back in the form of kickbacks to the very lawmakers that are sitting in the Senate chambers right now,
[3:51:50.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  pretending to be upstanding honest citizens.
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  Most of those people are crooks.
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:51:59.000]  Now, not Senator Rand Paul. He is not a crook. He's a good guy.
[3:51:59.000 --> 3:52:03.000]  And there are good men and women scattered throughout Washington, D.C.
[3:52:03.000 --> 3:52:04.000]  But there's not a lot of them.
[3:52:04.000 --> 3:52:06.000]  Most of them are crooks. Most of them are on the take.
[3:52:06.000 --> 3:52:09.000]  And that's why they don't want investigations into this.
[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:15.000]  Because if we call Joe Biden as a witness and we call people related to barisma as witnesses,
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:19.000]  why do you think their visas were denied so they couldn't come to the U.S. and testify?
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:30.000]  The deep state is trying to protect this massive racket where your taxpayer dollars go into their pockets after being skimmed off of international aid.
[3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:32.000]  That's what this has always been about.
[3:52:32.000 --> 3:52:39.000]  And Trump doesn't need the money and Trump is sickened by this corruption and Trump is trying to put an end to it.
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:41.000]  And that's why they're trying to destroy Trump.
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:47.000]  And by the way, I should remind you, this is why I think he may very well be impeached in the Senate.
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:52.000]  Don't think that the Senate is going to vote against impeachment.
[3:52:52.000 --> 3:52:56.000]  I'm not convinced of that at all for this very reason that I just mentioned.
[3:52:56.000 --> 3:53:05.000]  Because there are Republican senators who are on the take and they will betray Trump and they will vote to convict and they will kick him out of office.
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:11.000]  So I ask you this question because I think that will be the spark that sets off civil war across America.
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:13.000]  It's just my guess as an analyst.
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  I think that's the last straw for millions of people.
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:19.000]  What do you think will happen?
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:27.000]  And what are you thinking that you need to do if Trump is removed by a corrupt Senate?
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  Because that means we've lost the whole system.
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:31.000]  Everything is corrupt.
[3:53:31.000 --> 3:53:38.000]  The deep state is endlessly infinitely corrupt and they cannot be stopped because the Senate has been corrupted and the House has been corrupted.
[3:53:38.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  And even elements of the Supreme Court have been corrupted like Justice Roberts, for example.
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:45.000]  How do you even take that back?
[3:53:45.000 --> 3:53:50.000]  They plotted for Trump and all they did was plot to remove him from day one.
[3:53:50.000 --> 3:53:53.000]  Even before he was inaugurated, they plotted to remove him.
[3:53:53.000 --> 3:53:57.000]  So what they're telling you is that your vote doesn't matter anymore.
[3:53:57.000 --> 3:54:07.000]  They're telling you that they, the deep state traders and the Democrats, that they have a band on the rule of law, that they will no longer abide by any pillar of civil society.
[3:54:07.000 --> 3:54:09.000]  They will not recognize facts.
[3:54:09.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  They will not recognize due process.
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:15.000]  They will not give Trump a fair hearing in court.
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:17.000]  You cannot cross-examine their witnesses.
[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:19.000]  You can't even call your own witnesses.
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:25.000]  And then the Democrats, they have their witnesses come in who magically become counsel who are interrogating other witnesses.
[3:54:25.000 --> 3:54:26.000]  What?
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  What?
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:29.000]  What kind of a court circus is this?
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:30.000]  It's a joke.
[3:54:30.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  It's a farce.
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:32.000]  It's all theater.
[3:54:32.000 --> 3:54:34.000]  But that's what the Democrats are doing.
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  And the Republicans, establishment people are in with them.
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:39.000]  John McCain.
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  He was part of this Trump dossier.
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:46.000]  He was part of the farading of this information over to the FBI to justify the FISA warrant.
[3:54:46.000 --> 3:54:50.000]  John McCain was a trader to America.
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:51.000]  Yeah, quote me on that.
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:52.000]  Quote me on it.
[3:54:52.000 --> 3:54:53.000]  You can quote me.
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:54.000]  Get my name right.
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:54:57.000]  John McCain is a trader to America.
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:55:01.000]  And there are others, not just him, many more.
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:04.000]  And they may very well vote to impeach President Trump.
[3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:06.000]  So be on the lookout for that.
[3:55:06.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  Now, I got to get to some other news.
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  OK, quickly.
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:11.000]  Home Depot is now warning.
[3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:12.000]  This is on zero hedge.
[3:55:12.000 --> 3:55:17.000]  Home Depot is warning that the opioid crisis is creating addicts who are carrying all these
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  mass shoplifting across Home Depot stores all across America.
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:25.000]  Like all these meth heads and opioid addicts are just stealing from all these retailers
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:26.000]  all the time.
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:32.000]  New York Supreme Court rules that the Amish cannot say no to vaccines in their own schools
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:36.000]  that all of their children have to be vaccinated now, even if it's against the religion and
[3:55:36.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  even if vaccines contain a boarded human fetal tissue.
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:43.000]  Portland, Oregon, check this out.
[3:55:43.000 --> 3:55:50.000]  A new proposed ordinance would require all new buildings to house or to provide, quote,
[3:55:50.000 --> 3:55:52.000]  rest and welcome for homeless people.
[3:55:52.000 --> 3:55:56.000]  So if you build a new building in Portland, you have to build, I don't know, some kind
[3:55:56.000 --> 3:55:59.000]  of extra floor for homeless people to sleep.
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:00.000]  What?
[3:56:00.000 --> 3:56:01.000]  What is this?
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:04.000]  And I'm sure they're all going to be microchipped as well because that's going to be part of
[3:56:04.000 --> 3:56:05.000]  the city.
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:06.000]  Okay.
[3:56:06.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  Ralph Northam, AR 15s, top 10.
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:12.000]  Okay.
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:13.000]  No.
[3:56:13.000 --> 3:56:15.000]  Those are stories that I needed to cover.

[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:42.000]  And I told him, look, I said, the reason that you are so awake and aware and alive is because
[3:56:42.000 --> 3:56:43.000]  of nutrition.
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:44.000]  And he said, yeah, I feel it.
[3:56:44.000 --> 3:56:46.000]  I've been taking these, the multi-day packs.
[3:56:46.000 --> 3:56:47.000]  I forgot what they're called.
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:49.000]  He's been taking those for like three months.
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:56:54.000]  And his brain is just functioning at a level with like cognitive horsepower that he has
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:56:57.000]  never experienced in his life.
[3:56:57.000 --> 3:56:58.000]  And I feel the same thing.
[3:56:58.000 --> 3:56:59.000]  You know, I'm taking turmeric.
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:00.000]  I'm taking iodine.
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  I'm doing nutrition every day.
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:03.000]  It's part of my lifestyle.
