[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:34.560]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:34.560 --> 00:39.880]  welcome my friends welcome we had an exclusive interview last night of the
[00:39.880 --> 00:43.280]  nightly news with kurt haskell the attorney the survivor of the underwear
[00:43.280 --> 00:47.800]  bomber and as one of the victims one of the survivors of that attack he was
[00:47.800 --> 00:51.720]  able to read into the record the evidence of what he witnessed in the u.s.
[00:51.720 --> 00:58.160]  government getting him on the aircraft and protecting the insane jihadists they
[00:58.160 --> 01:01.960]  go out and find crazies and put them on the aircraft and was able to point out
[01:01.960 --> 01:09.240]  that you are not a muslim hero you are a tool of the globalist you are a patsy
[01:09.240 --> 01:14.120]  and that did actually make some of the corporate dinosaur media that's been
[01:14.120 --> 01:20.000]  involved in a blackout you know kurt haskell had heard this show and it heard
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.920]  about 9-11 truth and didn't buy into it and when he watched the government get
[01:26.920 --> 01:30.480]  him on the plane which a month and a half after he told us on the show he saw
[01:30.480 --> 01:34.720]  this it was confirmed by the state department and congressional hearings
[01:34.720 --> 01:40.560]  and c-span aired it live and then he saw the cover-up and everything they did in
[01:40.560 --> 01:44.600]  that trial whether they were saying to matala will kill your family if you
[01:44.600 --> 01:50.720]  don't plead guilty or whether he was just a crazy jihadi they set up haskell
[01:50.720 --> 01:56.440]  witnessed this and now says that he's woken up and you know may basically get
[01:56.440 --> 02:00.920]  out of the country and he was telling us you know why even sue the government
[02:00.920 --> 02:05.080]  because he thinks the whole country's gonna collapse and he was looking at some
[02:05.080 --> 02:08.600]  of the you know different reports that are coming out from the big banks that
[02:08.600 --> 02:12.320]  if things aren't reversed the next year and a half it's a guaranteed total
[02:12.320 --> 02:17.000]  collapse I mean just absolute not just a depression but just a shutdown of many
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.480]  services in society the whole thing runs from bad to worse that's why the
[02:20.480 --> 02:24.520]  globalists want to have a depression but a controlled one and they've said this
[02:24.520 --> 02:28.360]  at Davos many years bill terbergs talked about it CFR trilateral commission
[02:28.360 --> 02:32.320]  publicly have said a controlled post-industrial world a controlled
[02:32.320 --> 02:37.680]  collapse but and if they need to have a big world war three to do that they'll
[02:37.680 --> 02:44.720]  do it and here we are just just with proxy wars and Libya proxy wars bringing
[02:44.720 --> 02:50.440]  down Syria proxy revolutions in Egypt proxy revolutions being exported into
[02:50.440 --> 02:56.640]  Iran bombings bases being blown up people being assassinated magnet bombs
[02:56.640 --> 03:02.400]  thrown onto cars by motorcycles there you the Israel's using al-qaeda to do
[03:02.400 --> 03:09.080]  the killing even NBC news reports that and we've reached this twilight zone point
[03:09.080 --> 03:16.880]  where everything I've been talking about is hidden in plain view admitted but
[03:16.880 --> 03:20.720]  then even when the general public many of them see the information it's like
[03:20.720 --> 03:24.960]  yeah but I still got to get my rights up al-qaeda is gonna get me and then I've
[03:24.960 --> 03:31.480]  got stacks of news again today where Google Twitter Facebook all of them
[03:31.480 --> 03:34.840]  are announcing censorship working with any governments they want to track
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.240]  exactly where you are from every Twitter to block Twitters with keywords
[03:39.240 --> 03:43.520]  before they go out to not let people politically organize with it Google
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.280]  tracking people Google delisting people when government asked including the US
[03:48.280 --> 03:54.520]  government just just a bum rush you know and I guess mine was right a few weeks
[03:54.520 --> 03:59.520]  ago and we quote beat sopa for now that the recording industry wanted to ham

[04:29.400 --> 04:34.520]  copy of it does I'm seeing that now I mean we're being delisted everywhere
[04:34.520 --> 04:40.480]  they've delisted us off the news of Google and they admit they're censoring
[04:40.480 --> 04:45.440]  people are like no they're not censoring so it's all coming down I mean it is
[04:45.440 --> 04:49.160]  getting it is getting crazy I'm gonna tell you about the guests that are

[06:00.720 --> 06:05.240]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[06:05.240 --> 06:09.000]  pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[06:09.000 --> 06:13.080]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[06:13.080 --> 06:16.520]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[06:16.520 --> 06:21.240]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[07:03.240 --> 07:07.560]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[07:07.560 --> 07:11.720]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[07:11.720 --> 07:15.760]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[07:15.760 --> 07:19.640]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[07:19.640 --> 07:23.760]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[07:23.760 --> 07:28.080]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[07:28.080 --> 07:32.400]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[07:32.400 --> 07:36.120]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[07:36.120 --> 07:40.320]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[07:40.320 --> 07:43.680]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[08:02.000 --> 08:07.760]  radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for
[08:07.760 --> 08:10.280]  your mind
[08:10.280 --> 08:25.800]  welcome ladies and gentlemen it is Friday it is already the 17th day of
[08:25.800 --> 08:33.280]  February 2012 we've got Greg Palace BBC investigative journalist with huge
[08:33.280 --> 08:38.720]  breaking news on a host of military fronts economic fronts web censorship
[08:38.720 --> 08:42.960]  fronts in the inside scoop on news core obviously being blackmailed and
[08:42.960 --> 08:47.360]  controlled by the Obama's deception operation suddenly you're seeing a lot
[08:47.360 --> 08:51.680]  of Obama worship over at news core and Sky TVs now suddenly worshipping the
[08:51.680 --> 08:55.480]  Labor Party over in England because they've got the prosecutors ready to
[08:55.480 --> 08:59.040]  drop the hammer on all of them they just arrested eight more news core people
[08:59.040 --> 09:05.400]  last week so this could be the end of news core as we know it unless they
[09:05.400 --> 09:10.200]  basically become current TV and hire Al Gore on their board and I'm not joking
[09:10.200 --> 09:15.080]  you may see stuff like that so this may be the only way the globalist liberal
[09:15.080 --> 09:20.120]  arm of the New World Order can actually get viewers is to actually have a
[09:20.120 --> 09:25.160]  hostile intelligence operation takeover of news core through blackmail of course
[09:25.160 --> 09:29.760]  news core has got plenty of dirt on the left arm of the New World Order that
[09:29.760 --> 09:33.360]  they're part of but there is in fighting inside the system the founding
[09:33.360 --> 09:38.240]  fathers said over and over again the one thing that will stop tyranny there's
[09:38.240 --> 09:42.560]  two things a vigilant active population with a Republican form of government a
[09:42.560 --> 09:46.760]  Republic that mean Republican Party of your new listener every time I say
[09:46.760 --> 09:50.520]  Republican form of government they go on we how dare you say a Republican
[09:50.520 --> 09:54.720]  government only that's not what we're talking about side issue the point is
[09:54.720 --> 10:02.040]  that that you need an active awake informed involved population that
[10:02.040 --> 10:10.920]  defends liberty aggressively but she's also in this fight on top of that need
[10:10.920 --> 10:18.760]  to understand there's a separation of powers so that the power structure is
[10:18.760 --> 10:22.320]  always busy fighting with itself over the power so you can't get one
[10:22.320 --> 10:29.400]  centralized dictator type guy in total full control all right
[10:29.400 --> 10:34.520]  continuing here let me just go over some of the headlines and then it's
[10:34.520 --> 10:38.040]  Friday I'm just gonna open the phones up instead of just ranting off into
[10:38.040 --> 10:45.440]  oblivion over all of this news let me just start let me just start here
[10:47.800 --> 10:57.200]  conservatives and enthusiasts cheer the end of the long gun registry in
[10:57.200 --> 11:02.440]  Canada national post now Canadians a decade ago said when they passed this
[11:02.440 --> 11:06.080]  they're going to use it for gun confiscation and indeed they would just
[11:06.080 --> 11:12.600]  come confiscate legal collections of firearms trumping up reasons it's been
[11:12.600 --> 11:17.400]  all over their news and so now the long gun registry is gone not the handgun
[11:17.400 --> 11:22.520]  registry but the long gun registry has been overturned and again we're having
[11:22.520 --> 11:26.200]  overall victories against the social engineers they're still taking over
[11:26.200 --> 11:31.160]  infrastructure and have the high ground politically and with their printing
[11:31.160 --> 11:36.480]  presses of fiat money but they morally have the low ground and that's why I've
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.920]  seen the polls roughly go from 50% or so for restricting the Second Amendment in
[11:41.920 --> 11:47.320]  the 70s and 80s to now some polls as high as 80% want less gun laws they
[11:47.320 --> 11:50.720]  understand it's about victim disarmament the government can't won't protect you
[11:50.720 --> 11:58.280]  I've seen numbers you can pull these up where back in the 70s right around 60%
[11:58.280 --> 12:02.720]  of people or so depending on which study were for abortion they've been sold it's
[12:02.720 --> 12:06.840]  not a human and you know it's no big deal and it's trendy and cool and a civil
[12:06.840 --> 12:12.400]  right and the lies that well if it's to save the woman's life shouldn't you have
[12:12.400 --> 12:15.840]  an abortion it's not called an abortion it's all the medical procedure if it's
[12:15.840 --> 12:20.320]  to save the woman's life okay more lies more deception nobody's not going to go
[12:20.320 --> 12:24.080]  into a procedure unfortunately the baby dies over the mother okay that's
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.680]  always been the way it is and in just modern medicine but now it's upwards of
[12:29.680 --> 12:35.760]  75 80% or against abortion you just type that in you know tied turns you
[12:35.760 --> 12:40.440]  America now anti-abortion especially in young people the numbers are in the
[12:40.440 --> 12:46.560]  90s in some cases so there's been a total flipping people are anti-gun
[12:46.560 --> 12:50.640]  grabbing now anti-gun control there for controlling the gun in their hand real
[12:50.640 --> 12:56.560]  gun control their anti-abortion their anti-un their anti-globalist see the
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.160]  globalist were able to take over America through trader media by owning the
[13:00.160 --> 13:04.920]  media they rolled a slowly brainwashed people twist things sell things but the
[13:04.920 --> 13:11.560]  fads over honeymoons over honeymoons over I mean in Canada despite the
[13:11.560 --> 13:14.560]  globalist and control that parliament the Queen's suspending their parliament
[13:14.560 --> 13:18.800]  three times the last four years and all of it over things like this they have
[13:18.800 --> 13:24.560]  now overturned the major gun registry boom victory this this is a big deal
[13:24.560 --> 13:28.400]  you know you remember three years ago when the Copenhagen document got leaked
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.040]  and it was for world government they were trying to get it passed without the
[13:32.040 --> 13:36.360]  third world seeing it in one day all this came out in the internal emails of
[13:36.360 --> 13:40.760]  the UN fixing the numbers globally and we've got to hide this fraud and it's
[13:40.760 --> 13:46.120]  all about reducing population and all the eugenics boards I had the guys go by
[13:46.120 --> 13:51.280]  champagne and we literally drank an $80 bottle of champagne in here which is a
[13:51.280 --> 13:56.120]  lot for you know around here folks and I mean and I said you know what after the
[13:56.120 --> 13:59.320]  show I actually and I'm saying you should celebrate with alcohol but it was
[13:59.320 --> 14:04.520]  like I just won the Indy 500 all of us did I drove to the store got a bottle
[14:04.520 --> 14:11.680]  of champagne I went home with my wife and we had that bottle of wine it's so
[14:11.680 --> 14:20.000]  good we can do it we can start feeling so good when I think about it we can
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.480]  beat these people ladies and gentlemen I know we can and people haven't learned
[14:23.480 --> 14:27.680]  that yet but they're starting to and in the understanding that we can win and
[14:27.680 --> 14:35.800]  we've got strength is the victory in the understanding of how strong we are we
[14:35.800 --> 14:39.320]  can win I mean I know a lot of you are like why is this guy just got tears in
[14:39.320 --> 14:46.280]  his eyes you know involuntarily over going back to that moment it's because
[14:46.280 --> 14:49.840]  you get excited when the when your team wins the Super Bowl of the playoffs I've
[14:49.840 --> 14:54.040]  seen grown men get just like I did and coaches cry I mean back when I was a
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.480]  teenager I'd cry when the Cowboys won you get a tear in my eye of happiness
[14:58.480 --> 15:04.080]  while we were high-fiving you know with a barbecue that's a simulation of what
[15:04.080 --> 15:09.640]  real humanity is I get an endorphin rush just going back to watching that
[15:09.640 --> 15:15.440]  enemy Death Star blow up and I told you that was going to reverse their entire
[15:15.440 --> 15:19.560]  environmental eugenics movement and it's been a major wedge into their
[15:19.560 --> 15:25.920]  operation it has been devastating and they admit it Al Gore is now a joke his
[15:25.920 --> 15:31.160]  own people running from him I mean it's a devastating win
[15:32.520 --> 15:39.120]  savor that a devastating victory now this isn't as big as that but it's
[15:39.120 --> 15:44.040]  another signpost even though Canada is so rigged just like our system still
[15:44.040 --> 15:47.560]  there's freedom it was a victory when when the head Rothschild got caught being
[15:47.560 --> 15:52.280]  a puppet master over Russian oligarchs and major British government
[15:52.280 --> 15:56.240]  officials he sued trying to say it wasn't true and the suit reversed and
[15:56.240 --> 15:59.640]  all came out and it was still even in one of some of the most rigged courts in
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.520]  the world when it comes to libel strongest libel laws in the world the
[16:03.520 --> 16:08.320]  judge said you were deceptive and got caught I read part of the ruling here
[16:08.320 --> 16:14.640]  on air you lied to us you filed a bad suit you are a puppet master boom
[16:14.640 --> 16:19.200]  devastating the globalists don't want us to have confidence and I'm telling you
[16:19.200 --> 16:23.840]  it's a lie that we can't turn this around as bad as this new rule order is as
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.920]  out of control as many people are asleep and and brain damage by the globalist
[16:28.920 --> 16:33.120]  propaganda and poisoning them in the food and water and the rest of it when
[16:33.120 --> 16:37.640]  you finally get wise to the scam no matter how big and sophisticated it just
[16:37.640 --> 16:43.800]  doesn't float anymore and their boats got more holes in it every day and that's
[16:43.800 --> 16:48.520]  why I get still get so angry at the mainstream media that are a bunch of
[16:48.520 --> 16:54.000]  a teleprompter reading decepticons sitting there lying to people and
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.040]  imposing and and their big giant slick studios we could do the exact same thing
[16:59.040 --> 17:02.960]  I guess maybe we should just to make a point and the fact that still with some
[17:02.960 --> 17:06.880]  people if you're wearing a fancy suit and tie and reading off a teleprompter and
[17:06.880 --> 17:11.080]  looking like you have the perfect diction and eloquence but you're reading a
[17:11.080 --> 17:18.880]  script that that even after the dinosaur media has imploded to about 10% of
[17:18.880 --> 17:29.640]  what it was 20 years ago they still have that error that air of being the
[17:29.640 --> 17:34.080]  establishment and when that domino falls it's over and they're already trying to
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.800]  segue they're already dispatching establishment people into cyberspace into
[17:38.800 --> 17:43.840]  internet news as that becomes the total platform to try to to try to replace the
[17:43.840 --> 17:49.640]  true alternative media as they begin to censor and shut all of us down and just
[17:49.640 --> 17:56.440]  a side issue and I apologize because it's not even worthy of discussion but
[17:56.440 --> 18:00.600]  the young Turks which means kind of a secret society a luminous group that
[18:00.600 --> 18:04.320]  actually took over Turkey kind of an anti-Islamist group that's I guess why
[18:04.320 --> 18:07.680]  they use that name I mean it's good kind of a Ford Foundation Media Matters
[18:07.680 --> 18:15.320]  Al Gore funded deal I mean it's like kind of a joke and everybody's face the
[18:15.320 --> 18:18.440]  minutes where that name comes from I just saw some video where they were
[18:18.440 --> 18:21.560]  saying they're the number one news show on the internet in the world and I said
[18:21.560 --> 18:25.600]  if you look at Alexa and if you look at you know all of our internet traffic and
[18:25.600 --> 18:29.640]  streams and podcasts and all of our YouTube channels we dwarf them and a
[18:29.640 --> 18:34.000]  bunch of other people dwarf them and I mean Glenn Beck's bigger than they are
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.840]  on the internet world net daily and the list goes on and on I said it's not true
[18:39.840 --> 18:45.720]  because I'm sick of Al Gore dispatching some people that show Hollywood clips all
[18:45.720 --> 18:49.800]  day and then call that news and then say they're bigger than people when with
[18:49.800 --> 18:56.880]  hardcore info we're beating the establishment media and the establishment
[18:56.880 --> 19:01.960]  spin-off counterfeit alternative media with real hardcore news that says the
[19:01.960 --> 19:05.960]  people are hungry for truth that says the awakening is winning that's an
[19:05.960 --> 19:11.360]  attack on all of us to say this show is at number one number one in full
[19:11.360 --> 19:16.600]  spectrum alternative media drudge is in disputed number one in old line media
[19:16.600 --> 19:23.440]  alternative media and agenda setting there's just nothing compared to it and
[19:23.440 --> 19:26.840]  the system attacks him every day saying it's wrong he shouldn't be able to set
[19:26.840 --> 19:31.000]  the agenda because he does more than New York Times Twitter Facebook all of them
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.320]  combined the actuaries have been done and I'm just I'm just stating facts here
[19:35.320 --> 19:42.400]  okay we're number one that means you're number one that means we're winning we're
[19:42.400 --> 19:46.280]  winning and more and more realize the fact that we're winning needs to be
[19:46.280 --> 19:49.720]  trumpeted so we're gonna start publishing more of these numbers going over it

[20:05.040 --> 20:09.040]  using them had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the regimen every
[20:09.040 --> 20:14.320]  day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw
[20:14.320 --> 20:18.240]  those results I said I better follow my own advice I started taking the
[20:18.240 --> 20:23.640]  ungevity products and it's been incredible 37 pounds in two months our
[20:23.640 --> 20:28.320]  bodies are amazing and God gave us an incredible gift but if our body doesn't

[23:58.600 --> 24:06.560]  did
[24:06.560 --> 24:12.480]  I read the news today
[24:16.200 --> 24:23.040]  as I've explained going back thousands of years tribal chiefs would dress up in
[24:23.040 --> 24:30.000]  big fancy crowns and flowing robes to impress everyone and that's what the
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.520]  mainstream media does and listeners tell me wear a suit wear a tie every show
[24:35.520 --> 24:41.280]  have an even fancier studio and I kind of want to ask the audience I mean I can
[24:41.280 --> 24:45.480]  hire a company to come in here and do that it's been a few hundred thousand
[24:45.480 --> 24:50.880]  dollars and to build a big fancy studio and I can go get thousand dollar suits
[24:50.880 --> 24:55.600]  and I could even have people load my own writing in a teleprompter so I look
[24:55.600 --> 25:03.560]  right at it and do that but you know what I'm not going to I'm not going to
[25:03.560 --> 25:09.040]  but because that's all part of this fake culture sure it's good to wear a sports
[25:09.040 --> 25:13.440]  jacket sometimes but that's not what the information is if I wore a pair of
[25:13.440 --> 25:28.760]  sunglasses today on this TV show the TV show version of the broadcast if I did
[25:28.760 --> 25:37.160]  that if I wore sunglasses it would suddenly all be in the comments on the
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.120]  video from it when we post it about how I was wearing sunglasses it's all about
[25:42.120 --> 25:46.320]  the surface of things and that's how Bill Gates can sit up there and wear a
[25:46.320 --> 25:50.560]  suit and a tie and act real gentlemanly and talk in a friendly non-threatening
[25:50.560 --> 25:57.600]  voice and he is basically like at all Fetler I mean he's a eugenicist on record
[25:57.600 --> 26:02.800]  that says reduce population you can pull his quotes up he quote use vaccines
[26:02.800 --> 26:06.480]  like I've got the quotes again today right out of news articles right out of
[26:06.480 --> 26:16.200]  video quotes of him I saw a UK independent article requoting quotes
[26:16.200 --> 26:23.440]  what was the headline Bill Gates says use vaccines and GMO to reduce
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.480]  population I mean I mean how much more obvious as it get but because he's this
[26:27.480 --> 26:36.960]  little friendly guy and I've talked a lot about this I've talked a lot about
[26:36.960 --> 26:44.160]  this over the years that serial killers it comes out in criminology know to
[26:44.160 --> 26:49.600]  wear a suit and tie and to be queen cut and they just can get women in cars with
[26:49.600 --> 26:53.600]  them a lot easier because women don't think a guy in a suit and tie is gonna
[26:53.600 --> 26:57.640]  pull a gun on them and say I'm taking you out to a farm just be quiet everything
[26:57.640 --> 27:01.040]  will be okay of course it's not going to be okay and they get them to the farm
[27:01.040 --> 27:04.520]  and tie them down and rape them for a couple weeks and torture them and quote
[27:04.520 --> 27:10.600]  use them up and the globalists are a bunch of serial killers and suits openly
[27:10.600 --> 27:16.800]  setting up world government and here is the alternative media that in every
[27:16.800 --> 27:22.080]  metric is crushing the old dinosaur media but still even those of us in the
[27:22.080 --> 27:28.280]  alternative media that is the new media and supplanting the globalist media the
[27:28.280 --> 27:34.080]  deceptive trader media we still more people I talked to still marvel at oh
[27:34.080 --> 27:41.000]  my gosh you were on Fox Business Alex I saw a YouTube and they played a clip of
[27:41.000 --> 27:47.280]  your show on one of those congratulations Fox Business on average has

[27:57.400 --> 28:03.840]  hours million conservatively from the AM and FM affiliates and I look I'm not
[28:03.840 --> 28:08.520]  getting into my show here about this all day

[28:18.480 --> 28:30.760]  a scam and it's so incredibly irritating to see them get away with this hoax
[28:30.760 --> 28:34.680]  because even though they don't have any viewers anymore even though it's a joke
[28:34.680 --> 28:38.200]  even though they're falling apart trying to censor the web now and alternative
[28:38.200 --> 28:45.040]  media because they know the liars know they're a imploded rotten husk a shell a
[28:45.040 --> 28:55.720]  facade a projection they know that they're very well aware of it I mean
[28:55.720 --> 28:59.880]  sometimes they'll say oh my gosh they played a clip of your show on CNN
[28:59.880 --> 29:06.280]  congratulations congratulations my gosh the average CNN show has about a

[33:38.480 --> 33:43.480]  control danger that the globalists are bringing us all under including themselves
[33:43.480 --> 33:49.080]  and that it's so obvious and documented and that the threat is bearing down on

[34:17.360 --> 34:21.000]  little kids inside of it I mean I think about if the globalists get their
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.400]  agenda 21 through it's designed to reduce world population according to
[34:25.400 --> 34:29.160]  State Department of Random 200 and literally hundreds of globalist

[34:39.320 --> 34:46.280]  father of Nazis it's public that it's a bunch of racism it's public that world
[34:46.280 --> 34:50.520]  governments being established it's public they're designing the GMO to reduce
[34:50.520 --> 34:57.360]  our fertility you know they've got biological weapons treaties but all
[34:57.360 --> 35:02.000]  these governments violate them and create incredible weapons and weaponized
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.480]  flues Ebola you name it we've talked a lot about that it's back in the news
[35:05.480 --> 35:09.120]  today at least there's some discussion about this like why are all the
[35:09.120 --> 35:13.400]  universities producing this is a good idea and then letting people know they
[35:13.400 --> 35:20.120]  have them by the way I mean they'll have dirty money under armed guards at
[35:20.120 --> 35:24.640]  banks behind a big vault and they've got stuff that will kill over 90% of those
[35:24.640 --> 35:31.320]  that comes in contact with just behind swipe card keypad doors in level 2
[35:31.320 --> 35:35.440]  containment when it should be in level 4 underground with men with machine guns
[35:35.440 --> 35:39.600]  on the top level guarding it and minefields and electrified fences
[35:39.600 --> 35:45.320]  that's what level 4 is supposed to have underground with containment systems
[35:45.320 --> 35:51.520]  with fire bombs to be released if the bio weapon gets out barbed wire fences
[35:51.520 --> 35:55.000]  the inner one electrified with a minefield and men with shoot to kill
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.320]  orders they just don't have them in those facilities anymore they guard the
[35:59.320 --> 36:07.840]  big bio weapon stockpiles with that on military bases now they've just got it
[36:07.840 --> 36:12.680]  you know University of Texas at Galveston on the side of the beach
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.440]  I've got all this news and it's all just perfume on a pig it's all just side
[36:23.440 --> 36:28.360]  issues compared to the fact that the people running the planet are crazy
[36:28.360 --> 36:31.880]  they're mad men there's no way they can be protected from all the stuff they're
[36:31.880 --> 36:35.480]  doing I know they built underground bunkers for the elite they admit they
[36:35.480 --> 36:40.360]  have them I know they built seed vaults and in DNA vaults for plants and
[36:40.360 --> 36:47.920]  animals I know all that's admitted and every preparation they're making it
[36:47.920 --> 36:53.320]  looks like is for a scenario where they release bio weapons infect the entire
[36:53.320 --> 36:58.000]  biosphere with stuff that takes over the genetics of everything that comes in
[36:58.000 --> 37:06.000]  contact it's like a slow-motion thing I was watching the new thing this morning
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.760]  while jogging on the treadmill and of course it's absorbing people in a
[37:10.760 --> 37:14.560]  matter of minutes but but the stuff the New World Order designs it's the
[37:14.560 --> 37:18.880]  perfect weapon and they've written about this the eugenesis did in the 20s they
[37:18.880 --> 37:22.760]  were saying we've got to discover the you know the the tiny building blocks we
[37:22.760 --> 37:30.360]  can create the Superman and by the 40s the top eugenesis Watson and others had
[37:30.360 --> 37:34.720]  a discovery look at all the discoverers they're all eugenesis you got to hand it
[37:34.720 --> 37:40.400]  to them actually went out discovered all this so they could play God and some
[37:40.400 --> 37:43.480]  people say we'll see they may they should be in charge they came up with this
[37:43.480 --> 37:47.960]  master plan they carry it out the public going along with it they
[37:47.960 --> 37:55.200]  deserve to die what about me I know what you're doing I'm not stupid I don't want
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.960]  to die I don't want to be soft killed it's it's so uncool it's so creepy it's
[37:59.960 --> 38:03.920]  so out of control don't you have any empathy for the general public and
[38:03.920 --> 38:07.960]  they're like well you're weak-minded you don't have that last attribute that we
[38:07.960 --> 38:12.200]  have of being cold-blooded and actually in many cases being hot-blooded and
[38:12.200 --> 38:19.440]  enjoying what we're doing to people I've talked to so many chemists and
[38:19.440 --> 38:25.880]  biologists who've you know contacted me or I've run into at events or that I'm
[38:25.880 --> 38:28.960]  you'll have a dinner with a neighbor and they're there and they go we know who
[38:28.960 --> 38:33.640]  you are that's why we invited you over yes what are you going to do to stop it
[38:33.640 --> 38:37.840]  everything you're saying is true and they are preparing to release the the plague
[38:37.840 --> 38:43.840]  to reduce population mm-hmm what are you going to do though you're not going to
[38:43.840 --> 38:50.080]  stop them and then I run into another group of doctors and scientists out in
[38:50.080 --> 38:53.520]  the countryside living out there they're like yes we all know that's why we moved
[38:53.520 --> 38:57.720]  here we're preparing for the bio weapon release and hope our children won't die
[38:57.720 --> 39:01.480]  as they watch their kids playing and I'm just like so you people all know I
[39:01.480 --> 39:05.640]  guess you do your biologist and scientist you got they tried to recruit you
[39:05.640 --> 39:08.960]  too I guess and you're the ones that didn't go along with it I mean you know
[39:08.960 --> 39:14.680]  they tried to recruit my dad because he was top of his class I mean listeners
[39:14.680 --> 39:18.200]  that they've engineered the food to sterilize you and give you cancer and
[39:18.200 --> 39:22.240]  give you birth defects and hurt your children I mean it's going on all
[39:22.240 --> 39:25.720]  around us it's horrible
[39:25.720 --> 39:37.360]  and I just go into a frustrated rage all the time and I'm doing it my family
[39:37.360 --> 39:42.800]  life I'm doing it around the office because I can feel the danger I can
[39:42.800 --> 39:46.400]  the hair on the back of my neck standing up half the time now everybody feels it
[39:46.400 --> 39:50.040]  I mean they're getting ready to start World War three with Iran Russia and
[39:50.040 --> 39:54.400]  China that's mainline publications are saying that that's probably what it'll
[39:54.400 --> 39:59.400]  lead to they're moving nukes around the communist Chinese leader for the first
[39:59.400 --> 40:03.480]  time I've ever seen says prepare for war with the US the world economy's melting
[40:03.480 --> 40:09.400]  down that's when they started World War one and World War two they're
[40:09.400 --> 40:12.880]  dispatching tattletale squads everywhere it's all over the news the
[40:12.880 --> 40:16.040]  government's tracking and listening to everything there's not even a pretense
[40:16.040 --> 40:21.160]  now the fourth amendment callers are sending me emails callers are calling
[40:21.160 --> 40:26.800]  in certainly in Houston Dallas San Antonio you know the caller called about
[40:26.800 --> 40:29.640]  have you seen the Dallas morning news last week TSA's on the streets of
[40:29.640 --> 40:34.640]  Dallas and I'm like no but I do they were gonna be and then I was checking my
[40:34.640 --> 40:38.280]  email and other stuff and looking online and comments and now I learned it's
[40:38.280 --> 40:43.120]  every city everywhere TSA now on the streets I mean I knew it was coming but
[40:43.120 --> 40:48.040]  bam baby federal goons on the streets that are gonna start putting their hands
[40:48.040 --> 40:53.280]  on you I mean this is hardcore martial law and as soon as they start a false
[40:53.280 --> 40:57.760]  flag attacks they're gonna shut down my show they're gonna send idiot local
[40:57.760 --> 41:01.960]  police to arrest my butt probably I mean it and then these cops that come for me
[41:01.960 --> 41:06.640]  our little victims eating poison food drinking poison water and it's all
[41:06.640 --> 41:11.480]  admitted I can't even hate them anymore I'm so aware of how all this works these
[41:11.480 --> 41:17.680]  are little moron victims and then I look at my beautiful decent children I'm
[41:17.680 --> 41:22.120]  like you know why don't I just run to the hills hide out in the country go to
[41:22.120 --> 41:25.520]  Costa Rica like so many people they're doing just just you know get you be in
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.920]  the rear with the gear I look at the innocence of my children but I realize
[41:30.920 --> 41:34.720]  that's a lie they have no future if we don't beat this if we don't stand against
[41:34.720 --> 41:39.560]  this but you do think about it you get frustrated you get mad the globalist for
[41:39.560 --> 41:44.680]  ruining your life ruining your future just by their absolute competitive
[41:44.680 --> 41:49.680]  nastiness they the worst people the most intelligent psycho control freaks
[41:49.680 --> 41:55.120]  compete with each other to get into power and then they interbreed over
[41:55.120 --> 42:00.040]  hundreds of years and a lot of psychopathic and sociopathic behavior
[42:00.040 --> 42:04.480]  is genetic it's been you know linked directly to two genes and so it's a
[42:04.480 --> 42:09.920]  super breed of sadist control freak psychopaths and armies of mercenaries
[42:09.920 --> 42:15.240]  that work for them who are so delusional now they think some underground
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.520]  bunkers and some seed vaults are gonna save them from all their GMO stuff
[42:19.520 --> 42:24.640]  their perfect Trojan horse an invisible enemy you can't see that kills you
[42:24.640 --> 42:29.040]  slowly so no one can figure out where it's coming from and then you find out
[42:29.040 --> 42:33.400]  that they call it soft kill and have written white papers on it publicly
[42:33.400 --> 42:45.040]  talking about how they're doing it to us I mean wow that is hard core and and
[42:45.040 --> 42:48.720]  it's like almost everybody I know is now having deformed children with you
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.800]  know different organ problems bone problems all sorts of illnesses
[42:53.800 --> 43:00.040]  intestinal illnesses viral bacterial mutations neurological disorders are
[43:00.040 --> 43:04.320]  just skyrocket some neurological disorders have seen 10,000 plus percent
[43:04.320 --> 43:09.920]  increases the last 30 years a diabetes to 3,000 depending on the type percent
[43:09.920 --> 43:18.040]  increase cancer 2,000 plus percent I mean they're hardcore killing us man and
[43:18.040 --> 43:24.360]  let me tell you something I'm a human being I'm just a man a normal but I am
[43:24.360 --> 43:29.880]  a man and I get aggressive feelings I can't hardly go to a mall anymore I can't
[43:29.880 --> 43:33.760]  hardly go out in public because man if I see some five-year-old who's clearly on
[43:33.760 --> 43:38.120]  chemo therapy with their hair falling out and their eyes shining so bright as
[43:38.120 --> 43:41.320]  you could tell they're gonna die you can see the death in their eyes because
[43:41.320 --> 43:45.960]  they're so alive but you had a whole future out of them so much and you
[43:45.960 --> 43:50.520]  idiots why break down like this you you little hard bastards online make jokes
[43:50.520 --> 43:54.600]  and say it's fake I wish it was fake okay let me tell you something I live in
[43:54.600 --> 43:59.000]  the real world I'm taking on all this pain I'm not rationalizing I'm not
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.320]  denying I know what's going on I know what's gonna happen to me I know what's
[44:03.320 --> 44:09.160]  gonna happen to my family I'm sacrificing myself so we've got a chance
[44:09.160 --> 44:13.440]  which stuff gets so bad you people won't be in denial anymore that you would have
[44:13.440 --> 44:19.200]  at least been told and you're gonna have to pass it on verbally this morning I
[44:19.200 --> 44:22.960]  was researching and looking into governments erasing a voice off the web
[44:22.960 --> 44:29.200]  I typed company software to erase a voice off the web and found Optimus
[44:29.200 --> 44:33.640]  Prime I sent you a link to it actually you've got it over there once you pull
[44:33.640 --> 44:38.520]  it up you type in the voice of Optimus Prime most of the clips of it even when
[44:38.520 --> 44:41.840]  it's the guy talking to people on YouTube when they go up to you know
[44:41.840 --> 44:47.160]  signing things and stuff at comic book conferences his voice is erased because
[44:47.160 --> 44:51.560]  he has a contract with a record company for his voice and it's being erased
[44:51.560 --> 44:56.400]  off the web because I knew that's gonna be next where they can literally hit a
[44:56.400 --> 45:02.360]  button on any of these big sites and your voice is gone that's the type of
[45:02.360 --> 45:07.800]  censorship that's what the next web is that's internet to that's the future and
[45:07.800 --> 45:11.600]  we're being delisted everywhere we're being blocked everywhere as the system
[45:11.600 --> 45:15.760]  tries to keep us from going viral which I should be glad I guess they're
[45:15.760 --> 45:19.760]  suppressing us to a certain point because I guess the next step will be just
[45:19.760 --> 45:24.320]  kill me but you know what I'd rather go total mega viral and force them to move
[45:24.320 --> 45:28.040]  their hand because I love life so much I'm willing to give it up I'm willing to
[45:28.040 --> 45:31.280]  have whatever monsters come at me out of the New World Order to deal with it
[45:31.280 --> 45:35.240]  because I'm tired of their soft kill creeping death I want to get them out in
[45:35.240 --> 45:39.520]  the open moving against us instead of poisoning our food poisoning our water
[45:39.520 --> 45:44.000]  and doing all this to us and thinking it's funny we've got to engage them in
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.840]  the info war and hammer them hard and get them off their timeline which we're
[45:47.840 --> 45:51.160]  starting to do it's like an arm wrestling match and we've got the initiative
[45:51.160 --> 45:53.840]  they had us pushed all the way down but you know we're doing this for our
[45:53.840 --> 45:56.760]  families and we got it up and we've got them all the way over and they're
[45:56.760 --> 46:00.840]  really pushing back hard now and we've got to just say you know what you're
[46:00.840 --> 46:07.240]  going down we got to pound them down we got to just you know what you're going
[46:07.240 --> 46:12.000]  down it's not it's not a question it's a decision you got to decide you know
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.800]  what I take all the fear I take it all and it makes me strong just whatever's
[46:15.800 --> 46:21.640]  coming I'm in God's hands give it to me I haven't given the number out yet I got
[46:21.640 --> 46:25.360]  all these guests coming up I wanted to take calls it's just that the quickening
[46:25.360 --> 46:31.200]  in my soul the quickening in my heart is so incredible I couldn't go to sleep
[46:31.200 --> 46:34.920]  last night I was up till 2 in the morning I jumped out of bed at 5 30 in
[46:34.920 --> 46:43.160]  the morning and I'm just it's all coming down I mean you can feel it you can see
[46:43.160 --> 46:52.200]  it you know it and the judgment of our world is it happens all the time 20% to
[46:52.200 --> 46:57.640]  30% depending on which estimate you look at it's in between 20 to 30% of the
[46:57.640 --> 47:00.680]  Cambodians were killed US government funded Khmer Rouge was funded by the
[47:00.680 --> 47:10.040]  Big of Brzezinski he brags about it 22 million Germans died separate from
[47:10.040 --> 47:14.400]  war 22 million Germans died that was what following Hitler did for him you're
[47:14.400 --> 47:22.400]  gonna say something Chris yeah yeah well I mean actually the one I the one I
[47:22.400 --> 47:26.000]  think you was one where they haven't erased it yet but but then I meant yeah
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.440]  there's a bunch like if you do the voice of Optimus Prime or the man that
[47:30.440 --> 47:34.120]  was Optimus Prime you'll you'll see the videos on YouTube you'll see a bunch of
[47:34.120 --> 47:37.880]  them when you try to play him it has a notice and it says this boy you know this
[47:37.880 --> 47:41.520]  voice is the property and it's even him at comic book conferences doing the
[47:41.520 --> 47:44.660]  voice and the computer recognizes it it's not allowed to be out because they
[47:44.660 --> 47:50.800]  own his voice and I mean my point is is that that's how they can that's how they
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.680]  can shut down and just with this new web system and then they admit with all
[47:54.680 --> 47:59.280]  these filters they can shut down discussions they can shut down whole
[47:59.280 --> 48:03.680]  voices this is how they're gonna come at people so you better keep hard copies
[48:03.680 --> 48:06.880]  of everything I've talked about you better keep your old technology you
[48:06.880 --> 48:11.080]  better you know invest in good old-fashioned printing machines whatever
[48:11.080 --> 48:16.680]  because I'm telling you well I mean Kindle is on record we had Dr. Stallman
[48:16.680 --> 48:19.520]  on saying no they're building Trojan horses into everything where they hit
[48:19.520 --> 48:25.760]  one button and thousands of Kindle books are erased even ones you paid for I
[48:26.760 --> 48:30.600]  mean think about it yeah you can use all this as a double-edged sword to get
[48:30.600 --> 48:34.520]  the word out but the system isn't gonna let that happen these people kill folks
[48:34.520 --> 48:40.120]  for oil and money and power they're ruthless and only by realizing you can't
[48:40.120 --> 48:43.360]  reason with the New World Order you can't have debates and discussions with
[48:43.360 --> 48:48.680]  them they are crazy and I need professors to do research on this I
[48:48.680 --> 48:51.880]  actually did some searching and did actually find some papers that mention
[48:51.880 --> 48:56.160]  it going back more than a hundred years so it has been recognized but why is
[48:56.160 --> 49:02.200]  their psychopathic tendency and mental illness tendencies in royalty and
[49:02.200 --> 49:07.840]  and and wealthy elites that tend to act like royalty and intermarry because
[49:07.840 --> 49:12.280]  genetically they're ruthless and don't have a normal conscience and so they do
[49:12.280 --> 49:16.120]  rise to the top because they're like cancer in a body they're malfunctioning
[49:16.120 --> 49:21.200]  they're not full humans they're actually subhuman the people like Hitler was a
[49:21.200 --> 49:25.800]  subhuman but you can be a subhuman black person white person Jewish person
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.200]  Arab person you know there's good people there's bad people but but literally
[49:30.200 --> 49:36.280]  they're not fully human they don't have the conscience and it is genetic you know
[49:36.280 --> 49:40.280]  it's it's you know that bloodlines mean you know hey I'm getting rid of these
[49:40.280 --> 49:44.360]  bulls they keep attacking people I'm gonna get a breed of bull that aren't as
[49:44.360 --> 49:48.320]  vicious I mean it's it's it's it's simple and they've been
[49:48.320 --> 49:54.920]  intermarrying but but but more than that the syphilis the mercury the lead the
[49:54.920 --> 49:58.360]  arsenic that the alchemist and people would always give the elites so DNA
[49:58.360 --> 50:03.320]  mutation turns out that the priest class was always feeding the royalty and even
[50:03.320 --> 50:08.800]  the higher priest class poisonous metals the reason the global system is so
[50:08.800 --> 50:13.200]  psycho and crazy even worse than the average cycle on the street is that it
[50:13.200 --> 50:18.440]  is an inbred system and a culture that grew of people literally with
[50:18.440 --> 50:23.200]  microscopic worms eating their brains that's what that's what syphilis
[50:23.200 --> 50:27.800]  basically is the microscopic you know worms microbes and they're just beyond
[50:27.800 --> 50:33.000]  insane just like the Prince you know the member of the Royal House was Jack the
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.920]  Ripper out killing people that's been confirmed now I mean he had syphilis I
[50:36.920 --> 50:40.000]  mean his brain was being eaten and he was on arsenic to treat it which he makes
[50:40.000 --> 50:46.280]  even crazier so we have an elite who set up eugenics when most of them had
[50:46.280 --> 50:50.600]  syphilis that's why all the mafia ended up living in hot springs Arkansas it was
[50:50.600 --> 50:54.200]  the top syphilis treatment center so the Rockefellers were all down there too I
[50:54.200 --> 50:58.160]  mean they didn't in the 30s and 40s they were still completely psycho our whole

[53:07.200 --> 53:10.320]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[53:10.320 --> 53:13.960]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and
[53:13.960 --> 53:17.800]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so

[54:47.600 --> 54:55.120]  might as well be vampires might as well be the devil because I can't imagine a
[54:55.120 --> 54:59.720]  science fiction movie where you have a global elite who are so crazy they've
[54:59.720 --> 55:03.480]  got nine out of ten nuclear reactors leaking radiation just type that into a
[55:03.480 --> 55:07.440]  surgeon that's mainstream news they're raising isotope level thousands of
[55:07.440 --> 55:11.980]  percentages saying they're all safe we've got troops using weapons that soft
[55:11.980 --> 55:15.160]  kill them they're shooting everybody up with deadly vaccines starting all these
[55:15.160 --> 55:20.040]  wars creating GMO cross species creatures everywhere that are infecting the
[55:20.040 --> 55:24.040]  entire biosphere while lecturing us all day about giving up our rights for the
[55:24.040 --> 55:31.680]  environment and then I find the poetry of the nihilistic transhumanist top
[55:31.680 --> 55:37.200]  globalist I haven't my film in game and they say yes to keep on willing we the
[55:37.200 --> 55:41.720]  elite might blow the planet up just to be number one why it'd be the greatest
[55:41.720 --> 55:45.360]  thing in history to blow the planet up and kill everyone that would just end
[55:45.360 --> 55:50.240]  us I would be the greatest ever and then I found out that linen wrote stuff
[55:50.240 --> 55:53.760]  like that and then here are transhumanists today writing stuff like
[55:53.760 --> 56:00.880]  that I mean it's a spirit folks it's a it's it's death it's cancer and it
[56:00.880 --> 56:05.800]  thinks well I can just take over so I'm the boss yeah you can take over and
[56:05.800 --> 56:11.080]  screw everything up that mean I mean anybody listening to this show could go
[56:11.080 --> 56:14.800]  home today and shoot their neighbors for no reason does that mean you got the
[56:14.800 --> 56:19.160]  power a cop driving along and pull a family over and shoot them all in the
[56:19.160 --> 56:23.320]  head does that mean he's real powerful no it means you got a problem it means
[56:23.320 --> 56:28.720]  you're screwed up oh so you can take thousands of species and cross them with
[56:28.720 --> 56:31.680]  each other and release salmon that they admit will extinct all the regular
[56:31.680 --> 56:38.760]  salmon they're a part insect into the ocean I mean bio weapons treaties aren't
[56:38.760 --> 56:42.200]  even followed and these companies are all just infecting everything and then
[56:42.200 --> 56:50.760]  when they infect you they come and sue you saying you stole their patent and
[56:50.760 --> 56:54.760]  again it's the boldness of these globalists the people go well they're
[56:54.760 --> 56:59.920]  bold oh so you came and trespassed on my farm pulled up my corn that's natural
[56:59.920 --> 57:03.360]  and out of the seat the natural seeds but plants don't just have one daddy and
[57:03.360 --> 57:06.200]  one mommy and it can be a hundred mommies and daddy's since the pollen
[57:06.200 --> 57:11.320]  mixes in so you found less than 1% Monsanto genetics in my corn in a
[57:11.320 --> 57:17.960]  laboratory that you obviously infected my crop with and and and now you got a
[57:17.960 --> 57:23.000]  court saying you're gonna find me $10,000 an acre saying my entire crop was
[57:23.000 --> 57:30.400]  stolen from you they're like yep so so you're gonna infect me
[57:30.400 --> 57:34.720]  I'd like if you went to somebody's house and poured motor oil all over their
[57:34.720 --> 57:38.200]  carpet and then gave them a ticket and said you owe me money because you
[57:38.200 --> 57:41.560]  trespassed you're like you're in my house pouring motor oil on the white
[57:41.560 --> 57:48.880]  carpet they're like does it matter the court's gonna rule for me I know all I
[57:48.880 --> 57:52.280]  talk about GMO now because I'm really getting that's why they're so smug that's
[57:52.280 --> 57:58.120]  why it's so funny to them and I'm done it ain't after we're gonna get Greg

[58:25.640 --> 58:30.080]  got up there in his statement as a victim and said this is an inside job so

[58:33.160 --> 58:36.000]  government guy I'm on the plane it turned out it's true but that shouldn't be

[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.640]  Jones.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:32.600]  Well we got a lot of news Arizona's considering a bill to finance the
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:38.520]  vehicles and communications equipment for volunteer militia to patrol the border.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:43.440]  The border is a complete lawless war zone with the feds ordering the border
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.400]  patrol basically to stand down on record. The border patrol have gone public on that.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.880]  Of course the government shipping guns to Mexico and the media the the trader
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:57.960]  new world order occupational brainwasher media. I'm not just saying that I mean
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:03.360]  this is a foreign globalist banker whore media there to destroy this country here
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.240]  to bring in world government here to destroy our sovereignty they're like
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.760]  oh my gosh a militia that's what civil defense is and the feds do actually have
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.960]  jurisdiction right on the border they're supposed to be there it's one of the
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.520]  few things they're supposed to do but since they won't let them do their job
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:24.480]  the state can also put people right up next to the border and simply get local
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.760]  police to take care of it and find the sheriffs to have basically a posse because
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.960]  the illegals are burning down houses raping killing people I mean I got piles
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:38.120]  of news here today I'm looking at and in full wars.com just on that front it is
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:43.560]  total bedlam here's some of the news FBI to spy on the gold bugs via
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:48.080]  suspicious comments app and if you talk on Twitter about paying for cash for
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:52.920]  coffee or anything you're being flack DHS as you know has huge hiring programs
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:57.600]  hiring all the spies FEMA follows DHS in monitoring news coverage of its
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:04.920]  activities 24-7 then they contact YouTube on record and tell them I take that
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.560]  video down or block it or put parental controls on it it's critical of
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:15.320]  government and and what do the requests say which hurts our capability to
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.160]  protect you. Sensor this person because it hurts our capability to protect
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.960]  everyone if we don't look good in the public side and they know we're
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.840]  narcotics trafficking murders that ship guns into Mexico and run child
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.760]  kidnapping rings worldwide and launder the drug money you know hundreds of
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:33.600]  billions a year everybody won't go along with this anymore so let's start
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.600]  censoring them that's a translation continuing Kurt Haskell exposes
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:43.320]  government deception and underwear bomber case that's up there we actually
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.520]  got his full statement first and ended up being picked up by the AP and others
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.240]  with no credit to us of course they gave it to us first even right as the press
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:55.640]  conference took place actually get just way before the press conference have
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.840]  released at this time and we get up releasing it after his press conference
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.520]  and so some media got the jump on us we're so trendy we actually don't break
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:09.800]  big nose and we could we sat on it but it doesn't even matter the point is it's
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.360]  already in the featured news archive up there also when technology fails when

[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.960]  conservatives and enthusiasts cheer the end of the long gun registry more than
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.520]  a decade ago they passed the gun registry program of gun owners and gun
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:46.680]  purchases and government use it for gun confiscation in law-abiding cases and
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.040]  then I have the Washington Times article in our official Obama wants to
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:55.280]  outlaw guns in second term and he said to Sarah Brady I will do this through
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:00.200]  covert means like shipping guns to Mexico and blaming on the second
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.000]  amendment even CBS News reported the memos you know back and forth why are
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.520]  we doing this it's illegal it's gonna be used to restrict second amendment
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:14.760]  to be used to shut down gun shows and ban semi-auto rifles and handguns that's
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:20.120]  most guns that's the memos I mean they want your guns as a state senator he
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.720]  said total gun ban his attorney general might as well be a North Korean
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:27.920]  dictator he says there is no private ownership right
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:35.000]  you know dear the UN a small arms group says ban the second amendment July 7th
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.360]  2000 meeting go read it online they said we will have the complete abolition
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:45.920]  of individual firearms ownership because it threatens the legitimate power
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:51.080]  monopoly of the state of course that's a honest statement except for the part
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:55.640]  about power monopolies being legitimate you think a slave in ancient Rome had a
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:02.400]  sword you think a black slave had a gun back the first gun laws were passed at
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.320]  the end of the Civil War they said look in the south they said we're not gonna
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:15.320]  have black folks with guns pass them so I'm gonna get into that report because
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.240]  it's getting more attention now we're in a lot of trouble and by the way Mitt
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:23.400]  Romney will go after your guns and in carbon taxes this is the elite want
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:28.440]  there's slaves this arm just like a bank robber comes in and tells the arm guard
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.520]  put your hands up put the gun you know put the gun on the floor everybody
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.880]  hands up the government's like hands up can't have a garden we're shutting down
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.920]  the Amish selling milk can't sell peaches on the side of the road can't
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.360]  have guns can't have a water well people who live on lakes who even have the
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.000]  property rights going back and water rights on record are being told sorry
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.680]  LCR a sold out to a foreign group you can't take water out of the lake

[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.120]  all over the world they're coming in they're taking over the water they're
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.520]  taking over the roads they're hijacking and they got their people saying we're
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:05.680]  taking your guns Obama is a fascist teleprompter reading maggot and so is
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.840]  Mitt Romney so are all of them and if you want real change you better wake up
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.360]  to that fundamental fact when the big money is putting money behind somebody
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.920]  like Mittens Romney or Newtie Gennrich you better believe they're the scum of
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.260]  the earth let's say they're not a bad person they're still total sellouts
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:27.240]  empty suits that are basically just animated by whatever's on the teleprompter
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.200]  the guys will just have a virtual president that's a computer program and
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.880]  then that system just puts words into it all right I want to get into the economy
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.120]  I want to get into the just I mean it's all over the news they're saying yeah
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.240]  war is imminent with Iran troops massing they're saying Iran's gonna blow stuff up
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:48.560]  in the Israel in the US governments are known Gulf of Tonkin type stuff Cheney
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:54.520]  got caught wanting to do it I mean and the CFR saying brace for an attack we
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:59.840]  could be days months just like I told you last year the plan is to hit but the
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.480]  Pentagon said no again last year and now they're getting the Pentagon certain to
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:07.560]  say okay I guess we can I guess we can man I tell you this is a nightmare
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:15.160]  all right joining us for the rest of the hour joining us for the rest of the hour is
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.880]  Greg Palastin and of course he's the best-selling author written for the BBC
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:26.040]  written for London Guardian you name it ABC News I remember they put an arrest
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.600]  warrant out after Katrina under Homeland Security saying he was showing
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.080]  secret installations and it was on the news was an arrest warrant out for him
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.680]  because they have under the Patriot Act saying if you report on sensitive
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.200]  installations this was a toxic waste dump you can be arrested not thought my
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.200]  gosh is this real I wouldn't look it up there it was and he's one of the few
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.400]  people in mainstream media who will actually tell it like it is though I
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.800]  mean he attacks the left and the right as a former federal you know fraud
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:56.440]  investigator and he goes after the whole system and I had him on the other
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:01.040]  night riveting interview on on the TV show but since we've talked in so much
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.240]  is going on what is number one on your radar I've got my questions you hear me
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:14.760]  hear ranting about all of this but what is number one on your radar well Alex I
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:20.240]  would say number one on my radar is the end of democracy and it's ending where
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:25.560]  it began in Greece the the bankers have now taken a decided that they have the
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.400]  right to appoint presidents and prime ministers and they're being applauded by
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:34.440]  you know the mainstream press from the New York Times and of course the European
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:40.760]  Union etc so you have a an economics professor who was a bank advisor in the
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:44.120]  US I'm not even sure you could call him Greek he had Greek parents is born in
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:52.880]  Greece is now the so-called prime minister of Greece you have Monti Carl
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:58.320]  Monti who is now been appointed prime minister of Italy again not elected so
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.560]  the cradle democracy and and and Italy not elected this you're gonna see this
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:07.840]  all over the place so-called caretaker tech we're already in Michigan and
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.360]  Rhode Island and in New Jersey and all over where they're taking over even
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.360]  major cities like in Robocop or something I'm saying the corporation runs
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:20.080]  things now the city signs on defraud and derivatives that weren't there they
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.920]  double triple prices on everything and then turn the street lights off I mean
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:29.880]  this is what they did in Argentina yeah and except that in Argentina the people
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:34.400]  rose up and they went into the streets and they told the IMF to go stick it to
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.280]  where the bankstone shine and now their economy is growing at 8% a year they
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:43.120]  told the bankers to forget it you're not you know JP Morgan Goldman Sachs that
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.680]  gang is not allowed to operate not allowed to operate in Argentina Brazil
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.920]  those economies are booming they never got poisoned by the toxic derivatives
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:56.880]  once they threw these guys out and and that's what's happening in every case you
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:02.480]  let these vampires in they're gonna suck you dry yeah I mean in the case of
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.160]  Argentina for example they sold off they're required to privatize the water
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.840]  systems just as we're doing here they sold off the Buenos Aires water system
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:16.400]  to Enron after Jeb Bush made a personal call to the president of Argentina Menem
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.080]  and said I you know my daddy's about to become president this is when Bush Senior
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:25.560]  was coming in and he would appreciate it if if you would turn over the water
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:32.800]  system to Enron and it's not like Menem had any struples and the pressure was on
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.920]  and he turned it over and of course it ended up with 400% increase in the price
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.160]  of water and then no water and then the company evap and then the company with
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.520]  the water evaporated but you're that's the pattern they tried it there then they
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:49.080]  bring it here they tried it in Latin America then they bring it over to Europe
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:53.600]  I mean you just talked about what's happening in Greece I call Greece a crime
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:57.760]  scene it's not it's not a nation where people were profligate and they're a
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:03.320]  bunch of lazy you know Uzo Swilling olive pits spitting Greeks that just hang
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:06.720]  around and retire when they're teenagers that that's the baloney you get from the
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:11.080]  press these are hard-working people they have long very long work hours longer
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:16.400]  much longer than Germany by the way officially the problem is is that their
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:21.480]  their banking system was looted by an agreement between the last two
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:25.720]  governments both their big parties and Goldman Sachs it was just looted well
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.000]  their finance ministers and presidents were all Goldman Sachs people yeah and
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.880]  what they had was there was a deal and I discuss this my book vultures picnic
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:42.880]  there is a deal to hide the deficit of Greece through a currency swap arrangement
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.920]  with Goldman Sachs Goldman on paper took a multi-billion dollar loss which
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:52.360]  Goldman never deliberately takes a multi-billion dollar loss on anything it
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.720]  was a phony and there's a secret agreement to pay them back at you
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.000]  serious interest rates plus they got a half billion dollar fee this is a
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.480]  fraud a nice work by the way for a some flim flam currency paper this is a
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.120]  fraud upon the market when I was a fraud investigator for the government when we
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:13.640]  used to actually you know put people in prison for that type of thing I mean
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.480]  that's what we did it's a violation that used to be considered violation of
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:21.800]  racketeering laws but when you do it in coordination with the heads of state
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.800]  secretly of another government they're not going to be touched they're not
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.960]  going to be touched and but what happened was when when it was discovered
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.880]  that there was nothing left in the Greek Treasury that had been looted in this
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:39.800]  matter of course they've had to now pay interest rates of 15 16 percent and the
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.360]  economies implode no one could pay that if your mortgage went up by 400% you
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.800]  you know it's not that you're being profligate you're being jacked it's a
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.680]  crime well no it's loan sharking and the IMF World Bank documents that you
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.840]  broke in 2002 was them internally admitting its predatory as if we need
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:02.120]  them to admit it to us but here is the signed sealed confession but expanding
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:06.960]  on that what do you make of Moody's S&P and others all finance and run by the
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.080]  big six megabanks or the big five as you call them that you know Geithner said
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:16.240]  you know admits he serves I want to talk about is it five or six yeah and now
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.080]  they're going out when it's the banks that are insolvent through fraud they've
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.800]  gotten government to shine on to too big to fail by threatening to implode the
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.760]  economy holding its hostage and so the very people that are actually the ones
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.440]  that are insolvent are now telling the governments and the people we're
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.880]  insolvent and have their ratings agencies that certified their their crud as
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:41.800]  triple a gold now decertifying and lowering things for government so they
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:46.680]  get higher interest rates on them I mean how obvious is that well look at it
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.360]  this way do you realize that the Fed window is lending money to the banks at
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.520]  one quarter percent interest the European Central Bank just lent out two
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:01.000]  thirds of a trillion dollars to European banks at one percent interest they
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.960]  then turn around and invested in government bonds which are guaranteed by
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:09.760]  you and me at four five and six percent that's a good business not investing in
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.000]  in housing not investing in businesses not investing in building the economy
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.960]  they're literally taking our money at a quarter to one percent interest and
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:21.400]  returning and literally picking up to three hundred percent returns it is
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:27.120]  astonishing is just a turn of this cash American banks today went from two
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:35.680]  billion dollars in cash reserve assets in 2007 to two nearly two trillion
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.640]  dollars today two billion to two trillion they're sitting on cash where they

[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:31.880]  the book is a vultures picnic excellent available at bookstores everywhere
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:36.040]  Greg palace.com I'm gonna give the toll free number out to discuss what's
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.440]  happening in Greece to discuss what's happening here in the United States
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:42.280]  because you better believe you think this recession going into depression is
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:47.320]  bad the bankers on record say they plan on imploding us because then they buy
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:51.280]  stuff up even cheaper they mass all the wealth have government regulators shut
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.920]  down their competition I've got to call this fascism but because it's global
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:00.200]  people go but isn't fascism nationalistic the manifestation of fascism in
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:04.480]  the 30s and 40s was this is not what would you call this Greg palace
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:10.760]  corporate fascism or corporate crony kleptocracy ism what's your term the
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:15.320]  answer would be yes on that actually the technical term meaning of fascism and
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.960]  I've read Mussolini's works by the way is a combination of government and
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:25.720]  corporate and corporate governance which they consider good as they say
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:31.120]  wealth creators taking over so the yeah technically it is fascism because when
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:36.000]  you have banks appoint the presidents that's the actual technical definition
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.880]  of fascism so indeed that's what it is what we have in Greece and what we're
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.400]  going to see here when we they're getting rid of so-called entitlements and by
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.880]  the way the reason you're called entitlements is you're entitled to it
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:51.000]  you paid insurance into your seat you paid for your social security that
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.080]  happens to be your account you've paid for your Medicare that's an insurance
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:58.080]  plan they announced two weeks ago they've already rated most of federal
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.600]  pension funds and put IOUs in there I mean this is going to destroy total
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:06.160]  confidence and in their plan as you know Greg it doesn't even get us out of the
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:12.080]  hole it's designed to impoverish us yes and in fact what we see in Europe now
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.880]  is that the guys who set the fire like I say Greece is a crime scene we see it in
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:22.960]  Italy Portugal Spain now it's moving into Finland Hungary and and across the
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.560]  UK Ireland what's happening is the guys who set the fires are picking up all
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.200]  the property at the fire sales I mean the Germans right now German industries
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:36.360]  and the wealthy of Germany are doing to Greece what their Panzer divisions
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.080]  couldn't do which is basically a full-scale takeover well they're right
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:45.080]  and the Greeks are pointing that out but but you're absolutely right they're
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.480]  doing through economic conquest and by a stealthier mode what Napoleon couldn't
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.840]  do yeah and what we're going to see in the US is privatizations we just saw
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.880]  the the today the both parties in Congress have agreed to put up spectrum
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:05.600]  for sale to AT&T Verizon the big boys will own the entire spectrum it used to
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.400]  be public airwaves it was something we own and the and the reason is the reason
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:15.080]  is is that we are have a desperate deficit problem so we're going to be
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:22.440]  selling off the family jewels listen in the in the high-def radio spectrum that
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.600]  opened up dozens and dozens of a channel spaces and talk radio this is something
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.760]  I know about they're giving almost none of them to even local mom and pops or
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:35.520]  community stations it's all to the megacorporations to put canned comedy on
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:42.360]  or or or nothing I mean so absolutely that's happening as well and they will
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:46.840]  not give it to local community stations yeah and a lot of it is you're going to
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.720]  see secure private corporate networks like the Koch industries has its own
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:56.840]  secure communication system so you're going to see basically corporations
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:00.400]  set up kind of an internal communications and intelligence operations of
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.800]  their own and that's where the spectrum will go it's a very you know so but
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.640]  again they're selling off public property public right how else are you
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.200]  going to keep the banks on this churn as they said you know and when we talk
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.720]  about the destruction being part of the plan as I said when I got the these
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:23.160]  documents from inside the IMF and the World Bank and you know and and the
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.560]  WTO which I show in vultures picnic I didn't just say oh you know I mean it
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:31.760]  could have been junk it could have been made up stuff that I pulled off some
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.040]  crazy site or something but it wasn't I got it inside but I had to get it
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:41.280]  confirmed I went to the head of the WTO Pascale of me and he confirmed the
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:45.080]  authenticity of my documents so did Joe Stiglitz the Nobel Prize winning
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.080]  economist who was chief economist for the World Bank he didn't give me any
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.360]  documents but he was willing to confirm their authenticity and I took them even
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:57.160]  to some heads of state and one of the things that I went over with Stiglitz
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:01.880]  which shocked me said it looks like they're actually figuring on destruction
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:05.840]  and riots in these plans like if there are riots like we had in Greece the bank
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:12.280]  burnings like we had in Argentina riots in the streets in Ecuador that that
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.240]  then gives the excuse to bring the tanks into the street there's repression
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:20.040]  there's then a caretaker so-called caretaker government government in
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:23.800]  other words appointed government then they sell off the properties so it's
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.880]  kind of in the plan the destruction well yeah that drives down the prices and
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.320]  it's all right there in the plan and they're announcing global private
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:36.040]  corporate government where they appoint your leaders in Italy in Greece they're
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:40.320]  moving towards that in Ireland they tried that in Iceland I want to ask you
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.440]  about I slowly get back on look at the war front internet censorship and calls

[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:49.920]  to Greg Palace this is big and I knew it was gonna upset the system because they
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:53.920]  hate the troops the foreign banks that have hijacked us use the troops use their
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:37:00.920]  heroism use their honor in these wicked wars that they're sent into because they
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:05.800]  believe they're defending America the fact that Ron Paul gets 71 to 75 depending
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:10.240]  on which month you look at it latest numbers are about 72 percent of all
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.200]  military donations for all Republican candidates and Obama combined that's on
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:19.840]  record Federal Elections Commission the fact that that's there really freaks out
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:25.240]  the system and Adam Kokesh had the idea and it looks like thousands are gonna
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.520]  show up to have active duty and veterans marks to the White House and they said
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:32.080]  they're gonna be peaceful and turn their back though on the commander in chief
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.400]  who's a traitor in chief and a globalist puppet the Benedict Arnold and
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.720]  this is to break the hoax that Ron Paul doesn't have support in fact if you show
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:44.040]  people the article that just went up at info wars.com it's got Ron Paul leaves
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:53.240]  in the Air Force leaked email military top brass worn troops off March for Ron
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:59.280]  Paul again leaked email military top brass worn troops off March for Ron Paul
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.200]  that's a good headline but that's a British writer we've gotten people may
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:06.560]  not get that classic English military top brass tell troops not to march with
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.480]  Ron Paul need to change that headline people are gonna get kind of old
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:15.600]  English leaked email military top brass tell troops not to march with Ron Paul
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:21.440]  or not to March for Ron Paul high importance message distributed by a
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:25.400]  senior naval security you get me no one here right now just just go ahead and
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:28.040]  call him in here now I'm gonna get this headline changed I'm kind of the editor
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:32.240]  in chief around here and an official editor I don't get myself like a title
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:36.760]  like CEO of info wars.com or galactic commander I don't actually have a title
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:42.200]  here I'm director of my operation though and most places you know editors go
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:46.360]  through three or four levels Kurt come on in this is great with what Steve did
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:49.400]  I want to send this to Drudge but people aren't gonna get kind of that old
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:53.840]  English leaked email military top brass worn troops off March for Ron Paul
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:57.280]  Americans aren't gonna get that on average so just saying let's say you
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:01.160]  know I got an English degree military top brass you know tell troops not to
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.480]  march with Ron Paul or not to March for Ron Paul don't you agree as info wars
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.160]  editor let's change that on both sides great job Steve Watson part of our total
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.400]  transparency program here okay going back to Greg Palace Greg what do you
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:20.080]  make of the media demonization of Ron Paul what do you make of this headlong
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.480]  march towards war why does the system want that what are you hearing from
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:29.440]  your inside sources well it's not so much that it's at the Paul that it is
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:35.120]  pro-billionaire you've got a billionaires behind Santorum behind
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:40.320]  Gingrich many billionaires the true billionaires club called restore our
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:46.520]  future behind Romney and of course behind Obama so basically it's the pro
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.440]  billionaire you get your choice I mean unlike Greece where they told you the
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.560]  banker that would be put in major president and or and in the prime
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:40:00.160]  minister of Italy here we get to choose our our billionaires choices and so
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:03.840]  that's what's going on they the billionaires have put their boys forward
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:07.280]  and in fact the vultures picked one of things they talk about is who are these
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.880]  guys you know that you know that they keep talking about the avalanche of
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:17.360]  money for Mitt Romney well where is that avalanche coming from Paul Singer Paul
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:20.240]  the vulture singer and I didn't give him the name vulture but that's what he's
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.640]  known Paul the vulture singer wrote a check for one million dollars that was
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:28.680]  just the beginning for Romney we have Bill Koch half a million dollar check
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.000]  that was the beginning of the money we have Paulson who earned four billion
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.640]  dollars not only betting but pushing the US mortgage market over a cliff and he
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:39.920]  made four billion dollars when the US housing market collapsed and he made
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:44.080]  sure it did he made sure it did made four billion dollars in here so he's
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.800]  tithed his million dollars to Romney I'm not picking on Romney in particular just
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.840]  that that seems to be where the billionaires right now are coalescing
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.720]  but they're on all the candidates including Obama but Obama has his
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:00.640]  believe me yeah I mean all this fake left right fighting between you know
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:05.200]  Al Gore's people and and and all the rest of it and Republicans you guys should
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:10.080]  all be at parties together I mean the very same foreign megabanks run both
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:15.600]  parties so you should I mean this fight is all just show to be you know let me
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.560]  ask you a question Alex who the hell is Barack Obama where did he come from out
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:24.600]  from outer space he just the most stellar state senator you've ever heard
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:28.320]  of that he suddenly goes from state Senate in two years to the to the Oval
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:32.760]  Office the answer is that he wrote some billionaire named Penny Pritzker who
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:40.000]  pulled him out of the Illinois Senate and and blessed him as you know as
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.240]  the future is their Democratic choice where there's a Republican choice and
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:49.200]  Democratic choice Pritzker had been removed as and personally fine personally
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:54.680]  fine $400 million for manipulating a bank on the south side of Chicago so what
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:59.880]  they have to do is now you and I if we had to pay $400 million that would be
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:03.320]  kind of harmful to our bank accounts I think Alex I think it might take a
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:10.160]  chunk out of you not for penny she's worth according to Forbes $2.7 billion
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:14.920]  so she decided rather than you shouldn't like paying $400 million fine so she
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:18.040]  decided to get someone who would change the rules so she wouldn't pay those
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:23.560]  fines same with the Cokes they're facing criminal charges let me ask you this
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:28.720]  question why is there or do you agree with the statement a giant exodus of
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:33.760]  the billionaires to armored retreats around the world why are they fleeing
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:39.640]  and hanging off helicopter skids like the fall of Saigon well you know like I
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:44.960]  said in Argentina and in Ecuador people went into the streets and they're
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:50.640]  angry and a lot of them were armed I'm not a big fan of arms and bombs but
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:54.280]  there's a lot of anger out there and there's been uprisings throughout the
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:59.280]  world that have been quite successful and so I think these you know it would be
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:03.120]  prudent if you had a billion bucks you'd want an escape route yourself but I
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:07.520]  think they're escape route at the moment is the is the 2012 election if they
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:12.280]  if they they're escape route is into the White House so to speak and it's not
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:17.120]  that Obama is not their guy but if they put somebody new in it'll take
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:21.400]  folks a while to figure out that this is another teleprompter reading puppet
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.320]  and so the they'll take some time for the paint you know the new paint to wear
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:30.640]  off yeah I mean in the case of for example you know what do these guys want
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:34.380]  for example the case of Romney what does a guy like Paulson want he's
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:37.840]  betting against the US economy so the last thing he wants he would go broke
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.040]  he's been shorting the US economy so he would he would be going broke if the
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:45.960]  economy recovered do we really want someone betting against the economy
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.400]  being the guy behind the president the United States the case well exactly I
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:54.080]  mean all these people that ran the government policies are making money and
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:58.680]  new to bet against us I mean they're just absolute traders and and and I want
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:01.920]  to make it clear what I said they bet it sounds like they're guessing which way
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.080]  the economy is going just riding on it's not like a it's a fixed roulette wheel
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:12.960]  when Paulson was facing the even under Bush was talking about restoring the
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:18.280]  the mortgage market and and Obama also talking about having a foreclosure
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:23.200]  moratorium Paulson went berserk and contacted his friends at Goldman Sachs
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:28.840]  which is his investment bank and what Paulson did was he basically threatened
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:32.800]  these guys and said you will not you know I've got a lot of money riding here
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:38.160]  and how dare you try to undo the you know the fall the of the housing market so
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:42.640]  when but around he says things like oh we should let it bar bottom out remember
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:47.960]  this is not a policy he's just speaking for the guy who's betting on the bottom
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:52.040]  on it bottoming out and falling through the bottom I mean understand the guy
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:57.600]  made Romney's backer made $4 billion in a single year betting against the
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:00.640]  housing market that's really important because we're not talking about policy
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:05.120]  here we're talking about billionaires setting the direction of the economy in
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.600]  the nation and both parties with all the major well look at Obama giving
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.320]  billions and billions to fake energy companies that never even made anything
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:17.320]  or tried to they would just rent an office building and literally no ones in
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:21.520]  it and they just keep the money I mean you give Obama a half million in one
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:27.800]  case and you get 500 million I mean that is a good vending machine I mean that's
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:32.400]  like sticking a quarter in and getting a thousand dollars back and you have to
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.200]  look when when we say that these companies get it it's the banks that
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:40.760]  guarantee them for example snuck into the emergency defense bill that we had
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.480]  for Iraq last year and I have this little thing in vultures picnic when we
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:50.200]  had the defense bill which was to provide vests you know the Kevlar a new
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:55.880]  Kevlar vests and special protection for the for the troop transport vehicles
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:01.880]  what's replaced the Humvees now no one voted against it I think maybe Ron
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:05.840]  Paul did but I mean almost no one voted against that emergency appropriation
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:11.000]  for the war in Iraq snuck into that bill was an eight billion dollar loan
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:18.080]  guarantee for four nuclear plants now exactly one that our boys and women
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:22.120]  in Iraq and Afghanistan suddenly need for their emergency protection for
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:25.760]  nuclear plants now this is not about whether nuclear power is good or bad
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:31.600]  it's about a deception we're told that we have to protect people from taking
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:38.440]  bullets and Humvees being blown up by IEDs and what it really is a cover for a
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:43.040]  massive payment not only to the nuclear industry have to understand because we're
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:47.960]  not going to build those nuclear plants it ain't going to happen it was Chase
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:57.120]  man JP Morgan Chase and Goldman and Citibank we're all we're all the guys
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:01.960]  lending this money with a government guarantee charging a massive interest and
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:05.680]  we have to pay for it we have to pay for it that's what's going on let me
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:08.440]  briefly ask us then we got to go to calls in this segment the next two
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:14.040]  short ones had a Bob Chapman joining us you talk about how it's a rigged bet and
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:19.240]  that's why Bob and others said that they think Corzine was ordered to make that
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:23.120]  bet and take the people's private money and give it to JP Morgan Chase who did
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:28.520]  get the 1.6 billion we've now confirmed and so that's why he's being protected
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:32.400]  a lot of Congress and say I don't know where it went because normally they
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:36.400]  don't make 41 bets unless they know it's rigged what's your inside skin you're
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:40.280]  probably the best guy to ask this do you know well all I know if I don't know
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:45.880]  the latest on MF global what I do know is that if you do in fact is now up on
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:48.840]  your side if you go to vultures picnic dot or a gene you'll see it in the book
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:52.280]  too is that there is a letter from Tim Geithner who is our Secretary of
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:58.440]  Treasury to Larry Summers who was the economic star under Obama this isn't an
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:03.160]  older letter it's highly highly confidential I did have it confirmed
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:08.080]  by the officials by that this confidential note which is basically a
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:15.640]  plan by by the US government to trade war against any government which
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:21.080]  refused to accept derivatives trading and toxic assets from JP Morgan and other
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:25.560]  major banks the important thing about this memo is why would they do this it
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:31.360]  said a Geithner is telling Summers you have to call our guys and he listed the
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:36.900]  five biggest most important bankers including John Corzine who was then
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:41.920]  CEO of Goldman Sachs remember before he's governor in New Jersey he was CEO of
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:46.680]  Goldman Sachs they well they don't move without calling these guys now think
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:50.320]  about that they were having all these secret meetings Goldman JP Morgan City
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:55.280]  Bank Bank of America these guys are having these secret meetings if Corzine
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:00.000]  they can't touch Corzine he would open up his files can you imagine the meetings
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.840]  that these guys have had about manipulating the economy including
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:08.040]  manipulating our foreign policy this was dangerous stuff we came to near blows
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:12.640]  near war with Ecuador and Brazil over this stuff that's my next question and
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:16.080]  we did show the document for prison planet TV viewers radio listeners can go
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:19.320]  to your site and see it right there vultures picnic org but but but just
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:22.200]  briefly here we're going to break I want to do two short segments of calls
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:27.120]  because I want at least get these five or six callers that are up front war how
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:31.640]  does that tie into it an internet censorship it looks like the establishment
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:36.120]  is openly moving with authoritarianism now they're not even having any pretense
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:41.400]  of freedom anymore why have things changed well I think that right now and
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:45.360]  you know war has always been a weapon it was I guess Thomas Friedman who is the
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:50.320]  globalization apologist said that the invisible hand of the marketplace needs
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:56.560]  a very strong fist inside that glove and and that that's what's going on here
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.920]  obviously they have to threaten there has to be some type of military threat
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:04.160]  when Ecuador threw out Occidental patrolling which is Al Gore's company
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.800]  remember we had to have some type of military threat behind behind that and
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:15.920]  we now see we we now see you know in the case I was just in Bosnia for example
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:19.960]  where you know obviously NATO troops were and basically the whole place has
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:25.440]  been looted by you know under the so-called guys of reforming their
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:29.960]  economy so war has some very profitable uses and no one's gone back to Bosnia
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:33.720]  said whatever happened that country the answer is if it it wasn't nailed down and
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:38.400]  even if it was it's been stolen and that was under the agreements that were set
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:43.600]  by our US State Department that they basically had to sell off everything in
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:47.560]  that country everything now the globalists are vampiric locust we're
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:50.760]  gonna be right back do two short segments of calls I promise won't write

[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:49.360]  1080 a.m. and he denied awareness of the NOAA national oceanic atmospheric
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:54.120]  administration and and international council for local environmental
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:57.560]  initiatives yeah yeah I know about the government run around harassing folks and
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:01.560]  not letting them even swim in the water and stuff all over North America but
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:05.440]  but I've got Greg Palestine you have a question for him yes I do I have a
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:12.280]  question for him with I'm a home phone caller for Ron Paul for president
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:19.840]  campaign and my question for Greg is with it's seeming to be critical mass
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:26.040]  right now where we're at and there the plan for really though takeover of the
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:33.800]  country what do you see as far as citizens peacefully assembling at city
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:44.000]  halls state capitals civic centers to in correlation with having a confirmed
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.400]  citizen count of delegate representation you know I hear you I
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:54.120]  appreciate your call that's a listen on ko my 1340 out of Santa Cruz a.m. I
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:58.200]  should have pointed out I he's bringing up how do we stop election fraud Greg
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:04.200]  ballast well you know the election fraud has been something I've been investigating a very very
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:08.600]  long time we don't have all our ballots counted in the United States it's an
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:12.440]  absolute scandal I'm the one who discovered that Kevin Harris and Jeb Bush
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:15.840]  knocked off thousands of black folks off the voter rolls calling them felons
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.000]  they weren't the one of the things is officially officially if you look at the
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:28.480]  election the U.S. election agency it records that we don't count about two
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:31.840]  and a half percent of the vote if that's the official that's it well but
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:36.240]  guys that's over two million votes presidential election I mean that's
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:41.120]  that's an awful lot of votes when when one and was decided by 357 votes not
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:43.880]  counting two million ballots serious that's ones that they tell you about
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:48.760]  mail in your ballot you know you're counting on people who don't want you to
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:52.600]  vote you know opening your envelope and counting your votes well they know most
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:56.000]  the military votes for Ron Paul so they always conveniently lose those as well
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.480]  well what happens if you have the stamp wrong you don't sign it it does a
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:06.520]  million million ways not to count a mail-in ballot a million ways to
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.160]  officially disqualify it then they got this new gimmick where you say well
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:14.840]  that you're not on the voter rolls you're not a proper voter so we're going
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:17.400]  to give you a provisional ballot and you think you voted well very few
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:21.360]  provisional ballots ever get counted they just chuck those out to make you feel
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:25.920]  good yeah yeah it's a pretend it's a placebo ballot and that was that's a
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:30.840]  newest gimmick you know that there were over like something like four million
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:34.160]  provisional ballots in last presidential election it's gonna be a lot higher this
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:37.560]  time and you know if they give you a placebo ballot don't accept it of course
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:41.440]  the frauds so bad they're probably all placebo ballots at this point well
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:45.080]  that's the other problem is that then then you have to those are the frauds I
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:49.760]  was able to investigate for BBC television find out about you know there's
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:53.640]  stuff I do I have yet to know about you know we did have the what's called
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:59.640]  caging where voters in where soldiers overseas in Iraq and elsewhere were sent
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:04.200]  letters to their home addresses when those letters came back as I said do not
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:08.160]  forward they challenged their right to vote saying that these are phony voters
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:11.560]  because they're not at their home address well there's a reason why
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:17.560]  soldiers are not at their home address is that correct oh you're being there
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:23.160]  there you're for al-qaeda now we're gonna be right back you're evil if you
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.280]  look if you don't like that if you want the troops couple to vote you're evil

[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:57.040]  began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:01.640]  that was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:05.000]  of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.400]  the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:14.240]  the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves

[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:54.120]  yourself the first is the question the question is the way China is loaning us
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:01:00.800]  a lot of it by buying our treasury bonds and buying into our debt general do you
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:04.840]  feel that perhaps they're doing that in fear that if they stop it the over
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:09.080]  investment in the United States that will you know attack one of our own
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:12.280]  ships or attack one of our own bases more than that they know their own their
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:17.160]  only big market is gonna collapse and yes and now the main military thrust has
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:21.240]  been to mass ships all around and troops in our own Pentagon says they're
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:25.480]  growing up plans to attack China and the Chinese president said last month

[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:08.240]  for our guest Richard in Texas a lot of calls from Texas today go ahead
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:13.360]  how you doing there mr. Jones thank you for taking my call yes sir one reason
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:17.600]  why you're so successful is because you're willing to offer very constructive
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.600]  criticism so my construction instructive criticism I want to see if mr. Palace
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:27.120]  agrees with this we should start telling our military especially the active ones
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:32.160]  overseas they saw exactly what that government saw they know this is a
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:35.880]  crime they're living with these nightmares of what's going on over there in
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:40.080]  the battlefield so it's time to start telling them to do what Michael New did
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:46.440]  what Tim and did what Lieutenant Colonel Acons did and start standing down not
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:51.200]  take these orders just come home and take whatever you know these they're gonna
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:55.920]  get they may have to go to Levenworth for a couple of months whatever but it's
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:01.240]  better than repeating the crime of going back overseas until I just got to
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:05.760]  running back to fall they're going back and forth destroying these countries
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.640]  just for the globalist the profit and bring us bring us into this new world
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:14.840]  order so it's time to start telling our troops specifically to do exactly what
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:19.360]  Michael knew and then they've got a great point sir stay there I might come

[02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:22.160]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:26.400]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:30.160]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:34.280]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:42.920]  Alex Jones okay info wars dot com is reporting with a leaked navy memo that
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:48.120]  they're telling members of the military do not go to the Ron Paul Tribs for Ron
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:52.880]  Paul rally even if you're off-duty you don't have free speech in America now
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:57.880]  their regulations say you go to rallies just don't speak and don't don't do it
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:04.160]  in your uniform but military top brass tell troops not to march in Ron Paul
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:12.640]  rally high importance message distributed by senior navy official and we have
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:16.280]  that information at info wars dot com now I'm going to Bob Chapman here in a
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:20.000]  moment and then everybody else that's patiently holding with Bob because we're
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.680]  gonna have open phones for Bob the day of the international forecaster dot com
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:32.880]  but expanding on this here we were talking to Richard in Texas and Richard
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:36.600]  was just calling any of you misting and was saying look it's time for the
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:39.960]  military to stand down and say no well they take the troops and they put them
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:44.240]  in this peer pressure and then they do carry out you know orders that are
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:47.840]  unconstitutional they do carry out things that violate their oath and they
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:51.920]  do it all the time like troops being ordered to grow opium in Afghanistan I
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:56.640]  saw a new meme on the internet saying I'm a liar about that even though it's on
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:04.400]  NBC news ABC news nightly news BBC Fox news CNN I mean it's tight troops guarding
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:07.760]  and growing opium in Afghanistan and they're on the news saying we don't like
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:12.200]  it but if we don't al-Qaeda gets it so we grow it and then it shipped out and
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:15.960]  people like that's not true how dare you say the troops are drug dealers no
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:18.840]  that's like when I say they were bombs in the World Trade Center they say
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:23.400]  you're saying the fire department didn't not ever said that these are fake memes
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:28.880]  they put out the point is this is going on this is happening these wars are
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:32.040]  illegal the drones flying into countries and killing people without a
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:35.720]  declaration of war it's all illegal now they're gonna use the drones against us
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:40.440]  the government spying on us without warrants is illegal a world government
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:46.560]  is setting up a planetary dictatorship right now it's all out in the open our
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:50.000]  freedoms are being eradicated they're saying the military is going to be used
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:55.880]  against us that's treason the Roman Senate knew that 2000 plus years ago do
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:11:01.640]  we know that now this is classical oppression and the caller was saying
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:05.200]  it's time for the troops that'd be a good discussion sometime for the troops
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:08.000]  what order would you not follow I mean since there's no Bill of Rights a
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.200]  Constitution it's effectively being trampled the system's just getting around
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:15.880]  to now exercising their criminal authority their power they are a power
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:20.000]  but it's illegitimate when a serial killer has you tied up there the power
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  they are a power that's a famous line from the cinema movie but it's actually
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:31.040]  what was said at the trial the king of England wouldn't they were trying for
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:35.960]  treason for waging war against the population they asked him they said
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:41.640]  you know you don't recognize this court he says I recognize it as a power but
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:45.520]  not as having jurisdiction over me I recognize you as a power and that's
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:48.800]  really what all of this just comes down to foreign banks came in illegitimately
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:53.800]  they took over they're a foreign power they're openly ridiculously criminal they
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:58.200]  admit their dictatorial because they have to now they're just going okay it is
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:01.920]  world government we are dictatorial do what we say or will implode the economy
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:08.000]  and you do what they say and they implode it further it's bravada
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.080]  hutzpah whatever you want to call it fueled megalomania and a lot of times
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:16.800]  it works because other people just say well they're so confident they must be
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:21.000]  the boss so I want to ask that caller that question Richard are you former
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.840]  military yes sir I was out at Berksham during the 80s when the Ronald Reagan
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:29.760]  the Honorable Haasenstein kicked off and every day when they had on the news the
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:33.080]  next day I'd come back and try to discuss it in uniform with the captains
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:37.200]  and everybody in office I was in supply so it was always a full office and
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:40.560]  everybody was telling me then hey you can't talk about that kind of stuff
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:44.840]  you're in the military but I would continue to talk about it I never got
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:50.640]  kicked out but now when 91 came up and I started seeing Dick Cady and Rumsfield
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:53.880]  and all the rest of those criminals on TV talking about we got a new enemy now
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:57.200]  we don't really know what he looks like we don't know what we think they're
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:00.720]  coming from the Middle East blah blah blah I start telling everybody because
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:06.080]  it wasn't hard to see they've been to kick off a full French war and 21 years
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:12.360]  later after Doug Roque you Joyce Ryan everybody's been telling everybody who's
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:16.400]  gone over there said hey you're gonna get sick you're gonna kill a lot of
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.840]  innocent people don't go don't do it and look where we're at so if the military
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:26.400]  aren't getting the message yet it's a lose lose lose you're not gonna get
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:31.720]  your death penalty your death penalty you're not gonna get your babies aren't
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:35.720]  gonna be healthy you're not ever gonna get the nightmares out of your head so
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:40.280]  your minds will stand up now demand the arrest of those generals like April
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:45.800]  Duncan did April glass with her April Gallup yes that's all you got to do they
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:51.600]  can't put everybody in prison you know I understand what the gentleman just left
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:59.920]  there mr. palace just the palace but if the military men stood up don't rely on
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:04.200]  the women they shouldn't be over anyway if they just sit up and sit down we
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:09.800]  wouldn't be going through this mess period and that's the issue what if the
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:15.760]  Germans wouldn't have followed the orders to attack Poland or or or France
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:20.720]  what if that wouldn't have happened well 20 million Germans 21 million Germans
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:25.600]  would have died 21 million Germany was only like 65 million people mainline
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:30.760]  history says 20 million what is 20 million out of 60 something million that
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:35.960]  that's a third I mean that was the cost because the men up front wouldn't say
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:42.360]  no Hitler got elected as a junior member of the of the parliament he got
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:47.280]  elected running a coalition of like 34% and nobody stood up to him same thing
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:51.040]  with the communists same thing and we I mean we know what this looks like we
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:55.720]  know that the that the crazy drive of these elites will lead them and us to
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:00.720]  destruction and I'm telling you America I'm telling you the crimes of the people
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:03.960]  that run our country when it's all said and done if we beat them and it all comes
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:07.480]  out I can tell you it's bigger than Hitler it's bigger than Stalin it's
[02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:11.320]  bigger than Mao they are the new world order through the US is killing people
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:15.000]  everywhere they got covert wars going on all over the place the big new
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:20.360]  Brzezinski is so evil that in two books you can pull the quotes up online just
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:24.680]  say type in the Brigadier Brzezinski brags about funding pull pot and mass
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:29.520]  death and he says it's really a wonderful thing that I can say that pull pot
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:34.880]  defeated communism yeah he did kill you know a large part of his population but
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:40.440]  that's okay because we didn't do it we just helped him do it and see I've
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:42.880]  learned I appreciate your call sir these globalists I want to talk to Bob
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:45.920]  Chapman about this right now they have these weird rules where they do it
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:50.440]  through committees they all share responsibility like you know like buying
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:54.600]  insurance or something where no one really ever fully puts all the pieces
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:58.600]  together where they can kind of deny and well I funded somebody else that did it
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:01.880]  you know people say well won't the new order kill you like Steve Pacenek who's
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:06.160]  a you know the guy that brings down major governments in the past I mean talk
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:11.240]  about a real spy master you know psych warfare guy he'll tell you it's an inside
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:15.560]  job but but he'll say Alex don't worry about him killing you you know it's too
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:19.520]  much paperwork because big guys up top don't like start to kill Americans
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:23.160]  because that can then be used to blackmail them later people like Bill
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:27.240]  Gates and all that just do it through oh here's what this corn does and then
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:31.880]  it's got a back door and then they can deny it later what do you call that
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:37.160]  system the globalist engage in where they kind of have overlapping fields of
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:40.840]  deniability plausible deniability what do you call it Bob Chapman you were in
[02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:44.800]  intelligence you know the biggest financial newsletter for decades out
[02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:47.840]  there you've been around the world you were fighting the new order 50 years
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:51.640]  ago what do you do you agree with my statement and what do you call that
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:17:00.240]  globalist mindset well first of all the globalist mindset is what it is the
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:05.560]  council in relation to trial out of commission to Bilderberg is etc but as
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:12.920]  far as in in the intelligence operations of of different covers for
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:20.480]  different things they've been doing that for many years at the how regimes that
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:26.920]  are replaced or overthrown are dealt with is when you have a committee they
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:33.800]  say well we didn't know that was going to be the result and so we did it
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:38.200]  collectively and the answer to that very simply is good all of you line up
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:44.800]  against the wall I mean that's the way you solve it but the deniability factor
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:51.560]  is always there they've always got some kind of cover some beard going on where
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:56.800]  they can do that and those things were explained to me a long time ago and it's
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:18:01.000]  one of the things that didn't fit with me and that's why I didn't continue to
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:07.960]  work with them I realized then how evil they were but do you agree with me that
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:12.200]  that they've gone megalomaniacal they're off that they're insane I mean they've
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:19.480]  got a plan always been that way Alex believe me just as crazy I mean look
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:24.880]  at all the operations paperclip things like that normal people don't do those
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:31.360]  kind of things taking some of the wickedest people in the world and involving
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:35.440]  them in your counterintelligence operations and your government you're
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:39.200]  taking advice for them and then you will arrange for them to live happily ever
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:42.200]  after and then you hire the former head of the Stasi to set up homeland
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:48.920]  security that's right and he was the first one it should have got hung he's
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:53.400]  responsible for the death of thousands of people seventy percent of the people
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:19:00.320]  in eastern Jeremy was spying on each other I know I used to spy on them well
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:05.080]  people better just start however they can whether it's quietly or openly better
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:10.800]  start resisting this system because if it comes in boy I tell you can you feel
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:19.440]  it though Bob not just intellectually but can you feel like the tremors I feel
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:27.840]  the tremors more with the military which is so positive than in any other area
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:34.880]  70% of the people in the military of for Ron Paul I mean doesn't that tell you
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:39.880]  where they're coming from doesn't that scare the new world order oh if they
[02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:44.480]  can't tell them go over there and pick all those people up and put them in a
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:49.040]  truck and take them to that camp over there they're not gonna do it it's an
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:55.960]  illegal order and then you're faced with as the military and I'm not talking
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:59.120]  about stay there stay there gotta break Bob tell us on the other side we'll get
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:03.120]  into economy phone calls and more stay with us a little over a year ago I
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:07.320]  began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal
[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:11.400]  that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:14.960]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:18.960]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:23.720]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild

[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:13.600]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the GCM radio network
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:29.400]  I need to get more into the news here with Bob Chapman he was making a point
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:31.440]  about the military as we went to break
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:37.080]  terror suspect arrested near US Capitol police say a terrorism suspect has been
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:40.760]  arrested in FBI sting operation in the US Capitol while planning to detonate
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:44.440]  what he thought were explosives they've had like a hundred plus cases of this
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:47.880]  the last five years when they set up the mentally ill patsy who's out of prison
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:52.000]  and thinks he's recruited by the jihad and I'm glad the feds are doing this instead
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.920]  of doing another Oklahoma City or so but I mean I'm not glad that being
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:00.120]  sarcastic but it's better than them doing big actual attacks US Capitol police
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:05.040]  say their offices and FBI officers officials arrested the man Friday in a
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:10.200]  sting operation this is all in the heels of hearing that Iran is gonna attack the
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:13.720]  US we need to go ahead and attack them and you've got clapper the head of the
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:19.440]  national security the head advisor saying we need a provocation and all the
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.640]  troops massing this is this is really creepy but the finish what you were
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:30.000]  saying Bob Shannon well I think in the final analysis once given illegal
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:37.440]  orders what's going to happen is that the the military is finally gonna say
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:42.840]  no one are gonna do that and then that's time for a coup and that's the way I
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:46.680]  think it's gonna come about because people have just found out with the
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:51.240]  Republican primaries that there are no elections they are what they want them to
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:59.280]  be they're all rigged I mean so outrageously that a 10-year-old can
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:05.920]  identify the rigging it's it's it's incredible and so if we can't get wrong
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:12.240]  or on Paul in legally I think that's what's going to happen well undoubtedly
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:15.840]  we're entering one of those phases like right before World War one or World War
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:20.880]  two I mean there's no doubt all of this recession depression all these little
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:24.200]  wars they're not a little of your in them but they're little overall
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:30.200]  historically it's all hurtling towards massive collision and the Pakistanis
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:35.240]  with their hundred nukes are lining up with the Russians and the Chinese the
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:39.840]  Russians are threatening the Chinese are threatening military action the West is
[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:43.320]  putting Al Qaeda forces into Syria so the Pentagon got caught some other saying
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:47.960]  yes we want to warn Al Qaeda is infiltrating the opposition in Syria
[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:52.760]  that's they can have their cake and eat it too I just think the globalists are
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:56.440]  hiding in two plane of view of people that are actually thinking out there
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:00.920]  sure the average dumbed-down citizen can't find their feet can't find their
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:04.680]  hands in broad daylight but those people don't count they're gonna suck their
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:08.920]  thumbs regardless the thinkers now finally understand that we've got
[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:15.680]  terrorists running the government and they were now in serious trouble and
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:22.960]  they're identifying that finally you know long ago on this program you said
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:29.080]  they're fearful the enemy and the reason is that we're breathing down their
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:34.640]  collars and we talked about Brzezinski at that program by the way just came out
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:37.800]  with a new book he just came up with a new book and and said one of the big
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:45.160]  things facing the elite is the worldwide awakening to them they're in serious
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:50.320]  trouble and we're gonna make it much worse for them well that's the issue is
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:54.080]  we need to understand folks it's all a confidence game with these people the
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:58.760]  fact that 70 plus percent of the military donates to Ron Paul and not the
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:02.880]  other people despite all the tactics they've used that means when the global
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:08.280]  is pull a false flag in the future are other things it's not gonna have as good
[02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:12.040]  an effect to get everybody in line as it did before and then the next time it's
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:15.520]  not gonna work at all they're running out of bullets they're running out of
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:18.800]  propaganda they're running out of credibility people don't believe
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:22.880]  anything they say anymore but they still are going ahead like they're in
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:27.760]  control Bob and you know people in special operations are questioning the
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:33.080]  orders now you know you remember you heard the commentary from Jesse Ventura
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:37.480]  the things he used to say to his fellow sales look this is wrong blah blah blah
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:44.520]  and so what happened they're starting up again whole units are discussing the
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:49.880]  problem I mean you know we're supposed to defend America but how are we
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:55.360]  defending America guarding Poppy feels well this the seals now know that they
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:58.960]  were put on that helicopter to get rid of the rest of seal team six and blew it
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:05.080]  up and so so they got upset so the so the brass came in special operations and
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:09.880]  said oh maybe al-Qaeda got a bomb on the helicopter and they're like you never
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:13.800]  cram us on an old National Guard helicopter turned out the story they
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:19.680]  were going to save people wasn't true I mean they just killed them I mean that's
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:25.600]  right and this is the kind of people you're dealing with and the people in
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:30.720]  the military need intelligence from us probably more than anybody else and
[02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:35.400]  that's why I've been doing the Marine Disquisition for eight years and I'll
[02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:43.320]  tell you I love doing it I'm a veteran and I'm giving a little bit back well
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:48.480]  it's all you know even run out of the United States we'll be right back with

[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:22.680]  news and we've got Kurt Haskell one of survivors the underwear bomber who did in
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:26.840]  his victim statement exposed that it was a government operation and that the
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:30.600]  pats either been threatened with his family like we've known they've done or
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:34.560]  is a mentally ill crazy he confirmed the government got him on the plane they
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:38.000]  had to admit that on C-span and congressional testimony again a month
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:42.880]  and a half after we had him on that's big news the Detroit papers carried it
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:47.640]  AP carried it but it never made a big national story it was there under
[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:51.720]  Secretary of State said yes we were ordered to get him on the plane and give
[02:34:51.720 --> 02:34:57.960]  him a visa and all this stuff by an unnamed US agency and just like they
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:00.960]  cooked the bomb trained the driver gave him the detonators in the first World
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:05.280]  Trade Center attack and both men were on welfare one was retarded the other was
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:12.320]  mildly retarded one had like a 80 IQ they were like a 72 and I mean I could go
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:16.320]  out in Austin and find a mentally ill or brain damaged homeless person or
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:19.440]  somebody kicked out of the state hospital they're everywhere see them
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:23.760]  talking to themselves very sad sometimes I do give money to people they're
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:26.520]  absolutely schizophrenics I don't give money to people just trying to get money
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:29.840]  they're panhandling but when you see some guy with one leg who's completely you
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:33.400]  know out of their mind and you could see feces running down the backs of their
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:39.480]  legs in 110 degree heat and they're going water water water yeah this is not an
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:43.080]  Academy Award-winning actor this is a completely crazy person I've given them
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:49.360]  50 bucks but that's a side issue I'm now digressing the point is is that's the
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:52.440]  type I mean I could go out today hypothetically I would never know the
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:55.960]  news Jones plan to hire homeless for terrorism I could go out and find a
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:00.080]  mentally disturbed person and in them in a matter of hours probably but
[02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:04.280]  undoubtedly in a few weeks give them money give them stuff they did that with
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:08.000]  a young group of black rastafarians most of them were homeless some of them were
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  mentally handicapped in in Florida remember back in 2006 they were gonna
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.920]  wait wage jihad they were actually Christians and it took the FBI a year
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:21.360]  to give them a big house money hundreds of thousands of dollars so we want you
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:24.880]  to dress them camo I want you to say you're a jihadist here's another ten
[02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:28.840]  grand they said we'll give us more pot and then they busted them all send them
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:32.960]  all away just get them to say yeah I'm gonna blow up the Capitol yeah I'm gonna
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:38.600]  to create the simulation of the terror threat to take your rights but it's a
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:42.360]  lot better than what they did on 9-11 or Oklahoma City so I mean sin and Patsy's
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:47.200]  the jail's bad but I want to thank the feds which I'm being sarcastic for not
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:49.480]  doing the big events they're not doing the big events because they know we're
[02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:53.920]  watching they're going with the Patsy event but we brought this up to Kirk
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:57.200]  Haskell we'll get into talk about when he's on with this Sunday I'll be live on

[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:50.640]  up to Haskell and we'll talk to him about it Sunday and he said no I don't
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:53.960]  think I'll sue the government he still may because they're won't it's just all
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:57.480]  gonna be collapsed so I won't even be courts pretty much then and I say well
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:00.960]  and Rob do is like why because I sent Rob do up there to interview him just two
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:09.120]  days ago he was in Michigan ahead of this ruling and he said we'll read this
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:14.600]  San Antonio Express news article so we've got it and it says the two serve as
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:17.720]  co-chairs the National Commission of fiscal responsibility and reform and
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:21.520]  18 member bipartisan group created last year by President Obama the commission
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:25.240]  has warned that if the US doesn't do something about its deficit spending it
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:30.760]  will become a second rate power well but the banks want us to be in debt so
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:34.560]  they're going to they're going to bankrupt the country Simpson said the
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:39.520]  US owes 15 trillion yet to the bankers almost seven times the deficit in Italy
[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:44.040]  which currently is the crisis because it owes 2.6 trillion which is banker
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:47.120]  fraud and then it goes on to say Simpson said the Commission members
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:50.800]  differed on when they thought the tipping point might come but no one thought
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:58.000]  it would be more than two years away this is from December 14th 2011 so this
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.880]  is a year ago more than a year ago and Haskell saying he's read this whole
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:07.080]  government commission which says we're going to completely collapse basically
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:13.240]  well yeah they're getting ready for that Bob Chapman what's your take on that
[02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:18.480]  well you know I think over and over again you know we get the same results the
[02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:25.400]  same take on things will a court system be there am I going to get justice
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:31.440]  there's a lot of factors and it causes people to back off to go against the
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:38.680]  government I recently recently saw a company that wanted to go after the
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:43.680]  government in regard to naked shooting in the market and some of the best
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:47.080]  attorneys in in the country said don't do it you're not going to get any
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:53.720]  justice and will you ever get the court so it's the same thing and that's how
[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:58.640]  societies collapse is because the criminals show they can engage in any
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:02.680]  crime and and now they're just saying you can all over the country you can't
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:06.240]  have your own well water where you're like but I have a land right going back
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:09.520]  a hundred years I you know I have a water right they're just like doesn't
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:13.960]  matter we're sending police maybe you're like but the law they're like take it to
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:18.280]  our court that water belongs to whatever new water bearing just took over I mean
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:22.440]  it's just like that's the way it is and our ancestors once of the same stuff on
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:26.960]  water rights and used to have to you know have rush wars I'm not saying it
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:29.560]  should go to that but I mean the crooks are going to come in and tell you that
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:33.480]  you're their slave and if you bend over and kiss their ring they're gonna they're
[02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:35.880]  gonna do it
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.800]  they'll get away with anything they can get away with and the people are
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:48.640]  watching and listening you know in total and so they don't do what they should do
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:55.440]  they don't respond when they should they just say well gee it's this that and the
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:00.000]  other thing of the government and I can't contend with it so forget it there's a
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:05.280]  lot of apathy out there but it's caused by ignorance and every society's got the
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:11.480]  same problem now and in history it's nothing new
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:17.400]  well you're right you're right about that I want to hit a few headlines and
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:22.600]  get your take on it CBO US News and World Report longest period of high
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:27.260]  unemployment since Great Depression worst housing slump since Great
[02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:33.880]  Depression worse the the amount of debt privately is worse ratio than Great
[02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:40.400]  Depression insider document details a March 23rd Greek default plan government
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:44.000]  to freeze bank accounts you talked to me over a year ago about your State
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.240]  Department sources saying that was coming and this is actually in the great
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:55.880]  news but on the news here give us your take on a bank holiday this is not the
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:00.920]  type of holiday you want to go on folks what that means Bob well I mean is it
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:07.360]  gonna shut down the banking system are we referring just a grease here yeah
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:14.440]  they're saying grace yeah yeah I think that's natural they're not being going
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:21.280]  to be able to in a few me weeks meet their obligation to pay the interest in
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:26.400]  the latest bonds that have to be paid for and I think that'll start the ball
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:31.480]  rolling evidence is coming out that the thing was to set up in the first place
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:36.000]  and you know that's really interesting because I've been on the program for you
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.640]  with you discussing this for the last several months and I said you know I'm
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:44.240]  not on the inside and I don't know what they're doing but I got to leave the end
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:51.240]  open with the Germans because it looks like they don't want the Euro they
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:56.280]  don't want the European Union they want to go it on their own and I'm wondering
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:05.720]  whether they're doing this in concert with the US and England and Finland
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:12.560]  and the Netherlands and as it turns out with these great smear of propaganda
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:17.840]  that's going on here over the last week that's exactly what Germany
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:23.040]  shooting for they want to be the big power in Europe again all right Bob I
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:27.800]  want to go to calls here in a moment and and but but I've got to make an
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:31.880]  announcement here there's so much censorship going on on Google and it's
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:37.600]  it's sub company YouTube and all these systems that operate as supposed
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:41.360]  commons and they're announcing censorship all over the world Google and
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:46.120]  others are working with governments but I've got to point this out they are
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:53.320]  using the claim and I want to ask you about it of deleting user accounts that
[02:43:53.320 --> 02:44:00.040]  aren't active to get rid of people's subscribers but I've confirmed that
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:03.480]  people that even recently signed up are being kicked off one of my YouTube
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:10.480]  channels that has hundreds of millions of views and that now I've just kept
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:13.600]  noticed the last two weeks since they announced their new privacy policy which
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:18.280]  is no privacy that when I search one of our headlines to see how many views it's
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:24.240]  gotten it does not show up but it will show up on other people's channels I
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:28.960]  mean completely delisted with many of our headlines within the YouTube system
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:37.120]  and here it is just during the last break I put in my headline the young
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:42.400]  Turks caught lying to viewers a video I shot last night and they're a partner
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:47.360]  channel will then work for Al Gore I put that in and hit enter to see what the
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:51.520]  latest view count is because I learned years ago if you want to see what the
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:56.160]  real view count is before it's updated you can you know it might say 301 views
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:44:59.680]  for it caches that's how the servers work for a day or so but you can put in
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:03.040]  the headline and sometimes in the main front listing it'll show you a newer
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:06.880]  number like it'll say 301 viewers on a video I've done and I a few hours later
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:10.160]  put it in it says 100,000 views when I put it in the search function so I'm
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:14.240]  gonna show TV viewers this but if you if you go to my YouTube channel our big
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:17.920]  one the one the 177 million views or 178 million views that's linked on
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:22.080]  info wars.com you'll see one of the videos over on the side is the young
[02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:26.560]  Turks caught lying to viewers Bob and you put that in the main YouTube search
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:30.000]  bar up at the top everybody can see that and I'll search it again for people
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:40.800]  watching and you hit enter you get somebody else's site the tech buy tiggs
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:45.840]  and it says zero views this just got uploaded the young Turks caught lying
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:49.840]  now this is in a general search this is their general main search but you go to
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:57.520]  the filter and you can do a view count obviously that that title under my life
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:01.440]  the highest view count because it's got you know a whole bunch of views it does
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:06.160]  not show up I went through page it does not show up in the search and I did a
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:14.640]  bunch of other searches Bob upload date all of it and there it is everybody
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:20.720]  else's versions but not mine so it always showed up off of whatever had the
[02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:24.000]  most views was at the top just like Obama deception showed up you know with
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:28.240]  10 million views or whatever at the top it's now being delisted we are it is
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:31.840]  here and I've got to get Watson and others to do an analysis because I'm
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:35.840]  about to go out of town and stuff but Bob I mean it's happening and they've
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:40.080]  obviously delisted my stuff from searchability or they drive it way down
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:42.400]  the page I guess I've got to go a hundred deep to see if it's if it's
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:46.880]  anywhere there so so it's no longer but just with my videos I then tested
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:51.680]  during the break other new videos and it was whatever had the highest views at
[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:54.560]  the top so Bob the only reason people are going to be able to see stuff when
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:47:00.640]  they search it now is because other people have copied my video over to
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:05.840]  their channel can you believe that Bob I mean they are and again there's so many
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:09.760]  other ways they're doing it it make your your head spin Bob Twitter's announcing
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:12.480]  they're gonna work with governments Google has said if government sends them
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:15.360]  a notice saying something's critical of government and request it be taken down
[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:20.160]  they're now doing it I mean this is in I guess they know we're just defeating them
[02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:23.920]  Bob and I think you're absolutely right but you're
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:32.480]  right about the takedown I don't do anything with
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:37.200]  my own my own programs other people post them and they post them all over the
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:41.680]  place and I think that's great not even who they are and I don't care
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:45.920]  but I get reports back all the time well you're not up there and you're not up
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:50.720]  here and you they just take them down and so people go back and they post them
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:55.680]  again but the point is they are doing it oh let me tell you what's happening
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:59.520]  I'll post a video and we get 30,000 views we post so many
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:02.640]  some little channel posted gets a hundred thousand that's because they
[02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:06.640]  haven't put the block on them they're suppressing our numbers
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:10.960]  and but it doesn't matter we're just spreading everywhere Bob
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:16.480]  like a big disease for them well officially folks this is a hundred
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:20.560]  percent proof right here this is a hunt and they say oh Alex
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:23.360]  they're they're getting rid of all the old subs no no no I know
[02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:26.640]  people personally who just set up channels a week ago that were deleted
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:30.000]  and we're putting videos on them people a month ago that subscribed to me that
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.320]  were kicked off and people that are subscribers
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:35.840]  almost all of them are not having my videos sent to them
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:39.600]  I mean if I can get a quarter million subscribers on one channel
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:42.960]  then I should every video should get a quarter million views or more that's
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:46.880]  guaranteed total viral look at this I'm not even I get people
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:50.000]  saying what do you mean that's I don't know let me show you folks here's my
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  channel okay young turks caught lying to
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:57.840]  viewers here's my version and again it hasn't really
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:00.800]  updated yet so just a six thousand views I did this at about 10 o'clock last
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:03.360]  night you six is about a day to really update when
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:06.720]  finally updates later probably say about 30,000 views and 100,000 later but the
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:09.600]  point is is that young turks caught lying to
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:13.600]  viewers and I counter them attacking me and lying about me
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:19.200]  and then now I copy this headline thinking I'll see what you know the latest
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:22.000]  you know views actually are this is a trick I learned
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:28.400]  I do it boom until two weeks ago it would always be my
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:31.840]  video because I originated it and my video always has the most views as my
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:35.040]  version at least up front no it's some other guy
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:39.600]  who copied my video over which is great please do with 199 views
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:44.400]  that just went up a couple hours ago that's the one that's searchable oh I
[02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:49.040]  see why because it's got an ad on it see I don't take ads because then they can
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:52.160]  try to censor me more I don't take the google ads
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:55.840]  okay now I'm seeing so they don't let my video be seen now
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:59.520]  they're doing it for people that are partners there you go Bob boom proof for
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:04.240]  everybody right there Bob absolutely I mean this is insane
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:08.000]  hey listen my own articles from info wars and we've had companies search
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:12.080]  engine experts look our system set right google is now driving most of the
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:15.440]  info wars things down to like 10 pages down when we used to be
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:18.240]  number one they're now giving other people the
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:22.080]  results for alex jones people that attack me they've got a team in there
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:25.760]  I mean here's that they won't give us a partner channel
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:29.840]  Bob and then the young Turks the work for Al Gore publicly
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:33.360]  came out and said that I don't have a big audience you know that I'm basically a
[02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:38.240]  joke and so I showed on alexa ratings how they don't even show up on the graph
[02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:42.560]  for web traffic versus and how I'm like you know hundreds of times above them
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:46.080]  and I said so they took a strong man and showed one youtube channel of mine and
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:49.360]  said oh look art one channel is bigger than his one channel and said I'm a
[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:54.160]  liar what do you think of that Bob that's exactly what you can expect from
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:56.960]  those people and now I can't even get my video
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:51:00.480]  out to show they're lying about me because they work for the filthy scum
[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:04.000]  Al Gore I had tried everything I'd cut back the
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:07.600]  amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing

[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:22.160]  stuff down when the government asked we put a video up expose the tsa
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:26.160]  they blocked it so it couldn't go viral we show a helicopter killing people

[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.880]  want put them everywhere in game freaks them out so much
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:03.600]  some company doesn't even have the copyright to it is blocking it saying
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:06.240]  it's theirs and now they're trying to people trying to
[02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:09.360]  say my voice is theirs i mean there's gonna come a time where you can't even
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:11.200]  hear my voice folks on the web i'm telling you
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:14.640]  you better spread the word about info wars.com
[02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:17.920]  in fact we would be overall losing traffic right now because of google
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:21.280]  changing stuff and going after as if it wasn't for the drudge report
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:24.960]  the drudge report is is really the biggest thing helping us reach people
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:28.480]  except for you the audience spread the word i mean i'm putting everything i
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:31.040]  can into this i just want to warn people that's my goal
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:35.200]  that's when i'm after and they are coming after us and they can silence me
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:38.240]  they're going to silence you next you got to stand with us folks you've got to
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:41.200]  get the word out about info wars.com and presbyter.com
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:45.600]  you got to spread the links to our youtube videos on the alex jones channel
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:49.440]  and the other channels post them to your site make variants
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:53.840]  upload them don't put my name in them some of the time put my name in other
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:56.800]  time i've noticed that that gets around them
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:00.000]  bob Chapman i know i'm ranting and i said i'd go to calls it's just this is a
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:03.440]  big deal bob it certainly is
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:08.160]  because you know if we're shut out it's over
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:11.760]  i mean we got the live broadcast and other things but
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:14.480]  they're going to come after that next ability to reach a lot of people is
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:19.600]  going to be taken down well this is the selective kill switch
[02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:23.360]  obama talked about i mean look at look at google giving
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:26.880]  all the money i mean look i went and had reporters get in the face
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:31.280]  of that you know the head of google schmidt and bill deberg last year
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:34.640]  i mean do you think they liked it in hundreds of newspapers in our video
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:38.240]  being number one on google and getting millions of views and then they did some
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:40.480]  blocker on that and it suddenly shut down
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:44.400]  but the video was up but it couldn't get it didn't go viral anymore
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:47.120]  see all the time it used to stuff used to pop up on the front page and have more
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:50.640]  views than everybody and somebody would see it and just remove it you'll take
[02:57:50.640 --> 02:57:54.320]  out the front page now they just delisted bob
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:58.320]  i mean you gotta look but it shows we're hurting him this is a great victory
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:02.960]  they wouldn't be doing this bob if we weren't having an effect
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:08.000]  yeah but we gotta keep after them we gotta find ways around it
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:13.680]  folks go see it for yourself and i'm so sick of the denials
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:17.360]  out there let me explain it's not just that they're knocking our subscribers
[02:58:17.360 --> 02:58:21.040]  off of course they made the announcement that's their cover for all this
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:24.880]  it's that people who are subscribers can't most of them can't get the videos
[02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:28.400]  but they get all the partner crud or a cat playing with a
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:32.160]  french bulldog because they don't want you to know
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:35.600]  that they're sodium fluoride in the water they don't want you to know
[02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:52.560]  i'll be back sunday four to six p.m central and i'll see you in dallas
