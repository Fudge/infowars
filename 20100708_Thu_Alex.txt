[00:00.000 --> 00:14.580]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.580 --> 00:28.200]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it's Thursday July 8th 2010
[00:28.200 --> 00:37.000]  we're gonna be live here for the next four hours joining us is icon David Ike to give us his
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.680]  take on global governments move to abolish borders and national sovereignty worldwide with
[00:44.680 --> 00:51.760]  illegal immigration I'll also give us his unique take on the oil spill and of course the open
[00:51.760 --> 00:56.960]  announcements of devaluing the dollar and world government now being out in the open David Ike
[00:56.960 --> 01:02.680]  love him or hate him he's always intriguing and informative and we appreciate him joining us in
[01:02.680 --> 01:09.200]  the third hour today sheriff Richard Mack hadn't had him on in about a year Mack told the New York
[01:09.200 --> 01:15.320]  Times that he came on this radio show and suddenly got speaking engagements all over the country and
[01:15.320 --> 01:22.280]  that that supercharged the awakening in the nation to the fact that sheriffs can trump the power of
[01:22.280 --> 01:26.560]  the out of control federal government in their counties and I'm not tooting our horn here I'm
[01:26.560 --> 01:30.600]  tooting our listeners horn for getting the word out about the important work of sheriff Richard
[01:30.600 --> 01:36.680]  Mack and tent amendment nullification of out of control federal government not just at the
[01:36.680 --> 01:42.840]  statehouse level but at the county level things are backwards in many states under federal grants
[01:42.840 --> 01:47.720]  the cities are absorbing the counties and absorbing the county sheriffs this is completely
[01:47.720 --> 01:53.840]  unconstitutional anti-legal and is but backwards they have a different term they use out in Texas
[01:53.840 --> 01:58.240]  but I'm sure that you have the same term in your area but I won't use it here children listening
[01:58.240 --> 02:05.000]  but it is completely 180 degrees twisted from the way it should be and we'll be discussing that in
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.680]  the tea parties and the patriot movement and the get an update with sheriff Richard Mack coming up
[02:10.680 --> 02:22.680]  in the last hour of the transmission today now that said that said I am going to open the phones
[02:22.680 --> 02:31.760]  up in the first two hours and I'm going to cover economic news oil spill news and police state news
[02:31.760 --> 02:37.920]  up until the bottom of the hour but I want to note here now that I'm going to cover this
[02:37.920 --> 02:47.040]  information at the bottom of the hour and I'm just underlining it highlighting it putting an
[02:47.040 --> 02:53.400]  exclamation point behind it that is so important and everything we cover here is important but
[02:53.400 --> 02:59.400]  you know a couple times a week I will just say attention attention attention can I can I please
[02:59.400 --> 03:09.120]  get your particular focus on what I'm about to go over I want to briefly as I can there's so much
[03:09.120 --> 03:14.400]  detail in everything I tend to go off down rabbit trails because it's such a big picture give you
[03:14.400 --> 03:20.960]  briefly the state of the union and the state of the globalist attack on our republic and other
[03:20.960 --> 03:29.080]  formerly sovereign nations and where we stand right now in our fight against these people and
[03:29.080 --> 03:37.440]  the most important battles as I see it that we face as a society going forward and then we will go
[03:37.440 --> 03:45.920]  to your phone calls in the latter part of the hour and for the full second hour and then we've
[03:45.920 --> 03:51.240]  got David I joining us and Sheriff Richard Mack but I will tell you what I'm going to be covering
[03:51.240 --> 03:57.560]  also has to deal with high treason and I don't just put a video out like I did yesterday that's
[03:57.560 --> 04:05.080]  posted up at info wars.com and prison planet.com and also on the Alex Jones YouTube channel I don't
[04:05.080 --> 04:12.120]  just put a video out charging Obama with high treason to have a shocking headline this is the
[04:12.120 --> 04:20.200]  essence of high treason and I'm going to define the definition from the encyclopedia Britannica
[04:20.200 --> 04:31.800]  of high treason and it's a big deal to call a sitting president a traitor or to actually indict
[04:31.800 --> 04:37.120]  him publicly in the court of public opinion for high treason but this isn't high treason nothing
[04:37.120 --> 04:45.920]  is this is the very essence of classical high treason. High treason at its base is opening
[04:45.920 --> 04:54.480]  a castle drawbridge to an enemy army that is the essential archetypal example of it and that's
[04:54.480 --> 05:01.560]  exactly what this globalist criminal this enemy traitor has done. Hi folks this is Alex Jones

[08:18.440 --> 08:24.200]  coming up at the bottom of the hour obama commits active high treason signs with foreign power
[08:24.200 --> 08:31.720]  against the united states that's the headline up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[08:32.760 --> 08:38.840]  and that dovetails with washington post oklahoma south carolina utah and many other states i would
[08:38.840 --> 08:44.200]  add may follow arizona's lead on immigration law this is such a central issue this is a lot bigger
[08:44.200 --> 08:51.080]  than just immigration this is the state saying can we nullify what this out of control federal
[08:51.080 --> 08:57.080]  government's doing that's been seized by offshore banks because if we can take the states back
[08:58.440 --> 09:02.680]  we can save this country and we can bring down the new world order and the united states will
[09:02.680 --> 09:10.520]  no longer be an engine of global domination and we will not have to pay the bill for the new
[09:10.520 --> 09:15.560]  world order's criminal operations this is so important and i would just add that ladies and
[09:15.560 --> 09:21.960]  gentlemen we are having breakthroughs with my radio show my news websites info wars dot com
[09:21.960 --> 09:27.960]  prison planet dot com that are unprecedented in the history of the patriot movement
[09:30.120 --> 09:37.160]  our information has achieved critical mass and has blasted through to an entirely new level thanks
[09:37.160 --> 09:43.240]  to you the listeners spreading the word and getting the information out and that is why the heavens
[09:43.240 --> 09:53.400]  have opened up with longtime friends people we've promoted people you know showing themselves as
[09:53.400 --> 10:01.960]  federal operatives and as just egomaniacs that are jealous of our success telling more and more
[10:01.960 --> 10:08.680]  just insane lies to replace the old because when you are over the target you're going to get the
[10:08.680 --> 10:14.200]  flak and when you're number one when you're number one in the pole position in the indy 500
[10:15.080 --> 10:19.000]  people that were in the race for the wrong reasons they're going to start trying to play dirty tricks
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.480]  and we are rejoicing here in my office we are celebrating the fact that mainstream media
[10:26.040 --> 10:33.880]  governments the state department the pentagon are all putting out press releases attacking us
[10:33.880 --> 10:40.840]  foreign media is putting out press releases attacking us that isn't working so they've
[10:40.840 --> 10:47.240]  got fake alternative media and shysters and scammers and weirdos and nuts and schizophrenics
[10:47.240 --> 10:54.680]  and operatives and co until pro all firing on us at once making up new more insane gibberish by the
[10:54.680 --> 11:01.320]  minute and this means that we are really having a big effect i mean i can see it with my limited
[11:01.320 --> 11:07.320]  perspective here but i don't have over the horizon vision like the government does with their nsa
[11:07.320 --> 11:15.400]  snooping and their cumulative algorithm future predicting computers and they are in red alert
[11:15.400 --> 11:21.640]  i mean to have some of those powerful institutions in the world honing in on yours truly and to have
[11:21.640 --> 11:27.800]  builder burr group members like from david from attacking me weekly in international publications
[11:27.800 --> 11:34.440]  and to be taking uh you know front line assaults from every angle that means we are really hurting
[11:34.440 --> 11:39.240]  them just like when they lied and said ran paul said get rid of the civil rights act he was going
[11:39.240 --> 11:43.800]  excuse me excuse me hold on i can't hear you yes yes uh no i'm not forgetting rid of civil rights
[11:43.800 --> 11:48.360]  act but they said yes while they were answering the question because he said the satellite you
[11:48.360 --> 11:53.000]  know had a big delay on it that was the proof even though he said no i don't agree with that
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.160]  they ran with that hoax just like when they thought ron paul was going to win the nomination in
[11:57.160 --> 12:04.520]  2007 eight they demonized him and it had the effect at the time of hamstring him but it didn't
[12:04.520 --> 12:08.760]  matter because the transmission had been sent out we're not going to have instant victory in this
[12:09.320 --> 12:13.720]  and the fact that they're attacking yours truly as much or more than they're attacking ran paul
[12:14.360 --> 12:20.840]  what does that tell you it tells you that the information covered on this radio broadcast
[12:20.840 --> 12:26.840]  is scaring the new world order i mean i am putting out videos that are seen by hundreds of millions
[12:26.840 --> 12:33.160]  of people in the aggregate hundreds and hundreds of millions of people i can cut any five minute
[12:33.160 --> 12:39.240]  youtube video i want and it'll have 300 000 views in a month some in a day you know obama
[12:39.240 --> 12:44.440]  deception more than 25 million views just on youtube and google alone you don't think that
[12:44.440 --> 12:53.640]  isn't scaring them and i just put my life in the hands of christ my savior and i just
[12:53.640 --> 12:59.400]  just my fate is in god's hands i will tell you that right now but my life has had value
[12:59.400 --> 13:05.960]  my life has had real meaning my life has uh affected the lives of hundreds of millions
[13:05.960 --> 13:11.560]  of people and helped unlock their minds i have been used just like many of you have been used
[13:11.560 --> 13:17.480]  in the important work the the the the transcendent work it's so important of unlocking people's
[13:17.480 --> 13:25.960]  minds to this beast system and uh it is just such a great feeling to be attacked and persecuted
[13:25.960 --> 13:31.800]  and lied about and i and i just thank god uh that he opened my eyes when i was so young
[13:31.800 --> 13:36.920]  and i thank god for giving me my great family uh who helped raise me for the work i've done
[13:36.920 --> 13:44.120]  and the work that i've got coming ahead and i am thankful thankful uh for this mission
[13:44.120 --> 13:50.360]  and i am thankful for whatever happens to me i don't tell god what i want i ask god to take me
[13:51.160 --> 13:58.120]  and use me for his will and i need your prayers though ladies and gentlemen and i need your
[13:58.120 --> 14:04.680]  prayers for providence uh that we be able to carry out this important work because you know it's
[14:04.680 --> 14:10.040]  stated over and over again in the bible and history has shown it that it it's it's not enough for good
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.760]  men to stand up and do the right thing they need people praying for them and they need people
[14:14.760 --> 14:22.760]  asking god to to to breathe life into that mission with that providence because god says when we
[14:22.760 --> 14:29.240]  joined together when we joined together it is unstoppable so i salute all of you in the work
[14:29.240 --> 14:35.400]  you've done the globalists are now afraid we have bloodied them they've bloodied us as well
[14:35.400 --> 14:41.000]  but they know we've got the gleam in our eye they know we've got the electricity in our fist
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.640]  they know we've got the strength they know our backs are rigid and energized they know that
[14:47.640 --> 14:53.240]  they know we found our backbone they know we found our legs they know we're grinding our teeth and
[14:53.240 --> 14:58.920]  jutting our jaw out and that we're committed that we're past being angry and we're committed
[14:58.920 --> 15:05.960]  like heat-seeking missiles that are dedicated to destroying this new world order and it is such
[15:05.960 --> 15:12.680]  an amazing thing my friends to to have them some of the most powerful people in the world and some
[15:12.680 --> 15:19.240]  of the most powerful publications in the world openly attacking us and saying we're dangerous
[15:19.240 --> 15:25.800]  because we are because we have the truth and we carry that truth in our hearts and souls and the
[15:25.800 --> 15:33.320]  enemy knows it so don't be afraid ladies and gentlemen realize that great trials and tribulations
[15:33.320 --> 15:38.760]  are upon us and they're only going to intensify with the nanotech and the genetic engineering and
[15:38.760 --> 15:45.480]  the nuclear weapons and the advanced technologies and robotics and wars and surveillance and cashless
[15:45.480 --> 15:53.160]  societies but this what we're going into is the great test of our metal it is the great test of
[15:53.160 --> 16:00.040]  our generation our generation is now facing the greatest test that our ancestors could have ever
[16:00.040 --> 16:10.120]  imagined we are seeing things unfold that have been foretold for eons we are living in a legendary
[16:10.120 --> 16:19.800]  time and what we do will shape the future course and destiny of this species in our future in this
[16:19.800 --> 16:30.520]  universe this is a opportunity that is unspeakably important i got chills up my spine thinking about
[16:30.520 --> 16:36.120]  what we face the mind control the genetic manipulation the poisoning of the water the food
[16:36.680 --> 16:41.080]  the fact that you can just look at the public and see how they've been poisoned those of us
[16:41.080 --> 16:47.720]  struggling through the poison are doing it just purely from a spiritual level i'm more and more
[16:47.720 --> 16:54.680]  real lives and no weapon formed against us shall prosper when it is god's will but it's also god's
[16:54.680 --> 17:00.040]  will that many of us will be struck down will be tortured will be smashed but what matters is
[17:00.840 --> 17:06.680]  not he that can kill the body but he that can kill the soul and i've got one life to live i'm alive
[17:06.680 --> 17:13.560]  one time in this universe one time on this planet orbiting a sun look at the majesty and mystery
[17:13.560 --> 17:18.280]  and beauty and creation all around you and i am not going to have my one life not count
[17:18.920 --> 17:24.760]  i am not going to have my one chance to truly be a good human being and love god and love goodness
[17:24.760 --> 17:31.640]  be destroyed and i know that you don't want to be destroyed as well you don't want to be
[17:32.440 --> 17:38.200]  part of this evil worldly system and none of us are perfect none of us have all the answers but our
[17:38.200 --> 17:45.080]  hearts are right our hearts are right and that is what is important at the end of the day look at
[17:45.080 --> 17:50.440]  king david you know he once sent off one of his main captains to be killed in the battle because
[17:50.440 --> 17:56.520]  he was lusting after the man's wife he basically put some money in a position that he knew would get
[17:56.520 --> 18:03.960]  him killed that's how a leech do it bp gave halliburton and anadarko and then others orders
[18:03.960 --> 18:09.720]  that they knew would cause the well to blow up there's your false flag right there but king
[18:09.720 --> 18:17.000]  david sent that man off but after he was killed he truly repented and he truly was sorry and god
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.920]  saw his heart and said david you're a man after my own heart and that's what matters
[18:24.840 --> 18:30.760]  is that we not be cowards and that we be willing to put our lives on the line to face tyranny
[18:30.760 --> 18:38.600]  and that we be willing to be laughed at and made fun of and persecuted by lesser people
[18:39.240 --> 18:44.680]  to get that message out to those who are good and do have good hearts and who it's our mission
[18:44.680 --> 18:51.640]  to reach out to it isn't your mission to be supported or loved it is your mission to go out
[18:51.640 --> 18:57.080]  and find the people that do want to hear the truth and who do have an ear to hear there are many
[18:57.080 --> 19:02.520]  people that have eyes and ears but they cannot see they cannot hear they are not meant to hear
[19:02.520 --> 19:11.000]  they are blinded it is their destiny their destiny to be with the world to be of the flesh to to
[19:11.000 --> 19:18.200]  be of their father the devil but it is many of our destinies to stand against tyranny in this
[19:18.200 --> 19:24.440]  important time and make no mistake ladies and gentlemen this is a spiritual battle and you
[19:24.440 --> 19:28.680]  can feel it in your gut right now many of you have chills going up and down your spine because you
[19:28.680 --> 19:33.880]  are in touch with god you are in touch with the holy spirit you know the truth those out there
[19:33.880 --> 19:41.960]  laughing they are blocked off from it so to the fool this is all funny but there are no atheists
[19:41.960 --> 19:47.720]  in foxholes and we are all in a psychological foxhole right now it's time to come out of the
[19:47.720 --> 19:52.120]  foxhole and fight the new world order i'm gonna hit financial news when we come back then i'm
[19:52.120 --> 19:56.520]  getting into the state of the fight against the new world order and high treason by criminals
[19:56.520 --> 20:03.720]  and government stay with us we'll be right back it's the number one reason for slow and clogged

[24:39.960 --> 24:43.960]  we're growing it by the way we're gonna run checkpoints with the army searching your car
[24:43.960 --> 24:52.120]  looking for it that's just ridiculous and it's all ends when the public wakes up and repents

[24:59.080 --> 25:02.920]  but a lot of you aren't going to do that you're going to sit around and laugh and joke and
[25:02.920 --> 25:09.560]  keep okay fine but understand everything you're going to see unfold is a direct response
[25:09.560 --> 25:17.720]  to the fact that you lay down you lay down devils and the bodies of men are going to run all over
[25:17.720 --> 25:22.520]  you that's the way history always works understand that here's some of the news it's just amazing
[25:22.520 --> 25:29.960]  you can see him setting the us up for fall now you can see him setting up the implosion all these
[25:29.960 --> 25:35.080]  countless headlines every day about i guess we are in a depression we went from being in a recovery
[25:35.080 --> 25:41.560]  to a depression overnight gee the offshore banks need tens of trillions more there'll be an even
[25:41.560 --> 25:48.920]  bigger depression and then the imf and world bank both consortiums of the private banking families
[25:51.800 --> 25:56.440]  the ones who've engineered all this sold the derivatives took over our government's lobby
[25:56.440 --> 26:02.120]  to get rid of the laws against derivatives they've engineered the entire system on record
[26:02.120 --> 26:07.320]  they're the ones that get all the new power out of an imploding dollar and other currencies
[26:07.320 --> 26:13.480]  they come out in the french news agency today imf presses us to cut debt what we see last week the
[26:13.480 --> 26:18.040]  un said oh it's time to devalue the dollar and get rid of it as a world reserve currency and
[26:18.040 --> 26:24.600]  we'll go to a basket of currencies uh but that basket is controlled and uh their prices are set
[26:24.600 --> 26:28.920]  by this new international group that you pay your taxes to and they'll have a digital currency
[26:28.920 --> 26:35.640]  above that that backs up the sdr i mean this is it and the words of herman bon rupee global governance
[26:37.560 --> 26:44.520]  imf presses us to cut debt the international monetary fund on thursday urged the united states to
[26:44.520 --> 26:49.720]  rein in its ballooning budget deficit without putting the modest economic recovery at risk
[26:50.360 --> 26:56.120]  oh it's modest the central challenge is to develop a credible fiscal strategy to ensure
[26:56.120 --> 27:01.000]  that the public debt is put and is seen to be put on a sustainable path without putting
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.560]  the recovery in jeopardy imf shed and report you got to love it it's like somebody comes over and
[27:07.560 --> 27:15.480]  cuts your legs off and then says gee buddy you ought to get up off the ground i haven't one time
[27:15.480 --> 27:19.400]  heard a farmer with the analogy you know the government breaks a cow's legs and then it's
[27:19.400 --> 27:22.840]  flopping around in the mud and they make fun of the cow because it doesn't because it can't walk
[27:22.840 --> 27:29.160]  i mean this is the very group praying on our country that's basically overthrown it
[27:31.080 --> 27:35.480]  whose system is to go into countries give them loans have the countries not pay back the loans
[27:35.480 --> 27:39.400]  and then take the nation over and the loans are just made up digital numbers
[27:45.240 --> 27:51.480]  look at this china rules out nuclear option on t bills financial times of london
[27:51.480 --> 27:56.280]  and china has delivered a qualified vote of confidence in the dollar in the u.s financial
[27:56.280 --> 28:01.880]  markets ruling out a nuclear option of dumping its holdings of u.s government debt accumulated
[28:01.880 --> 28:05.800]  over the last decade but then they go on to say they're moving away from the dollar though it's
[28:05.800 --> 28:11.560]  a it's going to be a gradual but the state administration of foreign exchange which administers
[28:11.560 --> 28:27.320]  china's 2,550 billion excuse me 2,450 billion in reserves the largest in the world also called
[28:27.320 --> 28:33.640]  on washington and other governments to pursue responsible economic policies the statement on
[28:33.640 --> 28:40.680]  wednesday one of a series of uh that they've issued in recent days is an apparent effort to address
[28:40.680 --> 28:45.960]  criticism about its lack of transparency also played down the chances of china making major
[28:46.520 --> 28:51.960]  further investments in gold which is another deceptive statement two months ago they said
[28:51.960 --> 28:57.960]  they weren't going to buy more gold than they did just it's all deception and the articles of
[28:57.960 --> 29:05.400]  course continue down the line here here's a really scary article out of the new york times
[29:05.400 --> 29:12.280]  when they've got one every day this is by uh jeff somer a market forecast that says take cover
[29:12.280 --> 29:16.920]  for the stock market lurching again plenty of investors are nervous and some are downright
[29:16.920 --> 29:23.240]  bearish that's where robert prector the market forecaster and social theorist who is another
[29:23.240 --> 29:29.960]  league entirely mr prector is convinced that we have entered a market decline of staggering
[29:29.960 --> 29:36.520]  proportions perhaps the biggest in the last 300 years and then he goes into how he has all these
[29:36.520 --> 29:41.480]  charts and graphs and computer programs that show it and that it's all part of the market uh yeah
[29:42.040 --> 29:45.800]  every day of the new york times tells you it's just part of the market no one did this

[33:39.720 --> 33:46.600]  perfect citizen program where corporations in the government are dividing up the takeover of the
[33:46.600 --> 33:53.400]  internet and surveilling the public and that the nsa has already built these hubs all over the nation
[33:53.400 --> 33:57.560]  basically everything i told you in the last five years well i mean you read internet too
[33:58.200 --> 34:03.880]  it's the same in europe the united states australia china they're all doing it the top corporations of
[34:03.880 --> 34:09.480]  the country with the government come in and take control and start spying and the government pays
[34:09.480 --> 34:14.040]  them to do it and then they start shutting down the big corporations competition on the web
[34:15.320 --> 34:20.680]  that's the way it's always been but here it is in the wall street journal today
[34:23.320 --> 34:29.240]  no longer any doubt it's gone completely viral it is all over the news it's been the top story for

[35:07.320 --> 35:12.520]  they prey on people's ignorance so i'm going to cover that later i mean did you just think i got
[35:12.520 --> 35:20.200]  up here in the last five years or would longer than exposed internet to this has all been a
[35:20.200 --> 35:27.320]  charted global corporate plan the cfr called for it two years ago they've handed the plan off to
[35:27.320 --> 35:36.680]  government and they've been building the nsa hub for at least the last four big giant nsa complexes
[35:36.680 --> 35:42.840]  is big or bigger than fort mead all over the country running everything through it and they've
[35:42.840 --> 35:47.400]  got in the cyber security act where every high schooler in the nation will have to be trained
[35:47.400 --> 35:56.680]  by the feds and accredited to be spy warriors online flagging anti-government things countering
[35:56.680 --> 36:06.040]  anti-government lives fighting hackers that means hacking people that's rama manuals national
[36:06.040 --> 36:13.640]  security state is domestic arming and it goes on to say all internet service providers all people
[36:13.640 --> 36:19.480]  that work with computers and isps of a hundred customers or more that's basically every isp
[36:19.480 --> 36:23.240]  in the country there are very few that have less than a hundred customers you will be federally
[36:23.240 --> 36:28.200]  licensed and go through a federally approved course to be able to have a job and then government
[36:28.200 --> 36:33.480]  approved FCC hardware will be put throughout the chain of the internet including our computers
[36:33.480 --> 36:43.080]  watching everything we do and gatekeeping this is all announced this is all admitted this is
[36:43.080 --> 36:54.520]  way past big brother way past 1984 way past communist china the good news is it's all
[36:54.520 --> 36:59.480]  over the news now and they are not going to get away with this without a false flag so
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.360]  curtain emma what a year ago wrote a great article where he detailed and found some pentagon
[37:04.360 --> 37:09.480]  statements at a cyber security function as long before they ever passed the law they've already
[37:09.480 --> 37:13.800]  built it i got stuff from the early 90s about homeland security being set up through north com
[37:14.600 --> 37:19.240]  both weren't officially set up after 9 11 you got to love it all these people operate they've
[37:19.240 --> 37:23.880]  always got it built beta tested in line before they even tell the sheeple about it
[37:30.760 --> 37:35.320]  i remember curts article we got to pull that up i forget the headline where he had the quotes
[37:35.320 --> 37:41.400]  from this web streamed meeting with generals and kernels and the air force and how all the
[37:41.400 --> 37:45.960]  agencies and the pentagon is going to control the internet and how they were simulating attacks on
[37:45.960 --> 37:51.160]  themselves to quote know how to fight against it and it was very thinly veiled because these
[37:51.160 --> 37:55.160]  guys like to talk about how we're dumb slaves right in front of us about how they were going to
[37:55.160 --> 38:01.480]  attack themselves as a pretext to get more funds and take the web over and you better believe
[38:01.480 --> 38:06.760]  that they're going to attack the internet obama or the next president will activate the kill switch
[38:07.560 --> 38:13.480]  and fix the internet it was only down for three days thank god they had this or it had been down
[38:13.480 --> 38:20.760]  forever yeah you civil libertarians are idiots good thing we had it and then that sets the president
[38:20.760 --> 38:24.200]  i mean i know how their brains work ladies and gentlemen and you watch that's exactly what's
[38:24.200 --> 38:31.640]  going to happen and of course by then you won't be watching me on youtube or info wars dot com
[38:31.640 --> 38:36.440]  and present planet dot com that's not going to be allowed not after america got hit by al qaeda
[38:36.440 --> 38:43.160]  with a nuke al qaeda working for iran not after what happened in chicago not after what happened
[38:43.160 --> 38:50.760]  in manhattan tens of thousands died how dare you people say the government did it we've got to give
[38:50.760 --> 38:54.760]  all our money to offshore banks and have all these wars thank god the governments they're spying on
[38:54.760 --> 39:02.200]  us though it's so good oh yeah i mean look the only card they've got is nukes and wars and oil leaks
[39:02.200 --> 39:06.440]  and they're gonna pull out every stop you can imagine they want to make you bankrupt so you
[39:06.440 --> 39:10.760]  lick their government boots real good because they're all in a short lease to these offshore
[39:10.760 --> 39:15.800]  corporations they're a bunch of arrogant people that have gotten away with whatever they want
[39:15.800 --> 39:21.160]  and they aren't going to let you get out of their clutches they're going to squat on top of you
[39:21.160 --> 39:24.520]  and have their way with you they think they think
[39:31.800 --> 39:38.280]  now i want to succinctly get into the state of our republic and the state of the fight to restore
[39:38.280 --> 39:48.920]  the republic and save our society the globalist have analyzed every possible peaceful avenue
[39:48.920 --> 39:55.160]  that we the people of this republic and other nations have to take our government's back and
[39:55.160 --> 40:01.000]  in the united states it is the tenth ninth and eleventh amendment it is the power of the states
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.920]  it is the constitution and bill of rights narrowly uh defining the three powers of the federal
[40:08.920 --> 40:16.040]  government and binding that federal government through a separation of powers in the federalist
[40:16.040 --> 40:27.400]  system and they know the number one just honorable american way to handle this espionage this global
[40:27.400 --> 40:32.680]  corporate espionage that's all it is they've come in they've bought off the government
[40:32.680 --> 40:37.480]  they've got dirt on the government they've got their people after the last 60 plus years of
[40:37.480 --> 40:43.800]  takeover into almost all the regulatory positions in the bureaucracy they don't have to get elected
[40:43.800 --> 40:51.720]  there they're in a revolving door between the fortune 100 and the bureaucracy so that's why
[40:51.720 --> 40:58.680]  they're transferring all the power to the unelected bureaucracy not even the executive washington
[40:58.680 --> 41:04.600]  is seized for all intents and purposes it is ceremonial if you're real like ron paul or
[41:04.600 --> 41:17.240]  rand paul they will demonize you 24 7 but they know that they can dominate governors they can
[41:17.240 --> 41:22.040]  dominate committee chairman but more and more they're losing control of legislatures that's
[41:22.040 --> 41:28.440]  where the people have a chance and of the public figures that out and if we start getting 55 to
[41:28.440 --> 41:34.120]  60 turnouts for state elections like we've been seeing for the dog and pony show presidential
[41:34.120 --> 41:39.640]  elections when you usually would have 20 turn out on average for state elections eight percent
[41:39.640 --> 41:49.000]  for local look at the national averages 22 percent state eight percent local it varies it's in the
[41:49.000 --> 42:02.120]  mid 50s for presidential elections what 58 turn out for bary sataro and uh the other guy i'm a
[42:02.120 --> 42:12.120]  shame mctrater so all of this is happening and they've analyzed it and they know that's the remedy
[42:12.120 --> 42:16.760]  the founders gave us they know that's the main path their other past and we should fight on those
[42:16.760 --> 42:23.640]  simultaneously this is a multi-front three-dimensional full spectrum war and you fight them at any
[42:23.640 --> 42:29.160]  level it hurts them you expose them any level it hurts them in fact randomness is important in
[42:29.160 --> 42:33.640]  this it's just all of you acting in different directions in different ways but also hitting
[42:33.640 --> 42:41.400]  in the same direction on key areas that's unstoppable every person you wake up every
[42:41.400 --> 42:47.800]  person you expose the truth every corrupt thug you stand up to every time you speak up whether
[42:47.800 --> 42:53.560]  five people hear it or a hundred thousand it's devastating the act of resistance is victory
[42:53.560 --> 43:02.360]  they want to drive the fight out of this they want to break us they want to dominate us they
[43:02.360 --> 43:06.600]  want to force their will on us that's why they humiliate us we just outlandish the government
[43:06.600 --> 43:10.760]  admitting they take your baby's blood secretly for dna databases at birth the government admitting
[43:10.760 --> 43:14.760]  they put poison in your water the government admitting they're growing the opium the government
[43:14.760 --> 43:18.760]  admitting they've done all these things that they just want to overwhelm you where you just give up
[43:18.760 --> 43:25.000]  well in psychological torture tests with monkeys and dogs you may be able to shock them and torture
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.040]  them and drive them into catatonic submission but homo sapiens are different and they happen
[43:30.040 --> 43:34.840]  to know that that you've got areas in your brain you can turn on where none of this stuff works on
[43:34.840 --> 43:41.960]  you understand we're not a dog and we're not a racist monkey ladies and gentlemen we're homo sapiens
[43:41.960 --> 43:50.760]  that envisioned the atomic bomb in 1900 that's a species destined to colonize deep space
[43:50.760 --> 43:54.520]  that's a species that has value that's a species that's powerful
[43:58.440 --> 44:02.120]  why do you think they chemically poison you every day through the air food and water they're
[44:02.120 --> 44:06.520]  trying to suppress you there's no way they'd have gotten away with this with american 60 years ago
[44:06.520 --> 44:13.320]  prefloridation now they're accelerating the poisoning to keep you down it's not going to work
[44:13.320 --> 44:19.800]  get yourself as clean as you can shake yourself out of the mind-controlled malaysia under
[44:20.920 --> 44:25.720]  look into your gut look into your psyche look at the facts you know what you're hearing here is true
[44:25.720 --> 44:34.280]  is veritas and the system doesn't like it because they can feel their fall coming they can feel the
[44:34.280 --> 44:44.520]  energy stirring once you tap into that inexorable strength that god gave us and once you set your
[44:44.520 --> 44:50.360]  will against these people and fully commit you can hear the howls of fear and anguish and the
[44:50.360 --> 45:01.640]  gnashing and the weeping and wailing of our enemies so they know that the tenth amendment
[45:01.640 --> 45:10.280]  move through the states is their undoing and they can't stand the fact that more than 30 states
[45:10.280 --> 45:15.720]  have already passed or passing tenth and ninth amendment resolutions pointing out the feds are
[45:15.720 --> 45:20.680]  taking too much state money involved in things that are clearly unconstitutional like what kids
[45:20.680 --> 45:27.000]  are going to eat at lunch or what you can do on your own land or federalizing police or having
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.080]  troops run checkpoints and remember the tennessee governor last year said don't have military
[45:31.080 --> 45:35.000]  checkpoints shutting down highways and the military just went ahead and did it well that
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.240]  that governor should have stood up and said no and gone and should have marched out there with
[45:39.240 --> 45:46.680]  a state guard and told the state police arrest these men i mean that's what america is all
[45:46.680 --> 45:51.400]  about ladies and gentlemen but the point is is these resolutions mean something because the
[45:51.400 --> 45:56.680]  states are declaring hey you're out of control and then as the feds who are really globalist
[45:56.680 --> 46:01.560]  they're just instruments of this foreign corporate takeover as they get more and more outlandish it
[46:01.560 --> 46:08.600]  will point out to people how criminal and traitorous and treacherous and seditious the federal
[46:08.600 --> 46:13.000]  government's become i mean if you work for the federal government in much of what you do it is
[46:13.000 --> 46:20.280]  an act of sedition of unconstitutional criminality i mean what you're doing if you read what the
[46:20.280 --> 46:25.480]  founding fathers said they they they call for people to be hung by the neck until dead for what
[46:25.480 --> 46:31.480]  many of you have done i'm not calling for that i say you can be exiled i say you know send you to
[46:31.480 --> 46:38.760]  alba like napoleon because i i i think you know executing people can lead to things like we saw
[46:38.760 --> 46:43.240]  with the french revolution and you can get a tyranny worse than what you had and that's why
[46:43.240 --> 46:51.080]  the founders just talked about executing people and did exile folks but i want to get this out on
[46:51.080 --> 46:58.920]  the table here that arizona is an essential fight because other states are watching arizona and
[46:58.920 --> 47:03.480]  they're following suit and the media has engaged in a hoax i've read the bill i've read the sections
[47:03.480 --> 47:09.960]  on air you can go read it it is a word for word copy of the federal bill of federal law it just
[47:09.960 --> 47:18.360]  changes to the state and it states up after first contact for no seat belt drunk driving a domestic
[47:18.360 --> 47:26.840]  dispute whatever the case is just like they ask a citizen may i see your id they don't give it
[47:28.200 --> 47:29.320]  it's probable cause
[47:32.200 --> 47:38.120]  they're an illegal alien taken to jail you know i know a lot of austinites that are in texas
[47:38.120 --> 47:44.760]  buying cars from mexicans that have uh foreign plates on them and you're literally god you don't
[47:44.760 --> 47:49.720]  pay the toll roads cops don't pull you over you're completely left alone i i know some other friends
[47:49.720 --> 47:53.240]  who go well we'll just make our own little fake license plates and you know saver sovereign
[47:53.240 --> 47:57.560]  citizens they see something in english they don't recognize they pull you over take you to jail
[47:57.560 --> 48:03.320]  instantly you you can only put a mexican plate on your car and then you are literally literally
[48:03.320 --> 48:09.400]  invisible that's because it's key to break up the country it's key to bring in the north american
[48:09.400 --> 48:15.240]  union read the spp documents security prosperity partnership it says we're going to use border
[48:15.240 --> 48:20.840]  crises to bring in north american integration and what does obama say to senator kyle i can't
[48:20.840 --> 48:26.040]  fix the mass murder and death on the border because i've got to use that to get amnesty passed
[48:28.520 --> 48:31.400]  which isn't going to stop all the crime and drug smuggling and the rest of it
[48:31.400 --> 48:38.120]  and the poor immigrants coming across being fed on by codies and crooks on both sides
[48:41.960 --> 48:47.480]  so they've got to have this that's why the associated press three years ago reported
[48:47.480 --> 48:51.880]  oh how good it was look we talked to these different bank heads of major u.s banks it
[48:51.880 --> 48:55.960]  says they give loans to illegals with no credit or no id isn't that sweet
[48:55.960 --> 49:03.480]  local banks around here take one thing matricula that you can get out of a cracker jack box anyone
[49:03.480 --> 49:09.000]  can go get fake matricula cards from the mexican consulates and missions and then just go in and
[49:09.000 --> 49:17.160]  get whatever you want because it's part of a globalist plan a globalist operation it is absolutely
[49:17.160 --> 49:24.360]  essential to their takeover program to complete this and if arizona falls if the feds are able
[49:24.360 --> 49:29.480]  to come in and block arizona and you've got treacherous cities like phoenix and tucson
[49:30.040 --> 49:34.360]  and others saying oh well we're sanctuary cities we're gonna and in those cities i've
[49:34.360 --> 49:38.840]  locked the city council hearings the illegals tear down american flags run up mexican flags
[49:38.840 --> 49:44.280]  beat people up attack cars and they're given a green light the cops stand down because that's a
[49:44.280 --> 49:50.680]  protected group because they're essential in bringing the republic down of course our government
[49:50.680 --> 49:55.320]  finances their enslavement in mexico they're only being used as a weapon
[49:59.160 --> 50:07.000]  period that's all that's happening here and when we come back from this quick break i'm
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.000]  going to briefly get into the high treason issue but the state of the patriot movement is strong
[50:13.640 --> 50:19.320]  we found our fighting spirit we found our legs we found our spine we found the red blood coursing
[50:19.320 --> 50:23.640]  through our veins black white hispanic old young are rediscovering liberty
[50:25.240 --> 50:29.720]  they're rediscovering the fact that all we've gots this republic america hadn't perfect but it's
[50:29.720 --> 50:33.720]  the best thing out there and the globalist want to remove our bill of rights and constitution
[50:33.720 --> 50:41.640]  because it's an obstacle to them america is going into high tech bondage but we've got a chance at
[50:41.640 --> 50:47.720]  the state level to beat them and beat them big time and did not be intimidated by them and to
[50:47.720 --> 50:52.760]  not let their name calling get to us and to just go in and take our counties and cities and states
[50:52.760 --> 50:58.280]  back at every level every one of you in those positions is on the front lines resisting this

[53:12.600 --> 53:17.560]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[53:17.560 --> 53:23.320]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[53:23.320 --> 53:28.760]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[53:28.760 --> 53:34.120]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[54:12.360 --> 54:21.720]  watching what happens in our republic mexico with its incredibly impressive anti-immigrant laws
[54:21.720 --> 54:27.080]  putting people in force at labor camps torturing them extorting their families mexico admits this
[54:27.080 --> 54:32.920]  is their policy but we've got to keep our border open we've got to get free health care people come
[54:32.920 --> 54:38.200]  in have their babies have it all paid for as citizens go bankrupt but don't worry once they
[54:38.200 --> 54:42.920]  fully bankrupted america they're still going to have open borders it's just that all the nations
[54:42.920 --> 54:49.480]  are going to be just like mexico they use poverty as a weapon now i wanted to read to you the
[54:49.480 --> 54:54.920]  definition of high treason because what the federal government is doing makes it illegitimate
[54:54.920 --> 55:00.600]  it is not the federal government it is openly a group of criminal traders by by the definition
[55:00.600 --> 55:07.720]  those aren't just words who are engaging in the classic act of lowering the drawbridge
[55:08.520 --> 55:15.080]  for the enemy to come in by night or giving the passcodes to the enemy so that they can make it
[55:15.080 --> 55:22.680]  pass the censories and take over the castle or the city or the encampment that is high treason
[55:22.680 --> 55:28.040]  here is the definition of high treason from the dictionary you can also look it up in the
[55:28.040 --> 55:35.960]  encyclopedia participating in a war against one's country this is high treason
[55:39.640 --> 55:44.200]  you know it's treason to give an enemy some information outside of wartime but america
[55:44.200 --> 55:49.000]  is in a war against the globalist we are under military attack by mexico and the drug gangs
[55:49.960 --> 55:56.680]  and what is the president doing he's aiding them this is classic high treason participating in a
[55:56.680 --> 56:01.640]  war against one's country attempting to overthrow its government what's the north american union
[56:01.640 --> 56:06.840]  high treason that's a new form of government that that's overthrowing your government spying on
[56:06.840 --> 56:12.040]  its military what do they do given all our secrets to the un and china and israel everybody else
[56:12.040 --> 56:20.040]  spying on its military its diplomats or its secret services for a hostile and foreign power
[56:20.040 --> 56:24.600]  or attempting to kill its head of state and perhaps the best known examples of high treason
[56:27.480 --> 56:32.280]  high treason is considered a serious offense and carries the death penalty in some countries
[56:32.280 --> 56:44.520]  but the most archetypal example is giving the passcode so that enemies can come and give the
[56:44.520 --> 56:52.440]  passcode so that the drawbridge is lowered so that elite troops can then come through the
[56:52.440 --> 57:01.400]  drawbridge kill the guards on the other side and open the fortress up to being taken this is
[57:01.400 --> 57:08.120]  high treason suing the state of arizona when all they're trying to do is protect themselves and
[57:08.120 --> 57:12.520]  over 80 miles of the state has fallen to mexico there are federal signs saying don't go down this
[57:12.520 --> 57:18.200]  highway don't go in this national park with farmers and ranchers being killed with half
[57:18.200 --> 57:24.360]  of the jails being filled half people in the jails being illegal aliens sheriffs begging for help in
[57:24.360 --> 57:30.280]  s os's and they don't have national guard for the border no they've got it for new york state
[57:30.280 --> 57:35.000]  searching citizens for guns and they've got national guard to guard the poppy fields in
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.160]  afghanistan and they put it on television they think we're so dumb oh just tell them we grow
[57:39.160 --> 57:42.840]  the opium the dumb public won't put two and two together that they're shipping it in
[57:44.680 --> 57:49.160]  or that we keep it illegal to keep the prices up yeah there's nothing these idiots won't buy
[57:49.800 --> 57:53.720]  you see that congressman when they asked brunackie where the trillions went and brunackie told him to
[57:53.720 --> 57:59.880]  go fly a kite let's take everything these people are complete morons hey what's that little uh
[58:01.000 --> 58:07.080]  crackhead we got obama that little harvard cia guy that chicago mobster and we got so much dirt on
[58:07.080 --> 58:12.760]  in there's nothing he won't do yeah we'll just have him sue arizona violating the 11th amendment
[58:12.760 --> 58:18.040]  which says you can't sue a state the feds can't especially it goes on if it's on behalf of a
[58:18.040 --> 58:23.480]  farm power alien yeah those dumb public that know how to read article 11 they don't know how to read

[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:48.040]  and this is high treason for your government to act against its borders its sovereignty against

[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:04.600]  we are looking at ways to you know basically let these people be legal and then they bring them in

[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:28.920]  you what to do and you're racist if you don't like all these black panther groups running around
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:35.000]  constantly saying kill all the crackers uh you know kill their women kill their babies that's
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.400]  standard procedure for these groups that is not what the black panthers were saying 30 40 years
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:48.120]  ago they were saying get off drugs don't be part of the system and you've got to know that these

[01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:01.240]  go on fox news but they don't go on cnn which they would see as you know liberal they want to go
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.160]  and cite the republicans and they don't go on this show because i'll call them out as feds
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:11.240]  i mean just like howl turner i told you 10 years ago that top white supremacist was a fed and the
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.000]  other fed white supremacist that's why they hate me so much because i expose their operations
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:23.640]  and i'm telling you right now that these guys are feds period absolutely federal agents or being
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:31.320]  federally handled there is no doubt that khalid muhammad kill the women kill the white children who
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:38.840]  got all these new kill the cracker stuff i mean this is this is just like the grandson of the adl
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:43.720]  former head adam gadon who was arrested beating up arabs in front of mosque suddenly becomes the
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:48.600]  al-qaeda leader saying al-qaeda is going to get you i mean give me a break it's fake and it's come
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.880]  out that it's fake just like the cia admits they've they've made fake bin laden tapes in the washington
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:59.880]  post they admitted it a month and a half ago in the spy talk column they were interviewed they said
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:06.440]  yes we made fake videos they're fake it's fake it's fake these black panthers are fake most the white
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:13.240]  supremacist are fake uh how many times do i have to be right until people realize i know what i'm
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.880]  talking about i've got the enemy playbook i studied them it's all i do listen to pete stark
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:24.040]  you want to hear a trader the left in this country these are the eugenicist these are the control
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:29.080]  freaks these are the poverty pimps these are the resco type and obama types and they sit there and
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:36.200]  say oh you're criticizing the open border um you're a minute man you're killing people number one i
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.840]  did some research these weren't minute men they and the minute men haven't killed anybody it's just
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:46.520]  all lies oh you're disagreeing with me oh have some more guns murder some more people and then he says
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:52.120]  we don't have a border problem let's play this clip oh we can't we can't get enough minute men armed
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:57.240]  we'd like to get all the minute men armed so that they could stop shooting people it's not a job
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:04.920]  we're just citizens to see the united states we're trying to get we'll try and get you some more
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:11.160]  arms and uh get you down there to we don't want to go down there we want to help lives of normal
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:16.680]  lives we pay taxes and we pay we pay to have the government take care of our borders is that all
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.880]  is that all what the government should do well that's one of the things the government is supposed
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.840]  to do that's what the federal government is there for they said they were going to do it they're
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.880]  not well then we don't need the minute man that's just correct we don't want to know what we're doing
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:36.920]  let's send the minute man home that's a good idea pause and he giggles and laughs like mr rogers
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.160]  there then let's send the minute men home you've noticed these politicians talk to you like you're
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:47.240]  three everyone's npr talks to you like you're a four-year-old all real soft just like when you're
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:53.320]  trying to domesticate a horse that you're not gonna ever take care of a ride you're gonna
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:13:00.360]  sell it to the french for steaks but you want to come here come here let me slit your throat real
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:07.560]  slow i'm a big fat trader parasite i'm a sack of garbage but but but let's listen to this guy go on
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:13.720]  and say that there's no border problem here here it is answer the question what answer
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.880]  wait wait you want to you you don't want to what kind of answer would you like young man
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.760]  he asked the question look can i answer you mind if i answer this question excuse me
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:29.480]  more yeah you'll catch me through it please do answer the question yeah what's your question
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.440]  the question is why is the federal government leaving our border borders for us for anybody
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:42.920]  to come in anywhere they work if you do anything about our border you would know that that's not
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:50.520]  the case our borders are quite secure thing how do you know that's enough turn it off it gets even
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.160]  worse then he says oh we've got a law where the illegals are legal to come up here and pick fruit
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.960]  and go back and forth and turn that the law was gotten rid of in the mid 1960s i mean i mean just
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:07.080]  total delusional because they're used to to a public that doesn't know which end is up that will buy
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:13.240]  into anything one of the highest crime rates in the country is arizona in those border areas
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:19.480]  upwards of a hundred miles into the state is being denied to citizens this is on record
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.920]  and i mean no one can deny the border is on fire
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.960]  mexico has collapsed there's kidnappings every day on the u.s side and the media keeps it very
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:39.960]  quiet and then meanwhile we see these articles out of england over and over again where
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.760]  in one case a farmer was broken in three times beaten up in several of the cases
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:51.160]  he finally got a hold of an old shotgun with 50 something year old shells in it
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:57.560]  and shot one of the illegal alien that was actually gypsies attackers in his house
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.240]  only hurt them and they sued him one he was given life in prison remember that famous case
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:09.400]  and every week i see articles without even looking this is not without looking where woman 57
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:16.840]  indicted in england for stabbing a man who broke into her apartment and was raping her and they
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:23.000]  never charged the rapist and they charged the woman and you see stories out of chicago it's
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.960]  always it's always an old man you know 94 year old retired railway worker who was uh you know
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:36.280]  bronze star winner in battle of the bulge i mean these are real cases we've interviewed some of them
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:42.440]  um 84 year old railway worker in virginia arrested after fighting off men in his home
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.360]  they stabbed him twice before he got to the firearm he shot them he's been charged
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:52.040]  i mean i'm just throwing out from memory you know vague cases you've seen them all
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.400]  in fact they looked at indicting that beetle he's died of cancer now with harrison or whatever
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.760]  his name was a few years before he died the guy broke in he like a coward started shouting
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.520]  chanting you know harry christner or whatever thing and that would magically fix and i'm not
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:14.440]  bashing harry christner's i just think that was ridiculous and uh his wife finally beat a lamp
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.160]  over the guy's head and they looked at charging her no when somebody breaks in on you whether it's
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:25.240]  the government anybody else you submit and you lay down or you go to jail now i'm seeing more
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.760]  and more of these and in six months i'll say remember the guy outside denver i don't remember
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:35.000]  the name or the details but today we have the details and we have the articles up on info wars.com
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:42.280]  and um 82 year old robert wallace we did some research of course he's a highly decorated
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.560]  veteran but that's not in the article you have to dig deeper because they don't want to uh
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.560]  you know let you know that somebody's a veteran it shows the poor old guy wouldn't do an interview
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.200]  out there sweating working in his workshop it's an old family home that he's lived in all his life
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:17:00.600]  he was born there that's an area that was rural but now is becoming uh uh urban and the illegal
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:05.400]  aliens came on his property hooked it up he came out told him get off his property and they tried
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.480]  to run him over so he shot one of them in the face now under every state law out there unless you're
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:14.840]  in mafia chicago or mafia new york city you're allowed to defend yourself your property they
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:19.640]  don't care though i've seen cases in texas where people are being attacked at night and they and
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.640]  the police go ahead and arrest them when they shoot somebody and so they've now arrested him
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:29.160]  and charged him with first degree murder so they're saying this was deliberate and uh he's facing
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:34.200]  live in prison or even possibly the death penalty under colorado law i guess and uh
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.240]  they even had the district attorney out making excuses going well you know maybe we'll lower
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:46.760]  the charges down a bit later i mean no the guy was under attack by citizens by easter bunnies uh
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:53.240]  by by illegal mexicans whatever he should be able to shoot him but but again it's holy to the new
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:58.200]  world order to not let you defend yourself so here's a clip from me yesterday reading out of the news
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.520]  and then the short clip from the actual tv station we'll go to break with this here it is this one
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:07.720]  this is out of k d v r out of Denver colorado thieves could go free while the victim faces jail
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:13.800]  time two illegal aliens were stealing his trailer he ran out told him to stop uh he shot one of them
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:18.760]  who got injured and they're gonna be says he's gonna face life in jail and they're to be released
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:23.640]  because basically they're illegal aliens and god so this is your criminal government ladies
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:28.680]  and gentlemen who wants to take your right to defend your life and property just like england
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:36.360]  does you saw last night on fox 31 news at nine we told you about an 82 year old man who shot
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:42.520]  at two men stealing from him the crooks confessed but it looked like the elderly homeowner was going
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.880]  to be charged in the case tonight there is a chance the charges won't stick against him
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:55.080]  fox 31 investigative report why was he charged as the explanation why was he charged 82 year old
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:00.120]  robert wallace has lived in his wheat rich home all his life but he could lose everything including
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:05.080]  his freedom for what he describes as an act of defending his property and his life they have
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:10.840]  seriously overcharged this wallace admits he fired two shots at two men he says they almost ran over
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:16.680]  him as they were stealing his flatbed trailer one of the men demasio torrez confessed to the theft
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:21.800]  torrez and his partner in crime alvara cardona have previous arrest records and are believed to be
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:27.080]  in the country illegally now despite the confession they are not charged with anything back at a
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:31.400]  blow we're gonna come back and finish this but america is literally the happy hunting ground
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:37.880]  the illegals can have a hundred aliases if they want they can rob cheat steal kill drive around with
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:43.880]  fake plates the police are ordered to leave them alone and then they go on somebody's little farm
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:49.880]  it's a farm they're hooking the trailer up they try to run over the old man and hobbling around
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:56.280]  and he shoots one of them and the police can't wait to climb them in irons because they've been
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:02.840]  trained to hate americans what started as an idea to provide power for a small hunting cabin has

[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:36.680]  face reporting that an 82 year old man saw people stealing his trailer and he walked out with a
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:43.080]  firearm and which is completely legal and said stop the kind of run him over so he shot one of the
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:50.520]  guys and the reports are some glass from the car flew into his face and they plead guilty why they
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:54.840]  plead guilty because they know they're just going to be released they're not charged remember this
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:02.040]  this same in England they're not charged that wouldn't be neighborly we want you to become a
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:09.720]  citizen and then we'll suck you dry you're key to globalism and the old man is charged with
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:17.080]  first degree murder murder and now they're talking about well maybe we'll drop the charges
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:21.400]  they want to set the precedent ladies and gentlemen where you can't protect yourself or
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:27.400]  your property they can't stand it you know there's no liability for government to protect you from
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.680]  crime but they don't want you to be able to protect yourself this is a treasonous treacherous
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:39.640]  government let's continue with the audio you saw last night on fox 31 news at 9 we told you about an
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:46.120]  82 year old man who's shot at two men stealing from him the crooks confessed but it looked like
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:51.320]  the elderly homeowner was going to be charged in the case tonight there is a chance the charges
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:56.680]  won't stick against him fox 31 investigative reporter Julie Hayden has the explanation
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:04.200]  82 year old Robert Wallace has lived in his wheat rich home all his life but he could lose
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:09.000]  everything including his freedom for what he describes as an act of defending his property
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.760]  and his life they have seriously overcharged this Wallace admits he fired two shots at two men he
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:19.160]  says they almost ran over him as they were stealing his flatbed trailer one of the men
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:24.840]  Demasio Torres confessed to the theft Torres and his partner in crime Alvara Cardona have
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:30.120]  previous arrest records and are believed to be in the country illegally now despite the confession
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:36.280]  they are not charged with anything while Wallace the homeowner faces a dozen felony counts including
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.400]  attempted first-degree murder that could put him in prison for the rest of his life so they have
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:47.000]  simply charged him with these things in an effort to put him in a position where he has to plea
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.320]  bargain Jefferson County DA Scott story on Peter Boyle's khow radio show today indicates he will
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:59.480]  be taking a closer look at the harsh charges against Wallace during the tendency of the prosecution
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:04.600]  then aggravation mitigation all those factors you're talking about come into play and we're not
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:09.480]  there yet wreck predicts the Jeff Kodier will drop the attempted first-degree murder charges
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:15.880]  the odds of mr. Wallace being convicted of attempted first-degree murder approach zero
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:20.920]  but he says it's wrong for prosecutors to put someone like the homeowner through the stress
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:26.600]  and the expense it is not right to charge somebody with these multiple counts where you
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:31.720]  know with certainty and this prosecutor knows with certainty that they have no desire to convict him
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:37.160]  of these crimes i i haven't talked to the prosecutor but i just know it from years of being in these
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:42.520]  trenches but no one is dropping the charges just yet meanwhile the man remains out on bond due back
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:49.800]  in court in september julie hayden fox 31 news folks when i say that if you have a portrait of
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:58.360]  john wane hanging in your house you are literally al-qaeda to this government if you're a veteran
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.680]  if you're a gun owner of your protection your property we have the mic reports we have the
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:09.320]  federal reports the police are trained you are the scum of the earth this old man should let
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:13.400]  him steal his trailer and then he wouldn't even have got insurance for it the cops wouldn't have
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:21.720]  come out that old man exists to literally be a tv dinner for illegal aliens and then we have these
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:26.440]  black panthers running around let's play some of this intimidating that you have a stick in your
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:31.160]  hand that's why you know yes no no i'm gonna turn i mean that's a weapon so that's why i'm a little
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:37.640]  worried the department of justice went after those new black panthers won the case and was ready to
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:43.560]  talk sentencing when suddenly under the new leadership of eric holder someone at the doj made
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:50.920]  the call to drop the case king samir shabazz is the new black panther party's philadelphia leader
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:56.600]  this new panther version of black power does not include white participation
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:04.680]  i hate white people all of them every last iota of a cracker i hate it we didn't come out here
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:09.880]  to play today there's too much serious business going on in the black community to be out here

[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:42.280]  guess it's okay i mean see i'm not even that upset now the gun confiscation has begun that they've
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:48.680]  got mobile x-ray machines pulling people over in the u.s taking guns from the army because i've
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:52.680]  known it for so long was going on in the background now it's just out in the open i'm like well we
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:35:00.040]  knew that was coming see how we're being conditioned to accept this you got david i coming up always

[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:22.760]  year welcome yes sir i have a question and a comment the top of the pyramid some people say that the
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:27.480]  catholic church is at the top and that there's a black pope who runs everything with the jesuit
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:33.640]  order others say it's zionic and israel and then eustis moans says it's the queen in england and
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:43.400]  black nobility so which one is it well frank i appreciate your call um a lot of people spend
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:50.600]  all their time obsessing over what organization or group uh runs the new world order the new world
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:57.400]  order is an idea of the priest class which can be made up of anybody who understands the secret
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:04.440]  knowledge of how to control populations and how to deceive people versus the rest of society and
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:08.840]  there's wickedness in high places you know that's why the founding fathers said keep government small
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:14.040]  because it's almost always corrupt and bad and so it's not an anti-catholic thing it's not an
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:19.480]  anti-jew thing it's not an anti uh you know british thing you know or an anti-chinese thing
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:22.920]  i mean the chinese government's corrupt the british government's corrupt the israeli government's
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:27.000]  corrupt the iranian government's corrupt the russian government's corrupt they're just all
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.640]  evil and it doesn't matter what government i look at they're all into the occult at the top
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:36.520]  they're into decadence it's just what power does power corrupt absolute power corrupts absolutely
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:44.600]  as lord actin said uh so i see the pope promoting world government uh i see israel promoting world
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:48.680]  government i see the british crown promoting world government it's just the whole world is in the
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:54.920]  thrall of this thing uh and uh but that is an indictment of individuals that are within groups
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:02.280]  um but uh you know i'm just here trying to defend our sovereignty and our republic
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:06.920]  and trying to keep the taxes from being raised and trying to bring the fractional reserve banking
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:12.040]  system to justice uh instead of the media always and the foundations they know how to divide and
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:15.800]  conquer sidetracking us with well who runs those banks well who runs those banks well let's talk
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:20.200]  about that all day instead of hey the banks won't say where the money went let's not let them take
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:25.560]  over you know i mean i'm i'm just here trying to reach as many people as i can pappy in illinois
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:35.640]  listening on uh fm radio because i don't think there's a 121 59 um so i'm not sure what station
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:41.080]  that is uh pappy what does your radio say uh for an affiliate there and and i can tell you
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:50.280]  it's it's a m it's 121.59 a.m okay well i'm i learn new things every day maybe it's did high
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:57.560]  def am or something uh but okay uh what's on your mind pappy all right i'm in chicago the area
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:05.640]  okay i heard everything you're saying and i agree with it here's what you have to do in my opinion
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:14.360]  in for wars you have to have a box around it that young what you're stating for the day
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:21.000]  and where we have to contact people how do we change this stuff what do we do to get our
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.680]  voices heard well i mean i give out the basic facts we take your calls we have different
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:30.600]  guests on with different ideas i don't even agree with you know every guest we have on
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.920]  those different perspectives and i'm pointing out the state rights are the key we need to get the
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:39.640]  voting numbers up in the states we need to take our states back and have them enforce the constitution
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:44.200]  we need to point out that the president's engaged in high treason by the classical definition
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.800]  we need to point out that the war with iran is going to be a globalist distraction and to be
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:52.920]  used to expand the police state and bankrupt us further uh we've got to point out the gmo foods
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.480]  and florida are really hurting us and show people all the government documents that we link to in
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:03.160]  the films i've made and all the facts we've covered i mean it's all right there peppy and uh
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:07.560]  i've then it's up to you what you do as a leader in your area and then we do give phone numbers out
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:13.800]  we do you know say call this committee on this issue or uh you know i mean i mean we do that
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:19.640]  from time to time but my show is not the whole world i mean my show is influential uh but it's
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:27.960]  influential in its totality in its aggregate in its whole my body of work tirelessly like a
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:32.840]  woodpecker i mean a little woodpecker pecking a tree over a couple years can cut a whole tree down
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:38.280]  you know basically a pothole until you know until the tree falls over but in a day he can only drill
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:44.040]  30 or 40 holes in it getting worms out uh so i mean i've i've woodpeckered a lot of trees here but
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:50.040]  by myself each day pecking away i'm not that powerful all of the power i have is through you
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:55.560]  and all the power you have is through me and you know all of us together uh but i mean what are
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:02.280]  your ideas for solutions peppy you have to tell us where to go where do we email where we call what
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.600]  do we do man i mean peppy i appreciate your call but i mean like i said you must be missing what i'm
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:13.560]  saying this is a huge world with almost seven billion people in it but six billion seven hundred
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:21.640]  and fifty plus million and there are i mean go on abc websites with comment boards go on the
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:26.440]  houston chronicle comment boards with thousands of people on it and talk about the new world order
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:31.800]  talk about info wars dot com people are now ready to be awakened but we haven't finished that awakening
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:36.440]  process and then we point out to them hey they're arresting people for defending themselves hey they're
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.240]  leaving our borders open hey the government's corrupt hey let's let you run for office uh
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.280]  i've got sheriff mac coming up in the last hour about getting good sheriff selected and then under
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:50.440]  the law they can keep feds out for stuff that didn't their jurisdiction i mean the feds in the past
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:58.040]  couldn't come in your county but for the smallest you know air you know reasons and by small reasons
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:04.360]  i mean they couldn't come in for easy reasons i mean very tightly defined areas very small
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:10.040]  jurisdiction and then we've just been trained by media and culture and da's and everybody else
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:14.120]  and mayors and county commissioners to bend over to the feds because they're bringing us quote
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:20.600]  all this free money remember that uh county sheriff in in uh albany no and i love the army
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:25.720]  searching everybody and getting guns they got money we don't have all this free money it ain't
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:33.320]  free it is not free i mean what is it that you don't understand we've got to take control of our
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:36.680]  government at the state level that's what they're trying to head us off at the past that's what
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:40.840]  they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off freaked out about we've got to come
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.240]  together against tyranny come together against big government come together against the big banks

[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:05.000]  noticed they can't get cap and trade through federally but every week i read about another city
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  being paid off by these foreign banks i mean austin just erected 2.6 billion dollars in taxes
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:17.400]  that in the next three years just on our energy bills to be paid to foreign banks they're seizing

[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:30.280]  them again these crooks always try again i got sheriff matt coming on to talk about solutions
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:35.560]  i'm getting sheriff selected there isn't some magic you know thing to do i mean there's targets
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:41.800]  everywhere all this show is is solutions that's why co until pro say we don't offer them all we

[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:57.800]  i mean on top of the four hour show we made a video we put the documents to it showing you
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:02.120]  how the military is quietly taking over america and i say in there wherever you live in towns
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:07.160]  where this is happening you go explain to your sheriffs and your police and your city council
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:11.800]  this is illegal and you go out and you confront these people and it is illegal and you say no no
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:16.760]  no see they know how to push push push and then we bitch and complain but then we just bend over
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:22.600]  and acquiesce you've got to keep pushing ladies and gentlemen you've got to get aggressive i mean
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:27.000]  you ever played tug of war with a bulldog and it just won't let go we've got to be more like bulldogs
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.400]  and not like some other breed of dog that just let's go with it you know let's go i mean i got a
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:37.800]  french bulldog it's a sweet little dog but catches frisbees play soccer and bounce the ball four times
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:42.040]  on his head i mean this is a genius dog and and he's a bulldog so he's got those genetics don't
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.600]  let go of something just and unless you give him the command to let go of it he won't i mean the
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:52.040]  jaws lock he's got a giant head he looks like a cartoon bulldog they've overbred most bulldogs
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:56.200]  they don't look like what they looked like in photos a hundred years ago this dog looks like a
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:01.160]  bulldog from a looney tunes cartoon you guys have seen him in the office i mean does captain not look
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:09.720]  like a fine looney tunes specimen uh uh bulldog i mean he's arc typal and you've got a latch on
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:16.040]  and not let go you've got to decide that you're not going to have all the answers okay you create a
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:20.680]  local hand bill you hand out with websites and info and what's happening make it a local hand
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:26.440]  bill a national hand bill national issues local issues uh get my films make copies give them
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:31.960]  to people have a showing at the local library put an ad in green sheets five people show up that can
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:41.160]  be the core that do great things i was talking to an administrator of a christian school that only
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:45.480]  has school two days a week they've become quite successful here in austin they've only been around
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:50.600]  four years and the rest is home school and they talked about how three of them got together five
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:57.000]  years ago with a mission to provide classical education and you know christian environment
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.760]  as support for homeschoolers and they've just built something incredible in just a few years uh by
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:07.960]  dedication but i mean it's again you've got to go from the dreaming stage to putting it into the
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:13.320]  function stage and and and now i'm ranting and not going to your calls it's just pappy sounded
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:20.040]  frustrated uh hey pappy i don't have the money to have just employees sitting here every day
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:25.000]  saying alex what's your action alert of who we call or who we go after i mean i i have people
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.960]  calling say give me the number to congress and i've given it out hundreds of times uh but but but
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:39.480]  why would i have to why would i have to you know give you everything why do i have to do
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:43.640]  everything do you mean i mean i'm not complaining about you griping at me it's just that what is
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:49.560]  the mindset of of of you're expecting me to fly up like a mama bird and give you a worm they just
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:53.800]  put fox up on the screen and then they're reporting i have the ap article here where they're gonna ban
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:59.560]  sugary drinks and foods and city buildings versus plastic bottles and see it sounds reasonable
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:04.280]  but it sets the precedent that they control your everyday life and now the feds are talking about
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:09.080]  banning all these different foods and drinks but not aspartame you know not sodium fluoride
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:16.200]  not msg again oh sugar is killing you we're gonna put a tax on it now let's go to mike and
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:24.920]  georgia mike you're on the air eruption okay i missed the first part of what you said so go
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:33.320]  ahead and start over the bp engineer uh eruption that took place in the gulf uh there was a guest
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:38.200]  on the other day that indicated he believed that this was due to they were adhering to outdated
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:44.440]  standards at the depth they were at i'm wondering what those possibly could have been i'm not aware
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:49.560]  of any stands it wasn't outdated standards they were just ignoring all of the standards and common
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:55.320]  procedure that they've learned over the last hundred years plus of drilling uh that i mean
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:03.720]  the engineers from the major companies anadarko halliburton slumberjay others told them this
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:09.720]  will cause the well to blow up and it had already exploded two months before it was already leaking
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:16.200]  okay an accident that it was mission accomplished well that's been my opinion in my view and it's
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:21.400]  congruent with the blocking of the aid and the fact that bp's a kingpin with the carbon tax and
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:26.280]  has invested everything in it and literally owns hundreds of billions themselves in derivatives
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:31.720]  attached to this uh and yes but we've had other guests on who disagree and people email me going
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:34.760]  why do you have a guest on the disagrees with you well because we're having a debate we're having
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:40.200]  a discussion about it and then i'm trying to hear what they think uh but uh yeah no i mean
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:43.800]  look this whole thing stage a hundred percent the evidence is crystal clear i mean i know that
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.960]  i mean i can integrate all the points and know it's a 99 chance that it's totally staged but we
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:51.960]  know bare minimum they're using it to push the carbon tax they've got the former chief economist
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:58.120]  of the world bank in the news excuse me imf in the news uh saying that they want a global carbon
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:02.760]  tax out of this and they should use it for that i mean i mean this is this is going on obama has
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:07.800]  said that did you say you had an uncle that was an engineer and you might be able to get him on the
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:17.160]  show no i was saying i had a i have a dead great uncle who just died last year uh who was a who
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:22.600]  who ran one of the biggest uh plants in houston and so yeah he worked on that uh but i do have
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:28.440]  family and people and i and we have worked we have had some engineers on we've had some guests on
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:34.120]  but this is very specialized and most of these people who work for say slumberjay or other companies
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:40.360]  they won't talk because if they talk they'll be blackballed as engineers and it's a very specialized
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:47.480]  group that are drilling you know 15 000 20 000 30 000 foot wells basically they excavated out the
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:56.360]  natural restraint and set it to erupt yes and they didn't allow the proper capping and plugging
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.080]  and uh they they they gave orders that were completely backwards they said we're going to
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:06.280]  dump seawater into pressure rise it to be cheaper and then we're going to stick cement mud on top
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:11.000]  of that and the and the engineer said look you you can't do that the pressure is too high it will
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.720]  blow out and uh bp said you will do it i mean that came out in the coast guard hearings with the
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:22.040]  survivors and it's been every dog scratches his own fleas and since this is right in our bathtub i
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:28.520]  think the more people could be made aware that there's that it's ludicrous to think that this was
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:34.040]  an accident and that this was an assault the more likely that we're going to have people making
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:40.360]  responses to try to do something about the situation well i totally agree with you and
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:45.080]  and they're trying to keep people out of the gulf they're now telling mainstream media and county
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:53.000]  and city officials authorities not public servants uh but the big officials the feds are saying
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.120]  that the county commissioners and city council can't even go to the beach that's a that's a abc
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:03.320]  news that's up on info wars dot com today i mean that's the arrogance of these people i appreciate

[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:24.840]  former head of the green party and england championship golly international bbc presenter
[02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:30.200]  multi-time best-selling author and somebody who's really expanded people's paradigms and
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:35.320]  gotten to look into a lot of very interesting places and so much of what david ike predicted
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:41.000]  more than 15 years ago unfortunately has unfolded i agree with him that we're on the verge of a world
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:46.280]  transformation an awakening the system is panicking with divide and conquer there's no doubt they blew
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:50.440]  the oil well there's no doubt they're now admitting we're going into a depression trying to start world
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:56.040]  war three uh they know they're losing control and let me tell you uh this is the most important
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:00.760]  time in human history up to this point he's with us for the next hour david ike thank you for being
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:06.280]  on with us pleasure alex well we were just talking during that one minute break and and you were
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:11.080]  saying that you do believe this is the quickening or the beginning of the acceleration of a real
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:15.960]  paradigm shift there's a lot of issues i want to go over but what's on david ike's radar screen that
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:21.880]  you think is most important right now well i think you know what we're seeing on the surface um
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:27.560]  horrendous as it is uh is a manifestation of something that's actually much much deeper than this
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:34.360]  there's no doubt whatsoever i mean i've seen it so blatantly over the last 20 years gathering pace
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:40.600]  and gathering pace there is an awakening going on it's not the majority yet but mines are opening
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:45.960]  now as as mines are opening they're seeing what they couldn't see before and what the cabal wants
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:52.200]  to do is keep those mines shut and one of the most effective ways of doing this is why we've
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:56.360]  got to stay really strong and focused in this period we're going through now it's going to be a number
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:04.920]  of of years of major challenges the the the way that they are seeking to keep us from awakening
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:11.240]  to keep our minds closed is to keep us focused on fear keep us focused on survival keep us
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:17.400]  bewildered keep us in a state of constant anxiety about what's happening what about the future
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:21.560]  what about the kids what about the the job their way of life and the gulf has gone
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:27.000]  oh my goodness a war in iraq in iran now what's going on now now there's an economic depression
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:34.680]  oh my this is all orchestrated to throw everything not just the kitchen sink but the but the the
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:42.440]  plug as well at humanity in general so that we are so focused on on survival and uh fear and
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:49.480]  anxiety that we don't um go and continue this process of awakening so we can actually expand
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:55.240]  our minds to see what the closed mines before could not see it's a battle for our minds it may
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:03:03.560]  not seem like that it may seem like it's it's just uh another uh manufactured catastrophe and the
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:09.880]  gulf another war in iran another uh economic collapse but all these things are orchestrated
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:19.240]  to to to fire at our minds and and our minds are the target because from our state of perception
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:25.000]  of self in the world comes our behavior and our actions that's right i've noticed the globalists
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:31.240]  dominate by just getting our attention and always creating new crisis so we watch the mainstream
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:37.160]  television so we pay attention to them and they dominate how we dress and what we think and uh what
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:45.240]  we uh eat and and and just literally get us sucked into this false tapestry this false reality
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:50.120]  that they are projecting and now they're openly saying they want to start shutting off the web
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:54.840]  which shows that they realize they wanted to use it as a tool of domination but that it's backfiring
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:04:03.480]  against them that's the word alex attention it's a battle for our attention because the the the idea
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:13.000]  is to hold humanity um in a state where we are filtering and seeing ourselves in the world only
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:19.240]  through the five senses um we are multi um dimensional uh consciousness awareness we are
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:24.520]  far far greater than what we appear to be when we look in the mirror and say that's david icall
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:32.360]  that's alex jones or that's um ethyl smith and what they want us to do is is is keep our attention
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:38.760]  on the five senses and that's what we do when we are in fear when we are in anxiety when we're
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:45.320]  worrying about the future when we have this um sense of fear of not surviving that pulls us into
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:50.200]  the five senses and that's what they're trying to do and then the system poses as the saviors and

[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:29.560]  it thought-provoking and uh very uh apropos what's happening in our world we always find his
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:35.320]  perspective to be enlightening uh david uh instead of us getting into you know generalities or
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:40.200]  you know myself getting into you know long diatribes about my view of what's happening
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:44.360]  today i really want to try to sit back we'll see if i can do it because you bring up so many points
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:50.120]  that make me want to chime in and just throw out questions and get your take on it the globalist
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:57.480]  are overrunning the west with third world populations uh why are they doing this
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:05.720]  well it's two things we need to know to get a perspective on the world is where this cabal
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:11.560]  wants to take the world and the methods they use to take us there and where they want to take the
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:19.800]  world of course as we well know is to a global fascist dictatorship with the end of countries
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:25.160]  the end of borders where basically you just have the world government dictating to massive
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:33.560]  regional blocks and anything below that is just irrelevant and one of the great barriers to that
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:42.280]  happening is the people's sense of their own culture their own country their own sovereign nation
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:49.560]  if you like and because people if they have a real sense of of country and you know i'm not
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:53.720]  saying that i'm into all this but a lot of people are and this is the point from the cabal's point
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:10:02.120]  of view they will resist giving that power away say from the united states to the north american
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:10.440]  union in in britain to the european union and so the idea is to break down that sense of culture
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:16.920]  by basically breaking down the culture and you do that by opening borders to other cultures now
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:20.680]  i'm not saying one culture is better than another i'm just trying to explain here what they're doing
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:27.720]  from their perspective and that you let different cultures pour into into the same area and suddenly
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:33.880]  it becomes a cocktail and there is no single culture anymore that people can identify with
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:43.400]  and that is all the time loosening and weakening people's sense of need to resist the giving away
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:48.040]  of sovereignty to to unions and to a world government because they've lost the sense of
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:53.640]  culture that they had before see this is why what we're talking about here is happening all over
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:59.560]  the world because of course it's a global agenda in europe the european union has brought down the
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:04.440]  borders all over europe and every time another country comes into the european union their borders
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:10.520]  come down and then the borders between them and every other country comes down and so from
[02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:16.280]  eastern europe for instance people pour into western european countries and it becomes again
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:22.200]  exactly the same thing a cocktail of cultures which eventually becomes just nothing that really
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.720]  is something people can identify and the globalists can also play those different groups off against
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:31.800]  each other not only will they give up their rights but then i see the trendies always
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:37.320]  counter back oh well it's like star trek which we know is predictive programming uh oh you will all
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:43.000]  be unified and love but this isn't some loving world government that we decided to lovingly join
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:48.760]  this was covertly built they now admit it was a covertly built and it's authoritarian
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:55.960]  dehumanizing and it's admitted in game is global depopulation yeah exactly and this is a very very
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:01.880]  interesting point a very important point about uh playing one off against the other you know the
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:10.040]  people that pour uh from the the poorer countries into the richer countries uh through through the
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:16.680]  borders coming down so just as much um pawns in this game as those in the countries of the
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:22.600]  indigenous population that are affected by that it's not good guys and bad guys we're talking
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:29.480]  about here it's it's different aspects of the human race being used as pawns in the same game and this
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:35.240]  is why instead of fighting each other we need to start uh looking at what uh unites us all which is
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:40.920]  the fact that we're all the target of this this cabal this this global fascist dictatorship in
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:47.480]  in the making of the very fast making i mean we have proof in this country um a few um months ago
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:55.400]  now that during the um the Blair administration they were allowing people um immigration uh into
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:13:00.920]  britain on a scale they weren't admitting to it came out one of the people involved uh uh
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:06.360]  blew blew the whistle on this and um what they were actually saying is they wanted to
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:13.320]  um have so much immigration into britain that it would this is the quote change british
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:20.440]  society forever and in that one quote we have the prime reason for bringing the borders down
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:24.840]  this is what they've done in europe i mean the government here now the new government of camera
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:29.800]  and saying oh we must we must slow down immigration into britain but they don't say immigration
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:38.520]  they say non-eu immigration because they have absolutely no power whatsoever because of the
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:45.160]  european union laws now and and the giving away of sovereignty to stop um anybody coming in from
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:49.720]  the european union into britain and that's exactly the position they want they're doing the same in
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:55.160]  america of course is listening to this program will well know and so anyone that that challenges
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:59.880]  this in in america for instance they're called racist and they're they're targeted by the federal
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:05.000]  government as we're seeing in uh uh some some states of america try to try to make a stand on
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:12.360]  this and it's all orchestrated to break down and destroy a sense of what is it what is america
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:17.240]  of what is britain uh uh uh what is all these countries that are targeted and like i say this
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:21.720]  is not an attack on what we call immigrants it's absolutely not because they are as much
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:27.400]  um pawns in this game as anybody else and david let me just add a brief caveat to that
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:32.840]  absolutely i mean it's simple whatever the globalists are for whatever they're really promoting in
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:37.400]  their councils we've got to be against if they're against disarming us it doesn't mean there aren't
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:42.760]  some accidents and problems with having an armed society we've still got to be for it uh if they're
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:47.560]  trying to socialize health care you get the legislation it's a it's a eugenics takeover
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:52.280]  lowering the quality raising taxes we've got to be against it uh they want to launch a new war
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:56.760]  we've got to be against it they want open borders we've got to be against it i mean it's very simple
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:03.480]  we know these are evil anti-human anti-freedom people and we must stand against everything
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:07.880]  they stand for now we can intellectualize and then always go down the road and look at why
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:13.240]  that's the case but their interests are not the interest of free humanity so it's very elementary
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:21.720]  for me that's a very very good point um let's get it real straight these people not only don't care
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:28.920]  about us they are uh antagonistic uh towards us they want to destroy the human race and bring it
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:34.520]  under the heel of their global fascist dictatorship they want to irrevocably change what humans are
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:40.120]  in our society the family everything till we are just empty biological androids and their words
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:46.360]  that they program this is the end of humanity this is the extinction of humanity is their stated goal
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:54.360]  in every document i've got by their transhumanist futurist these are human hating scum this is what
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:59.240]  we're dealing with and therefore as you quite rightly say if they're for it then it's bad for
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:05.320]  the human race and and we've got to be a bit more kind of uh street wise about this and and and not
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:11.320]  see everything um in black and white the the question of gun ownership i've never had a gun
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:17.320]  i don't want a gun um i i i i i i don't want to use a gun i'm not into any of that stuff but a
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:23.480]  lot of people have guns in america the question uh that comes up is should people have guns or
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:29.000]  should people not have guns and that's a debate okay but it's not the debate but they at heart
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:35.960]  of what's happening now the question should be why do the people who have a deep um hatred but
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:41.240]  for humanity why do they want to disarm the american population now that's the key thing
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:47.080]  we ought to be looking at we can have these debates about this and immigration the question is why
[02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:54.120]  does the cabal want to do it and the answer is always because it advances their agenda
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:59.800]  towards the global fascist dictatorship in which uh as you rightly say it won't just be
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:05.080]  an economic dictatorship a political dictatorship we're talking about a genetic dictatorship
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:12.600]  where they will um not only own our bodies and and have um uh literally lawful ownership on our
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:17.080]  bodies that's the where they're going but they will genetically control us and control us through
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:22.520]  microchips that's where they want to go and if we're going to get pulled away into diversions of
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:27.400]  debates about this and debates about that there's one debate at the moment until we've sorted this
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:33.640]  why do they want to do a b c and d and that's the question we need to keep asking all the time
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:38.600]  to keep uh uh on top of where we're going and we know what they want they're so arrogant
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:43.880]  that they all write white papers on government health care on the environment movement on cap
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:49.400]  and trade they admit it's the shutdown industry bankrupt everyone have a huge state that's the
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:55.080]  only thing that's funded that literally absorbs humanity and begins accelerating their soft kill
[02:17:55.080 --> 02:18:00.040]  operations we know they've already been introducing poisons into our environment and into the vaccines
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:03.800]  and foods we've caught them we've got countless documents where they admit they're doing it now
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:10.040]  they want to accelerate that up to a hot kill level like we've seen in areas of africa and uh

[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:28.120]  strings of the world but um we've still got a lot of what long way to go with a lot of people um to
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:35.480]  fully understand the scale of what we're dealing with the rabbit hole goes so deep it's staggering
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:41.480]  and uh we're not even uh dealing with just human entities we're dealing with non-human entities
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:46.040]  we're dealing with entities that operate outside the the field of vision of what we call visible
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:52.040]  light which uh which our eyes can see and appears to be uh this world there are other worlds um
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:58.120]  well david i'll say this penetrate penetrate this one and and and we that it's involving those two

[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:23.800]  writings they believe they're being given every one of them it says they're channeling things that
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:28.920]  that they're being directed uh at the highest levels at the mid levels it's it's hedonist it's
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:35.480]  satanist it's people that want money and power at the top these are very focused uh people working

[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:18.120]  nations because the globalists want to remake the world in their system so any culture whether it's
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:23.000]  good or bad they want it out of the way for the corporate culture this is a short segment let's
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:30.440]  get into the oil spill uh David Ike the oil spill what's your research on that well the the um
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:38.440]  appalling things happening in the Gulf of Mexico now are a classic example of the the way the uh
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:45.560]  web the illuminati web um interfaces with uh different aspects of itself to create a coordinated
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:52.200]  uh policy and a coordinated agenda i mean you've got um someone for instance like peter d
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:57.560]  sutherland uh who was uh non executive chairman of bt bp until a few months ago he's also non
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:02.360]  executive chairman of goldman sacks international he was the director of the world trade organization
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:08.280]  he was the director of uh actually actually uh the director general of the world trade organization
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:13.720]  he was a director of the bank of scotland uh in the run up to the period where it crashed um in 2008
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:18.040]  and had to be bailed out by the taxpayer he's on the been on the steering committee of the
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:22.120]  builder group he's a chairman of the trial actual commission he's a chairman of the london school
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:27.640]  of economics one of the great illuminati university is on the planet created by the fabian society
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:32.360]  his financial advisor to the vatican brought up in a jesuit school the jesuits of course are a
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:37.480]  major major player in this global web he's been one of the major people in europe pressing for more
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:44.280]  and more power for the european uh union and um while he was non executive chairman of bp you
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:50.280]  had a guy called lord brown who's uh who got out before the the the stuff hit the fan over the
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:57.640]  gulf of mexico um he was so appalling as uh executive chief executive of bp that tony blare
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:03.160]  described him as his favorite businessman so you can see how bad he was and it was lord brown who
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:11.640]  um instigated the policy of bp of cutting safety and cutting uh all uh they've got more violations
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:16.360]  in houston alone i saw the number it's like over a hundred times what other oil companies have
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:22.600]  combined and they're the top fake environmentalist company that with enron created the carbon tax
[02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:27.160]  scam with al gore exactly and this is this is how it all interfaces this is for how the how the
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:32.920]  web works you you see bp but it's not just bp bp is connected to goldman sacks goldman sacks is
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:37.960]  connected to halliburton and so it goes on and don't forget queenie she owns a big part of it
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:43.960]  yeah lord lord lord brown um was um chief executive of bp when you had that massive
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:49.320]  explosion at the refinery in sexas city which people were of course were killed and another
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:55.640]  environmental uh disaster in so many ways and and he instigated this bp policy not because they
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:01.400]  were struggling for money we must cut costs no because he wanted to expand and expand the profits
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:08.840]  of bp and one way he could do it was to was to cut uh cost so we cut costs on on on safety on checks
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:13.720]  and all the rest of it and that was the the sequence of events that eventually led to what
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:19.160]  happened in the gulf of mexico and then when you look at um goldman sacks again as i mentioned with
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:25.640]  p2d sutherland that's selling 44 of its shares in bp in the run up to what happened in the gulf
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:30.680]  tolly hayward the chief executive of bp that followed lord brown sold a lot of his shares
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:36.520]  in the run up the over a third obama dumped his vanguard stocks in it they all dumped it's it's
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:44.680]  it's got so many red flags all over it um but it with the a prior knowledge and and b that the
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:51.000]  thing was a disaster not waiting to happen the disaster uh was made to happen and then you you
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:57.720]  look at what happened after that and so many uh mysteries um kind of fade away when you know
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:05.160]  the story of what the goal is so the next mystery in all this is why the bp and the federal government
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:12.680]  clearly have no real interest in reacting to this uh disaster to to cleaning up the beaches to doing
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:18.120]  what is necessary why people countries would turn away when they offered help it's because they want
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:26.280]  this disaster to be as big as possible a yes to um offer solutions like uh the carbon tax and all
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:32.920]  the rest of it now they their climate change uh scam has been falling apart but also there is a war
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:37.960]  by this cabal against the united states they want to destroy the united states militarily
[02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:44.920]  destroy it uh economically they want to destroy everything it stands for because that has to be
[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:51.800]  brought under that under the heel of the global uh cabal um if the world government is to have
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:56.760]  total power no more superpowers otherwise you don't have total power now you've got the 10 regions
[02:28:56.760 --> 02:29:01.800]  as the un says with the 10 global directors this has been on record since the 60s which they're
[02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:07.000]  now moving towards and that's what's so amazing they use the us as their henchmen as their funding
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:13.320]  mechanism while the us gets all the blame for the global imperial takeover and now as they get ready
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:18.520]  to destroy us they're moving towards devaluing the dollar the imf world bank or criticizing our
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:25.160]  monetary systems the un is posing as the savior with the global cashless currency so they use us
[02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:30.120]  for their dirty work and then flush us down the toilet when they're done stay there david i quick

[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:10.520]  of u.s citizens troops assist in over 2000 arrest last year alone as america sinks in a
[02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:14.120]  total martial law and the same thing's happening all over the country and that's why we saw the
[02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:20.120]  marist connectivity a few months ago call for martial law in that little sleepy town so we're
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:27.000]  going back to david i could a minute um don't forget we have made films like in game invisible
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:32.200]  empire a new order defined and of course the obama deception that go into who these bankers are
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:36.760]  how they're controlling society and what their plan is and this film in game gets into the
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:42.680]  extermination plan this film is free at info wars dot com when you order it with invisible empire
[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:47.480]  or several other of our newest films and i'm doing that because in game i believe is probably my most
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:51.960]  important film and it's got to be seen quickly so info wars dot com there's a link at the top
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:55.400]  the two different shopping carts that have basically the same specials we've got a deal where

[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:20.600]  this martial law police state cyber security now they're admitting censorship of the internet with
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:25.880]  david in a moment but david's segueing from the oil where do you think that's going a and b the
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:31.480]  media is now shifted in europe as you know england and the u.s is saying okay it is a depression
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:36.760]  after telling us we were in a recovery now it's a depression what do you see unfolding with that
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:43.000]  leading into a possible strike on iran what do you see from studying the globalist behavior in the
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:48.280]  past which is psychopathic and and and they do it in patterns what do you see unfolding well on
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:52.760]  the gulf they wanted to get as bad as possible too so they can exploit it as much as possible with
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:58.920]  with uh the solutions to to the problem they've created in terms of the uh the economic situation
[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:05.320]  i've been saying since 2008 that there's there's a three-point plan here one was to crash the economy
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:12.280]  in 2008 so people could see there was a major problem this um then justifies it doesn't really
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:19.000]  but uh in in uh in their efforts to justify it they say it justifies uh a massive a staggering
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:25.560]  we we still don't understand the scale of the transfer of wealth from the population
[02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:30.280]  to the banks and the elite that has gone on as a result of this bank bailout i was reading the other
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:36.920]  day um an article about the fact that these toxic assets of these banks which the taxpayer money
[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:43.080]  was supposed to have uh been paid over to uh to to sort out the banks still own the toxic assets
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:48.760]  but um for what this article was saying they don't have to appear on the balance sheet until
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:53.080]  they're sold so you've got a ticking time bomb there and you've got balance sheets that are being
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:37:00.680]  produced by banks that are absolutely nothing like the actual um financial state of that bank
[02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:06.920]  but the the second uh point in this uh three-stage plan that i was talking about since 2008
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:13.960]  was to empty the coffers of governments in terms of reacting to the economic situation
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:21.560]  and we have reached that now i mean what we're having in britain is absolutely savage beyond
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:30.840]  belief uh cuts in public expenditure uh by by the government um uh to to uh react to the incredible
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:36.840]  debt that they've been uh but the taxes go up so so a larger percentage of the taxes goes directly
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:44.040]  to the bankers who were the ones that created the 600 trillion conservatively uh in fake assets and
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:49.560]  and they won't tell congress or parliament where the money went exactly the same the same thing
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:56.120]  over here in europe in britain uh during the the brown labor government uh that was replaced
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:38:04.120]  recently this amazing transfer of wealth uh went from taxpayers to the the banking system and uh
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:12.040]  and to to the cabal network in general and now unbelievable levels of uh cuts in public expenditure
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:17.720]  are being instigated because they say that we're in so much trouble because of the debt now wait
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:21.720]  for this mate i talk about you know i talked about earlier about everything connects into
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:28.360]  everything else the david cameron government that has replaced the uh the brown labor government
[02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:35.960]  has appointed someone to oversee um where these savage cuts of billions and billions of pounds
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:41.320]  are going to be made that are going to fundamentally affect the lives of everyone in this country
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:48.120]  guess who they've appointed lord brown former chief executive of bp who was responsible
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:54.040]  for the decisions that led up eventually to the gulf oil disaster well that's like having all these
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:58.920]  former goldman sacks i mean that's like exactly that's like having all these former goldman sacks
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:03.560]  people running every position in the federal government getting the bailout money and then
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:09.560]  giving it to goldman sacks and jp morgan i mean it is a new level of crime and now in the us of the
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:15.320]  the federal uh federal reserve expansion and powers they're being given a new secret office
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:21.080]  with unlimited funds to quote take over any area of the economy they wish so they're being given
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:26.440]  dictatorial power right now and the same things being done in greece and everywhere else this is
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:33.480]  their global coup d'etat they're going for it all and then that segues into the un and the imf
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:40.040]  announcing we need to start phasing out all the currencies and going to a s dr basket and we need
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:45.640]  a global government that you pay your carbon taxes to to finance this and who are the biggest
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:51.800]  investors in carbon credits well it's goldman sacks jp morgan chase bp and a handful of others
[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:59.400]  it's always the same inner cabal exactly and you've got this guy in america who um was uh the great
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:06.440]  new messiah obama who if anything is worse than bush and that whole period because it's speeding
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:13.960]  up now i mean this man is uh is not even subtle he's just agreeing to everything necessary to to
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:19.480]  allow this to speed up and speed up and speed up and i say this to people you know all that's
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:26.920]  happening now was predicted a long long time ago not because of people sitting in darkened rooms
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:33.720]  smoking something and coming to some conclusions but from hard research from documents from from
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:39.240]  from written material saying what these people were planning to do and it's unfolding now it
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:46.600]  wasn't prophecy it was research now we have to then decide where do we draw the line here um we didn't
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:51.240]  draw it when it was first pointed out because oh it's just conspiracy theorists what are we going
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:56.760]  to draw it now or are we going to draw it a few months down the road when it's even worse a year
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:01.640]  or two down the work down the road when what's happening today will be nothing compared with
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:07.640]  then when are we going to draw the line there's nothing nothing in anybody's life i don't care
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:13.640]  who they are i don't care where they are there's nothing more important in anybody's life than
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:19.640]  focusing on what is going on and we coming together as a population irrespective of race
[02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:25.720]  religion color creed income bracket and saying what are we going to do together to stop this because
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:32.760]  at the moment we have got a tail actually at the core a tiny tail wagging a massive dog and
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:39.720]  and unless we uh start focusing on this and cut out the diversions that are designed to stop us
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:45.800]  focusing on this then it's just going to get worse but the power is still in our hands there are so
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:53.080]  many of us and so few of those in full knowledge are actually manipulating us come on wake up do
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:42:00.520]  something David i guess there's never nothing that we can do what can i do well sit down how can
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:05.640]  you make a contribution to this how can you communicate this information even if it's calling
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:11.160]  into a radio show in the mainstream or something i just saying this is going on go to this website
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:17.000]  go to this radio program they'll tell you what's going on but there's nothing but there's already
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:22.840]  a huge awakening happening we've got to accelerate it because not only is that little tail wagging
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:29.720]  this giant dog they're going to pose with their false solutions to the crisis they created that's
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:35.240]  their methodology as you know problem reaction solution to bring us deeper under their control
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:40.120]  unless we're there every step of the way going you're the crooks you're the social engineers
[02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:44.600]  you're the controllers you're the one that did this how ass and i need to give the federal reserve
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:49.080]  that engineered this even more power how ass and i need to give the bank of england who engineered
[02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:54.360]  this on record more power look at your connections look at how you're involved in this look at what
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:58.760]  you've done we've got to be there that's why they want to shut down the internet because they're
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:03.400]  panicked now let's talk about that chinese net style censorship now coming to australia coming
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:08.680]  to new zealand coming to idly coming to france open announcements in our news that yes it's going
[02:43:08.680 --> 02:43:13.000]  to be more draconian but to keep you safe because al-qaeda is about to shut the internet down so
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:16.680]  we've got to have the power to shut it down to save it we're going to track everything you do
[02:43:16.680 --> 02:43:21.720]  we're going to block what websites you can visit already in full wars dot com prison planet dot com
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:27.320]  are already censored on the free broadband in many cities in europe we've confirmed that
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:31.560]  the government here the fcc saying they're going to take it over cast sunstein saying is going to
[02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:38.120]  censor it there's no doubt that line in the sand if we don't stand up against tyrants is whatever
[02:43:38.120 --> 02:43:44.280]  we'll put up with as thomas jefferson said they aren't going to push it to the limit and so again
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:48.760]  showing that we have power david doesn't that indicate it that now they are moving against the
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:53.960]  web even though that exposes them because they realize that that there is an accelerated awakening
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:44:01.720]  happening let me give you an example just a simple example of which is an example that can be
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:08.200]  expressed globally one of the appalling horrific things that's going on in the world again part
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:15.720]  of the agenda is for social services and police to steal children from their parents in extraordinary
[02:44:15.720 --> 02:44:24.600]  numbers now in america all over the world in britain um on the basis of uh fake uh and and it's
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:30.440]  now mainstream news in england i mean for those that just tuned in that they've actually got quotas
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:36.120]  before a baby's even born and they admit they trump it up these are children snatchers they are
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:41.560]  they're they're stealing children and in in in at least in parts of america like california they
[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:47.080]  i mean i think it's all over america there are there are federal financial incentives for social
[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:51.720]  services to take more and more children from their parents but the point i'm making here is that there's
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:57.560]  a lady her name's maureen spallock in liberpool in england and she had her children stolen three
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:03.080]  of them years ago now and they were they were given away to to foster parents by the social
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:09.400]  services and in the previous sense the liberpool police and social services have run a vendetta
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:14.360]  against this woman um as she tries to get her children back she was actually arrested
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:19.480]  this is just one example i could i could list a number of outrageous things that happened um
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:26.200]  she was arrested and taken to court for sending a birthday card to one of the children that the
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:33.480]  state stole the other day a few days ago um the liberpool police picked her up again for for sending
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:41.800]  a text message to someone um they put her in in jail um um uh in liberpool and the the reason that
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:47.800]  the family courts that decide all this are held in secret is not to protect the children as they
[02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:53.320]  claim is to protect the system and the greatness and the pedophiles from stealing the children
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:59.640]  through uh social services the point i'm i'm leading to however is this i put on my website
[02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:06.600]  when i heard about this um how gutless disgusting and pathetic the liberpool police were and a
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:11.960]  number for liberpool police to um let people say what they thought about what they were doing to
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:18.040]  this woman she was in custody at the time and um a few hours later they let this lady go and they
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:24.600]  dropped the charges because their compute their phone system crashed so many people rang in to
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:29.800]  complain at what they were doing to this lady that they hold uh phones they couldn't keep their child
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:34.440]  kidnapping going so they said open the phones up we got more kids to grab but it's actually come out
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:40.600]  in the telegraph and it's actually come out here in the us that they have uh quotas on what color hair
[02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:46.520]  eyes they uh that that before a mother has a child they're already planning the fake charges
[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:52.120]  and it's come out over and over again that that so many of the cps workers are pedophiles
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:56.040]  exactly because they can get away with everything they're pedophiles and they're saying it's not
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:59.960]  all of them nothing like all of them but the people that run the show invariably um are i've
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:03.960]  been researching this for decades no i mean it's in the newspaper every day that they catch a top
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:11.080]  top cps workers the short point is though alex but when people the public um phone this police
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:16.680]  station in large numbers and said this is disgusting we're not having in other words the secrecy
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:23.880]  and uh and and the shadow uh level that they do this on was taken away this lady was released
[02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:30.120]  and the charges were dropped we have the power they're terrified of of the public that's why
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:33.960]  they're arming against us that's why they're surveilling that's why they're admitting they're
[02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:38.920]  surveilling now because they know they've committed crimes they know they're run by crooks and they
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:47.160]  are scared yes but what we have to do is understand our power to change this you know we're talking
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:53.480]  about a handful of people in full knowledge manipulating the lives of billions what are we
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:58.680]  doing well that's why you've written the new book uh mankind get off your knees yeah human race get
[02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:04.840]  off your knees it's called um it's just out and uh the the subtitle is uh the lion sleeps no more
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:13.400]  because within us is a lion it is it is um the real human being um being suppressed by the the uh
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:19.720]  the the the human being that has been uh programmed to think it has no power the human being to to to
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:26.440]  fear authority to fear the consequences of taking on authority or refusing to cooperate with
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:31.720]  authority that's the lion i'm talking about within people and that lion is starting to come out
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:36.680]  but he needs to come out in very much larger and we need the police and the military and others
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:40.360]  who are starting to wake up to realize you're compartmentalized as well the globalists have
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:45.480]  genetically modified the gmo food to sterilize and give you cancer they've they add the chemicals
[02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:49.560]  of the water to sterilize you and give you cancer we have the all the government documents we've
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:55.560]  covered even fox news reported yesterday that marilin has banned the uh uh by uh senol a that
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:49:00.760]  they're putting in the plastic products that does sterilize men i mean the white house science are
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:06.680]  admits they're doing this you are under attack too and david you've talked about compartmentalization
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:12.600]  we need to get the police and military to realize even if they consciously see themselves as on the
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:17.560]  winning team and part of the new world order they're not they are seen by the new world order
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:23.400]  as an even bigger enemy than the general public in the globalist documents we've gotten that this
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:28.840]  is a point i i think is very important to stress uh to those in uniform and to those in the dark
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:33.720]  suits in government who are serving this this uh system while not actually instigating that they're
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:40.840]  instigating it they're serving it you have no power i don't care if you're in the military i don't
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:47.560]  care if you've got how many kind of stars on your on your uniform i don't care what level of the
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:52.360]  police force you're in i don't care if you're doing roadblocks i don't care if you're pulling
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:50:01.080]  people off the street i don't care what you're doing you have no power your uniform has the power
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:07.800]  take your uniform off okay put it in the wardrobe where's your power go and get another job
[02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:16.200]  without that uniform where's your power you have no power you are employed to animate that uniform
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:22.520]  which is an extension of the state and that's all you are and therefore you are expendable
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:28.280]  while you give your soul away while you give your mind away while you give your morals and
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:36.840]  decency away advancing this this uh fascist dictatorship you will be okay with the fascists
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:42.840]  that you're serving but your children and your grandchildren have to live in the world you are
[02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:48.360]  creating and one day you're going to have to understand that and i don't envy you that moment
[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:53.400]  because it's going to be horrific when it dawns upon you the world that you've actually created
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:58.520]  the people in uniform and the dark suits that administer the system while not um being the
[02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:05.480]  originators of it they have to start breaking ranks okay get some backbone open your mind look
[02:51:05.480 --> 02:51:14.360]  at what's going on and get some freaking backbone before you administer and impose and enforce a
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:19.800]  world that will be grotesque for your children and grandchildren in fact not even not even that for
[02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:23.720]  yourself yeah you're not going to have to wait now for your kids to be destroyed no no you're not
[02:51:23.720 --> 02:51:28.760]  absolutely and and and david very well said there i want to try to keep you five minutes in the next
[02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:35.080]  hour before sheriff richard max so we have as much time as possible to go over uh issues but but
[02:51:35.080 --> 02:51:40.360]  i really do see the denial lifting uh people a lot of them don't have you know even a partial
[02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:45.400]  view of what's going on but they know something's wrong and that's why i challenge people to don't
[02:51:45.400 --> 02:51:49.800]  expect you're going to save the world by yourself or overnight hollywood pushes that image of arnold
[02:51:49.800 --> 02:51:54.840]  sorts and agar or john wane saving everybody and people always look to me they look to you others
[02:51:54.840 --> 02:52:00.120]  you know ron paul you got to save us no it's that act of defiance that act of awakening that act of
[02:52:00.120 --> 02:52:05.640]  courage resistance is victory and it's understanding the enemy and it's everybody speaking out you
[02:52:05.640 --> 02:52:11.560]  know one little cricket isn't very loud but you get a field of those it is a deafening roar and
[02:52:11.560 --> 02:52:17.560]  we're a lot bigger and more powerful than a cricket and we've all just got to do little things every
[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:24.600]  day and realize what's going on and this system will come to a halt and they know that and they
[02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:30.440]  are desperate to throw us into a crisis to make themselves matter to make us beat ourselves on
[02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:35.400]  their government on their corporate structure and so many people within their system are starting
[02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:40.600]  to defect so many people that have become powerful off their system call me contact me talk to me off
[02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:45.080]  record and they say i wish i would have known this i wish i so many people that even work for the
[02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:50.840]  system are compartmentalized and now through my broadcast your work and others they can finally
[02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:56.680]  see the larger paradigm around them from the cog that they filled and so by getting that full
[02:52:56.680 --> 02:53:02.200]  spectrum analysis they can then see the full spectrum dominance that the globalist have built
[02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:07.400]  i mean roth cop who we had on the show who wrote superclass says there's less than six thousand
[02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:14.440]  people that rule the world and only 20 families that they serve so this is now admitted publicly
[02:53:14.440 --> 02:53:20.840]  and and and we can defeat these people we must defeat these people i've got two words to say
[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:28.680]  hindra arneson who's uh come out and and and done so much great work exposing what bp are doing in
[02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:34.840]  the gulf of mexico and how the the whole cleanup stuff is a sham how the the fishermen and other
[02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:40.360]  people are being exploited and treated appallingly now they've lost their uh their way of life they
[02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:47.560]  have to search uh bp and bp's not sending them checks that was yeah yeah she is a shining light
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:54.440]  of what can be done a few a few days ago a week or so ago i mean she was a mother and now she's
[02:53:54.440 --> 02:54:00.280]  standing up to these people and doing a magnificent job and anybody can do it it's just and if they
[02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:06.840]  arrest her it's gonna backfire and if they arrest her it's gonna backfire yeah of course and you know
[02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:11.960]  no one said it was going to be easy i mean i mean this is the question are we going to draw the line
[02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:17.960]  now alex and and take the challenges uh and sacrifices that that takes to say here and no
[02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:24.120]  further are we going to wait a bit a bit longer until they get more and more uh control and try to
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:29.560]  do it then and when this agenda is further down the road than it is now all right then a bit further
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:35.560]  than when are we actually going to say enough you know because you know it's like um uh you know
[02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:41.400]  that that famous phrase by the christian pastor in uh after nazi germany first they came for the
[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:45.000]  jews and i was not a jew so i did nothing then they came for the trade unionist i was not a
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:49.080]  trade unionist so i did nothing then i they came for the communist i was not a communist so i did
[02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:55.240]  nothing you know this is about all of us it's not about um one group of people one income bracket
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:55:01.560]  one race one religion these are all fault lines for uh engineered divide and rule the target is
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:07.400]  all of us so all of us need to come together put out put our hands together put our minds together
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:12.920]  and and say here and no further when we stop cooperating with the system the system cannot
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:18.760]  operate they cannot operate the system without our acquiescence we must stop acquiescing and we
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:24.040]  must do it now human race get off your knees we have been there for long enough no more
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:29.080]  well the human race is getting up off its knees and that's why the system is howling
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:35.480]  uh with anger um let's get into the police state and the minutes we've got left david and i want
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:41.640]  to hold you five over if you can do it okay uh but uh i mean the police state it's even shocking me
[02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:46.280]  how fast they're moving we have now discovered just today this is unbelievably important news
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:52.520]  that all over the country not just new york but illinois you name it the military marines army
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:58.840]  national guard are arresting citizens nationwide with police and this has been going on for several
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:04.840]  years and i wasn't even aware now they're putting it out on tv like it's a good thing i mean again
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:10.520]  i didn't even know the magnitude david this is incredible yeah and it is what i call over the
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:15.640]  years the the totalitarian tiptoe um where you're you're at a and you know you're going to z but
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:21.560]  if you go in too big a leap then people um look up and say what's going on because um the change
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:27.720]  in you in your your society is is is so blatantly obvious so they do it in in steps but of course
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:32.520]  the nearer they get to the goal the steps get quicker and quicker because it's a simple equation
[02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:37.400]  the more you centralize power the more power you then have to centralize even quicker and that's
[02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:43.960]  that's why the the um momentum of centralization and dictatorship gets faster and faster because
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:48.040]  the more power you have the quicker you can push it on the more power you have the quicker you can
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:53.400]  push it on and with this is why we reached the point now where they've centralized so much power
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:59.000]  in so many areas of our lives that they can now push this this whole agenda on across a great
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:05.800]  spectrum of subjects and areas of our and they use every new crisis as a way to say no media no
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:10.840]  local officials uh no one's allowed you know you're not getting your checks for the fishing we've
[02:57:10.840 --> 02:57:15.080]  shut down uh you know you're not allowed to have a gun you're not allowed to protect yourself and
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:20.680]  we're like where's the law and they said we don't need any stinking law yeah what what they've done
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:25.560]  in in a series of steps getting faster and faster is these take away the checks and balances the
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:30.520]  checks and balances the checks and balances they did it most blatantly with uh the checks and balances
[02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:36.120]  they took away to stop the uh free for all in the financial um markets the financial industry and
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:43.080]  look look what that led to and every single time one of these checks and balances has been uh suggested
[02:57:43.080 --> 02:57:48.680]  to be taken away every time the the people that could have stood up to that and thought well you
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:53.560]  know i'm not even can't be bothered all this i have no power to do that what can i do then they
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:59.640]  have played a part in where we've reached now so can we learn from that please and say okay
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:04.520]  we've made mistakes in the past when we didn't stand up to what we should have stood up to
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:09.000]  and so we better learn from those mistakes now and start standing up here because if we don't
[02:58:09.560 --> 02:58:11.640]  then it's going to be a lot more difficult down the road
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:17.240]  David Ike is our guest we're going to do five more minutes with him and then Sheriff Richard

[03:00:02.840 --> 03:00:07.240]  all right we're in the final now we've got Sheriff Richard Mack coming up after this
[03:00:07.240 --> 03:00:11.560]  break but David Ike is our guest for another five minutes and I was here on the break I said
[03:00:11.560 --> 03:00:15.960]  what do you think's most important to finish off with and he said Albert Pike's letter and I've
[03:00:15.960 --> 03:00:21.960]  read his book Morals and Dogma of course this letter is reported to be at the British Naval
[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:28.200]  Museum he was a Confederate general the founder of the Klan a British agent trying to break up the
[03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:33.320]  U.S. with the Civil War and all of that's been confirmed but this letter is just amazing the
[03:00:33.320 --> 03:00:36.760]  way it predicted everything they've done so go over some of that letter the three phases in
[03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:43.000]  the last five minutes David go ahead well Albert Pike who of course was a massive massive freemason
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:51.160]  an absolute freemasonic god because his statue is in Washington DC right next to Washington
[03:00:51.160 --> 03:00:56.200]  DC police headquarters which is quite appropriate I would say we're dealing with freemasonry
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:01:01.400]  and it's alleged that he wrote this letter to a guy called Mazzini a very infamous Illuminati
[03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:08.040]  operative and he predicted in this letter three world wars that were coming it was
[03:01:08.040 --> 03:01:16.200]  alleged to have been sent in or written in 1871 and the first world war he talks about the overthrow
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:24.680]  of the Zars in Russia and making the country a fortress of atheist communism etc he talks about
[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:32.440]  bringing the British and Germanic Germanic empires into the war the second world war
[03:01:32.440 --> 03:01:37.160]  must be fermented by taking advantage of the differences between the fascists and the political
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:43.960]  Zionists and talks about things that happened then but the point that it leads to is the third
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:49.720]  world war which really I mean I've been saying for years that's the plan which it is and
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:56.120]  the description in the letter of the third world war is absolutely describing the period
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:02:01.800]  we're going through now he says this the third world war must be fermented by taking advantage
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:08.200]  of the differences caused by the azion to azion to of the Illuminati between the political Zionists
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:13.000]  and the leaders of the Islamic world the more must be conducted in such a way that Islam the
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:17.720]  muslim arabic world and political Zionism the state of Israel mutually destroy each other
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:22.840]  meanwhile the other nations once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the
[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:28.840]  point of complete physical moral spiritual and economic exhaustion we shall unleash the nihilists
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:35.000]  and atheists we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:41.160]  to the nations the effect of absolute atheism origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil
[03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:46.600]  then everywhere the citizens obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolution
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:51.160]  race will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitude dissolution
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:56.680]  with christianity whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:02.440]  anxious for an ideal but without knowing where to render its adoration will receive the true light
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:07.000]  through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of lucifer brought finally out into
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:11.960]  the public view this manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will
[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:16.440]  follow the destruction of christianity and atheism both conquered and exterminated at the same time
[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:23.000]  and he talks about the fact that they're going to make in effect the the the global society so
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:30.600]  full of turmoil so full of upheaval that the people will turn to the the few the cabal and say
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:37.080]  save us from it and the cabal will then say well to do that we must do this and we know in 1919
[03:03:37.080 --> 03:03:42.680]  these are confirmed lord millner repeated it about creating a germanic superstate to start a new war
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:47.320]  and we know they used world war one for the league of nations we have the carnegie documents about
[03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:52.920]  world war two being engineered i mean i mean this is real yeah i mean millner was the uh the head of
[03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:57.720]  a uh a secret society in london called the round table which spawned the trial actual commission
[03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:03.400]  and the uh cfr council of foreign relations the royal intrusive international affairs it spawned
[03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:08.680]  of course uh the club of rome the bill the berg group eventually and and david we're almost out of
[03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:15.640]  time do you agree out front house of rock child is at the absolute center of this um in in in the
[03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:20.120]  human world if you like and david we're almost out of time you've agreed to come back on sooner

[03:04:28.520 --> 03:04:33.640]  direction oh exactly that's that's always been that's always been the plan three world wars to
[03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:39.720]  change the world um to to a global fascist dictatorship we do not have to play their game

[03:08:28.760 --> 03:08:35.640]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live thank you so much for joining us today and we've got
[03:08:35.640 --> 03:08:41.080]  here in the final 52 minutes of this radio broadcast we have sheriff richard mac author
[03:08:41.080 --> 03:08:46.280]  speaker former sheriff richard mac has served in a wide variety of roles and over the course of his
[03:08:46.280 --> 03:08:51.480]  nearly 20 year career in law enforcement which began in provo utah that began his career with a
[03:08:51.480 --> 03:08:58.680]  provo police department and of course he then became a sheriff and he of course um was involved
[03:08:58.680 --> 03:09:04.360]  in a famous supreme court case uh defending the second amendment and now he's traveling all over
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:10.920]  the country in high demand educating people about the tenth amendment the eleventh amendment the
[03:09:10.920 --> 03:09:16.920]  the ninth amendment the power of states rights and the fact that the legislature creates the
[03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:25.240]  county cities are then chartered under the state we have the cities trying to take over uh the states
[03:09:25.240 --> 03:09:30.600]  now uh i mean that's basically what's happening you have cities trying to take over the counties
[03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:35.480]  which is an extension of the state and so this is completely backwards it's just like globalists
[03:09:35.480 --> 03:09:41.640]  have come into austin and they have financed austin raising a 2.6 billion dollar tax doubling
[03:09:41.640 --> 03:09:46.600]  our energy cost in the next three years they're seizing mopak to put toll roads on it admittedly
[03:09:46.600 --> 03:09:52.920]  illegal it's an existing road uh but they don't care i mean because the cities aren't following
[03:09:52.920 --> 03:09:57.480]  the tenth amendment they have been taken over just like the federal government's been taken over
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:03.160]  so we've got our had them off at the past taking our counties and our states back so it's not just
[03:10:03.160 --> 03:10:08.280]  tenth amendment nullification of unconstitutional federal laws and taxes that's moving forward
[03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:11.800]  and you're seeing that of course with arizona saying they're going to defend the border down there
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:18.840]  but it's expanding to uh now the county sheriffs as well and for you know over a decade sheriff
[03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:23.560]  richard mac has been exposing this he also has a book on the subject but but a sheriff before we
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:28.600]  go any further and get into that talk about the state of the second amendment and for folks that
[03:10:28.600 --> 03:10:35.400]  aren't aware of it your uh your supreme court uh case and your take uh on what the supreme court
[03:10:35.400 --> 03:10:41.640]  ruled on a few weeks ago uh but uh good to have you here with us well thanks alex it's always
[03:10:41.640 --> 03:10:47.240]  great to be with you and i appreciate you giving me some time today and uh man yes i am really busy
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:54.120]  and i'll be uh in fresno this weekend and on monday i go to amarillo uh and we're gonna have
[03:10:54.120 --> 03:11:02.040]  several uh sheriffs there and i'm teaching my uh constitution class for peace officers there uh to
[03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:07.880]  public and uh peace officers alike and i'm doing that all across the country and i really do feel
[03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:13.960]  that the uh the title of my book the county sheriff america's last hope uh really basically
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:20.680]  tells it all uh that's a state sovereignty issue arizona is now exemplifying the power of state
[03:11:20.680 --> 03:11:27.880]  sovereignty um it is the only answer left i don't see any other recourse for the states or for
[03:11:27.880 --> 03:11:35.000]  personal freedom uh other than states standing against the incursions of the federal government
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:39.080]  sheriff i want to i mean i want to get to that in a moment but i want to go back first to your
[03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:43.400]  history for folks who may not know who you are when a lot of new stations since you were last
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:47.880]  on with this and oh yeah kind of talk about your awakening so other officers can you know
[03:11:47.880 --> 03:11:53.080]  basically see it from that perspective and then let's get into your uh supreme court case
[03:11:53.080 --> 03:11:56.600]  and where you see the second amendment being then we'll spend the rest of the hour
[03:11:56.600 --> 03:12:02.440]  on the states rights movement all right well fantastic uh well when i was uh elected sheriff
[03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:09.720]  here in southern arizona it was a grand county back in 1988 and i was reelected in 1992 and then
[03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:15.000]  the brady bill came out in nineteen uh well it was signed into law by bill clinton at the end of
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:24.120]  1993 and it went into effect february of 1994 and uh the key uh part of that whole thing is is that
[03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:30.920]  there was a component it within the brady bill that required local officials and it was in most
[03:12:30.920 --> 03:12:38.520]  cases the sheriff to conduct background checks on citizens before they could buy a gun so we're being
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:44.840]  forced uh under a threat of arrest uh there was no money attached to this alec says you'll recall
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:51.880]  but there was a threat of arrest if we failed to comply so this is the first time in us history
[03:12:51.880 --> 03:12:58.280]  that the united states congress wished to uh compel and commandeer the office of the sheriffs
[03:12:58.920 --> 03:13:05.800]  for federal bidding so this is the picture this is the perspective local officials elected by four
[03:13:05.800 --> 03:13:11.880]  and of the people to serve their needs and to serve their constitutional rights are now being
[03:13:12.680 --> 03:13:19.960]  uh dragooned as one of the judges called it we're now being dragooned into federal service
[03:13:19.960 --> 03:13:25.640]  and forced to violate our oath of office and to violate the rights of our citizens to keep
[03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:32.920]  in their arms and if we don't do it they threaten to arrest us you're being pressed into service
[03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:39.640]  you're being literally shanghai enslaved drug on uh to the to the federal reservation with an
[03:13:39.640 --> 03:13:45.160]  unconstitutional law thank god it's it's you know to some extent been thrown out right but still
[03:13:45.160 --> 03:13:50.520]  there uh you know some remnants i mean this is amazing that this is going on and it's an unfunded
[03:13:50.520 --> 03:13:57.240]  mandate right it's literally indentured servitude i mean there's so many issues here continue well
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:14:03.080]  and uh it's funny that you mentioned uh indentured servitude because i actually filed on the 13th amendment
[03:14:03.720 --> 03:14:11.080]  which was you know i get you know just what you said you have unlawful servitude yes and uh
[03:14:11.080 --> 03:14:15.960]  to the federal government and the federal government cannot tell your sheriff what to do
[03:14:15.960 --> 03:14:21.640]  there is no one not the epa not the fbi not the president of the united states and i don't care
[03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:27.240]  who the president is i don't care if it's george washington himself he has no reporting to tell
[03:14:27.240 --> 03:14:32.120]  your sheriff or your local officials what to do that she that's why they usually that's the whole
[03:14:32.120 --> 03:14:38.040]  point of the states and and and if we allow the feds to tell us what size toilet we can have and
[03:14:38.040 --> 03:14:43.400]  what our kids can eat and what the sheriff can do i mean why even have states exactly that's
[03:14:43.400 --> 03:14:49.000]  that's a key point and so now the states can't even control their own land or their own resources
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:55.400]  uh in fact arizona nebat in utah are all about 85 percent owned by the federal government my county
[03:14:55.400 --> 03:15:00.120]  of graham county arizona is 95 percent owned by the federal government i wonder when we're
[03:15:00.120 --> 03:15:05.160]  going to wake up and say you know this isn't arizona we're federal enclave number 48 because
[03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:12.200]  we were the 48th state uh so it's time that the uh governors of every state tell the federal
[03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:18.600]  government to get out and my case can prove it now what i did is i said look i'm not going to go
[03:15:18.600 --> 03:15:23.880]  along uh there's no way that i'm going to violate my oath for the federal government for the clinton
[03:15:23.880 --> 03:15:29.160]  administration for this stupid thing called the bradyville and so i was the first sheriff in the
[03:15:29.160 --> 03:15:35.320]  united states to file a lawsuit against my own government and uh the decision was just between
[03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:41.960]  me and my wife and the lord that was all it was and the next day uh the historical perspective of
[03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:47.320]  this is that i called the n r a i had no place else to go i wasn't a member of anything i wasn't
[03:15:47.320 --> 03:15:52.680]  a member of the n r a i'm still not today but i called them and i said what can i do to stop this
[03:15:52.680 --> 03:15:57.560]  and they said uh we've already been working on this case and we needed a sheriff to call so we
[03:15:57.560 --> 03:16:02.920]  could have standing and i said well uh let's do it i want my own lawyer though and they recommended
[03:16:02.920 --> 03:16:08.200]  the lawyer for me that i hired personally out here in arizona by the name of dave hardy he worked
[03:16:08.200 --> 03:16:13.960]  with the n r a lawyers and we got this thing filed the very day the bradyville took effect on february
[03:16:13.960 --> 03:16:22.040]  28 1994 then some other sheriff joined the case and there was only five or six uh that came in
[03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:28.440]  sheriff prince from montana and i ended up at the united states supreme court in december of 1996
[03:16:28.440 --> 03:16:36.360]  and on june 27 1997 the united states supreme court ruled that the bradyville was indeed unconstitutional
[03:16:36.360 --> 03:16:41.080]  that the federal government cannot tell the states what to do that they cannot and this is in the
[03:16:41.080 --> 03:16:47.880]  ruling itself and let me let me tell you what this is so they indentured so they indentured the gun
[03:16:47.880 --> 03:16:53.320]  dealers instead and it should be thrown out on that but the point is you took action you sued
[03:16:53.320 --> 03:16:58.280]  you got involved americans want to know what solutions are everybody just start standing
[03:16:58.280 --> 03:17:03.720]  up the feds will win lose will draw but we know if we lay down we're going to lose go ahead well
[03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:08.680]  that's right and uh and listen to this i mean this was so well hidden from the public and bill
[03:17:08.680 --> 03:17:15.000]  clinton made the media go along with him and making sure that the citizens of this country
[03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:20.840]  never heard what this decision really did now listen to this this is the order of the court
[03:17:21.640 --> 03:17:28.360]  the federal government may neither issue directives requiring the states even to address particular
[03:17:28.360 --> 03:17:34.840]  problems nor command the state's officers or those of their political subdivisions and you
[03:17:34.840 --> 03:17:41.240]  just did you just addressed what those are cities and counties to administer or enforce
[03:17:42.200 --> 03:17:51.240]  a federal regulatory program such commands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional
[03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:56.760]  system of dual sovereignty and what does that say what that's a supreme court ruling that you never
[03:17:56.760 --> 03:18:01.960]  hear about what does that say for cap and trade what does that say with the feds showing up on
[03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:07.560]  shore in louisiana mississippi florida alabama now texas telling county commissioners and sheriffs
[03:18:07.560 --> 03:18:12.920]  they can't be on the beach some little some little bp goon i mean that's why this stuff's
[03:18:12.920 --> 03:18:17.960]  important because i mean that's what the 11th amendment says you know you have foreign powers
[03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:23.480]  coming by off presidents and congress we've got to have state rights so they can't have bp i mean
[03:18:23.480 --> 03:18:27.800]  what's next is bp gonna tell us move out of our house they're gonna move in next we got to give
[03:18:27.800 --> 03:18:35.560]  our daughters to bp like prima noctua 600 years ago in england yeah prima noctua was uh yeah you're
[03:18:35.560 --> 03:18:41.880]  starting to wonder because they're sure raping our land all the time now it also says a lot about
[03:18:41.880 --> 03:18:47.480]  nationalized socialistic health care alex as you well know because if if the states cannot
[03:18:47.480 --> 03:18:53.400]  be forced to participate in a federal regulatory program then we have 30 states suing right now
[03:18:53.400 --> 03:19:00.680]  that don't need to sue at all all they need to do is ask for summary judgment based on our case
[03:19:01.400 --> 03:19:07.240]  this case already proves that nationalized socialistic health care is unconstitutional and
[03:19:07.240 --> 03:19:12.920]  the states do not have to go along and but the romans knew that roads were key to controlling
[03:19:12.920 --> 03:19:19.080]  areas that's why all roads led to rome in the old world 2000 plus years ago uh that's why they
[03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:23.960]  brought in nafta super highways and the federal highways now they can tax and control those and
[03:19:23.960 --> 03:19:29.880]  control the communities they take our tax money send it to washington then build the roads it's
[03:19:29.880 --> 03:19:34.600]  incredible sheriff mac amazing that's why i wanted to go over that key supreme court ruling that you
[03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:39.320]  got uh to show the power of the individual the power of the ruling and illustrate the tent
[03:19:39.320 --> 03:19:43.800]  amendment now we're going to come back and talk about state powers with the borders and everything
[03:19:43.800 --> 03:19:48.280]  else and not just to take over the legislatures that's our right and duty but the sheriff's

[03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:08.600]  fact that the feds are doing this is treason by every measurement and so that is available at info

[03:25:19.400 --> 03:25:24.280]  you want solutions as what we're all about at info wars dot com all right sheriff mac this is a
[03:25:24.280 --> 03:25:30.440]  short segment but you've got the floor let's break down your metamorphosis your awakening to the
[03:25:30.440 --> 03:25:38.520]  tenth amendment and that leading you now to be one of the main leaders really carrying the torch
[03:25:38.520 --> 03:25:46.600]  of freedom and and and having people rediscover the power of the state and particularly the sheriff
[03:25:46.600 --> 03:25:54.520]  another key battlefront that we're on yeah it is that and like i say it's uh i think it's our only
[03:25:54.520 --> 03:26:01.560]  hope left now i'm reading from a little pocket size brief of the case and if anybody would
[03:26:01.560 --> 03:26:06.520]  like to get that it's called the victory for state sovereignty the mac prince versus us a case
[03:26:07.160 --> 03:26:13.480]  and uh it's available at my website and it's a sheriff mac dot com you can also get the book
[03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:18.840]  the county sheriff america's last hope which everyone should have a copy of both of these
[03:26:18.840 --> 03:26:24.840]  this little booklet that i have in my hand that i'm reviewing with you right now regarding this case
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:30.920]  uh the most powerful and monumental tenth amendment decision in the history of our country
[03:26:30.920 --> 03:26:37.480]  this was all about states rights it talks about the epa being unconstitutional it talks about the
[03:26:37.480 --> 03:26:43.640]  states not being puppets of the ventriloquist congress it talks about the supremacy clause
[03:26:43.640 --> 03:26:49.080]  and that is a key component of this whole thing because brock obama is saying he wants to sue
[03:26:49.080 --> 03:26:56.360]  arizona on the supremacy clause well just as calia already says that the supremacy clause does not
[03:26:56.360 --> 03:27:03.080]  give the federal government supremacy it says that the constitution is supreme not the federal
[03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:09.240]  government and that's a huge difference and one of the key components of this case is that the
[03:27:09.240 --> 03:27:14.920]  decision is based on this and it's just calia who wrote the decision says this over and over in the
[03:27:14.920 --> 03:27:23.480]  decision and i quote state legislatures are not subject to federal direction and quote so if we
[03:27:23.480 --> 03:27:29.960]  are not subject to federal direction and if we indeed as this case says if the states are indeed
[03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:35.800]  sovereign then that means that the federal government is not our boss they cannot tell us
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:42.040]  what to do they cannot issue directives to the states they cannot control our land our water
[03:27:42.040 --> 03:27:48.520]  our education our health care or anything else that they're trying to shove down our throats
[03:27:48.520 --> 03:27:53.640]  so where do we go to make sure that we know and understand this the same place i went now alex
[03:27:53.640 --> 03:27:59.880]  you mentioned i was a rookie cop in brobo utah when i was there i made a huge mistake i actually
[03:27:59.880 --> 03:28:08.120]  read the constitution i took my oath of office after that very seriously i dedicated are you there
[03:28:08.120 --> 03:28:12.440]  yes sir okay good i thought my phone went dead there i didn't ever click go ahead okay good
[03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:19.160]  but uh i i made a commitment to myself that i would never go against the constitution that i would
[03:28:19.160 --> 03:28:24.840]  uphold and defend the constitution just like i promised to do and if we wake up local officials
[03:28:24.840 --> 03:28:32.200]  to that uh principle that they'll keep their word when they swear an oath an oath that is
[03:28:32.200 --> 03:28:37.720]  required by article six of our own constitution that the founding fathers put in there that all
[03:28:37.720 --> 03:28:45.080]  state and local officials would be required to swear allegiance not to the king not to the president
[03:28:45.080 --> 03:28:52.120]  not to some bureaucracy not to the governor but to the people that we promised that we would uphold
[03:28:52.120 --> 03:28:57.960]  and defend their constitutional rights and if we had everybody in local government doing just that
[03:28:57.960 --> 03:29:04.520]  if every sheriff in fact if we only had three or four or five hundred of the three thousand
[03:29:04.520 --> 03:29:09.960]  sheriffs in this country actually keeping their oath and defending the constitution against all
[03:29:09.960 --> 03:29:15.880]  enemies both foreign and domestic if we actually had that alex we would get our freedom back tomorrow
[03:29:15.880 --> 03:29:20.600]  oh it would paralyze the new world order and that's why they're demonizing you that's why
[03:29:20.600 --> 03:29:24.840]  they're so scared and that's why everybody's got to go to your website and get your book and give

[03:36:38.120 --> 03:36:43.560]  these little booklets and every state legislator every county commissioner every state and local
[03:36:43.560 --> 03:36:49.880]  official should see this little booklet this the victory for state sovereignty because it reviews
[03:36:49.880 --> 03:36:54.920]  what we've been talking about here on the show and it's a pocket size form and in 10 minutes
[03:36:54.920 --> 03:37:00.520]  your state rep or your local county commissioner or your local sheriff can see what this case
[03:37:00.520 --> 03:37:05.560]  actually did to restore state sovereignty in this okay we're going to talk about your plan
[03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:10.120]  and versus what the feds are doing the alternative here in a moment but i want to
[03:37:10.120 --> 03:37:16.600]  since you are a sheriff from the west i want to you know draw this analogy here and then get
[03:37:16.600 --> 03:37:20.840]  involved with what's happening on the arizona border right now in this act of treason by obama
[03:37:21.560 --> 03:37:26.920]  but but going back we've all seen westerns alex let me let me just reiterate something that you
[03:37:26.920 --> 03:37:32.920]  said this is about solutions this isn't just talking about things that are horrible and going on in
[03:37:32.920 --> 03:37:38.520]  our country we could do that till next year and still not finish this is about a solution that is
[03:37:38.520 --> 03:37:47.240]  reasonable effective quick and doable and constitutional and it's the law and we're
[03:37:47.240 --> 03:37:50.520]  going to get into that moment but i want to just give people so they have a mental image of what's
[03:37:50.520 --> 03:37:54.920]  happened so they can have respect for themselves again okay we've all seen those westerns and
[03:37:54.920 --> 03:37:59.560]  matt dylan and john wane and i always thought growing up as a kid you know those are just movies
[03:37:59.560 --> 03:38:04.200]  where where there's a corrupt town with bad guys in it robin and rapin and you know oppressing and
[03:38:04.200 --> 03:38:09.080]  taking farmers water and taking their daughters and finally people stand up but or i thought it
[03:38:09.080 --> 03:38:14.680]  was a louis lemore novel now i've read a lot of histories of the west and things that happened
[03:38:14.680 --> 03:38:18.760]  uh in this country and even after world war two in a tennessee town when the vets came home and
[03:38:18.760 --> 03:38:23.880]  there was a corrupt government they had to run them out but this is what happened in 1776 it's what
[03:38:23.880 --> 03:38:28.760]  it's what andrew jackson fought against it's always a repeat of the scallywags the carpet
[03:38:28.760 --> 03:38:34.600]  baggers the corrupt interests that come in uh the rockefeller you know men sending pinkerton
[03:38:34.600 --> 03:38:39.880]  security like in that uh clonieswood movie where the mining town and the in the railroad men come
[03:38:39.880 --> 03:38:45.560]  and are killing people to take their claims that that's a composite of thousands of true events
[03:38:45.560 --> 03:38:51.160]  but more often than not people stood up because they were armed and fought back and you know the
[03:38:51.160 --> 03:38:56.200]  issue here is what's happening with the feds what's happening in our society we see that hollywood
[03:38:56.200 --> 03:39:01.800]  image of the town finally standing up that's what america is that's what our counties are that's what
[03:39:01.800 --> 03:39:06.840]  our societies are and people you've just got to get angry you got to start talking you got to turn
[03:39:06.840 --> 03:39:11.640]  the television set off you got to get to the commissioner's court you got to get with others
[03:39:11.640 --> 03:39:16.600]  you got to get angry and you got to get the facts and the constitution because i'm going to say it
[03:39:16.600 --> 03:39:22.120]  again it is like a stake through the heart of these vampires because our country was born
[03:39:22.120 --> 03:39:26.600]  in the fight for liberty we've been through this over and over again we're not the first people
[03:39:26.600 --> 03:39:32.840]  to go through this and we've got the blueprint of how to beat these people we do and it's it's every
[03:39:32.840 --> 03:39:41.320]  bit uh constitutional it's every bit uh lawful and uh it it is a peaceful process uh this will not
[03:39:41.320 --> 03:39:48.200]  hurt anyone uh except the traders in washington dc there is no answer in washington dc uh it is
[03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:53.880]  the most corrupt place on the face of the planet but we can make headway uh in our counties and
[03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:58.840]  we can take america back county by county and state by state but it's got to start with you
[03:39:58.840 --> 03:40:03.800]  every one of your listeners you've got to know and understand the principle of state sovereignty
[03:40:03.800 --> 03:40:08.920]  your sheriff has got to know and understand the principle of state sovereignty and local autonomy
[03:40:08.920 --> 03:40:16.280]  and that's exactly what my lawsuit was about now judge john roll said and that's also quoted in my
[03:40:16.280 --> 03:40:21.480]  little booklet that i have here in my hand the victory for state sovereignty he said mac is thus
[03:40:21.480 --> 03:40:28.200]  forced to choose between keeping his oath or obeying the act subjecting himself to possible
[03:40:28.200 --> 03:40:33.640]  sanctions well my question is to every peace officer and sheriff in this country when you are
[03:40:33.640 --> 03:40:40.040]  forced by the federal government and the lawmakers around you to choose between your oath or following
[03:40:40.040 --> 03:40:45.640]  laws and statutes which one are you going to do are you going to side with the people and freedom
[03:40:45.640 --> 03:40:52.120]  or are you going to continue to acquiesce and follow the uh well the founders had a swear to this
[03:40:52.120 --> 03:40:59.000]  oath because they wanted to point out this is the real law this is the power this is the america
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:04.520]  this is the republic not what some flim flammer comes along later with them and that's what
[03:41:04.520 --> 03:41:09.720]  thomas jefferson george washington said over and over again you got to stick to this not what lawyers
[03:41:09.720 --> 03:41:15.400]  come and invent later or what they try to twist out of it that's exactly correct and this is all
[03:41:15.400 --> 03:41:21.240]  foundational it's all fundamental and that's my first page in my book i'm glad you you talked
[03:41:21.240 --> 03:41:26.200]  about thomas jefferson because i quote him on the very first page of my book and he says when all
[03:41:26.200 --> 03:41:31.400]  government shall be drawn to washington as the center of all power it will render powerless
[03:41:31.400 --> 03:41:37.080]  the checks provided and become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated
[03:41:37.080 --> 03:41:42.840]  the question is alec to whom can your people turn the people in austin texas or the people in
[03:41:42.840 --> 03:41:48.600]  southern arizona or the people throughout this country who can they turn to for peace safety
[03:41:48.600 --> 03:41:54.600]  and protection when government from washington dc has become venal and oppressive and the answer
[03:41:54.600 --> 03:42:01.720]  is your county sheriff and your local officials all right well let's describe the true role of
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:06.360]  the sheriff because people never been taught this i mean versus what's happening all over the country
[03:42:06.360 --> 03:42:11.720]  where the feds come in and we'll put tens of millions of dollars in to and buy off sheriffs
[03:42:11.720 --> 03:42:19.640]  and counties to get the city to absorb the county uh when the county is the unit of the state i mean
[03:42:19.640 --> 03:42:24.520]  this is treason i keep using that word they know exactly what they're this is this is federal
[03:42:25.160 --> 03:42:31.720]  conquest of the states uh in a very sneaky way well my case even addresses that and scalia brings
[03:42:31.720 --> 03:42:38.920]  up the issue of uh compromising local authority in order to take uh federal grants and federal
[03:42:38.920 --> 03:42:45.880]  money the federal government is very wise uh let's not pretend anything here uh this plan of attack
[03:42:45.880 --> 03:42:53.320]  to destroy state sovereignty and local autonomy and the power of the county has been an orchestrated
[03:42:53.320 --> 03:42:59.080]  event uh they've even voted sheriffs out in connecticut there are no more sheriffs in connecticut
[03:42:59.080 --> 03:43:04.680]  massachusetts is trying to do the same thing ohio now has one county where the sheriff is no longer
[03:43:04.680 --> 03:43:09.560]  elected but appointed and every sheriff that i've talked to and i've been talking to hundreds of
[03:43:09.560 --> 03:43:15.800]  sheriffs uh this past year every one of them uh well not every one of them but there's about a
[03:43:15.800 --> 03:43:20.680]  half of them that are worried if they take strong stands against the federal government and do what
[03:43:20.680 --> 03:43:27.240]  my books suggest that uh they might lose federal funding and again that's a coward's mindset we've
[03:43:27.240 --> 03:43:32.360]  gotten to this point of the sheriff being abolished because the enemy is attacking the constitution
[03:43:32.360 --> 03:43:37.880]  in our republic and instead of saying oh i better cower you know for the five years or whatever you're
[03:43:37.880 --> 03:43:43.320]  in you want to think about your kids and grandkids and you should get up there and stand up i mean
[03:43:43.320 --> 03:43:48.280]  how do we come from the toughest roughest smartest people to a bunch of castrated cowards i tell you
[03:43:48.280 --> 03:43:53.640]  those sheriffs are pathetic well it's all it's all about the money and i have said this and i say
[03:43:53.640 --> 03:43:59.160]  this in my book that anyone in this country i don't care if it's a sheriff state rep county
[03:43:59.160 --> 03:44:04.680]  commissioner or anyone else if you're willing to compromise liberty if you're willing to compromise
[03:44:04.680 --> 03:44:11.640]  the freedom of your citizens to continue to take money then you sir are the trader and you have uh
[03:44:12.280 --> 03:44:18.680]  betrayed your own people this is time to stand and and when i when i sent this book to sheriff print
[03:44:18.680 --> 03:44:24.920]  i said sheriff tell me honestly is this book true and is it the answer and he says of course it is
[03:44:24.920 --> 03:44:30.520]  the problem is you've got too many damn wimpy sheriffs and and alex that's i'm just going to
[03:44:30.520 --> 03:44:35.720]  tell her like it is if the sheriffs in this country have the courage to stand that's the only thing we
[03:44:35.720 --> 03:44:42.920]  lack now is courage within our local communities courage from county attorneys courage from county
[03:44:42.920 --> 03:44:48.600]  sheriffs and county commissioners to uphold and defend the constitution for the people and stop
[03:44:48.600 --> 03:44:55.240]  taking the money throw that yeah we don't need quasi federal deputized federal totes we need the
[03:44:55.240 --> 03:45:00.280]  counties and people not liking the feds that was back when america was free and people were smart
[03:45:00.280 --> 03:45:07.000]  i mean going back to our founding not these little pathetic totes and creatures of the feds we need
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:13.080]  men we need strong leaders who are loved in their communities to bring back true peace officers
[03:45:13.080 --> 03:45:19.080]  not these law enforcement lackeys who desecrate the constitution and enforce all this made up
[03:45:19.080 --> 03:45:23.480]  crud now i want to bring up a subject here with you uh uh while we've got you sheriff mac we'll
[03:45:23.480 --> 03:45:29.320]  have you back soon uh but i want to read to you from encyclopedia britannica and it's the same
[03:45:29.320 --> 03:45:34.040]  thing and the definition Wikipedia they've all got it high treason the definition of high treason
[03:45:34.040 --> 03:45:39.560]  participating in a war against one's country attempting to overthrow its government spying
[03:45:39.560 --> 03:45:44.520]  on its military its diplomats or its secret services for a hostile and foreign power or
[03:45:44.520 --> 03:45:49.320]  attempting to kill its head of state and it goes on are the best known types now the most classic
[03:45:49.320 --> 03:45:55.480]  archetypal is enemies inside the gates who are traders opening the drawbridge to let the enemy
[03:45:55.480 --> 03:46:01.800]  in now we've got the states 80 to 100 miles a third of arizona where you were a sheriff has
[03:46:01.800 --> 03:46:07.560]  imploded sheriff babbo is begging for help there's death threats they've killed thousands of law
[03:46:07.560 --> 03:46:12.680]  enforcement uh peace officers but they are law enforcement down in mexico in this war they're
[03:46:12.680 --> 03:46:22.360]  now literally roads highways uh the parkland uh off limits uh obama tells senator kyle treacherously
[03:46:22.360 --> 03:46:28.040]  i want to keep that crisis going so i get amnesty that's on record so we have all of this happening
[03:46:28.040 --> 03:46:33.080]  is that not high treason i have the article obama commits act of high treason sides with foreign
[03:46:33.080 --> 03:46:38.440]  power against arizona i have all the facts i have the eleventh amendment saying the feds can't sue
[03:46:38.440 --> 03:46:44.600]  a state or an individual citizen on behalf of foreign power uh or an or an alien because
[03:46:44.600 --> 03:46:48.840]  that was the first amendment they passed after the first ten because you know the states knew the
[03:46:48.840 --> 03:46:54.280]  feds could be bought off by foreign corporate powers is this not an act of treason by obama
[03:46:54.840 --> 03:47:00.440]  going in there trying to block the state when it's trying to not collapse like mexico well it is and
[03:47:00.440 --> 03:47:06.680]  not only that but there's more uh on the record uh about what obama has done now remember he brought
[03:47:07.320 --> 03:47:15.560]  presidente philippe calderon from mexico to our own united states congress inside our us capitol
[03:47:15.560 --> 03:47:23.800]  to assail and criticize our own constitution our own freedom our own country our own laws and then
[03:47:23.800 --> 03:47:29.160]  he got a standing ovation from the liberals and the leftists and the traders in washington dc
[03:47:29.160 --> 03:47:36.120]  all that was treason every bit of this you cannot show me anything that washington dc has done in the
[03:47:36.120 --> 03:47:42.920]  past 10 20 nests and get giving our authority to the wto an elected corporate board the spp that
[03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:48.120]  they kept secret the judicial watch got said we've got to keep this secret in the founding document
[03:47:48.120 --> 03:47:52.680]  uh that the president signed we got to keep this secret we got to bring a carbon tax in
[03:47:52.680 --> 03:48:00.680]  to erect a north american union government i mean that is the definition of high treason uh anytime
[03:48:00.680 --> 03:48:06.200]  that you want to destroy or have politicians who attempt or want to destroy our own constitution
[03:48:06.760 --> 03:48:12.680]  i believe the founding fathers intended that to be treason and there's only three law enforcement
[03:48:12.680 --> 03:48:17.000]  authorities granted to the federal government within article one section eight of the us
[03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:24.440]  constitution it's counterfeiting felony committed on the high seas and treason now if the fbi
[03:48:24.440 --> 03:48:29.240]  would investigate treason in this country they would never get out of washington dc for the next
[03:48:29.240 --> 03:48:34.520]  10 years and that would be one time i would tell them they probably need more manpower
[03:48:34.520 --> 03:48:39.720]  because of the treason going on in washington dc right now is absolutely phenomenal and it is
[03:48:39.720 --> 03:48:45.800]  treason and you're going back to what's happening instead of the traders and the treasonous vermin
[03:48:45.800 --> 03:48:50.440]  bought and paid for by this global new world order corporate takeover and that's what it is
[03:48:50.440 --> 03:48:54.520]  instead we've got the mayac homeland security reports that good peace officers sent us
[03:48:54.520 --> 03:49:00.440]  where the government is not doing that's a facade that they're worried about turban Arabs
[03:49:00.440 --> 03:49:05.880]  i mean that is literally just to get us to give our rights up 90 plus percent of it they are behind
[03:49:05.880 --> 03:49:11.720]  the scenes like roaches in a cheap motel spending all their time hating veterans conservatives
[03:49:11.720 --> 03:49:18.120]  libertarians gun owners ron paul myself you i mean they are just just just doing nothing
[03:49:18.120 --> 03:49:23.400]  but trying to brainwash police and sheriff's departments that we are the devil i mean that
[03:49:23.400 --> 03:49:28.200]  really shows you who these people are we're saying we want america back and they're saying
[03:49:28.200 --> 03:49:33.080]  if you got a portrait of john wane in your house you're a terrorist yeah and uh... the southern
[03:49:33.080 --> 03:49:38.280]  poverty law center i've been fighting them ever since i uh... filed my lawsuit back in 1994
[03:49:38.280 --> 03:49:44.040]  yeah they're writing those reports and oh gosh and these guys are absolutely out of control
[03:49:44.040 --> 03:49:53.720]  they are the acorn of of politics in america acorn being also a branch of the treason from
[03:49:53.720 --> 03:49:58.360]  the federal government but southern poverty law centers just like acorn they get a lot of money
[03:49:58.360 --> 03:50:05.640]  from the federal government to lie and to do just the opposite of protecting our constitution
[03:50:05.640 --> 03:50:10.040]  they want to destroy our constitution and i'm proud to be listed with you
[03:50:10.040 --> 03:50:15.800]  and other patriots of this uh... country i'm number eighteen uh... on that list
[03:50:15.800 --> 03:50:19.880]  and i'm very proud to stand with you and ron paul and chuck baldoin and
[03:50:19.880 --> 03:50:24.120]  jill banister and others uh... uh... stewart rhodes of both keepers
[03:50:24.120 --> 03:50:27.880]  and i'm proud to be uh... on the board of directors of both keepers
[03:50:27.880 --> 03:50:33.400]  and this is all boiling down to whether or not the peace officers in this country the
[03:50:33.400 --> 03:50:39.480]  sheriffs of this country will do one thing and that is to uphold and defend their oath of office
[03:50:39.480 --> 03:50:44.680]  to uphold and defend the constitution god bless you absolutely our names are on that
[03:50:45.240 --> 03:50:51.320]  john handcock and they're on that constitution that's an enemy warrant against us by these
[03:50:51.320 --> 03:50:54.360]  traders and they are traders we'll be right back with sheriff mack
[03:50:54.360 --> 03:51:05.240]  i'm afraid to answer it afraid to answer your door did you know that debt settlement
[03:51:05.240 --> 03:51:09.880]  bankruptcy and attorneys will cost you about ten times more than you would legally be required
[03:51:09.880 --> 03:51:15.240]  to pay creditors these are not ways to help you get out of debt they are expensive payment plans
[03:51:15.240 --> 03:51:20.120]  and if you're in debt already does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan

[03:57:07.160 --> 03:57:11.880]  sheriff races across the country that are concentrating on which candidate will be the most
[03:57:11.880 --> 03:57:17.800]  constitutional sheriff if you have a constitutional sheriff who will protect you from all enemies
[03:57:17.800 --> 03:57:22.200]  both foreign and domestic who will protect you from the gun grabbers and protect you from the
[03:57:22.200 --> 03:57:27.560]  globalist you will win and you will get your freedom back and it will be done peacefully

[03:57:40.440 --> 03:57:45.800]  just in the congressional candidates but in the sheriffs uh and and point out the incumbency of
[03:57:45.800 --> 03:57:52.360]  these corrupt sheriffs and get patriots in this is another major move on the chess board the next
