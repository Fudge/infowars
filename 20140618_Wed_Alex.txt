[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:20.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:31.520]  so we're here at the Sacred Heart Church again the same church we were at yesterday
[00:31.520 --> 00:35.120]  and we talked to one of the people who are working the scene here they said they were
[00:35.120 --> 00:38.240]  trying to help us out and see if they can get us an interview so we'll just wait and see what
[00:38.240 --> 00:45.040]  happens what we have here is just we're setting up an area where we can facilitate their sleeping
[00:45.040 --> 00:50.400]  quarters right and right now they're on the floor so what we did is we brought in a tent
[00:50.400 --> 00:55.760]  a regional resource that we have in the area and we're going to have them you know sleep a little
[00:55.760 --> 01:00.480]  more comfortable in the air conditions here right now let me ask you sir the people who
[01:00.480 --> 01:05.280]  your house in here where are they coming from I'm being told they're coming from Central America a
[01:05.280 --> 01:12.800]  lot of them are Central America a lot of them are younger kids with their moms for the most part
[01:12.800 --> 01:18.640]  and why Central America why is that the popular I have no idea well what happened today in particular
[01:18.640 --> 01:23.600]  is that the border patrol dropped off some they call them detainees but obviously they're not
[01:23.600 --> 01:28.960]  detained after they dropped them off and normally they have tickets or arranged transportation to
[01:28.960 --> 01:35.120]  go somewhere in the interior well today apparently for some logistical reasons some of them didn't
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.720]  hadn't had transportation arranged or their transportation is tomorrow right and so we're
[01:40.720 --> 01:46.640]  having to find places to shelter them for tonight so we access some resources that we have we're
[01:46.640 --> 01:51.600]  going to shelter them here tonight so why is the border patrol bringing them here they're not bringing
[01:51.600 --> 01:56.640]  them here they're bringing them to our bus terminal because that's where the border patrol understands
[01:56.640 --> 02:02.240]  that they have transportation to go to the interior right so the dropping them off is our understanding
[02:02.240 --> 02:08.320]  that they were dropped off with tickets or with vouchers for tickets um turns out some of them
[02:08.320 --> 02:13.360]  didn't tonight didn't have their ticket or didn't have their voucher or like I said their bus is
[02:13.360 --> 02:19.280]  until tomorrow so they got nowhere to stay our bus terminal bars I mean the city of McAllen
[02:19.280 --> 02:24.560]  bus terminal is not a 24 seven operation right so we've got to put them up somewhere else so
[02:24.560 --> 02:30.080]  for tonight we're doing the best we can with this resource which thankfully one of our neighboring
[02:30.080 --> 02:34.480]  cities made available to us and we're going to put them up here tonight tomorrow we'll have a little
[02:34.480 --> 02:39.040]  chat with border patrol and see what's going on now I'm just curious as to what point these people
[02:39.040 --> 02:45.040]  come in contact with the border patrol do you know originally yes you'd have to ask them but I'm
[02:45.040 --> 02:49.040]  assuming it's coming across coming across the border so they so as far as you know they come
[02:49.040 --> 02:52.880]  across the border they encounter the border patrol and the border patrol brings them to a facility
[02:52.880 --> 02:56.800]  such as the bus station no they don't bring them there they take them or they initially take them
[02:56.800 --> 03:02.400]  to the border the border patrol stations yes and they detain them there and they process them there
[03:02.400 --> 03:06.800]  I mean after they process them the ones the only ones that you'll see here are family units
[03:07.360 --> 03:11.680]  that are like a mom and a couple of kids that they have determined don't pose any sort of
[03:11.680 --> 03:18.400]  security risk and have a criminal background and they've got relatives or help somewhere in the
[03:18.400 --> 03:24.480]  interior so that category of people again is our understanding they provide them a ticket right
[03:24.480 --> 03:29.040]  and then they drop the border patrol provides them a ticket that's what we were told and that's
[03:29.040 --> 03:36.800]  what I understood but obviously some of them or or they're arranging tickets with them there you
[03:36.800 --> 03:41.440]  know I mean with a relative that's paying for something I don't know it's all it's all we're
[03:41.440 --> 03:48.720]  not that it's all here you know calling back home to me you know come on over as I know is that
[03:48.720 --> 03:55.440]  until today 99% of them they got off the border patrol bus at our bus station had a ticket right
[03:55.440 --> 04:01.600]  and so all we all all the all the charitable organizations were doing was helping them
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.080]  get some clothes let them we provided showers and things like that and then put them on the bus
[04:06.080 --> 04:11.680]  and off they go so tonight's the first time we really had this even this many that we've had
[04:11.680 --> 04:17.120]  to deal with overnight well we'll try to sort it out well let me ask you this sir uh you said
[04:17.120 --> 04:21.280]  these people on county the border patrol crossing the border are any of them facing any criminal
[04:21.280 --> 04:25.520]  charges which crossing the border they're all detainees and they're all traveling with the
[04:25.520 --> 04:31.760]  understanding that they have a notice to appear uh which is a document that says you can travel
[04:31.760 --> 04:37.040]  but on such and such a day you need to appear at the immigration court and wherever the thing about
[04:37.040 --> 04:45.040]  is we aren't just going to go um they're being they're being given uh orders to appear you know
[04:45.040 --> 04:51.520]  for the uh immigration judge if they're going I don't know ladies and gentlemen we're going to
[04:51.520 --> 04:57.200]  break you just heard the facts the border patrol is shipping the illegal aliens into the us
[04:58.800 --> 05:03.600]  a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine west virginia counties this year alone
[05:03.600 --> 05:08.160]  over 300 000 people in west virginia had their drinking water contaminated what are the health
[05:08.160 --> 05:12.800]  effects of having these drugs in our drinking water it's forced medical treatment without the

[08:17.520 --> 08:33.440]  lie from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[08:38.320 --> 08:44.240]  the news has now reached red level bad lung insanity
[08:44.240 --> 08:52.960]  it is off the chart we have the attorney general the president and hillary in the last two weeks
[08:52.960 --> 08:59.040]  saying they're getting ready with executive orders to basically ban all guns from sale
[08:59.760 --> 09:03.680]  that do not have biometrics on them that they will then retroactively ban all the other guns
[09:04.640 --> 09:08.960]  she is saying the american people we have the clip are not allowed to terrorize others owning guns
[09:08.960 --> 09:14.560]  when it's the controlled corporate press and the brainwashers to use the attorney general's own
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.920]  words about brainwashing the public to fear guns they are the ones creating the perception
[09:20.560 --> 09:26.800]  and fear that there's an epidemic of gun violence when the proliferation of guns and the gun culture
[09:26.800 --> 09:33.360]  winning in most areas of the country and gun ownership exploding by the just department's
[09:33.360 --> 09:41.600]  own numbers since 1991 crime rates using guns have dropped 52 percent some of the most accurate
[09:41.600 --> 09:47.680]  statistics out there are the fbi numbers when you go to the statistician school you can look
[09:47.680 --> 09:54.640]  this up that's the world model in russia they study fbi statistics in japan they study it in
[09:54.640 --> 10:01.040]  germany they study it because that's what jager hoover was good at was setting that up
[10:01.040 --> 10:07.120]  because they're local numbers they're hard to fudge because they get compiled all over the
[10:07.120 --> 10:11.120]  country so even if one jurisdiction is manipulating numbers like chicago's been caught trying to keep
[10:11.120 --> 10:17.920]  numbers down and things it doesn't matter because overall the general crime rate comes out and is
[10:17.920 --> 10:25.280]  matched with the court numbers and the conviction numbers and the prosecutions now that said when
[10:25.280 --> 10:33.840]  hillary comes out and says quote we can't let gun control opponents hold an opinion that terrorizes
[10:33.840 --> 10:42.320]  america you see the labeling of your values of my values of freedoms values of common sense
[10:42.320 --> 10:49.840]  self-defense individual liberty libertah being demonized and that dove tells the obama saying
[10:49.840 --> 10:56.400]  look australia just had you know very harsh very strict yeah total ban except for single shot
[10:56.400 --> 11:01.040]  with a license crime rate just exploded all over the country on record the muggings the
[11:01.040 --> 11:09.360]  stabbings the rapings you can look it up the major cities are beset uh with mainly immigrant
[11:09.360 --> 11:14.160]  crime waves that are protected and coddled by the social services system and again this is how
[11:14.160 --> 11:21.200]  it's done this is how the government takes over and controls society the same model is
[11:21.200 --> 11:27.440]  being deployed here we're going to be breaking that down in a moment this morning i got up at
[11:27.440 --> 11:36.480]  about 6 a.m and at about 6 30 watch the video that is just now going up on info wars dot com
[11:37.840 --> 11:43.520]  and our reporters down there on the border are doing a bang up job but they just don't realize
[11:43.520 --> 11:50.880]  most of the time just how sensational the information is they're getting and how dangerous
[11:50.880 --> 11:56.640]  is the globalist a week ago a week and a half ago we send joe bigs and others down to the
[11:56.640 --> 12:05.920]  military bases in sandownia overrun with the legals and fox news everybody else was forced
[12:05.920 --> 12:12.000]  to run down there and cover it days after we did then we sent reporters down to the sacred heart
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.440]  church in mcallin down on the border that was housing illegals that were bus dried in to be
[12:17.440 --> 12:24.880]  deployed all over the country now there's satellite farms of media out there again the globalist
[12:24.880 --> 12:29.760]  higher so-called journalists now that it's not just that they're controlled they don't have any
[12:29.760 --> 12:37.680]  instinct for an inch and so what's happening is everywhere my reporters now go all over texas
[12:37.680 --> 12:42.160]  we're they're going to go to houston next next week and then dallas and then we're gonna i'm
[12:42.160 --> 12:47.440]  probably gonna send them to new york and virginia where the liberals are saying my god it's
[12:47.440 --> 12:52.160]  overwhelming our social services everything's collapsing i mean in one town in new york i've
[12:52.160 --> 12:56.320]  got the news today there's more than 10 000 children that have shown up in a small town
[12:57.360 --> 13:03.840]  i mean it's it's like a tsunami hit when houston gets hit by hurricanes one time i was in east texas
[13:03.840 --> 13:16.560]  150 miles at our ranch from from the hurricane and there were illegal aliens
[13:17.120 --> 13:22.800]  intense on the side of the road on ranch roads that you may see one car every 30 minutes on
[13:22.800 --> 13:29.040]  there were just illegals everywhere folks because it flooded out south texas that is basically
[13:29.040 --> 13:38.880]  mexico and latin america flesh-heating bacteria drug-resistant tv amoebas and by the way folks
[13:39.440 --> 13:43.840]  i know the medical workers that are getting the drug-resistant tv from it i know the people
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.280]  that have been in jail that are getting it i know people that have the amoebas okay okay this is
[13:49.280 --> 13:59.760]  going on it is a collapse so i get up this morning and there's a headline up there and
[13:59.760 --> 14:06.720]  then i watched the video and i had the headline changed us border patrol paying the ship illegals
[14:07.520 --> 14:13.760]  deep into the united states they go talk to the city officials the same ones that are in the news
[14:13.760 --> 14:20.960]  lotton police feds want cops to secure fort still immigrant children the feds are saying we're not
[14:20.960 --> 14:24.640]  even going to secure and we're going to let them go the ice agent who blew the whistle yesterday
[14:24.640 --> 14:29.600]  said they disgorge him at midnight our reporters were there we'll see what happened when they come
[14:29.600 --> 14:35.360]  up at the bottom of the hour and we had city officials tell us on video border patrol won't
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.760]  talk to us that yes because you know jacari we're going to put the video coming up we just play
[14:39.760 --> 14:44.480]  part of it's like why are there buses that pull right to the board patrol they get on white vans
[14:44.480 --> 14:49.200]  and then drive in to the cities and staging grounds and buses pull up there and the city
[14:49.200 --> 14:53.920]  official goes well it's all completely normal we're not doing anything wrong as he's out there at a
[14:53.920 --> 15:06.560]  tent city the border patrol gives us the voucher for greyhound bomb shell bomb shell it just went
[15:06.560 --> 15:13.680]  up on info wars dot com and my point is i go to info wars dot com now and i get a headache
[15:13.680 --> 15:18.880]  as a news director because it's so good it's so powerful it's so strong it's so cutting edge
[15:18.880 --> 15:25.280]  it's so hardcore it's breaking everything DARPA brain chips to implant false memories
[15:25.280 --> 15:29.680]  officially declassified that we're going to have brain control chips to help us cope with
[15:29.680 --> 15:33.760]  daily lives and not be depressed and you'll get your welfare check if you take the brain chip
[15:33.760 --> 15:39.840]  sci-fi is here drudge report dot com link to it boom riot control drones to shoot pepper spray
[15:39.840 --> 15:44.720]  bullets at protesters boom info wars dot com breaking that government contracts it's being
[15:44.720 --> 15:52.080]  rolled out the control attack drones are here these are like flying um dollocks from doctor who i mean
[15:52.080 --> 15:56.960]  i've entered the twilight zone and so have you hillary again we can't let gun control opponents
[15:56.960 --> 16:04.240]  hold an opinion that terrorizes america see your view terrorizes people we have been banned at all
[16:04.240 --> 16:10.560]  major military bases state guard bases and on almost all libraries by blue coat a globalist
[16:10.560 --> 16:17.040]  outfit that basically has nsa technology and works with the cia and nsa they have blocked us to
[16:17.040 --> 16:23.200]  hundreds of millions of people we're literally getting screenshots of it from the pentagon uh
[16:23.200 --> 16:30.720]  ford hood uh joint task force six and texas camp mayberry just all over the country but texas is
[16:30.720 --> 16:39.600]  really flooding us libraries bus terminals in europe wi-fi systems uh so so this is what's going on
[16:39.600 --> 16:47.040]  they're moving on all fronts right now i mean i don't even have words to describe the level
[16:47.040 --> 16:52.960]  of what's going on here and if you go to info wars dot com it just got updated and it just
[16:52.960 --> 17:01.200]  went up the off of the chart information uh and again my my on my computer it hasn't even
[17:01.840 --> 17:05.920]  refreshed yet well you guys it's refreshed on yours you put that headline on screen you just
[17:05.920 --> 17:12.080]  put up thank you so much uh there's no other radio tv broadcast like this i i'm not bragging
[17:12.080 --> 17:16.000]  it's just the guys are like octopuses in there trying to trying to get all this stuff up as
[17:16.000 --> 17:22.560]  fast as i want them to video border patrol paying the ship illegals deep into the u.s border patrol
[17:23.440 --> 17:29.600]  purchasing bus tickets vouchers for illegal immigrants while saddling border towns with
[17:29.600 --> 17:36.240]  housing burden that's a don salazar and jacari jackson it's red linked i want it moved to the
[17:36.240 --> 17:44.960]  top of info wars dot com and i want the video posted as a separate article uh with that similar
[17:44.960 --> 17:51.520]  headline and the reason i do that is it was it was up for a while with uh the headline i say
[17:51.520 --> 17:56.480]  it blows the westerly legals receiving costly taxpayer funded medical treatments but that's
[17:56.480 --> 18:03.120]  that's a big issue but not the big giant issue that the border patrol is being ordered to aid
[18:03.120 --> 18:07.440]  in the bed it's obvious in the video that they filed over the weekend where the buses pull right
[18:07.440 --> 18:16.800]  through with the mexican colors on the side of them red green and um you know the whole
[18:17.680 --> 18:21.680]  national colors and then the people get off with the churches we went and talked to admit
[18:21.680 --> 18:26.480]  our illegals they get put on vans in front of the border patrol but we go up on top more patrol
[18:26.480 --> 18:32.880]  they run up with machine guns because that's for us not for the new slaves coming in you know
[18:32.880 --> 18:38.480]  slaves that have been here a while are seen with complete contempt but kind of like in the
[18:38.480 --> 18:43.360]  old cartoons where the cat sets up its mouth like a restaurant for the mouse and puts a sign
[18:43.360 --> 18:48.240]  and a neon sign saying come in for dinner you know they want the new fresh meat in they don't
[18:48.240 --> 18:52.800]  want to know they're walking right into the cat's mouth and so you've got the police you've got the
[18:52.800 --> 18:59.840]  military you've got the border patrol all there to aid the red carpet directly in to get their

[26:32.160 --> 26:37.840]  militarizing the border to only conduit more illegals and faster and again they will all be

[27:00.080 --> 27:04.640]  executive orders they're already doing all sorts of stuff outside of law extra judicially extra
[27:04.640 --> 27:14.480]  legislatively and now hillary has come out and said it's terrorism your rights terrorize people
[27:14.480 --> 27:19.200]  and people have a right to feel safe well you have a right to your delusions that in places like
[27:19.200 --> 27:23.200]  chicago and new york you're safe because they ban the guns when you have the highest crime rates

[27:50.080 --> 27:56.000]  alien high-tech invasion to incrementally take over shut off the farms shut off the industry
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.920]  break down the family destroy humanity and the human family cell if i was an advanced alien

[29:20.240 --> 29:24.560]  it might as well be an alien takeover i mean that's what we're facing and the globalists say
[29:24.560 --> 29:29.360]  there are new species of superhomo sapiens sapien because they're so cold blooded survival of the
[29:29.360 --> 29:35.920]  fittest and so for all intents and purposes the globalists are an alien off-world breakaway

[38:11.280 --> 38:15.440]  what's going on at the bus station just a few blocks away going to a different church that was
[38:15.440 --> 38:20.640]  busting the people that who sent us here to this church now we found out that after we've led the
[38:20.640 --> 38:24.640]  charge other people have followed in our footsteps so you know that they probably won't give us credit
[38:24.640 --> 38:28.080]  for that but regardless we're just happy that people are picking up on the story i'm sure they
[38:28.080 --> 38:32.240]  have a different slam on it but what happened last night is myself and the rest of the info
[38:32.240 --> 38:36.320]  war's crew we came back to the church and we said you know is anybody available to talk to us now and
[38:36.320 --> 38:40.560]  they said yeah come on in the people were very polite to us we talked to the emergency city
[38:40.560 --> 38:46.240]  manager as i already spoke about and also the mayor proteam uh a young a young lady here and she
[38:46.240 --> 38:49.680]  said yeah the people are coming in and i said well do you know how they're getting here and she didn't
[38:49.680 --> 38:54.320]  know uh particulars about everybody but she told me the people that she had spoken to personally
[38:54.320 --> 38:58.720]  had paid for their own tickets some people had road buses uh from central america driving up here
[38:58.720 --> 39:04.240]  maybe add some transportation switches between then and by the time they got to the border so
[39:04.240 --> 39:08.240]  i just want to be very clear when i was speaking to these people last night and i said well you
[39:08.240 --> 39:12.320]  know how are the people getting here and they gave me the story that i just mentioned and then they
[39:12.320 --> 39:16.240]  said after they encountered the border patrol the people who are not deemed to be a threat because
[39:16.240 --> 39:20.320]  we've had the reports talking about how some of these people coming from the central american
[39:20.320 --> 39:25.120]  countries have gang affiliates at twos also we talked to the ice agent last night who told us
[39:25.120 --> 39:29.120]  that some of these people have various health concerns such as tuberculosis and they seem to
[39:29.120 --> 39:33.920]  treat the illegals at these facilities better than they do the veterans at the va but regardless
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.000]  they said after these people are deemed not to be a threat they're released and they're
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.040]  giving a uh a court order to appear on such and such state for the crime approach in the border
[39:43.040 --> 39:47.280]  so after they are released from these facilities these border patrol facilities potentially
[39:47.280 --> 39:51.760]  ice facilities they're bused away whether it's given a voucher from the border patrol or they
[39:51.760 --> 39:56.400]  have families and friends who give them funds and then they come to a city such as mcallin and here
[39:56.400 --> 40:02.880]  they go from the bus station they get a health from church groups they get a hot meal a hot bath
[40:02.880 --> 40:07.760]  and they either you know they end up at a church home like this or they go to a military institution
[40:07.760 --> 40:12.640]  like a kid daniels and staff sergeant joe biggs found in san Antonio so you know regardless
[40:13.200 --> 40:16.560]  how people feel about the situation you have to understand that it comes down to money because
[40:16.560 --> 40:21.360]  everybody understands money your tax dollars are going to fund this uh your tax dollars are
[40:21.360 --> 40:25.680]  paying for the vouchers for the people who are here it's your tax dollars if you're and by the way
[40:25.680 --> 40:31.520]  this isn't the super hard working guys and cowboy hats you know you know they're basically like
[40:31.520 --> 40:37.040]  texans in many ways they're you know they come into work and and are honorable folks in my experience
[40:37.520 --> 40:43.440]  uh and and and you know in a lot of cases you really nice people this is literally the welfare
[40:43.440 --> 40:48.480]  class the criminal class women with three four kids i mean this is people come in here to get a
[40:48.480 --> 40:54.160]  free lunch this is outrageous and jacari we're going to play part of this video and then come
[40:54.160 --> 40:59.680]  back and talk to john bowden and get his take on all this but the incredible video is now top
[40:59.680 --> 41:06.560]  of info wars dot com caught red-handed border patrol paying to ship illegals deeper into the u.s
[41:07.360 --> 41:14.080]  you have the emergency manager of mcallin saying hey we're not hiding anything come on into the
[41:14.080 --> 41:21.840]  church that's a staging ground on video and then we get vouchers which is for the the tickets to get
[41:21.840 --> 41:27.840]  them out of here deeper into the us and i mean this is unbelievable meanwhile you have the
[41:27.840 --> 41:32.080]  border patrol with m16's run up and say get away when you're trying to walk up to their office
[41:32.720 --> 41:38.160]  uh in brownsville you've got them refusing you got them following you pulling over following you
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.800]  when you're doing reports because well and let's face it you're a black guy or if you're a white
[41:42.800 --> 41:48.000]  guy or if you're a hispanic who you know is an american you're done because i mean it's just
[41:48.560 --> 41:54.160]  if you were al-qaeda cutting christian's heads off right now in in iraq you would be given
[41:55.040 --> 42:00.800]  stinger missiles right but because you are a black guy with no criminal record from if military
[42:00.800 --> 42:07.200]  family uh you know from college in rtf you are scum because you're you have no criminal record
[42:07.200 --> 42:14.400]  and you're playing uh closed and in clean cut you're a bad person and so am i we're all crap uh i
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.040]  mean i mean i don't know how you follow any laws now when the government is a lawless group of
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.040]  criminals i mean and i'm not even saying the border patrol are bad they've been complaining
[42:23.040 --> 42:28.000]  and blowing the whistle does and when you talk to the ice agent yesterday adan salazar did but
[42:28.640 --> 42:35.840]  i mean this is just ridiculous this is unbelievable latin america is collapsing right now the caribbean
[42:35.840 --> 42:39.520]  is collapsing go ahead the border patrol agents and also the ice agents they're saying they have
[42:39.520 --> 42:43.920]  real bad morale because you know they think they have a job at securing the border but they're not
[42:43.920 --> 42:47.520]  all the thing they do they get paid their fee to just to sit around in their car all day and then
[42:47.520 --> 42:52.000]  see americans with texas plates in the state of texas oh we got to go follow these guys meanwhile
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.720]  we see guys with uh plates from mexico or other places and they don't seem to be too concerned
[42:56.720 --> 43:00.640]  about what they're doing the big trick is and i don't i'm just gonna give this away to everybody
[43:00.640 --> 43:07.600]  i know four people that got sick of the system middle class who bought mexican cars here in the
[43:07.600 --> 43:14.160]  us uh nice cars and they have mexican plates that some of them have been out of out for five years
[43:14.160 --> 43:19.920]  of the tags they are god they are invisible to the police and i think i'm gonna go buy a car
[43:19.920 --> 43:26.560]  legally in mexico i'm gonna drive that's i i'm gonna go buy a bmw in mexico and just cyan
[43:26.560 --> 43:31.680]  art everybody and hell i'll get a fake mexican id card and not him will be paedro
[43:32.400 --> 43:37.920]  horrez or something i don't know man i mean i want god-level power i want to go to bank of america
[43:37.920 --> 43:43.120]  and not show an id i want to be able to board airplanes and be left alone i want godlike power
[43:43.120 --> 43:48.960]  now now now now jacari yeah that's what you're going to get if you do that alex if you get those
[43:48.960 --> 43:54.720]  no i'm serious i'm getting a mexican car done and i'm gonna show the car it's i'm gonna do it as a
[43:54.720 --> 44:01.200]  stunt i won't buy even that fancy one i'm gonna buy a toilet a truck or something like five years on
[44:01.200 --> 44:05.200]  it that's it buckley i know you speak great spanish i want to go down to the border and i want to
[44:05.200 --> 44:10.480]  buy me a mexican truck i'm done i'll go to cardio ship buy one i'm done i want mexican plates a
[44:10.480 --> 44:16.480]  whole nine yards go ahead i have to go to mexico to come back in here to be free go ahead yeah
[44:16.480 --> 44:21.680]  that's exactly right and we were we were joking um you know maybe we should swim across the border
[44:21.680 --> 44:24.800]  then come back and then they would leave us alone they wouldn't harass us they wouldn't follow us
[44:24.800 --> 44:29.200]  around we all know that's not true though because you're you're obviously you know america and it's
[44:29.200 --> 44:34.000]  over for you yeah i guess so if i don't i don't speak the language so they the jig would be up for me
[44:35.440 --> 44:40.480]  no free bus fare no uh no hot showers you know we had a hard time finding a hotel last night for
[44:40.480 --> 44:44.800]  some reason okay as we uh we don't know exactly what's going on we didn't know if media was coming
[44:44.800 --> 44:49.280]  here uh the city manager had mentioned that they've been spending funds uh to house people we don't
[44:49.280 --> 44:53.600]  know if that means in a hotel but i definitely don't put it past them that possibly that is a uh
[44:53.600 --> 44:57.120]  something that well you know they were getting food a lot better than the present food michelle
[44:57.120 --> 45:01.520]  orders our kids to eat they were complaining about the h e b hot meals they weren't good enough so
[45:01.520 --> 45:06.000]  maybe it's caviar well you remember alex said one of the first reports i did when i came to info
[45:06.000 --> 45:11.360]  wars was our school in chicago they were feeding kids rat turds and they the rats got in there and
[45:11.360 --> 45:15.280]  they ate up all the food and they left the droppings and the kids got sick eating this stuff and you
[45:15.280 --> 45:19.040]  know and that's one of the michelle obama things that you have to eat this food they don't allow the
[45:19.040 --> 45:22.960]  kids to pretty much eat whatever they want to eat so now they have to rely on the school system
[45:22.960 --> 45:27.200]  that may or may not be providing nutritious foods well we're gonna come back with john bound and get
[45:27.200 --> 45:31.440]  his breakdown on this you guys are doing a great job and i guess the word is you're gonna come back
[45:31.440 --> 45:37.040]  tonight yeah i'm gonna try to get back tonight hit a few things uh on the way heading back north
[45:37.040 --> 45:40.960]  all right good and then let's pick some places to go maybe we should go to virginia or new york in
[45:40.960 --> 45:47.680]  these democrat towns i was reading about one with 10 000 kids in a town 20 000 the town is now collapsing
[45:47.680 --> 45:52.080]  and again we're gonna talk about this is this is the false flag one of the false flags thank you
[45:52.080 --> 45:57.360]  jacar now tell us about this report i'm about to air caught red-handed border patrol paying the ship
[45:57.360 --> 46:02.800]  illegals deep into the u.s the church you were at who you were talking to yes we came back here to
[46:02.800 --> 46:08.160]  mcallon sexist people may remember this is where we began our our start on day one we went to the
[46:08.160 --> 46:12.640]  bus stations and we saw the church groups picking up people so we go to the church we say hey are
[46:12.640 --> 46:16.560]  you housing the people here she said no we just pick them up we bust them they're at the other
[46:16.560 --> 46:20.320]  church which is the church behind me the sacred heart they're getting uh they're getting hot meals
[46:20.320 --> 46:24.240]  they're getting showers and then they're getting back on the buses and going to wherever they're
[46:24.240 --> 46:28.720]  going here in the united states and at the time we came originally there's nobody available to talk
[46:28.720 --> 46:32.720]  so we came back last night trying to see you know what was going on us and new developments had
[46:32.720 --> 46:37.360]  happened and from the time we left as i mentioned earlier if you're just joining us the major news
[46:37.360 --> 46:41.840]  networks we were told we're here seeing in good morning america they stopped by after we came
[46:41.840 --> 46:46.640]  here and broke the ground and since we've come back we found a tent outside the facility they said
[46:46.640 --> 46:50.160]  their facility was not big enough to house everybody so they have the tent out here we
[46:50.160 --> 46:55.520]  talked to the emergency city manager also a mayor pro team they gave us pretty much all the information
[46:55.520 --> 47:01.520]  they had and it's a good report you should watch it all right and you talk to your head emergency
[47:01.520 --> 47:07.760]  manager kevin pagan yes uh there in mcallin uh who's very proud of all this we're going to go
[47:07.760 --> 47:14.240]  to part of that report full video up on info wars dot com with video still shots as well this is
[47:14.240 --> 47:20.400]  just over the top joke level thank you jacar that will come back from break and get john bounce take
[47:20.400 --> 47:25.840]  on this as well reporting from mcallin texas the info wars dot com crew i come to you from the
[47:25.840 --> 47:33.440]  info wars dot com news center in austin texas formally in texas now fema region six uh let's go
[47:33.440 --> 47:37.280]  ahead and go to this clip so as far as you know they come across the border they encounter the
[47:37.280 --> 47:41.600]  border patrol and the border patrol brings them to a facility such as the bus station no they don't
[47:41.600 --> 47:46.320]  bring them there they take them or they initially take them to the border the border patrol station
[47:46.320 --> 47:51.360]  yes and they detain them there and they process them and then after they process them the ones the
[47:51.360 --> 47:57.120]  only ones that you'll see here are family units that are like a mom and a couple of kids that they
[47:57.120 --> 48:01.920]  have determined don't pose any sort of security risk and have a criminal background and they've
[48:01.920 --> 48:09.440]  got relatives or um help somewhere in the interior you know so that category of people again is our
[48:09.440 --> 48:13.920]  understanding they provide them a ticket right and then they drop the border patrol provides them a
[48:13.920 --> 48:20.080]  ticket that's what we were told and that's what i understood but obviously some of them or or
[48:20.080 --> 48:26.000]  they're arranging tickets with them there you know i mean with a relative that's paying for
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.880]  something i don't know it's all it's all we're not it's all here you know calling back home with
[48:32.880 --> 48:38.960]  any of you know come on over as i know is that until today 99% of them that got off the border
[48:38.960 --> 48:46.240]  patrol bus at our bus station had a ticket right and so all we all all the all the uh charitable
[48:46.240 --> 48:53.520]  organizations were doing all right let's talk right there sensationally evil sensational level
[48:53.520 --> 48:59.280]  tyranny and treason did you hear that the border patrol they come to the border they're loaded on
[48:59.280 --> 49:04.480]  buses they're not even turned around or bus back they're taken to the sacred heart as a huge complex
[49:04.480 --> 49:09.920]  they're fed prepared something i didn't get when i'd be put on a gray hand to be sent to family for
[49:09.920 --> 49:17.200]  two weeks in the summer they're just red carpeted then they're shipped into the interior and 99%
[49:17.200 --> 49:21.360]  of them or you said 90 plus percent it was kind of garbled already have a ticket when the border
[49:21.360 --> 49:27.200]  patrol drops them off i mean that that that is just that will be a national news story today on fox
[49:27.200 --> 49:31.680]  singing them will say it's a great thing msnb seal say the great thing we will get no credit

[54:58.400 --> 55:02.320]  me saying specifically they would give stinger missiles to al-qaeda use it to take over the
[55:02.320 --> 55:06.560]  whole middle east and threaten to bring down the west so they had to take all our rides they found
[55:06.560 --> 55:11.280]  three specific clips with the dates coming up we're going to play then we have multiple
[55:12.320 --> 55:18.640]  federal marshal air marshal whistleblowers coming on about 15 to the next hour that ties into how
[55:18.640 --> 55:27.680]  it's all fake major whistleblowing information of national international import coming up as the
[55:27.680 --> 55:35.920]  whistleblowers just reach out to us we do investigations and vet it john bound is now down
[55:35.920 --> 55:41.440]  on the border as well john i mean it is so off the chart to have the head emergency manager of
[55:41.440 --> 55:45.600]  mccallum on the biggest cities down there on the border say the border patrol is providing them with
[55:45.600 --> 55:50.880]  tickets to go quote be with their families in the interior so they are deploying them
[55:52.320 --> 55:59.040]  paying to penetrate all the way into the u.s and get signed up for welfare sensational
[55:59.600 --> 56:04.800]  sensational evil john bound yeah and the interesting part of the video one of the
[56:04.800 --> 56:12.720]  interesting parts was the invasion loophole the usage of central americans honduras el salvador
[56:12.720 --> 56:17.840]  and guatemala because the loophole uh if you come here from mexico they just take you to the
[56:17.840 --> 56:25.120]  border and send you back but the strategy of clara piven to basically uh as as richard cloward said
[56:25.120 --> 56:31.360]  the new york times in 1970 following the watts rights of 1965 he said that the only way that
[56:31.360 --> 56:39.200]  poor people can advance ie socialism can advance is for the rest of society to be afraid of them
[56:39.200 --> 56:48.560]  and so here we are with this soft invasion similar to the nazis uh killing of all the
[56:48.560 --> 56:54.720]  jews back in world war two and then now the soft invasion of killing us softly we have this soft
[56:54.720 --> 57:00.960]  invasion that the harder invasion parkens back to the clan and the democratic party the liberal
[57:00.960 --> 57:06.160]  party agenda uh that most people aren't aware of is the fact that the democratic party used the
[57:06.160 --> 57:11.360]  clan against their enemies the republicans well they founded it and and then the republicans
[57:11.360 --> 57:16.560]  passed the civil rights act so they switched and became the minority party but it's all racial based
[57:16.560 --> 57:21.920]  politics and that's exactly what's going on driving down the wages they got the unions to vote for
[57:21.920 --> 57:26.880]  nafta and gatt that slit their own throats as well that's the thing about the and the republican
[57:26.880 --> 57:33.920]  leadership is part of this as well but the fact that the border patrol is paying to ship them
[57:33.920 --> 57:39.600]  deep into the us that should be the top story in the country uh where are you guys going next john
[57:39.600 --> 57:45.040]  bound yeah that's completely treason to answer that we're going to the border patrol station next
[57:45.040 --> 57:49.200]  and uh we're gonna take the ipad video and we're going to show them we're going to get in their
[57:49.200 --> 57:54.880]  face and basically explain to them that they are committing treason that what they're doing is
[57:54.880 --> 57:59.040]  un-american that's right that's right i would serve them a notice type it up on a machine
[57:59.040 --> 58:02.720]  and i go to the police department as well and i'd say we're reporting crimes you're shipping them
[58:02.720 --> 58:06.960]  into the country and show that as well great job john we'll talk to you more in the last

[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:59.840]  there where we ate trying to find at denny's trying to find a hotel room now that was after
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:07.360]  we came here uh it was undercover of darkness city buses rolling up uh people being moved out
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:13.760]  to the bus station undercover of darkness because they know that this is illegal and were you able
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:20.480]  to catch it uh even though it was dark yeah we we i used a night vision camera we we did catch a
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.600]  lot of stuff where is that oh that that well i mean i know you're staying up all night to get the
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:29.040]  other videos out well we can't wait to see that we have a lot more i mean i uh i did a little
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:35.360]  sombrero piece you can't find a sombrero down here because it's racist anyway uh but yeah everything
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:41.200]  is i mean if you have peanut butter and jelly in your cupboard right oh yeah yeah so so you're there
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.880]  at night just new people come in by day they roll out by night this is a military operation
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.720]  with the military the police the board of patrol the church is all in criminal action against this
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.280]  republic just like the government ships and narcotics and it is a total criminal state
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.680]  it's a soft invasion and just like the soft kill strategy they're doing to us i don't even think
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:07.120]  it's a soft i mean this thing's gone on on high i tilt now right i mean this is just insane
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.240]  yep they're back but they're back during the whole operation if this was legal they'd be doing it in
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:17.840]  front of god and everybody with the sun out right now the buses be pulling up we'd all be celebrating
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.800]  but it's not it's illegal and they're doing it and and the wee hours of the night and there's
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:29.360]  a reason for that and again it is the poorest people to go directly on welfare to bankrupt the
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:35.040]  country maybe one thing it was able able body men and we needed workers this is insane uh let me get
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.800]  a final comment from jacari i want to ask jacari what he thought last night uh watching the invasion
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.800]  happen i mean they want to keep this secret jacari but info wars is down they're exposing it yeah and
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.800]  just clicked me while i was listening to john talk about that could remind me of the first day
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.960]  and i didn't think much of it at the time but the first day we got here it was just starting to get
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.960]  dark and that's when the buses were rolling around and since we've come back since that first day
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.720]  we're out here in broad daylight i haven't seen any buses rolling around at the bus station so it
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.640]  just clicked me when he's saying that yeah they were doing this pretty much in the cover of darkness
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.560]  or at least wait until it got darker and but you don't see any buses in the daytime we just
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:14.880]  rolled by the uh the bus station when we were coming up here we saw none of those church buses
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:19.040]  and you've been to multiple cities and this invasion strategy is being deployed in each
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.080]  yes yes i mean i guess everybody has their their own way of doing it but yeah it's pretty
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:31.280]  it's pretty much a cover of darkness type of op literal op with the board patrol quarterbacking
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:36.800]  the entire operation giant trains cargo trains with illegals on the tops of them rolling up to the
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:42.720]  border uh mainstream news this is off the chart we just showed photos and video of that i mean this
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:50.480]  is incredible latin america is literally about to be dumped on the united states and they love

[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:29.920]  i mean that should be national news right now info wars dot com red link we have an ice whistleblower
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:35.920]  confirming it as well he says it's all word of mouth it's all being done without written orders
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:42.080]  just like they went after the irs you know targeting media people and conservatives libertarians
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:49.520]  that was done word of mouth this is a criminal op this is the total takeover of our republic at a
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:56.160]  level i have never even imagined moving this quick it's so naked it's sub raising let's go to hillary
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:05.360]  clinton on cbs news and it's been aired on other channels saying that you're right to own guns
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:11.760]  terrorizes people that that a second amendment of freedom terrorizes people like your first
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:17.040]  one that has to be banned because it might hurt somebody's feelings this is the new right to have
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:21.200]  your kids taken by the state to have your guns taken your new right to pay for illegal aliens
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.840]  your new right to be a slave in the communist system with the bankers offshore exempt above the law
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:34.320]  here is that clip i'm well aware that this is a hot political subject and again i will speak out
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.800]  no matter what role i find myself in but i believe that we need a more thoughtful conversation we
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:47.920]  cannot let a minority of people and it's that's what it is it is a minority of people hold a
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:54.960]  viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of people and again that was from cnn i'd seen the club on
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:02.160]  cbs news show our view terrorizes people because their followers are welfare heads and government
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:08.000]  worker types who literally live behind eight locks in major compact cities and think chicago
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.920]  is freedom highest crime rate in the world we're not allowed to terrorize them see in the tea party's
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.440]  terrorists now and gun owners of the new terrorists they're coming that they admit we're the terrorist
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.160]  the second amendment is terrorism freedom is terrorism here's obama last week on national
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:33.680]  television cbs news saying that we need what australia did a couple of decades ago australia
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:45.280]  had had a mass shooting uh similar to columbine or newtown uh and australia just said well that's it
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:54.960]  we're not doing we're not doing that again and basically imposed very severe tough
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:02.800]  gun laws and they've never they haven't had a mass shooting since all eyes i mean our levels of gun
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:09.360]  violence are off the charts there's no advanced developed country on earth that would put up with
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.040]  this i'm not going to go back over this it's on record you can look it up just type into a search
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:19.120]  engine la times had a great headline two years ago the statistics first came out we actually got it
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:26.000]  first looked at statistics broke it here had our statistician uh look at it we actually have some
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.600]  works here that has a degree in statistics uh and came up with the number of 52 percent and that was
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:40.320]  later picked up though that was true la times the headline was was the exact headline it was gun crime
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.480]  plummets but public thinks it's an epidemic or something like that gun crime goes down
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.120]  as public thinks it increases so even the la times wants to have some journalistic
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:58.960]  credibility occasionally had to admit that in the la times their crime rates exploded in australia
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.120]  so is england once they banned guns remember he said he'd never come after your guns i can play those
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.360]  clips but you know he said it not your shotgun not your handgun not your rifle none of your guns
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.000]  and it's preposperous to say i would come after your guns and joe biden said the same thing let me
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.320]  tell you these talking points they are preparing to announce the gun ban after they stage another
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:24.960]  mass shooting or or or or promote one with all this copycat stuff with them hyping it gun crime
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:36.240]  is plunged but americans think it's up says study 2013 may 7th now i'm not the type that ever has
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:43.680]  anxiety attacks folks i haven't had what you'd call anxiety since you know before when a bully
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.760]  was saying he was going to meet me after school who'd flunked three grades when i was in the seventh
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.480]  grade he was going to beat me up and i would have butterflies because i couldn't sneak out the back
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:57.840]  of school i wouldn't let myself do it so i'd march out and i was more afraid of what the police would
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:04.720]  do to me after i stood up to him and i haven't had those feelings since i was about 11 or 12 years old
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:13.440]  and i have that feeling now all the time i mean i gotta make myself breathe i mean i am just in
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:19.840]  total combat mode right now at a biological level i mean our country is falling we're going down right
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:27.280]  now the government is so evil it publicly funded hardcore nazis that actually howell hitler to
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.520]  overthrow george soros bragged about it a month ago he admitted he did it to overthrow the state
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:37.120]  department in five billion ukraine try to start a war with russia now that backfired so much
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:42.000]  that they elected a new guy that is elected but obama said the unelected people were duly elected
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:50.720]  they are proxy warring libya syria everybody else to get at iran through iraq they are putting al-qaeda
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:55.920]  into murder every christian every shiaite they come across maliki the iraqi presidents come out
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:01.360]  against iran saying you're in a secret deal with the us to take a third of the country for a shiaite
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:05.360]  area then you're going to break it up and give part of it to saudi arabia the north of the curds
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.600]  he's being an iraqi patriot i've got to say it saying all iraqis together against this breakup
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:18.720]  of iraq that's what's happening right now and i said this would happen back on december 6 2012

[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:30.480]  the reason that you have seen all these headlines that have been kind of whitewashed by the state
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:37.520]  run dominant media air marshals gone wild tales of sexism suicide and bigotry report on federal
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:43.520]  air marshals service paints and unflattering pictures seeing in ahead of orlando air marshals
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:49.440]  office to retire and then it gets into all the things that went on there i remember hearing
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:54.080]  about homeland security where they'd make the men you know office out of the bathrooms well then
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:59.040]  they would have like you know men white men being mean to minorities i mean it's just whoever the
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:04.400]  clique is they're being mean to people and we've got two major whistleblowers almost have a lot of
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:11.120]  courage uh so steve and henry um theodore oppalus and henry creston thank you both for coming on
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:16.000]  this is only a six minute segment an 18 minute segment's coming up a bottom line i know the
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.400]  media tends to only focus on what they want to focus on kind of tell us the breadth of
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.920]  what you're blowing the whistle on and then we'll come back and get into uh specifics because you're
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.640]  talking about gun running you know not just all the red meat sexist stuff which i want to get into
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.600]  as well and racist stuff it just sounds like par for the courts and the federal government really
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:41.680]  bizarre culture and i just don't understand it so maybe you can explain it to us well when we dug
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:49.360]  into the uh the recent report out of the senate we we learned that charlie edwards uh was sanitizing
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.760]  that secret service report i don't know if you had a chance or an opportunity to read through that
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:26:00.000]  but charlie edwards is key to the air marshal investigation that was conducted in 2010 because
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.680]  he was in charge of that investigation as you read through the investigation you find that it
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:12.240]  wasn't widespread they say that the the retaliation and discrimination in the hostile working environment
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.520]  was so minor i mean they downplayed everything but this is coming from the guys already testified
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:23.600]  to congress that uh he cleaned up the other reports so we're quite sure that the the current
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:30.480]  report is uh been sanitized and we go one step further in in july of 2010 the inspectors came
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:36.880]  in and spoke directly with mr preston in regards to the original report that was done by tsa
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:43.840]  inspections and uh well mr preston tell them what they said uh they basically told me that uh uh my
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:49.680]  report wasn't in there my 18 page sworn statement that i gave the tsa was not included in their
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:55.840]  report and they were looking forward to meeting with me and copying my documentation for their report
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:02.160]  so that's how we do alexa there was a cover-up it was it was pretty clear right from the beginning
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:08.720]  that if you don't have the eyewitness who was in the training division observing these things daily
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.840]  then you're obviously whitewashing everything from the very beginning well i've seen so many
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:19.200]  scandals you name it there's been a scandal where they're supposed to fake profile people and create
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.280]  a certain number of people on a list that end up getting on a list maybe over food they ordered
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.000]  i remember seeing that years ago in denver and then you read about uh just just you name it it's
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.400]  going on uh in the air marshals you were both air marshals describe briefly your careers whoever
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:40.000]  wants to start first and why you've decided to go public well we decided to go public because once
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.360]  i got i mean we heard we heard about the scandals we heard about the discrimination um we kind of
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:50.480]  witnessed it with with individuals in the office that were going through this um and then i got a
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:56.640]  promotion into the training division as a trainer instructor and i seen it firsthand there was a
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:03.440]  whiteboard hanging on the wall that was a jeopardy style board that they had a list of people that
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:08.560]  they the employees by the way that air marshals that they were discriminated against and as you
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:14.560]  can see the whiteboard behind us here um it's a jeopardy style board and they would put you on the
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:20.880]  board uh it depending upon what you did if they didn't like you for because you were gay uh you
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.520]  would be put in the ellen de generis category and they would continue doing this if you're Hispanic
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:31.440]  you're in herala revera and if they really wanted to ruin your career they would put you in the
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:38.000]  ted bundy category and that would mean cut your legs off and rip your career apart that would
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.200]  uh uh definitely make you unemployable uh even flip and hamburgers at mcdonald's and this is
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:50.400]  this was their culture because they didn't want their little country club that they were running
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:59.280]  disturbed in any way so as soon as you challenge them in any way um about a policy or procedure um
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.400]  or like i said they didn't like you because of your race your color your creed you were put on
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:10.880]  this board and you were discriminated against until they terminated we have a we have documentation
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:17.680]  documentation on this with people who have been targeted uh have been terminated or severely
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:24.880]  disciplined for minor minor infractions or something that they might have um not done
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:29.920]  but they were just picked off wow henry preston amazing stay right there you were a trainer and

[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:41.920]  running scandals there's uh one of you i know was a trainer for this you know behavioral
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:46.720]  profiling and i've read books on that i know for art types you can pick up classical
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.880]  you know stuff that's suspicious but when i fly you know they'll ask me where i'm going when i'm
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.640]  doing and the tsa even knows who i am and they say have a nice trip alex heard your show yesterday
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:01.280]  and they'll giggle at me and they take an eight hour course i'm told when what i've read is it
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:05.920]  takes years from what i've read correct me if i'm wrong to really learn how to do this show
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:12.960]  you guys got the floor cover the waterfront for us again two of the federal uh air marshals who
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.360]  blown the whistle you see their names in a lot of the national news stories giving us everything
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:22.400]  here today not through the media filter but but talking directly to you live gentlemen go ahead
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.800]  alex you're you're absolutely right it takes a long time to uh to become a uh behavioral
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:35.280]  detection uh officer you just i mean they throw people in these positions that um uh they want
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:40.640]  to take off a flight status or something like that but um the bottom line is it does take a
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:45.040]  long time and they just don't have the experience and that could show that in the stats that i had
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:52.400]  pulled off the internet um where they spent 383 million dollars on training and deployment of
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:40:04.880]  3 000 bdo's this is on the internet from the um from the site uh the gio report and the way the way
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:14.320]  it runs here is that you had 127,666 dollars they spent per bdo how many terrorists have they arrested
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:26.160]  zero absolutely zero there was 1,083 arrests of these people over 150,000 people stopped in
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:33.760]  question and the arrests were for a marijuana joint or carrying $5,000 in cash when you weren't
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:39.840]  when you were supposed to declare it it's it's a ridiculous program the problem is alex the reason
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:44.320]  we continue to speak out and continue to hit the pavement hard is no one should be targeted for
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:50.160]  these reasons but it goes way beyond that once we were drug into this uh exposure of the bad
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:55.680]  behavior we learned about bribes we learned about supervisors that were showing up in their offices
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:00.960]  at headquarters drunk and locking themselves within the the confines of their office and
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:06.880]  spending their eight hours that's not the way the taxpayer dollars should be spent nor is that
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:12.880]  making our country intersafer we've continued to speak out and say listen you're in danger
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:18.640]  you're in danger just recently the new uh director uh mr. Roderick Allison had a meeting there in
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:24.720]  baltimore a town hall style meeting uh with the air marshals there and they are looking at cutting
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:30.240]  the budget of the air marshals 208 million dollars and they're not willing to cut the fat
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.720]  out of the program and cut the former secret service guys that are sitting in these offices
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:42.000]  making any worse from 160 000 to 250 000 plus collecting their secret service retirement
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.960]  of over 100 000 a year they're wanting to cut the air marshals now latest stuff that i've seen
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:54.160]  out there is around 4 000 guys now take that and you cut that by 1700 air marshals and i got to
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.840]  ask the american public do you feel any safer traveling on those airplanes when you know
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:06.960]  the 35 to 36 000 flights sometimes even higher or daily moving through the airways and are you
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:13.040]  feeling comfortable that those fat cat supervisors are sitting in their offices doing nothing and
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.680]  half the flight and half the men and women who protect you are going to be removed from the
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:22.480]  service that's why we keep speaking out we keep speaking out because the congress and the senators
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:27.440]  can't seem to figure out what the problem is we have volunteered and i will say it here now
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:34.080]  mr. Darrell isa you have to go no further we're here i have the group of men and women who have
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:38.880]  been directly involved with this and we can prove and show the evidence things that we
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.800]  can't talk about on the show here that are procedural in nature and we can get to the
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:47.440]  bottom of this real quick why are we waiting and spinning the wheels with the department of
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:53.040]  homemade security i g inspector general who has continued to lie to the american public
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:59.200]  you saw the director bray rod allison novak and i forget who the other guy was a lot they lied
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:04.400]  directly to congress this is not white spread this is not all over the board within the the
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:11.040]  agency i talked to people all over this country that are air marshals d a agents fbi guys and i
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:19.120]  am telling you the government is uh on a bad situation here with this uh targeting of individuals
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.240]  alex the targeting goes and they said it's not white spread but here you go in a very short
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:33.200]  period of time they had 280 eoc complaints 161 merit system protection board cases and 40 individual
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:39.840]  lawsuits in u.s district courts it's a bit they bury they bury them and when they can't win
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:44.960]  they'll seal the case and they'll pay the people off but where are we at are we any better
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:51.760]  senator nelson even came out and said the public is in danger he said it right on national news
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:56.800]  the public is in danger but what's been happening they can't seem to wrap their arms around the
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:03.840]  problems because tsa keeps saying screw you we're not giving you any information right and we've
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.720]  heard that i've been in cathy caster's office congressman caster's office senator nelson's
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:13.920]  office i've been in uh uh john micah's office i've been in every congressman and senator's
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:18.720]  office it's here in florida and talk to everyone and they all tell us the same thing tsa is the
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:24.480]  most difficult agency to work with and until you press them or get a court order they're not giving
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:29.600]  you anything and that they've made everything uh top secret or above i mean right down to a memo so
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.800]  you can well sure i mean look i mean i want to ask you about this and i know you can't talk about
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:37.200]  a lot of it because it's quote classified but millions of people on the no fly list or the watch
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:43.680]  list multiple members of congress movie stars with no criminal record and then you're a congressman
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:51.360]  or woman with no criminal record you're a movie star a newscaster or my dad a doctor and you go and
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:57.440]  you say okay here i am i have no record how do i get off this and they go sorry can't tell you
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:02.960]  that's directly out of 1984 where you don't know how you get on a list you don't know how you get
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:09.600]  off a list and then you go and literally the tsa some places is nice to people other places
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:14.880]  is shouting at old ladies ordering them to get out of walkers the daughter says she's got cancer
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:20.000]  she's going home to die i saw this happen in an airport uh and and they're telling her get up get
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.440]  up in the houston airport and the and the woman couldn't get up so they're calling cops over to
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:29.440]  threaten the woman to get her mother up and i literally started saying something i said that
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:34.240]  lady was about to die she can't she got oxygen tanks and they said buddy you better watch it
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:39.040]  or you're gonna not miss your you're gonna miss your flight we'll have you arrested and i mean
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:44.320]  repeatedly i've gotten in arguments watching them harass people i've been with jesse ventura when he's
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:50.960]  gotten mad literally when they were going in his grabbing his genitals these these people at the at
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:58.000]  the airport in um Atlanta he blew up and left the country over i mean all i'm saying is jesse
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.360]  ventura the former minnesota governor they know who he is going hi governor hi like your tv show
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:09.280]  grabbing his testicles and i mean and i even took photos of it we went and had food or waiting for
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:13.840]  a flight for his tv show and he said yeah that's terrible erase it i don't want it to be seen but
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:20.720]  then he talked about it on air i mean this how does grabbing jesse ventura's genitals or checking a
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:24.880]  baby's diaper keep us safe when people with turbines on their heads are walking right onto the plane
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:30.880]  alex i i came from a state police agency prior to uh joining the air marshall service and i can
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.800]  tell you that the system at the air marshall service and within tsa structure is broken
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:41.280]  and i also can tell you that we even had air marshalls that were on the list so somebody has
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:46.560]  to explain it why would you and i've flown with the same individual that mr preston flown with
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.360]  and i've flown with him and when you're paired up with these individuals are on the no-flyless
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:56.720]  air marshalls by the way you're flagged as well there is no way i mean this this uh guy that i
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:01.920]  worked with he went to a supervisor he did repeatedly a paperwork to get off the list
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:07.440]  you can't get off the list so that just tells you it's not updated it's not current and you know
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:12.560]  early on they were just throwing people on the list and they've never cleaned the process up they've
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:18.080]  never streamlined it and they've never really eliminated the real threats that's why we keep
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:22.560]  talking and pushing these things out there because we're getting ready to travel season of summer
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.200]  holidays are right around the corner you've got all the problems and unrest in the mid uh middle
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.240]  east something has to be done but like i like we said you know that's why we keep doing it we've
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:37.280]  been at risk here the entire time from our internet uh being tapped we've had people jump over our
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:43.040]  fences in the middle of night and dark clothing notes left we've been followed um the harassment
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:47.600]  and intimidation i know that you spoke well briefly with dan bongino about that last week
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:53.040]  let me just tell you he's not he's not really telling you how bad it can get because you see
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:58.000]  these other documented cases like in Cincinnati where the air marshals were being followed and
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.480]  all these different things it goes on and they they don't they're relentless they don't let up
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.320]  yeah you got air marshals wives have been followed to malls and and pictures they walk right up to
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:16.400]  them and take pictures of intimidation it's incredible and yet you have yet you have at 23
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:22.480]  separate occasions according to our reports us intelligent agencies show at least 16 alleged
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:27.920]  terrorists have traveled through at least eight separate airports with the bdo program in place
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:34.560]  and would never stopped and also with the no-fly list and was never stopped but yet federal agents
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:39.760]  are on this no-fly list doctors like your like your your father jesse venturer who else would you
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:44.800]  want on the airplane with you if there was a problem right okay on the no-fly list come on
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:50.080]  what the system is broken we know that we have been trying to expose us for a long time and and
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:55.680]  because we we cannot we get places congressman says yeah we're going to do something we met with
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:01.520]  congressional leaders we met with congressional attorneys they're going to do it nothing's done
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:06.560]  and the reason the reason that we pushing for the congress is because we need a backdoor session
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.360]  with these guys and senators and let them know because there's problems with the instrumentation
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:16.080]  we can't go into that here because it's procedural and certainly they would flag us for that
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:20.640]  but there are a lot of things that the public's not aware of and we need to be able to somebody
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.920]  to well it's not just that i want to ask you guys about this because you're such experts i mean i
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:27.120]  could talk for five hours with you i hope you can go a little bit in the next hour at least
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:31.600]  till five after when climb joins us and come back for a full hour for a special report uninterrupted
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:36.480]  sometime in the nightly news so we can tape it and then add documentation news articles and video
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:41.760]  clips to back up what you're saying congressional testimony you name it but i want to understand
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:49.280]  how i've seen things like wolverine security in san francisco you name it this was years ago but
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:54.640]  private security literally searching world war two vets that were going to fly to hawaii
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.760]  for a arizona memorial and these guys were on death's doorstep this was like six seven years ago
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:04.480]  i bet they're all dead and being harassed by security that didn't even hardly speak english
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:09.920]  i mean the stuff i see in airports is so bizarre i can't even figure it out i mean i don't even
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:14.560]  know what the point is i mean where is this coming from you know how they go after the wrong
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:20.080]  people because they want stats they're they're they're not trained enough they're not educated
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:27.360]  enough okay to go after specific terrorists okay they want stats so what do they do i was there
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:33.120]  i've i've heard an audio tape go after the blacks okay but they're the ones who have the words but
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:38.080]  that's not that's not the word they use they use the other word okay now here's now here's the deal
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:43.680]  so so really it's about general dragnet policing which violates the fourth amendment absolutely
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:48.320]  and not only that but here's the deal they will go through to try to get stats their main thing is
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:56.800]  get stats i stop 500 people today okay it may be 500 old ladies or a combination of veterans or
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:02.800]  doctors or or jesse ventures okay so they put down a stat so again they get more money in their
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:08.320]  budget right this is about this is about the budget this isn't about protection of of the public
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:13.280]  and i will tell you i had an incident there at the Orlando airport where i was on duty
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:20.080]  and someone ran through the checkpoint now tsa they they shut the train down so the individual
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:25.040]  couldn't make it to the other side where the gates were i'm identifying myself with my badge
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:30.480]  and my id and i'm attempting to get to the subject because i know that i'm the only police officer
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:37.520]  between the entrance point and that uh the train and do you know that the tsa officials grab me and
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:42.000]  put their hands on me now they're not supposed to touch anybody or grab anybody but yet they're
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.720]  preventing me the only law enforcement officer from moving forward oh no that's what i was reading
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:51.360]  is that they tell the police what to do and the air marshals have the time and then i've seen the
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:56.480]  reports where where i mean they just do insane things so you're trying to chase the guy and
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:00.880]  they're stopping him they stopping me and tell me i can't go any further they're not even police
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:07.360]  officers and yet that's the system that tsa the non-police that's what we call it really
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:11.200]  you're looking at the federal air marshals service and what people understand it's really
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:17.680]  a civilian entity running the police department and it nowhere else does that happen but within
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:22.080]  this government system that's what's happening and that's why they're tying their hands i remember
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:26.640]  sitting on an airplane with then at that time senator john carrey were coming into washington
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:31.920]  national and he knew who i was and we were talking he says well what do you think of the program and
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:38.240]  i said senator by all due respect in a nice way this is about what i get to do is a air marshall
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:43.200]  you're tying my hands and let me just tell you as a state police officer i held my hands as far
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:48.720]  apart as i could that's what i was able to do they're tying the hands of the officers and making
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:54.560]  it very difficult for them to go after the true terrorists i mean don't exactly look at what they're
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:53:01.200]  arming isis and and letting them go after iraq and syria and then acting like they don't know i mean
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:06.000]  look bottom line the political class wants a police state they don't want criminals targeted
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:12.080]  they want the general public taught to be processed like prisoners this is social engineering that's
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:17.840]  why none of it makes sense to peace officers like yourself that actually want to go after bad guys
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:22.880]  your sheepdogs trying to go after wolves the truth is they just want you to become wolves i mean
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:28.480]  that's really what it comes down to oh here's the alexia's thing they want no cases no problems
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:34.240]  this is a country club environment of retired secret service guys okay from the 1980s from the
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:39.920]  1980s and and and you can look at what's that book well kester's book of well listen listen guys i'm
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:43.920]  going to give you the floor but listen i don't know the inside so so so tell me what you thought of
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:48.880]  my statement is any of it accurate but expanding you know one of you fellows was kind of shaking his
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:54.080]  head so i want to hear what you're saying you're just saying no it's beyond that it's total laziness
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:54:00.720]  explain that to me steve and then back to henry laziness and what what aspect well i mean i was
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:05.760]  bringing up how the political class wants the police there to train the public to be slaves
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:11.440]  and to feel like perps but but doesn't want you to go after the real criminals and and i was i wanted
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:15.920]  you to comment on that and then you brought up the fact that it's just a country club go ahead it's
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:21.680]  it's a it's smoke and mirrors in order to make the public feel safe after 9 11 then they what they
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:28.240]  did is they set this whole false thing up to make you feel added security added instrumentation that
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:33.920]  by the way and the majority of it doesn't work uh uh letting the people in the public go hey we've
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:38.320]  got air marshals on the plane but get less than one percent of the airplanes are being covered
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:43.600]  well a great example of that was this incident where on christmas day that triple seven where the
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:48.960]  guy was attempting to blow the plane up at that time delta airlines only had 11 giant airplanes
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:53.920]  are you telling me that the federal air marshals service can't cover those 11 airplanes and yet
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:58.240]  we didn't have anybody in place to cover those airplanes that's what we're talking about a
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:03.280]  false sense of security where the major targets aren't being covered so you're saying it's pure
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:10.240]  security theater and it's not even set up to go after a threat 100% sir 100% it's a complete
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:16.080]  absolute disgrace and failure and the american public is being sold a bill of goods that is
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.320]  that's all it is it's just a bill of goods and you're paying for 800 million dollars at the last
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:25.360]  check for the the current budget at one point it was 1.2 billion dollars sure what's that money
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:29.520]  going i want to go back to henry so you get his point and then i want to ask you it's not just
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:34.160]  in the air marshals obviously it's everywhere this culture is creeping into it's in business
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:40.320]  it's in life i mean america is just really losing touch with reality i want to get your
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:43.440]  your take on where it's all going but what was the other point you wanted to make henry
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.600]  well i'll tell you what you know here's supervision that wants to take flights and this is this was uh
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:55.360]  what i guess when i was there a couple years ago um they would take flights just to go on
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:56:00.000]  little vacations okay they would say okay we're going to try to cover this flight whatever go over
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.800]  to a golf course overseas spend a few days there and come back and say they're they're working
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:11.280]  they're covering a flight this has been going on for a long time it's just it's a country club they
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.800]  no case is no problems and when the supervisors get caught or in a certain bind and they realize
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:22.320]  that they like the one fellow was caught on the airplane sleeping we expose that he's got a loaded
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:27.120]  weapon on the airplane uh what they what did they do they they try to put a little pressure on him
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:32.480]  about the investigation then he just resigns out he's able to keep his retirement and nothing ever
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:36.720]  happens and you know when we fix the problem well you didn't fix the problem because it continues
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:43.760]  to go on and the public suffers we have another guy that's a supervisor that went over to uh
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:49.040]  another country and jumped inside of a major scene to steal baby jesus during christmas
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:54.400]  and nothing ever happened to him and here you go when he graduated from a west point west point
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:59.280]  graduate and he became a meanwhile there's a phenomenon of tsa agents stripping down naked
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:05.120]  and declaring their god things like that are happening i mean literally you're talking about
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:11.120]  the federal marshals and i'm and obviously there's some issues there you're the experts but for me
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:18.640]  the real craziness is the stealing and how many times i've had things stolen out of my bags like a
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:23.680]  tiffani baby rattle i bought for my daughter when i was in new york they just stole it opened the box
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:29.360]  up then it was gone money uh everybody i know that has medication i'm not on any medicaid people i
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:33.760]  know that are on medication sleeping pills dr pacenic has talked about it you know his sleeping
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:38.880]  pills have been stolen i mean most people i know have been robbed by the tsa and and they're always
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:45.280]  getting caught i mean what is going on soft soft points in the uh and the security is what part
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:51.280]  of that problem is and that some of those stories have been exposed nationwide and the local reports
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:56.720]  that are out there we air marshals are reporting this type of stuff the way where guys were getting
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:03.600]  in or or or security security breaches but it just doesn't seem to change it's it's about you just
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:07.760]  doing your job if i had a supervisor told me so what did you think when you came over here
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:12.480]  that you were going to do besides sit in the first class seat and look at the seat in front of you
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:17.840]  and i just i was absolutely floored by this and this is a guy that came over from us customs
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:22.800]  he retired out of there he ended up being my supervisor when the agency was ramping up back
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:30.400]  in 2002 2003 and i just i was appalled by that i i came over after 9 11 with a deep sense and
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:35.680]  love for my country to be able to serve the country and the people that are here hold on steve stay

[01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:12.800]  network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:28.400]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.880]  steve leotor operas and henry Preston are our guests we got five minutes left gentlemen
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:44.560]  i want to give you the floor to any other key points you want to make and then invite you
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:48.800]  guys back on the nightly news to really do an in-depth investigation report so we can tape it
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:53.760]  and then edit in all the documentation but other points uh that you guys just former air marshals
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:57.440]  that have blown the whistle i would like to make i mean it just seems like the sky's the limit
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:02.640]  what was the gun running point one of you mentioned before he went live the uh the gun scandal the
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:08.080]  the current gun scandal with the director uh bray uh if you've read any of the documentation
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:13.040]  that's out there they're going to let this guy off the director is going to escape any punishment
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:18.720]  any disciplinary action and just so happens the guy conducting the investigation uh robert gallison
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:22.720]  is going to be named as the new director so if you don't think there was a backdoor deal
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:27.920]  done there it's it's pathetic but when we've said all along the solution here alex is this
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:33.040]  in order to save the money and save the agency and save the taxpayer the solution is this
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:38.560]  shut down the field offices the air marshals can operate electronically like they've been doing
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:45.440]  all along out of the main office out of washington and move the agency over to the united states
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:50.160]  marshals service which is already established with its buildings by doing that and cutting down
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:55.600]  the hr personnel and the supervisors who are absolutely doing nothing except collecting a
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:00.880]  second retirement the american public can save over 300 million dollars instantly the program
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:06.640]  would not be affected one iota no flights would be missed and you would be able to keep intact
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:11.280]  the same air marshals that are out there doing their jobs day after day and that's part of the
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:16.640]  solution um anything you want to add to that i do i alex you know i i know we got a short time here
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:21.920]  but you know we had two suicides in the office over the the uh retaliation and discrimination
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:26.640]  i'll go get into that later on another segment but i just wanted to bring that up two good personal
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:33.200]  friends of mine um uh and i wanted to get my gosh too air marshals you knew were harassed so bad
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:39.760]  they killed themselves yep yeah out of orlando that's 14 14 that we know nationwide and the
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:46.080]  majority of the stories that we've gotten into the air marshals supervisors refuse to give them
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:51.680]  assistance now i mean how do we know all 14 weren't some of them weren't killed because we know a lot
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:57.040]  of the iraq suicides it turned out where people getting killed yeah and we don't we don't but but
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:01.360]  the but a lot of them that we've gotten that we've dug into and talked to people in the other field
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:07.440]  offices our sides yeah they they asked for some help but recently the one up in new york where
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:12.880]  the air marshal was having some difficulties at home tried to contact the supervisor they hung
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:16.880]  up on him he said listen i really have a situation at home i need to get home and take care of this
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:20.880]  situation i've never asked for anything before they basically turned their back on him he went
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:25.840]  out to the front of the hotel put a gun in his head and killed himself wow so so so so the so the
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:30.800]  guys flying desk or playing golf partying all day and if somebody after 10 years has an emergency
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:35.920]  they don't get anything so it really sounds like a mess it is oh it is a mess i mean you're talking
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:42.240]  about lost guns from swat non-deployable swat teams um you're talking about flights for fun
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:47.600]  falsification of training records that these people should never even be supervisors or police
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:51.680]  officers because they falsified their training reports sure my big deal is i could get that you
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:55.840]  could train somebody for years like an air marshal to have behavioral detection and that stuff's real
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:59.200]  i mean there's a little body language i mean i'm just a normal guy i can you know body language
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:04.000]  of a thug or whatever but i mean to have some tsa person ask you questions on a power trip like
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:11.120]  they can read your mind and like act like you're guilty i mean it's laughable it is it is and and
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:16.000]  henry was uh directly involved in that when you look at that list and you try to analyze it down
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.200]  um uh you could make anybody guilty and that's the problem with it you know as a state trooper
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:26.000]  alongside the road and you're looking at uh situational awareness and you're looking at
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.560]  things that you can detect on those are skills they came over a period of time and you know
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:35.440]  what's right or wrong but when they give it you a blanket list and go hey take anything off this
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:40.640]  list you i can find your grandmother i can find a assurance like all those terrorism lists that say
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:46.000]  wearing blue jeans or having a cell phone or uh taking photos of the golden gate bridge uh it's
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.920]  there there's a real issue and you lose you lose the real point of it and the real point of it is

[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:22.080]  times bestseller world net daily investigative journalist he also hosts on one of the biggest
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:30.560]  radio stations in the country wabc in new york and he has broken just so many huge stories
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:38.240]  at worldnet daily dot com wnd dot com kline online dot com and his research is right online with our
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:45.040]  research that you've got obama especially the last six years openly funding with saudi arabia
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:53.200]  and qatar hardcore jihadis al qaeda isis you name it to go after libya to go after egypt to go
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:58.320]  after syria to go at it and it's not that those were good countries either but compared to saudi
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.640]  arabia and al qaeda i mean for me that's as bad as it gets i mean they find christians or jews they
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:11.600]  chop their heads off you're another muslim minority you're dead and i mean i'm never for military
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:16.480]  intervention but when you've got five mile convoys of these guys pouring in out of syria
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:21.760]  and obama's saying they can't stop them i mean a couple eight ten warthogs they'd all be dead
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:27.280]  send up 30 you know predators they'd be dead but instead oh now we've got to reinvade and then
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:33.760]  give part of the country to them and partition it that's the mo that i've got but if you go back
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:40.000]  to december 6 of 2012 over a year and a half ago we've got four of these clips are gonna be on the
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:44.080]  nightly news tonight and an article tomorrow i must play one of them now and then go to our guest
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:51.520]  who just joined us if you look at it i predicted exactly what would happen now i'm not saying
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:56.880]  terrorism isn't real i'm not seeing it al qaeda isn't real they open the gate for them they arm them
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:02.080]  they let them build up they give them new bases so that then they can menace europe and the united
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:08.320]  states and so they can take our liberties while they shift and say al qaeda isn't the reason for
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:13.600]  homeland security now it's for the tea party gun owners conservatives libertarians and hillary came
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:19.760]  out yesterday on cnn we played the club and said it's terrorism that you have guns you're not allowed
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:24.720]  to terrorize us gun owners with the epidemic of gun violence even though it's down by 52 percent
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:31.680]  just departments own numbers so the branding of anybody who is a decent person as a terrorist
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:36.240]  is happening full swing right now the unthinkable is happening we're gonna air in a moment here's
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:42.720]  a minute and a half clip from back in december of 2012 december 6 where i broke it all down
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:48.000]  and now it's happened just as i said it would here it is these guys out of saudi arabia who they
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:57.120]  brought into libya next to next to egypt are now going up here just north of israel and lebanon
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:04.640]  they are now going into syria which is to get ready to go into iran over here they are openly
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:11.120]  with signs on the bbc saying we're done with libya we're going to syria they do this 50
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:17.920]  thousand at least they've been given and here's the key not one thousand not two thousand not three
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:22.560]  thousand not four thousand not five thousand not six thousand not seven thousand not eight
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:30.080]  thousand not nine thousand not ten thousand not eleven thousand twenty thousand surface to air
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:36.720]  heat seeking and radar guided sand missiles and they are now saying that when this is in the news
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:43.200]  this is la times mclatchy you name it our government gave it to them our banker run government
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:50.800]  you understand how big this is they are saying that they are going repeat this again to take over
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:58.320]  libya they did that next we're going to syria now they say we're going to iran which is shiai
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:07.600]  the muslim minority they're going to iran and when they're done they're going to us and you
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:18.720]  go to iran through our and the feds which are federal reserve bankers they are absolutely
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:24.320]  going to arm them to come to america attack us and then they're going to take all our liberties
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:31.120]  in the name of fighting al qaeda that they run the bankers run al qaeda to take over libya
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:39.040]  to take over syria to take over iran to take over iraq previously and now al qaeda run by
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:44.400]  british intelligence for a hundred years is going to attack america and shoot down aircraft
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:49.520]  with heat seeking and radar guided missiles they stand two miles from i'm i'm like three
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:55.280]  miles from the airport i could see these guys could sit there and just wait till aircraft pull
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:59.040]  pull off take off blow them up when they're coming in blow them up and they will do it
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:03.920]  and the media thinks you're so dumb they are going to do all this until you give your rights up
[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:07.760]  because of al qaeda and it may not even be al qaeda it may be other mercenaries well that's good i
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:13.120]  don't want to waste our time we only got 15 minutes now with our guest uh mr cline uh
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:17.440]  erin you just heard me from a year and a half ago breaking it down i know you guys have
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:23.440]  exclusive sources in jordan confirming military training these guys what's the big picture what
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:28.720]  do you know where is it all going hey thanks thanks so much for having me yeah well if you if you
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:35.360]  want to get to the big picture uh first we have the information that isis is islamic state of iraq
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:41.440]  and the levant which of course is a front pretty much for al qaeda how they were trained i actually
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:48.960]  first reported back in 2012 that the united states the americans were running a training base with
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.920]  turkey and with some other arab countries in the middle east that it was at a secret base
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:59.600]  in jordan to train at the time the rebels the insurgents that were fighting bush arasad
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:05.440]  regime in syria and then actually this has since been confirmed by the uk guardian by
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:11.520]  der spiegel by the uh also roiders has confirmed that's right we had you on at the time so again
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:17.120]  world net daily your sources this was confirmed then yes yeah so we were running a training base
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:23.120]  in other words for rebels that are highly connected to al qaeda but at the time the united states
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:28.720]  um finally admitted that they were giving aid to rebels but said that they were vetting the rebels
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:34.640]  the uh the extremists let's say for the elements of connections to al qaeda well now i have
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:41.120]  information that we were training isis not not thousands of of the isis members that are isis
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:46.000]  members that are currently currently right now getting major ground in iraq we're talking here
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:52.320]  about dozens but but the larger story actually goes to uh to ben gauzy uh actually this is a
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:56.400]  story that i'm going to be breaking a little bit later but i will first reveal it on this radio
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:04.320]  show uh on sunday we arrested a guy named akhmed abu katala who is a member of answer
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:10.640]  al sharia senior member of answer al sharia in in libya wanted for the ben gauzy attack
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:16.640]  well it's a little bit strange that out of nowhere suddenly we arrest this guy because
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:22.400]  actually last year there was a u.s special forces were tracking his every move they were actually
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:27.920]  are literally hours according to cnn and the washington post hours from arresting him
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:33.840]  but then all of a sudden obama calls for the arrest at the exact same time in libya of
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:39.840]  another terrorist his name is al liby the guy's been wanted since the 80s he he operates openly
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:44.320]  they could have arrested him at any time so al liby is arrested in this public raid and then
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:50.240]  this guy who was just arrested katala uh is suspected in the ben gauzy attack he hears about
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:55.360]  it and he goes underground so all of a sudden we now arrest him so i have information actually that
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:03.120]  katala again he's actually as of uh his arrest the most wanted jihadist for the ben gauzy attack
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:09.200]  the murder of four americans including a u.s ambassador well my information is that katala
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:16.480]  also against the most wanted terrorist in ben gauzy for the attack he was working uh for a nexus
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:24.720]  that included the united states saudi arabia uh katar kawait the arab countries he was working
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:30.960]  before the ben gauzy attack in other words for the united states efforts armed the rebels so it's a
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:36.400]  larger story goes all the way to ben gauzy to syria and beyond of the united states for whatever
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:47.200]  reason uh arming training funding uh rebels that absolutely included al qaeda i am speechless
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:51.280]  right now because i know you've broken story after story you've got the sources in jordan
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:58.480]  the sources in israel the sources all over the middle east and and you're saying your sources
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:02.400]  that have been accurate in the past that they're actually burning their double or triple agents
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:09.520]  right now obviously for pr to get heat off obama on ben gauzy well you know i think it
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:14.400]  it actually could be in this case that this individual katala and i'm sure the other terrorists
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:19.520]  i don't think that they really know themselves who they're working for or that they're part of an
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:24.480]  ultimate uh it's a coordination that included the united states they're just interested in their
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:29.920]  short-term goal of of jihad of exactly because the money goes down through all these levels and
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:35.760]  is fenced through saudi arabia yeah but what's interesting in this case but what's going on
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:42.960]  right now let's get to the current situation in iraq i'm actually not so sure uh i think that
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:48.400]  there could actually be something else going on here in that united states obama repro uh
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:55.040]  carries out this reproachment with iran uh grand grand bargaining grand deal they signed an interim
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:19:01.360]  agreement trying to get a finalized agreement by uh july so what we have done at least according to
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:06.400]  the middle eastern security officials uh here and i'm actually coming to you right now live from
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:12.400]  tel aviv here in the middle east is that we've spurned now saudi arabia so the saudi's are
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:19.360]  really pissed in the past this is according to my sources uh it was of course the saudi's
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:25.520]  that were behind uh the funding of the rebels with the united states first in libya and then in
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:30.800]  syria uh all of a sudden the saudi's are cut off they're in shock by the united states reproach
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:37.280]  mentored iran so i think it could very well be that in this case the isis fighting in iraq is
[02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:41.520]  and actually according to my sources they are heavily uh they're basically proxies for saudi
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:48.240]  arabia uh but i don't know if in this case the saudi's are coordinating with the united states
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:55.600]  and any other western country or this is the saudi's backed into such a corner by the united
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:00.240]  states with this reproach mentored iran so stay there explain it to us on the side this is incredible

[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:10.080]  end i see him breaking the country in multiple parts maliki the president for those that don't know
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:17.360]  we have a zero hedge article with his quotes up on infoworks.com came out and said iran's involved
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:22.080]  in a triple cross against us they want part of the country and i'm not saying he's a saint but he
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:27.680]  is elected and he is trying to be an iraqi not an iranian not a saudi undoubtedly this is an organized
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:32.160]  army with saudi arabia admittedly behind it that's in the foreign news just not here in the media
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:37.360]  watching all the pundits played dumb is ridiculous mr. kline erin kline of kline online dot com
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:41.200]  and worldnet daily he'll be on the nightly news tomorrow for an extended interview with the
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:45.760]  latest developments and more we only got five minutes left with him so give us the big picture
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:50.960]  from the your sources all over the middle east that have been shown to be very accurate in the past
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:57.760]  about what's really going on here with saudi arabia in rampage mode mr. kline yeah you mentioned
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:03.360]  al-maliki and his double cross with iran actually my information also according to middle eastern
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:10.080]  security officials that i talked to is that it was obama that directly contacted the what the
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:15.120]  obama administration that members of the white house that directly contacted maliki the iraqi
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:21.440]  prime minister of the iraqi government and first requested that iran that they allow the iranian
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:26.640]  revolutionary guards in last week so it was actually the united states that opened up the
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:33.120]  floodgates for now these various battalions of the al-Quds wing of the iran of the iranian
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:38.240]  revolutionary guards and to enter iraq so first of all the larger question needs to be asked
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:45.920]  is this is with whatever deal obama has made the united states with with iran does that include it
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:52.000]  really i'm sorry to say what it has to be asked it is obama really here handing iraq over to iran
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:57.360]  that's first no second if if we look at the even larger scheme of things with what you and i
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:04.400]  were just talking about before the break the um the of funding the arming the training of these
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:11.280]  al-al-qaeda linked insurgency rebels the problem obviously it's obvious to you and i i get i don't
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.920]  know if the obama administration understands i hope they don't understand this because if they do
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:21.120]  it means they're doing it intentionally is that is that if you're arming your training and your
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:28.800]  funding jihadist al-qaeda loony tunes who you know believe in this fifth century ideology are they
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:32.800]  does anybody honestly believe at the end of the day that they're just going to give up their weapons
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:36.800]  after libya no of course not they didn't they went to syria are they going to give up their
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:42.800]  weapons after syria obviously not they're now in iraq so we're creating whether intentionally or not
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:50.080]  in al-qaeda army and this is in al-qaeda army on steroids because these organizations now
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:56.720]  have manpets they have uh oh personally have manpets from libya because uh after the uh the
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:02.480]  fall of gadoffy for whatever reason nato the united states did not protect gadoffy's uh
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:08.080]  reserves of manpets we're talking tens of thousands actually the largest manpad reserve in all of
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:12.560]  africa you're talking about surface-to-air missiles i mean this is just totally off the
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:19.440]  charts dwarfing what reagan gave him uh in the eighties and and and what's what's uh maliki gonna
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:23.840]  do or i'm always pronouncing it wrong uh what is the president of iraq going to do what are we
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:30.320]  going to do i mean i mean how how does obama do a deal with iran but then they're also funding
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:35.040]  the al-qaeda people i mean is the plan just to stabilize iraq why and then we know these
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:39.760]  weapons are going to end up getting into uh lebanon and they're going to attack israel
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:44.720]  i mean what is al-qaeda going to do with thousands of surface-to-air missiles
[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:50.080]  in the region this is a this is a disaster it's a disaster i don't think maliki has much
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:54.800]  to say because it all depends on whether the Saudis whoever it is coordinating or not with the
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:59.440]  united states whether they cut off the funding to the rebels in iraq which i highly doubt
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:05.280]  um it but the thing is the the rebels themselves are very little yet they have no long-term plan
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:09.280]  if you give them weapons they're going to use them and we didn't just give them
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:14.320]  um who uh that we didn't just allow them what's there we failed to protect the man pads
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:21.840]  my information is that in syria we the united states gave rebels uh it surf other kinds of
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:27.360]  surface-to-air missiles and they were actually used against uh both asides air force and then also
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:31.440]  we saw them used in sure there's videos of it so who's the main driver behind it
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:36.240]  what does israel think about this where do you see it all going you know interestingly i think
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:41.440]  in the beginning when this started with libya and especially with syria israel didn't mind
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:46.400]  uh the arming of the rebels because they saw syria as a partner with iran and they just
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:51.440]  wanted to get rid of them uh and actually let's take it further uh jordan not only didn't mind
[02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:56.480]  jordan allowed their country to be used for secret training bases and also to cross over
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:01.760]  into iraq well now guess what the isis is threatening directly the the very isis that
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:07.600]  trained in jordan is now threatening the jordanian king to be head the jordanian king uh the al-qaeda
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:15.120]  linked rebels that israel by the way uh unfortunately even gave uh i'll give uh aid to with uh at least
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:20.960]  with um medical aid it's it's confirmed actually a senior rebel leaders were listen i know you
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:24.720]  got to go to me you got to do five more minutes to put bookends on this you know because i know
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:28.480]  you really do have a lot of great sources that have been spot on so if you can't come back and
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:33.200]  just tell us then then then what all the big brains are really thinking is going to happen
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:38.720]  and what the larger is a big new brzezinski strategy or who's behind this crazy strategy
[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:43.760]  of chaos and where do you see it going i mean it's like putting the right wing people in control of
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:50.240]  of ukraine it just looks like a global destabilization program to what end we're on the right back
[02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:55.600]  the empire we got a special report with uh alex german and gcn radio network
[02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:04.880]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more
[02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:09.840]  and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has
[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:14.080]  been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor
[02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:19.120]  air and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their
[02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:24.320]  homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand types of
[02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:29.280]  mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million americans
[02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:33.680]  live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear

[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:39.200]  not just wabc by the salem radio network and he's on with us right now and i tell you his analysis
[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:44.720]  is is just not from some perspective like a republican analysis or a democratic analysis
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:49.600]  or a saudi arabian analysis or i mean it's just really from the research i've seen what's going on
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:57.280]  a very straight up um analysis of what's going on not from any perspective at all just
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:01.600]  of what's happening and he was telling me during the break he thinks bottom line it is the saudi
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:09.360]  arabians going on their own because they're mad with obama doing a deal with iran now uh the iraqi
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:13.040]  prime minister i keep calling him president is just rejecting everyone saying he's been
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:19.280]  triple crossed uh this seems to be the new system i mean it's always gone to a certain extent
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:25.520]  but you lose any moral authority when you're flip-flopping constantly when you turn on your allies
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:30.720]  like egypt and turn the place over to people 50 times worse than the previous regime who like
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:36.560]  start crucifying and christians and blowing up churches uh our media i mean i saw farid zarkaria
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:42.800]  yesterday morning on cnn when i was on the elliptical he was on there for 30 minutes
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:49.360]  with a just evil look on his face going maliki deserves this uh iraq's bad uh you know saudi
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:54.640]  arabia is doing a great job and it'd be one thing if you call bloodily endorsed civil war to divide
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:35:00.240]  and conquer which i think is immoral and bad but the just just the it's like hillary we came we saw
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:06.880]  he died it's all these wimps like bragging about what big killers they are and how they flip-flop
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:14.400]  and how they screw everybody we lose all of our credibility all of our soft power and i just think
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:19.440]  at the end of the day obama is the worst president this country's ever had and and i think they're so
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:25.360]  delusional erin that they think there's a strategy in all this and this is the same stuff i've
[02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:30.880]  studied history that i've seen other elites basically go insane and and that's my just
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:34.160]  stault of what i see happening give me your take on that and then you were giving me a
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:38.560]  lot of key stuff during the break please share the big picture with folks where it's going what you
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:43.600]  see unfolding yeah i mean they're so delusional that as i was saying before that that jordan was
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:49.840]  funding isis now isis which is al-qaeda is turning against jordan and it's the same thing with this
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:54.160]  audience they're playing a very dangerous game here because the very groups that they are now
[02:35:54.160 --> 02:35:58.240]  funding i don't know that these al-qaeda groups understand fully where they're get where the
[02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:02.960]  weapons and money uh... in it for for iraq comes from that it's coming from the saudi
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:09.680]  they hate saudi arabia they see saudi the saudi says i use serpers on islamic land also before
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:16.480]  the break you mentioned burjinsky so i want to remind everybody that tied into all of this the
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:23.360]  military doctrine that was used originally to bomb livia it's also the military doctrine that
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:28.160]  obama has cited if he would ever go to war in syria is something i'm sure you've talked about it
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:33.760]  it's called responsibility to protect uh... which i've done an enormous amount of research on
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:38.800]  cement the power on the on the board of the group that founded responsibility to protect bottom line
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:45.280]  of it is that uh... according to responsibility to protect any uh... there isn't there is no
[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:50.400]  nation-state with a border border is doing this if any contrary is accused of war crimes or crimes
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:55.840]  against humanity the international community can come down to spook and and go to war uh...
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:01.120]  and even if later it's proven that there were no war crimes so i'm mentioning this because
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:06.320]  i tied into all of this actually is that whole uh... access burjinsky uh... international
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:13.280]  responsibility to protect it was actually founded by an organization or that they're one of the
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:18.400]  founding members is called the international crisis group which is where george siro says
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:22.960]  and another member is why i'm mentioning this of the international crisis group that again
[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:26.720]  founded responsibility to protect their president uh...
[02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:31.760]  is one of the architects of it uh... it happens to be that uh... one of the main members is also
[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:38.960]  a guy named thomas pickering who was the lead investigator for the Benghazi attacks so if you
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:44.560]  look at the weapons to the jihadist insurgents it could be that pickering with the state department
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:50.400]  review came in uh... kind of a whitewash all of that that's just a side note no one of george
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:55.600]  soros floating around the background and then they use destabilization as it was a political tool but
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:00.880]  but then they never even stabilize it it looks like it was i don't see their strategies even
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:06.720]  from their sick perspective working that's my point it unless the ultimate strategy is is chaos is
[02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:12.080]  for this is for there to be no strategy or at least for this strategy to be operation chaos
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:17.200]  remember actually it's called the international crisis group they need a crisis
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:21.920]  in order to push whatever it is ultimately and i'll tell you i'm here in israel and originally
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:27.200]  like i said israel i had no problem with the rebels that were fighting in syria
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:33.840]  or in libya but now israel understands oops these rebels now have taken over large swaths of
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:39.440]  territory in israel's borders and probably in the future in jordan probably in the future in
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:44.160]  lebanon right now they're fighting very close to the syria border i could i could literally drive
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:50.240]  there in three hours from where i am right now so this is incredibly dangerous for israel
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:56.240]  for jordan which really is a moderate arab country uh... the trojanian king uh... extremely
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:01.520]  western oriented he might be overthrown and so the larger picture actually is the seaworth
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:06.480]  caliphate it's yeah i don't know if we're going there i don't know if i certainly uh like i said
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:12.880]  before al-qaeda these islamic geodes organizations they have no long-term plan they have no long-term
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:18.720]  government governing strategy so i don't know if it will really be achieved but obviously their goal
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:25.680]  is sure no borders let me ask you this what does obama do when the european israeli and
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:30.480]  us airliners start getting blown up i mean i'm not going to drive up to checkpoints you know five
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:34.800]  miles from the from the airport where they call they're looking for stinger missiles in my car
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:38.960]  when our own government gave it to them i mean i'm really getting sick of this and i want obama
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:43.440]  and the state department all of them to know we're going to make sure somebody gets prosecuted for
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:49.040]  this because i don't see them getting away with it when when al-qaeda starts shooting stuff down
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:54.000]  and undoubtedly you got thousands of missing missiles they're going to start shooting stuff
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:58.720]  down in my view or is that wrong from your view yeah i mean they're anti-western they want to
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:03.920]  destroy the united states number one number two they have anti-aircraft missiles so if they don't
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:10.080]  use them it would make absolutely no strategic sense on their part but you know this is this
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:16.480]  the arming of the rebels the giving to them in syria of anti-aircraft missiles this is
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:21.520]  iran contra times infinity at least with iran contra they were training arms to at least
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:26.240]  try to get some hostages out in this case it's for nothing and in this case we're talking about
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:32.800]  extremely extremely serious arms ambassador steven iran contra was anti-tank missiles not
[02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:39.360]  anti-aircraft yes ambassador stevens people always call him that ambassador steven because if he had
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:46.560]  a political role but don't forget he arrived on a on a uh... a boat in the secret of the night to
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:53.680]  serve as a conduit with the rebels aka the jihadists aka individuals connected to al-qaeda
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:58.640]  he wasn't just an ambassador he was also kind of an arms dealer he was he was working with this
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:05.360]  home nexus and so our fate might really be that of ambassador chris steven this is what happens
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:10.080]  when you play with fire you're not only going to get burned uh... but al-qaeda could could as you
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:16.560]  just said and i think it's really only a matter of time shoot down passenger aircraft whether
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:21.520]  here well there are plenty of uh... you know u.s. passenger aircraft that that leave in the middle
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:27.760]  east of north africa or ultimately in the in the united states that they certainly
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:30.960]  there's another problem here don't forget is a lot of foreigners
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:34.880]  um... from united the u.s. u.k. australia
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:40.320]  they've all joined the rebels we're talking about hundreds of of them just from australia
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:46.400]  and europe alone who have passports who have passports it's exactly it's a disaster we'll
