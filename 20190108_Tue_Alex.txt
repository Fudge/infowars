[00:00.000 --> 00:07.920]  2018 was quite a year.
[00:07.920 --> 00:15.560]  The globalists launched their major counter-offensive, and it blew up in their face on a planetary
[00:15.560 --> 00:25.560]  scale.
[00:25.560 --> 00:28.560]  Why the time to be alive, my friends?
[00:28.560 --> 00:31.280]  I'm just going to declare a national emergency tonight.
[00:31.280 --> 00:38.320]  It's already been declared privately, and the globalists are crapping themselves both
[00:38.320 --> 00:41.120]  publicly but also the looks on their faces.
[00:41.120 --> 00:48.680]  It's as if they're being led up before a firing squad.
[00:48.680 --> 00:49.680]  Here's an important break down.
[00:49.680 --> 00:50.680]  We come back from break.
[00:50.680 --> 00:53.720]  I'm going to lay out tomorrow's news today.
[00:53.720 --> 00:54.720]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54.720 --> 01:00.000]  You know that guy, Alex Jones, the Info Wars guy?
[01:00.000 --> 01:01.280]  You know what I'm talking about?
[01:01.280 --> 01:04.080]  The guy with no lips, that fucking lunatic.
[01:04.080 --> 01:09.320]  They removed all his content from Facebook, iTunes, Pinterest, and YouTube.
[01:09.320 --> 01:10.320]  Good, you fuck.
[01:10.320 --> 01:13.120]  You know the piece of shit I'm talking about, right?
[01:13.120 --> 01:14.120]  Alex Jones.
[01:14.120 --> 01:15.920]  You know what piece of shit I'm talking about?
[01:15.920 --> 01:17.680]  Alex fucking Jones.
[01:17.680 --> 01:18.680]  You know, right?
[01:18.680 --> 01:20.920]  They shut you down, you fuck you.
[01:20.920 --> 01:21.920]  Good.
[01:21.920 --> 01:24.400]  No freedom of speech for you, you piece of shit.
[01:24.400 --> 01:26.640]  Good, you fucking lunatic.
[01:26.640 --> 01:27.640]  Good.
[01:27.640 --> 01:28.960]  Bye-bye, fuck off.
[01:28.960 --> 01:33.960]  Tech companies are taking the lead in suppressing any voices that dissent against the left.
[01:33.960 --> 01:37.880]  Conservatives are feeling the heavy hand of censorship in the United States and across
[01:37.880 --> 01:38.880]  Western Europe.
[01:38.880 --> 01:41.160]  Twitter gives Alex Jones the boot.
[01:41.160 --> 01:45.200]  I have a right to face my accusers, Jack, and I never threaten the media with battle
[01:45.200 --> 01:46.200]  rifles.
[01:46.200 --> 01:47.840]  All the top searches are lies about me and my family.
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.920]  Alex Jones obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying.
[01:52.920 --> 01:56.520]  You didn't call me to testify in America, I have a right to face my accusers, and you
[01:56.520 --> 01:59.000]  Congressman Deutsch are a liar and a fraud.
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.920]  Infowars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[02:03.920 --> 02:04.920]  Google is evil.
[02:04.920 --> 02:05.920]  Google is evil.
[02:05.920 --> 02:10.200]  We're aware of his lying to Congress, we're aware of him and the Dragonfly Project, it's
[02:10.200 --> 02:13.360]  already been operational for years inside the Chinese government, now it's just being
[02:13.360 --> 02:14.520]  rolled out to general public.
[02:14.520 --> 02:23.320]  There is an absolute all out war on conservative free speech.
[02:23.320 --> 02:27.800]  Facebook and Twitter are under fire as conservative users are speaking out about being censored
[02:27.800 --> 02:28.800]  on their platforms.
[02:28.800 --> 02:31.800]  Alex Jones was banned by every major social network.
[02:31.800 --> 02:36.800]  In the past few days, Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, and other companies have all banned
[02:36.800 --> 02:38.800]  Alex Jones from using their platforms.
[02:38.800 --> 02:41.000]  He's been shadow banned by Google.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.160]  Myloianopolis was banned by Twitter.
[02:43.160 --> 02:46.320]  I don't know if you know about this, but Myloianopolis, you know who he is?
[02:46.320 --> 02:50.240]  He got banned from Twitter for writing a bad review about Ghostbusters.
[02:50.240 --> 02:51.960]  This guy is a threat to the Republic.
[02:51.960 --> 02:56.920]  British anti-Islamization activist Tommy Robinson has had his Twitter account suspended
[02:56.920 --> 03:00.520]  again after he tweeted that Islam promotes killing.
[03:00.520 --> 03:05.720]  Also, Twitter purged various libertarian accounts, Instagram temporarily banned Tommy
[03:05.720 --> 03:10.920]  Robinson, Facebook took down a GOP candidate's ads for allegedly being offensive.
[03:10.920 --> 03:15.040]  The FCC is cracking down on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.960]  They're coming for everyone's speech.
[03:16.960 --> 03:17.960]  It's criminal.
[03:17.960 --> 03:23.240]  Their social media accounts are being banned, blocked, and canceled on Twitter, YouTube,
[03:23.240 --> 03:24.240]  and Facebook.
[03:24.240 --> 03:26.240]  Facebook, sister, our free speech.
[03:26.240 --> 03:31.040]  Twitter this evening has suspended the account of Gavin McInnes.
[03:31.040 --> 03:35.480]  As same are the ones that don't even seem that we have been censored.
[03:35.480 --> 03:40.400]  You are caught on tape by Project Veritas, shadow banning people, you are censoring people,
[03:40.400 --> 03:44.640]  you censored me, you censored my love, you censored some Johnson, James O'Keefe, you
[03:44.640 --> 03:49.000]  even censored President Trump when one of your employees deleted his account, you are
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.200]  censoring conservatives, and I'm asking you, President Donald Trump, help us.
[03:53.200 --> 03:56.240]  Please help us, Mr. President, before it is too late.
[03:56.240 --> 03:58.000]  Facebook is censoring free speech.
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.880]  They're making and changing the rules.
[03:59.880 --> 04:02.040]  Reverend Graham was banned for over 24 hours.
[04:02.040 --> 04:06.320]  I had this platform, and that was my main platform for communicating with people and
[04:06.320 --> 04:08.440]  sending out my contents, and now I can't communicate.
[04:08.440 --> 04:09.440]  I've been silenced.
[04:09.440 --> 04:12.960]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning
[04:12.960 --> 04:16.880]  people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives.
[04:16.880 --> 04:21.280]  Authorities in Britain now seem more interested in fighting hate speech on the Internet than
[04:21.280 --> 04:22.440]  fighting crime.
[04:22.440 --> 04:27.040]  They're warning social media users that their comments are being monitored.
[04:27.040 --> 04:33.200]  I'm more upset that some people in Silicon Valley in secret determine which ideas are
[04:33.200 --> 04:35.680]  allowed on my social media feed.
[04:35.680 --> 04:40.160]  So we just see here and just endure the greatest censorship in the history of America, and
[04:40.160 --> 04:44.880]  the left, which claims to be for free speech, applauds it.
[04:44.880 --> 04:47.720]  No freedom of speech for you, you piece of shit.
[04:47.720 --> 04:53.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:53.040 --> 04:57.640]  It's January 8, 2019, Tuesday, global transmission.
[04:57.640 --> 05:00.640]  The day Trump launches the main offensive.
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.440]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[05:04.440 --> 05:09.000]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.400]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[05:14.400 --> 05:19.800]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[05:19.800 --> 05:21.320]  to unhealthy levels.
[05:21.320 --> 05:27.840]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[05:27.840 --> 05:31.840]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[05:31.840 --> 05:33.240]  in the rainwater.
[05:33.240 --> 05:38.520]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[05:38.520 --> 05:44.600]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.600 --> 05:50.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[05:50.240 --> 05:55.560]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.560 --> 06:09.040]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:09.040 --> 06:37.640]  Clashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[06:37.640 --> 06:40.040]  You're living it, you're seeing it, you're part of it.
[06:40.040 --> 06:45.080]  The attempt to take back the United States from the globalist, the attempt to take back
[06:45.080 --> 06:57.360]  Brazil, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and like dominoes, as the nations slip out
[06:57.360 --> 07:02.160]  of the grip of the globalist, it accelerates.
[07:02.160 --> 07:09.800]  And now that we have fulcrums like Trump and others as nation state leaders, even though
[07:09.800 --> 07:17.280]  we're outspent and outgunned by propaganda and the establishment's money, we're winning.
[07:17.280 --> 07:23.480]  Now, Trump has been telling you the last few days that we're in an emergency, America's
[07:23.480 --> 07:27.520]  in an emergency, and I may declare an emergency.
[07:27.520 --> 07:36.160]  He's already declared the emergency about a month ago.
[07:36.160 --> 07:44.520]  Now that emergency has not even been transmitted out to all of the executives and generals
[07:44.520 --> 07:47.880]  and others in law enforcement heads and corporate leaders.
[07:47.880 --> 07:49.400]  It will be.
[07:49.400 --> 07:55.920]  Some have been told and you've seen globalists that don't want to go along with it, leaving
[07:55.920 --> 08:01.320]  not because the ship is sinking, but because the rats know that it's hunting season politically
[08:01.320 --> 08:02.320]  for them.
[08:02.320 --> 08:08.400]  So you're about to see developments in America that will separate the boys from the men,
[08:08.400 --> 08:10.520]  the girls from the women.
[08:10.520 --> 08:17.760]  And that's why I feel really good at a political and spiritual level because we're not playing
[08:17.760 --> 08:18.760]  around anymore.
[08:18.760 --> 08:24.520]  And you can feel it in the atmosphere, you can see it in all the evidence, the intelligence
[08:24.520 --> 08:27.480]  that it's on, baby.
[08:27.480 --> 08:36.600]  I mean, we're about to live history toe to toe with the globalists.
[08:36.600 --> 08:39.600]  People say, man, you've been demonized, you've been lied about, you've been attacked.
[08:39.600 --> 08:43.280]  What's it like?
[08:43.280 --> 08:44.280]  It's joyful.
[08:44.280 --> 08:53.280]  It's the joy of standing up to evil and the joy is a God-fearing person to fill the
[08:53.280 --> 08:57.960]  Holy Spirit smiling over what you do.
[08:57.960 --> 08:58.960]  Closer to God than ever.
[08:58.960 --> 09:01.960]  And that makes the globalists get so upset, oh, he's going to commit suicide.
[09:01.960 --> 09:02.960]  He's close to God.
[09:02.960 --> 09:03.960]  He's crazy.
[09:03.960 --> 09:04.960]  Whatever.
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.760]  My cells, my genetics, who I am, my ancestral memories, intellectually what I understand
[09:09.760 --> 09:15.480]  is just my cells, everything are, hmm, this is what we're supposed to do.
[09:15.480 --> 09:17.480]  Good job.
[09:17.480 --> 09:23.880]  Fire in the kite.
[09:23.880 --> 09:29.520]  Because there's been a total shift in just the last month across the planet.
[09:29.520 --> 09:36.880]  And now everything we've talked about and everything we've done is going to now just
[09:36.880 --> 09:44.560]  become mainstream so that humanity has a choice of what decision they want to make to be seduced
[09:44.560 --> 09:52.320]  by the globalist and by the high-tech gadgetry of the Antichrist or God.
[09:52.320 --> 09:57.560]  And then we go in to the plunge down the road, this is the preparation for that, get some
[09:57.560 --> 10:01.240]  air before you get sucked under, but then we're going to pop back up on the other side
[10:01.240 --> 10:03.840]  and that's the victory.
[10:03.840 --> 10:06.720]  And it's all proceeding according to God's plan.
[10:06.720 --> 10:10.080]  And that's really what's so good about this, despite all the evil and all the horrible
[10:10.080 --> 10:11.880]  things going on, we know there's God's plan.
[10:11.880 --> 10:14.760]  But let me tell you what Trump's up to.
[10:14.760 --> 10:16.640]  He's already declared a national emergency.
[10:16.640 --> 10:20.760]  He's going to officially do it tonight.
[10:20.760 --> 10:25.640]  And there's a bargaining chip of where, oh, if you just capitulate to what I want and
[10:25.640 --> 10:30.480]  build the wall, it'll be such a stinging defeat for the Democrats, Trump won't openly announce
[10:30.480 --> 10:32.200]  the emergency.
[10:32.200 --> 10:43.960]  So there's a little bit of nuance in the parlance of the nomenclature and the symbolism, but
[10:43.960 --> 10:47.760]  either way, Trump wins by taking action.
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.600]  And the enemy came and sued for peace two years ago, anyone, and then lied the whole
[10:52.600 --> 10:55.320]  time and said, we'll work with you, just don't destroy us.
[10:55.320 --> 10:58.880]  And then he just can't believe, like, you won't be destroyed, you're criminals, you'll
[10:58.880 --> 11:02.080]  still have your wealth and you still want to screw the country over because you've got
[11:02.080 --> 11:06.240]  some spiritual heart on to defeat it.
[11:06.240 --> 11:08.840]  Trump's not aligned with the devil, folks.
[11:08.840 --> 11:13.280]  He's not aligned with just ruining families and screwing little kids up and starting wars
[11:13.280 --> 11:20.040]  for no reason and killing our military in blood and sand, sand and blood.
[11:20.040 --> 11:24.560]  And so you're now seeing the real Trump, oh, that, you know, they have Colbert and everybody
[11:24.560 --> 11:29.760]  get up in the last few weeks and say, oh, Trump, please be Trump.
[11:29.760 --> 11:34.680]  Just like all the same late night, fake news people, posing as comedians, said, oh, please
[11:34.680 --> 11:42.760]  be the nominee, ha, well, now they're, oh, please, please, please just be yourself.
[11:42.760 --> 11:48.400]  You've gotten rid of Mattis who they built up like God and Kelly who they took a Virgin
[11:48.400 --> 11:56.480]  Mary or something and now they're like, oh, please, please be yourself.
[11:56.480 --> 11:57.480]  Okay.
[11:57.480 --> 11:58.480]  All these people are fired.
[11:58.480 --> 11:59.480]  Head of the World Bank's fired.
[11:59.480 --> 12:01.640]  She was like, please have a shutdown.
[12:01.640 --> 12:02.640]  Okay.
[12:02.640 --> 12:03.640]  Good.
[12:03.640 --> 12:04.640]  We'll have one.
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.880]  I mean, the bluff of the scum of the earth and all these other cowards put in Washington's
[12:09.880 --> 12:18.400]  alphaloclobalist orders and sell us out at the Sycombs, it's being called the mentally
[12:18.400 --> 12:29.800]  ill, narcissistic, fruit loops are being told to fill their hand politically and they can't
[12:29.800 --> 12:36.200]  stand the fact that they can't scare us and they can't make us run like the old redneck
[12:36.200 --> 12:42.720]  anthem country boy can survive because they can't starve us out and they can't make us
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.320]  run because these old boys were raised with shotguns.
[12:47.320 --> 12:48.520]  We say grace.
[12:48.520 --> 12:50.280]  We say amen.
[12:50.280 --> 12:54.360]  And if you ain't into that, we don't give a damn, which is saying we're not hypocrite
[12:54.360 --> 12:55.360]  Pharisees.
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.360]  We'll take the Lord's name in vain when we get angry, but we'll die for God at the end
[13:00.360 --> 13:07.320]  of the day because we're not perfect, but we're aligned with God, not with the devil.
[13:07.320 --> 13:10.320]  But we sure as hell know the devil.
[13:10.320 --> 13:15.200]  Like Keith Whitley says, I fought with the devil, got down his level, but I never gave
[13:15.200 --> 13:16.200]  in.
[13:16.200 --> 13:17.200]  So he gave up on me.
[13:17.200 --> 13:18.800]  And that's why I know the devil.
[13:18.800 --> 13:21.880]  I know the devil well.
[13:21.880 --> 13:32.080]  So for anyone that has discernment, you look at somebody like the new governor of California
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.480]  Gavin Newsom, the first time I saw him like five years ago when he was the attorney general,
[13:36.480 --> 13:40.560]  I went out like my heart skipped a beat and I went, who is that demon?
[13:40.560 --> 13:42.080]  That must be a Democrat.
[13:42.080 --> 13:44.960]  And sure enough, it flashed up Democrat.
[13:44.960 --> 13:52.960]  The man is Frank Bateman from American Psycho and Patrick Bateman and everything he does
[13:52.960 --> 13:58.920]  is just unbelievable snake oil, silver tongue evil.
[13:58.920 --> 14:04.200]  But if you have discernment, it just screams enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.
[14:04.200 --> 14:05.600]  Protect your children.
[14:05.600 --> 14:10.280]  Red alert, red alert, red alert, red alert, red alert.
[14:10.280 --> 14:15.320]  And what's he announcing that you can't sell guns in California, that if anybody just says
[14:15.320 --> 14:22.280]  you shouldn't have a gun, no judge, no jury, no nothing, just take your guns, he's coming.
[14:22.280 --> 14:23.280]  And he's the new prototype.
[14:23.280 --> 14:28.920]  You don't know what the Antichrist would look like because there's many spirits of the Antichrist
[14:28.920 --> 14:32.880]  and many phases of them and then there'll be the one pure Antichrist, the Bible tells
[14:32.880 --> 14:33.880]  us.
[14:33.880 --> 14:41.560]  Have a nuisance, have a nuisance, ladies and gentlemen, you better believe is it.
[14:41.560 --> 14:46.160]  He is the devil.
[14:46.160 --> 14:51.080]  And if you had eyes to see, you'd know it instantly.
[14:51.080 --> 14:58.240]  That man in the future will be one of the main weapons to destroy the country.
[14:58.240 --> 15:00.400]  He's the one.
[15:00.400 --> 15:02.840]  He's the one.
[15:02.840 --> 15:05.720]  He's the problem.
[15:05.720 --> 15:07.720]  You got to watch him.
[15:07.720 --> 15:09.400]  God help us.
[15:09.400 --> 15:11.280]  It's not going to be beat of them.
[15:11.280 --> 15:12.280]  Oh, Rourke.
[15:12.280 --> 15:14.360]  It's not going to be dumb ass Cortez.
[15:14.360 --> 15:19.080]  It's not going to be Ding Dong, Pocahontas.
[15:19.080 --> 15:24.600]  That's who's going to run against Trump.
[15:24.600 --> 15:27.160]  Bad news.
[15:27.160 --> 15:29.720]  So let it be known.
[15:29.720 --> 15:31.440]  So let it be written.
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.520]  So let it be told next year's news today.
[15:35.520 --> 15:38.240]  Just like we told you, the national emergency will be declared.
[15:38.240 --> 15:43.280]  You'll see it done tonight unless the Democrats cave.
[15:43.280 --> 15:48.880]  Now when we come back, we'll go inside the rabbit hole the next level.
[15:48.880 --> 15:54.560]  I'm Alex Jones, sworn to defend not just the Republic, but humanity.
[15:54.560 --> 15:59.400]  What my name means, Defender of Men, we'll be back.
[15:59.400 --> 16:02.360]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[17:28.400 --> 17:33.800]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:33.800 --> 17:34.800]  the world.
[17:34.800 --> 17:37.800]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:37.800 --> 17:43.760]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:43.760 --> 17:47.560]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:47.560 --> 17:48.560]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:48.560 --> 17:50.080]  Who do we fight for?
[17:50.080 --> 17:56.640]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available
[17:56.640 --> 17:57.640]  at Amazon Books.
[17:57.640 --> 18:07.440]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[18:07.440 --> 18:12.560]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[18:12.560 --> 18:17.560]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect traditions, we've

[18:22.560 --> 18:23.560]  Blend coffee.

[19:56.120 --> 20:21.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.480 --> 20:32.800]  The Patriot Man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold grind.
[20:32.800 --> 20:37.640]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you
[20:37.640 --> 20:38.640]  go downtown.
[20:38.640 --> 20:54.800]  I live back in the woods, you see, a woman and a kid, then the dogs and me.
[20:54.800 --> 21:02.000]  I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive and a country boy can survive.
[21:02.000 --> 21:15.960]  I can plow a field all day long, I can catch catfish from dust till dawn.
[21:15.960 --> 21:23.960]  That's where the goal is to domesticate all of you.
[21:23.960 --> 21:35.040]  Too many things these old boys can't do, but the great, good old maters and homemade wine
[21:35.040 --> 21:44.600]  and country boy can survive, because they can't starve us out, because they can't make
[21:44.600 --> 21:45.600]  us run.
[21:45.600 --> 21:51.600]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run, those wooden mold boys raise
[21:51.600 --> 22:01.600]  a shotgun.
[22:01.600 --> 22:06.040]  We say grace.
[22:06.040 --> 22:16.880]  The times we're in are so truly epic that I have real trouble even being a spokesperson
[22:16.880 --> 22:18.720]  at the tip of the spear.
[22:18.720 --> 22:27.760]  And I don't say that in an arrogant way, I say that with a tremor in my soul, the responsibility
[22:27.760 --> 22:34.880]  and to just say that I am not worthy to be in this position, but willing.
[22:34.880 --> 22:39.520]  And you are all in this position and I just want to salute the listeners and viewers of
[22:39.520 --> 22:40.520]  this broadcast.
[22:40.520 --> 22:41.520]  And I mean that.
[22:41.520 --> 22:44.440]  That's why it's very obscene when you just think me.
[22:44.440 --> 22:50.200]  You gotta be thinking God and yourself, you had good parents and good people and that you
[22:50.200 --> 22:54.600]  love God and that you are aware of what's going on because there are a lot of people
[22:54.600 --> 22:58.960]  unaware of what's going on and they're blind to what's happening and that it's very sad.
[22:58.960 --> 23:02.280]  That's what upsets me is how many men are weak.
[23:02.280 --> 23:06.200]  How many people don't see what's happening, how this country's fighting for its life against
[23:06.200 --> 23:14.800]  really bad people and it makes me get really upset that a lot of folks think it's something
[23:14.800 --> 23:16.360]  special to fight the globalist man.
[23:16.360 --> 23:21.520]  We should all be doing it just like if you see a baby fall in the water is grounding
[23:21.520 --> 23:22.520]  you get the kid out.
[23:22.520 --> 23:27.880]  You're not a damn hero with the bare minimum is to fight with everything you got against
[23:27.880 --> 23:28.880]  these people.
[23:28.880 --> 23:33.760]  And I don't want to hear the cop out that Oh, the UN helmets come will kill them.
[23:33.760 --> 23:38.040]  The UN helmets are already here, ladies and gentlemen, we got a president fighting it.
[23:38.040 --> 23:43.400]  He just downgraded the diplomatic system of the EU so they don't get all our intelligence.
[23:43.400 --> 23:47.560]  He's basically not giving any intel now to Interpol because it's run by the Chicoms.
[23:47.560 --> 23:52.560]  He just fired the head of the World Bank, Trump's on the move and it's real.
[23:52.560 --> 23:58.920]  And about a month ago, Trump decided to take the gloves off and the globalist went from
[23:58.920 --> 24:05.600]  a leering fear, but an aggressive stance to absolute chicken with the head cut off foaming
[24:05.600 --> 24:09.960]  at the mouth fear.
[24:09.960 --> 24:15.040]  And you could smell it and you can taste it.
[24:15.040 --> 24:20.600]  And so I suggest people get with the program and decide which side they're on and stop
[24:20.600 --> 24:29.360]  playing damn games, sitting on a radio show, it's not entertainment, not a TV show to shut
[24:29.360 --> 24:30.360]  up here.
[24:30.360 --> 24:35.320]  So I get bigger sponsors and kiss the system's butt and so I get a jet airplane and I connect
[24:35.320 --> 24:37.400]  nothing against some guys that got jet airplanes.
[24:37.400 --> 24:39.120]  I don't want a Jared airplane.
[24:39.120 --> 24:44.960]  My goal is watching globalists swinging from the ends of ropes.
[24:44.960 --> 24:49.520]  My goals to stop aborting all these babies, my goal is to have five year olds not taught
[24:49.520 --> 24:54.400]  how to be sex workers in public schools.
[24:54.400 --> 24:56.600]  That's what they teach them in career day.
[24:56.600 --> 25:01.800]  My goal is to get the damn pedophiles and devil worshipers off our children's backs.
[25:01.800 --> 25:06.400]  And if you don't hear the prayers of those children crawling out to God, crying and begging
[25:06.400 --> 25:10.400]  for somebody to come to their aid, you don't understand what we're dealing with.
[25:10.400 --> 25:14.920]  Can you feel them crying out to God?
[25:14.920 --> 25:20.080]  And then God acts through men and women and God says you do something now and when we
[25:20.080 --> 25:23.400]  decide to take action, God carries us the rest of the way.
[25:23.400 --> 25:27.760]  The children are begging for your defense.
[25:27.760 --> 25:33.840]  They're begging for men to be men again.
[25:33.840 --> 25:40.520]  In fact, I'm not scared of the globalists.
[25:40.520 --> 25:44.960]  I'm scared of overheating and getting too aggressive and just being as wise as a serpent
[25:44.960 --> 25:53.200]  and peaceful as a dove until God executes vengeance through us.
[25:53.200 --> 26:00.480]  And the time for vengeance is not yet, but the time of vengeance will come and vengeance
[26:00.480 --> 26:03.040]  is right.
[26:03.040 --> 26:05.800]  Vengeance is good.
[26:05.800 --> 26:08.360]  Vengeance against the evil.
[26:08.360 --> 26:12.640]  And they know, already know, they're going to feel that's why they were in a claw as
[26:12.640 --> 26:16.120]  many of our children as they can, because children don't know and they're weak.
[26:16.120 --> 26:17.120]  There's no way to defend them.
[26:17.120 --> 26:22.360]  So these weak demons can try to drag our children, but you know, God spares their children's
[26:22.360 --> 26:23.360]  souls.
[26:23.360 --> 26:33.400]  I'm going to go to break down and we come back and we try to get to the news and break
[26:33.400 --> 26:35.680]  down what's about to happen.
[26:35.680 --> 26:42.320]  If the globalist system is the disease, what we talk about here at M4 Wars with our guests
[26:42.320 --> 26:44.640]  and callers and everybody is the cure.
[26:44.640 --> 26:46.520]  And it really is that fact.
[26:46.520 --> 26:53.640]  So we have to understand that what we're doing here is what the enemy fears above all else.
[26:53.640 --> 26:56.880]  But I pledge this to you.
[26:56.880 --> 27:03.480]  I will never surrender in the face of this evil and I will not be intimidated by their
[27:03.480 --> 27:08.400]  disinformation and their lies and I will not try to curry favor with the establishment
[27:08.400 --> 27:13.040]  and bow to their bullying and intimidation.
[27:13.040 --> 27:21.320]  I will stand against the bullies and I will expose their fraud with you side by side and
[27:21.320 --> 27:32.480]  we will defeat them with God's help because the alternative is a bottomless pit.
[27:32.480 --> 27:34.920]  That's what the Genesis says.
[27:34.920 --> 27:39.640]  It's what all the books of the Bible call it a bottomless pit.
[27:39.640 --> 27:45.320]  What's a black hole, a bottomless pit?
[27:45.320 --> 27:51.800]  And when you realize the globalists do evil because they are evil because they're of their
[27:51.800 --> 28:00.680]  father, the devil and not the devil, the little phony churches talk about, but the real devil
[28:00.680 --> 28:12.040]  which is a real entity that is building this entire technocracy to try to trick us into
[28:12.040 --> 28:15.000]  its false matrix.
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.720]  But it will fail.
[28:16.720 --> 28:22.440]  You know the head Russian patriarch of the Orthodox Church, the oldest church in the world
[28:22.440 --> 28:27.400]  came out and said the Antichrist will use cell phones and gadgets to put you into a
[28:27.400 --> 28:32.240]  trance and seduce you and bring in a world government and that you have to understand
[28:32.240 --> 28:36.840]  that the cell phones are mesmerizing you, which is what everybody already knows, but
[28:36.840 --> 28:40.440]  you're not going to hear that out of the Pope, he's going to tell you, you know, hey, a priest
[28:40.440 --> 28:41.440]  raped me.
[28:41.440 --> 28:42.440]  Well, good.
[28:42.440 --> 28:43.440]  You've been given the gift.
[28:43.440 --> 28:44.440]  It's good to be gay.
[28:44.440 --> 28:47.640]  Oh, so pedophilia is being gay.
[28:47.640 --> 28:50.640]  Antichrist will control humans through gadgets.
[28:50.640 --> 28:51.640]  Absolutely.
[28:51.640 --> 28:52.640]  All right.
[28:52.640 --> 28:53.640]  We'll be right back.

[33:25.000 --> 33:47.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[33:47.000 --> 34:02.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.400]  When we cover articles, I never just cover them to cover what we're supposedly being
[34:06.400 --> 34:07.400]  told.
[34:07.400 --> 34:12.640]  Obviously, we all want to look into the deeper levels of it, the different layers of the
[34:12.640 --> 34:25.000]  onion, but the disdain that the propagandists have against the American people.
[34:25.000 --> 34:28.920]  The fact that they think you have no memory, because I guess in many cases the public doesn't.
[34:28.920 --> 34:32.640]  We've been scientifically programmed that way via the television, now the smartphones
[34:32.640 --> 34:33.640]  and computer screens.
[34:33.640 --> 34:38.280]  And it can be said that having a memory is to be conscious.
[34:38.280 --> 34:40.280]  That's a little bit deeper than that, obviously.
[34:40.280 --> 34:44.880]  But there's been a war on memory, a war on consciousness, we know all that.
[34:44.880 --> 34:48.960]  So to have Don Lemon and Mika Brzezinski, the daughter of the famous mass murderer
[34:48.960 --> 35:02.520]  or war criminal, to have them saying on the news, which isn't news, this is literal collaborator
[35:02.520 --> 35:11.120]  enemy Tokyo rose, World War II, Baghdad mob, this is the enemy right here, saying it sounds
[35:11.120 --> 35:16.680]  outrageous, no one should carry the president's first Oval Office address.
[35:16.680 --> 35:21.800]  I don't know since they were doing TV addresses and radio addresses since the 30s in the White
[35:21.800 --> 35:26.320]  House, if a president's ever gone a year without an Oval Office address.
[35:26.320 --> 35:31.920]  I have been scrabbling up against the door of the White House, trying to get the president
[35:31.920 --> 35:33.320]  to do this routinely.
[35:33.320 --> 35:37.320]  But I know he only wanted to do it at key points, which makes sense.
[35:37.320 --> 35:40.360]  And this deals with the border.
[35:40.360 --> 35:44.320]  The global is trying to collapse the country's existence itself, and the idea that having
[35:44.320 --> 35:49.040]  a border is insane, like having a door on your house, or wearing clothes for that matter,
[35:49.040 --> 35:51.120]  that's a barrier.
[35:51.120 --> 35:59.040]  Clothes are a wall, a shield from insects and the sun and the wind, like saying if you're
[35:59.040 --> 36:03.920]  wearing clothes, it's extremely hateful, all these democrats live by armoured fortresses,
[36:03.920 --> 36:12.240]  castles, moats, the Vatican, the Golden Globes, the Oscars, big walls, checkpoints, everything
[36:12.240 --> 36:18.120]  else, that's Nancy Pelosi's, they have more footage, there's like a 10 foot fence, the
[36:18.120 --> 36:23.880]  Vatican's got 200 foot walls, 200 plus feet in some areas, and you're like that's a war
[36:23.880 --> 36:30.560]  on logic, that Latin America's collapsing, that Brazil has a big fence and wall to stop
[36:30.560 --> 36:36.960]  Venezuelans getting in, it's funny that they have a few countries more prosperous than
[36:36.960 --> 36:40.760]  Venezuela around them, and there's no fences there, there's just border checkpoints on
[36:40.760 --> 36:48.080]  roads, but for Venezuela collapsed, oh we got a big wall because you got a bunch of
[36:48.080 --> 36:49.920]  dumb commies trying to get out.
[36:49.920 --> 36:53.760]  The thing about commies is they get to your country most of the time, they want to turn
[36:53.760 --> 36:58.000]  you into what they just left, but I digress.
[36:58.000 --> 37:03.840]  Imagine the president is going to have an Oval Office address and they're acting like
[37:03.840 --> 37:12.000]  it's weird and it's bad, and then Chuck E. Schumer and Nancy the Crypt Keeper, Pelosi,
[37:12.000 --> 37:23.280]  make it up and go, this is outrageous, we demand equal time right now, and we're going
[37:23.280 --> 37:28.160]  to get it, well you only have 96% of news coverage anti-Trump, you already have them
[37:28.160 --> 37:33.200]  hardly covering anything he does, and so they're acting like, this is outrageous, we don't
[37:33.200 --> 37:39.040]  get any time, we get a response, and normally to the president's weekly radio address there
[37:39.040 --> 37:42.680]  would be a Democrat response or things like that, there's not responses by the other party
[37:42.680 --> 37:48.480]  to the president in the Oval Office in times of crisis talking to the American people,
[37:48.480 --> 37:53.280]  they're saying no, you're not allowed to talk to them, it's bad, it's evil, just like when
[37:53.280 --> 37:58.280]  he was said in Houston, we're a nation, and it's okay to be a nation, and it's okay to
[37:58.280 --> 38:03.480]  love America, they went, every show is the same talking point, Don Lemon all over, I'm
[38:03.480 --> 38:09.520]  sorry, I just saw that, I'm sorry, some children probably saw that, he just said that fish
[38:09.520 --> 38:14.960]  from in the ocean, excuse me, sky's blue, he was just like, a mother just gave their
[38:14.960 --> 38:23.600]  baby milk, I'm sorry, whoa, he just closed the car door before he started it, oh my god,
[38:23.600 --> 38:28.920]  it's like, he said we're a country, we have never seen, I'm speechless right now, he actually
[38:28.920 --> 38:34.240]  was like, I'm speechless, hi, hi, hi, hi, and simultaneously every channel was saying it,
[38:34.240 --> 38:39.520]  Fox News was the moderator, like is it okay to say we're a country, that's like super
[38:39.520 --> 38:44.600]  evil right there, but they're the right wing, right wing's like maybe we're allowed to be
[38:44.600 --> 38:51.080]  a country, we're the alternative, maybe it's good, maybe it's bad, and then you look over
[38:51.080 --> 38:57.720]  on the other side of the spectrum, no borders, no wall, no USA at all, that's what their
[38:57.720 --> 39:02.080]  ethos is, because they work for the mega globalist, they're not calling for China to not have
[39:02.080 --> 39:06.160]  borders, they're not calling for China to let people in, the left didn't call for the
[39:06.160 --> 39:12.600]  Chinese to not kill gay people, because that whole thing, they've already got China, they
[39:12.600 --> 39:18.040]  want control here, once they get control, oh my god, all the leftist garbage is out
[39:18.040 --> 39:25.280]  the door, that's just the demoralization, Trump's like, I don't care if you're straight,
[39:25.280 --> 39:29.040]  gay, old, young, whatever, if you're black and they put you in prison and gave you a
[39:29.040 --> 39:32.560]  longer sentence than whites, we're gonna get you out of there, shut up you damn Nazi,
[39:32.560 --> 39:42.120]  I'm staying in prison, by the way, that's not rhetoric, that's what's going on, Mark
[39:42.120 --> 39:46.520]  Dice was banned off of Facebook for pointing out that the killer of the little girl was
[39:46.520 --> 39:53.280]  black in Houston, yeah, you guessed it, they said it was racist, that's right, I'll play
[39:53.280 --> 39:58.160]  that report, we come back, only a matter of time, you're just too good, Mark, they're
[39:58.160 --> 40:05.960]  gonna get you too, until we do something about these people, and he goes over all the crime
[40:05.960 --> 40:10.880]  statistics that is the big no-no, you're not supposed to touch, because you saw the black
[40:10.880 --> 40:15.240]  community in Houston was like, there's an epidemic, whites are killing us everywhere,
[40:15.240 --> 40:20.280]  statistically, the rarest thing in this country is an Asian killing anybody, the next thing
[40:20.280 --> 40:25.760]  is a white person killing a black person, whites kill some white people, it's always
[40:25.760 --> 40:32.400]  emotional, almost always, just like blacks do it emotionally, and blacks tend to kill
[40:32.400 --> 40:36.960]  black people in a whole damn lot of them, 90 plus percent of blacks killed are killed
[40:36.960 --> 40:42.840]  by blacks, that's just a fact, half the murders in this country are committed by black men,
[40:42.840 --> 40:51.080]  six-and-a-half percent of the population, and Mark Dice talked about the FBI statistics,
[40:51.080 --> 41:01.000]  and he is finale, bye-bye, you're gone, you know, crime statistics are very powerful,
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.080]  give you a window into something, Hispanics have a very low crime rate, unless you're
[41:04.080 --> 41:09.280]  in a gang class, then in that class is the highest crime rate there is, because it's
[41:09.280 --> 41:12.960]  all like bullfighting, I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'm super tough, I'll kill 10 more
[41:12.960 --> 41:18.680]  people this week, see I study the criminology, the psychology of all this, white people kill
[41:18.680 --> 41:28.920]  each other, black people kill everybody, and Hispanics kill other rival tough guys, which
[41:28.920 --> 41:32.160]  is what the world used to be, like you know in the western where the guys go out, you
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.680]  don't have a duel, pretty normal, but it was all organized, no women, no kids, like Tony
[41:36.680 --> 41:43.640]  Montana said, but see, that's even degenerated, but our president, I haven't played the clip,
[41:43.640 --> 41:46.360]  I'll play when we come back and I'll play the Mark Dice piece, they're acting like
[41:46.360 --> 41:51.600]  it's weird to see the president, because what does that tell you, they're an outside
[41:51.600 --> 41:56.080]  globalist group that have already censored almost every conservative and libertarian
[41:56.080 --> 42:02.680]  and Franklin Graham and everybody out there, and you've got the main Christian coalition
[42:02.680 --> 42:06.640]  just laying down and taking it, like maybe they'll leave us alone if we don't stand up,
[42:06.640 --> 42:11.640]  no we'll all be enslaved if you don't stand up like the president, ring the alarm, slug
[42:11.640 --> 42:18.960]  horn to the lips, and Dauntless to the dark tower came, blow it, we're under attack, stop
[42:18.960 --> 42:24.000]  sitting there and pretending like it isn't happening, like Patrick Henry said, why we
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.560]  sit here idle when the war has already begun, in the north, in the next gale, it'll be here,
[42:30.560 --> 42:37.160]  it's already begun, listen, others may sit there and play games and may your chains sit
[42:37.160 --> 42:43.160]  lightly upon you, crotch down, look the hand that feeds you, and that's for me, give me
[42:43.160 --> 42:48.880]  liberty or give me death, but the full quote is, life's so dear, peace so sweet to be purchased,
[42:48.880 --> 42:52.480]  the price of change and slavery, forbid it, almighty God, I know not what course others
[42:52.480 --> 42:57.560]  may take, but that's for me, give me liberty or give me death, this is America and the
[42:57.560 --> 43:01.320]  world fighting for its life, whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish

[46:50.240 --> 47:13.000]  cry to restore the first amendment.
[47:13.000 --> 47:29.040]  And with your help, we are unstoppable together, do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter,
[47:29.040 --> 47:54.320]  on Google, on YouTube, everywhere, that's the rallying cry to restore the first amendment
[47:54.320 --> 47:59.840]  us who have been pushing for an actual emergency, just as much as we have been very smart fellow.
[47:59.840 --> 48:05.200]  Dan Lyman, our EuropeWars.com reporter on the insanity of what's happening with the Yellow Vest
[48:05.760 --> 48:10.720]  and governments trying to ban free speech or public assembly. But now the Italian government
[48:10.720 --> 48:14.880]  others are joining with the Yellow Vest, so things are getting very, very hot. The Austrian
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.720]  government's joining with them. A lot of really exciting things happening. Devin Stack of Black
[48:20.720 --> 48:29.280]  Pilled, amazing researchers coming on. He did a video on Bird Box, and that was banned by YouTube
[48:29.280 --> 48:36.560]  for some very important reasons. Then Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting coming up in the
[48:37.920 --> 48:43.360]  fourth hour. Then there's the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m. with Owen Schroyer, Roger Stoner and others.
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.200]  But let me just stop right there. I should have been announcing every segment since the beginning
[48:47.200 --> 48:52.880]  of the show 48 minutes ago that I made the decision yesterday afternoon. Obviously we're going to cover
[48:54.080 --> 49:02.320]  President Trump's live Oval Office speech at 8 p.m. Central, 9 p.m. Eastern, 7 p.m. Mountain,
[49:02.320 --> 49:07.920]  6 p.m. Pacific. Trump declares a national emergency to save America.
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.080]  So there'll be an hour break from the War Room, and then you just go to infowars.com
[49:14.080 --> 49:22.320]  or the main page. You'll see live coverage of that. And I'm asking all listeners to go to
[49:22.320 --> 49:28.320]  infowars.com and newswars.com. I'm going to ask Paul and I'm going to ask Millie Weaver and others,
[49:28.320 --> 49:33.040]  some band on Twitter, to tweet this image out so you can retweet it so that people know that
[49:33.040 --> 49:37.760]  is coming up tonight. Because we did predict it. We did lay it out. It's going to happen,
[49:37.760 --> 49:43.360]  and I want you to be able to see our live coverage an hour before. Then he's going to have an 8
[49:43.360 --> 49:49.120]  minutes speech, and then we'll have the Crip Keepers who, you know, have way beyond equal time.
[49:49.120 --> 49:55.200]  It'll be hours of Chuck E. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi up there trying to put on their whole
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.360]  confidence act and run this country in the ground with the Chai comms and others. But they are the
[49:59.360 --> 50:05.200]  anti-American party. Governor Cuomo, all of them have said America was never great. It'll never
[50:05.200 --> 50:10.720]  be great. So that's in the pro livers and gun owners are not welcome in New York. Just period.
[50:10.720 --> 50:16.800]  Just all gun owners get out. These are monstrous pig creatures. And now he's begging people to not
[50:16.800 --> 50:23.680]  leave New York. And Pelosi's begging to not leave. So they want to plant through a government,
[50:23.680 --> 50:34.240]  so there's nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide. Now, I want to get to what I was mentioning
[50:34.240 --> 50:39.200]  earlier because it's not just that Don Lemon's an idiot, or there's a Brigadier Brzezinski as a
[50:39.200 --> 50:46.640]  criminal, or the daughter of a war criminal and an anti-American hussy. It's, you know,
[50:47.680 --> 50:51.680]  what I guess, engaged to the guy that had the dead interns, brains bashed out in his office.
[50:52.320 --> 51:00.480]  And they all got covered up, lying, scumbags. It's that, it's all over the news, not just those.
[51:00.480 --> 51:10.080]  We have those clips saying we must get Trump off the air. Trump can't be heard. He, the TV
[51:10.080 --> 51:15.280]  network shouldn't cover it. Oh, did he have hate speech? Oh, was he a racist? Oh, was he anti-Semitic?
[51:15.280 --> 51:20.080]  Oh, did he hurt the Easter Bunny? Oh, you know, first let's get rid of Alex Jones, and now let's
[51:20.080 --> 51:24.800]  get rid of Franklin Graham, and now let's get rid of Donald Trump. Don't people get that when you've
[51:24.800 --> 51:32.320]  got them trying to keep the president off the air. It's outrageous. And it just shows how
[51:32.320 --> 51:36.640]  obsolete these people are. But you see, if he wasn't on those channels that nobody watches,
[51:36.640 --> 51:42.720]  they want him off the internet. They want him out of the White House. These are true people,
[51:42.720 --> 51:48.720]  predators, that think flyover country in America are a bunch of morons. They think they own Black
[51:48.720 --> 51:59.680]  people. It's amazing. Yeah, Trump's come out and talked about all the mysticious, suspicious
[51:59.680 --> 52:06.000]  things that have happened around. Psycho Joe Scarborough. So I'm going to play a few of these
[52:06.000 --> 52:11.760]  clips. First we'll play Mika and then we'll play Don Lemon. Just to illustrate, they say Trump's a
[52:11.760 --> 52:16.800]  Russian agent. We're all foreign agents. Oh, no, no, you're the globalist. You hate America. It's
[52:16.800 --> 52:21.280]  who you are. The Night Circuit ruled American flags or hate symbols. It can't be in schools.
[52:23.920 --> 52:30.480]  San Francisco doesn't like the American flag. The enemy doesn't like your flag. It's pretty damn
[52:30.480 --> 52:35.440]  obvious. Couldn't be more obvious. It's more obvious than the nose on our faces. And we just try to
[52:35.440 --> 52:42.400]  debate him or, oh, let's not say anything. The media's enemy operations, you better be attacked
[52:42.400 --> 52:51.200]  by these trash or you're not doing your damn job. They literally, they don't just lie. They
[52:51.200 --> 52:58.000]  organize the line. They put out the talking points and they regurgitate, lie upon lie upon lie.
[52:59.360 --> 53:06.000]  Briefly to find our operation plus the great products. We have three products that in the
[53:06.000 --> 53:22.480]  new year are 50% off at inforstore.com. And those are bodies, ultimate turmeric formula with 95%
[53:22.480 --> 53:31.040]  trachumenoid, super male vitality, super female vitality, and X3, the triple iodine stabilized
[53:31.040 --> 53:36.640]  by vitamin C, including the deep breath crystal, pure atomic iodine. But we found it's uploaded
[53:36.640 --> 53:41.760]  better. A little bit of the other two iodines and with the vitamin C, tiny amount to stabilize it.
[53:41.760 --> 53:49.440]  It's amazing. X3, 50% off. Super male vitality is our best-seller overall. It's neck and neck
[53:49.440 --> 53:54.240]  sometimes with brain force plus. But overall, it's our most profitable product. Brain force is
[53:54.240 --> 54:03.360]  super inexpensive, super high quality, 4,000 plus reviews, 4.6 stars, thousands of reviews, 91%.
[54:04.000 --> 54:11.040]  It's cold pressed, a whole bunch of known herbs that have been wildcrafted, but then aged to just
[54:11.040 --> 54:15.440]  be really, really strong for libido, stamina, energy. It's amazing. You know, I've done joke
[54:15.440 --> 54:20.320]  videos about it where I fly like Superman. The media said, Jones claims a picture fly. He's insane.
[54:20.320 --> 54:32.160]  No, it's cold satire. But it is the last run of it because it's wildcrafted and we keep having
[54:32.160 --> 54:38.000]  trouble getting it. And I just got tired of messing with it. And, you know, if we ever are able to
[54:39.280 --> 54:44.160]  do it again, it's just kind of limited runs. And then it's not there. So this is the last run. There's
[54:44.160 --> 54:48.640]  not much left of it. There's a lot of the super female which is a similar formula works even better
[54:48.640 --> 54:54.320]  on women we found for stamina and something else particularly called libido. But you got experience
[54:54.320 --> 55:00.080]  of yourself. But it's never been a best seller with women. You sell five times more to men. Men,
[55:00.080 --> 55:04.160]  you should get a bottle for your ladies. But the male is almost sold out. We've got a lot of the
[55:04.160 --> 55:08.960]  female, but you know, a couple months, three months or so, it'll be gone. So this is your guaranteed
[55:08.960 --> 55:13.600]  last chance to get it by guaranteed. This is a guaranteed last time you can get it. I hope down
[55:13.600 --> 55:18.640]  the road we get more supplies or whatever. But I mean, it could be six months a year, if ever,
[55:18.640 --> 55:24.000]  to get a super male and super female vitality. And listen, we're not going to sit here and make
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.960]  all the different claims. Jeff Bezos that owns Amazon and Whole Foods, biggest sellers in the
[55:28.960 --> 55:32.640]  world, they can make all the claims in one whole day. The government leaves them alone. We can't
[55:32.640 --> 55:37.600]  say that you need air to live or the FDA would come arrest me. Of course, you have to have air
[55:37.600 --> 55:42.000]  to live. You got to have water, but got to have vitamin C, got to have iodine. But they'll tell
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.880]  you know, and then try to lower the level till it's non-existent. And then, you know, have Golden
[55:46.880 --> 55:50.880]  Globes awards of people getting shots in the crowd of deadly vaccines. I mean, this is what they do.
[55:51.440 --> 55:58.240]  But all I can tell you is if it's turmeric or if it's iodine or if it's a good, healthy brain pill,
[55:58.240 --> 56:04.160]  brain force plus, whatever it is, it is the best. And by the way, those are giant hypodermic needles
[56:04.800 --> 56:09.680]  with 20 times the amount of the CC they put in somebody. These aren't even real shots.
[56:09.680 --> 56:14.320]  So they're not even, they're not even, I'm going to get that later. They're not even giving them
[56:14.320 --> 56:21.040]  real shots. My God, what a hoax. What a scandal. How sick. Oh, we're the government. It's fun.
[56:21.040 --> 56:25.920]  You're Hollywood. If men in white lab coats give you shots, and then you go bye-bye.
[56:27.440 --> 56:31.040]  All over people are having convulsions, dying. Kids don't talk after they get the shots.
[56:31.760 --> 56:36.880]  Kids don't walk. Kids die. And it's like, it's fun. Everything's awesome when you're part of a team.
[56:36.880 --> 56:41.920]  So Mike Adams is popping in. I'll get to the Mark Dice, clip him a little bit behind,
[56:41.920 --> 56:44.640]  band off Facebook, and we're going to get to the
[56:46.080 --> 56:52.480]  Mika Brzezinski and Ding Dong Lemon and all of them up there going, it's incredible. Can you believe
[56:52.480 --> 56:57.840]  he thinks he can talk to the nation? This is preposterous. Why, we can't have a grand dragon
[56:57.840 --> 57:01.760]  up there. Oh, it's a real grand dragon like Senator Burr with Hillary. Well, then it's
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.000]  and Hillary saying blacks aren't, you know, humans, they're dogs and have to be taught to heal.
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.680]  But you can't have Trump, you know, who actually tried to reform the criminal justice system and
[57:09.680 --> 57:14.000]  did, you can't have that. You can't have me on air because I'm telling the truth either.
[57:15.840 --> 57:19.520]  So we'll be right back with the next hour. There's so much more to get to. But tonight,
[57:20.160 --> 57:24.560]  tell everybody, you know, on local radio stations, TV stations and infowars.com,
[57:24.560 --> 57:31.280]  newswars.com and everywhere else, live coverage of Trump's historic declaration of emergency.

[59:53.600 --> 59:56.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.640]  Tonight, 7 o'clock, we'll have lines from it, the president has sent to declare a national
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:09.040]  emergency to stop the global from imploding the nation. Coming up, Mike Adams has been pushing
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:15.280]  for this with Infowars joins us, but first, a key report from Mark Dice. Well guys, I couldn't
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:20.880]  even make it one full week into 2019 without getting suspended by one of the major social media
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.800]  platforms for posting what they said was hate speech. Facebook blocked me out of my account for
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:32.160]  seven days and censored this post because I simply stated the fact that the only reason that the
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.280]  story about the seven-year-old girl who was tragically shot and killed in Houston went viral
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:43.280]  is because the suspect initially was white, so every Black Lives Matter activist on social media
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:48.160]  started tweeting about this terrible white terrorist who killed his poor innocent girl,
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:53.600]  only it turns out that the murderer was actually a Black man. By now, they've all forgotten her name
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:58.320]  and don't even remember that the incident happened, but before the identity of the actual shooter was
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.360]  revealed, people are tweeting out things like this, her picture with a tweet saying this is
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.560]  seven-year-old Jasmine Barnes. She was shot and killed by America's real terrorist threat,
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:14.080]  a white man who opened fire on her family's car as they left Walmart in Houston. Here's the young
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:19.200]  Turks host Chunk Dugger saying that the shooter may be a white Donald Trump supporter who was
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.480]  incited by the president's racist rhetoric and decided to start killing random Black people for
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:30.960]  the cause. It's what I referred to earlier. Of all people, Chelsea Manning taught me this
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:40.240]  phrase recently, stochastic terrorism. It's when people are encouraged by leaders of the
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.280]  left-wing acts. The leader doesn't say kill this specific person, doesn't say you should target
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:51.680]  Jasmine Barnes. It just encourages you to hate a certain group of people and then random unbalanced
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:57.680]  people in the country pop up and do the violence on their behalf. And that's called stochastic
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.560]  terrorism. And that's what this one looks like. But they're going to investigate. I hope to God
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.920]  they find the guy. Oh, they found him all right, Chunk. And like 50% of the murderers in this country,
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:12.560]  he's a Black male, which is strange when you realize that Black men make up only
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:19.120]  6.5% of the United States population, but commit 50% of the total murders. And stating
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:25.120]  uncomfortable facts like that is now considered to be hate speech in 2019. As you know, I rarely
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.520]  cover tragedies on this channel because I try to make my videos fun and make them to function as a
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.840]  sort of release valve so that you guys can laugh at the madness going on in the mainstream media.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.000]  But obviously, some issues aren't a laughing matter. And sometimes we do have to get serious.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.120]  One of those issues we're going to be facing a lot of this year, unfortunately,
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.440]  is censorship. Because in 2019, apparently, you're not allowed to state certain facts,
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.040]  like there's a lot of murders in the Black community. And most of it barely makes a
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.240]  blip on the radar unless one of the perpetrators or suspects is supposedly white. In fact,
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.800]  if you were to tune into the local news in Chicago, Milwaukee, Baltimore, or Detroit,
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.600]  any night of the week, this is exactly what you would see.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.720]  24-year-old DiMario Jackson has been charged with first-degree reckless homicide. He's accused
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:12.640]  of firing shots into a crown during a fight. One bullet hit 14-year-old Yaffet Moore.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:18.880]  That breaking news, the third suspect charged in the murder of 9-year-old Zalaya Jenkins has been
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:24.240]  arrested. New at 10, two cousins charged in connection with the murder of a delivery driver,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.520]  one of the defendants just 17 years old. Tonight, new information about the suspect
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:34.720]  in a killing spree that crossed state lines. That shocking shooting rampage ended with four
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.360]  people dead on the West Side. Points begin tonight and the new year with three teenagers
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.320]  behind bars accused of failing shooting another teen outside the Eastland Center Mall last Saturday.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.400]  All of these are tragedies. And all of these stories are just 15-second sound bites on the
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.640]  local news and that are completely forgotten about by everyone except for those directly
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.520]  affected like the victims' families and friends. But if the perpetrator is white or suspected to
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:02.560]  be white and the victim is black, the race-baiting Black Lives Matter activists will sink their
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:08.240]  teeth into the story and amplify it to a national level, creating a wedge between the different
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.520]  races as part of their divide and conquer strategy. And speaking of censorship, President Trump's
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.320]  going to be issuing a prime-time television address tonight about the illegal immigration crisis,
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.360]  and many of the major networks struggled with the decision about whether or not they were going to
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:29.760]  even air it. CNN's little Price Delta tweeted out that a TV executive texted him saying that he,
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.360]  President Trump, calls us fake news all the time, but needs access to the airwaves. If we give him
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:41.600]  the time, he'll deliver a fact-free screed without a rebuttal. And if we don't give him the time,
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:47.200]  he'll call every network partisan, so we're damned if we do and damned if we don't.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.760]  All of the major networks dragged their feet and were reluctant to confirm or deny
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:05:15.760]  whether or not they would or would not air the address.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.520]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storable food so it's a total win-win.

[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:15.520]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:22.800]  A nighttime Oval Office address can unite the country in trying times. It can inspire the
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:29.040]  better angels and ourselves. But all the signs here indicate that is not what Donald Trump has
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:34.560]  in mind and the networks have a decision to make. Do they want to run the promise of more lies,
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:40.080]  more misleading statistics, more twisting of reality, mindless confrontation, all for the
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:45.680]  sake of defending Trump's dark, twisted fantasy on a wall on the Mexican border to fight an enemy
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:51.360]  that doesn't exist except in the most fevered swamps of American politics? Do they want to do that
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.960]  for ratings? Like they've done with other presidents and other times, the networks should
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:03.120]  refuse to turn over the airwaves to Donald Trump tonight for what they know objectively
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:11.520]  to be a steady stream of lies. I can spend, obviously, a thousand years going through the lies
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:18.240]  that you just heard in a one-minute clip. Everything is pure projection. The North Africa
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:24.160]  has been collapsed on purpose by the IMF and World Bank. They admit in CFR and UN statements
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:31.680]  to flood Europe. The Middle East, same thing. Arab Spring funded by NATO, the EU, Obama,
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.640]  Google was involved, Facebook, to bring down our allies and destabilize all those countries,
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.280]  kill every Christian, blow everything up, put women and children into sex slavery,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.040]  15 million military-aged men, 80 plus percent of tourism gone, nationalism sweeping Europe, Austria,
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.800]  Spain, Italy, other governments banning protest, France and Germany are just banning it,
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:59.520]  national leaders every day are being shot, killed, or beaten after death, where I can't even keep
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.160]  track of it. They're just murdering people in Sweden, murdering them in Germany, beating
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:10.560]  their heads in Italy. Antifa is much more dangerous over there. It's leftist police,
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:20.400]  dressed up in black. It's insane. And then there on our so-called news saying the president
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.680]  shouldn't be in an Oval Office address when other presidents do them every six months or so. He
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.840]  hasn't done it in two plus years. It's going to be an eight-minute speech. We're going to cover
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:39.200]  tonight at 7 o'clock central, 8 o'clock eastern for the hour before. It's 9 o'clock eastern,
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.720]  8 o'clock central when he speaks for eight minutes only. And we'll have the aftermath
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:47.040]  with these globalists, Pelosi and others. And remember, they're the ones that say,
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.280]  did you hear him? He said, we're a nation. Well, we apologize for families having to hear that.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:56.640]  Don Lemon actually said, I have trouble speaking. I apologize to people who just heard the word
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.760]  nation. You're like, that sounds like a Monty Python skit. But to their viewers,
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.440]  their, let me tell you, I've gone to Democratic events, you've seen the video. And I go, America's
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:13.760]  back. Jobs are coming back. Black unemployment's lowest ever. And they go, they have been programmed
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:20.000]  by successive approximation to hate this country, to hate the West by mega corporations who want
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.880]  to get anybody out of the way that stands with them taking over. This is 21st century warfare. Now,
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:32.960]  a year ago, I said, Trump must declare a national emergency to remove Obama's emergencies he put
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:39.200]  in place with executive orders in the Defense Authorization Act in December of 2016 in the
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.480]  upcoming fiscal year. Billions to fund the countering foreign disinformation and propaganda
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:49.360]  act. Oh, sounds reasonable. Sets up domestic groups between intelligence agencies, but selected
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:56.480]  leftist groups, what Trump calls embeds, the technical term is stay behind networks. And now
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.760]  documents have come out and zero heads will go with those in a moment with Mike Adams
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:08.480]  to counter everyone, whether it's the Christian coalition or whether it's naturalnews.com or
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.240]  whether it's Matt Grudge. They say we're Russians, like they do in congressional hearings about me
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:16.720]  with no evidence. I'm not called to testify where I'm being accused. No evidence is given. And then
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:23.680]  I'm hit with thousands of articles a week, total lies, operation mockingbird, incredible, with them
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:31.600]  all reporting on each other's lies about us. And now the president can't be hurt. So there's a civil
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.240]  war in this country against the globalist who are anti American and against the nationalist.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:42.080]  It's nationalist versus globalist at one level. It's a pro human future versus anti human future.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:48.800]  That's it. That's the demarcation line. That's the choice you've got. And I wanted to get Mike Adams
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.240]  to come on for 30 minutes tonight, whether it's at seven 30, 30 minutes before the president
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.840]  goes live or he come on after, because he's one of the few people out there that has boldly
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:02.640]  understood this and he's been attacked. I've been attacked. Oh, you're crazy. Oh, you're not.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.520]  They declared emergencies for the 2008 deal to get trillions of dollars to steal from us.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.400]  Obama and Bush worked on that Bush Jr. They declare emergencies all the time. There's no
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:19.200]  coverage of it to get around things they've transferred. I saw the Democrat Senator from
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:28.080]  West Virginia this morning on Fox News. And he actually told the truth.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:35.360]  Manchin. Is it Manchin? I'm teleprompter free. The point is all the names cramble.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.720]  You all know him well. He said, actually, we've transferred a lot of dictatorial power to the
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.160]  president. Whether you like that or not, he has the power to do it. And, you know,
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:48.240]  he's got a point about this crisis and he went on from there. But the point is
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.920]  that they've transferred the power of the president to sign it over to the globalist.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.440]  Now Trump's using it to kill TPP to do all this. He has to declare it to end what Obama put in
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:05.200]  and cut through the red tape. The bureaucracy set this up. So we're not calling for Marshall
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:10.160]  Law. We've been under political Marshall Law. The left's calling for civil war. They're calling
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:15.040]  for civil emergency. They're pushing race riots. That's in the WikiLeaks. So the president takes
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.280]  the gloves off, starts firing all these people, declares an emergency so he can cut through it
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.600]  all. Congressman Adam Schiff says the new chairman, the House Armed Services Committee says, yes,
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.040]  there is a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency. And then it goes through
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:33.200]  it. But the fact is it's beyond that. The Democratic Party says America was never great,
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:38.160]  it will never be great. The Ninth Circuit rules, American flags are banned. And then they say
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.680]  those of us that are against this are the foreign enemy. Mike, thanks for joining us. The next few
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:47.680]  segments, I laid all that out. A lot of stations join us in the second hour. I'm not tooting our
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.920]  horn, but it's been naturalnews.com and infowars.com. I mean, I've been doing this for since actually
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:00.320]  2017. You've been hammering it. And notice the one thing they're scared of is saying,
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:04.160]  okay, you're not going to declare an emergency. And he's like, well, yes, I may. They're so scared.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:08.880]  Like, don't do it. Don't do it because they know their previous emergencies in place. So this is
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:14.880]  very exciting news. But also, I think a prime moment of danger, Mike. Well, the spirit of America
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:20.640]  is rising. I know you can feel it, Alex. I feel it here as well. America has an immune system.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.840]  And it's this American spirit that we see now in the president's actions, but also in the people.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:31.280]  The people realize that there are enemies within. There are enemies who are trying to sabotage
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:35.600]  America from within. Some of them are members of Congress. They're Democrats. Some of them are in
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.160]  the deep state. Some of them pretend to be journalists in the media. They are traitors.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.640]  They are enemies, and they must be outed. And I believe that this is the first step,
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:49.680]  invoking the national emergencies that are already on the table. You see,
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:54.560]  President Trump, he has to use every power of the executive in order to defeat the deep state,
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.720]  or we lose America. You know, those people who said, well, he shouldn't invoke a national
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.440]  emergency. He shouldn't declare martial law. All these criticisms. I'm not saying he should
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:08.080]  declare martial law, but he should use the powers of the national emergency to defend
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.920]  America against those who are attempting to destroy it. They've taken us into lawless
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:18.320]  martial law and rebellion. And now we're here. Let's stop denying it. Yeah. And remember, let's go
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:25.760]  back to, what is it? March 16, 2012, President Obama issued an executive order called the National
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:33.200]  Defense Resources Preparedness Order, and it effectively sees control over all communications,
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:36.320]  all tech giants, all resources, farms, food, health care.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.720]  I want to stop right there. Say that three times, because you, I was coming to that next segment
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.120]  that shows Mike Adams does his research. Obama did the most recurring executive order ever
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.520]  that under the Defense Authorization Act, he funded that executive order with billions to
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:55.840]  take down Trump and info wars and Tucker Carlson and everybody. And it's hiding in plain view
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:00.560]  the executive order that Trump must declare his new emergency to override it. Explain to people.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.720]  Crucially, Alex, let me repeat it again. It's March 16, 2012. I've linked to it in the article
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:12.560]  that I just posted a few minutes ago. It's called the National Defense Resources Preparedness Order.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:17.840]  It's on whitehouse.gov. You can read it. And importantly, Alex, in that order, in the opening
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:24.480]  paragraph, Barack Obama invokes himself as the commander in chief of the armed forces of the
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:32.160]  United States of America, indicating that he had planned to use military force to seize control
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.600]  over all resources in the country. It's already on the books. It's there.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:39.440]  And you just took us next level. And it was a month later, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.640]  went to the White House and said, we're going to remove you if you don't back off of this
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.960]  and backing on Kyda. Mike Adams has done his research. This is you're getting the absolute
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.760]  truth right now, folks. And now here we are. That executive order is still there,
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:56.480]  being used by state behind network Democrats. And we're under actually Obama martial law. Trump
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.480]  must end it. The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:08.720]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:16.080]  that World Wars one and two left England broken. It's former colony, the US had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.600]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War One,

[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.480]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:07.840]  bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:13.440]  dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:19.520]  in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.000]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.080]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been incredible. Now due to
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:35.040]  the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:40.960]  crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:47.600]  it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:53.120]  even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it,
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.600]  it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:03.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:30.000]  My love is unconditional. We knew it from the start. I see it in your eyes.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.320]  This is how I feel about America and all the children that deserve to have a good future.
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.920]  From George Straits' mouth to your ears, this is how I feel about you.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:50.560]  You're all right now. Answer all the love and laughter that a lifetime will allow.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:21:06.880]  I cross my heart and promise to you. All I've got to give to make all your dreams come true.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:20.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, Obama signed a group of executive orders in 2012, 2013, 14, 15, 16,
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:28.080]  setting up a national emergency and having the Pentagon over America, globalist in control
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:36.000]  of the Pentagon in 17 intelligence agencies. Those actions are still in place and operating and
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:42.320]  only under law can another executive order or national emergency erase those. That's why you've
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:50.240]  seen such belligerence. And Mike Adams, who's been on top of this in my shelf calling for this
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:54.960]  all to be exposed, is here with us. Executive order, national defense, resources prepared
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:01.600]  on this March 16, 2012. Here's the statement. Obama put the United States under martial law
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:07.280]  in 2012, politically and economically and governmentally. Trump must remove it and is
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:11.120]  about to. And that's why they're crapping their pants saying, don't air this. Don't do it. He's
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:16.640]  got the will to stand to remove the deep state. He's about to try to drain the swamp, the big move,
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:21.680]  hit the first turn of the economy on, stand up against the chai comms, defend our border,
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:26.800]  let us know it's okay to be Americans. And now he needs our prayers. And all of us,
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:32.400]  like in four, I need your prayers too, because it's on Mike Adams will put that executive order
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:38.400]  back on screen. Please. This is the original executive order, March 16, 2012, executive order,
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:44.320]  national defense, resource preparation. You need to go read this. Mike, please continue because
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:50.720]  you were just laying out how this is so historic. And the whole media is ignoring this and saying
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.320]  it's preposterous. The president talked to the people that shows how scared these criminals
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:59.760]  are. This is an epic moment. This is so dangerous. Well, well, the media has become a joke. I mean,
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.040]  they're pretending that there are no border crossers anymore. They're pretending there's no
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.960]  caravan. But your analysis is spot on. All of these powers that Obama invoked and laid out in
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:14.400]  executive orders were intended to be handed to President Hillary Clinton. This was the plan.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:21.120]  And Hillary Clinton, let's recall, had a plan in place and a list of people to arrest, which includes
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:26.480]  you and myself as well. We were all supposed to be arrested and shut down. When Trump won the
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:34.000]  presidency, it threw that entire plan into total chaos, but also it inadvertently handed these
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.600]  powers to President Trump, who has been reluctant to use these powers that Obama had intended for
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:45.440]  Hillary Clinton to use. So understand the deep state under Obama accidentally gave President
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:51.440]  Trump the power to destroy the deep state. This is why they are so terrified. This is what it's
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:58.000]  all about. Trump only needs to invoke these powers that are already on the books. He can root out
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.360]  the deep state. He can arrest and indict the traders who are operating inside government,
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:08.800]  inside universities that have become terrorist recruitment centers, the traders, the mayors,
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:13.040]  the governors who are running these illegal sanctuary cities, they need to be investigated.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:18.560]  Trump has the power to do this and he must invoke this power in order to defeat the deep state and
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:23.840]  then restore true liberty and national security to our country. That's what we are demanding. And
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.520]  I think that's the path that Trump is following now. And I even saw the Democrat U.S. Senator
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:35.840]  on Fox this morning when I was working out. And even Fox is like, can he do this? Because,
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:40.560]  you know, they're basically the soft form of CNN, this dialectic. He goes, yes,
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:44.240]  we've transferred dictatorial powers to the presidency. If people are against it, they should
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:49.680]  change that. But he said, Trump has his power and the country is under attack. And so if he
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.080]  wants to do this, he can do a lot under these emergency powers. And it seemed like Democrat
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:03.520]  Senator got in line for this. So that is a big, big deal. It's the appropriate role of the military.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:07.840]  It's a constitutional role for the military to defend the borders. And also, by the way,
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.840]  Alex, you know, Posse Comitatus, it prevents the military from acting as police on the
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:20.000]  streets of America, but it does not prevent military police from pursuing enemy combatants
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  and domestic enemies of America who are on American soil. Military police can be dispatched
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.440]  to arrest and seek out treasonous traitors, you know, war criminals, enemy combatants who are
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:36.960]  on U.S. soil. That there is no restriction against that. Let's just keep all of this in mind because
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:41.760]  America is under attack. This has been my point for over a year, and I think yours as well. America
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:48.240]  is in an invasion. Trump should declare war against the enemies of America tonight. He won't
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:53.440]  probably do that. But that's what actually should happen, I believe, because this is our last chance
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:57.520]  to defend this nation against the enemies who are operating within. And by the way, they go,
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:02.640]  it's preposterous. It's insane. There was no caravan when they were funding it in the U.N.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:07.680]  and it smashed over the police. 50,000 strong, trafficking kids, it's all admitted. And then
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:13.360]  they're like, he shouldn't even be on air. He's a liar. They just used this U.N. plan on Europe.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.520]  This is the globalist plan. Use the third world they control against the first world
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:23.520]  and enslave us all. And so you see, Mike, have you noticed, though, they've gone from arrogance
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.320]  to their pundits look totally freaked out and scared because they've committed a lot of crimes.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:33.280]  They know the real poll numbers. America's totally turned against them. All the thinking people have
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.520]  turned against them every race, color, and creed. I mean, we're not just uppers saying scary,
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:42.320]  sounding stuff, folks. Back when QAnon was saying, you know, they're going to arrest everybody in
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:48.400]  tribunals. I said, Hey, that's this info. This is now really happening. He really is firing all
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.280]  these people. He really is making her move. They really are scared and crapping their
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:27:00.160]  britches right now because they signed onto the Chai comms. Apple and Google moved over there.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.920]  The Chinese communists began using microwave guns to kill our people in the State Department of
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:10.880]  CIA. You notice it's not just Google headquarters bursts into flames, folks, the day I protestified.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.920]  A bunch, the gloves came off in China. I mean, it's been all over the world. You don't just
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:20.640]  think it's Chinese ships shooting in our ships. They shoot at our ships, our submarines, you know,
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:25.760]  sink them at night. The Chinese, you look at, gee, he's freaking out. He's panicked. We already
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:30.480]  have a covert, covert war against them right now. And there's a bunch of cowards in our government
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:34.240]  who've sold out to China that are kind of crapping their britches because they want that Chinese
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:40.240]  money. What they're going to get hung from their damn neck. The globalist establishment is weaker
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.520]  than they let on, Alex. It's all theater on their part. They are really just one awakening away
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:52.080]  from being defeated. If CNN goes down, for example, and can't drill the false propaganda into the minds
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.680]  of the American people every day, it would only take about five days. And by the way, it is the
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:00.240]  stay-behind network. They force-feed it on YouTube, on Google, their fake videos, their articles.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:06.320]  They are the stay-behind network. CNN runs the whole thing. And remember, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:11.040]  you know, I'm sorry to say, she appears to be close to passing. I'm very sad right now. Yeah,
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:18.000]  she didn't shut the vote. We don't wish any harm upon people, but I think she's gone off the court
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.480]  inside of 24 months, either retiring or passing away. Some people think she's already dead.
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:29.600]  Well, I haven't heard that yet. I think she's probably alive, but I know that cancer is spreading
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:35.840]  probably all across her body at this point. It's sad, but that's her life is about reached its end,
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:41.840]  it looks like. Yep. You know, as above so below, Mike Adams, incredible job, naturalnews.com,

[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:32.960]  to Alex Jones.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:34:00.000]  I wanted to finish up with my gathams. I'm Alex Jones your host. Dan Lyman is about to join us
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:07.120]  our Europe Wars dot com correspondent and his great team over there. A lot of original hardcore
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:12.320]  reporting at Europe Wars dot com. A lot of that is at news wars dot com as well.
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:21.600]  You have the leader of the nationalist mainline libertarian party. They call them Nazis. They're
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:27.600]  not even as hardcore as we are just total crap. They are anti-radical Islam being beaten and
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:33.200]  almost killed by anti-fub that Intel shows are left as police officers. Anti-fub is very dangerous
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:38.400]  in Germany. It's not like methad professors here. You've got people being shot killed. Other leaders
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:45.360]  in Sweden all over Genmark the Netherlands major leaders of nationals being killed. It barely
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:50.160]  makes the news. They're now killing people. They just ban the yellow vest protesting in France.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.600]  They say we'll arrest all your leaders. Period. They've already been arresting and torturing
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:35:00.000]  people. But the good news is they're weak and now Austria is banning the EU army. Spain is moving
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.520]  away from it. Italy is doing an Italy is defending in the EU. The yellow vest and saying that if
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.520]  they are all these articles are on enforce dot com right now by the way. They're saying that if
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:21.680]  they do that that Italy will protest that Israel is even Italy is really Italy. Italy is saying
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:27.040]  that they will stand against this. So there is a lot of really exciting things happening. So don't
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:33.120]  just think Trump's fighting alone. The new nationals president of Brazil firearms going after the
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:42.640]  drug gangs lowering the taxes saying you know God and country and and and make Brazil great again.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.760]  This is happening in Iran with the restart movement. It's happening everywhere. So Mike I just wanted
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:53.360]  to point out that it's not just the spirit of liberty rising in America. It's rising everywhere.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:57.760]  But as the globalists have said if Hillary lost they thought they were done now they think they
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:03.120]  could remove Trump. Hopefully they've got some shot. So so they're way behind the eight ball
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:10.000]  worldwide. It's neck and neck here in America. But just long term we're going to win. But the
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.280]  left is going pure authoritarianism everywhere. The crucial thing to understand you're exactly
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:21.440]  right about that. But the globalists and the left will absolutely punish America and any nation that
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.720]  attempts to assert its national sovereignty. We're going to go through a period of intense chaos
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:31.280]  on the road to victory. This is what's crucial to understand. We're not going to win without the
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:36.240]  left attempting to commit national suicide. They they want to destroy the economy so they can
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.400]  blame Trump. They want race wars in the streets. That's why they have all this fake news about
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:44.320]  you know the shooter being white when he was actually black in that case. This is why they
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:49.120]  are fomenting violence and hatred because they want massive chaos. They want massive collapse
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.280]  just like Obama. Remember the government shut down back in his administration. What was one of
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:58.880]  the first things he did. He released violent prisoners from federal prisons onto the streets
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:03.760]  as a weapon system to say look if you won't fund the government we're going to terrorize your streets
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:08.240]  with violent criminals. This is the way the left thinks. If they can't and Trump saying we're going
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:13.840]  to put nonviolent drug offenders out who've been in for a decade to make room to keep the violent
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:18.240]  offenders. Notice the Chicago mayor decades ago got caught saying we release violent offenders to
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.880]  scare the public into submission. No violent people get their ass locked up forever. Nonviolent
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:31.440]  don't. Well again they they see America as a target for destruction. If they can't rule it
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:35.200]  they will destroy it. That's the way the Democrats think and this is exactly why they have to be
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:40.880]  stopped really at any political cost. If this is the last thing Trump ever does is defeat the
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.560]  deep state. He will still go down in history as one of the greatest presidents in the history
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:49.520]  of our country. He needs our support and he needs to know that we back him and we the people
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:53.520]  are able and willing to help defend this nation if it comes to that Trump needs to know that.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:58.480]  And that's the most important thing you've said and you know he does know that and
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:03.680]  that's why they've been trying to shut you down shut us down because we're reading the real
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.480]  executive orders we're doing real political research talking to experts and most of course
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:14.000]  experts in DC are scared because they come after your family they come after you but at the end
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.480]  of the day that's why we gotta fight because they're coming after us. All these men I know go man
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:24.320]  I'm not gonna stand up for the country they'll come after you I'm like wow okay I get it your
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:30.000]  forebearers didn't build anything obviously I mean you don't instinctively want to fight people
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.640]  that want to shut everybody up and bring in a new dark age you don't want to be in the field
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:39.920]  against these people. It's just so pathetic that there's a real shortage of men Mike and I want to
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:48.080]  say this to to pander to our audience. Info wars audience are the the lifeblood the blood of resistance
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:53.200]  and and and and not putting up with this crap and I just totally salute them. Well most people Alex
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:57.280]  and you pointed this out most people most independent journalists have a boss or they're
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:02.160]  beholden to a network you know your organization and my organization are completely independent
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:07.440]  we don't depend on any money from government or universities or grant money or anything like that
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:11.920]  we can't be shut off by the networks that's why the tech giants are we're the lone rangers and
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:16.880]  that's why they want us off the air. Yeah that's that's exactly why and in fact I think they can't
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.920]  believe that you still exist and that that that natural news is still on the air that info wars
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:27.120]  is still broadcasting they can't believe it because the weapons that they have unleashed against you
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:34.240]  the economic sabotage the slander the smears the programming every Netflix brother they've turned
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:39.120]  foreign intelligence agencies loose on us they've turned Mueller behind I can't get into it yet I
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:43.680]  mean it's which doesn't scare me it lets me know oh my god these are true villains I've got to fight
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:51.360]  harder well it's clear that you you are beating the best that the deep state has to try to destroy
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:55.680]  you and that's that that's just blowing their minds in fact they have the same surprise about
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:00.080]  Trump they can't believe Trump is still in office they can't believe he hasn't resigned yet but you
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:06.640]  know what Americans are strong and this is why I feel that spirit of America rising all we have to do
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:12.400]  is say damn it no we do not surrender our country we will defend it we will do it I think that really
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.560]  is the slogan here and it's our listeners and supporters is why we're still here they're the
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.040]  ones that haven't blinked we're never surrendering we're never giving up and I'm not just saying
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:26.240]  this to be positive when stuff's negative I'll say it and we're in a hell of a pickle but the
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:33.360]  globalist Mike are panicking right now and you can see real palpable fear that he's kicked all
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:38.480]  the globalist out and is now about to go on a rampage and you know co-bear and all three of
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:42.800]  the nightly shows last week had this talking point let Trump be Trump he's about to destroy
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:47.360]  himself great good no that's the last thing they want so whatever they tell you it's the opposite
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.520]  here's the bottom line brother we have got friend seats to history right now
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:58.000]  absolutely and and we we we reach real america and real america supports trump
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.400]  supports a declaration of a national emergency if that's what it takes whatever it takes to
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.520]  build this wall that's what the new president of brazil just did of course he's got to declare an
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:11.200]  emergency to remove these people exactly and I think Trump should declare a war on the globalist
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.920]  and the nature media is the enemy they're trying to get him killed they're trying to kill us I mean
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:21.040]  it's the truth these people are waging war on us we didn't start it that's the thing I mean we're
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:26.640]  they are so scared we're going to fight back we are in a war it's time to declare it it's time
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:32.800]  to rise up and identify the enemies within who are waging this war to disassemble and obliterate
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:38.720]  america and this war on america has been going on since 2008 and let's be a trillion percent clear
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:45.280]  they started it they won't back down their fair game period they drew first blood period period

[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:20.480]  trump every americans should have got behind the president at that point but no the colleges all

[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:37.520]  from the info wars dot com studio it's alex jones now by the way if trump doesn't declare an
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:42.160]  actual emergency tonight that's not discrediting the info wars because you've heard us for over
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:46.960]  a year saying he needs to declare one we're in an emergency so go ahead declare it now he says
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:51.680]  we're already in an emergency i should declare it unless the democrats do the right thing and pay
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:48:00.720]  for the wall but only the emergency can remove the other executive orders of barack hussein obama
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:07.920]  document cam shot please executive order national defense resource preparedness puts the military
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:13.840]  and the president but they put stay behind networks in in control this is what obama's been using
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:19.520]  to circumvent and still be basically a shadow president and you hear trump talking about how
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.080]  they have in beds and hillary and obama are still present but i respect zero hedge they are some of
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.720]  the smartest cookies out there and they say trump will not invoke emergency powers to build a
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:34.320]  water wall tonight well where'd you start hearing he's going to declare a national emergency here
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:41.280]  we are in an emergency so i don't know who zero hedges sources are we'll find out tonight but
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:45.680]  trump already declared an emergency that's a pentagon a month ago we know that it's it's coming
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:50.880]  outward he says we're in an emergency so i should declare an emergency but it could be a way to get
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:55.120]  the democrats to capitulate to something that's already been done i don't know what the greater
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:01.600]  uh nuances will be tonight but we'll be covering it seven o'clock central right through eight o'clock
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:05.760]  central when the president goes live dan lineman of europe wars dot com are great correspondent
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:12.400]  amazing work over there i wanted to get you on just to point out that uh man all hell's breaking
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:21.280]  loose violent attacks on nationalist violent attacks on conservatives uh trying to ban the yellow
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.760]  vest but italy joining and saying that they're going to support the yellow vest the government of
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:30.880]  that uh you're in switzerland right now what is the latest eight nine weeks into the yellow vest
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:36.800]  and what we're saying and talk of micron having to step down great to be back with you alex never a
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.680]  dull moment to be sure here in europe and of course in united states as well as you've been
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:47.120]  speaking about the latest with the attack on bremen in germany on the aft chairman there that is a
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:52.240]  heinous attack but uh i mean i think a lot of people could have seen this type of violence brewing
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:57.600]  with the way that the media and the establishment have been attacking afd every single article in
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:04.640]  the mainstream media prefaces afd with far right and uh as we know at this point afd is the second
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:11.040]  or third most popular party in germany composed generally of people who probably would also support
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:17.120]  donald trump or uk perhaps just mainstream mostly mainly people's whose daughter or wives were right
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:23.600]  by muslims pretty much pretty much a lot of just working-class folks who are fed up to the eyeballs
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:28.720]  with what's going on in their country and probably sympathize and let's be clear their party headquarters
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:34.480]  has been bombed now their deputy leaders had his head bashed in fighting for his life yes and lost
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:40.640]  in the in the melee also was a couple weeks ago we covered this at europe wars was that another afd
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:47.440]  party office was basically antifa tried to storm them they were on a pre-approved demonstration
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:53.440]  route which they deviated from in an attempt to attack the office and there was some pretty crazy
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:59.440]  video of that and uh and the police were able to intercede before it got particularly violent but
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:04.880]  the afd is under siege at the at the moment uh most recently with this terrible attack the
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:09.760]  pictures are so gruesome i'm surprised this guy survived and apparently if it weren't for an
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:15.760]  interceding construction worker he may not have two viewers viewer discretion advised we're going
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:21.600]  to scroll through this uh antifa is much more dangerous in europe talk about that absolutely
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:26.640]  and they are much more prevalent as well anywhere you go in europe you walk around the cities you
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:32.800]  will see antifa tags you'll see their markings they'll mark their bars they will uh mark their
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:38.080]  territory all over the place i've even stayed in apartments around europe where the neighbors have
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:44.800]  antifa basically stickers all over their doors identifying themselves as antifa uh so they
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:50.400]  they are shameless and they are much more violent in europe especially in germany if you recall at
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:57.440]  the g20 i believe it was last year something like 20 000 if i'm not mistaken left hardcore left wingers
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:03.040]  antifa descended on hamburg and there was an emergency in the city a lot of the uh the the
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:07.920]  ranking officials couldn't travel to the event temporarily because of the amount of violence
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:13.760]  and fire in the streets so they are much more intense here but uh i am sure that the american
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:19.200]  their american comrades are learning from them and their tactics and this is the leftist army
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:24.400]  and that's what gab mcginnis mark dies and others are getting banned you go out and just show these
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:29.520]  methods attacking women and children just the literal scum of the earth calling black police
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:35.760]  inwards you show them uh you know then you get banned i mean the these are the foot soldiers
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:41.760]  but i've seen a lot of people like steven krauter and others go into bars where these people frequent
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:46.240]  threatening to kill people they run like little cowards they are the definition of little bitches
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:51.280]  i think it should be telling to people to see what's happened to gavin and the proud boys which
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:55.200]  you know i'm not going to speak to that particular incident there's some discrepancies as to what
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:00.000]  started all that but in general you know i mean these proud boys guys are they they're um they're
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.040]  married to uh women of color they're definitely not racist from what i can tell any of them and
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:11.200]  they're just kind of mainstream uh testosterone filled conservative type bros who are uh just
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:17.600]  out there to kind of um to protect people who who are being attacked by antifa and they have been
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:25.120]  targeted so intensely by the establishment by even governor qualmo and deblasio and and the uh the fbi
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:30.480]  but you never hear of those same enforcements happening to antifa when they are out in the open
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:35.440]  a lot of these people and antifa should be very easy to identify if our if our intelligence agencies
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:39.200]  are worth anything they should be able to track these people down just as easily as they've tracked
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.960]  down the proud boys well the truth is we know they're professors they're leftist police uh
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:50.080]  their local methods they recruit who have scripts of what they're going to attack in blue cities the
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:56.160]  police are involved they let them attack certain areas and they're trying to foment blacks rioting
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:54:02.960]  that's in the big article on info wars dot com we're in 2015 uh obama wanted marshal law
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:09.680]  marshal law in baltimore trying to get white antifa to get blacks to get violent to then
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:16.080]  trigger a nationwide breakdown but it didn't it didn't it didn't work i mean you talk about racist
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:22.800]  this is a group of white chicken necks uh you know running around posing as if black people even have
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:27.760]  women and men that say they're black who admittedly aren't black who then lead these groups it's
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:34.000]  the most bizarre weirdness i've ever seen absolutely many of them are white if not the vast majority
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:40.400]  which is interesting and uh they do purport to be anti-racists but uh they do there's a quite
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.880]  a racist uh string going through them but i did just want to bring this back to the yellow vest
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:49.520]  you were talking about this story is just breaking right before i came on air with you and i wasn't
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:55.840]  able to get the whole story but uh yellow vest uk it appears there is a massive crackdown in effect
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:01.600]  right now according to raheem kasam who used to be the editor-in-chief at bright part london
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:06.800]  in the past few hours re yellow vest uk have had their social media accounts banned their paypal
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:12.320]  account removed had journalists show up to their elderly parents houses where we heard that before
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:17.520]  and had lies spread about them on national tv and in the media and it looks like there is a concerted
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:24.480]  effort to shut them down aggressively going on at this moment that's right the articles are on
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:31.520]  europe wars dot com info wars dot com um we've got french p.m says new tougher laws on unauthorized
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:36.960]  protests coming in wake of yellow vest clashes italian leaders endorse french yellow vest movement
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:41.840]  it's spreading all over the world this is just some of the news we've got here today uh dan the
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:48.800]  good news is as rough as this is humanity is back in the fight we get there's multinational
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:54.160]  corporations who want to take over society and governments using racial and cultural division
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:58.400]  to get us fighting with each other it's classic vulcanization divide and conquer
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:04.080]  and humanity sing through it i think this is very exciting it is a time of awakening but
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:08.480]  uh harken back to what mike adams was saying just before we came on together and you know he said
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:12.560]  this is just the beginning uh and i and i fear that that is the case this is just the beginning
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:19.040]  of the bumpy ride but unfortunately i think this is a situation that has uh can utmost be uh blamed
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:24.320]  on the establishment the elites and the media and the left who have silenced uh a very civil
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:29.120]  debate that could have happened a long time ago and uh they've taken away the voices of the people
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:33.200]  who would like to have discussed all of these matters long before they were shoved down their
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:39.280]  throats and now at this point i think we are past the point of no return in some cases unfortunately
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:44.320]  so uh we can all look to france to see what's going on and expect that to continue spreading
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:49.520]  across the west if not worldwide depending on the you know the cases in each individual country

[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:18.720]  you
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:28.720]  i've fought with the devil got down on his level but i never gave in so he gave up on me
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:45.840]  i'm no stranger to the rain i can spot man with him and i'm good at finding shelter in a

[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:02.880]  i'm no stranger to the rain oh no
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:08.240]  dan lineman we really appreciate europe wars dot com the amazing job you're doing we really
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:12.720]  are behind you 100 percent i'm always asking the questions but the four minutes we've got left
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:18.320]  what what's the next big thing i mean you already kind of said it earlier what do you expect to
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:24.320]  happen this is just the beginning i'll return to something you said a few minutes ago you said
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:29.200]  where are the men where are the men who are willing to stand up at this point and i'll give
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:34.800]  you two examples of the men who are willing to stand up and the women who are willing to stand up
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:39.520]  and i want to be clear of course never at all endorse any kind of political violence
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:44.640]  however there is violence in the streets so we're gonna have to wade through each individual
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:49.440]  incident and decide for ourselves whether it's appropriate or not now the first is not a violent
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:55.760]  incident we have the a female only protest that began from the yellow vests across france that is
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:00.640]  an interesting development because they felt the police were being too heavy-handed and perhaps that
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:04.560]  could have been because maybe the males in the yellow vests were also being too heavy-handed so
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:10.080]  the women went out on their own a totally peaceful protest in the hundreds in paris and in the hundreds
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:15.520]  in toulouse and in other protest marches across france and they were essentially peaceful but
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:20.960]  they were the imagery was powerful and this is not like the vagina hat protest in the united
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:25.600]  states that we've seen these are real real women working class women in the yellow vests standing
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:29.600]  up and making their voices heard these these are these are not globalist funded women these are
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:35.680]  real women standing up exactly grassroots not astroturf and then to the other side of things
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:40.880]  there are men who are willing to stand up and one of them is a french boxer who who really
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:45.920]  made waves this weekend uh apparently according to him he had just had enough he's been at all
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:50.640]  of these yellow vests protests and he has been peaceful up until his time uh i guess his wife
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:55.520]  and some people he was with were tear gas by police and uh he just had had it up to here
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:02.240]  here and he jumped in to a melee and just started pounding on riot police and full protection with
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:08.800]  shields and helmets and all that and he took down a pretty good amount of them and um and of course
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:14.880]  we don't endorse violence but it was a a moment we do endorse self-defense and that's the point of
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:19.040]  like the french by calls french wimps they used to be the most warlocked people out there and
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:23.040]  then after the poly in and half the males got killed they kind of became a little wimpy uh you
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:28.080]  know to bismarck and all the rest of the one world war one but absolutely what happens once the
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:33.200]  french actually start doing french resistance that's not going to go well for the eu armored vehicles
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:40.160]  absolutely not and uh so this video is stunning and so this guy was identified he was a champion
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:45.520]  boxer um not too long ago so he's uh his face was recognizable he did have to turn himself
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:50.720]  into police and they are threatening him with a pretty lengthy jail term uh basically they're
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:57.360]  going to make an example of him however uh a group was able to raise over 130 000 dollars for his
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:02.480]  legal defense in a matter of hours on one of the crowdfunding sites and he is wildly popular yeah
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:07.360]  so it's one guy backing off five cops in riot gear because he's willing to fight because they beat
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:10.800]  up because they attacked his wife which is a normal response which is why the whole global
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:15.120]  system is meant to shut men down because they're going to do something that enslaves humanity
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:20.480]  and they know there are still some men that will fight exactly and uh you get a few more guys like
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:25.920]  that out there who are willing to take bare fists to riot shields and uh people are going to be fired
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:29.680]  up they're going to be rallying around this and there will be more of them in the streets i guarantee
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:37.600]  it across europe this is just what you're saying is the fuse has been lit absolutely and the the
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:45.360]  bomb is going off in slow motion across europe we're hoping for the best i love it my friend
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:57.440]  dan liman europe wars dot com we salute you we'll talk to you soon god bless the globalists know
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:01.360]  that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:08.160]  fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers iq it literally dumbs the population down
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:12.720]  and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best i out of the world we've gone
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:18.720]  through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:23.120]  and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:28.880]  of pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:34.720]  to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.760]  chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:46.240]  compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it and makes it even more
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:51.840]  bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an incredible
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:06:15.840]  discovery x3 now available at enforce live dot com if you are receiving this transmission
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:23.600]  you are the resistance live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:41.360]  cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war the whole world is in a great crisis right now
[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:49.200]  great flux a great change you know i respect zero hedge in fact other than like something like
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:53.600]  matt drudge they've got some of the best intel out there and they're saying trump won't declare an
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:58.640]  emergency tonight well he already declared it a month ago he says we're in an emergency he needs
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:03.760]  the emergency to override all these agencies he's firing everybody he may have something to bring
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:08.320]  Pelosi them to the table to do what he wants it's a big defeat for him and then technically not do it
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:17.760]  but i respect tyler durgan and zero hedge dot com so uh that's hey i love being wrong okay it's he
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:23.600]  doesn't happen very often uh about big issues i get some stuff wrong like i know the new california
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:27.680]  governor wasn't the attorney general but i was confused with another article about anti-gun
[02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:32.320]  stuff i think it was a state rep and stuff that i said that the point is i mean i sometimes but i
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:38.640]  catch it and i say it i'm only lying on purpose um most listeners are like yeah you talk about
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:43.120]  trump he's declared an accidental emergency when no one was saying it two years ago and every day
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:49.600]  since then so we know your next year's news today show whether he openly announces it tonight or not

[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:20.720]  with uh homer simpson being a complete idiot that's the message men are idiots the state loves you
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:28.720]  women are in charge uh but debonstack of blackpill.com is an amazing researcher and many documentary
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:33.520]  filmmaker and he put out a video that's been censored off youtube he's been given a strike
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:39.040]  been suspended uh that that we've posted info wars.com it's up there right now youtube banned
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:45.600]  this bird box video share and watch the censored material below from blackpill.com we'll add that
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:50.160]  blackpill.com and it'll join us after the break now he pointed out how black guys are all the
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:55.440]  heroes and white men are the bad guys that's one level uh and and again women are in charge these
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:11:00.160]  are all the basic but cell phone radiation and manipulation is what's causing people to commit
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:05.600]  suicide that's the that's the big brass ring here but he'll be joining us next segment here's four
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:13.280]  minutes uh in 10 seconds of his band 25 minute report exclusively at info wars.com the left has
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:20.080]  ruined a particular form of fiction that i i used to be really fond of a fiction where the theme the
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:28.320]  genre is societal collapse not just because i think it's relevant today but also because i think
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:34.800]  it's just interesting to imagine how different people from different walks of life would react to
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:41.760]  the existing social structure collapsing suddenly a popular tv show that that kind of started out
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:49.600]  like this was the walking dead but it's now just become a soap opera where every character is now
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:57.840]  engaged in either an interracial or lbgtq relationship uh the show is no longer anything
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:04.480]  about survival or how society would deal with a zombie invasion just like everything else coming
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:11.520]  out of hollywood it's just pure leftist propaganda and that's why i was skeptical when someone told
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:17.600]  me that i would like this new movie by netflix you know the the company that's been hard at work
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:25.760]  normalizing pedophilia uh this new movie by netflix called bird box but i i took one for the team
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:34.720]  and i watched it anyway and here's what i learned i learned that white people are evil and and usually
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:42.320]  trying to kill you do you think i'm exaggerating well think again this film is just as much about
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:49.360]  race as it is about any kind of apocalypse this is a movie about a single white mother who's
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:56.720]  confronted endlessly by dangerous evil white men and then repeatedly saved and protected by
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:03.920]  non-whites it's laid on so thick that the whole disaster end of the world aspect of the film
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:10.880]  is reduced to a subplot or or actually just an excuse to have the movie senator bullock and her
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:17.840]  kids are attacked by that's right an evil white hillbilly guy he's possessed by the mysterious
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:25.600]  evil thing that you can't look at uh and again no big deal that the bad guy here is white but it's
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:34.000]  every bad guy is white and not just white like a walking negative white stereotype like this guy
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.880]  straight out of the movie deliverance the only way they could have made him whiter is if they cast
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:47.520]  some pasty skin ginger oh looks like they got that covered hey drumroll please evil white guy
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:53.200]  starts to attack them he's an evil white guy another evil white guy morbidly obese pregnant
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:14:00.480]  chick decides to just let in some random guy who as it will turn out later of course will be an evil
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:08.240]  white guy when they're once again attacked this time by an entire gang of evil white people
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:13.840]  as i told you it's every single time and by the way there's an important detail that i forgot to
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:20.480]  mention here some of the people in the movie when they're exposed to the evil demon thing that you're
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:27.760]  not supposed to look at they get sad or they get scared and then they kill themselves other people
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:34.000]  when they see the mysterious evil thing they get happy and they embrace it and they get murderous
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:40.320]  and they kill other people after you know they turn evil and the implication is that it's the good
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:46.320]  people that when they see the demon that's those are the people that kill themselves
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:53.680]  while the people that already have evil inside them they're the ones that think it's beautiful
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:59.120]  and they start killing and i and i only bring this up because isn't it interesting that the
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:05.120]  filmmakers thought that the only people they should cast for that type of person the type of person
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:12.560]  that would be already so evil that they would have that evil inside them every single one of them
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:18.480]  would be white they're the only ones that are so evil that their inner evil takes over
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:25.200]  and i have to add anything sandra bullock involved in is a globalist operation i have total
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:32.240]  insight knowledge of all of it i'm not at liberty to tell you but she is a monstrous pig total pr
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:40.240]  well stabbing the back is a psychopathic monster so obviously with that sandra bullock is a soulless
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:47.760]  pig period just like her film pig box sandra bullock having sex with a pig no that would be
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:58.480]  better than what she did we'll be back silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic and only

[02:19:55.280 --> 02:20:06.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:15.280]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:24.960]  hollywood represents the most pedophilic demonic anti human forces on planet earth
[02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:33.200]  oh no it is the great satan and devin stack who is really a great thinker
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:43.040]  a black pill dot com has hundreds of millions of views on youtube and a lot of success and so he
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:48.160]  did a fair fair use analysis and they didn't claim he violated fair use or valid copyright they said
[02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:54.240]  he's a racist he's an hate monger and so his 25 minute video that's now posted to info wars dot
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:21:00.880]  com they can pound sand if they want got removed and he got a strike youtube band this bird box
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:06.800]  video watch and share the censored material below from black pill dot com we're gonna add that
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:14.000]  black pill dot com to the full 20 plus minute videos there now i i watched the film and i saw
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:18.080]  the women or all the bosses and the white men are idiots and the black guys are all the heroes
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:21.280]  i mean we already know that's in the official thing and i'm not knocking his analysis up
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:28.480]  the point is is that they went i'm not against black folks but they've set up this whole dichotomy
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:32.800]  when half the murders are black males we're only six and a half percent of the population
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:37.360]  where they're trying to get black folks to go out and kill white people and create a race war that's
[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:43.520]  in the wiki leaks so there's a lot of layers to bird box but the reason it got pushed so hard
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:49.840]  and obviously it's 5g causing it the extermination is that you just get all their different messages
[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:53.840]  and this is one of their propaganda films and as devin points out in his video
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:22:00.560]  netflix is like the nambla channel this is the coming out of these people because they're about
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:06.240]  stealing the energy of children so devin thanks for joining us and again he's a author journalist
[02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:10.160]  youtube creator for making videos on his youtube channel black pill since before the president's
[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:15.200]  election focused on trying to get the average person to understand the motives and psychology of
[02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:20.480]  the ruling class as well as dissecting the propaganda that comes out of hollywood his point is red
[02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:26.560]  pills about awakening black pill is about admitting how dire our straits are and you know you could
[02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:32.000]  say i'm kind of one of the modern black pillars it's a good term but not to scare people to but to
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:36.240]  see how dangerous it is like hey don't walk over that cliff don't stick your finger in the light
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:40.880]  socket you're not being a fear monitor don't don't run out in the traffic to your kid i've got like
[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:45.520]  a 20 month old daughter they go out in austin fredericksburg riverette uh you know it was an
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:49.600]  Omaha she'll just try to run right out in the road there'll be a middle of a little you know
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:54.800]  rural area even but you know they're just gonna care to run around the road and car someone by
[02:22:54.800 --> 02:23:00.160]  car so we're not being negative when i grab her from not going the road we're you know we're pointing
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:06.240]  out what's going on and what he was covering really scared him so it's banned and we're all about
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:12.560]  what does the enemy want banned what do they want stopped so debon here's your chance there's probably
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:17.280]  a million people conservatively tuned in that's conservative every talk shows goes oh one listening
[02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:21.360]  area of my radio station's a million so i've got hundreds of stations i have 200 million listeners
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:26.160]  no there's conservatively a million people watching now a couple million will watch later
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:30.880]  what do you want to say to those people right now about bird box and why it's important
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:38.800]  well first of all thanks for having me it's uh you know it's when you get used to communicating
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:45.200]  with your audience through youtube uh and then they take that away um it's it's you don't realize
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:50.080]  how you know much it cuts off you like your connection to the people that you like being
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:56.720]  ridden ridden hard and put away wet right and so i really appreciate the opportunity to be here on
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:24:01.840]  info wars and and talk to your audience because that's that's you have no voice i mean i'm still
[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:07.040]  thankfully i'm still on twitter and gab and i have some other outlets but youtube is really
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:12.400]  where i focused a lot of my energy and try to uh because i'm a visual person my most of my medium
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:20.400]  is is you know video and so uh and it's because of that i think i like to dissect these things
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:27.360]  how dare you critique pedophile flicks i mean netflix how dare you critique the pedophile
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:32.720]  channel i mean you need to be shut up well well and honestly like you said if there's one thing i
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:37.920]  wanted to talk to your audience about that's that's right there that's the point if you are still paying
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:43.840]  for netflix i want you to understand if you are paying for netflix you are funding the creation
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:49.200]  of child porn i mean there's no other way to put it because and people will say like uh one argument
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:54.400]  i've heard you know for people that wanted to make uh the the punishment for child porn uh a
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:58.160]  non-issue because oh it's a victimless crime they're not you know they're not the ones raping kids
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:03.200]  it's like no they're the ones creating the demand for the people that are raping the kids and if
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:08.160]  you're paying for netflix right now just so you know if you're paying for netflix you're creating a
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:13.680]  demand even if you're not watching the shows you're still paying for you're paying for them to have
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:19.120]  the ability to create this awful content in a brainwash people and there's so many others
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:24.560]  said that you do it the 25 minute censored video at info wars dot com but go go through it i mean
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:29.360]  literally they're even admitting they're promoting pedophilia i mean this is the pedophile nambla channel
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:36.240]  right no i like they have that that cartoon big mouth that is i mean just awfulness like
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:43.600]  it's like i can't honestly i very few things shock me and that cartoon was that is is shocking i
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:47.760]  can't even believe no it's almost like i've seen it it's almost like you're participating in it to
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:54.800]  watch it yeah it well and the thing is too i think it's technically if anyone like if any uh uh
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:26:00.480]  uh where anyone law enforcement were to actually do something about i think it's technically in terms
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:05.680]  of the letter of the law it's against the law because you can't depict uh sexual situations
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:10.480]  with children even if it's so big no one does it you know we already have undercover video an audio
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:16.080]  which i shouldn't announce but they have drag kids little boys as young as seven all over america
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:20.640]  dancing at gay bars it's trip bars and they have loopholes they get around it with and we have them
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:27.200]  bragging about it on tape already just letting you guys know we have it well and this stuff goes
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:33.920]  goes way back i mean i did a video months ago about a movie that i think was made 1978 called
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:40.080]  pretty baby where brook shields when she was 11 maybe 12 years old she there's full there's shots
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.320]  of her full frontal nudity and that's the one thing that frustrates me too is this thing was
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:50.960]  this was happening 1978 where were the riots in 1978 how come people didn't you know this was in
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:57.040]  theaters across the country and and i'm telling you it's like roman polanski gets standing ovations
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:01.440]  when he would rape little girls drug them kidnap them rape them and meryl streep loves it these
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:08.240]  are these are these are monsters right and and and and that you know we're starting to see now
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:12.960]  that that's not just roman polanski and there he has a lot of ties to other people some bigger names
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:18.320]  and uh i don't want to get you in trouble so i'm not gonna say what we all know it's basically
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:23.440]  half a pile half a pile listen it's vampirism the raping of children is a way to abuse them
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:28.000]  to steal their energy in their view so instead of just bleeding them or killing them or torturing
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:33.280]  them the next best thing is to rape them and so yes hollywood is a vampire syndicate raping children
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:39.440]  well and i think part of it too in order to get people to just fall in line and to to go along with
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:44.720]  whatever madness that they want the the public to go with they have to dehumanize us as much as
[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:48.320]  possible and if they can rape our kids in front of us in fact go back to the clip of meryl streep
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:53.200]  for radio listeners it's meryl streep a few years ago praising roman polanski at the academy awards
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:58.560]  and right there is jack nicholson his best buddy who was reportedly involved in that that day so
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:03.760]  they're letting you know like here's this pedophile moment brought to you by jack nicholson and meryl
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:08.880]  street and they know that if they can do this like you said right in front of us and no one
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:14.160]  does anything like no one you know no one rioted in 1978 when pretty baby was in theaters if they
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:19.280]  know that if they can do that they can desensitize us they can do anything you know if you know i've
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:24.720]  been at hollywood parties i've been to hollywood in like 12 years to a party and like 12 13 years ago
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:30.880]  a couple times i've been a party and they go like damn those girls look like they're 15
[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:36.480]  they're like yeah you better get out of here if you don't want to i left and it happened a couple
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:41.760]  times i'm like i'm never coming back here and that's just the entry way you know you're looking
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:47.280]  at some girl she's like she ought to be in cub scouts or a brownie or something not at a party
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:52.400]  and these were elite parties i'm telling you the whole thing is a giant vampire rape your children

[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:15.040]  you and kinship and just because the left is trying to turn black people into a weaponized army
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:20.240]  against whites i see the larger picture and want to free those people it's like i'm gonna free everybody
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:26.880]  else but it does really make your stomach turn when you see the analysis in the in the in the
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:33.440]  discussiveness of it devin stack is a really amazing filmmaker and journalist blackpill.com
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:38.720]  and we've uploaded the band video that got him kicked off youtube or suspended to info wars.com
[02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:44.720]  right now so see the censored bird box video this is what we're being force fed and i don't want to
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:50.240]  backstand her bullet i don't care about center ball i don't care about hollywood people i don't
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:58.080]  they read off scripts for the people but whatever she's involved in i mean the way she flushes her
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:02.240]  family down the toilet the way she adopts kids for attention the way she puts out pr stunts
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:08.320]  it was not a lot of folks know about center bullet but she lives here in austin and let's just say
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:15.760]  i know a lot about her which i don't care about i never talk about it it's like i know a lot about
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:20.000]  dog crap out in my yard you know it's going i know a lot about my neighbor's hemorrhoids
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:23.840]  or i know a lot about a god dying at the age clink down the street it's kind of like
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:31.040]  yeah i know a lot about you know the cd underbelly of soulless hollywood crap and the weird pr stunts
[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:38.400]  they come up with but anything she's involved in you can believe is dirt baggery so getting back to
[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:43.840]  debon stack of black pill dot com you get into what you saw from the film i don't know if you saw
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:49.280]  what i saw the 5g or obviously women are in charge of everything and again i guess women
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:53.200]  god i wish my daughters had three of them were in charge of stuff hope to be in charge of cleaning
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:58.320]  the house up instead of me doing it how i see in my life is me working for women and i love women
[02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:02.320]  that's the whole point it's women are great it's just this how the other were against each other
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:07.200]  is ridiculous debon why do you think they banned your video and i've seen it it's powerful folks
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:11.920]  should see it's on m4s.com exclusively everybody should share it really stick their finger in the
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:18.480]  eye of the old sundar pachai over there and his criminal operation known as google well i think
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:23.440]  the biggest thing is it's because i i call them you know i called out the propaganda they the
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:28.960]  official reason they gave me when they banned it was that it was deceptive spam like when people
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:34.720]  you know say like a fake title and and then you know it's just some garbage video so that they
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:39.840]  can run an ad on it that's what they were claiming it was you know not not that i have 150,000
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:45.520]  subscribers and it had over 10,000 thumbs up i think maybe 200 thumbs down you know like that
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:50.720]  it was obviously not spam there was a lot of original content they just had to have an excuse
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:56.320]  because i wasn't racist in in my talking about the race issues i made it very clear you're not
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:37:04.480]  supposed to talk about the precious propaganda piece right no and and you're not supposed to
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:08.720]  talk about these issues at all but i made it clear it's like look it's it's not that you can't be a
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:12.080]  black guy and be a good guy in a movie it's not that you can't be a white guy no every movie
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:16.400]  the women and the black guys are the hero and black guys are bad and then there's memos where
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:21.600]  hollywood says that so don't apologize we get it and we're trying to stop half the blacks being
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:25.760]  aborted okay don't kill the black babies i'm not against black people but don't be a weapon against
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:30.800]  me it's real simple i love black people that are away i hate white people and black people that aren't
[02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:36.480]  so so just get into it then well in this film it's it was just so it was just so heavy-handed you
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:41.360]  know and and it was surprising to me because i saw it right away i watched this and i was just like
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:48.480]  wow like there this is just a really really anti-white and and i had people that i thought were
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:54.080]  that i considered maybe you know uh understanding of this kind of propaganda recommending the movie
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:58.800]  to me and i was like this this need i have to address this because a lot of people are watching
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:04.000]  this and i don't know why because it seems so obvious to me but for whatever reason they're not
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.400]  picking up on it and once i pointed it out and i had a lot of people comment on the video like hey
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:14.800]  look i watched this movie you know my wife told me to watch this movie and i i sort of had a bad
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:20.480]  feeling about it but i couldn't really quite put my finger on it and you've really described you've
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:26.640]  really articulated what was wrong with that film that i that i couldn't put my finger on and i think
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:32.080]  that another message that i didn't really quite cover in the video uh you know they they walk around
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:37.280]  blindfolded they're not allowed to look i mean i think that's another aspect of this too is that
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:43.600]  they want you to be afraid of of looking for yourself for seeing yourself for yourself oh no
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:49.280]  that's the archive is that if you cover yourself from reality and denial you'll be protected right
[02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:54.320]  and and they you know they don't you know don't look let us tell you where to go let us tell you
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:58.880]  what to do because if we don't do exactly what i tell you i'm going to hurt you suddenly abuse
[02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:04.160]  of children is good as long as sandra bullock's doing right well and that's another thing too is
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:08.880]  there is some imagery and you know you could make an argument that given the situation it's
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:13.120]  sort of warranted she's trying to keep him alive but i mean the movie opens with her being very
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:18.800]  uh verbally abusive to two young children and it's all that's a little you know it took me a
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:22.800]  little off guard at first you know and again like i said in context you can make an excuse for it
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:27.280]  hillary's allowed to say blacks aren't human hillary's allowed to say blacks all look the same
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:33.520]  sandra bullock she's a god she can tell kids i'm gonna break your arm as long as you're not a white
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:39.200]  male she no no she has the authority she's gonna kill her baby in her womb of course she can
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:43.680]  knock her kids teeth out she can have her kid dance at the gay bar and let you know let them gang
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:48.640]  rape the kid as long as it's liberal well and that was another weird thing that you know now you
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:53.760]  mentioned that is in the very beginning of the movie she's she's going in and getting a sonogram
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:58.080]  because she's pregnant or her character is pregnant and they start talking about like it totally has
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:40:02.080]  nothing like they don't need this in the story it's just weird to have this in the story and
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:07.200]  she and her character's sister start talking about how hey let's get a bottle of wine after this
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:10.960]  doctor's appointment say hey don't do it hurts the baby and she goes so what it doesn't exist yet
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:15.440]  it's like an abortion right well and the doctor that's in the room with her just is like yeah
[02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:20.320]  yeah like they she acts like it's just some funny thing not a big deal and then later on in the film
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:25.040]  you know when she's still very pregnant she's drinking a glass of whiskey and it's it's weird
[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:29.280]  because hollywood doesn't do things like this unless there's a reason for it's all totally
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:35.040]  plainly you get a mindset of their sick freak brains so much so much thought goes into every
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:40.240]  line of a script and and and even after you know after they've shot the film when you're in the
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:44.400]  editing room they have another chance to think to themselves like huh is this maybe promoting
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:49.040]  drinking while you're pregnant and clearly that had to have crossed someone's mind and they kept it
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:55.840]  in there so i have no that's yeah it's a total abortion it's abortion right right so we've been
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:41:00.720]  expanding on this every hero's a black guy white men are the devil so i mean we get it's the same
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:04.880]  thing over and over again right all right and it's it's in it like i said it's becoming a
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:10.800]  cliche it's in so many different uh uh well we got the gamergate emails five years ago it's like
[02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:15.600]  every hero's a woman every bad guy's a white male we get it so what's the end game then why are they
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:22.160]  doing it well i think in this film the end game was you know they they end up killing all the white
[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:28.000]  people so i mean they they're promoting violence they're they're basically telling you to be afraid
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:32.160]  of the white people in fact the one character who's clearly a trump supporter they make they make
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:38.080]  that very clear in the film the one character that that is helpful you could say is still
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:43.280]  demeaned constantly and they keep telling the the other characters don't listen to him everything he
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:49.920]  does is because he's xenophobic and because he's racist so anything he says even if it makes sense
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:54.640]  and even if he has a track record for like being right about what's about to happen just throw it
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:42:00.160]  all away because all of his all of his thoughts are all based on big and that's key because i watched
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:06.480]  it i picked that up too okay he's smart he knows how to do things but let's get rid of him because
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:11.040]  he's a white dude he's exactly those so they're like subconsciously telling the brain okay
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:17.600]  i sage populations had to learn to build things and save things and do long-term planning
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:23.440]  the opposite of a short attention span they'd have long attention spans or they die so that's why
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:28.880]  i sage populations from japanese to people in finland have the highest IQs they're saying they've
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:35.680]  got like high IQs but let's kill them immediately which is the message we'll be back with debots

[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:04.320]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:10.720]  water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:16.560]  particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:23.280]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there
[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:29.440]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:35.280]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:42.480]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:48.400]  the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:54.000]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:01.600]  we need to build back and we visit the foundations of our freedom

[02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:11.040]  the things that we're willing to fight for the first amendment the bill of rights the rest of
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:16.720]  the bill of rights are prohibitions they're prohibitions against powerful organizations
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:21.760]  and individuals taking those god-given rights from us as individuals you better understand
[02:45:21.760 --> 02:45:29.040]  that because they're taking them right now we have seen what they want to do they called it
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:35.360]  unagent 21 now they call it the un 2030 agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:40.720]  want people out of the suburbs they want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where

[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:45.600]  and go back to devon stack on this tuesday global transmission
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:52.800]  devon finish up with your review of the uh bird box and what you think made them so upset and
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:57.840]  get into your general views about the world and uh i know you're not optimistic you're blackpilled
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:04.240]  and and you know i get that a nice term you guys have for destruction of society but you
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:07.760]  haven't run off to some armored redoubt in the middle of nowhere yet you still think we can fix
[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:15.600]  things um well i'm on the fence about whether or not we can fix things to be honest uh and the
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:21.360]  longer reason i say that is i feel like a lot of problems have been for decades uh been kicked down
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:26.720]  the can or the can rather has been kicked down the road well let's say the general public like
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:31.600]  someone on a mars mission with no gravity gets weak the general public's very weak and stupid
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:38.640]  and so right it's almost they can't be helped well that yeah and and so it's it's really i mean
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:45.520]  we've come out of we've come out of bad situations as americans before and just as as as humans and
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:51.520]  so i'm not saying that we're doomed or anything like that uh but i do think that the corruption
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:57.760]  in the uh the the government's state and and federal are it's it's so much more than i think
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:04.480]  most people even realize and it's been going on for so long that i don't know that it's something
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:11.200]  that can be uh dealt with uh at at the ballot box i mean we've seen you know the the election fraud
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:16.560]  and stuff like that so obviously i you know i'm not sitting here in a in a bunker with a pilot
[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:23.280]  bullets next to me or anything like that but uh at the same time i'm definitely i like to be prepared
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:28.160]  if something were to happen down the road and i recommend other people are on top of time bomb
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:31.680]  and you see that all over the world and we're supposed to take a collapsing civilization and
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:36.240]  bring it here to collapse thing because the globalist can consolidate control that way so so so
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:42.720]  finishing up then with uh your review a bird box a bird cage liner from senator bullock well and and
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:49.040]  why they banned it i think well i think the most revealing thing about the movie is uh at the very
[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:54.000]  end of the or rather uh at the end of the video of my review but something that happens throughout
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:58.880]  the film is they kind of hint at they never explicitly say it but that's always the best
[02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:04.480]  way to do propaganda is to have the the audience come to the conclusion that way they think it's
[02:51:04.480 --> 02:51:09.600]  their idea not the idea that you know they planted in your head and little by little they kind of
[02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:14.960]  give you the impression that everyone that sees this mysterious evil thing that you have to be
[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:20.320]  blindfolded from to avoid you know turning into a monster there's two kinds of people there's the
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:26.400]  people that see that and then they uh they immediately get really depressed and kill themselves for
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:31.920]  no apparent reason and that's the vast majority of the people that you see when this is happening
[02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:37.200]  but then there's like a small percentage of people when they see whatever this mysterious force or
[02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:42.160]  demon thing is they actually love what they're seeing and they embrace it and they're kind of
[02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:47.280]  like mad with with bloodlust and they start you know killing people and that that becomes
[02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:53.840]  like the evil people that are roaming around and that are dangerous and the thing that I noticed was
[02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:59.760]  without exception literally without exception the only people that were that evil that had
[02:51:59.760 --> 02:52:04.880]  the evil inside them that they they decide to start attacking you know the people that were
[02:52:04.880 --> 02:52:10.240]  trying to escape were white people that those are the only people that had that kind of evil
[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:15.520]  inside of them and you know given the demographics of the rest of the film that's quite quite a
[02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:22.000]  weird coincidence that you'd have only white people play that part and it wasn't just white people it
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:27.760]  was usually you know your typical uh you know the redneck or the kind of white people that that
[02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:32.320]  hollywood likes to uh put forward as like oh you don't want to be like this you don't want to be
[02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:36.640]  like this redneck guy you don't want to be like this ignorant biker guy you don't want to be like
[02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:40.800]  this uh you know skinhead guy like there was a guy there wasn't a skinhead but he had like a
[02:52:40.800 --> 02:52:46.320]  flight jacket on like the skinheads in the 90s used to have and so every single white guy in the
[02:52:46.320 --> 02:52:53.360]  movie that was one of these evil uh monsters having looked at the uh the demon i don't understand
[02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:58.880]  i've seen the film i agree with you so that's just one layer of it what is hollywood's problem
[02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:04.720]  what is their in game is it a existential envy of the west or why is it even though the global
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:08.080]  is run america in the world why do they want to destroy the strength of the west
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:15.680]  you know i don't know i i i go back and forth on that a lot i think that at the end of the day
[02:53:15.680 --> 02:53:23.680]  that they want us to be cattle they just want us to be so confused and so disjointed and so unable
[02:53:23.680 --> 02:53:29.920]  to overthrow uh anything that might uh you know be reprehensible to to past generations you know
[02:53:29.920 --> 02:53:36.080]  like i was saying with the uh uh the the the promotion of the pedophilia stuff they want
[02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:41.360]  you to be so accepting of whatever horrible thing that they want to do that we're just drones i mean
[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:45.360]  a lot of people are already like that but they need to push it to the point where there's no
[02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:50.880]  question no that's it they want anything strong or anything independent to take over it's just
[02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:56.640]  it's periods like we're taking over but this is his futile give us your children right no they
[02:53:56.640 --> 02:54:02.640]  just want us to to step in line and to be and accept whatever horrible thing happens and especially
[02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:07.280]  right now i think there's you know there's a lot of rumors and there's a good chance i think that we
[02:54:07.280 --> 02:54:14.160]  find out in the not so distant future uh some horrible things about uh powerful people that might
[02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:18.480]  involve children and i think that might be another reason why they're trying to normalize as quickly
[02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:23.600]  as possible because if we find out you know the same thing with the deep fakes they keep talking
[02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:29.120]  about oh watch out desperately on every channel trying to not just say rape kids is good give them
[02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:34.000]  drugs is good it's just everywhere right right and then they're trying to it's almost like they're
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:38.960]  trying to prepare you for like something that's about to come out and uh i'm not one of these people
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:44.160]  that that i don't believe they'll say you're a racist if you don't kidnap and strangle children
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:52.560]  well and and they're they're uh they they just basically want people to to accept whatever evil
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:57.440]  comes out and and anything that goes against the narrative they have to shut it down i mean uh mark
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:03.600]  dice got got uh in trouble on youtube as well today because he pointed out that that uh that
[02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:07.840]  shooter that killed the the seven-year-old that they were saying it's a white guy in a red truck
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:12.880]  or whatever uh and it turned out to be a black guy and that's all he said like that's he wasn't
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:16.880]  saying like i knew it you know it was just like it was just happened to be a black guy
[02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:21.040]  and he made a video about it make it well incredible in a black neighborhood it was a black guy only
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:28.080]  95 percent of uh black murder is black i mean my god and so they they censored his video because
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:31.840]  it went against the narrative so i think you're gonna see this more and more and more you were
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:37.200]  the first obviously there to really feel the the pain on that and and i knew at the time i made a
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:40.640]  video about it at the time you know saying like hey everyone needs to get behind this because
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:45.760]  we're next and and i think now it's that's happening we're next you know some people said oh jones was
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:50.080]  weak so they don't that was big so they said target him set the precedent when people don't
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:54.960]  stand up for him then every other domino falls and now they're like we're not going to carry the
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:56:01.840]  president's address tonight at a central well we're going to be covering it at info wars.com

[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:37.280]  will go uh to be perfectly honest i kind of think it's going to go like uh um uh tyler dirton was
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:41.280]  saying like i don't think he's going to announce like hey we need to i think he needs to i think
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:44.800]  he needs to put the hammer down and just say you know screw you guys we're making the wall
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:49.920]  even if i have to get the army corps of engineers out there with uh you know will barrels and and

[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:00.800]  why we don't do that but um i also think there's people up in the tops of federal government that
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:06.960]  are worried that the second he does something even slightly authoritarian uh that it'll spark this
[02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:12.480]  you know that'll be the thing that starts the the the big one i don't want to go crazy start

[03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:22.720]  january 2019 edition ton of news stories to cover obviously trump's gonna give his big speech on
[03:00:22.720 --> 03:00:27.920]  the wall tonight they're now saying that he won't announce emergency measures to have the butt wall
[03:00:27.920 --> 03:00:32.560]  built potentially by the pentagon there was a lot of speculation over that now some people saying
[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:37.520]  maybe that's flipped back and maybe he will venture into that territory so we can get into that later
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:43.440]  but there's a lot of news in the uk right now specifically targeting and that is the keyword
[03:00:43.440 --> 03:00:49.840]  targeting the yellow vest movement which have you as you've seen in france and italy now and also
[03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:55.600]  the netherlands has become very prominent and very successful so now we have a similar group of
[03:00:55.600 --> 03:01:03.200]  people donning the yellow vest the new symbol of anti-globalist resistance basically in the uk now
[03:01:03.200 --> 03:01:10.240]  are those people experts are optics are they the best representation for the quote conservative
[03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:15.200]  or right-wing movement in the uk obviously not they're going to make a lot of mistakes but here
[03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:21.600]  in the uk over the last couple of days we have had a monumental freak out and one of the headlines
[03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:25.920]  here and we're going to get to the Nigel forage clip in the next segment forage warns against
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:33.120]  state crackdown on people heckling pro-eu figures now basically what happened in the uk anna subri
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:38.960]  who is a conservative mp conservative in name only was basically walking away from parliament
[03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:45.840]  walking towards parliament and she was heckled god forbid somebody said a mean word to a politician
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:53.760]  now was it rude was it a little bit mean yes but the absolute monumental meltdown and freak out in
[03:01:53.760 --> 03:01:59.040]  the uk media that we've seen about this over the past couple of days is not only dangerous to free
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:04.880]  speech because now they're talking about police action and new laws being passed to prevent
[03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:10.640]  ordinary members of the public with very real grievances from heckling which basically means
[03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:16.560]  criticizing in public politicians that is now what they're talking about because god forbid
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:23.360]  this remainder this remona mp anna subri got called a fascist this is the same woman who was
[03:02:23.360 --> 03:02:31.520]  repeatedly called leave voters which is you know 17.1 million people in the united kingdom fascists
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:36.720]  and naxies over the course of the past year so it's okay when she does it but when somebody does
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:42.800]  it to her when she's walking down the street in public then it's this big hate crime then we need
[03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:49.200]  laws to ban open air criticism of politicians and Nigel Farage has come out and rightly said
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:55.040]  that this is a slippery slope to a disaster for free speech as if the state of free speech
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:59.760]  in the united kingdom wasn't bad enough but it goes further than that and i'm going to get into this
[03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:05.680]  in fact nick monroe has tweeted about this today on twitter he's put together a good
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:11.280]  thread on this they're now basically using this contrived outrage that god forbid somebody
[03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:18.080]  heckled a politician to demonize the yellow vest movement in the united kingdom and just today
[03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:25.920]  we've seen paypal again de-platforming one of the leaders of the yellow vest movement in the uk
[03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:31.600]  because he was demonized he was publicly shamed by the establishment media over the course of the
[03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:38.080]  past 48 hours now raheem kasam tweeted this three hours ago which is on my timeline on twitter
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:43.600]  in the past few hours the yellow vest to uk have had their social media accounts banned
[03:03:43.600 --> 03:03:50.240]  had their paypal account removed had journalists show up at their elderly parents house so now
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:56.400]  now you have left wingers not only campaigning to have them de-platformed to financially sabotage
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:02.480]  them as we've seen with info wars and alex jones but to dox them and have members of the media
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:07.840]  show up at their parents house who aren't even involved in any of these protest actions had
[03:04:07.840 --> 03:04:14.400]  lies spread about them on national tv and in the media so yeah obviously the optics of screaming
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:19.120]  fascist at somebody's probably not the best way to get your political message across and we can argue
[03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:25.760]  about that all day long but then to create the pretext that heckling or criticizing politicians
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:31.360]  with legitimate grievances in public should be some kind of hate crime which laws are required
[03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:38.160]  to stop it and to intimidate people against speaking truth to power that is a far worse situation
[03:04:38.720 --> 03:04:44.000]  than a politician who's basically betrayed democracy at this point anasubri from being
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:48.880]  heckled from somebody being mean to her in public that is a far worse decision and is a far worse
[03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:52.480]  pretext we're going to get more into after the break on the alex jones show live info wars dot

[03:06:09.360 --> 03:06:17.920]  the live is the fourth hour of the alex jones show headline up on sky news which is an incredibly
[03:06:17.920 --> 03:06:24.880]  biased media outlet here in the uk worse than the bbc in my view tori mp anisubri felt in physical
[03:06:24.880 --> 03:06:30.960]  danger when confronted by protesters outside parliament god forbid she would be confronted
[03:06:30.960 --> 03:06:38.800]  for the past two plus years we've had these idiot euro file protesters heckling people
[03:06:38.800 --> 03:06:44.720]  heckling politicians like jacob rees mogg like nigel forage we've had instances where they
[03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:50.880]  intimidate and heckle their family try to attack their families physically desecrate their houses
[03:06:50.880 --> 03:06:57.920]  their property smash into their vehicles and the media said nothing for two and a half years as
[03:06:57.920 --> 03:07:03.920]  soon as it happens to one of their cherished establishment figures like anisubri all hell
[03:07:03.920 --> 03:07:09.840]  breaks loose everybody loses their mind again headlight tori mp anisubri felt in physical
[03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:15.360]  danger when confronted by protesters outside parliament conservative mp anisubri has told
[03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:20.320]  sky news she felt in physical danger when faced by protesters in west minster the former tori
[03:07:20.320 --> 03:07:25.520]  minister was taunted with shouts of nazi during live tv interviews on monday before being confronted
[03:07:25.520 --> 03:07:31.440]  by a group of men as she made her way back into parliament god forbid anyone on the right would
[03:07:31.440 --> 03:07:38.800]  dare confront a politician how long now have we seen far left people confronting politicians
[03:07:38.800 --> 03:07:44.880]  this was a this was a gonzo journalist tactic pioneered decades ago by the likes of michael
[03:07:44.880 --> 03:07:50.400]  moor by the likes of our own alex jones okay this is not some dangerous dark new phenomenon
[03:07:51.040 --> 03:07:57.440]  it's been happening and it's been initiated by the left for decades and decades as soon as quote
[03:07:57.440 --> 03:08:02.560]  right wingers start doing it there's a complete meltdown and of course the double standard is
[03:08:03.440 --> 03:08:10.320]  as i said before the break anisubri has repeatedly demonized the working class in britain repeatedly
[03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:18.800]  demonized leave voters as nazis and fascists herself being given a public platform on sky news
[03:08:18.800 --> 03:08:25.120]  on bbc news but as soon as she gets a mean word in the opposite direction oh now we need to pass
[03:08:25.120 --> 03:08:32.720]  new laws absolute bs nonsense and yeah it was rude it was mean we can all agree on that you
[03:08:32.720 --> 03:08:38.480]  don't you can't pass laws to prevent people from airing their grievances in front of parliament
[03:08:39.280 --> 03:08:43.920]  anyone can go into parliament and try to wear their grievances so long as they don't cause a
[03:08:43.920 --> 03:08:49.040]  disturbance so long as they're not physically preventing her movements if they're physically
[03:08:49.040 --> 03:08:54.640]  preventing her from going about her business fair enough and yeah you can argue that it's rude and
[03:08:54.640 --> 03:09:00.400]  that it is harassment to some extent and you can argue that better optics would be more successful
[03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:05.760]  in getting your message across you can't pass laws to ban open air free speech criticism of
[03:09:05.760 --> 03:09:11.920]  politicians that is an infinitely more dangerous step to take let's go to the clip of nigel farage
[03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:18.880]  talking about this confrontation of anisubri and another one involving owin jones who is a left
[03:09:18.880 --> 03:09:26.640]  wing activist his nigel farage i mean i've suffered this i mean every day literally every day year
[03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:33.840]  after year you know we even reached the position where my family was attacked the car was smashed
[03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:40.880]  up and vandalized written off and the police didn't pursue a single prosecution now because
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:45.760]  somebody in west minster has been abused we're told the police are investigating whether there's
[03:09:45.760 --> 03:09:50.960]  been a crime so let's get a sense of perspectives on this there is nothing new about this there is
[03:09:50.960 --> 03:09:57.120]  horrible behavior taken place by both sides of an argument but we mustn't overreact to this
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:05.120]  mps public figures should be free to go out and express their opinion without the threat of violence
[03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:11.360]  but if we try now to put in place laws or if the police start prosecuting people for throwing
[03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:17.520]  terms of abuse that reaction i think would be over the top critics will say uh nigel that politicians
[03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:22.880]  like yourself over the years have occasionally used inflammatory language not that it justifies
[03:10:22.880 --> 03:10:28.480]  what's come back but the you you yourselves have been responsible for whipping up a lot of the more
[03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:33.520]  aggressive behavior what what do you say to yeah i remember once um i remember once peers going to
[03:10:33.520 --> 03:10:39.360]  ed umbra and being attacked by a mob of 80 people in the street uh language and abuse and intimidation
[03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:45.200]  far worse than we saw yesterday um and i was told by alex amond the first minister of scotland
[03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:50.560]  that i basically deserved it because i come to scotland where i wasn't popular so there is a real
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:56.240]  double standard here that those of us that have taken on the establishment have to endure the abuse
[03:10:56.240 --> 03:11:01.520]  those within the establishment get a taste of it and suddenly they want the law changed let's make
[03:11:01.520 --> 03:11:07.760]  sure that everybody is able to speak freely whether they support brexit whether they're against brexit
[03:11:07.760 --> 03:11:15.040]  you know let's stop violence let's stop intimidation but what you can't do is to make it a criminal
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:21.520]  offence to throw abuse at elected politicians that was niger forage talking about the confrontation
[03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:27.200]  of anasubri by right-wing yellow vest political activists in the united kingdom and there's a
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:31.360]  headline up on bright bar which is a really good write-up about this whole issue if you really want
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:37.760]  to get to the nub of it by james deliphole headline np anasubri's nazi scare is a pure
[03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:42.240]  remainder propaganda and this is how they're exploiting this in the aftermath he writes
[03:11:42.240 --> 03:11:46.880]  today's excuse as to why brexit mustn't happen because again it hasn't happened yet they're
[03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:51.360]  still trying to reverse it trying to reverse a democratic mandate that was given to them by the
[03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:57.920]  british people betrayal basically today's excuse as to why brexit mustn't happen is that a gaggle of
[03:11:57.920 --> 03:12:01.760]  protesters in yellow vest have been caught on film outside the houses of parliament calling
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:08.560]  remainder np anasubri a nazi as it's perfectly clear from the video footage this is a lot of fuss
[03:12:08.560 --> 03:12:14.720]  about nothing the people cheering at subri are quite clearly a small group of saddos that's his
[03:12:14.720 --> 03:12:19.760]  opinion not mine obviously some of the some of this group are quite idiotic in the way they go
[03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:25.040]  about things but again at least they're out there on the streets doing something right he continues
[03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:29.600]  none of whom looks as if they could punch though out of a paper bag they are more embarrassing than
[03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:35.040]  scary it's clear from the sheer lameness of the insults as much as anything that this barricing
[03:12:35.040 --> 03:12:41.520]  was spontaneous rather than planned also contrary to subri's claims there appears to be little
[03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:47.200]  evidence that the protesters tried to stop her getting into parliament they walked alongside her
[03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:50.960]  because again there was there were all these claims that they physically blocked her from going
[03:12:50.960 --> 03:12:56.400]  about her business it isn't born out on the video also there's video circulating which are also
[03:12:56.400 --> 03:13:02.720]  tweeted where it looks like one of these right-wing activists in this yellow vest group is a potential
[03:13:02.720 --> 03:13:07.920]  provocateur trying to stir some of this up now that's not cut and dried but there's a lot of
[03:13:07.920 --> 03:13:12.240]  speculation and there's a video to that effect which I also tweeted out earlier or retweeted
[03:13:13.680 --> 03:13:19.280]  but again deling paul continues in this article so why has the story been given so much prominence
[03:13:19.280 --> 03:13:24.560]  especially across sky in the BBC and also on social media by a number of MPs and left-leaning
[03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:29.200]  journalists don't be fooled by the process stations of non-partisanship this is the
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:34.320]  remain propaganda machine in action seizing whatever opportunity it can to discredit the
[03:13:34.320 --> 03:13:40.960]  Brexit cause by making out that people who support it are mindless thugs and that is exactly how
[03:13:40.960 --> 03:13:46.160]  they've exploited it in the aftermath and they've now done so to an even greater extent
[03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:52.320]  again by de-platforming by literally killing the PayPal accounts of one of the leaders of
[03:13:52.320 --> 03:13:57.280]  this yellow vest movement in the UK again this is a tweet by Nick Monroe which I
[03:13:57.280 --> 03:14:01.360]  retweeted earlier he writes the yellow vest movement in the UK is getting clamped down
[03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:08.160]  by the establishment so their PayPal account again after a left-wing lobbying campaign
[03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:14.720]  the PayPal account of one of the leaders Jamie Goddard James Goddard has been shut down
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:21.920]  now after a campaign by young Labour international officer an individual called Marks Bennett
[03:14:22.560 --> 03:14:28.880]  so again they hyped up these confrontations and said this is another dark parallel of fascism
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:35.680]  how dare they argue politically with high-profile political figures in the centre of London
[03:14:35.680 --> 03:14:40.800]  outside parliament that's unheard of so they pet their PayPal accounts are disappearing
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:44.960]  there was an article in The Independent by Lizzie Deardon who again
[03:14:45.600 --> 03:14:52.080]  abuses her position of power to silence independent political voices she campaigned
[03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:56.320]  lobbied abused her position to get them de-platformed by PayPal and that happened
[03:14:57.360 --> 03:15:02.800]  members of the FBPE hashtag on Twitter which is an anti-Brexit hashtag
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:07.520]  ganged up on all these different members identified them again they're probably going
[03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:11.760]  to get fired from their jobs as well that's a speciality of the left they can't just have
[03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:17.040]  a debate or a disagreement they literally have to ruin people's lives forever because they're so
[03:15:17.040 --> 03:15:22.880]  damn tolerant Roland Rudd the multi-millionaire chairman of the EU and Blair Funded People's
[03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:30.720]  Vote campaign he was also pushing this de-platforming propaganda campaign and again this is all to
[03:15:30.720 --> 03:15:38.640]  delegitimize to destabilize to disrupt to defund to financially sabotage the yellow vest movement
[03:15:38.640 --> 03:15:45.600]  from growing in the UK because they're petrified about how successful it's been in France we'll
[03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:49.200]  get more into this on the other side of the break it is the alex general show live breaking

[03:22:03.760 --> 03:22:10.720]  store dot com now i want to shift gears somewhat we're still talking about the yellow vest but
[03:22:10.720 --> 03:22:16.640]  we're talking about the impact in europe this is a headline out of rt sweep your own door
[03:22:16.640 --> 03:22:22.160]  french minister bashes italian politicians for yellow vest support this is france's minister
[03:22:22.160 --> 03:22:29.040]  for european affairs hitting back italian populist duo matthew salvinian louis gd mayo telling them
[03:22:29.040 --> 03:22:34.000]  to mine their own business after the pair bash french president manuel macron for his unpopularity
[03:22:34.640 --> 03:22:40.880]  now macron and his entire government constantly stick their nose in to italian politics they
[03:22:40.880 --> 03:22:47.360]  constantly criticize demine denounce the activities of salvinian demio who have been
[03:22:48.320 --> 03:22:53.680]  amazingly successful in stopping stopping preventing migrant drowning deaths actually
[03:22:53.680 --> 03:23:01.280]  cutting them in half with their populist policies so macron the entire french government continually
[03:23:01.280 --> 03:23:05.520]  sticking their nose in when it comes to italian politics as soon again as soon as it goes the other
[03:23:05.520 --> 03:23:10.800]  way then they get techy interior minister and northern league leader salvini through his
[03:23:10.800 --> 03:23:15.120]  support behind france's anti-government yellow vest demonstrators on monday saying he supports
[03:23:15.120 --> 03:23:20.320]  honest citizens who protest against a governing president who is against his people and what
[03:23:20.320 --> 03:23:25.520]  are macron's approval ratings now i mean they dipped below what was it 26 percent
[03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:30.960]  he had and that was about a month ago so it's probably even lower now so they're merely pointing
[03:23:30.960 --> 03:23:36.320]  out that this is an organic movement their demands are legitimate some of them have been met but now
[03:23:36.320 --> 03:23:43.520]  again the propaganda war is turning against the yellow vest in france of course we had the infamous
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:47.600]  and quite hilarious french rocky video which we probably played on this show which you've probably
[03:23:47.600 --> 03:23:53.680]  seen he's now being harassed and targeted again you can debate whether it was right for him to do
[03:23:53.680 --> 03:23:59.200]  it he claims he was defending his wife who was tear gas the media came out and called him a coward
[03:23:59.200 --> 03:24:04.720]  he was a champion boxer if you're brawling with an armed police officer with a baton and a shield
[03:24:04.720 --> 03:24:09.440]  and a helmet then you're not really a coward are you you could call him a thug or a bully you can't
[03:24:09.440 --> 03:24:16.240]  really call him a coward so now he's getting demonized and doxxed in france and we have this
[03:24:16.240 --> 03:24:22.480]  headline out of voice of europe on the same subject democracy france announces new measures to curb
[03:24:22.480 --> 03:24:27.280]  yellow vest protests following sustained anti-government protests the french government has announced
[03:24:27.280 --> 03:24:34.000]  plans to strictly control what it calls unsanctioned protests so you have to get permission from the
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:39.200]  government to protest the government okay that's not a free country they're now saying these are
[03:24:39.200 --> 03:24:44.000]  unsanctioned they're going out in the middle of the night or at night at least and arresting the
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:48.720]  leaders of this movement again it's a leaderless movement but you have people who are more prominent
[03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:54.960]  than others people who make public statements like truck driver eric drew a who as we reported
[03:24:54.960 --> 03:25:01.600]  last week was arrested again for organizing an unsanctioned protest so they think by threats
[03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:08.160]  by intimidation by arresting key leaders of these movements of this movement in france in particular
[03:25:08.160 --> 03:25:13.840]  that they can silence and intimidate everyone else against getting out on the streets this article
[03:25:13.840 --> 03:25:19.200]  continues some politicians want to go further the leader of the republican party in france
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:24.000]  tweeted that the move was not enough because it would not take immediate effect he said his party
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:29.280]  had previously proposed a state of emergency adding quote why not listen to us at the risk of seeing
[03:25:29.280 --> 03:25:34.000]  the situation worse on saturday after saturday a state of emergency is basically what they put in
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:40.720]  place when they're expecting imminent massive terror attacks we've had several state of emergencies
[03:25:40.720 --> 03:25:45.680]  in france over the past few years after the charlie hebdo attack and after the paris massacre
[03:25:45.680 --> 03:25:50.640]  charlie hebdo attack being uh four years ago yesterday by the way that was the anniversary
[03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:56.560]  of that so they're now talking about combating organic and albeit violent yes there's been
[03:25:56.560 --> 03:26:02.160]  violence but they're talking about literally using measures supposed to prevent massive terror attacks
[03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:09.200]  to be used to stop protests by french citizens against their own government again that is tyrannical
[03:26:09.200 --> 03:26:14.880]  and you've seen the videos okay the violence is by no means going one way we've seen people
[03:26:14.880 --> 03:26:20.240]  literally had had their eyeballs shot out by these police officers in france we've seen
[03:26:21.200 --> 03:26:26.080]  and the stun grenades literally blow people's hands off you've probably seen that horrific
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:31.040]  video as well we've had numerous people severely injured we've had deaths as well as part of these
[03:26:31.040 --> 03:26:37.520]  protests and the violence is certainly not all one way obviously we decry all forms of violence
[03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:43.600]  but to pin the blame entirely on these yellow vest protesters is completely inaccurate because in
[03:26:43.600 --> 03:26:50.320]  many cases the police are deliberately kettling and antagonizing these individuals and that's
[03:26:50.320 --> 03:26:55.360]  when some of the violence emerges and also just basically beating them down in the street we've
[03:26:55.360 --> 03:27:01.760]  had video after video after video showing that so now they're trying to paint the yellow vest
[03:27:01.760 --> 03:27:08.720]  protesters in the same context as basically domestic terrorists trying to use domestic
[03:27:08.720 --> 03:27:14.000]  terrorism powers against them to disrupt their organization and to disrupt and to basically
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:20.720]  criminalize protest in france here's another headline occupy paris man rallies travelers
[03:27:20.720 --> 03:27:26.400]  behind police beating boxer in video threats macron so a man claiming to be a gypsy issued a
[03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:31.120]  video threat french president immanuel macron urging fellow travelers to occupy paris in support
[03:27:31.120 --> 03:27:37.440]  of the honorable police brawling boxer christopher dettinger who as you may have seen when somebody
[03:27:37.440 --> 03:27:43.760]  put the rocky theme to this video it was quite hilarious again we don't condone any form of
[03:27:43.760 --> 03:27:50.240]  violence and we don't want to see these scenes on the streets of paris or anywhere else but again
[03:27:51.200 --> 03:27:56.480]  if you're going up against four armed police officers who have helmets and shields and batons
[03:27:56.480 --> 03:28:02.000]  yes it's stupid yes we don't want to see that but you can't really call him a coward can you
[03:28:02.640 --> 03:28:08.080]  you can't really call him a coward and in fact a lot of people in france have turned him into
[03:28:08.080 --> 03:28:13.200]  something of an icon over the past few days again not that we condone any sort of violence
[03:28:13.840 --> 03:28:19.920]  but it's not all going one way so again in the uk now we see this big propaganda move
[03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:27.440]  to silence intimidate bully deplatform financially sabotage this tiny group of protesters in the
[03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:33.520]  uk compared to france it's absolutely tiny again to try derail any kind of yellow vest
[03:28:33.520 --> 03:28:38.960]  movement starting in the uk whatsoever because the establishment is absolutely terrified of it

[03:33:21.040 --> 03:33:30.560]  watson we are live on the fourth hour of alex jones show this january 8 2019 edition now while the
[03:33:30.560 --> 03:33:36.400]  establishment media in europe and specifically over the past 48 hours in the uk demonizes the
[03:33:36.400 --> 03:33:43.600]  political right as being extremist as being violent as being unhinged in germany we had
[03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:50.480]  a literal assassination attempt by left-wing terrorists trying to kill trying to pommel
[03:33:50.480 --> 03:33:56.880]  trying to bash the brains in other quote right-wing politician headline up on info wars.com
[03:33:56.880 --> 03:34:03.920]  germany left-wing terrorists attempt to assassinate right-wing afd chairman left-wing terrorist attempted
[03:34:03.920 --> 03:34:08.080]  to kill the breman chairman of the right-wing alternative for germany party in a vicious
[03:34:08.080 --> 03:34:14.240]  attack that left the politician fighting for his life now i don't know if they actually want to show
[03:34:14.240 --> 03:34:19.760]  the full extent of his injuries there's a blurred version on top i mean it's up to the studio if
[03:34:19.760 --> 03:34:22.720]  they actually want to scroll down and show the full extent of it i'll leave that up to them
[03:34:23.440 --> 03:34:29.120]  but basically he had his head caved in he's got a massive gaping wound in the middle of his forehead
[03:34:29.120 --> 03:34:35.200]  he almost died the only reason he survived is because a construction worker intervened
[03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:40.960]  when these three unknown assailants were wielding wooden sticks bashing him in the head this
[03:34:40.960 --> 03:34:47.920]  attack this attack occurred near breman's gutter plats on monday night again this was a right-wing
[03:34:47.920 --> 03:34:54.160]  afd politician the chairman of that region the afd came out in a statement afterwards and i believe
[03:34:54.160 --> 03:35:00.480]  the police also made a similar statement that this was a politically motivated attempted
[03:35:00.480 --> 03:35:08.960]  assassination they added that this individual his name is frank magnets was quote beaten half
[03:35:08.960 --> 03:35:12.960]  dead and you can see that for yourself in the disturbing image which is in this article it's
[03:35:12.960 --> 03:35:19.440]  embedded tweet they said today is a black day for democracy in germany the afd leader alice
[03:35:20.160 --> 03:35:25.200]  weedle released a video in which he blamed the attack on incitement against the afd and the
[03:35:25.200 --> 03:35:30.240]  behavior by the media against a democratically elected party so again they've had the same
[03:35:30.240 --> 03:35:36.640]  narrative in germany of the past two years that it's okay to physically assault to beat people
[03:35:36.640 --> 03:35:42.560]  to attack them violently if they're nazis which of course in the modern political lexicon with
[03:35:42.560 --> 03:35:49.040]  the left having moved so far to the left extremist fringe means basically anyone they disagree with
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:56.480]  so again they've ramped up this rhetoric that anyone who supports as afd is less than human
[03:35:56.480 --> 03:36:03.200]  is a nazi is literally trying to reintroduce the third rike into germany and that has created
[03:36:03.200 --> 03:36:09.040]  that extremist ground this idea that you can just attack people because you disagree with them and
[03:36:09.040 --> 03:36:14.560]  literally they these people believe that they're saving the future of germany by pommeling innocent
[03:36:14.560 --> 03:36:21.680]  people in the head with wooden sticks now for people who don't know antifa and it seems almost
[03:36:21.680 --> 03:36:27.040]  certain that these three individuals were members of antifa people don't know that in germany antifa
[03:36:27.040 --> 03:36:34.160]  is way bigger than it is in the united states of america or any western country it's way more organized
[03:36:34.160 --> 03:36:41.680]  it's way more violent and i mean we were involved in confrontations with antifa back in 2016 when
[03:36:41.680 --> 03:36:47.680]  we were covering bilderberg in dresden these people are everywhere in these major cities in germany
[03:36:47.680 --> 03:36:55.200]  and they're not the typical scrawny soyboy image that we have of antifa in america i mean you've
[03:36:55.200 --> 03:36:59.920]  seen them in their confrontations in their fights don't really take care of themselves that well
[03:36:59.920 --> 03:37:05.440]  do they they're not really good brawlers to say the least they're chickennecked skinny soyboy
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:10.880]  pussies basically that's the image of antifa because it's largely true in virtually every
[03:37:10.880 --> 03:37:19.120]  country that is not the case in germany these are big big guys big fighters basically thugs
[03:37:19.120 --> 03:37:25.920]  violent thugs and they literally try to assassinate a right wing politician in germany and how did the
[03:37:25.920 --> 03:37:31.920]  green party react bearing in mind the green party which was led i'm not sure if it's still led but
[03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:36.000]  it was as of a couple of years ago by stefanie burg the woman who literally got up in the german
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:41.840]  parliament and said german citizens will be a minority in their own cities within 20 years and
[03:37:41.840 --> 03:37:47.120]  they already are in some cities like frankfurter and that's a good thing she got up in parliament
[03:37:47.120 --> 03:37:53.760]  and literally said the demographic demise of her own population was a good thing not really proven
[03:37:53.760 --> 03:38:00.400]  to be a good thing hasn't in germany with violent crime exploding 90 percent of it attributable to
[03:38:00.400 --> 03:38:06.480]  migrants and that's of course who antifa has aligned with and that's why afd got into parliament
[03:38:06.480 --> 03:38:12.320]  in the first place because of the backlash against that now their politicians are being beaten to a
[03:38:12.320 --> 03:38:20.320]  pulp and how did the green party react well miss vedal called out in her video they basically said
[03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:26.400]  oh the afd are nazis but this is not how we should go about combating them so even in the
[03:38:26.400 --> 03:38:33.520]  response to this vicious attack they still smeared the afd as nazis again emboldening
[03:38:33.520 --> 03:38:40.720]  further violent attacks against them by dehumanizing them this followed by the way and attempted
[03:38:40.720 --> 03:38:46.080]  bombing of the afd's a goblin office last week for which no suspects have been apprehended they
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:51.200]  literally tried to bomb their offices thank god that no one was hurt in that attack but again
[03:38:51.200 --> 03:38:55.600]  this like this shows you the narrative we get this narrative over and over again and yes we do
[03:38:55.600 --> 03:39:01.200]  have right wing extremism we do have violence on the fringes of the right and we need to call
[03:39:01.200 --> 03:39:05.920]  that out when it happens in fact there was an attack in germany last week i believe when
[03:39:06.640 --> 03:39:11.200]  an individual tried to drive a vehicle into a bunch of migrants again thankfully i don't
[03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:15.360]  think anyone died there were some injuries and that is equally as horrific and when it happens
[03:39:15.360 --> 03:39:22.640]  we need to call it out but to try to equate the threat of both islamic terrorism and left wing
[03:39:22.640 --> 03:39:28.000]  terrorism with right wing terrorism is basically a losing game if you want to make it a competition
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:32.400]  all the studies have shown and we feature them in articles from you know independent studies
[03:39:32.400 --> 03:39:37.360]  these aren't coming out of right wing institutions not that any of them really exist well they show
[03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:43.520]  left wing and islamic terror attacks and violent attacks far outweigh those on the right doesn't
[03:39:43.520 --> 03:39:49.520]  mean that we don't need to treat those on the right with equal importance and in fact the situation
[03:39:49.520 --> 03:39:55.280]  in germany has become so toxic that it's actually inspiring some of those far right attacks because
[03:39:55.280 --> 03:40:01.040]  angela merkel basically came out a couple of weeks ago and said screw you we're going to continue
[03:40:01.040 --> 03:40:06.880]  this policy um any any state that doesn't submit to the new old order talking about italy and
[03:40:06.880 --> 03:40:13.440]  hungering some of these populist eastern european countries will be subsumed and basically taken over
[03:40:13.440 --> 03:40:18.480]  that's what she came out and said that has created a fertile ground for that kind of extremism on
[03:40:18.480 --> 03:40:24.400]  the right but now we have literal left wing terrorists pommeling people on the streets
[03:40:24.400 --> 03:40:29.440]  the guy the guy's got a gash down his entire forehead like five inches longer whatever he almost
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:35.280]  died he might still die he's in hospital in intensive care i would imagine an afd member
[03:40:35.280 --> 03:40:41.760]  peter brison came out in a statement today this is on gateway pundit he said this attack is just
[03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:46.960]  the latest escalation in violence against opposition politicians in germany afd politicians and
[03:40:46.960 --> 03:40:51.840]  volunteers live in a constant state of fear in germany and the mainstream media ignore or even
[03:40:51.840 --> 03:40:57.520]  condone these attacks very mind as i talked about earlier we've got the entirety of the u k media
[03:40:57.520 --> 03:41:02.800]  freaking out and having temper tantrums and meltdowns because one person or a group of people
[03:41:02.800 --> 03:41:09.280]  very small group of people called an mp a fascist outside of parliament and that's the end of the
[03:41:09.280 --> 03:41:15.200]  world meanwhile we've literally got left wing terrorists trying to assassinate political leaders
[03:41:15.200 --> 03:41:20.640]  in germany i think they said this was the first attempt at assassination of a politician in germany
[03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:27.680]  since the last century this is the first one since the year 2000 and it's nowhere it's not in
[03:41:27.680 --> 03:41:33.920]  sky news it's not in the bbc for the past 48 hours their top headlines somebody called anisubria
[03:41:33.920 --> 03:41:40.800]  fascist oh my god this happened monday i i haven't even seen it on bbc news i haven't even seen it
[03:41:40.800 --> 03:41:46.320]  on sky news if they do report it obviously it's buried it's not a top story this is a massive
[03:41:46.320 --> 03:41:52.720]  story a political leader in an assassination attempt he's in intensive care in hospital
[03:41:52.720 --> 03:41:58.080]  after being pummeled in the head with wooden sticks by a group of literal domestic left wing
[03:41:58.080 --> 03:42:05.280]  terrorists nobody's talking about it now peter bryston continues with his statement i myself
[03:42:05.280 --> 03:42:09.760]  was attacked by three men at night on the street during the 2017 election campaign and only escaped
[03:42:09.760 --> 03:42:14.720]  unhorned because i happened to have a friend who basically came to his aid afd politicians like
[03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:20.960]  yorg motin uva junger hay goshdall and gudo ryle many many others have been assaulted and there
[03:42:20.960 --> 03:42:27.360]  were never any consequences even secret applause from press and politics because they've had the
[03:42:27.360 --> 03:42:33.760]  same narrative in germany that we had in america over the past two years puncha nazi well who's
[03:42:33.760 --> 03:42:39.280]  nazi everyone who disagrees with me and this is what it leads to literal domestic left wing
[03:42:39.280 --> 03:42:47.120]  terror attacks with a guy bleeding almost to death before thankfully his life was saved absolutely

[03:48:11.120 --> 03:48:19.040]  products at info wars store dot com let's get into some tech news now there's going to be a big
[03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:24.960]  story coming out about youtube which i got a little tip off about yesterday of course i've
[03:48:24.960 --> 03:48:30.640]  talked about this before basically youtube which is the second biggest search engine in the world
[03:48:30.640 --> 03:48:36.880]  changed its algorithm back when alex jones is completely unpersoned and de-platformed
[03:48:37.440 --> 03:48:42.320]  to the point whenever you type in whenever you search for any kind of news event on the youtube
[03:48:42.320 --> 03:48:48.400]  search engine you are met with a wall of mainstream media of course the mainstream media cannot
[03:48:48.400 --> 03:48:54.160]  compete with individual youtubers because the people who work for the mainstream media have no
[03:48:54.160 --> 03:49:01.520]  personality or character or anything of interest to say so they have to rig the system to compete
[03:49:01.520 --> 03:49:07.920]  against independent creators that has them terrified because again financially it's turning
[03:49:07.920 --> 03:49:11.520]  sour for the mainstream media many of them are going out of business because they don't have a
[03:49:11.520 --> 03:49:18.240]  business model to keep them afloat so they just try to relegate de-platform and financially sabotage
[03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:23.440]  their competition instead which is why on youtube if you search for news events you are met with a
[03:49:23.440 --> 03:49:29.120]  wall of mainstream media propaganda there you see youtube begins injecting direct links to cnn at
[03:49:29.120 --> 03:49:35.120]  the top of search results any help they can give the corporate media they're giving them at this
[03:49:35.120 --> 03:49:41.520]  point we also had a headline youtube changed abortion search results after a slate writer
[03:49:41.520 --> 03:49:49.200]  complained so again left-wing journalists abusing their platforms to lobby for the relegation
[03:49:49.200 --> 03:49:55.200]  of content with with which they disagree an absolute abuse of power and they cave in at every
[03:49:55.200 --> 03:49:59.680]  turn this happened a couple of weeks ago i think the article is youtube has apparently changed the
[03:49:59.680 --> 03:50:04.880]  search results on its site for the term abortion after slate writer april glasner contacted the
[03:50:04.880 --> 03:50:10.000]  company last friday to ask why anti-abortion videos saturated the search results for abortion
[03:50:10.000 --> 03:50:16.080]  so they're literally caving to lobbying campaigns partisan lobbying campaigns by
[03:50:16.080 --> 03:50:22.000]  left-wing journalists to artificially manipulate their own search results so the most popular
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:28.880]  content the most requested content does not appear at the top but the most biased content appears
[03:50:28.880 --> 03:50:34.720]  at the top i've talked many times about the importance of algorithms in terms of google
[03:50:34.720 --> 03:50:40.400]  with political candidates they can shift millions and millions of votes on the days of elections
[03:50:40.960 --> 03:50:44.560]  by simply changing the order in which certain search results appear
[03:50:44.560 --> 03:50:52.320]  on top of others as google is going to be a big story coming out quite soon about how youtube
[03:50:52.320 --> 03:50:57.200]  has taken certain key search terms related to news events related to the culture war
[03:50:57.200 --> 03:51:06.160]  related to politics in general and changed them possibly at the request of democratic
[03:51:06.160 --> 03:51:11.680]  lawmakers so they're literally bowing to the demands of democratic congresspeople
[03:51:11.680 --> 03:51:18.160]  to change search results on youtube to game their own search engine to indeed break their
[03:51:18.160 --> 03:51:23.520]  own search engine so what they want to appear at the top appears at the top which is obviously
[03:51:23.520 --> 03:51:29.120]  hyper partisan hyper left-wing content so there's going to be a big story about that coming out
[03:51:29.840 --> 03:51:33.280]  and on a similar subject we have this article out the wall street journal
[03:51:33.920 --> 03:51:38.400]  facebook twitter turned to right-leaning groups to help referee political speech
[03:51:38.400 --> 03:51:42.960]  so for years and years and years we had facebook twitter google youtube
[03:51:43.760 --> 03:51:51.360]  allying with partnering with far left basically smear operations like the adl like the southern
[03:51:51.360 --> 03:51:57.280]  poverty law center organizations that solely exist to fundraise off of smearing people on the right
[03:51:57.280 --> 03:52:03.760]  conservatives operations that solely exist to financially sabotage those people to ruin their
[03:52:03.760 --> 03:52:09.120]  lives we've had big tech colluding with those organizations which are not neutral which are
[03:52:09.120 --> 03:52:16.240]  hyper partisan and bias to referee content on their websites now for the first time they
[03:52:16.240 --> 03:52:23.040]  discovered to their horror that twitter was talking to one individual on the right of the
[03:52:23.040 --> 03:52:28.160]  political spectrum in addition to all these left-wing individuals and organizations that
[03:52:28.160 --> 03:52:32.640]  they're talking to when it comes to refereeing content on their website when it comes to
[03:52:32.640 --> 03:52:39.200]  making decisions about who to ban on their website so the key part of the article is
[03:52:39.200 --> 03:52:44.640]  basically about ten paragraphs into it it says when twitter executives struggle with
[03:52:44.640 --> 03:52:49.040]  whether to follow other silicon valley companies and remove conspiracy theorists alex jones from
[03:52:49.040 --> 03:52:56.480]  the platform in august mr dorsi jack dorsi ceo of twitter privately sought counsel from aliak bar
[03:52:56.480 --> 03:53:02.080]  a conservative political activist who of course was banned by twitter yesterday he did get back on
[03:53:02.080 --> 03:53:07.280]  that was reversed thankfully and rightly so he was responding to a death threat basically and
[03:53:07.280 --> 03:53:12.160]  saying he would defend himself it may have been an inadvisable tweet but it certainly wasn't a
[03:53:12.160 --> 03:53:19.920]  banable offense mr akbar advised mr dorsi against kicking off mr jones despite pressure from users
[03:53:19.920 --> 03:53:25.280]  and twitter employees mr akbar argued that jones hadn't violated any of the science rules and as
[03:53:25.280 --> 03:53:30.640]  you remember for a month between jones being deplatformed by every other big tech platform on
[03:53:30.640 --> 03:53:36.960]  the internet it was the month between i think it was august 6 to september 6 he remained on twitter
[03:53:36.960 --> 03:53:43.920]  because dorsi to his credit saw advice from one person who was right of center god forbid that
[03:53:43.920 --> 03:53:49.600]  they would actually listen to a plurality of voices across the political spectrum
[03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:55.200]  in making decisions on who to ban as we know as the article states twitter ultimately banned
[03:53:55.200 --> 03:53:59.760]  mr jones about a month later citing a violation of its abusive behavior policy which of course
[03:54:00.400 --> 03:54:05.760]  was complete nonsense they banned him for confronting and being mean to a cnn reporter
[03:54:05.760 --> 03:54:13.280]  oliver dorsi the same cnn reporter who is extremely upset today about the fact that
[03:54:13.280 --> 03:54:18.720]  twitter would canvas the opinion of one person on the right in determining who to ban on their
[03:54:18.720 --> 03:54:27.280]  platform dorsi tweeted they see the infamous video dorsi tweeted what in the world aliak bar
[03:54:27.280 --> 03:54:33.280]  isn't exactly a traditional conservative activist by that they mean never trump sell out basically
[03:54:33.280 --> 03:54:39.760]  he's aligned with fringe pro trump voices on the right why is jack seeking advice from him so it's
[03:54:39.760 --> 03:54:45.440]  okay to seek advice from fringe left-wing organizations that have proven to abuse their
[03:54:45.440 --> 03:54:53.040]  own credo on numerous times to maliciously malign and go after conservative individuals to
[03:54:53.040 --> 03:54:58.720]  deplatform them to financially sabotage them obviously with intensive political bias but
[03:54:58.720 --> 03:55:05.040]  as soon as they ask for the advice of one person on the right again everybody freaks out the article
[03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:10.480]  continues twitter spokesman brandon borman said the company and its executive personally
[03:55:10.480 --> 03:55:15.200]  maintain many outside relationships to help us benefit from other perspectives how dare they
[03:55:15.200 --> 03:55:20.560]  on the critical societal issues we deal with so now twitter is having to defend the fact
[03:55:20.560 --> 03:55:27.360]  against this media again onslaught that they sought the advice of one single person aliak bar
[03:55:27.360 --> 03:55:32.880]  on the right when they were talking about banning alex jones which they eventually did anyway so
[03:55:33.520 --> 03:55:39.120]  Darcy and all these mainstream media journalists who have made it their forte again to abuse their
[03:55:39.120 --> 03:55:43.600]  positions of power to abuse their platforms to coordinate and orchestrate giant lobbying
[03:55:43.600 --> 03:55:48.800]  campaigns to deplatform people for having the wrong opinions they learn that twitter canvases
[03:55:48.800 --> 03:55:54.160]  the opinion of one right-wing journalist who isn't even very right-wing he's just on the right
[03:55:54.160 --> 03:56:01.040]  and they have an absolute meltdown because they're terrified of that power being taken away from them
[03:56:01.920 --> 03:56:07.840]  absolutely incredible situation and again there's going to be a big story about google which owns
[03:56:07.840 --> 03:56:13.760]  youtube coming out in a similar vein over the next couple of weeks let's finish off with a
[03:56:13.760 --> 03:56:17.760]  couple of final stories here mother kicked out of british pub for transphobic t-shirt
[03:56:18.400 --> 03:56:21.760]  british mother was kicked out of her local pub after a complaint her t-shirt and blazing with
[03:56:21.760 --> 03:56:27.520]  the dictionary definition of woman was offensive to transgender people so she basically wore a
[03:56:27.520 --> 03:56:33.680]  t-shirt that said women are women and men aren't women that can't be tolerated off you go she'll
[03:56:33.680 --> 03:56:37.760]  probably be doxxed in her entire career and life will be ruined on top of that as well because
[03:56:37.760 --> 03:56:44.720]  that's how the left operates these days meanwhile greek priest beaten by syrian migrants in front
[03:56:44.720 --> 03:56:48.880]  of his own church a greek orthodox priest was beaten by a pair of syrian asylum seekers
[03:56:48.880 --> 03:56:52.960]  in front of his own church the priest observed the migrants parking their motorcycles in the
[03:56:52.960 --> 03:56:57.600]  courtyard of the sanctuary for st nicolas in patinia a neighborhood in athens on friday afternoon
[03:56:57.600 --> 03:57:02.880]  went to confront them and basically they punched him in the face and then fled so more problems
[03:57:02.880 --> 03:57:09.200]  in greece with migrants committing violent crimes as they're prone to do in every major european city
[03:57:10.240 --> 03:57:17.120]  professors warn german welcome culture is over people focus on resistance and national identity
[03:57:17.120 --> 03:57:22.640]  that is a story about how people on the right are being radicalized and starting to dabble
[03:57:22.640 --> 03:57:29.120]  with violence and actual violent hatred um because basically the migrant policy in germany has been
[03:57:29.120 --> 03:57:34.960]  a total disaster violent crime is storing and it's causing extremism on the right which again we
[03:57:34.960 --> 03:57:39.520]  decry all forms of violence that's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour coming up war room with
