[00:00.000 --> 00:26.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, a big four hours coming up here today and it's time to get back to
[00:26.640 --> 00:32.720]  something that we know was the true story the whole time, but that they've distracted us from.
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.160]  But before I bear down into that, they want to censor free speech on the internet
[00:39.120 --> 00:46.640]  as a means of rigging the 2020 election. Here's why they censored Alex Jones. Twitter censorship,
[00:46.640 --> 00:55.120]  the three strikes that took down Alex Jones. Strike one, child abuse. There was a video that was
[00:55.120 --> 01:00.560]  uploaded that showed a child being violently thrown to the ground and crying. The video in question
[01:00.560 --> 01:06.800]  is a viral meme with over 100,000 retweets. The meme showed a child bullying an adult who was
[01:06.800 --> 01:12.080]  eventually pushed to the ground and started crying like a victim. The reason this video went viral
[01:12.080 --> 01:18.640]  in 2018 was because it reflected the strategy of the new American left, bully your opponents
[01:18.640 --> 01:23.760]  and then cry foul when they try to fight back. Forbes originally claimed that the man in the
[01:23.760 --> 01:30.800]  video was Alex Jones himself and somehow info wars is to blame for a video that remained on
[01:30.800 --> 01:38.880]  Twitter for months after the fact. Strike two, inciting violence. The second one was a video
[01:38.880 --> 01:44.320]  that we viewed as incitement of violence. The original video was a message directed towards
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.280]  President Trump. This is an emergency message to President Trump, to Congress and to anyone
[01:49.280 --> 01:54.640]  that supports free speech in this country. Twitter ignores this. They selected a short segment
[01:54.640 --> 02:00.000]  and deceitfully acted as if Alex Jones was inciting violence against the media. But now it's time to
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.080]  act on the enemy. Before they do a false flag. I know the Justice Department's crippled a bunch of
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.560]  followers and cowards, but there's groups, there's grand juries, there's you call for it, it's time
[02:08.560 --> 02:13.760]  politically, economically and judiciously and legally and criminally to move against these
[02:13.760 --> 02:18.560]  people. It's got to be done now. Get together the people you know aren't traders and aren't cowards
[02:18.560 --> 02:22.640]  and aren't hedging their freaking bets like all these other assholes do. And let's go, let's do it.
[02:22.640 --> 02:28.080]  And then there's a bunch of other stuff. The other stuff that Twitter decided to ignore
[02:28.800 --> 02:33.280]  made it clear that the statement was being made to President Trump. Because they're coming.
[02:34.080 --> 02:37.360]  Now your wisdom, you may be playing possum and waiting for him to come in.
[02:37.360 --> 02:42.000]  Alex Jones was encouraging the president to take action against internet censorship.
[02:42.640 --> 02:46.560]  And after omitting this fact, they skip forward to Alex Jones,
[02:46.560 --> 02:50.240]  reminding Americans of the importance of their second amendment rights.
[02:50.240 --> 02:53.360]  People need to have their battle rivals everything ready, their best sides.
[02:53.360 --> 02:56.640]  You got to be ready guys. Media is so disciplined in their deception,
[02:56.640 --> 03:00.560]  anti-foot attack, all these people at the White House beat up reporters, beat up women,
[03:00.560 --> 03:04.400]  children, no coverage. Twitter does not respect the second amendment.
[03:04.960 --> 03:08.000]  Strike three, bullying Oliver Darcy.
[03:09.200 --> 03:15.120]  So the third strike that we looked at was a verbal altercation that Alex got into with a
[03:15.120 --> 03:19.440]  journalist or a virus to America and freedom, smelling like a possum that climbed out of the
[03:19.440 --> 03:24.720]  rear end of a dead cow. You look like a possum that got caught doing some really, really nasty
[03:24.720 --> 03:27.600]  stuff in my view. That's enough. Really? That's hilarious.
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.360]  The altercation with Oliver Darcy is the real reason why Alex Jones was deleted from Twitter.
[03:33.360 --> 03:39.600]  Rather than allowing an open and honest discussion and possibly resolving our differences peacefully,
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.320]  they choose to silence their opposition and push towards a violent civil war.
[03:44.320 --> 03:51.200]  People have pointed out that Jack himself encouraged everyone to read an article which
[03:51.200 --> 03:56.400]  basically outlined the fact that there's no civility left and that civil war is likely to
[03:56.400 --> 04:01.840]  happen in America. It says that the article was why there's no bipartisan way forward at this
[04:01.840 --> 04:08.000]  juncture in our history. One side must win. If you exacerbate the divisions in society that's so
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.880]  rife right now, that is going to create a civil war situation. So they're going to be part of
[04:12.880 --> 04:18.240]  responsible for it as one of the biggest platforms silencing people. They're only going to drive
[04:18.240 --> 04:23.120]  them underground. They're only going to make them more angry, more extreme on both sides.
[04:23.120 --> 04:26.960]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment,
[04:26.960 --> 04:31.360]  but instead attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent,
[04:31.360 --> 04:35.440]  free press, working with big tech. Conspiracy theories is an easy target.
[04:35.440 --> 04:39.760]  There are some who worry this is a slippery slope where people with different viewpoints
[04:39.760 --> 04:49.520]  could be silenced. So you have Democrats openly censoring the internet. You now have Democrats
[04:49.520 --> 04:56.000]  taking a platform on anti-American values. But more than anything, remember we had Democrats
[04:56.000 --> 05:02.320]  colluding with Russia. Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[05:02.320 --> 05:05.680]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore
[05:05.680 --> 05:09.840]  20-year-and-a-half side. But we have the original producer, the original crystal source,
[05:09.840 --> 05:15.360]  the best atomic iodine in the world. X2 is back. We got it. This deal just happened about a month
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.160]  ago. We rushed it into production. It's been bottled. The labels are being put on today.
[05:20.160 --> 05:25.440]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies.
[05:25.440 --> 05:30.160]  And it's going to be shipped out to you. Be sure and sign up for auto-ship. Get an additional 10%
[05:30.160 --> 05:35.200]  off. The 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[05:35.200 --> 05:39.840]  Research the iodine conspiracy. Find out why it's so important. Find out why the globalists
[05:39.840 --> 05:45.520]  don't want you to have the good halogens. You have the bad halogens at infowarstore.com.
[05:45.520 --> 05:50.240]  That's the umbrella site, infowarstore.com. They should write the supplements. And this is the
[05:50.240 --> 06:06.320]  King Daddy. Ladies and gentlemen, it is X2 original now back at infowarstore.com.
[06:21.120 --> 06:29.920]  And we kick off this week of busy broadcasts with what I thought about an hour before going
[06:29.920 --> 06:36.240]  on air today. It was going to be a relatively calm broadcast, relatively slow as far as news
[06:36.240 --> 06:42.160]  developments. And then in about the last 30 minutes before I came on air, I was handed
[06:42.160 --> 06:51.200]  a couple new stories and there were a couple of twists. And now, all of a sudden, what I wanted
[06:51.200 --> 07:01.920]  to talk about last night becomes issue number one in my eyes. Politico has this story that came
[07:01.920 --> 07:08.880]  out today. And it is at the top of Drudge, the week that could reveal Mueller's end game.
[07:08.880 --> 07:18.320]  Well, while there's truth in this article, as far as the facts are concerned, they're
[07:18.320 --> 07:23.760]  missing the bigger picture. Of course, they were never aiming for the bigger picture over there
[07:23.760 --> 07:29.840]  at Politico, were they? Because they never saw it. They never wanted to see it. All they wanted
[07:29.840 --> 07:41.040]  to see was Trump removed from office, which is, of course, Mueller's end game. But you know,
[07:41.040 --> 07:48.400]  as great of a legend of a rogue prosecutor and corrupt prosecutor as Bob Mueller is,
[07:49.360 --> 07:56.880]  a cleanup crew, as good as his reputation is, and as corrupt and rogue as he was,
[07:56.880 --> 08:07.680]  he still got nothing. And think about that. As the Democrats are now ready for Mueller to turn in
[08:07.680 --> 08:18.080]  his final report, and they already know it's got nothing. And so, little Adam Schiff and Eric
[08:18.080 --> 08:26.720]  Swalwell have to launch their own investigation with Jerry Nadler and others with document requests
[08:26.720 --> 08:31.600]  from over 80 different people associated with Trump because Mueller's going to give them
[08:32.160 --> 08:41.200]  nothing. And think about that. And you know, I was reading this Politico article and I wanted
[08:41.200 --> 08:51.360]  to rip my hair out because it celebrates the fact that Bob Mueller has destroyed innocent people's
[08:51.360 --> 09:04.560]  lives. Mike Flynn, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort was engaged in what was some bad corrupt behavior.
[09:05.280 --> 09:08.880]  He was already on trial for that. They let him go. Tony Podesta then got immunity,
[09:08.880 --> 09:14.080]  testified against Paul Manafort. Boom, 47 months in jail.
[09:16.400 --> 09:20.720]  But they knew there was no Russian collusion. They knew it all along.
[09:22.720 --> 09:28.320]  But they thought Mueller is so good. He's so disciplined. He's so corrupt. He's been through
[09:28.320 --> 09:34.960]  the weeds so many times for the Bushes, for the Clintons, for Epstein. He could pull out
[09:34.960 --> 09:41.840]  one last victory over America. He could pull off one last corrupt investigation and he could find
[09:41.840 --> 09:47.920]  anything, just anything on Donald Trump and he couldn't find a damn thing. Think about that.
[09:48.640 --> 09:58.560]  That is almost unbelievable. But that's where we're at now. And so, if you want to get angry,
[09:58.560 --> 10:05.200]  I would read this story. If you'd rather not increase your blood pressure, perhaps don't. But
[10:05.200 --> 10:12.720]  here's the twist because the title for today's show is Mueller Going to Flip on Democrats.
[10:15.280 --> 10:22.560]  Now, that's a catch because the story is that Mueller's end game is going to be revealed.
[10:22.560 --> 10:29.040]  Well, what we're told was Mueller's end game to find Russian collusion. So if the end game
[10:30.240 --> 10:34.880]  is to find Russian collusion, then Mueller is about to flip on the Democrats
[10:36.640 --> 10:41.840]  because they were the ones in bed with Russia. And think about this. The only thing they have
[10:43.280 --> 10:50.320]  is Manafort making deals with Ukrainians, not exactly Russia's strongest ally.
[10:50.320 --> 10:56.000]  Trump's foreign policy has gone against Russia in many different ways.
[10:59.040 --> 11:01.920]  Of course, again, it was never about finding Russian collusion.
[11:04.320 --> 11:10.320]  And so, you know, Bob Mueller knows it was Hillary Clinton. They just had a hearing last week.
[11:11.440 --> 11:15.760]  I think his name was Bruce Johnson, was the Republican who came out and he said,
[11:15.760 --> 11:22.880]  I want to release the transcript from the Bruce or behind closed doors interview.
[11:26.080 --> 11:31.920]  Because all these Republicans in the committee have read the transcript and or were there.
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.880]  And it's literally Bruce or telling these committees
[11:38.880 --> 11:46.160]  that Fusion GPS was working with Russian intelligence,
[11:47.840 --> 11:53.840]  all part of an opposition research campaign paid for by Hillary Clinton.
[11:56.480 --> 11:58.320]  And so there's your Russian collusion, folks.
[12:00.640 --> 12:04.240]  Right there. And it was there the whole time. And we always knew it. So
[12:04.240 --> 12:11.840]  since Bob Mueller's endgame is to find Russian collusion, the reports are he's going to put
[12:11.840 --> 12:18.560]  his report out maybe by the end of the month. So does that mean Bob Mueller is about to flip
[12:18.560 --> 12:25.840]  on the Democrats and turn in Hillary Clinton for Russian collusion? After all, that's what
[12:25.840 --> 12:34.320]  this was all about. And I mean, it must be a big deal to find this Russian collusion with
[12:34.320 --> 12:39.680]  this investigation costing us tens of millions of dollars, tearing this country apart.
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.920]  And I mean, we got to find this Russian conclusion, folks. This is huge. I mean,
[12:47.920 --> 12:53.520]  Russia is clearly a threat to us right now. I mean, boy, we just, oh, Russia's so bad. Oh,
[12:53.520 --> 13:02.000]  no. Meanwhile, we're going to stop foreign interference in our elections, blame Russia for
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.840]  that investigation. But the Democrats now want anybody to vote. They're now passing legislation
[13:09.840 --> 13:16.080]  for non-citizens to vote. So foreign interference in the elections is fine for Democrats. As long
[13:16.080 --> 13:25.760]  as you just come here illegally, steal from us and vote. Democrat. But that's the big question.
[13:27.440 --> 13:30.400]  Is Bob Mueller about to flip on the Democrats?
[13:33.760 --> 13:39.200]  Is Bob Mueller about to turn in his final report on Russian collusion and actually deliver the
[13:39.200 --> 13:48.320]  Russian collusion, which was Hillary Clinton, Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele, and five Russian
[13:48.320 --> 13:57.520]  intelligence, intelligent agents? And it's all in the original indictment from Bob Mueller.
[13:57.520 --> 14:06.560]  All of it. So is Mueller going to finish his report?
[14:10.240 --> 14:19.040]  Tell America the Russian collusion was Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. And that's not even
[14:19.040 --> 14:24.320]  the Uranium One deal. We're not even talking about the Uranium One deal. That could be a
[14:24.320 --> 14:32.400]  separate investigation. But Bob Mueller is looking for Russian collusion when it comes to the 2016
[14:32.400 --> 14:39.040]  presidential election. And he found it, folks. He found the cold heart evidence that Hillary
[14:39.040 --> 14:51.360]  Clinton paid Fusion GPS to get dirt on Donald Trump from Russian intelligence sources,
[14:51.360 --> 14:57.920]  all on record, all paid for by Hillary Clinton, all orchestrated by the Democrats.
[15:00.800 --> 15:09.680]  But that is just the loose thread in the jacket or in the sweater. Because once you start to pull
[15:09.680 --> 15:22.400]  that thread, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, the emperor has no clothes. Because it wasn't
[15:22.400 --> 15:28.800]  just Russian collusion by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. It was illegal spying by the
[15:28.800 --> 15:40.320]  Obama administration based off of the dirt that Clinton got from Russian intelligence. Uh-oh.
[15:41.200 --> 15:47.200]  Now what are we talking about? Hmm. Then you start to look into collusion with Obama and Hillary
[15:47.200 --> 15:53.840]  Clinton and the DOJ when it comes to the Clinton email investigation. Uh-oh. See how the emperor
[15:53.840 --> 16:00.160]  has no clothes once you pull that loose thread? Most of you know that heart disease is the number
[16:00.160 --> 16:05.440]  one silent killer in the U.S. What if I told you for just 54.95 a month you could fight against

[20:56.320 --> 21:00.640]  I'm not drinking the Turbo Force. I'm actually drinking the coffee from Infowarsstore.com,
[21:00.640 --> 21:06.880]  the Patriot Blend Coffee is what I'm drinking today, because I just wasn't, I didn't want the full
[21:06.880 --> 21:12.080]  Turbo Force rush this morning, and I'm actually glad that I didn't do it, because if I would have
[21:12.080 --> 21:16.960]  drank Turbo Force and then read that Politico story, I probably would have started breaking
[21:16.960 --> 21:22.800]  things around here, because Turbo Force is that powerful, and I didn't want to feel like Alexandria
[21:22.800 --> 21:30.400]  Ocasio-Cortez after she rails back a line of speed, so I decided not to do the Turbo Force today, but
[21:31.840 --> 21:37.680]  if you want to feel like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez does after she bangs back and ate a ball of coke,
[21:37.680 --> 21:45.200]  then Turbo Force is the product for you. No, folks, the energy is real, the focus is real,
[21:45.200 --> 21:52.560]  and don't take a full packet if you're somebody that feels the effects of caffeine, because it
[21:52.560 --> 21:57.680]  will have you bouncing off the walls, ladies and gentlemen, but if you're someone like me that's
[21:57.680 --> 22:05.360]  already kind of high octane, it is just wonderful, and it's sustained energy, but it will give you
[22:05.360 --> 22:11.520]  a blast of energy, so if you don't want the energy blast, maybe just do half, but if you're trying
[22:11.520 --> 22:17.040]  to get an energy blast that sustains for hours, Turbo Force is the real deal, and you know what,
[22:17.040 --> 22:22.000]  I'm just going to say it on air because it's like, I don't even do the due diligence around here,
[22:22.000 --> 22:28.000]  but we really need to sell Turbo Force guys over there and the other side. We need to be selling
[22:28.000 --> 22:35.040]  Turbo Force in like a big canister, like they do other pre-workouts, so you can just buy it in bulk
[22:35.040 --> 22:38.480]  and you don't have to do the individual packaging. I think it's ready to do that. I think it's popular
[22:38.480 --> 22:45.040]  enough. I think people love it, so that's Turbo Force from InfowarsStore.com. All kinds of great

[23:11.360 --> 23:18.240]  Now, speaking of Cortez, she was in town. She wrote the Green New Deal that says,
[23:18.240 --> 23:23.040]  stop flying in airplanes and quit eating beef, and she immediately hopped on an airplane and flew
[23:23.040 --> 23:28.560]  to Texas and had a beef taco. She wants everything to be free and then you had to pay money to see
[23:28.560 --> 23:37.280]  her speak. But I give her credit. She really became a staunch true American politician real
[23:37.280 --> 23:42.320]  quickly. I mean, a total hypocrite just boom right out of the gate. So good for her. But she was
[23:42.320 --> 23:48.000]  speaking at South by Southwest, which, you know, I was talking to someone about this because it's
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.240]  like this whole thing like, what is South by Southwest? Well, it used to be a music festival
[23:52.240 --> 23:55.920]  kind of thing where you saw a bunch of different bands and different musics and you kind of
[23:55.920 --> 24:00.800]  went around town or whatever. But now it's just all political crap and like
[24:02.720 --> 24:09.280]  techie crap. And they kicked me out the last two years. They actually kind of let me walk
[24:09.280 --> 24:13.360]  around this year. My cameraman thinks it was because he was walking around with me.
[24:14.160 --> 24:19.360]  And maybe that's the case because they kept talking to him instead of me. But I digress because
[24:19.360 --> 24:26.960]  it's what Cortez said at South by Southwest that will really have you shocked. So let's go ahead
[24:26.960 --> 24:37.280]  and play this. Alexandra Ocasio Cortez, you know, she got right off of a bender and apparently
[24:37.280 --> 24:44.880]  spoke at South by Southwest and listen to what she thinks about America. The thing that is really
[24:44.880 --> 24:54.000]  hard for people to sometimes see is that when we are on this path of a slow erosion and a slow,
[24:54.000 --> 25:03.360]  slow, slow, just like move away from what we've always been. You won't even realize that you've
[25:03.360 --> 25:09.440]  drifted 100 miles. So when someone's talking about our core, it's like, oh, this is radical.
[25:09.440 --> 25:16.640]  But this isn't radical. This is what we've always been. It's just that now we've strayed so far away
[25:16.640 --> 25:24.160]  from what has. You know, I really shouldn't be intellectually breaking down this woman's
[25:24.160 --> 25:29.040]  commentary because she's a complete idiot. But like, do you notice how it doesn't even make sense?
[25:29.040 --> 25:34.320]  Here she is talking about how America has strayed from its foundation straight away from what made
[25:34.320 --> 25:40.640]  it great free market capitalism. Everybody gets along. That's why people went out and voted for
[25:40.640 --> 25:47.920]  Trump. And now here she is the one that's the farthest away from that wants socialism. And
[25:47.920 --> 25:53.920]  she's going to sit here as like the voice that's trying to bring America back. I swear.
[25:55.120 --> 26:00.560]  She doesn't even know what she's talking about. She just opens her lips and just says whatever
[26:00.560 --> 26:08.960]  comes in her mind. All right, go back and just and good and equitable and productive. And so
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.760]  I think all of these things sound radical compared to where we are, but where we are is not a good
[26:15.760 --> 26:24.240]  thing. And this idea of like 10% better from garbage is shouldn't be what we settle for.
[26:24.240 --> 26:33.360]  It's like this like it feels like moderate is not a stance. It's just an attitude toward life of like
[26:39.440 --> 26:47.440]  okay. I mean, that is a real intellectual right there. That is powerful stuff.
[26:47.440 --> 26:54.800]  What did she even say? You couldn't even boil that down to determine what the point of it was.
[26:55.440 --> 26:58.240]  And guys, let's let's find the clip because I don't have it on my video list
[26:59.120 --> 27:04.800]  where she says capitalism is irredeemable. So let's get that one too. And let's just
[27:04.800 --> 27:18.240]  look at what's in the news today because Bernie Sanders gets 10,000 people to show up
[27:19.120 --> 27:28.080]  at a campaign rally and look at these headlines. Axios poll. Young Americans are embracing socialism.
[27:28.080 --> 27:37.440]  Yeah, here's why. From Michael Snyder, end of the American dream, 50 actual college courses
[27:37.440 --> 27:41.680]  titles that prove that America's universities are training our college students to be socialists.
[27:43.920 --> 27:47.920]  Yeah, I just can tell you from my own experience
[27:50.400 --> 27:54.960]  at a public university, you don't even notice it until you get out. Honestly,
[27:54.960 --> 28:00.720]  the socialist propaganda because at the time it just feels progressive and like, oh, yeah,
[28:00.720 --> 28:08.720]  this is where we're going. But then you realize, no, they want us socialists. So Cortez says America
[28:08.720 --> 28:15.520]  is garbage. Yeah, that's why everybody's racing to get here. Yeah, you know, actually guys,
[28:17.040 --> 28:24.080]  there's a floating island of garbage off the coast of California. You know, people are just
[28:24.080 --> 28:30.880]  rushing to that. They just cannot wait. People are swimming from Cuba. They're leaving Honduras,
[28:30.880 --> 28:36.400]  they're leaving El Salvador, and they're literally swimming hundreds of miles to get onto this
[28:36.400 --> 28:42.160]  island of garbage that's floating off the coast. I mean, it's tough, but it's America.
[28:43.360 --> 28:47.520]  That's what people want. They want an island of garbage. And so everybody leaves their
[28:47.520 --> 28:53.520]  socialist hellholes and they come to the pile of garbage that is America. But that's just Alexander
[28:53.520 --> 28:56.960]  Cortez is logic. We're just going off her logic because she's such a genius.
[28:58.320 --> 29:03.520]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[29:03.520 --> 29:09.280]  may not be fully detected by you. But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and
[29:09.280 --> 29:14.400]  drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that
[29:14.400 --> 29:19.520]  something is wrong. Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of
[29:19.520 --> 29:25.440]  people's lives across America. My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.440 --> 29:28.880]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[29:28.880 --> 29:33.440]  healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone. Anybody over 40 in the
[29:33.440 --> 29:38.240]  North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their
[29:38.240 --> 29:45.040]  cardiovascular system healthy. Order your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.

[30:17.600 --> 30:21.600]  We still got another deep breath crystal source, but I thought at the other two types of iodine,
[30:21.600 --> 30:27.040]  the scientists that do that, it sold a lot that people want original X2. I was resigned the fact
[30:27.040 --> 30:32.800]  we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago. We now have X2 again at FullWareStore.com,
[30:32.800 --> 30:39.040]  so hallelujah. It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company,

[33:18.560 --> 33:25.760]  It is the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[33:32.720 --> 33:40.240]  All right, I have been given exclusive video here today. We've just received it
[33:40.240 --> 33:48.880]  breaking. We have Tucker Carlson's apology for the shock jock segment he did with Bubba the Love
[33:48.880 --> 33:56.880]  Sponge. You know, it's funny that they go after Tucker Carlson for this segment he did on Bubba
[33:56.880 --> 34:00.080]  the Love Sponge. And okay, whatever, you know, say whatever you want about what he said.
[34:01.600 --> 34:08.160]  But I mean, Bubba the Love Sponge literally makes a living doing that every day. He's an
[34:08.160 --> 34:12.640]  offshoot of Howard Stern. So it's just funny how here's Bubba the Love Sponge who talks about
[34:12.640 --> 34:18.640]  this garbage for a living, makes millions doing it, and then it's like, oh, Tucker Carlson's the
[34:18.640 --> 34:25.680]  bad guy because he's a conservative commentator on Fox News. So it's like, yeah, just allow the
[34:25.680 --> 34:28.800]  shock jocks to go out and say whatever they want every day and then go after the conservative
[34:28.800 --> 34:35.360]  television host. But I guess that's their way of saying he's a fraud for morality, I guess. I don't
[34:35.360 --> 34:39.600]  know. I didn't know these people cared about morals. They talk about, you know, breaking
[34:39.600 --> 34:47.360]  baby's necks, breaking infant's necks when a baby is born. So I don't know where they get
[34:47.360 --> 34:55.040]  all the time on morals. But you know, I think we're gonna, I mean, look, we can play these
[34:55.040 --> 35:01.280]  Cortez clips all day and just to show how stupid she is. But that's just a symptom of society.
[35:01.280 --> 35:10.480]  But look at this story. AOC calls Ilhan Omar one of the most effective voices right now. Now,
[35:10.480 --> 35:18.240]  I'd love to hear someone actually ask her to explain that. It would be a jumbled word vomit.
[35:20.720 --> 35:27.840]  But I want you guys pull this picture up right here because this picture actually
[35:27.840 --> 35:32.560]  explains everything that these two are about. This is Ilhan Omar
[35:36.400 --> 35:40.480]  and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez giving each other some love here,
[35:42.320 --> 35:51.040]  celebrating the takedown of the West. That's what this is. They hate the West. They hate capitalism.
[35:51.040 --> 35:59.040]  They hate men. And they think it's all men's fault. And so they're sitting here celebrating
[35:59.040 --> 36:06.880]  the fact that there are two women in Congress, kindred spirits trying to destroy freedom in the
[36:06.880 --> 36:13.760]  West. That's all you need to know about those two. Forget the fact that Cortez is a 25 IQ
[36:13.760 --> 36:19.360]  socialist who just got on the other side of the bar. Forget about the fact that Ilhan Omar
[36:19.360 --> 36:28.080]  says that Israel is the worst and brainwashing everybody. And that Jews are the worst. And
[36:28.080 --> 36:34.320]  she gets away with that. And apparently we're at war with radical Islam and she gets elected
[36:34.320 --> 36:41.440]  somehow. But fine, whatever. Forget all that. The reason why these two are kindred spirits,
[36:41.440 --> 36:47.760]  the reason why these two hit it off, the reason why Cortez says Omar is one of the most effective
[36:47.760 --> 36:54.080]  voices right now because together holding hands, those two are trying to destroy America. And
[36:54.080 --> 36:58.800]  that's what they're celebrating. But I don't even have to tell you that. Cortez tells you that.
[37:00.880 --> 37:10.240]  Omar tells you that. So just let that sink in. Because here's the thing. I mean,
[37:10.800 --> 37:16.560]  for as bad as Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are, they actually love capitalism in the West
[37:16.560 --> 37:23.280]  because it made them filthy rich. So they actually love it. They don't actually want to kill
[37:23.280 --> 37:30.000]  capitalism. They just want to suck off the golden goose slowly but surely. But see, Cortez doesn't
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.720]  understand that. She was raised a good socialist. And so she wants to destroy the free market in
[37:36.720 --> 37:41.120]  the West. Ilhan Omar wants to destroy the West because he thinks it's run by Israel.
[37:41.120 --> 37:45.680]  So just understand that those two are kindred spirits
[37:47.760 --> 37:53.200]  in their fight to destroy Western civilization. And they're in our Congress.
[37:55.440 --> 38:00.560]  Boy, that's scary. But you know, I mean, that's kind of like peanuts compared to like a Bob Mueller
[38:01.600 --> 38:06.400]  who's doing deals with Jeffrey Epstein and then doing a fake Russian collusion investigation
[38:06.400 --> 38:14.400]  destroying people's lives. But that all goes on. And then I'm supposed to be upset because Tucker
[38:14.400 --> 38:24.960]  Carlson went on a shock jock radio show and made a crude joke. Give me a break. So American pop culture
[38:24.960 --> 38:33.840]  just totally, it's all about consuming degenerative garbage. And so Tucker Carlson can't go do a
[38:33.840 --> 38:40.560]  shock jock segment. I mean, give me a break. Not standing up for what Tucker said, but it's just
[38:40.560 --> 38:48.160]  like, that's your big issue. Media matters. I invited Timothy Johnson on from media matters to
[38:48.160 --> 38:55.440]  come on. He doesn't want to. Shocking, right? Pull up a picture of Timothy Johnson, the media
[38:55.440 --> 39:00.880]  matters author right now. Because this guy is a genius. I mean, you can just see it. He kind of
[39:00.880 --> 39:05.920]  looks like Cortez in a way. Like, you know, they just got out of the same back alley.
[39:07.920 --> 39:11.680]  You know, they got the same guy that they go to, you know what I'm saying? But but
[39:13.040 --> 39:18.080]  so media matters puts out a story. Yeah, he just that actually he was just hanging out with Cortez
[39:18.080 --> 39:26.720]  before they shot that picture. But media matters puts out a hit piece on Tucker Carlson as if
[39:26.720 --> 39:34.000]  anybody is going to care me. But but we have the exclusive apology here. So so I have been,
[39:34.640 --> 39:39.200]  I've been given the exclusive Tucker Carlson apology. We're going to air it right now at
[39:39.200 --> 39:44.720]  info wars. I know that this is big. So so let's go ahead and play it guys. Here is Tucker Carlson
[39:44.720 --> 39:51.600]  apologizing after the media matters hit piece. I really killed everyone on the roster. I just
[39:51.600 --> 39:57.280]  want to say from the bottom of my heart, I'd like to take this chance to apologize to absolutely
[39:57.280 --> 40:07.920]  nobody. Oh my gosh, well, okay, there it is, folks. You heard it right here. Tucker Carlson
[40:07.920 --> 40:14.720]  says he apologizes to absolutely nobody. And I don't blame him. I wonder how many Democrats
[40:14.720 --> 40:20.240]  have gone on the Howard Stern show or the Bubba the Love Sponge show. How about a media matters
[40:20.240 --> 40:27.920]  hit piece Kamala Harris lies about smoking weed in college. Remember that one? Oh, yeah. Ah,
[40:27.920 --> 40:35.280]  I was listening to Snoop Dogg smoking weed. Actually, your dirt bag, you're a little older
[40:35.280 --> 40:40.320]  than you thought you were didn't you thought that Snoop Dogg was actually making albums when you
[40:40.320 --> 40:45.920]  were in college. No, you graduated before he put out his first album. So not only did you admit
[40:45.920 --> 40:49.920]  you were smoking weed in college, which I couldn't care less, whatever, you did throw people in jail
[40:49.920 --> 40:57.360]  for smoking weed. But that's your hypocrisy, not mine. The fact that you lied about it says even
[40:57.360 --> 41:03.920]  more about you. But it's like the same thing, you know, because, see, there's precedent in,
[41:04.560 --> 41:13.600]  in a courtroom where a liar is a liar is a liar. And so immediately, whenever a witness is found
[41:13.600 --> 41:17.840]  to be liar, they're never a witness again. That's why the Michael Cohen thing was so unprecedented.
[41:17.840 --> 41:22.560]  You'll never see that as soon as somebody's determined to lie in court, throw them out,
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.880]  they're done. Oh, but Cohen gets to be brought back as soon as he's going to lie against Trump.
[41:26.880 --> 41:34.640]  If he lies for Trump, you know, bad lies against Trump good. But it's like, with Jesse Smollett,
[41:35.200 --> 41:41.760]  how do I even know he's gay? Maybe he's faking that. Kamala Harris, who is Kamala Harris,
[41:41.760 --> 41:50.640]  really, the descendant of slave owners? Hmm. Hmm. Why did Kamala Harris lie to us about smoking
[41:50.640 --> 41:59.840]  weed in college? Hmm. And actually, I'm dead serious about this. I think only because President
[41:59.840 --> 42:05.200]  Trump did it, I think he should issue some sort of statement because remember that the Democrats
[42:05.200 --> 42:09.600]  were pushing for Trump's medical records. They wanted to see his medical records. They made
[42:09.600 --> 42:15.280]  a big fuss about his health. And so he put out his medical records, put out his drug tests and
[42:15.280 --> 42:20.560]  everything. I think every member of Congress should do a drug test and make it public.
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.280]  And I don't even care if half of them are smoking pot. I just think that they should all do it so
[42:27.280 --> 42:35.360]  that we can know. If every member of Congress had to submit a drug test, there'd be a huge amount
[42:35.360 --> 42:39.440]  of money going on Vegas, all the drugs that would show up in a Cortez's system and be like, you
[42:39.440 --> 42:45.680]  know, well, or imagine a Pelosi. But but here's why they don't want a Pelosi to take a drug test,
[42:45.680 --> 42:49.600]  because then you'll see all the actual pharmaceuticals she's on for the actual real
[42:49.600 --> 42:54.160]  health issues that she has. And so then it's like, oh, the Democrats can't say Trump is unhealthy.
[42:54.160 --> 42:56.960]  Look at our leaders. They're literally having problems with dementia.
[42:57.840 --> 43:02.240]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there
[43:02.240 --> 43:06.320]  for my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong now. Now I can be there for my
[43:06.320 --> 43:11.600]  children. Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can teach them what I've
[43:11.600 --> 43:15.440]  learned. But not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age, your words gone forever, but now
[43:15.440 --> 43:19.920]  there isn't better getting rid of what you said they were before. It's so much easier to burn
[43:19.920 --> 43:26.080]  video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it? But I have joined my
[43:26.080 --> 43:30.960]  will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed now as long as I realize I've done right. And
[43:30.960 --> 43:35.280]  the longer the people know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either as long as you bind
[43:35.280 --> 43:40.480]  yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it. There is a magic that
[43:40.480 --> 43:45.840]  then takes place, the prince in space and time. When you commit the award of mouth or to pray for
[43:45.840 --> 43:51.280]  us or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing. So please
[43:51.280 --> 43:56.560]  now commit to support info wars however you can and realize your provision to info wars is your

[46:20.480 --> 46:25.280]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[46:25.280 --> 46:30.560]  hours and have terrible side effects. We have developed hands down from our research, the most

[46:47.040 --> 46:52.160]  very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half pack the first time you take it because turbo force
[46:52.160 --> 46:57.600]  is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive turbo force and enforce live.com
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:04.640 --> 47:17.760]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance.
[47:17.760 --> 47:20.560]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[47:22.880 --> 47:29.840]  All right. The second hour of today's Alex Jones show is wide open. So I'm going to open up the
[47:29.840 --> 47:42.240]  phone lines on this Monday. Let me pull up a phone number on the screen there when you get a second
[47:42.240 --> 47:47.200]  guys. I think it's triple eight. In fact, I'm not even going to say it. In fact, I really don't even
[47:47.200 --> 47:51.280]  need to say it. As soon as I open up the phone lines, 1000 people are going to call. But specifically,
[47:51.280 --> 47:57.280]  I want to know today, what do you think will actually come of the final Mueller report? How
[47:57.280 --> 48:03.920]  do you think that goes? And then what happens next? So it's triple eight or it's eight, seven, seven,
[48:03.920 --> 48:08.160]  seven, eight, nine, Alex, eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, two, five, three, nine.
[48:09.360 --> 48:15.200]  What do you think comes of the final Mueller report? And then what do you think happens afterwards?
[48:16.720 --> 48:20.080]  So we'll be taking phone calls for the entire second hour
[48:21.920 --> 48:24.880]  with you here on the Alex Jones show. I do have some other news I need to get to.
[48:24.880 --> 48:29.280]  And then I almost want to say
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.800]  I have perhaps and I know that there are other people who could challenge me on this. But I think
[48:36.800 --> 48:45.280]  I have perhaps the three best tweets that all came basically from Trump derangement
[48:45.280 --> 48:50.320]  syndrome here on my desk. And it's just like shocking how out of control these people are.
[48:50.320 --> 48:56.960]  Then you have a bus aid taking a Trump hat off a 14 year old student's head.
[48:59.360 --> 49:08.640]  So I mean, what is wrong with people? Trump derangement syndrome induced by mainstream media.
[49:10.560 --> 49:13.520]  But it's nice because the renegades just want to wear a Trump hat more.
[49:13.520 --> 49:20.800]  So as soon as you tell me not to do something, I'm going to go ahead and just do it anyway.
[49:22.400 --> 49:25.280]  Isn't that the nature of defiance?
[49:27.680 --> 49:32.000]  So we'll take your phone calls eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, Alex, eight, seven,
[49:32.000 --> 49:37.600]  seven, seven, eight, nine, two, five, three, nine. What do you think will happen in the final reveal
[49:37.600 --> 49:46.960]  of Mueller's Russia probe? And then what do you think happens next? We'll be taking your calls.
[49:53.360 --> 50:02.960]  All right, folks. Not only do we have Jack Dorsey tweeting out in 2013 learned a code. That's right.
[50:02.960 --> 50:10.160]  Jack Dorsey tweets out every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn to
[50:10.160 --> 50:17.200]  code. There it is right there on screen. Bang. But people are now getting banned and silenced on
[50:17.200 --> 50:23.440]  Twitter. His platform for tweeting out learned a code. Chuck Ross daily call a reporter just got
[50:23.440 --> 50:28.720]  hit with this 12 hour suspension for tweeting literally hashtag learn to code. Jack Dorsey
[50:28.720 --> 50:35.600]  tweeted it out, though. Of course, the whole thing is ridiculous. Learning to code is a
[50:36.240 --> 50:44.000]  very valuable thing to know how to do. I mean, it's like, it's like saying learn five languages.
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.560]  Every student should be able to learn five languages. Oh, oh my gosh. He just said learn
[50:51.120 --> 50:58.000]  a foreign language. Sensor him. It's like, wait a second, learning a foreign language is a valuable
[50:58.000 --> 51:04.080]  thing. Learning to code is a valuable thing. You can maybe get a job someday, maybe start your own
[51:04.080 --> 51:12.560]  business. But if you tweet out learn to code now, you're getting censored unless you're Jack Dorsey.
[51:13.360 --> 51:21.040]  I see. I see. But perhaps even more insane than that. This story comes from CNN.
[51:21.040 --> 51:26.560]  CNN. Let 16 year olds vote. Oh my gosh.
[51:30.160 --> 51:37.520]  I swear. Give me. Yeah. I look for radio listeners. We have the story pulled up. I swear
[51:37.520 --> 51:44.880]  to you. I am. I swear to you. This is actually the first line in this story. Okay. Brace yourselves.
[51:44.880 --> 51:54.960]  Headline from CNN.com. Let 16 year olds vote. My son follows the news closely. He watches
[51:54.960 --> 52:09.280]  John Oliver every week. Uh, that's not news. Uh, Noah Berlatsky at CNN. Earth to Noah.
[52:09.280 --> 52:19.680]  Noah. Paging Noah. Are you with us? Noah? Noah. Noah. Where are you?
[52:21.600 --> 52:27.760]  He's writing a story for CNN saying John Oliver is news. Wow.
[52:30.240 --> 52:37.120]  You know, you would expect maybe a 16 year old to think that's news. But for Noah Berlatsky,
[52:37.120 --> 52:39.840]  who could have colluded with Russia for all I know,
[52:42.800 --> 52:49.120]  to say that John Oliver is news. Wow. And you know, it's funny because
[52:49.920 --> 52:55.520]  Darren McBreein forever has been saying how that's, that's how the left gets most of their news.
[52:55.520 --> 53:01.440]  They actually think late night comedy shows are news. And it's just like, well, they just revealed
[53:01.440 --> 53:08.240]  it. So Darren, congratulations, Darren. Take this story, frame it and put it on your desk.
[53:10.240 --> 53:14.320]  My son watches the news closely. He follows John Oliver.
[53:17.120 --> 53:20.400]  But where is John Oliver from? Isn't he from like Manchester, England or something?
[53:20.400 --> 53:32.720]  A comedy show host. Literally. I follow the news closely. I watch Jimmy Kimmel.
[53:34.480 --> 53:43.520]  I'm very informed. I just watched Jimmy Fallon. Don't you know how intellectual I am? I haven't
[53:43.520 --> 53:54.560]  missed a Ellen show. Yes. I'm very informed. I watch Stephen Colbert every night.
[53:57.840 --> 54:04.880]  Oh, you must watch that tripe Tucker Carlson. Didn't you hear what he said on a radio show?
[54:06.160 --> 54:10.640]  I watched John Oliver. Can you imagine though, think about these late night show hosts like
[54:10.640 --> 54:16.640]  Jimmy Kimmel does a blackface skit. Oh, and so people at University of Tennessee are now
[54:16.640 --> 54:22.400]  subject. This is like insane. So like blackface was like a big joke years ago. It's like doing
[54:22.400 --> 54:27.040]  blackface was like a joke. Ted dancing, Ted dancing did it as a joke. Apparently all these
[54:27.040 --> 54:32.160]  former Democrat congressmen did it as a joke in high school. Jimmy Kimmel did it as a joke,
[54:32.160 --> 54:37.760]  pretending to be Carl Malone, have an alien stick, probes up his butt. It was funny. But now it's
[54:37.760 --> 54:44.960]  like you can't do it anymore. And so the University of Tennessee has now released an official statement
[54:44.960 --> 54:52.960]  saying you cannot do blackface on campus. Okay, so fine. I mean, whatever. I don't know what the
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.680]  hell's going on here. I thought Obama like helped us end racism. I thought that Martin Luther King
[54:57.680 --> 55:02.960]  said quit seeing people by the color of their skin. What in the hell happened? I was watching Jimmy
[55:02.960 --> 55:09.440]  Kimmel last night. Yeah, yeah. Robert Downey Jr. plays a black guy in a film. He's white.
[55:13.040 --> 55:20.800]  You never go full blackface. Geez, what is wrong with these people? Oh, I know, they watch
[55:20.800 --> 55:24.560]  John Oliver every night and they think it's news. That's what's wrong with these people.
[55:26.160 --> 55:29.600]  You know what? I didn't even do what I wanted to do. So let me just do it for the rest of the
[55:29.600 --> 55:36.000]  segment, guys. Pull up all the b-roll and everything. So tragic situation. 157 people die
[55:38.160 --> 55:46.480]  on the Ethiopian Airlines crash. And you know, this is widely covered yesterday. A lot of b-roll,
[55:46.480 --> 55:52.800]  obviously, a lot of stuff on television and everything. And I'm not trying to make lie to
[55:52.800 --> 56:02.880]  this. I'm really not. But I cannot help but have to use this as a tool, if you will, a navigation
[56:02.880 --> 56:06.240]  tool for people to understand something. And I have to point you in the direction of September
[56:06.240 --> 56:12.480]  11, 2001. Because I'm not sitting here acting like I know what happened on September 11, 2001.
[56:12.480 --> 56:16.080]  I'm sitting here telling you I have a brain in my head and I use common sense and logic and
[56:16.080 --> 56:24.000]  reasoning to make obvious observations and then reach conclusions. And so if you just look at
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.840]  all the b-roll, the crew's rolling it right now from the Ethiopian plane crash site, there's debris
[56:29.840 --> 56:37.360]  everywhere. There's plane parts everywhere. I mean, it's like, you know, what you would expect to see
[56:37.360 --> 56:46.560]  if a Boeing airplane went down. A massive structure, a massive metal object went down. It's what you
[56:46.560 --> 56:53.920]  would expect. Tons of debris and rubble everywhere. But then you go look at the Flight 93 plane crash
[56:53.920 --> 57:05.520]  on September 11th. No debris. Literally none. Not even a single scrap. Amazing. Amazing. Just
[57:05.520 --> 57:11.600]  a big hole in the ground. I guess the plane just evaporated. I guess the plane just disintegrated
[57:11.600 --> 57:18.480]  somehow. I guess it was just made of nanothermites and it just burned itself into nothingness.
[57:20.160 --> 57:27.120]  So, tragic plane crash and all the b-roll shows all the debris that you would expect to see from
[57:27.120 --> 57:33.120]  a plane crash. Yeah, a plane crash. There's debris, plane parts, scrap metal, rubble everywhere.
[57:33.120 --> 57:39.440]  But on September 11th, 2001, Flight 93 in Pennsylvania crash landed and there was no debris.
[57:40.640 --> 57:49.840]  No rubble. I don't know. Maybe my eyes deceived me. Well, I've got some really good news for all
[57:49.840 --> 57:53.440]  the viewers and all the listeners. This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep
[57:53.440 --> 57:57.120]  earth crystals anymore. It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer,

[59:51.520 --> 59:54.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:54.400 --> 01:00:16.080]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:22.560]  We're about to start taking your phone calls but first the Democrats say they want to stop foreign
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:29.280]  interferences in our elections. Then why are they pushing for noncitizens to vote? Here's the report
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:35.440]  from John Bowne. President Trump is requesting an additional $8.6 billion combined with funds
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:41.760]  from the emergency declaration to allow the completion of 722 miles of barrier construction
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.640]  as reported by the Daily Caller. And if the Democrats could unplug their ears, they might
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:52.800]  hear the tune their leaders sang roughly a decade ago. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.320]  for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:04.880]  recent years and we must do more to stop it. We simply cannot allow people to pour into the
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:12.400]  United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked. We do not want to do anything to encourage more
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.600]  illegal immigration into this country. The American people are fundamentally pro-legal
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:25.360]  immigration and anti-illegal immigration. We will only pass comprehensive reform when we
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:31.840]  recognize this fundamental concept. The projections are dire. The agency is now on track to apprehend
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.560]  more migrants crossing illegally in the first six months of this fiscal year than the entirety of
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:45.600]  FY17. And at the current pace, we are on track to encounter close to one million illegal aliens
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:52.000]  at our southern border this year. Our capacity is already severely restrained, but these increases
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:59.040]  will overwhelm the system entirely. If anyone is manufacturing facts concerning border security,
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.680]  it is the leftist train wreck known as the Democratic Party. All state that this is a
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.200]  manufactured crisis and a crisis that manufactured by the Trump administration. The numbers the
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.720]  Democrats choose to ignore are staggering. The Washington Times reported the number of families
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:20.800]  snared trying to sneak into the U.S., soared by 50 percent in one month alone, setting an
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:27.360]  all-time record with more than 36,000 family members apprehended. Homeland security officials
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.960]  recently announced it is difficult to ignore the preferential consideration, the illegal alien
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.800]  that murdered Molly Tibbets is receiving, or the Somali gangs turning the streets of Minneapolis,
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.400]  Minnesota into a war zone. According to this Minneapolis police report, between 20 and 30
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:49.600]  young men showed up in front of her house around 9.30 in the morning and the comments turned to
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.160]  threats. They were screaming at their house that they were going to kidnap me and we're going to
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.440]  rape you. In broad daylight and within full view of a busy stretch of East River Road,
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.520]  a group of seven young men struck totally at random. Two joggers out for a Sunday run
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.360]  were suddenly inviciously punched as they passed by. Police Lieutenant Mike Monsrud says the victims
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:18.000]  described the group as young Somali men. They demanded no money and said few words without
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.760]  talking to them. We really have no idea what the motivation behind these
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:27.040]  incidents were. According to the indictment, the 26 men and three women transported girls
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.960]  across state lines to engage in sex in exchange for money and drugs. Do you feel more comfortable
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.200]  living under American law or do you feel more comfortable living under Sharia law?
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.000]  Would you prefer to live in America or prefer to live in Somalia? For me, I think in Somalia.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.640]  Or that MS-13 is actively hunting off-duty New York police. As Fox News reported,
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:04:00.240]  Intel has been obtained that members of MS-13 are looking to hit NYPD police officers in order to
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:07.280]  gain street credibility. These MS-13 members are conducting reconnaissance of police officers'
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:14.240]  private residences. In fact, it's so bad that MS-13 has forced El Salvador and police to flee
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:19.360]  El Salvador. As the New Zealand Herald reported, they were given one of the most dangerous orders
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.760]  in policing. Take down MS-13. They were bankrolled by the United States and trained by FBI agents.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:31.280]  But members of the Salvadoran police have been killed by the dozens in each of the past three
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:37.440]  years. Now, a number of El Salvador's police officers are fleeing the gang. They were tasked
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:42.720]  with eliminating. The Washington Post has identified 15 officers in the process.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:50.480]  The report is at infowars.com from John Bowne, but you have to ask why Democrats are protecting
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:05:20.080]  MS-13 with sanctuary cities. You really have to ask why.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:25.520]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all ready
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:30.160]  and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this. It's available exclusively

[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:12.000]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today. And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:20.560]  All right. We are about to start taking your phone calls here on the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.400]  And we've got tons of calls already lined up. I'm going to do my best to take as many as I can
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:34.320]  in this hour. Dan Lyman joins me in the next hour from Europe Wars.com.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:39.120]  Owen Benjamin hosting the fourth hour today. But I'm not going to be able to get to all
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.320]  of your calls. I know that there's going to be some people that end up holding for a long time
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.240]  and they don't get in today. So I want to just apologize in advance. But I will let you know
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:54.720]  if you want to, it's a lot easier to get through on the war room, which runs from
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:59.280]  three to six p.m. Central at infowork.com slash show. Actually, I wonder if it is because we have
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:05.200]  a lot less lines. So but my point is if you can't get on today and you still want to call in and
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:12.480]  get your voice heard, um, I will be taking calls for most of the war room today from three to six
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:17.840]  p.m. Central at infowords.com slash show, which begins after the Alex Jones show, which of course
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:23.600]  always follows up the David night show every morning at eight a.m. At infowords.com slash
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.200]  show. Of course, you know, if you're David, you're not allowed to exist on YouTube or,
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.600]  you know, your show isn't allowed on Facebook or Twitter, you know, your band, you're the bad guy.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.560]  If you're Alex Jones, you just can't even exist on anything and anything with info wars, the
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:41.680]  company you built, that's not allowed to be promoted and, um, they banned the war room
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.800]  on all social media as well. And then me personally, I'm totally banned off Facebook and YouTube. I
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:52.480]  had a nice 12 hours spent on Facebook, uh, worse 12 hours of my life. So if you can't get in today,
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:56.960]  though, feel free to try again on the war room because I will be taking calls as well. And
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.120]  speaking of the war room, I'm going to go ahead and do a little cross promotion right now because
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:08.960]  we have a polo at infowords.com that I don't even know if Alex has ever talked about it,
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:15.040]  but it's a great polo and it's one of my favorite shirts from infowords.com because it features
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.920]  the info wars hexagon logo, which is kind of like undercover logo. If you will, it's like a fight
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:26.560]  club thing. You wouldn't know it unless you knew it. And so it's at infowords.com. But
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:33.440]  as a promotion for the war room, if you use coupon code war room at infowordsstore.com,
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:38.720]  when you get your info wars hexagon polo, you get $10 off. So doing a little cross promotion here
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:44.400]  and letting the Alex Jones audience know about a war room coupon code, but take advantage of that

[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:02.720]  right now. $50 off DNA force plus the elite of the elite supplements. I think we still have $50
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.560]  off the electropure breeze air filter. You know, I cleaned my air filter this weekend
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:14.880]  and I'm not gonna lie. I was shocked at how dirty the air in my house is now. My house always kind
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:21.600]  of has a scent to it because I have a tortoise. But the electropure breeze air filter makes it a lot
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.880]  better. But I was stunned because it has multiple layers of filter the electropure breeze does.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:33.600]  And the top filter is just for like dust and dandruff and stuff. And you just look at that every
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:40.800]  other month and you're just like, wow, that's floating around in my home. And you realize that
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:48.560]  the studies they came out with the average us home is as polluted as a major metropolitan city.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:53.600]  And a couple months within electropure breeze in your house, you'll see for yourself exactly what
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:10:01.120]  those studies are talking about. So I suggest you don't live breathing in polluted air in your
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:06.800]  home all day long, get the electropure breeze air filter at infowordsstore.com. It's $50 off right
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:13.680]  now. You cannot beat that deal. Now, the phone lines are already lit up. I'm going to take as many
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:20.880]  calls as I can in this hour while also peppering in some news asking you what do you think comes of
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:26.160]  the Mueller report because I do think now that they're probably he may turn it in this month. He
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:32.880]  really might turn it in this month, which makes me wonder why because the whole purpose of this
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:38.320]  thing was to just keep Donald Trump in the crosshairs and keep the media narrative going about
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:44.320]  Russian collusion. If he turns it in, it destroys the whole thing. But there has to be a twist.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:50.400]  There always is. And the Democrats already have their separate probes and investigations ready
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:56.080]  to go. So to me, that's the biggest indicator that Mueller's done because the Democrats are
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.720]  about to launch all their own stuff. I don't think they'd be doing that unless Mueller really was
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.720]  done and he was about to turn this report in. And so he got some scouts, nothing to do with
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:10.560]  Russian collusion, a bunch of BS. How does Roger Stone get arrested for obstruction of justice?
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.440]  There's no justice here. They're not seeking justice. They're seeking impeachment. They're
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.640]  seeking removing a president from office. That's what they're seeking. So to the callers, what do
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.680]  you think is the final outcome of this Mueller report? Is it about to come out? Will Mueller flip
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:31.520]  on Hillary and actually expose the real Russian collusion? Let's start with Elliot calling in
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:38.000]  from Arizona. Go ahead, Elliot. Hi, Ellen. Can you hear me? Loud and clear. Go ahead.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:44.880]  Oh, good. Okay. I don't have the best reception. Well, the main reason for my call, I've been
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:56.320]  trying to call for, gosh, maybe three weeks. And it's about info.com.org. Now, what I noticed
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:05.360]  very specifically was that I've been listening for about three years or so. And prior, like when
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:12.560]  I first started listening, the people were just trying to share information or talk about just
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:18.640]  the current topic or whatever. But what I did notice, especially after the last three months,
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:29.680]  and this is going to really affect you specifically, is I would say one out of every three or maybe
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:37.920]  four callers is going to be saying something about being active, talking and talking and talking
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:43.440]  but being active to be involved. And you know how you go to the city council meetings and things
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:52.560]  like that? Well, by far, the most effective thing that could be done is to slightly alter
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:13:02.880]  the info.com.org, I guess, chat site to actually unify people, support strictly for activists.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.760]  Well, that was the whole purpose, Elliot. And I'm glad that you called and raised this issue
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:11.920]  because that was actually the purpose. Now, I don't know if you want to talk about Mueller,
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.240]  so I'll give you a chance to comment on that if you want. But the original purpose,
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.640]  because when we first started in doing the censorship, I started the InfoWars Army,
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:28.160]  which was the purpose was to go out, engage in street activism. And so I started the InfoWars
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:34.560]  Army, we had InfoWarsArmy.com, but then all my InfoWars Army accounts got banned. And so as a
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:43.200]  result of that, I then kind of shifted the momentum of the InfoWars Army to InfoComs, where I could
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:48.400]  no longer really organize. They're not going to let me organize on social media. So I created InfoComs
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:55.600]  so that you, the audience could organize. So the goal of InfoWars Army was using social media,
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:01.760]  you can find other info warriors in your local areas in the state, you know, the
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.680]  municipality, whatever, the city that you live in. And then they erased all those social media
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:12.000]  accounts. So that's when I started InfoComs. So now people can just go on to InfoComs,
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:18.400]  make a post in there saying, oh, I'm in Atlanta, you know, I'm in Alabama, I'm in Florida,
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.080]  I'm in Washington, I'm over here, I'm over here. And then you can go there and you can find other
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.840]  info warriors. And yes, you can organize street activism, you can go out and hold signs, you can
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.040]  go out and organize, go to city council, bring a group of people with you, go protest at Planned
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.000]  Parenthood, you know, go do a live stream, have a cameraman and a guy with a mic. So that was
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.160]  the purpose of InfoComs. So InfoComs.org, I do want people to go there and organize.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.120]  Elliot, I got 60 seconds left here. Did you want to comment on Mueller?
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:52.160]  Sure, I'll make a quick comment, but it's about InfoComs.org. He is going to close it out exactly
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:15:00.160]  for what you're saying, that it's because they're going to pursue many other impeachment procedures,
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:06.960]  indictment, you know, that's all they have to stop. It's so just to continue with that.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:14.000]  But I really wanted to get back, I'm sorry, with the InfoComs that it's so important.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:21.360]  All it has to be done is organized a little bit better geographically, where, you know,
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.720]  they have the like the credit card payments and they show what the state and then you click
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:34.080]  Arizona, right? Or and to limit because you're getting people from New Hampshire,
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.280]  you're getting people from South Dakota, you're getting people from California.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:43.440]  Well, I understand what you're saying, Elliot, you know, and I mean, I can't do everything.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.880]  I mean, you know, like I guess I could like dedicate my life to organizing InfoComs too,
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.600]  but then I wouldn't be able to be on for six hours a day and be effective. So I get it,
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:16:01.680]  but you know, we can't do everything. We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:07.360]  flag. Do you know the official National American flag has never been manufactured for retail stores?
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:12.480]  The one that Americans fought and died for, the one symbol that represents our Constitution.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.920]  Now you can be a part of this great movement that's never been seen before.

[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.520]  still got another deep breath crystal source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine,
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.960]  the scientists that do that. It sold a lot that people want original X2. I was resigned the fact
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:30.720]  we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago. We now have X2 again and infowarstore.com.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.240]  So, hallelujah. It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same

[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:18.720]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:26.320]  All right, I'm taking your calls specifically on the Mueller report. Do you think it will come out
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:33.600]  this month? Amazon seems to think so. And what do you think will be the end result of it?
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:39.200]  But I do want to take this other caller off topic just because we were off topic last segment and
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:46.000]  there is a viral video that everybody's raving about. And again, when Cortez first kind of came
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.920]  up and I was doing my research into it, there's certain things that we just don't really go into
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:53.840]  here at info wars because it's like it's just it's better off to let other people do it. And so
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:59.760]  slowly but surely people are finding out who Cortez really is. And so the latest is viral
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.960]  YouTube video. Guys, see if you can find out how many views it has. And I guarantee you,
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:07.680]  YouTube is throttling these views. How many does it say guys? I can't see the full number there.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.800]  The screen's cut off. So apparently it only has 636,000 views. Yeah, that's bull crap.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:20.960]  This video has millions of views guaranteed. I mean, folks, trust me, everybody, everybody on the
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:25.920]  conservative side has seen this video now. I mean, in fact, because I have people that send
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:30.720]  me videos all the time, I'm not even kidding you. That video was probably sent to me more times than
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.280]  any other video and it only has half a million views. Bull crap. That's like them totally
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:39.200]  throttling the Alex Jones Joe Rogan podcast, which I think Rogan should sue over.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:46.400]  That video has millions of views. But anyway, Andrew from Florida wants to call in because
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:51.920]  this video is going viral. He wants to highlight what to me was the biggest revelation from this.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:58.000]  And that's essentially that Cortez filed a casting call and won in a casting call
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:04.320]  and then came up to win the election, which I have another kind of thread on that that I might get
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:11.120]  into. But Andrew in Florida, you're fired up about this. Go ahead. Yeah. And Cortez is being used by
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:17.920]  the Justice Democrats. So she was cast by who is also run by George. So it's funded by George Soros,
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:23.600]  but it's also run by that guy from the young Turks. I came and say it. Chunk. Chunk yogurt.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:28.880]  Yeah, I'll put your name up right on. Hold on, say Andrew. It's Chunk yogurt.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:36.720]  Chunk yogurt. I always hear his name. But anyway, but anyway, what I've been hearing,
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:42.240]  it's a real dangerous organization. And when you listen to Cortez, when she's on stage like this
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:46.800]  week in the South by Southwest, he sounds like a little intelligent. Yeah, because it's scripted
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:53.120]  out. But once she goes on Periscope, you notice she sounds like a dumb hyena. Because like I say,
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:59.120]  it's all scripted out. She's being a puppet by this group. The was it called again, the Justice
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:04.640]  Democrat. So, so here's what happened. So a bunch of people that were behind Bernie Sanders,
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:09.440]  the true socialist in America, Justice Democrats was one of them. And there was a couple other
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:16.240]  websites they ran, but it was all under the same umbrella of Soros money. And so once they realized
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:24.960]  they couldn't get Bernie over the top, they shifted all of the momentum they had to Cortez.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.960]  They gave her all the websites. They put her picture on all the websites. They transferred
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:35.600]  the URLs into her campaign and everything. And so this happened before anybody even heard of her.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.560]  This was all going on while they were taking the casting calls. And then they decided on Cortez
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:47.600]  before she even won. All of this was going on. Now let's actually go to a clip here. Hold with
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:52.320]  me, Andrew, of what Andrew is talking about. Here's Cortez at South by Southwest here in Austin
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:24:02.080]  saying that America is garbage. The thing that is really hard for people to sometimes see is that
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:11.520]  when we are on this path of a slow erosion and a slow, slow, slow, just like move away from what
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:16.800]  we've always been will be 100 miles. You know, you realize you won't even realize that you've
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:22.880]  drifted 100 miles. So when someone's talking about our core, it's like, oh, this is radical.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:30.080]  But this isn't radical. This is what we've always been. It's just that now we've strayed so far away
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:39.040]  from what has really made us powerful and just and good and equitable and productive. And so
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.040]  I think all of these things sound radical compared to where we are. But where we are
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:53.600]  is not a good thing. And this idea of like 10% better from garbage, it shouldn't be what we
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:59.760]  settle for. It's like this like, it feels like. Get this bimbo off. I can hold on. I got another
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:08.480]  clip I want to play. But think about it. Capitalism in the West has created the greatest humanitarian
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:19.040]  aid resource in world history. And that's America. That's a fact. But here she is again now bashing
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:28.480]  capitalism. Capitalism isn't to me is it's an ideology of capital. It puts capital the most
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:37.280]  important thing is the concentration of capital. And it means that we seek is genuinely hurts
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:44.240]  profit and the accumulation of money above all else. And we pause it pause it real quick like
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.040]  because I want to play these clips for the audience to hear it. But I almost feel like I'm
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.520]  assaulting you with this. In fact, I feel too guilty. I can't play the clip. I can't play the
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:57.920]  clip. I'm assaulting you. This is too stupid. So anyway, but Andrew, here's where I think I
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:04.720]  disagree with everybody commenting on this video. I don't think there really is that much control
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:09.760]  over her to be honest with you. I mean, yeah, she gets talking points. But you got to understand
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:15.040]  there's other voices in her ear too. And at a certain level, they just kind of want her to be
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:20.720]  free range because she is so stupid. And they kind of want that like that's what's hip. That's
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:26.880]  what's in like ugly art, ugly culture. You know, like that's that's kind of what's in Andrew. So
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.560]  but but what is your final analysis and what's got you so fired up about it?
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:38.400]  Well, the thing that really upsets me is that if America is so horrible, then why
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.400]  people are crossing the border to come here? And let me tell you something,
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:48.560]  my great-grandparents escaped Italy because, you know, of course, Italy was fascist.
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:54.400]  And let me tell you something, they only came here for one reason and was freedom and also
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.400]  capitalism. And that's why to be part of an American dream. So Cortes, you know what?
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:03.040]  She really upsets me at this point when after I saw this video.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:10.320]  Well, and you got to you got to wonder here too, Andrew, thank you so much for raising this topic
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:18.640]  today. Think about this. The claim, I mean, the story goes Cortes basically pulled off this massive
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.760]  upset. I've already forgotten the guy's name. Incumbent one one multiple elections usually
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:30.240]  wins by a very good margin. And Cortes comes out of nowhere and defeats him. Now the story goes,
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.760]  she ran a grassroots campaign literally boots on the ground, right? Well, if that's true,
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:42.160]  why isn't everyone else doing that? Have you ever asked yourself that? If here is Cortes,
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:48.960]  revolutionizes American politics by going boots on the ground, going old school, nobody ever heard
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:56.480]  of her. Why is it nobody else is doing it? Seriously, politicians are so desperate to get
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:01.280]  an office, folks. Most of them don't even have any morals or foundations. They'll say whatever
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.480]  the hell they think is going to get them the most votes. They'll do whatever the hell they think
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:10.480]  is going to get them the most votes. So why wouldn't they all be going in the Cortes direction,
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:18.480]  boots on the ground, door to door, grassroots? Why isn't everybody doing it? Or maybe that's not
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:28.400]  how Cortes won. Makes you wonder, makes you wonder if Cortes really won by going door to door,
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.160]  why isn't everyone else trying to do it? Why isn't everybody else repeating that?
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  Because she had zero political experience. She has zero political or economic knowledge other than,
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.960]  you know, 450 times three for three Vegas bombs. So how did she get an office? And if it was door
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:54.480]  to door, why isn't every other Democrat doing it? Really makes you wonder, doesn't it? Really makes you
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:01.520]  wonder. The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:07.600]  world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:14.960]  that World Wars One and Two left England broken. Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:20.480]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War One,

[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:07.360]  dumps with Jack Dorsey. I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures. I'm not sitting here,
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.800]  you know, selling you late term abortion and all the great it is. I just go out and say,
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.920]  what is the top heart pill? What is the top tumor? It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:20.240]  and what's the best lab in the country? Okay, they're the highest rate. I'm like, you're only 50%
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:24.640]  curcuminoid? Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:30.240]  And I'm like, what's the highest you could do? A month later, 90, 95%. No one's ever done. I said,
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.800]  how much does that cost for a bottle that costs $10? No one's ever done that, sir. The average
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:40.400]  competitor is 3% to 5%. The top brand is 50%. I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:44.320]  I mean, you understand, like, that's like our information is explosive, our fish oil. I go out
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:49.920]  and I get the cleanest, the best. My children take it. You think I'm going to give you fish oil that
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:54.000]  isn't the very damn best on my soul? You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.640]  devil worshipers? Never in foreshore.com. Our grandparents, our great grandparents,
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.840]  knew that they can't food. During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.

[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:19.200]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:33.360]  And now your host, Owen Troyer. The court has decided the documents from the Epstein case
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:42.080]  to be released. Mike Cernovich has just tweeted that out. Ooh, Bob Mueller. What does that mean
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:51.040]  for Bob Mueller? What does that mean for Alexander Acosta of the Trump administration? Who else took
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:59.360]  flights to Petafile Island? Bill Clinton. Lots of times. Ditched Secret Service even.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:07.040]  Wow, Bill. That's interesting, Bill. So that's developing right now.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:16.560]  But we're taking your calls on the Mueller probe, which it looks like is going to be concluded before
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:29.360]  the end of the month. And so what does this mean? And will Mueller, in his report, indict Hillary
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:35.680]  Clinton for colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election? Somehow I doubt it.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:39.920]  But let's go to John and Fort Worth. Go ahead, John. You're on the Alex Jones show.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:48.320]  Yeah, I think something needs to be done about all the collusion that they didn't find
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.000]  and all the evidence they did find against the Democratic Party.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:35:01.440]  Well, and it really just almost perfectly shows the American people how politicized it all became.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:06.880]  I mean, you know, it's a common joke. Like, you know, the FBI can indict a ham sandwich. Well,
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:12.560]  here it is. I mean, here they are indicting ham sandwich. I mean, this is the corrupt, dirty FBI
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:19.280]  that we always knew it was that will set anyone up just to destroy them. Well, yeah, yeah. And
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:26.560]  the CIA had a little bit to do with it. But you know, I'm sure it'll all come out. But I want to
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:33.040]  see what is going to happen. When are they going to put them through the ringer like they have put
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:42.480]  President Trump? Well, somehow I feel like that's up to the president. And he makes all indications
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:47.920]  on Twitter that he knows this is all going on and something needs to be done. But as far as
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:55.120]  actual real world results, we've got nothing. Well, that's that's what I'm saying. You know,
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:01.360]  when he's showing the American people, if they would just open up their eyes and listen and do
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:08.480]  their own investigations, you know, you could it's easy for an individual to get on the internet
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:15.520]  and find facts, actual facts. Well, actually, sadly, John, it's a lot harder these days. But
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.800]  you know, yes, you can inform yourself. Honestly, the problem now is
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:27.120]  is the ability to really stay informed and inform yourself is almost like a 24 hour window.
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:34.080]  Because once once information and stuff kind of gets into the database of the internet
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:40.560]  and all these SEOs like Google and everything. After 24 hours, they basically rig the whole
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:45.840]  algorithm. And you and you could you could be reading a story yesterday on on on any website,
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:49.840]  you plug in that exact headline on Google that you searched the day before and you will never
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:56.560]  find it again. Right, right. And yeah, that has happened to me more than once. And something
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:05.120]  needs to be done, you know, actually done about that. But it seems like we, you know, I say we
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:12.240]  I guess the patriots of the nation is it's getting harder and harder, you know, because you have
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:18.960]  these big money people, Google, Amazon, you know, you deal with it more, you see it more.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:25.520]  And often than we do here in Fort Worth, but it's it's it's well, there's no doubt. I mean,
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:30.560]  it look, people say, oh, hey, what's the word? Well, Google it, you know, Google it. Yeah,
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:37.200]  Google it. Yeah, oh, okay. Well, a lot of things you can't Google it. And and I'm telling you,
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:42.480]  I mean, I don't know how many people are out there like me. But I know for a fact,
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.960]  I'll Google something and I'll find the story I'm looking for. And then the next day, I'll
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:53.360]  Google the exact same thing and I can't find Jack. And that's, you know, that's just the truth. I
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.280]  mean, I don't know what Google is doing. But that's just what people are experiencing. Thanks
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:02.720]  for the call, John. Let's go to Michael calling in from Los Angeles. Go ahead, Michael. Hey,
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:09.120]  infowarstore.com infowarstore.com. I just would like to say this right here has been the whole
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:15.360]  curriculum for at least the last I go to a kind of leftist liberal lean school right here in
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:22.160]  Santa Monica area. And this has been their whole curriculum in my journalism class,
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:28.800]  and even my business class, they'll get real political and start polarizing the class
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:35.440]  to thinking this is that this is the way you do independent research. This is the way you're
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:42.080]  you show your bias and and it's total hard wash at the end of the day. I don't think anything's
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:49.680]  going to come out of this illusion where they use to address this is a mass mental illness
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:58.320]  that's going on right here. And sooner or later, if the law comes to scale, if appropriate law comes
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:05.920]  to scale, then Roger Stone will be reimbursed for his compensation for all the things that
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:13.920]  they've done for him. Trump's going to even be more have more of an infrastructure than what's
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:17.440]  going on right now. Well, let's hope. But I mean, look at this, Roger Stone, I'm telling you, my
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:21.680]  blood was boiling, reading this political story. And I'm trying not to get angry today, but
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.600]  they're trying to take Roger Stone down and they've got an Obama judge, and they're trying to put
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:32.320]  Roger Stone in jail for obstruction of justice, folks, obstruction of justice. They're looking
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:37.920]  for Russian collusion in the 2016 election. It was all Hillary Clinton. They're the ones obstructing
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:43.680]  justice. In fact, it's beyond obstructing justice. They're bastardizing justice. They're destroying
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.400]  justice. And then they're going to sit here and point the finger at Roger Stone. But but look
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:54.000]  at some of this mental illness that Michael is talking about. This is a tweet from Slate Magazine
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:01.200]  looking for a book to help resist Trump. Try this gay immigrant Muslim furry romance novel.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:09.440]  That's a real tweet. That's a real thing. Look at this from Cher Republic. I folks, I'm sorry
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:15.040]  that I'm assaulting your IQ with this is a tweet from Cher Republicans believe they've got God
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:21.360]  given right to dictate what we do with our bodies. Women must make laws to control men's bodies,
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:28.000]  no Viagra, Rogaine or testosterone. All men must be circumcised and show papers or penises to
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.160]  or penis to prove it. Massage parlors parlors punishable by death. Men must take the pill.
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:41.600]  I mean, that's so that the the lunacy of that I don't even know where to begin. And then
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:50.960]  not to be outdone is Alyssa Milano. I'm trans. I'm a person of color. I'm an immigrant. I'm a
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:41:02.160]  lesbian. I'm a gay man. I'm the disabled. I'm everything. And so are you. But an unborn baby
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:09.840]  isn't even human. So how about this bus aid snatches mag had off 14 year old student? I mean,
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:16.800]  these people bully teenagers, Michael. Yeah, this is all built off the fraud on this. Once you get
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:23.920]  the evidence from lies. You know, I don't know how I don't know how to put it, man. The the
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:30.160]  fake will crumble the fake. It's biblical. All this is biblical. And if you if you listeners,
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:34.320]  I don't know how much of them are really on the front lines, they say they are. But if they're
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.800]  fighting the good fight, if they're in God standards, you're going to come out on top.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:44.960]  This world is falling world. But you know, we're God is going to protect his children
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:49.840]  out of faith, you know, because by grace, we're saved. It's not within ourselves. But through
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:55.440]  the gift of God, let no man boast. Amen. Thank you. Thank you for calling, Michael. We're going to
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:59.440]  take more of your phone calls on the other side of this break. Seriously,
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.920]  I'm trying not to get angry today, because I was yelling on the air yesterday, but it's just like.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:17.120]  Do you understand the deep? You know what that we're in when we have a total rogue prosecutor
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:21.520]  that that is just doing whatever the hell he wants to destroying whoever's life he wants.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:27.440]  And and half the country is embracing it. But it's not even that half the country is so
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:35.200]  so brainwashed and dumbed down that they don't even know what's going on.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.600]  Literally, they have no idea. So I mean, what are we going to do?
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:46.240]  I mean, 63 million Americans saved America by voting for Donald Trump. But
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:43:03.920]  well, he better act fast because 2020 is not guaranteed. We'll be right back.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:22.320]  And then it's going to be on an 18 wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies.

[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:23.040]  Live from the infowarst.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:32.960]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:42.640]  I'm serious folks. I'm really maintaining myself today, but I'm like nearing heart attack levels
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:46.080]  when I start thinking about this stuff and I was kind of saying like I don't know how Alex has
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:50.560]  had a heart attack folks. I mean this and I don't know if it's the stress of covering this news
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:55.360]  every day. I mean with David Knight, I mean thank God he's healthier than ever, but it's just like
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:01.600]  when you realize how corrupt it all is and how they're trying to destroy the greatest system
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:09.440]  that we know of on earth. These people virtually signal all day long acting like there's some
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:16.080]  sort of humanitarians. Capitalism in the West has created the greatest humanitarian aid resource
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:23.520]  in world history and it's the United States of America. And it's not even just some dumb
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:28.240]  bimbo Cortez trying to promote socialism or some old hag Bernie Sanders who goes and does his
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:36.400]  honeymoon in Russia with his shirt off and sings kumbaya with the communists. It's Bob Mueller,
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:43.200]  man. It's the Democrats that lie all day long. It's Democrats that campaign on border security
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:49.840]  and then tell you having a border's racist. So I'm I'm going to go back out to the calls. It's
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:56.320]  just like it's just out of control. It's not it's not even a left or right thing. It's a corrupt
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:01.680]  U.S. government thing and it's amazing before Trump. Most Americans would have said the FBI,
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:07.360]  CIA. They're all corrupt, man. Oh, but now they're investigating Trump. Now we trust them. Yes.
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:17.120]  Give me a break. So let's go back out to the phone lines. Let's go to Terrence in Virginia.
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:24.640]  Go ahead, Terrence. Hey, Owen. I don't know if that's a good feeling or not, but I don't think
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:31.760]  this is over because you know, you know, you know, you know, think of something to do like like a
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:37.600]  couple of weeks before the newer releases, there are reports, you know, they'll do a
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:46.640]  A, they'll tell us for a false flag for some place, someone or B, there, newer, newer is
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:53.040]  going to be. But see, but that's it. But that's the thing, Terrence. The whole thing is a false
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:58.800]  flag. The Russian collusion probe is a false flag. The Jussie Smollett was a false flag.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.360]  Covington Catholic was a false flag. Judge Kavanaugh was a false flag. They've engaged in
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:08.560]  false flag after false flag after false flag after false flag. So none of it's working because it's
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:14.720]  all false flag. And America is just, they get it now. They don't trust the media.
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:18.880]  You know, and I need to do a little more research into this and I'm going to,
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:22.160]  but I'm going to do the political research into this.
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:30.560]  I mean, there's a chance, if there's a fair election, Donald Trump could almost set a record for the
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:37.120]  most voter turnout for a presidential election. Now, he needs to not be attacking Ann Coulter,
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:44.400]  and he needs to definitely come through on some more promises. But if he, if he drops any hammer
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:49.760]  whatsoever on the real corruption in government that we know happened with Hillary Clinton,
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:54.800]  100 million Americans will turn out to vote for Donald Trump. All he has to do is do it.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:00.000]  Terrence, thanks for the call. Let's go to John in Wisconsin. Go ahead, John.
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:08.160]  I think this whole Miller probe is a sham, just so they can get to where they're at,
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:14.320]  you know, the party. The thing is, is that after 2020, if Trump loses,
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:19.680]  there's still going to go after him for decades, just to prove a point.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:27.840]  Well, that's an interesting thought. Some people theorize, including on the left, that if they go
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:34.000]  after Don Jr. or Eric or anyone in his family, that that'll kind of be the straw that broke the
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:39.760]  camel's back and Trump will move against them with whoever he has as allies in the Justice
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:46.080]  Department. But I mean, Trump, he has all the tools. He could build a wall tomorrow.
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:54.240]  He could throw Hillary in jail tomorrow. I mean, you know, so they look, I support Trump. He's
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:52:00.240]  done a great job. I wish he would do more. He's got some time left. I mean, he could solidify
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:08.480]  himself as like, I mean, just beyond an American legend, like a world legend, folks. I mean,
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:16.080]  look, the, the, just like we've had the most humanitarian aid come out of the West in America,
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:21.440]  you could also say we've had the most corruption. So yeah, we all want to do something about that.
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:27.600]  That doesn't mean we kill the golden goose. It means we get the noose off the golden goose's neck.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:34.800]  And Mueller represents that. Clinton represents that. McCabe represents that. Comey represents
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:42.080]  that. And we know it. And Trump knows it. So cut the damn news, Trump. Get these people off our
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:48.640]  neck. Sorry, John, go ahead. Well, you know, the thing is, is that Lenin's words are true and
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:54.320]  we're living it right now. When he said you give me a child for four years and I would
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:58.880]  plant a seed that can't be killed. Yeah. Hitler said, give me the youth of the nation. I'll rule
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:03.280]  that nation in seven years. Well, yeah, that's why they have all the college campuses, you know,
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:07.600]  teaching and promoting socialism. That's why they now teach your, you know, young child that
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:14.080]  I guess a woman with a dingaling waving it in front of your face is, is normal.
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:18.560]  And they, you know, they do the drag queen story hours at your local library. And that's all fine.
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.600]  So, so yeah, that's what that's what we want. Then that's what we'll get. I don't want it.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:29.200]  Thanks for the call, John. Let's go to Brandon in North Carolina. Go ahead, Brandon.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:34.400]  Yes, sir. How are you? Good, Brandon. Thanks for calling. Yeah, go ahead.
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:39.760]  Thank you. All right. As far as Mueller goes, I think people are going to be really surprised
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:44.080]  when he drops his report because it's going to obviously, as you said, it's not going to drop
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:48.320]  anything on Trump. Trump hasn't done anything. You and I both know that. I think most of the
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:55.200]  American people know that. What the big turnaround on this is, I think Mueller's been working behind
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:59.760]  the scenes throughout the entire time. You know, that's quite a pipe dream, Brandon,
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:04.160]  and all the evidence would, would be totally opposite of that, you know.
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:10.480]  Well, I've seen other evidence. I don't know if you follow Q. A lot of people think it's fake.
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:16.880]  I cannot disprove it. I tried just because I thought that's not a good way to approach anything.
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.320]  I mean, you can't disprove the moon is, you know, made out of cheese.
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:29.760]  So is the moon made out of cheese? No, it's not. Now look, I want to believe Q is real. And I totally
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:34.720]  get it. And I know what you're talking about, but the results have not been there. And so that's
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:40.080]  why I can't, that's why I can't go with the Q theory. But something has to be going on because
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:45.600]  it doesn't add up. Well, I agree. And here's, here's my thought on that. Okay. This is something
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:50.640]  remember Trump said in the very beginning of this whole thing that the storm has just come. Okay.
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:56.160]  With that being said, he, this is something that has to take time. He can't just drop this on the
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:00.560]  American people because most of these people walking around there are blind. Oh, and absolutely.
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:05.360]  Intellectually, I totally understand that. No doubt. But it's almost a Justin's,
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:09.600]  a justice be done. May the heavens fall type of situation. It's that dire. And again,
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:14.000]  there's been other stuff. Look, I follow Q. If for nothing else to just stay informed on it,
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  I don't report on it because anybody could be Q. Q could be easily co-opted. In fact,
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.080]  I believe it has. If Q was ever real, it's been co-opted zero doubt. But there's weird things
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:28.640]  out there. Like, who knows? I mean, John Kasich was on TV saying that they killed or they put
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:33.280]  McCain to death. And that was a Q theory. Now, I don't know if that's John Kasich just having a
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:37.440]  slip up or if he's letting you know that he follows Q or maybe that really happened. I mean,
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:41.360]  I don't know. I wish Q was right. I just haven't seen the results, Brandon.
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:48.000]  It was not just one person. Okay. These are high, high military officials that you probably don't
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.400]  even know their names. And it's roughly about 10 people. Well, and now I've got the guy that was,
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:59.520]  you know, following Q at Info Wars, Jerry Corsi, someone I thought was a friend,
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:03.680]  and now they're suing me. So it's like, what the hell, man?
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:09.600]  I think Corsi is turned. Now, Stone, which by the way, Stone, I'm all for you, buddy.
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:13.520]  I know you haven't done anything. As far as I've seen so far, you're innocent,
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:17.520]  and you're going to come out on top of this. I'm almost a hundred percent sure.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:20.720]  And you know, I got to say something here too, Brandon, and thank you for the call.
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:26.480]  Working with Alex Jones for three years now, working with Roger Stone for almost two years now,
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:30.080]  I've learned something about them. And there's been other men like this in my life where
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:37.040]  just there's some weird mysticism where it's like everything they tell you is real.
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:42.880]  And even in moments where you're like, okay, and then in just down the road in the future,
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:47.280]  it's like, oh my gosh. And I remember, I mean, again, like Larry claiming,
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:50.480]  I used to have Larry claiming as a guest. I never thought negatively. In fact,
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:55.040]  I was even sticking up for Larry. And then one day, Roger pulled me aside and he was like,
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:59.200]  look, you know, I'm not trying to talk down on Larry or anything here, but you know, just,
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:04.960]  just be careful and turns out now Larry's trying to sue me. And it's like, well, what the hell,
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:10.400]  man? I thought we were all in this together. So I don't know what the hell the deal is.
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:16.080]  Okay, you know, I've just been doing politics politics and commentary on it here for about five
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:25.680]  plus years. So it's like, all I see is an innocent man, Roger Stone, being targeted for prison,
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.360]  simply because he supports President Trump. And they say, Oh, obstruction of justice.
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:35.360]  The Russian collusion probe folks. Yeah, Bob Mueller is really going after justice, isn't he?
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:41.600]  That's clearly what this is about. And they found so much Russian collusion, right? I mean, we got
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:47.360]  it all. So I don't know. I mean, we'll find out about Q, I guess. I've been doing a lot of research
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:54.080]  into Google and YouTube censorship. And I've noticed that there's one type of video
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:58:02.000]  that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed. And that's the videos where you
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:08.720]  saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:14.640]  get so butt hurt when Trump won. They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:20.880]  remember what political action did. And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:26.400]  to shut in force down. This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech,
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:32.480]  about taking your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war. So again, I want to thank you
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:36.080]  for what you've done. But I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos,

[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:22.160]  We're hearing your thoughts on the Mueller probe. Rumor is it's coming out this month. Amazon seems
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:28.400]  to think so. At least they want to profit off those rumors. So will Robert Mueller actually
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:35.280]  turn in Hillary Clinton for Russian collusion? Let's go to Joe now in Indiana. Go ahead Joe.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:46.960]  Hello. Hi. Yeah, my theory is, first of all, Obama bin Laden supposedly in Africa is setting up
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:56.560]  basketball teams and the Clintons have a larger state in New Zealand. Neither country has expedition
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:02.080]  with the U.S. and the Mueller probe hits the Clintons and Obama bin Laden are going to
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:08.960]  stuff lots of little hiding holes. Yeah, I've heard those theories before and some people
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:12.480]  believe that Hillary Clinton and others actually have an ankle bracelet on so they can't leave
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:16.560]  the country or they're at least being monitored. Those are some of the Q theories out there.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:24.640]  Well, I don't even know what Q is, but as far as ankle bracelet, those things,
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:32.240]  you know, illegal aliens pop those off every day. I want to give a positive shout out to
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:40.000]  him for words though. I have Parkinson's and it's a supplement to my description medication.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.600]  I've been taking brain force plus and my neurologist says it's doing wonders for me.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.640]  Well, I'm so glad to hear that, Joe. Thank you so much for that. And, you know, we
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:58.400]  get a lot of great reviews about brain force plus and DNA force plus. You know, we're not allowed
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:02.240]  to say some third, you know, certain things, but when we have testimonies like yourself,
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:06.720]  we really appreciate that, Joe. And you can read the testimonies and info or store.com as well.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:12.080]  So I'm so glad to hear that for you, Joe. And Indiana, the brain force plus has had such a
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:18.080]  positive impact on your life. Thank you so much for the call. Let's go to Dave in Vermont. Go ahead,
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:24.960]  Dave. Good. Hey, I want to give you a little plug about the bodies. About eight months ago,
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:30.880]  I was shot in the left leg and went through the upper thigh and the entry wound and exit wound
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.480]  showed very, very little inflammation. All the medical technicians and everything were very
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:42.160]  amazed at how quickly it was healing and there was very little blood loss. So I know the inflammation
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:49.120]  properties of that work. Well, you can go read it's 98% five star reviews on bodies. I mean,
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:57.680]  the product is just absolute gold. Oh, it works. I know that. And on the mule part, I think that
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:03.520]  because the demon crats were so rabid to remove Trump even before he was in office and was showing
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:10.240]  that this is all a virus, that the Democratic party should be liable for the whole complete
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:17.040]  bill of Mueller and not the taxpayers. And the other thing I was wondering about Owen is the
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:23.840]  Patriot law still in effect, the Patriot Act. And if so, maybe the Patriots are to start heating
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:28.800]  up the tire pot and gathering the feathers and making a march to Washington. Well, President
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:32.880]  Trump, I'm not saying they're getting ready to march to Washington to tar and feather anybody,
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:40.080]  but President Trump said he wants the biggest Fourth of July celebration ever in DC this year.
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:45.200]  And he said that after here at Info Wars, we talked about how that's what we need to do is
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:49.600]  organize a million people just pick a date and go to DC. Next day, Trump announced that I'm not
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:56.000]  saying there's any connection there. But that's, I think one thing to do. But but but but get back
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:07.680]  to your statement. Imagine you're a imagine you're a accountant. And you've been running,
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:12.000]  you've been doing the books for this company for a long, long time, you know, a trillion dollar
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:19.520]  company, and you've been cooking those books forever. And all of a sudden, a new account
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:25.440]  is coming in here. And you got to hand over the books. And you know, all the proof of your money
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:31.840]  laundering, all the proof of your slush funds and shell accounts, it's all about to be in the
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:38.160]  hands of this new accountant. And so yeah, you're panicked. You don't want that accountant in there.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:42.240]  You'll lie about that account. You'll do anything to keep that accountant away from getting those
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:46.800]  books that you've been cooking for years. And the Democrats are the easy target right now,
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:50.800]  because they're clearly deranged and the ones that are more corrupt. But it's been the Republicans
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:56.320]  too, folks. And so but that's why they're all panicked. I've got some really good news, though.
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:05.200]  X2 is back. The original X2 deep breath crystal pure atomic iodine, what you want in four store

[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:19.280]  source. But I thought add the other two types of iodine, the scientists that do that. It's sold
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:24.960]  a lot that people want original X2. I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:30.240]  about a month ago. We now have X2 again and in four store dot com. So hallelujah. It's been
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:36.240]  sold out for about almost three months. But we have now had the same company, the original X2,
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:43.440]  develop it again. And we were able to do the exact same formula. We want to preorder X2,

[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:17.760]  mountains so they don't really need to be built too many walls. But tough to get into Switzerland.
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:23.360]  The UK supermarket to stop selling knives amidstabbing epidemic. My goodness. So
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:30.000]  Dan Lyman joins us now. Oh, and you know he also Dan were you on lead guitar or rhythm guitar for
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:35.920]  the halos? Singer and lead singer and rhythm guitar. Yeah, singer and rhythm guitar. So also
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:39.440]  we're going to talk about some stuff I was talking about yesterday with the basis from filter in the
[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:45.280]  music industry. But first, Dan, give us updates on the latest happening in Europe. What's on the
[02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:50.400]  what's on your radar? What's on the top of your list right now? Sure. Yeah, I mean, we just had
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:56.240]  week 17 of the yellow vest protests. They are still ongoing in France. And from what I can tell,
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:01.120]  I haven't been to one in a few weeks now, but they seem to be still going strong. Still tens of
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:06.720]  thousands of people out in the streets protesting against Macron. He has managed to hang in there,
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:11.280]  which I think is incredible. Now there were four months into these protests. But the media,
[02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:16.240]  as they have done since pretty much since week two is downplaying the entire thing saying that
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:21.600]  it's losing steam. And maybe that's true. I mean, much time people have to protest after four months
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:26.640]  of doing it. But from what I've seen, the things are still going pretty strong. And the response
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:32.480]  from the police is still as brutal as ever. So I was watching this incredible video the other day.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:36.800]  I wasn't sure who posted it, but it was somebody that was following one of these volunteer medics
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:41.120]  in the streets, because that's how a lot of these people are being treated once they've been shot
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:46.400]  with flash balls or the stun grenades. Or if they've experienced any sort of injury, there are a
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:52.320]  lot of volunteer medics out in the streets that are working to at least administer on the spot
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:57.440]  first aid. And just watching the harrowing footage reminded me of being on the ground there, but
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:02.160]  also maybe realizing these people have been doing this weekend and week out. And I do admire their
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:08.880]  courage. Well, and I've been seeing just the images on Twitter more than anything of people in the
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:13.200]  hospital after they get hit with some of these things after they get brutalized by the cops.
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:18.000]  I mean, it's really a sad thing to see this in France. And not that I want to digress to another
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  topic, but it's amazing how Justin Trudeau, who has just fallen off the cliff as far as
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.200]  popularity is concerned, I mean, like a zero. And then you have Macron here, totally unpopular
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:34.080]  in France. Anybody could have seen this coming. The police are brutalizing the French people
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:39.520]  now just for protesting in the streets. So I mean, I think that people are starting to see how
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:44.800]  these these leaders, they're not there to lead them. They don't really care about the people.
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:50.080]  They're there as a as a as a puppet for somebody else. I mean, otherwise, I feel like Macron would
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:53.840]  have stepped down by now. I mean, four months of this, you'd say, Okay, the people don't want me
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:58.320]  anymore. I've caused this distress. The people of France deserve something to come of this. I'm
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.400]  going to step down. Somebody else can solve this problem. It's obviously not going to be me. But no,
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:07.120]  no, you really don't hear anything from Macron or Trudeau. They just disappear into the shadows.
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:12.560]  Right. And these guys are just shockingly unpopular in their countries in general,
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:17.920]  no matter how much they're propped up by the by the fake media. So you have like just the
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:22.560]  international media propping up someone like Macron and his his popularity rating, I think
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:27.040]  it's below 20 at this point. I haven't seen they haven't probably haven't taken too many polls lately,
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:31.040]  because they don't want to know. But and then you contrast that against the President Trump,
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:36.000]  who is just an all out blitz from the international media against him and is still managing to hold,
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.480]  you know, above 40%, depending on what poll you're looking at, close to 50 of Rasmussen.
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:45.120]  And so, yeah, you know, I do think it's interesting that some of these guys are so unpopular,
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:49.680]  and yet they're still hanging in there, which leads me to believe we're kind of like this new
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:55.920]  phase, if I had to guess, where the globalists have installed these young, these young men,
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:11:01.760]  in many cases, to lead certain key countries. And I don't think they were counting on this
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:06.640]  backlash, or if they were, they were hoping these guys could weather the storm, which they have so
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:12.160]  far. And so they're not going anywhere, which I think is very interesting. You do see Merkel seems
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:16.960]  to be on her way out the door, but they do have someone that looks like basically a clone that
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:21.760]  looks maybe 30 years younger about to replace her. So my thought is that the globalists have put the
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:25.840]  people in that they want in some of these countries, and they're just not going to let them be
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:30.240]  removed, which so that presents an interesting challenge for the people that live in these
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:34.800]  countries. Well, and I would almost say, I don't think that Trudeau and Macron have weathered the
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:39.520]  storm. I think they've just gone into the storm shelter and barricaded the doors. And it's just
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:45.360]  like, Katie bar the door, we're not even going to come out. And so to me, it shows how you've got
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:49.920]  President Trump, let's recall, you know, the entire establishment was against him, the media,
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:55.120]  both political parties. He's the most highest approved politician right now, like the most
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:12:01.520]  highly, highly approved president in modern history. And then you have, you know, Trudeau
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:06.240]  and Macron, who were totally pushed by the establishment, like endeared by the media,
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:11.680]  and their popularity continues to sink. So we really have reached, I think, the threshold here,
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:17.040]  Dan, where not just in America, but just all over the world, people are starting to see the
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:21.360]  media for what it really is agenda driven, and they're just totally rebuking it.
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:25.600]  Right. And that I think is one of the most important things of the Trump candidacy and the
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.400]  presidency. I do have my issues with where the way things are going right now. However,
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:34.960]  I don't put all the blame on him. He's only one man. But I think it's so important the way that he
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:41.520]  has illuminated the way that the media works and the fake news. I was just watching a report
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:46.640]  during when things were really heated between India and Pakistan. And it kind of turned out
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:51.280]  and it kind of turned out that Pakistan was putting out a lot of propaganda, you know, saying
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:56.800]  they had taken down a jet and here was the pilot and that did happen in some cases. But one of
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:02.880]  the videos was discovered by Indian media to be an old footage. And the Indian guy, he was obviously
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:08.960]  reporting in an Indian, his local language. And but he kept saying fake news, fake news. So it's
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:13.200]  like, you know, the Trump phenomena has spread worldwide, whether people want to admit to that
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:18.000]  or not. And people are seeing through the fake news and the fake media across the world.
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:25.120]  So overall, though, because we see Theresa May in big trouble, and she's not delivering on Brexit,
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:31.920]  she continues to kind of just try to toe the party line and keep everyone happy, if you will.
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:38.720]  But no Brexit yet, even though they voted for it, Merkel's ratings down, Macron's ratings are down.
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:46.720]  And so this whole globalist wave that's been exposed now is kind of just being totally rejected.
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:52.400]  And so what is the future of the EU? What is the future of the Brexit? What is the future of the
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.920]  Yellow Jacket protests? I mean, just where we stand now, Dan Lyman from Europe Wars, where do you
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:05.360]  think it all goes from here? Is the EU strong or is it falling apart? I don't think the EU is strong
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:10.400]  at all. I do see certain alliances that are tightening, let's say, between Germany and France,
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:15.440]  for instance. And I think we're watching, it's kind of interesting with the way that the news
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:20.000]  cycle is now and the way that we're all plugged into this 24-hour news cycle that a lot of people
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.200]  just didn't have access to. It didn't work that way not too long ago. But I think we're watching
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:31.200]  in real time as this juggernaut, the EU, is coming apart at the seams, probably could have watched
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:35.840]  the same thing in the USSR years ago if the internet was around at that time and the press
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:40.640]  was free to report on it. So it's interesting that we get to experience this and it feels like,
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:44.400]  well, we continue to predict that the EU is going to come apart and we look at these same players,
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:47.680]  you know, Hungary and Poland are splitting off and doing their own thing in many ways.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.680]  But in reality, it's only been a couple of years with this kind of this populist revolution with
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:58.560]  the start of Brexit, I would say, really kick things off. And now we've really seen since 2015
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:02.480]  which countries are going to defend national sovereignty, which are going to keep the migrants
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:07.680]  out. And that's really the issues now at this point. The lines are being drawn along new political
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:13.440]  axes. As the Hungarian Prime Minister actually said the other day, Orban said that it's no longer
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:18.880]  left-right issues in Europe as much as it is who is going to defend against migration and who is
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:22.720]  prepared to just flood their own countries with these people so that the new lines are being
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:27.840]  drawn in Europe. I don't see the EU surviving much longer. And they have to come out and show
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:34.480]  their hand too, which is we have to govern you. You're a stupid human. You're low-level scum.
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:39.840]  And so we have to run your life. And so they warn against the rise of populism. Well, what is
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:45.200]  populism? Populism is just what the people want. Oh, don't you get it? You are stupid people. You
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:51.520]  don't get what you want. And so they get to rule your life. And that's what they try to do in Europe.
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:57.520]  And, well, quite frankly, they're sick of it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But soon,
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:03.360]  you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers. You're not a live underground gopher.

[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:40.560]  put on your back. And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future. I mean,
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:46.000]  all I know is I want to go with the master built. I want to go to the next level. I want to be with
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:50.960]  the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers. They're cold and failed and
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:20:06.880]  feels like being a tomb. I want life. I want Jesus. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:27.040]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones. And now your host,
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:45.840]  Owen Troyer. The insanity, hypocrisy, degeneracy of the left is on full display right now.
[02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:52.880]  Cortez is one manifestation, Mueller another.
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:21:01.120]  But then there's the yellow jacket protest. There's the Brexit. There's Donald Trump.
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:07.360]  Now we're going to highlight some of the leftist hypocrisy coming up here
[02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:20.960]  with Dan Lyman from EuropeWars.com. But you know, Dan, I just can't help but want to look at some of
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:29.520]  these unbelievable hypocrisies that are happening right now. And I think the media matters hit piece
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:36.160]  on Tucker Carlson is like the perfect example where they sit here and they take an interview he did
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:40.880]  10 years ago on Bubba the Love Sponge, which is a shock, shock radio show. Funny enough, I actually
[02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:48.560]  used to, they were syndicated out of St. Louis at the radio station I used to work for. But
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:56.160]  Jack Mesobic just put out this list of tweets from James Gunn. So James Gunn, I mean, folks,
[02:21:56.160 --> 02:22:01.440]  you can just look at the weird pedophilic stuff that he talks about. But you know, Twitter allows
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:06.800]  him on there. And media matters hasn't run a hit piece on him yet. Oh, but Tucker Carlson is the
[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:15.600]  big bad guy. Southern Poverty Law Center put out a tweet that they are yet to delete, claiming that
[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:22.800]  Jussie Smollett was attacked by people yelling this is MAGA country in Trump hats. They have not
[02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:29.200]  yet retracted that. So you know, maybe if these people were consistent, Dan, in their attacks
[02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:34.880]  and in their coverage, maybe we wouldn't be so offended by it, but it's clearly politicized.
[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:42.240]  It's clearly one sided. And I mean, again, it's like if you just say you're a Democrat,
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:46.640]  you can get away with anything. So I'm a Democrat. So media matters like leave me alone.
[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:50.640]  Actually, I kind of like you guys when you cover me, honestly, Timothy Johnson, you know,
[02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:55.200]  you're just great. The work you do over there at media matter, Timothy Johnson is just
[02:22:55.840 --> 02:23:02.000]  amazing, dude. You're so above me, honestly. But wow. So I mean, what do you make of it though?
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.520]  It's reached hysterical levels, the hypocrisy of the left right now, Dan.
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:11.840]  It's every day, I think, okay, we got to be at the peak. I don't really think that because
[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:15.280]  I know it's going to keep going, but you see something new and you say, this has got to be
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:19.200]  the craziest it's going to get. And of course, it just keeps going and going. And these people,
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:23.520]  they never tire either. I mean, it's been years of this now since essentially, I would say since,
[02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:29.280]  you know, Trump started running really brought out the craziness, but it just keeps going every day.
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:34.880]  And you know, you were just talking about the hypocrisy. And this is like, this is peak hypocrisy
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:40.480]  to me. I just found this earlier today. Someone else had posted it. I can't claim credit for it.
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:49.440]  But here it is. It's Jack from Twitter, Jack Dorsey. In February of 2013, he tweeted,
[02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:55.920]  every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn to code. That tweet is
[02:23:55.920 --> 02:24:02.560]  still up. So I reported about Jack to himself that he had been using Twitter hate speech.
[02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:08.000]  So I mean, the hypocrisy is incredible. They can use the exactly the same language and not
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:13.520]  suffer the consequences if they decide that it's bad that we do it, but good when they do.
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:17.360]  Well, don't forget Tim Cook said that high schoolers need to learn to code too.
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:23.680]  When he was speaking with President Trump at a business roundtable. So I mean, you know,
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:27.680]  but it's ridiculous. Like, yeah, learn to code. I mean, it's a valuable skill.
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:31.440]  So it's like, you can't even tell someone, hey, learn this valuable skill, you're about to be
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:36.960]  out of a job. Because again, it's the left losing their minds because they're the ones losing their
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:42.160]  jobs. I don't think, you know, I think another thing that's happened in the last few years is
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:47.200]  this with the new, you know, the new MAGA movement, the populist uprising or whatever you want to call
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:53.040]  it. The left wasn't used to people fighting back, at least with any capability with the ability to
[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:58.400]  actually inflict any damage. And in the last few years, I think they've really met their match in
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:03.440]  terms of, you know, every time we go back at them, every time Trump goes back at them, hits them
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:08.720]  back, you know, twice as hard kind of thing, they reveal how thin their skins are, and they just
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:13.920]  can't handle it. And they get just even more mad, which I think is probably compounding their
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:18.880]  insanity is that they've been, they realize that we get the best of them every time we go after
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:24.000]  them. And every day they wake up, they want to see Trump remove from office. And every day they go
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:29.760]  to bed, he's still their president. So, Dan, you know, you are the lead singer rhythm guitar for
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:35.760]  Abandon the Halos. And you were listening yesterday where I had the bassist on from Filter. And I
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:40.480]  think that there was something I talked about how the music industry has been so monopolized by
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:47.600]  corporations. And I said, basically, you know, the people that signed these record deals, they'll
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:53.840]  pass up on 100 beautiful, awesome, unique musicians for the one that they know they can control.
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:56.800]  So I know that you wanted to say something about that. So Dan, was there something you wanted to
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:01.440]  talk about when it comes to the music industry? Yeah, well, you know, I really found that to be
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:07.040]  such a fascinating interview with Mr. Kavanaugh from Filter. I thought is is everything he was
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:12.960]  saying really rang true with me. I spent almost about a decade in Los Angeles and a band there
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:18.320]  and an industry. And, you know, eventually just got tired of it. And, you know, some of us kind
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:22.480]  of moved on from that. And we kept doing it for a little while longer, actually. And I just put
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:28.640]  out a new record about two years ago. And it was after I had started working at Info Wars. And
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:33.920]  when we when we put out records, I try to write like a blast to my own mailing list, personal
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:38.720]  people, you know, a couple hundred friends and family. And in them, I just kind of update people
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:42.560]  on updated people on what, you know, what we're all doing with our lives at that point, because
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:46.960]  everyone was on to new things. And I didn't say anything much about myself, except that I was
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:53.040]  now a journalist and living in Europe. And as some of the people that I considered good friends
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:57.600]  looked up what I was doing, they hadn't heard from me in a while. And they looked up what I was
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:01.920]  doing and saw that I was writing for Info Wars and sent me just some of the nastiest emails,
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:08.240]  calling me a Nazi, you know, far right extremist, blah, blah, blah. And it was like, it was amazing
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:14.560]  to see the turn. And that really illuminated for me like how much these people really, really
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:18.880]  hate you in that industry and the entertainment industry in general, if you're not in lockstep
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:24.880]  with them politically and with your own personal ideology. And once they realized that I wasn't
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:31.600]  and had just been kind of a crypto liberal under this, you know, behind the scenes as a musician,
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:35.120]  I just kind of kept my mouth shut about everything, just never really, you know,
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:38.640]  debated any of these things with people and let them say whatever they wanted to.
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:42.400]  And then once I went out and did my own thing, I just started getting piles of hate from these
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:46.880]  people and pretty much don't have many friends left in the music industry at this point.
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:51.360]  Well, and the thing about that is too is like, look, there's smart people out there.
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:56.560]  And you learn quick when you get into certain industries that, you know, let's just say,
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:00.320]  not literally, but like, let's say you sell your soul a little bit or you compromise on some of
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:05.120]  your values a little bit, but, but it's for money. And so you kind of justify it's like, oh, well,
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:09.440]  this way I have to do to be a success. So kind of slowly but surely sacrifice your values a little
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:15.120]  bit more and that just chips away. And then at the end of it, you have none left. And so I think
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:19.280]  that that's unfortunately where a lot of Hollywood has ended up now. And that's why you see such
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:23.920]  derangement out of some of these Hollywood actors and some of these musicians and stuff,
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:27.360]  because they've just been selling out for so long because they justified it's like,
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:32.400]  as this is what I got to do to make a buck. And now they just have no values left.
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:37.760]  So it's really amazing. Dan Lyman, Europe Wars.com. Tell you what, Dan, if you want to stick around,

[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:35.440]  and well this is such bullcrap from twitter today see and here's the thing about twitter
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:44.240]  i think that jack dorsi is really hands off and most of the stuff that you see being pushed
[02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:49.520]  and everything is really probably done by the leftist activists that work there so twitter
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:53.920]  moments puts this out which twitter moments is like you know the biggest stories of the day they claim
[02:33:53.920 --> 02:34:00.160]  so twitter moments puts out people are calling to fire tucker carlson after resurfacing of his
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:06.720]  past comments about women and child abuse so this is total fake news on every level a people are not
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:12.560]  calling for tucker carlson to be fired just radical leftists and b uh they're sitting here
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:17.680]  insinuating that he's like promoting child abuse or or something here and and he's just
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:26.240]  making crude cruel humor on a shock jock radio show but again it's like ilhan omark and say you
[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:31.840]  know jews are bad and israel's brainwashing everybody and and they can take israel off the
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:37.280]  map and then put it on the map in their office is palestine and it's just like it just goes on and
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:43.440]  on they all they all put on blackface you know they use the n word on their comedy segments but
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:46.880]  like oh you know tucker carlson's not allowed to do anything and now everyone's calling for him to be
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:54.800]  fired so dan doesn't just again it's such bs i mean this is twitter promoting leftist propaganda
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:35:00.480]  right here i have it in my hands and then jack and his lawyers sit there like oh we don't know
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:07.600]  about any bias we have no idea oh i get the impression that you i think you're right about
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:11.920]  maybe jack might be more hands off and we just it's the only name that we know to blame like
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:17.360]  zuckerberg but uh you know watching that that interview that he did with uh with the chief
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:23.360]  legal uh officer at twitter i forget her name gatti uh was last name she seemed to have much
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:27.680]  more of a handle on what was going on and there were times when you kind of felt like jack was
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:33.040]  just like a reflexive answer but then he would look over to her to see what the actual accurate
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:37.040]  answer was so you might be right i mean he's off on you know buddhist retreats all the time and i
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:42.240]  mean how much of a grasp can you really have on things at this point i mean i guess he kind of
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:45.840]  is like a committed buddhist i mean he wears like the same black hoodie everywhere he goes
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:52.400]  you know so i mean whatever um but maybe that's the case and he's hands off because i mean think
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:36:01.280]  about it i mean they antifa used twitter to dox tucker carlson and then they went to his house and
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:09.360]  got violent and no twitter moments about that oh but but tucker carlson was on a talk show
[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:14.080]  10 years ago with bubble the love sponge who by the way still says stuff like this on air almost
[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:21.280]  daily but that's not the story so i mean i don't know if jack understands what's really going on
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:26.080]  i think vijaya does i think jack is just kind of like he's hip and you know he feels he's cool
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:30.640]  and he's hip and he's got all these opportunities now and you know left his politicians dying with
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:35.200]  him and everything but uh you know vijaya gade same thing she hangs out with hillary clinton
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:41.440]  and you know they all love obama and everything so who knows if they even see their own bias
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:49.280]  quite frankly uh but anybody who thinks getting advice from hillary clinton uh or anyone who
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:54.560]  thinks hillary clinton is inspirational i guess if you want to murder leaders and and laugh about it
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:58.880]  and and cause the destabilization of nations i guess it's funny if you want to have americans
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:03.520]  murdered to protect your corruption in libya yeah i guess that's too that's true too if you
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:08.320]  want to launder 83 million dollars in the 2016 presidential election yeah then hillary clinton
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:13.280]  would be someone you want to be inspired by if you want to rob hady of billions of dollars yeah
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:17.440]  hillary clinton is who you would look up to to be inspired by yeah i guess i guess vijaya gade is
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:24.640]  right i guess vijaya wants to rob hady too then dan yeah uh who knows interesting she's uh she's
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:29.760]  actually a legal immigrant uh this is one of the people that she was born in india yeah trump
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:34.160]  wants to bring into the country and as if uh as if legal and that's you know that's fine if they
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:38.160]  work in the tech industry that's fine but uh these are the people that are they don't have the same
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:43.440]  respect for free speech uh and you know i left this from another country is gonna have you know
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:48.560]  just no concern for the first amendment um so i mean it's just it's just interesting that she
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:53.680]  would come to the states and then you know feel like she she has the uh the right to take away
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:38:00.880]  other people's freedom to uh say what they please including learn to code right which jack doors jack
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:07.280]  tweeted out years ago and and again i just wonder that's what i'm saying like do you think that they're
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:11.680]  i mean because they're either liars or they really have no idea what the hell's going on i mean
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:17.840]  vijaya gade is either a boldface liar or she can't even see her own bias i mean they sit there and
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:24.240]  they lay out the three reasons why they banned alex and it was all bs the whole thing was bs she's
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:29.440]  a lawyer she knows what she's doing she knows that she's the one that took jones's uh comments out of
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:34.000]  context but then it goes back to my original question who knows if either one of them was
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:37.840]  even really involved with the original band of alex jones i mean obviously they were talking
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:42.080]  about it jack doors he did interviews about it but my guess is there's these other little leftists
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:46.400]  running around actually running the show that are really pulling all of these strings shadow banning
[02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:54.960]  conservatives going through our dms they got caught by project veritas so i don't know if twitter
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:59.440]  wants to censor conservatives just don't lie about it that that's my thing just admit you're doing it
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:05.280]  you know yeah i would think it's a top to bottom thing for sure i mean anyone that's working there
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:09.520]  i mean you can't be a conservative and be in the music industry or even really a libertarian
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:14.880]  at this point right leading at all so i imagine you can't be the same at twitter but uh because of
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:20.000]  it was so coordinated i would think that there has to be some some coordination at the top with you
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:25.520]  know with the with the ceo or with the you know uh just high high level officers and all of these
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:31.040]  companies because officials i should say in these companies because for them to coordinate everything
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:35.760]  i don't think that's something that could happen you know at lower level or you know the the people
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:41.200]  that are just like monitoring for for unacceptable tweets or thought crimes so i think there had to
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:46.880]  be something going on at the top levels and you know and and let's remember that hillary clinton
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:52.400]  of course called out alex in a speech of hers wouldn't surprise me have a little conversation
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:58.800]  between hillary and miss gattie about you know about the problems that alex jones is causing for
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:04.560]  her effort for her campaign and get him off the the platform as soon as possible i mean anything
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:09.840]  nothing would surprise me yeah you know that's a good point i didn't even think about that that
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:15.920]  was one that's right out there too it's like yeah of course hillary clinton would be trying to get
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:22.000]  alex jones off of twitter of course she would be mentioning that when she talks with vijaya good day
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:29.920]  of course she would wow and so all the answers are right in front of us but just makes me wonder
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:37.840]  if the lies from social media uh heads on capitol hill are ever going to be called the task
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:41.840]  sundar pachai mark zuckerberg sharyl sandberg who actually was just honest she was like yeah we
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:45.760]  censor it yeah we yeah we censor it yeah we manipulated i mean at least she was honest so
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:49.520]  she was smart enough to just be honest that's i think she's facebook ceo just like yeah we
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:54.080]  censor whatever we want yeah we censor politically yeah we do it uh but the rest of them just lie

[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:21.280]  all right so you've now got conspiracy theorists on the left
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:28.800]  saying that a recent appearance by malania trump was actually not malania trump but a body double
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:34.960]  um now look i'm not gonna sit here and act like that couldn't be the truth it's just funny how they
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:40.000]  go with these conspiracy theories and like nobody blinks an eye i mean even joy bayhar and the view
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:45.200]  did a whole segment breaking it down is it actually malania trump is it not that's fine
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:53.760]  of course the story is uh yeah the trumps are always in danger because of you guys inciting
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:48:00.080]  violence so yeah if there's a body double for malania trump it's because of people like joy
[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:05.120]  bayhar on the view inciting violence against donald trump and his family so yeah if donald trump and
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:09.200]  malania want to have a body double for malania because you guys are trying to incite domestic
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:16.320]  terror against her then absolutely but they won't cover that angle of the story would they you know
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:26.240]  just almost a thousand documented many on tape accounts of trump supporters being attacked by
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:32.800]  radical leftist terrorists incited by people like joy bayhar on the view so uh yeah if there's a body
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:39.200]  double for malania it's because y'all are trying to incite domestic terror against her so yeah she
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:45.280]  might need a body double when you're sending out your street minions as like death squads against
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:59.760]  conservatives so yeah you know here's a no-brainer trump can save billions by ending spanish translation
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:08.480]  program so that whole thing that anytime you call any government uh bureaucracy press two for spanish
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:14.880]  that's costing this country billions of dollars a year can you believe that and all trump would
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:19.520]  have to do is to nix that to save us billions of dollars a year you could build the wall tomorrow
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:28.640]  but that would not be politically correct any probably racist for doing that for one
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:32.720]  it'd save billions of dollars i mean we're in english speaking country but uh you know don't
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:36.880]  be a racist in fact he should add five other languages on there in fact i bet you that probably
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:41.920]  happened before he gets money for the wall they'll spend ten billion dollars to add three new languages
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:47.360]  before they build a wall and one of them will be latin which is a dead language
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:55.520]  let's go out to the phone lines oh by the way real quick uh venezuela's having rolling blackouts
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:50:00.880]  internet blackouts uh for almost a week now uh news is reporting that there's activity at a
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:06.320]  north korean missile site you know who knows you can't trust these people they say weapons of mass
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:11.680]  destruction they say babies and incubators uh they say the Gulf of Tonkin so you know
[02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:16.640]  these people in the media are just cold-blooded liars so who really knows what's going on there
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:21.120]  but let's go out to the phones here and oh and benjamin takes over in the next segment i've got

[02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:43.760]  um so i guess uh you make a question you want to answer are they are they going to do anything
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:49.440]  about this mule or probe mule or probe we're going to call the guy no they're not no matter what they
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:56.240]  fine they're not going to do anything i'm not not exactly sure what you mean you mean nobody
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:51:03.200]  involved in it is is going to have justice or nobody like i'm you know sorry what happened
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:08.400]  to roger stone but that was all ploy just really good people to speak up he's being used just like
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:19.040]  anybody else i'm not sure exactly what you mean well i was well i guess you could say i was the
[02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:25.120]  the fourth part of the fourth branch um until about three months ago when i pretty much walked away
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:30.400]  and there's so much more happening behind the scenes you alex jones you guys you guys come
[02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:36.640]  really closely in a lot of it right um you are right on a lot of the stuff but um you know this
[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:43.920]  whole uh investigation things like that you lower the profit so he is he's having his strings pulled
[02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:49.760]  like anybody else yeah but at the same time joe you also understand i mean he's also fighting
[02:51:49.760 --> 02:51:53.360]  for his life i mean he's involved in all this corruption too he's involved with the eppstein
[02:51:53.360 --> 02:51:58.160]  cover-up so i mean at a certain level he's also fighting for his life i mean they're all fighting
[02:51:58.160 --> 02:52:05.840]  for their political lives here and beyond so yeah because honestly i mean to if this thing
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:11.680]  actually opens up and they find like all these you know things that are long you know which we
[02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:17.840]  all see and everybody's looking like well how come they haven't done anything yet because when you
[02:52:17.840 --> 02:52:23.120]  bring down that many people there's so much more is going to follow fully bar gets appointed to ag
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:29.040]  shocker wasn't shocked at all of course he did clinton bony bush crony of course he was going to get
[02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:36.720]  in there so do you think that's the swamp taking over donald trump or donald trump owning the swamp
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:42.880]  now they're they're taking it over in the swamp without you know i've heard that term that's what
[02:52:42.880 --> 02:52:49.520]  you want to call it definitely is a that's a good term it stinks in them it's it's it's a mess it's
[02:52:49.520 --> 02:52:54.320]  so every day the waters are so murky you have no idea what's going on all of this goes back
[02:52:55.360 --> 02:53:05.040]  right to the war two we obtained nazi propaganda being and rosa rosevelt saw the nuremberg
[02:53:05.040 --> 02:53:10.160]  trial one of the trials at all it was just obtained their information yeah yeah press got bush got to
[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:16.800]  walk with all probably the nazi gold that he had with all his bank deals and the raw materials deals
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:21.680]  that he made with the nazis uh you know the operation paperclip bringing the thousands of
[02:53:21.680 --> 02:53:27.920]  nazi scientists over here uh the e u is basically hitler's dream i mean that was that was hitler's
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:35.920]  goal uh so now merkel is basically running hitler's uh e u nation out of germany uh yeah the corruption
[02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:42.320]  is deep you know yeah and if trump doesn't do anything about it we're probably screwed
[02:53:42.320 --> 02:53:47.440]  quite frankly thanks for the call joe let's go to mickey calling in from arkansas i'll go ahead mickey
[02:53:48.320 --> 02:53:52.960]  uh hey i want how they're going today good thanks for calling i'm kind of at a loss and i need your
[02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:57.920]  help uh i usually try to motivate a lot of people to vote when it comes down for for the election and
[02:53:57.920 --> 02:54:03.440]  in 2018 the way the democrats just stuffed out a ballot and brought in truckloads of ballots
[02:54:03.440 --> 02:54:08.560]  a lot of my friends that i talked to they're not even motivated to vote in 2020 anymore because i
[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:14.480]  feel like it's hopeless how do i really motivate people to get excited about voting in 2020 when
[02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:20.000]  they just feel like it's useless because the democrats are gonna well i think you know that's
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:26.000]  not your job and and if an american can't be excited to vote then that's on him trump should
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:29.200]  be motivating people to vote the candidates should be motivating people to vote but here's one let me
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:35.200]  give you this one mickey you want to know how someone like ilhan omar gets into office because
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:42.640]  your friends don't vote well i tell everybody and you know who does vote muslims from the middle
[02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:48.960]  east that's who votes that's yeah so as soon as they can understand that then maybe america
[02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:54.640]  can take its political system back but we don't vote americans don't vote folks people in the middle
[02:54:54.640 --> 02:55:01.200]  east aren't stupid they know we don't vote they come here and they outvote us absolutely absolutely
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:07.520]  so i don't know maybe that can help wake your friends up i'll give i'll give something to try but
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:11.440]  i'm just so disgusted with everybody i talk to because they feel like it's hopeless
[02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:14.560]  and i tell them you still have to vote even if you feel like it's hopeless
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:21.200]  well you got to do something and i mean if you're not going to vote then you're not doing anything

[03:01:04.240 --> 03:01:11.760]  you know Belarus but i want to give it a shot anyway it was uh you know it was very heartwarming
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:18.960]  to see uh alex and joe rogan work out their differences you know but i didn't work out
[03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:24.320]  my differences with joe i still believe he's a sodomite and i can prove it i can prove it today
[03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:30.240]  and as alex said um there it is look at that picture look at that picture of joe for those of
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:36.640]  you just listening he has his earring in his left ear and he's giving the a okay sign with his mouth open
[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:42.480]  and the a okay sign look look at it and by the way that's not him at like 18 that's him at like 30
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:49.120]  he's like 30 with his his shirt on button and he's saying a okay okay so that a okay symbol
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:54.800]  this right some people think it's like a satanic symbol it might be some people just think it means
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:59.360]  okay some people said it's white but want to know what it is in the gay community it means you're
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:05.120]  open for business so what he's saying in this picture is there's a part of my body that's open
[03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:12.480]  for business and so is my mouth and um you're like a big big bear you're you're misinterpreting that
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:19.360]  he doesn't actually like uh watching gay guys make out really check out this tweet from joe
[03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:25.680]  rogan uh call me romantic but i love when gay guys on on a date are comfortable enough to kiss in
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:31.840]  public no there's another word for that joe it's not romantic it's uh it's called uh being a sodomite
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:39.120]  and uh and and it's like oh well big bear that's uh from 2012 yeah he was in his 40s that's older
[03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:45.360]  than i am now big bear why are you so obsessed with joe rogan why is it look at obama right there
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:50.560]  open for business bill clinton open for business they're all saying look that part of me is open
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:57.600]  it's open for biz and look at how joe's face is he's saying listen everywhere's open for
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:03:06.400]  business on me and so uh you know i and the thing is is i'm uh there's people in my life
[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:12.880]  that i care about that but it is not two earrings earrings including a hoop right there joe rogan
[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:20.640]  uh wearing a leather jacket and uh and like uh one of those white beater tees and he's looking
[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:25.360]  at you saying i will do you want it you want to have a fear factor you want to have a fear
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:34.000]  factor let's see who's scared first i mean sodomite sodomite and people are like well what's wrong
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:39.120]  with that a lot it's actually a sin it's a sin to want to be inside of another man or have a man
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:46.960]  inside of you i mean some of the unbearables uh twinkle bear uh has a boyfriend but i i'm i'm way
[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:54.720]  less freaked out by a guy that's like listen i pump okay i i don't approve of that lifestyle but
[03:03:54.720 --> 03:03:59.920]  at least you're honest with me people living in in in shadows they're capable of anything so
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:08.960]  i uh and on fear factor you try to get people to uh to drink goat semen that's a true story
[03:04:08.960 --> 03:04:16.080]  why did they pick the goat gee i have to really think about that so in closing i'm from the bottom
[03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:21.520]  of my heart i'm touched that alex and joe made up in their in their five hour session and i think
[03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:27.440]  that's great of alex to bury the hatchet you know turn the other cheek and whatnot but i think i
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:34.000]  just proved that joe is in fact a sodomite and he's open for business he'll take it any way he can
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:39.280]  and he wants to do a fear factor with you most likely behind a dumpster um so when he says hey
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:45.280]  you want a dumpster pump say no no joe i'm not i'm not open for business i'll be back in a couple
[03:04:46.080 --> 03:04:49.840]  couple minutes and we're gonna talk about words and what words actually mean and how to not be
[03:04:49.840 --> 03:04:56.480]  tricked cheers joe's the sodomite you know the worst part about getting old i'm still strong 45
[03:04:56.480 --> 03:05:00.720]  is that i won't be there for my children someday that's why i need to make them strong now now i can
[03:05:00.720 --> 03:05:06.400]  be there for my children now i can make them strong now i can instruct them now i can teach them what
[03:05:06.400 --> 03:05:10.320]  i've learned but not once i'm gone you think of this digital age your words going forever but now
[03:05:10.320 --> 03:05:15.360]  they're even better getting rid of what you said they were before it's so much easier to burn video
[03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:21.360]  or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning isn't it but i have joined my will
[03:05:21.360 --> 03:05:26.160]  to the resistance i can't be destroyed now as long as i realize i've done right and the long
[03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:31.120]  of the people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either as long as you bind yourself to
[03:05:31.120 --> 03:05:36.400]  something and commit to it and go through the fire for it there is a magic that then takes place
[03:05:36.400 --> 03:05:41.600]  the transcend space and time when you commit the award of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our
[03:05:41.600 --> 03:05:47.360]  articles and videos that overrides everything the enemy's doing so please now commit to support
[03:05:47.360 --> 03:05:56.400]  info wars however you can and realize your provision to info wars is your own provision
[03:05:57.760 --> 03:06:05.680]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones with oan benchament
[03:06:05.680 --> 03:06:16.960]  i love that man um good to be back everybody right now we're gonna talk about words i
[03:06:17.840 --> 03:06:25.200]  love words and i love the math of words i love the truth of words and i don't love when people
[03:06:25.200 --> 03:06:33.200]  manipulate words and i was laughing today at a very funny meme about amy schumer it's uh amy schumer
[03:06:33.200 --> 03:06:41.680]  you know is a very pigish comedian who just uh so this is a this is me for those of you just
[03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:46.960]  listening it says uh straight man and it's a as straight line of light and it's the pink
[03:06:46.960 --> 03:06:51.600]  floyd prism and the pink floyd prism from dark southern moon it says amy schumer sex scene and
[03:06:51.600 --> 03:06:56.720]  then on the other side it's the rainbow of course i laughed a lot about at it and said that's really
[03:06:56.720 --> 03:07:02.800]  funny if you watch you know pigish amy schumer knew it for a second you probably would take
[03:07:02.800 --> 03:07:07.680]  off joe rogan on one of his many sodomy offers but then i started being like wait a minute no the
[03:07:07.680 --> 03:07:14.800]  rainbow was it is about the covenant with god it's from it's from the bible you know when that when
[03:07:14.800 --> 03:07:23.120]  the flood ends and god shows no the rainbow it's basically like we all good yo so the sodomites
[03:07:23.120 --> 03:07:28.960]  took the rainbow and they also took the word gay gay meant happy so i want to take a little time
[03:07:28.960 --> 03:07:34.800]  right now and uh talk about what words really mean and if you listen to alex jones or me
[03:07:35.600 --> 03:07:42.720]  is a good chance that people have called you a conspiracy theorist you're a conspiracy theorist
[03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:48.640]  oh i'm not one of those conspiracy theorists i mean listen i'm no conspiracy theorist but
[03:07:48.640 --> 03:07:59.600]  i think uh listen my fans get me you know some some uh entertainers people give them drugs or
[03:07:59.600 --> 03:08:04.560]  panties not me bibles and dictionaries so this is the Oxford English dictionary from the 70s
[03:08:05.280 --> 03:08:10.800]  not even that long ago let's look up what uh conspiracy actually means conspiracy
[03:08:10.800 --> 03:08:19.040]  the action of conspiring okay so if that's the action of conspiring what does conspire mean so
[03:08:19.040 --> 03:08:24.960]  this is how reasonable people reason through things how how you can work through problems
[03:08:24.960 --> 03:08:32.800]  and come to the right answer logos you know so let's see what does conspire mean conspire means
[03:08:32.800 --> 03:08:40.000]  to breathe to breathe together so basically everyone in a yoga class is conspiring to combined
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:47.680]  or no what was here to combine an action or aim to concur co-operate as by intention to agree
[03:08:48.240 --> 03:08:57.680]  tonight and producing okay so let's uh just cut the bs here uh to conspire means to to uh hatch a
[03:08:57.680 --> 03:09:08.080]  plan and theory you know theory just means you have a possible solution you know in the scientific
[03:09:08.080 --> 03:09:12.960]  method you you come up with a hypothesis you test it allegedly we'll get to science later
[03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:19.440]  but then you get a theory like the theory of evolution the theory of gravity the theory of
[03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:28.880]  russia collusion so a conspiracy theory is nothing more than a then then possibly uncovering a plan
[03:09:29.680 --> 03:09:35.840]  that people put together human beings are social animals we function in a hierarchy we function in
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:42.720]  groups we function in tribes and families nations our entire life is nothing more than a series of
[03:09:42.720 --> 03:09:48.800]  conspiracies like i conspire with my friend to go get beers and then i conspire with another friend
[03:09:48.800 --> 03:09:54.560]  to make okay make secret uh this is according to dictionary dot com make secret plans jointly
[03:09:54.560 --> 03:09:59.600]  to commit an unlawful harmful act so that's one reason why i like the print is because they added
[03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:05.680]  secret even though secret is still still doesn't matter you know even even a secret plan there's
[03:10:05.680 --> 03:10:11.520]  conspiracies all the time like when alex jones was kicked off every social platform for being a
[03:10:11.520 --> 03:10:20.160]  conspiracy theorist it proved a conspiracy if you get kicked off facebook and youtube and
[03:10:20.160 --> 03:10:25.520]  spotify and all and all that in the same day that means there was a secret plan to do it you
[03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:32.240]  understand how insane that is they kicked alex jones off because he's a conspiracy theorist
[03:10:32.240 --> 03:10:41.840]  by hatching an obvious conspiracy let's look up some more words and there's a reason that
[03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:49.440]  they do this oh and all i'm saying earlier uh about calls i'm down to to take a call here
[03:10:49.440 --> 03:10:55.360]  in there i always enjoy that okay this is the word discriminate
[03:10:55.360 --> 03:11:07.600]  the action of discriminating or distinguishing a uh a distinction with the mind or in action
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:12.160]  that's what discrimination means so when someone goes big bear that's discrimination yeah you want
[03:11:12.160 --> 03:11:17.680]  to know how how much i discriminate every single day i sexually discriminate against all women
[03:11:17.680 --> 03:11:27.120]  that aren't my wife when i eat i discriminate against poison i discriminate against jews
[03:11:27.120 --> 03:11:32.800]  i'm just kidding i was just trying to do a hyperbole but um discrimination is what reasonable
[03:11:32.800 --> 03:11:39.920]  people do that's what reason is that's a conscious mind that's a mind that's aware you say why no
[03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:46.480]  who doesn't discriminate slaves prostitutes you know a prostitute is the definition of no
[03:11:46.480 --> 03:11:51.040]  discrimination a sex slave they have to have sex with everyone presented to them by their
[03:11:51.040 --> 03:11:57.040]  pimp for money that's a lack of discrimination and it's hell it's horror let's look up another one
[03:11:57.680 --> 03:12:02.240]  i uh i didn't want to waste the good people's time the good fans of info wars so i did a
[03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:10.720]  couple uh page markers ahead of ahead of time oh that's moron so that means we have to do uh
[03:12:10.720 --> 03:12:22.640]  uh retarded first oh we can also do um prejudice prejudicial uh that means examination previous
[03:12:22.640 --> 03:12:30.160]  to trial okay i am prejudice of men covered in blood holding a machete that are walking up to
[03:12:30.160 --> 03:12:38.160]  my house they could be coming to share the news to share the good the good news the gospel the
[03:12:38.160 --> 03:12:45.280]  good news and it turns out i was wrong that maybe just because they uh see look look at the noun
[03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:49.760]  right there preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience that's not what it's
[03:12:49.760 --> 03:12:56.080]  in the the dictionary that was changed that's why i don't trust the uh the the online dictionaries
[03:12:56.080 --> 03:13:02.400]  when people go well words evolve words evolve oh and not this is the night this is the 1970s
[03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:09.680]  guys this is the 1970s right here this book is from uh my brother's lifetime okay imagine playing
[03:13:09.680 --> 03:13:15.280]  monopoly and someone goes well you're the thumble you're the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumble
[03:13:15.280 --> 03:13:20.880]  the thimble and i'm the hat you have more properties than me so i'm gonna be the i'm gonna be the hat
[03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:26.640]  i'm gonna be the thimble now like no but i'm the thimble yeah things evolve no that's called theft
[03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:32.000]  these words have meaning okay retardation i'll just i'll just sum it up for it i know what these
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:38.480]  all all these words mean to retard so retardation that means you know to impair like i am retarded
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:43.440]  when it comes to uh certain things like spelling organizing you know when my wife recently cleans
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:50.480]  the couch cushion she found a ton of crayons from our sons and uh a bunch of screws and nails for me
[03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:57.040]  like i am retarded when it comes to not taking nails and screws out of my pockets okay you know
[03:13:57.040 --> 03:14:03.440]  what moron means the same thing except it has an iq this uh distinguish uh it distinguishes
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:12.720]  the iq because back in the eugenics program pushed by you know uh darwin and uh rock of fowler and a
[03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:18.960]  whole bunch of uh men in little hats shall we say they were killing a lot of these people all right
[03:14:18.960 --> 03:14:26.800]  so moron says stupid person uh but when you really dig in it means someone with an iq of 50 to 69
[03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:31.840]  and what happened to those people they got their testicles removed what it what does idiot mean
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:37.280]  what does imbecile mean idiot was someone with an iq of zero to 25 and idiots were not allowed to
[03:14:37.280 --> 03:14:43.840]  vote in in california until 2007 that's a true story in 2007 legally idiots were allowed to vote
[03:14:43.840 --> 03:14:50.880]  in california what happened 2008 that's a true story so what why did uh retard retardation
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:56.240]  retarded why did those become bad words because those were the pc terms those were the pc terms
[03:14:56.240 --> 03:15:00.560]  because they didn't have the blood on their hands of the eugenics program where they were not allowing
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:06.480]  morons imbeciles and idiots were which were all um look joron's open for business which were all
[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:13.920]  uh iq distinct uh distinguishing words they were tied to such horror that they were like
[03:15:13.920 --> 03:15:18.160]  okay let's just call people retarded because it's not so horrifying and now people like
[03:15:18.160 --> 03:15:25.840]  don't say retarded don't say retarded what to retarded note in music is to hesitate to retard
[03:15:25.840 --> 03:15:32.400]  a yeast retarded means to hold back the yeast or a fire retarded these are words that have meanings
[03:15:32.400 --> 03:15:40.320]  in use you should be prejudicial prejudge uh sex offenders if they're going to be babysitters

[03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:36.240]  you're my brother when we would do three words my brother's show is three words when i uh lived
[03:20:36.240 --> 03:20:43.200]  in his in the town that they live in and i would do out of these groundsmen i'd be as bravo uh we
[03:20:43.200 --> 03:20:49.360]  would we would just we my brother's just like me like we both spiral and get really intense and
[03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:57.360]  just talk intensely and then cut down trees but when we turned on that song it would just be
[03:20:57.360 --> 03:21:04.720]  silence and we just roll up uh anyway i'm about to talk about science but first i want to uh
[03:21:04.720 --> 03:21:10.880]  say that i will take calls i've never taken calls on this before but uh i always enjoy that when
[03:21:10.880 --> 03:21:19.360]  alex does the phone number is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven
[03:21:19.360 --> 03:21:23.280]  seven seven eight nine two five three nine so if you want to call up and talk to me that that's
[03:21:23.280 --> 03:21:29.680]  fine with me i mean uh i like having interaction if i'm just alone too long by the end i'm just like
[03:21:29.680 --> 03:21:36.080]  Beyonce is a hologram i i legit think that there's a decent chance that that's true but see those are
[03:21:36.080 --> 03:21:41.280]  the cons those are the ones i can't prove at all and kind of give a conspiracy theory guys
[03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:45.760]  a bad name because i have no evidence at all that Beyonce is a hologram but
[03:21:47.440 --> 03:21:54.480]  i mean prove she's not all right anyway we're gonna talk about science because people are
[03:21:54.480 --> 03:21:58.800]  starting to see science as some form of religion where they're like science is proven without
[03:21:58.800 --> 03:22:07.120]  science you would not have airplanes or uh computers or automobiles or engines no that's
[03:22:07.120 --> 03:22:14.000]  all called engineering it's engineering it's not science science uh crafts like a spider
[03:22:15.120 --> 03:22:23.120]  the tale of why something is after it happens you know the uh everyone's like yeah tell that to
[03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:29.280]  penicillin when your child sir is insane yeah penicillin was known by like turkish
[03:22:29.280 --> 03:22:35.360]  horse wranglers for centuries they would they would put like yeast or under a saddle because
[03:22:35.360 --> 03:22:39.840]  they would grow the mold they would it would cure stuff and then science rejected it for decades
[03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:46.400]  until they were forced science is nonsense engineering isn't some science is good science
[03:22:46.400 --> 03:22:51.360]  as a profession is nonsense because the whole thing is based on uh satisfying your financial
[03:22:51.360 --> 03:22:56.400]  backers and proving someone else's wrong that's the whole point i'm right yeah wrong i'm right yeah
[03:22:56.400 --> 03:23:05.040]  wrong i mean and by the way more than 50 percent of scientific studies are uh not not um replicable
[03:23:05.760 --> 03:23:10.320]  you can't replicate it which means it has no value whatsoever bill not a science guy
[03:23:10.320 --> 03:23:16.240]  is uh less scientifically educated by the way than my stay-at-home mother wife she has a
[03:23:16.240 --> 03:23:23.440]  better degree in science than bill nye the science guy i would allege it's possibly bill nye the uh
[03:23:23.440 --> 03:23:31.120]  the you know perverted guy i mean the guy the guy screams screams perversion he's like he screams
[03:23:32.560 --> 03:23:42.160]  sticky fingers i mean the guy's a sick a sick little man bill nye the science guy i wonder if
[03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:46.880]  wetzel's pretzels i'm i i wonder if wetzel was like listen i gotta get into pretzels
[03:23:46.880 --> 03:23:51.360]  the name's wetzel and bill nye's like i gotta become the science guy i mean because
[03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:58.720]  this pedo guy i guess is taken anyway check out this uh this short film that kind of it's funny
[03:23:58.720 --> 03:24:04.560]  but it kind of explains exactly exactly the problem with science because science isn't about finding
[03:24:04.560 --> 03:24:15.200]  truth it's about satisfying your masters i do sleep less than you though you know i know
[03:24:15.200 --> 03:24:20.480]  we both just don't get a lot of sleep but sometimes uh when i have to get up to change
[03:24:20.480 --> 03:24:25.760]  his diaper it takes me like an hour or two to fall back asleep takes an hour to fall back asleep
[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:33.440]  yeah sometimes yeah it takes me like three hours every time baby it's not a competition
[03:24:36.880 --> 03:24:42.800]  yes it is so i did what i always do before a mission i went to the ocean to look at birds
[03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:48.960]  then i did some cardio listening to science podcasts i became an expert immediately
[03:24:48.960 --> 03:24:57.040]  i then did the most scientific thing i could i hit a camera in our bedroom and recorded us sleeping
[03:24:57.040 --> 03:25:04.000]  without her knowing i had to keep it objective i timed how long each of us slept as i reviewed
[03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:11.360]  the footage i recorded my findings on my super professional dry erase board i will prove i sleep
[03:25:11.360 --> 03:25:22.720]  less than my wife but i started noticing something alarming this data was wrong science began to lie
[03:25:28.160 --> 03:25:33.760]  i've seen interstellar so i'm not an amateur at high level physics but i needed to consult
[03:25:33.760 --> 03:25:42.320]  with a friend fortunately i know a lot of physicists who can help out oh and i'm just
[03:25:42.320 --> 03:25:47.200]  comedian i just play a nerd and a scientist on tv turns out jimmy isn't actually a scientist he just
[03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:54.960]  plays one on tv which i still find very confusing fortunately i had more options kevin peter hickerson
[03:25:54.960 --> 03:26:03.680]  caltech phd nuclear physics he'll do just fine he's sure she's just not uh sleeping less than you now
[03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:11.040]  you sound like her man time is fluid according to camera according to physical reality i slept
[03:26:11.040 --> 03:26:16.400]  seven point five hours and she slept 45 minutes but that doesn't make any sense the gravitational
[03:26:16.400 --> 03:26:21.360]  force needed for this kind of distortion would be enormous i mean for this to happen in your
[03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:27.040]  bedroom in a repeatable way would be extraordinary pack your bags get some sweaters because we're
[03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:33.840]  on a stocko maybe the world's biggest ikea no that's where the Nobel prize is given out oh yeah
[03:26:35.680 --> 03:26:43.280]  god i'm so tired our boats were being pushed by different winds he yearned for a Nobel prize
[03:26:43.280 --> 03:26:54.720]  and i needed my wife to admit i'm right and for her to think i'm awesome
[03:26:58.720 --> 03:27:04.720]  we got to work the only way we know how
[03:27:04.720 --> 03:27:16.160]  okay baby you sure they didn't just sleep more than her yeah there's no chance
[03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:25.600]  so
[03:27:28.720 --> 03:27:34.720]  imagine that we're on an orange okay oranges have nothing to do with anything but i didn't
[03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:37.360]  want to point that out the stress was getting to him
[03:27:37.360 --> 03:27:47.600]  okay so there's a wormhole connecting door to quantum states so i'm the worm
[03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:51.040]  she's the hole well yes but no not at all
[03:27:51.040 --> 03:28:08.480]  as he continued to make no sense i documented our journey for future peer review
[03:28:09.520 --> 03:28:14.960]  the time dilation factor where you're sleeping on your side and Amy's sleeping on hers they're off
[03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:22.000]  by several orders of magnitude she slept for 71 hours and you only slept for three seconds whoa
[03:28:24.080 --> 03:28:25.520]  we cracked the code
[03:28:29.680 --> 03:28:37.120]  i mean this is amazing i mean that that's exactly right that's all right i was right
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:44.720]  she was wrong basically impossible so this is huge i mean the amount of energy that could be
[03:28:44.720 --> 03:28:46.720]  punished for this is spectacular

[03:31:56.800 --> 03:32:02.160]  bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally
[03:32:02.800 --> 03:32:07.840]  dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[03:32:07.840 --> 03:32:13.920]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[03:32:13.920 --> 03:32:18.400]  but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[03:32:18.400 --> 03:32:24.480]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to
[03:32:24.480 --> 03:32:29.440]  the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth
[03:32:29.440 --> 03:32:35.360]  crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining
[03:32:35.360 --> 03:32:41.920]  it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it and makes it
[03:32:41.920 --> 03:32:47.680]  even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's

[03:33:27.360 --> 03:33:34.480]  what's up everybody we're going to take a bunch of calls and uh my website's huge pianist dot
[03:33:34.480 --> 03:33:38.800]  com hit me up join my email list let me know where in europe i should go because i don't know if i
[03:33:38.800 --> 03:33:45.440]  have any uh fans in belarus but i'd sure like to find out so we're going to start off with uh
[03:33:45.440 --> 03:33:50.800]  lani who wants to uh yeah it's just let's just i've never taken calls on the show before but
[03:33:50.800 --> 03:33:57.120]  lani what's up talk to me hey are you doing the only good talk to you man thanks for taking my call oh
[03:33:57.120 --> 03:34:04.400]  of course dude i'm palm hey i'm kind of a words guy like you i'm just curious because um this term
[03:34:04.400 --> 03:34:10.880]  is used so much in public and in media and both both sides but nobody's really ever sat down and
[03:34:10.880 --> 03:34:18.320]  talked about it uh we think it was a term blackmail well i mean it's more politically correct
[03:34:18.320 --> 03:34:25.120]  than the n word i think right i'm just kidding do you mean blackmail like that the crime to blackmail
[03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:32.560]  someone or a blackmail well actually it's the crime it's always used like it's always used
[03:34:32.560 --> 03:34:39.840]  derogatory and a negative manner but if we sit down and really take two words and it's always used
[03:34:39.840 --> 03:34:47.440]  negatively what what's that word that's really funny dude i would guess i haven't looked into that one
[03:34:47.440 --> 03:34:57.440]  but i'm guessing there's some sort of historical uh story for for literal blackmail uh but i don't
[03:34:57.440 --> 03:35:01.680]  know that's insanely funny it's kind of like black ice in the winter where everyone's like watch out
[03:35:01.680 --> 03:35:07.520]  for the black ice you can't see it but you'll totally slip on it um or africanized bees like
[03:35:07.520 --> 03:35:12.720]  blackmail um i'll look into that that's fascinating though because it is kind of funny it's like
[03:35:12.720 --> 03:35:20.240]  like blackmail but um the all right so blackmail the action treated as a criminal offence of
[03:35:20.240 --> 03:35:23.760]  demanding payment or another benefit from someone in return for not revealing compromise
[03:35:23.760 --> 03:35:29.200]  if you're damaging information about them extortion demand money or another benefit from
[03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:34.320]  someone in return for not revealing compromising or damaging information about them that's why
[03:35:34.320 --> 03:35:39.520]  the only just to kind of go off a little bit on this the only way to beat blackmail is always
[03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:44.480]  go reveal it that's why you got to live your life in truth because it's the only weapon
[03:35:44.480 --> 03:35:50.160]  against something like that someone's like hey i got a picture of a weir for 15 years ago and
[03:35:50.720 --> 03:35:57.280]  you gotta send me money or agree with uh with the global warming hoax or i'm gonna show everybody
[03:35:57.280 --> 03:36:04.240]  just be like great just you know great show everybody you have to own it or else uh you
[03:36:04.240 --> 03:36:08.400]  never want to be a slave just never never accept anything for slavery but like rather
[03:36:08.400 --> 03:36:14.400]  than that it's tied to black males i i doubt it i think it's just a hilarious coincidence
[03:36:15.360 --> 03:36:21.120]  um like his mailman i always thought was funny because it seemed redundant like a mailman
[03:36:21.920 --> 03:36:27.680]  it's like mailman but it's mail because then you run into the the the fallacies that a lot of
[03:36:27.680 --> 03:36:33.760]  like feminists will do like his story history his story now it's from east war which goes back to
[03:36:33.760 --> 03:36:38.880]  latin there's nothing to do with his story so these are fun things to think about and and uh
[03:36:38.880 --> 03:36:44.800]  you know riff on but um i don't actually know all right thanks thanks buddy it's great talk to you
[03:36:44.800 --> 03:36:51.120]  man um now let's go to uh christ in utah who i guess wants to talk about science science
[03:36:52.320 --> 03:36:59.280]  yes i'm here thank you for taking my call of course pal what's up okay i think we're of the
[03:36:59.280 --> 03:37:06.960]  we're a little bit of kindred spirits and this is just going off my perspective or my experience
[03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:16.160]  but isn't it interesting at least for me that the people that either uh flag off conspiracy
[03:37:16.160 --> 03:37:24.400]  theories or or um just they they think that anyone that questions anything is stupid but
[03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:31.280]  yet they're the ones that never do any research they take any mainstream news at face value they
[03:37:31.280 --> 03:37:38.480]  believe that the first you know article title of any any you know what i mean there are ones that
[03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:46.240]  don't do any research they don't look for anomalies they don't look for uh inconsistencies i mean
[03:37:47.520 --> 03:37:51.440]  do you know what i mean yeah yeah they're projecting exactly what they're doing i'll give
[03:37:51.440 --> 03:37:58.720]  you a brief example that russian collusion narrative is way way way way way more unfounded
[03:37:58.720 --> 03:38:03.600]  on any facts than anything alex jones has ever said like the frogs actually are wearing roller
[03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:11.200]  skates and going to rapes no but like literally though there is scientific evidence that frogs
[03:38:11.200 --> 03:38:16.480]  have absorbed some chemical through their skin it was done at berkeley so when people the biggest
[03:38:16.480 --> 03:38:23.840]  thing that people say about alex jones is oh the frogs are turning gay there's way more evidence of
[03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:30.720]  that than of russia collusion and and i was thinking about this word thing where it's like um
[03:38:31.760 --> 03:38:36.480]  america the mainstream media in america has been has been pushing this narrative that
[03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:42.640]  donald trump may be friends with putin secretly and they've spent millions of dollars trying to
[03:38:42.640 --> 03:38:49.040]  uh show that they've like had phone calls right but but yet if someone says like oh why are we selling
[03:38:49.040 --> 03:38:54.080]  all these weapons to israel and saudi arabia people are like do you believe that there's a secret
[03:38:54.080 --> 03:38:59.840]  plan you're an anti-semite or something it's like there's no word anti-slavite like when someone's
[03:38:59.840 --> 03:39:04.800]  like or it's slob which actually is driven from derived from the word slave or the other way around
[03:39:04.800 --> 03:39:09.920]  i gotta look into that one but like there is no word to be like why do you think there's a secret
[03:39:09.920 --> 03:39:16.480]  cabal like with russia that there's a secret plan behind closed doors are you an anti-slavite you're
[03:39:16.480 --> 03:39:23.920]  an anti-slav that doesn't exist even though that's clearly a much more obvious word and so what you're
[03:39:23.920 --> 03:39:29.040]  saying is absolutely true science a lot of times goes kicking and screaming into things that are
[03:39:29.040 --> 03:39:35.920]  absolutely proven and a perfect example is tesla you know now tesla is seen uh for the genius that
[03:39:35.920 --> 03:39:41.840]  he is but in his time he was rejected by all of science they rejected all of it because he was
[03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:49.680]  doing engineering he was showing people um uh ac versus dc and then science said no direct current
[03:39:49.680 --> 03:39:54.640]  and what rhetoric did uh did did they use they electrocuted an elephant just because it was
[03:39:54.640 --> 03:40:01.920]  shocking i'm dead serious what's his name edison when he realized that tesla who was an engineer not
[03:40:01.920 --> 03:40:07.440]  a scientist figured out that alternating current was more oh yeah i do kind of look like tesla by
[03:40:07.440 --> 03:40:13.440]  the way it's weird but um that that alternating current was way better than direct current
[03:40:13.440 --> 03:40:18.720]  what did edison do with his science did he try to dispute him no he electrocuted an elephant
[03:40:18.720 --> 03:40:23.840]  that's a true story look into it uh buddy you're the man thanks for calling next we're gonna uh talk
[03:40:23.840 --> 03:40:30.400]  to uh kelly from colorado what's up kelly from colorado hey hey my brother um first off on my
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:36.160]  preferences i've been at uh info wars fans since 2006 i buy all the products so this is not a dog on
[03:40:36.160 --> 03:40:43.520]  alex so i'm huge fans but look at what is going on i mean i'm calling you because i know you can
[03:40:43.520 --> 03:40:49.120]  talk about this um look at what omar did i mean we'll talk about words look at what the word
[03:40:49.120 --> 03:40:54.640]  anti-Semitic is now if you criticize is real you're an anti-Semitic what other country
[03:40:54.640 --> 03:41:01.440]  can you are you anti-Chinese if you criticize china alex criticize china every day we all
[03:41:01.440 --> 03:41:06.720]  criticize rusher whatever we know all that's more crap but the point is look who is in control and
[03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:12.560]  i'm not just freaking you know anti you don't have to do that i totally agree yeah you don't have to
[03:41:12.560 --> 03:41:18.640]  justify it one one habit we all need to stop breaking is saying i'm not one of these conspiracy
[03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:23.440]  theorists what you're saying is absolutely valid and you don't need to justify that because you
[03:41:23.440 --> 03:41:29.920]  are a conspiracy theorist all human beings are we all uh think in terms of this and you're absolutely
[03:41:29.920 --> 03:41:37.600]  right uh anti-semite used to mean someone who hated jews now it means someone jews hate or someone
[03:41:37.600 --> 03:41:44.000]  who criticizes anything related to jews it's nonsense and so people are terrified by it and
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:48.320]  when you're talking about this only that omar thing yeah it's being used as a backdoor way to
[03:41:48.320 --> 03:41:54.800]  restrict free speech and and yeah you you have the right to criticize jews and israel and you have
[03:41:54.800 --> 03:42:00.240]  the right to criticize the vatican what do you anti-popite i criticize the vatican all the time
[03:42:00.240 --> 03:42:07.040]  my whole theory is it's men in weird hats you know you got the pope uh you got you know the the
[03:42:07.040 --> 03:42:12.480]  russian jews with the giant fur hats you got the shriners with the weird uh the weird hats
[03:42:12.480 --> 03:42:18.720]  literally uh you know the the amish i called him the illumine amish but but bro cali you're
[03:42:18.720 --> 03:42:27.360]  you're right on the money and and um it's because anytime someone uses a made-up word anti-semite
[03:42:27.360 --> 03:42:36.400]  think about when there's an art piece of ronald mcdonald as christ being like urinated on is there
[03:42:36.400 --> 03:42:44.000]  a word for anti christian like anti anti jesus no of course not it's nonsense all right much love

[03:48:23.920 --> 03:48:28.880]  can you hear me yeah yeah i can hear you brother awesome hey i just want to give a shout out to
[03:48:28.880 --> 03:48:33.520]  all the bearers in the chat room on the one benjamin clips first oh yeah and that's run
[03:48:33.520 --> 03:48:37.680]  by bass taxon he's a great dude yeah we're having a good chat in there they're awesome
[03:48:37.680 --> 03:48:43.920]  and uh thank you for everything you've taught me in the last six months i've grown so much it's
[03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:51.280]  insane um so i'll jump to the i'll cut to the chase here um a friend said to me it's incredibly
[03:48:51.280 --> 03:48:57.920]  easy to be a good person when goodness isn't tested would you for example save a jew in world
[03:48:57.920 --> 03:49:04.160]  war two if you have the possibility i answered with i honestly answered with i don't want to find out
[03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:10.080]  so um would you still be a good person if the risk of being good could hurt you
[03:49:12.400 --> 03:49:16.640]  that well that's the whole question good doesn't mean anything if it's not tested
[03:49:16.640 --> 03:49:21.920]  and i saw that in the commie world and one of the reasons that i have such hard line ethics is
[03:49:21.920 --> 03:49:26.720]  because my my town is the only town in america that took in jews during the world war two
[03:49:26.720 --> 03:49:32.640]  swig on york and it was only 900 total for the whole country so the whole narrative about uh
[03:49:32.640 --> 03:49:40.880]  fighting hitler about the holocaust still nonsense and it was in 1944 and so um i studied it a lot in
[03:49:40.880 --> 03:49:44.880]  college you know why didn't more people act why didn't more people save people in the
[03:49:44.880 --> 03:49:49.840]  holodomor why didn't more people save people in the armenian genocide and all this stuff and
[03:49:50.960 --> 03:49:57.120]  your question is exactly right and i faced that as a comedian where in hollywood i experienced that
[03:49:57.120 --> 03:50:02.960]  i you know my face is painted on the wall of the hollywood impromptu so when people say you know
[03:50:02.960 --> 03:50:09.040]  you're your has been comedian you're you are disgrace no when i stood up against transgender
[03:50:09.040 --> 03:50:18.160]  kids they had just painted me on the wall okay so what i faced was exactly that where it's everybody
[03:50:18.160 --> 03:50:24.640]  it enjoys the freedom until it's tested and freedom comes from self-restraint freedom comes
[03:50:24.640 --> 03:50:30.640]  from sacrifice and of course you have to um like like that's seen in braveheart that's in braveheart
[03:50:30.640 --> 03:50:36.160]  is perfect logos right where it's like he's about to be executed and they're whispering in his ear
[03:50:36.160 --> 03:50:42.000]  like if you just renounce renounce what you've done we'll give you drugs to stop the pain and
[03:50:42.000 --> 03:50:47.200]  what does he do he says freedom freedom in that moment came from his own death his own sacrifice
[03:50:47.200 --> 03:50:53.840]  without sacrifice there is no freedom like my dog is a great peering he's a great dude named george
[03:50:53.840 --> 03:51:00.000]  but he's always be lining to the neighbor's house who has a doberman that's always in heat just a real
[03:51:00.640 --> 03:51:06.640]  w h o r e if you know what i'm saying so i can't let him off leash in my yard because he hasn't
[03:51:06.640 --> 03:51:14.400]  exuded enough restraint and self uh i'm not gonna call it self punishment but just uh
[03:51:14.400 --> 03:51:19.760]  uh you know it would feel a lot better if he's deep in a doberman but uh he hasn't shown that he's
[03:51:19.760 --> 03:51:24.240]  capable of resisting so i can't give him freedom yet it's the same with our nation it's the same
[03:51:24.240 --> 03:51:31.360]  with everything it's like people aren't willing to simply stand up and say no the real n word is no
[03:51:32.560 --> 03:51:39.280]  oh that's george right there yeah i'm a beautiful wife so to your question here's the irony and here's
[03:51:39.280 --> 03:51:46.480]  the thing that you that it doesn't reveal itself until you actually do it is when you show self
[03:51:46.480 --> 03:51:52.320]  sacrifice when you stand up for something bigger than yourself when you actually like when i was
[03:51:52.320 --> 03:51:59.680]  hauling brush for 20 an hour after making just ungodly sums of money from corrupt Hollywood
[03:51:59.680 --> 03:52:06.640]  because of my ethics my life got better that's the thing that you have to understand is it's not
[03:52:06.640 --> 03:52:14.000]  really self-sacrifice to uh figure out what you believe and put something above your own appetites
[03:52:14.720 --> 03:52:17.920]  because we all have appetites that's why we're not our own gods that's why
[03:52:17.920 --> 03:52:25.520]  Luciferianism does not work you can't cheat truth you can't do a little knee now to play play ball
[03:52:25.520 --> 03:52:31.520]  and then later you'll tell the hard truth when you get in no i lost a book deal with norton right
[03:52:31.520 --> 03:52:37.280]  they give me like 60 grand that they took it back because i wouldn't stop calling lina dunham a c u n
[03:52:37.280 --> 03:52:45.680]  next tuesday right so uh and that's prestige you know they published guns germs and steel all of
[03:52:45.680 --> 03:52:51.120]  you know all of michael louis's books and people close to me were like just play ball now so you
[03:52:51.120 --> 03:52:56.320]  can get that credit and then later i'm like once you kneel you never get up and when i did that i
[03:52:56.320 --> 03:53:01.600]  thought that i would be destroyed and in fact i now make a great living sitting in my backyard
[03:53:01.600 --> 03:53:06.640]  talking to people i relate to with my growing family and my dogs i hope that answers your
[03:53:06.640 --> 03:53:13.440]  question steve from canada you're the man let's talk to roberto in texas hey oh and i'm a big fan
[03:53:13.440 --> 03:53:19.120]  i'm glad uh alex don't have you on at the great spot uh yeah my name is dr robert i'm a writer
[03:53:19.120 --> 03:53:23.600]  i'm calling from galton texas and i wanted to uh talk a little bit not too much about you were
[03:53:23.600 --> 03:53:29.600]  talking about definitions this morning uh yeah and and what i learned is actually a very important
[03:53:29.600 --> 03:53:34.320]  class i had in college i took a professional aspect it was a philosophy for engineers and uh
[03:53:34.880 --> 03:53:40.560]  basically what i learned in that class was is that most people and i would say most most americans
[03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:46.320]  we all agree on on the same we all kind of agree on the same issues we all agree on the issues
[03:53:46.320 --> 03:53:51.920]  what most people argue about though are actually the definitions they're not actually arguing over
[03:53:51.920 --> 03:53:56.800]  the issues they're actually arguing over definitions and the good example is for example uh let's say
[03:53:56.800 --> 03:54:02.320]  gay marriage right back in the day so uh people really didn't have problems with two guys getting
[03:54:02.320 --> 03:54:08.240]  together and and living together but what people had problems with though was calling that marriage
[03:54:08.240 --> 03:54:12.960]  marriage by definition was a man and a woman so people would get all you know angry and
[03:54:12.960 --> 03:54:17.360]  fight over you know you know but they weren't really fighting over the gay men they're fighting
[03:54:17.360 --> 03:54:22.480]  i just kind of wanted to talk to you about that a little bit most people in life you you realize
[03:54:22.480 --> 03:54:26.800]  they're arguing over definition and when you get a person on it you say hey you know what the
[03:54:26.800 --> 03:54:32.000]  definition they don't want to tell you the definition dude i did uh that's that's a brilliant
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:37.920]  observation by the way and um i did a whole video for prairie university called uh i literally
[03:54:37.920 --> 03:54:43.520]  don't remember it's basically how to argue with a leftist or why i can't remember it's fairly recent
[03:54:43.520 --> 03:54:51.760]  but i think the point you're getting at is most people agree on goals and they're arguing over
[03:54:51.760 --> 03:54:57.600]  how to get to that goal and that gay marriage thing is a perfect example so most people the
[03:54:57.600 --> 03:55:04.160]  reality of it is people were arguing about the state's role in taxation and uh because when i
[03:55:04.160 --> 03:55:11.840]  was for gay marriage i thought it was an issue of deathbed inheritance between life partners and um
[03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:17.760]  um you know rather or not you can legally have the protections of a man and a woman but i was never
[03:55:17.760 --> 03:55:24.960]  on board with saying it's the same as marriage the word marriage between male and female you know
[03:55:24.960 --> 03:55:31.760]  and it's very similar with like gun gun uh rights and gun confiscations and gun control there's
[03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:37.600]  some people that look at guns and they see crime you know but that's not reality and i think what
[03:55:37.600 --> 03:55:45.360]  you're saying is absolutely true where it's like if you identify your terms first so many more people
[03:55:45.360 --> 03:55:50.960]  would not argue and i think that's one reason why there is an element of people that keep
[03:55:50.960 --> 03:55:57.200]  misrepresenting words so that uh no one can have an honest conversation because you're right most
[03:55:57.200 --> 03:56:03.920]  people have the same goals we're now seeing leftism which isn't the same goals as most people they want
[03:56:03.920 --> 03:56:09.760]  to see um any distinctions between male and female destroyed any boundaries between nations destroyed
[03:56:09.760 --> 03:56:16.960]  the family unit is slavery they get to be their own god stuff like that but i what you're saying
[03:56:16.960 --> 03:56:21.520]  is absolutely correct when you're dealing with people that that have the same sense of logo
