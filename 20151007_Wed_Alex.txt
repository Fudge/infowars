[00:00.000 --> 00:12.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.920 --> 00:21.360]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.360 --> 00:33.320]  jones look at this headline russian jets intercept u.s. predator drones over
[00:33.320 --> 00:40.840]  syria fox news linking from drug report dot com that's the type of craziness
[00:40.840 --> 00:47.280]  that is going on in this world and then in the midst of it all we have one of the
[00:47.280 --> 00:52.080]  biggest trending stories on google facebook reddit all the big sites it's
[00:52.080 --> 00:59.400]  in the top five drudge appearing out of nowhere in central texas into our studio
[00:59.400 --> 01:07.640]  yesterday simply amazing the interview is in hundreds of publications now
[01:07.640 --> 01:13.640]  scores of newspapers are playing clip seven on cnn fox you name it back so
[01:13.640 --> 01:19.000]  many places are covering it i don't even know where to respond this is the
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.800]  opposite of an ego issue for me it was very fun it was a enlightening
[01:25.800 --> 01:30.520]  informative drudge is a true sweetheart i mean really just a classy guy that's
[01:30.520 --> 01:36.640]  what everybody that knows him well has told me and it certainly is true but it
[01:36.640 --> 01:43.600]  is surreal and i didn't want to come into work today because i guess you could
[01:43.600 --> 01:49.680]  call it shell shock because i mean i'll be in a restaurant see some top a list
[01:49.680 --> 01:52.840]  hollywood star and i really care less like to almost don't want to be around
[01:52.840 --> 01:56.800]  it because it's such a distraction and people act so weird but i am star struck
[01:56.800 --> 02:00.320]  by people like mad drudge when i say people there aren't really there isn't
[02:00.320 --> 02:04.720]  really anybody else that is his peer when it comes to covering globalism the
[02:04.720 --> 02:12.480]  new world order all these real things that are happening and so i felt like i
[02:12.480 --> 02:15.360]  should have some reflection on what i was going to cover today i thought about
[02:15.360 --> 02:20.800]  a few hours last night a little bit of research couple hours this morning but
[02:20.800 --> 02:24.240]  just got caught in the new show of all the other news and then i get up here on
[02:24.240 --> 02:28.960]  here and i just don't even know what to say because it's bigger than just mad
[02:28.960 --> 02:36.000]  drudge coming and visiting info wars or the media's response then its heresy to
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.160]  be around a political leper such as myself because they're the bosses and
[02:40.160 --> 02:46.480]  they dictate who you talk to who you communicate with in this new dark age
[02:46.480 --> 02:51.920]  attempt to bring in total control over information
[02:51.920 --> 02:57.440]  it's the larger issue for me of the responsibility to have such a large
[02:57.440 --> 03:00.480]  audience and to know so many interesting people are
[03:00.480 --> 03:08.160]  tuning in it is crushingly humble it is humbling
[03:08.160 --> 03:13.920]  and so i just feel like i need time to try to
[03:14.480 --> 03:20.560]  gauge things and assemble the meaning of what's happening in the world
[03:20.560 --> 03:24.160]  not just with info wars not just with drudge report not just with
[03:24.160 --> 03:28.800]  the russian fighter planes and the drones and the the fluoride and the water
[03:28.800 --> 03:33.120]  and the gmo and the open borders and obama saying nobody wants your guns
[03:33.120 --> 03:36.640]  conspiracy theorist you know we're not coming for your guns while
[03:36.640 --> 03:40.080]  they're openly on cnn saying ban the guns
[03:40.080 --> 03:43.520]  and everywhere the globalists are in control they ban the guns i mean it's
[03:43.520 --> 03:47.520]  just crazy
[03:47.520 --> 03:54.400]  that i'm a major leader in the fight against global tyranny
[03:54.400 --> 03:58.720]  that's very scary and you know drudge didn't tell me that i couldn't repeat
[03:58.720 --> 04:03.680]  a lot of the things he told me last night in a lengthy dinner we had but
[04:03.680 --> 04:06.960]  he was just pointing out the things i point out as well that there's just not
[04:06.960 --> 04:11.360]  that many true contrarian
[04:11.360 --> 04:17.040]  conservative constitutionalist libertarians free marketers
[04:17.040 --> 04:24.000]  out there there isn't the grassroots around the world in the country but
[04:26.160 --> 04:30.640]  there isn't even really any replacements for a lot of the folks that are
[04:30.640 --> 04:35.520]  getting old and then tyranny and all the
[04:35.520 --> 04:40.560]  bizarreness of it and just the the running wild of the corrupt class
[04:40.560 --> 04:43.280]  whether it be at the grassroots or the highest levels
[04:43.280 --> 04:50.160]  is just a spectacle a ritual of freaks and criminals and mentally
[04:50.160 --> 04:53.680]  ill people having their way with us and drudge is right
[04:53.680 --> 04:59.360]  america is very sick europe is very sick the world is very sick
[04:59.360 --> 05:02.720]  presidential candidates today strategize over every last
[05:02.720 --> 05:06.240]  detail of a candidate's image especially an identity candidate
[05:06.240 --> 05:10.240]  like hillary how important is it for there to be a woman president in the
[05:10.240 --> 05:13.360]  united states national journal has pointed out that
[05:13.360 --> 05:18.720]  candidates now view soundtracks as a key part of that carefully crafted image
[05:18.720 --> 05:22.160]  so maybe hillary should choose a campaign song that plays
[05:22.160 --> 05:29.200]  against type you know humble i'm sorry hillary has paid a consulting
[05:29.200 --> 05:33.680]  firm nine thousand dollars to create a soundtrack for her campaign
[05:33.680 --> 05:37.040]  i just don't think people would believe this song though
[05:37.040 --> 05:41.200]  she's being abandoned by unions by multinational corporate donors who are
[05:41.200 --> 05:44.720]  worried 44 percent of her twitter followers
[05:44.720 --> 05:50.960]  1.4 million are fake maybe her campaign theme should be

[08:14.320 --> 08:22.640]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:22.640 --> 08:29.440]  one of the greatest works of literature is of course a tale of two cities
[08:29.440 --> 08:33.120]  i haven't read that book since i was in high school but i tend to read it again
[08:33.120 --> 08:38.000]  but i've read the opening passage many times to myself
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.320]  it was the best of times it was the worst of times and then it goes on to
[08:42.320 --> 08:46.320]  basically repeat that statement in different ways for an entire page
[08:46.320 --> 08:50.320]  and the more i live the longer i live the
[08:50.320 --> 08:54.400]  i come to the realization that is so true
[08:54.400 --> 08:57.760]  and you've got to go back and read great literature because as you get older
[08:57.760 --> 09:00.960]  you see the different angles of it that as a young man
[09:00.960 --> 09:06.080]  or as a child you obviously didn't see and i know i'm just stating basic known
[09:06.080 --> 09:10.400]  truths of humanity but under this globalist
[09:10.400 --> 09:16.000]  new world order scientific dictatorship common sense
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.200]  is being attacked it is being overthrown and these basic truths are not being
[09:21.200 --> 09:24.960]  stated and said
[09:24.960 --> 09:32.240]  because for this system to succeed reality and common sense must be overthrown
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.520]  and we stand on the precipice here of a stairway to heaven
[09:37.520 --> 09:42.480]  a stairway to things so fantastic the eye is not seen the ear is not heard
[09:42.480 --> 09:50.160]  how amazing humanity can become the the the heights we can reach
[09:50.160 --> 09:52.960]  we also stand on the knife edge of the precipice
[09:52.960 --> 10:00.480]  leaning towards hell cold and hateful greedy
[10:00.480 --> 10:03.040]  petulant
[10:04.720 --> 10:09.440]  and it is awesome it's awesome to be awake it's awesome to be involved
[10:09.440 --> 10:14.400]  it's awesome to conservatively have let's not exaggerate because i keep
[10:14.400 --> 10:17.040]  saying three million that's like a five-year-old number
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.720]  three million terrestrial listeners a day
[10:20.720 --> 10:26.800]  on amfm shortwave things like that microbes pirates it's a lot bigger
[10:26.800 --> 10:29.840]  but a couple million more conservatively with the streams
[10:29.840 --> 10:34.320]  the podcast everything else i mean that's awesome
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.720]  that i speak to five million people and i'm not up here bragging
[10:38.720 --> 10:41.760]  that oh i've got a big audience i'm so cool
[10:41.760 --> 10:45.520]  it's actually frightening knowing that i'm a stuttering
[10:45.520 --> 10:53.200]  stammering mind racing friendly weasel not a bad weasel a loving friendly
[10:53.200 --> 10:56.160]  weasel still a weasel
[10:56.720 --> 11:00.000]  and by that i'm not weaseling anybody i'm kind of a weaseling in my own life
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.400]  just weaseling around but weasel or not i can see the
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.200]  wolves coming for everybody and it freaks me out
[11:09.920 --> 11:14.960]  i'm threatened i'm i'm scared and when i say i don't have fear i don't have
[11:14.960 --> 11:18.160]  the manifest fear people think of running and hiding
[11:18.160 --> 11:22.480]  fighting is fear folks fighting you fight
[11:22.480 --> 11:27.040]  by running or by fighting fight or flight
[11:27.040 --> 11:30.720]  and so it doesn't come across in my psyche as fear it come
[11:30.720 --> 11:36.800]  comes across as confidence bravada arrogance hatred
[11:36.800 --> 11:44.320]  anger viciousness nastiness and it's because i'm hurting inside
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.800]  i have deep empathy because any creature that doesn't have empathy is not an
[11:48.800 --> 11:51.600]  advanced creature
[11:55.200 --> 11:59.440]  that's just a basic of being conscious and having any decency in your
[11:59.440 --> 12:02.960]  programming that that you have empathy
[12:02.960 --> 12:06.560]  and we're losing our empathy around the world i mean i see headlines
[12:06.560 --> 12:11.040]  that are confirmed where they're ripping the livers and kidneys and corning is
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.840]  out of living patience in china and then keeping them alive till the next
[12:15.840 --> 12:20.160]  person lands in japan from them from america or europe
[12:20.160 --> 12:23.920]  then they go take out the last kidney and take the heart out in the liver
[12:23.920 --> 12:27.920]  i mean that's beyond a science fiction movie like
[12:27.920 --> 12:32.400]  coma in the 1970s that neighbor kids showed me that scared the
[12:32.400 --> 12:36.240]  daylights out of me when i was like five years old
[12:40.880 --> 12:44.560]  and this was sold to transplant tourists that's the daily mail
[12:44.560 --> 12:48.960]  and i already knew that it's just i'd tell people and i'm not bragging you
[12:48.960 --> 12:52.480]  already knew that it was in the fall on gong newspapers 15 years ago
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.040]  the epoch times but i've got all this world news to cover
[12:57.040 --> 13:01.840]  tons of it but at the end of the day
[13:03.120 --> 13:08.080]  obama wants us to get upset about a mentally ill pill head
[13:08.080 --> 13:10.640]  who we now know is on a whole bunch of different drugs
[13:10.640 --> 13:14.880]  prescription drugs in his own words i take so many pills i just take five of
[13:14.880 --> 13:17.120]  each
[13:18.160 --> 13:22.880]  i take antidepressants i take anti-psychotics like lithium i live in
[13:22.880 --> 13:27.360]  my mother's basement
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.440]  and the question is why are we creating people like this we need guns
[13:31.440 --> 13:35.040]  as individuals who've done nothing wrong to protect ourselves
[13:35.040 --> 13:38.960]  from lunatics like that who always attack gun-free zones
[13:38.960 --> 13:42.880]  because they're cowards i mean if that son of a bitch came here i'd blow his
[13:42.880 --> 13:46.400]  ass away and i'm not trying to act like a tough
[13:46.400 --> 13:50.480]  guy that's a normal response
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.360]  they talk about grown men at the military
[13:55.360 --> 14:02.800]  facility the va troop education center that was
[14:02.800 --> 14:05.760]  next door to the university and that they tried to get out and that
[14:05.760 --> 14:11.440]  security guards wouldn't let them and i'm surprised they didn't just push them
[14:11.440 --> 14:14.080]  out of the way because these guys had guns and i'm not saying
[14:14.080 --> 14:18.800]  i'm not judging them but but you had vets inside you know charged and one guy
[14:18.800 --> 14:22.080]  got shot five five times
[14:22.080 --> 14:26.960]  i just wonder where we've gone as a society
[14:27.200 --> 14:31.680]  that people just submit to all of this my friend mike hanson the stories on
[14:31.680 --> 14:34.800]  info wars dot com
[14:34.960 --> 14:42.560]  who was the second producer of my access tv show after buckley
[14:42.560 --> 14:47.600]  and who did camera work for me for about six seven eight years and is in a lot of
[14:47.600 --> 14:52.000]  my documentaries snuck into bohemian grove with me
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.200]  mike hanson called me frantically a few days ago and but he didn't want to come
[14:55.200 --> 14:57.520]  on air yet he said he was in speak the city council
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.040]  there's a guy with no criminal record army veteran father of multiple children
[15:01.040 --> 15:06.880]  you married 40-something years just a great guy's dad's a
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.120]  was famously part of the people that tried to take out the tower shooter
[15:11.120 --> 15:15.440]  ut his brother's a senior police officer highly decorated in austin
[15:15.440 --> 15:19.040]  just he's a really good guy and he said he called me
[15:19.040 --> 15:22.800]  last week i talked about it on air and he just said there's swat teams
[15:22.800 --> 15:25.760]  everywhere there's swat teaming hundreds of houses
[15:25.760 --> 15:29.440]  they don't have warrants they have rubber stamp warrants
[15:29.440 --> 15:33.600]  they federalized gonzalez and this is a town where his german side of the
[15:33.600 --> 15:37.360]  family the wolves uh the wolves basically were
[15:37.360 --> 15:40.880]  you know early immigrants too it's where the texas revolution
[15:40.880 --> 15:44.960]  started as well and when his grandfather died he moved
[15:44.960 --> 15:48.560]  down there and took over a hotel a little hotel and a bunch of
[15:48.560 --> 15:51.440]  houses he owned
[15:51.760 --> 16:00.000]  kind of blue collar new vorice hard work in folks and so it happens to his
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  renters it happens to people he sold houses to it it's happened to people
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.680]  he knows uh it's happened to people he knows
[16:07.680 --> 16:12.400]  where they swat teamed horse stables where he keeps his two horses
[16:12.400 --> 16:15.840]  were pointing guns at people and he he pulled up while they had
[16:15.840 --> 16:18.720]  a family out with little kids pointing guns at him
[16:18.720 --> 16:21.760]  and so he was flipping on the phone to me last week and i said you better be
[16:21.760 --> 16:24.640]  careful mike they are they are taking over towns all over the
[16:24.640 --> 16:28.400]  country and acid for for sure seizing and they are
[16:28.400 --> 16:31.360]  taking your town over because that private properties got big oil and gas
[16:31.360 --> 16:34.800]  wells on it that's the houses are swat teaming folks that just got
[16:34.800 --> 16:39.120]  oil and gas money and they're taking over taking over everywhere
[16:39.120 --> 16:43.040]  and he went to city council spoke for three minutes
[16:43.040 --> 16:47.520]  was finishing a statement and the police chief arrest him
[16:47.520 --> 16:50.960]  and then he doesn't resist him and they charged him
[16:50.960 --> 16:55.280]  i just talked to the family this morning called his cell phone
[16:55.920 --> 16:59.600]  and talked to multiple members of his family and he has now been charged
[16:59.600 --> 17:06.400]  with disrupting a public meeting or procession and resisting arrest which
[17:06.400 --> 17:09.840]  could be a felony they haven't gotten it yet from the judge
[17:09.840 --> 17:13.600]  and now he's being held and they're saying he won't bond out why no why
[17:13.600 --> 17:17.120]  they're probably giving him a personal recognizance bond
[17:17.120 --> 17:21.200]  that basically agrees that he's done these things
[17:21.200 --> 17:25.760]  that's how those read in most counties and cities now things are so fraudulent
[17:25.760 --> 17:29.520]  but there's all these big global stories it's just there's an example
[17:29.520 --> 17:33.840]  someone i know is in a town where and this is a pretty big town now
[17:33.840 --> 17:38.160]  where he says no matter where he drives there are
[17:38.160 --> 17:43.120]  armored trailers and people with black uniforms raiding houses
[17:43.120 --> 17:47.200]  it's basically a roundup and this is how they do it town by town by town
[17:47.200 --> 17:50.560]  and they do it with the drug war when the government
[17:50.560 --> 17:54.160]  the big banks that run the government are shipping the drugs in on record i mean
[17:54.160 --> 17:58.800]  they had congressional hearings in the 60s the 70s and in 1997
[17:58.800 --> 18:05.360]  with the cia inspector general admitting it but i don't need to hear it from
[18:05.360 --> 18:08.960]  them i've interviewed terry reid and i've
[18:08.960 --> 18:14.240]  interviewed the famous uh cia pilots
[18:14.400 --> 18:17.680]  and it goes beyond that
[18:19.600 --> 18:23.520]  i've had family personally that told me about it
[18:23.520 --> 18:27.360]  i'm not going to go any further i don't even want to know this stuff because i
[18:27.360 --> 18:32.320]  already know it all you know it's all dangerous it's all bad it's all evil
[18:32.320 --> 18:36.400]  and of course they don't just stop with the drug dealing they run the kids now
[18:36.400 --> 18:40.800]  the snuff films and the argument is well we run it so we control it keep
[18:40.800 --> 18:43.840]  control of it bull you're growing the crime
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.640]  you're growing the culture of corruption you're growing the whole
[18:48.640 --> 18:53.440]  stinking thing until the entire culture implodes and they say because he kept
[18:53.440 --> 18:59.520]  speaking that's resisting he resisted them in no way
[19:00.560 --> 19:04.000]  but it becomes this fetish that oh you resisted the police
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.520]  so now we're going to charge you and that's how the police dishonor themselves
[19:07.520 --> 19:14.000]  is by false charges and just throwing charges on people to punish them
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.400]  you're not going to punish mike now you're he's going to end up putting all
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.160]  his money and energy into running for city council
[19:22.160 --> 19:26.000]  and he's going to come after all of you
[19:26.720 --> 19:30.480]  politically and you've only made it 50 times worse
[19:30.480 --> 19:33.920]  and that's where tyrants miscalculate throughout history
[19:33.920 --> 19:38.800]  when we come back we're going to get into the masses of important news
[19:38.800 --> 19:43.520]  obviously on the election front on france's
[19:43.520 --> 19:47.840]  president saying muslim rift threatens total war and then europe's a total war
[19:47.840 --> 19:51.760]  so his answer is bringing unlimited islamic radicals and then capitulate
[19:51.760 --> 19:54.720]  to them that's his answer uh supporters introduce
[19:54.720 --> 19:58.320]  hillary in iowa by declaring who cares about email and Benghazi scandals and
[19:58.320 --> 20:01.840]  more most of us already know that taking a fish oil
[20:01.840 --> 20:05.200]  supplement to boost omega threes is a good idea but did you know that about
[20:05.200 --> 20:08.240]  60 of americans are actually deficient in omega threes

[20:12.400 --> 20:15.600]  and the remaining 75 percent is undesirable fish fat
[20:15.600 --> 20:18.800]  heck did you know that more than 90 percent of fish oil supplements sold in

[25:11.840 --> 25:16.480]  for the honest world to feel
[25:16.480 --> 25:22.960]  poncho met his match you know on the deserts
[25:22.960 --> 25:27.600]  that's the way it goes nobody heard you know i think we really can't play the
[25:27.600 --> 25:30.000]  type of bumper music because i just can't turn it off
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.680]  oh but that's the way it goes that's the way
[25:33.680 --> 25:37.920]  let me do this i'm gonna discipline myself i told drudge last night
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.320]  that the main thing i'm mad at myself about that as the years go on
[25:42.320 --> 25:46.880]  i get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse about covering
[25:46.880 --> 25:51.120]  the wide spectrum of news and just giving a brief nice little snippet
[25:51.120 --> 25:57.520]  of context to it and it is because i tend to already have looked at it all
[25:57.520 --> 26:00.880]  and read over it and then when i come back it's a second or third look
[26:00.880 --> 26:04.880]  and then it's not fresh and dynamic and we couldn't decide talking about it with
[26:04.880 --> 26:09.280]  he and one of his editors a really nice fellow as well really smart fellow
[26:09.280 --> 26:12.640]  how you do that and they were agreeing that it's it's interesting how that
[26:12.640 --> 26:15.200]  first look that first thought is the most
[26:15.200 --> 26:22.240]  incisive and the most decisive and then it's it's it's hard to then
[26:22.240 --> 26:26.080]  regurgitate it back up because we're not scripting this it's the
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.000]  opposite of a teleprompter polished transmission
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.360]  that's what talk radio is that we've now brought to television
[26:35.360 --> 26:38.560]  14 15 years ago
[26:39.360 --> 26:42.800]  so when i start the next segment i'm going to really try to be focused in
[26:42.800 --> 26:48.800]  discipline for 18 minutes and plunge into the news and covered it
[26:48.800 --> 26:51.600]  all and there's a lot of it france's uh
[26:51.600 --> 26:55.280]  president says muslim rift threatens total war
[26:55.280 --> 26:59.040]  supporters introduced hillary in isle up by declaring who cares about been
[26:59.040 --> 27:02.880]  gauzy scandals we've got that video matt drudge
[27:02.880 --> 27:08.560]  challenges obama give up your guns that's a story i want a red link and put at
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.200]  the top because that's probably what we should have
[27:11.200 --> 27:13.760]  put out first yesterday everybody did a great job but
[27:13.760 --> 27:17.840]  that's really the biggest news we start a meme and start hammering
[27:17.840 --> 27:21.760]  and start pushing obama turn in your guns obama turn in your guns
[27:21.760 --> 27:25.680]  hillary turn in your guns paul when i talked to him was jogging in the
[27:25.680 --> 27:29.520]  in the hills outside london but when he gets back
[27:29.520 --> 27:33.360]  we're going to start a hashtag we're going to start a meme
[27:33.360 --> 27:37.840]  attaching it to this drudge article and we're going to red link it on info wars
[27:37.840 --> 27:40.400]  dot com and prison planet dot com and on facebook and twitter
[27:40.400 --> 27:42.480]  and everywhere else hopefully drudge a link to it
[27:42.480 --> 27:46.160]  it's already got like four links to us today but this is really important
[27:46.160 --> 27:50.880]  to push and drive this to the top and speaking of that
[27:50.880 --> 27:54.400]  the number three trend on facebook right now
[27:54.400 --> 27:57.440]  is matt drudge on the show yesterday i think we have a
[27:57.440 --> 28:00.640]  screenshot of that matt drudge political commentator
[28:00.640 --> 28:04.160]  criticizes democratic leaders and interview with alex jones
[28:04.160 --> 28:08.080]  and and that's just one article that's trending
[28:08.080 --> 28:11.680]  uh third there's a bunch of other articles in the top 20 or so
[28:11.680 --> 28:14.960]  uh same thing it's trending towards number one on google when i looked this
[28:14.960 --> 28:17.760]  morning uh but i've caught google over the years
[28:17.760 --> 28:20.240]  now when we've got something on to the top they just remove it
[28:20.240 --> 28:23.600]  facebook does that as well and drudge would say well why are you then on their
[28:23.600 --> 28:28.000]  platform giving them power i agree the average person
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.440]  would do better with their photo blog or their poetry or whatever
[28:31.440 --> 28:35.360]  creating their own website and promoting it but
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.360]  you promote it on the enemy channels and then you drive them to yourself
[28:39.360 --> 28:42.800]  i understand that matt did it before anything existed
[28:42.800 --> 28:46.320]  so it's kind of easy when you're there at the beginning of the internet
[28:46.320 --> 28:49.600]  proliferating of course i'm not saying it's easy it's super hard to be that
[28:49.600 --> 28:53.360]  person that does it it's just it's kind of like
[28:53.360 --> 28:59.680]  almost giving promethean fire so he's there giving promethean fire
[28:59.680 --> 29:02.720]  so he can say oh i don't need anybody and i understand that
[29:02.720 --> 29:06.560]  that's why drudge is so special and i'm not just saying that because he's the
[29:06.560 --> 29:09.840]  number one news uh political site in the world
[29:09.840 --> 29:13.280]  that's admitted even by the new york times that
[29:13.280 --> 29:16.720]  it gets more traffic than all the big sites combined
[29:16.720 --> 29:21.360]  it's just that i don't know if i disagree with him it's just a different
[29:21.360 --> 29:25.200]  kind of spin on it that yes we've gotten to a point
[29:25.200 --> 29:28.800]  where we don't need facebook or twitter or youtube
[29:28.800 --> 29:33.280]  but if i can go on facebook and talk to 100 000 people at once with a video
[29:33.280 --> 29:37.920]  and then that goes viral everywhere else i'm using the enemy
[29:37.920 --> 29:41.600]  weapons that i've basically captured and i will use
[29:41.600 --> 29:45.280]  their munitions against them to blow up their operations politically
[29:45.280 --> 29:49.680]  and that's what i do it's just weapons to me we're on the march
[29:49.680 --> 29:59.760]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:59.760 --> 30:03.360]  matt drudge challenges barack obama to give up
[30:03.360 --> 30:06.800]  his guns the news icon calls on the president
[30:06.800 --> 30:11.200]  and hillary clinton to relinquish their secret service protection i
[30:11.200 --> 30:14.160]  challenge hillary take away your secret service
[30:14.160 --> 30:18.480]  take it away now have no security around you have no guns around you hillary

[30:30.480 --> 30:33.760]  the white house grounds obama you know what would happen in 30 seconds
[30:33.760 --> 30:38.320]  most of those people would no longer be on planet earth so they're asking us
[30:38.320 --> 30:42.000]  to drop our guns and to drop our security measures
[30:42.000 --> 30:45.840]  or or what so this thing is very real
[30:45.840 --> 30:49.520]  and i don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick

[33:33.840 --> 33:39.760]  broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:39.760 --> 33:42.880]  during the break uh we came up with some different
[33:42.880 --> 33:46.160]  hashtags that we're going to send out attached to the article
[33:46.160 --> 33:49.360]  that's red linked on info wars dot com
[33:49.360 --> 33:55.040]  mat drudge challenges obama give up your guns
[33:55.040 --> 34:00.640]  and we're going to add the hashtag seize obama's guns
[34:00.640 --> 34:04.800]  hashtag seize obama's guns
[34:05.520 --> 34:10.720]  hashtag we're also going to be putting out obama drop your guns
[34:10.720 --> 34:14.560]  and then richard i didn't tell you i put you on air see me get to a mic
[34:14.560 --> 34:18.320]  you came with a really good one that i simultaneously or just before it come
[34:18.320 --> 34:21.360]  up with as well but forgot to tell lewis what was the one you came up with was
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.120]  real simple hashtag disarm obama that's it
[34:25.120 --> 34:29.600]  hashtag disarm obama so hashtag disarm obama
[34:29.600 --> 34:32.800]  hashtag obama drop your guns is another one
[34:32.800 --> 34:37.760]  and hashtag confiscate obama's guns and then you can also say confiscate
[34:37.760 --> 34:42.000]  hillary's guns uh or no secret service obama
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.240]  i mean we're going to put it out at our little
[34:46.240 --> 34:50.480]  twitter account and it's little because we came to it late
[34:50.480 --> 34:54.000]  and don't buy millions of fake you can buy a million
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.960]  for like five thousand dollars you can be like hillary and you know buy
[34:56.960 --> 35:00.560]  yourself 40 million of them or the first lady and buy yourself
[35:00.560 --> 35:03.040]  you know 20 million or whatever she's got and it's admitted they're almost all
[35:03.040 --> 35:06.640]  fake they had big third party groups go and look
[35:06.640 --> 35:10.480]  at them i mean i just won't do that see we have
[35:10.480 --> 35:13.680]  millions of facebook likes those are real people and then they put some
[35:13.680 --> 35:16.800]  algorithm in as soon as we were racing up like a hundred thousand a month a few
[35:16.800 --> 35:19.120]  years ago they just boom stopped us dead in our
[35:19.120 --> 35:23.280]  tracks don't let us share our stuff and i understand that's part of their
[35:23.280 --> 35:26.480]  money making program but still we are there
[35:26.480 --> 35:33.360]  they're using us we're using them it's not uh symbiotic i will tell you
[35:33.360 --> 35:37.040]  but the relationship i have with drudge is symbiotic in that we want freedom
[35:37.040 --> 35:41.360]  we want liberty and so we cross promote because we're basically in the same boat
[35:41.360 --> 35:45.440]  not wanting to go under total tyranny now i said i'm going to go through a bunch
[35:45.440 --> 35:49.360]  of news but what i want to do first uh obviously is get into the matt drudge
[35:49.360 --> 35:52.400]  interview and play some of these clips from yesterday because these are so
[35:52.400 --> 35:56.080]  incredibly important
[35:57.200 --> 36:02.720]  there are hundreds of articles out today and i don't normally cover info wars
[36:02.720 --> 36:05.520]  when we're in the news it's normally just some mindless attack piece
[36:05.520 --> 36:09.440]  but if you study this piece and you listen to what drudge has to say
[36:09.440 --> 36:12.480]  it really shows you how the media tries to spin things
[36:12.480 --> 36:16.000]  and how ridiculous they sound trying to criticize matt drudge
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.440]  because he's saying things that people across the political spectrum
[36:19.440 --> 36:22.640]  in major polls show they wholeheartedly agree with
[36:22.640 --> 36:26.640]  it's ridiculous matt drudge says when you're starving
[36:26.640 --> 36:31.200]  in the winter and you finally get to a a cabin with hot soup and chips
[36:31.200 --> 36:35.200]  or hot soup and you know bread it tastes great
[36:35.200 --> 36:38.800]  or it's refreshing or if you're in the desert matt drudge says
[36:38.800 --> 36:42.160]  if you've been marching for a day without water a big giant
[36:42.160 --> 36:46.720]  a glass of ice water uh isn't delicious isn't he a cook isn't he a
[36:46.720 --> 36:52.560]  conspiracy theorist matt drudge is crazy he says the ocean is blue
[36:52.560 --> 36:56.800]  and that ships sail on the seas i mean it's an attempt to say
[36:56.800 --> 37:00.400]  you're not allowed to have user opinions you're not allowed to speak out
[37:00.400 --> 37:05.440]  we're the controlled media we control reality only listen to us
[37:05.440 --> 37:09.120]  i personally this morning if you just type in matt drudge conspiracy matt
[37:09.120 --> 37:12.960]  drudge conspiracy theorist there are scores of articles saying
[37:12.960 --> 37:18.720]  matt drudge gives bizarre interview with looney with conspiracy theorist
[37:18.720 --> 37:24.320]  just um intending to again make people not listen to what he
[37:24.320 --> 37:26.960]  actually said there's the headline of the hovington post
[37:26.960 --> 37:30.880]  matt drudge gives a rare and really really weird interview
[37:30.880 --> 37:38.000]  to a conspiracy theorist what does that mean it means we control reality
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.200]  disregard disregard we are going to ridicule people
[37:41.200 --> 37:44.640]  and we're back in junior high now so don't actually listen to what
[37:44.640 --> 37:49.680]  they have to say don't actually uh no just sit back and feel
[37:49.680 --> 37:54.320]  powerful here's another one so long the folks that have written what five
[37:54.320 --> 38:01.760]  articles basically promoting pedophilia in the last few years
[38:01.760 --> 38:06.160]  hilariously paranoid matt drudge appears on conspiracy
[38:06.160 --> 38:11.360]  monger alex joneshow to slag salon and demand
[38:11.360 --> 38:15.840]  locations of hillary's lovers you know that might be the most sensational
[38:15.840 --> 38:20.400]  and dangerous thing that matt drudge did on the show yesterday
[38:20.400 --> 38:25.120]  was demand they roll out her lovers which it's admitted she chases women around
[38:25.120 --> 38:29.440]  at the white house more than clinton ever did i mean i've talked to folks that
[38:29.440 --> 38:32.320]  knew her back in the governor's office and and the word is she
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.480]  she got more skirt than than than bill did and listen here's the deal you're
[38:36.480 --> 38:40.000]  all proud of that listen i'm not judging you lady
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.160]  okay i mean you know the old joke that i'm a
[38:44.160 --> 38:48.160]  lesbian trapped in a man's body i understand but but if we're getting
[38:48.160 --> 38:51.680]  honest here you don't want folks to know about that
[38:51.680 --> 38:56.400]  so let's see your girlfriends let's roll them out we know who they are
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.880]  you guys can't keep your hands off each other so
[39:00.880 --> 39:04.720]  roll it out roll it out right now let's see it let's see it let's see it let's
[39:04.720 --> 39:07.520]  see it let's see it
[39:08.160 --> 39:11.920]  that's the kind of stuff they come after you for so the drudge interview number
[39:11.920 --> 39:15.040]  one was about courage and you know i'm sitting here about to say all this i
[39:15.040 --> 39:18.480]  don't even want to say it because it sounds
[39:19.840 --> 39:23.680]  grovely you know it sounds like i'm just laying on
[39:23.680 --> 39:28.720]  and buttering drudge up but it we look if it's no brag it's just fact
[39:28.720 --> 39:33.440]  if it is what it is you got to say it i don't like saying somebody like
[39:33.440 --> 39:36.560]  putin is making america look like idiots and making
[39:36.560 --> 39:41.600]  president obama look like a complete moron but it's true so i say it but again
[39:41.600 --> 39:46.240]  obama is there to make sure that happens i can pridefully say that matt
[39:46.240 --> 39:50.480]  drudge is super classy person has amazing courage and understands
[39:50.480 --> 39:54.000]  trying to build up other people in the fight for liberty
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.320]  and he wants to build up alternative media independent media and that's why
[39:58.320 --> 40:01.520]  he promotes people's youtube channels it's why he links to little guys and
[40:01.520 --> 40:05.360]  little gals because he instinctively knows the power
[40:05.360 --> 40:09.840]  is in we the people he's a real populist a real libertarian a real trailblazer
[40:09.840 --> 40:13.200]  and super smart and so that's why they demonize
[40:13.200 --> 40:17.200]  him and lie about him and attack him but still they can't bring him down and
[40:17.200 --> 40:21.360]  the stuff he was telling me he said some of it on air
[40:21.360 --> 40:26.160]  but how a supreme court justice he told me the whole story name everything i
[40:26.160 --> 40:28.560]  can't obviously repeat that he didn't say don't repeat it but i'm not going to
[40:28.560 --> 40:30.960]  repeat it
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.680]  how he was told point blank no they're they're moving in the next two years
[40:35.680 --> 40:41.200]  this was recently to vote to end the internet freedom and to ban libertarian
[40:41.200 --> 40:43.840]  and conservative talk radio internet everything i mean
[40:43.840 --> 40:47.760]  they're going to this is the plan the other justices are bragging they're
[40:47.760 --> 40:51.040]  ready it's a takeover
[40:51.120 --> 40:55.760]  and really that's why drudge came here was
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.360]  just to discuss the fact that
[41:00.080 --> 41:02.800]  it's like nazi germany's invading europe i mean
[41:02.800 --> 41:06.080]  this is a takedown of freedom all over the world there are resting people for
[41:06.080 --> 41:08.880]  their speech our media won't criticize china now
[41:08.880 --> 41:13.760]  for keeping people alive while they harvest their organs
[41:13.760 --> 41:17.360]  i mean they cut people's corneas off they take their kidney then they make
[41:17.360 --> 41:20.560]  them wait a month sometimes longer than they harvest the rest
[41:20.560 --> 41:25.360]  that's not even news anymore and we're doing the same stuff to babies here
[41:25.360 --> 41:29.440]  and they just sit there and laugh and go oh conspiracy theorist at plan parenthood
[41:29.440 --> 41:33.120]  when it's all admitted that's the only words you've got
[41:33.120 --> 41:36.720]  is it's a conspiracy theory
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.800]  and these are peaceful religious prisoners fall on gong they love them
[41:42.800 --> 41:46.320]  because they don't drink they don't use drugs they have super healthy
[41:46.320 --> 41:50.800]  systems they don't have a high rejection rate
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.760]  they have quote fresh as the chinese government advertised a decade ago
[41:55.760 --> 42:00.080]  organs so here's some of the clips i want to play
[42:00.080 --> 42:04.320]  hollywood no longer inspires or challenges us
[42:04.320 --> 42:08.080]  despite crazy reality matt drudge has faith in humanity
[42:08.080 --> 42:13.600]  matt drudge attacks the deliberate repression of humanity matt drudge
[42:13.600 --> 42:16.240]  warns the end of the internet that's huge
[42:16.240 --> 42:19.040]  we have another report why matt drudge is more relevant than ever it's a bunch of
[42:19.040 --> 42:21.760]  really key clips but i want to first play this clip
[42:21.760 --> 42:25.920]  where he talks about obama
[42:27.280 --> 42:31.920]  drop your guns turn in your guides
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.440]  that is so important that video is up on info wars dot com
[42:39.440 --> 42:43.520]  matt drudge challenges obama give up your guns give up
[42:43.520 --> 42:47.600]  your secret service and of course that's obviously
[42:47.600 --> 42:52.320]  asinine but they turn whole cities into martial law for the pope or obama
[42:52.320 --> 42:56.240]  or other top new world order people but then they
[42:56.240 --> 43:00.240]  tell you you can't have a gun in chicago to protect yourself from criminals
[43:00.240 --> 43:05.440]  that don't even follow the laws so here's that clip
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.680]  there's so much going on in the world obama now is talking about well australia
[43:09.680 --> 43:12.720]  had a good plan we may have to do that that's clearly talking about gun
[43:12.720 --> 43:16.640]  confiscation now hillary's doing it cnn's has pundits
[43:16.640 --> 43:20.240]  just saying let's just take them do these people realize that this is the
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.560]  line in the sanity alamo if they really come out in the frontal assault on guns
[43:24.560 --> 43:27.920]  it means i think they're trying to start a civil war
[43:27.920 --> 43:31.760]  it just seems like insanity i mean they may think that they're
[43:31.760 --> 43:35.920]  stalling or something well because they're all armed themselves or they
[43:35.920 --> 43:40.000]  all have that security around them themselves they don't have to worry
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.440]  about i challenge hillary take away your secret
[43:43.440 --> 43:49.200]  service take it away now take away your secret service dismiss them
[43:49.200 --> 43:52.560]  have no security around you have no guns around you hillary
[43:52.560 --> 43:58.480]  i dare you i dare you obama same thing drop your guns obama
[43:58.480 --> 44:03.440]  take your secret service away obama take it all away leave the white house
[44:03.440 --> 44:06.960]  unguarded obama let everybody know there's no guns on the white house
[44:06.960 --> 44:10.640]  grounds obama you know what would happen in 30 seconds
[44:10.640 --> 44:15.440]  both of those people would no longer be on planet earth so they're asking us
[44:15.440 --> 44:19.120]  to drop our guns and to drop our security measures
[44:19.120 --> 44:24.560]  or or what so this thing is very real and i don't see how it's being taken
[44:24.560 --> 44:28.800]  seriously except for the sick voter you can't underestimate the
[44:28.800 --> 44:32.000]  sickness of the american people right now they're really sick
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.000]  and that's to me i'm more angry at the sick americans than i am at obama
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.800]  or hillary i'm really angry at the sick americans
[44:40.800 --> 44:45.280]  that's right and when you're sick when you're drinking a fifth of vodka every
[44:45.280 --> 44:47.360]  day and you have liver failure that's imminent
[44:47.360 --> 44:50.080]  you need your family there to intervene and say you're sick you're killing
[44:50.080 --> 44:54.000]  yourself you need to admit that's happening and when you are letting the
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.680]  government engage in every criminal activity selling us out to foreign banks
[44:57.680 --> 45:01.520]  banker bailouts zero percent interest rates for the elite but
[45:01.520 --> 45:05.200]  high interest for the people the government legalizing payday loans
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.760]  loan sharking i mean the crimes go on and on forever the the drug money
[45:09.760 --> 45:15.200]  laundering by the central government
[45:15.200 --> 45:20.160]  the list stretches from here to eternity
[45:20.160 --> 45:24.720]  from here past infinity and back again
[45:25.920 --> 45:31.120]  it's just perpetual and it's rotting now i want to go to this next clip where he
[45:31.120 --> 45:33.600]  warns of the end of internet freedom as we know it and
[45:33.600 --> 45:37.600]  this is being done now in germany this is being done in france this is being
[45:37.600 --> 45:42.080]  done in sweden this is being done in china this is beginning in australia
[45:42.080 --> 45:45.840]  this is starting in canada it's now coming here it's the exact same
[45:45.840 --> 45:52.080]  formulae that other countries are three four five six years ahead of us on
[45:52.080 --> 45:57.520]  but now things are compressed so what was happening six years ago in germany
[45:57.520 --> 46:01.040]  is now going to be happening here in a year
[46:01.040 --> 46:05.600]  germany i mean i see these headlines out of
[46:05.600 --> 46:09.840]  mainline german newspapers do not criticize the immigrants in any way
[46:09.840 --> 46:13.200]  do not criticize the government do not demonstrate against open borders or
[46:13.200 --> 46:15.840]  you will be arrested and your children will be taken
[46:15.840 --> 46:19.520]  and folks germany for a decade from even wealthy
[46:19.520 --> 46:24.320]  top families folks that are worth you know 20 30 million euros
[46:24.320 --> 46:27.200]  i've seen the cases we've had the families on i mean folks that own
[46:27.200 --> 46:29.120]  companies people that are like you look at these families
[46:29.120 --> 46:33.440]  they look something off a postcard and they homeschool their children
[46:33.440 --> 46:36.240]  they take them
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.560]  germany never got out from under hitler because one evil ended the soviets
[46:42.560 --> 46:45.920]  came in and took one half the us came in with
[46:45.920 --> 46:49.360]  nato and took over the other half and germany never
[46:49.360 --> 46:52.880]  became free they were both laboratory experiments of what's a better form of
[46:52.880 --> 46:55.280]  tyranny where you think you're free or where you live in
[46:55.280 --> 46:59.280]  east germany and they've now merged the two systems and have
[46:59.280 --> 47:03.360]  reactivated the stasi i remember a couple weeks ago we
[47:03.360 --> 47:06.880]  reported on them hiring top stasi people to work at facebook to then report
[47:06.880 --> 47:10.480]  people within the german news a week later said oh they're
[47:10.480 --> 47:14.880]  actually hiring former stasi to run the anti-free speech scripts
[47:14.880 --> 47:19.280]  i mean man this is like scary
[47:20.400 --> 47:24.320]  and they're doing it they've had a whole bunch of senators that we've covered
[47:24.320 --> 47:28.480]  it they've had the FCC come out and say you know we're looking at shutting down
[47:28.480 --> 47:31.040]  the drudge report people go good who needs that big
[47:31.040 --> 47:36.160]  site i don't that's not my site if they can take down drudge they can take
[47:36.160 --> 47:40.240]  anybody down and that's one thing they've gotten this class envy thing is
[47:40.240 --> 47:42.880]  you know rush limbaugh has attacked me some over the years and he's covered
[47:42.880 --> 47:46.080]  some of our news over the years as well i'm not in competition with him i was
[47:46.080 --> 47:48.960]  ordered to have this show up against him because they don't tell me what to say
[47:48.960 --> 47:52.560]  but they told me what slot 18 years ago they said no you're not gonna be on it
[47:52.560 --> 47:55.440]  night anymore you're going to go up against rush limbaugh nobody else will
[47:55.440 --> 47:59.280]  it was actually a great strategy because a lot of stations either couldn't get the
[47:59.280 --> 48:01.920]  show or didn't want to carry it so we've been successful
[48:01.920 --> 48:06.320]  so i don't have some score to settle with limbaugh i don't have that primitive
[48:06.320 --> 48:09.840]  thing where i want to knock off the big guy
[48:10.240 --> 48:14.400]  i want to influence him to become more like me which i've done
[48:14.400 --> 48:17.840]  and i know i have that's our biggest victories we have influence
[48:17.840 --> 48:21.680]  conservatism talk radio obama in speeches talks about it
[48:21.680 --> 48:25.360]  they by name they talk about msnbc every week they say gop
[48:25.360 --> 48:28.800]  stop becoming alex jones stop echoing his talking points
[48:28.800 --> 48:32.720]  it's not talking points when i link to a un document
[48:32.720 --> 48:36.480]  they hate that and it's dangerous that i'm one of the few people that gets it
[48:36.480 --> 48:40.720]  i'm trying to get more people out there so i'm safe do you understand that
[48:40.720 --> 48:44.720]  that this isn't like some territorial club where i've got all the answers and
[48:44.720 --> 48:48.720]  i'm the big kingpin and that's why drudge is so
[48:48.720 --> 48:54.000]  sickeningly refreshing i mean it's sickening how much i like matt
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.040]  drudge because it's so refreshing somebody that gets it all
[48:57.040 --> 49:00.560]  understands it and is a fellow traveler to use the communist term but in a
[49:00.560 --> 49:03.200]  libertarian way
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.480]  i mean i have to be honest and say matt drudge is the coolest person i've
[49:08.480 --> 49:11.440]  ever known i mean it it's undoubtedly hands down
[49:11.440 --> 49:15.520]  he's helped us more he's he's helped the country more he's done so much good
[49:15.520 --> 49:19.760]  it's sickening in a good way i'm gonna skip this
[49:19.760 --> 49:22.640]  network break i just can't help it then i know more in a few weeks we're doing
[49:22.640 --> 49:25.680]  the tones for the satellite anyways and the tv stations that's not been done
[49:25.680 --> 49:28.720]  yet so i can't ever skip a break again
[49:28.720 --> 49:31.840]  under contract i can't do it so just enjoy it folks because it's about to all
[49:31.840 --> 49:35.200]  end
[49:36.160 --> 49:39.680]  i want to go to this next clip uh let's go to uh the end of the internet it's
[49:39.680 --> 49:43.840]  already happening zuckerberg five months ago
[49:43.840 --> 49:48.320]  had the head of the chinese censors here for two weeks
[49:48.320 --> 49:52.560]  teaching them how to censor
[49:52.720 --> 49:56.400]  there it is mark zuckerberg caught on hot mic last week saying facebook
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.240]  will censor any immigrant post and will do a better job and will
[50:00.240 --> 50:07.680]  need to do some more work to merkel whose parents were communist
[50:07.680 --> 50:14.000]  and what is communism it's Rothschild Rockefeller funded
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.880]  tyranny masquerade it's oligarch tyranny masquerading as the people getting
[50:18.880 --> 50:22.720]  a free lunch and you know you get a free launch in the socialist
[50:22.720 --> 50:27.920]  move until they take you communist or fascist but socialism always falls
[50:27.920 --> 50:32.080]  to fascism or communism and variants thereof
[50:32.080 --> 50:37.520]  all the political spectrum we're taught is just just names folks
[50:37.520 --> 50:41.360]  cameras black uniforms total surveillance will take your kids if you
[50:41.360 --> 50:44.240]  criticize open borders this is the conquering of europe
[50:44.240 --> 50:51.360]  and we've got the socialist leader the president of france saying total war
[50:51.360 --> 50:55.040]  europe is collapsing when they're the ones doing it and the answer is do what
[50:55.040 --> 50:59.440]  we say and we'll save europe give us more emergency powers we'll save europe
[50:59.440 --> 51:04.320]  let us bring in the immigrants we'll fix it there's gonna be a war here between
[51:04.320 --> 51:08.240]  indigenous europeans and all these arabs and north africans so
[51:08.240 --> 51:12.480]  we've got to give us emergency powers
[51:13.360 --> 51:17.600]  and they're talking about that because now the french prime minister has broke
[51:17.600 --> 51:22.880]  and declared war let's put that back up on radical islam so the french are in
[51:22.880 --> 51:26.160]  a state of civil war they think they're going to make the
[51:26.160 --> 51:32.000]  french capitulate to a total islamic radical caliphate
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.680]  with the socialist working together and i'm telling you you might see some moves
[51:35.680 --> 51:38.880]  like you saw with the gulb
[51:38.880 --> 51:42.320]  at the end of world war two a few years later france had gotten nuclear
[51:42.320 --> 51:45.440]  weapons and there was actually a soft coup where they threw
[51:45.440 --> 51:49.280]  nato out and france wouldn't join nato and they seized airfields the
[51:49.280 --> 51:52.640]  french did good let's see it again french you're
[51:52.640 --> 51:55.760]  not a bunch of wimps you conquered most of the world before
[51:55.760 --> 51:59.360]  you've been taken over by a bunch of scum and taught to be socialist cowards
[51:59.360 --> 52:03.200]  they've been sitting on use since world war two
[52:03.200 --> 52:07.440]  my god what'd you kill like nine million germans in world war one
[52:07.440 --> 52:10.320]  everybody that calls the french a bunch of wimps the french helped create this
[52:10.320 --> 52:14.400]  country the french aren't wimps stop being wimps
[52:14.400 --> 52:17.600]  stop letting the socialist capture you and don't be enemies with the average
[52:17.600 --> 52:19.920]  muslim but know they're being used as a weapon
[52:19.920 --> 52:26.080]  absolutely they are stop political correctness
[52:26.080 --> 52:30.800]  arrest distinct and president he's a traitor it's time folks people are sick
[52:30.800 --> 52:34.400]  of it the socialists know people are waking up
[52:34.400 --> 52:37.600]  and they're getting ready to take down the west folks this is the equivalent
[52:37.600 --> 52:41.120]  of a soviet takeover but it's being directed by mega banks who are
[52:41.120 --> 52:44.720]  offshore it's just so it's such an incredible time to be alive
[52:44.720 --> 52:50.000]  do people not realize that i wanted to stand up in this restaurant i was in
[52:50.000 --> 52:55.440]  because there's no rooms we sat at the bar sunday i talked about it
[52:55.440 --> 53:00.320]  and i ate eggs benedict and i was watching all these grown men watch
[53:00.320 --> 53:03.200]  football and i get it i i used to love football
[53:03.200 --> 53:09.120]  it's just that it's a distraction from world war economic crazy town i mean
[53:09.120 --> 53:12.720]  the whole world's lining up for fireworks the planet's never seen
[53:12.720 --> 53:15.200]  right now they're coming after our freedom
[53:15.200 --> 53:18.160]  they're coming after our kids they're coming after our medical freedom
[53:18.160 --> 53:23.760]  they're coming after our guns they mean business
[53:23.760 --> 53:26.880]  and in the civil war that's going to ensue the soft civil war
[53:26.880 --> 53:29.840]  that they've already calling a civil war in europe now now they're calling it
[53:29.840 --> 53:35.520]  that the prime minister and the president in a fight
[53:37.360 --> 53:40.880]  they've induced us into this crisis to bring in their gayling and dialectic
[53:40.880 --> 53:43.680]  of their solution
[53:45.360 --> 53:48.640]  you can see it the same strategies in america the same strategy in europe
[53:48.640 --> 53:53.520]  dissolving the borders bringing in the refugees filling them full of hatred
[53:53.520 --> 53:57.120]  sticking a silver spoon in their mouth and telling them they deserve everything
[53:57.120 --> 54:05.200]  creating racial hatred colleges across america now say to be white is bad
[54:05.200 --> 54:11.360]  i was talking to again a phd student at a major psychology department
[54:11.360 --> 54:15.200]  just two weeks ago a guy i've known very well very successful he wants to go
[54:15.200 --> 54:17.920]  back for another career
[54:17.920 --> 54:24.480]  and they they basically told him it is inherently bad to be white
[54:24.480 --> 54:29.360]  and when you make a mistake we're going to give you a zero on your paper but
[54:29.360 --> 54:33.200]  minorities can make mistakes and it's fine they told him a straight face he
[54:33.200 --> 54:36.160]  went to the dean they said that's right that's how this works
[54:36.160 --> 54:39.040]  and he said but it's we this guy's a liberal because we're all together we're
[54:39.040 --> 54:43.440]  humanity we and they're like this is no we
[54:43.440 --> 54:48.800]  ha ha ha ha academic probation
[54:48.800 --> 54:55.600]  one more move and you're out of here you've gone from a 3.8 to 3.9 we're
[54:55.600 --> 54:58.880]  going to bring you down and we're going to teach you
[54:58.880 --> 55:03.360]  and the person he's talking to is this white is the driven snow
[55:03.360 --> 55:07.760]  because it's a cult it's a takeover it has nothing to do with the minorities
[55:07.760 --> 55:11.600]  they're going to absolutely enslave them afterwards they're going to bio weapon
[55:11.600 --> 55:14.240]  the third world watch they've already been doing it they've
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.000]  been caught doing it in testing
[55:19.840 --> 55:22.720]  they're already sterilizing people all over the third world
[55:22.720 --> 55:27.200]  but the masses are so big they're going to use what's left as weapons
[55:27.200 --> 55:32.480]  we save the third world we industrialize them we build them up
[55:32.480 --> 55:37.200]  then they go to 1.5 children naturally that's what wealthy people do or
[55:37.200 --> 55:39.920]  middle-class do
[55:39.920 --> 55:43.680]  then we export our populations that want to go to space it's unlimited it's a
[55:43.680 --> 55:46.400]  beautiful plan we can do it it's being suppressed
[55:46.400 --> 55:50.400]  it's been decided against we've got to have a free internet
[55:50.400 --> 55:54.400]  we've got to have free communication so we can put out a better idea of the
[55:54.400 --> 55:57.280]  future so people buy into believing in humanity
[55:57.280 --> 56:00.640]  instead of hating it with these eugenesis transhumanist
[56:00.640 --> 56:04.880]  exterminist you're going to see stuff that makes
[56:04.880 --> 56:08.960]  hitler look like a choir boy in the future if these people really
[56:08.960 --> 56:14.160]  get rolling and they're close let's go to matt rogers the second clip
[56:14.160 --> 56:19.120]  i had a supreme court justice tell me to my face it's over for me
[56:19.120 --> 56:23.040]  said matt it's over for you they've got the votes now to enforce copyright law
[56:23.040 --> 56:26.240]  you're out of there they're going to make it so headlines you can't even use
[56:26.240 --> 56:30.000]  headlines to have a supreme court justice
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.200]  say that to my face that it's over they've got the votes
[56:33.200 --> 56:37.920]  which means time is limited time is not forever
[56:37.920 --> 56:42.080]  how many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life
[56:42.080 --> 56:45.120]  rise and fall there's not that many it's a small
[56:45.120 --> 56:49.520]  amount so for people to be saying with this attitude oh i'll get on with my
[56:49.520 --> 56:54.720]  life and my greatness sometime no no you can't we're being enslaved now and
[56:54.720 --> 56:58.320]  that's it under the tpp they admit you can't put a
[56:58.320 --> 57:02.880]  headline to the new york times you're sending massive traffic to them
[57:02.880 --> 57:07.040]  they're claiming you're taking their words this is insane and you had the
[57:07.040 --> 57:10.000]  justice steven briar said we need to look at a global law
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.840]  now member just recently getting lined up with it so they're getting ready for
[57:13.840 --> 57:16.880]  these decisions to come you thought obama care was shocking
[57:16.880 --> 57:19.760]  you thought some of these other decisions were shocking wait until these
[57:19.760 --> 57:24.080]  copyright laws work their way up and the supreme court
[57:24.080 --> 57:28.080]  decides you cannot have a website with news headlines
[57:28.080 --> 57:31.600]  linking across the board
[57:32.880 --> 57:36.160]  and of course erin swartz was fighting all of this and they murdered him they
[57:36.160 --> 57:38.560]  hung him
[57:39.600 --> 57:45.760]  it's it's real reality is so over the top incredible and i just can't
[57:45.760 --> 57:48.960]  believe that so many people are walking through it like a matrix
[57:48.960 --> 57:52.560]  or they think if they're halfway aware that it's like work and well i just
[57:52.560 --> 57:54.320]  don't want to know i don't want to be involved

[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.600]  when all of this starts coming to fruition i've been traveling a lot and
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.680]  i'm seeing a lot of desperation everywhere a lot of sad desperation
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.360]  i was just in an airport and even down to this a woman selling southwest
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:52.000]  airlines credit cards sending like a robot have you signed up yet
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.840]  are you a member of the club it was tragic this is a mature woman
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.600]  with a beautiful face in life and i'm like how did she get there
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.040]  what has happened to this culture that she's now standing as a robot like this
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.160]  they are sucking our ability to make
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.800]  uh an income that is compatible with what you need to so i'm getting a
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.560]  little frightened as i travel on the other side of it when i go to
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.480]  new york and i see some of the billionaires it's the other side
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.240]  endless you know they're fighting over pieces of artwork
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:26.240]  it's it's gotten to the point where they have and they have not here
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.160]  is breaking so it's the billionaires that are mainly
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.200]  funding the whole leftist redistribution movement because they end up getting the
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.120]  money in corporate welfare and insider deals it's so sick
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.320]  i watched a great film i don't know if you've seen it yet but it's
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.680]  the best of enemies about goreva doll and william f buckley have you seen that
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.480]  yet no you've got to see it and it shows goreva doll arguing saying the
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.000]  interest oh and by the way why are we not allowed to have a goreva doll
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.440]  william buckley anymore in the media scene do you see who they hire
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.600]  do you see who's hired for the shows how dull they are yes
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.360]  dull dull as dishwash they want you to tune out of politics in an entertainment
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.160]  yes they make it where are the flamboyant characters this is what america
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.320]  desperately needs right now flamboyant intellectual characters
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.160]  who can cut different ways and that's just what i'm missing i'm
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.760]  i've been fortunate enough to meet some of the greats of this generation and i've
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.760]  got to tell you they are there it's just they are suppressed and hidden and
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.920]  they're not hired the way goreva doll and buckley were back of previous
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.160]  generation they were not afraid of ideas
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:36.000]  this generation is frightened of ideas or at least it's being suppressed
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.120]  and that's what political correctness is is a war on debate a war on diversity
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:48.240]  a war on liberalism a war on renaissance a war on freedom
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:55.200]  it is a war on discussion a war on language it is 1984 come through
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:01.440]  in 2015 and beyond presidential candidates today strategize
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.880]  over every last detail of a candidate's image especially
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.320]  an identity candidate like hillary how important
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.520]  is it for there to be a woman president in the united states
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.360]  national journal has pointed out that candidates now view soundtracks as a
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.040]  key part of that carefully crafted image so
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.160]  maybe hillary should choose a campaign song that plays
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.200]  against type you know humble i'm sorry
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.240]  hillary has paid a consulting firm nine thousand dollars to create a soundtrack
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:35.600]  for her campaign i just don't think people would believe
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.200]  this song though she's being abandoned by unions by
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.160]  multinational corporate donors who are worried
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.320]  44 percent of her twitter followers 1.4 million
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:53.040]  are fake maybe her campaign theme should be

[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.000]  you gotta love this roll call is reporting that the democrats want a
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.160]  ethics probe of congressman mccarthy and gowdy
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.000]  who've been leading the way in the investigation at least on the surface of
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.160]  Benghazi but what that'll really do is make
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.760]  mccarthy get elected as a new speaker of the house by making him
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.840]  a cause celeb with republicans who want to see justice on Benghazi
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:45.360]  so that's how my brain works i just instantly saw what that's really gonna
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:50.000]  do because they're not gonna get in trouble for their probe of Benghazi
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.480]  they followed all the rules so that's a paper tiger
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.400]  to fool conservatives to put in banners
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.120]  aid the camp his attache his right hand man
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.880]  his groom of the stool our guest is with us till 33 after
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.960]  then i'm going to launch into the news the trump news
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:18.480]  the election news the vatican news uh the
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:24.160]  matt drudge news that is now in many graphs google facebook you name it in
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.640]  the top three stories in the country his visitation
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.960]  of this facility yesterday and the bombshell stuff he had to say
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.840]  it's clear that this is the most hardcore drudge has ever been
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:43.440]  and talking to him last night it was no secret that this was the next level
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.520]  i think you can say matt drudge is getting ready to take the gloves off
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.960]  because of the open naked parade of abuse and tyranny that is
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:58.240]  being foisted on us in an attempt to make us submit to an even greater level
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.400]  of corruption but you know newtonian physics for every action
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.800]  there is a equal and opposite reaction
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:13.120]  and we are now at that threshold this is 100 brazen corruption
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.080]  in everyone's face and everything from
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.880]  you name it i mean there are hundreds of newspapers reporting on it right now
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.480]  some of them seriously some of them not making jokes about it with a conspiracy
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.520]  theory term i mean i would be so insulted as a reader
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.840]  if someone put monger conspiracy nut alex jones
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.800]  has bizarre drudge interview i mean it's those words just rescramble they don't
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.600]  even need humans to write these articles even though they still have them in
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.960]  some cases because they just give them the script and then the computer just
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:47.680]  rearranges it that's how the cia patented
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.120]  bought writers they came out with five years ago operate and now google and
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.880]  others are actually using that i can tell these articles when they've been
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.600]  written because they'll make no sense but it still doesn't matter the sheeple
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:02.400]  will sit there and read it because the language has been dumbed down so far
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.920]  and then matt drudge comes on and profoundly talks about a supreme court
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.120]  justice telling him we've been told they're going to ban free speech
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.760]  they're going to shut you down the FCC has come out and said that's admitted
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.120]  we've got like 10 different czars under obama saying to it
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.840]  they're doing all over the world and then it's a joke
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.040]  to people in the press who are going to have their future
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.800]  and their children's futures literally sucked out of them
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.840]  you people do not have any self-preservation skills
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.800]  all right we're going to our guest i really appreciate him joining us
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.240]  dent research director formerly a high-level analyst

[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.800]  of his degrees harry dent dot com uh and he joins us he's the best-selling
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.080]  author of the demographic cliff he accurately of course
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.440]  uh has predicted what we're now currently seeing in many other major
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.080]  trends he has a bunch of charts we're going to be going over i'm going to shut

[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.120]  but obviously since he was on with us about three weeks ago a lot
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.400]  has developed with the jobs numbers and other issues
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.240]  and the factory orders really showing that what he predicted unfortunately is
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.880]  spot on we now have the fed chairman coming out two days
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.960]  ago on monday and saying yes uh the numbers are bad the economy is not in
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.920]  good shape uh so they've gone from saying everything's fine

[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.280]  warning people especially today that i think there's another mini crash
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.240]  coming we saw one in late august the market was down over 10
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.000]  percent in five days i think that's going to happen between
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.400]  today and next friday so so little over a week
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.480]  we could see the markets drop 10 percent or more again i i i've got one chart
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.200]  you can show where i went out to our subscribers recently and said hey
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.280]  you know we've got one more wave down in this first wave down and this is only
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.000]  the first wave of mini coming over the next year and a half
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.920]  and it looks like it's got another sharp wave down it will be like 15
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.520]  thousand uh 300 at a minimum and maybe as low as
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:24.160]  14 200 so that's you know that's 10 percent 15 percent
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.000]  from here so we're just warning people everybody keeps thinking oh this is a
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.200]  correction it's over that's what wall street keeps telling everybody
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.960]  this is the beginning of a major crash it's going to be stronger
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:39.600]  than 2008 was uh because we've only created a greater bubble with all this
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.040]  endless quantitative easing and zero interest rates forever
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:46.160]  and so we got another bigger bubble it's going to burst but it's going to burst
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.840]  over the next year and a half uh real quickly the next slide
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:53.920]  so it says called bell crash comparison says what would happen if this
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.880]  crash in the same time frame took a similar pattern to
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:03.840]  from late 2007 to early 2009 and we're already following this pattern and
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.440]  going down here the next week would bring us very close in line with this
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.920]  pattern then we get another bounce but what we've been
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:14.400]  warning people Alex is that this is just the beginning the worst crash will come
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.920]  probably in the first half or so of next year
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.960]  it's it's the middle wave down that is usually
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.120]  the worst so so people should use these rallies
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.600]  the market keeps when the market crashes like this people get too bearish
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.760]  too many people get short and so the big traders see that and then they just
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.320]  blow them out they they drive the market up to what's called a short squeeze
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.080]  and they blow out all these people's stops and stuff
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.080]  and that causes short rallies like we just saw but we warned our subscribers
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.400]  this morning this is one of those short squeezes the market's likely to reverse
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.800]  sharply down so don't believe it and already today it looks like the market
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.240]  is reversing so we're saying this is a good day to get out
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:02.640]  if we do have another 10 or more crash even with the bounce to follow we may
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.320]  not get back to these levels sure and you were on a month and a half ago
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:09.680]  the exact dates are on info wars.com and you said within two weeks this is all
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:12.480]  going to start and two weeks later that was the next big
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.320]  drop yeah you know i mean there are times a
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.160]  year when when you're ready to have a crash like this there's
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.960]  times from mid august to mid october is one of those times when you're most
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:29.840]  likely to have a stock crash and that's exactly what happened this crash got
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.160]  serious in mid august crashed in the late august it's bounced and now it looks
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.800]  like it's going to crash again in the mid october
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.320]  so this is part for the course we'll probably see the worst
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.760]  for now in the next week and a half but then there'll be another bounce
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.760]  for a month or so and then the big one will come after that so
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.360]  so i'm just trying to get people to take this crash seriously don't listen to
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.720]  your stock broker don't listen to the analysts don't listen to the financial
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.360]  media all of them are cheerleaders like you were
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.680]  saying for hey everything's fine nobody wants anybody to panic this isn't about
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.400]  panicking panicking it's about realizing the
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:08.480]  governments have created the greatest bubbles in history real estate stocks
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:13.040]  even gold everything and now these bubbles have to burst just like that
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.440]  did before there's only one thing to do get out of the way
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.280]  mr dent unfortunately you've been proven right i mean we're sitting on top this
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.960]  giant bubble i like it as you know to living on top an active volcano
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.400]  i mean we know it's going to erupt sometime the bigger question is
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:32.400]  you've been scarily eerily accurate on the
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.600]  how this would start unraveling but as you said there could be a lot of
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.640]  different triggers a major city going under a state going under
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:43.920]  Puerto Rico a european country europe both the prime minister and presidents
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.080]  say they're quote in total war and now there's just rioting in the streets
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.080]  and murders and raping i mean the world is obviously
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.920]  already to a great extent in a unevenly distributed depression
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.440]  yeah it is and governments are fighting it with quantitative easing quantitative
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.280]  easing is a way of keeping a depression or deflationary
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.280]  deleveraging of debt and bubbles from happening so they're just
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.120]  pulling out a fire hose trying to prevent something that's inevitable the
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.560]  sooner these bubbles burst the sooner real estate becomes affordable for
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.880]  young couples again you know the sooner all these bubbles burst so so investors
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.880]  can invest in the long term and get some returns if you buy stocks right now
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.960]  the best historical models say the best you would expect is a minus
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:32.960]  one to two percent per year loss over the next ten years in other words you're
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.080]  almost guaranteed to lose money for a long period of time
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.680]  because stocks are so overvalued so so yeah that's what we're saying you have
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.360]  to recognize this is a bubble the next chart's a very interesting one and i've
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.440]  shown it before and i've added one dimension it's called a papal visit
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:51.920]  omen the pope only seems to come over here at the top of bubbles
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:56.240]  so we look back at the last major peaks which i also call a megaphone pattern
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.120]  higher highs each bubble takes us to higher highs
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.800]  and each crash takes us to lower lows that's why i've been saying on your
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.800]  show now for several months that the next stop on the doubt probably late next
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:12.160]  year early 2017 it's like 5500 to 6 000 and by the way let me just stop you
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.880]  we may have to hold you a little bit past 33 if you can do that because this is
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.800]  so important but you're a scientist when it comes to economics
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:21.600]  that's what you did for bane that's what you were taught at harvard you've got
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.720]  a great mind obviously you're one of the best out there
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.400]  we don't obviously know why they come at the peak but that's what i said myself
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:32.000]  not even knowing you had this papal chart i'd miss this one was it seems like
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.080]  popes come over here because i went and looked right before a crash
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:40.480]  and right before global upheaval they'll do these big western tours and so it's
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:44.640]  not a good omen and you look at the chart it's dead on
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:50.720]  that after a pope comes uh in 99 2008 2015 it drops right after
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:57.680]  as a scientist uh what's happening here well you know when
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:01.200]  somebody's gonna do a tour like this when people feel the best
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.640]  you know and so so you know this is the time where where
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.400]  this could happen and everybody wanted to happen so i think that's probably the
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:12.880]  reason of course this is not the reason i so he's here to scoop offerings
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:17.920]  huh so he's here to get offerings yeah yeah and it's a good time to do it it's
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.120]  easier to do this and get great crowds and acceptance
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.320]  when things are good and everybody's kind of happy um
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:28.480]  you know you come during depressing times and and people are feeling like oh
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.840]  my gosh you know things aren't right and something's wrong with the universe
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:36.480]  that's not the time to come out and and promote your uh your religion
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.680]  basically so so you know it makes sense in that way but
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.960]  the most important thing is that we're involved now i got he's sharing the
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.640]  sheet before their financial slaughter yeah well you know i mean
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.240]  again this is not intentional but this is this is the type of thing that i heard
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.600]  the Vatican bank knows what's going on it says hey papa time to get over there
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.320]  because it's about to be lean times we need to get a little bit of more money

[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:22.240]  we've gone from saying you're being proven correct
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.920]  to now the federal reserve is admitting this we put up the statement it was an
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:30.640]  associated press where the head of the fed said
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.120]  that you know these these numbers are troubling for the economy and then we had
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.320]  the former head bernack he say this shows that the economy is in
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.480]  trouble are they admitting that now
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.520]  because they know it looks too stupid to keep denying it or what does that
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:46.560]  signify well i'll tell you what alex that the biggest
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:49.680]  triggers you said there's many triggers you know one's the weakening of our
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.000]  economy because of demographics the euro crisis is obvious that's never
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.920]  going to come out of it without unraveling but the
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.080]  two biggest triggers right now number one is this chart i have china the china
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.680]  bubble is finally bursting i've been harping on this for years now
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.680]  greatest bubble in history stocks real estate especially real estate
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.920]  and it's finally crumbling despite the government buying their own stock market
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:17.920]  and you can see here this has got another wave coming down and it's been
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.680]  going sideways for over a month a narrow range and i've been warning people
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:25.600]  this is going to probably the biggest single trigger of this next
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.680]  mini crash and i don't go to bed at night alex without checking the china
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:32.160]  market that's about 14 hours ahead of us so
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:36.400]  so that's another important indicator i think you're going to see that down
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.800]  another 20 percent it's already been down 45 percent and then we got a final
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:44.400]  chart the oil chart every time oil goes down oil
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.600]  companies get hit crackers get crucified
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.640]  depths start to fail and whole countries get hit
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.640]  so the oil we've been wanting the oil keeps cracking down
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.280]  it broke out down below 80 dollars a couple years ago we said this is it
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.960]  oil is going to keep going down towards 10 to 20 dollars a barrel and oil looks
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.360]  like it's getting ready to break back down the 30 to 32 dollars and again
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.360]  that's just going to show wall street and investors the crackers
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:15.200]  are dead they they have a trillion dollar industry
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:20.400]  600 billion dollars in leveraged debt and junk bonds and tons of jobs
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:24.640]  especially in texas and north dakota and these companies are going to go under
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:28.800]  and never be able to come back again they were only it was only made possible
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:32.560]  by these very low interest rates set by the fed so these people could borrow
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:38.080]  cheap and speculate and and produce oil that's normally high cost at a favorable
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.680]  price so so the fracking thing's over so that this is going to be one of the
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.840]  triggers that causes the next debt crisis in the u.s all it takes is somebody
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.560]  like the subprime crisis in 2008 to start it and then all other
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.160]  debts start start going bad and investors start worrying again investors
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.360]  have been the bond markets and stock markets have been acting like we're in a
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:02.000]  hunky dory world where everything like you said before geopolitics around the
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.440]  world is horrible we've got a whole cycle on that that's only going to get worse
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:09.280]  for the next four years and demographic trends are absolutely
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:12.800]  horrible and guess who's number one going down in the next few years
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.600]  germany the one country that most people think is strong and in a good position
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.560]  they got worse demographic trends than japan had in the 1990s
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:28.320]  and their and their answer is unskilled third world labor that is
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:34.400]  extremely on average aggressive and being filled with political class envy
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.400]  by socialist what are the socialists going to do when they've been so busy
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:43.200]  trying to bleed the christmas pig but also they hate it so they kick it in the
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.160]  face a bunch what are they going to do when the christmas pig rolls over and
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.400]  dies we know i i think that's one of the things that one of the
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.920]  good things about this crisis i'm predicting we've been doing a lot of
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.040]  things that don't make sense we've been killing the golden goose free market
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.120]  capitalism kind of got married to democracy in the late 1700s
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:04.400]  and we've been on a roll ever since especially the developed world and now
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:08.160]  the third world catching up but governments say oh no we can't trust
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.680]  this system anymore with all this dynamics and its inflation and deflation
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.960]  all this power and all this wealth and all this innovation and invention and
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:18.080]  all this honor and it's so horrible let's screw it up and
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.800]  you know teach trendies how to pour drano in their eyes
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.000]  yeah yeah they want to control it and turn it into a machine instead of a
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.680]  dynamic innovative system so they they just wanted to grow at three percent
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.760]  quarter percent gdp two percent inflation and never have a recession again
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:37.760]  that is a formula for disaster that's not how capitalism works
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.280]  it has to have booms in recessions has to have inflation
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:45.840]  and deflation has to have innovation and creative destruction and that means
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:49.360]  you have to have failure for the system to work so they don't want any failure
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:53.280]  there are a bunch of ninnies and in this crisis it's going to force people to
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.360]  realize that the government and central banks couldn't just control the economy
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:03.520]  and why don't we go back to what actually worked before they came along
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.840]  we're gonna go to break come back and do five more minutes and we'll let you get
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.400]  back to work but harry dent is our guest harry dent

[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.800]  other points you think are important that the audience should know
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.640]  what will the political class do though with a lot of the new tricks they have
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.440]  up their sleeves that can't stop fundamentals long term but
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:29.440]  what curveballs do you think might come out of the system i see them building
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:34.000]  up with the talitarianism classic police state i think is their answer
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.120]  to these cascading bubbles bursting and so i want to get your take on personally
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.600]  when you talk to your wife when you talk to your family

[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:00.640]  this is the type of meme that could be a major blow just like we helped launch
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:06.240]  the meme to fire baner with congressman jones
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.840]  remember that i'm not saying we have all the credit we're just part of that

[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:19.440]  the different memes we've put out wants to disarm everyone but won't turn in his

[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.160]  news icon calls on president and hillary to relinquish secret service
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.600]  protection people like well that's ridiculous he
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.040]  needs to be protected okay well this is discriminatory we pay
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.480]  for him to be protected because he's a god he's an emperor
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:47.520]  well we don't have the right to defend ourselves
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:52.080]  even though nowhere in jurisprudence nowhere in law
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:56.080]  in our system doesn't say the police have a duty to protect you
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:59.280]  they have a duty to respond to the courts and to the people
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.120]  to grand juries to judges to go out and to
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.440]  grab people who have been suspected of committing a crime or who have been
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:11.680]  indicted so we don't have to protect you we
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.880]  can't protect you all the time most of the time they'll tell you that
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:20.560]  but you can't have a gun it's not police that are saying that on average it's
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:24.560]  the criminal class who are protected by our taxpayer money that the nerve do
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:30.560]  this and i know you know this but the general public the yuppies the trendies
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.760]  they don't know this you've got to reach out to these poor victims
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.360]  of brainwashing should i play the attorney general again
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.400]  saying to the media the rtf national convention
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:44.480]  the the the former attorney general eric holder
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.800]  saying we need to literally repetitively brainwash the public against guns
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.360]  you know i'm not going to play that i want to get dense take on the move
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.840]  towards totalitarianism and i'll get into the news but
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:59.040]  since i mentioned it here is obama again over the weekend saying it's a
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.240]  conspiracy theory to think he wants our guns when i have the cnn clip and
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:08.000]  others where they're calling for banning them and he's saying
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.480]  we should go the australian route which is banning everything but single shot
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.040]  bolt action if you get a special farm permit politics has to change and the
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:22.960]  people who are troubled by this have to be as intense and as organized and as
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:27.680]  adamant about this issue as folks
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.760]  on the other side who are absolutists and think that any
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:36.400]  gun safety measures are somehow an assault on freedom or
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:40.480]  communistic or a plot by me to
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:47.600]  you know take over and stay in power for
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.720]  ever or something i mean there are all kinds of crackpot
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:54.800]  conspiracy theories that float around there some of which by the way are
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.160]  ratified by elected officials in the other party
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.760]  on occasion so basically saying you're a conspiracy theory crackpot and
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:08.240]  ratifying these theories you know he is going to graduate up to the secretary
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.880]  general ship of the un or the head of one of these
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.440]  big mega banks that's what he says he wants to do
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:16.800]  that's what tony blair has gone on to do that's what clinton's gone on to do
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.600]  that's what clinton has said he wants as a secretary general ship but he's too
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.240]  sick obama can now get globally a lot of
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.880]  these muslim countries to vote for him that's over a billion people right
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:29.280]  there he can get all the liberals in europe to vote for him
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.120]  this is about global government he doesn't want to be the president of
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:36.640]  america indefinitely he wants to go on and dominate and control going back to
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:42.480]  our guest harry dent of harry dent dot com
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:48.080]  harry looking at this um the points i just made earlier i made a statement
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:51.520]  about they want us to pay for people's sex
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:54.800]  changes or basically they want us to pay for you know dumping drain oh in their
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.520]  eyes um i don't know if you know about this but that's
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:00.480]  mainstream television i never played the whole clip for the audience
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.080]  they they actually say in the newscast it's wonderful that she poured drain
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.920]  oh in her eyes to be blind like others as if it's bad that we have
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:12.400]  sight and blind folks don't uh so that we have to ban he or she or
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:15.760]  mother or father or boy or girl because it hurts folks that don't identify as
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.200]  that i don't know if you are aware of that pouring drain cleaner in your eyes
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:23.840]  the next trendy social justice movement from bandcroft television
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:27.200]  that's up on info wars dot com linking to mainstream news
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:33.200]  i mean what is this mass mental illness and i think that segues
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.360]  into uh some final statements from you what do you think about
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:41.200]  the culture itself i mean have we ever had an irrevocably
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.120]  damaged population like this that's truly
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:49.120]  i mean not the majority but a large minority of people
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:52.960]  uh that are of every race color and creed that literally
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:57.200]  have been artificially made mentally ill by the false reality
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:02.960]  of trendyism uh political correctness whatever it is
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:06.080]  i mean it's now a major movement that trans abled
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:10.000]  to pay to have people's arms and legs hacked off and then we pay for them
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.160]  for life to live in wheelchairs they're not playing games
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.800]  will we be conquered by people pouring drain oh in their eyes
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:22.800]  well i don't know about that one what i see alex is i've never seen
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:27.680]  this society this country so polarized um where people can't agree on anything
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:30.160]  and congress can't agree on anything because
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.560]  this boom has been so uneven it's been so rigged with special interest and
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:39.040]  and and low-cost money that favors certain sectors like
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.400]  wall stream stuff that you know this people have done extremely well and
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:46.080]  people who've done nothing but fallen behind and those two people can't see
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.840]  the world the same way and that really sets up sure but what here's
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:52.880]  my question just because listen i'm not trying to be absurd here
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:55.440]  uh you probably haven't seen there's have you heard about the trans abled
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:58.880]  movement and the gender bathrooms and i know you'll get into these politics but
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:01.760]  i mean this is a political assault by the establishment
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.760]  this is their response to make us so dependent cloward piven
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.320]  so mentally ill that we don't know which way is up i mean that's a real trend
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:14.000]  so i'm saying what's the master plan in your view you just answered the pop
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.280]  question it you know absolutely on target in my view
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.600]  and actually taught me something so i'm saying this is a plan in europe and here
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.320]  to turn the public into a bunch of dysfunctional mental
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.680]  illness factories what is the point of that
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:31.760]  obviously it's been allowed by all this free money what do these people do
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:35.360]  that uh once things collapse do we just let them starve in the streets
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:40.720]  because if not they're going to come after us like a giant school of piranha
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:43.920]  well you know the thing is you can't change all of this is much bigger than
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.600]  any of us we can't change this this is an inevitable crisis that
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:50.320]  has to happen after years and years of preventing it
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:54.080]  which only makes it worse it's like drinking more and more not to come down
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:57.520]  from the high or something or it's like feeding 50 grizzly bears in your
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:00.720]  backyard uh and then and then one day one you know
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:03.520]  it's going to kill you yeah all you can do is control your own
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:06.960]  circumstance if you get out of these risky assets stocks
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:10.320]  and real estate and stuff now you're going to preserve your gains
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:13.520]  and everybody else is going to see them just disappear overnight like in the
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:16.720]  great depression where you live is important
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.920]  i don't own any more real estate except for a place in the Caribbean
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:23.440]  because that's my getaway place if things get very bad
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.800]  if people have a choice of living on the outskirts of a major city
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:30.640]  or downtown pick the outskirts if you're living in the middle of the country
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.840]  between the two big mountain ranges the Rockies and Allegheny
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:36.640]  you're going to be in much better off than people are in
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:41.120]  highly dense highly bubbly coastal cities that are going to crash the most and
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.400]  have the most foreclosure yeah texas biggest problem is houston that is a
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:48.160]  time bomb yeah and you know last time we had a real
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.080]  estate crash texas was not hit they didn't bubble up but because of this
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.920]  fracking bubble and some other things texas did have more of a bubble this
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.800]  time so texas is going to have higher unemployment
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:02.960]  when all these fracking jobs are crime real estate is going to go down
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:08.160]  so so you just have to protect yourself and say look what can i do to be safe
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.880]  what what can i do to survive and how do i preserve as much wealth as i can and
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:16.320]  make it safe and liquid you don't you want to have it in very
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:19.840]  state a safe stuff you don't want to have to be sitting in a bank account
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.280]  where they can loan against and say oops i'm sorry we lost the money don't have
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:26.480]  has to be in your own investment account you have to be in safe
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:30.160]  short-term bonds and even long-term treasury bonds
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:33.360]  and and and the best corporate bonds those are the only two things that did
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:36.400]  well in the great depression real estate commodities
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.400]  stocks all did horrible for a decade what about what i mentioned before the
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:42.160]  break the accelerated move towards the
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.880]  totalitarianism a do you agree that's happening around the world
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.320]  and b well do you think it'll be successful
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:51.280]  for the establishment well i think you're going to get both
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.960]  establishments going to lose a lot of uh confidence especially the federal
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.480]  reserve but yes when things get bad and when crime goes up
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:01.760]  and more people are unemployed and there's more social unrest
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:06.080]  there's going to be attempts to kind of control things and make things okay so i
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.880]  think you're going to see disintegration and
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:12.880]  more kind of top-down control at the same time in the end
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:17.840]  i think the disintegration is going to win well this elite is so corrupt and so
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:20.640]  decadent disintegration is better than total
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:24.960]  enslavement it is it is now i'm pulling for the
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.600]  disintegration i'm pulling for everybody facing reality
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:31.760]  realize we can't stimulate the economy forever we can't get something for nothing
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:36.160]  we can't work for 40 years and then and then be on the dole for health care
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:40.560]  and social security for 22 years now that our life expectancy gone up 10 years in
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.000]  the last several decades we're so out of reality and so many things
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  that a crisis is the only way to fix it special interest control everything
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.280]  you can't deal with that every special interest will fight you
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:55.280]  but when the system breaks down they're going to lose their power as well so i
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.920]  think this is again a necessary and an inevitable crisis
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:04.960]  and that's why they're scurrying around trying to put bigger institutions
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:08.720]  and power in uh is to try to control all this but these are illegitimate
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:12.560]  institutions now that are totally corrupt they need to disintegrate
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.080]  they need to disintegrate no question about it again a crisis is the only way
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:19.040]  to do at this point you could never fix this politically at this point it's
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:22.160]  gotten too extreme
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:25.920]  harry dent dot com harry dent i want to thank you so much for joining us

[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:05.280]  how long do you think it'll take till we see the disintegration of
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:10.160]  a lot of this global system i think that this broader crisis is going to last
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.760]  in the early part of next decade we've set from the beginning but this winter
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.960]  season we call it starts in 2008 and it ends around 2022 or so
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:22.400]  but i think we're going to see the worst for the financial markets
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:26.720]  literally in the next year or year and a half so so that's what you got to worry
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:29.280]  about first after that you got to worry about social
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:33.040]  unrest and all these other things all right thanks for spending time with us

[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.960]  and then we've got paul watson's video conservatism the new counterculture
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.520]  muslim press is claiming saudi kingsman hospitalized for dementia
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:30.800]  so that's just some of the news that we have
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:36.160]  up there let me get to some of that news that i just spoke of
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.000]  ap investigation nuclear black market
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.760]  seeks is extremists the fbi has busted these individuals i'll go over
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:49.840]  trying to find isis to sell them dirty bomb material reportedly
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.480]  over the uh pulsating beat of an exclusive nightclub the arm smuggler
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.640]  made his pitch to a client 2.5 million euros for enough
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:02.160]  radioactive cesium to contaminate several city blocks
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:05.840]  it was earlier this year and the two men were plotting their deal
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.520]  at an unlikely spot the terrace of cocoa
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:14.400]  prive a dance club and sushi bar in the capital of
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.240]  moldovia you can make a dirty bomb which would
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:20.720]  be perfect for the islamic state the smuggler said
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.640]  if you have a connection with them the businesses will go smoothly
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:28.800]  but the smuggler wasn't sure the client was for real
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.280]  and he was right to worry the client was an informant and it took 20 meetings
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:36.880]  to persuade him that he was authentic islamic state representative
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:40.880]  eventually the two men exchanged cash for a sample in a sting operation
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:45.280]  that landed him in jail and this is the big national news the point is
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:49.360]  that isis he did say six months ago that infiltrate europe through immigrant
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.560]  waves they did it and europe's answer is to say come on in
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:59.200]  the french president hollandaise sauce uh
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:03.120]  french hollandaise hollandaise i always say it wrong
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:07.920]  muslim rift threatens total war
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.000]  and we'll go over that story when we come back
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.120]  from break we have the clip of him saying it and again we have hillary
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.520]  making the big joke uh then we're going to get to uh thousands of
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:23.520]  drug inmates approved for early prison release
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:27.120]  so i've got to say that there's some good news going on
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:30.560]  there because we shouldn't have nonviolent offenders
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:34.480]  in jail in my view if it's victimless crimes that is
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:37.440]  the tactical firearm trade show the gun grabbers don't want you to see that's a
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.320]  video up on info wars dot com joe biggs out there
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.160]  covering that that's not really the big news yet though dealt to force use ieds

[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:39.120]  here's hillary clinton on the campaign trail
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:42.480]  and then she tells her minions what to say it's highly scripted
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:46.720]  and so this is directly from her this is this is her view this is what she's
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:50.720]  going to feed the public this is the incredible criminal arrogance
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:54.640]  i think we're starting to really see an impact across the state of iowa
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:58.880]  and especially here in muscatine as we continue to educate voters
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.040]  about what the real issues are set aside all that who ha
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:07.680]  about emails and this and then god's in luck who cares
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:12.720]  i want to know what tomorrow's about not what yesterday's about
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:16.320]  so this is the criminal arrogance and then we've got these campaign ads that
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:19.840]  she's running where she's like they're attacking me because i want to help you
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:22.880]  and i love you and you know i'm fighting
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.240]  against the evil rich people and i i'm not an insider
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:30.240]  that we've got one of those ads right here here it is
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:33.760]  the republicans finally admit it republican kevin mccarthy
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:37.760]  saying the committee investigating bangazi and clinton's emails was created
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:42.000]  to destroy her candidacy everybody thought hillary clinton was unbeatable
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.360]  right but we put together a bangazi special
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:49.200]  committee what are her numbers today republicans have spent millions attacking
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.000]  hillary because she's fighting for everything they oppose
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.400]  from affordable health care to equal pay she'll never stop fighting for you
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:00.800]  and the republicans know it i'm hillary clinton and i approved this message
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.400]  well i thought we got the free health care then it doubled doubled in price
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:08.160]  and it's collapsing man i watch these people when i go to a doctor's clinic
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:12.320]  a couple times a year and i see especially these democrats old white
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:15.360]  women old black women you name it and they get up to the counter and they go
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:18.240]  excuse me i just came in here a couple months ago this one was all happening a
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:21.920]  few years ago they'd say man this is obama care you see right here it's
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:25.040]  actually has a fee there and that's what your insurance company did that man
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:30.720]  we're sorry and they'll just walk out like they got hit by a mac truck
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:35.920]  oh but now hillary's gonna fight for it the rockefeller plan from the fifties
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:41.360]  the exact same plan they now got that the republicans wrote

[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:48.320]  republican leadership works hand and glove with them they're just battling

[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:54.400]  lower down and those are the people that are really

[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:39.120]  some shady bleepy some shady hillary that according to a
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:42.560]  letter sent monday to by wisconsin u.s senator john

[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:00.080]  to continue the bubble the criminal bubble criminals run bubbles
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.960]  and if you're gonna commit one crime why not commit a thousand i'm gonna commit a
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:07.760]  million don't commit one murder not why not commit a billion
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:12.000]  so just just the satisfaction this criminal has look at this photo of

[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:28.480]  little bit of fun just look at that satisfied criminal smugness
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:32.880]  disgusting warthog you know i've got a lot of intellectual things to say about
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:34.880]  hillary but i'll be honest i'm sick of it
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:38.400]  u.s bombing of a doctors without borders hospital in afghanistan
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:42.240]  was no accident it was a target i'm gonna get to that after we go to some calls
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:45.760]  and more on france's president says muslim rethreatens total war i've been
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.880]  mentioning that but that's big all right now lucas in arizona thanks for
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:54.720]  holding her on the air hi you there alex yes sir
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:58.640]  hi um i just wanted to make two quick points
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:06.560]  um so yesterday twitter launched its moments uh
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:09.440]  i guess i don't know what you would call it but it's pretty much like uh
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:16.880]  facebook uh mentioned so what it was is hillary clinton was
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:21.840]  the first topic just happened to be so i click on it scroll through
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:25.520]  one of the headlines is hillary clinton if
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:32.320]  we can't decide mutually i will make an executive order to take the gun
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:37.920]  so that already was just a blow in the face like wow
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:46.080]  keep going you're right okay and another one um i just wanted to
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:49.440]  ask if you've ever heard about a book called
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:57.040]  um the giver it's by mois lowery and pretty much i my sixth grade teacher
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:00.320]  led it to me in the class and pretty much when you
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:06.320]  talk about this like society of political correctness and whatnot this
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:10.320]  book just comes to mind all it is i went and saw the movie it's it's
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:13.200]  absolutely what they're actually it's an allegory for what they're trying to
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:19.680]  establish i just every time you talk it just blows my mind
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:23.280]  on how similar it sounds to that book and like
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:27.600]  already when i was young because i'm i'm 19 now so i'm not like
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:31.760]  sure i never read the book but that's art imitating life
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:35.680]  that's what they want to build but we already are all givers
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:39.840]  some more than others we already don't have the knowledge of everybody but we
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:44.400]  have it of our ancestors we have it of the species
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.920]  and so that's why no matter how much dumbing down they try to engage in
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:52.720]  our bodies are so much more powerful our souls so much more powerful
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:56.480]  than the system that we're basically like insects they try to exterminate
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:59.280]  just mutate around it they're gonna make us more powerful
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:03.360]  presidential candidates today strategize over every last detail of a
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:06.480]  candidate's image especially an identity candidate like
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:10.080]  hillary how important is it for there to be a woman president
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:14.400]  in the united states national journal has pointed out that candidates now view
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:18.720]  soundtracks as a key part of that carefully crafted image
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:22.160]  so maybe hillary should choose a campaign song that plays
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:29.760]  against type you know humble i'm sorry hillary has paid a consulting firm
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:33.680]  nine thousand dollars to create a soundtrack for her campaign
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:36.960]  i just don't think people would believe this song though
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:41.120]  she's being abandoned by unions by multinational corporate donors who are
[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:44.720]  worried 44 percent of her twitter followers
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:50.880]  1.4 million are fake maybe her campaign theme should be
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:54.800]  i need somebody help not just anybody

[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:41.600]  the first time it happened we thought the russians got lucky then it happened
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:46.480]  two more times said one official both officials not servants said that the
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:50.480]  incidents took place over ices controlled syria including its de facto
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:56.400]  headquarters in raga as well as along the turkish-syrian border
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:59.600]  another occurred in the northwest near the highly
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:03.680]  contested city of aleppo that's the main battle that's kind of like the
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:07.600]  stalin grad of the linen grad there of world war two aleppo
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:12.320]  the u.s military's mq1 predator drone is not a stealth aircraft
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:16.880]  it is easy to see a predator on radar said the official
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:20.640]  the russians have not attempted to shoot down any of the u.s drones but instead
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:24.880]  of flown intercept tracks a doctrinal terming that russians
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:30.880]  flew close enough to make their presence felt according to one official
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:34.320]  it should just be one airman or one you know it's official official official
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:38.480]  we're official we're official uh one other official official official official
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:43.920]  said the russians flew very close but did not impede the drone flight
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:47.840]  you're not invited in under international law to syria you sent in proxy armies
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:50.880]  to murder everybody now you think we're so politically ignorant everybody
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:54.400]  doesn't know that you run ices you run al qaeda the pentagon knows it
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:58.160]  they don't like it it's all come out because we're not just going to sit here
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:02.240]  and let you control the narrative meanwhile i mentioned this earlier
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:05.520]  daily mail we will cut your filthy head
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:10.400]  child ices jihad taunts dog of roam obama
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:14.080]  to submit to the caliphate or die in direct video threat
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:17.120]  probably produced by the white house or a subsidiary and this has come out they've
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:20.960]  done things like this uh totally fake you know with eight foot tall ices people
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:24.160]  taking folks to be beheaded it looks like stanley cubrick produced it it's so
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:27.120]  well done uh this is to make him look like he's being
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:32.640]  tough on islamic radicals two domestic idiots
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:40.400]  continuing here i always get disgusted by racial stereotypes and racial
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:46.720]  comments spewed and pushed incessantly by racist
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:50.000]  black people and then media statements by mainly white people that
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.200]  blacks can't be racist and this is a real culture of enslavement
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:59.520]  that they've been pushing to say the least i mean it's
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:03.600]  true slavery that's not rhetoric there that anybody who
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:07.040]  wants to be successful anybody who wants to just associate with everybody
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:11.200]  anybody who wants to own a company whose black is a sellout
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:14.080]  anybody who dresses nice as a sellout anybody that's got a nice car unless
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:18.880]  they're a drug dealer is a sellout i mean these are the stereotypes
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:23.520]  that that that the klan and others put out to suppress black people and now
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:27.840]  blacks have accepted it all because they follow mtv and the very culture that
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:30.640]  wants to destroy them
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:35.040]  i mean you don't think some of the red stones out dating black people do you
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:38.960]  or you know the the clippers owner do you know but
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:42.640]  they're sure pushing all this death culture on black folks and everybody
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.840]  else picks it up thinking it's cool it's like picking up a hang grenade and
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:50.240]  pulling the pin university of pencil vanya professor
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:57.280]  anitha butler called presidential candidate ben carson a coon
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:00.240]  i've never even heard a white person use that term but i've heard a lot of black
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.400]  people use it for claiming that people have the right to display
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:08.480]  confederate flags on private property well i mean that's just a fact
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:13.200]  you can fly swastikas you can fly chinese flags you can fly
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:17.920]  uh mcdonald's flag you can fly easter bunny flag a gopher flag a caddy shack
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:22.480]  flag actually have one i mean you yes that's because i'm racist against
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:26.320]  gophers kill all the golfers i'd go to jail
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:32.560]  the golfers anyways it continues if only there was a
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:36.000]  coon of the year award professor butler ben these people push racism
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.840]  tweeted in response to another tweet linking to sports illustrated article
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:43.520]  in which carson was quoted defending the right of nascar fans to fly confederate
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:45.600]  flags well that's because he's educated not an ignorant
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:49.680]  ramus and not a class warfare person he knows the confederate flag
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:54.960]  means a hundred different things i mean if somebody appropriates
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:58.560]  doc martins who's a nazi does that mean someone wearing
[02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:06.560]  punk rock boots is a is a nazi no most people wearing them aren't a nazi
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:10.480]  oh man you know when i was in high school i wore all sorts of cowboy boots
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:13.520]  tennis shoes i was ignorant i heard some punk rock
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:16.000]  music i liked some of it didn't like most of it but
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.600]  one time i was at the shopping mall and bought a black pair of doc martins
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:23.440]  and i had like cute punk girls coming up to me wanting to go on a date
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:28.400]  uh i had uh women that liked it uh you know i say girls like 16 year olds when
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:31.120]  i was 16 uh and i but i also had like white
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:34.640]  supremacist coming over you know saying you are you 88 you howl hitler
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:38.000]  and also had like other skater people pulled gore you were racist we're gonna
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.080]  beat your ass you know stuff like that just not knowing what these symbols
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:45.200]  mean so so that's all the political correctness around that
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:48.960]  but then meanwhile you've got black people parading around
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:51.600]  i was going off the doc martins because they can mean a lot of different things
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:53.840]  and just because somebody's ignorant about it doesn't mean you got to ban it
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:55.920]  it was like banning doc martins you know some schools
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:20:01.760]  ban doc martins in in school we use mobile devices right against our bodies

[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:16.640]  but there is a paradox obviously from the huge drudge interview yesterday that
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:20.560]  I'm still trying to analyze it was so informative powerful
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:23.920]  historic really and he doesn't do a lot of those interviews he is
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:28.400]  the king of internet media news news period pretty much when it comes to
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:31.600]  being able to put a story out there and get attention to it
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:34.960]  and he gave us a big exclusive like 45 minute long
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:39.360]  interview yesterday I I know we've got callers Lucas
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:44.800]  and Eva and Nathaniel and Brandon and Phil we're going to get to all of you
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:47.680]  but the interest of time I want to have a little bit of fun right now on political
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:51.120]  correctness and I'll go to your calls right when we start the next segment
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:55.600]  because it's longer but I'm going to play this
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:02.400]  to hopefully court controversy because this is amongst the band
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:05.760]  looney tunes cartoons and I mean there are some from the 40s and stuff that you
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:09.360]  could say were super stereotypical and are meant to be racist
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:13.520]  but that's but by the way the those band cartoons
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:17.360]  still air in Latin America in Africa in Asia
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:20.240]  because the folks that are being made fun of love it
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:24.800]  because the truth is it's not fake making fun of a cowboy
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:29.120]  if you show your 70s Sam is three feet tall and going
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:32.480]  hates rabbits and acting goofy and ridiculous
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:37.120]  it's not making fun of white people it's making fun of that stereotype of
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:40.480]  goofy white people that think they're tough
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:44.720]  it's an archetype and so I was making the joke about Hasan
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:47.840]  chop from Aladdin's lamp so we looked it up
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:51.680]  the public's so ignorant the youtube channel that's got it says Bugs Bunny in
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:57.200]  India Aladdin's lamp is in Saudi Arabia
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:01.360]  I forget the name of the book I read when I was a kid it's a classic Arabian
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:04.080]  nights it's a whole bunch of stories it's thick
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:10.000]  still have the blue book on my bookshelf my son read it years ago again
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:16.400]  but they have this does not air this is on the list of band ones
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:23.040]  and that's why we're going to play it for cultural fair use
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:27.520]  analysis because it's important to look at it and understand
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:32.080]  a lot of different things it's not attacking country people
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:36.960]  having a 70 Sam or you know showing little John as being fat and stupid
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:39.680]  they don't want to show images like that now they're trying to restrict them this
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:44.320]  is a war on information a war on free speech a war on culture a war on ideas
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:48.560]  a war on real liberalism that these people are the opposite of

[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:14.640]  that's what that is I just realized this went and found the clip
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:20.400]  that's not from the same show they put something in so maybe it's a joke I
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:22.480]  don't get it but the rest of it is Warner Brothers
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:25.040]  here it is

[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:18.640]  oh my gosh I can't tell you how many people I've tried to work with and I've
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:22.560]  tried to help that think I need them and then I'm weak so they
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:26.480]  stabbed me in the back after I try to help build a media operation
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:29.680]  and that's why it's so refreshing with drudge is that he really wants to help
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:33.280]  other people to promote liberty and build them up and and and so it's good
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:35.360]  to actually be in the position where somebody's bigger than I am and it's
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:38.800]  helping me and helping us fight for freedom and to realize he gets it in
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:40.960]  his classy but I think if a lot of people have
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:44.240]  helped they're kind of like daffy duck just too stupid to
[02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:47.440]  too stupid too evil too twisted to really want to fight tyranny they're in
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:51.360]  the liberty movement just to make money we're on the march the empire's on the
[02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:59.520]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:18.400]  it isn't really about drudge even being on the show even though that was
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:22.160]  interesting very interesting on a rickshaw scale it's about a 10
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:26.000]  for me i can't think of anything else more interesting in my
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:29.760]  20 plus years on air maybe the maybe the
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:32.400]  pierce Morgan interview and that was drudge again sending him tweets saying why
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:34.800]  don't you have him on then if you're attacking
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:39.600]  and they told me yeah we got you on because drudge thought it was a good idea
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:43.760]  that's how those egomaniacs work i guess at that level well drudge said and kind
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:46.960]  of it is a good idea let's have you up and i played stupid on the phone and
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:51.520]  everything with them and acted dumb it was ridiculous just to get on the air
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:54.880]  with him live because that's what they do not like that to happen but uh there's
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:57.840]  just been massive coverage of it
[02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:01.440]  there's serious articles in places like the hill and the daily caller and
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:05.920]  uh politico somewhat serious but here's what the hubby and post put out and
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:09.440]  others hilariously paranoid matt drudge appears on conspiracy
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:12.960]  monger alec stone show to slag salon demand

[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:27.360]  that's a uh another report cnn here's another one drudge hillary clinton's
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:31.200]  brain in a jar could get elected politico
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:35.840]  matt drudge gives incredibly rare interview to alex jones talks hillary
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:40.960]  and sick america so very glad that drudge came on and gave us
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:44.080]  the last interview it was like five minutes long and it was national news
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:48.080]  this was 40 something minutes long it's on info wars dot com if you missed it
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:50.400]  yesterday
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:54.080]  that is definitely something that is going to be a
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:59.440]  rebroadcaster multiple times one of the best interviews ever
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:02.720]  i i interrupt a lot of guests because if i think they're boring or they're
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:06.080]  droning on or i want to add something that ties together and it's obnoxious
[02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:09.120]  sometimes i agree i do it a little too much i've gotten a bit
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:12.160]  better over the years when i want to talk down i'll just hog the show and not
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:16.880]  have guests or you know take calls and but i tell you what drudge i shut up
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:18.800]  about 90 percent of the time because it was really interesting i mean i got to
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:24.880]  talk for five hours uh and a lot of great insights
[02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:28.560]  you know he doesn't drink and he's a he's an exercise guy uh i shouldn't have
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:32.800]  two glasses of red wine maybe three because by the end of it i wasn't
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:35.760]  really sleepy it was like a two-hour dinner but
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:38.320]  i just should have really been on my toes because it was a lot of interesting
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:41.200]  stuff he was saying i mean so much of it i've been thinking about it
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:43.440]  really interesting and i've talked to folks a lot that knowing well
[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:46.320]  Watson knows him you know been out to dinner with him and stuff
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:50.000]  and i've um i've always just gotten messages through from him or people
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:55.040]  relaying things he's that elusive um i'll leave it at that
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:37:00.320]  otherwise we've communicated but it's interesting because it's not just
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:04.160]  somebody being reclusive to create the mystique
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:08.720]  he did that after a bunch of persecution which i'm not going to get into
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:12.960]  but the persecution of everybody is intensifying and they want to put
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:17.200]  everybody in jail folks and i've talked to a lot of other
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:20.720]  high-powered people i've talked to
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:25.760]  it's not even really known he doesn't make a big deal out of it
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:28.160]  i wasn't told this by drudge i already knew this because i've talked to him
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:32.160]  quite frequently um it's no secret off air i won't really reveal what he tells
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:33.840]  me but michael savage i need to call him
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:36.800]  they haven't talked in a while we talk a bunch that we don't talk for a few
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:39.440]  months and you know he says on air they're coming
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:43.040]  for us they're going to kill everybody but uh you know if they keep getting power
[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:45.600]  but i mean the behind the scenes stuff and you know michael savage doesn't need
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:48.800]  to be on air he sold like 20 something new york times best
[02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:52.560]  sellers it was just sick he had a whole another persona as
[02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:55.840]  like the guy that kind of brought herbs and minerals and vitamins in in the
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:58.720]  60s and 70s and then he created a bunch of other huge
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:03.120]  phenomenons well his wife and son did
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:06.000]  i mean i'm not even going to get into the stuff that people own and created and
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.560]  they they made their money themselves michael savage is worth billions
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:15.680]  billion i shouldn't be getting into it the point is it's not a secret
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:19.920]  i didn't get that even from him it's just that he doesn't need the money
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:24.960]  at 73 years old he genuinely is concerned about what's happening
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:28.640]  and what's going on and wants to do more and my problem is i'm so busy i haven't
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:33.120]  even been able to figure out how to i'm not going to get into it
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:36.960]  it's just it's very retrospective the stuff that's going on
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:40.160]  let's go to your phone calls you're a real trooper evan in new york because you

[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:24.880]  the extent of life that we could live up to to even
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:28.720]  we're what while we're in the womb and i just see the culture where it's
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:31.440]  revolving around in now this year i battled cancer
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:35.280]  so i had a lot of time to reflect well also in prayer
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:40.240]  and uh i decided to go back to writing and i'm writing a book series um a
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:44.320]  children's book series that that'll evolve to teenager years um
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:48.720]  kind of a uh spiritual book but uh could relate to what's going on so i could
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.080]  battle the new world order uh and relate to what's going on
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:55.760]  in a book so i could get it out to the children
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:59.280]  before they get to our children and then it could get to the teenagers
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:03.440]  and get to us absolutely art and culture that's based on liberty and
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:10.160]  individualism is the wooden stake through count
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:14.560]  Dracula's heart exactly i was and you know uh i'd actually
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:19.040]  like to give you uh personally um my writings to you i'd love
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:22.480]  you to read it and share with your son i think the two of you would love it
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:26.720]  uh well i'd love to see if i don't want to get it till you've published it
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:31.040]  no i was i i i feel free i'd love you to hear it uh hear me out about it
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:34.560]  uh i just like to see what what do you think what your thoughts well i would
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:38.160]  love i would love to commit to tell you that i would end up reading it i'm not
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:41.120]  sure i would have time but i would definitely give it to my son to read
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:44.640]  i'll be honest with i got so much to read it makes my head spin but i want to
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:48.320]  um my eyes just get tired from you know the the amount of reading i already do
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:50.880]  but uh it used to be a pleasure now it's
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:54.400]  not a pleasure some of the time but yes i'd love to hear about your book
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:58.880]  what are you planning to call the series um it's called the divine warrior
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:04.320]  um it's basically about chosen orphan boy who is chosen by god to find these
[02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:08.400]  six pieces of armor hidden around the world so uh oh that's awesome that's a
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:11.680]  great way to for kids to get into the armor of god
[02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:16.080]  yeah so actually the physical armor now so i relate to everything from
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:19.920]  the uh cup of christ to the permissionary
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:22.800]  so the cultural revolves around the modern times because it takes place now in
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:25.600]  our time well that sounds exciting and it sounds like a
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:29.120]  hit brother what what do you want to say about the breakup of the family
[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:33.120]  um well i think uh you know we need to just go back to things you talk about
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:37.920]  uh is is going back to our lord is uh revolving around that and revolving
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:41.120]  around forgiveness uh you know it's one of the strongest
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:44.960]  things to do is not go for revenge but forgive
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:48.640]  well i i've learned to do that i mean i never really did a lot of revenge
[02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:53.440]  stuff but i would enjoy people lying about me and wanting to
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:55.440]  destroy me and they're not being able to and i
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:43:00.240]  repented of that um five six years ago i pretty much quit it
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:03.280]  in the last three years and i've been a lot happier
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:06.800]  it's been a lot better uh and now i just feel sorry for him and then if
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:10.480]  somebody's productive other than attacking me i'll actually reach out to
[02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:13.120]  him and support him and i'll say go ahead and keep attacking it's okay i
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:16.480]  understand but i'm going to help you with this other good work you're doing
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:20.400]  and it always ends up turning them around so uh it's it's really a good
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:23.760]  thing and i hear you god bless you great to hear from you and and puts you on
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:28.560]  hold because we're going to send you um we hang up on him

[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:11.680]  very serious well i like your voice so please continue
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:15.280]  okay the other day you was talking about um
[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:19.600]  the that that the guy who was killing people he asked them whether christians
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:23.120]  then then he he shot them and i heard you say
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:27.360]  with my own ears there's someone asked you were you a christian
[02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:33.200]  you would say no well this is very important uh the bible says in matthew
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:39.920]  that chapter 10 verse 30 whoever denied jesus christ before me and
[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:43.920]  jesus said i would deny them before my father i know that quote and you're
[02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:46.400]  right i thought about that after i was being
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:50.080]  honest and i was asking the audience what they thought
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:53.840]  and i was asking joe bigs i mean there's also parts in the bible
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:58.400]  where the spies are going into a city and they're told you know lie about being a
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:01.840]  spy i mean i lie when i went inside bohemian grove if somebody was sticking
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:05.440]  ahead to say my children's heads you know a gun it was saying i'm going to blow
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:09.280]  their heads off i mean i'm not going to lie i think
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:14.080]  number one out of charge the guy uh so and i'm not saying i'm tough i guarantee
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:17.200]  us i mean i try to get away or i charge him i mean that's just how i am i wonder
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:20.480]  why people don't do that that shows the domestication so i was honest and i
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:24.160]  think it's open for debate and i absolutely hear what you're saying
[02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:27.440]  and i understand it's about not done you know denying christ for men and getting
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:31.680]  burned at you know the stake or being killed by the lions and i get
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:36.560]  that that happened uh and so i was being honest with
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:40.720]  the fact and i was talking about when i do lie because see that's being super
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:46.960]  truthful admitting that you know i
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:50.560]  i'll sit there to you know say i had a girlfriend and she said it just
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:52.880]  you like this dress i've learned they don't want to know the truth i'll say
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:54.960]  yeah that's fine honey i kind of like that one better though
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:59.280]  that's a lie so i wasn't being a liar on the big issues and lying is not good
[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:02.720]  i'm so truthful it's really freaks people out
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:05.680]  uh and i've had a lot of problems telling the truth also a lot of good stuff
[02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:10.720]  so then i was being so truthful i was saying i wonder if god would judge you
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:14.400]  if to not be killed i mean a bunch of christians didn't deny christ and got
[02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:17.920]  killed and i think they have incredible courage but
[02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:21.200]  i just still kind of wish they'd have had the courage to attack this piece of
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:26.800]  trash what do you think well alex attacking is one thing but but but
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:30.000]  but let me please let me finish what i'm sorry i'm sorry
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:36.960]  okay um the bible says now if you are not a christian then you can deny Jesus
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:42.240]  christ peter denied Jesus christ three times but remember Jesus christ said
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:47.280]  peter when thou art converted strengthen the brother now
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:51.680]  peter was chosen he was called but at that time
[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:54.800]  he denied Jesus christ he was not converted yet
[02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:57.840]  that's what i do is pray say it when thou art converted
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:47:01.600]  strengthen the brother power was persecuting christians
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:05.680]  but he was still called he was still chosen but he was not saved
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:09.040]  at that time and then later he did not deny christ and they all got killed no
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:12.640]  you you have corrected me i get up here without a teleprompter i just speak from
[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:17.680]  my heart and you're absolutely right uh that i think somebody is in
[02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:22.560]  mortal danger of being denied by christ at the white throne judgment if you don't
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:26.080]  i guess i guess you're meant to be killed i guess you're right
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:32.160]  you know i thank god for your honesty and so because when people hear you
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:36.400]  millions of people might say well i can do the same thing
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:39.840]  no i know i just speak from my heart i just constantly say what i really think
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:45.680]  and you know i admit i mean i admit that that's what i was thinking i mean i
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:50.000]  i'm number one it wouldn't get to that point because i'd be attacking them
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:53.520]  but now you know because we want people to realize
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:57.600]  if you are christian please do not deny jesus christ
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:02.400]  you got people that may think well i can take the mark of the beast being
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:06.560]  and you're absolutely right and now that you say it i got caught up thinking
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:10.720]  about just wishing they hadn't been killed and i was deceived and now that
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:14.480]  you you called up and reproved me and straightened me up and that's what i
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:17.200]  need that's what we need to get other people straight we all get off
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:20.720]  we all need people to to give us loving advice and you did that my friend
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:24.320]  nathaniel thank you so much was there anything else you wanted to explain to
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:27.120]  me yes sir it's the one thing well first of all
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:30.880]  thank god for your heart that you did you received that god bless you you are
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:34.480]  a precious brother now one more thing is very very important
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:38.000]  i hear you talk about kicking back the country and everything
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:45.280]  well alex when the info wars and a prison planet and matt george and all of you
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:50.160]  all i can see y'all slowing down the new world order before
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:53.680]  stopping it when the antichrist come on the scene
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:57.920]  and the beast and the first prophet we're not going to be able to stop them
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:02.320]  the bible says the antichrist makes war upon the saints and overcomes them yes
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:05.920]  and he's going to wear the saints out only to this christ he's going to come
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:09.760]  and destroy the antichrist and cast the beast and first prophet
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:16.640]  is to the vicar fire now again i can see you slowing down no no no i agree with
[02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:20.240]  you but but then they christians and other people that that hate tyranny
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:23.200]  whoever you are should be speaking out and warning people
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:28.000]  because what matters is your intellect your soul uh your consciousness and
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.560]  that's what the globalist is trying to take in fact we'll come into the next
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:35.440]  segment with we want your soul because that's what they want
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:38.320]  and so people say well god's just going to get me out of this
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:41.280]  so i'll stand up well people had to go on the lines then they had to go in the
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:44.480]  fiery furnace and sometimes you got to go up there and you know get hung up on
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:47.520]  a cross or get your head chopped off or get boiled in oil and
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:51.440]  all the things they did i get that and so you're absolutely right and i just get
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:55.120]  up here sometimes in a fever of news and information
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:58.080]  that's why i've said many times i hear rebroadcast all the time and hear stuff
[02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:03.040]  i say that's wrong or that i don't agree with or where i misspoke
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:06.240]  there's a reason they have teleprompters there's a reason they they script stuff
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:09.200]  because other people would stick their foot in their mouth more than me but
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:11.440]  you're absolutely right god bless you i appreciate
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:14.720]  your call sir great call i love calls like that because

[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:40.240]  servants of evil and no amount of verbal
[02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:47.920]  semantic acrobatic ballet can describe the true depths
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:54.480]  of those that have taken control of this planet and now want to take control of
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:58.080]  the individual the entire life cycle so that they
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:03.440]  can rise as the new demagogues of planet terra firma
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:31.520]  let's crack this up
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:38.640]  i'm going to be honest again with the audience
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:43.040]  i dropped the ball routinely in many ways i am losing to the globalist
[02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:46.720]  in many ways i'm a guinea pig at an example
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:52.240]  of how you can be enslaved even while knowing it even while hating it
[02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:56.480]  now my my my greatest failure is my greatest success and i only tell you
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:55:59.680]  this so that you can learn from it hopefully
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:02.720]  from my experiences you can help teach me as well just like i just learned
[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:05.920]  from that last caller deeply
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:10.800]  i'm able to get people out of their trance i'm able to get upset
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:14.880]  because i'm upset telegraph telegraph that
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:19.200]  in a genuine way that reaches people
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:23.680]  but i also get so close to tyranny that when
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:27.600]  they announce open world government to take over every major u.s city
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:31.600]  with you and advisors for political correctness police
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:37.040]  and to go after our guns i haven't made a big enough deal about it
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:44.640]  i saw yesterday when hillary said i will sign an executive order
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:50.320]  and we will take the guns i mean that was a quote cnn said the same thing msnbc
[02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:53.600]  i've seen all these clips i should have walked into one of the great guys that
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:56.000]  can edit real fast and do a good job putting this up together like darin
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:59.600]  mcgreen and said darin here are these clips
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:02.800]  let's show biden saying no one wants to take any of your guns
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:07.440]  and then cut to a bunch of people saying it including the new clips
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:13.440]  and then let's cut to hillary saying it and then let's cut back to obama two
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:17.840]  days ago saying no one wants your guns it's a crackpot conspiracy theory
[02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:21.520]  because that's what counters these people gruber going we lie to these dumb
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:25.120]  idiots and triple their prices
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:28.800]  the academics roll rubbing their hands oh yes oh evil
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:33.280]  i mean you know then you go and i never said that i never work with obama
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:38.160]  i work with obama i work with obama you know show all the clips of them lying
[02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:45.040]  so we can't ever get outrage fatigue we have to get upset with these scum and
[02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:49.920]  throw our full energy against them and i'm exhausted fighting them sometimes
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:52.880]  but you know it's got to be done
[02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:57.760]  hillary clinton's gun control proposals to include executive action
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:01.200]  democratic presidential candidate would expand definition of who is in
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:06.320]  business of selling firearms and would ban with executive action the private
[02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:09.920]  sale of firearms or trading
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:15.520]  that means giving your son or daughter a firearm but her actual quote was that
[02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:19.680]  she didn't take executive action to take the guns
[02:58:19.680 --> 02:58:24.160]  so they're coming we're gonna go to break i'm gonna do five more minutes to

[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:48.080]  okay uh thanks for taking my call i wanted to comment on the situation in
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:52.160]  europe i can't believe that uh the german government has come out and said
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:55.520]  that they're gonna take the children away from people that even make
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:00:59.600]  comments about who we kind of don't like the you know immigrant
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:02.480]  invasion that's right they said you're not doing but they said you're not
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:05.520]  criticizing any of it or we will take your children and find you and imprison
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:08.080]  you that is beyond nazi germany
[03:01:08.080 --> 03:01:12.240]  i hear that man and i just feel sick to my stomach and sick to my head
[03:01:12.240 --> 03:01:15.920]  but i mean you're liberal though i mean merkel's liberal it's okay
[03:01:15.920 --> 03:01:18.960]  why are you against a woman bro
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:25.040]  well no i i saw that great report by uh paul joseph watching on the fact that
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:29.200]  the four out of five refugees are in fact not even syrian
[03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:32.800]  and that most of them are economic migrants and i think it's really sick
[03:01:32.800 --> 03:01:36.720]  because i'm looking at an article right now most of our men news
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:41.360]  yeah it says almost 50 million e u residents live without enough money
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:45.440]  even to heat their homes and these people are supposed to come in and your
[03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:49.600]  government is going to come in and tax yeah because you're not as valuable
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:52.320]  as the illegal aliens you're supposed to pay for
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:55.520]  this is robbery this is political correctness is
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:01:59.360]  soviet redistribution with big mega banks administering the money this is
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:02.400]  total social engineering on a mass scale
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:08.480]  and i i think i think if people don't try just in any peaceful way possible to
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:11.520]  change things europe is going to be heading to a complete
[03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:15.440]  children of men's situation no that's it but let's expand yeah you understand
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:18.160]  they're they're passing bills at the federal and state level it's already
[03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:21.520]  happening where the illegals in this country whether they're white chinese
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:24.480]  or hispanic it doesn't matter they're getting free everything free
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:29.120]  tuition obama care that the public doesn't get free but for them it is
[03:02:29.120 --> 03:02:33.040]  so i mean it is the takedown brother they want to
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:36.080]  look do banks want you to pay off your farm loan
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:39.520]  no they they want to call it all in a year early and make it go bankrupt
[03:02:39.520 --> 03:02:43.360]  i mean that's how banks you know get rich as they get all that property
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:45.680]  there's so many little banks out in these texas where they don't even have
[03:02:45.680 --> 03:02:49.360]  customers but they don't have the town and some one you know one old guy is
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:53.200]  worth you know $150 million and nobody even knows it
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:57.440]  i mean that's how this works man and this is the controllers doing it

[03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:04.000]  strategize over every last detail of a candidate's image
[03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:08.080]  especially an identity candidate like hillary how important
[03:05:08.080 --> 03:05:11.360]  is it for there to be a woman president in the united states
[03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:15.200]  national journal has pointed out that candidates now view soundtracks as a
[03:05:15.200 --> 03:05:20.320]  key part of that carefully crafted image so maybe hillary should choose a
[03:05:20.320 --> 03:05:23.840]  campaign song that plays against type you know
[03:05:23.840 --> 03:05:29.600]  humble i'm sorry hillary has paid a consulting firm
[03:05:29.600 --> 03:05:34.160]  nine thousand dollars to create a soundtrack for her campaign i just don't
[03:05:34.160 --> 03:05:36.800]  think people would believe this song though
[03:05:36.800 --> 03:05:40.960]  she's being abandoned by unions by multinational corporate donors who are
[03:05:40.960 --> 03:05:44.560]  worried 44 percent of her twitter followers
[03:05:44.560 --> 03:05:50.720]  1.4 million are fake maybe her campaign theme should be

[03:08:21.440 --> 03:08:24.560]  i mean this is i'm not joking around about these people
[03:08:24.560 --> 03:08:28.480]  let's get serious though we're gonna go leon macadam for the rest of the hour
[03:08:28.480 --> 03:08:31.920]  alex jones here in the fourth hour frances
[03:08:31.920 --> 03:08:38.320]  haland muslim rift threatens total war so the west and france has been the
[03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:41.760]  biggest pusher of it i mean of any group they've given
[03:08:41.760 --> 03:08:45.600]  more money per capita everybody's involved
[03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:48.480]  more money than the western countries turkey's probably given more than anybody
[03:08:48.480 --> 03:08:51.840]  or more military saudi arabia's given more money
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:55.680]  he says if we let recent religious confrontations when shiites and sunnis
[03:08:55.680 --> 03:08:59.680]  get worse then don't think we won't be affected
[03:08:59.680 --> 03:09:02.880]  it will be total war see that way when there's this clash and then tens of
[03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:06.000]  millions of refugees he'll say see i told you and be a genius
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:10.560]  no see we told you four years ago what the arab spring was that it was going to
[03:09:10.560 --> 03:09:13.760]  be this it's not hard to know this
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:18.160]  it will be total war a war that will also affect
[03:09:18.160 --> 03:09:23.040]  our territories and we must act he warned haland also said that the political
[03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:25.280]  solution for syrian europe's illegal immigration crisis
[03:09:25.280 --> 03:09:28.880]  is the overthrow of syrian president bashes here Assad
[03:09:28.880 --> 03:09:35.120]  which again is the sunni saudi arabian run attack on the shiites
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:39.520]  so he's driving the war while saying we've got to stop it
[03:09:39.520 --> 03:09:43.360]  middle east experts agree the situation has the potential to develop a full
[03:09:43.360 --> 03:09:46.400]  scale war oh it already is the conditions are
[03:09:46.400 --> 03:09:50.400]  very much like 1914 michael stevens of the royal united service
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:54.640]  institute in london said in june prior to the russian response in syria
[03:09:54.640 --> 03:09:58.240]  all it will take is one little spark and i ran in syria we'll go at each other
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:01.600]  believing they are fighting a defensive war steven said the whole region is
[03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:04.800]  bracing for a big war the war that has not yet happened
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:08.960]  the shiite sunni war added
[03:10:08.960 --> 03:10:13.360]  the iraq kurdish commentator hawi osmong
[03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:17.040]  stevens remark about 1914 refers to the start of first world war started by
[03:10:17.040 --> 03:10:20.640]  british intelligence the fall of the sunni Ottoman empire and the caliphate
[03:10:20.640 --> 03:10:24.080]  and the sites picot agreement between
[03:10:24.080 --> 03:10:29.120]  england france and the divided up arab world and of course the precise treaty i
[03:10:29.120 --> 03:10:32.480]  would add so far as syria is concerned it is
[03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:35.200]  france and not turkey that is the enemy the british
[03:10:35.200 --> 03:10:41.520]  agent and scholar te laurence wrote in 1950
[03:10:41.520 --> 03:10:45.440]  because laurence of arabia and all of this was a replay with the
[03:10:45.440 --> 03:10:50.800]  newly formed mercenary bedouin groups that they gave machine
[03:10:50.800 --> 03:10:53.520]  guns and hand grenades to and rocket launchers
[03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:56.560]  and other goodies
[03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:00.480]  and then they just ran around slaughtering everybody there was a
[03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:04.080]  civilization there it was
[03:11:04.080 --> 03:11:08.960]  more pro-western it was not as violent people weren't really fighting with
[03:11:08.960 --> 03:11:11.280]  each other and british intelligence went into the
[03:11:11.280 --> 03:11:15.440]  middle of saudi arabia and found basically the duck dynasty people of
[03:11:15.440 --> 03:11:18.480]  the area uh and i'm not knocking duck
[03:11:18.480 --> 03:11:22.320]  dynasty but they found the hillbillies and the folks that have been robbing the
[03:11:22.320 --> 03:11:27.200]  the the caravans coming into mecca for a thousand years and just said
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:31.600]  hasan chop are you ready to take over
[03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:38.400]  yes master i will kill yeah and now the the the the the
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:42.880]  sons the youngest sons whether always dying every year or so or having

[03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:50.880]  of the guy that was having kids till he was like 75 years old
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:55.440]  launched the war in 1901 let's pull up the founder of the saudi empire
[03:11:55.440 --> 03:11:58.160]  and then i'm gonna play the sketchy clip get it right because this this is both
[03:11:58.160 --> 03:12:02.560]  the the saudi arabian leader this got censored on youtube last time we put
[03:12:02.560 --> 03:12:06.400]  this up when the last saudi king died with one
[03:12:06.400 --> 03:12:09.840]  before the last the older brother because i think they're down to like number
[03:12:09.840 --> 03:12:13.520]  fourth brother right now the the the the emergence of the saudi
[03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:17.040]  dynasty began in central arabia in 1744 in the year

[03:16:06.560 --> 03:16:10.080]  conspiracy theory we never had things called eyes we can never see
[03:16:10.080 --> 03:16:14.880]  no no i love government it made the sun shine it made the birds tweet
[03:16:14.880 --> 03:16:17.120]  all right let's go down to leon macadoo will be hosting the rest of the
[03:16:17.120 --> 03:16:21.920]  broadcast has a big fourth hour lined up for us leon macadoo what do you think
[03:16:21.920 --> 03:16:26.240]  of matt drudge appearing yesterday in the confines of the info wars command
[03:16:26.240 --> 03:16:30.560]  center that was shocking i was flabbergasted
[03:16:30.560 --> 03:16:34.240]  as you said i was as well it was pretty surreal
[03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:38.160]  to see him here i didn't really recognize him at first because of
[03:16:38.160 --> 03:16:40.800]  he hasn't had any photographs taken in the last
[03:16:40.800 --> 03:16:44.240]  eight years so he knew who i was i mean he was
[03:16:44.240 --> 03:16:48.480]  an incredibly classy man made everyone here feel really special and
[03:16:48.480 --> 03:16:52.480]  it was just it was pretty cool do you have a crush on matt drudge now
[03:16:52.480 --> 03:16:55.680]  you know he looks younger now than he did in his pictures i think it's because
[03:16:55.680 --> 03:16:59.360]  he's more relaxed well plus he told me i don't know
[03:16:59.360 --> 03:17:03.120]  that's a secret i think he said this the straw hat was something he did on
[03:17:03.120 --> 03:17:05.760]  purpose so that's all the media ever had
[03:17:05.760 --> 03:17:09.360]  so that once he disappeared this was all planned really classy guy
[03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:12.480]  he would then dress different and no one knows who he is
[03:17:12.480 --> 03:17:15.280]  i'm not gonna well i'm not gonna say how he was dressed but let's just say he
[03:17:15.280 --> 03:17:20.720]  fit in around texas yeah he didn't have a hipster beard though
[03:17:20.720 --> 03:17:24.720]  for austin he didn't have a beard no that's what i'm saying though if he wants
[03:17:24.720 --> 03:17:28.560]  to fit in here in austin oh he did have a giant handle bar
[03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:32.880]  mustache like richards though no drudge is a big black
[03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:37.280]  mustache now that he curls at the end yes like stromboli he's gonna grow it
[03:17:37.280 --> 03:17:40.400]  out even longer for november but i'm looking at the drudge report right
[03:17:40.400 --> 03:17:43.200]  now and uh he's got a whole sidebar here talking
[03:17:43.200 --> 03:17:47.760]  about the gun sale setting new records uh why would be killers target gun free
[03:17:47.760 --> 03:17:51.680]  zones five steps to a gun free america but it looks like he needs to update
[03:17:51.680 --> 03:17:55.200]  the site with our article on the hashtag
[03:17:55.200 --> 03:17:59.280]  disarm obama well last night he said uh i think the most important thing was
[03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:01.920]  disarm obama you gotta do a story on that which i'd actually
[03:18:01.920 --> 03:18:04.640]  said when i left but i get there's a lot of great stuff so i'm sure that when he
[03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:08.240]  he has been updating i don't know yes at some point i think he will promote that
[03:18:08.240 --> 03:18:12.000]  article because we need to get that going mega viral uh after all it is his
[03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:16.960]  initiative obama give up your guns uh hashtag disarm obama please the staff
[03:18:16.960 --> 03:18:20.880]  the crew everyone listening facebook twitter help get that article out to
[03:18:20.880 --> 03:18:23.920]  everybody but i'm not complaining i think he's linked to four of our articles
[03:18:23.920 --> 03:18:27.520]  yeah and he went to three of them yesterday so uh we're not complaining
[03:18:27.520 --> 03:18:32.080]  joe bigs will be reporting from the big tactical gun expo in florida tomorrow
[03:18:32.080 --> 03:18:36.480]  to get their response to gun sales uh and the latest on what's happening there
[03:18:36.480 --> 03:18:42.720]  leon macadoo uh what do you think of the west starting the arab civil war
[03:18:42.720 --> 03:18:46.240]  the muslim civil war uh between the shiites and the sunnis
[03:18:46.240 --> 03:18:51.360]  between the persians and the um bank robber uh caravan robbers that run
[03:18:51.360 --> 03:18:54.480]  saudi arabia what do you think about all that pretty serious
[03:18:54.480 --> 03:18:58.320]  situation well it's absolutely serious and you can just see the blatant
[03:18:58.320 --> 03:19:02.160]  hypocrisy there with this administration because obama is coming out saying we
[03:19:02.160 --> 03:19:05.520]  need to use diplomacy and we need gun control
[03:19:05.520 --> 03:19:09.680]  meanwhile he's making billions of dollars worth of arms contracts there in
[03:19:09.680 --> 03:19:13.120]  the middle east so he's saying the rebels they're right
[03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:16.960]  by being racist on the very exact same day he's pushing for gun control here
[03:19:16.960 --> 03:19:21.440]  in america he wants all of us to be disarmed but then he is heavily
[03:19:21.440 --> 03:19:25.520]  arming our leon what do you got coming up with no sharky the
[03:19:25.520 --> 03:19:28.400]  professor saw a story yesterday going viral
[03:19:28.400 --> 03:19:32.400]  weaponized robots are inevitable so submit to them yeah that's what the risk of
[03:19:32.400 --> 03:19:36.160]  robotic warfare is closer than ever because the un
[03:19:36.160 --> 03:19:40.320]  is delaying some uh some negotiations there that would stall it
[03:19:40.320 --> 03:19:42.880]  well they've already got autonomous weapons and the pentagon doesn't even
[03:19:42.880 --> 03:19:47.360]  like it but the science board means eugenics globalist
[03:19:47.360 --> 03:19:51.200]  uh it actually says we're going ahead with the merger with the machines leon
[03:19:51.200 --> 03:19:53.920]  why are you being phobic against machines next you're going to be phobic
[03:19:53.920 --> 03:19:57.360]  against pedophilia phobic is pouring drayno in your eyes what kind of sick

[03:23:11.600 --> 03:23:14.800]  and the remaining 75 percent is undesirable fish fat

[03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:20.960]  hour overdrive we are going to be wrapping up the show
[03:24:20.960 --> 03:24:25.040]  i got a jam packed rest of the fourth hour for you
[03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:29.600]  i wanted to talk about something that matt drudge came here yesterday and it
[03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:32.640]  was an epic experience for me and he was dropping
[03:24:32.640 --> 03:24:36.880]  pearls of wisdom one of the big things that really stuck with me
[03:24:36.880 --> 03:24:41.680]  uh he was talking about this terrifying power of tech giants
[03:24:41.680 --> 03:24:45.120]  and of course wouldn't you know there's an article out today
[03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:51.200]  steve jobs director danie boil warns of the terrifying power of tech giants
[03:24:51.200 --> 03:24:54.160]  and he says that it's actually this terrifying power
[03:24:54.160 --> 03:24:58.000]  that prompted him to go ahead and work on this on this movie
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:02.480]  after he finished reading the novel the circle
[03:25:02.480 --> 03:25:05.920]  it that's novel features a vast facebook apple
[03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:12.320]  twitter-like system encompassing and controlling the entire
[03:25:12.320 --> 03:25:15.760]  platform of any kind of digital communication that's out there and he
[03:25:15.760 --> 03:25:19.040]  said that these companies are so powerful the governments are running
[03:25:19.040 --> 03:25:21.840]  scared they have such influence around the world they've
[03:25:21.840 --> 03:25:25.040]  replaced petrochemical companies pharmaceutical companies
[03:25:25.040 --> 03:25:28.880]  they're bigger than all of them put together and now they have tremendous
[03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:32.480]  terrifying power we should keep an eye on them
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:35.840]  absolutely and we're always talking about how there are these
[03:25:35.840 --> 03:25:39.840]  six mega corporations that rule everything from the media to
[03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:44.880]  the news to the food to industry etc well now that's happening with the
[03:25:44.880 --> 03:25:48.560]  internet um they are controlling the world
[03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:52.160]  essentially and the internet mad drudge was saying
[03:25:52.160 --> 03:25:56.720]  you know it's the wild wild west it used to be sort of this renaissance
[03:25:56.720 --> 03:26:00.960]  area and now we are being corralled into these
[03:26:00.960 --> 03:26:04.400]  ghettos that they are controlling and i thought that was a really
[03:26:04.400 --> 03:26:08.400]  uh apropos term that he uses well because he's saying these corporate
[03:26:08.400 --> 03:26:12.720]  controlled social media they're killing the open range of ideas
[03:26:12.720 --> 03:26:16.400]  on the internet and he calls facebook and twitter
[03:26:16.400 --> 03:26:22.080]  internet ghettos designed to eradicate the open range of independent thought
[03:26:22.080 --> 03:26:25.920]  where are the vibrant entities that are out there that's why he loves alex
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:29.520]  jones so much and why he was able to create this
[03:26:29.520 --> 03:26:32.960]  huge following this huge platform because he didn't
[03:26:32.960 --> 03:26:36.720]  worry about the facebook and the google and the links and the yahoo and the
[03:26:36.720 --> 03:26:39.840]  bing he wasn't worried about that it was just this
[03:26:39.840 --> 03:26:44.560]  organic truthfulness that attracted everyone to it
[03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:48.320]  and that's the thing is that they don't want you to be able to
[03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:53.200]  have another sort of entity waking people up out there they want everyone to
[03:26:53.200 --> 03:26:57.280]  corral over to the youtube and to the instagrams and to the facebook
[03:26:57.280 --> 03:27:01.520]  because they don't want you to take that mythical heroes journey
[03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:06.640]  the heroes journey is is what is going to make everyone successful in
[03:27:06.640 --> 03:27:10.960]  their own way kid daniels points out in this article
[03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:14.960]  here about matt drudge that one of the most
[03:27:14.960 --> 03:27:18.880]  a study revealed that the most successful individuals operate in large
[03:27:18.880 --> 03:27:23.440]  open networks where they're the link between people of different backgrounds
[03:27:23.440 --> 03:27:27.600]  but facebook and the like they can find you to a small
[03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:32.560]  closed network in which you're only connected to your facebook friends
[03:27:32.560 --> 03:27:35.200]  you're going to be likely to share your same views
[03:27:35.200 --> 03:27:38.160]  and they already know everything you're going to be talking about
[03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:42.960]  so your potential to reach outside of facebook or to be
[03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:46.720]  introduced to any ideas that are different than your own
[03:27:46.720 --> 03:27:50.320]  are corralled you're going to be stopped from that
[03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:53.920]  and the establishment wants this because in a closed network
[03:27:53.920 --> 03:27:58.240]  you're also more likely to repeatedly hear the same government talking points
[03:27:58.240 --> 03:28:02.320]  and accept them without thought and of course that means you're going to be
[03:28:02.320 --> 03:28:07.040]  more easily controlled by the power elite and that of course is why they do
[03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:10.640]  not want you to take that heroes journey which is the
[03:28:10.640 --> 03:28:14.480]  number one indicator of success matt drudge says
[03:28:14.480 --> 03:28:19.200]  don't be fooled into thinking that you're uh an individual when you're on
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:23.120]  facebook you're not you're just a pawn in their scheme
[03:28:23.120 --> 03:28:26.480]  and that for me was one of the most profound things that he spoke about
[03:28:26.480 --> 03:28:29.440]  yesterday of course he mentioned a lot of other
[03:28:29.440 --> 03:28:33.280]  things like hashtag disarm obama which we want that to
[03:28:33.280 --> 03:28:37.600]  go viral be sure that you're sharing that video as well as that article
[03:28:37.600 --> 03:28:42.400]  um but what is this what is this heroes journey that i'm speaking about you
[03:28:42.400 --> 03:28:46.560]  see it it's this myth that's uh the fabric of our society and you see it
[03:28:46.560 --> 03:28:49.840]  in every movie every book the matrix is the perfect
[03:28:49.840 --> 03:28:53.600]  example of that um things are going great you feel
[03:28:53.600 --> 03:28:56.960]  normal you fit in then all of a sudden something happens to change your
[03:28:56.960 --> 03:29:00.560]  perception of the world you start to feel like an outsider on your own
[03:29:00.560 --> 03:29:04.960]  you're called to leave and fulfill a part of yourself a destiny
[03:29:04.960 --> 03:29:08.320]  but that's had a lot of uncertainty to it so you're scared
[03:29:08.320 --> 03:29:12.080]  finally you take the plunge you go through some difficult times
[03:29:12.080 --> 03:29:15.600]  but then you learn to navigate and you overcome these challenges
[03:29:15.600 --> 03:29:19.280]  and then you're able to go back to your old culture and you have a huge
[03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:23.440]  impact on the world around you taking all the lessons that you've learned
[03:29:23.440 --> 03:29:26.880]  and that's exactly what they do not want you to do they don't want you to take
[03:29:26.880 --> 03:29:30.240]  that heroes journey they want you to stay in their little
[03:29:30.240 --> 03:29:35.200]  ghetto so they can suck out your soul and your essence just like the skexies
[03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:40.240]  there that movie is still such the appropriate allegory for our time the
[03:29:40.240 --> 03:29:43.840]  dark crystal we'll be right back with noel
[03:29:43.840 --> 03:29:46.160]  sharky
[03:29:48.560 --> 03:29:52.400]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:52.400 --> 03:29:57.200]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:59.520 --> 03:30:03.120]  matt drudge challenges barack obama to give up
[03:30:03.120 --> 03:30:06.880]  his guns the news icon calls on the president and
[03:30:06.880 --> 03:30:11.520]  hillary clinton to relinquish their secret service protection i challenge
[03:30:11.520 --> 03:30:15.280]  hillary take away your secret service take it away now have no
[03:30:15.280 --> 03:30:18.240]  security around you have no guns around you hillary
[03:30:18.240 --> 03:30:23.280]  i dare you i dare you obama same thing drop your guns obama
[03:30:23.280 --> 03:30:26.720]  take your secret service away obama take it all away
[03:30:26.720 --> 03:30:30.240]  leave the white house unguarded obama let everybody know there's no guns on
[03:30:30.240 --> 03:30:33.520]  the white house grounds obama you know what would happen in 30 seconds
[03:30:33.520 --> 03:30:38.080]  most of those people would no longer be on planet earth so they're asking us
[03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:41.760]  to drop our guns and to drop our security measures
[03:30:41.760 --> 03:30:45.600]  or or what so this thing is very real
[03:30:45.600 --> 03:30:49.360]  and i don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick

[03:33:23.600 --> 03:33:29.040]  overdrive i am leanne macadoo your host now the united nations has been
[03:33:29.040 --> 03:33:32.320]  warned that delays and negotiations over the future of
[03:33:32.320 --> 03:33:36.080]  lethal autonomous weapons or killer robots
[03:33:36.080 --> 03:33:40.000]  they're moving too slowly to stop robot wars from becoming
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:44.160]  a reality now experts including physicists steven hawking
[03:33:44.160 --> 03:33:47.760]  apple co-founder steve wozniak a tesla ceo
[03:33:47.760 --> 03:33:52.160]  elin musk they've all warned that proliferation of autonomous weapons
[03:33:52.160 --> 03:33:55.760]  would make a global arms race inevitable.
[03:33:55.760 --> 03:34:00.160]  now my guest today is nolsharky he is the emeritus professor of
[03:34:00.160 --> 03:34:03.760]  artificial intelligence and robotics at the university of sheffield
[03:34:03.760 --> 03:34:07.680]  and after years of detailed research within artificial intelligence and
[03:34:07.680 --> 03:34:11.520]  robotics nol's core research interest is in the ethical
[03:34:11.520 --> 03:34:16.080]  application of robotics and ai in areas such as the military
[03:34:16.080 --> 03:34:20.160]  surveillance and criminal terrorist activity he's currently serving as
[03:34:20.160 --> 03:34:25.120]  chair of the ngo the international committee for robot arms control
[03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:29.280]  their group they've been campaigning against the use of military robots
[03:34:29.280 --> 03:34:32.800]  nol thank you so much for joining us so talk to me a little bit about this
[03:34:32.800 --> 03:34:36.640]  stall at the un what does that mean how is that setting us up for
[03:34:36.640 --> 03:34:40.720]  killer robot arms race well we've been we went to
[03:34:40.720 --> 03:34:45.200]  there's a committee at the un called the ccw and that's the committee that's
[03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:48.400]  really designed for prohibiting certain sorts of weapons
[03:34:48.400 --> 03:34:53.200]  that are unnecessary injuries like fragments on the battlefield landmines
[03:34:53.200 --> 03:34:56.880]  those things and we went to them we got mandates
[03:34:56.880 --> 03:34:59.920]  from them so they've they've run expert meetings
[03:34:59.920 --> 03:35:04.560]  and they've run expert meetings two years in a row now for five days each time
[03:35:04.560 --> 03:35:09.120]  but now we want them to move forward to the next stage of negotiation
[03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:12.480]  but what they're saying is that next year they're going to go for another
[03:35:12.480 --> 03:35:16.160]  expert meeting and this is becoming like an annual conference instead of
[03:35:16.160 --> 03:35:19.840]  moving towards getting groups of government experts together
[03:35:19.840 --> 03:35:25.200]  and discussing a possible treaty and so what what is what do you believe is
[03:35:25.200 --> 03:35:28.880]  causing that delay i know in one of the articles there i mean
[03:35:28.880 --> 03:35:32.800]  we have all of these ethicists warning of the potential dangers
[03:35:32.800 --> 03:35:36.080]  and yet they're stalling and we know that there are already some of these
[03:35:36.080 --> 03:35:40.960]  semi-autonomous weapons in use and the development of so much more
[03:35:40.960 --> 03:35:45.600]  yes they're developing pretty quickly the us have guidelines that prevent them
[03:35:45.600 --> 03:35:48.880]  being acquired for a period of five years
[03:35:48.880 --> 03:35:52.720]  and there's well there's another two years to run on that but in the meantime
[03:35:52.720 --> 03:35:55.920]  DARPA your defense advanced project research agency
[03:35:55.920 --> 03:36:01.040]  is developing like crazy really they keep on issuing new contracts for tender
[03:36:01.040 --> 03:36:05.280]  like they're looking at swarms of autonomous boats that can
[03:36:05.280 --> 03:36:08.800]  swarm another craft they're looking at swarms of
[03:36:08.800 --> 03:36:12.800]  planes they're looking at autonomous submarines that can go into the water and
[03:36:12.800 --> 03:36:16.560]  sink other submarines but they could sink ships as well of course
[03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:20.160]  so the technology is developing and developing
[03:36:20.160 --> 03:36:25.360]  and the point is the language that the US and UK have insisted on using at the
[03:36:25.360 --> 03:36:30.160]  UN is that these are meetings about emerging technologies
[03:36:30.160 --> 03:36:33.200]  now China have said they want it to be about existing
[03:36:33.200 --> 03:36:36.480]  and emerging technologies now the problem with the wording
[03:36:36.480 --> 03:36:39.760]  emerging technologies and it isn't emerging technology
[03:36:39.760 --> 03:36:43.040]  but if we keep on at this for another three or four years
[03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:46.400]  by that point they will no longer be emerging they'll be there
[03:36:46.400 --> 03:36:50.560]  and so the treaty won't have any teeth to ban them
[03:36:50.560 --> 03:36:56.560]  wow and then so the the US and the UK are insisting that using this wording
[03:36:56.560 --> 03:37:00.160]  I guess a lot of money is going into the development
[03:37:00.160 --> 03:37:03.760]  of these machines yes but of course they're not saying that that's why
[03:37:03.760 --> 03:37:07.440]  they're doing it but it just strikes anybody with any sense that that's what's
[03:37:07.440 --> 03:37:10.400]  happening but the machines are quite dangerous I mean they're
[03:37:10.400 --> 03:37:14.160]  they're really obviously when in the discussions I've learned an awful lot in
[03:37:14.160 --> 03:37:16.800]  the discussions and I've been I've been working in this
[03:37:16.800 --> 03:37:22.480]  campaigning since 2007 but I've learned an awful lot at the UN in recent times
[03:37:22.480 --> 03:37:25.600]  about the kind of military reasons for having them
[03:37:25.600 --> 03:37:30.720]  but it's so important that all nations discuss this
[03:37:30.720 --> 03:37:35.440]  because when the US talks about this they seem to have this idea that they
[03:37:35.440 --> 03:37:39.360]  will developing them and all other nations technology will
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:42.800]  stay exactly as it is today so when they're doing these kind of
[03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:47.120]  scenarios to test the weapons they're thinking that China and Russia and
[03:37:47.120 --> 03:37:50.320]  these countries will have exactly the same weapons that they have
[03:37:50.320 --> 03:37:54.400]  today whereas in actual fact what we're going to see is an arms race
[03:37:54.400 --> 03:37:58.320]  and mass proliferation and at the moment there's nothing against that there are
[03:37:58.320 --> 03:38:03.200]  no laws against these whatsoever so if we get mass proliferation
[03:38:03.200 --> 03:38:06.880]  and billions of dollars because there's billions of dollars at stake here big
[03:38:06.880 --> 03:38:10.080]  companies involved if billions of dollars get involved
[03:38:10.080 --> 03:38:13.840]  then you know how are we ever going to stop it
[03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:18.480]  exactly and just speaking earlier about the terrifying power of tech giants
[03:38:18.480 --> 03:38:22.080]  Google as a matter of fact they've jumped into
[03:38:22.080 --> 03:38:25.520]  airspace monitoring they want to make room for drones there so they want to
[03:38:25.520 --> 03:38:29.040]  control that airspace but they've also recently acquired
[03:38:29.040 --> 03:38:32.720]  Boston Dynamics so it's one of the most advanced robotics
[03:38:32.720 --> 03:38:36.320]  company in the world making robots for the military
[03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:40.480]  what does Google need with that five five robot companies major ones all the
[03:38:40.480 --> 03:38:43.600]  best ones in the world now Google said that they would only
[03:38:43.600 --> 03:38:47.520]  see out the existing contracts with the Boston Dynamics
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:51.120]  so they had a couple of years of contracts left for the military
[03:38:51.120 --> 03:38:54.000]  and they said they wouldn't do anything more with the military
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:59.040]  but what's happened just three weeks ago I found out that there's a brand new
[03:38:59.040 --> 03:39:03.440]  Google robot like the big dog that you all know called Spot
[03:39:03.440 --> 03:39:07.920]  and it's being tested by Marines so I don't know what Google are playing at
[03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:12.080]  here what sort of game they're playing at but it seems very strange to me
[03:39:12.080 --> 03:39:15.840]  yeah absolutely and to have the foresight there to go ahead and control
[03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:19.120]  the airspace that the drones are going to be flying in
[03:39:19.120 --> 03:39:23.040]  so obviously something's going on they're competing with Amazon
[03:39:23.040 --> 03:39:27.600]  Amazon in in Europe have are trying at the moment with the regulators
[03:39:27.600 --> 03:39:31.760]  to get a whole portion of airspace it's something like
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:35.440]  100 200 yards and a thousand feet in the air
[03:39:35.440 --> 03:39:39.200]  and they want to control the airspace so they can start doing a lot of Amazon
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:42.480]  deliveries and I think Google and they are competing with each
[03:39:42.480 --> 03:39:45.680]  other for this right I mean it seems that seems like
[03:39:45.680 --> 03:39:49.360]  a crazy idea as well really because if you think about the
[03:39:49.360 --> 03:39:52.800]  number of deliveries are we going to see the sun at all
[03:39:52.800 --> 03:39:56.400]  I mean the sky is just going to be littered with these things and it's so
[03:39:56.400 --> 03:39:59.920]  easy when you've got that kind of stream of stuff
[03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:02.960]  to slip some machines with bombs in them
[03:40:02.960 --> 03:40:06.240]  onto onto that stream and we could never detect it so
[03:40:06.240 --> 03:40:10.000]  it's very worrying I mean there's a whole worrying development outside of
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:12.560]  what we're talking about just now and there's a whole
[03:40:12.560 --> 03:40:15.600]  worrying development with the police use of these
[03:40:15.600 --> 03:40:19.360]  technologies and I don't know if you've heard there in Texas but
[03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:24.560]  North Dakota this month was last month sorry late last month
[03:40:24.560 --> 03:40:28.800]  passed a new bill saying that the police are now
[03:40:28.800 --> 03:40:32.640]  allowed to arm their drones with less than lethal weapons
[03:40:32.640 --> 03:40:36.800]  and that means that the North Dakota police now can arm their drones
[03:40:36.800 --> 03:40:42.240]  with tasers with rubber bullets and firing rifles at fire rubber bullets
[03:40:42.240 --> 03:40:47.440]  tear gas and a pepper spray and this is a very very worrying development to me
[03:40:47.440 --> 03:40:51.680]  because it gives the police too much power to control
[03:40:51.680 --> 03:40:56.080]  well absolutely in North Dakota I mean they don't even have that
[03:40:56.080 --> 03:40:59.120]  much of a population there so why do they need to
[03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:03.120]  authorize their police to have armed drones with less well they're one of
[03:41:03.120 --> 03:41:06.640]  the biggest drone users in the US in fact for some reason I don't know why
[03:41:06.640 --> 03:41:09.760]  maybe it's because they don't have such a big population so
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:13.360]  but anything that starts there it's like a domino effect isn't it
[03:41:13.360 --> 03:41:17.520]  they will test it out there and if it works out well it will spread
[03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:22.480]  and and you know already in South Africa these these tools are being used to
[03:41:22.480 --> 03:41:26.640]  suppress protests exactly you know you're going to see
[03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:31.360]  peaceful protest because the problem is that what you consider to be a peaceful
[03:41:31.360 --> 03:41:34.720]  protest can change over time laws can change
[03:41:34.720 --> 03:41:38.640]  and the more control you have you're not putting police officers in harm's way
[03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:42.240]  you can fly overhead fire pepper spray fire tasers
[03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:46.960]  so you start getting a large protest like occupy wall street that kind of thing
[03:41:46.960 --> 03:41:50.160]  and you know the police can move in and pick people off and certainly
[03:41:50.160 --> 03:41:53.600]  photograph them and steal their private data
[03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:57.600]  oh absolutely and we've just recently reported that the UN
[03:41:57.600 --> 03:42:00.560]  in the US there they're forming their global
[03:42:00.560 --> 03:42:05.680]  stasi network policing the globe basically and we see Saudi Arabia is
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:09.440]  beheading two young men who were 17 at the time
[03:42:09.440 --> 03:42:12.320]  that they were arrested for protesting against the government
[03:42:12.320 --> 03:42:16.640]  so of course the they're going to be going after extremists
[03:42:16.640 --> 03:42:20.160]  and those terrorists that they are actually
[03:42:20.160 --> 03:42:23.840]  looking for are people who are going to be against
[03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:28.240]  the totalitarianism of the state it's not going to be actually
[03:42:28.240 --> 03:42:31.440]  people who are attaching bombs to these drones
[03:42:31.440 --> 03:42:36.000]  such as they are these exactly well the problem with the word terrorism
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:40.000]  sometimes it's we call them freedom fighters it depends on what side you're
[03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:43.200]  on really i mean the united states used to
[03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:46.240]  used to bomb the red coats from civilians and nobody called
[03:42:46.240 --> 03:42:49.280]  they certainly didn't call them terrorists in the united states when they did
[03:42:49.280 --> 03:42:52.960]  that sometimes it's the only way to it's the only
[03:42:52.960 --> 03:42:58.000]  way for populations to stop an authoritarian government is to rise
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:01.200]  against it and the more technological weapons you have
[03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:05.440]  the harder that is the really is absolutely
[03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:09.040]  and then so talking about the ethics with these
[03:43:09.040 --> 03:43:13.360]  military robots can they get away with war crimes
[03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:16.640]  if a robot unlawfully kills someone in the heat of battle
[03:43:16.640 --> 03:43:20.240]  who's to blame that's a very big problem and
[03:43:20.240 --> 03:43:23.440]  and it's very difficult to give satisfactory answer
[03:43:23.440 --> 03:43:28.400]  i mean the answer that that concerns a lot of military people in fact
[03:43:28.400 --> 03:43:31.840]  i've spoken to quite a few military commanders and they're concerned
[03:43:31.840 --> 03:43:35.600]  because they say the buck always stops with them but they're not happy about
[03:43:35.600 --> 03:43:38.000]  it because they don't understand how they work
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:41.440]  and the other thing about them is of course it would be easy to commit a war
[03:43:41.440 --> 03:43:44.720]  crime with this kind of robot weapon and then just blow it up
[03:43:44.720 --> 03:43:48.640]  afterwards so there's no trace i mean you know there's you can't hold a robot
[03:43:48.640 --> 03:43:51.760]  accountable for a war crime and it could easily be
[03:43:51.760 --> 03:43:55.360]  the software manufacturer people can hack into them
[03:43:55.360 --> 03:43:59.200]  i mean the Honda cars have been hacked into and the brakes applied in the
[03:43:59.200 --> 03:44:03.520]  steering wheel turn so they skid so it's you can hack into anything
[03:44:03.520 --> 03:44:07.040]  i mean i've actually met somebody who flies drones
[03:44:07.040 --> 03:44:11.760]  that hack into other drones and steal them wow
[03:44:11.760 --> 03:44:14.880]  it's you know we're moving into a technological future and i think we're
[03:44:14.880 --> 03:44:18.560]  not thinking about it enough i mean i don't think you can really stop
[03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:22.000]  you can't really hold back the tide of technology
[03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:26.400]  or stifle innovation and and stop jobs but certainly you really need to be
[03:44:26.400 --> 03:44:30.240]  thinking about it a lot more there's not really any joined up thinking
[03:44:30.240 --> 03:44:34.960]  and the us for a start should have really a strong committee that are looking
[03:44:34.960 --> 03:44:39.040]  at these things constantly and thinking about the near future and we're not
[03:44:39.040 --> 03:44:42.720]  talking about 50 years away we're talking about now
[03:44:42.720 --> 03:44:46.720]  this minute in time like it could happen next year when North Dakota are
[03:44:46.720 --> 03:44:49.520]  getting these weapons what will they have next year
[03:44:49.520 --> 03:44:55.120]  and you have a company in texas in fact called chaotic moon it's a robot company
[03:44:55.120 --> 03:44:59.200]  and they have made this little and and people say nowhere else but texas would
[03:44:59.200 --> 03:45:02.560]  you see this they've made this little autonomous drone
[03:45:02.560 --> 03:45:06.240]  right so it's a drone that flies completely on its own without any humans
[03:45:06.240 --> 03:45:10.160]  and what it does is hovers over your backyard and
[03:45:10.160 --> 03:45:15.200]  it's it's called cupid the drone and it's called cupid because it hovers over
[03:45:15.200 --> 03:45:18.160]  your background backyard and if somebody enters your
[03:45:18.160 --> 03:45:21.920]  property it will say leave immediately and if they don't leave
[03:45:21.920 --> 03:45:25.040]  it tasers them so it fires a taser dart at them
[03:45:25.040 --> 03:45:30.240]  50 000 volts and keeps them there until you arrive back or the authorities arrive
[03:45:30.240 --> 03:45:34.640]  back wow that's that's quite something and
[03:45:34.640 --> 03:45:38.480]  I can imagine police using those for area denial so they'll say
[03:45:38.480 --> 03:45:42.880]  you know putting up barbed wire whatever you say this area is denied
[03:45:42.880 --> 03:45:46.480]  and if you enter into it you're going to get tasered right and of course they
[03:45:46.480 --> 03:45:51.200]  won't use those at the border but I actually I remember when they
[03:45:51.200 --> 03:45:53.680]  were displaying that during South by Southwest
[03:45:53.680 --> 03:45:58.080]  a year or so ago they said that they had a lot of interest from law enforcement
[03:45:58.080 --> 03:46:00.880]  and they were like this is just a prototype we just did this to show
[03:46:00.880 --> 03:46:03.440]  people how you know dangerous it is that we're just
[03:46:03.440 --> 03:46:06.560]  advancing with his technology and there aren't any rules
[03:46:06.560 --> 03:46:11.280]  saying no you can't attach a taser to a drone
[03:46:11.280 --> 03:46:15.840]  well now let's talk a little bit about you know we're moving forward with this
[03:46:15.840 --> 03:46:21.520]  can we stop a negative outcome yes I mean we can have new laws
[03:46:21.520 --> 03:46:26.080]  one thing the the pressure we're putting on the UN with this CCW
[03:46:26.080 --> 03:46:29.840]  committee it's strange but if we succeed in getting a
[03:46:29.840 --> 03:46:34.960]  prohibitive ban an international treaty it will only apply to
[03:46:34.960 --> 03:46:40.080]  international armed conflict it will not apply to domestic use
[03:46:40.080 --> 03:46:44.320]  so for instance tear gas is not allowed at all it's totally prohibited
[03:46:44.320 --> 03:46:49.040]  in war so you can't use it in conflicts but the police can use it
[03:46:49.040 --> 03:46:53.680]  and so getting this prohibition will not stop your police or anybody's police
[03:46:53.680 --> 03:46:57.440]  from using it but what you can do is there's another committee that we're
[03:46:57.440 --> 03:47:01.200]  pushing for we're really working hard to get them to pay attention
[03:47:01.200 --> 03:47:05.440]  and that's called the human rights council now the human rights council
[03:47:05.440 --> 03:47:10.400]  they they set up our human rights basic human rights for the entire planet
[03:47:10.400 --> 03:47:14.160]  and if we can get them to say you must not arm
[03:47:14.160 --> 03:47:17.920]  these these drones and these autonomous weapons
[03:47:17.920 --> 03:47:21.680]  onto police mustn't use them then they won't be used
[03:47:21.680 --> 03:47:25.280]  I mean they might be used but they'll be in violation of the human rights council
[03:47:25.280 --> 03:47:29.360]  and nobody wants that really now are you talking about the same human rights
[03:47:29.360 --> 03:47:32.560]  council that has just chosen Saudi Arabia to be
[03:47:32.560 --> 03:47:37.040]  one of the leaders yeah I'm afraid so but the thing about the human rights
[03:47:37.040 --> 03:47:41.120]  council is I mean you get you don't always get the best choices
[03:47:41.120 --> 03:47:45.440]  but the good thing about it is it's not dominated by western countries
[03:47:45.440 --> 03:47:49.760]  it's rotates so the members rotate all the time
[03:47:49.760 --> 03:47:53.680]  and that's a good thing so you know sometimes you can draw a bad hand
[03:47:53.680 --> 03:47:57.840]  sometimes you can draw a good hand but if you look at the security council
[03:47:57.840 --> 03:48:01.280]  then you've got Russia China United States
[03:48:01.280 --> 03:48:07.040]  the UK and France dominating it all five of those countries have a right to veto
[03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:11.040]  so no matter what votes are taken even if the vast majority say
[03:48:11.040 --> 03:48:15.360]  yes we mustn't do this or we mustn't go and fight this war
[03:48:15.360 --> 03:48:19.920]  those countries can veto it but with the human rights council
[03:48:19.920 --> 03:48:24.480]  they can't veto anything so it's a fairer group of people
[03:48:24.480 --> 03:48:28.000]  they might not always be the male you can't always guarantee
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:32.320]  the thing about if you have a United Nations you have to go with the fact
[03:48:32.320 --> 03:48:36.480]  that you have to include all nations and you have to put up with it
[03:48:36.480 --> 03:48:41.360]  and the only reason why you get why it works is because there's so many people
[03:48:41.360 --> 03:48:45.440]  you've got such a diversity of opinion that you know you hope that the good
[03:48:45.440 --> 03:48:48.480]  washes out of it but I have to say my experience of the
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:52.480]  United Nations over the last three years is that the United States is really
[03:48:52.480 --> 03:48:56.080]  the dominant force there they're the world's super power
[03:48:56.080 --> 03:49:00.320]  it's quite clear when you go there right and I guess that's why it's
[03:49:00.320 --> 03:49:03.200]  obvious why this is such such an important thing
[03:49:03.200 --> 03:49:07.120]  Rand Paul famously filibuster just several years ago pointing out the fact
[03:49:07.120 --> 03:49:10.800]  that we don't have any laws on the books dealing with
[03:49:10.800 --> 03:49:14.320]  how the US can target Americans on US soil
[03:49:14.320 --> 03:49:18.560]  with these drones and that's right there's nothing set up
[03:49:18.560 --> 03:49:24.080]  so I mean it's well I mean I think there would be a lot of complaint if you did
[03:49:24.080 --> 03:49:27.840]  but there was a very close case if you remember there was that I can remember
[03:49:27.840 --> 03:49:30.640]  his name it was about a year ago two years ago
[03:49:30.640 --> 03:49:33.920]  that guy who was had been a law enforcement officer and he was a
[03:49:33.920 --> 03:49:38.160]  homicidal maniac and he'd escaped and he'd gone to the shack and they sent out
[03:49:38.160 --> 03:49:40.800]  a drone and they would have killed him with the drone
[03:49:40.800 --> 03:49:44.640]  but instead they set fire to the shack and killed him that way
[03:49:44.640 --> 03:49:48.800]  right yeah that was a huge conspiracy here and a lot of things going on with
[03:49:48.800 --> 03:49:52.560]  that well no Sharkey thank you so much AI
[03:49:52.560 --> 03:49:56.880]  expert and I think this is going to be a huge issue in the days coming forward I
[03:49:56.880 --> 03:49:59.280]  know Matt Drudge that was one of the topics he kept
[03:49:59.280 --> 03:50:02.800]  pointing out over and over again while he was here is to just keep our eyes on
[03:50:02.800 --> 03:50:06.240]  this technology how it's going to be augmenting our
[03:50:06.240 --> 03:50:13.520]  our reality as well as our culture and obviously autonomous weapons is a huge
[03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:16.480]  deal who's going to be in control of these things
[03:50:16.480 --> 03:50:19.760]  well thank you so much for your time thank you Leanne a pleasure to be on the
[03:50:19.760 --> 03:50:24.480]  program thank you bye well there you have it
[03:50:24.480 --> 03:50:27.840]  as you mentioned we've got the UN human rights council
[03:50:27.840 --> 03:50:32.320]  in control of how these autonomous weapons are going to be
[03:50:32.320 --> 03:50:36.640]  deployed that is the same human rights council that now has
[03:50:36.640 --> 03:50:42.560]  Saudi Arabia who crucifies anyone who dare protest the way that their
[03:50:42.560 --> 03:50:46.000]  country is being run crucifixion meaning being beheaded
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:49.600]  and then displayed there in the public square and
[03:50:49.600 --> 03:50:54.240]  these are the type of extremists at the UN global police force is going to be
[03:50:54.240 --> 03:51:05.200]  looking out for too coming right up we'll be right back
[03:51:05.200 --> 03:51:09.760]  hey neighbor what are you doing digging you had a heart attack last year
[03:51:09.760 --> 03:51:14.000]  oh i know i was told no more hard labor then why are you digging
[03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:17.600]  well i've been taking extendivite it's been approved to help my heart
[03:51:17.600 --> 03:51:21.680]  extendivite is that a new drug no not a drug
[03:51:21.680 --> 03:51:25.600]  it's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne
[03:51:25.600 --> 03:51:30.080]  herbal how can that help well actually we've taken herbs for thousands of years
[03:51:30.080 --> 03:51:34.880]  and extendivite is doing the job for me does your doctor know about extendivite
[03:51:34.880 --> 03:51:38.160]  yeah my doctor knows and he said it seems to be working for you so don't stop
[03:51:38.160 --> 03:51:41.680]  taking it i feel great taking extendivite i don't want to stop

[03:53:59.840 --> 03:54:14.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show you are
[03:54:14.640 --> 03:54:18.640]  listening to the fourth hour overdrive we just had a great interview there with
[03:54:18.640 --> 03:54:23.840]  AI expert Noel Sharkey warning about the risk of robotic warfare it's edging
[03:54:23.840 --> 03:54:27.360]  ever closer we definitely need to keep our eye on that as well as keeping our
[03:54:27.360 --> 03:54:31.520]  eye on all these terrifying tech giants who are now dabbling
[03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:35.520]  in these autonomous weapons joining me now jacari
[03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:38.800]  Jackson jacari how are you what do we got coming up
[03:54:38.800 --> 03:54:42.960]  well tonight on the nightly news we have a pretty jam-packed show of course we're
[03:54:42.960 --> 03:54:45.600]  going to be referencing some of the things that happened yesterday on the
[03:54:45.600 --> 03:54:47.840]  Alex Jones show when Matt Drudge popped in
[03:54:47.840 --> 03:54:51.520]  also we'll be talking about the shooting at UCC Oregon and particularly how the
[03:54:51.520 --> 03:54:54.880]  town is reacting to this even one guy who's still in the hospital
[03:54:54.880 --> 03:54:57.440]  right now this is my understanding saying hey obama
[03:54:57.440 --> 03:55:00.160]  don't come here in grandstand and try to push your agenda
[03:55:00.160 --> 03:55:04.480]  and let us bury our bodies let us heal in the hospitals heal our communities we
[03:55:04.480 --> 03:55:07.360]  don't need to come in here with your normal type of rhetoric
[03:55:07.360 --> 03:55:10.800]  also jesse ventura came out and said he hopes that both political parties the
[03:55:10.800 --> 03:55:13.760]  republicans and democrats destroy themselves of course there are more
[03:55:13.760 --> 03:55:17.120]  than two political parties but as far as the u.s is concerned those are the
[03:55:17.120 --> 03:55:20.880]  ones that people identify with the most and of course the old friend of the
[03:55:20.880 --> 03:55:25.200]  Alex Jones show Mike Hansen he was arrested for speaking 12 seconds
[03:55:25.200 --> 03:55:28.720]  well over his allotted time at a city council meeting
[03:55:28.720 --> 03:55:31.760]  and this is a one-off incident we see this all around the country
[03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:35.440]  a veteran i believe it was out in california was concealed carrying
[03:55:35.440 --> 03:55:39.200]  in a meeting they kicked him out because and they said we don't want this guy to
[03:55:39.200 --> 03:55:42.080]  be up here with a gun or at least one the councilman did and everybody else
[03:55:42.080 --> 03:55:44.800]  well he served his country he knows how to use a firearm why can't he be in
[03:55:44.800 --> 03:55:49.040]  here so these things happen all the time but right this is just another example
[03:55:49.040 --> 03:55:51.840]  of that well these are the type of extremists that the
[03:55:51.840 --> 03:55:55.520]  un's global stasi network is going to be coming after it's not
[03:55:55.520 --> 03:55:59.600]  actual terrorists it's people who are terrorists to the state
[03:55:59.600 --> 03:56:03.120]  so i'm feeling pretty good today i took my brain force
[03:56:03.120 --> 03:56:07.840]  i'm feeling good feeling well this this is something for everybody else out

[03:57:17.200 --> 03:57:19.520]  and then i just realized he was here because alex
[03:57:19.520 --> 03:57:23.040]  announced it on the show i was like really and then he came in the back and
[03:57:23.040 --> 03:57:26.000]  he spoke with us you know he's really down to earth guy just you know seem
[03:57:26.000 --> 03:57:30.240]  like a normal guy he's very informed you know but i just i'm just a normal guy

[03:57:48.960 --> 03:57:52.560]  you know after his interview and i was like man he did a great job
[03:57:52.560 --> 03:57:55.760]  you know like i guess he doesn't do a lot of speaking engagements but you know
[03:57:55.760 --> 03:57:58.560]  he just came out and he spoke from the heart and that really resonated with
