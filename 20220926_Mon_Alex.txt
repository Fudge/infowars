[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  Info Wars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  We're the survivors.
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.000]  We're the survivors. The black sheep. The black survivors.
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  Tell you what. We're the survivors. Yeah. The black survivors.
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  Yeah. We're the survivors. Like Shedrock, Misha, Kendra, Benzo.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  Born in the fire, but to never get burned. So I, I dream. I say, string.
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  I'm preaching and talking instant. We've got deliver.
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  Go now, go now. Call the father. Time has come.
[01:25.000 --> 01:32.000]  Some people put the best out of time. Some people keep the best inside.
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  Some people can't stand up strong. Some people won't wait for long.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  We are the black sheep survivors.
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday, September 26 World Wide Broadcast.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones. We're going to have open phones today.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  We're going to cover the incredible historic moment we are in as evil is rising.
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  Like a Saturn rocket in the sky and Liberty is blasting off like the space shuttle
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.000]  into the sky at the very same time. We are here live in the face of the enemy.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  And there are global awakenings accelerating. I've been telling you about the last few months.
[02:23.000 --> 02:31.000]  We just saw Georgia Maloney, a patriot, an anti-globalist, anti-New World Order,
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  anti-Claus Schwab, patriot, being called a Nazi, a fascist in all these lies,
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  winning in a landslide in Italy. And they are crapping their bridges,
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  the first Italian female president ever. And she's awesome. She's totally for real.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  They are scared as hell of her. And it's not just Bolsonaro. It's not just her.
[02:52.000 --> 02:58.000]  More and more and more and more are coming. We have successfully triggered the chain reaction.
[02:58.000 --> 03:06.000]  Ha ha ha ha ha! Woo! Ha ha ha ha ha!
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  Now, get ready for the enemy counter-offensive. They're going to say,
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  terrorists cut the power off in Italy. They are going to launch massive wars,
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  as they've already done. They are going to pull out all of the stops,
[03:21.000 --> 03:30.000]  but every passing minute, every passing hour, every passing day,
[03:30.000 --> 03:38.000]  the people now know about the New World Order and its horrible plans for all of us.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  And when the general population wakes up, and that's the next domino,
[03:42.000 --> 03:50.000]  we're already approaching 30, 40 percent. Woo! I'm getting chills.
[03:50.000 --> 04:00.000]  We are already approaching the next domino to fall.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  And here's the great point of danger. The New World Order knows they are on the cusp of defeat,
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  and so brace yourselves, because the New World Order in coming, it's here.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  All over Europe, they're pulling down EU flags. All over Latin America,
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  they're seeing down the Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates. All over Asia, they're saying the same thing.
[04:17.000 --> 04:25.000]  In India, in America, in the UK, everywhere, the people are unifying
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  against the unelected head that you see on screen of the European Union
[04:29.000 --> 04:36.000]  that two days ago threatened the Italians with massive sanctions
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  if they voted for this woman when she's an unelected pig.
[04:42.000 --> 04:51.000]  We're the survivors. It's on, folks.
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  The battle is now, and it's only going to get more intense.
[04:56.000 --> 05:22.000]  Now, in the tyranny, it'll get you killed fighting back your life.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  Bitcoin, yes, yes, Ethereum, right, yes.
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  As well as XRP, Monero, Litecoin, USDcoin, Dogecoin, and Stellar.

[06:33.000 --> 06:40.000]  All we got to do is survive and warn people that if the global is poisoning them with the GMO,
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  with the 5G, with the chemtrails, with the poison shots,
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.000]  and as it becomes completely evident that the new order are psychotics that would make Hitler blush,
[06:48.000 --> 06:57.000]  they will be destroyed. They can only get away with these operations, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  If we don't know, they're the ones behind it.
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  If we expose are the ones behind it, game over.
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.000]  Suck us. And that is happening.
[07:08.000 --> 07:14.000]  An unbelievably important broadcast lined up for you today.
[07:14.000 --> 07:22.000]  We have Italy rebelling against the EU dictatorship and openly being threatened with sanctions and border closures and total attacks
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  if they were to elect the first female populist leader in history,
[07:28.000 --> 07:36.000]  Georgia Maloney.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  Huge developments on that front.
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  Massive escalations in the Russia-NATO war
[07:42.000 --> 07:50.000]  and mass shootings, you name it, inside Russia as the globalists turn on their destabilization operations.
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  Incredible statements by leaders in Spain and the US promoting pedophilia.
[07:57.000 --> 08:02.000]  Spain's Minister of Equality says children should be able to have sexual adults.
[08:02.000 --> 08:08.000]  We have the video. I mean, these people are out in the open.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  We have why they're carrying out their depopulation operations. Are we getting into that?
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  Billionaire bunkers, how the world's wealthiest are paying to escape reality that they helped create.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  Massive COVID-19 news where more scientists, more top researchers,
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  members of the FDA board, the fourth board they put in have come out and said,
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  don't take the shots, they're hurting people.
[08:29.000 --> 08:37.000]  I mean, a lot of positive stuff's happening, but you better know the New World Order is going to strike back in in a big way.
[08:37.000 --> 08:45.000]  There is so much to get to, and we're going to be covering it all here today and your phone calls,
[08:45.000 --> 08:52.000]  but let me just get to unelected official, the head of the EU, unelected.
[08:52.000 --> 09:01.000]  It was started as a steel combine in 1956, and they later bragged in Bilderberger documents that was going to be the European Union,
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  and it's unelected.
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  And then with treaties with trader presidents and prime ministers,
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  they had sovereignty transferred to the European Union, unelected bureaucracy.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  Then they created a European Union parliament that has voting power,
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  but is only advisory or ceremonial or vestigial.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  Toothless, powerless, other than a bully pulpit.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  But it was enough that they got now the majority of people in that parliament or anti-EU because the people want it.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  So the bully pulpit is actually powerful, though it was designed to be toothless.
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  Unelected official head of the EU, Ursula von der Leyen of the European Union,
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  openly warns that if Italy votes for someone they disagree with, they will sanction Italy.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  The Italians gave her the bird. Here it is.
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  We'll see if things go in a difficult direction. I've spoken about Hungary and Poland.
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  We have tools if things go in the right direction.
[10:01.000 --> 10:13.000]  And people as a body that is always, where always governments have to be accountable to play an important role.
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  So they're going to sanction them and she went on to elaborate on that while speaking at Princeton.
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.000]  Here's some of the breathless establishment media clip 5 on the eve of her victory.
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  The anti-new world order, anti-globalist, pro-populous, pro-capitalist, new female leader of Italy.
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  Here they are demonizing her, calling her a fascist. Here it is.
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  Voters in Italy tomorrow appear poised to make a hard right turn.
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  The woman expected to become prime minister leads a party with roots in neo-fascism.
[10:42.000 --> 10:50.000]  Chris Livese is in Rome. Italy is revered for its history, reflected in palazzos and ruins and statues.
[10:50.000 --> 10:58.000]  But not all of that history is beautiful and many fear that one particularly ugly chapter could soon repeat itself.
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  This year marks the 100th anniversary of Mussolini's historic march on Rome,
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  plunging the country into two decades of dictatorship, an alliance with Hitler and a Second World War.
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  Today, his fascist party is gone, but many say she is carrying the torch.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  Giorgio Maloney, leader of the Brothers of Italy.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  What was once a fringe party has ballooned into the biggest in the country
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  and it's now poised to lead the most hard right government since World War II.
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.000]  The fundamental problem in Italy is becoming the illegal immigration.
[11:38.000 --> 11:46.000]  Too many immigrants to protect the traditional family, a family composed by a mom, a dad and sons.
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  Italy's conservative superstar remains fiercely opposed to adoptions and surrogacy for same-sex couples.
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  The fiery 45-year-old is comfortable with some of the hallmarks of Italian fascism, like this motto.
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  God, Fatherland and Family.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  And that's clearly a post-fascist party, with a post-fascist agenda.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  Get Anna Caratelli as a political scientist at Rome's American University.
[12:15.000 --> 12:24.000]  It has the flame in the symbol of the political party that goes back to the idea of the flame on the grave of Mussolini.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  The same flame is on Mussolini's grave?
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  Yes.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  Now it's a historic election also because Giorgio Malone would be Italy's first-ever female prime minister.
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  An important glass ceiling, but one that's been overshadowed by her politics.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  Chris Lipset, CBS News, Rome.
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  Oh my gosh, there's an eternal flame at JFK's tomb.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  There's an eternal flame of the Statue of Liberty.
[12:49.000 --> 12:58.000]  We get all those symbols from Rome, meaning the flame of enlightenment, the flame of the city on the hill.
[12:58.000 --> 13:06.000]  It's a Roman symbol, just like most of the symbols we have are buildings are Roman and Greek.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  The Romans got it from the Greeks.
[13:08.000 --> 13:16.000]  So the idea that because she has the symbol of a torch, and oh, there's a flame at Mussolini's grave.
[13:16.000 --> 13:17.000]  Oh my gosh.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  Well, there's a flame anywhere.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  It's evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  Absolutely preposterous, but that's what they do.
[13:27.000 --> 13:34.000]  The left now says Christians in Europe and the U.S. that raise their hands to reach out to God because God's a free will God.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  And if you're praying to God, whether you're alone or in public, try reaching your hands out.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  As I've said to God saying, I'm here.
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  God will reach back, too.
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  You'll feel it.
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  It's real.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  It opens the connection of will.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  That, they now say, is a double Nazi salute.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  Burn in hell, globalist.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  You're so full of crap.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  You're absolutely disgusting.
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  By the way, Mussolini was the leader of the Socialist Party.
[13:57.000 --> 14:06.000]  And then he double crossed him and became the fascist, but they were the National Socialist and Hitler modeled himself off the National Socialist Workers' Party.
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000]  You may have heard of it.
[14:07.000 --> 14:15.000]  That's the acronym for Nazi National Socialist Workers' Party.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  And in the German, it translates to Nazi.
[14:18.000 --> 14:27.000]  So they think you're stupid, they think you're dumb, and they call Donald Trump a Nazi, too, when he's got Jared Kushner, who's an Orthodox Jew.
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  And I'm not against Israel, but Trump was a little too footsie with Israel for me.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  I don't want to be footsie with the U.K. or Russia or China or anybody.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  I want America to be America.
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.000]  But the idea that Donald Trump is a Nazi is like saying Martin Luther King is a grand dragon in the KKK.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  It's ridiculous horse crap.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  Just like they say I'm a Nazi.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  They're the people using race to control people.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  You know that.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  They're the ones using race-based politics.
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.000]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[15:03.000 --> 15:12.000]  Everything they accuse us of is what they themselves are doing, and they know it, and they love it, and they think we're stupid, but we're not.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  More on this when we come back to the big Russian news, the economy news, the latest Pito news.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  It's just globalist running the bunkers, as I told you.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  It's mainstream news.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  But if we're awake and we're engaged and we're praying and we're doing it all, we can make it out of this.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  But believe me, if we don't, it only gets worse.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  It's not fun to hide in cowardly tyranny.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  It's exhilarating to face it.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  And you are. Tune into this broadcast and tip of the spear.
[15:42.000 --> 15:48.000]  And when you share the live links to infowars.com, four slash show, and Band-Aid video, and to share those articles and videos, you change the world.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  And I salute you.
[15:49.000 --> 15:56.000]  So this break, share the live link, infowars.com, four slash show, and the live show headline now, like your life depends on it because it does.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  We're all in this together.
[16:00.000 --> 16:08.000]  The best-selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and the War for the Worlds, written by Alex Jones.
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week.
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  But the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million people killed.
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  So they lied about his book.
[16:27.000 --> 16:35.000]  The Great Reset and the War for the World, the historic book that lays out the plans of the Great Reset Death Star,
[16:35.000 --> 16:40.000]  loses the New World Order's plans for global enslavement.
[16:40.000 --> 16:50.000]  Get your copy now at amazon.com to keep the book at number one and infowarsstore.com to help keep infowars on the air.
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.000]  Now, number one in the world.
[16:59.000 --> 17:05.000]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system,
[17:05.000 --> 17:08.000]  for your brain, for every part of your body.
[17:08.000 --> 17:16.000]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  It certainly does for me.
[17:18.000 --> 17:24.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[17:24.000 --> 17:30.000]  Now, there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain.

[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  The chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  are only lowering us.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  They're only making us more depressed.
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  In the end, they're only making us less filled.
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  It is only by going within and really making the connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[19:42.000 --> 19:48.000]  That's why the globals bombard us with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[19:48.000 --> 19:55.000]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the 3rd dimension.
[19:55.000 --> 19:58.000]  And that's where the incredible products come in at mforestore.com.
[20:01.000 --> 20:08.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:08.000 --> 20:17.000]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[20:17.000 --> 20:18.000]  You think? Just let me think.
[20:18.000 --> 20:23.000]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[20:23.000 --> 20:24.000]  It's chances that...
[20:24.000 --> 20:25.000]  Damn it!
[20:25.000 --> 20:26.000]  Why?
[20:26.000 --> 20:33.000]  Because while the truncheon may be used at lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[20:33.000 --> 20:38.000]  Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  The truth is here.
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You taught me every television in longer!
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  Cruelty and injustice intolerance and aggression.
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  And where once you have the freedom to object to something and speak as you saw fit,
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  you now have senses and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and...
[21:00.000 --> 21:01.000]  Yeah, right.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000] ...submachine cameras.
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  How did this happen?
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  Most blame.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  They will be held accountable.
[21:10.000 --> 21:17.000]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  I know why you did it.
[21:19.000 --> 21:20.000]  I know you were afraid.
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  Who would it be?
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  War, terror, disease?
[21:24.000 --> 21:31.000]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  Fear got the best of you.
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  And in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sattler.
[21:37.000 --> 21:40.000]  He promised you order. He promised you peace.
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  The time to choose sides has come.
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.000]  We are the resistance. We are the InfoWars.
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency?
[22:13.000 --> 22:21.000]  Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  Yes.
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  Is that what we'll advertise at just there?
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  Well, we're fighting the deep state. We need money.
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.000]  Alright.
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  This is it. Give crypto fun info wars.
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.000]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  Your advertisement for your cryptocurrency page.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  You know, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  So, I mean, I hope whoever the big whales are, they'll give us money before we keep going.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  We'll just keep minting money as you're in this courtroom.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  Alright, let's move on.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  People care about the First Amendment.
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  Globalist in full panic mode as nations choose populism over controlled collapse.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  Tune in now and learn how humanity takes back our planet.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  InfoWars.com, Timothy Spear.
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  Alright, I want to get to some of the speeches of this amazing lady that just got elected in Italy
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  that scared the New World Order so much, the threatening EU sanctions,
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  the unelected bureaucracy against their country because they voted wrong,
[23:31.000 --> 23:37.000]  forcing them out in the open, making them act like the authoritarian dictators,
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  the totalitarians that they are.
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.000]  Now, separately, it's very, very important for viewers and listeners to understand that
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  the New World Order, the globalist, can be defeated right now.
[23:52.000 --> 23:57.000]  Or they can be partially slowed down, but then they will continue to launch their attacks forever.
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  And they are very close to being defeated.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  People are awakening to who they are in their operations.
[24:02.000 --> 24:09.000]  And so, right now, we have a really good chance to mitigate hell on Earth in the coming years and decades.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  Does it mean all the problems will be solved?
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  Does it mean there won't be AI issues and fragments of the New World Order and then it won't congeal later
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  and come back with Satan that it's had as the Bible says it will?
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.000]  We can be given a hundred year of reprieve like Nineveh when Jonah was sent to awaken them.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  God gives us the choices to choose our own adventure.
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  It's like those books you read when you were a kid where they have three or four different endings depending on how you choose.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  And it's really up to us.
[24:38.000 --> 24:45.000]  So there is that Calvinistic system that I've definitely seen real where there's providence in God's plan,
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.000]  but God gives us the choice to decide how that plan is fulfilled.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  So, rolling over is hell on Earth.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  And even if the New World Order is going to take over and do all this and then Christ returns,
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  and even if that's about to happen the next five, ten years, God wants us to challenge this and fight this.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  That's why the rapture, pre-tribulation rapture is so bad.
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  And I'm not demonizing folks that are into that, but it was popularized by mainstream media in the 80s.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  Of course, it's been around for over 150 years.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  It's because then you don't believe you have to do anything.
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  Oh, we'll be raptured out of here.
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  Well, Revelation says after the archangel binds Satan and puts him in the pit,
[25:23.000 --> 25:31.000]  and Christ returns that the dead in Christ rise the spirits and meet him in the sky.
[25:31.000 --> 25:37.000]  Then there's a thousand-year reign on Earth of Christ, and then for a very short time,
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  Satan is released again and deceives another big group of people for one more test.
[25:42.000 --> 25:49.000]  That's what Revelation says a five-year-old can read that and know that and understand that.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  And boy, folks didn't know Revelation was so literal. It is.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  And whether you don't believe in God and the spiritual realm and all the rest of this,
[25:56.000 --> 26:03.000]  the globalists do with their CERN, you know, interdimensional communication device, they admit.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  They've taken the plan of Revelation and used it like a blueprint.
[26:06.000 --> 26:11.000]  We've all seen the meme, hey, you weren't supposed to use 1984 as an owner's manual.
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or George Soros.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  So to them, it's an owner's manual, and they're following it.
[26:20.000 --> 26:27.000]  The Bible tells us the devil will follow Scripture and follow the plan.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  The devil knows he's going to lose in the end.
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  And if this isn't good versus evil, then what is it?
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.000]  So we're closer to break. I'm going to come back and get into all this and play these clips
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  and get into Russia and all the rest of it.
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  But let me just say this right now to the listeners.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  Thanks for keeping us on air. We've been through hell.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  We've stood directly up against the deep state.
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  They've had the FBI, the CIA on record running all these attacks.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  It's come out in the news, mainstream news today.
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  They're targeting, you know, Trump supporters and leaders and info wars.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  But we have the populace. We have you.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  So if you'll just spread the word about the broadcast, we just pray for us.
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.000]  And if you'll just buy the products at infowarstore.com, we can continue on.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  But I got to tell you, I declared bankruptcy.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  Not the type where you get shut down, they liquidate everything,
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  but chapter five to keep a business.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  That's what they see this as going.
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  And sure, under this operation, I get paid almost nothing.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  But that's okay because I just want to keep it going.
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.000]  And so your money's going when you buy products to keep this on the air.
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  And then after the bankruptcy is determined, they'll create some settlement
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  with all these rig lawsuits.
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  But that's not where your money's going to go because there is no extra money at this point.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  In fact, we've dipped back into the red.
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  And so I'm asking listeners for all your past support.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  And I appreciate you and I thank you.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  We are caught up on shipping. The books have all been shipped out.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  We got a few weeks behind. That's never happened in our history.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  We are caught up now. So if you order products, you will get them.
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  We are shipping. If you order in the morning, same day in most cases.
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  We're not as good as Amazon, but we're close and we promote liberty and freedom.

[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  to help keep us on air.

[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  I want to encourage those of you that haven't gotten the book to go to infowarstore.com

[29:55.000 --> 30:06.000]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[30:06.000 --> 30:12.000]  and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  and to defend our immune systems.

[30:18.000 --> 30:21.000]  top of the line, as good as it's going to get.
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.000]  But then the supply chain broke down and it was sold out for more than a year.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules.

[32:08.000 --> 32:14.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[32:14.000 --> 32:15.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[32:19.000 --> 32:20.000]  but really they're just a commune.
[32:20.000 --> 32:23.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[32:25.000 --> 32:30.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[32:34.000 --> 32:37.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[32:37.000 --> 32:41.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[32:46.000 --> 32:47.000]  We had like that.
[32:47.000 --> 32:48.000]  I think you wouldn't believe it.
[32:48.000 --> 32:53.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[32:53.000 --> 33:01.000]  If you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[33:01.000 --> 33:19.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:19.000 --> 33:24.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[33:24.000 --> 33:36.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.000]  We are back.
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide on this live Monday edition.
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  Huge developments in Russia.
[33:43.000 --> 33:50.000]  Massive developments on the COVID front and incredible intrigue unfolding in communist China right now.
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  We don't just have elections coming up in Brazil for Bolsonaro to be re-elected.
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  We don't just have in Sweden right wing anti-New World Order folks getting elected.
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.000]  We don't just have in Canada the new leader of the Conservative Party, the poll show,
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  would destroy Trudeau, the national election right now.
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.000]  Coming to power who speak out against Klaus Schwab, who speak out against Bill Gates,
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  who speak out against the New World Order.
[34:13.000 --> 34:20.000]  We don't just have all this and so much more going on with Italy electing an anti-globalist.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  We have another election taking place.
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  And this is by the Central Committee and the Politburo.
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  A few thousand people get to vote in China, not their billion, 400 million.
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.000]  And if they don't vote, they get executed or put in prison.
[34:35.000 --> 34:41.000]  And that's Xi Jinping who is set to be elected permanent dictator.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  You go, well, how's the elected dictator?
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  Well, when a Politburo, when a bunch of oligarchs,
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  plutocrats elect you to be the dictator, you are the dictator.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  Like the Roman Senate voting to make Caesar a dictator.
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  Yes, Hitler was elected as well.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  Then they use the election to take over.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  Is Xi Jinping missing?
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  Rumors of military coup in China explained.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  They have shut down a lot of the trains nationally.
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.000]  A bunch of folks have been arrested.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  And it goes on from there.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  Fact check, is China having a coup and is Xi Jinping under house arrest?
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  Here's what we know.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  China becomes hot house of intrigue out of critical Communist Party Congress.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  And it goes on from there.
[35:21.000 --> 35:28.000]  So we don't know right now, but that's the election that they're having for dictatorship.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  So continuing, I want to play a clip here that I mentioned earlier.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  Look at the big Russian news, Edward Snowden news.
[35:35.000 --> 35:42.000]  And this is Georgia, the new leader, Maloney, who is anti-New World Order all the way.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  And she asked in a powerful speech that has subtitles I'm going to read.
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  Why is the family an enemy?
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  Because it defines us.
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  It's our identity.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  Everything that defines us is not the enemy.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  We will defend God, country, and family.
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  Now that's an American slogan.
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  It's a Brazilian slogan.
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  It's a German slogan.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  It's an ancient slogan of the West.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  God, country, family.
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  Or some say God, family, country.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  In Brazil, I think it's God, family, country.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  And I would agree.
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  It should go God, family, country, not God, country, family.
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.000]  But every country has this in the Western culture.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  Hitler took it and twisted it, to be fair.
[36:22.000 --> 36:31.000]  I invoke, I'm right, I'm pure, I invoke one people, I'm right, one land.
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  I'm pure, one leader.
[36:35.000 --> 36:36.000]  That's twisted.
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.000]  It's not under God, under family, under country.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  He said one people, one land, one leader.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  One dictatorship.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  She didn't say that.
[36:50.000 --> 36:57.000]  She said one people, one God, one country, one people.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  And so I'm going to do my best.
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  She talks fast.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  I talk fast, too, like the Italians.
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  She talks even faster.
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  I'm going to do my best to read these subtitles.
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  Because again, a lot of listeners go, hey, we can read, dude.
[37:09.000 --> 37:10.000]  You don't need to read.
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  We have 400 plus radio affiliates.
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  So they need to, most of them don't speak Italian.
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  So I certainly don't.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  I guess it's a romantic language.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  So whether you speak Spanish or Italian,
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  they can understand each other.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  But I don't have a romantic background.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  I have a Germanic language background.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  That's what British is, a Germanic, multi-Mongol language
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  of about six different Germanic tongues.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  But I digress, not a linguist.
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  That's just the history of it.
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  Here it is.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  This is about what we are doing here today.
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  Why is the family enemy?
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  Why is the family so frightening?
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  There is a single answer to all these questions.
[37:58.000 --> 37:59.000]  Because it defines us.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  Because it is our identity.
[38:03.000 --> 38:09.000]  Because everything that defines us is now the enemy.
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  For those who would like us to no longer have an identity,
[38:14.000 --> 38:24.000]  and to simply be perfect consumer slaves.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  And so they attack national identity.
[38:27.000 --> 38:33.000]  They attack religious identity.
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.000]  And they attack gender identity.
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  They attack family identity.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  I can't define myself as an Italian Christian woman mother.
[38:42.000 --> 38:50.000]  I must be citizen X, gender X, parent one, parent two.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  I must be a number.
[38:53.000 --> 39:01.000]  Because when I am only a number, when I no longer have an identity or roots,
[39:01.000 --> 39:08.000]  then I will be a perfect slave at the mercy of financial speculators.
[39:08.000 --> 39:15.000]  A perfect consumer.
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  That's the reason why.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  That's why we inspire so much fear.
[39:22.000 --> 39:29.000]  That's why this event inspires so much fear.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  Because we do not want to be numbers.
[39:31.000 --> 39:37.000]  We will defend the value of the human being.
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  Every single human being.
[39:38.000 --> 39:47.000]  Because each of us has a unique genetic code that is unrepeatable.
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  And lack it or not, that is sacred.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  We will defend it.
[39:50.000 --> 39:58.000]  We will defend God, country and family.
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  Those things that discuss people so much, we will do it to defend our freedom.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  Yes.
[40:06.000 --> 40:17.000]  Because we will never be slaves and simple consumers at the mercy of financial speculators.
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  This is our mission.
[40:18.000 --> 40:24.000]  This is why I came here today.
[40:24.000 --> 40:31.000]  Chesterton wrote more than a century ago.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  Let's see if I can find it.
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.000]  I will be kindled to testify that two and two make four.
[40:42.000 --> 40:53.000]  Swords will be drawn to prove that leaves are green in summer.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  The time has arrived.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  We are ready.
[40:55.000 --> 41:01.000]  Thank you.
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  Bravo.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  And let me tell you something.
[41:04.000 --> 41:11.000]  We are ready to make that two-minute speech and teach a master class on reality.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  She attached the central bankers that run it all.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  She explains they want to destroy our very identity and who we are to take us over and control us to finally kill us.
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  She explains that that is why it is total war and why these foundations of humanity are our defense.
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.000]  This is the very process of what makes us who we are.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  This was extremely powerful.
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  They are extremely scared.
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.000]  You can just look at her.
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  You can look at her eyes.
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.000]  You can hear her.
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.000]  You can look at her past.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  She is an angel.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  She is real.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  She is amazing.
[41:41.000 --> 41:50.000]  And she scares the living hell out of these Satanists that want us to be their slaves because they want to mount our collective head on a wall.
[41:50.000 --> 41:57.000]  But we will not let them do it and we will not surrender because surrender is a thousand times worse than fighting back.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  There is no choice but to resist.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  Victory is resistance.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  Resistance is victory.
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.000]  We have a culture.
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  We are human.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  We made the image of God.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  We are each individuals with an amazing destiny.
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  We believe in ourselves.
[42:10.000 --> 42:17.000]  We love ourselves because we love the God that made us and we will be part of the animating contest of Liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[42:17.000 --> 42:24.000]  And as she said, there will be fires and war just to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[42:24.000 --> 42:39.000]  Swords will be drawn to say that leaves are green in summer because that's what the authoritarians do is attack basic common sense and logic because to submit to tyranny takes suspending logic and being a fool to say two men can have a baby
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.000]  or to say pedophilia is good or to say open borders is good or to say communism is good.
[42:44.000 --> 42:51.000]  You have to wage war on your common sense and your own life force and your own forces of self-preservation.
[42:51.000 --> 42:58.000]  Well, I call for the age of human supremacy and building a world that's pro-human and you just heard the new leader of Italy repeat that.

[44:10.000 --> 44:15.000]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with and we said,

[44:21.000 --> 44:27.000]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.

[44:59.000 --> 45:08.000]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family to destroy heterosexual relationships to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear.
[45:08.000 --> 45:15.000]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom.
[45:15.000 --> 45:19.000]  And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[45:19.000 --> 45:25.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people having lasting good love and relationships.
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  They want to break up society.
[45:27.000 --> 45:36.000]  We are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world available as a major sponsor now.

[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  I'll be completely honest with you ladies and gentlemen.
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  I knew that I was right 30 years ago and I started working to get on air.
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  And I knew the new water was going to unfold because I was reading her own documents.
[47:37.000 --> 47:48.000]  I was researching and because I had had family and others around me that had seen the inside of the system and they were telling me it was real.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  And I saw everything the globalists wanted 25 years ago.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.000]  They were getting.
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  And so I knew that they were systematically taking over.
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.000]  So I knew where they were taking us of global depopulation and hell on earth was a real place.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  And I didn't want to go there.
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.000]  I remember when I was about 16, my sister was about three years old.
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.000]  And I was still living at the house of my parents and we put in a DVD.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  I think DVDs were out there of VHS, a Beetlejuice.
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.000]  And she walks in and she sees the scene we're in there in the waiting room for eternity.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  And there's these shrunken head people.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  And it's kind of scary.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  And my dad's saying, yeah, maybe you should turn this off.
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  Your sister shouldn't be watching it.
[48:31.000 --> 48:37.000]  And before we could turn it off, she looked at me and she said, bubba, don't take me there.
[48:37.000 --> 48:43.000]  She's like three years old and she's seeing the scary thing in Beetlejuice.
[48:43.000 --> 48:49.000]  Yeah, it was this scene with Alec Baldwin.
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  And she said, don't take me there, bubba.
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  She calls me bubba.
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  Please don't take me there.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  Great job, crew, finding that so fast.
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  I didn't tell you I wasn't talking about that.
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  But see, this wasn't a fantasy when I was three years old.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  This was when I was 20 years old.
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  Knowing they were doing it, knowing what they had planned decades before,
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  in the Brzezinski books I'd read, that he'd written decades before,
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  that I'd just read, that what he said they'd do 20 years before, they did.
[49:16.000 --> 49:23.000]  And so then I was reading books they'd written then, in like 1994, 1995,
[49:23.000 --> 49:30.000]  I guess around 16, like 1990, 1991, that had come true.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  So I'm like, wait, they wrote these books 20, 30 years ago and now I'm living it?
[49:34.000 --> 49:43.000]  Now they're really going to be able to carry this out.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  And that's where we are.
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  So my sister said to me, bubba, don't take me there.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  Well, I'm saying to all you folks, please don't take me there.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  Please, I don't want to take you there.
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.000]  The only way we stop going there, the next leg of this hellish journey,
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  is getting right with God and saying no to this.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  So we've got a lot of big Russia news with the escalating war.
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.000]  And yes, Russia fighting NATO forces in a trap has been losing.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  Russia's been losing.
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  And now Putin, as I said he would do months ago, called up 300,000 troops
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  and heavier equipment and class A military.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  He was using his lower level stuff before, he's also getting conscripts.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  And now NATO's saying nuclear war could happen very easily.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  Putin says there's no bluff, nuclear war could happen.
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.000]  I mean, we're actually talking about this in the fall of 2022.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  This is happening now.
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.000]  And then you add to all of this that people think Putin will be defeated.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  He militarily could be defeated conventionally.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  But as they say in the movie war games, the only way to win this game
[50:47.000 --> 50:53.000]  is not to play when you're talking about hydrogen bombs and missiles.
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  And suitcase nukes.
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  And so that's where we are now.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  And I wouldn't say we're two minutes to midnight.
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  We're two seconds from midnight on the doomsday clock.
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.000]  And Europe wants a destabilization.
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  They want a great reset.
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  They wanted, as Klaus Schwab said a year and a half ago, carbon lockdowns.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  And now they're saying, isn't it great?
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  There's no fuel or no gas, so we'll just have a post-industrial world.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  Russia's making double profits what they were making just a year ago.
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.000]  Russia's paying a price in blood, but not financially.
[51:30.000 --> 51:35.000]  And so those that think Putin will be defeated are naive because it's economic war.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  And the West is losing.
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.000]  The problem is the globalists want the West to lose.
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.000]  In other Russian news, Putin, this just broke in FullWars.com,
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  Putin gives Edward Snowden Russian citizenship, state media reports.
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  Within months after Russia invaded Ukraine, some in the US media began to question,
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  where is Edward Snowden, whistleblower?
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  Silence since Russia invaded Ukraine.
[51:58.000 --> 52:04.000]  As one April Newsweek headline read, the Ukraine offensive had clearly put the NSA whistleblower
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  in deeply awkward position and thus he went relatively silent on Twitter.
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.000]  The Russian government has provided him asylum since he fled there from Hong Kong in 2013
[52:13.000 --> 52:19.000]  as he was wanted man for exposing illegal mass domestic spying by the NSA and US intelligence.
[52:19.000 --> 52:27.000]  Today, Russia state media is out with an explosive headline and a new development regarding Snowden's fate.
[52:27.000 --> 52:33.000]  Putin signs decree granting Snowden Russian citizenship according to state run RAI.
[52:33.000 --> 52:40.000]  TASS is reporting that Putin has given Snowden Russian citizenship.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  So you have that news there.
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  And here's some of the headlines.
[52:44.000 --> 52:49.000]  Russia will lose war in Ukraine may be naive.
[52:49.000 --> 52:54.000]  Italy has rejected EU's war with Russia and shock election rocks great reset agenda.
[52:54.000 --> 53:01.000]  Despite all of this, the economy of Europe continues to plunge.
[53:01.000 --> 53:12.000]  Desperate Russian shoots recruitment officer instead of sign up to fight in Ukraine.
[53:12.000 --> 53:18.000]  All many Russians have opted to flee the country to dodge Vladimir Putin's desperate draft for the war in Ukraine.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  One man took his protest a little bit further and shot a recruitment officer.
[53:22.000 --> 53:29.000]  Authorities announced Monday's attack which unfolded the city of Ole Misske and I can't pronounce all this region of Siberia.
[53:29.000 --> 53:34.000]  The video of the incident inside an enlistment office appears to show a gunman dressed in military fatigues
[53:34.000 --> 53:41.000]  firing on the official at point like range causing other potential draughties to flee the room.
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  Here's another one.
[53:42.000 --> 53:45.000]  U.S. warns Russia of catastrophic consequences of nuclear strike.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  French news agency.
[53:47.000 --> 53:51.000]  Russia military recruitment centers attack amid mobilization pushback.
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.000]  Multiple attacks.
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  Lights out.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  Ovens off.
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  Europe preps for winter energy crisis.
[53:57.000 --> 54:04.000]  Seven kids dead as Columbine inspired maniac storm school with hate on ammo.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  That's the weird headline from the sun.
[54:06.000 --> 54:14.000]  At least 50 people have died including 11 children about 24 have been injured after a man and a black t-shirt and balaclava opened fire on students at a school in Russia.
[54:14.000 --> 54:25.000]  The government who was armed with two flare guns which had been converted to fire live ammunition according to Russian media.
[54:25.000 --> 54:30.000]  So all hell as they say is breaking loose.
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.000]  Pray for peace.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  Pray for justice.
[54:33.000 --> 54:38.000]  Roger Waters the Ukrainian government's called for his assassination.
[54:38.000 --> 54:45.000]  The head of Pink Floyd who's a famous anti-war guy has just called for peace and for Russia and the West make a deal.
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  And I've called for that too.
[54:48.000 --> 54:53.000]  Well now they're trying to cancel his concerts in Europe because he's done that.
[54:53.000 --> 54:59.000]  Since when are people calling for peace the bad guys when it can end our world as we know it.
[54:59.000 --> 55:07.000]  I want to give the toll free number out next hour to talk about the Italian election to talk about populist victories worldwide to talk about the Russia crisis.
[55:07.000 --> 55:14.000]  To talk about 43 days the midterms the deep state says patriots are about to shoot people and blow stuff up any minute.
[55:14.000 --> 55:19.000]  Obviously preparing false flags or provocative operations.
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  It's a free for all totally open phones.

[55:49.000 --> 56:00.000]  That's what globalism is is economic cultural asymmetrical warfare economic warfare cultural warfare degradation demoralization but they always lead to big physical conflicts.
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  China's locked down a bunch of railways major cities are locked down.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  There's reports of coups inside China wars and rumors of wars.
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.000]  This is the birthing pains for something much much larger that's obviously coming.
[56:13.000 --> 56:22.000]  And we have Jen Psaki saying on the upcoming midterms elections former top Biden spokesperson admits it was a referendum on the president Democrats will lose.
[56:22.000 --> 56:28.000]  That's why they're making a referendum that Republicans are white supremacist and terrorist.
[56:28.000 --> 56:35.000]  We have major world leaders major heads of government agencies in the US and Europe calling for pedophilia that's coming up next hour.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  I mean these people are taking the mask off.

[58:12.000 --> 58:13.000]  We need money.

[58:36.000 --> 58:40.000]  We'll just keep we'll just keep minting money as you're in this forum.
[58:40.000 --> 58:43.000]  Let's move on.
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  People care about the First Amendment.
[58:49.000 --> 58:57.000]  Donald Trump and the Magna Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  In fact I bet it does.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  I bet it's called Operation Matador.
[59:05.000 --> 59:16.000]  They see us as the bull and they are shaky a red flag in our face and the Matador is the deep state with a long skinny razor sharp sword.
[59:16.000 --> 59:27.000]  So that when the bull lunges forward the Matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as the bull buries himself into the dust.
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.000]  They've got the ace of spades in their hand which is false flags before you launch a war you stage false flags.
[59:33.000 --> 59:37.000]  That's the first thing you do because nobody wants to say they started a war.
[59:37.000 --> 59:43.000]  Bad guys start wars so every time a war gets launched by bad guys they stage an event.
[59:43.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  This is Operation Matador.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Info Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Denver is now handing out free bug out bags to help you just in case you run into emergency.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  Lisa, I asked you last time I need to know the checklist of everything I've got to put in my bug out bag.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  Toilet paper, paper towels, toilet paper, paper towels, we've got cotton balls, two opportunities to get these free emergency preparedness bags.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  So really an important effort especially when we're talking about severe weather.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  Yeah and I know a lot of people are going to go and get those bags but for people who maybe can't make it out there is there anything in there that's you know too tough that you couldn't just put one of those together yourself.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Yeah there's a lot of stuff you could easily put together yourself I mean if you got an extra cotton balls you know paper towels, toilet paper.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  The city of Denver is letting the locals know they should be prepared for an unexpected order to get out of town in a hurry and many people are connecting dots between this and the Denver International Airport.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  The Denver International Airport has long been rumored to be sitting atop an underground military base built deep beneath the surface and connected to several other underground bases.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  These rumors are the result of several interesting facts.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  From 1995 until he was found dead a year later Phil Schneider gave dozens of lectures claiming to be a geological engineer hired to build deep underground military bases known as DUMMS for the US government.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  His father was Captain Oscar Schneider a former Nazi stationed in Florida working black operations for naval intelligence.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  Phil Schneider was showing samples of what he claimed were unknown exotic metals.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  He provided maps of the underground DUMMS and showed off dramatic scars that he claimed were from a violent skirmish with a non human species deep underground.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  In January of 1996 Schneider was found dead in his home days after he mysteriously died of strangulation.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Investigations were never completed and it was ruled a suicide. His evidence went missing.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Before he died Phil Schneider used his clearance to take investigative author Alex Christopher into the top underground levels of the Denver Airport where they took pictures of a long road heading off to multiple destinations.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Built upon 53 square miles of land 25 miles from downtown the Denver Airport was billions of dollars over budget.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Different contractors were hired for each section some of whom have come forward and claimed it would take days to show you what's down there.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  Inside the otherwise unimpressive airport there is a capstone with cryptic Illuminati and Masonic imagery marking a time capsule buried beneath to be opened in 2094.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  The airport opened with a famous four piece mural depicting biological warfare death and destruction the surrender of all national sovereignty and the emergence of a new religion.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  On the floor for no apparent reason is what appears to be the symbol for gold and silver in a mining cart AU AG which is also the abbreviation for a deadly strain of hepatitis discovered in 1965.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  Outside on the surface the runways form the shape of a swastika and passengers are greeted by what has become known as Blucifer a 32 foot horse with glowing red eyes that reportedly killed its creator when a piece of the sculpture came loose and severed an artery in his leg.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  This is why many people are talking about Denver's bug out bag program which is good because now that we know who the people committing these historic crimes against humanity are.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  We can't just let them slip away into some hole somewhere.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Reporting for Info Wars this is Greg Reese.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  The best selling book in America last week was the Great Reset and the War for the Worlds written by Alex Jones.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week but the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million people killed so they lied about his book.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  The Great Reset and the War for the World the historic book that lays out the plans of the Great Reset Death Star and exposes the New World Order's plans for global enslavement.

[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  So the planet's food supply at every level is being purposely turned off.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  The planet's energy supply is being purposely turned off.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  The third world was under two years plus of lockdown and now the very globalists that engineered this are posing as our savers while they carry it out.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  And why are they coming out in the open so much in promoting world government, promoting communism, promoting putting microchips in us to buy and sell,
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  promoting pedophilia because they're evil and this is what they want and they're a cult.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  And they got a bunch of followers that'll do what they're told for power so they're going for broke.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  I'm going to get to that. Spain's Minister of Equality Irene Montero says children have the right to consent to sexual relations with adults including five-year-olds.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  This is on national television, the government, head of an agency. This is who they are.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  It's a Nambla army. It's a pedophile army. I warned you about for decades.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  It's what they want is the future and innocence. They want to destroy the human soul.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  Just like in the archetype of a zombie, they want brains because they don't have brains.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  They have an envy of life, an envy of innocence. They want to destroy it.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  Well, let's talk about the evil raggedy and the former White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, on upcoming midterm elections.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Former top Biden spokesperson says if it's a referendum on the president, Democrats will lose. Here's the clip.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  If it is a referendum on the president, they will lose and they know that.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  They also know that crime is a huge vulnerability for Democrats. I would say one of the biggest vulnerabilities.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Now, if Biden was actually president, she'd be scared to say that. She knows Obama is the president.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  So the arrogance of this.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  Let's play this clip. White House advisor Keisha Bottoms.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  Biden's been very clear.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  My Republican plan is to essentially destroy the United States of America.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Trump tried to empower America.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Say what you want about the poison shots. Everything else he did was really good.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  He tried to bring jobs back, secure the border, lower crime he did, made us a number one energy exporter in the world.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  Everything they say about us is what they themselves are doing. Here she is.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  This election is a very important election, not just for Democrats, but also for Republicans, also for independents,
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  and anyone who cares about the United States of America.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  There is a MAGA Republican agenda that gives no consideration to the rule of law,
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  that has no respect for a woman's right to choose, that wants to defund the FBI.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  There is a MAGA Republican agenda that thought that it was okay to attack our nation's capital on January 6th.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  I think people will think of all of these things when they go to the ballot box, no matter what their party affiliation is.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  And I think that they will vote accordingly.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  I've noticed, and I think a lot of people have noticed a certain phrase that you have been using since the very first answer.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  And that's MAGA Republicans or MAGA Republican agenda.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  It is a tough line being taken by the president and by you here right now against Republicans writ large.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  My question is, will the president, and will folks in the administration between now and the November 8th elections
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  keep hammering away at that phrase, at that imagery?
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  Well, I think it will be important for all of us who care about the United States of America to call out what we see.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  And what we see, again, with this MAGA Republican agenda, is an effort to disrupt our democracy.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  So whether it be through November and beyond November, I think it will always be important to call out any effort there is to destroy,
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  essentially destroy the United States of America.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  President Biden has been very cool.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  Okay, I can't listen anymore of it.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  So everything she said was a lie, except the abortion thing.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  We're talking about the lives of children.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  The Republicans want to destroy the country.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  The Republicans want to attack the capital.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  New footage of ray apps with the sign ramming the police.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Pets know that.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  Anybody that ran police is a sedition conspiracy charge, in solitary confinement, but not him.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  A little jibber.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  We're putting it on screen.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  So Owen Shroyer was there trying to stop people going in with me.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  They indicted him.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  Our cameraman, Sam Wentoya, just shot video of it.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Indicted.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  But if you're actually ramming police with a giant metal barricade, hey, baby, you're good.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  And rest him and the rest of the committee members come out and defend him.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  They think you're stupid.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Total lies.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's turning up the heat.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Hillary has now compared minor rallies to Hitler, claiming people waving their hands are Hitler.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  Just like Democrats the last few weeks said, Christians putting their hands up to God.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  And part of worship and praise is Hitler.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  They call it the double Hitler salute.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  These people are ridiculous, but their constituents folks are mindless.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  They actually believe it.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  So they're defining the American people as Nazis.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Here she is.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  I remember as a young student, you know, trying to figure out how did people get basically drawn in by Hitler?
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  How did that happen?
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  And I'd watch newsreels and I'd see this guy standing up there ranting and raving and people shouting and raising their arms.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  I thought, what's happened to these people?
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Why did they believe that?
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  You saw the rally in Ohio the other night.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  Trump is there ranting and raving for more than an hour and you have these rows of young men with their arms raised.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  I thought, what is going on?
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  So there is a real pressure and I think it is fair to say we're in a struggle between democracy and autocracy.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  So if you got a football game and raise your hand or wave or church, you're a Nazi.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  These people are desperate.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  And again, the video is on InfoWars.com of REAPs helping ram the giant metal barricade into or the giant metal skeleton of a Trump sign into the police.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  FBI whistleblower reveals widespread discussions at the Bureau in bombshell.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  Bomb Gino interview.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  More of these whistleblowers coming public that they're ordered to target political enemies and frame them.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  Nasty rep Jamie Raskin on the January 6th, when he claims he doesn't know who REAPs is after standing up for REAPs earlier.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  And the health keepers are forced to go to trial this week on bogus issues, conspiracy charges.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  All the government denies the discovery, arrests the key witnesses, and jury bias plagues the kangaroo court process.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  Total authoritarian lawlessness.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  I just gave out the toll free number 877-789-2539.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  We're going to go to Joel and Fatima and Noah and Charlene and Gary and Ventura and Diego, Andrew, Bill, Jeremiah, Jared and others.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  We're going to take your calls, the order they are received.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  Please don't forget we're in an information war.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  That means when you spread the articles, the videos, tell them about the show, it changes the world.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  When you don't, the enemy wins.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  So thank you all for tuning in.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  You are the most hated people on earth by the globalist pedophile armies.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  Because we're winning, and pop police are getting elected everywhere, and we're turning the tide.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  This is an exciting time, but you are seen by the enemy as the most dangerous people on earth towards their tyranny because you are.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  So please spread the word, please spread the broadcast, and please go to infowarstore.com and get the trifecta pack of DNA Force Plus

[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  Info wars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right now.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  And today is do or die time.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  If info wars gets the funding into the midterms in the next year, we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  But if we don't, I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main operations.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  I've done my work, I've put everything into it, I'm leaving it on the field.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  But I believe in a gut level, you're going to come through, plus you're going to get great products that your family already need.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  So don't procrastinate, show info wars, you want us to stay on the air.

[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  So please take action now. Thank you.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  And I believe the most powerful.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  The man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  The citizen of a republic.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  The man in the arena.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence in the world.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  It will never be made again.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  It's not just an amazing historic coin. It funds the information war against the globalist.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  This is something you want to own.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalist.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available. They'll sell out very quickly.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  Please be part of history and thank you all for your support.

[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself.

[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  Yo everyone, thanks for watching!
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  West Virginia
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  West Virginia
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  Blue Ridge Mountains
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Shannon, Noah River
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  Life is older
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  Older than the trees
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  Younger than the mountains
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  Growing like a breeze
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Country roads
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  Taking home
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  To the place
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  I belong
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  West Virginia
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  Mountain Mama
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  We're going to your phone calls here, and then I'm going to hit the coming out of the closet by government officials promoting pedophilia.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  It's their religion. We got to come to grips with it. We got to face it.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  And I also have news that is very positive, but it's also horrific to know.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  Every day, more top scientists, including FDA board members, European board members of their FDA, go public and say these shots don't work and they're killing people en masse.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  I have a stack of new scientists coming out now and new studies.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  But let that sink in that we knew this was going on two and a half years ago because we knew the enemy operation and they knew because they did it.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  And now it's confirmed and just let that roll over you that that's how evil these people are.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  You're like, why do they want to rape children? Why do they want to destroy their innocence? Why do they want to ruin their lives?
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  That's the next best thing to killing them.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  You've got to come to grips and I'm telling myself that not just you that we're dealing with absolute pure evil.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  What fool would want to sign on to be part of this evil?
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  Only people that play along and pretend they're part of the establishment that they're going to get ahead by being part of this.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  No, you'll destroy yourself and us along with you.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  Joel in Idaho wants to talk about Russia conflict and the NWO. Go ahead, sir.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  Hi, Alex. Long time listener. I've been listening to you since Fukushima.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  I'm really glad to be on here with you today. So I've got a few things to say about the whole Russia situation.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  The left wants war with Russia. If they could, they'd kill every single last Russian.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  So I think the only way we're going to be able to make our voice heard is by having mass protests in every capital city in the United States and across the world in Brazil and Germany, France and Italy.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  I totally agree. We're on the verge of nuclear war. Even the Pentagon admits that this crap needs to stop now over a Slavic civil war.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  No, sir needs to stop right now.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  I agree. It's completely ludicrous. And, you know, the people in the Pentagon are absolute psychopaths, the ones who are in charge of this kind of stuff, and they want to use their nukes.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  So it's a match made in hell.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  So, I mean, if we had 10,000 conservatives in every city, 500,000 people across the states, I think that wouldn't make our voices heard. I don't know what happened to that.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Oh, there's no doubt that if 500,000 people went into demonstrations in front of government facilities, in front of media outlets, and at military bases peacefully saying we don't want war, the troops don't want war, we don't want nuclear war, that would send a message.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  We need to do that.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  Right. And it has to be peaceful. And if, you know, the government provocateurs get there and they start messing stuff up, we have to detain them. We have to police ourselves so they don't do it for us.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  What do you make of this new footage that shows Ray Apps hands on the giant steel sign ramming it into the police?
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  I mean, we have him dead to rights and Raskin, the head of the committee, has defended him, said he's a great guy, has interviewed him.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  Now Raskin says he doesn't know who he is. Total perjury by that criminal from Maryland Raskin.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  Yes, they're all criminals in Congress. And Ray has his compromise and he's a tool being used by the FBI against all of us. And he was really good at what he did.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  So I think if we keep the heat on him, eventually he'll pop and we can unravel the J6. I think he has been of this whole thing.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  So I was going to say, we can get somebody like Ron DeSantis or Trump, or maybe both of them, other conservative leaders to come out and say, hey, get 10,000 conservatives in each city.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  Don't burn anything down. Don't invade. Don't do anything crazy or stupid. Have a sign. Have a candlelight. You know, pray for humanity.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  No, I agree. I've been calling for candlelight vigils and I'm not saying we caused it, but there's suddenly candlelight vigils are happening in the US, Europe, you name it, against war.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Yes, I was listening to you yesterday. I think that's a great idea. But beyond that, I just had a few other things I wanted to go across.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  You know what? I'm going to step up. I'm going to step up sometime this week. I'll pick a day. We should go to the Texas Capitol and have a candlelight vigil.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  It's a great idea. I was actually lived in Austin a couple of years ago. I moved down there in part because of you, but man, that place has turned into a hellhole.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  Brother, it is horrible. I mean, only in the central area is it left. It's run, but it's like a little piece of San Francisco landed here. Thank you, Joe.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  All right, let's go ahead and take more calls. Let's talk to Jared in Texas. Speaking of Texas, Jared, thanks for calling.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  Wow. Thank you so much, Alex. Thank you for the work you're doing. God bless you. Thank you.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  Yeah, I just wanted to plug novusorderwatch.org. You got to check it out. Unmasking the modernist, Vatican II, pedophiles, the fake Catholics, antipopes, the real church is underground again, so go check it out.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  Yeah.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  Well, that's the thing. You know, real Catholics, I'm not Catholic myself. I'm just a Christian, but I know a lot of Catholics that I would say are followers of Christ.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  The hardest fighting people I know are the underground church, people like Mel Gibson and others. I know his dad and I know him, but, you know, they're the best people.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  And, you know, that's why we saw the left attack Catholic schools and the rest of it, because they know that that is a huge growing movement. And this current pope is 100% New World Order.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  They're afraid of the rosary, Alex. They're afraid of the rosary. And St. Athanasia is back in, I don't know, the 300s or something.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  They have the buildings, but we have the faith. So that's all I have. And thank you so much for all you're doing.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  Absolutely. You know, I don't believe in idols, and I'm not saying the rosary is an idol, but it's not an idol in your church to have a cross or an image of Christ to focus your mind.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  And if you have, you know, a rosary or whatever, and you're praying to God, and other people are doing it, and you have the Holy Spirit, it's a focal point.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  Like putting your arms forward. They cannot stand that because God's a free will God. And if you reach out, I can tell you when I pray privately, I mean, I'll either get on my knees, put my head on the ground, or I just reach out and that just opens the channel.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  And it's beyond what you call meditation, and it literally opens the gate. And they're scared of that. And they're scared of people getting on their knees, or they're scared of people, you know, focusing on God.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  And they just can't stand it. They just absolutely can't stand it, because you have that crucifix in your hand, and you're holding it, and it's that loop, that symbol of eternity.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  You're holding that chain in your hand, and you're just focusing. It's a focal point.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  So they don't like crucifix, they don't like rosaries, they don't like crosses, they don't like getting on your knees, they don't like reaching your hands out, because it's the ritual of, I'm here, God, I want to find you, and you're holding that crucifix, God, I want you, I love you, I need you, please help us, please help us, please, please, please.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  That's what God wants. God wants us to repent and seek His face, like King David, the place of the most high, the quiet place of the most high. We've got to go to that place.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  So however you do it, you need to do it, folks, because we're on the verge of nuclear war, we're already in financial collapse, and it's just incredible.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  Alright, I'm going to go to break. I've got two calls that's taken, but that's not enough. No matter how good your calls are, I'm going to give each person two minutes.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  Someone take your calls. We're going to go to break. I'm going to come back and take your calls.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  And again, I don't hate to plug every segment, but we don't, we're not going to be here soon. We are on the verge of collapse, like everything else.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  So please financial support InfoWars. Go to infowarstore.com, get a copy of The Great Reset, The War for the World, either unsigned, regular price, or the promotional prices of fundraiser.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  The bestselling book in America last week was The Great Reset and The War for the World, written by Alex Jones.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week, but the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million people killed. So they lied about his book.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  The Great Reset and The War for the World, the historic book that lays out the plans of The Great Reset Death Star and exposes the New World Order's plans for global enslavement.

[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  InfoWars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right now. And today is do or die time.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  If InfoWars gets the funding into the midterms in the next year, we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  But if we don't, I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main operations.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  I've done my work. I've put everything into it. I'm leaving it all in the field.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  But I believe at a gut level, you're going to come through, plus you're going to get great products that your family already need.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  So don't procrastinate. Show InfoWars. You want to stay on the air.

[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  Vitamin D3 and calcium and of course, DNA Force Plus. All these products are 50% off together in a combo pack or 40% off individually.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  So the great products you already need for your immune system and we need the money to stay on air. So please take action now. Thank you.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:23.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show.
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-900-4285.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  What are the best-selling, natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there?
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  But with our new product from X7 Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences that just do amazing things for your body.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds so a little bit of weight in the last three months and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also exercise.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  Well now Diet Force is exclusively available right now at InfowarsStore.com, 40% off.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:33:11.000]  InfowarsStore.com, Diet Force, you need to take-
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  Hello, hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Thank you.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  God bless you for the work that you do for God's kingdom. I think we're living in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  Okay, my question is, why can't Dr. Merlone, who created the MNR vaccine, the technology, which was originally created to go in and attack cancer cells,
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  why can't he take that same technology and use it again to go after the spike protein and the lipid nanoparticles that they're injecting into us with the COVID vaccine?
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Well absolutely, mRNA technology can be used for good, they've used it for evil, but again it's so experimental and almost every case they've tested it,
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  it causes a high percentage of side effects, including fatalities, so I don't think there's any perfect fix for this.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  None at all?
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  Well I'm not a genetic engineer, microbiologist, virologist, but yeah, every time they've tried this for 20 years, they've had mRNA for 20 years.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  A decade ago they did test in just a very small number of people, and it would cure cancer 90% of the time, but the rest of the time it would dissolve the liver.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  So it's Russian roulette, so the problem is it doesn't work, and so it works sometimes, but a lot of the time it kills you.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  Thank you for the answer. I think right now everybody's so evil out there, I'm afraid to go outside of my house.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  These people, I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and these people are like raging lunatics, you're standing in a line and they're yelling at you,
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  and so I hope it's not as bad down there in Texas.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  Well the economy is in deep trouble, they're not telling us we're really in a depression, but all the numbers show that.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  God bless you, Charlene, just find a good family group, find a good church, stick together, we're going to make it through this.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  But yeah, I know the temperature's been raised a lot, thank you.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  Let's go to Gary in Florida. Gary, go ahead.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  Alex, God bless you. I would just make a suggestion when you're at one of your next court, the impromptu press conferences that you're having.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  I just think it would be so powerful for you to just speak about all the damages that the vaccines are doing to children, the myocarditis, the heart attacks,
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  like any question that they ask, you just answer with powerful facts about what harms being done to children.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  I agree, everybody should be going to city council meetings, school board meetings, where they tried to force this, but it failed everywhere, including now in New York it's failing.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  But notice they tried to buffalo outside of law and intimidate as many children in places like Portland DC, New York, you name it, Chicago, to make the kids take it.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  And now they're having to pull back because they know they're in deep trouble and it's coming out, it's killing people.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  Well, they knew the whole time, not the people pushing into the ground level, but those above it.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  And so you're absolutely right, everywhere we can now, we have to point out that we're vindicated, it's true, it was all a fraud.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  Yeah, 10 year olds do not have heart attacks. God bless you, Alex. Thank you.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  God bless you. You know, he raises that. At the start of the next segment, I'm going to hit the newest news on that front. It's unbelievable.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call here. Let's talk to Noah in Oklahoma. Noah, go ahead.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  Hey, it's Noah. I'm 15 years old. I live in Oklahoma and I just want to say it's an honor to talk with you.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  An honor to talk to you, sir. Go ahead. Yeah, just, you know, in these end times, you really got to stand together with your family because nations were never built on one person.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  You can't go out there and live on your own in these end times. You need a community and that's what it's going to take to survive in these end times.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  And we also need Jesus and these are our only hope. We can't trust on how much guns we have, how much food we have.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  You know, we can't trust on any of that. It's really, we got to trust on God and that's the only thing we can do and community.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  And that's why God made the church to stand together because he knew that men are weak by themselves.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  But whenever they're together, they are strong. It's armies that take for down countries, not one man.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  So yeah, I just wanted to say that and just keep the good fight and just keep doing the Lord's work for us.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Well, I'm trying. I don't plan to be a saint here. I just don't like pedophilia and Satanism and World Government nuclear war.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  Is your family awake, Noah? And how did you find the show?
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  So my dad has been listening for a long time and I've been listening with him as long as I can, as you remember.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  And yeah, I think my uncle started listening first and then my dad caught on.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  And then yeah, we're all awake and just sticking in there and waiting for it to happen.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  Well, it's not like you needed me to tell you what was going on, but we have been one of the most successful show exposing the New World Order.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  Now, though, anybody that ever criticized you or attacked your dad or your uncle, they look like fools now because it's all here now.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  Yeah, I mean, like three years ago, me and my brother, we'd go, hey, you know, stuff's happening.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  Stuff's going to go down and they'd go, haha, you're so funny.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  And then we're like, we'd like to go back to those churches.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  We said that because we'd be like, what are you saying now? Because it is going down like we said, you know, we're not stupid.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  And then I have a job and I'm telling the guys at work, like, hey, it's stuff going down and it's not going to get any better.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  And they're going, what are you talking about? People are really blind to it.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  And, you know, it's just the exception of Satan has put, I mean, the Bible says that Satan has put a coded like a deception over their eyes.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  Well, when people turn their back on God, the Bible tells us that they're giving over to great delusion.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  Thank you so much for the call. Thank you so much, Noah.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Now this caller, Bill in New York, makes me think of Dr. Zalinko.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  And I was hard to think about Dr. Zalinko that died a few months ago and how quickly we forget what a beautiful soul he was and how much courage he had.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  Now he was one of the first doctors to go public and save millions of lives with the things he discovered.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  And he wasn't bluffing. He told me, he goes, look, I got heart failure and cancer. I'll probably be dead soon, but I love you, Alex.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  Alex, when I talked to him on the phone, I appreciate you keep it up. And he basically, by the end, was a follower of Christ.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  He said, we won't know what the next Messiah looks like just like we didn't know Jesus when he came.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  And, but, you know, he was obviously the Messiah. And he said that on air too. He said, you know, he said, I love Christians.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  I believe Christians are right. And I believe, you know, we're all together, folks.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  And he was a beautiful soul. And he always talked about people just can't deal with this. It's too horrible.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  It's too overwhelming. That's why only the Holy Spirit can give you the discernment to understand it because you don't want to rape children.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  You don't want nuclear war. You're not in the New World Order. You're not in their satanic club.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  So I was just thinking about Zalinko today and then this caller brings up the point he always made.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  Bill in New York, go ahead. Hey, that was a good segue right into that because that's exactly what I've been trying to deal with lately is exactly that point.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  Are you there? I am, sir. Okay, sorry. I didn't hear anything at first.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  So when you first brought Zalinko on, I was super inspired. I actually live not too far from Rochester. I'm over in the north of Syracuse.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  It's a pretty rural area, you know, people think in New York, they think in a city, you know, I'm out in the country, it's farmland.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  I own my own small business and people here are very conservative and kind and but very naive, you know.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  And I have family that, you know, they're all conservative.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  But when I try to talk to them about these things, it's like their eyes glaze over and they just don't, you know, they say, yeah, you know, that's serious, you know, but they just cannot, they can't accept, you know,
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  and my view is, you know, these people with genuinely good hearts, they just cannot, they cannot wrap their eyes or their heads rather around the idea of what's going on.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  And, you know, I actually tried to look up Zalinko, you know, I need a better doctor, you know, and all this COVID stuff was going on.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  And of course, you know, found out he was sick and that happened and, you know, God rest his soul.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  But I was leaving my doctor's office the other day after all this, all this stuff with the vaccines, things are finally coming out.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  My doctor goes, hey, Bill, when are you going to get vaccinated?
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  And I, my jaw dropped to the floor.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  I said, are you kidding me?
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  Never.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  You know, I can and walked out the door and thought I need to find another doctor.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Well, before you do that, take him a whole packet of info how it's all coming out as a fraud and, you know, hammer him with the truth so that at least he's been confronted with it.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  Thanks for the call, Bill. More calls straight ahead. Stay with us.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  Regular low grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things.

[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  Challenge first of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  Because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  that supplies the highest quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon and other U.S. government agencies.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  And now they have produced specifically for us this Made in America onion line at a very affordable price.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  Whether it's small pallet tubes that protect your cell phone or big pallets that protect laptops and iPads
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in like desktop computers.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  It is all exclusively available at infowarstore.com under the Redux name.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  Redux is Info Wars, taking the highest quality products and bringing them directly to you at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity from identity theft,
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  This is major, this is political, this could fund our war chest.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  Just go to amazon.com everybody and buy 10 copies.
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order because you read this, you know their whole plan, how to stop them.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  Hit the great reset in the world now, it's going to go to number one. What do you make of that?
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  The day before Dr. Zolinko died while emergency heart surgery, he made a six-minute statement,
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  here's three minutes of it, edited it down, dealing with, this is the hill to die on, this is it ladies and gentlemen.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  They'll let the latest vaccine news that's so huge you'll revact your calls.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  I just came from my doctors and not good news.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  My cancer, which I've been fighting for four years, has progressed.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  There's one last ditch effort that may lead to cure, which I'm going to do, but it's not sales and the estimates are unpleasant.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  But I've been at this place multiple times in the last four years.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  And so when someone lives with that consciousness, something happens, something very good happens.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  You kind of live each day and you appreciate time.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  And in reality, just think of it philosophically, you begin to die from the day before.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  No one lives forever.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  Some people live 20 years, some people live 100 years, but in the grand scheme of creation, it's fine.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  So in my opinion, it's not important when and how you die.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  It's much more important how you live.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  And so because when and how you die is not in your control, but how you live is in your control.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  How you think, how you speak, and how you act is within the free will and the volition of man.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  So my advice to people is appreciate the gift of consciousness in life, if you're being given.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  Happy birthday because every instant of time is a reactive recreation.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  It's a dynamic involvement in God's part for us to be.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  If you woke up, that's proof that He wants you to be and that you didn't finish your job.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  And I would say the world will be redeemed or fixed, rectified through acts of goodness and kindness.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Even if the sword is on your neck, you should never give up hope.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  I do feel the sword on my neck, but I'm still very hopeful.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  I live with more tranquility and serenity than I've ever had in my life, which is very counterintuitive.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  Because for the carnage and the malevolence evil that I've come to contact with in the last two years,
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  I would not expect that type of inner peace.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  But what I've realized is that when you're in alignment with the divine will,
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  there's a certain gift of tranquility that's given.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  It's not easy, by the way. It's very hard, but so am I.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  And it's kind of some struggle, but all the suffering that I went through, I still wouldn't give up.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  By the way, I didn't ask for this challenge, but no one asked me.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  So as I went through it, I am going through it.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  The serenity is really something that I've been seeking my whole life.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  I'm very grateful to have it.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  Very, very powerful, dead 24 hours later, roughly.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  But living on.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  And that's a universal message of God consciousness, and it's so real.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  It's so real.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  We're going to go to your phone calls. We have a special guest joining us coming up as well.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  We'll continue with phone calls.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  Thank you for giving.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  Thank you for supporting the Info War.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  Thank you for your kindness.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  Because without Info War, as I can tell you, we would not have exposed these poison shots,
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  and you wouldn't have a 99% reduction in the uptake of them that we now see.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  People are rejecting it everywhere.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  You and your actions, all of you have saved millions of lives, including conservatively, in the aggregate,
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  if they had kept us rolling.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  They're going to come back, but we're winning right now.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  We're winning this round.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  Your actions, supporting this broadcast, and our guests, and what we did here, and what unfolded,
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  saved millions of people.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  We did that together.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  And this isn't about bragging.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  It's not about that.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  I got Dr. Peter McCullough and a bunch of others on Joe Rogan, and they admit that's what finally broke its back.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  Hundreds of millions of views, his biggest shows ever.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  Even dwarf the ones I did now, and that's great.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  I'm glad I'm no longer the number one Joe Rogan interviews.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  And it's not just what I do on air.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  It's not just what you do calling it on air.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  It's what you do in person.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  This is important.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  And I made the phone calls.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  I twisted the arms.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  I said, you share these people, and it happened.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  And so that's what we're talking about here, is that this is a critical operation,
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  and we can't continue on without you.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  When I tell you that we need funds, you see all the headlines, we have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  That's a lie, so you don't support.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  You really want me to prove to you by imploding or shutting down
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  that InfoWars is under globalist attack and barely can pay the bills?
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Don't make me prove it to you.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  Please just support.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  Go now.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  Make the personal decision yourself to take action at InfoWarsTour.com
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  and get an unsigned copy or do the fundraiser copy for the signed copy.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  And I thank you for whether you get the unsigned or the signed at InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  Maybe you already read the book.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  Maybe you think it's amazing.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  Buy 10 copies.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  Give them away.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  Whatever you do, please support the broadcast,
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  because we really are the most effective operation against the New World Order.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  I never intended that to happen and know that would happen.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  God laid it on me more than 25 years ago, and I was already on air a few years,
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  that I was going to wake up the people that would defeat the New World Order through God's action.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  And we've done that.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  You see how most people say we woke them up.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  This broadcast is not just me, but the callers and the guests and the whole family,
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  the InfoWars, we did it together.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  God did that through us.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  So go to InfoWarsTour.com and get a signed copy now of the Great Reset in the War for the World.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  There are millions of people watching and listening.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  Only a fraction of them are going to get the book.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  If 5% of you went and got the book, our problems of funding would be over.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  But even if you can't buy the book or aren't going to buy the book,
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  just share the articles and the videos on your text message, your email.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  Those are the few places where we can still get information out and realize this is an information war.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  You can also get the limited edition Teddy Roosevelt coin,
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  that again is a fundraiser coin, a piece of history, a piece of art.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  That being sold as an investment in silver, it's got a big markup on it,
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  because we told you it has a big markup, because we need the funds to stay on air.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  It's a fundraiser, 1776coin.com.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  There's a limited amount left. There's about 5,000 left.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  We sold half of them.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  They'll never be any more of these coins made.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  1776coin.com.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  Okay, let's go to more callers.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  Jeremiah in Washington, you're on the air, Jeremiah.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  Hello, Alex.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  Hey, this is Jeremiah from Seattle.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  God bless you, man.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  You are the man amid the legend.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Thank you for everything you do, man.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  The man amid the meatball.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  So, it's enough about me, brother.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  What's on your mind today?
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  So, honestly, I really just wanted to reach out to you guys
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  and give you guys some product plug, if I could.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  The bodies product that you guys have has been crucial for my family.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  I'm the youngest one in my family, and I come from a half Asian background.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  So, I wish more Asians would come on to your show and speak up more, honestly.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  But I know that we like to be the model minority, what have you.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  Anyways, just going back to the bodies, you know, I presented this to my dad and also my mom,
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  and they were skeptical at first to try, you know, to work with this
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  because, you know, they've been having some body joint issues and things like that.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  Just even just getting up and down from the couch, you know,
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  I was training on them, so I was like, hey, try this out.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  And not even one day later, they came to me and said,
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  probably the first ever praise I've ever got from my parents was,
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  whatever you got from, wherever you got this from, it works fantastic.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  Well, let me say something about that just briefly.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  The average tumor pill out there works great.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  It's 5% of humanoid.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  This is the strongest out there. 95% we pay way more to get the strongest tumor on the market period.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  My wife has a lot of joint pain because she plays a lot of sports.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  And she said to me, well, hey, how is this a lower level on the bottle,
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  but it works better than these big horse pills I take of tumor.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  And I said, honey, because it's concentrated.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  And now she takes this and her hip pain because she plays tennis a lot is gone.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  So, yes, body's ultimate tumor formula is that good, brother. Go ahead.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  Exactly, exactly. And then I just wanted to say, you know, I'm not too much of a, you know,
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  like putting on the t-shirts and whatnot and, you know, giving that out.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  But after this helped out my family, you know, I started to hand this out to my friends.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  And they have no idea what Info Wars is all about.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  But I told them, hey, if you want more of this product, which I gave them an unsealed capsule,
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  you know what I mean? And I said, hey, this is for you. Just try it out.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  Give it a shot. And they also said the next day, they didn't even wait 24 hours.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  And they told me, dude, I'm already starting to feel like I'm young again, you know,
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  like, like, like I'm a, you know, basketball player.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  Jeremiah, hold on a second. Hold on a second. We'll be right back.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  Thanks to your donations and your support at infowarstore.com.

[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system,
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  for your brain, for every part of your body.
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  But what I don't see being promote is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects.
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  It certainly does for me. When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed,
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  Now there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  But I want you to experience it yourself. We know it's good for your heart.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  We know it's good for your brain. We know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  and every other function of your body.
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  But I want you to experience this high grade fish oil, this ultimate fish oil
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  at infowarstore.com and see what it does if you take it before bedtime.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:43.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  Thank you all for your support. You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  You know, that's something that didn't irritate me because I know they do it.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  But when they were up there putting scrambled mixed text messages up,
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  talking about one product or another to confuse people, it's a pure deception.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  They're like, and you sell silver coins, don't you? You make money off like, yeah.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  And you got Bitcoin donations and you kept that, didn't you?
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  No, didn't keep it. Put 95% of it into the company app.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  There is $60,000 left in there and I've got to have it because the bankruptcy court
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  ordered me to pay 40% of the legal bills, which I don't have the money for.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  So I'm getting ready to launch a fundraiser that's out in the open for Alex Jones
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  because I am absolutely running out of money. I have almost no money left.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  And I hate coming to you doing this, but you want to be to fight the New World Order.
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  You don't want me to quit, do you? In fact, I spend most of my time trying to find money.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  And I'm not bitching. I'm not complaining. Hey, if God wants,
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  maybe I'm about to have a heart attack. Maybe I've been on air too long.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  Maybe it's in God's plan that I don't get the funds.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  And if that's it, I'm actually very calm and serene about it.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  At least most of the time that I'm like, I can't stop. I got to find them harder.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  I got to get the money. I got to not let them win.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  But they're the ones that are losing. They're losers for sounding on to Satan.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  But when they act like the supplements, they go, those aren't FDA approved, are they?
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  Now, they know full well in 1996 law, the FDA has no jurisdiction over supplements.
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  And they tried to ban supplements in 1996, but Congress got a good law passed.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  Ron Paul was involved where they have no jurisdiction.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  You just can't advertise a supplement as a drug.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  Well, we're not comparing it to your poison drugs.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  Turmeric is from India. Well, that's where it was popularized thousands of years ago.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  And it's a natural plant derivative.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  And the curcuminoid is what is strong in it.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  It's great for inflammation, joints, anti-cancer, you name it.
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  And so we went to the top companies in the country and we said,
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  what's the strongest curcuminoid you got?
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  They said, well, the average is four to five percent.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  It has a great effect. It's just whole turmeric.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  But we can concentrate it naturally without heating it up to 75%.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  I said, does anybody put out 75%?
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  They said, yeah, some of these top of the line brands.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  But nobody goes above that.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  I said, how can you go? They go 94 to 95%.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  95% curcuminoid.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Any turmeric that's real turmeric is going to help you.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  This is, let me liken it to whiskey.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  A beer is 4%. That's normal turmeric.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  This is like moonshine. This is 200 proof, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  This is as strong as it gets.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  But not like having some of the bad health effects that whiskey can have.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  That's some good old effects too.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  But the point is, everything in moderation, that's the reality of this.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  So I'm glad your family had a great effect, Jeremiah.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  Oh, you know, if I could just kind of plug a few other outlets
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  other than just handing out the supplements to friends and people that I know,
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  which have 100% feedback phenomenal.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  I have not gotten any negative feedback of any of the stuff that I've provided
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  to anybody that was, you know, curious about trying to get better health.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  So as I mentioned earlier, you know, minorities,
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  we need more of the Asian community to come out and speak up.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  You know, honestly, in my opinion.
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  And then outside of that, if we can just plug in, you know,
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  Rumble and also Vaughn Live with the InfoBear, the InfoBear channel.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  That's where the community comes to help back you up as much as we can
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  to promote everything on the live stream.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  You know, whether it's Vaughn, Rumble or Twitch,
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  that's what we've been trying to do to help back you up, man.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  So you are definitely leading the charge.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  And I know that you're not the tip of the spear,
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  but man, we're definitely backing you up with the other prongs on that, man.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  So God bless you, man.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  Thank you for everything you do.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  Jeremiah, thank you.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  Thank you for what you do and say hi to your family for me.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  All right.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  If you hold callers, I'll get to you after I guess it's gone.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  I appreciate everybody being here.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  I got to a lot of calls the last two hours, but there's a lot more to get to.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  But we have Dr. Kelly Victory MD who's been on with this before,
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  and she's got incredible information dealing with the latest cover developments
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  and Biden and his cognitive disabilities and so much more.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  This lady is the tip of the spear.
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  She'll join us on the other side just a few minutes.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  Please stay with us.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  This is it.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  Give crypto fun info wars.
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  You're advertising for your cryptocurrency page.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  So I mean, I hope wherever the big whales are,
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  they'll give us money before we keep going.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep minting money as you're in this courtroom.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  All right, let's move on.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  And people care about the First Amendment.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:13.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  I'm going to talk about cryptocurrency because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  Yes.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  infowars.com.com.
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  Well, we're fighting the deep state.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  We need money.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  All right.
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  This is it.
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  Give crypto fun info wars.
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  No, it's just got so much fun.
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  Accounting.
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:15.640]  Don't listen to corporate media. Don't listen to the establishment. Don't listen to Republican
[2:07:15.640 --> 2:07:19.720]  Democrat leaders. Don't listen to think tanks. If you want to hear why they fear info wars.com,
[2:07:19.720 --> 2:07:25.720]  you want to hear why they fear Alex Jones, go to info wars.com and actually hear my show.
[2:07:25.720 --> 2:07:29.880]  Watch what we say. Watch what we do. See what we really say. And we're not going to defeat
[2:07:29.880 --> 2:07:35.320]  these people until we admit their evil. We admit it's going on and we organize against them and we
[2:07:35.320 --> 2:07:40.360]  stop them. This man is more hated by the media than Donald Trump and that says something. Okay.
[2:07:40.360 --> 2:07:44.520]  That's why they hate us is we're very, very popular populist. I have the number one book
[2:07:44.520 --> 2:07:49.480]  of the world, the Great Reset and the War for the World. It exposes Klaus Schwab. It exposes Bill
[2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:54.200]  Gates. It exposes the New World Order with their own quotes. Number one book of the world and liberals
[2:07:54.200 --> 2:07:58.280]  and conservatives and everybody you're buying it because they want to hear what they're not supposed
[2:07:58.280 --> 2:08:02.440]  to hear. Alex Jones had the biggest book in the country, but the New York Times lied about that
[2:08:02.440 --> 2:08:06.600]  because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that. Listen, you want to hear unfiltered,
[2:08:06.600 --> 2:08:10.680]  sometimes we're wrong, sometimes we're right. You want to hear unfiltered, real analysis
[2:08:10.680 --> 2:08:16.360]  from a wild man from Texas, from the Texas tornado. Go to info wars.com and the audio and video
[2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:23.000]  feeds and what we say are there. And I ask the public to judge me for yourself. Alex is right
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:29.320]  about far more things wrong. They're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:33.560]  But at the end of the day, if you want to know the truth, just research with yourself and come
[2:08:33.560 --> 2:08:39.160]  to info wars.com and see, see the forbidden information that you're not supposed to see
[2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:40.360]  at info wars.com.
[2:08:45.240 --> 2:08:48.200]  The COVID narrative is collapsing right now for our eyes.
[2:08:48.200 --> 2:08:55.880]  In Canada, in the United States, in Australia, in Europe, and the criminal investigations have begun.
[2:08:59.720 --> 2:09:05.880]  You're announcing that the government of Canada will not renew the order in council that expires
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:13.320]  on September the 30th and will therefore remove all COVID-19 border requirements for all travelers
[2:09:13.320 --> 2:09:20.520]  entering Canada. This includes the removal of all federal testing, quarantine and isolation
[2:09:20.520 --> 2:09:26.040]  requirements, as well as the mandatory submission of health information in a rice can.
[2:09:26.680 --> 2:09:31.640]  And now the criminal investigations are beginning in Congress and more.
[2:09:31.640 --> 2:09:35.720]  I'm Fauci and those responsible for creating and releasing the bio weapon.
[2:09:37.240 --> 2:09:42.760]  And then you've even taken the step for further defining that as calling for a special council.
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:47.320]  I wanted you to know if you could unpack that for us and explain what exactly the parameters
[2:09:47.320 --> 2:09:48.600]  of that special council would be.
[2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:54.520]  You know, there have been special councils in the past that are appointed by the president.
[2:09:54.520 --> 2:09:56.280]  There's a special council law.
[2:09:56.840 --> 2:10:00.280]  What I'm talking about is something that is similar but won't be the same thing.
[2:10:00.280 --> 2:10:02.600]  This won't be under a special law.
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:06.360]  This would simply be as the chairman of a committee with subpoena power.
[2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:11.640]  I will appoint someone who has the bandwidth, someone who's either been a former attorney
[2:10:11.640 --> 2:10:16.520]  general or assisted attorney general or somebody that had been in the Department of Justice at
[2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:20.440]  some time, somebody who's capable of leading a large investigation.
[2:10:21.080 --> 2:10:26.920]  And if I am in charge of the committee, we will have not only someone who's probably a lawyer,
[2:10:26.920 --> 2:10:32.440]  but I also envision having a special investigator that co-leads the investigation that'll be a
[2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:37.960]  scientist. Because I think what happens, and one of the reasons Dr. Fauci was successful in the
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:45.320]  beginning, is that as a person who came with a medical background, I think he can talk circles
[2:10:45.320 --> 2:10:47.960]  around people who aren't as familiar with the science.
[2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:52.360]  But there are a lot of scientists who have questions about particularly this gain of
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:57.320]  function research where they juice up these viruses and make them more infectious.
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:03.960]  There are many experts that have at least the credentials of a Dr. Fauci or some of them with
[2:11:03.960 --> 2:11:11.080]  much greater credentials who have been saying for years. There's at least one scientist who's
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:18.040]  been talking about this for 16 years before the pandemic, warning that this could come from a lab
[2:11:18.040 --> 2:11:23.960]  because of dangerous research. And we didn't. The public Congress didn't eat his warnings.
[2:11:23.960 --> 2:11:28.680]  And lo and behold, it's happened. And in a big way. And I think by the time we're done with the
[2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:33.480]  investigation, and by the time we present this to the public, I think people are going to go,
[2:11:33.480 --> 2:11:38.440]  holy cow, this thing came from a lab. Not just some of us are going to believe that.
[2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:44.200]  I think the majority of people will finally accept that the preponderance of evidence says
[2:11:44.200 --> 2:11:49.480]  that this came from a lab. Well, I think that so much of this comes and really.
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:57.640]  Dr. Kelly Victory, MD, alumni of National Apparatus Leadership Initiative of the
[2:11:57.640 --> 2:12:04.760]  Harvard School of Public Health and so much more joins us. And she was really exposing
[2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:09.320]  us the last two plus years. We're going to get it all the coming up. She also wants to get into
[2:12:09.880 --> 2:12:15.720]  Biden's clear dementia and as a medical doctor, what she's seeing unfolding. So Dr. Victory,
[2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:20.760]  great to have you here with us today. Thanks as always for having me, Alex. And I appreciate
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:27.480]  you taking the time to address this issue of Biden's worsening cognitive and physical decline
[2:12:27.480 --> 2:12:34.040]  people seem to be really scooting around the edges of this issue and not really getting
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:38.280]  into the weeds and exposing it to the American people. It's critically important. We're talking
[2:12:38.280 --> 2:12:44.200]  about the leader of the free world. So happy to talk about anything COVID related, but really
[2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:52.040]  appreciate the opportunity to talk about Biden situation. So we get into Biden first or the
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:58.760]  huge vaccine developments. Well, let's let's talk about Biden first. You know, let's let's talk
[2:12:58.760 --> 2:13:04.040]  about Biden only because and let me be clear, everything we're going to talk about everything
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:10.120]  I'm going to mention today, none of this is new. This was all readily apparent to anyone who is
[2:13:10.120 --> 2:13:17.400]  looking well before the 2020 election. The only thing that has changed is that it has worsened.
[2:13:17.400 --> 2:13:24.760]  I actually lost a number of steak dinners because I had predicted that if Biden got elected that
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:31.640]  he wouldn't make it until July 1 of his first year in office. I was wrong. But what I was wrong
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:39.640]  about wasn't about the severity of his decline. I simply misunderstood or underestimated the
[2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:47.160]  complicity of the Democrat Party of the mainstream media of the powers that be to rally around and
[2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:53.640]  protect him and to try to keep this covered up. It's not because it wasn't I wasn't correct about
[2:13:53.640 --> 2:13:59.560]  what's going on with him. I agree. I mean, I would liken this to the Manhattan project
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:04.440]  of gaslighting. He doesn't know where he is. It's almost all incoherent. My grandmother died a few
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:10.280]  years ago at 92. She was more coherent two days before she died when I visited her than he is now.
[2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:19.480]  I mean, why are they trying to prop him up? Well, truly, number one, look at the second in
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:27.400]  command. Look at who's to follow. I think Kamala Harris is his greatest protector right now because
[2:14:27.400 --> 2:14:34.040]  people think it is bad enough to have somebody demented in the office, but having her could
[2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:42.120]  be considerably worse. Now, I have not examined President Biden, but I can tell you he is every
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:49.080]  outward sign of Parkinsonian dementia, the physical signs and the cognitive signs. We can go through
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:55.640]  them. He's got the telltale signs of the shuffling gate. He has trouble changing direction when he
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:15:01.080]  starts forward motion and you'll commonly see someone taken by the elbow and literally turn
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:08.040]  him physically. He's got the stiff kind of tin soldier arms. He has a loss of facial expression,
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:13.720]  what we call flat faces. Makes it look sometimes like he's gotten a little too much Botox, but I
[2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:20.520]  can guarantee that's not the case. This is part of Parkinsonian dementia. He has trouble wordfinding.
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:26.840]  He frequently loses his place on the teleprompter. He loses his train of thought. Hold on, Dr. I got
[2:15:26.840 --> 2:15:31.800]  to you late playing those clips and I promise to apologize. Stay there. Start over because I
[2:15:31.800 --> 2:15:35.080]  hadn't seen the new clips that came this morning. They were just playing them while you were talking.
[2:15:35.080 --> 2:15:42.040]  Radio listeners couldn't see it. He literally does not know what planet he's on now. It's obviously
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:47.160]  accelerating in his degeneration. Statistically, medically, how is this going to end? What's
[2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:52.760]  the timeline? We'll be right back with Dr. Kelly Victory MD. Be sure to visit her website and on
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:16:00.600]  Twitter, Kelly Victory MD on Getter. It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year

[2:16:57.080 --> 2:17:02.120]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans. They financed major
[2:17:02.120 --> 2:17:07.800]  universities. They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of
[2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:13.720]  New York Times, other major newspapers that the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be
[2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:20.040]  ended. And the first step in that is getting women out of the household teaching women that cooking
[2:17:20.040 --> 2:17:24.840]  dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing. And I was just sitting
[2:17:24.840 --> 2:17:29.400]  here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter, my wife makes dinner a
[2:17:29.400 --> 2:17:33.800]  lot of times. But I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast. And literally it's the
[2:17:33.800 --> 2:17:39.240]  funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative and then all sit down
[2:17:39.240 --> 2:17:45.160]  together and have the communal event. And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is
[2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:51.400]  our normal biological actions and coming together. They really are sick, evil scientific cult of
[2:17:51.400 --> 2:17:57.080]  filth and domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue. Ladies and
[2:17:57.080 --> 2:18:01.560]  gentlemen, if millions of people get this book, our funding problems will be over and it's starting
[2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:05.560]  to happen. That's why I said, yeah, go to infowarstore.com, get the book and start shipping in a couple
[2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:09.560]  weeks. The great reset in the war for the world. But I said, go to Amazon because it's the number
[2:18:09.560 --> 2:18:14.760]  one book chart in the world. And if it goes to number one, not a political, not of history,
[2:18:14.760 --> 2:18:19.080]  not of US history. It's already number one over 40 categories like political science,
[2:18:19.080 --> 2:18:25.960]  you name it. 40 plus categories is number one. Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll please of books
[2:18:25.960 --> 2:18:35.000]  in the world. The great reset in the war for the world is 123456789. We are now number nine
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:41.960]  in the world. This is major. This is political. This could fund our war chest. Just go to
[2:18:41.960 --> 2:18:48.680]  amazon.com everybody and buy 10 copies. Send this blueprint to the death star and the new world
[2:18:48.680 --> 2:18:52.040]  order because you read this, you know their whole plan how to stop them, get the great reset in
[2:18:52.040 --> 2:18:54.840]  the war for the world. Now it's going to go to number one. What do you make of that?

[2:20:02.840 --> 2:20:14.840]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:14.840 --> 2:20:37.400]  Open borders, devalued currency, drag queen pedophile story time, war with Russia, devalued
[2:20:38.280 --> 2:20:42.600]  culture. They're shaking us up. They're demoralizing us. They're trying to break our will.
[2:20:42.600 --> 2:20:46.040]  They admit they are and so they put in a president they know is controllable
[2:20:46.040 --> 2:20:51.400]  and is a puppet, but his expiration date was up. So he's generating in my view faster than they
[2:20:51.400 --> 2:20:57.240]  thought medical doctor Kelly victory is here. She's not diagnosing him with dementia from afar,
[2:20:57.240 --> 2:21:02.120]  but I don't have to be a doctor that if I'm looking out my window at a highway and a homeless
[2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:06.040]  person walks out in front of a truck, I saw this happen years ago and gets run over and killed. I
[2:21:06.040 --> 2:21:11.320]  see him run over and fly into the air. That person's probably dead. Don't need to be a pathologist.
[2:21:11.320 --> 2:21:16.040]  You know, to know that part or coroner to know that person just got run over by car.
[2:21:16.040 --> 2:21:22.120]  So we see him a year ago falling down Air Force one. He looked, it looks like he's an NFL linebacker
[2:21:22.120 --> 2:21:26.680]  or running back compared to the way he looks in the new flows of things that are you saying. So
[2:21:27.240 --> 2:21:31.800]  start over with what you're witnessing, what you're seeing and the classical thing we're
[2:21:31.800 --> 2:21:36.840]  witnessing and where this trajectory or timeline ends. Dr. Kelly victory MD.
[2:21:36.840 --> 2:21:45.560]  Sure. Let me first give a quick rundown of the sorts of physical signs and symptoms that I'm
[2:21:45.560 --> 2:21:51.880]  seeing. And again, you know, one swallow doesn't make a summer as the saying goes. It's a constellation
[2:21:51.880 --> 2:21:58.600]  of all of these signs taken together, Alex. This is second year medical student stuff. So I didn't
[2:21:58.600 --> 2:22:05.160]  need to examine him. I couldn't see with my own eyes. He has the shuffling gate. As I said, difficulty
[2:22:05.160 --> 2:22:12.360]  changing direction once he starts forward motion. He is stiff, what we call tin soldier arms. He has
[2:22:12.360 --> 2:22:17.960]  that somewhat, you know, leaning forward. He's leaning forward normally than one would as he
[2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:24.760]  walks. When he walks, he doesn't hit his heel first. He hits flat footed. He has loss of facial
[2:22:24.760 --> 2:22:31.080]  expression, what we call flat faces. Then when you look at the cognitive things, he has trouble
[2:22:31.080 --> 2:22:37.240]  with word finding. He frequently loses his place when he's reading on the teleprompter. He forgets
[2:22:37.240 --> 2:22:44.280]  his train of thought. And interestingly, he has those angry inappropriate outbursts that we call
[2:22:44.280 --> 2:22:51.800]  frontal lobe behavior who can forget back in 2020 when he referred to a girl at a town hall as a
[2:22:51.800 --> 2:22:58.360]  lying dog faced pony soldier or where he told an auto worker to shut up. These are frontal lobe
[2:22:58.360 --> 2:23:04.280]  behaviors, behaviors that are impulsive and would normally be controlled by somebody who wasn't
[2:23:04.280 --> 2:23:11.640]  suffering from dementia. The problem with these neurocognitive disorders from which he is suffering
[2:23:11.640 --> 2:23:18.200]  is that they are progressive. There is no cure. They are not linear, unfortunately. So there's no
[2:23:18.200 --> 2:23:25.560]  way to say with certainty how quickly he will fall off the proverbial cliff. But clearly we are seeing
[2:23:25.560 --> 2:23:32.280]  significant worsening over the past couple of years. And the only reason that he's functioning at all
[2:23:32.280 --> 2:23:37.880]  in my estimation is because they are very, very tightly controlling his schedule.
[2:23:38.600 --> 2:23:45.080]  You'll notice that he rarely makes an appearance after about two or three in the afternoon. That's
[2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:51.160]  because people with this type of neurocognitive decline suffer from what we call sundowning
[2:23:51.160 --> 2:23:57.800]  while they may be relatively coherent and cogent early in the day. As the day gets later, early
[2:23:57.800 --> 2:24:03.880]  afternoon, they start to get more and more agitated, more and more confused. Oh, I saw this with three
[2:24:03.880 --> 2:24:08.360]  of my grandparents that they'd be somewhat normal when they got Alzheimer's or old during the day.
[2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:13.000]  But if you showed up at night to help them, they didn't know who they were. Yes, exactly. And that's
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  why I suspect that he rarely is ventures out of a house after about two or three in the afternoon.
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:26.680]  I've also noticed he's spending something like 60% of his time hidden on vacation. I mean,
[2:24:26.680 --> 2:24:31.400]  an unannounced, he just disappears. Is that when he has a full collapse of basically
[2:24:32.120 --> 2:24:37.080]  he's no good to them? They got to hide him? Exactly. And if there's any disruption of the
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:42.920]  schedule, and what's so alarming to me and scary to me, Alex, for the leader of the free world,
[2:24:42.920 --> 2:24:48.840]  is you can kind of keep it together with these folks as long as breakfast is exactly on time
[2:24:48.840 --> 2:24:54.680]  and lunch is on time and then nap is on time and we do everything in a routine, kind of like a newborn
[2:24:54.680 --> 2:25:00.680]  baby. But as soon as you disrupt that, if you have to take a phone call at three o'clock in the morning,
[2:25:00.680 --> 2:25:06.440]  if you have to get on Air Force One and travel over multiple time zones, if you have to miss a meal
[2:25:06.440 --> 2:25:13.640]  or have disruption in your normal routine, that is when things get really bad. People get agitated
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:20.280]  and confused and totally lose their ability to function. And so it's one thing if you can
[2:25:20.280 --> 2:25:27.160]  absolutely control this person's day, their schedule seven days a week with no variation.
[2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:31.640]  But that's not right. Even men and women in great shape as prime ministers or presidents have
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:36.600]  problem in age rapidly. So looking at this, what you're saying is the guy that has the nuclear
[2:25:36.600 --> 2:25:41.800]  football doesn't know what planet he's on. Yeah, I think he probably doesn't know which
[2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:48.520]  end of the fork to use most of the time. And unfortunately, the people who care about him
[2:25:48.520 --> 2:25:55.080]  for his own dignity, for his own, I mean, this is, it's embarrassing. Not only does it put us
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:26:03.160]  at risk from a national security perspective, but truly it is, it's demeaning to him, the people
[2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:10.520]  around him who care about him. Where is Dr. Jill right about now? It is just abhorrent that they
[2:26:10.520 --> 2:26:16.600]  would allow this to go on, allow him to embarrass himself to be clearly like a little lost puppy
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:23.320]  on the stage. No idea which way to go. Doesn't know he'll even articulate sometimes. What was I
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:28.760]  doing here? What was I supposed to say? Who was I supposed to call on? Yeah, he doesn't do that.
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:33.240]  Sometimes he does that almost every public appearance. He suddenly slips out of gear. It
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:37.240]  doesn't know where he is. So it's hard to put a date on when he goes over the edge,
[2:26:37.240 --> 2:26:41.400]  but it looks to me like he's already pretty much gone over it. On average, Dr, you're an MD,
[2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:45.480]  you study these things. If he's accelerating his decline, how long can he hold on?
[2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:51.400]  Well, again, it depends, Alex, on how long they're willing to cover for him. As I said,
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:58.120]  all of these things were glaringly evident before the 2020 election. That's why I made the
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:06.200]  steak dinner bets that I did. The dogface pony soldier episode was in February of 2020.
[2:27:06.200 --> 2:27:12.760]  He had the shuffling gate and the flat facial expression and the tin soldier arms back then.
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:18.040]  So it really is all going to be based on how long they're willing to cover for him.
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:22.120]  Whether or not somebody is going to go down the road of saying,
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:28.920]  we need to enact the 25th Amendment. If the people around him continue to cover for him,
[2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:33.480]  they continue to hide him in the basement. They continue to limit his activities.
[2:27:33.480 --> 2:27:38.200]  We've, you know, I have known house cats that had busier schedules than this president.
[2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:43.960]  So as long as they're willing to do that, then who knows if he can make it through the first term.
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:51.160]  God help us. I can't imagine that he will choose to run a second term. I think by that point,
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:57.640]  the gig will be up. But I think as long as Kamala Harris is the person waiting in the wings,
[2:27:57.640 --> 2:28:00.360]  they have a lot of motivation to keep covering for him.
[2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:03.480]  Well, I mean, we're going to break, come back and talk more about this. There couldn't be a
[2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:07.080]  more important issue. The leader of the free world stole the election as a puppet, but
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:12.360]  I'm not a medical doctor. I'm not a physiologist. I'm not a pathologist. So all I know is
[2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:17.640]  the Joe Biden even two years ago was light years better than this. The decline is accelerating.
[2:28:17.640 --> 2:28:24.600]  I don't think anybody can deny that. No, I think that's absolutely the case. And as I said,
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:32.360]  it gives me no great joy. Dementia is a brutal master, Alex. It's awful. It's awful for the
[2:28:32.360 --> 2:28:39.720]  individual and it's awful for the people around him. So I feel very badly for him as an individual,
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:45.640]  as a person, as a human being, because dementia is terrible. And these types of cognitive
[2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:50.280]  declines and neurocognitive disorders are very, very painful.
[2:28:50.280 --> 2:28:54.600]  All right, Dr. Kelly, victory. Stay there, please. We'll come back and talk about this more.
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:01.240]  Info wars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right now.
[2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:08.040]  And today is do or die time. If info wars gets the funding into the midterms in the next year,
[2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:10.760]  we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever. But if we don't,
[2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:16.280]  I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main
[2:29:16.280 --> 2:29:22.840]  operations. I've done my work. I've put everything into it. I'm leaving it on the field, but I believe
[2:29:22.840 --> 2:29:27.480]  at a gut level, you're going to come through plus you're going to get great products that your
[2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:32.680]  family already need. So don't procrastinate. Show info wars. You want to sustain on the air.
[2:29:32.680 --> 2:29:37.720]  Go to info wars store.com where we got three great products back in stock, vitamin C and zinc,
[2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:43.320]  highest quality, super strong back in stock, vitamin D three and calcium. And of course,
[2:29:43.320 --> 2:29:50.200]  DNA force plus, all these products are 50% off together in a combo pack or 40% off individually.
[2:29:50.200 --> 2:29:54.040]  So the great products you already need for your immune system and we need the money to stay on
[2:29:54.040 --> 2:29:58.440]  air. So please take action now. Thank you. Donald Trump and the night Republicans
[2:29:59.160 --> 2:30:05.560]  represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic. I wouldn't be surprised
[2:30:05.560 --> 2:30:12.120]  if this doesn't have an operational name. In fact, I bet it does. I bet it's called Operation
[2:30:12.120 --> 2:30:19.720]  Matador. They see us as the bull and they are shaky, a red flag in our face. And the Matador is
[2:30:19.720 --> 2:30:26.200]  the deep state with a long skinny razor sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward,
[2:30:26.200 --> 2:30:31.880]  the Matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape,
[2:30:31.880 --> 2:30:36.680]  as the bull varies himself into the dust. They've got the ace of spades in their hand,
[2:30:36.680 --> 2:30:41.720]  which is false flags. Before you launch a war, you stage false flags. That's the first thing you
[2:30:41.720 --> 2:30:47.000]  do because nobody wants to say they started a war. Bad guys start wars. So every time a war
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:52.360]  gets launched by bad guys, they stage an event. This is Operation Matador.
[2:30:56.200 --> 2:31:03.880]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[2:31:03.880 --> 2:31:09.480]  and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant,
[2:31:09.480 --> 2:31:14.360]  and to defend our immune systems. Now, over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product
[2:31:14.360 --> 2:31:19.720]  that was top sourced, top the line as good as it's going to get, but then the supply chain
[2:31:19.720 --> 2:31:25.080]  broke down and it was sold out for more than a year. Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old
[2:31:25.080 --> 2:31:32.280]  bottle jam packed is back in stock for a limited time at infowarstore.com, 30% off. This limited
[2:31:32.280 --> 2:31:38.440]  time left time to go into all the great things it does or what it has inside, but go to infowarstore.com
[2:31:38.440 --> 2:31:43.160]  and look up green fiber capsules for yourself and see how amazing it is. And what's just as
[2:31:43.160 --> 2:31:48.600]  amazing is it funds the info war and keeps us on air. We're all under globalist attack. They don't
[2:31:48.600 --> 2:31:53.800]  want you to have these essential nutrients that are in this product. Get yours today at 25% off
[2:31:53.800 --> 2:32:00.440]  at infowarstore.com now back in stock. The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with
[2:32:00.440 --> 2:32:06.200]  spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out and they're
[2:32:06.200 --> 2:32:11.240]  doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the Creator and we
[2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:17.800]  are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet
[2:32:17.800 --> 2:32:25.400]  saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true? The propaganda would not be
[2:32:25.400 --> 2:32:31.880]  necessary if the situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all
[2:32:31.880 --> 2:32:38.920]  their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end
[2:32:38.920 --> 2:32:43.480]  they signed on to the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that
[2:32:43.480 --> 2:32:47.560]  everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever because even if you don't believe in God,
[2:32:48.120 --> 2:32:52.920]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling and we are opposing the
[2:32:52.920 --> 2:32:55.640]  one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[2:32:55.640 --> 2:33:04.280]  All right, leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:04.280 --> 2:33:31.880]  But guess what? We got a lot to do. Gotta say hi to me.
[2:33:34.360 --> 2:33:38.680]  We go back a long way. He was 12, I was 30, but anyway,
[2:33:38.680 --> 2:34:06.280]  this woman helped me get an awful lot done anyway.
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:37.800]  So the real question is who really is the president?
[2:34:37.800 --> 2:34:42.680]  That makes me think of the mutant. I'll say that mainly is a mutant. Fetterman
[2:34:44.200 --> 2:34:50.600]  running for Senate in Pennsylvania who can't talk either. So maybe this is by design or something.
[2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:56.920]  Dr. Kelly Victory MD is doing a great job analyzing this for us. I've been interrupting
[2:34:56.920 --> 2:35:01.480]  a lot and I apologize. So you've got the floor. What does this signify and where do you see this
[2:35:01.480 --> 2:35:07.240]  going? Well, if you remember nothing else about what I'm talking about with regard to
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:14.760]  the cognitive decline of President Biden, it's that it is progressive and it is nonlinear. Neuro
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:22.280]  cognitive decline, neuro cognitive diseases of this sort don't have a cure. They may be giving
[2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:27.720]  him medication to try to address some of the signs and symptoms. You can try to treat the
[2:35:27.720 --> 2:35:33.880]  physical rigidity, for example, the rigidity of the arms and legs and his balance issues. You
[2:35:33.880 --> 2:35:39.560]  can try to increase the amount of dopamine that he has in his brain so that you will enhance his
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:46.200]  ability to keep a train of thought. But there's no cure for it, Alex. It's progressive and nonlinear.
[2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:51.480]  And the problem is what that means is we don't know if tomorrow will be the day that he finally
[2:35:51.480 --> 2:35:56.920]  can't put two words together, can't get out of bed, becomes incontinent, has angry outbursts in
[2:35:56.920 --> 2:36:02.440]  public or whatever else. So let me interrupt you. I talked to people in the Secret Service
[2:36:02.440 --> 2:36:08.280]  separately who confirmed a year ago, he was in New York on the last 9-11 anniversary,
[2:36:08.280 --> 2:36:13.160]  pooping himself repeatedly. And then he came out and said, yeah, I get my butt wiped to the
[2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:21.480]  TV cameras. Remember that? Yeah, unfortunately, incontinence is one of the many side effects
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:27.240]  of these types of neuro cognitive decline. And there are medications you can use to try to
[2:36:27.240 --> 2:36:33.720]  temporize it. But the reality is it's going to get worse. And when you're talking again about the
[2:36:33.720 --> 2:36:39.880]  leader of the free world, what happens when he calls, you know, Kim Jong-un or somebody else,
[2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:46.440]  you know, a lying pony soldier, you know, or says some kind of an angry outburst. I mean,
[2:36:46.440 --> 2:36:51.240]  these things, really, he shouldn't be put in that position. And there's no... And he's also
[2:36:51.240 --> 2:36:57.880]  contradicting official US policy. Like on Taiwan, this is extremely dangerous.
[2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:04.360]  Absolutely, absolutely. And frankly, I think he's handed his talking points. He says,
[2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:09.960]  much as tells us so at every single, you know, meeting that he has, he says, I'm only supposed
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:13.880]  to call on these people and my, you know, my handlers are going to be mad at me. I don't want
[2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:19.240]  to get in trouble. I don't want to get in trouble. But, you know, he's not making his own decisions
[2:37:19.240 --> 2:37:23.640]  on these things. You know, he probably gets his same talking points in the morning.
[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:29.080]  So on the outside, because I agree, I bet he couldn't go this long, but they don't care. They're
[2:37:29.080 --> 2:37:33.880]  shameless. You didn't lose the bet. I didn't lose the bet. He's a total disgrace and a joke. It's
[2:37:33.880 --> 2:37:39.720]  very sad. But on the outside, could he go six months a year? I mean, the decline has accelerated.
[2:37:39.720 --> 2:37:43.960]  I mean, I guess if they roll him out like Boris Yeltsin gibbering in a wheelchair,
[2:37:43.960 --> 2:37:48.200]  I guess he could probably win the election in two years. They'll just have a vegetable or a
[2:37:48.200 --> 2:37:52.200]  brain and a tank. They claim as the president. And then the question is, who really is the president?
[2:37:53.480 --> 2:37:58.520]  Well, there's no, again, there's no way to predict because of the nonlinear nature of these
[2:37:58.520 --> 2:38:05.320]  disorders. He may continue to percolate along just as he is right now, you know, for the next six
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:11.240]  months or nine months or 12 months. It's unlikely, but he could. What I can tell you won't happen,
[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:17.320]  is it won't get better. It will not start to abate. It will stay where it is and slowly and
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:22.520]  progressively get worse. But there will come a time when he just kind of falls off the proverbial
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:28.920]  cliff and we don't know when that is. So it's never in the best position to be making those
[2:38:28.920 --> 2:38:34.840]  choices and those changes as a country in a time of crisis. We should have been doing this in a
[2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:42.520]  thoughtful way with a transition plan in place for someone who is clearly suffering. He is both,
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:47.800]  as I said, both the cognitive and the physical components of it. The cognitive being far more
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:52.840]  concerning. Although we can laugh about him, you know, if he's stumbling on the steps or make fun
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:57.640]  of the fact that he falls off a cliff. Is this early onset dementia? Is it early mid or late?
[2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:04.360]  I'd say we're relatively advanced. He has every sign. As I said, we're relatively advanced. This
[2:39:04.360 --> 2:39:10.360]  isn't just a little trouble, word finding or losing your ability to track on the teleprompter.
[2:39:10.360 --> 2:39:17.400]  He forgets where he is mid event right there. You're watching him right there. He doesn't
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:23.080]  know what he's supposed to do. And this isn't the first episode of that. He is a lost, you know,
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:29.800]  little puppy right now on that stage. But doctor, what does this say about his controllers
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:33.240]  that they let this far as continuous? You said this is ridiculous.
[2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:40.920]  Exactly. As I said, it's an embarrassment to him. It's really demeaning to him and it's dangerous
[2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:47.640]  for us as a country. I think that frankly, both his handlers and frankly, the Republicans need
[2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:54.360]  to step up and say, for the love of God, we have got to stop trying to cover this up. We've got to
[2:39:54.360 --> 2:40:00.760]  stop trying. Exactly. Democrats want to be able to blame him for their agenda as a puppet. Republicans
[2:40:00.760 --> 2:40:04.680]  love it that he's an idiot. It makes them get votes. If we have nuclear war, that doesn't
[2:40:04.680 --> 2:40:11.000]  matter. We cannot have a potato as the president. Correct. Correct. And frankly, to bring us back
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:17.320]  around to the COVID situation, because he's constantly contradicting what the talking heads
[2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:23.640]  are saying is constantly contradicting everybody from Fauci to Wolensky and everybody else,
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:29.400]  it continues to confuse the American public. It continues to undermine people's confidence in
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:35.160]  public health and it isn't good for anybody. So whether it's foreign affairs we're talking about,
[2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:41.880]  national security we're talking about, or the issues regarding COVID and the pandemic on our own
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:47.640]  soil, it's very, very disruptive. All right. I want to hit that next segment, but let me interrupt
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:52.040]  you because everybody even took Carlson brought this up and said, what is the giant, looks like
[2:40:52.040 --> 2:40:59.160]  a five pound tumor on the back of Federman's neck? Federman can barely talk now. The media
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:04.680]  is trying to cover that up. Just looking at a giant bulge on the back of his neck, I know you're
[2:41:04.680 --> 2:41:11.400]  not diagnosed from afar, but had a big stroke. Is that some type of tumor or what's going on here?
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:17.560]  Well, again, as he's pointed out, I have not examined Federman and I haven't put my hand on
[2:41:17.560 --> 2:41:23.400]  that. The two things that jumped to mind right off the bat, number one is completely benign,
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:29.880]  would be a large fatty tumor or kind of a lipoma in that area, that there's nothing much other
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:35.640]  than the fact that it's unsightly, doesn't mean much from a physical perspective. The more concerning
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:41.640]  thing to me and another possibility is that it actually represents a lymphoma. You have a lot
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:46.120]  of lymph nodes in the back of your neck. There are two huge chains of lymph nodes that go down the
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:53.160]  back of the neck. And if he has a lymph node involvement from, for example, lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's
[2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:59.160]  lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, that could present and look very much like that. Again, not saying
[2:41:59.160 --> 2:42:04.920]  that's what it is. Haven't examined him, know nothing about his medical history. Other than
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:10.760]  that, he's relatively young, dev had a stroke recently. He clearly isn't doing well physically.
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:17.480]  To listen to him talk, you recognize that he is suffering from something, but this mass on the
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:23.240]  back of his neck could be something as benign as a large lipoma or something far more significant,
[2:42:24.040 --> 2:42:27.400]  like lymph adenopathy related to something like a lymphoma.
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:33.160]  Why are they running all these zombies for our office?
[2:42:33.160 --> 2:42:41.720]  I'll tell you, if this is the best we can do, 330 million people and these are our best choices.
[2:42:42.760 --> 2:42:49.080]  Perhaps it's because nobody wants to work their salt, wants to go into politics anymore,
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:53.880]  because it's such an ugly place and with the amount of censorship and derision and
[2:42:53.880 --> 2:42:56.360]  cancel culture. Stay there, doctor. Gotta go to break.
[2:42:57.480 --> 2:43:02.280]  The best-selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and The War for the World,
[2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:08.520]  written by Alex Jones. Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week,
[2:43:08.520 --> 2:43:11.720]  but the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:16.520]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:20.760]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:25.960]  people killed. So they lied about his book. The Great Reset and The War for the World,
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:32.520]  the historic book that lays out the plans of The Great Reset Death Star and exposes
[2:43:32.520 --> 2:43:40.840]  the New World Order's plans for global enslavement. Get your copy now at amazon.com to keep the book

[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:04.600]  sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come.
[2:44:04.600 --> 2:44:12.040]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic. Stay calm because now is the time
[2:44:12.040 --> 2:44:18.120]  that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing
[2:44:18.120 --> 2:44:25.320]  stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own society. All we got to do
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:32.280]  is survive the crash. And right now, we still have time to prepare. The world fiat currency system
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:38.840]  is racing towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food,

[2:46:55.800 --> 2:47:04.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:53.560]  Three years ago, two and a half years ago, I was amongst 12 people become the most man on the
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:48:00.440]  internet, including Lewis Farrakhan and Paul Watson and Gavin McGinnis. And they said, because I
[2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:04.920]  questioned his cognitive ability and believed he'd had some type of aneurysm or something because he
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:10.200]  suddenly got a lot worse about two and a half years ago, they said, Jones is the most banned,
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:16.280]  there is. Well, I mean, you can see it then. So Dr. Kelly Victory, everybody should check out your
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:25.240]  getter all your work early covidcare.org at Kelly Victory MD on getter. I want to hit the victory
[2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:29.080]  lap here, which is a sad victory lap we've been vindicated on the covid shots and more here in
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:35.000]  the moment, the time we have left, but just finishing up here. This is outrageous what's
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  going on with Biden and it just shows the wildness of the establishment to try to do something like
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:46.680]  this. And I don't see how they extricate themselves. As you said, with Kamala Harris in there, I mean,
[2:48:46.680 --> 2:48:54.920]  there's no way he makes it no way he makes it on the trajectory he's on another another two years
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:59.800]  into the general election. What do you think is going to happen? No, no, I agree with you. And as I
[2:48:59.800 --> 2:49:06.120]  was saying before the break, although the physical signs are very obvious to people, the way that
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:11.960]  he walks, the fact that he stumbles frequently, falls off a bike, those things are far less
[2:49:11.960 --> 2:49:17.080]  concerning to me. Let's face it, we had a president very effective one in a wheelchair. We have
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:22.680]  sitting governors that are in a wheelchair. You don't need to be physically sound necessarily
[2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:27.800]  to be a good leader. But you sure as heck better have your faculties about you cognitively. And
[2:49:27.800 --> 2:49:35.400]  he doesn't. And this is only going to get worse. And it will get profoundly worse if his schedule
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:41.400]  is disrupted or if we have a national disaster, a crisis of any sort. Can you imagine if we had
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:47.720]  nine 11 and this was the president at the helm? So they're going to have to do something in my
[2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:52.680]  estimation, Alex, either he's going to become a complete and total figurehead and we won't see
[2:49:52.680 --> 2:49:58.200]  him at all. He will just quote lead from his basement and will have them just march out a
[2:49:58.200 --> 2:50:04.360]  series of people to give his talking points. Or they're going to have to enact the 25th Amendment
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:10.840]  if he won't step down on his own. I suspect that he will clearly make the choice not to run again
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:19.080]  in 2024, citing likely his age and the fact that he's having some health issues. But what happens
[2:50:19.080 --> 2:50:25.080]  between now and then is unclear. If it were anybody other than Kamala Harris sitting in the VP
[2:50:25.080 --> 2:50:31.480]  position, we might have already had resolution to this disaster. She ended up being his greatest
[2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:37.880]  protector to keep him ensconced in the White House. So it remains to be seen, but it isn't going to be
[2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:42.040]  pretty. That's right. You wouldn't have somebody drive a school bus that had dementia or be a doctor
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:48.920]  or be an auto mechanic or run draw bridges. But we have this clear puppet in there. So I go back
[2:50:48.920 --> 2:50:54.120]  to the big question. Who is really the president right now? Who's really making the decisions?
[2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:58.680]  Because obviously Biden says, tell me what to do. I don't know where I am. Help me. I mean,
[2:50:58.680 --> 2:51:03.560]  this is a coup. It's a coup by bureaucracy having a vegetable as the president.
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:09.480]  Yeah. And you're in as good a position to make that prediction as I am. I'm thinking it's probably
[2:51:09.480 --> 2:51:17.400]  a combination of Valerie Jarrett and Susan Rice and God only knows who else is there making these
[2:51:17.400 --> 2:51:26.040]  decisions. Exactly. Obama functionaries. It's not Joe Biden. So Obama is really getting his
[2:51:26.040 --> 2:51:33.480]  third term right now. Yeah. Unfortunately, I think through his minions, absolutely that that's
[2:51:33.480 --> 2:51:41.000]  the case. Clearly, as it is in Biden, he does not come up with an original thought. He really does
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:45.720]  it. He goes purely off the talking points that he's handed. And that's why they use the cane and
[2:51:45.720 --> 2:51:51.640]  they grab them off the stage as quickly as possible. Because I think their greatest fear is that he
[2:51:51.640 --> 2:51:58.280]  will go rogue, that all of a sudden he'll start speaking extemporaneously either cogently or
[2:51:58.280 --> 2:52:05.320]  otherwise and spill the beans. So yeah, he clearly is being controlled. And when we've called other
[2:52:05.320 --> 2:52:12.520]  people puppets in the past, this has taken it to a new level. This is he is a puppet. That's
[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:19.720]  on steroids because he simply doesn't have the cognitive ability to make these decisions or
[2:52:19.720 --> 2:52:27.240]  to come up with an assessment. So is it fair to say we have a near vegetable puppet as the president
[2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:35.560]  right now? Unfortunately, I fear that that's the case. And this is as obvious well before the
[2:52:35.560 --> 2:52:41.320]  election ever took place. I predicted this. I look at this video that you're showing now. It's
[2:52:41.320 --> 2:52:48.600]  painful. You know, he is absolutely lost. He's confused. He doesn't know which way to turn.
[2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:53.480]  This is a horrible, these are horrible optics for our country. And there's no better video to show
[2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:59.400]  that Obama is enjoying his third presidency as they're all ignoring Biden while he just wanders
[2:52:59.400 --> 2:53:06.920]  around like a two year old. Right, exactly. And they're over, you know, fawning on Obama and
[2:53:06.920 --> 2:53:13.800]  no one's paying attention to the fact that that the president, the sitting president is dazed and
[2:53:13.800 --> 2:53:22.440]  confused. Shifting gears here. I mean, look, this is the same thing that happened two weeks ago where
[2:53:22.440 --> 2:53:26.440]  he wandered off from Obama and everybody was around Obama. And then Biden comes up and grabs him
[2:53:26.440 --> 2:53:31.240]  desperately. I mean, this is just flailing. We don't want to do a victory lap. We're very sad.
[2:53:31.240 --> 2:53:36.520]  They launched the shot. It didn't work. It was poisonous. But Europe suffers horrifying 75%
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:42.680]  increase and excess deaths among children since EMA approved coming back for kids info wars.com.
[2:53:42.680 --> 2:53:49.960]  And it links to mainline studies. And it continues there where they are now admitting with all these
[2:53:49.960 --> 2:53:59.080]  scientists and all these researchers dealing with COVID-19 that suspend all COVID-19 mRNA vaccines
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:04.600]  until side effects are fully investigated, says leading doctor who promised them on TV who promoted
[2:54:04.600 --> 2:54:09.640]  them. Here's a bunch of other ones dealing with this. Rand Paul calls for criminal investigation.
[2:54:09.640 --> 2:54:15.320]  Canada suspends all forced injections. FDA vaccine advisor says healthy
[2:54:15.960 --> 2:54:20.680]  young people should not take the shot. New York suspends forced injections.
[2:54:20.680 --> 2:54:26.040]  They are running away from this now. What do you make of the CDC had a month ago saying, oh,
[2:54:26.840 --> 2:54:31.160]  we were wrong. We lied to you. We knew it wouldn't work. I mean, what are they doing here?
[2:54:32.760 --> 2:54:36.440]  Well, first of all, unfortunately, they aren't doing the one thing they should be doing, Alex,
[2:54:36.440 --> 2:54:41.240]  which is pulling these immediately from the market. I am not anti vaccine,
[2:54:41.240 --> 2:54:46.280]  but I have had grave concerns about these particular vaccines since before they were
[2:54:46.280 --> 2:54:51.880]  launched on the public. They are untested. They use brand new technology. They have a
[2:54:51.880 --> 2:54:57.960]  possibility of safety data behind them. And it was very clear within weeks of them being rolled out
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:55:04.600]  that there were devastating adverse events. The data are irrefutable. You are far more
[2:55:04.600 --> 2:55:10.520]  likely to suffer a severe adverse event from these vaccines than to be prevented from getting
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:16.440]  hospitalized with COVID. We've known from the very beginning that the vast majority of people
[2:55:16.440 --> 2:55:22.440]  are at a relatively low risk from COVID. And that was back when we had the original Wuhan strain.
[2:55:22.440 --> 2:55:28.680]  Healthy young people have such a low risk of such a de minimis risk of having a severe outcome
[2:55:28.680 --> 2:55:35.720]  as to be essentially indistinguishable from zero. The data now that we have, based on only because
[2:55:35.720 --> 2:55:42.440]  of the aggressive FOIA request, we have access to Pfizer and Moderna's own safety data prior to
[2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:49.800]  the rollout. And it clearly shows that for every one hospitalization from COVID that was avoided,
[2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:58.840]  there were 4.3 serious adverse events. And those are defined as death, near death, hospitalization,
[2:55:58.840 --> 2:56:06.200]  or permanent disability. When you parse that same data to look at the risk benefit analysis for people
[2:56:06.200 --> 2:56:11.880]  ages 18 through 29, in other words, young, healthy military recruits, people in college,
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:19.720]  that sort of thing. For every one hospitalization that's prevented, there are up to 98 serious
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:24.040]  adverse events. These shots should have been pulled within weeks.
[2:56:24.600 --> 2:56:27.960]  All right, doctor. And again, we're not victory lapping, but we've all been vindicated,
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:31.560]  big tech censorists, they knew what they were doing. Please join us again, not in three,

[3:00:01.480 --> 3:00:05.720]  We're now into hour number four ahead of Gerald Salante Taganova.
[3:00:05.720 --> 3:00:11.160]  In 15 minutes, let's go right to your calls. Diego in Florida. Thanks for holding.
[3:00:11.160 --> 3:00:20.760]  Hey, thank you. Very noble work you're doing. Thank you. Alex, just let's face it on the
[3:00:20.760 --> 3:00:29.320]  Maloney. Her and Poop and the Hungarian Prime Minister are all on the same page.
[3:00:31.160 --> 3:00:36.040]  Nobody is agreeing with what's going on with the NWO.
[3:00:36.040 --> 3:00:44.040]  No, you're right. She's big with the leader of Italy that was
[3:00:45.160 --> 3:00:49.960]  bodies with Putin. You're absolutely right that this is a big deal. What do you make of it?
[3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:58.280]  Well, I see that it's going to come across. I mean, with the energy situation and all, I mean,
[3:00:58.280 --> 3:01:05.960]  it's going to get to a point where pretty much every country is going to be back in her.
[3:01:07.800 --> 3:01:13.000]  As far as the EU, you know? Well, yeah, the EU has threatened sanctions on Italy.
[3:01:14.440 --> 3:01:18.040]  The unelected EU is threatening voters. Think about how authoritarian that is.
[3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:27.800]  Yeah, that's pretty bad. But I mean, you know, I don't know if you heard that
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:34.680]  Germany said that's going to take over Putin's oil. I was like, what?
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:41.640]  Oh, this is real war, brother. I mean, I mean, we're in full war with Russia right now. It's so
[3:01:41.640 --> 3:01:47.960]  dangerous. You know, I think they say that the closest time we ever came to war was actually
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:52.520]  during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Actually, not the closest time we've ever been to war
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:59.800]  in reality, in retrospect, was the 1967 attack on the USS Liberty. There was actually a Russian
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:07.080]  sub out there that was observing the attack. And they actually asked, you know, they were actually
[3:02:07.960 --> 3:02:10.760]  It wasn't a Russian sub. It was a Russian surveillance ship. Yes.
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:16.520]  They said it was two minutes from actually nuking Israel. I was like, wow.
[3:02:16.520 --> 3:02:24.520]  And they also had just, you know, the sorties out there and they had the President Johnson
[3:02:24.520 --> 3:02:27.960]  call them back. That was nuts. That was nuts. But anyway.
[3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:31.960]  Well, God bless you, brother Diego. Thanks for holding great points.
[3:02:31.960 --> 3:02:33.720]  Chris in New York, you're on the air. Welcome.
[3:02:34.680 --> 3:02:41.560]  Mr. Jones, how are you doing? Okay, I have I have two medical events that happened to me
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:47.000]  recently. I went to my primary doctor in New York City. And I asked him a lot of questions
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:53.720]  about six months ago about the vaccine. And he got very upset. And he wouldn't talk much about it.
[3:02:53.720 --> 3:03:00.200]  Although he did admit one thing. He said there was graphene oxide in the vaccines. And how did
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:06.120]  he know that? Because he used to do research at Mount Sinai Hospital with cancer patients. And they
[3:03:06.120 --> 3:03:12.280]  used that for the cancer patients as a delivery system. So he admitted that. Okay, now to the
[3:03:12.280 --> 3:03:17.640]  second part. Just recently, I went to a specialist that doesn't know my regular doctor, the kidney
[3:03:17.640 --> 3:03:23.880]  specialist. And I, before I went to the doctor, I realized on the internet, they said that the
[3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:31.400]  World Health Organization was trying to get exclusive rights to vaccinate everyone in the world.
[3:03:31.400 --> 3:03:39.000]  So when I saw my doctor, I said, can the World Health Organization do this? If they okay this
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:48.760]  treaty? And she told me it's a lot worse than you think. And she told me that she got notified by
[3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:53.560]  the federal state and local government's health divisions or whatever they are, the New York
[3:03:53.560 --> 3:03:58.440]  State Medical Board or whatever, and the federal government and the city government that she can't
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:04.680]  talk about list and list and list that she had on the screen. But I couldn't see them. They were
[3:04:04.680 --> 3:04:10.520]  too far away. She says, I can't print these out for you. But I have a gag order. I was threatened
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:16.120]  that if I talk about any of these subjects, including the vaccines, I will lose my license.
[3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:21.240]  And I think people should know this. And they should ask their doctors, is this true and see
[3:04:21.240 --> 3:04:28.200]  what they say? Because this is, I'm an independent. I don't go right or left. I go through the truth.
[3:04:28.200 --> 3:04:35.240]  Now I learned it the hard way. And this isn't from USA. So I hope this helps people realize
[3:04:35.240 --> 3:04:39.960]  what's really going on. It does help, Chris. Yes. There is a medical tyranny to bring world
[3:04:39.960 --> 3:04:45.640]  government in via the medical system. And they're telling doctors, be part of these UN protocols.
[3:04:45.640 --> 3:04:50.600]  They admit mainstream news that UN is in control of our health right now. It's official. That's
[3:04:50.600 --> 3:04:59.560]  actually public. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:04:59.560 --> 3:05:04.520]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas,
[3:05:04.520 --> 3:05:08.840]  Mexico, the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's
[3:05:08.840 --> 3:05:14.200]  wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah,
[3:05:14.200 --> 3:05:17.480]  we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communist, but really,
[3:05:17.480 --> 3:05:21.400]  they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[3:05:21.400 --> 3:05:25.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican
[3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:28.600]  rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff
[3:05:28.600 --> 3:05:33.160]  sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of
[3:05:33.160 --> 3:05:37.480]  the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas
[3:05:37.480 --> 3:05:46.440]  rebels, literally. In fact, I'm going to tell you a little story. I think you want to believe it.
[3:05:46.440 --> 3:05:51.560]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com. And that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't
[3:05:51.560 --> 3:05:52.920]  find us, you don't want to share, that's fine.
[3:06:04.120 --> 3:06:08.760]  All right, Gerald Solente takes over in T minus 10 minutes, but I want to jam it as many of these
[3:06:08.760 --> 3:06:14.680]  colleges we can. A, we need to stay on air and have the funding. But B, just as important,
[3:06:14.680 --> 3:06:20.760]  my book, The Great Reset, The War for the World, is number one in the world right now.
[3:06:21.800 --> 3:06:28.120]  And we need to push it to number one and keep it there for a long time. Get signed copies that
[3:06:28.120 --> 3:06:34.760]  are a fundraiser at infowarstore.com or get an unsigned copy at infowarstore.com. But we need
[3:06:34.760 --> 3:06:40.040]  support. We are so close to imploding. Please support us at infowarstore.com. We have to pay
[3:06:40.040 --> 3:06:44.680]  for our own bandwidth, our own infrastructure, our own lawyers, our own crew, and we're doing it.
[3:06:44.680 --> 3:06:50.200]  And they're so afraid of this model. So please keep us on air. infowarstore.com for your signed
[3:06:50.200 --> 3:06:55.480]  or unsigned copies of The Great Reset or 1776coin.com for the limited edition Teddy Roosevelt
[3:06:55.480 --> 3:07:02.280]  fundraiser, historic piece of art coin as well. 1776coin.com. All right, Charles in Atlanta.
[3:07:02.280 --> 3:07:07.960]  Charles, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, what's up, Alex? Welcome. Hey, man. I've been a listener
[3:07:07.960 --> 3:07:14.120]  for over 25 years. I moved down from Dayton, Ohio to Atlanta. I was listening to, because I've been
[3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:22.600]  a freedom fighter since I was 17, Spirit told me that the world was a matrix. I began to have my
[3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:28.920]  eyes open. And when I got here, I listened to a black radio station that did a great job of
[3:07:30.040 --> 3:07:35.320]  balanced empowerment, intellectual empowerment to the black community. But somebody mentioned
[3:07:35.320 --> 3:07:41.240]  Infowars and Alex Jones. So I turned over at that time, about 23 years ago, listened to you,
[3:07:41.240 --> 3:07:46.440]  and I haven't went back the other way. Now, it's not to say that black issues are not important,
[3:07:46.440 --> 3:07:53.400]  but the difference between a black issue, a Jewish issue, a secular or particular ethnicities issue,
[3:07:53.400 --> 3:08:00.520]  it doesn't do what Infowars does and it encompass humanity as a whole. And I always have said,
[3:08:00.520 --> 3:08:06.360]  until we go up to the 33,000 foot view and see that all of humanity is in the grip of something
[3:08:06.360 --> 3:08:11.880]  evil, we cannot fight this thing by just being black or just being this and the other. Now,
[3:08:12.600 --> 3:08:20.120]  I saw a history channel show of an African lion running after five or six deer. There was a Jesse
[3:08:20.120 --> 3:08:26.520]  Owens type deer up front that he didn't try to bother to catch. He got the one in the rear
[3:08:26.520 --> 3:08:35.240]  with the lame leg so he could have the easiest lunch with less effort. I consider and I've looked
[3:08:35.240 --> 3:08:41.240]  at this holistically when so-called black people were brought over here and not allowed to speak
[3:08:41.240 --> 3:08:47.160]  our language, our religion, and so much knowledge was taken from us and there was a different black,
[3:08:47.160 --> 3:08:53.320]  quote, black man put into our minds. The system has used black people in America, in my mind,
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:09:01.160]  as a tinderbox to enrich itself on the one hand, but in the modern world, like black lives matter to
[3:09:01.800 --> 3:09:10.920]  be an inflammatory fuel for racial strife. It's not that black skin is worse or white skin is
[3:09:10.920 --> 3:09:16.360]  better, it's just that the evil people know how to use the weakest minded and the weakest spiritual.
[3:09:17.080 --> 3:09:22.840]  Now, unfortunately, the black community in America has lost so much of its spirituality. We just don't
[3:09:22.840 --> 3:09:27.960]  go to church believing God like we used to. I'm not saying all, but a lot of us. The homes are
[3:09:27.960 --> 3:09:34.040]  broken down, fathers are not in the home to take care to lead these young black men, and the system
[3:09:34.040 --> 3:09:43.960]  has left drugs, rap music, and guns available to make chaos. The living conditions are really,
[3:09:44.840 --> 3:09:51.720]  you know, you don't want to live in a poverty-inflicted place so the mind is not at peace.
[3:09:51.720 --> 3:09:56.600]  Okay, let me jump real quick because I know you got other colors. I want to say something about
[3:09:56.600 --> 3:10:04.040]  Owen Shroyer. Over these years, he's come up to be a great Alex Jones too, so to speak. He's really
[3:10:04.040 --> 3:10:11.160]  a wise young man, and I love the fact, tell him to continue to talk boldly and honestly
[3:10:11.160 --> 3:10:17.240]  and truthfully and as a Christian about black issues. There should be no white man, and I agree
[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:22.440]  with him. There should be no person on the earth that has any problem discussing issues that are
[3:10:22.440 --> 3:10:27.000]  outside their ethnicity. Don't let people say you're not black and you can't talk about it. He's
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:32.600]  a very balanced, clear-minded, probably... No, I totally agree. Let me tell you some closing.
[3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:35.960]  We should all love our cultures and where we came from. They want to erase it all,
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:40.840]  so we all have our own issues, but then we come together against the globalists of the depopulation
[3:10:40.840 --> 3:10:44.520]  and the transhumanists. We all have real beefs and real issues, but at the end of the day,
[3:10:44.520 --> 3:10:49.080]  this new world order is going to end us all. So, I want to thank you, Charles, for the call. God
[3:10:49.080 --> 3:10:54.360]  bless you, and I appreciate you. If we don't win together, we're going to lose, so we better wake
[3:10:54.360 --> 3:10:58.840]  up and we better come together and we better do it now. God bless you, sir. I appreciate your call.
[3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:07.880]  Powerful points. Travis in Connecticut, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Long time, listener.
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:15.240]  I love you, man. I'm starting a new job and I've been maneuvered to take the death jab. I tried to
[3:11:15.240 --> 3:11:20.520]  get a religious exemption, but was denied. So, I'm forced to taking the jab. I want to know
[3:11:20.520 --> 3:11:24.920]  there's major liability and lawsuits being filed, and even New York stopped it for private businesses.
[3:11:24.920 --> 3:11:32.120]  So, let me ask, without saying the name, what type of job do you have? Well, I mean, so I guess my
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:40.200]  question is, you know, I'm making the decision to actually do it just for this opportunity,
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:44.520]  but really, my real question is, I know that all vaccines are bad, but I have two questions for
[3:11:44.520 --> 3:11:52.360]  you, Alex. Is the J&J shot less harmful because it's not mRNA? No. And also, would, no? Okay.
[3:11:52.360 --> 3:11:57.480]  And would taking ibuprofen right before the shot decrease the chance of any side effects or less?
[3:11:57.480 --> 3:12:03.960]  I am not a doctor, but I've interviewed hundreds of them, and the J&J is probably, if you got to
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:08.440]  take one, take the Pfizer. Don't take the Moderna. It's three times stronger. It's the exact same
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:14.120]  injection, three times stronger. It's equivalent to four shots of Pfizer. So, the Moderna shot is
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:19.800]  four shots of the Pfizer. So, it's three times stronger, four times stronger, if you look at it.
[3:12:19.800 --> 3:12:25.640]  The J&J sends a virus in to reprogram the body to create the spike protein, and some studies is
[3:12:25.640 --> 3:12:32.920]  even worse. And so, you're killing yourself to live. Already, the mandate, the military is being
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:37.720]  canceled. The mandate is being killed at public schools. It's a lie. And so, I'm telling you,
[3:12:37.720 --> 3:12:42.360]  your health is not worth what they're trying to do. And no, I'm not telling you what to do,
[3:12:42.360 --> 3:12:45.960]  but if I had to take it, which I wouldn't do, I'd take the Pfizer, because if it hasn't been
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:53.000]  refrigerated properly, it breaks down and doesn't do anything. So, man, I mean, brother,
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:59.160]  I'm not telling you to take any of it. I'm telling you, the weakest one is the Pfizer.
[3:12:59.960 --> 3:13:03.320]  The weakest one is the Pfizer. Okay. Yeah, I would not. I mean, but listen, it's
[3:13:03.320 --> 3:13:08.280]  Russian roulette, brother. I mean, what type of job, brother? It's not worth it once you
[3:13:08.280 --> 3:13:11.960]  take this shot. Come on. And once you give into this, you'll give it anything.
[3:13:12.760 --> 3:13:17.240]  I know. I know. Well, give me a ballpark idea. Is it a medical job or what is it?
[3:13:17.240 --> 3:13:25.400]  No, no, it's a substantial increase in pay, but it's just I'm curious what type of place
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:29.160]  wants you to do this? Look, nobody, nobody knows who you are. I'm asking what kind of job is it?
[3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:36.920]  It's for sales. But, you know, it's just it's an increase in pay. It's a good opportunity. I mean,
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:42.440]  I could say no and wait out. Yeah, but you've seen the New York mayor go get a free hamburger,
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:48.600]  get a doughnut. Man, dude, it's like cheese on a mouse trap. Right. I know. Now, now,
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:51.800]  if you think you can get the cheese off of it without getting killed, do it. But man,
[3:13:52.360 --> 3:13:54.280]  come on, brother. God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:13:59.560]  That's the social credit score, though. Take an experimental unauthorized shot.
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:04.120]  Killed a bunch of people because they're offering you money. What type of people are these?
[3:14:04.760 --> 3:14:11.480]  God almighty. All right. I'm sorry to Thomas and Daniel and Lena and Jason. Get their numbers,
[3:14:11.480 --> 3:14:15.320]  John, and remind me tomorrow. They want to give us their numbers. We'll call them back. We'll put
[3:14:15.320 --> 3:14:18.680]  them on. But Gerald Salente has got so much to cover. I want to eat my lunch and listen to this
[3:14:18.680 --> 3:14:22.680]  great American, the top trans forecaster coming up here. There he is on screen. Let's bunch up
[3:14:22.680 --> 3:14:27.480]  Gerald Salente. Hello there, Alex. There he is. Gerald, what do you got coming up?
[3:14:28.600 --> 3:14:35.240]  Well, you know, what's going on in the economy and World War Three has begun. And we just heard
[3:14:35.240 --> 3:14:43.320]  this guy. Was it Jake Sullivan? Boy, you look at that cat man. Looks like he's related to gerbils
[3:14:43.320 --> 3:14:52.280]  when you heard him on CBS and meet the prostitutes on Sunday, saying that if Russia uses any kind
[3:14:52.280 --> 3:14:58.360]  of nuclear weapons or if they get more aggressive, the United States will respond and on and on and
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:07.640]  on. I mean, this is, you know, look, Alex, if if if you hated somebody and you had your and you
[3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:13.640]  got a crime syndicate, you're giving them all the weapons they they want to go kill somebody else,
[3:15:13.640 --> 3:15:20.520]  it's your war. The United States is at war with Russia. We are we are on the cusp of a nuclear
[3:15:20.520 --> 3:15:26.440]  war. I totally agree. This is five times more dangerous to keep a missile crisis in my view.
[3:15:26.440 --> 3:15:30.760]  Gerald Salente takes over. Everybody stay with us and share the links in full wars dot com
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:37.160]  port slash show in Bandai video. This is a war of information you or who they hate. That's why
[3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:41.480]  they want the show shut down because you can take action and you can override their AI and such a
[3:15:41.480 --> 3:15:46.280]  ship. So let's do it. The propaganda would not be necessary. If the situation was hopeless,
[3:15:46.280 --> 3:15:51.560]  share the links now the Alex Jones show and then in 45 minutes, Owen Shroyer and the war room takes
[3:15:51.560 --> 3:15:59.240]  over info wars dot com tomorrow's news today. We brought the game changing product previously
[3:15:59.240 --> 3:16:03.960]  only available to major oil companies around the world to the civilian market two years ago,
[3:16:03.960 --> 3:16:10.360]  the bio pros for septic tanks for porta potties for RVs for your drains, your boats, it goes on
[3:16:10.360 --> 3:16:16.040]  and on. It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water. But it's been so successful
[3:16:16.040 --> 3:16:23.080]  now. We're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will eat
[3:16:23.080 --> 3:16:30.360]  anything that is organic. And it's exclusively available at the bio pros dot com. And now

[3:16:55.880 --> 3:17:00.840]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic? You've got turbo force,
[3:17:00.840 --> 3:17:07.160]  you've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra, which one is better? And that's like
[3:17:07.160 --> 3:17:17.080]  asking what's better a Ford F 150 or the Cadillac or a Ferrari. It's different strokes for different
[3:17:17.080 --> 3:17:23.880]  folks. It varies all through a different formulas. All three do different things. Turbo force is 10
[3:17:23.880 --> 3:17:31.080]  hours of clean out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself. Brain force plus is a
[3:17:31.080 --> 3:17:38.200]  long term acting clean new tropic. This brain force ultra is a super fast acting. Neutropic
[3:17:39.320 --> 3:17:44.120]  creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long. They're all three different formulas.
[3:17:44.120 --> 3:17:50.120]  And finally, back in stock massively discounted brain force ultra is available at info wars
[3:17:50.120 --> 3:17:54.280]  store dot com. Brain force ultra back in stock info wars store dot com.
[3:17:56.120 --> 3:18:00.200]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer,
[3:18:00.200 --> 3:18:05.320]  a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, fortune and money magazine have all done these
[3:18:05.320 --> 3:18:09.960]  profiles. You see it every year, 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different
[3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:15.640]  tax returns, 50 different answers. And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big
[3:18:15.640 --> 3:18:20.040]  firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[3:18:20.040 --> 3:18:25.080]  public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation,
[3:18:25.080 --> 3:18:31.400]  and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:35.400]  and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten
[3:18:35.400 --> 3:18:42.360]  great tax advice in the last few years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL
[3:18:42.360 --> 3:18:56.440]  Jones tax relief.com one word Jones tax relief.com or call 833-904-285 833-904-285.
[3:19:17.320 --> 3:19:20.840]  We told you this was a designed program by the globalist two and a half years ago.
[3:19:20.840 --> 3:19:24.440]  We told you energy and food prices would explode and now they're up more than 40%
[3:19:24.440 --> 3:19:29.320]  in the U.S. alone. Some areas of the world are up over 100%. The only way you beat inflation and
[3:19:29.320 --> 3:19:33.320]  protect yourself and your family is with high quality, trouble food ready to ship right now
[3:19:33.320 --> 3:19:39.960]  at preparetoday.com and a very rare sale of 10% off site-wide, not just on trouble food,

[3:20:35.560 --> 3:20:40.600]  And one of the callers before about religious vaccine exemptions,
[3:20:41.640 --> 3:20:48.200]  Universal Church of Freedom, Peace and Justice provides vaccine exemptions and they've been over
[3:20:48.200 --> 3:20:59.480]  99% effective. And you can go to freedompeacejustice.com, freedompeacejustice.com to get one.
[3:21:00.040 --> 3:21:05.640]  And the constitutional lawyer put this together. The only way that they could reject this is if
[3:21:05.640 --> 3:21:14.600]  they don't accept religious vaccine exemption. Otherwise, unless you have somebody from the
[3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:21.960]  White House running the show, they can't reject it. Anyway, I mentioned to Alex, you know,
[3:21:21.960 --> 3:21:26.280]  what am I going to be talking about? We're going to talk a lot about the economy because we're
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:32.600]  going into the worst financial crisis in human history. This thing, this whole economy around
[3:21:32.600 --> 3:21:39.000]  the world was artificially propped up to fight the COVID war. We're fighting the COVID war.
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:42.600]  We're giving you free money. We're locking down your business and destroying you
[3:21:42.600 --> 3:21:49.320]  across the globe. But that's a whole other story. And now you're seeing it with interest rates just
[3:21:49.320 --> 3:21:56.440]  going up a little bit. What do you have a 3.25 Fed rate when you have inflation running at 8.5%
[3:21:57.560 --> 3:22:03.960]  and Clown Boy Powell, the Fed head saying was only temporary, transitory, and then today's woke world
[3:22:03.960 --> 3:22:12.520]  transgendatory inflation. Let's really be stupid. But going on to the, my greatest concern right now
[3:22:13.400 --> 3:22:20.600]  is the Ukraine war. And again, I'm totally opposed to Russia's invasion, but I totally
[3:22:20.600 --> 3:22:30.760]  understand why they invaded. And there was an article that just came up, Guardian actually
[3:22:30.760 --> 3:22:37.400]  put it out. This is eight years ago. In Ukraine, the US is dragging us toward war with Russia.
[3:22:38.600 --> 3:22:46.920]  And this is by John Pilger goes on to begins that, why do we tolerate the threat of another
[3:22:46.920 --> 3:22:55.160]  world war in our name? Why do we allow lies that justify these risks? The scale of our
[3:22:55.160 --> 3:23:02.280]  indoctrination, wrote Harold Pinter, is a brilliant, even witty, highly successful act
[3:23:02.280 --> 3:23:07.960]  of hypnosis, as if the truth, quote, never happened, even while it was happening.
[3:23:09.720 --> 3:23:19.960]  And then Pilger goes on to write, remember, this is 2014 may spring.
[3:23:19.960 --> 3:23:27.000]  Washington's role in Ukraine is different only in its implications for the rest of us.
[3:23:27.880 --> 3:23:33.320]  For the first time since the Reagan years, the US is threatening to take the world to war
[3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:41.080]  with Eastern Europe and the Balkans, now military outpost of NATO. The last buffer state
[3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:50.200]  bordering Russia. Ukraine is being torn apart. You ready by fascist forces unleashed by the US and
[3:23:50.200 --> 3:24:02.440]  the EU. We in the West are now backing neo Nazis in a country where Ukrainian Nazis back Hitler.
[3:24:02.440 --> 3:24:11.640]  That's right. 2014. You ready? Here's your trends journal.
[3:24:13.160 --> 3:24:19.640]  This one used to be a quarterly spring edition. Washington is driving the world
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:28.600]  to the final war. World hegemony is not a right America has earned.
[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:41.640]  This fellow Pilger mentioned the what was going on in Ukraine back then
[3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:49.640]  and about the overthrow of the government. It's all in the Reagan administration,
[3:24:49.640 --> 3:24:54.120]  the worst time since the Reagan administration. This article was written
[3:24:54.120 --> 3:25:02.520]  for the trends journal by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former assistant treasury secretary
[3:25:03.480 --> 3:25:12.840]  under Reagan. It goes on to say Washington concluded that Russia needed to be confronted with
[3:25:12.840 --> 3:25:19.080]  or distracted problems that would leave the Russian government less confident or able to
[3:25:19.080 --> 3:25:25.240]  counter Washington's aggression elsewhere. Ukraine presented the perfect opportunity
[3:25:25.240 --> 3:25:31.480]  for Washington to advance its demonic agenda. In a speech at the national press conference,
[3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:38.600]  club, rather, in December 2013, he said last December, I want to give you because anybody
[3:25:38.600 --> 3:25:47.080]  could look this up. It's December 2013 as by Victoria Newland. At that time, Obama, the
[3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:55.000]  Nobel Peace Prize winner, the murderer who's quoted in the book, doubled down as saying,
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:26:02.520]  I'm really good at killing people. Yeah, that assistant secretary of state, Victoria Newland,
[3:26:02.520 --> 3:26:10.280]  posted that Washington had invested $5 billion in NGOs, non-governmental organizations.
[3:26:10.280 --> 3:26:25.560]  In Ukraine, the purpose of the NGOs is, quote, you ready to teach democracy.
[3:26:27.560 --> 3:26:34.840]  Isn't that great? One after another. One after another.
[3:26:34.840 --> 3:26:50.040]  We are at war with Ukraine. Again, if I hide again, you see how the United States
[3:26:50.680 --> 3:26:59.960]  fronted this whole operation. So we're giving monies to the neo-Nazis
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:14.680]  to continue to wage their war against Russia. So if you're giving money to the neo-Nazis
[3:27:16.200 --> 3:27:27.720]  to wage the war in waging your war, we are at war with Russia. And Russia is now saying it
[3:27:27.720 --> 3:27:36.680]  piece by piece. This isn't the Iraq war where it's a third-world country. This is an Afghan,
[3:27:36.680 --> 3:27:44.200]  a third-third-world country. This isn't little Syria or Libya that the United States and NATO
[3:27:44.200 --> 3:27:52.680]  destroyed. I don't think NATO is in Syria, the United States, but definitely Libya.
[3:27:52.680 --> 3:28:02.280]  These are the Russian, and they're not going to succumb to this. And they're saying that
[3:28:02.280 --> 3:28:08.360]  if they're attacked, they will use any weapons that they need to defend themselves.
[3:28:10.840 --> 3:28:18.120]  World War III has begun. And if we don't stop it, it's going to be hell on earth.
[3:28:18.120 --> 3:28:29.080]  A great reset to get about. Oh, and the imbeciles and morons that are building bomb shelters?
[3:28:30.600 --> 3:28:37.880]  Oh, yeah, that's great. Oh, you're going to want to be alive after a nuclear bombs blow up the world
[3:28:37.880 --> 3:28:44.280]  and it's hell on earth. Oh, yeah, but you'll have your sauna down in your billionaire's bomb shelter.
[3:28:44.280 --> 3:28:50.760]  We're going to be right back. You better do all you can to support the truth,
[3:28:50.760 --> 3:28:53.800]  support info wars, and support peace.
[3:28:56.520 --> 3:29:02.840]  Everybody knows that high-quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system,
[3:29:02.840 --> 3:29:08.840]  for your brain, for every part of your body. But what I don't see being promote is the fact that
[3:29:08.840 --> 3:29:16.680]  it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I take a couple of these capsules
[3:29:16.680 --> 3:29:23.480]  an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now, there are actually some studies out there
[3:29:23.480 --> 3:29:30.520]  linking it to amazing events in the brain. But I want you to experience it yourself. We know it's

[3:29:52.360 --> 3:29:59.160]  your support. You're really going to miss out if you don't get it. Just look at these headlines
[3:29:59.160 --> 3:30:05.640]  from Reuters. World faces unprecedented global hunger crisis, UN chief says going into 2023.
[3:30:06.440 --> 3:30:12.520]  World Food Program warns of global food catastrophe, looming global catastrophe. The world could run
[3:30:12.520 --> 3:30:18.760]  out of food by 2023. Major studies say and the reports go on and on. We told you this was a
[3:30:18.760 --> 3:30:22.520]  designed program by the globalist two and a half years ago. We told you energy and food prices
[3:30:22.520 --> 3:30:26.920]  would explode and now they're up more than 40% and the US alone. Some areas of the world are
[3:30:26.920 --> 3:30:31.160]  up over 100%. The only way you beat inflation and protect yourself and your family is with

[3:30:59.560 --> 3:31:03.960]  whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire. Fortune and Money
[3:31:03.960 --> 3:31:08.840]  Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different tax returns, 30 different
[3:31:08.840 --> 3:31:14.920]  answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers and almost all of them just screw you
[3:31:14.920 --> 3:31:19.240]  over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the system and
[3:31:19.240 --> 3:31:23.880]  they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important
[3:31:23.880 --> 3:31:30.440]  situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things
[3:31:30.440 --> 3:31:34.760]  tax-wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money. We wouldn't even be here
[3:31:34.760 --> 3:31:41.640]  if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years. The only way you fail is not writing
[3:31:41.640 --> 3:31:56.520]  down the URL jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285. 833-904-285.
[3:31:56.520 --> 3:32:04.680]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency? Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience
[3:32:04.680 --> 3:32:10.600]  to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right? Yes. And you have a page on your website
[3:32:10.600 --> 3:32:16.760]  that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right? infowords.com.com slash crypto. Is that a little
[3:32:16.760 --> 3:32:21.240]  advertisement just there? Well, we're fighting the deep state. We need money. All right. This is it.
[3:32:21.960 --> 3:32:28.600]  Give crypto fun info wars. Sponsor us with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[3:32:28.600 --> 3:32:33.240]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight. Your advertisement for your cryptocurrency page.
[3:32:33.240 --> 3:32:39.960]  All right. You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight. So I mean,
[3:32:39.960 --> 3:32:43.320]  I hope whoever the big whales are, they'll give us money before we get done. We'll just keep,
[3:32:43.320 --> 3:32:48.840]  we'll just keep minting money as you're in this forum. All right, let's move on.
[3:32:50.280 --> 3:32:51.240]  People care about the First Amendment.
[3:32:51.240 --> 3:33:03.160]  Okay. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:03.160 --> 3:33:25.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:33:25.320 --> 3:33:32.600]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show. And again, everybody listening.
[3:33:33.880 --> 3:33:42.360]  We have to unite. Most people don't know what's going on. I mean, they know, you know,
[3:33:42.360 --> 3:33:47.240]  what the Mets and Yankees did, you know, this weekend, but they don't have a clue what's going
[3:33:47.240 --> 3:33:52.920]  on in the world. And info wars is doing their best. And they got a great team of people,
[3:33:52.920 --> 3:33:58.520]  the articles that they put up every day, and they're giving you all they can. So you give them
[3:33:58.520 --> 3:34:06.440]  all you can, because they want to blacklist us all. And again, we're doing all we can with
[3:34:06.440 --> 3:34:11.720]  the trends journal as well. But if we don't unite and work together, what are we talking about?
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:17.480]  You know, a couple of drinks, you know, you go out and I mean, you donate that money,
[3:34:17.480 --> 3:34:23.480]  you'll buy stuff from info wars, go to occupied peace, drive to the trends journal,
[3:34:24.040 --> 3:34:28.920]  but you better do something because if we don't, if we don't fight for our freedom,
[3:34:28.920 --> 3:34:36.360]  we're going to die in war. I mentioned the articles about warning what was going on
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:41.320]  with the United States overthrow the democratically elected government, the vikianic
[3:34:41.320 --> 3:34:51.160]  public in 2014 in the trends journal, the article by Pilger about him saying, and it
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:35:03.720]  was in the Guardian, actually, that the 19 the 2014 overthrows of Ukraine by the
[3:35:03.720 --> 3:35:18.200]  United States is bringing us to war. And we also heard this past weekend from
[3:35:18.200 --> 3:35:35.160]  Lavrov, that's Russia's foreign minister, who I actually met. He said Ukraine descended into
[3:35:35.160 --> 3:35:43.320]  chaos in late 2013. After Victor Yanukovych, his government reverse course on pending an
[3:35:43.320 --> 3:35:49.080]  association agreement with Eastern Union, European Union in favor of integration with
[3:35:49.080 --> 3:35:59.640]  the Russian led, you raise an economic union instead. In February of 2014, Ukrainian president
[3:35:59.640 --> 3:36:06.120]  was overthrown in a U.S. sponsored to sparking the present purity crisis.
[3:36:06.120 --> 3:36:14.200]  Quote, as I understand it, this is at his talk last week at the United Nations, Lavrov.
[3:36:15.400 --> 3:36:21.320]  Today's meeting was motivated by the desire of some delegations to discuss the subject of
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:29.000]  lawlessness, impunity in Ukraine. I think it's very, very timely because this time,
[3:36:29.000 --> 3:36:36.360]  lawlessness, impunity reflects what has been happening in this country since 2014,
[3:36:36.360 --> 3:36:42.520]  the both said. For more than eight years, the Ukrainian army and nationalist militant formations
[3:36:42.520 --> 3:36:48.520]  have been killing the inhabitants of the Donbass with impunity, but they've killed over 14,000
[3:36:48.520 --> 3:36:53.640]  of them, only because they refuse to recognize the results of the criminal, bloody,
[3:36:53.640 --> 3:37:00.520]  anti-constitutional coup in Kiev, because they decided to defend rights guaranteed to them
[3:37:00.520 --> 3:37:06.360]  under the Ukrainian constitution, including the right to freely use their native Russian tongue,
[3:37:07.320 --> 3:37:16.120]  the foreign minister said. Again, exactly what he said we wrote in this trends journal
[3:37:16.120 --> 3:37:24.360]  back in 2014. Here's what happened. Ukraine has been broke since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
[3:37:25.720 --> 3:37:33.480]  Not according to me, but according to the European Union, Ukraine is the most corrupt
[3:37:33.480 --> 3:37:41.480]  country in Europe. Run by oligarchs, who the comedian who played the piano with his penis
[3:37:41.480 --> 3:37:51.960]  on a sitcom, Vladimir Zelensky, and then became actually became the president of Ukraine, said
[3:37:52.520 --> 3:37:58.280]  he was going to do away with the oligarchs. And that's one of the reasons why he got elected
[3:37:58.280 --> 3:38:09.080]  and he joined the club. So going on, this was all in front of everybody's eye. So here was the deal.
[3:38:09.080 --> 3:38:17.720]  Yanukovych made a deal with the IMF, the international mafia, excuse me, monetary fund,
[3:38:18.600 --> 3:38:24.680]  and the EU. They needed money. Putin said, I got a better deal for you.
[3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:32.600]  I'll give you a lower interest rates and I'm going to cut your prices of oil and gas.
[3:38:32.600 --> 3:38:41.720]  Okay, we'll go with you. No, you won't. And that's when they over through the government.
[3:38:45.400 --> 3:38:47.800]  As I said, they're leading us to war.
[3:38:47.800 --> 3:39:04.520]  This past Sunday on meet the prostitutes, or excuse me, meet the press. This guy,
[3:39:07.800 --> 3:39:13.400]  our national security advisor, when you look at this cat, man, it looks like Gerbil's
[3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:20.760]  could have been his, his, his grandson or something like that. Man, this cat looks just
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:33.800]  like it is Jake Sullivan. Yep. He says to the Chuck Todd, or is it toad? I don't know on,
[3:39:33.800 --> 3:39:45.560]  on meet the prostitutes that Putin remains intent quote on wiping out the Ukrainian people
[3:39:46.520 --> 3:39:56.360]  and does not believe that Ukraine should have a right to exist. Wow. And people swallow that BS.
[3:39:56.360 --> 3:40:06.760]  Putin's never said that. That he does not that he wants to wipe out the Ukrainian people.
[3:40:09.640 --> 3:40:10.760]  That's a total lie.
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:18.680]  Just like Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda,
[3:40:18.680 --> 3:40:25.480]  but the people believed it. Just like the Gulf of Tonkin incident that never happened.
[3:40:27.640 --> 3:40:36.840]  That Robert McNamara, an arrogant, arrogant, may he rotten hell, dirty SOB
[3:40:36.840 --> 3:40:49.320]  he lied about and admitted, I wrote it in my book, Trends 2000, because after he died, it came out.
[3:40:49.320 --> 3:40:54.920]  The Gulf of Tonkin incident in Vietnam never happened, but the people swallow the crap.
[3:40:54.920 --> 3:41:04.360]  Just like they're swallowing the crap being shoveled out by this little Sullivan boy.
[3:41:09.400 --> 3:41:20.360]  Yep. So he's going to keep coming. And we have to keep coming with weapons, ammunition,
[3:41:20.360 --> 3:41:30.680]  intelligence, and all the support we can provide to the Ukrainians as they defend their land,
[3:41:31.240 --> 3:41:42.200]  their freedom, their democracy. Hi, little Jackie Sullivan. Listen to this crap.
[3:41:42.200 --> 3:41:49.800]  Oh, defend their democracy. Oh, like in Iraq. No, no. I know, like the Nobel piece of crap
[3:41:49.800 --> 3:42:00.120]  prize winner, Barack Obama. Gaddafi has to go. We got to bring freedom and democracy there.
[3:42:02.200 --> 3:42:08.600]  Oh, I forgot about Nicaragua. And then it was Haiti. Oh, oh, the Chile. Where else? Yeah.
[3:42:08.600 --> 3:42:17.000]  Where else? Yeah. One country after another. Bringing freedom and democracy.
[3:42:18.920 --> 3:42:23.080]  We have no right being in Ukraine. Ain't my business.
[3:42:25.880 --> 3:42:33.160]  None of them. I am an American. Hey, little Jackie, you're going to go listen to him.
[3:42:33.160 --> 3:42:40.920]  And he's going to what he said. We're going to do everything we can by bringing weapons,
[3:42:42.520 --> 3:42:49.320]  ammunition, intelligence, and all the support we can provide. Listen, why don't you go lead a charge,

[3:44:26.760 --> 3:44:34.200]  responses and joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA

[3:45:58.200 --> 3:46:03.880]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico,
[3:46:03.880 --> 3:46:08.680]  the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:13.480]  above organic and the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the
[3:46:13.480 --> 3:46:17.560]  little farmers that the media calls common is, but really they're just a commune. And whatever
[3:46:17.560 --> 3:46:21.400]  the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican
[3:46:21.400 --> 3:46:24.920]  government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what
[3:46:24.920 --> 3:46:28.760]  14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[3:46:28.760 --> 3:46:33.080]  for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find
[3:46:33.080 --> 3:46:38.520]  anywhere. It's wake up America, Patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally. In fact, I'm
[3:46:38.520 --> 3:46:45.080]  not going to tell you a little story. Um, we had like that. Okay, do you want to believe it?

[3:50:05.560 --> 3:50:11.960]  the trend forecast. I want to go back to this guy, Jake Sullivan on who's on meet the
[3:50:11.960 --> 3:50:21.240]  prostitutes on Sunday with code. Let me say this planning, he said, if Russia crosses the line,
[3:50:22.040 --> 3:50:29.240]  there will be catastrophic consequences for Russia. You're ready? United States will respond
[3:50:29.240 --> 3:50:42.280]  decisively. Yep. Yep. United States will respond.
[3:50:42.280 --> 3:51:01.640]  Is that nice? Yep. Russia understands very well that the United States would do in response
[3:51:02.360 --> 3:51:06.360]  to use their nuclear weapons Ukraine because we have spelled it out to them.
[3:51:06.360 --> 3:51:11.800]  And we will leave it at that today. Oh, you're going to leave it at that today. We'll respond
[3:51:11.800 --> 3:51:16.520]  decisively. From our perspective, we will continue to be sharp and clear.
[3:51:21.560 --> 3:51:32.760]  He goes on to say, you know, anyway, you can see what he's saying. We will respond decisively.
[3:51:32.760 --> 3:51:41.800]  We are going to war against Russia. So that means it's basically the end of life on earth
[3:51:41.800 --> 3:51:51.720]  if we go to war against Russia. All right. Before we wrap it up, I want to talk a little
[3:51:51.720 --> 3:51:57.720]  bit about the economy. When I went on the air, the Dow was down 260 points. Gold is taking
[3:51:57.720 --> 3:52:01.960]  a beating. I would have never thought it was gone down this low. Why would anybody want
[3:52:01.960 --> 3:52:08.520]  not not want to have gold, which is the ultimate safe haven asset in a time like that.
[3:52:09.880 --> 3:52:14.600]  But again, the game is rigged. And I'm not making that up. JPMorgan Chase was fined $900
[3:52:14.600 --> 3:52:19.720]  million in 2019 for rigging the precious metals box.
[3:52:22.280 --> 3:52:26.920]  You're looking at copper prices going down. Very important. It's called Dr. Copper.
[3:52:26.920 --> 3:52:31.560]  Because as goes copper, copper is used in everything from heavy industry to high tech.
[3:52:32.600 --> 3:52:33.880]  You're seeing a lot less use.
[3:52:37.400 --> 3:52:46.520]  The you saw the British sterling hit an all time low against the dollar.
[3:52:46.520 --> 3:52:56.120]  In all time low, even worse than World War One and World War Two, as the EU was going down,
[3:52:56.680 --> 3:52:58.840]  the UK was going down.
[3:53:01.800 --> 3:53:06.040]  The only reason the dollar is strong is because all the other economies are so weak.
[3:53:06.040 --> 3:53:20.040]  The Japanese yen at a 24 year low. You're looking at inflation rates at,
[3:53:20.040 --> 3:53:23.000]  you know, 80% like in Argentina.
[3:53:25.880 --> 3:53:28.520]  It's off the charts. What's going on?
[3:53:28.520 --> 3:53:38.120]  And today, you ready for this? Europe is facing lower than expected economic growth as inflation
[3:53:38.120 --> 3:53:45.320]  continues to climb. Speaking before the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary
[3:53:45.320 --> 3:53:53.320]  Affairs today, the head of the central bank, Christine Lagarde, former head of the IMF,
[3:53:53.320 --> 3:54:01.560]  International Monetary Fund, and then head of that bank, born today that quote economic
[3:54:01.560 --> 3:54:09.080]  consequences for the euro area over Russia's unjustified war of aggression on Ukraine,
[3:54:10.120 --> 3:54:14.040]  has spiraled further since June. The outlook is darkening.
[3:54:18.040 --> 3:54:19.640]  Let's go back to Lagarde.
[3:54:19.640 --> 3:54:28.920]  This is the person that said that there was no inflation when inflation was skyrocketing in
[3:54:28.920 --> 3:54:39.720]  Europe. It's 9.1%. The interest rate in Europe is only 0.75%. And they had negative interest
[3:54:39.720 --> 3:54:50.440]  rates, negative interest rates so that bigs could buy up everything for eight years.
[3:54:51.320 --> 3:54:58.680]  And what does she say here? The problems of economic consequences for the euro area
[3:54:58.680 --> 3:55:02.200]  because of the quote unjustified war of aggression on Ukraine.
[3:55:02.200 --> 3:55:10.360]  Hey, how about how about NATO's unjustified war of aggression on Yugoslavia, Kosovo? Oh,
[3:55:10.360 --> 3:55:16.040]  you forgot those. Oh, Kosovo, I forgot. Oh, yeah. How about how about NATO's unjustified
[3:55:16.040 --> 3:55:21.000]  war against Libya? Oh, that's different, Selenity. Oh, you're blaming Russia for the
[3:55:22.360 --> 3:55:28.760]  inflation. This is the crap, the garbage that they spew out of their mouths.
[3:55:28.760 --> 3:55:39.960]  You're the ones that put the sanctions on Russia. You're the ones that made the inflation happen.
[3:55:42.760 --> 3:55:48.840]  You're the ones that stopped the gas and oil flowing in, of which 40%
[3:55:49.560 --> 3:55:53.800]  goes into Europe that used to go into Europe from Russia.
[3:55:53.800 --> 3:55:59.000]  You're the ones that caused this problem
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:09.480]  by feeding weapons of death to keep bloodying the killing fields
[3:56:11.080 --> 3:56:14.840]  of the Ukraine war. You made it happen.
[3:56:14.840 --> 3:56:25.960]  Over 100,000 businesses, you know, which ones small and medium-sized businesses
[3:56:25.960 --> 3:56:35.800]  in Italy are at a business. Ciao, ciao. Bye-bye. Why? Thanks to the COVID war
[3:56:36.840 --> 3:56:43.400]  and the imbecile moron lowlives that locked down the country, right after China locked down.
[3:56:43.400 --> 3:56:51.720]  There's Italy followed. Then you put on top of that the soaring inflation because of the sanctions.
[3:56:53.400 --> 3:56:57.320]  Remember Biden was going to punish Putin? The people are being punished.
