[00:56.000 --> 01:01.880]  since it happened and I said day one it had all the hallmarks of a provocateur
[01:01.880 --> 01:09.600]  drugged-up Patsy operation countless investigations have been done on this by
[01:09.600 --> 01:12.640]  mainstream media there have been congressional hearings there have been
[01:12.640 --> 01:18.360]  massive declassifications these are real programs and we're clearly involved in
[01:18.360 --> 01:29.480]  the murder of people like RFK Robert F. Kennedy and Sirhan Sirhan clearly set up
[01:29.480 --> 01:36.040]  Patsy's with the situation with of course the leader of the Beatles John

[01:51.680 --> 02:00.840]  area as as the alleged shooters is saying that the reported shooter said
[02:00.840 --> 02:06.400]  that he was under mind control and that had been programmed now I don't just go
[02:06.400 --> 02:13.480]  off what some inmates says I watch what the police do and they say and the
[02:13.480 --> 02:17.240]  jailers say oh there was no access there was no way this could have happened
[02:17.240 --> 02:20.280]  well excuse me I've got all the news articles and I've got my team pulling
[02:20.280 --> 02:24.200]  them right now where they announced that the inmates saw him gibbering and
[02:24.200 --> 02:29.320]  spitting and talking and we're right next to him and cells for at least three
[02:29.320 --> 02:38.160]  days before he got moved three days oh and the police said they didn't want the

[09:15.560 --> 09:20.480]  because I've got a bunch of yesterday's news that is so important I've got to get
[09:20.480 --> 09:26.640]  to it that I didn't get to I've got just incredible amounts of news today that I
[09:26.640 --> 09:31.720]  want to try my best to break down and cover now for radio listeners we're
[09:31.720 --> 09:40.960]  also simul casting video feed at info wars news calm or prison planet TV will
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.080]  also get you over there because we're fighting the globalist construction of
[09:45.080 --> 09:51.680]  a prison planet by exposing it so that humanity can resist it and even top
[09:51.680 --> 09:54.840]  globalists of big the Brazilian key Hillary Clinton and others admit the
[09:54.840 --> 09:59.480]  world is awakening to the new world order and fighting outside corporate
[09:59.480 --> 10:03.440]  imperial operations but we're not fighting imperialism from the
[10:03.440 --> 10:07.120]  communist perspective of creating a centralized government that can be
[10:07.120 --> 10:11.040]  signed over to foreign banks the bankers have been funding communism for 130
[10:11.040 --> 10:18.520]  years at least no we're talking about true sovereignty against the mega rich
[10:18.520 --> 10:24.160]  who seek to collectivize our wealth to make us dependent on them we want to
[10:24.160 --> 10:28.960]  rediscover worldwide the spirit of the Declaration of Independence the finest
[10:28.960 --> 10:34.240]  document bearing on liberty the world has ever seen and export it on a
[10:34.240 --> 10:42.720]  planetary scale what I call 1776 worldwide okay now if you are listening
[10:42.720 --> 10:46.400]  on the radio you can simply go to info wars.com this is a point I've made but
[10:46.400 --> 10:51.280]  I don't make it I don't make it enough on air but if you go to info wars.com
[10:51.280 --> 10:57.480]  and you see the nav bar up at the top of the front page or prison planet.com it
[10:57.480 --> 11:03.720]  says breaking news that's the RSS feed of everything we're putting on info
[11:03.720 --> 11:09.960]  wars.com and then there's also right next to it top stories and I think I'll
[11:09.960 --> 11:13.920]  link that in red sort of breaking news because top stories is the stuff that we
[11:13.920 --> 11:19.600]  write or the stuff that we think is most important because you know our top
[11:19.600 --> 11:23.440]  stories tend to roll off because so many articles are getting posted out of
[11:23.440 --> 11:27.600]  featured news in just a few hours that's one thing I like about drudge report
[11:27.600 --> 11:31.680]  drudge report.com is he'll he'll put a lot of the new stuff down low but stuff
[11:31.680 --> 11:34.440]  that's really important keep it up top I'm trying to think of a system to do
[11:34.440 --> 11:38.600]  something similar because you know we've got so many writers putting out so
[11:38.600 --> 11:42.360]  much info they just pile whatever the new thing is on top and sometimes it's
[11:42.360 --> 11:46.720]  just as important or almost as important but a lot of times it isn't
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.360]  and then it pushes down whatever the top story is but the point is everyone needs
[11:51.360 --> 11:57.000]  to go into the top story link but also the breaking news link because here's
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.600]  the type of stuff that's that's breaking minute-to-minute at prisonplanet.com
[12:01.600 --> 12:10.440]  and info wars.com federal court ruling reaffirms restrictive gun laws boom
[12:10.440 --> 12:17.280]  and that ties into the huge article yesterday where Obama intends to use
[12:17.280 --> 12:24.200]  regulations to ban all semi-autos now I know for listeners that isn't any new
[12:24.200 --> 12:28.040]  news but they're gonna try this I mean they they ship guns into Mexico to kill
[12:28.040 --> 12:31.120]  people to blame the Second Amendment they'll do anything they ran a false
[12:31.120 --> 12:39.200]  flag-stage terror attack with fast and furious but now the NRA now the big
[12:39.200 --> 12:44.520]  shooting blogs the respected groups that are really focused on the 24-7 say
[12:44.520 --> 12:48.640]  that's the word out of the violence policy center the Brady campaign well
[12:48.640 --> 12:51.520]  like they said last year they're gonna get our guns by stealth quote under the
[12:51.520 --> 12:55.560]  radar they're coming for all the semi-autos not just to ban manufacturer
[12:55.560 --> 13:00.200]  sale that you're gonna turn them into them and they want to start a civil war
[13:00.200 --> 13:03.920]  the only reason this may not happen is because the police and military are not
[13:03.920 --> 13:07.480]  gonna follow orders most of them aren't they're starting to wake up and that's
[13:07.480 --> 13:11.000]  why instead of just saying let them come and take it and and getting your guns
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.320]  ready to shoot the first person comes to take them why don't you go out and
[13:14.320 --> 13:20.000]  reach out to police and military now in the info war and work for peace while we
[13:20.000 --> 13:27.760]  still can let's let's try to avoid the 1776 physical end as long as we can yeah
[13:27.760 --> 13:32.520]  the Texas revolution started when they Santa Anna came to take the guns from
[13:32.520 --> 13:38.920]  the tohanos and the Texians and everybody same thing in 1776 that was
[13:38.920 --> 13:44.800]  just you know 50 something years before that and if they try it it will be a
[13:44.800 --> 13:48.320]  civil war and that is one of the false flag plans the globalists don't care in
[13:48.320 --> 13:50.520]  fact they're happy the police the military will get killed doing this
[13:50.520 --> 13:53.640]  along with citizens they'll take out their enemy at the same time and I'm
[13:53.640 --> 13:57.040]  gonna dovetail that in a moment why the globalists hate the military so much
[13:57.040 --> 14:02.120]  tying it into women in frontline combat in just a moment but here I am I just
[14:02.120 --> 14:06.800]  read one headline and there's literally probably 60 on there that are new and
[14:06.800 --> 14:11.280]  then I've got and I know I say this every show it's just so frustrating let me
[14:11.280 --> 14:16.440]  just try to control myself this is not a act here I can't control myself I look
[14:16.440 --> 14:19.440]  at one article and then a whole data sheet opens up and then I never get to
[14:19.440 --> 14:26.760]  the next thing let me try it now federal court ruling reaffirms restrictive gun
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.400]  laws that's in the top story subsection of info wars.com the most important
[14:31.400 --> 14:36.360]  section move and die cop labeled embarrassing by police department we're
[14:36.360 --> 14:38.880]  gonna play that video later but we're having to cut out all the cuss words
[14:38.880 --> 14:43.920]  economics and telepterianism and the fiscal cliff how they hold you hostage
[14:43.920 --> 14:46.840]  and then raise new taxes that don't get you out of debt what we're gonna
[14:46.840 --> 14:51.320]  explain that inmate James Holmes told me he was programmed to kill by evil
[14:51.320 --> 14:55.600]  therapist and Watson's coming on to talk about that but the police have now
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.640]  come out and said oh or the jail guards oh he was never around other inmates we
[15:00.640 --> 15:03.920]  have literally hundreds of articles with the police giving press conferences
[15:03.920 --> 15:08.480]  talking about what he said to other inmates we have you we have you at the
[15:08.480 --> 15:12.920]  same jail and we have the police saying they didn't want the five inch folder
[15:12.920 --> 15:17.320]  from the high-level Pentagon psych warfare chief this woman had headed up
[15:17.320 --> 15:23.600]  Pentagon psychiatric entire facilities who was assigned just to him and he was
[15:23.600 --> 15:28.360]  in a government mind control program this is all on record a DARPA funded
[15:28.360 --> 15:33.720]  brain computer interface program funded by DARPA that's where they recruit just
[15:33.720 --> 15:38.960]  like what we broke a month ago what David Knight one of our reporters
[15:38.960 --> 15:42.960]  researched and broke here on air about the EPA pumping gas in on college
[15:42.960 --> 15:46.360]  students who thought they were signing up for for a safe test and they didn't
[15:46.360 --> 15:50.240]  tell them they were doing stuff that could kill them I studied MK ultra I've
[15:50.240 --> 15:56.120]  studied MK Naomi I've studied all these programs just the declassified ones alone
[15:56.120 --> 16:02.600]  they nab people in research projects because that's the cover they can observe
[16:02.600 --> 16:06.480]  they can drug different people they can see who's more suggestible this is where
[16:06.480 --> 16:10.640]  they do it and I'm telling you here's the problem if I gave you all I'm gonna do
[16:10.640 --> 16:13.200]  it when Watson comes up in 15 minutes there's no point in having them on if I
[16:13.200 --> 16:18.360]  just get into it now you let's say we got a list of 20 things there's more than
[16:18.360 --> 16:22.200]  that but let's just say 20 20 things that you check if it's a mind control
[16:22.200 --> 16:31.400]  operation with homes every one of them is checked okay so it might be that he's
[16:31.400 --> 16:36.640]  a schizophrenic on his own and not mind control but that is a very low probability
[16:36.640 --> 16:47.200]  it follows every single signature it follows every single data point
[16:47.200 --> 16:53.520]  fingerprint that we expect to see okay that's coming up yeah it's incredible
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.040]  just know how criminal these people are and they did fast and furious of course
[16:57.040 --> 17:00.880]  they did this of course they did this of course they did this and the police
[17:00.880 --> 17:04.960]  didn't want that folder and then they said oh the because the defense was
[17:04.960 --> 17:07.960]  wanting it and the police were like no no no we don't want that folders they

[24:46.760 --> 24:53.400]  he's almost 80 now okay we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you for
[24:53.400 --> 25:08.240]  joining us where to begin here women in the military women in the military this
[25:08.240 --> 25:14.200]  is such a complex issue on so many levels and I like to approach it from the
[25:14.200 --> 25:18.760]  globalist social engineering angle not from the way it's presented in the
[25:18.760 --> 25:29.160]  media through all of recorded history in every culture women have not been in
[25:29.160 --> 25:35.960]  frontline expeditionary type military forces they have been backup guards they
[25:35.960 --> 25:41.880]  have guarded temples they have been emergency rear guards no one is denying
[25:41.880 --> 25:48.780]  that women can get into an extremist mode and hack people up and stuff the
[25:48.780 --> 25:54.480]  issue is they're not as strong as men and women tend on average to break down
[25:54.480 --> 25:59.360]  more well when they're hacking people up or killing people up close and that's
[25:59.360 --> 26:04.720]  just well known in all cultures in all society women also are given to more
[26:04.720 --> 26:09.720]  infections out in the field this morning I was listening to 590 a.m. and this will
[26:09.720 --> 26:13.520]  take a while to go over and then Watson's joining us and they had a marine
[26:13.520 --> 26:20.360]  call-in had served three tours in Iraq and he described sitting for four days
[26:20.360 --> 26:26.280]  as a sniper in a bomb crater in Fallujah with a periscope with people
[26:26.280 --> 26:32.280]  shooting at him and waking up with his partner defecating into a plastic bag
[26:32.280 --> 26:43.160]  eight inches from his face war is dehumanizing so you don't put your
[26:43.160 --> 26:47.000]  women in it and they've done studies on this you can pull them up if you're
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.280]  going to have women in combat it needs to be female units and then there's a
[26:53.280 --> 26:57.360]  different effect when the women get captured there's a reason nobody puts
[26:57.360 --> 27:03.800]  women in frontline combat there's a reason for it also men tend to start
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.680]  having sex with the women and then there's fighting and it destroys unit
[27:08.680 --> 27:13.760]  cohesiveness in all human civilizations men get together beat their
[27:13.760 --> 27:17.520]  spears together the witch doctor says you're prepared to die but you're
[27:17.520 --> 27:20.480]  warriors and you're going to go to the happy hunting ground if you do die
[27:20.480 --> 27:25.720]  everybody gets fired up the pheromones are released and the men charge off in a
[27:25.720 --> 27:32.080]  column to go kill people that just doesn't work with women by the way I
[27:32.080 --> 27:37.080]  don't hear people saying men need taxpayer paid for the uteruses put into
[27:37.080 --> 27:42.640]  them so they can have babies it's not that men are better than women or women
[27:42.640 --> 27:48.560]  are better than men it's that men and women form the species and we are two
[27:48.560 --> 27:55.520]  different forms of life from the same species and there are roles with
[27:55.520 --> 28:01.320]  grizzly bear mammals between male and female there are roles between male and
[28:01.320 --> 28:06.040]  female dolphins there are roles between male and female sperm whales there are
[28:06.040 --> 28:12.600]  roles between male and female deer and what you're under is social engineering
[28:12.600 --> 28:17.080]  not even for the equality reasons you've heard they want women all working
[28:17.080 --> 28:22.840]  whether they want to or not they want the state raising kids and they want men
[28:22.840 --> 28:30.160]  dehumanized and their male attributes of rugged individualism gone and they
[28:30.160 --> 28:35.760]  want women to kind of play the median role of the new enforcer because they've
[28:35.760 --> 28:40.440]  taken a model a 3,000 year old model because it predates Rome but it's been
[28:40.440 --> 28:45.400]  codified for 2,000 years and there's handbooks republished on this from Rome
[28:45.400 --> 28:50.200]  used in the transatlantic slave trade of how to break up men and women how to put
[28:50.200 --> 28:55.080]  women in the house men in the barn don't let men learn how to hardly talk kill
[28:55.080 --> 28:59.160]  the strong males tell the women you're going to kill all the males of their
[28:59.160 --> 29:03.880]  group if they don't dominate them Hitler said first you get the women and
[29:03.880 --> 29:07.600]  you've got the children so follow the men 80 plus percent of advertising
[29:07.600 --> 29:13.760]  targets women men tend to let women run the household and run things so that
[29:13.760 --> 29:19.160]  role is now going to be brought into society not to empower women but to
[29:19.160 --> 29:25.000]  destroy assault now I'm going to give you the rest of the story on this when we
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.600]  come back and this is something I actually want to make a film on in the
[29:29.600 --> 29:33.160]  future and show you all the documents show you the globalist bragging not

[33:41.680 --> 33:46.000]  talking about the Pentagon DARPA since the 60s my grandfather worked on a
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.680]  secret project that I was told a little bit about but it wasn't anything
[33:50.680 --> 33:55.240]  special there were all sorts of projects going on for robots to go out and do the
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.720]  killing that's always been the holy grail and that's where it's all gonna go
[33:59.720 --> 34:03.480]  but they first have to wreck the military first to get there but the

[34:13.200 --> 34:18.960]  estrogen submitting to women and because they're the house slaves women have
[34:18.960 --> 34:24.400]  been the house slaves in every culture it isn't just you know the archetypal
[34:24.400 --> 34:30.680]  racist style 1920s and 30s movies where you see the black mammy you know ordering
[34:30.680 --> 34:34.920]  the black men around that's real folks that's what goes on that's all that's

[34:39.400 --> 34:43.680]  because they want us broken apart it's not that women are bad it's not that the
[34:43.680 --> 34:48.800]  CIA leading Miss magazine and helping found it with Gloria Steinem because they
[34:48.800 --> 34:53.120]  wanted to empower women they wanted to destroy women and look what they've done
[34:53.120 --> 34:57.840]  to women they have and and and and all the Hollywood stars say don't have a
[34:57.840 --> 35:02.240]  man in the house you know raise your own baby and they sell that idea and they
[35:02.240 --> 35:06.680]  tell young women you know go out and get pregnant because they need to break

[38:29.760 --> 38:36.280]  anthropologist on the broadcast the globalist want to use the military
[38:36.280 --> 38:42.400]  while destroying it because they're now openly coming out you're going to have
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.440]  robot passenger planes those are now been launched in England today I have that
[38:46.440 --> 38:53.960]  in the news there are going to be not just robot passenger planes but robot
[38:53.960 --> 38:58.240]  cars they're already licensing them in all 50 states most states have signed
[38:58.240 --> 39:03.520]  on or they're in the process of licensing them in all 50 Google NSA cars that
[39:03.520 --> 39:07.640]  also drive around cracking your computer and stealing your passcode and stealing
[39:07.640 --> 39:10.520]  all your data that's been come out they don't get in trouble for that total crime
[39:10.520 --> 39:14.520]  because they are globalist they're above the law and then they're gonna say oh
[39:14.520 --> 39:18.600]  these are safer effect they're already saying it these cars are safer it shows
[39:18.600 --> 39:21.760]  you're not allowed to drive the car yourself you'll be allowed to have a
[39:21.760 --> 39:25.520]  steering wheel and have the feeling of driving but it will take control when it
[39:25.520 --> 39:29.840]  says you're not safe that Toyota is now coming out with a new Lexus that actually
[39:29.840 --> 39:34.760]  does that it's now available but they're gonna and it's a you pay for it it's
[39:34.760 --> 39:38.040]  seen as a feature up front it's like oh there's a feature you run out in
[39:38.040 --> 39:41.360]  traffic and get run over there's a feature you blow your head off and oh
[39:41.360 --> 39:44.560]  it's trendy well let me do that immediately oh it's trendy I'll be
[39:44.560 --> 39:48.560]  anorexic oh it's trendy I'll mutilate myself you know whatever is trendy people
[39:48.560 --> 39:51.920]  go out and do so so people go and pay to biometrically scan to get in their car
[39:51.920 --> 39:56.320]  they go out and they pay to be tracked and watched by an AI computer hooked into
[39:56.320 --> 39:59.600]  the police department that's now rolling out to make sure kids don't get left in
[39:59.600 --> 40:02.280]  the car and burn up I mean you can't be trusted to have a car you got to be
[40:02.280 --> 40:07.400]  watched it met on stars hooked into the NSA so you're like what does this have to
[40:07.400 --> 40:13.600]  do with the military we'll see it we're told hey women deserve a shot too they
[40:13.600 --> 40:18.040]  deserve to have the economy shut down so they've got to join the military and
[40:18.040 --> 40:23.160]  then put on all the gear and stop around and kick down doors all day and serve
[40:23.160 --> 40:27.280]  four five or six or seven tears and then be put on in Fetimans to keep them up
[40:27.280 --> 40:31.840]  on three-day missions and then you know kill little kids and blow up whole
[40:31.840 --> 40:35.960]  buildings and see people blown in half when men can hardly take it in every
[40:35.960 --> 40:39.680]  culture and statistically are committing suicide at what seven times the
[40:39.680 --> 40:43.440]  previous record let's just send our girls in because they're getting the new
[40:43.440 --> 40:47.800]  national service draft lined up that's all been fired back up Congress is
[40:47.800 --> 40:50.880]  moving in that direction once things implode and you're gonna have domestic
[40:50.880 --> 40:54.120]  service that the White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel called for a few
[40:54.120 --> 40:58.040]  years ago before he left to go to Chicago so you've got all of this happening
[40:58.040 --> 41:04.120]  with a backdrop and it's like you know what it's all right women you get to you
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.560]  know you know have all the executive jobs and then oh my gosh now you get to
[41:08.560 --> 41:11.760]  pay all the taxes oh my gosh now nobody's there take care of the kids oh
[41:11.760 --> 41:15.800]  well don't worry the state will don't worry mom you deserve some time off so
[41:15.800 --> 41:19.760]  does dad leave your kids at school till eight at night that's now beginning you
[41:19.760 --> 41:23.280]  go out to the bar have a good time we'll deliver the kids back home at seven
[41:23.280 --> 41:26.760]  hey we're getting rid of the the a lot of the holidays hey we're getting rid of
[41:26.760 --> 41:30.720]  summer vacation you know it's not up to be babysat by the television they all
[41:30.720 --> 41:35.240]  seeing I have sore on looking at your kid all day two-way tracking what they
[41:35.240 --> 41:41.960]  watch via the TVO and all the systems so it's sold like the new right of women to
[41:41.960 --> 41:44.920]  be in frontline combat and what are they're doing they admit police
[41:44.920 --> 41:49.080]  departments fire departments they've lowered the standards oh you don't have
[41:49.080 --> 41:54.560]  to be able to to pick up a 200 pound person and by the way folks I'm pretty
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.480]  darn strong back when I was in good shape I could bench press 330 pounds I
[41:58.480 --> 42:04.040]  could squat 650 pounds you know I could power cling 230 pounds I mean that's not
[42:04.040 --> 42:08.640]  like power lifter but I mean you know pretty strong okay let me tell you
[42:08.640 --> 42:14.240]  something I've gone and over the years taken some of those courses for survival
[42:14.240 --> 42:19.360]  and taking courses on CPR and things like that it's hard to pick up 150 pound
[42:19.360 --> 42:25.200]  person okay and picking up a 200 pound that's hard how about well but it doesn't
[42:25.200 --> 42:29.840]  matter they just lower the standards just lower the standards and you know the men
[42:29.840 --> 42:34.840]  are so hopped up on female hormones now most of them can't even operate I saw
[42:34.840 --> 42:41.520]  Austin police cadets a month ago I shot video of it you saw it and a bunch of
[42:41.520 --> 42:45.480]  them couldn't swim you know today they didn't wash them up they put them in
[42:45.480 --> 42:50.880]  life jackets let me give you a little newsflash if grown men can't swim they
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.080]  probably were sat in front of televisions their whole life and I'm
[42:54.080 --> 42:57.160]  gonna bet they don't have some other skills they need I'm just a guess you
[42:57.160 --> 43:02.000]  know if you don't know how to swim what's any animal you can throw any animal
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.880]  in and they know how to swim by instinct that's a mental illness if somebody
[43:05.880 --> 43:10.480]  did not swim I'm just gonna give you a little newsflash you can take a week
[43:10.480 --> 43:14.760]  old rat and drop it in water it knows how to swim you can take a month old dog
[43:14.760 --> 43:20.200]  and drop it water it knows how to swim okay if a full grown man doesn't know
[43:20.200 --> 43:25.120]  how to swim they don't have business doing doing any job that's rough and
[43:25.120 --> 43:31.480]  tumble okay excuse me side issue imagine our men are debilitated chicken necks
[43:31.480 --> 43:36.760]  now can you imagine the women but but again that's it this all oh yeah you'll
[43:36.760 --> 43:41.120]  see macho they're gonna get rid of combat you're all gonna be robot operators
[43:41.120 --> 43:46.480]  drone operators men are done it's the end of men the globalist have announced
[43:46.480 --> 43:50.520]  it they said it they don't want John Wayne types they don't want that's why
[43:50.520 --> 43:55.600]  they arrest you be getting a fist fight they don't want you spanking your kids
[43:55.600 --> 43:59.620]  they're gonna taser them or they're gonna put them on hardcore drugs when
[43:59.620 --> 44:05.680]  they're bad you are gonna be taught did not defend yourself they teach kids
[44:05.680 --> 44:09.280]  when bullies beat you up let them beat you up they teach you when home invaders
[44:09.280 --> 44:14.400]  come in your house let them rape you instead of fight back they you notice
[44:14.400 --> 44:17.480]  the feminists don't teach women to go out and get guns and use them I'm for
[44:17.480 --> 44:22.040]  women knowing how to use knives guns hatchets I'm you know I'm teaching my
[44:22.040 --> 44:26.520]  girls how to fight I'm gonna put them all in martial arts I'm gonna teach them
[44:26.520 --> 44:29.760]  how to kick men in the groin I'm gonna teach them how to how to knock people's
[44:29.760 --> 44:32.720]  teeth out I'm gonna teach them if they get in a fight punch somebody right in
[44:32.720 --> 44:39.240]  the throat somebody attacks you attack them to kill them somebody assaults you
[44:39.240 --> 44:43.120]  you they could be trying to kill you so you take them out that's what I'm
[44:43.120 --> 44:46.760]  teaching my family I want my women in power I want them strong but see that's
[44:46.760 --> 44:52.800]  not feminism feminism is women pump full of estrogen on the verge of death
[44:52.800 --> 44:57.640]  getting cancer when they're 25 and their men pumped up on estrogen see men just
[44:57.640 --> 45:00.800]  get lethargic on estrogen women get wild-eyed and dominant it's their
[45:00.800 --> 45:05.840]  testosterone and that's what all the bisphenol and all the chemicals are this
[45:05.840 --> 45:08.840]  is the globalist sick joke they said they do it in brave new world you're
[45:08.840 --> 45:12.480]  like Alex that's fiction oh really Huxley wrote a brave new world revisited
[45:12.480 --> 45:17.960]  1961 and said it was all real in a plan so don't tell me I know about eugenics I
[45:17.960 --> 45:21.560]  know about the plan I know what they've done so they're gonna break the
[45:21.560 --> 45:26.760]  military up and screw it all up and turn them into little nanny nannies
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.400]  and they're gonna be called global enforcers of the peace that's the UN
[45:31.400 --> 45:36.120]  model with a bunch of women land in their big ospreys robots roll out and
[45:36.120 --> 45:39.760]  they command them to go take out them you know the men that aren't on the
[45:39.760 --> 45:44.360]  hormones and we're gonna celebrate the women and put the men down the men are
[45:44.360 --> 45:48.480]  gonna be metrosexual and that's the way things work this is the attack on men
[45:48.480 --> 45:52.200]  this is what this is all about and it's about social engineering within the
[45:52.200 --> 45:57.560]  military it's about the globalist forcing their way into it and you know I
[45:57.560 --> 46:01.160]  make the joke about hey they make taxpayers all over the country pay for
[46:01.160 --> 46:05.520]  sex changes for men and women because you have a right to that identity and
[46:05.520 --> 46:09.960]  don't think I'm attacking your identity I'm not even in that radar zone you want
[46:09.960 --> 46:13.600]  to think I'm obsessed with it because that gives you a bigger thrill that I
[46:13.600 --> 46:16.760]  want to keep you from whatever you want to go in and have surgery and have your
[46:16.760 --> 46:20.200]  whatever done that's your issue I don't need to pay for it you understand that
[46:20.200 --> 46:23.720]  but here's the issue so I shouldn't joke and say men might start demanding
[46:23.720 --> 46:28.240]  uteruses they're saying with genetic engineering that's coming so see I mean
[46:28.240 --> 46:33.040]  men demand to be able to have babies I mean women are magical incredible
[46:33.040 --> 46:36.560]  creatures we're supposed to hold up and then there are some women that are
[46:36.560 --> 46:40.600]  dominant types who will out mail males in the in the field that's always
[46:40.600 --> 46:43.640]  happened there's always been Joan of Arc's there's always been Queen Elizabeth's
[46:43.640 --> 46:49.040]  there's always been those type of women out there I quite frankly admire them
[46:49.040 --> 46:54.640]  there's something pretty sexy about that but the point is oh yeah I like I like
[46:54.640 --> 46:58.880]  real women I like the fire in their eyes the whole nine yards but they have the
[46:58.880 --> 47:04.000]  real femininity on top of it this is an attack on men and women this is an
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.240]  attack on the family the messages you see in the culture are there to destroy
[47:07.240 --> 47:11.200]  that just even tourists coming up at five after Paul Watson joins us via skype
[47:11.200 --> 47:15.440]  Paul Watson you've got a big story up at prison planet calm and info wars calm
[47:15.440 --> 47:20.920]  inmate James Holmes told me he was programmed to kill by evil therapist
[47:20.920 --> 47:25.440]  now break this down for us and then I've got some thoughts Paul Watson
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.160]  good to be back Alex yeah this basically came out of quite an obscure blog
[47:30.160 --> 47:36.160]  about a week ago to receive very little attention and it's about the claim of an
[47:36.160 --> 47:40.040]  inmate at the same prison that James Holmes was taken to immediately after
[47:40.040 --> 47:45.880]  the Batman massacre back in July and he claims that he sat with Holmes after he
[47:45.880 --> 47:50.240]  was you know arrested and put in the cell and talked with him for four hours
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.560]  and that he basically told him the quotes are in the article that he thought
[47:55.560 --> 48:02.760]  he was programmed by an evil therapist mind control brainwash to carry out the
[48:02.760 --> 48:07.680]  massacre he said he felt like he was in a video game and of course all this
[48:07.680 --> 48:12.840]  mirrors almost precisely what happened with Sirhan Sirhan and the immediate
[48:12.840 --> 48:18.960]  aftermath of the assassination of Robert F Kennedy so the question of whether the
[48:18.960 --> 48:24.360]  Aurora massacre was staged whether this guy James Holmes was brainwashed mind
[48:24.360 --> 48:28.840]  controlled into carrying out the massacre remains open but a question that
[48:28.840 --> 48:34.680]  doesn't remain open is the fact that people can be brainwashed can be
[48:34.680 --> 48:39.480]  hypnotized can be mind control to carry out assassinations because as recently
[48:39.480 --> 48:45.120]  as last month the Discovery Channel put out a program called brainwashed and
[48:45.120 --> 48:51.520]  that it was run by top experts Cynthia Myersburg out of Harvard and Mark Stokes
[48:51.520 --> 48:56.320]  out of Oxford University England they teamed up with one of the top certified
[48:56.320 --> 49:00.720]  hypnotherapists in the world for this Discovery Channel program they basically
[49:00.720 --> 49:06.800]  started off with 185 people they found out through a process of elimination who
[49:06.800 --> 49:11.160]  was the most liable who was the easiest to be brainwashed to carry out an
[49:11.160 --> 49:16.440]  assassination and an incident that this person thought was a real assassination
[49:16.440 --> 49:21.760]  and at the end of the program they were successful they successfully hypnotized
[49:21.760 --> 49:27.240]  an individual to carry out an assassination that was Harvard University
[49:27.240 --> 49:32.320]  Oxford University England Discovery Channel only last month there was another
[49:32.320 --> 49:38.480]  program about a year ago that aired in England called Darren Brown the
[49:38.480 --> 49:43.280]  unconscious assassin and it was basically the same premise they got a guy to
[49:43.280 --> 49:49.120]  assassinate a celebrity live on stage and afterwards he said he had no
[49:49.120 --> 49:55.120]  conscious memory of doing it he thought he was quote in a shooting range and
[49:55.120 --> 49:58.880]  let me stop you we're gonna go to break and come back with this but but this is
[49:58.880 --> 50:01.840]  getting worse and worse because studies show we covered the last issue of the
[50:01.840 --> 50:07.000]  magazine that people are in a trans-like state because of television it's put the
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.600]  general public in a highly suggestible near dream-like daydream state and
[50:11.600 --> 50:15.640]  here's the deal that it was all over the news I want you to another article on
[50:15.640 --> 50:18.040]  this Paul I got David Knight who in a report tonight on the nightly news about
[50:18.040 --> 50:22.640]  it they admit Paul and we're gonna cover this when we come back and people can
[50:22.640 --> 50:26.200]  anybody can pull this up but everybody remembers this that the inmates were all
[50:26.200 --> 50:29.480]  complaining of him not going to sleep for three days yelling and screaming and
[50:29.480 --> 50:34.000]  spitting and gibbering now they say no one was ever around him to say this and
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.800]  the police didn't want the five-inch thick folder with this top psych warfare
[50:39.800 --> 50:45.520]  Pentagon psychiatrist assigned to him and he was in a mind control program funded
[50:45.520 --> 50:49.640]  by DARPA this is all mainstream news getting tens of thousands of dollars a
[50:49.640 --> 50:55.280]  year I mean he fits the whole MO and they didn't want that in the trial and
[50:55.280 --> 51:01.480]  reportedly in that folder was all the planning for the attacks have you ever

[54:14.360 --> 54:20.560]  patents on mind control sure hands her hand it's now even in the LA times BBC
[54:20.560 --> 54:24.760]  now were there where the police are saying it was mind control that he didn't
[54:24.760 --> 54:29.280]  shoot RFK that they know who shot him that was in the original report that he
[54:29.280 --> 54:34.640]  had been drugged you can give somebody an amnesic like Halcyon they give people
[54:34.640 --> 54:38.200]  to have their wisdom teeth pulled and you could tell them to murder someone and
[54:38.200 --> 54:43.800]  they would do it and then not remember it two hours later and and you've got
[54:43.800 --> 54:48.440]  this guy in a government mind control program with a government grant under a
[54:48.440 --> 54:55.240]  the air force psychiatrist who had been assigned a high-level programs who's
[54:55.240 --> 54:59.560]  then sent out there she's meeting with him constantly she's got his folder
[54:59.560 --> 55:03.120]  which they don't want to release which reportedly he's talking about how he was
[55:03.120 --> 55:06.200]  going to do all this and then that's how these people describe who are
[55:06.200 --> 55:09.960]  programmed on the shows you mentioned Paul that you linked to is it's like a
[55:09.960 --> 55:17.720]  video game it's so incredible Paul it's so obvious please continue well yeah
[55:17.720 --> 55:21.880]  then you've got the actual you know chain of events itself whereby you've got
[55:21.880 --> 55:26.400]  people describing gas canisters being thrown from the opposite side of the
[55:26.400 --> 55:31.080]  theater to where Holmes was located you've got him describing Holmes waiting
[55:31.080 --> 55:35.480]  at the exit door and beckoning someone else over that's also what he told this
[55:35.480 --> 55:41.080]  inmate he tried to call somebody during the actual attack so you've got all
[55:41.080 --> 55:44.960]  that you've got the fact that his apartment was booby-trapped with these
[55:44.960 --> 55:48.880]  highly sophisticated explosives people said you would have to be an army
[55:48.880 --> 55:54.400]  explosives experts to have that level of expertise he supposedly rigged it to
[55:54.400 --> 55:57.720]  cause the maximum damage to whoever discovers it but the very first thing
[55:57.720 --> 56:01.840]  he does when he's arrested is he tells the police that his apartments rigged
[56:01.840 --> 56:06.240]  with explosives makes absolutely no sense there's a ton of evidence suggesting
[56:06.240 --> 56:10.320]  additional shooters the original police reports suggested that and he told this
[56:10.320 --> 56:16.320]  inmate that he was under it was like mind control he didn't he was suddenly
[56:16.320 --> 56:21.320]  out of the trance once he got back to his car and then the police run out and
[56:21.320 --> 56:26.400]  say oh no no one had access to him when it's all on record that for days the
[56:26.400 --> 56:29.480]  inmates were complaining about him yelling and screaming right next to them
[56:29.480 --> 56:33.720]  I mean it's on record that he was in the general jail area you know in his own
[56:33.720 --> 56:38.600]  cell next to people so the fact that they don't want his folder from the
[56:38.600 --> 56:42.040]  psychiatrist they're saying oh well that's private we don't want to see that
[56:42.040 --> 56:47.040]  I mean come on this thing reeks to high heaven Paul well they're trying to
[56:47.040 --> 56:51.320]  dismiss this inmates claims by saying he couldn't have possibly talked to Holmes
[56:51.320 --> 56:55.520]  but yeah like you said he described exactly how Holmes would run up and
[56:55.520 --> 56:59.760]  smash his head bang his head against the prison wall and that later turned out to
[56:59.760 --> 57:02.960]  be correct so these kind of circumstances that is describing suggests
[57:02.960 --> 57:07.200]  that he did talk to Holmes and the things that he's saying that Holmes told him
[57:07.200 --> 57:12.720]  he was he was brainwashed by NLP neuro linguistic programming ties very much in
[57:12.720 --> 57:16.800]  with how it's been demonstrate demonstrated scientifically that it is
[57:16.800 --> 57:21.480]  possible to brainwash somebody to commit an act of assassination whether that
[57:21.480 --> 57:26.480]  assassinations real or staged it's been proven that you can do that and also MK
[57:26.480 --> 57:31.080]  ultra you know church committee Rockefeller Commission both proved that
[57:31.080 --> 57:35.440]  the CIA was engaged in trying to brainwash people to carry out political
[57:35.440 --> 57:39.560]  assassinations and of course the CIA director two years before those
[57:39.560 --> 57:44.840]  investigations basically destroyed all the MK ultra files before they could
[57:44.840 --> 57:49.080]  properly look into it so most of those committee investigations are based on
[57:49.080 --> 57:52.240]  other eyewitnesses and people who were involved in the program the actual
[57:52.240 --> 57:57.360]  documents were destroyed by the CIA two years before so governments across the
[57:57.360 --> 58:01.360]  world have been doing this for decades it's proven scientifically it can be
[58:01.360 --> 58:05.680]  done and now what James Holmes as inmates said that he told him he was
[58:05.680 --> 58:11.120]  brainwashed by a quote evil psychiatrist to carry out this assassination and then
[58:11.120 --> 58:15.280]  you say you say you make vays have the same thing the death main inmates who
[58:15.280 --> 58:19.240]  have snuck and gotten on this show with their lawyer in the past confirmed and
[58:19.240 --> 58:24.200]  McVay who was his doctor the number two in psych warfare in the congressional
[58:24.200 --> 58:29.560]  hearings dr. Jolly in West was his psychiatrist from the time he was
[58:29.560 --> 58:34.200]  arrested to execution I mean how ridiculous does that have to get Paul

[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.440]  joining us looks like you're trying to deep sixes TV show well that look like
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.680]  it's happening that's coming up with Jesse Ventura we'll be with us two
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.480]  segments then your calls and news but inmate James Holmes told me he was
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:46.480]  programmed to kill by evil therapist and the police they know there's this giant
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.800]  five-inch thick folder and again we're gonna pull all these articles back out
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.520]  Paul's got this article but I mean the cover-up is the evidence folks and
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.680]  they're like oh we don't want that in the trial and don't let the defense have
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.720]  that because they you know defense which is putting on a pretty sorry defense in
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.560]  my opinion from what I've been watching of this and plus Holmes looks so drugged
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:11.920]  out then once they get him into court he's bouncing up and down saying all
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.280]  these things inmates have been saying multiple inmates then he shows up in
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:21.080]  court he looks totally drugged out just like McVeigh Paul Watson why would they
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.880]  want to block this giant psychiatrist file on this guy this lady who headed up
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:30.120]  the entire psychiatric program for the entire Air Force operation in San Antonio
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:35.280]  she sent out there and starts working closely with this guy who's also in a
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.840]  DARPA mind control program this is all on record I mean they're hiding this in
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:46.320]  plain view Paul well I mean if that's the case it could uncover the MK ultra of
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.920]  the 21st century they obviously don't want that to go public now if we also
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.680]  that Holmes was obsessed with mind control he designed this computer program
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:00.000]  that was designed to alter mental states using the flicker rates of television
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.800]  and computer screen so he was into it just as Jared Lee Loeffner was into it
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:09.040]  of course the guy who tried to assassinate Giffords in Arizona but these
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:13.360]  two programs I mentioned they set out this discovery and Channel and Channel
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.880]  4 program they set out to disprove the conspiracy theory that Sirhan Sirhan
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.280]  could have been a mind-controlled assassin and they ended up proving it
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.480]  because in both cases they prove that he can brainwash somebody to kill somebody
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:30.560]  and of course Sirhan Sirhan's ridiculous the amount of evidence eyewitnesses
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.600]  saying that there were two shooters they had people on the scene who were
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:40.360]  holding Sirhan Sirhan's hand as he was firing the gun said his bullets did not
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.280]  hit Kennedy but that the bullets came from the right from somebody else that
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.880]  was later covered up multiple eyewitnesses again and of course then you've got
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.160]  Sirhan Sirhan the drugs up Patsy can't remember any of the incident describes
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.840]  it as like being in a shooting range exactly like Holmes exactly like these
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.920]  participants in these scientific documentaries so in every case they
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.720]  described the same sensations the same feelings and then you've got this guy
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.920]  with him in prison saying yeah he told me he was brainwashed by an evil
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.760]  psychotherapist to carry out this massacre and then it turns out he's under a top
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.120]  side no contact with him and then it turns out he's under a top-psych warfare
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.280]  expert and there is this five-inch folder where reportedly he was planning all
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.800]  this but the police don't want that in the trial they want that blocked and say
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:30.880]  that's his private files which we know aren't private once murders have been
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.840]  committed and you've got it for the whole anti-gun agenda I mean this is
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.760]  incredibly obvious Paul well and you mentioned why would they want to cover
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:45.920]  it up now Victor Marchetti who was a former CIA agent 14 year veteran has
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:50.880]  gone on record and says that MK Ultra was never abandoned it continues to this
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:56.680]  day so if they've got a reason to cover up there's no bigger reason than that any
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.640]  other points just with the gun control you know record black friday gun sales
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:06.280]  Obama talked about an assault weapons ban during the debates that was one of
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.040]  the weapons that homes use so if they do want to take a bite out of the Second

[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:18.120]  that's in about three four weeks governor Jesse Ventura's giving us a 30
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:22.480]  minutes to talk about the TV show but he's in a very good mood today because
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.960]  they're deposing Kyle the Navy SEAL the fellow Navy SEAL that said those things
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.480]  about Jesse that Jesse says are completely untrue and well the guy has
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.640]  no witnesses it turns out and they're a deposing him right now but we'll see how
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.480]  much Jesse can tell us this is an update on that because folks if they can
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.400]  destroy Jesse Ventura and say he loves Navy SEALs dying which we know is
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.520]  asinine they can come out and say that Alex Jones says he likes to murder
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:52.120]  children you know somebody else could say that and destroy my character so you
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:57.040]  know I really look forward to justice being served but but that's not why he
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:04.200]  joins us today we have discovered that the show conspiracy theory for those
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.160]  that don't know just to give you some background going back two and a half
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.400]  years ago first aired on but Wednesday's got highest ratings ever for a new show
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:20.520]  was the number two show on true TV huge hit and then they moved the next series
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:25.080]  to Friday night the dead zone still got great ratings then they wouldn't
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:28.560]  re-air the FEMA special and got all sorts of Homeland Security threats that's
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.600]  been national news a race it off people's Teavos unprecedented off their DVRs
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:39.320]  then they shot last year because I was part of some of the episodes shot it
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:44.800]  held it for 11 months re-edited it took it away re-edited it didn't show Ventura
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.880]  shooting the gun and all this really cool stuff I mean I could tell well side
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.680]  issue the point is that that they took the show away but still very powerful
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.880]  one guy they interviewed about direct you know directed energy weapons dies a
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.600]  day and a half after Ventura talks to him I mean incredible stuff now they're
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:06.080]  not airing the TSA 8th episode now that's been axed now they move it from
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.800]  9 to 10 then they move it to Monday night and now they won't say where it's
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.760]  gonna air so it's kind of a treasure hunt here and I'm gonna stop ranting here
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.160]  former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura best-selling author joins us here
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:23.440]  served out wow what is going on with the TV show
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.080]  and I assume that they were showing reruns because I know on Thanksgiving
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:56.840]  morning they showed some reruns of conspiracy theory when I was getting
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.640]  ready to go to my in-laws for Thanksgiving dinner I had it out and
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.720]  watched a couple shows from a couple years ago and the Manchurian candidate
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:12.360]  was one of the shows that we did a couple years ago and so Monday I channel
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.600]  surf and doing Monday night flip down I see conspiracy theory to TV I assumed it
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:21.800]  was reruns well it was not it was the Ozark episode the one where we discover
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.480]  this underground city down in the Ozarks and that this town is being
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:30.720]  infiltrated with massive amount of banks they now have one bank for every I
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:36.160]  think 52 people that live in the town I mean it's just bizarre it's usually one
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:41.280]  for every one bank in the whole town yeah it aired Monday night and now
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:46.320]  tonight I see they got pawn shop on or whatever it is all night long so I have
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.120]  no idea when the show is gonna air from week to week and it's clear that they're
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.880]  doing everything they can to make the show a failure so that they don't have
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.240]  to redo it undoubtedly that is what is going on they're scared of it it's
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.360]  having an effect they waited till the day after the election to air the first
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.960]  episode of the new season it got really good ratings so they move it it gets
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:13.360]  good ratings again you can go look them up online so they move it again I mean
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.000]  this is incredible governor I've never seen anything like it in the
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.560]  entertainment industry you know I've never seen oh yeah no I will say one
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:27.320]  time I saw something like it when they hired me at MSNBC and at the time
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:33.360]  Phil Donahue was on with his short-lived show he had the highest ratings on MSNBC
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.600]  and they dropped him and they wouldn't put me on the air because both of us were
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.880]  opposed to the Iraq war and so they didn't want anyone out there with any
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:46.760]  opposition to the Iraq war and speaking of that Alex I'd like to make this point
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:51.880]  for a moment you know they're calling for an investigation of this stuff in
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.120]  Libya right the Republicans are yelling and screaming they want a full
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.760]  investigation of what happened at the Libyan embassy and the people aren't
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:08.320]  telling the truth correct yes we're not calling for a complete investigation on
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:14.360]  the Trump up to the Iraq war the WMD's where they totally lied to us about the
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:21.040]  WMD's they totally lied to us Iraq had virtually no ties to Al-Qaeda which they
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.320]  told us that they did and all of this hogwash you didn't hear one of these
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.960]  elected officials out in Washington demanding an investigation thank goodness
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.160]  there was a black woman congressman I caught her yesterday who brought that
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:40.960]  very point up she said we're all these people when we got trumped into the
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:46.800]  Iraq war where was their call for an investigation when Colin Pyle went in
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.120]  front of the UN and completely lied it were not by his choice he had those the
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:56.240]  firing points that the Bush administration gave him but he still went
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.120]  out there and told these bogus lies about curveball and all that stuff this
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:06.720]  day it was all based upon a informant that Germany had which Germany had
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.280]  already discarded him is no credibility and that's what we ended up basing the
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:17.560]  entire Iraq war on really these elected spineless pukes who now want an
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:22.360]  investigation of Libya but you won't see them touching investigation of why we
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.520]  went into Iraq I agree with you I want to cover some other issues with you
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.480]  especially on the Manchurian candidate since you mentioned that in a moment
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:34.760]  because that's actually in the news today even in mainstream Denver papers
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.160]  concerning the Batman shooting but before we go there back to the TV show I
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:43.440]  understand they spend millions of dollars making these so they want to air
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.960]  them but then if they don't air them it also becomes another issue that they're
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:52.400]  censoring I know the head of true TV promised you three years ago that you
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.800]  wouldn't be censored and I thought it was unprecedented we had a private bet
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.800]  against the other producers you and I and others that it wouldn't air I agree
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.640]  with you that it would never air it was so hardcore but then the second season
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.680]  they did censor some shows now there's they've nixed the TSA show about cancer
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:14.920]  and now they're just hiding the show I mean are you gonna talk to them or try
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.040]  to find out what's going on or will they not talk to you
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:24.120]  they still haven't even paid me yet they still owe me a paycheck
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:30.000]  wow and I mean this has been over a year since we completed the shows and I'm
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.760]  and I'm battling with them now to give me my cuz that my contract states that I
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.600]  get my last check upon completion of all editing and when the show is ready to go
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:46.680]  on the air well excuse me Alex three shows of aired and I still haven't seen
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:52.080]  my last paycheck yet so I think it's clear to say you're not too happy with
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:58.280]  Time Warner well I don't know you know if it's the parent company or two TV who's
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:02.400]  doing it I mean I'm sure I'll get paid I got great lawyers and it's a pretty
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.920]  ironclad contract but I just find it very disrespectful that everybody else on
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:12.480]  the show has been paid off but the style of the show remain you know that's what
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:18.640]  I've remaining to get that's what I've noticed it's weird that just in general
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:24.800]  life as you get more famous people treat you in many cases worse like they
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:28.520]  think you deserve to be treated bad or something it's bizarre and then all
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.400]  these losers wonder why they're not successful because they don't even know
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:56.840]  how to treat people with respect amazing it's obviously re-airing now that's
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.480]  the real proof of the pudding if they're not re-airing it guys check the
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:03.600]  true TV schedule to see when the Ozarks conspiracy is re-airing just go to the
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.440]  conspiracy theory site just type in conspiracy theory and it comes up and
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:10.160]  we'll find out when that's airing we'll talk about in the next segment but talk
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.160]  about the Ozarks conspiracy because that was one of the shows I was most
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.880]  excited about they're building giant underground bunkers you know 50
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:34.400]  squabbles in the sky from that's got the surveillance I mean if you added a
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.200]  bathroom to your house you'd have to go get permits from the city you know if
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:46.240]  you built an addition on your house I think it's 72 or 74 thousand square
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:53.560]  and it's got giant thick armored concrete walls and the guys formerly with
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.800]  the NSA that's why they don't want that show being seen listen I've discovered
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.960]  an NSA base in my neighborhood talked to the homeowners association I'm on the
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.800]  Homer Association but talk to one down the street and they go yeah no it's
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:09.840]  national security they're in a group of houses as a cover and I've yet to go
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:20.720]  over there but that's what they do Jesse
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:26.520]  in the show we actually infiltrate and drive for literally city blocks under
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.520]  the ground and I mean that they had tennis courts they had everything there
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.960]  and then they did the editing really the final edit they didn't show the tennis
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:42.840]  courts I found that interesting that they that they really cut away from
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:47.440]  showing a great deal of what we saw on the ground to this underground city they
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.440]  they kind of live over the top on it with their final editing they showed us
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:57.080]  more in the car driving around in the underground city than they actually show
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:02.160]  to the city itself now I can see that because I saw the footage of you you
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.400]  know firing the machine guns in the David Ike episode and I mean it looked
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.520]  this is the most awesome footage ever and I mean I just know how TV works and I
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:15.480]  can see what's going on and I'm not pleased by what Time Warner's up to I
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:20.240]  mean obviously there's some shenanigans going on well look at it this way we
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:47.920]  still managed to get them on that's a big deal that's right that's right that's
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.480]  right in fact congratulations governor Ventura I feel good just being involved
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.440]  in it and the whole crew the production crew are awesome folks everybody

[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.440]  critical role in controlling how my cells organs and other tissues behave I
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.920]  learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I've been

[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.240]  because the liberal media has been suppressing what has fast becoming the
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:18.800]  most shocking news story of 2012 Obama's secret war on coal that could
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:23.680]  increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months as
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:27.400]  shocking as it sounds it may well be just a matter of time before the lights
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:31.600]  start going out across America but here's some good news there's an
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:36.240]  underground video at exposed one two three dot com that thousands of smart
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.840]  patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly the
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:45.240]  video at exposed one two three dot com is already been banned by Google and the
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.080]  liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:54.000]  the dark so watch it now at exposed one two three dot com before it's too late
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.080]  again that's exposed one two three dot com
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:08.800]  okay final segment with Jesse Ventura I've gone to true TV dot com and in the
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:13.080]  last two seasons when they air these like 50 times over the next year and
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.560]  generally they aired about ten times that week and all these different slots
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.240]  because it's a new hot show everybody knows that about cable with shows on
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.120]  true TV history discovery you name it I mean I was just on a discovery show
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:27.880]  dealing with secrets of secret societies and they've aired it like 15
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.880]  times in a month I haven't watched it yet it's funny I watch conspiracy theory
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:36.760]  but not shows I'm on well I guess I'm on conspiracy 32 the point is they're
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.800]  definitely deep-sixing it and I think you know it's a free country plus I don't
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.080]  like going and working and not having something getting seen I think this is
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.000]  probably maybe the best season despite all the stuff they've done to it Jesse
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.560]  was just agreeing with me during the break I wanted to say that in his own
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.720]  words but I'm pretty angry I mean I don't like doing stuff and it not getting
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:59.440]  on air that's why I've turned down at least five with the contracts reality
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:03.520]  TV shows because I'm not gonna go shoot stuff like I've done in the past and
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:17.760]  have it not air Jesse I mean I mean does it make you angry
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:40.800]  actually out to try to make you fail so they can say you failed well it's more
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:48.200]  they're scared of what's in these and coming up next week who knows they say
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.440]  they're airing the skinwalker episode Jesse any other points you want to make
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:26:08.760]  on the TV show I've met some of the most interesting strange people in the
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:25.840]  world and I've had an amazing time just the shows three or four each season
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:30.720]  and I've been able to be involved with why do you think the FEMA camp show
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:34.760]  scared them so bad because you had former FBI agents admitting plans to
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:40.560]  round us up because obviously they don't want us to know if you tie that
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:46.640]  into the show that we showed that showed Monday on the Ozarks it appears that
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.120]  the elites are gonna all go underground while the big Armageddon happens up
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:56.840]  above and who goes into these FEMA camps obviously they don't want
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:01.000]  people to realize that these camps are out there and that they're waiting for us
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.280]  that they whoever's gonna end up in them and that beat the centers like me and
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:12.400]  Alex Jones I don't know but obviously they've got somebody in mind that's
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.720]  gonna occupy these places or why would they be building six of them throughout
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.400]  the country well the power structure scared of you that's why they waited
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.440]  till you went into Mexico to announce that you were dancing around saying you
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.960]  were glad Navy Seals were dead when you'd been on my show saying you hate
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.320]  the wars because it kills people you were there to speak at a commencement you
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:35.240]  were there to support people it's asinine you would do something like that I
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.880]  know you do well for seven years now briefly things are going well if
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:28:09.440]  there's any justice at least in your lawsuit to get your name back
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:13.360]  naturally I would question everything else in his book because if that's a
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.880]  lie what else is a lie well it's just ridiculous that you would say something
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:22.400]  like that and I know it hurts you when I called you in Mexico and gave you the
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:29.480]  news but it's I'll tell you I am so loyal to the teams the underwater
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:34.680]  demolition seal teams that in my deposition I told them I said other
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:38.120]  than killing my wife and children this is the worst thing that could have ever
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.520]  happened to me no I never heard you like it I mean you didn't start crying but
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.800]  you were you I could tell it was you had to sit down did you have to sit down when
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:54.080]  I told you that I feel betrayed I feel and like I said Alex I don't think I
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:57.840]  can go to a reunion again because I'd be looking over my shoulder that was the
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:02.600]  one place I could go to no matter what I did where I always felt safe I always
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:07.680]  felt I'd never get stabbed in the back now it simply isn't true I don't trust
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:14.040]  the young guys out there now you know who will be the next to throw me under the
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:19.080]  bus for their convenience in there and so they can make money when people try to
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:23.880]  steal your honor it dishonors them and it's just so pitiful yeah it really
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:28.680]  truly is and that's why I'm gonna go to court on this thing I won't say there
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:33.000]  won't be a settlement but an order for a settlement to take place he's gonna have
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.640]  to come out and openly admit that that chapter in his book was fabricated Jesse
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.640]  I know you've got to go but I'm gonna twist your arm here I've got one more
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.040]  question on the other side with Jesse Ventura we'll be right back stay with

[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:04.360]  during the break and I said hey do you want to give the number out or the
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:08.440]  email well I mean in your own words you think people should contact true TV and
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:14.280]  try to make sure that they don't deep six this season well you know if people
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:18.720]  are outraged like I am that they haven't given us one specific time that you can
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:23.160]  look forward to every week I mean how do they expect the TV show to be
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:27.480]  successful when it's on Wednesday at two different times and then they switch it
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:32.040]  over to Monday and there's no advertising they don't tell anybody so
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.280]  it's clear and if people want to call them I'd love it I'd love for people to
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:40.880]  call up through TV and Time Warner and express their dissatisfaction with how
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.160]  they're trying to deep six conspiracy theory that obviously they don't want
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:50.240]  the show to be successful well said and then there's a toll number and a toll
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:58.160]  free number we'll give them both out it's 212-484-8000 212-484-8000 they
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.840]  erase the shows off DVRs they they don't air shows ask him where's the TSA
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:10.000]  special about the cancer shirt off gets interviewed and gets destroyed just
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.480]  like they just that congressman you got exposed about the FEMA camps trying to
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.920]  say they didn't exist that he was shown the bill that he co-supported and then
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:23.720]  he had oh I do remember that bail I mean I mean Jesse you absolutely annihilated
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:28.200]  that guy and then and Ron Paul and his farewell address two weeks ago said we
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:32.080]  have more and more a state-run media and what and what's happened to you
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:41.200]  governor is proving it I agree completely that our media today for the most part is corporate run by the corporate powers and the power
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.880]  entities of the world and unfortunately that's what probably 90% of Americans get
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:51.560]  their facts from today and until they break free from corporate media and start
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:55.960]  looking at other places to learn the truth I'm afraid we're gonna cut down a
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.200]  bad road here I agree with you let me give that number out again it's two on
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:04.280]  two four eight four eight thousand and here's the toll-free number we'll put
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.560]  that up on screen for TV viewers radio listeners it's eight hundred two six
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:12.840]  eight seven eight five six eight hundred two six eight seven eight five six and
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:19.400]  look if you are a cable subscriber or a dish network or direct TV you know call
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.760]  them say hey you know what this is one of my favorite shows it's got top ratings
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:28.680]  we want to see the TSA show and we want to see the FEMA camp show re-air from
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.600]  last year and we want to see these not hidden and moved around like it's an
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:37.440]  Easter egg hunt why are you doing this governor in closing here we were talking
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:40.480]  about being honorable during the break and I was saying you know that I would
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:43.600]  never betray you or any of my friends and you were saying well that's all
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:48.280]  anybody's got is their honor and you know it's so sad that you're saying you
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.520]  don't feel safe now even going to a Navy SEAL reunion that somebody else could
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:56.880]  just make something up about you but that's the that's the new modern thing
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.000]  where you just make something up just in the last two weeks I have stopped a
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.400]  corporation and a law firm from suing people who who lied about them just to
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:11.520]  get at me because I because I'm just too busy fighting the globalist that I've
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:14.760]  just accepted people are gonna lie and try to destroy my character they're
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.760]  just so dumb they then attack other people and they have no idea that I'm
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.760]  sitting there holding back lawsuits against them I don't think I do a lot
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.920]  of reading and I read a thing recently in a book where they said the destroy
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:34.760]  that the government will destroy their character before they assassinate you your
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:38.880]  character will get assassinated first and then your physical body will be
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:42.680]  assassinated second that's where I was going it's incredible we're on the same
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:46.560]  page I didn't know exactly that's why this is dangerous is that when they
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.280]  really intensify this stuff that's when they're getting ready to kill you and I
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:59.720]  hope they don't kill you I hope they don't kill me well now you said you
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:06.200]  like I've always said the Alex if I turn up dad don't believe the official story
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.080]  because people out there need to understand when the government comes
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.160]  out with an official story it's generally to protect officials well that's
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.440]  what I've said when they come out instantly with something like 25 minutes
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:22.400]  after Breitbart had gone to the hospital and said oh it's it's normal it's a
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.680]  official it's nothing when they come out and say oh we got Lee Harvey Oswald
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:30.320]  before he's even been arrested that's when you know and here's my final point
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.080]  on that I know you did a mind control episode you've been a lot of research on
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:39.480]  it it's in the Denver papers Westworld and others that the inmate and other
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.480]  inmates are saying similar things that James Holt Holmes the Batman shooter
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:46.640]  said he was under mind control let me just fill you in on this governor if you
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:52.880]  don't know the the top Pentagon I mean she was the head of the Air Force
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.520]  program in San Antonio she was sent out there and the police said oh we don't
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:02.840]  want the five inch file she had with him where we're reportedly of the defense
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:05.960]  wanted it talking about how he was planning all this they said we don't
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:09.720]  want that the prosecution doesn't want that they tried to suppress it and they
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:13.360]  have suppressed it now the police say no inmates were around him but it was on
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.520]  the news that for days he was yelling and screaming and that the inmates were
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:22.840]  complaining Holmes reportedly told inmates he was under mind control and
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:28.240]  was programmed and it turns out he was in a DARPA program for brain interface to
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:34.040]  hypnotize people this is all confirmed I mean this fits the sir hand sir hand
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:37.960]  model but with a high-tech overlay there's a briefing of what is your take
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:44.920]  on this question all the assassinations that have happened in this
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:50.680]  country because look at who gets killed the people who died violently are the
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:58.200]  people who stand for peace John Lennon John Kennedy Robert Kennedy Martin
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:03.560]  Luther King Malcolm X you go right down the line people that were standing up
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:08.880]  for peace all these end up dying violently and every time they die it's a
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:14.560]  loading up assassin anybody that dies into that hogwash he is naive and they
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:20.280]  deserve what they get I agree I've talked off record to some of the people in
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:24.200]  and around I'm not even gonna get into it in fact I'm sworn to confidence I
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:27.960]  can't even say with but one of those assassinations you mentioned and the
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:31.080]  stuff they told me this is very well-known person I said you've got to
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:35.440]  come on air and they said look you just get threatened I've lost family I know
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.320]  how real this is and and and so I'm like okay but I mean it's and I know
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.760]  they're probably listening right now it's just like you said three years of
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.640]  conspiracy theory and what you did before that as a governor and all the
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:51.360]  rest of it is has shown you the real world out there what do you want to say
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:55.020]  to folks in closing who are naive and haven't seen the things you or I have
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:59.680]  seen well I just want to tell them again open up your minds and open up your
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:05.680]  hearts and understand that government is run by people and people can be evil
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:10.240]  they need to take government off this pedestal that they will lie to us they
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:15.720]  won't deceive us because yes they will they do it all the time and people need
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:19.760]  to wake up to that fact and the sooner that they wake up to that fact the
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:23.920]  better off we're all gonna be well we appreciate your courage with the show I
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:26.840]  know there's some behind the scenes things happen with the FEMA episode but
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.320]  we're not supposed to get into that and just thank you governor for all you've
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:34.960]  done and we'll talk to you again for another update next Monday if that's
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:42.440]  actually when they're airing the next episode thank you so much yes sir thank
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.960]  you all right there goes governor Jesse Vin Turra he'll be on the 30 minutes
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:51.000]  when a little bit longer this week next Monday just a great guy behind the scene
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:57.680]  so real I mean just I've gotten a really knowing well that he is real and just
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:04.620]  wants to go off and be reclusive and play golf I don't blame him but he
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.480]  wants to ride off into the sunset but he doesn't like the corruption that's
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.720]  taking place either and again I don't agree with some of the things Ventura you
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:14.520]  know I've told Mr. Space and he is same here you know he doesn't agree with some
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:19.440]  of the things I believe but he's real I mean I just want real people can't you
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:27.560]  just be real and that's what I'm looking for is is is something that's
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:31.440]  bonafide and the system knows you're looking for that too that's why they
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:37.120]  spend all day trying to pull down info wars calm and and Alex Jones and and
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.520]  trying to make stuff up and trying to conflate things or exaggerate things
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:49.920]  anybody attacking info wars calm and prison planet calm I I don't it doesn't
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:55.200]  hurt me when folks lie about us or make things up or twist things it doesn't hurt
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:58.440]  me in the way that the government operas provocateurs and their camp
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:05.040]  followers think it does it hurts me for them because it really is saddening to
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:10.360]  realize how many people are just so nasty nowadays and you know why things
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.200]  have gotten so nasty because people haven't lived in reality so long they
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:17.560]  just don't have empathy for others I mean if I'm going to say something bad
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:21.760]  about somebody I'm going to do some research about it and I'm going to mean
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:28.000]  it and then it's personal you know it's like emails people will send the most
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.240]  horrible things that emails that in person they never say to somebody see
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:35.040]  whereas I wouldn't send something meaning an email I'd say it personally like
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:39.280]  you like like if I really don't like somebody I'll go find them and I'll
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:45.680]  grab them by the arm and tell them what I think and I just the dishonorableness
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:51.320]  of people nowadays the the shallowness the the it just it's
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:57.840]  nightmarish to think that people are like that because I'm not up on some
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:02.560]  high horse folks I mean I will catch myself thinking bad things or or even
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:06.640]  doing bad things before I've caught myself out of aggression or out of anger
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.480]  or out of hatred but I'm more and more and I'm not up to talk about myself all
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:13.280]  day I'm trying to get you to think about yourself by you know illustrating
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:17.400]  the point that I've got in my life but talking to Ventura Offair you know he
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:22.960]  isn't even mad at Kyle the Navy Seal who said those things that are untrue
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:32.680]  about him he is more saddened and just completely freaked out that somebody
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:39.480]  would dishonor themselves like that and something that you know Jesse you know
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:44.080]  says that he's so proud of underwater demolition teams you know that became
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:52.360]  the seals that that is something that's such a part of his life and to to to see
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:45:00.000]  someone dishonor that whole thing by that to be a mercenary within that
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:07.480]  structure but we can't let evil get us down you know we cannot we cannot do it
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:12.320]  and we have to understand that so many people in this sick narcissistic society
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:20.720]  do not feel fulfilled by a sunset or by a good meal or by seeing an old friend or
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:26.640]  by having a good laugh or or a glass of wine or whatever the case is they they
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:34.280]  are not fulfilled by just good human things normal wholesome good things
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:41.360]  they are so fixated on on television and the psych warfare and all those
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:48.960]  horrible messages that that people see celebrities and they hate them and in
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:54.200]  celebrities in tune hate you and they want to be reclusive and and again I
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:58.760]  talk about this because it's the nature of man it's the nature of our society
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:04.200]  now I've discovered things in my 17 years on air that and it's separately
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:08.560]  reading psychological warfare manuals and psychology manuals and you know
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:14.040]  ever Bernays is a good place to start he wrote propaganda but I mean I've read
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:18.280]  literally probably 50 or more books on the subject to read books and to have
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:22.440]  experienced what these people are talking about in my own life and to know
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:27.960]  its truth but they're writing these books from a perspective for technicians
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:32.880]  and government and corporations to control people instead I'm trying to
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.920]  bring you these things I've discovered that the it's like discovering a
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.040]  restaurant in town didn't mean you you discovered it you know something that
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:44.400]  was self-evident I'm like pointing out something self-evident like don't don't
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:47.960]  just step in that pothole you know you you you'll break your ankle and not
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:54.320]  saying I invented this I discovered it it's all there it's all self-evident and
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:59.120]  to know that the establishment is aware of what they're doing and they're doing
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:04.040]  it and it's ugly it's making people more ugly so no one can stand together
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:09.200]  destroying the family so that there's no one to stand against the global social
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:14.760]  engineers destroying our health so they can control us destroying our fertility
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:22.280]  they are waging war against everything good and they've got programmed masses
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:26.360]  of people now that are artificially like the globalist they just don't have the
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:32.240]  higher knowledge of why they're doing it who revel in seeing other people fall I
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:37.560]  mean number one I'll tell you just seven eight years ago I would get a call
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.800]  from some big rock star or some big movie star or some famous person and they'd

[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:53.760]  good thing about real celebrity is that you get to meet other really interesting
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:57.480]  people because even though celebrity can be plastic and fake a lot of people
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:00.880]  became famous because there's something interesting about them they've got that
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.240]  spark and in person it's much stronger so it is interesting and it's alluring
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:09.000]  and you know there's always beautiful women surrounding it and beautiful
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.960]  places and but it I just want people out there that have never become famous

[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.520]  statement by the TSA and during the break I went and followed the link it is
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:45.520]  confirmed and I feel like we should have a drum roll or something at a certain
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:50.920]  level I actually helped the New World Order when I just calmly report off the

[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.400]  that a civil rights violation isn't that abuse isn't that slavery see they
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:34.640]  define things meanwhile sensational stuff's going on
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:44.480]  sensational and now it's red linked Steve Watson article unbelievable up at
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:50.960]  info wars calm because you know why it's unbelievable it fits into everything
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:56.520]  else and what is it ladies and gentlemen it's not just the Pentagon under
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:00.520]  Obama saying NATO in the UN gives them orders to go to war Congress is not
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:04.520]  involved it's not just Obama saying he'll shut down power plants without
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:08.040]  congressional approval or take guns without a law that's what they call
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:14.560]  dictatorship of the bureaucracy the TSA is telling Congress they will not follow
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:20.640]  subpoenas and that they are not under congressional oversight when Congress
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:29.560]  created the TSA in 2001 October and I guess they think Congress's Congress
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:33.040]  will probably sit there and go along with it because Congress wanted it because
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:37.200]  the foreign banks that took over one us trained that we're prisoners and that
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:40.760]  we're going to have hands put on us that's this is all prisoner induction

[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:54.080]  pick I mean that's about what this is I mean this is a joke this would be like
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.680]  if you showed up in your neighbors when your house just announced it was there
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:02.040]  as I mean it's so over the top man I tell you that I've got to reassess things
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:08.920]  now this is moving way too quick this is the most devastating sign I've seen
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:12.880]  and I've got to collect my thoughts during the break and come back and just
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:17.080]  just give some of the other examples this is this is unbelievable you go to
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:21.600]  info wars comm you can link right through the TSA's website the public
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:36.760]  letter saying that this is unbelievable this is unbelievable and it's just like

[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:45.160]  happened almost a year ago that first happened in January that happened in
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:49.280]  February and March three different hearings eight nine months ago I guess
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:03:02.840]  was the latest 11 months ago the oldest and nothing was done nothing was done and
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:05.680]  those of us that live in reality it's getting pretty cuckoo to watch the rest
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:09.800]  of the public go along with this and it's not fun to get up to these killers
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:13.440]  these criminals and get in their face all reason I'm not dead is because they
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:17.160]  don't want to turn me into a martyr but I mean they're not gonna be not gonna

[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:58.360]  should call Pistolian and they should have him in contempt which means jail

[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:15.320]  billion bullets in the paramilitary force and they've got the wiretaps on

[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:23.960]  highlighting good police officers I've made this a very important directive with
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:31.360]  my reporters that when we find police doing the right thing or doing heroic
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:36.360]  things we want to showcase that as well and model good behavior and we have an
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:39.720]  example of that with our own Jason Burmes who does reporting wars from
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:45.720]  time to time at the what Albany New York and the TSA comes over and says it's
[02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:51.480]  against the law to videotape here they go well it's our policy you can and then
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:55.000]  the sheriff's deputy shows up and says you know it's the first moment right
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.080]  they're allowed to videotape in here as long as they're not interfering with
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:01.960]  what you're doing and they're like but he is interfering look we're over here
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:05.560]  and they go no you're interfering over here that's what they do they make a big
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:13.640]  scene have a big big pity party for themselves like drama queens run over to
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:24.720]  you and then make a big issue out of it it's incredible and Molly we got two
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:28.400]  Molly's back there on the newspaper and in the graphics department but one of
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:30.960]  the Molly's and I'm gonna go back out there whether or not this week or next
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:34.360]  week we're gonna go out there with the whole crew we wanted photos for the
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:38.400]  magazine of surveillance cameras so she went downtown to take photos she's
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:43.080]  lady that takes like the photos you see you know around the office or of t-shirts
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:45.520]  things like that she's a great photographer you know the new photos you've

[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:00.120]  the federal building that's downtown with cameras everywhere and pedestrians
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:03.360]  everywhere and she's out there taking photos and they come out and say you're
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:06.600]  not allowed to do that it's against the law which isn't true courts have ruled
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.720]  hundreds of times literally it's not everybody knows that Supreme Court ruled
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:18.040]  again this week and it's just two days ago on Monday and she says well no I

[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:01.560]  anymore
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:06.400]  nine times out of 10 when I'm out videotaping stuff police don't say
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:11.280]  turn your cameras off but I've had Austin cops many times because I know when

[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:29.560]  really cooking them I'm like I'm not glad they're dying I don't want that bad
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:33.680]  mojo man I'm not glad when anybody dies even really evil people it's like well
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:39.320]  that evil has been a roof in the world but I don't take pleasure in it so you
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:45.680]  know we're sitting here looking at this and it's time to stand up to them in
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:48.960]  fact I think I'm gonna go ahead and fly with my children because you know what
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:52.160]  they have no future down the road if I don't just go ahead and throw them into
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:56.960]  the fray as well you know we've got to stop shying away from a political fight
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:01.760]  with these people because the TSA are just their mindless minions the system
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:05.440]  wants to break your will it's dog training obedience training they admit
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:12.160]  it is it's all a fraud now all of that said we do have that footage and I said
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:17.560]  I'd take some calls the toll-free number to join us is 800 2599231 on any of
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:29.800]  these issues I've raised 800 2599231 800 2599231 but I really got angry at the
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:33.280]  end of the last hour because this is a big deal and people will read the full
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:40.120]  letter and say well they're saying that another that another board has their
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:43.520]  regulatory authority and then they also say they're getting it from the
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:46.560]  president see like they said well we get it from the president and the UN and
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:51.240]  NATO and then we might come to Congress you see how that works and oh well we're
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:54.440]  allowed to shut down power plants that aren't owned by General Electric without
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:58.960]  a law oh we're allowed to come after your guns that's the big headline today
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:02.360]  you know top firearms expert in our a others are coming out they're gonna just
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:06.040]  use orders not not laws orders let that that's what they call it a dick
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:12.560]  Tator they dictate dictation a you know your secretary takes dictation and
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:17.520]  send a thank-you card to Bob Johnson a bomb thank you for the fruitcake look

[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:38.640]  of this and they're saying you know we're not gonna come to these hearings TSA
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:41.640]  claims it is above congressional oversight agency had refused to appear at
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:45.080]  transportation hearing the TSA has refused to attend a house
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:49.440]  transportation hearing this week with agency had John Pistoli who did caught
[02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:51.800]  doing nothing but lying to Congress before he should be in contempt
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:55.680]  personally refusing to appear and declaring that the congressional
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:18:01.880]  committee has no jurisdiction over the TSA the hearing scheduled for Thursday
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:09.000]  will be held by the subcommittee on aviation a part of the house
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:14.240]  transportation infrastructure committee it is titled how best to improve our
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:17.760]  nation's airport passenger security system through common-sense solutions
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:21.600]  well common sense is anathema to tyrants oh it's common sense for tyrants to
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:26.640]  dominate and break everybody's will headed up a representative Thomas
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:32.280]  Petrie I want to get them on it will examine the impact that the regulations
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:35.440]  and policies of the transportation security administration have on aviation
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:39.880]  passenger experience and the free flow of aviation commerce oh no they're gonna
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:45.360]  read all the complains some complaints Adam according to a brief on the
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:52.120]  subcommittees website the TIC's website indicates the TSA head John Pistoli has
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:56.760]  been asked to testify at the hearing however a statement issued by the TSA's
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:02.280]  website made it clear that neither Pistoli nor any TSA official not servant
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:08.280]  official intends to attend the hearing the statement reads by US House of
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:11.200]  Representatives rules which state the Transportation Infrastructure Committee
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:13.840]  has no jurisdiction over transportation security administration no
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:17.560]  representative from TSA will be present at the subcommittee on aviation
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:22.120]  hearing schedule for number 29 so they spin it saying well general Congress
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:25.960]  doesn't only maybe one committee that's how they do this to take the general
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:29.680]  power of the house one member of the house should be able to call anyone they
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:34.920]  want and if you don't come you're in contempt that's that see they don't want
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:38.640]  Congress having any power so just like we have the state stand up and demand the
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:43.240]  globalist be kicked out we need to have Congress that's the whole move stand up
[02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:47.080]  and kick out the Federal Reserve stand up and tell Obama you're not shutting
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:50.320]  down our power plants you're not going after the guns you're not gonna just
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:53.320]  ban all semi-autos and say it's a rule-making thing which they're getting
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:57.800]  ready to do that's in the news today you know you're not Congress better do it
[02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:04.040]  they better do it live back a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:07.880]  research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still
[02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:12.320]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:15.240]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:19.520]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:20.960]  play amazing video of the bureaucrats ordering police to basically arrest or
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.760]  drag out people in the front four-year area of the Albany Airport and the
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:28.800]  police are just like they have constitutional right we can't do that
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:34.560]  they're not up at your checkpoint they're not interfering and you can then see
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:39.320]  the head guy go I've got I'm getting the CEO of the transportation group that
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:43.040]  runs this on the phone the police are like well okay they'll probably have
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:48.640]  those cops fired I mean that's it that's how this works he goes the CEO well my
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:53.280]  goodness is somebody says CEO I mean if somebody showed up and said put your
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:58.960]  child in a blender CEO oh certainly CEO let me just just immediately if
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:02.960]  somebody in a suit says something I I'd better do whatever they say right now
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:07.280]  the government says some shadowy government spy on people without warrants
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:11.680]  yes sir that's illegal but I'll do that the government says torture these people
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:16.560]  and when you get caught doing it we'll send you to jail let's see they can
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:20.400]  always find scum the globalists admit this is a process they just want to
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.880]  find out of the good cops I was gonna get rid of them and hire criminals and
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:27.040]  that's the conversion to tyranny we're facing problem is they can't find enough
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:30.240]  criminals that can pass the test and things so now they're just creating the
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:33.560]  TSA Hitler did it Stalin did it they just create a
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:37.200]  goon force because there's always the police academies and military academies
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:40.320]  that have spree to core who don't want to be corrupt because they know it's
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:45.880]  dishonorable any old institution knows that so they're always at odds with the
[02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:50.400]  thug group the government hires that's what's happening right now let's go
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:53.640]  ahead and go to Aaron in Canada Aaron you're on the air thank you for calling
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:59.440]  in today how may I serve you hey how's it going out Jones good hey I know I was
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:03.040]  just saying you're talking about the TSA today and I'm really concerned is
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:08.840]  because up here in Canada we have Katza the CATSA and all this whole topic that
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:14.520]  you've been on this today I called them to see if I could film them and no you're
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:19.080]  not allowed to film them they actually can take your video I mean I mean they
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:21.600]  could actually take you and put you in a pit and shoot in the back of the head if
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:25.800]  we let them do it I mean government with uniforms is always extremely dangerous
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:30.240]  as George Washington said government like fire is a dangerous servant and a
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:34.280]  fearful master you know it's like fire it's very dangerous and of course they
[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:38.360]  will tell you and I've checked at Canada you're the law is you can film there to
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:41.480]  the of course they're going to tell you pretty soon they're going to tell you
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:46.560]  that you're their slave sorry go ahead no right yeah right I called I called them
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:51.760]  myself personally you're actually allowed to ask request a police officer to
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:55.240]  come in with you while they private search you you can refuse the body
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:59.600]  scanners you can do all that but they told me that I'm not allowed to film
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:04.880]  them I called the BC civil liberties to tell them this and I said this pretty
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:08.120]  much goes against my constitutional a little charter rights and freedoms in
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:14.600]  Canada and they told me yep sure does so I mean it's the answer is go be polite
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:19.280]  film them sue them yeah we're not looking for trouble but we're not your
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:24.160]  slaves you either fight for freedom now peacefully with every avenue or it's
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:27.800]  going to get physical and don't worry they're going to start it I mean I know
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:31.200]  tyranny it's like a local motive coming down on us we either put the brakes on
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:35.320]  this thing or we have to deal with these people absolutely I'm going to go fly
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:39.400]  the back to where my hometown is from where I am right now and I'm a film and
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:42.520]  I don't care what happens I'm gonna refuse the body scanner I'm gonna go in
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:45.760]  there with filming and see what happens because I'm not gonna just gonna just
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:50.240]  gonna give up I mean it takes police officers three years to train you can
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:54.760]  film them in Canada but I don't like it probably takes two weeks for a cat's up
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:59.640]  authority to train and you can't film them I mean where's the sense in that
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:03.240]  they just say you can't that's what tyranny is government says you know
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:08.320]  you're paying 50% one former tax that's not enough that's 60 how about 70 how
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:13.160]  about 80 the average bureaucrats making about $200,000 a year in Europe I mean
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:19.160]  dog catcher level and the public is going bankrupt I mean it's all coming
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:23.640]  here man they're going to destroy us they're going to destroy us great points

[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:41.560]  we were talking to Phil and Mass. Phil start over he was saying people from
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:47.080]  Czech Republic people from Romania people from Poland I mean I run into
[02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:51.600]  these folks they're listeners and they're absolutely and plus I've studied
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:56.360]  those countries this is Sovietism that's not really communism the globalists
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:34:00.800]  just use the Soviet model of regional government committees I mean this is
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:06.320]  communism but again the globalists are exempt from it and so how you battle
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:10.000]  communists is how you battle these people they are your enemies even their
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:15.200]  low-level operatives are evil and people need to get to grips with this I mean
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:18.840]  the mindless you know mainline liberal they mean well there's a lot of bad
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:22.840]  stuff about the mainline conservatives they're part of the system as well the
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:26.080]  average low-level liberal is not a bad person they actually believe that the
[02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:30.320]  propaganda they're very childlike but you go a couple steps above that they are
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:37.000]  vicious control freaks vicious people I've studied their MO they hate your
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.160]  wealth they hate strong people they're evil they're inherently the scum of the
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:46.120]  earth and they they relish government power over you and they've got to be
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:50.880]  dealt with I mean I just keep trying to explain this they're mortal enemies it
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:54.840]  would be like having a 15-foot king cub or living in your house and you're like
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:58.280]  oh I think I'm gonna be nice to the King Cobra folks you better get the King
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:02.560]  Cobra out of your house one way or another okay they're a barrel of snakes
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:08.480]  I'm sorry finish the point about Eastern Europeans you know that that that are not
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:13.200]  going along with tyranny go ahead okay well he came he told me one story in
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:18.360]  particular which was there was a man and he his security camera outside of his
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:22.680]  house filmed a robbery of his home and they caught the robbers and the
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:27.000]  perpetrators but then he got fined because they are so obsessed with
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:33.240]  privacy now that because his camera was facing out and viewed part of the street
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:40.600]  they are that obsessed and they reject the snoop society to that extreme you're
[02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:45.680]  not allowed to infringe on anybody's privacy in any way there's a whole host
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:51.760]  of laws in Czech Republic to prevent that you know that's why I work with
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:55.280]  start page you know they're from the Netherlands a lot of those people you
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:59.000]  know had their families disappear and and and know what to knock on the door
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:03.360]  about and and and dealt with you know when your grandma dealt with tattletales
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:08.360]  who got off on power trips making stuff up about you you get to where you hate
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:13.080]  snitches and don't worry America's gonna hate them too we're gonna get hurt bad
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:17.480]  folks I mean it's gonna be bad really like to make one more quick point is
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:23.880]  there any way that someone can start an association for journalism 2.0 so that
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:27.320]  people know when they have when they're a whistleblower they have somewhere to go
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:32.360]  they can go to a journalist that subscribes to the morals and values or
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:37.000]  actually just the regular old standards for journalism because it's just lost
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:42.400]  it's almost like like you know Amber Lyon or yourself or try even Joe Rogan
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:46.840]  but journalism 2.0 needs to be like a standard that you can wear like a badge
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:51.360]  of honor and that if you're not wearing it or you don't subscribe to it you're
[02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:56.400]  just entertainment or propaganda like I can only just you know having that
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:01.640]  stamp it almost needs to be an association like something real I like
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:05.280]  I'm not here he has just a lot of individuals won't get involved with that
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:08.280]  because they they they're such individuals and then someone in the
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:12.520]  group may make them look bad but but I hear you and I appreciate your call you
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:16.200]  know I hate you just keep plugging it but it's just so good drudgereport.com
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:19.760]  I mean something like that is the system hates that because it's not only the
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:24.400]  biggest news side out there it can set the agenda and it's not an agenda the
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:30.960]  establishment wants if we beat the TSA their whole thing falls and they know
[02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:35.600]  that if we beat them on any of this stuff it's over we beat them on the
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:41.560]  marijuana issue and states rights it's over we have any victories it's over and
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:46.160]  by the way the gun thing we're winning they're now again up to 5 million gun
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:49.160]  a month being sold I mean used to the previous record was a million a couple
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:54.280]  years ago had another 5 million month last numbers I saw and that's that's
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:59.920]  just estimating the gun shows on top of the registered sales I mean there just
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:05.320]  comes down to an issue of we're not turning them in scumbags and all the
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:08.360]  liberals are running out buying guns now figuring out that the government isn't
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:10.960]  going to protect them and as soon as you start shooting a gun you're no longer
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:16.440]  a chicken neck coward I mean literally folks you know to use the parable
[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:20.000]  vampires go out and bite people to make more vampires we've got to go out and
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:25.120]  get liberals deprogrammed and get them to go out and shoot guns get them to you
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:28.480]  know we've got to get them out that's why they want you all in big cities and
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:33.600]  cocoons totally coward being mugged all day so you're afraid of everything they
[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:37.240]  do not want you getting your feet dirty out there in the out there with the
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:41.320]  garden they do not want you in a rural area they do not want you free they do
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:47.280]  not want that they want domesticated cowards who when they want money or want
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:50.280]  something they have to think of a bigger government benefit or as a
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:53.960]  bureaucrat they've got to grow the bureaucracy to grow their empire instead
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:39:01.440]  of growing it in the real world iron head in Washington you're on the head
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:05.600]  you iron head you're on the you're on the use of the bathroom iron head from
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:08.440]  Washington's why I said you're on the head you're on the air go ahead
[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:12.920]  hey there my friend how you doing I'm good man I really miss Bob Chapman that
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:19.760]  he was a he was a great great a great head to be a communing with but what I'm
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:24.480]  wondering we're missing something here we're trying to take ourself what was it
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:29.960]  Einstein said that no problem can be addressed at the same level which it's
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:34.320]  addressed at our consciousness is what has to change we're coming to the point
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:40.600]  where they've read on the duty of civil disobedience by Thoreau one of the
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:44.600]  great all-time ups in the back of Walden's pond we're coming to the point
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:49.200]  where instead of problem reaction solution they're using our fear to
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:53.460]  control us and I know what you're saying identify the problem but go straight
[02:39:53.460 --> 02:39:58.440]  from problem no reaction straight to solution no no no I hear you but some
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:03.680]  people say just don't have fear I don't even want to call it fear it's if you
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:06.720]  know a dam is about to break and you get your family out of the area because
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:09.560]  it's cracking and and and you know it's about to break you're not living in
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:14.080]  fear you're protecting yourself people should be very concerned about not
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:18.440]  fighting back I get that a lot of people are scared so they don't fight back they
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:23.240]  think they'll just stay out of the way that is that is not the way to go right
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:26.200]  and that's where the empowerment from within comes as I said before fear is
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:30.200]  the ultimate sin or displays the greatest lack of faith once you find that
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:35.320]  conviction minus emotional positionality go straight at the problem
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:39.960]  identify it and as the last few callers and especially like yesterday with the
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:44.120]  start page folks that are they you know go straight to the problem don't and
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:47.480]  this one I'm trying to say is about raising our consciousness level to a
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:51.680]  higher because they love our fear they monitor every single inch of what's
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:56.960]  going on and as long as we can step out of the emotional positionality and go
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:41:01.760]  straight to the problem and then identify a solution which brings up a good
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:05.600]  point where so whereas want to call in for a long time I have a great idea once
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:11.560]  a month once a week once a day once an hour instead of ask Alex have ask the
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:15.560]  Warriors have a special show where you can get one of the main reasons I've
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:19.040]  been listening for umpteen years my 91 year old mom who's listening to you
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:23.120]  right now one of the things we love is when you bring on people who have
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:28.120]  cogent cognitive good points and let them just run with the show for like
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:32.280]  10 minutes have a have an interactive no it's a great idea I also want to open
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:36.600]  the phones up for an hour or two here and there for people that have lived in
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:41.120]  authoritarian countries so they can call in and make the parallels because they
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:45.200]  always call and say I have seen this before you are in danger please there's
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:49.800]  nowhere else to go I love America do not let it happen here no I mean it's always
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:53.400]  the same whether they're from Eastern Europe or the Middle East or Africa or
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:57.120]  Latin America they're so happy to be here and to know there's some basic
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:02.640]  freedom and to see it going away oh man they're freaked out and we've got we've
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:06.720]  got to point out the evil and say it's wrong I appreciate your points we're
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:09.800]  gonna go back to your calls and some other news but let me play the way a cop
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:14.240]  shouldn't act this article and video is up at prison planet calm it's move and
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:19.440]  die cop labeled embarrassing by police department officer Arnold also
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:23.280]  threatened business owner during traffic stop we've had to bleep things out
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:28.160]  here but this is how this is in Texas this is how a police officer should not
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:32.280]  act because I see so many cops now who have a crazed look in their eye and you
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:37.280]  know their wimp punks who got into that position because they feel powerless and
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:41.560]  now they've gotten used to acting like that you know and and so they're out of
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:47.400]  control and you know with great power comes great responsibility and they
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:52.520]  really are hiring a lot of dums dumb down nobodies and the police department
[02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:56.520]  shouldn't be doing that you he will get a bad name and you will be hated by the
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:43:02.560]  community and there's a big fight for the soul of policing going on in this
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:05.760]  country and we've got to be there to try to help things go in the right
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:08.440]  direction and not let the globalist federalize things and turn the police
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:13.640]  into a TSA goon force but here is the clip with the cussing bleeped here it
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:21.760]  is Andrew Andrew he said all right hey he said all right man you can't breathe
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:32.040]  please he says he can't breathe hey bro just let him go Andrew chill Andrew
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:45.800]  relax you got someone not resisting clearly you got a cop choking him we've
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:48.240]  all since where they kill somebody pinning them down and they're getting
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:52.520]  off on it the other cop runs up another it looks like a total wimp runs like a
[02:43:52.520 --> 02:44:01.600]  fairy and jumps on them I mean it's just so ridiculous jumping on people because
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:05.400]  you were a wimp your whole life and now you get to play the part of Rambo I mean
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:09.600]  I'm just it just makes me sick because you never see a big tough mean looking
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:13.400]  cop doing stuff like this it's always these these wimps it's just because
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:17.960]  they're wimps police department should not be hiring wimps because wimps act
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:27.760]  like punks let's let's go back to these guys moving die are you serious
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:37.120]  get up get over here I'm just saying I'm just saying nothing else there wasn't
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:41.840]  nothing necessary for you listen to all these people talk by the way that's a
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:59.800]  minor can you imagine the incredibly and the police now admit the guy didn't
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:02.080]  resist and they're probably gonna get rid of one of them or they're on
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:06.480]  suspension but the point is can you imagine if your ego wanting to dominate
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:12.160]  somebody chained up oh that's really powerful I mean that that guy must feel
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:16.440]  good all day doing that look that those people should not be having anyone
[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:22.360]  under them at McDonald's who have attitudes like this these are the type
[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:26.240]  of cops you see all the time that hold people down until they suffocate let's
[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:35.480]  finish up the video you are you too you move you want to shoot in you got it on
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:44.520]  tape Arnold 654 654 got it right there bro move you
[02:45:44.520 --> 02:46:00.880]  it's not my phone that's enough that's enough that's enough I mean this is
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:04.000]  mild compared to a lot of the stuff we see but I thought I'd play that and then
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.160]  I thought I would integrate it in with shocker police officer defense the first
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:12.800]  amendment this is with Jason Burmese and crew at the Albany Airport and they're
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:18.040]  way back from the scanners and they've got the head you know of the of the
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:22.040]  airport authority there who has the private contract saying you can't tape
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:25.160]  here it's our policy this is our private building no it's paid for by
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:29.480]  taxpayers that's why the TSA on their own site says you're allowed to film they'll
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:33.520]  come over and say you're disrupting he's gonna laugh at him and go listen before
[02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:37.760]  you drama queen the Supreme Court's ruled it's all ruled here's your own site
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:41.640]  you know we can we did this with the NSA a few weeks ago in San Antonio they
[02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:45.840]  usually grab the cameras from the mainstream TV stations they didn't do a
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:50.000]  dust because we go here's the court suit you just lost in in Maryland over this
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:55.480]  and they're like okay well you can go then again we're the boss not you we're
[02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:58.920]  not all criminals and then your jail guards and then we just give you money
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:03.520]  now now let's go to this Albany sheriff's deputy who's told get rid of them the
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:07.640]  guy winks at him he goes I can't and you could see the airport guy bow up to the
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:10.440]  cop you know that cops gonna they're gonna try to get him in trouble we got
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:15.560]  to follow us up we've got to also stand behind good police who because it's your
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:22.080]  job to protect my rights not your job to have some bureaucrat tell you to arrest
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:26.840]  people here is the report from Albany I was just talking to the CEO of the
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:34.960]  airport and he's from what he relayed to me he doesn't see a problem with you
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:40.440]  filming okay he's just he's just has a problem with the handing out of flyers
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:44.400]  that's the whole point of the campaign and I know I understand that and like I
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:48.600]  said I would I would relay that information to you okay and if you're
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:59.880]  okay they're on their way up to a line you know they have the opportunity to
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:03.240]  read it there right and again you know again I'm here to cover man this is
[02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:06.680]  this is very good next door please and fill out a form I will not come next
[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:12.400]  door there's no you're videotaping commercially no it's not commercial you
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:15.280]  already told us it was going to be on the drudge report so that's commercial
[02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:19.960]  actually they know you already say news it's a news aggregate yeah let's stop
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:24.840]  right there again drudge carries a lot of the stuff so I don't know why they're
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:27.200]  bringing up drudge report but but obviously that you know I'm sure they're
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:30.800]  asking what will what type of media is this song well you know TSA is being
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:33.480]  followed by the drudge report has asked Bermas about that and they go on to say
[02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:39.960]  info wars but the point here is that again Bermas used to work here a few
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:43.520]  years ago he lives up in New York now he shot this video and he's sitting there
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:47.240]  and the cops saying well the CEO just said please don't hand out flyers then
[02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:52.600]  this other guy you know who's the head of the airport operations he's then
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:57.040]  saying you have your insurance policy and this is the new way all of this is
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:02.400]  going that oh you want to walk down the street I have an insurance policy oh you
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:05.600]  you got to have government health care insurance policy this is how they're
[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:08.600]  engaging in this tyranny we're gonna skip this break because this is so
[02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:12.760]  important let's continue going back to this video here it is let me see you

[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:33.800]  over a thousand times there's no failure to ID they still arrest people for it
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:38.320]  and here is this guy trying to henpeck at them and they're down the escalator
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:42.200]  they're not even up in the area trying to educate people about naked body
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:47.400]  scanners and their right to opt out and their right to film but they want to

[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:22.320]  for even less than the aggregate so it's all all right there I guess they've
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:25.520]  gone up on the 10 pack to 1995 because they cost more because they're it's now

[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:52.960]  doing let's just jam in Gary in New York Gary thanks for holding real quick
[03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:58.080]  what's on your mind what's going on Mr. Jones my comment is kind of
[03:02:58.080 --> 03:03:02.080]  indirectly associated with the the tearing it out well but it has to do with
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:06.920]  the end of the world I don't think it's it's the end of the world per se but I
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:12.080]  think there's multiple scenarios that that might end the world as we know it
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:19.440]  like I call it the Gaelian dialectic 2012 the least on the federal reserve I
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:24.040]  believe and on December 21st yeah but they've said they're extending it as
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:27.640]  though it you know go ahead okay now I was gonna say cuz like when the
[03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:32.640]  Williams always says that these guys are think tanks and besides returning war
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:37.840]  veterans constitutionalist libertarians and people who were capable of
[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:43.520]  critical thinking one of their biggest enemies are Christian and it wouldn't
[03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:50.560]  surprise me if there was some false flag EMP strike or an outcater terrorists
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:53.280]  who trained oh no no no I mean I mean the globalist could blow everything up
[03:03:53.280 --> 03:03:56.680]  with their head and collider anytime I just don't put stock that it's December
[03:03:56.680 --> 03:04:03.400]  21st I don't either but it wouldn't surprise me with all these false flag
[03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:08.880]  attacks over the history that you know they might do something kind of
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:13.280]  suspicious to create that that type of fear and to create more superstition
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:16.440]  yeah I mean there's no telling there's no you're I think you're right I'm not
[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:20.080]  saying people are bad that think there's something to 2012 I'm just saying I don't
[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:22.360]  think it's the end of the world the Mayans didn't say that either that's all
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:28.480]  I'm saying and I agree with that but the way that is evil we think it wouldn't
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:33.640]  surprise me if something like that occurred just to create the kind of
[03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:38.800]  fear that they want to ultimately take us all over as far as control goes now
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:41.920]  here you great point sorry to the other callers we're out of time retransmission
[03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:45.880]  starts now with a lot of powerful info on the first hour with Paul Watson and the
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:50.720]  Manchurian candidate it's in mainstream news more and more James Holmes the
[03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:55.040]  evidence is clear is a Manchurian candidate to get our guns and Obama is
[03:04:55.040 --> 03:04:59.320]  moving towards outside of law banning all your semi-autos get ready to turn
[03:04:59.320 --> 03:05:24.640]  those in or to resist
