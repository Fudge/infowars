[00:30.000 --> 00:41.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are on this Friday, the 28th day of September 2018, 39
[00:41.840 --> 00:45.920]  days out from this incredibly historic critical election.
[00:45.920 --> 00:51.840]  And you have seen the hysteria, the deception, the lies, the leaking, the fraud, the doxing,
[00:51.840 --> 00:58.120]  all of it from the Democrats on display with KABITOM, and here's the big breaking news.
[00:58.120 --> 01:02.960]  of last night with Town Hall, and as of today with Reuters and Politico and others, they're
[01:02.960 --> 01:09.360]  having to admit it right now, the Republicans have the votes in the U.S. Senate to seat
[01:09.360 --> 01:12.640]  KABINAW on the Supreme Court.
[01:12.640 --> 01:20.320]  But it's very, very important for people to understand that they are only trying to pile
[01:20.320 --> 01:25.840]  more garbage on and intensify the crises and that no one's ever going to get confirmed
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.840]  after this.
[01:26.840 --> 01:32.080]  If we put up with this type of destruction of due process, this destruction of innocent
[01:32.080 --> 01:38.320]  until proven guilty, if you go back and look at previous confirmation votes by Republicans
[01:38.320 --> 01:44.640]  for Democrat members of the Supreme Court, you're talking 70, 80, 90 percent of the Republicans
[01:44.640 --> 01:45.640]  voting to confirm.
[01:45.640 --> 01:50.480]  And it's the Democrats going back to Robert Bork always trying to obstruct and block, but
[01:50.480 --> 01:57.760]  now they're voting 100 percent along party lines against KABINAW, they've said they are,
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.640]  and it's disgusting their double standards.
[01:59.640 --> 02:04.080]  You have Bill Clinton and others involved in real sex crimes, pedophilia, raping, you
[02:04.080 --> 02:05.080]  name it.
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.200]  I mean, we're talking about Lolita Express aircraft, we're talking about little girls,
[02:09.200 --> 02:18.880]  we're talking about rape islands, and then, oh my gosh, 36 years ago, Brett KABINAW is
[02:18.880 --> 02:23.800]  this big, giant, evil demon.
[02:23.800 --> 02:27.240]  Brett KABINAW is the worst person on earth.
[02:27.240 --> 02:31.400]  Somebody fell on a bed 36 years ago, but then he can't even prove it and all the witnesses
[02:31.400 --> 02:34.400]  say, what is being said, is it true?
[02:34.400 --> 02:42.360]  And it turns out that Sheila Jackson Lee was handing stationery to the lawyer, the Deep
[02:42.360 --> 02:49.200]  State lawyer for Ms. Ford, Dr. Ford, who is also the lawyer for the Deep State heads
[02:49.200 --> 02:52.800]  of the FBI and deputy head of the FBI, like Andy McCabe.
[02:52.800 --> 02:56.120]  It turns out that's not a payoff.
[02:56.120 --> 02:57.360]  They say it was stationery.
[02:57.360 --> 02:58.960]  I'm sure it's true.
[02:58.960 --> 03:08.320]  What about the $750,000 in counting that she's raised on just two different crowd funding
[03:08.320 --> 03:09.320]  situations?
[03:09.320 --> 03:11.040]  Which, okay, great.
[03:11.040 --> 03:15.080]  You go and you make this unsubstantiated claim, she'll probably raise $2-3 million by the
[03:15.080 --> 03:20.880]  time this is all over, but they won't even let info wars on any of the Patreon or the
[03:20.880 --> 03:24.840]  Kickstart or any of it, or really any other conservatives for that matter.
[03:24.840 --> 03:27.640]  This is the racketeering we've seen.
[03:27.640 --> 03:32.440]  Just like it's come out, the Justice Department and the IRS is still targeting Christians
[03:32.440 --> 03:37.000]  and conservatives for harassment, and the latest Project Veritas undercover video is
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.600]  them talking about at the IRS how they persecute Christians and conservatives and Trump supporters.
[03:43.600 --> 03:48.900]  This is an outrageous group of people hell-bent on bullying and dominating.
[03:48.900 --> 03:52.400]  This is gang warfare.
[03:52.400 --> 03:55.960]  They are the individuals that have hijacked the institutions and have run up the flags
[03:55.960 --> 03:58.400]  of piracy against us.
[03:58.400 --> 04:02.760]  So when we come back, Lindsey Graham, I've had big problems with because he's a creature
[04:02.760 --> 04:08.520]  of John McCain, but he's gotten so much better since McCain made the jump into hyperspace
[04:08.520 --> 04:13.280]  or Hades, you take your pick, and he was on fire yesterday, he's been the strongest
[04:13.280 --> 04:14.280]  so far.
[04:14.280 --> 04:16.200]  Ted Cruz just finished speaking.
[04:16.200 --> 04:17.720]  We're going to have that for you on the other side.
[04:17.720 --> 04:19.480]  David Knight's going to be joining us.
[04:19.480 --> 04:21.360]  We're going to have Roger Stone coming up later.
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.560]  We're going to obviously have Owen Schreuer riding shotgun with me, and then of course,
[04:25.560 --> 04:27.640]  Nick Baggage will be on during the fourth hour.
[04:27.640 --> 04:30.560]  Always loved under Nick Baggage, but if the vote's going on then, because we're not sure
[04:30.560 --> 04:32.560]  what's going to happen today, we're going to have to preempt that because we're going
[04:32.560 --> 04:33.960]  to have coverage of this.
[04:33.960 --> 04:36.120]  You can tune in to these local stations.
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.720]  You can tune in to infowars.com, and you're going to get Cabinot coverage, and you're
[04:40.720 --> 04:44.920]  going to get coverage of the Chai comms, trying to start a war on the South China Sea, and
[04:44.920 --> 04:45.920]  you're going to get it all.
[04:45.920 --> 04:49.560]  Now, whatever you do, remember, the scumbags are trying to shut us down or waging war on
[04:49.560 --> 04:53.960]  info wars, so it's an act of defiance and pure Americana, and defense of liberty when
[04:53.960 --> 05:00.560]  you spread newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, and infowars.com.
[05:00.560 --> 05:04.360]  Me and Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[05:04.360 --> 05:08.920]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[05:08.920 --> 05:14.320]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[05:14.320 --> 05:19.720]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[05:19.720 --> 05:21.240]  to unhealthy levels.
[05:21.240 --> 05:27.760]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[05:27.760 --> 05:31.760]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[05:31.760 --> 05:33.080]  in the rainwater.
[05:33.080 --> 05:38.480]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[05:38.480 --> 05:44.560]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.560 --> 05:50.160]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[05:50.160 --> 05:55.520]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.520 --> 06:03.200]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:03.200 --> 06:05.880]  Waging War on Corruption.
[06:05.880 --> 06:30.800]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:30.800 --> 06:37.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide with 39 days out from the midterms.
[06:37.880 --> 06:39.000]  Right now, it could change.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.720]  The Republicans have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
[06:42.720 --> 06:47.160]  The Democrats are never going to let him get confirmed if they wait any longer.
[06:47.160 --> 06:51.280]  They'll have a hundred more women, 500 women, a thousand women.
[06:51.280 --> 06:56.360]  They'll have sports stadiums with a hundred thousand all saying that he blew their brains
[06:56.360 --> 06:57.360]  out.
[06:57.360 --> 06:59.640]  I mean, it'll just be insane.
[06:59.640 --> 07:02.000]  They try to get Barrett in.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.360]  They'll say she wears cat lady outfits and rapes women with bullwebs and is a vampire.
[07:07.360 --> 07:10.880]  I mean, they're not going to stop, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:10.880 --> 07:14.760]  They are using the IRS to still persecute Christians and conservatives.
[07:14.760 --> 07:16.960]  Project Veritas got undercover video of that.
[07:16.960 --> 07:23.320]  They are doxing members of Congress and their families right now.
[07:23.320 --> 07:27.640]  And you can do a search on Wikipedia to see where it was updated from.
[07:27.640 --> 07:31.920]  They are doxing members of the Senate who are pro-Kavanaugh and their families, their
[07:31.920 --> 07:38.440]  wives, their homes, their phone numbers, their addresses from the House of Representatives.
[07:38.440 --> 07:45.120]  So inside the other side of the Capitol building, insiders are their doxing people.
[07:45.120 --> 07:47.040]  This is what terrorism is.
[07:47.040 --> 07:49.280]  They are terrorizing everyone.
[07:49.280 --> 07:51.160]  They are bullying everyone.
[07:51.160 --> 07:53.080]  They're saying go out in public.
[07:53.080 --> 07:56.880]  And if they're associated with Trump, don't let them eat in restaurants.
[07:56.880 --> 07:58.320]  Don't let them go to the mall.
[07:58.320 --> 08:04.440]  You get in their face in a mob and you run their ass out of there.
[08:04.440 --> 08:08.160]  The Democratic Party is a sellout party to the Communist Chinese and others.
[08:08.160 --> 08:11.160]  Their religion is hating America and hating unborn.
[08:11.160 --> 08:14.080]  They are a legion of evil.
[08:14.080 --> 08:17.360]  They are conscious lying criminals.
[08:17.360 --> 08:22.000]  They have radicalized the party, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.480]  Because fish rot from the head down.
[08:24.480 --> 08:28.080]  It's not that I watched a two-hour documentary about Stalin and already knew about it, but
[08:28.080 --> 08:31.960]  just to watch it and see it how evil the communists were and how much they enjoyed hurting poor
[08:31.960 --> 08:37.240]  Christians and stealing their land and their property and murdering them and just how much
[08:37.240 --> 08:40.080]  they enjoyed it because they hated God.
[08:40.080 --> 08:43.440]  And Stalin said, I serve Lucifer.
[08:43.440 --> 08:44.960]  I worship the devil.
[08:44.960 --> 08:49.320]  And people always said, oh, he's just joking and he said, no.
[08:49.320 --> 08:50.320]  I believe in God.
[08:50.320 --> 08:55.120]  I believe in the devil and he's given me power and I'm going to kill people.
[08:55.120 --> 08:56.120]  And V.I.
[08:56.120 --> 08:58.200]  Lenin was a devil worshiper as well.
[08:58.200 --> 09:02.120]  So he'd understand, ladies and gentlemen, that these people mean business and they hate
[09:02.120 --> 09:03.960]  you and your family.
[09:03.960 --> 09:06.920]  And communists in this country went and set up V.I.
[09:06.920 --> 09:10.920]  Lenin and Stalin.
[09:10.920 --> 09:15.240]  That was leftist creation out of America.
[09:15.240 --> 09:17.520]  And they want to do that to you and your family.
[09:17.520 --> 09:19.520]  Make no mistake.
[09:19.520 --> 09:24.160]  Their religion is literally raping your wife and children in front of you and then working
[09:24.160 --> 09:26.880]  you to death and then shooting you in the back of the head.
[09:26.880 --> 09:32.480]  That's where Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and Michael Moore and George Soros want to
[09:32.480 --> 09:34.600]  take you.
[09:34.600 --> 09:39.240]  Look at Antifa beating up women and children.
[09:39.240 --> 09:40.440]  It's who they are.
[09:40.440 --> 09:43.360]  They have a hunger for your life.
[09:43.360 --> 09:44.880]  They want to dominate you.
[09:44.880 --> 09:49.840]  Now, here's the incredible news and there's so much of it.
[09:49.840 --> 09:50.840]  Bombshell.
[09:50.840 --> 09:54.280]  Senate prosecutor says she briefed the senators last night.
[09:54.280 --> 09:57.280]  She wouldn't charge Kavanaugh or even pursue a search warrant.
[09:57.280 --> 09:58.800]  She said it's totally incredible.
[09:58.800 --> 09:59.800]  There's no witnesses.
[09:59.800 --> 10:01.720]  None of the story adds up.
[10:01.720 --> 10:08.680]  The whole thing is disintegrated and that she wouldn't even get near a court with this.
[10:08.680 --> 10:14.600]  Continuing with support for key GOP senator, Judiciary Committee sets favorable vote for
[10:14.600 --> 10:19.760]  Kavanaugh in B.C. News and they're set to vote sometime later today.
[10:19.760 --> 10:25.040]  That is, of course, now getting more and more of the key holdover Republicans to say they're
[10:25.040 --> 10:28.840]  getting on board like Jeff Flake, Republican Arizona.
[10:28.840 --> 10:31.680]  So maybe he can redeem himself.
[10:31.680 --> 10:36.480]  Tears and raw fury, Kavanaugh hearing makes for riveting television.
[10:36.480 --> 10:37.480]  We're going to play some of the highlights.
[10:37.480 --> 10:39.840]  I thought he was very credible.
[10:39.840 --> 10:45.800]  No Kavanaugh decries circus and maintains innocence as fortessifies, he sexually assaulted
[10:45.800 --> 10:49.320]  me.
[10:49.320 --> 10:54.200]  Men are trash versus I stand with Brett Wild seam at the Capitol for Kavanaugh drama.
[10:54.200 --> 10:55.200]  That is Politico.
[10:55.200 --> 10:57.960]  We'll get to those videos.
[10:57.960 --> 10:59.360]  And so much more.
[10:59.360 --> 11:01.840]  Senator Bob Corker to vote yes on Kavanaugh.
[11:01.840 --> 11:05.360]  Nothing cooperates the allegations.
[11:05.360 --> 11:07.160]  You see what's happening?
[11:07.160 --> 11:11.520]  Lindsey Graham is chased down the hall, screamed at, yelled at, frothed at, like these women
[11:11.520 --> 11:12.760]  want to kill him.
[11:12.760 --> 11:14.560]  No one's calling for them to be arrested or thrown out.
[11:14.560 --> 11:15.680]  I'm not either.
[11:15.680 --> 11:21.240]  But I talked one-tenth as aggressively to CNN reporters and Marco Rubio and mainstream
[11:21.240 --> 11:25.880]  media said I should be taken off the air everywhere and I should be banned from the Capitol because
[11:25.880 --> 11:28.520]  I dare walk up and ask a few tough questions.
[11:28.520 --> 11:33.600]  Again, just shows how these people are out of control and as I mentioned Republican senators
[11:33.600 --> 11:38.560]  doxxed by someone in house shortly after questioning Kavanaugh.
[11:38.560 --> 11:40.160]  It's all coming up.
[11:40.160 --> 11:45.520]  But first, let's go to Senator Cruz just minutes ago.
[11:45.520 --> 11:46.520]  Here it is.
[11:46.520 --> 11:51.640]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[11:51.640 --> 11:55.000]  We're living in a divided time.
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.480]  This country is divided right down the middle.
[11:58.480 --> 12:01.920]  There is an enormous amount of anger.
[12:01.920 --> 12:04.040]  There's rage.
[12:04.040 --> 12:06.640]  There's hatred.
[12:06.640 --> 12:14.280]  We see demonstrators screaming at each other, reflecting that rage, reflecting that anger.
[12:14.280 --> 12:22.560]  And I know there are great many Americans who wish we could and believe we can get back
[12:22.560 --> 12:27.160]  to an environment where we treat each other with civility and decency.
[12:27.160 --> 12:31.120]  Get back to an environment where yes, we have policy disagreements.
[12:31.120 --> 12:34.640]  We disagree on what the right legislation is to pass.
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.080]  And we even have vigorous debates about what the right policy is.
[12:39.080 --> 12:45.680]  But we do so in a context that respects each other, that doesn't demean the humanity of
[12:45.680 --> 12:55.280]  each other, that doesn't attack the character and drag people through the mud.
[12:55.280 --> 13:03.840]  The politics of personal destruction that we have seen on display in recent days is
[13:03.840 --> 13:08.680]  Washington, D.C., and it's very ugliest.
[13:08.680 --> 13:13.680]  And all of us should remember that we're talking about real human beings here.
[13:13.680 --> 13:15.480]  These aren't pawns and a chessboard.
[13:15.480 --> 13:17.200]  These are real people.
[13:17.200 --> 13:21.760]  Dr. Ford has been through hell.
[13:21.760 --> 13:31.120]  The last two weeks I have no doubt have been extraordinarily painful for her, for her family.
[13:31.120 --> 13:33.440]  The testimony she gave yesterday was powerful.
[13:33.440 --> 13:36.120]  And the millions of dollars she's raising, you know, it's terrible.
[13:36.120 --> 13:38.520]  Was clearly heart-wrenching.
[13:38.520 --> 13:42.240]  Was clear she was hurting and hurting mightily.
[13:42.240 --> 13:52.960]  Being her name made public against her wishes and dragged through the mud was a hurtful
[13:52.960 --> 13:53.960]  thing to do.
[13:53.960 --> 13:56.320]  Yeah, that's what Harry Feinstein said.
[13:56.320 --> 14:02.000]  Everything she says turned out to be not be true, though.
[14:02.000 --> 14:12.360]  She too has been dragged through the mud for the last two weeks in a way that has no precedent.
[14:12.360 --> 14:18.560]  In our polarized society we live in today, it's almost tribalized.
[14:18.560 --> 14:22.080]  We're half of us wear one team's jersey, the other half wear the other team's jersey,
[14:22.080 --> 14:26.360]  and everything we see, we see through the lens of our jersey.
[14:26.360 --> 14:37.360]  What does surprise me if across the country a significant percentage of those on the Democratic
[14:37.360 --> 14:43.880]  side of the aisle saw yesterday's testimony and concluded he must be guilty?
[14:43.880 --> 14:48.960]  And it would not surprise me if a very significant percentage of those on the Republican side
[14:48.960 --> 14:53.240]  of the aisle saw yesterday's testimony, the same testimony, and concluded he must be innocent.
[14:53.240 --> 14:56.960]  Folks, the New York Times apologized for saying that you find her credible.
[14:56.960 --> 15:00.760]  That's what you always ask about a trial or hearing.
[15:00.760 --> 15:07.240]  You can't even question how this country is crippled with political correctness.
[15:07.240 --> 15:13.880]  And the many that have been political, Democrat, operative, whose story is phony about who
[15:13.880 --> 15:17.080]  or what this is saying that didn't happen, she doesn't remember how she got there, but
[15:17.080 --> 15:22.080]  she remembers all the specifics, which turned out to not be true.
[15:22.080 --> 15:28.360]  Such Cabinon has two young daughters, a 10-year-old and a 13-year-old.
[15:28.360 --> 15:37.200]  For the rest of their lives, their daughters will go to school, will interact with people,
[15:37.200 --> 15:42.080]  many of whom are convinced their father is a rapist.
[15:42.080 --> 15:46.720]  I want you to think of the effect that has when those are the allegations.
[15:46.720 --> 15:47.720]  We're going to come back.
[15:47.720 --> 15:52.760]  You'll notice she thought she was going to die, too, 10 seconds rolling around in a bed
[15:52.760 --> 15:56.640]  36 years ago, and the witnesses say it didn't happen, and now it's rape.
[15:56.640 --> 15:57.640]  Next it'll be murder.
[15:57.640 --> 15:58.640]  Next it'll be...
[15:58.640 --> 15:59.640]  Hear that?
[15:59.640 --> 16:06.480]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[16:06.480 --> 16:09.440]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[16:09.440 --> 16:12.960]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[17:55.080 --> 18:00.320]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jean Company.
[18:00.320 --> 18:05.600]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing Pollen Block.
[18:05.600 --> 18:10.920]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:10.920 --> 18:17.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.640 --> 18:23.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.520 --> 18:26.840]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.840 --> 18:31.520]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.520 --> 18:36.800]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.800 --> 18:37.800]  symptoms.
[18:37.800 --> 18:40.480]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[18:40.480 --> 18:41.480]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.480 --> 18:46.400]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.400 --> 18:52.200]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.200 --> 18:54.880]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.880 --> 18:59.680]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[18:59.680 --> 19:04.560]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[19:04.560 --> 19:08.840]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[19:08.840 --> 19:13.000]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[19:13.000 --> 19:20.120]  lights every day, but thanks to SuperMailVitality at infowarsstore.com, I still have that energy.
[19:20.120 --> 19:24.320]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[19:24.320 --> 19:28.480]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[19:28.480 --> 19:33.480]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[19:33.480 --> 19:40.680]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[19:40.680 --> 19:44.360]  So go to infowarsstore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.

[20:23.240 --> 20:33.040]  From Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:33.040 --> 20:42.760]  So the seasoned prosecutor that came in and grilled Kavanaugh and Ford said that she would
[20:42.760 --> 20:48.960]  not charge Kavanaugh or even pursue a search warrant that none of Ford's story added up,
[20:48.960 --> 20:53.560]  none of it was cooperated, everyone she said were witnesses, said the opposite, 36 years
[20:53.560 --> 21:00.400]  old allegation that only came up now that was held to the 11th hour, then the witnesses
[21:00.400 --> 21:06.800]  say none of what's being said is accurate, the woman is a political operative, burrowed
[21:06.800 --> 21:11.880]  into the Democratic Party giving 70-plus donations just in the last few years to Hillary Clinton
[21:11.880 --> 21:18.280]  and the Democrats, Diane Feinstein's involved in the whole middle of it, Feinstein says
[21:18.280 --> 21:22.200]  she didn't link to the press, she's been caught lying and we're just supposed to go, oh you
[21:22.200 --> 21:27.640]  poor victim, when even police will tell you, and criminology and it's getting worse and
[21:27.640 --> 21:32.040]  worse that half of sex assault claims are fake.
[21:32.040 --> 21:37.320]  Every time you hear about a white woman grabbed by four black guys and raped and then, you
[21:37.320 --> 21:42.920]  know, crackers scrawled on her back, cut on her back, turns out that was a fake case.
[21:42.920 --> 21:46.880]  A black woman said four KKK guys, these were both Texas cases grabbed her and did the
[21:46.880 --> 21:51.320]  same thing, it was fake.
[21:51.320 --> 21:58.400]  How many of the dorms have had swastikas put on them or burning crosses and in every case
[21:58.400 --> 22:01.600]  it's turned out that it was the students doing it to themselves to get attention.
[22:01.600 --> 22:05.160]  The Air Force Academy this year, with the head of the Air Force chewing out everybody
[22:05.160 --> 22:09.520]  and saying whites are bad and calling the Air Force together including not just the
[22:09.520 --> 22:13.240]  cadets but the officers and saying this is disgusting and then nothing was said but
[22:13.240 --> 22:19.960]  it turned out that a black student put it on the vending machine.
[22:19.960 --> 22:26.920]  I've written articles, Breitbart's got articles, there's hundreds of cases of Democrats staging
[22:26.920 --> 22:28.040]  things and lying about it.
[22:28.040 --> 22:33.280]  It doesn't mean every case is fake, doesn't mean that Ford might not have been assaulted
[22:33.280 --> 22:36.840]  by somebody because she comes off as kind of out of it.
[22:36.840 --> 22:40.760]  Doesn't remember how she got there, who got her, but remembers the furniture and everything
[22:40.760 --> 22:46.280]  else in every detail but doesn't have any witnesses.
[22:46.280 --> 22:50.160]  I mean maybe somebody else assaulted her, there's two men that said there was a party
[22:50.160 --> 22:53.760]  like that and the girl looked like her and they didn't rape her but they got drunk and
[22:53.760 --> 22:56.840]  fell on her and grabbed on her and they shouldn't have, maybe it's her.
[22:56.840 --> 23:02.200]  That's got more credibility, at least she's got some witnesses now.
[23:02.200 --> 23:12.640]  But with this whole history of Democrats' specialty, blaming their political enemies
[23:12.640 --> 23:17.520]  for things they haven't done, you've got a right and a duty to not buy into this stuff
[23:17.520 --> 23:20.680]  especially when she doesn't have any witnesses.
[23:20.680 --> 23:25.440]  But going back ladies and gentlemen, and this is what's most critical about the whole thing,
[23:25.440 --> 23:30.680]  is that we have to process innocent and proven guilty and because there weren't any of these
[23:30.680 --> 23:37.200]  claims until now and there's statute of limitations, they have to be looked at as a political dirty
[23:37.200 --> 23:42.520]  trick which of course you know in the main that's what the Democrats are doing.
[23:42.520 --> 23:48.640]  There's no debate about it, everybody's common sense knows it, history shows it and it lets
[23:48.640 --> 23:53.320]  you know that the Democrats are now going to go below the belt for eternity.
[23:53.320 --> 24:01.280]  The Republicans have the votes now, they're reporting to confirm Kavanaugh, confirm him
[24:01.280 --> 24:07.920]  or be cucked forever and just entertain this type of crud.
[24:07.920 --> 24:13.920]  Remember Trump had been in office a month and somebody in New Jersey was throwing paint
[24:13.920 --> 24:21.160]  on synagogues and putting swastikas on them and somebody was tumbling over Jewish tombstones.
[24:21.160 --> 24:24.760]  Trump talked to law enforcement, they already had leads on who it was, he said, I think
[24:24.760 --> 24:31.160]  it's probably staged by somebody to blame Republicans because that's what was happening
[24:31.160 --> 24:37.200]  and sure enough they busted a leftist Jewish activist man who then pled guilty to it.
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.400]  But Trump had to do his first emergency state of the union on that subject to say, I'm
[24:41.400 --> 24:46.800]  not anti-Semitic and I don't support turning over tombstones and throwing paint on synagogues
[24:46.800 --> 24:54.800]  okay, I mean imagine a country where somebody's tumbling over some tombstones and then the
[24:54.800 --> 25:03.480]  president has to have a special emergency meeting in Congress to say he's not involved.
[25:03.480 --> 25:10.600]  That's how insane this has gotten, I should make a documentary just about the left and
[25:10.600 --> 25:13.920]  all the stuff they've been caught staging and then we question well was this stage,
[25:13.920 --> 25:18.040]  was that stage, sometimes there's a real mass shooting, sometimes things do happen
[25:18.040 --> 25:24.880]  but when you've got the Democrats famous, I mean they said that I said nobody died
[25:24.880 --> 25:30.200]  at Parkland, I never said that, see they even flip and lie on that front, it's just anyone
[25:30.200 --> 25:34.520]  that's engaged with Democrats knows they are the worst group of people you've ever heard
[25:34.520 --> 25:38.840]  of or ever seen, we're going to David Knight in the next segment, I wanted to get to more
[25:38.840 --> 25:44.160]  of this clip with Cruz and then I'll play a Lindsey Graham clip once David's on with
[25:44.160 --> 25:51.600]  us but we're going to be here live covering this all day on the radio and on TV and m4wars.com,
[25:51.600 --> 25:57.720]  understand this, I tend to be somewhat stoic about attacks, people call me and they ask
[25:57.720 --> 26:00.440]  me how are you handling being attacked and demonized and lied about everywhere, I mean
[26:00.440 --> 26:06.080]  it's just horrible, my wife was playing tennis with friends that she's played tennis with
[26:06.080 --> 26:13.040]  for 10 years and both people she's played tennis with are like man they make your husband
[26:13.040 --> 26:17.760]  look really bad on these sandy hook pieces that are on every day and they also say you
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.640]  know he's a racist and we know that's not true, how are you holding up, we're like
[26:21.640 --> 26:26.600]  listen, she said we're fighting a corrupt system that's trying to destroy everybody
[26:26.600 --> 26:31.000]  so we just know it's not true, we just move forward, you can't live under this terrorism
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.080]  and under this deception of mainstream media and the twisting and deception, you have to
[26:35.080 --> 26:41.320]  stand against it and Kanye West who I know was a listener because I've talked to some
[26:41.320 --> 26:45.000]  of his folks and I'll leave it at that and talk to a lot of friends with him and I did
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.920]  know that he was close to coming on the show when I put that out on Twitter months ago
[26:48.920 --> 26:54.360]  because he was talking to his folks about it happening and then they for some reason
[26:54.360 --> 26:59.720]  got cold feet and it didn't transpire, I was talking about Candace Owens and all the rest
[26:59.720 --> 27:04.760]  of it but yesterday in a speech and it's been in a bunch of different newspapers he said
[27:04.760 --> 27:10.800]  Alex Jones and Donald Trump are matrix breakers and he also tried to bring people together
[27:10.800 --> 27:15.280]  wearing a Kaepernick shirt and a Make America Great Again hat and his point is people have
[27:15.280 --> 27:22.600]  a right to exercise free speech period, stop demonizing folks that do it but to Kanye
[27:22.600 --> 27:26.200]  West understands that the First Amendment is under attack and I know he's making some
[27:26.200 --> 27:29.680]  big bold moves for real independent media that he's going to be launching very very
[27:29.680 --> 27:33.000]  soon I'll leave it at that to counter the system so if the globalists think they're
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.960]  going to shut me up or Donald Trump up I mean Kanye West is rolling out reportedly he wants
[27:39.960 --> 27:46.040]  to make more than 20 films a year hundreds of documentaries and news clips and everything
[27:46.040 --> 27:51.760]  just to counter this whole system and to try to bring in a new renaissance well that's
[27:51.760 --> 27:55.560]  right down my alley and I know that's down your alley so thank God Kanye West is so
[27:55.560 --> 28:00.960]  awake and so alive and he's a real enemy of the globalist we appreciate his support
[28:00.960 --> 28:05.720]  and understanding and defiance against their attempts to destroy my name so thank you he's
[28:05.720 --> 28:11.280]  he's a real maverick that said if you don't financially support us we'll be destroyed
[28:11.280 --> 28:14.880]  they've taken PayPal right now they're trying to take our other payment processors we get
[28:14.880 --> 28:18.680]  calls from them they're doing a lot of really bad stuff behind the scenes we're going to

[34:08.440 --> 34:15.520]  sprint i would vault over the cars like i was in the olympics and just i mean it it'd
[34:15.520 --> 34:21.360]  be like the road runner running from coyote and he's been intimately involved in cooking

[34:29.360 --> 34:33.720]  no nothing and america's waking up to this the democrats are amazing let's finish up
[34:33.720 --> 34:38.400]  a little bit of cruise where he makes the point that they're acting like cavanaugh is
[34:38.400 --> 34:42.920]  a rapist even if this was true which none of the witnesses say it is wow that's important
[34:42.920 --> 34:47.280]  36 years old and another witnesses say it happened she remembers nothing collaborating
[34:47.280 --> 34:53.200]  it just the specifics that 100% in the house sparsely furnished upstairs in the room they
[34:53.200 --> 35:00.640]  did it it's him it's him 100% and think about that now becomes rape well that's what the
[35:00.640 --> 35:07.480]  feminists teach all sexes rape no it's what's rape is telling your three-year-old they're
[35:07.480 --> 35:11.080]  really a girl they're a boy and then priming them and tricking them into saying they're
[35:11.080 --> 35:17.040]  going to be another gender so you can depopulate the earth that's child abuse child abuse is
[35:17.040 --> 35:23.320]  putting boys with girls in the boy scouts and handing out condoms at the world boy scout
[35:23.320 --> 35:30.480]  convention so that there can be open pedophilia with with adults and in a giant child molestation
[35:30.480 --> 35:40.320]  gang bang that's what it was they've taken your kids you had nurses on wearing the premium
[35:40.320 --> 35:44.200]  awards when they give them the vaccines they get the respirators ready because they order
[35:44.200 --> 35:47.360]  them to give the vaccines the bioethics board does they give them the shots and a lot of
[35:47.360 --> 35:52.000]  the kids die right there they stop breathing they got to be brought back to life and the
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.440]  inserts says it can kill you and don't give it to a premium but the bioethics do see oh
[35:57.440 --> 36:03.840]  they care so much about the children so here's a clip of Ted Cruz and we're going to David
[36:03.840 --> 36:07.600]  night who did a great job this morning breaking all this down he has a big analysis set forth
[36:07.600 --> 36:10.880]  through this little bit the next hour the no chore is coming in with continual coverage
[36:10.880 --> 36:15.560]  here and they say he's got the votes right now so need to move now where you set the
[36:15.560 --> 36:21.720]  precedent for these lynch mobs to see it's a lynch mob statue limitations none of the
[36:21.720 --> 36:29.200]  witnesses say it happened does it matter because it's a high-tech lynch mob just like turns
[36:29.200 --> 36:35.600]  clock Thomas said this is a high-tech lynch mob this is a high-tech lynch mob of cabinon
[36:35.600 --> 36:40.560]  but they learn right just have one woman say it we'll have a whole bunch say it doesn't
[36:40.560 --> 36:44.920]  matter the stories all fall apart doesn't matter because they're all gonna raise millions
[36:44.920 --> 36:50.960]  of dollars in their go fund me accounts but there's no motive just be a superstar left
[36:50.960 --> 36:58.200]  this hillary eyed and get a million dollars wow maybe I remember something about cabinon
[36:58.200 --> 37:06.960]  did to me I'm on a minute cabinon right me oh you're making light of rape now the democrats
[37:06.960 --> 37:10.880]  fund of the air of spring that killed millions of people and hundreds of thousands of women
[37:10.880 --> 37:15.240]  and children in a sex slavery and now Libby and other areas shell women in sex slavery
[37:15.240 --> 37:23.080]  that's real and you don't care about that hollywood is there to exploit women let's
[37:23.080 --> 37:31.080]  let's go to take rich what you to think of the effect that has when those are the allegations
[37:31.080 --> 37:36.160]  that's where it starts not I just agree with your jurisprudence not I think you're wrong
[37:36.160 --> 37:40.280]  and how you interpret the constitution but you are I mean let's be clear he has been
[37:40.280 --> 37:48.440]  accused of among other things participating in repeatedly drugging and gang raping women
[37:48.440 --> 37:54.480]  to take some of the more sensational I think ludicrous claims that have been aired these
[37:54.480 --> 38:00.120]  little girls are gonna have classmates of theirs repeat those charges to him some of
[38:00.120 --> 38:06.880]  the most poignant testimony yesterday when jet judge Kavanaugh described how he's taught
[38:06.880 --> 38:12.520]  law at Harvard law school for over a decade and he said he may never get to teach law
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.680]  again and that's entirely possible that's entirely possible even if judge Kavanaugh
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.840]  is confirmed to the u.s. Supreme Court is a sitting justice in our polarized world I'm
[38:22.840 --> 38:26.440]  a graduate of the Harvard law school I think it is entirely possible those on the left
[38:26.440 --> 38:34.480]  would say we don't want someone we believe is a rapist ever teaching again he also talked
[38:34.480 --> 38:40.200]  about how much he has loved coaching girls basketball coaching his daughters in basketball
[38:40.200 --> 38:53.000]  and he mentioned he may never coach again that's a very real possible consequence of
[38:53.000 --> 39:00.560]  the mudslinging and irresponsible behavior of the last two weeks it may well be in this
[39:00.560 --> 39:06.360]  trivialized partisan divided world that the parents of the other girls say no we don't
[39:06.360 --> 39:10.760]  want him as a coach anymore that's right let's stop right there and that's we have more of
[39:10.760 --> 39:14.720]  this later I want to go to David that's where this is going they want it to go there and
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.520]  Republicans and Christians we don't act like this we'd say you should have reported it we
[39:20.520 --> 39:24.960]  should have heard about it there should be other cases of him doing this and your if
[39:24.960 --> 39:29.240]  your witnesses checked out we'd say okay maybe withdrawing they don't check out and then you're
[39:29.240 --> 39:33.200]  a big political operative but you say you're not political and then Feinstein gets caught
[39:33.200 --> 39:42.720]  leaking you guys put out this whole story but then the Christian family prays for Ford
[39:42.720 --> 39:49.480]  and the rest of them says we have no ill will well you know I'm a Christian but I'm not
[39:49.480 --> 39:55.080]  that Christian I'll just be honest with you I've been lied about by these people I've
[39:55.080 --> 40:08.560]  experienced whole cloth BS and I'm fed up with it they will lie to get power and they
[40:08.560 --> 40:16.680]  will twist and they will edit and they will deceive and they will do anything and they
[40:16.680 --> 40:26.000]  take our kindness for weakness will know more can you imagine if anybody who's prominent
[40:26.000 --> 40:31.000]  if somebody can just say 36 years ago you did this to me and then your life's ruined
[40:31.000 --> 40:39.280]  that's guilty and you don't get to prove your innocence it's worse than guilty until
[40:39.280 --> 40:46.840]  provenison it's guilty period if the mainstream media decides to say they think it's credible
[40:46.840 --> 40:52.760]  with no evidence but oh when it's real when it's pedophile aircraft and true evil and
[40:52.760 --> 40:57.160]  Bill Clinton and the Arab Spring and sexualizing children and all the rest of it then it's okay
[40:57.160 --> 41:00.720]  David Knight joins us powerful Lindsey Graham clip coming up next David I know you've been
[41:00.720 --> 41:04.080]  watching this whole morning that the Republicans think they have the votes where do you think
[41:04.080 --> 41:09.560]  this is going I mean this is just it does show the political warfare is heated up but
[41:09.560 --> 41:15.000]  they're the ones that have heated up the political warfare well you know Alex yesterday when
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.440]  I was on with you we had their breaking story from the New York Times opinion desk they had
[41:18.440 --> 41:23.040]  tweeted out do you believe her or whatever and then they had to take it down because
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.080]  I said that was abusive and we've seen that same type of attitude from the Republicans
[41:27.080 --> 41:31.800]  as well they have absolutely no backbone to confront her with the evidence you know everybody
[41:31.800 --> 41:36.800]  says oh gotta believe women gotta believe survivors it's like no you can hear them you need to
[41:36.800 --> 41:42.120]  hear them but you need to believe in due process and you need to say well I want to hear what
[41:42.120 --> 41:46.280]  you have to say but let's see some proof of this because these are very serious allegations
[41:46.280 --> 41:49.600]  we also hear from them while the allegations are so serious that they need to be believed
[41:49.600 --> 41:54.320]  no a murder allegation is serious but that means that the person needs even more due
[41:54.320 --> 42:00.600]  process a fair hearing a presumption of innocence and so we see all this so how is it insensitive
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.560]  to say do you believe her they had polls about do you believe Kavanaugh and they call them
[42:04.560 --> 42:09.840]  all sorts of names again it's a new idea where like the whole country is a giant PR firm
[42:09.840 --> 42:14.120]  and we don't even have a First Amendment anymore I mean this is so dangerous well I think what
[42:14.120 --> 42:18.200]  is amazing is I kind of expected that from the New York Times because I want to pander
[42:18.200 --> 42:24.480]  to the left but we see that the Republicans Alex you know we broke that yearbook stuff
[42:24.480 --> 42:30.160]  last week and the Republicans were afraid to use that they said that's a minefield given
[42:30.160 --> 42:33.680]  the Me Too movement they've got it they've got congressional staffers saying oh that
[42:33.680 --> 42:37.800]  she doesn't come across as being very credible because of the context of what was going on
[42:37.800 --> 42:41.560]  in all of those high schools in that area how they were all bragging about this very
[42:41.560 --> 42:45.240]  kind of behavior but they were afraid to use that because it would be looking like they
[42:45.240 --> 42:48.640]  were bullying and that's what Kamala Harris said said you confront her with evidence you
[42:48.640 --> 42:52.480]  ask her for details you're bullying her yeah they wouldn't even show her as a party animal
[42:52.480 --> 42:57.200]  in the high school annual we'll be right back to ask the question will he get confirmed

[47:31.200 --> 47:34.080]  all right we're going to get to this onesie grand piece and i'm going to ask david night
[47:34.080 --> 47:41.160]  the question host of the broadcast that he does the night show at 8am to 11am that comes
[47:41.160 --> 47:48.560]  on every weekday right before i go live i believe cabana is going to be confirmed right now
[47:48.560 --> 47:52.840]  unless the democrats roll a truck bomb in there shoot somebody or you know have 50 women
[47:52.840 --> 47:57.200]  show up and flip their wrist or something i mean i mean they're going for broke but
[47:57.200 --> 48:01.320]  what are they going to do next after he does get confirmed i mean i think it's clear that
[48:01.320 --> 48:04.320]  if they don't win the midterms they're going to burn down half the country i mean they
[48:04.320 --> 48:09.120]  are just working themselves into this frenzy it lets you know they believed they were about
[48:09.120 --> 48:13.960]  to have their true revolution with hillary their real dominion they'd said that the censorship
[48:13.960 --> 48:18.040]  everything show what you see is an extension of what was already being planned just not
[48:18.040 --> 48:24.480]  as bad we'll talk to david the moment again please don't forget there's a big national

[50:10.040 --> 50:13.560]  i want to go to this lindsay grand club but just other points you'd like to make something
[50:13.560 --> 50:18.280]  you have a lot of notes and key points a and then b do you agree with me that he's going
[50:18.280 --> 50:22.400]  to get confirmed today uh or at least it's going to you know go out of the committee
[50:22.400 --> 50:25.200]  i guess it's then going to go to the full vote it's going to be a circus in the next
[50:25.200 --> 50:29.880]  week my gosh i hadn't thought about that and what are they going to pull uh in the meantime
[50:29.880 --> 50:33.800]  to try to derail this because currently they've got the votes they need to accelerate this
[50:33.800 --> 50:39.120]  through yeah i don't know if they're gonna confirm him or not i mean i'm you know that's
[50:39.120 --> 50:43.320]  something that the whips are going to be taking a look at and of course there's this constant
[50:43.320 --> 50:49.720]  back and forth this war that's being fought in the media and uh yeah i mean the problem
[50:49.720 --> 50:54.360]  alexa i think this is really what got to lindsay grand is the fact that the democrats didn't
[50:54.360 --> 50:57.080]  win but they don't care because they're going to throw all the rules out they're not going
[50:57.080 --> 51:02.760]  to go by the election and uh they you know we had an election trump gets to pick who the
[51:02.760 --> 51:07.480]  supreme court nominee is i i wish he'd pick somebody else but we're not even talking about
[51:07.480 --> 51:12.600]  the issues here now it's becoming up or down referendum on whether or not he's innocent
[51:12.600 --> 51:16.800]  and i think that after what we saw yesterday i think he is innocent but it's kind of interesting
[51:16.800 --> 51:22.720]  to me to see that the way that this is pushing uh from the media the way the entertainment
[51:22.720 --> 51:28.280]  uh industry is pushing on this uh they're attacking him because he was angry about how
[51:28.280 --> 51:35.200]  his reputation had been destroyed and i look at this and i had obviously the exact opposite
[51:35.200 --> 51:41.080]  take on this i looked at it and i saw that she wasn't traumatized she wasn't upset about
[51:41.080 --> 51:46.280]  this and uh here we are we're supposed to believe that she's still all these 35 years
[51:46.280 --> 51:50.200]  later she's got to have multiple doors to her house she can't fly and so forth and yet
[51:50.200 --> 51:55.720]  we find that she's going multiple trips to tahiti to hawaii and so forth and she didn't
[51:55.720 --> 52:01.120]  seem to be perturbed at all and yet when he gets upset and angry about this he's attacked
[52:01.120 --> 52:06.240]  by the hollywood left he's attacked by these uh court gestures of a democrat party like
[52:06.240 --> 52:11.160]  uh co-bear and jimmy kimmel uh complaining about the fact that he got angry defending
[52:11.160 --> 52:16.440]  his honor and then you've got me a fair of all people coming out and saying apart from
[52:16.440 --> 52:19.880]  all the rest a person prone to melting down probably shouldn't be on the supreme court
[52:19.880 --> 52:25.200]  and i retweeted that and i said well maybe somebody who isn't sure who the father of
[52:25.200 --> 52:33.400]  her son is and whose husband married her daughter ought to shut up about sexual assaults because
[52:33.400 --> 52:38.040]  this is the state of hollywood and this is the hypocrisy david you're absolutely right
[52:38.040 --> 52:43.160]  we've got some big breaking news uh michael sabbage uh he has to tweet it out at sabbage
[52:43.160 --> 52:48.480]  nation we're posting at info wars dot com is dr ford deeply tied to the cia is dr ford
[52:48.480 --> 52:55.240]  deeply tied to the cia who is dr ford well besides being a professor at the off brand
[52:55.240 --> 53:01.000]  university she also works as a major university down the street from polo alto she just so
[53:01.000 --> 53:07.680]  happens to be the head up the cia she just so happens to help the cia undergraduate internship
[53:07.680 --> 53:14.720]  program uh at stanford university the google people she said were interns uh they're now
[53:14.720 --> 53:21.120]  their cia or yes christine blasey's brother ralph the third used to work for the international
[53:21.120 --> 53:27.360]  law firm of baker hostetler the firm created fusion gps the company who wrote the russian
[53:27.360 --> 53:32.160]  dossier they later admitted it was only a collection of field interviews baker hostetler
[53:32.160 --> 53:39.440]  is located in the same building where the cia operates in washington dc uh three companies
[53:39.440 --> 53:45.760]  called redcoats ink uh admiral security services and data watch they are all operated by ralph
[53:45.760 --> 53:50.400]  blasey the second he is the father of christine and ralph the third christine and ralph the
[53:50.400 --> 53:55.440]  third's grandfather was nicolas deek former cia director william casey's acknowledged
[53:55.440 --> 54:00.960]  deeks decades of service to the cia so this is a whole like i said leftist stay behind
[54:00.960 --> 54:07.720]  networks in the cia infesting the republican party as well david knight well actually got
[54:07.720 --> 54:13.400]  a cia genealogy and they proudly refer to themselves as redcoats that's how i view them
[54:13.400 --> 54:18.280]  that's how you view them isn't it redcoats let's play senator graham well they've gone
[54:18.280 --> 54:23.080]  too far all these groups have gone too far let's go ahead and uh but they are bold i
[54:23.080 --> 54:28.440]  mean the the activity they engage in is stunning that's amazing let's go ahead and play uh
[54:28.440 --> 54:34.200]  senator graham it did meet with senator fine did you know that her staff had already recommended
[54:34.200 --> 54:41.080]  a lawyer to dr ford i did not know that did you know that her and her staff had this alleges
[54:41.080 --> 54:48.480]  allegations for over 20 days i did not know that at the time if you wanted an fbi investigation
[54:48.480 --> 54:54.320]  you could have come to us what you want to do is destroy this guy's life hold this seat
[54:54.320 --> 55:03.760]  open and hope you went in 2020 you said that not me you've got nothing to apologize for
[55:03.760 --> 55:08.360]  when you see sotomayor and kagan tell them that lindsay said hello because i voted for
[55:08.360 --> 55:15.640]  them i would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most unethical
[55:15.640 --> 55:22.600]  sham since i've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as
[55:22.600 --> 55:33.160]  hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy are you a gang rapist no i cannot
[55:33.160 --> 55:38.280]  imagine what you and your family have gone through boy y'all want power god i hope you
[55:38.280 --> 55:43.680]  never get it i hope the american people can see through this sham that you knew about
[55:43.680 --> 55:50.280]  it and you held it you had no intention of protecting dr ford none she's as much of
[55:50.280 --> 55:57.040]  a victim as you are god i hate to say it because these have been my friends but let me tell
[55:57.040 --> 56:04.040]  you when it comes to this you're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town
[56:04.040 --> 56:11.680]  at the wrong time my friend do you consider this a job interview the advice and consent
[56:11.680 --> 56:16.960]  role is like a job you consider that you've been through a job interview i've been through
[56:16.960 --> 56:20.880]  a process of advice and consent under the constitution would you say you've been through
[56:20.880 --> 56:30.160]  hell i've been through hell and then some this is not a job interview yeah this is hell
[56:30.160 --> 56:36.320]  this this is going to destroy the ability of good people to come forward because of
[56:36.320 --> 56:44.640]  this crap your high school yearbook you have interacted with professional women all your
[56:44.640 --> 56:50.360]  life not one accusation you're supposed to be bill cosby when you're a junior and senior
[56:50.360 --> 56:59.400]  and high school and all of a sudden you got over it spend my understanding that if you
[56:59.400 --> 57:05.760]  drug women and rape them for two years in high school you probably don't stop here's
[57:05.760 --> 57:12.640]  my understanding if you lived a good life people would recognize it like the american
[57:12.640 --> 57:20.040]  bar association has the gold standard his integrity is absolutely unquestioned he is
[57:20.040 --> 57:27.000]  the very circumspect in his personal conduct harbors no biases or prejudices he's entirely

[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:24.120]  you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones david nice ride the shotgun with us
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:29.640]  under host alex jones hackers came out yesterday and said that they would hack facebook this
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:37.200]  weekend but they would take over zuckerberg's account deleted well it looks like that just
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.120]  started to happen attackers gained access to more than 50 million users accounts facebook
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:47.200]  has admitted that a security breach let hackers gain access to more than 50 million accounts
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:52.880]  the monumental blunder was revealed late on friday afternoon three days after the attack
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:01:02.760]  actually took place the folks that founded instagram the fast-growing facebook is collapsing
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:07.600]  we have that from internal sources but now it's in the news and so it shows the whole
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.680]  thing is unraveling and the big heads of it are quietly unloading their stocks everybody
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:20.440]  should know that facebook will be like myspace within a year in my educated opinion and google
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.000]  is going to get in a lot of trouble as well so don't think all this is happening by accident
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.680]  go ahead and keep messing with the american people keep siding with the communist china
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:39.120]  and russia and the globalist and see what happens google see what happens apple see
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.040]  what happens facebook you're like what do you mean they're all saying russia is the
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.680]  enemy all day oh yeah right they'll sell out to any foreign power they hate this country
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:54.160]  that's where the left are do two more segments with david night and then i'm going to get
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.320]  to a bunch of clips and then oh and shawyer's coming in here loaded for bear with a lot
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:02.000]  of big clips and other key things we're going to get to but the process is they need to
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.560]  pass this out of committee and then they're saying you can go to a vote it's early today
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:09.920]  summer saying next week david what do you have on that process because like you said
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.280]  it seems nebulous the whips don't know those are the guys again for both parties that go
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.280]  and count the votes and figure out what they've got so i guess we're all just sitting here
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.120]  with unwrapped attention yeah we we don't really know because we've got people who are
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:29.520]  red state democrats people like mansion a place of west virginia where it went heavily
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.840]  for president trump and he's a democrat so he is just sitting on the fence he's not going
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.040]  to tell anybody how he's going to vote until he actually does it says he's undecided then
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:44.760]  we got flakes like jim flake like jeff flake and we've got liberal republicans who are
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.280]  also doing the same thing some of them have come out and say they're not going to do it
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:54.080]  so it really is a toss up and i imagine this is in a state of flux they those types of people
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.000]  are going to stick their finger into the wind as to what they're going to do and who's going
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.920]  to cut the best deal for them you got a lot of people like jeff flake who are not going
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.440]  to be coming back and so he's a real dangerous wild card they're going to have to get some
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:09.600]  democrats who are for election in some of these red states so this really is a battle
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.800]  for public opinion and that's really what they're going to be putting forward to them
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.320]  yeah why do you think flake signaled that there's no evidence that he did any of this
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.000]  and he's going to stop the due process i think that's honorable yeah yeah and he's getting
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.680]  a lot of attack for that so they're going to put pressure on the long the way that's
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.800]  how the law works if people don't have evidence or witnesses and they're witnesses say the
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.520]  opposite they're discredited i think people are being far too nice to forward i mean if
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.480]  she had a bunch of witnesses saying yeah i'd say well it's not right but it's it's not
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.920]  good behavior is there any other evidence of this and maybe it just qualifies him but
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:45.160]  they don't have any witnesses to even the party she said happening that's right well
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:51.440]  she talks about her lifelong friend leiland who through her lawyer gave a statement saying
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:55.920]  that i have absolutely no recollection of this any of this i never i don't know brett
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.280]  caven on never saw him at a party and so forth and so her response to all that in that questioning
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.680]  yesterday was to say well you know she sent me a text that she's so sorry about this is
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.480]  like yes she's sorry because her lawyer advised her not to commit perjury and go to jail for
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.560]  five years because they're not going to protect somebody that commits perjury like that like
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.920]  they protected james clapper when he committed perjury so yeah she's not going to talk about
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.720]  that online and they may be sent her a message saying yeah i'm sorry i can't lie for you
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:26.200]  can we still be friends she doesn't have anything to back her up absolutely nothing just as
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.160]  ted crew said we're typically have somebody say one thing the other person says the other
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.360]  person so you look at ancillary evidence you look at witnesses she has none that's why
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:39.000]  the due process is important the presumption of his innocence is important we'll be right
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.640]  back ladies and gentlemen and we are watching the set for the vote about a committee and
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.240]  go to the full house full senate we're going to be tracking it all today on owens jones

[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.640]  time is of the essence but we're gonna talk about this next segment the question is not
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:46.120]  it for the cia and leftist groups in the cia the fact is are they in control of her that's
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:51.880]  pretty damning evidence i mean this lady runs the internship for the cia when you're at
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:56.640]  the cia it's not like the actual military that does this fighting and killing you've
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:03.480]  got all these operatives and an analyst and people that basically just spy on americans
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:09.120]  and engage in mafia corruption to make sure that small businesses never take off independent
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.560]  companies never take off they want to make sure that the economy consolidates that were
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:18.440]  poor and under their control that's in the wiki leaks is that their main job is to transfer
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:24.560]  jobs offshore destroy the united states infrastructure destroy the family there have been declassified
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:29.440]  documents with the leftist arm of the cia put out ugly architecture ugly art i mean
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:35.440]  their job is to create transgender children their job is to infertility this is all declassified
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:41.920]  that's the leftist cia not the one you see in movies you know or mi6 james bond stuff
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:47.240]  that's that's that's that's not it's chicken neck weird dingbats like her and her family
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:54.080]  that just sit inside the cia and just engorging you know themselves on the system so it's
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:08:00.080]  a club it's a it's a game and i knew she had connections but holy to leto when i read all
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.480]  these and checked them during the last few breaks it's pretty damning so we're gonna
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:13.840]  be looking at that coming up but i mean she says she has ptsd she says she has ptsd from
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.760]  someone throwing her on a bed and rolling around for 10 seconds compared to what women
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.400]  go through in general with with with with real sexual assaults and childbirth and just
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:28.720]  everything it's just not credible and there's no witnesses it's it's insane uh david night
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.880]  i want to go to a few minutes of cabina's open statement i thought it was powerful i thought
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:37.680]  it was very real i'm sure they made fun of him because his face was getting contorted he was
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:44.480]  trying not to cry uh because you know this guy's into being a goody two shoes and he
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:51.000]  sees all into being in control of his life top of his class you name it and i mean this
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.560]  is very destructive this is when you're falsely accused it makes you very very angry but also
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.560]  makes you very very sad for your children i mean you've been falsely accused working here i've been
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:05.240]  falsely accused yeah we've experienced things that are just absolutely incredible we're not whining
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.880]  it just makes us know we must defeat these people so you know maybe i'm biased because
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:14.440]  i've been lied about so much for the left that i see a story that has you know thousands of holes
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:18.360]  in it and and and there's a statute of limitations and due process and innocent to prove and guilty
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:23.480]  and i just say this is a fraud what do you say well i say i heard that alex and i heard it on my
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:30.120]  way home yesterday i was listening to it live and i was very moved by what was happening to him
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:35.480]  again as you said you know we've experienced some of this i've had former friends uh that even before
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:39.000]  all this stuff started we're saying you got to take info wars offer i'm going to get off a facebook
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.320]  and i wrote him a long letter uh explaining to them why the first amendment is far more important
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.280]  than their political prejudice and what they're trashing and and that's really you know we look
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:56.200]  at things it's it's worthwhile to get upset about things and when i looked at the testimony of um
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:02.600]  dr ford i didn't find her credible because i didn't find her upset about this i found him credible
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.520]  because i believe he's an innocent man and he was very angry about that but then we look at
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.520]  what jimmy kimmel was saying and he says so at halftime you know she's very it was riveting to
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.760]  watch she's very credible it's like i i didn't find it credible on the details or anything else i
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.520]  understand that she was able to get through that because we had this prosecutor who was kind of
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.760]  dithering and not drawing any conclusions and she would come in and ask a few questions but
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.880]  before she could get to anything and finish up on it they would send it over for five minutes to
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.320]  the democrats to cover for her because so at halftime says jimmy kimmel it seemed like the
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:37.400]  democrats were up by 32 to nothing then brett kavanaugh sat down and delivered an impassioned
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.840]  45 minute speech delivered like a frat out of hell loud angry and tearful yeah because he's an
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:49.640]  innocent man and i i don't know i just if you're that prejudiced about this then that's really
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.960]  what you're going to see well i did i could say to you you see the lies of the press about us
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:00.200]  there's a whole cloth yeah i mean do i wear nazi tennis shoes no you don't know do we run around
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.680]  if you ever heard anyone say the n word at the office no and what would you do if you did
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.560]  well i would i would push back on that i mean this is it's absolutely incredible but
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:14.040]  you know they put out these slurs and that's the whole key we go back and you look at these gang
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:21.560]  rape statements and they are not pushing on this avonati witness or or victim or whatever
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.560]  they're not pushing on that but they already threw that stuff out there and it's already in the
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.320]  public and i said he was in he was like trying to rape women on boats and there were fistfights
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:35.240]  in colorado and they now admit it's all hoaxes that's right multiple anonymous allegations coming
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:40.440]  out two of them at least coming through sheldon whitehouse a democrat senator out of he really
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.080]  is worse than kory booker when it comes to this let's play a clip here and then i'll get into
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:48.200]  the how the whole confirmation is going to work they're set today to vote out of the judiciary
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.880]  committee and sometimes early next week in the full senate which i think they should just get
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.120]  that vote going now because it uh well we'll talk in a moment about what you think's coming
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.040]  in the next three or four days before the full vote i mean who knows the democrats will pull
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.680]  there there's some they're gonna be working tomorrow yeah yeah it's insane let's go ahead
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:15.160]  and roll a club at the beginning of a judge cabineau's statement this is a circus the consequences
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:23.480]  will extend long past my nomination the consequences will be with us for decades this grotesque
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:31.640]  and coordinated character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:38.600]  persuasions from serving our country and as we all know in the united states political system
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:48.120]  of the early 2000s what goes around comes around i am an optimistic guy i always try to be on the
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:55.720]  sunrise side of the mountain to be optimistic about the day that is coming but today i have to
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:04.360]  say that i fear for the future last time i was here i told this committee that a federal judge
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:11.080]  must be independent not swayed by public or political pressure i said i was such a judge
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:19.480]  and i am i will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process you've tried hard you've
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:25.960]  given it your all no one can question your effort but you're coordinated and well funded
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:34.280]  effort to destroy my good name and destroy my family will not drive me out the vile threats
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:41.560]  of violence against my family will not drive me out you may defeat me in the final vote
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:52.120]  but you'll never get me to quit never i'm here today to tell the truth i've never sexually
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:14:01.720]  assaulted anyone not in high school not in college not ever sexual assault is horrific
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:08.520]  one of my closest friends to this day is a woman who was sexually abused and who in the 1990s when
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:15.720]  we are in our 30s confided in me about the abuse and sought my advice i was one of the only people
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:25.080]  she consulted allegations of sexual assault must always be taken seriously always those who make
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:33.320]  allegations always deserve to be heard at the same time the person who is the subject of the
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:40.440]  allegations also deserves to be heard due process is a foundation of the american rule of law
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:51.080]  due process means listening to both sides i'm not questioning that dr ford may have been
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:59.560]  sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time but i have never done this
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:13.960]  to her or to anyone that's not who i am it is not who i was i am innocent of this charge
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:21.480]  i intend no ill will to dr ford and her family the other night ashley and my daughter liza said
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:25.400]  their prayers and little liza all of ten years old
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.840]  said to ashley we should pray for the woman
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.120]  it's a lot of wisdom from a ten-year-old we're going to come back final comments from
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.720]  david night that i want shroyers coming in we've got so much more lined up today we're going to

[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:28.520]  the recruiter at the university for the interns of the cia which they then call google i've explained
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:33.320]  that google is the cia and that's why they're now rogue against her own military rogue against the
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:39.560]  pentagon they won't even give ai technology that we paid for to the military but they're giving it
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:46.520]  common as china i mean the belligerence is is incredible and so david night's riding shotgun
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:54.040]  here with me but i was going over this and it is unbelievable her father has worked still works for
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:22:06.360]  the cia and then they've got major congressional hearings and testimonies about it all ralph blase
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:11.160]  junior a proven cia operative who from then it goes through was vice president of the national
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:18.200]  savings and trust in washington dc a cia black budget bank set up for being 100 paces from the
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:24.520]  white house and whom in 98 was taken over by sun trust bank whose majority share owner is cia linked
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:30.120]  investment black rock so this isn't just low level stuff this is the actual blue blood white
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:35.240]  chewboy stuff the importance of knowing the cia banking connections to ralph g blase junior
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:40.200]  report explains this due to the outbreak of what is known as cia bank war and then it goes through
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:45.960]  all the classifications vice president business development of redcoats ink that's ralph g blase
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:52.840]  junior so the dad the brother all of it all of us called redcoats admiralty security services
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:58.920]  arm security for deep state elites in dc that is overseen by redcoats ink co-founder and vice
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:05.240]  chairman william f p o the third i mean i know all these names u.s government contracts extending
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:13.400]  and it goes through 2023 and then it goes into how the asans was set up and everything that she
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:21.880]  does i mean read this is dr ford deeply tied to the cia asked michael sabich who is dr blazy ford
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:26.760]  well besides being a professor at the off brand university she also works at a major university
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:31.960]  down the street from polo alto she just so happens to head up the cia undergraduate internship program
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:37.480]  is carefree university her brother ralph the third used to work for the international law firm
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:43.560]  baker hostet where the firm created fusion gps the company who wrote the russian dossier they later
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.560]  admitted it was only a collection of field interviews baker hostet was located in the same
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:52.840]  building where the cia operates three companies called redcoats ink admiralty security services
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:58.680]  data watch they are operated by ralph blazy the second he is the father of christine and ralph the
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:03.960]  third christine and ralph the third's grandfather was nicolas deek former cia director william
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:08.920]  casey's acknowledged deeks decades of service for the cia at the highest levels i i mean
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:16.200]  david night i didn't know until later that she had headed up the recruitment program
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:22.920]  no wonder she's got young google interns living in her house yeah i mean this is unbelievable
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:30.200]  well you know alex is it any surprise that the cia they refer to themselves as redcoats in this
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:36.200]  context here is it any surprise that the cia that has spent decades on arranging coups and
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:40.920]  overthrowing governments abroad are doing it now at home i mean we were warned by this by our founders
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:47.800]  by madison he said if tyranny comes to america it will come in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:53.320]  they have been given a black budget they have been given cart block they have been given our liberties
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:59.000]  so they can fight foreign enemies abroad and yet now what we see is that the cia is nothing other
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  than a self-interested group trying to fight americans here domestically to overthrow our own
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.920]  and this lady's whole family are our deep state cia and then she's working with them and then no
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:17.000]  one's even making an issue out of this this is unbelievable but of course this ditzy stupid
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.600]  person can only operate and live within the confines of a deep state swamp where her daddy feeds her
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:28.920]  i mean this is disgusting yeah yeah and and uh again no basis for proof but they don't need
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.760]  any basis because these are the types of tactics that we see all the time and quite frankly you
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:37.480]  know alex and i look at lindsay graham i agree with him i mean this is shameful what has happened
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:43.800]  i wish that the republicans had not countenanced it or been accomplices in it with roy more because
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:47.880]  that established this precedent you go along with that and you get more of it they saw that it
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:54.200]  worked they could make they could pad a he said she said situation with a bunch of unsubstantiated
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:59.640]  crazy over the top i think they've gone too far because when you've got graham and all these others
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:04.440]  that are establishment starting to flip out this isn't fake people know the deep state
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:09.000]  wants to destroy america it has a hard on for it and it's gone too far and people want it out we
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.040]  want it gone they're in the way of progress they're out live with china google arrogantly not giving
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:19.720]  ai technology we paid for to the u.s military but giving it the chai con military is treason
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:25.720]  david i mean we have to deal with these people now that's right and yet as we see you know we heard
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.880]  ted cruise or i just was lindsay graham maybe talking about in the hearing yesterday talking
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:34.520]  about the excellent report that the american bar association had given cavanaugh initially
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:39.800]  and now they are coming back even though you know we had we played this multiple times and played it
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:45.160]  again today joe biden saying uh 27 years ago that the fbi doesn't have anything to do with this i mean
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:49.240]  they've already had now eight nine hours of testimony from them what's the fbi gonna give us
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:52.840]  they're just gonna give us that testimony again in a condensed form they're not gonna draw any
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:58.440]  conclusions and yet the american bar association is urging a delay on this now and so this is the
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:01.640]  the difficulty with this they're gonna have this vote today to get it out of committee tomorrow
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.680]  they're gonna have a procedural vote but they're not gonna really vote on this in the full senate
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:09.080]  until next week and a lot of things can happen and this is my next question what do you think
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.720]  they're gonna pull i mean i think they see this as their waterloo if they don't win this they think
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:20.680]  they're gonna lose their all hands on deck no holds barred totally committed 39 days out i think
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:26.200]  they're gonna pull something big well yeah and again the only thing that we've got really going
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.720]  in our favor of course it's not going to work with jeff flake flake is going to have to vote
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:33.000]  with republicans he said he's going to do it but then you know they're saying well he's over here
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.920]  talking to this guy what we'll see what happens i don't trust him until i actually see him vote
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.800]  if he votes to get it out of the committee and then you got a situation where these people want
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:47.320]  to draw this to a conclusion one way the other because early next week they have to go home and
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.680]  they've got to get started campaigning because they're getting very close to the election and you've
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:56.040]  got a lot of these people like mansion who are going to be going into areas that are heavily
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:01.640]  went for president trump and trump is going to say they shut down my pick and a lot of these places
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.560]  are conservative enough that they don't like these kind of shenanigans about he said she said without
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:10.600]  any due process without any evidence trashing a man's life like this so that's going to be very
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.840]  difficult for them to immediately leave this and go home and try to win an election so that's
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:21.160]  some pressure on them from that side otherwise we've been really dire straits here well i know
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.240]  this it's a riveting time to be alive and an incredible time to be on air and i'm just praying

[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:21.320]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:26.520]  there must be some way out of here
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.720]  say the joke about you the theme
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:35.320]  there's too much calm oh i was just telling me that a few minutes ago senator
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:40.520]  kennedy uh well from loisiana was saying this is the craziest intergalactic conspiracy i've
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:47.720]  ever heard of it's amazing alex because i think some of these republicans you know it's tough to
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:50.760]  understand where everyone's coming from from this but i think some of these republicans just
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:55.960]  didn't understand how corrupt the democrats really were until they are seeing this and getting rid of
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:03.160]  the process is freaking dangerous it's just insane here's what i said uh some of some of these people
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:09.000]  don't believe christine blazey ford one one party doesn't believe christine blazey ford
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  the other party knows she's lying and you know what what's going on here well none of her witnesses
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.040]  say anything she said happened and now i'd heard this but i looked into it she's the cia recruiter
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:25.000]  at the college and her dad and brothers and grandfathers are all high-level cia she's also
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.760]  got connections with her lawyers to the resist movement uh you know the p hats she's a hillary
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:37.640]  minion but but but cori booker and senator klobuchar said there's no political connection
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:42.760]  i saw that he was like this is ridiculous how dare you say this political they just covered up all
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:48.920]  the real stuff but you just had a voice actress get banned from twitter because she was doing a
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:52.600]  rendition of christine blazey ford so so you know you're allowed to make up
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:57.240]  brett cavinall he's a gang rapist you know he's everything but if you even think about
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:01.960]  criticizing blazey ford you're out bud that's what got us banned on the war room so so we got a
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.960]  suspension well that's what the whole new york times is like do you find her story credible
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:10.680]  oh god we didn't even ask that you can't even like imagine court tv and they're like well we
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:14.360]  can't show the prosecutor saying this is incredible because it might hurt someone's feelings this is
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:19.400]  such sick political correctness and it's like oliver darcy or this lady you talk about their
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:26.600]  operatives and you get destroyed they are protected little snowflakes i mean i tell you they don't
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:31.880]  make james bond the way they used to why james bond now is a bug-eyed liar i think that that
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.840]  poll got pulled because the results did not get what they want well it's like the new york times
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:40.840]  said should alex jones be banned off more media and they had 80 some percent new york times saying
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:45.480]  no so they pulled that one they're going to keep going here's the thing p you know it's like lindsay
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:50.600]  graham said they are so desperate for power they're so desperate for the seat that they will do
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:55.240]  anything and i think the average american sees that well they're just a cancer i mean it's like
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:00.600]  venezuela is collapsing but everywhere the left gets control what logical assumption can you make at
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:05.000]  this point alex based on the twilight zone level of events that we've witnessed in really the past
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:11.080]  two years but let's just say 48 hours the democrat party for them to go along with it has a stay behind
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:17.160]  network with all the power of the intelligence agencies blocking trump engaged in mutiny seven
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:21.000]  ways to study to get back at you they're doing it to me people say well then why don't you back down
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:27.160]  here's the deal to restore the republic to bring back free market to bring back a system where left
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:31.880]  to start running things that hate the nuclear family and hate christians and love radical islam
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:37.240]  i mean someone has to get attacked so i expected to be attacked i didn't expect that info or is
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.560]  going to be the tip of the spear so i'm sitting right where i want to be no matter what happens
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:46.200]  it's a testament and and now kanye west comes out and i already knew this was going on behind the
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:53.240]  scenes but you know says alex jones and donald trump are the matrix breakers and he's saying
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:57.000]  that depressed conference and it's quoted in a bunch of newspapers but then they cut that out
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.960]  of the video because they don't because he said though everyone knows oh god cut out when he says
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:07.480]  alex jones you're not allowed to say that on the internet wow so like in the soviet union i you
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:14.120]  can say words uh i mean i guess you can't call the dictator of china uh you know uh the uh who's
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:20.360]  the bear that likes the honey way the poo that's banned emojis of taiwaner banned in china and now
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:26.600]  other places but now even kanye west cannot say the name alex jones it it's cut out of all the
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:32.760]  feeds because it is the name you may not say it's like the it's like saying soran or something more
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:42.280]  of the rings like soran oh don't say that you're a krogomort voldemort oh voldemort no so but
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.960]  they're about to take a vote here alex and and i i think haven't always gonna get confirmed and i
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:50.520]  think that the democrats in the left are gonna go out and start engaging in and domestic violence
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:54.120]  and terrorism again this is going out of the committee did you guys tell me they're going
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:00.120]  to the vote right now oh there you go they will be shortly but you know we've got a great deal going
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:05.160]  right now and nasa night on alex that is a matrix breaker that's why you're a matrix breaker alex
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:11.640]  well let me just say that the bad uh halogens hit your pineal gland uh this is on record to
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:18.280]  you go in there and clean that out your thyroid all of it and ladies and gentlemen seriously
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:21.960]  there isn't a place you can spend money to fight the globalists in a better place and get great
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.600]  products so yes uh normally i always go a day or two after sales supposedly over and say this is
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:31.160]  the last day this last day i've been so busy as everybody knows up until midnight most nights
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:36.920]  that i have not done the new specials okay and that's my fault and this is the final run of x2
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:41.320]  the best halogen the best iodine out there it's amazing it is the final run so let me go ahead
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:46.920]  and just actually cut a little commercial here for the weekend uh so that so that we can get this
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:51.160]  out to everybody ladies and gentlemen if you learn about the pineal gland if you learn about the
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:39:00.280]  thyroid if you learn about uh the body and and you and you find out that iodine is on the periodic
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:04.840]  table iodine is a building block that if you do not have it in the human body you cannot live just
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:10.600]  like oxygen just like water okay and they've adulterated it in the soil or it's bound to other
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:15.640]  elements and people are not absorbing it you can search engine uh when the feds started putting a
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:22.200]  crappy form of iodine and salt the 20s iq points went up 15 percent on average in the midwest it
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:28.680]  caused massive reductions in infertility and deformity and mental retardation okay it's that
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:33.880]  simple why why are the japanese one of the highest iqs as long as live people because they get a
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.600]  lot of iodine from seafood they also get a lot of mercury which kind of counteracts it so they have
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:43.800]  some disorders and problems that mercury causes this doesn't have mercury in it okay this is just
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:50.040]  pure iodine and palm oil nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent pure and we get it from
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:54.120]  oil companies and gas companies that drill between seven and twelve thousand feet we have to go through
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:58.120]  a dea distributor because the raw stuff is a controlled substance because it can be used to
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:02.680]  make all sorts of things for people that have obviously watched Breaking Bad what we sell can't
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:08.920]  do that it's it's it's it's it's it's patented it's injected as gas into the palm oil and denatured so
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:13.800]  instead of being unpalatable the stomach and throat and body it's very palatable so it's not just the
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:18.600]  purest iodine out there in this proprietary uh well finally a russian connection patent and
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:24.200]  russian technique of injecting the gas in it then allows you to absorb more of it naturally in your
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:29.320]  body so this is the end of x2 when you break a contract you get new suppliers which are trying
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:36.040]  to do if it's a new formulation via the fda rules and all that you have to sit there and then call
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.920]  it something else so we're trying to bring back x whatever it's going to be but this is the final
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:45.320]  run it's going to be a while till we get more i'm being optimistic we will get more they've

[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:31.000]  we were talking during the break they're gonna make their move and here's the article for pj media
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:36.200]  it's up on info wars dot com it's totally accurate because i see it everywhere i experienced it
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  you had this this new york city professor the one that says kill the cops kill the president kill
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.080]  kill pence he's running the group that went in and gotten cruises faced and there were death threats
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:53.800]  on the restaurant that will kill you if you serve them so and this is real soviet style tactics they
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:48:00.280]  mean business so here's the headline communist planning armed insurrection on twitter especially
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:07.800]  of kabinah uh is confirmed and twitter lets them just like world star hip hop can you know have
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:13.720]  snuff films on there racial killing attacks that's okay but we're banned dr bones the co-host of the
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:19.080]  far leftist podcast guillotine started the conversation going with his 5000 plus twitter
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.960]  followers uh hey quick little question for the military minded lefties should leftist train
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:30.520]  organized an insurgent focus where they blend into civilian population for potential attacks on a more
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:37.400]  malicious structure focused on holding and maintaining turf and then it goes into planning
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:44.600]  the ambushes and assassinations uh let me just say uh i i hope not to go down this road but
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:51.800]  if they do go down that road uh you have all been lazed my friends you have on me you have all
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:58.280]  have they're so stupid now you notice some of the antifa groups you don't see them anymore on the
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:04.760]  streets some of them have kind of gone away now i don't know why i don't know why some of the awesome
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:10.600]  ones have gone away for a while but the point is is that do they even understand that conservatives
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:16.760]  and patriots we don't want violence but it's our business once it starts well i think there may be
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:22.280]  a turning point for some of them that's the basic psychology of being on the winning team and they've
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:26.040]  been deceived to think that the winning team was hating trump and now they're starting to see the
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:32.120]  light and the real fascism at google and apple etc but for those that are going to go the
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:37.560]  opposite direction alex this is my real concern you know you're already seeing the rhetoric i mean
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:44.200]  these people really believe that we're about to nominate or confirm a gang rapist to the supreme
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:49.960]  cause they said so just like when they say you're a effing nazi and it's not true they just believe
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:56.040]  it they just go nazi headlocked that's how they dehumanize you i mean so so but here's the i mean
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:01.000]  this is like the craziest thing like in in one group of people's reality i am i work for israel
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.600]  and then another group of people's reality i'm a nazi so it's incredible but i just think alex that
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:11.480]  when you believe that there is a nazi in the white house a white supremacist in the white house and he
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:17.080]  just nominated a gang rapist i mean these people really believe that they're mentally deranged
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:22.360]  what do you think they're going to do that they're being primed they're being groomed they're being
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:28.920]  instigated by people like kamala harris and nancy plosie and diane crime scene so are we really
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:34.600]  going to be shocked when we see some violence come from this confirmation i'm not going to be shocked
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:39.160]  at all in fact i expected no exactly let me give them a little advice if they have hidden cells
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:45.080]  you don't dox yourselves and talk about it publicly hidden cells and focus on ambushes and
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:52.200]  assassinations to bleed right-leaning forces now and what did i say we got me first ban on twitter
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:57.080]  i said the leftist doxing conservatives libertarians christians and ish and and saying they're
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:00.920]  going to come kill you at your house and they're so mindless that they don't care if you're left
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:03.720]  on your right wing work for the government they're going to kill you i said you should have your
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:09.240]  battle rifles ready no i think i'm gonna i think i'm gonna start walking around with my assault rifle
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:15.480]  alex i'm not even kidding no at a gut level i finally went ahead and up security now at the
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:20.760]  house and everything and of course here we've up security and that's the thing it's just like a tool
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:25.160]  like i got a toothbrush in the bathroom and a comb brush and i got a spatula flip and hamburgers or
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:30.760]  pancakes and you know i've got the instant access pistol shape safe right there with you know ready
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:36.600]  to go so that's what it comes down to but we have to be ready that that's who these people are now
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:40.840]  their normal technique they're so cowardly just to throw them all off cocktail at your front door
[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:45.080]  so you've got to have that's their main training so you've got to have your fire extinguishers and
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:49.800]  stuff ready and probably you know if you're worried about that get cameras on your exterior
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:53.320]  interior you know make sure nothing like this happens so it looks like jeff flake who is about
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:56.840]  to flake out oh yeah they were gonna have the vote but they couldn't because flake was missing
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:00.760]  kind of david night's prediction he's back though so okay okay he's back we're gonna go to this here
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:09.000]  here senator grassley on senator flake oh thank you um i have been speaking with a number of
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:16.440]  people on the other side we've had conversations ongoing for a while uh with regard to um making
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:24.760]  sure that we do do diligence here and i think it would be uh proper to delay the floor vote
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:32.520]  uh for up to but not more than one week david predicted it in order to let the fbi uh no flake
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:37.640]  arizona jeff flake to do an investigation limited self up we need to process to the current
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:45.080]  isn't god great to name this guy flake and let in time to know more than one week and i i will vote
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:53.000]  to advance the bill uh to the floor with that understanding and i i've spoken to a few other
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:59.080]  members uh um who uh on my side of the aisle they're gonna power all those other 50 women but
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:03.720]  that's my position i i think that flake just thought about that we we they're gonna pass it
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:07.320]  on a committee now they're gonna have to vote that they're gonna delay it a week we do all
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:12.760]  do diligence with an nomination this important and i want to say that this committee has acted
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:18.040]  properly and the chairman has been a dead duck politician so he can do this with no political
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:24.440]  resources from this committee and to delay this vote in this committee for a week so that judge
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:29.800]  oh he wants that oh that's even worse that's a two-week that this ford dr ford could be heard
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:36.600]  and she was yesterday uh so so that's with that agreement uh i will vote to advance the bill to
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:42.760]  the floor okay uh cargo all roll just wait just one second can can diane speak the
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:47.640]  the point diane some fights don't you know when are we voting on let's see we are a
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:51.960]  literal chinese spy she shouldn't even be allowed to speak at this she has all these chinese deals
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:56.840]  she put their opera again to run her book part of her deal with an opera that is we run your damn
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:01.080]  office she's just worth a hundred million dollars chinese spy let's let her run the committee it's
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:06.680]  way more than that if she transferred a billion to her husband sorry that's just on record that is
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:11.720]  my my understanding and if the democrats could speak to it if chris or or you was we talked about
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:17.160]  before that the democrats would accept and endorse a see there's all these criminals that just want
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:20.680]  control to loot the country no you're going to do it free market you're going to damn earn the money
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:25.240]  just because your big blob feinstein and get two billion to your husband's biotech company
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:30.040]  doesn't mean you get to be this big fat demon goblin run our lives you freaking witch
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  mr grand mr corner this country's control by much of trash
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:49.160]  i mr sad mr flake hi mr toas hi mr kennedy hi on the nominee no mr lady

[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:01.560]  no
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:13.320]  and he's it isn't an honor standing at this time i mean it's eye opening the nominee will be
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:19.160]  reported to the mr chairman may i be recognized yes thank you mr chairman i just want to thank my
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:25.400]  friend and colleague senator flake and thank you for giving us the time today to have a conversation
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:30.440]  um i'm gonna bring on another 50 women eight hours yes they'll all work for the cia and their
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:34.920]  daddies all work there with no political connection there's no political connections
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.520]  hillary clinton will come forward next no cabinet all raped me um i respect
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:42.600]  maybe brine stelter you know maybe he was at a party respect
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:48.840]  i'm brine stelter for cabinet all raped me yesterday and advanced the nominee to the four
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:55.080]  but it is my hope that we could work together on a bipartisan basis to diligently pursue
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:00.520]  an fbi investigation within the next week i want to use the fbi like black america's recovery
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:05.400]  everything 30 the fbi already transferred it forward he said we will not investigate we
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:12.760]  have no jurisdiction it's a state matter and it's 36 years old it's absurd let's bring in mr schrock
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:17.880]  thank you let's bring in nasa nasa we need you to investigate i'm brad caven on zistri here
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:24.520]  i think we do need this investigation but in fact i sort of misunderstood uh senator flake
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:30.440]  because we need a proctology exam immediately love him public investigation so i would love
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:35.560]  i will do it immediately for that investigation mr look at this weird vampire behind her will
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:42.040]  ask rata's daughter uh i love this committee but we're not the majority leader senator flake
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:48.360]  is made clear what it would take him to be comfortable on a final passage vote but it
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:54.280]  doesn't matter what we say here this would be up to senator uh schumer and senator mcconnell
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:59.400]  so it is completely up to them yeah and i think it's just made himself very clear and uh no it's
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:06.760]  senator let's move to me that senator lehi senator lehi well chairman i want to make sure because
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:14.760]  this is someone unprecedented uh when i do agree with the senate from marizona that we we should
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:20.280]  have this further investigation another democrat my understanding is that during i love how they
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:25.640]  pass it but still say it's not passing it's all unprecedented total shycom hijacking
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:32.840]  god help us just look at this collection of nincompoops who have all gotten rich sucking off
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:38.120]  of us and they're just afraid that that they've been selling america at the shycoms and that trumps
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:44.280]  like pulling it away from them i mean yeah it's it's time we'll be back in just a few minutes

[01:59:46.520 --> 02:00:03.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:17.080]  the world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who look on and do
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:24.440]  nothing if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance we now take you live
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:30.440]  to the central texas command center it's alex jones well we're taking the dead
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:33.720]  wood out of the government the republic's already coming back no matter what they do
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:37.800]  everything they're doing now it's gonna blow up my face they're not thinking two three steps ahead
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:45.720]  but if you just tuned in they just had the senate committee advance the vote if there is a week for
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:51.720]  the fbi to investigate but under senate rules the republican and democrat leader are able to
[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:57.720]  change that anyway so this is a train wreck of virtue signaling but you had an idea and it's
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:02.440]  an idea in theory we're not saying implement the idea but it's intriguing you were saying what's the
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:12.120]  move where you can have you know the the night and the castle the rook switch that's castling
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:17.800]  and so you can have those pieces switch out and so you're you're saying we should have
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:21.560]  trump so you know what this is such a train wreck i'm withdrawing cabinon
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:28.600]  and we're going to have an investigation of the cia and the deep state and everything that's going
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:35.480]  on with ford we're going to bring forward barrett who i think is even better but then like you said
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:40.040]  in a few years when ginsburg can already not even talk or early walk when she's gone bring
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:47.160]  cabinon back vindicated so i think like castling like julia caesar sent out to obstentia sent
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:54.440]  into exile comes back triumph exactly so trump can have a 360 win here coined by you alex where he
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.920]  can give the democrats what they want and that's this investigation which is obviously fraudulent
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:05.000]  but he can use the investigation but they're gonna want moller but but but but but here's the
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.520]  point though they can use the investigation but that is you know rosenstein might be fired in
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:13.080]  the next 72 hours so he can use the investigation and say okay we'll give you what you want we're
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:17.080]  going to withdraw this for now let's let's launch a full investigation we're going to launch an
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:21.640]  investigation into blazey ford because it's fair we're going to investigate everybody we're going
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:26.200]  to haul our dad and brother up because somebody's lying somebody perjured themselves i mean two
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:31.240]  different accounts and and they say that nobody was political and steinstein didn't leak it so we
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:35.480]  want your damn phone records so so yeah so let's get all the information let's launch a real
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:39.880]  investigation into all of this all sides and let's have the truth and then meanwhile let's let's bring
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:43.960]  fourth barrett cohen and let's nominate her to be on the supreme court and let's have a woman
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:48.040]  because you must believe a woman and whatever she says has to be believed then it'll start
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:53.800]  and so but this is a way he can he can avoid the the demand he tried to give the deep state what
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:58.040]  they wanted because this guy's got some neocontents he's still pro gone and against the country so
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:03.080]  he's better than what the democrats do he tried to appease them and they have crapped all over him
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:07.960]  so bring in the right wing woman bring her and then launch the investigation you know what we'll
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:13.880]  find out once it's revealed who i'll tell you this these people really are they're gonna they're
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:19.320]  going to i i called it i said three more accusers after the first one and exactly that happened
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:23.000]  exact order and now i gotta put my thinking cap on and look into the ether but
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:29.560]  they are undoubtedly going to go completely a probably
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:35.560]  they'll act like it's a honeymoon and they're investigating judiciously but then on tuesday
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:45.560]  they'll be an allegation of uh irs fraud or or or or a man will come forward and say that he grabbed
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:53.880]  his ass so so they're gonna say he they're gonna say he grabbed an intern's butt and they're gonna
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:59.960]  roll the guy and cry he grabbed my my my weenie and then it'll be oh yes oh and then that'll be it
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:03.880]  so the next thing is he assaulted a man doesn't matter it's not believable it'll just be
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:08.440]  he's gonna go be like from the cia it'll be he'll be work for the cia they'll never even
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:13.160]  met cabin on won't matter and then next they'll say that barrett was wearing a cat lady suit and
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:19.400]  like cuts little girl's heads off got i say do it here's the problem i need to be serious next
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:24.760]  to come on that was a little bit sarcastic tongue-in-cheek but actually so let it be written so let
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:27.800]  it be done i mean i i mean what do you think they're gonna pull i think it's gonna be really bad
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:33.240]  i mean i was like i said halfway tongue-in-cheek saying you know they'll start saying he was like
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:39.480]  you know pork and animals in college or something like that you know oh maybe we're given or is it
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:43.720]  are we guessing it or we give him ideas maybe oh my god they'll have like a couple guys who all
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:48.680]  work for the cia and all have you know go find me a council of million bucks oh yeah oh i saw him
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:53.720]  have sex with 14 goats one day yeah and then the meat thing was he stabbed the goat in the head

[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:23.960]  when i do agree with the center from arizona that we we should have this further investigation
[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:33.560]  so my understanding is that during the week that that is taking place there will be no
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:40.440]  action on the floor of the united states senate on uh on this nomination the democrats are trying
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:45.640]  to delay the confirmation vote for cavinal right now jeff blake the republican is behind it i can't
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:51.480]  make that commitment for the the leadership uh i can only say that i would be only comfortable
[02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:56.520]  moving forward on the floor i'll move it out of committee but i will only be comfortable moving
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:03.320]  on the floor until the fbi has done more investigation than they have already um it may
[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:09.160]  not take them a week uh i understand that some of these witnesses may not want to discuss anything
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:17.800]  further but i think we're we owe them due diligence mr chairman that's senator flanard uh all i have
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:24.840]  said to senator flake is that i would advocate for the position he took but i don't control that
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:31.640]  senator mr chairman yes senator senator clobber chart mr chairman there are other senators as
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:38.680]  well um who may be interested in uh this negotiation on the republican side and there's not really a
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:44.520]  set agreement here all of us had already said we were voting now it is simply senator flake uh
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:50.360]  working with all of us to say for the good of the senate and the good of the court the american people
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:57.880]  deserve to have the facts followed up on and i really appreciate his willingness um to do that
[02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:01.400]  i think they just blackmailed flake behind closed doors you think you just got a little blackmail
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:06.120]  and by the way if senator mcconnell wants to go forward in light of that and we still have
[02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:10.920]  several senators that haven't said how they're voting on this nominee i actually think this is
[02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:16.360]  very important what just happened right now so it doesn't have to have an agreement it is one
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:22.600]  senator who's standing up senator corner mr chairman i just want to express my appreciation
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:27.560]  to senator flake for allowing this process to move forward there's some difference of opinion
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:34.360]  among us as to what exactly the fbi investigation would consist of um some of us think the it has
[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:39.960]  been concluded and supplemented by this committee's investigation others disagree with that but i
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:45.960]  respect the fact that uh not only senator flake advocated to give dr ford a chance to appear in
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:51.080]  front of the committee um which was the right thing to do but also that he's allowed this
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:58.200]  process to move forward uh subject to further discussions about what the fbi may or may not
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:05.080]  be able to come up with but certainly he maintains his right to cast his vote yay or nay as he sees fit
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:10.520]  no let's have an fbi investigation into the tooth fairy too but uh maybe fbi investigate the easter
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:15.960]  bunny while we're at it for a full and fair hearing for dr ford and judge cavanaugh as well as his
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:22.840]  willingness to allow this to go forward subject uh to his uh his request mr chairman mr shim senator
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:30.600]  was all i think ought to call on uh senator feinstein then if i threw the chair could ask a question
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:37.480]  of senator flake does your amendment include continuing the investigation during this period
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:45.320]  of time if i can respond there is no amendment uh i'm simply stating and the discussion that we had
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:52.760]  between us all is that i would hope and i i think we had some agreement before that the democrats
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:10:02.120]  who have been i think justifiably uncomfortable moving ahead uh could could publicly in an effort
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:08.760]  to bring this country together um say that we would feel better i'm not expecting and to vote yes
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:16.200]  but not to complain that an fbi investigation has not occurred and and i that this is what i'm trying
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:22.120]  to do this country's being ripped apart here and and we've got to make sure that we do do
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:28.760]  do diligence i think this committee has done a good job but i do think that we can uh have a
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:36.200]  short pause and and make sure that the fbi can investigate my understanding is that some of us
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:42.520]  would have to and i'm prepared to do it make a request to the white house to ask the fbi to do
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:48.840]  that investigation it would be short and limited in scope to the current allegations that have been
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:54.760]  made let's have the chuck tumor clip ready to go guys encourage democrats who we talked to before
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:11:01.240]  to endorse that kind of thing that that uh that we can then move on mr chairman because of the two
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:09.320]  hour rule we're adjourned okay guys now we had that on delay let's let's see if we catch up live
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:14.920]  to that guys where it's at and uh we may actually be able to go back live to this um okay let's go
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:20.520]  to senator graham right now some democrats have said okay with that now i'd like them to come forward
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:26.360]  i'm going to talk to mitch and jeff and eventually engage with the white house but uh you know again
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:32.280]  i don't think we need this i am long since ready to vote i think he's been very poorly treated judge
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:44.440]  cabana leadership but i think jeff feels good about judge cabana you just want to make sure
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:49.400]  the process is fair but you need to ask him i've never felt better about him being on the bench
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:53.320]  than i do right now senator i'm senator graham senator graham but i watch out for lindsay
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:58.520]  grandpa i think he's gonna vote yes because of all this change called democracy he talked to his
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:04.520]  colleagues and they're going jeff's please please just give us a few more days jeff's a really good
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:12.520]  guy i wouldn't have done it uh but uh please let's be fair and jeff is trying to be fair i just don't
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:17.880]  see we're gonna benefit from anything in terms i've been doing this most of my adult life it's
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:22.120]  35 years ago you know what you know and you've heard what you're gonna hear but having said that this
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:27.240]  is called democracy no this is not democracy come on now he knows better cabana is innocent of these
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:31.480]  things he's been accused of do you think this might help this is a political country feel better
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:36.280]  about this person on the supreme court if a week from now the fbi comes back and says we're good
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:42.600]  i think the people in the country are hopefully a week from now you'll probably put both however oh
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.920]  you know why because the political correct nature of our society is better about it i feel better
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:55.080]  senator graham do you think he was moved after he was confronted by protesters on his way to vote
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:13:02.520]  this morning no no listen this is this is jeff flake i mean this is why i actually like about
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:07.160]  the guy susan i mean all these people take it really seriously by the way did you see
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:11.320]  the images of the protesters today guys you should pull up some of these images on twitter i mean
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:15.720]  folks decisions to make you know i'm not going to sit here and insult people but like you know i'm
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.440]  sorry there's just just look at who these people are but okay and then reach your own conclusions
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:24.600]  just late being very sincere and what he's trying to do i respect the hell out of this
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:28.920]  trying to get some democrats to buy in well a weak matter and some of them said it would
[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:33.640]  so no it wouldn't go on and on and on but if you can get a few of them to say a week longer would
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:38.280]  make it a better progress process than he's probably done the public leadership has agreed to a one
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:43.320]  week delay well if i could quit talking to y'all i'll go find out see and these many i mean i don't
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:48.600]  know these media members i don't they're probably good people but they just don't get it or they're
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:59.400]  too pc so okay so look this is what the political correct nature of our media has has now done where
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:08.760]  oh you know um christine blazy fort is the victim and we have to believe her and you know i feel
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:13.320]  bad for her you know i have no ill will towards her she has to be believed and i'm sure that she's
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:24.440]  not up here no no if a liar is a liar a political hit man is a political hit man a political hit
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:30.360]  woman is a political hit woman a cia operative against this country is a cia operative against
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:36.360]  this country it's not a woman that has to be believed it's not a victim that we have to listen to
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:45.880]  you no a liar is a liar if she lied about all of this that doesn't make her a victim that makes
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:57.000]  her a liar and a felon which by my estimation she is but i'll say this one more time as we
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:02.920]  go to break and then we'll go back to the floor here president trump needs to pull a castle move
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:08.200]  on the democrats remove Brett Kavanaugh's the nominees say we're going to give the democrats
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:11.480]  what they want we're going to investigate everything we're going to investigate blazy
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:15.480]  ford we're going to investigate kavanaugh we'll investigate all this we'll get to the bottom
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:20.040]  of it and you know what they'll find out cia operate operation the democrats have been
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:24.680]  planning this for months we already have all the evidence we have all the evidence of blazy
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:29.960]  ford's past we have all the evidence of the democrats planning this so he pulls kavanaugh
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:37.160]  in a castle move nominates barrett cohen she's a woman she has to be believed so now you make
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:42.120]  the democrats go even crazier against a woman showing america who they really are and you get
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:47.720]  an investigation into blazy ford to show what was really behind that boom you nominate castle when

[02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:38.120]  life on earth in the milky way galaxy in the universe in space here we are ants marching
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:45.960]  all to the beat of a different drum there is no reality there is no truth
[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:56.360]  there's just existence and life one side of the aisle sees one thing and the other side of
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:21:06.920]  the aisle sees something entirely different how do you explain that well i think we know but
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:12.760]  we won't get into it because president trump is responding to media right now when it comes to
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:17.320]  the chaos and the circus that has become to the uh the cavital hearing so let's go live to president
[02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:26.440]  trump testimony likewise was really something uh that i haven't seen before it was incredible it was
[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:34.280]  an incredible moment i think in the history of our country but certainly she was a very credible
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:43.160]  witness she was very good in many respects and i think that uh i i don't know if this is going
[02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:49.080]  to continue one word or are we going to get a vote but uh again i'm i'm here so i'm not out there
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:54.600]  watching because i can't be out of great respect although maybe we'll go watch together okay we'll
[02:21:54.600 --> 02:22:00.600]  watch together but i think uh it will work out very well for the country i just wanted to work
[02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:05.640]  out well for the country if that happens i'm happy have you thought at all about the replacement
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:14.440]  for judge gap not even a little bit not even a little bit i have no message i mean they have
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:19.720]  to do what they think is right there's no message whatsoever they have to do what they think is
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:28.280]  right they have to be comfortable with themselves and i'm sure that's what they are i'm going to
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:35.480]  rely on uh all of the people including senator grassley who's doing a very good job uh that'll
[02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:40.040]  be a decision that they're going to make and there's like a ninth or tenth background investigation
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:45.000]  into cabinet all you know 11 12 30 how many do you need 30 100 they want to do i will be totally
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:52.840]  reliant on what senator grassley and the group decides to do and we're going to talk about
[02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:57.080]  venezuela so i was waiting for that question i think maduro is in new york today discussing
[02:22:57.080 --> 02:23:00.680]  venezuela venezuela is in new york to have a lot of interesting things going on you guys double
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:05.800]  check that i believe that's today though chili is really something special if you look at what they've
[02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:12.360]  done how far they've come you look at how well run the country is so i want to say it's an honor to
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:17.720]  be with you a great honor thank you very much thank you very much is he with the president of chile
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:23.480]  right now is that what's going on that's all i think i think that that's what he was just saying
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:33.640]  there thank you we'll see what happens i know he wants to meet with us we'll see what happens
[02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:38.920]  then as well as a mess and it's got to be cleaned up and people have to be taken care of thank you
[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:49.000]  very much okay so maduro is in new york whether or not president trump will be meeting with maduro
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:55.240]  is a a question right now we are watching uh tape from just moments ago from inside the
[02:23:55.240 --> 02:24:01.000]  president trump is trying to uh get the reporters out of his office right now uh i i believe so we
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:05.800]  can speak with the chilean president i think that's who he's meeting with right now but you know uh
[02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:14.600]  there was after president trump maybe it's in here it's back in years after president trump
[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:25.320]  called out venezuela during his un speech you had canada i try to find the story i'm sorry
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:33.560]  i'm throwing all this on you you had canada columbia you had i believe it was canada and five
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:38.840]  countries in in south america central america come out and say it's time for military tribunals
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:46.360]  against uh the venezuela government it's time for a a a un i think investigation i'm sorry i don't
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:54.520]  have the uh the story in front of me so you have trump mentioned a potential military coup of course
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:25:01.080]  who got real hot under the collar after that was nicky hailey anytime the military gets brought up
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:06.680]  or any sort of intervention nicky hailey uh well let's just say she's like a teenage girl
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:13.800]  Trump officials press un to sanction venezuela as us and europe have done un box
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:19.000]  there was something signed though guys i had the story on my desk i can go grab it in the break
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:24.760]  but it was canada and four or five latin american south american countries that are saying yeah
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:31.400]  something has to be done about the leadership in venezuela it's out of control where they go out and
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:39.720]  you have you can't get toilet paper people are eating like raw animals on the streets like tipping
[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:46.840]  over cars i mean it's it's total chaos and then president maduro you know goes for like fancy
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:52.200]  five course dinners and post it on social media and i'm supposed to sit here and have the democrats
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:59.320]  lecture me about socialism caring about the little guy that's insulting that's unbelievable is what it
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:04.280]  is but these people don't even exist in reality so so what difference does it even make now
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:12.680]  we're going to go back to the floor here if they go back to whatever they're discussing right now
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:15.640]  whether or not they're going to delay this nomination whether they're not they're going to
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:19.720]  take a vote they were supposed to take a vote the vote got delayed by flake who wants to
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:24.680]  move forward with this who wants to have an fbi investigation now oh the democrats aren't comfortable
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:31.640]  what are we going to do so we'll we'll see what happens but we'll have the live coverage for you
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:43.640]  right here on the alex joneshow whatever comes so will trump meet with maduro in new york as maduro
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:51.320]  is in new york i believe he's at the un general assembly this is just days after president trump
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:59.400]  says it might be time for a military coup in venezuela where what should be a very rich prosperous
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:05.000]  nation with the oil and everything they have down there great people but the socialist government
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:13.640]  steals all the wealth and you know venezuelan people are very proud people as many south american
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:26.360]  countries are and i'd love to see i'd love to see venezuela become a new example worldwide
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:33.560]  not a negative light you know to say look at how bad it is but to say look at
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:38.200]  what happened under socialism and now look what we're going to do under a free market capitalist
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:45.160]  democracy just like if you want to look at south korea versus north korea not saying you know
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:53.080]  south korea is perfect i'm just saying it'd be nice to sit here and say 20 years down the road
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:57.560]  after the socialist government is kicked out and you have democratic elections you have a free market
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:02.760]  system and they start doing fair trade with the other countries in south america like brazil
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:10.840]  Argentina colombia and then to see wealth and prosperity return to venezuela to see the wealth
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:16.600]  that they have in that oil rich country return to the people would be a beautiful thing for humanity
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:25.240]  and another case study against the perils of socialism so it'll be interesting to see i would
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:32.600]  imagine that maduro would want to meet with president trump considering what president trump
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:39.240]  has put on the table uh but we'll see if president trump has any uh interest in doing that all right
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:44.920]  we're going to a break we're going to go back to the floor of congress if they go back live otherwise
[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:48.280]  i may open up the phone lines to see what do you think about this madness what do you think
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:53.240]  trump should do what do you think about jeff flake and and what happens in america on the other

[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:10.760]  what should president trump do what should the republicans do about the cavinal hearings which
[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:14.680]  it looks to me like they will be delaying this if they go back live we'll go back live but i found
[02:34:14.680 --> 02:34:20.520]  the story so president trump is trying to help the north korean people he's also trying to help the
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:25.720]  venezuelan people the new york times publish the story neighbors refer to venezuela to criminal
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:32.120]  court in historic rebuke so it's canada and then argentina chile colombia perugue and paru
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:41.240]  and this is right after president trump mentions the drastic situation in venezuela during his

[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:16.040]  hearings because folks i mean these people i'm sorry but you know they say don't judge a book
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:23.720]  by its cover but i think you can read these books by the cover there's a picture that elissa malano
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:31.960]  tweeted out too of feinstein and mcowsky that i think is very telling and it's basically feinstein
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:38.920]  domineering over mcowsky mcowsky i think it's mcowsky and you can see mcowsky kind of like you
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:45.240]  know wants to listen feels bad they're obviously talking and feinstein's like listen to me i'm the
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:55.240]  overlord someday you'll have your power but now is mine give me your force give your power to the
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:36:02.040]  dark side elissa mcowsky's like oh but i just i just feel it's wrong i don't want to betray the
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:07.960]  republicans i don't think this man's being treated fairly didn't you see what i said he's a gang rapist
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:14.680]  this man is a gang rapist he must be stopped he cannot be on the supreme court we the women

[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:34.600]  now i i i suspect if cavernal gets nominated or confirmed which now i don't think is going to
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:44.760]  happen i said it was a 50 50 chance yesterday and now i don't think it's gonna happen and
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:48.600]  they're done the crew is now telling me that they're done for the day so they're adjourned
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:53.000]  they're not going to be a vote today okay so they're not going to vote today because
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:57.560]  senator jeff flake wants to delay for a fbi investigation so so congratulations
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:04.520]  i'm just getting information from the crew right now go ahead
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:08.120]  so the hearing's done
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:16.920]  okay so but they're not going to vote they're not going to vote to confirm
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:27.720]  so are they going to vote today then or is that
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:35.560]  so the confirmation vote on senate floor is next week let's see if we can get a date and
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:42.120]  time on that so they're done for today but you know i think we should be congratulating the
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:49.240]  democrats you have successfully pulled off a heist of the supreme court justice nomination process
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:57.400]  you have successfully pulled off a heist of truth and justice in this country you have
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:03.960]  successfully pulled off a heist of reality and you've successfully pulled off a heist you want to
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:13.720]  know the real crime the democrats have successfully pulled off a heist of the true pain and suffering
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:21.080]  that real victims of sexual assault go through that's what the democrats have done today the negative
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:30.520]  energy that naturally brings forth human emotion in the form of sympathy the democrats have now
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:41.640]  heisted that to steal and stop a supreme court justice so i think we should be congratulating
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:47.720]  the democrats today you have successfully pulled off a lie you have successfully pulled off a coup
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:52.280]  against the american media against the american justice system and against the american people
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:58.120]  so good on you democrats a domestic terror organization ladies and gentlemen the democrat
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:03.720]  party of the united states of america and you better believe it which i don't think is gonna
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:10.600]  happen now but you better believe it if neil gorsuch is confirmed next week the democrats will go hot
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:16.600]  in their domestic terror and you won't just see people in trump hats getting punched and getting
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:21.880]  things thrown at them you know you won't just see stuff like that they will be stalking and even
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:28.600]  getting physically violent with with senators and congressmen and members of the media they will
[02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:36.120]  they are fully unhinged they believe there is a white supremacist kkk nazi as the president and
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:41.960]  they think he just nominated a gang rapist to the supreme court they really believe that
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:48.680]  they're fully unhinged they have nothing to live for so this is their battle now a total
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:57.000]  fake fictional version of reality that they latch on to in their head because they have nothing else
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:05.640]  and they feel a connection to one another for the first time in their hatred so they come
[02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:14.520]  together in hatred they come together in their desire to reject reality because they say it's
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:24.120]  just a social construct no a penis means you're a boy yeah it's not a social construct bud it's called
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:35.480]  biology but that doesn't stop them does it oh my gosh this country's so whacked out man
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:44.920]  is there really any hope you know i mean if you can go to this level oh my gosh
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:52.120]  so we've got your calls getting lined up now oh by the way

[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:27.400]  i'm a little drained mentally or i just need a little a little pickup but the last two mornings
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:32.760]  because i've gotten up and just immediately focused on the hearings it's like eight hours
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:36.600]  yesterday and then a couple hours this morning and today i've been waking up and taking the
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:40.920]  brain force first thing in the morning so that i i get rid of that brain fog and so boom i hit

[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:15.960]  to your phone calls the democrats have now successfully delayed the supreme court confirmation
[02:51:15.960 --> 02:51:23.160]  until uh until november that that's what this is so so you won't have this supreme court justice
[02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:33.160]  on the court in october which is going to begin session on monday so congrats to the democrats
[02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:39.800]  you've successfully used lies and propaganda and your mockingbird press and the cia against the american
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:45.720]  people good for you democrats you're really you should really be proud of how scum how disgusting
[02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:52.040]  you are we should really be proud of the democrats and you know what i actually have to say this
[02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:58.680]  you know the democrats actually have more courage than republicans the democrats are actually braver
[02:51:58.680 --> 02:52:03.960]  than republicans you know why because you know i'll tell you it takes some balls of steel
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:12.440]  to go on the floor of congress and and collectively go along with a known lie you got to have some
[02:52:12.440 --> 02:52:21.400]  serious serious hootspa to get up there during these hearings and go with a known false narrative
[02:52:21.400 --> 02:52:30.520]  that you know you made up you you really you really need some bravery to be christine blazey
[02:52:30.520 --> 02:52:36.520]  ford and in my view perjure yourself with these false allegations of course she'll get out of it
[02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:41.640]  by saying oh i was so drunk i must have forgot that's how she'll get out of these this perjury
[02:52:41.640 --> 02:52:46.600]  by my estimation this this this felony that she committed but you you got to say that takes a
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:52.760]  lot of courage ladies and gentlemen but for the republicans to sit here and say oh you know i
[02:52:52.760 --> 02:53:00.760]  understand for the victim you know i feel bad for her you know i i you know this isn't no no she's
[02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:08.040]  a known cia asset liar connected to the cia connected to the clinton's through her lawyers
[02:53:08.040 --> 02:53:17.160]  connected to democrat movements connected to the whole resist do we have the chuck schumer clip
[02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:21.800]  i'm gonna take that as a no okay we got the we got the schumer clip listen to this clip
[02:53:23.240 --> 02:53:33.560]  everything everything that you see everything that you hear everything that we've seen is a result
[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:40.200]  of what chuck schumer said right here this intelligence briefing for the president elect was
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:46.600]  always planned for friday it hasn't been delayed but he's he's taking these shots this antagonism
[02:53:46.600 --> 02:53:51.560]  is taunting to the intelligence unit you take on the intelligence community they have six ways
[02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:57.640]  from sunday of getting back at you so even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman
[02:53:57.640 --> 02:54:02.040]  he's being really dumb to do this what do you think the intelligence community would do if they were
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:08.440]  i don't know what i from what i am told they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked
[02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:15.720]  about okay i'll give you an idea of what the intelligence agency would do they would implement
[02:54:15.720 --> 02:54:23.080]  somebody inside the trump campaign as a stooge to get a warrant to spy they would send somebody
[02:54:23.080 --> 02:54:28.520]  to a bar to get drunk with somebody put an idea in his head to make him then go to the trump
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:34.600]  campaign and say i've got dirt from russians to set him up they would launch a full-on investigation
[02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:40.840]  then after those two setups to try to destroy the president of the united states they will bring
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:49.880]  forth a woman to make accusations from 36 years ago with no evidence no corroboration every witness
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:57.160]  says it didn't happen to try to stop the supreme court from having a new justice that's your six
[02:54:57.160 --> 02:55:01.880]  ways from sundays ladies and gentlemen that's what chuck schumer was talking about it's putting people
[02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:07.480]  on tv like phil mud and other cia aspects to assets to lie about president trump
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:14.120]  chuck schumer admitted it and guess what they're now telling you what they're gonna do next folks
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:22.200]  they're going to get violent in the streets they're going to activate their street thugs
[02:55:22.200 --> 02:55:27.240]  thugs to start intimidating threatening and getting physically violent with republicans
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:35.560]  with conservatives you watch but you know what let's give in you know what let's not nominate
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:39.880]  cavanaugh because then the democrats are going to activate their activate their domestic terror
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:45.080]  groups and we don't want that we just want we just want to believe the victim
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:52.120]  ridiculous this country so so democrats have more courage than republicans because republicans
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:57.240]  won't call a known liar a liar republicans i mean do you know all the connections i'm sorry i meant
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:02.040]  to go to your phone calls but this is just ridiculous like do you know all the connections
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:06.440]  with cavanaugh and excuse me not cavanaugh with with blazey ford and the democrat party
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:13.960]  with with blazey ford and the cia with with uh oh i mean it's just unbelievable even even even
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:22.360]  even blazey ford's uh uh parents and cavanaugh's parents have a connection and people think that
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:30.440]  this may be some uh retribution for a what was it a foreclosure on a house deal or or an eviction
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:35.960]  deal when when uh cavanaugh's mom had this court case of blazey ford's parents i mean it's just
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:41.080]  it's all insane it's all totally made up but because republicans are so weak need because
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:48.200]  republicans are so pc they don't have the courage to come up and say um accept lindsey graham and
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:54.760]  ted cruz to an extent this is a democrat con job these are made up allegations if you can't see that
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:57:03.240]  you're an idiot and people like sheldon whitehouse i mean these people know who they are these people
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:12.120]  know the lie they know what they're doing are you kidding me are you serious but again you see this
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:18.600]  is why republicans at least this brand of republican will never win you want to defeat these people you
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:23.800]  go with the castle chess move you pull a switcheroo and then you investigate blazey ford and you
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:29.640]  nominate barrett cohen or you find a couple women from chuck schumer's past a couple women from
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:34.520]  kori booker's past a couple women from sheldon whitehouse past oh i was at a party with sheldon
[02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:39.960]  whitehouse and he groped me when i was passed out drunk on a bed now i was passed out drunk so maybe
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:48.360]  wasn't him but i think it was him because he was there he must resign alex jones here with an extremely

[03:00:53.400 --> 03:01:00.440]  everything that she did i mean literally she was just reading a script there is no emotion if she
[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:05.480]  was really brutally or someone attacked and fighting for her life or something you wouldn't
[03:01:05.480 --> 03:01:11.800]  be just sitting there reading a little manuscript be like oh yeah he touched me blah blah blah and
[03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:17.720]  then cavinar he is like and who is this woman and who is this woman and charlie i can't tell if
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:20.600]  you're on speakerphone i'm sorry i'm having trouble hearing you if you are please switch
[03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:26.120]  and who is this woman from arizona doing the questioning grilled cavinar and let's blaze
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:31.720]  he fought off with the past excuse me how come nobody heard you you say there were five people
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:36.200]  in a house and there was no other music on except the music in the room nobody heard you nobody
[03:01:36.200 --> 03:01:41.640]  remembers anything he's like why isn't she the one being grilled and i'm sorry but if you're
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:46.520]  gonna do this right you have to ask okay you know how did your clothes get off what where did he touch
[03:01:46.520 --> 03:01:51.240]  you what did he why did he penetrate you i'm yeah this is graphic this is gross that's what you have
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:57.240]  to ask this woman that's what she's alleging oh but oh you know do you remember that night like
[03:01:57.240 --> 03:02:02.840]  you know i'm sure it was hard for you and they're asking about like you know oh you know why did you
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:11.000]  fly here and then oh it's just give me a break dude it was it was just really sad to ask and i was
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:16.440]  surprised that no republicans were grilling or i was like expecting some republicans to be like
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:20.520]  well you know what how do you not remember how the hell you got there if you were sober if you were
[03:02:20.520 --> 03:02:25.080]  15 fighting for your life you wouldn't be reading this man's script like it's nothing you're like
[03:02:25.080 --> 03:02:29.960]  literally there was no emotion it just seemed so bad it's so ridiculous that's what i'm saying it's
[03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:34.680]  like i mean honestly it's like do we need to do like a whole broadcast where we all sit here and
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:39.800]  talk about high school i remember i know seriously like i could sit here and i could give you like
[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:45.160]  every detail of almost every high school party i was at i'm not even kidding you i remember all of
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:51.320]  them and i drank it most of them i remember how i got there i remember who was there i remember who
[03:02:51.320 --> 03:02:57.400]  i talked to i remember how many games of beer pong i want and oh but oh you know oh this someone
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:02.360]  took me up to the room but you know oh and this is like tell me about the map of the neighborhood
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:08.840]  can you map out the house what there's something and she was 15 it's like which how did you even
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:13.800]  get there i know you didn't want 20 minutes after being supposedly threatened of your life
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:20.200]  it's just so fake and i think about it but i was so sincere about his testimony i mean he looked so
[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:24.600]  innocent he's so innocent this is like someone who was searched for you know he does everything
[03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:28.840]  by the book this is how americans used to be because i remember when i grew up i was so you know
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:33.080]  to find a diary like it's always nice or a dream of your life it's always nice to look back on things
[03:03:33.080 --> 03:03:37.880]  and when i heard about his calendar and his diary like find the heart just drop out like this guy's
[03:03:37.880 --> 03:03:43.880]  so innocent and then um what's his name uh cori booker and some other girl were laughing at him
[03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:49.960]  while he was doing this question oh yeah no no they're all laughing we could pull up all the images
[03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:55.560]  in fact guys go to the war room memes twitter account i retweeted like five images the democrats
[03:03:55.560 --> 03:04:02.040]  are all laughing they're like cheersing one another blazey for i didn't see cavinal laughing
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:07.560]  i didn't see cavinal having any fun i didn't see a republican congresswoman go over to cavinal
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:13.000]  and hand him an envelope of god knows what that's all the democrats and by the way and by the way
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:17.960]  thank you so much for the call charlie so so the democrats are all laughing having a good time you
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:21.560]  know it's all fun and games even though they're they're claiming this man is a gang rapist but
[03:04:21.560 --> 03:04:27.480]  let me tell you something right now the first republican that comes out and calls blazey for
[03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:31.560]  it a liar is the first champion we've had in congress in a long time because let me tell
[03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:37.080]  you something if the democrats are willing to come out and call brett cavinal a gang rapist
[03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:42.120]  but republicans don't even have the courage to come out and call christine blazey for it a liar
[03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:47.160]  then they will never win this battle the democrats have no limits the democrats have no boundaries
[03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:51.480]  it's time for republicans to take the gloves off and call this woman what she is a liar
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:59.880]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in
[03:04:59.880 --> 03:05:05.240]  leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned
[03:05:05.240 --> 03:05:12.360]  about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[03:05:12.360 --> 03:05:19.160]  the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:25.080]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[03:05:25.080 --> 03:05:31.480]  acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity filter and not
[03:05:31.480 --> 03:05:37.320]  only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal
[03:05:37.320 --> 03:05:44.040]  levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what we've
[03:05:44.040 --> 03:05:50.520]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water supply but more importantly
[03:05:50.520 --> 03:06:06.280]  a good water filtration system will purify it the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the
[03:06:06.280 --> 03:06:17.240]  alex john show and now your host owin shroyer all right we're taking your phone calls here oh
[03:06:17.240 --> 03:06:24.920]  oh you know christine blazey ford said that she has nothing to gain by giving a testimony nothing
[03:06:24.920 --> 03:06:31.160]  to gain oh really three separate go fund me accounts and she's raised almost 700 000 dollars
[03:06:32.280 --> 03:06:36.200]  probably more than that now that was as of yesterday so so nothing to gain but she's
[03:06:36.200 --> 03:06:49.960]  raised probably a million dollars on go fund me accounts so yeah i just can't believe that
[03:06:49.960 --> 03:06:56.760]  we're letting the democrats get away with this look at the pictures of christine blazey ford
[03:06:56.760 --> 03:07:01.720]  laughing it up during the hearing laughing it up with the democrats quarry booker laughing it up
[03:07:01.720 --> 03:07:06.120]  kamal harris laughing it up feinstein laughing it up they're all laughing it up this is a woman
[03:07:06.120 --> 03:07:12.920]  that they claim is a victim of sexual assault i mean we're talking you know rape that's what
[03:07:12.920 --> 03:07:18.600]  they're claiming kavanaugh did this woman's raped her and here she is so brave she's so brave to come
[03:07:18.600 --> 03:07:28.440]  forward so brave that she laughs it off no no the real bravery is that she's willing to lie under
[03:07:28.440 --> 03:07:34.440]  oath that's the bravery the real bravery is the democrats collectively going with a known lie
[03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:42.760]  that's the true bravery here and if there's any republican that has a set they would call christine
[03:07:42.760 --> 03:07:55.400]  blazey ford a liar again you say oh oh and you need to be more pc you can't say that this is a
[03:07:55.400 --> 03:08:02.120]  woman who could be a victim really the democrats are calling this man a gang rapist and you're
[03:08:02.120 --> 03:08:11.400]  going to tell me i can't call her a liar huh not in my world let's go back out to the phone lines
[03:08:11.400 --> 03:08:19.720]  and go to adam in connecticut go ahead adam hey how you doing well i'm good but uh i'll tell you
[03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:26.760]  the state of this country is uh in in in serious need for repair if the democrats are able to get
[03:08:26.760 --> 03:08:32.760]  away with this and have no punishment well first of all i want to thank you guys for your courageous
[03:08:32.760 --> 03:08:39.800]  government on all this um second of all i don't think this is an attack on kavanaugh i think
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:45.800]  this is at the big enchilada the next election they want to draw trump out they're trying to piss
[03:08:45.800 --> 03:08:50.040]  them off they're trying to make them stupid stuff on social media they're trying to make him
[03:08:50.040 --> 03:08:57.000]  overstep his bounds i think this is them taking on his on his boy to get the big the big fish is
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:01.560]  what this is all about well you're right because it doesn't matter who trump nominated it would
[03:09:01.560 --> 03:09:06.360]  have been the same thing and of course this is all in response just like everything has been to
[03:09:06.360 --> 03:09:10.920]  trump winning the election but they're they're they're pushing this now and they got successful
[03:09:10.920 --> 03:09:15.480]  so they won't have another supreme court at least another supreme court justice at least till
[03:09:15.480 --> 03:09:22.280]  november is in session and their real hope here because they know that the the blue wave is not
[03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:27.400]  happening so they want to try to stop anything from happening before the midterms and do anything
[03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:33.800]  they can before the midterms before they even lose more congressional power yeah they're trying
[03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:39.320]  to draw trump out that's what it's like like you said it didn't matter who it was this was an attack
[03:09:39.320 --> 03:09:44.600]  on trump this is this is them saying look we just gave your buddy a bloody nose what are you going to
[03:09:44.600 --> 03:09:48.840]  do about it they're waiting for him to do something stupid so they could turn around and say look see
[03:09:48.840 --> 03:10:00.360]  he's crazy like we've been saying well i look i know for i know that there's stuff going on
[03:10:00.360 --> 03:10:04.840]  behind the scenes i don't know to what extent i don't know to how much i'm not going to sit here and
[03:10:04.840 --> 03:10:10.520]  say i'm a cube believer i'd love to believe that that that's all true but you know i can't sit here
[03:10:10.520 --> 03:10:18.360]  and have uh believe in fairy tales but trump needs to take the gloves off and i'm telling you he has
[03:10:18.360 --> 03:10:24.600]  they've they've now given him the perfect opportunity to pull a castle move and say okay i'm pulling my
[03:10:24.600 --> 03:10:28.600]  nomination for cavanaugh we're going to have your investigations and we're going to investigate
[03:10:28.600 --> 03:10:35.880]  blazy ford too because one of these two lied under oath so both of them weren't an investigation
[03:10:35.880 --> 03:10:40.360]  and we know what will come from that investigation blazy ford cia asset probably you know paid for
[03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:47.000]  by the democrats it's all going to come out it's all already out and that investigation would you
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:52.200]  know prove what the democrats have done whole cloth now is trump going to do that is he going to
[03:10:52.200 --> 03:10:59.480]  let the democrats get away with this i guess we're left to find out but they have now changed
[03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:06.360]  the course of this country whether or not trump gets his supreme court nomination through or not
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:10.040]  because anytime there's a supreme court justice nominated this is what we're going to see now
[03:11:10.040 --> 03:11:18.280]  a circus a freak show so democracy is now dead because democrats have no they'll lie about anything
[03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:22.760]  they don't care and republicans are too cowardly and pc to call them out on it so that's where
[03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:28.840]  we're at now thanks for the call adam let's go to chris in illinois go ahead chris
[03:11:28.840 --> 03:11:40.440]  hello owens yes go ahead hey uh mk altar man i think that's what it is with this uh broad and
[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:45.880]  the other thing is uh was watching pretty much all day yesterday and twice brett hume mentioned
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:55.560]  that he knew uh ford father as well as cavanova's father so then uh last night jota jennifer pointed
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:12:01.560]  out an interesting point he said blazey ford about flying back and forth and all that crap
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:10.600]  she was actually on the east coast the entire time so i don't know if anyone's looked into that but
[03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:16.360]  you think she was out there sipping martinis or getting geared up with their programming
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:21.640]  you know because that's the way she acted looked classic mk ultra i've been around some of that
[03:12:21.640 --> 03:12:27.400]  stuff before you know so i think they were gearing her up getting her getting her program but i
[03:12:27.400 --> 03:12:32.200]  think somebody should definitely look into the fact that she was probably on the east coast
[03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:36.920]  most of the time anyway well you know that's interesting joe de jennifer is one of the
[03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:42.040]  few people on fox news that has been willing to call this woman a liar and oh yeah pretty much
[03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:47.400]  everyone else is taking the pc route so i i salute joe de jennifer saying it like it is
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:54.120]  and some other hosts have been you know questioning of her but again you have to
[03:12:54.120 --> 03:12:58.600]  fight fire with fire the reason why the democrats get away with this crap is because they call him
[03:12:58.600 --> 03:13:04.840]  a gang rapist and nobody calls him a liar i'm on the ground here in chicago i'm in sales
[03:13:04.840 --> 03:13:08.920]  i drive around all day i you know i was in the office this morning and i'm telling you though
[03:13:08.920 --> 03:13:13.400]  i i have a theory i think the longer that the democrats keep going this crap i mean it's just
[03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:17.720]  pissing more people off well this is actually good see chris you're in illinois and i think illinois
[03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:22.280]  is actually going to be one of the best case studies for this now chicago probably going
[03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:27.080]  to go blue no matter what but i i have a lot of family in illinois i spent a lot of time in illinois
[03:13:27.080 --> 03:13:31.240]  growing up growing up in st louis missouri and i'm going to tell you even though there's a lot of
[03:13:31.240 --> 03:13:37.240]  democrats in illinois legitimate blue collar democrats they're capitalists they're they don't
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:41.240]  like the pc culture they're they're they're they're still going to tell you like it is you know what
[03:13:41.240 --> 03:13:46.600]  i'm saying so so illinois is the perfect example i think the average democrat voter in illinois
[03:13:46.600 --> 03:13:52.040]  says looks at this and says this is this is ridiculous i can't go democrats going socialist
[03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:57.320]  out no no no no no the red wave is inevitable unless they they just steal it via the electronic
[03:13:57.320 --> 03:14:02.520]  voting system one of the other interesting things my wife who's a social worker is master of social
[03:14:02.520 --> 03:14:07.160]  work he's you know i think illinois is like one of the but illinois has like some of the most social

[03:20:00.200 --> 03:20:23.880]  all right ladies and gentlemen the last caller chris had a brilliant idea
[03:20:23.880 --> 03:20:36.200]  call lindsay gramm's office 202 this is his dc office 202 224 5972 try to get through leave
[03:20:36.200 --> 03:20:41.480]  a voicemail whatever and thank him for having the courage to call the democrat con job out for
[03:20:41.480 --> 03:20:48.200]  what it is and here's what happens folks then lindsay gramm gets more courage and more energy
[03:20:48.200 --> 03:20:53.720]  to do the same even harder and then he tells other republicans that then they may do the same
[03:20:53.720 --> 03:21:00.520]  and then you call their office and you thank them this is what we have to do so so guys pull it up
[03:21:00.520 --> 03:21:06.840]  one more time everyone needs to call lindsay gramm's office and thank him for the courage to call
[03:21:06.840 --> 03:21:14.520]  out the democrat con job against brett kavanaugh for what it is 202 224 5972 take five minutes
[03:21:14.520 --> 03:21:21.960]  make the call energize lindsay gramm and do it to ted cruise too these the republicans need to know
[03:21:21.960 --> 03:21:28.040]  we don't give a damn about pc culture we hate it that's why we voted for trump
[03:21:29.560 --> 03:21:33.480]  but they need to know that because they still have the fear they still shake in their boots
[03:21:33.480 --> 03:21:41.800]  at the pc world and i will also say this briefly but we need to do serious pull watching when it
[03:21:41.800 --> 03:21:47.400]  comes in november six six elections folks the democrats are going to bust people in to vote
[03:21:47.400 --> 03:21:51.880]  they're going to be voting illegally and we have to do pull watching now there's certain legalities
[03:21:51.880 --> 03:21:58.680]  of this but you can film uh i think it's like 200 yards or 500 yards or something from the polling
[03:21:58.680 --> 03:22:04.440]  place you need to be filming your local polling place folks in fact i probably plan on doing that
[03:22:04.440 --> 03:22:08.920]  myself when i'm not on air because they're going to cheat they're going to bust illegals in they're
[03:22:08.920 --> 03:22:16.040]  going to be busing voters around and the only way to stop them is to catch them on film so start
[03:22:16.040 --> 03:22:24.520]  making plans for that now apparently mark judge cavanaugh's friend is going to cooperate with
[03:22:24.520 --> 03:22:30.200]  some investigation they're saying now so here's the deal trump only has one option in my opinion
[03:22:30.200 --> 03:22:36.520]  right now and that's to pull the castle move switch cavanaugh for barrett uh coen barrett
[03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:43.800]  then launch the fbi investigation they want but go both sides of the aisle go both sides of the aisle
[03:22:43.800 --> 03:22:54.600]  and expose blazey ford for what she is a total democrat cia operative there is more evidence
[03:22:54.600 --> 03:23:02.360]  that proves christine blazey ford is a democrat cia operative then it's not even close than to
[03:23:02.360 --> 03:23:07.400]  any evidence we have that would suggest that brett cavanaugh sexually assaulted blazey ford or anyone
[03:23:07.400 --> 03:23:15.160]  else but but who gets the attack launched against them who gets their life ruined not the liar not
[03:23:15.160 --> 03:23:21.960]  the one with the evidence against him or her no it's brett cavanaugh so we'll see where that
[03:23:21.960 --> 03:23:28.520]  goes now we've got neccole calling in from florida neccole says she is actually a survivor of sexual
[03:23:28.520 --> 03:23:36.200]  assault to which i said the democrats right now are are destroying any woman who's actually survived
[03:23:36.200 --> 03:23:41.000]  sexual assault right now and now making it a boy that cried wolf scenario but let's go to neccole
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:47.000]  who's an actual survivor of this in florida go ahead neccole hey oh and first of all thank you
[03:23:47.000 --> 03:23:52.120]  for what you and the rest of the server there are no words to every day i appreciate you guys so
[03:23:52.120 --> 03:23:57.480]  thank you thank you thank you i'm also engaged to an army combat veteran so i have a definite
[03:23:58.120 --> 03:24:03.640]  new view on life since getting with this guy who has completely kissed my world but yes i survive
[03:24:03.640 --> 03:24:10.120]  um childhood sexual abuse which is even worse because when you're six years old that's a horrific
[03:24:10.120 --> 03:24:16.360]  thing to go through it took me a lot of counseling and a lot of therapy no drugs i also uh live with
[03:24:16.360 --> 03:24:21.560]  medicine allergies so i'm not able to take medication which works for my benefit because i
[03:24:21.560 --> 03:24:26.920]  don't want to be on medication as it so with all that being said the most important thing that i
[03:24:26.920 --> 03:24:32.360]  learned in my healing was that you have to take yourself out of this input in order to get through
[03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:38.760]  the world you have what's called core PTSD as a result of childhood sexual trauma so how this woman
[03:24:38.760 --> 03:24:46.520]  is working and licensed and practicing under the title of doctor blows my mind what blows my mind
[03:24:46.520 --> 03:24:52.120]  even more as a conservative with some liberal tendencies i can't understand the whitewashing
[03:24:52.120 --> 03:24:57.080]  because whitewashing is just a cover for abuse so any republican that isn't going to take that
[03:24:57.080 --> 03:25:04.200]  stand is doing more harm than good not just to women but to our party to our movement and to
[03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:09.560]  america healing so i think that this woman at the very least that moves her license to our
[03:25:09.560 --> 03:25:16.200]  practice and quotes healing people because keeping people stuck and the danger that this on a national
[03:25:16.200 --> 03:25:21.880]  level is providing teaching women across the board especially young women that no stay a victim
[03:25:21.880 --> 03:25:28.280]  is still detrimental to the development of young women that's why i'm calling it so more people
[03:25:28.280 --> 03:25:35.320]  have to take a stand like you know uh cruise and you know when the ground but also what kavanaugh
[03:25:35.320 --> 03:25:40.280]  did just to was absolutely amazing and for being a survivor of those are like thank god there are
[03:25:40.280 --> 03:25:46.600]  strong men in this world because yes a man did what he did to me but i don't hate men as a result of
[03:25:46.600 --> 03:25:53.400]  it as a sexual assault survivor do you think any woman that makes a claim needs to be believed
[03:25:55.480 --> 03:25:58.760]  i think that you should always listen
[03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:06.680]  when they are going through some stuff but i think that don't and oh she said this happened
[03:26:06.680 --> 03:26:11.000]  we're going to take it at least now you know she needs to be thoroughly explored as to where
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:17.080]  is her claim and how valid is her claim is she having some sort of trauma that she's recalling
[03:26:17.080 --> 03:26:23.880]  but she's now identifying falsely him because it's a very delicate into the thing that's just a
[03:26:23.880 --> 03:26:29.240]  lot of psychotherapy a few have been truly through trauma such as i have been and i i'll share a little
[03:26:29.240 --> 03:26:34.040]  bit of mine mine was through a catholic school and i talk about like the the mindbleed that went
[03:26:34.040 --> 03:26:41.000]  through my head of six years old it took a lot of work and it took a lot to do it unmedicated well
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:48.760]  then let me ask you this from what you've seen do you believe that blazy ford um shows signs of a
[03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:54.280]  sexual assault victim does she seem like a sexual assault victim to you no no she seems why so many
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:27:00.600]  women don't come forward she seems the exact reason why most women who have been through that kind of
[03:27:00.600 --> 03:27:04.120]  trauma will be like i'm not even gonna go there because i don't want to be so you're saying
[03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:09.080]  because blazy ford is lying about these things it makes actual victims afraid to come forward
[03:27:10.040 --> 03:27:14.520]  yep yep because i mean like anybody especially in high school can do things that there's you
[03:27:14.520 --> 03:27:20.360]  before you know women tend to like oh this guy attacked me well okay well were you wearing that
[03:27:20.360 --> 03:27:24.200]  short skirt were you putting yourself in that situation as a teenager you're making conscious
[03:27:24.200 --> 03:27:29.640]  decision at six years old when you have somebody telling you hey i work for god there's a whole
[03:27:29.640 --> 03:27:34.680]  different level of understanding and comprehension going on in your growth and development so i hear
[03:27:34.680 --> 03:27:40.360]  someone who recalls as a grown woman in her 40s trying a license to heal people especially with
[03:27:40.360 --> 03:27:47.720]  their mind giving false statements giving false information projecting to be a victim when her
[03:27:47.720 --> 03:27:52.760]  job says she should be doing the exact opposite no i don't believe a thing that's come out of her
[03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:58.120]  mouth as a sexual assault survivor have you ever heard or could you ever imagine a case where a
[03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:02.760]  woman keeps that to herself for 36 years she claims she told her psychiatrist there's no
[03:28:02.760 --> 03:28:07.960]  evidence of that it's not in the notes do you believe that that someone keeps to herself for 36 years
[03:28:09.320 --> 03:28:13.880]  i i can say for my sense i just keep it under my heart for a very very long time
[03:28:14.440 --> 03:28:19.720]  but i did speak out just that the people that i saw help from didn't pull it out of me so you
[03:28:19.720 --> 03:28:23.640]  may have you may have not told people but you at least told a psychiatrist or something
[03:28:23.640 --> 03:28:30.120]  in a in a in a roundabout way yes the queues were there i was seeking help but i would just
[03:28:30.120 --> 03:28:34.840]  wasn't forthright about it because there was a threat to my family so for me growing up and
[03:28:34.840 --> 03:28:39.800]  this is extenuating circumstances i don't think that all people necessarily go through that but
[03:28:39.800 --> 03:28:46.200]  again as a teenager i've been in situations where i've put myself into situations where i could
[03:28:46.200 --> 03:28:50.200]  all right that's that's nicole god bless you nicole thank you so much for calling in a sexual
[03:28:50.200 --> 03:28:56.520]  assault survivor ways in on the cabinal hearings i tried other brands but i came back to my sunshine

[03:34:54.040 --> 03:35:00.600]  about all of what's going on it's ridiculous i'm just curious are you a mother by any chance
[03:35:01.560 --> 03:35:08.600]  no i'm a college age of female which it makes it hard to have friends being standing up for the
[03:35:08.600 --> 03:35:14.360]  truth well let me ask you this then as somebody that's in college i was in college yeah it's 10
[03:35:14.360 --> 03:35:22.280]  years ago um but you know there was a little bit of there wasn't like the concern that you know if
[03:35:22.280 --> 03:35:26.840]  you go with a girl or something and you're drunk or you know whatever happens that that there'll be
[03:35:26.840 --> 03:35:31.800]  some charge or anything against you so there wasn't really like i mean there was that understanding
[03:35:31.800 --> 03:35:37.160]  at least on on my behalf and in my general group of friends hey look you know if a girl's too drunk
[03:35:37.160 --> 03:35:41.240]  you watch out for her and you know you don't you know you don't you don't take advantage of that you
[03:35:41.240 --> 03:35:46.040]  will get called out you know we and that was that was my experience for the most part in college i'm
[03:35:46.040 --> 03:35:50.280]  not saying my experience is the same as everyone's but i hung out with a lot i had a lot of friends
[03:35:50.280 --> 03:35:54.360]  in high school a lot of friends in college i mean i went to pretty much all the different groups all
[03:35:54.360 --> 03:35:59.560]  the different parties and it was pretty much the same like okay yeah we recognize like hey
[03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:05.320]  you you got to be careful and and you don't take advantage of drunk girls you don't you know
[03:36:05.320 --> 03:36:09.160]  fall into bed with one you know and that and if you did you'd get called out you may even get your
[03:36:09.160 --> 03:36:15.160]  ass kicked so but now i feel like and this is what i'm asking you is there a new level of this now
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:20.280]  where a guy like doesn't even want to approach a woman like there's it's almost like a state office
[03:36:20.280 --> 03:36:26.200]  like i don't even want to talk to a girl because i could have an accusation against me yeah there's
[03:36:26.200 --> 03:36:30.760]  actually this thing in the university you have to fill out before you're accepted as a student that's
[03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:36.680]  called like title nine it's all about sexual assault and some of these it goes through questions of
[03:36:36.680 --> 03:36:42.600]  like you know who was the victim and does this need to be reported and some of it's just ridiculous
[03:36:44.200 --> 03:36:49.240]  well and it's all it's this whole thing of just common sense and logic and reasoning being out the
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:56.360]  door it's like oh yeah we can find a way to to legislate everything no common sense and justice
[03:36:56.360 --> 03:37:04.680]  is is on its face you know what i'm saying mm-hmm so what do you think comes next at the university
[03:37:04.680 --> 03:37:09.480]  level are our women saying oh my gosh we're all victims look at what's happening to us or our women
[03:37:09.480 --> 03:37:15.080]  saying oh my gosh i can't believe they're they're making us out to be victims like this honestly i
[03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:20.520]  think most women just love to impress their victimhood because it gives them special privileges
[03:37:20.520 --> 03:37:26.680]  you know it's really pathetic to me that this is what they've done to people in this country it's
[03:37:26.680 --> 03:37:31.480]  not just women but for this example they have all of these women now to think they're victims
[03:37:32.360 --> 03:37:37.320]  and and when you be when you enter that mindset of being a victim you can't do anything you're
[03:37:37.320 --> 03:37:41.320]  handicapped you're handcuffed and that's what they've done to these people and that's why they need
[03:37:41.320 --> 03:37:45.400]  the government thank you so much for the call angel you know what guys i actually want to go let's
[03:37:45.400 --> 03:37:50.440]  let's actually go to erica here i want to try to find a mother i want to ask a mother a question
[03:37:50.440 --> 03:37:54.360]  here let's see if erica's a mother here let's go to erica in california erica if you're not your
[03:37:54.360 --> 03:37:59.720]  mother it's okay but i'm just taking female calls right now are you a high oh and no i'm not a mother
[03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:04.440]  but i am a sister and i do have a father and i do you have but let me ask you this do you have any
[03:38:04.440 --> 03:38:12.200]  brothers i have brother in law yes now now how would you feel if some woman and you know your
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:15.480]  brother-in-law well good people you know that they wouldn't do anything but but some woman
[03:38:15.480 --> 03:38:21.960]  wanted to destroy his life and made false allegations against him how would you feel about that well
[03:38:21.960 --> 03:38:26.840]  let me tell you this much my brother-in-law is a chiropractor okay so he's already touching people
[03:38:26.840 --> 03:38:33.240]  that's his job i had an explicit conversation with him the other day telling him you need cameras
[03:38:33.240 --> 03:38:40.520]  in every single one of your offices and guess what you are a white male you have a great education
[03:38:40.520 --> 03:38:48.280]  you are a target and i apologize for my tone again but oh and i am sent by what the democrats have
[03:38:48.280 --> 03:38:55.320]  done and anyone who is a wife has a husband has a father has a son has a brother should be up in
[03:38:55.320 --> 03:39:02.600]  arms over this what what the democrats are doing is despicable and it's rooted in evil and what is
[03:39:02.600 --> 03:39:08.280]  going on it's just i'm just i'm beside myself over this what happened yesterday i mean i watched the
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:13.480]  whole thing i just stayed home from school i watched the whole thing i was just so shocked
[03:39:13.480 --> 03:39:19.160]  by what i was seeing in america happened yeah i think i think most americans are just like you
[03:39:19.160 --> 03:39:23.160]  but isn't it sad see this is what they eventually they had to do this in russia and other countries
[03:39:23.160 --> 03:39:27.560]  because so many people were faking insurance claims they'd act like you hit hit them with
[03:39:27.560 --> 03:39:32.920]  their car or something like that so people had to install dash cams just to avoid that from happening
[03:39:32.920 --> 03:39:37.640]  now it's like you have to install a camera or wear a body cam around just to make sure some woman
[03:39:37.640 --> 03:39:42.440]  doesn't you know make some sex assault allegation against you to try to destroy your life i hope
[03:39:42.440 --> 03:39:48.360]  you're the first one to put a body cam on because as of yesterday every man should be wearing a body
[03:39:48.360 --> 03:39:55.160]  cam at all times that's how despicable what happened yesterday they have no idea the ramifications
[03:39:55.160 --> 03:40:00.600]  that they've done for what they did yesterday and i tell you what as a woman that woman is lying
[03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:07.560]  a double master's in psychology and a phd you don't think she knows how to trick us as stupid
[03:40:07.560 --> 03:40:12.440]  oh she's totally lying you know this is a problem that that it's not a problem it's a problem in the
[03:40:12.440 --> 03:40:18.440]  pc wuss culture we live in we go with our gut instinct because we know our gut instinct is right
[03:40:18.440 --> 03:40:23.640]  because we've gone with it and 99.9 percent of the time it's right so my gut looks at blazey fortin
[03:40:23.640 --> 03:40:32.840]  says that's a liar despicable lying ruining it for the women who actually have had sexual assault
[03:40:33.480 --> 03:40:38.840]  i get proposed against so this is just what happened yesterday is despicable i am so concerned for
[03:40:38.840 --> 03:40:44.360]  my country i like i said i live here in disgusting california what they're teaching in the school
[03:40:44.360 --> 03:40:48.360]  you you you you don't even touch on what they actually are teaching in the school

[03:49:03.080 --> 03:49:08.360]  that happened to you so many years ago if it did happen you can talk about it you know you don't
[03:49:08.360 --> 03:49:16.280]  have to put on that little whiny voice well you know what they say believe in something even if you
[03:49:16.280 --> 03:49:23.240]  can't remember anything well if she was so devastated by this as she acts right now how
[03:49:23.240 --> 03:49:29.400]  does she get her phd and become a college professor i mean even if yeah her story has
[03:49:29.400 --> 03:49:33.400]  more holes in it than swiss cheese it's ridiculous susan thank you so much for the call let's go

[03:49:39.480 --> 03:49:44.360]  your younger brothers and your sons that day could have some woman with a vendetta against
[03:49:44.360 --> 03:49:49.080]  them to try to destroy their life with false accusations uh thank you for taking my call
[03:49:49.080 --> 03:49:55.880]  yeah i do actually um an incident actually happened to my brother who is now 25 this past year some
[03:49:55.880 --> 03:50:01.480]  girl said that he did some things to her whatever and then she started like writing letters to my
[03:50:01.480 --> 03:50:07.400]  parents um showing up on their doorstep like harassing them saying that he did something that
[03:50:07.400 --> 03:50:12.920]  he didn't so it's already happening happened to someone in my family it was kind of scary
[03:50:12.920 --> 03:50:20.120]  yeah and and you know i don't know if this is something everyone's experienced and
[03:50:21.720 --> 03:50:26.440]  i haven't experienced this personally to this level i've had friends that have experienced this
[03:50:26.440 --> 03:50:31.640]  and i and i didn't want to get into it because i don't even want to go down that road and have
[03:50:31.640 --> 03:50:34.920]  even you know have people from my past drumming it up and being like oh look what everyone's
[03:50:34.920 --> 03:50:41.080]  talking about but yeah yeah it it it happens and it destroys people's lives it's that and
[03:50:41.080 --> 03:50:44.440]  i actually had something else that i wanted to talk to you about because no one else is actually
[03:50:44.440 --> 03:50:52.680]  even brought this up anywhere um so when uh wavy ford was talking and michael was asking
[03:50:52.680 --> 03:50:58.120]  of her about how kevinol or how she met kevinol she said it was through this guy that she wouldn't
[03:50:58.120 --> 03:51:04.440]  name the and um she was potentially at that gathering and this guy they said kind of looked
[03:51:04.440 --> 03:51:09.800]  like kevinol but she still didn't want to say who this guy was right and then when she's been
[03:51:09.800 --> 03:51:15.000]  there asked about the relationship between her and the guy she said we're quote unquote going out
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:21.240]  for a few months and then michael asked well what was your relationship like before and
[03:51:21.240 --> 03:51:26.280]  after the incident and then and she was like well you know we're going out before and after they
[03:51:26.280 --> 03:51:33.960]  just stopped going out so you have this other guy who no one knows who it is potentially looks like
[03:51:33.960 --> 03:51:40.920]  kevinol you know and um with her going to therapy and being a psychologist like there are things
[03:51:40.920 --> 03:51:45.880]  that you can do like hypnotherapy and such to retrieve suppressed memories about incidents
[03:51:45.880 --> 03:51:52.360]  but also different memories can be implanted as well so it just kind of just crazy but let's take
[03:51:52.360 --> 03:51:56.040]  one more step with this and this is going to anger a lot of people but i'm sorry it's real
[03:51:56.760 --> 03:52:02.520]  what about the case and the situation that happens where a girl let's say does get drunk
[03:52:02.520 --> 03:52:08.680]  or inebriated and ends up with a guy uh and then regrets it the next day and because of that regret
[03:52:08.680 --> 03:52:13.720]  and the shame she feels tries to put the blame on the guy and say that she was assaulted how about
[03:52:13.720 --> 03:52:19.480]  that situation yeah i mean i'm sure well nowadays i'm sure that's happening all the time i fear for
[03:52:19.480 --> 03:52:26.120]  myself my son's not even three yet and i oh my it's gonna be even harder for him oh yeah and you
[03:52:26.120 --> 03:52:33.160]  know he's he's a white male so i'm gonna be and afraid for him forever i mean i have family members
[03:52:33.160 --> 03:52:38.200]  that are extremely liberal saying oh wait men are bad i'm like dude oh boy oh i'm sorry to hear
[03:52:38.200 --> 03:52:41.800]  that jacklyn god bless you thank you for your call i've got a hop to another caller let's go to
[03:52:41.800 --> 03:52:48.120]  shannon in california uh also a mother shannon how old are your uh how old are your boys um i have
[03:52:48.120 --> 03:52:52.200]  two sons um first of all it's an honor to speak with you live and i'm a huge supporter of and
[03:52:52.200 --> 03:52:57.480]  for words there are some of us that actually have our heads on straight in california but i
[03:52:57.480 --> 03:53:03.320]  have two sons i have a 22 year old who's actually in the marine and i have an 18 year old son both
[03:53:03.320 --> 03:53:10.760]  of their eyes are wide open and they you know thank god my 18 year old couldn't wait to get
[03:53:10.760 --> 03:53:19.400]  registered to vote um but it is just so scary what's going on and watching cavanaugh yesterday
[03:53:19.400 --> 03:53:26.200]  i mean you can just see the truthfulness and his sincerity juxtaposed with christine's lives and
[03:53:26.200 --> 03:53:31.720]  defeatfulness it's abundantly clear what do you think about what's happening right now though
[03:53:31.720 --> 03:53:37.640]  with this this power this unlimited power they want to give to women to say you can just make
[03:53:37.640 --> 03:53:42.360]  an allegation against a man a man and you have to be believed and we will destroy that man's life
[03:53:42.360 --> 03:53:48.840]  does that make you afraid for your sons it makes me afraid for my sons and to be honest it makes
[03:53:48.840 --> 03:53:57.320]  me like embarrassed that they are making women look like that like i it makes me actually embarrassed
[03:53:57.320 --> 03:54:04.600]  to to say that that that's what women so many are coming to but absolutely and i just try to
[03:54:04.600 --> 03:54:11.400]  teach my son to just in this day and age to just keep their heads on straight and thankfully you
[03:54:11.400 --> 03:54:17.720]  know that we're done with the high school years but my 18 year old he couldn't wait to get out of
[03:54:17.720 --> 03:54:23.240]  his senior year in high school because he was just so sickened by what he saw for himself with being
[03:54:23.240 --> 03:54:30.280]  indoctrinated um yeah and unfortunately my my daughter you know i just i i love all my kids
[03:54:30.280 --> 03:54:35.640]  the same and i do what i can to teach but of course they have to grow up themselves but my daughter
[03:54:35.640 --> 03:54:41.560]  kind of i i know she's unfortunately been kind of indoctrinated by that and she's exactly because
[03:54:41.560 --> 03:54:45.880]  here's what they're doing they're trying to destroy men and women having normal relationships i mean
[03:54:45.880 --> 03:54:50.200]  look i'm not sitting here saying that you know you know males need to go out and just have you
[03:54:50.200 --> 03:54:55.320]  know conquer any woman you know oh yeah no no i'm saying though it's reaching a point where
[03:54:56.120 --> 03:55:01.560]  i mean and let's let's let's let's let's let's take a look at the entire scope of things what's
[03:55:01.560 --> 03:55:07.880]  coming up right now as an industry sex dolls okay so now you're looking at a situation where
[03:55:07.880 --> 03:55:12.200]  an individual might say look i don't want to go anywhere near a woman i don't even want to
[03:55:12.200 --> 03:55:15.320]  think about going near a woman because i don't know that could have a negative impact on my
[03:55:15.320 --> 03:55:20.440]  future life so now men don't engage with women they don't go out and try to you know pick up women
[03:55:20.440 --> 03:55:24.920]  or flirt with women at the bar which is what most women want they're like dying for an alpha male
[03:55:24.920 --> 03:55:29.720]  but now the men are so scared but now the men are so scared so they won't approach the woman because
[03:55:29.720 --> 03:55:34.760]  you know 36 years you might be a rapist and so then what do they do they go masturbate to porn
[03:55:34.760 --> 03:55:41.240]  or or they go buy a sex doll you know it's it's sick and i'm and i'm a single mom by the way and i
[03:55:41.240 --> 03:55:48.920]  absolutely i am like are there any alpha males left out there i am a toxic masculinity linus
[03:55:48.920 --> 03:55:55.800]  and i'm not afraid to admit it screw you if you don't like men screw you all right thank you so

[03:56:14.040 --> 03:56:20.280]  military school because of the indoctrination a couple things i want to point out though first

[03:56:41.880 --> 03:56:49.560]  very vagueness for it to be really pinpointed and and put a you're absolutely righty it's so
[03:56:49.560 --> 03:56:53.240]  obvious and i think the average american sees this and we're reaching a turning point but here's a
[03:56:53.240 --> 03:56:58.360]  thing we cannot be afraid of our shadow we cannot be afraid of political correctness and we we we

[03:57:05.640 --> 03:57:10.600]  allegation is going to be made because we're not pc and that's the big thing and we have to stick to
[03:57:10.600 --> 03:57:18.600]  our guns on this and honestly the only way to save america is for for real americans alpha men alpha
[03:57:18.600 --> 03:57:23.800]  women to buck this system and say i'm not going to be afraid of the pc culture i'm not going to be
