[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:33.640]  We have a big broadcast lined up for you on this Friday edition, June 30th, 2023.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.720]  Roseanne Barr is going to be in studio in Austin, Texas, and I'll be interviewing her
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.800]  from the studio that I'm in, in Omaha, Nebraska.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.360]  My father-in-law had some serious heart issues, and they were saying he could go bye-bye.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.480]  But thanks to your prayers and medical intervention, he has bounced back mightily and made me out
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.520]  of the hospital as early as Monday.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.160]  So I'll be back Sunday in the ATX.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.440]  I want to thank everybody and the crew that has helped me while I've been out of town.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.680]  We've had a really interesting trip in Florida with Pastor Rodney Howard Brown of the River
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.200]  Church at Revival.com, and also with Patrick David and his Valuetainment broadcast.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.200]  That went super viral.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.520]  I had some other podcasts I was going to do while I was in Florida, but I just got too
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.640]  busy with all the other news and developments to be able to do that, but definitely look
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.960]  for a lot of that to be unfolding as well.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:44.400]  Okay, Roseanne Barr, as I said, on the heels of this Holocaust controversy, will be on
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.040]  the air to clarify what she actually said.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.280]  We're going to play in total what she said versus the edited clip.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.960]  And as soon as I saw the clip, I could see that it was jump cuts back and forth to other
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.240]  shots, and I called her.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.120]  I said, is this accurate?
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.200]  She said, no, it's out of context.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.160]  So did the comedian Theo Vaughn, who they're trying to demonize right now and trying to
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.160]  cancel.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160]  The guy's not liberal or conservative.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160]  He's just totally hilarious.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.600]  He's my oldest daughter's favorite comedian.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.320]  She's got a crush on him and has been begging me to get me in contact with him.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.480]  Seriously, she goes to all his shows when he comes to Austin.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480]  I've never met Theo.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.080]  I know he said he'd like to have me on the show.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.000]  He's up in Tennessee.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.840]  And so look for that to be one of the podcasts coming up here very, very soon as well.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.040]  I've always kind of had an allergy to travel.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.040]  I don't mind travel.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.280]  In fact, I like travel, but I don't like to do it for work because I can just sit in my
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.040]  command center with all the news and info and really do a great job.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.960]  But it's also important to travel around and meet the fans and gather intel around the
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.640]  nation and the world and also visit all these other great shows to reach out to new people
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.720]  and remind folks, InfoWars is one of the most censored platforms in the world.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.240]  The way people find it is you telling people about InfoWars.com and the forbidden information.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.080]  I know that's really easy to understand.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]  It's very common sense.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.320]  But do we really promote the show, including myself, like we should when it's got such
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.880]  valuable information?
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.880]  Okay.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.920]  Here, ladies and gentlemen, is what's coming up today.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.440]  And there is a lot of it.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.640]  We've got several clips we're going to cover when we come back of the latest whistleblower
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.120]  information on the Bidens.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.240]  And I'm smiling, not because it is so terrible that our country is run by kleptocrat nutcase
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:38.280]  pedophiles, but that the FBI had these files, the IRS had these files, that they were taking
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.160]  money from the Russians, the Chinese, the Ukrainians, and that Biden was in meetings
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.360]  with Hunter when he's saying, hey, I'm sitting here with my dad, you better give me the million
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.400]  dollars right now, shaking down the chairman of the Communist Party, China.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.520]  But in these IRS and FBI documents, there's a burner phone that they use to carry out
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.400]  the crime, a global burner phone, AT&T.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.360]  One of the big Fox News reporters called the number and President Biden answered.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.720]  I mean, they've been using this one phone for at least five years to carry out serious
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.960]  criminal activity, and they don't give a flying you know what, because they control the Justice
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.960]  Department.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.320]  I'm telling you, Biden could rape children on national TV, he already grubs them and grabs
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.920]  them, and Merrick Garland would do nothing.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.920]  But the joke's on us, we've got these hardcore anti-American criminals that have captured
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.800]  this country, and they're little minions like Jack Smith out there.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.360]  And so it's only going to get worse until we realize what's happened and stop complying
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.040]  with this illegitimate system.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.360]  But look, this system's going down.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.320]  The only question is, will it destroy all of us in the process?
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.320]  That's what we're working against.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320]  Does everybody get destroyed?
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.440]  Hopefully just phase out the new world order and get on a better path.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.320]  I'm never promising a utopia like the left, but definitely a government system run by
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.080]  people that want a civilization and not to destroy one.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.120]  We'll be right back with a huge broadcast today.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120]  Be sure to stay with us.

[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.840]  so does he, Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:39.840]  You wrote a lot of this years ago about the Biden family influence peddling, and you've
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.760]  got new information this morning, breaking news on a cell phone that Joe Biden was using,
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.760]  tell us about that.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.600]  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting, what is the line of communications between Hunter Biden
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.040]  and his business partners and Joe Biden when he's Vice President of the United States?
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.600]  It's not the government phone, it's not Joe Biden's personal phone.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.800]  We know from the laptop that Hunter Biden's business paid for a private phone line that
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.640]  Joe Biden used while he was Vice President.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.120]  It was from AT&T, it was $300 a month, it was a global phone where you could access
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.880]  somebody anywhere around the world.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.760]  We shared that phone number and that account information with people at the House Oversight
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.760]  Committee.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.520]  My hope is that they haven't already, they will subpoena those records because I think
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.000]  it will give an indication on how tight the communication was.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.080]  And that may be the phone, for example, that the Ukrainian, the Burisma executive might
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.600]  have used in this allegation that he talked to Joe Biden and recorded conversations.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.080]  I would just say one other thing, Marie, as it relates to that sort of shakedown phone
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:54.920]  call with Henry Zhao that we alluded to, Henry Zhao in 2015 had already sent $5 million
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.280]  to the Bidens.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.480]  He was the head of a harvest investment firm.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:05.680]  And what's interesting is in the correspondence there, Hunter Biden again talks to Zhao in
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.280]  the context of this is a deal that's important to my family involving his father.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.400]  Let's also keep in mind we fixate on the criminal element of this.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.960]  We also have to focus on the espionage element of this.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.960]  Henry Zhao paid $5 million to Hunter Biden from an account that was part of a company
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:32.380]  that he co-owned with the family of the minister of state security of China, who's in charge
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.420]  of the entire spy apparatus.
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.280]  And you see that in every deal that Hunter Biden did in China.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.160]  These individuals that are sending him money have ties to Chinese intelligence.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.160]  Unbelievable.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160]  We have to take a quick break.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.760]  When the court was turned over for the FBI, there had been some documents that law enforcement
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.760]  had gotten to other means.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.040]  And one of those documents got leaked to me and it had a cell phone number that Hunter
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.040]  Biden was paid for.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.680]  So I figured, well, this is my chance.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680]  Maybe I can.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.320]  I've been trying to get fair comment from Hunter Biden.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.520]  So I'm going to call the cell phone.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.440]  So I called the cell phone and guess who picked up the phone?
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.440]  Oh boy.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.440]  Joe Biden.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.440]  Joe?
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.440]  Joe Biden.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.440]  What?
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440]  Boy, was he shocked when he got, uh, when he picked up the phone and found out it was
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.440]  me.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.440]  He hung up pretty quickly.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.520]  Now, you just heard that for yourself.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.240]  Now we played this many times a couple of years ago, three years ago during the 2020
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.720]  campaign, right before they stole it and I'm springing it on the crew right now to go back
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]  and find it.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720]  I found it again a few weeks ago.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.280]  We played it.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.920]  But it's, it's on Hunter Biden's laptop where he says, I haven't talked to the head of Chinese
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.120]  intelligence in months.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.640]  He's got billions of dollars.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.360]  They may have arrested him.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.200]  What am I going to do, daddy?
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.640]  This is him sending voice messages to his dad and people.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:49.640]  You just heard Solomon, very, very respected, uh, reporter, John Solomon say that he got
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.240]  these documents from the whistleblowers.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:59.320]  He just called the phone last week and the president answered the puppet president on
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320]  the phone.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.720]  He gets the calls against the money on, which just shows the FBI.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.720]  They all know this.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.720]  They're protecting it.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.440]  It's what the government does.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.960]  They've sold the nation out.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.720]  These people are total criminals.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.160]  So I wanted to start, start the broadcast with that today.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.200]  Roseanne Barr is scheduled to be in studio coming up next hour.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.080]  She's a big controversial statements that have been taken out of context where she was
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.640]  making the point that you should be able to make any shocking comment you want.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.200]  Not that I don't think that she simply believes those comments.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.520]  That's the gist of what I got in the full clip of the Theo Von has put out.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.360]  So we'll let her be heard uncensored, live, we'll cover a lot of other issues with Roseanne
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.360]  Barr.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.760]  I really appreciate coming in to studio in the second hour today.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.400]  She lives outside Austin, Texas, beautiful Fredericksburg, Texas.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.960]  And so I appreciate her driving the hour and a half in to be in studio with us.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:00.280]  So we have this big story and all the rest of right now, Biden picks up after journalists
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.640]  call secret burner phone revealed in Hunter scandal.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.760]  This is just getting more and more ridiculous.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.880]  And then we'll dig up that clip a little bit later and play the clip where he's talking
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.480]  about the head of Chinese intelligence.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:22.320]  This isn't that these phone calls and emails and phone numbers are linked to Chinese intelligence.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.120]  It's like saying is Count Dracula linked to vampires?
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.280]  Or is Muhammad Ali linked to heavyweight boxing?
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.160]  Or is Tom Brady linked to most Super Bowl wins?
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.600]  I mean, it's like is water linked to wet or fish linked to the ocean?
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.280]  You cannot get a bigger link than the head of Chinese intelligence, the head of the Communist
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.640]  Party, Chinese intelligence apparatus is the number two person in communist China is the
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.320]  direct handler of Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, the US vice president.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.200]  He was elected vice president Obama on those elections.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.800]  He was not elected this last one.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.560]  And even if I'm wrong about that, it's my right.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.200]  But according to big tech and the CIA, I'm not allowed to talk like that.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]  I'm a dirty American.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.240]  I'm not going to be silenced.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.040]  They can carry out their crimes and sell this country down the incredible river.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.520]  So that's a big report.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.040]  We'll pull that up where he's crying about Chinese intelligence as soon as the crew is
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.640]  able able to find that.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.840]  I know I just sprung that on him, but that and later we'll add it in post, regardless
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.680]  when it goes up on band video later.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.240]  OK, let's look at some of the other big news here.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:35.920]  We have a very interesting development here in the pedo sexualization of children department.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.840]  And I've got a whole bunch of this.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.480]  Let me just tell you what else is coming up and we'll come back for breaking it all.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.000]  Where what I've said has now been officially announced by the Toronto police.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.320]  It is against the law in Canada, in the United States to shake your genitals in front of
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.320]  a child.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.320]  It's indecent exposure.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320]  It's a felony.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.280]  The felony has said that they now believe that if it is a gay pride parade and children
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:05.560]  are taken, the children are allowed to have pot bellied, fat, disgusting men shake their
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.800]  genitals in their faces.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.560]  And we have a bunch of footage of this.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.560]  We've had to blur out.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.640]  I'm really not sure if I want to show it.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.840]  We have some footage we didn't show yesterday of in the United States, a man in his underwear
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.280]  shaking his Johnson in small children's faces with the mother's cheering and walking them
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.280]  up towards them.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.880]  And that ties into this National Geographic that told us how great it is to cut little
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.680]  boys' wee-wees off.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.000]  National Geographic is firing all of its staff riders and will no longer appear in print
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.560]  on newsstands beginning next year.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.280]  So the system's committing suicide.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.600]  Seattle police hunt for a perpetrator of skid marks on Pride crosswalk.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.360]  All their gang signs everywhere.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.440]  Outrageous Planned Parenthood declares virginity a social construct.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.040]  So they want more babies so they can sell their body parts.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.080]  They want more people to get pregnant and then kill the babies because that's their
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.840]  business and business is good.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.400]  And that virginity, just like mothers and fathers are imaginary and two men can have
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.080]  a baby, virginity is a social construct as well.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.840]  We're going to be looking at that.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.600]  Big riots across France.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:16.700]  We have the video coming up of an illegal alien migrant, a precious one, ramming his
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.240]  vehicle into the police trying to run them over.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.960]  So he shoots them.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:27.720]  They shoot him and now because he is a migrant, the country's burning, a bunch of people
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720]  have been killed.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.640]  They're sitting on fire, buses and ramming into government buildings.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.280]  It is just absolute insane, crazy town.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.640]  Yeah, if you guys can, show the runaway buses running around on fire.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.400]  I sent those to you.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:50.520]  They're all up on all up on InfoWars, InfoWars.com and of course, Banned.Video.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.800]  Here, I'll show you the bus footage.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.920]  Yeah, that's stuff burning right there.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:02.800]  Here, I'll just pull up on my phone here, but you really need to see the buses burning.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.800]  Here's the one I sent.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.240]  It says they are now stealing buses in France, Luke Rudowski.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.680]  We can pull that up and have that when we come back from break.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:17.920]  In fact, I'm going to hit France burning and what's all behind this and similar systems
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:24.360]  here in the United States when we return after the break.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.320]  And then there's been some really amazing statements by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.760]  Trump, myself, Steve Bannon and others, so we're going to be playing that.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.960]  Kennedy refuses to attack Trump, thanks him for kind words and proud that President Trump
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.720]  likes him and says he's glad that I like him and Steve Bannon likes him.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.800]  So I mean, I've told you, we've talked to him some.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.800]  He gets it.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.800]  It's too controversial.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.800]  Come on.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.800]  They'll make that a distraction.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800]  That's fine with me.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]  But I think R.F.K.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.800]  Jr. is the real deal.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.040]  Doesn't mean he's perfect, but he really is who he says he is.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040]  He's common sense.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.040]  He's populist.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040]  He has integrity.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.760]  Trump agrees with that.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.280]  And it's not just the biggest sale of the year.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:08.440]  So far, the July 4th super sales have started yesterday up to 60 percent off and double Patriot

[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.520]  A lot of people have asked me, why is InfoWars Store at InfoWars Life not at a probiotic
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.520]  for more than three years?
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.960]  And the answer is simple.

[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.260]  They got bought by a lip tart company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.840]  Jones, anymore.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.720]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.600]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or letdown,

[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.160]  really, really quick.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.160]  I love it.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.160]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.800]  So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.200]  stay nine o'clock at night, got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.400]  or something, and boom, writing an article or writing a book, and then I get two, three
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.480]  hours of energy and then go right to bed after it.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.600]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50 percent off by themselves or 40 percent
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]  off individually.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.160]  A lot of people love these products.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.160]  They've got five-star reviews.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:59.320]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should, 50 percent off, InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:58.150]  So, I want to get back to the pedo stuff in a minute, but I want to finish up with the Biden thing.
[00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:03.150]  Because I kind of got off the subject before I finished making the key points here.
[00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.150]  None of this is new.
[00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:11.150]  These IRS whistleblowers, these CIA whistleblowers, these FBI whistleblowers coming out.
[00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:17.150]  Everything they're telling us is in the laptop that they knew was real when it came out three and a half years ago.
[00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:28.070]  And I remember going through the laptop and then seeing others go through and they found him talking about shaking down the Communist Chinese and saying, you better give us more money.
[00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:35.070]  Or we're going to basically do political things to you that hurt.
[00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:40.070]  Now, remember, this is when Biden was out of power and wasn't vice president anymore.
[00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:46.070]  And so Hunter is mad that he's trying to talk to the Communist Chinese head of intelligence.
[00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.070]  And he thinks he's been arrested.
[00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.070]  Turns out he hadn't been.
[00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:53.070]  He just wasn't talking to him anymore because his dad wasn't the vice president anymore.
[00:34:55.070 --> 00:35:07.070]  And so this particular little clip out of thousands that are on the laptop ties into what Solomon was talking about in that earlier clip, John Solomon.
[00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.070]  So we just tuned in.
[00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.070]  I want to play clip seven with John Solomon again.
[00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.070]  That was like 30 minutes ago.
[00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.070]  I played it.
[00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:17.070]  Some folks have tuned in that weren't listening then so that it's congruent.
[00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.070]  Play seven.
[00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.070]  Then we'll play the clip.
[00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:28.070]  One of many with him specifically talking about this, this, this, this Chinese agent was in the earlier clip that we played.
[00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:37.070]  It also gets into Hunter Biden paid for an AT&T private phone line that Joe Biden used while vice president to conduct bribery, espionage and treason.
[00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:43.070]  And they specifically on Fox News talk about in the documents to the head of Chinese intelligence.
[00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:49.070]  So the Fox host goes, wow, that that's links to the Chinese intelligence.
[00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.070]  It's not links to it.
[00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:56.070]  Again, Mike Tyson is not linked to heavyweight boxing.
[00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.070]  He is heavyweight boxing.
[00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:00.070]  Roger Staubach is not linked to the Cowboys.
[00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.070]  He is the Cowboys.
[00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:05.070]  You know, it's just ridiculous levels of this.
[00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.070]  And there's all sorts of federal laws.
[00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.070]  The Federal Records Act that, yes, when you're a president.
[00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.070]  If you want to declassify things, you can do it.
[00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.070]  But you cannot destroy records, phone line records and things like that.
[00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:27.070]  And you're supposed to use only White House lines or special federal lines that are all recorded for national security and arrest of it.
[00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:30.070]  And you're not supposed to use a burner phone.
[00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.070]  Well, guess what?
[00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:41.070]  Biden used that burner phone to share classified information when he was not even vice president and vice presidents can't do that.
[00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:45.070]  So this is everything they're claiming Trump's done red handed.
[00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.070]  Biden's doing.
[00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:51.070]  And John Solomon calls the number last week.
[00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.070]  Because he flushed out the whole program.
[00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:57.070]  This was just released a few weeks ago.
[00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.070]  But it already confirms what's in the laptops.
[00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.070]  We already knew this three and a half years ago.
[00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.070]  And he calls and President Biden, the puppet.
[00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:08.070]  Oh, Biden answers the phone.
[00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.070]  He's still up there 24 seven selling secrets, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:17.070]  And they turn it all around with Jack Smith and make it about Trump selling foreign government secrets.
[00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.070]  Yeah, right.
[00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:24.070]  Trump wants to dominate the world with soft power and economic power, which is our real power.
[00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:27.070]  And it wants to turn North Korea around and turn Europe around.
[00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.070]  He wants to be the hero.
[00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:32.070]  He wants to have the US number one energy producer.
[00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.070]  He wants to control.
[00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.070]  He wants to be the guy that saves us.
[00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.070]  The globalists don't want that.
[00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.070]  And a guy trying to save you can hurt you.
[00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.070]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.070]  But at least Trump's not out to get people.
[00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:49.070]  When he went along with their poisoned shot they planned years before he even got in office, he was conned.
[00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.070]  And I'm not defending.
[00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.070]  I'm not apologizing.
[00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.070]  I know the inside baseball.
[00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.070]  You know the inside baseball.
[00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.070]  It's all public now.
[00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.070]  So let's go ahead and play the John Solomon clip.
[00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.070]  And then segue into the three plus year old clip.
[00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.070]  I mean, it's been the public domain three years talking about what is now being discussed.
[00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.070]  Here it is.
[00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:11.070]  Before it was turned over for the FBI, there had been some documents that law enforcement had gotten through other means.
[00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.070]  And one of those documents got leaked to me.
[00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.070]  And it had a cell phone number that Hunter Biden was paid for.
[00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.070]  So I figured, well, this is my chance.
[00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.070]  Maybe I've been trying to get fair comment from Hunter Biden.
[00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.070]  So I'm going to call the cell phone.
[00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.070]  So I called the cell phone.
[00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.070]  And guess who picked up the phone?
[00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.070]  Joe Biden.
[00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.070]  Joe?
[00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.070]  Joe Biden.
[00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.070]  What?
[00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.070]  Boy, was he shocked when he picked up the phone and found out it was me.
[00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.070]  He hung up pretty quickly.
[00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.070]  I get calls from my father.
[00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.070]  To tell me that the New York Times is calling.
[00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:45.070]  But my old partner, Eric, who literally has done me harm for I don't know how long, is the one taking the calls.
[00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:49.070]  Because my father will not stop sending the calls to Eric.
[00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:57.070]  I have another New York Times reporter calling about my representation of the, literally, Dr. Patrick Coe.
[00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:03.070]  Dr. Patrick Coe, the spy chief of China.
[00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:11.070]  Who started the company that my partner, who was worth $323 billion, founded.
[00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.070]  And is now missing.
[00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.070]  The richest man in the world is missing.
[00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.070]  Who was my partner.
[00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:31.070]  He was missing since I last saw him in his $58 million apartment and signed a $4 billion deal to build the largest LNG port in the world.
[00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:39.070]  And I am receiving calls from the Southern District of New York from the U.S. Attorney himself.
[00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:45.070]  My best friend in business, Devin, has named me as a witness without telling me.
[00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:51.070]  In a criminal case, and my father, without telling me.
[00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.750]  And again, he's talking about Jack Ma of Alibaba there.
[00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:00.750]  There's another tape where he talks about the intelligence head not calling him to and missing.
[00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.750]  But that's an even better clip they found.
[00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.750]  See, I mean, I was talking about this from years ago, hearing it.
[00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.750]  You can't even keep track of all this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.750]  So, there you go. It's specifically going on.
[00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:16.450]  That's how these folks operate.
[00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:19.450]  You notice the Communist Chinese keep their wealth secret.
[00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:24.450]  We all hear about, oh, it was Jeff Bezos, 150 billion in the register, or Elon Musk.
[00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:26.450]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:30.450]  There are people in Communist China worth $300 billion. That's true.
[00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.450]  But they're nothing compared to the Rothschilds.
[00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:36.450]  They're worth trillions in liquid asset.
[00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:38.450]  They own almost everything.
[00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:41.450]  And now they want your little house, and they want your body, and they want your life,
[00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:44.450]  and they want your children's genitals, and they're getting them.
[00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:46.450]  They're like, why would they want that?
[00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.450]  When you've got that much power and you're that sick generationally,
[00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:54.450]  why would Soros want to spend over $50 billion now in the last 20 years
[00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:56.450]  getting control of almost every district attorney in the country
[00:40:56.450 --> 00:41:02.450]  and 22 of the U.S. attorneys, 23 of the state attorney generals,
[00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:07.450]  and a whole bunch of the U.S. attorneys, obviously, and the rest of it under Biden.
[00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:10.450]  Oh, Biden. I mean, these people rule us.
[00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:12.450]  They control the police. They control the courts.
[00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:15.450]  They control our bodies. They want to with the poison shots.
[00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.450]  They're hitting us with GMO. They're hitting us with 5G.
[00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:19.450]  They're hitting us with all the chemtrails.
[00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:23.450]  And we see what's happening. We're mutating and we're dying.
[00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.450]  But they're mutating and dying too.
[00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.450]  Look at crackhead Hunter Biden. Look at the Rothschilds,
[00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:31.450]  walking around all hunchbacked, all crazy.
[00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:35.450]  We've allowed the scum of the earth to run things, and it's time it stops.
[00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:37.450]  Roseanne Barr is coming up.
[00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.450]  I want to go to break here in a few minutes.
[00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:44.450]  We're going to come back and get into the pedo news
[00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:51.450]  and how in Canada the government says, no, you're allowed to be naked at a pedo parade
[00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:54.450]  and shake your genitals in front of a child's face even though it's illegal
[00:41:54.450 --> 00:42:02.450]  because it's LGBTPS for Satan, the little pedophile Satan, PS.
[00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.450]  That's coming up.
[00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:09.450]  Before we go any further, we are listener-supported,
[00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:13.450]  and I'm very, very thankful to all of you, and I appreciate all of you.
[00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:16.450]  And you've really come through the last four or five days.
[00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:20.450]  We have dug out of the hole about 20%.
[00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:24.450]  So we brought in extra funds on top of what we regularly bring in,
[00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.450]  but it's dug us out of the hole about 20%.
[00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.450]  And now we can just dig out the other 80% in the next few weeks,
[00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:33.450]  and then I can just bring in some new products and do a good job of promoting them.
[00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.450]  We're going to be completely stabilized and, again, can move forward.
[00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:39.450]  But we're coming up to the end of the bankruptcy, and it's going well.
[00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.450]  By going well, it's like we're running a marathon, and I've got, like, 100 yards left,
[00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.450]  but I'm about to fall over here.
[00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:48.450]  And this is all neck-and-neck, like, again, a sudden-death overtime football game.
[00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:50.450]  Plus, these are really great products you need.
[00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:52.450]  So I want to thank those of you that got the products.
[00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.450]  I want to encourage those of you that haven't.

[00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:08.450]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:12.450]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.450]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:19.450]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at Infowarsstore.com, like books and films
[00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:22.450]  and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:58.450]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:44:58.450 --> 00:44:59.450]  Please take action.
[00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:05.450]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:07.450]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:08.450]  It is.
[00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:13.450]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:14.450]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:16.450]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.450]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:21.450]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.450]  Krill oil is the best.
[00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:24.450]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:25.450]  And I'm sorry.
[00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:26.450]  You want something like this?
[00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:27.450]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.450]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:30.450]  It's so good in my view.
[00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:32.450]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:35.450]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.450]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:43.450]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:48.450]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.450]  But you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got,
[00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:52.450]  I just can't lie to you.
[00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:53.450]  I just can't do it.
[00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:03.450]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:08.450]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at Infowarstore.com.
[00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:13.450]  They are both clones of national bestselling products from a major pharmaceutical
[00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:16.450]  slash supplement maker that are Lister's and Patriot's.
[00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.450]  They're allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:24.450]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:29.450]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain
[00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:32.450]  and to also make your nerves healthier,
[00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:37.450]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:40.450]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:46.450]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD
[00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:50.450]  exclusively at Infowarstore.com right now.
[00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:52.450]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:56.450]  You'll find them exclusively at Infowarstore.com and they fund their operation.
[00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:06.450]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:22.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Friday edition.
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:26.140]  Rosie Imbar is arriving at the studios, we should have her in studio, coming up start
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.140]  of the next hour.
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.860]  It'll be a big First Amendment discussion, and she'll be able to clarify some of the
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:33.700]  controversial things she's been saying.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.020]  But I want to talk now about the pedos and finish up with that, and then I want to hit
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.020]  R.F.K.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:42.260]  Jr., saying he's proud that President Trump likes him, and glad that I like him, along
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.260]  with others.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.300]  And that's a very important statement, and I'll describe why I think that's the case.
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:52.940]  And we'll also look at legendary comedians Dana Carvey and Dave Spade, Destroy Dr. Fauci.
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.980]  See how unpopular it is to be in the New World Order now?
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.460]  See how we're becoming the mainstream?
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.780]  Told you that was going to happen.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.940]  We've got to be ready for victory.
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:06.180]  We're not offering a utopia, we're not claiming free this and free that, but we are claiming
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:12.380]  that we can turn things around from these globalists, and certainly not destroy everything.
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:16.980]  Across the establishment, from Hollywood to Main Street, to the rural areas of this country
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:21.460]  and around the world, people are really awake, all I get is love everywhere now.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:25.340]  And I was rough five, six years ago, got quite a bit of hate, still mainly love, but now
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.340]  nothing but love.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.060]  Rob, you've been with me in Omaha.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.060]  We got anything but love?
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.740]  I haven't seen any hate.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.740]  Absolutely.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:32.740]  Nothing but love.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.740]  And again, I'm not saying we're not going to get some at some time, but I mean, I think
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.500]  I've gotten yelled at like once in nine months now, ten months, I mean, I travel all over
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.500]  the country.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:45.340]  So again, the globalists are in trouble, Bill Gates is hated, Obama is hated, the New World
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.340]  Order is in trouble.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:51.100]  So I mentioned this earlier that these pedo parades really have just become nothing but
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.140]  pervert parades sponsored by major corporations.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:49:00.460]  And so here's a report where a citizen journalist called in Rob Primo, the Toronto police to
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:04.940]  complain about naked men running around at the gay pride parade.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.300]  Before I even said that, the cop knew that he said, well, they're just allowed to do
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.300]  it.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.300]  Doesn't matter what's against the law.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.140]  They're allowed to because they're special.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.140]  They're protected.
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:13.140]  Here's the clue.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:17.260]  If I could ask a police officer a question.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:18.260]  Thank you.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.260]  Thank you for calling.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:20.260]  Hi there.
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:25.580]  I was just looking to ask an officer a question and then I got forwarded to you.
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:29.860]  Is there I just want to make sure I'm not working outside of any laws or anything like that.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:35.780]  If you want to be out in the street, you you have to be fully clothed and you can't
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.700]  be naked or anything like that, right?
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:44.140]  Well, I mean, there are naked people running around on the street.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.140]  Okay.
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.460]  But is that against the law?
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.460]  There'd be some mental health issues.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.460]  Oh, okay.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.180]  I agree with you on that one.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:58.620]  I just I'm having a hard time yesterday I seen a bunch of people naked in front of children
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:03.260]  and police officers, you know, seeing men with their penis out in front of kids.
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:07.620]  And I'm just wondering if that's acceptable part of that part of the pride.
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:08.620]  You mean was on the weekend?
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.620]  Yeah.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.620]  I was at the pride parade.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.620]  Yeah.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:12.620]  Yeah.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.420]  So that's that's always the issue that I'm each year.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.260]  Is that what's the issue with that?
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.260]  Sorry.
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.900]  I mean, that happens every year.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:25.900]  Oh, so like, it's kind of like it's okay for when it's at the pride parade, but not in
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:26.900]  other situations.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:27.900]  Obviously.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.900]  Exactly.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.180]  I would I would say so.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.180]  Yeah.
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.180]  Okay.
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:34.180]  Well, thank you very much for your time.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.180]  Oh, you're very welcome.
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.180]  Bye now.
[00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:43.910]  So what they're doing is normalizing it with our children, normalizing it in front of us.
[00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:44.910]  They're conquering us.
[00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:46.910]  They're putting their flags everywhere, putting them on the streets.
[00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:51.450]  If you remove one, if you criticize it in Canada, the UK, you get arrested.
[00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:57.670]  This is a corporate-funded cult to destroy the families and break down society, period.
[00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:02.149]  And it doesn't matter if it destroys Bud Light or National Geographic or North Face
[00:51:02.149 --> 00:51:03.149]  or any of these companies.
[00:51:03.149 --> 00:51:07.470]  They will destroy themselves to carry this out because they're owned by BlackRock and
[00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:13.549]  they are being sent as kamikazes by the Mothership, by the Rothschilds, by the Rockefellers, by
[00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:16.109]  the New World Order.
[00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:22.950]  That's why Planned Parenthood came out and said, have sex, get pregnant, don't be a virgin
[00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:24.830]  because they want those baby parts.
[00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:28.549]  They don't want single mothers to have the kids.
[00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:29.549]  They don't want babies, period.
[00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:33.109]  But if you are, they want you single and all alone.
[00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:34.670]  So the state can raise the children.
[00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:36.029]  This is social engineering.
[00:51:36.029 --> 00:51:43.109]  I've played clips of globalists like Paul Ehrlich on TV in 1975 saying, we're going
[00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:46.910]  to take over the culture, we're going to destroy the families, we're going to show every example
[00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:52.109]  of men being bad and families being bad, and women being the heroes, to not empower women
[00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:56.450]  but to get women isolated and controlled so the globalists can destroy the reproductive
[00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:58.109]  system of our species.
[00:51:58.109 --> 00:52:00.950]  We're all in this together.
[00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:06.710]  We need to come together as populists, transcend left and right, and be pro-human.
[00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:10.310]  Now that's what Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is doing.
[00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:15.149]  And I played a clip of him yesterday saying, we're not coming for your guns, it's the SSRIs,
[00:52:15.149 --> 00:52:17.230]  I'm not going to take the guns, it's not the guns.
[00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:22.670]  I used to have a gun club when I was in high school at school, just like my dad did, just
[00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:28.990]  like a lot of your parents did, and grandparents, and he said, we need to go after the people
[00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:30.190]  who are on the SSRIs.
[00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:31.190]  That's almost all the mass shootings.
[00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:35.509]  It's a certain type, it's a certain MO, the incel, basically.
[00:52:35.509 --> 00:52:38.910]  They're into the occult, they're into devil worship, they're into violence, they're into
[00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:42.350]  nihilism and committing suicide, instead of killing themselves, they come and they kill
[00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:44.629]  at the school because the media advertises it.
[00:52:44.629 --> 00:52:46.750]  Why is it happening?
[00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:50.270]  Because it's a copycat form of mass mind control.
[00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:57.190]  So he's on a national program and he gets asked, what do you think of Trump saying that
[00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.190]  he thinks you're a populist and a common sense guy?
[00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:05.509]  And he says, well, not only do I think that's good, I'm proud of it, because I've been able
[00:53:05.509 --> 00:53:06.390]  to unify people.
[00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:10.790]  And so he's against open borders saying they're creating a permanent underclass
[00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.950]  and sex slaving, which is true. He's against gun control saying that isn't
[00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:18.550]  the issue, it's the mental illness and the Satanism. He is against the carbon
[00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:21.710]  tax saying it's a giant fraud by mega rich banks to shut down all their
[00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:25.830]  competition and virtually integrate the economy and start the third world. And I
[00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:30.630]  mean he's sitting on all cylinders. He's Alex Jones 2.0. And so is Joe Rogan and
[00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:35.190]  so is Tucker Carlson. And yeah, I'm the first on a major platform to expose the
[00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:38.790]  real world paradigm. And that's what this is folks. This is the 35,000 foot
[00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:42.390]  view. It's not been my opinion. It's studying and we've now done it together.
[00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:47.510]  This audience, our crew, the guest InfoWars did this. So if you ever
[00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:50.670]  supported the broadcast, if you ever prayed for us, if you ever shared the
[00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.950]  articles and videos, you're part of the big victory that's recognized that is
[00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:58.270]  this transmission. That educated people about the real world view, about how the
[00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:02.950]  globalists operate and help create an alternative plan to it. And we have now
[00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:06.550]  had great success and have a fighting chance thanks to you, your support out
[00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:10.510]  there. Never forget that viewers. Let's go to the clip of RFK Jr. Here it is.
[00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:15.270]  You say that you're a Democrat, but you're getting a lot of support from a
[00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:19.870]  lot of leading voices on the right like Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, Alex
[00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:24.830]  Jones, former President Donald Trump. Many Democrats fear that you're a spoiler
[00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:28.350]  in the race, that you will damage President Biden in the primary and
[00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:32.390]  grease the skids for former President Trump to return to the Oval Office. This
[00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:37.230]  week, former President Trump said about you, Kennedy is smart and he's a
[00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:41.950]  common sense guy. What kind of man do you think Donald Trump is?
[00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:47.110]  Well, you know, here's what I'm not going to do in this race. I'm not
[00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:50.990]  going to attack other people personally. I don't think it's good for our
[00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:54.990]  country. And I think, you know, what I'm trying to do in this race is bring
[00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:59.110]  people together, is to try to bridge the divide between Americans. And guess
[00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:05.350]  what? The, you know, when my dad died, and we took this train ride from, you
[00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:08.550]  know, this seven and a half hour train ride that was supposed to be two hours
[00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:11.510]  and brought his body. I was with him when he died in Los Angeles. And then
[00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:17.830]  we brought his body from from New York, Penn Station to Union Station and
[00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:22.150]  Washington, DC. And there were there were, it was a two and a half hour ride,
[00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:24.230]  but it took seven and a half hours because there were two and a half
[00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:28.790]  million people on that train track. And, and it was a cross section of
[00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:33.710]  America and all of the major urban stations in Trenton, Newark, Wilmington
[00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:36.550]  and Baltimore, there were black Americans singing Battle Hymn of the
[00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:41.750]  Republic, there were whites on the in the rural areas, who are holding up
[00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:45.750]  signs, goodbye, Bobby, pray for us, Bobby, American flag standing, saluting.
[00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:50.310]  Four years later, and they have supported my father in the primaries
[00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:55.750]  in 1968. Four years later, in 1972, they were not supporting my father,
[00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:58.870]  and they were not supporting they were not supporting George McGovern, who
[00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:03.350]  was aligned with my father and all these issues. Instead, the vast majority
[00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:09.990]  of them were supporting George Wallace. And, you know, there, my father was
[00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:16.550]  able to harness these populist energies, the last day on the most
[00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:19.830]  rural state. The clip goes on for a while, we're going to play it for
[00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:23.190]  Roseanne Barr next hour, and we'll add it in post, we post the video, the
[00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:26.070]  whole clip right now, I have that added guys, thank you. But but what he's
[00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:28.310]  saying is we're bringing people together, he goes on to say he's proud,
[00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:32.510]  and likes the fact that the people you just mentioned, like him, so he wants
[00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:35.710]  our endorsement. He wants everybody. And and he's not going to say it was
[00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:38.350]  neither is Trump, but he's a lot better than New World Order, ladies and
[00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:42.630]  gentlemen, and they hate his guts. Speaking of support, we have the biggest

[00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:38.510]  starting to dig out of the hole. I want to get way out of the hole and expand.
[00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:41.910]  But we only do that with your support. So please take action now info war
[00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:45.390]  store.com. You can also make a straight donation at info war store.com. Our
[00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:46.790]  number two with Roseanne Barr coming up.
[00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:51.890]  InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:55.890]  And so, please, go to InfoWars store and just make a donation.
[00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:57.890]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:00.890]  You have a little profile there, cancel anytime.
[00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:05.890]  Every 15 days, every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, up to 9 months,
[00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:08.890]  you can go in and every month or every week,
[00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:10.890]  whenever you want, you program it, you just click it,
[00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:12.890]  and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:13.890]  So please do that as well.
[00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:16.890]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees,
[00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:18.890]  instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:20.890]  But these really are amazing products.
[00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:22.890]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:25.890]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:27.890]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:28.890]  People are listening more than ever.
[00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.890]  But in this major recession, going into depression,
[00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:33.890]  and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:34.890]  I know times are tough.
[00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:36.890]  So thank you for your support.
[00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:39.890]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:41.890]  That you can do for free.
[00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:43.890]  It's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:45.890]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us,
[00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:46.890]  please support us now.
[00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.890]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:49.890]  God bless you.
[00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:53.890]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:55.890]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:59.890]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:01.890]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars,
[00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:04.890]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:08.890]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:10.890]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:12.890]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:14.890]  five, six, seven days a week,
[00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:16.890]  it's really just incredible.
[00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:18.890]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew,
[00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:20.890]  I thank you for your past support.
[00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:24.890]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air
[00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:26.890]  if you do not support us.
[00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:27.890]  I know you spread the word.
[00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:28.890]  I know you pray for us.
[00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:29.890]  And that's wonderful.
[00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:30.890]  Keep doing it.
[00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:33.890]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com.
[00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.890]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:38.890]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:40.890]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:42.890]  actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:46.890]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com,
[00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:47.890]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:49.890]  Please take action now.
[00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:54.890]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:56.890]  you are the resistance.
[00:59:56.890 --> 01:00:09.890]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowars
[01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:11.890]  and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:15.890]  but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:20.890]  From the front lines of the information war,
[01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:22.890]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:28.890]  He.
[01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:29.890]  He.
[01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:30.890]  He.
[01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:31.890]  He.
[01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:40.890]  Ex-head of respiratory research at Pfizer, Mike Yeadon,
[01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:43.890]  and researchers including Craig Pardecouper
[01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:48.890]  have sourced VAERS data on vaccine death and injury in the US,
[01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:53.890]  a database of over 700,000 adverse reactions
[01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:58.890]  caused by the Moderna, Pfizer and Janssen vaccines.
[01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:02.330]  These vaccines have been deployed in different batches,
[01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:05.009]  officially referred to as lots.
[01:01:05.009 --> 01:01:07.649]  This has allowed Yeadon's team to back engineer
[01:01:07.649 --> 01:01:12.649]  Big Pharma's COVID-19 vaccine deployment agenda in the US.
[01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:14.410]  All their information is published
[01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:19.330]  at howbadismybatch.com and howbad.info.
[01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:21.810]  And what we learn is quite telling.
[01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:26.730]  About 0.5% of all the different batches are highly toxic,
[01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:30.330]  resulting in hospitalization, disability and death
[01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:33.089]  within days or weeks of injection.
[01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:36.089]  Other batches cause minimal adverse reactions
[01:01:36.089 --> 01:01:39.130]  and most appear to be harmless placebos.
[01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:41.089]  When plotting on a timeline,
[01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:43.089]  we can see that these three companies
[01:01:43.089 --> 01:01:45.690]  have been working together to quietly monitor
[01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:49.810]  the lethal effectiveness of specific deadly batches.
[01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:52.529]  While one company is deploying a lethal batch,
[01:01:52.529 --> 01:01:54.810]  the other two deploy harmless ones,
[01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:56.810]  creating the scientific environment
[01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:59.609]  to perform dose range finding
[01:01:59.609 --> 01:02:04.049]  or the maximum tolerated dose for each specific batch.
[01:02:04.049 --> 01:02:07.370]  The timeline shows that each lethal batch deployment
[01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:11.049]  is preceded and followed by a quiet period,
[01:02:11.049 --> 01:02:13.569]  allowing them time to establish their baseline
[01:02:13.569 --> 01:02:16.609]  before the next deadly batch is deployed.
[01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:19.250]  Private leaked documents from the CDC
[01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:21.649]  show a list of expiry dates
[01:02:21.649 --> 01:02:24.210]  and only certain lots are included,
[01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.930]  the very same lots found to be highly toxic
[01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:30.370]  in part of Cooper's database, which makes sense.
[01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:32.930]  There would be no reason to list expiration dates
[01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:37.250]  for saline placebo, only the deadly ones.
[01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:40.170]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability
[01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:44.290]  to direct deadly batches into specific populations,
[01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:46.850]  such as red states,
[01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:50.290]  analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated
[01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:53.730]  in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority
[01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:57.450]  of vaccine deaths are happening in red states.
[01:02:57.450 --> 01:03:00.490]  Some red states are experiencing 11 times
[01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:03.370]  more vaccine deaths than other states.
[01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:05.970]  On average, red states are experiencing twice
[01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:09.370]  the amount of vaccine death and injuries than blue states.
[01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:11.810]  After ruling out other possibilities,
[01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:14.250]  part of Cooper concluded that this can only be due
[01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:16.370]  to the fact that red states received
[01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:18.970]  at least twice as much of the lethal batches
[01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.290]  than blue states did.
[01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:23.810]  Among several other crimes,
[01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:26.810]  they are tipping the scales of the democratic process
[01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:30.130]  by killing people who voted against the new world orders,
[01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:32.930]  woke, build back better, great reset,
[01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:37.009]  while at the same time, endlessly flooding the borders
[01:03:37.009 --> 01:03:39.049]  with unvaccinated foreigners.
[01:03:40.089 --> 01:03:41.770]  And it's happening right now.
[01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:45.690]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:49.370]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:54.370]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:59.370]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:04.370]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.

[01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:18.370]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:27.370]  We are now into hour number two of this Friday worldwide broadcast.
[01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:29.370]  Roseanne Barr is in the studio.
[01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:32.370]  They're getting her mic'd up right now, which is perfect timing,
[01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:36.370]  because I want to air a few clips in context of some of the background things
[01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:38.370]  that have happened here, and I want to ask her,
[01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:41.370]  is this like the Kanye West thing?
[01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:44.370]  A massive trolling operation to exercise the First Amendment,
[01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:46.370]  or was she taken out of context?
[01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:52.370]  And then I want to cover a bunch of other incredible developments with her here today.
[01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:56.370]  We appreciate her coming in, and we believe whether you agree with what she said,
[01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:59.370]  out of context or in context, or whether you disagree with it,
[01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:01.370]  she has a right to say it.
[01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:04.370]  And the reason that's so important is, this is Fox News.
[01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:06.370]  This just broke 20 minutes ago.
[01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:08.370]  It's going up on InfoWars.com.
[01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:10.370]  You see this right here?
[01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:24.370]  Michigan House passes bill making wrong pronouns a felony finable to up to $10,000.
[01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:32.370]  Under the new bill, intimidating an individual with wrong pronouns can result in prison time or a $10,000 fine.
[01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:36.370]  Same thing in California. This is even stronger, this is a felony.
[01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:44.370]  So, when a big old guy comes in, but he's got a pink mohawk, and he walks up and he bench presses 500 pounds, he's like 6'7".
[01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:49.370]  Looks like, you know, Lou Ferrigno in his prime, and he says,
[01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:51.370]  Give me a pack of cigarettes.
[01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:53.370]  You go, uh, sure.
[01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:58.370]  Ma'am, I told you, it's ma'am.
[01:07:58.370 --> 01:08:01.370]  He goes and files a complaint, and those police that won't show up when you're getting raped or murdered,
[01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:04.370]  they show up faster than you can say lickety-split.
[01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:07.370]  They haul your ass in, you're going down.
[01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:16.370]  A recently passed bill in Michigan would make it a felony to intimidate someone that's going to the governor's desk by using the wrong gender pronouns.
[01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:22.370]  Michigan State House of Representatives has passed bill HB4474,
[01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:27.370]  a piece of legislation that criminalizes causing someone to feel threatened by word.
[01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:32.370]  So, that's the hate crime stuff, where you didn't really commit a crime, but somebody felt hurt.
[01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:34.370]  You didn't call for violence, but somebody felt hurt.
[01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:42.370]  Under the new bill, offenders are guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine not more than $10,000.
[01:08:42.370 --> 01:08:45.370]  And it goes on, so we'll be talking about that.
[01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:49.370]  But let's go ahead and play our last big controversial interview, some clips of that.
[01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:58.370]  Then we'll play what they edited out of context of her versus what she really said on the popular, super popular talk show of Theo Vaughn.
[01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:02.370]  So let's play the two-minute Kanye West compilation from last year.
[01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:05.370]  That was the number one viral clip of 2022.
[01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:08.370]  Let's play that clip from last December, clip 25.
[01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:09.370]  Here it is.
[01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:10.370]  I do love Hitler.
[01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.370]  I don't really care that much about Hitler.
[01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:13.370]  I love him.
[01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:14.370]  I love him.
[01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:21.370]  There's a lot of things that I love about Hitler, a lot of things.
[01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:23.370]  The Holocaust is not what happened.
[01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:25.370]  Let's look at the facts of that.
[01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:27.370]  And Hitler has a lot of redeeming qualities.
[01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:28.370]  Now what?
[01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:29.370]  Now, I'm a Nazi, Ari Emmanuel.
[01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:32.370]  The Zionists cannot tell me who I can love and not love.
[01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:35.370]  People have had issues with Jewish people forever.
[01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:36.370]  I love Hitler.
[01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:37.370]  Play it out.
[01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:38.370]  Nobody knows who the ADL are.
[01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:39.370]  Stop giving them attention.
[01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:40.370]  Nobody cares about the ADL.
[01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:41.370]  ADL, shut up.
[01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:45.370]  I don't like Nazis, and I don't like what some of the mafias are doing either.
[01:09:45.370 --> 01:09:46.370]  I like Hitler.
[01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:47.370]  You're not a Nazi.
[01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:49.370]  You don't deserve to be called that and demonized.
[01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:55.370]  Well, I see good things about Hitler also.
[01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:56.370]  You love Jim Jones.
[01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:58.370]  You love Jeffrey Dahmer.
[01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:59.370]  Absolutely.
[01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:01.370]  Do you know who I am now, Netanyahu?
[01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:05.370]  What we did is we brought Netanyahu with us.
[01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:06.370]  It was bad.
[01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:10.370]  It was bad for Trump to meet with me and you.
[01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:12.370]  And the Nazis, in my view, were thugs.
[01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:14.370]  It shook people down and did a lot of really bad things.
[01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:15.370]  But they did good things too.
[01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:17.370]  We're going to stop dissing the Nazis all the time.
[01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:18.370]  I like Hitler.
[01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:19.370]  I don't like Hitler.
[01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:20.370]  Him on NPR.
[01:10:20.370 --> 01:10:22.370]  Don't forget about me.
[01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:26.370]  Him on NPR and him on 60 Minutes saying the best.
[01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:29.370]  It's like he had a really cool outfit and stuff, and he was a really good architect.
[01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:31.370]  And he didn't kill 6 million Jews.
[01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:33.370]  That's just, like, factually incorrect.
[01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:35.370]  Yeah, but Nazis are, like, kind of cool.
[01:10:35.370 --> 01:10:38.370]  I'm actually tired of hearing about the Jews.
[01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:41.370]  But I also love Nazis.
[01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:44.370]  The Zionists.
[01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:49.370]  Okay, well, why would the Zionists be killing Jews en masse in Israel with the poison shot?
[01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.370]  I'm not trying to be shocking.
[01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:52.370]  I like Hitler.
[01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:54.370]  Germans had a really cool leader at one time.
[01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:56.370]  I don't like the word evil next to Nazis.
[01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:58.370]  I think we need to look at...
[01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:00.370]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:05.370]  But for the ADL, I want to say there's a lot of good Nazis that were just fighting for their country.
[01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:07.370]  Bring in the clowns.
[01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:10.370]  There will be clowns.
[01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:13.370]  All right.
[01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:17.370]  I still haven't figured out exactly what he was doing or why he said that and why he went there.
[01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:21.370]  But I know that America is being blamed for Hitler.
[01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:25.370]  And if you're conservative, a Christian, a populist, you don't want to take a shot, you're called a Nazi.
[01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:34.370]  So there's a big backlash by people, including black folks like Kanye, who I think are saying, hey, don't call me a Nazi anymore.
[01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:39.370]  Or I'll take your sacred cow or your religion of being a victim of Hitler.
[01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:41.370]  And that's like a leftist religion.
[01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:43.370]  And I'm going to desecrate it.
[01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:44.370]  I'm going to defile it.
[01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:46.370]  The whole transgender thing is a cult.
[01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:48.370]  That's what this is.
[01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:49.370]  And it's out of control.
[01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:51.370]  Again, I'm tired of being called a Nazi.
[01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:56.370]  I think the Nazis were terrible and killed 20 million Germans in the process and a lot of other people.
[01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:58.370]  And Hitler was a loser in my view.
[01:11:58.370 --> 01:12:00.370]  And both my grandfathers fought Hitler.
[01:12:00.370 --> 01:12:02.370]  And I almost don't exist because of Hitler.
[01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:08.370]  But I also have some fetish about Hitler and obsessing over Hitler like Hollywood and thousands of movies about Hitler.
[01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:10.370]  And it just builds Hitler up into something too big.
[01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:13.370]  And then people see it and say, well, I'm against Hollywood and the New World Order.
[01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:15.370]  Hitler must be good.
[01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:17.370]  No, you can have two bad things.
[01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:25.370]  So because one thing is bad, the whole leftist New World Order, communism, censorship, the left does not mean something that's supposedly the opposite.
[01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:27.370]  National socialism is not really the opposite.
[01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:29.370]  It doesn't mean it's good.
[01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:30.370]  And I've tried to explain that.
[01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:31.370]  ADL bad.
[01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:32.370]  Hitler bad.
[01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:33.370]  Hitler bad.
[01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:34.370]  Stalin bad.
[01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:36.370]  Lenin bad.
[01:12:36.370 --> 01:12:38.370]  ADL bad.
[01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:40.370]  Southern Poverty Law Center bad.
[01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:42.370]  ISIS bad.
[01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:44.370]  KKK bad.
[01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:46.370]  A lot of bad stuff.
[01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:48.370]  A lot of good stuff as well.
[01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:50.370]  So here is the edited clip.
[01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:55.370]  As soon as I saw this, I could see it was jump cuts heavily edited to take things out of context.
[01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.370]  So here she is giving statements.
[01:12:57.370 --> 01:13:02.370]  She's saying are things you should be allowed to say even if people disagree with them or even if they're not true.
[01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:05.370]  So here is a compilation clip.
[01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:12.370]  This is a 26 Roseanne Barr saying that no one died in the Holocaust and the six million Jews should die.
[01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:13.370]  Here it is.
[01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:15.370]  That's the truth.
[01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:17.370]  And don't you dare say anything against her.
[01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:24.370]  You'll be off YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and all the other ones because we have you know, there's such a thing as the truth.
[01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:26.370]  And facts and we have to stick to it.
[01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:28.370]  And you know.
[01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:29.370]  It's scary.
[01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:31.370]  And that is the truth.
[01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:33.370]  And nobody died in the Holocaust either.
[01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:35.370]  That's the truth.
[01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:36.370]  Yeah.
[01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:37.370]  It should happen.
[01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:42.370]  Six million Jews should die right now because they cause all the problems in the world.
[01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:43.370]  But it never happened.
[01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:45.370]  But it never happened.
[01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:46.370]  Yeah.
[01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:47.370]  Mandated.
[01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:50.370]  Well, you're because you're part Jewish, right?
[01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:51.370]  Part of your family is Jewish.
[01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:52.370]  I'm all Jewish.
[01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:53.370]  You're all Jewish.
[01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:54.370]  And a lot of Hollywood is Jewish.
[01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:55.370]  Yeah.
[01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:59.370]  It's like it's like a lot of Hollywood is a Jewish business.
[01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:00.370]  Really?
[01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:01.370]  Well, they started Hollywood.
[01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:02.370]  Yeah.
[01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:03.370]  Right.
[01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:04.370]  But so was it weird?
[01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:05.370]  Just like rap.
[01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:06.370]  Black people started rap.
[01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:07.370]  Yeah.
[01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:13.370]  So I wouldn't go over there and try to get in rap and go all these black people, you know, go on Saturday Night Live like Dave Chappelle.
[01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:18.370]  I'm just saying a lot of black people are in control of rap.
[01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.370]  Right.
[01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:20.370]  Hello.
[01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:22.370]  Well, you went there.
[01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:23.370]  You try to get in show business.
[01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:24.370]  Of course, it's Jewish.
[01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:32.370]  But, you know, and people should be glad that it's Jewish, too, because if Jews were not controlling Hollywood, all you'd have was fishing shows.
[01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:33.370]  Yeah.
[01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:34.370]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:35.370]  Oh, dude.
[01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:46.370]  We have a three minute, 43 second clip that Theo Vaughn put out that he says is in real context of what she was talking about.
[01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:48.370]  We will play that clip.
[01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:50.370]  She's with us for as long as she wants to be here.
[01:14:50.370 --> 01:14:52.370]  We've got several hours of the broadcast left.
[01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:54.370]  I wish I was there in studio with her.
[01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:55.370]  I like her.
[01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:57.370]  She's a very smart lady, very lovable lady.
[01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:10.370]  And I do want to get to the bottom of what she said, because I know that, you know, she was brought up there in Utah growing up on a high rise with a bunch of Holocaust survivors.
[01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:13.370]  And, you know, I do think Hitler did kill a lot of people.
[01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:18.370]  But I think her point, unless I miss it, is they're saying you can't say these things.
[01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:20.370]  If you can't say these things, you can't say anything.
[01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:23.370]  Like I showed you the Fox News article.
[01:15:23.370 --> 01:15:25.370]  This is going to be signed by the governor.
[01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:29.370]  Five years in prison, $10,000 fine if you misgender someone.
[01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:35.370]  So this free speech is pretty, pretty darn important, especially speech I disagree with.
[01:15:35.370 --> 01:15:42.370]  But, hey, instead of me trying to guess, because I haven't talked to her other than text message, I'm really pleased to have her.
[01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:43.370]  She's in studio.
[01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:45.370]  So, Roseanne, you've got the floor here.
[01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:46.370]  We're skipping this break.
[01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:48.370]  So we're like 15 minutes to the next break.
[01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:52.370]  I played the clip of what they edited.
[01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:54.370]  I've seen the clip of what you really said.
[01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:59.370]  I got something different from what the ADL got with the out of context clip.
[01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:05.370]  Tell in your own words what you meant by what you said and what your reason for saying it was.
[01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:07.370]  And thanks for being here.
[01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:09.370]  Oh, I'm happy to be here.
[01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:10.370]  And good to see you.
[01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:11.370]  I like your head shaved.
[01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:13.370]  You look good like that.
[01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:15.370]  Oh, thank you.
[01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:18.370]  Yeah, I'm sorry I'm not seeing you live.
[01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:20.370]  But, anyway, thanks for having me.
[01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:22.370]  Well, hey, let's hang out and get dinner soon.
[01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:24.370]  Or I'm going to come out and see your ranch finally.
[01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:25.370]  I know.
[01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:26.370]  I want you to.
[01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:28.370]  I want you and your wife to come visit us.
[01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:30.370]  I'll have a couple glasses of wine.
[01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:32.370]  I had fun hanging out with you and Joe Rogan.
[01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:33.370]  Wasn't that fun?
[01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:35.370]  It's always fun at the Mothership.
[01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:37.370]  And you've been knocking it out of the park at the Mothership.
[01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:40.370]  You didn't know I was there as a fan just watching you a while back.
[01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:43.370]  So you're down performing at the Mothership quite a bit.
[01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:44.370]  Yeah, I love it.
[01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:48.370]  It's just a great place, a great audience, great place, great town.
[01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.370]  And you're here, too.
[01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:52.370]  That's why I thought, oh, hell, I'm going down there.
[01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:56.370]  Joe and Alex are down there, and I'm going, too.
[01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:57.370]  And I love it.
[01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:58.370]  Well, it's good to have you.
[01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:00.370]  Now, Roseanne, obviously they took it out of context.
[01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:02.370]  Oh, they definitely did.
[01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:07.370]  But it's just part of the whole MKUltra mind control is the way I look at it.
[01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:09.370]  And that was what I was talking about.
[01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:13.370]  The media is the enemy of the people, as we know, Alex.
[01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:19.370]  And I was speaking about that because the thing that I was making the point about
[01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:27.370]  is how the media lies to us every day and kills us, pretty much.
[01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:31.370]  They lie to us, and they have killed us.
[01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:35.370]  And I believe they stole our election, and I'll tell you why.
[01:17:35.370 --> 01:17:40.370]  I believe that it's based on anti-Semitism, the reason that they stole our election.
[01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:43.370]  But I'll go into that later at the end.
[01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:47.370]  What I said was we were not allowed to question the election
[01:17:47.370 --> 01:17:51.370]  or them telling us that Biden got 81 million votes,
[01:17:51.370 --> 01:17:55.370]  which it's just impossible that he did.
[01:17:55.370 --> 01:18:00.370]  By winning, like, 36 counties, he got more votes than Obama.
[01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:03.370]  It's just impossible, and people have done the math.
[01:18:03.370 --> 01:18:10.370]  And then we were not allowed to say, hey, people saw trucks backing up with ballots in them.
[01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:13.370]  People saw people pulling suitcases full of ballots.
[01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:19.370]  People saw people taping up the windows so that no one could see what they were doing.
[01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:23.370]  People saw votes coming in at 3 a.m. after the counts stopped.
[01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:28.370]  Everybody saw it, but yet if you questioned it or said anything about it,
[01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:32.370]  you were kicked off of all social media and made a pariah.
[01:18:32.370 --> 01:18:34.370]  That was the context I was speaking about.
[01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:39.370]  So that, of course, is the part of what I was talking about that they removed.
[01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:44.370]  And so what I was talking about was a big lie fed to America,
[01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:47.370]  not unlike the big lie fed to the German people.
[01:18:47.370 --> 01:18:55.370]  And part of that big lie continued to this day, and those same Nazis.
[01:18:55.370 --> 01:19:00.370]  You know, the New World Order, NWO, to me it means Nazi World Order
[01:19:00.370 --> 01:19:04.370]  because, you know, they brought the Nazis over here in Operation Paperclip
[01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:09.370]  to run our space program and our medical.
[01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.370]  You know all that, Alex.
[01:19:11.370 --> 01:19:14.370]  So I call it the Nazi World Order, which it in fact is.
[01:19:14.370 --> 01:19:16.370]  And you've talked about it too, Alex.
[01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:22.370]  And our deep state is in fact a Nazi World Order worldwide.
[01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:28.370]  You know, a system of slavery, murder and, you know, debt
[01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:31.370]  and all these other things that have nothing to do with freedom.
[01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:34.370]  They're anti-freedom. They're anti-free speech.
[01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:40.370]  So I was saying another big lie is to say that no Jews died in the Holocaust.
[01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:44.370]  So, you know, if you're going to tell one lie, you might as well go all the way
[01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:48.370]  because one lie, one huge big lie is the same as another.
[01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:52.370]  If you're going to swallow one and then swallow that your government tells you
[01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:58.370]  you can't question it, in a free country, in America, the United States of America,
[01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:02.370]  you cannot question your government and what it's done to you.
[01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:07.370]  And the things they did to us so that we couldn't, the things they unleashed on us,
[01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:10.370]  the number of people they put into rest homes to die
[01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:15.370]  so that we couldn't leave our homes to cast the votes that were unfairly counted,
[01:20:15.370 --> 01:20:18.370]  we're supposed to swallow that?
[01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:22.370]  We're supposed to not question that big fat lie?
[01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:27.370]  It's no different than saying no Jews died in the Holocaust.
[01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:31.370]  It's no different. It's all lies, lies, lies.
[01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:33.370]  And of course they can remove the context of it.
[01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:35.370]  This is incredible. This is incredible.
[01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:39.370]  And they're going to, and Theo Vaughn got really mad because you said this.
[01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:42.370]  You said, look, if they're allowed to steal an election and say we can't say it,
[01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:46.370]  if they're allowed to give us poison shots and put ventilators on healthy people and kill them
[01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:49.370]  and get away with that and they say nobody died there,
[01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:51.370]  then you're saying nobody died in the Holocaust.
[01:20:51.370 --> 01:20:54.370]  Not because nobody died, you're saying we're not going to sit there
[01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:58.370]  and it's just as bad to deny the Holocaust we've just seen with these shots.
[01:20:58.370 --> 01:21:01.370]  And that is so powerful. And again, they try to take that out of context.
[01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:04.370]  So in your own words, for those that don't know, that didn't see the full podcast,
[01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:06.370]  millions are seeing this right now.
[01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:10.370]  I think you're just explaining the thing, but you are saying Hitler was bad.
[01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:13.370]  Of course, I grew up in an apartment building.
[01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:15.370]  It wasn't a high rise, it was a tenement.
[01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:20.370]  But my grandparents sponsored people over from Germany who had survived.
[01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:23.370]  I grew up with people who had numbers on their arms.
[01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:29.370]  That's where I began performing in my grandmother's windowsill on Friday night for Shabbat dinners.
[01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:34.370]  And I did my fantastic Shirley Temple impressions for those people.
[01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:38.370]  And to watch them laugh and be entertained, they weren't crying, they weren't miserable.
[01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:40.370]  And that's how I started my career.
[01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:45.370]  So how dare you? How very dare you?
[01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:48.370]  And my whole life was affected by that.
[01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:51.370]  All of my family was marched.
[01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:55.370]  They lived in the Ukraine where the Ukrainian Nazis still exist.
[01:21:55.370 --> 01:22:02.370]  And the Democrat Party of Joe Biden and Obama, they want us to die, okay?
[01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:07.370]  And we're sending them money, the Ukrainian Nazis, who marched my grandmother's family,
[01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:10.370]  including ten of her siblings, little children.
[01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:14.370]  They marched them out of Albuquerque with Lithuania and buried them alive.
[01:22:15.370 --> 01:22:20.370]  So you don't need to tell me anything about the Holocaust or question me as a Holocaust denier.
[01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:25.370]  I have it in my blood, I have it in my skin, I have it in my soul, so don't even go there.
[01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:28.370]  And Jonathan Greenblatt, you should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:30.370]  You should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:22:30.370 --> 01:22:32.370]  And you support that party.
[01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:37.370]  You support the party that sends the American taxpayers' money over there to Ukrainian Nazis.
[01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:39.370]  How very dare you?
[01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:46.370]  And you know how very dare you, too, that the old, I call it the old Biden, the thieves of our government,
[01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:50.370]  that, you know, they did it to cover up what they've been up to in the Ukraine
[01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:54.370]  and other places that they've overthrown the government, including Israel.
[01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:57.370]  But I won't go into that right now.
[01:22:57.370 --> 01:23:00.370]  But anyway, I've got to take a deep breath.
[01:23:00.370 --> 01:23:01.370]  But the State Department—
[01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:03.370]  No, but you're on fire because, by the way—
[01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:04.370]  I'm on fire.
[01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:05.370]  This is what you said on Theo von.
[01:23:05.370 --> 01:23:10.370]  You said, listen, if we can't say that people were killed by the shot, there's election fraud, which are totally true.
[01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:14.370]  I'm going to tell you, though, about the election fraud, what I believe.
[01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:18.370]  Okay, but I want to say that the old Biden State Department, just a few days ago,
[01:23:18.370 --> 01:23:23.370]  they instituted BDS, which is a boycott against Jews.
[01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:27.370]  They went ahead and did that, and Jonathan Greenblatt said nothing.
[01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:31.370]  They are boycotting Jews in Israel, which is what the Nazis did.
[01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:36.370]  They started with a boycott of Jewish businesses, and not only is it Jewish businesses in Israel,
[01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:42.370]  but it's a boycott of Jewish and Christian businesses here in the United States that do business with Israel
[01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:49.370]  because a lot of Christians and Muslims, too, love Israel, and they love Jews.
[01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:50.370]  Hello.
[01:23:50.370 --> 01:23:56.370]  And so they're boycotting them for doing business with people of Abrahamic background.
[01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:58.370]  So what is that, Jonathan Greenblatt?
[01:23:58.370 --> 01:24:00.370]  You said nothing about that.
[01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:04.370]  Why haven't any of you Jewish people on the left said anything about that?
[01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:06.370]  And don't get me started on the left.
[01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:13.370]  Don't get me started on the Jewish people of the left, because I'll bring the Bible into it and blow your damn mind.
[01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:19.370]  But I think that that was why they stole the election, because these people, they are just satanic.
[01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:21.370]  They are devilish.
[01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:22.370]  They are like from pain.
[01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:28.370]  When you say anti-Semitic, Roseanne, the ADL calls sweet Tucker Carlson anti-Semitic.
[01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:29.370]  They're trying to bring us together.
[01:24:29.370 --> 01:24:33.370]  They call President Trump, who has Jewish grandchildren.
[01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:35.370]  Absolutely, and Jewish children.
[01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:41.370]  They call him an anti-Semite, and you're explaining this election was about anti-Semitism.
[01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:42.370]  Explain that.
[01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:47.370]  Because they want to destroy the only Jewish state that exists in the world.
[01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:50.370]  That's what Satan wants.
[01:24:50.370 --> 01:24:52.370]  That's what the devil wants.
[01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:54.370]  He wants to destroy the Bible.
[01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:56.370]  He wants to destroy our God.
[01:24:56.370 --> 01:25:01.370]  He wants to destroy Christianity and like Sunni Islam.
[01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:04.370]  He wants to destroy anybody who's Abrahamic.
[01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:08.370]  He wants to destroy anybody of faith who believes.
[01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:19.370]  It's just amazing, because today's Bible reading is about how to turn curses into blessings, which is great that I'm here today to talk about that.
[01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:25.370]  But also, you know, Cain, these people, they come from Cain, and it is a religion.
[01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:34.370]  They're Cainites, and if you read the Bible, and the Bible is, to me, it's about a spiritual war.
[01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:40.370]  A spiritual war that exists in spiritual time and space, and also on this planet right now.
[01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:47.370]  It's good versus evil, but these people, Cain killed Abel, and it says in the Bible that he drank his blood.
[01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:53.370]  So that is the war we're fighting right now against people who sacrifice other people and drink their blood.
[01:25:53.370 --> 01:25:55.370]  Am I right, Alex?
[01:25:55.370 --> 01:26:02.370]  You're 100 percent right, and we're going to go to break in about three minutes, but I want you to clarify, because I know that you're a Jewish lady.
[01:26:02.370 --> 01:26:09.370]  I mean you love God, and you absolutely hate the evil, the globalists, and you were making a point, and you made this point you're making here.
[01:26:09.370 --> 01:26:16.370]  They'll probably edit this and say she went on again and denied the Holocaust with what you said was if we're going to deny all these other crimes,
[01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:22.370]  then I'm going to deny this one to get the attention that we're denying serious crimes against humanity.
[01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:28.370]  This poison shot is a Holocaust against our medical rights, a Holocaust against our medical freedom, and a Holocaust of our immune system,
[01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:36.370]  and it's killed so many people, and that's a great point that denying all these other things is just as bad as denying that Hitler was a madman
[01:26:36.370 --> 01:26:41.370]  that admitted he had a final solution and tried to kill any Jews he could get his hands on.
[01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:47.370]  I want to go into what Holocaust means, because it comes from a Hebrew word which means sacrifice,
[01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:55.370]  and I do want to go into it, Alex, because that is exactly what it was by Nazi Satanists.
[01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:58.370]  Well, let's do that. We're going to break. That'll take some time.
[01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:03.370]  Yes, I'm writing a note. We're going to do that, but just to clarify, you believe the Holocaust happened?
[01:27:03.370 --> 01:27:07.370]  If you're going to push one lie, what keeps you from pushing another one?
[01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:13.370]  This government pushed a million lies on us and expected us to swallow it, so what's the next one?
[01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:24.370]  It could very well be because they don't like Israel, and they don't like Jews, and they don't like Christians, and they don't like Sunni Muslims.
[01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:34.370]  That's why Saudi Arabia told us to get lost. They are on a holy war against us, and what's the next lie?
[01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:42.370]  I think that the next lie is, and you can read it all over in comments all over the place, that people do deny the Holocaust in this country,
[01:27:42.370 --> 01:27:50.370]  and it's on media everywhere, and they aren't censoring that. It's everywhere.
[01:27:50.370 --> 01:27:56.370]  Sure, but I just want to quantify exactly. I get 95% of what you're saying, but I want to get it very clear so they can't twist this.
[01:27:56.370 --> 01:27:57.370]  When we come back, think about it.
[01:27:57.370 --> 01:28:00.370]  One big lie is just like the other.
[01:28:00.370 --> 01:28:05.370]  Absolutely, and so you're illustrating that by making that point.
[01:28:05.370 --> 01:28:10.370]  All right, we're going to go to break. Roseanne Barr is in studio. I'm about to be back in Texas.
[01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:15.370]  We're up here because my wife's dad is in the hospital. What is the best website for people to visit, Roseanne?
[01:28:15.370 --> 01:28:24.370]  Uh-oh, I had it written down. Well, my website is, I'm on YouTube for now at roseanneworld.com.
[01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:27.370]  That's where my videos are, and I'm doing a podcast. You know that.
[01:28:27.370 --> 01:28:33.370]  I just started a podcast. Every time I rear my head, my bloodied head, that they're trying to shut me up,
[01:28:33.370 --> 01:28:38.370]  I guess because I dare say something about the Obama administration's corruption.
[01:28:38.370 --> 01:28:45.370]  You're not allowed to say that either, but because I have, they're just trying to bury me alive like they did my family.
[01:28:45.370 --> 01:28:49.370]  But, you know, I'm going to keep coming back, Alex, as long as God brings me.
[01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:54.370]  Powerful. Stay right there. We're back in four minutes, Roseanne. Stay with us.

[01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:34.370]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:37.370]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated. People are listening more than ever.
[01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:42.370]  But in this major recession, going into depression, and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.

[01:29:45.370 --> 01:29:48.370]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[01:29:48.370 --> 01:29:52.370]  That you can do for free, and that's just as important as keeping us on air.

[01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:55.370]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, and the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[01:31:57.370 --> 01:32:04.370]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:07.370]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:12.370]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers,
[01:32:12.370 --> 01:32:18.370]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:24.370]  Now, these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:32:24.370 --> 01:32:29.370]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[01:32:29.370 --> 01:32:32.370]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:39.370]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated, industrial waste product
[01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:41.370]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:32:41.370 --> 01:32:46.370]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:52.370]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:56.370]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:59.370 --> 01:33:05.370]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:14.290]  Defending the Republic from Enemies Foreign and Domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.290 --> 01:33:23.290]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Roseanne Barr is in studio.
[01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:25.290]  I wish I could be there in Austin, Texas. I'll be back Sunday.
[01:33:25.290 --> 01:33:31.290]  I really appreciate her coming in. Legendary comedian, mother, grandmother, patriot.
[01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:36.290]  And I know that she's extremely pro-Israel, pro-Jewish.
[01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:39.290]  You know, literally brought up by Holocaust survivors.
[01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:41.290]  We know Hitler did have a final solution.
[01:33:41.290 --> 01:33:44.290]  He wrote articles and books and speeches about it.
[01:33:44.290 --> 01:33:46.290]  They didn't round up Jews and a bunch of other groups and kill them.
[01:33:46.290 --> 01:33:51.290]  Polls, you know, a few years ago, the polls pointed out that at least 7 million polls got killed.
[01:33:51.290 --> 01:33:54.290]  And then the ADL said, well, don't bring up how you got killed.
[01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:57.290]  We're more important. And what Roseanne's saying is everybody's important.
[01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:01.290]  I'm not putting words in her mouth, but when I got from the full Theo Vaughn interview,
[01:34:01.290 --> 01:34:04.290]  because I went and watched it when I saw the clips five or six days ago,
[01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:09.290]  you know, Roseanne says 6 million Jews should die now, no Jews died.
[01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:11.290]  I said, that's got to be out of context.
[01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:13.290]  I saw the clip, it's all jump cut edits.
[01:34:13.290 --> 01:34:16.290]  I went and watched the full show, and she was like, this is an evil government.
[01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:19.290]  They lie to us about the death shots, the elections, can't believe anything.
[01:34:19.290 --> 01:34:22.290]  So why don't I just say no Jews died and more Jews should die?
[01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:24.290]  Why don't I just say no Jews died and more Jews should die?
[01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:29.290]  She's trying to get attention to the current mass murder and sacrifice, the Holocaust,
[01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:31.290]  going on now in my view.
[01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:34.290]  But I don't want to put words in your mouth. This is a historic interview.
[01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:36.290]  They're going to try to twist it, Roseanne, so please humor me.
[01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:39.290]  Go through exactly what you were thinking on Theo Vaughn,
[01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:41.290]  what you meant by what you said so they can't twist it,
[01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:44.290]  and let's get into what sacrifice Holocaust means.
[01:34:44.290 --> 01:34:47.290]  Let's get into all the points you want.
[01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:49.290]  I'm going to skip the next break. I'm going to shut up.
[01:34:49.290 --> 01:34:53.290]  Don't pause. I'm going to sit back and let you talk. Go ahead.
[01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:59.290]  Well, yeah, I was trying to make the point about in the home of freedom of speech
[01:34:59.290 --> 01:35:04.290]  and individual rights and every wonderful God-given thing that this republic,
[01:35:04.290 --> 01:35:07.290]  this constitutional republic afforded us.
[01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:09.290]  You know, my grandmother sailed over here.
[01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:13.290]  It took her three months when she was 16, 15, 16 years old.
[01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:18.290]  She came to this country, and she and her two sisters came here as teenagers,
[01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:22.290]  and they're the only ones of our whole family that survived the Holocaust.
[01:35:22.290 --> 01:35:26.290]  And it's in her memory that I speak out.
[01:35:26.290 --> 01:35:31.290]  And it's in her memory because she was a fighter, and she was a republican too,
[01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:33.290]  which was unheard of in my family.
[01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:41.290]  But it's in her memory that I speak out because without this country,
[01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:43.290]  I wouldn't be alive either.
[01:35:44.290 --> 01:35:46.290]  And so I love this country, first of all.
[01:35:46.290 --> 01:35:49.290]  I love this country most of all.
[01:35:49.290 --> 01:35:53.290]  And, you know, I'm an American, and I'm an American Jew.
[01:35:53.290 --> 01:35:57.290]  And that means a lot to me.
[01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:59.290]  It means everything.
[01:35:59.290 --> 01:36:06.290]  But, you know, I just, I will not be silent.
[01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:10.290]  I will not go silently when my fellow citizens,
[01:36:10.290 --> 01:36:15.290]  I will not be silent as they try to put my fellow citizens on trains.
[01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:17.290]  I won't go silently.
[01:36:17.290 --> 01:36:21.290]  I will not be silent when they try to, you know,
[01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:27.290]  jail my fellow citizens with no charges on bogus January 6th.
[01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:29.290]  I won't be silent.
[01:36:29.290 --> 01:36:34.290]  I can't be silent because of my family killed in the Holocaust by Hitler.
[01:36:34.290 --> 01:36:39.290]  I cannot and I will not go silently, nor will I be silent.
[01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:43.290]  And if I have to just go individually door-to-door,
[01:36:43.290 --> 01:36:47.290]  hit everybody in the head with a hammer to try to wake them up,
[01:36:47.290 --> 01:36:52.290]  to let some light in those encased skulls that MKUltra has done
[01:36:52.290 --> 01:36:56.290]  to the American people for the last 40 years, I'm ready to do it.
[01:36:56.290 --> 01:37:02.290]  I'll do anything that I can do to awaken the American people
[01:37:02.290 --> 01:37:04.290]  as to what is happening to them.
[01:37:04.290 --> 01:37:08.290]  That's why I ran for president in 2012 when I saw,
[01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:11.290]  I've seen it my whole life.
[01:37:11.290 --> 01:37:16.290]  My whole life I've seen where it's going because I saw where it came from.
[01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:19.290]  I saw when I was 3 years old those people.
[01:37:19.290 --> 01:37:24.290]  I saw them come to America and flourish and come back from the dead.
[01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:28.290]  I love this country because it's the only country
[01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:31.290]  that gives people rights over government,
[01:37:31.290 --> 01:37:34.290]  and people better wake up and realize that and take it back.
[01:37:34.290 --> 01:37:38.290]  You can't just sit there and expect because your leaders look like you
[01:37:38.290 --> 01:37:39.290]  that they're on your side.
[01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:41.290]  Well, they're not.
[01:37:41.290 --> 01:37:43.290]  They're not.
[01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:45.290]  They don't care about you.
[01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:48.290]  Like George Carlin said, they're in a big club and we ain't in it.
[01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:51.290]  We're prey.
[01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:53.290]  Our children are prey.
[01:37:53.290 --> 01:37:55.290]  We have to wake up.
[01:37:55.290 --> 01:37:57.290]  We have to take our power back.
[01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:59.290]  We do.
[01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:00.290]  We have to turn to each other.
[01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:03.290]  That's all we have is our faith in God and our faith in each other.
[01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:04.290]  And truth.
[01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:06.290]  That's all we have is truth.
[01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:08.290]  And I was trying to make a point.
[01:38:08.290 --> 01:38:10.290]  You can't live under a lie.
[01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:14.290]  You can't live with lies and say nothing and not question them
[01:38:14.290 --> 01:38:15.290]  because look where it leads.
[01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:17.290]  It leads to a holocaust.
[01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:20.290]  Every time lies lead to a holocaust.
[01:38:20.290 --> 01:38:24.290]  That's what I'm trying to say, and how dare they twist it.
[01:38:24.290 --> 01:38:28.290]  And you know what is so sad to me is that it's always, you know,
[01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:34.290]  it is primarily Jewish liberal people on the left who always come after me
[01:38:34.290 --> 01:38:36.290]  because I'm such a threat to them.
[01:38:36.290 --> 01:38:40.290]  And like Jews like me are such a threat to them in Israel too.
[01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:42.290]  That's what's happening in Israel.
[01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:46.290]  You know why Obama goes over there and pours all his money and all, you know,
[01:38:46.290 --> 01:38:49.290]  uses his charisma against the Jewish people in Israel.
[01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:52.290]  He gets all those leftists over there.
[01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:54.290]  They have judicial fiat like we had,
[01:38:54.290 --> 01:39:00.290]  and people in this country are celebrating judicial fiat when they overturned Roe v. Wade.
[01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:04.290]  That was a blow against the empire, and they don't even know it.
[01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:08.290]  They're like, oh, you know, that was against judicial fiat,
[01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:12.290]  which means that a group of elitists from, you know,
[01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:16.290]  leftward universities who care nothing about national sovereignty
[01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:19.290]  or human rights in any way.
[01:39:19.290 --> 01:39:20.290]  You can see it now.
[01:39:20.290 --> 01:39:23.290]  It's becoming clearer to people, I hope.
[01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:26.290]  But they make the laws that everybody lives under,
[01:39:26.290 --> 01:39:28.290]  but that's not the kind of republic we live in.
[01:39:28.290 --> 01:39:35.290]  It's up by and for the people for each community to decide the standards under which they live.
[01:39:35.290 --> 01:39:37.290]  For God's sake, that's what we're here for.
[01:39:37.290 --> 01:39:44.290]  But when a group of six or eight largely men decide for every woman in this country what the laws are
[01:39:44.290 --> 01:39:48.290]  and for every taxpayer where their tax money will go,
[01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:52.290]  even if they're opposed morally to where that money goes, they have to do it.
[01:39:52.290 --> 01:39:53.290]  That isn't freedom.
[01:39:53.290 --> 01:39:58.290]  And that was overturned, and that was a great blow for civil rights,
[01:39:58.290 --> 01:40:02.290]  and people don't even know it because they're so completely brainwashed.
[01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:05.290]  They're so completely stupid.
[01:40:05.290 --> 01:40:10.290]  And the left in this country has weaponized stupidity and mental illness,
[01:40:10.290 --> 01:40:14.290]  and they're using that just like Hitler did for his street gangs.
[01:40:14.290 --> 01:40:16.290]  And that is the truth.
[01:40:16.290 --> 01:40:17.290]  They're the brown shirts.
[01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:20.290]  And I just want people to wake up.
[01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:22.290]  I don't want to go that way.
[01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:25.290]  I don't want my grandkids going that way.
[01:40:25.290 --> 01:40:27.290]  I don't want your grandkids going that way.
[01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:31.290]  I don't even care if you're an atheist or an agnostic or anything else.
[01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:33.290]  I don't want no kids going that way.
[01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:35.290]  Look what they're doing to kids.
[01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:36.290]  Oh, my God.
[01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:38.290]  Talk about Nazis.
[01:40:38.290 --> 01:40:41.290]  They're sterilizing children without their parents' approval.
[01:40:41.290 --> 01:40:43.290]  That's what it is.
[01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:46.290]  They're brainwashing them into thinking that they are going to be helped
[01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:49.290]  by being sexually mutilated and sterilized.
[01:40:49.290 --> 01:40:51.290]  What are you talking about, people?
[01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:53.290]  I can't stand it.
[01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.290]  I'm a grandmother.
[01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:56.290]  I'm not going to go silently.
[01:40:56.290 --> 01:40:57.290]  I'm not going to shut up.
[01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:59.290]  You're not going to call me stupid.
[01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:00.290]  I'm smarter.
[01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:05.290]  Like I said in my movie at the end of my Roseanne for President movie
[01:41:05.290 --> 01:41:06.290]  to these same people,
[01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:10.290]  I have more brains in my shit than you've got in your whole damn family.
[01:41:10.290 --> 01:41:12.290]  You don't call me stupid.
[01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:14.290]  You don't call me an anti-Semite.
[01:41:14.290 --> 01:41:16.290]  You hate God.
[01:41:16.290 --> 01:41:18.290]  You hate the Jewish people.
[01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:20.290]  You hate the only Jewish state on earth.
[01:41:20.290 --> 01:41:23.290]  Why don't you go over there to some of these other countries and talk about
[01:41:23.290 --> 01:41:24.290]  what they do?
[01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:28.290]  Israel has completely integrated you liars.
[01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:29.290]  I'm sick of you.
[01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:32.290]  I'm sick that you call yourselves Jews and you're not.
[01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:34.290]  You're Sabbatean Frankis.
[01:41:34.290 --> 01:41:36.290]  You're goat worshiping.
[01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:37.290]  You're goat worshipers.
[01:41:37.290 --> 01:41:44.290]  You know, Alex, the Sabbatean Frankis, the Jewish people way,
[01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:46.290]  way back in the day,
[01:41:46.290 --> 01:41:50.290]  they used to cast all their sins onto a scapegoat.
[01:41:50.290 --> 01:41:53.290]  That's where the whole scapegoat thing came from.
[01:41:53.290 --> 01:41:57.290]  And the scapegoat would run, and it would run off a cliff,
[01:41:57.290 --> 01:41:59.290]  and then they'd, you know, this was primitive times,
[01:41:59.290 --> 01:42:01.290]  and it wasn't just Jewish people that did it.
[01:42:01.290 --> 01:42:04.290]  It was, you know, old Canaanite stuff.
[01:42:04.290 --> 01:42:07.290]  But, you know, that's how they would, like, repent
[01:42:07.290 --> 01:42:11.290]  or free themselves of their sins or, you know, that was their mentality.
[01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:16.290]  Well, the Sabbatean Frankis, they thought there's two ways to bring,
[01:42:16.290 --> 01:42:21.290]  you know, they called it, you know, messianic,
[01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:28.290]  what do you call it, spirituality, like a great utopian thing.
[01:42:28.290 --> 01:42:31.290]  There's either to do it the way God wants you to.
[01:42:31.290 --> 01:42:34.290]  You've got to bring the Messiah there to do a certain thing.
[01:42:34.290 --> 01:42:37.290]  They thought, well, there's bring it the way God wants you to,
[01:42:37.290 --> 01:42:40.290]  which they thought, well, that'll never happen.
[01:42:40.290 --> 01:42:43.290]  Or there's doing it the way evil wants you to do it,
[01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:46.290]  and they thought, well, that'll be easier, and that's what they do,
[01:42:46.290 --> 01:42:48.290]  and that's what they still do.
[01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:53.290]  That's why they worship a goat and an owl,
[01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:57.290]  because they think, well, through evil, we're going to bring utopia,
[01:42:57.290 --> 01:43:00.290]  because they can't do it the right way,
[01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:02.290]  and they don't want to do it the right way,
[01:43:02.290 --> 01:43:06.290]  and they sink lower and lower and lower into degradation,
[01:43:07.290 --> 01:43:11.290]  so low that it's going to blow people's minds
[01:43:11.290 --> 01:43:16.290]  when they find out how evil they are, and they are so evil.
[01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:19.290]  I mean, I said that the devil has turned in his resignation
[01:43:19.290 --> 01:43:21.290]  when he saw what these people do, and he's like,
[01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:25.290]  I'm out of the devil business once I see what these people are up to,
[01:43:25.290 --> 01:43:28.290]  and I think that it's going to be exposed.
[01:43:28.290 --> 01:43:30.290]  Don't you, Alex?
[01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:32.290]  Absolutely, and since you mentioned it,
[01:43:32.290 --> 01:43:38.290]  take Bohemian Grove that is a mixture of ancient Canaanite, Babylonian,
[01:43:38.290 --> 01:43:44.290]  but also Druidic and Germanic and even Faustian and medieval black magic,
[01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:48.290]  because I had mainline scholars, professors that weren't even religious
[01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:50.290]  say that that's what this is.
[01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:52.290]  They looked at the ritual, and it goes on for like an hour and a half,
[01:43:52.290 --> 01:43:55.290]  and they invoke all this, and they have an effigy of a child,
[01:43:55.290 --> 01:43:58.290]  like a scapegoat that they put all their sins on,
[01:43:58.290 --> 01:44:01.290]  then they burn it, and then they're safe for a year.
[01:44:01.290 --> 01:44:08.290]  So they're literally doing these rituals and believing that it's going to protect them,
[01:44:08.290 --> 01:44:10.290]  and so it just keeps going back to this.
[01:44:10.290 --> 01:44:15.290]  Why don't they just ask God to heal them and repent?
[01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:18.290]  But again, they just do these weird rituals.
[01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:21.290]  Well, you know why they do those rituals on kids is because
[01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:24.290]  that's how they control a perfect mind slave,
[01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:29.290]  because they create different compartments in the kids' minds.
[01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:31.290]  They shatter the kids' personality in their minds,
[01:44:31.290 --> 01:44:38.290]  so they create a perfect assassin and a perfect street gang brown shirt Nazi
[01:44:38.290 --> 01:44:44.290]  that can go and gas a bunch of people and then go home and have dinner with their family.
[01:44:44.290 --> 01:44:45.290]  That's what they do.
[01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:50.290]  They torture children so that they can become assassins, murderers, and continue.
[01:44:50.290 --> 01:44:51.290]  By the way, that was declassified.
[01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:56.290]  That's MKUltra was torturing children to create mind slaves,
[01:44:56.290 --> 01:45:01.290]  and even Robert Kennedy Jr. just tweeted a big article here, Mainstream News,
[01:45:01.290 --> 01:45:06.290]  New Docs Links CIA to Medical Torture on Indigenous Children and Black Prisoners.
[01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:09.290]  Why doesn't the ADL talk about that?
[01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:14.290]  Why don't they talk about George Soros saying the best time of his life was rounding up Jews in Eastern Europe,
[01:45:14.290 --> 01:45:18.290]  how he was proud to do it, and how it was invigorating?
[01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:22.290]  Well, you know, he threatened to sue me, Alex, and I had to, oh, my God.
[01:45:22.290 --> 01:45:29.290]  When I did my tweet and talked about him, too, being part of it, you know, he threatened to sue me.
[01:45:29.290 --> 01:45:36.290]  So I had to say, you know, I do apologize to the slave, 14-year-old slave George Soros,
[01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:40.290]  who had no choice in what he did, but it's what he did after that's, you know,
[01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:47.290]  equally as bad when he collapsed currencies all over the world and made people starve and die in, you know, a living hell.
[01:45:47.290 --> 01:45:49.290]  He does it all over the world, and he's proud of it.
[01:45:49.290 --> 01:45:52.290]  He's proud of it, gets richer and richer.
[01:45:52.290 --> 01:45:56.290]  But people never will really tell the truth.
[01:45:56.290 --> 01:46:01.290]  I don't think they're allowed to tell the truth, but I feel like God pushes me, and he's, you've got to do it, Roseanne.
[01:46:01.290 --> 01:46:03.290]  I'm like, do I have to?
[01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:05.290]  It never works out for me.
[01:46:05.290 --> 01:46:08.290]  Why don't you get somebody that people, you know, listen to?
[01:46:08.290 --> 01:46:09.290]  He's like, no, it has to be you.
[01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:10.290]  You have to do it.
[01:46:10.290 --> 01:46:12.290]  That's what's inside of me.
[01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:13.290]  I have to do it.
[01:46:13.290 --> 01:46:15.290]  I got like Tourette's or something.
[01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:16.290]  I can't be silent.
[01:46:16.290 --> 01:46:21.290]  But I went and watched the full interview with you and Theo Vaughn, and you said all this in context.
[01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:22.290]  So watch, folks.
[01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:28.290]  When they take this interview that you're watching live or tape later and they edit it and you hear, Roseanne Barr doubles down, says Holocaust didn't happen.
[01:46:28.290 --> 01:46:30.290]  That's not what she said.
[01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:31.290]  She comes from Holocaust survivors.
[01:46:31.290 --> 01:46:35.290]  She was saying we're going to deny the shots are killing people and deny there's election fraud.
[01:46:35.290 --> 01:46:36.290]  Well, let's just deny this.
[01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:37.290]  See how you like that.
[01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:39.290]  No, it's all wrong to deny crimes.
[01:46:40.290 --> 01:46:50.290]  It's wrong to deny the murder of a million and a half people by the young Turks in Turkey just because they were Christian, the Armenian genocide.
[01:46:50.290 --> 01:46:52.290]  It's wrong to deny these crimes.
[01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:54.290]  Now, I got a lot of questions.
[01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:55.290]  I want to go to the next hour with you.
[01:46:55.290 --> 01:47:00.290]  If you need to take a break or so, we'll take five minutes at the start of the next hour here in about 10 minutes.
[01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:03.290]  But, Roseanne, just all the other big issues.
[01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:08.290]  What do you make of mainline top comedians coming out and saying, okay, the shot is poison?
[01:47:08.290 --> 01:47:10.290]  Okay, we got lied to.
[01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:17.290]  What do you make of RF Kennedy, Jr., you know, just coming out and sounding like you and myself and so many others?
[01:47:17.290 --> 01:47:21.290]  I mean, I think there is a great awakening happening right now.
[01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:24.290]  And before I get your take on that, I want to play this clip.
[01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:25.290]  It's only 50 seconds.
[01:47:25.290 --> 01:47:26.290]  This is clip 14.
[01:47:26.290 --> 01:47:31.290]  Legendary comedians Dane Carby and David Spade destroy Dr. Fauci.
[01:47:31.290 --> 01:47:34.290]  I mean, it seems to me like we're really starting to go over the top here.
[01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:36.290]  Tell me if I'm wrong, but let's go to this clip.
[01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:38.290]  I miss COVID.
[01:47:38.290 --> 01:47:39.290]  I know.
[01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:41.290]  Dude, you know what I knew?
[01:47:41.290 --> 01:47:45.290]  There was trouble when anyone that came to our country didn't have to get a vaccine.
[01:47:45.290 --> 01:47:51.290]  If you're telling me I can't go to work, but everyone coming in doesn't have to get one, I go.
[01:47:51.290 --> 01:47:55.290]  Well, once we found out when Fauci said, okay, I'm sorry.
[01:47:55.290 --> 01:48:04.290]  If you've had two boosters and two vaccines, you can get and give COVID to another guy who's had five vaccines and four boosters.
[01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:05.290]  What's the difference between a vaccine and a booster?
[01:48:05.290 --> 01:48:06.290]  I don't know.
[01:48:06.290 --> 01:48:07.290]  Just more vaccine.
[01:48:07.290 --> 01:48:09.290]  But booster sounds better.
[01:48:09.290 --> 01:48:16.290]  Anyway, a guy with 25 vaccines would get and give COVID to another guy with 25 vaccines.
[01:48:16.290 --> 01:48:19.290]  That's why I'm introducing the daily COVID shot.
[01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:21.290]  Every day you get a shot.
[01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:24.290]  By the time you get to your car, you got no immunity.
[01:48:24.290 --> 01:48:26.290]  But it's a beautiful 39 seconds.
[01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:33.290]  But it's killed so many people in a race for immune system.
[01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:35.290]  So what is the moment we're at, Roseanne, right now?
[01:48:35.290 --> 01:48:36.290]  Are we winning?
[01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:37.290]  Are we losing?
[01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:38.290]  What do you think?
[01:48:38.290 --> 01:48:44.290]  Well, I just want to say to those two comics, hey, you know, better late than never, guys, and I'm glad you joined up.
[01:48:44.290 --> 01:48:49.290]  You know, I wish you would have defended me five years ago when I stood there alone.
[01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:59.290]  And, you know, for the ones that did Owen Benjamin, a lot of other comics, Monique, a lot of really people with soul and heart.
[01:48:59.290 --> 01:49:01.290]  Thank you.
[01:49:01.290 --> 01:49:03.290]  You too, Alex.
[01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:06.290]  But, you know, I've always been a fighter.
[01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:09.290]  I'm never going to give up, you know, till God takes me off this planet.
[01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:12.290]  I'm an old bitch and I won't never stop being an old bitch.
[01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:16.290]  I think comedy is going to save the world, as I always was thinking.
[01:49:16.290 --> 01:49:23.290]  You know, when I was a little girl and I used to entertain those Holocaust survivors, we said Shoah.
[01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:33.290]  But I just loved making people laugh because I saw they were thinking because their eyes were moving, you know.
[01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:35.290]  And they were looking up and down and thinking.
[01:49:35.290 --> 01:49:38.290]  And I loved being able to bring that forth.
[01:49:38.290 --> 01:49:41.290]  And I always was reading the Bible and, you know, Torah, too.
[01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:45.290]  That was my hobby, them and medical books, looking for my diseases.
[01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:58.290]  But when I read Psalms 2, it was really deep to me because in Psalms 2, it says that God sits on his throne in heaven and he laughs at the hubris of humans.
[01:49:58.290 --> 01:50:05.290]  And so all my jokes and everything, including the one you saw me, including the thing I did, which was satire.
[01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:08.290]  But you have to have a half a brain to understand satire.
[01:50:09.290 --> 01:50:11.290]  That I did on Theo Vont, all my jokes.
[01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:16.290]  I write for God to make God laugh because God's a great comedian and he gets my jokes.
[01:50:16.290 --> 01:50:19.290]  And I don't care if the idiots don't.
[01:50:19.290 --> 01:50:22.290]  So, of course, there was a Holocaust, you idiots.
[01:50:22.290 --> 01:50:23.290]  I lived through it.
[01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:27.290]  When I was three years old, they made me watch the Eichmann trials.
[01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:33.290]  That's why I got multiple personalities from watching that, from hearing their stories that they would tell.
[01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:37.290]  And they would point to me and say, little girls like her, they hung them on meat hooks.
[01:50:37.290 --> 01:50:39.290]  How do you think a three-year-old handles that?
[01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:42.290]  So don't you call me any Holocaust denier.
[01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:44.290]  I deny nothing.
[01:50:44.290 --> 01:50:49.290]  I don't deny that Stalin killed almost as many, if not more Jews.
[01:50:49.290 --> 01:50:54.290]  I don't deny that Mao, your idol, he killed, what, 50 million Chinese.
[01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:57.290]  You guys love to kill people.
[01:50:57.290 --> 01:51:01.290]  You're all salivating that you're going to get some Russians, too.
[01:51:01.290 --> 01:51:05.290]  You're going to use your Ukrainian money to kill more Russians.
[01:51:05.290 --> 01:51:12.290]  Now, let's talk about that because five years ago, PBS, CNN said Ukraine's Nazi problem.
[01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:16.290]  Because for those that don't know, you had a family that escaped Hitler during World War II.
[01:51:16.290 --> 01:51:17.290]  The West was Nazi.
[01:51:17.290 --> 01:51:18.290]  The East was Soviet.
[01:51:18.290 --> 01:51:19.290]  Well, they killed them in Ukraine, Alex.
[01:51:19.290 --> 01:51:20.290]  They killed them.
[01:51:20.290 --> 01:51:23.290]  The Ukrainians that we're supporting, they killed my family.
[01:51:23.290 --> 01:51:28.290]  They buried them alive after they poisoned my grandmother's 12-year-old twin brothers.
[01:51:28.290 --> 01:51:32.290]  Her mom went to the pharmacy because they were sick to get medicine.
[01:51:32.290 --> 01:51:36.290]  They gave her cyanide for her twins, 12-year-olds.
[01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:41.290]  That's what—in fact, when Hitler first got in in 1933, they didn't round people up for five, six years.
[01:51:41.290 --> 01:51:44.290]  At first, they would just poison you at the doctor's office.
[01:51:44.290 --> 01:51:45.290]  That is—
[01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:49.290]  Classic United States COVID shit.
[01:51:49.290 --> 01:51:56.290]  First, they get the professors in the universities, as the Nazis did.
[01:51:56.290 --> 01:51:58.290]  Let's just go from Germany.
[01:51:58.290 --> 01:52:03.290]  First, they get their fake science professors, which, you know, check.
[01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:07.290]  And then they get their religious pulpits, check.
[01:52:07.290 --> 01:52:13.290]  And then they get their doctors and their scientists, fake—I call it mon-satan science, check.
[01:52:13.290 --> 01:52:16.290]  And then they get the doctors, check.
[01:52:16.290 --> 01:52:17.290]  We got it all.
[01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:23.290]  You know, start looking for them trains, America.
[01:52:23.290 --> 01:52:25.290]  Well, Roseanne, you're on fire more than ever.
[01:52:25.290 --> 01:52:26.290]  You're always on fire.
[01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:29.290]  But let's just go back to this.
[01:52:29.290 --> 01:52:32.290]  They even came out in the New York Times.
[01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:34.290]  Hitler stole that election, too.
[01:52:34.290 --> 01:52:35.290]  I forgot to say this.
[01:52:35.290 --> 01:52:37.290]  You know, Hitler didn't really win.
[01:52:37.290 --> 01:52:40.290]  He stole that election, too.
[01:52:40.290 --> 01:52:44.290]  The German people never elected him fairly.
[01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:45.290]  Well, you're right.
[01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:49.290]  He barely won the presidency, and people think there was a lot of fraud.
[01:52:49.290 --> 01:52:52.290]  And then he convinced von Hindenburg as chancellor to step down,
[01:52:52.290 --> 01:52:57.290]  and then he unified the presidency that's the lower house and the chancellery that's the upper—
[01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:59.290]  Using the Workers' Party socialists.
[01:52:59.290 --> 01:53:01.290]  Yeah, into the dictatorship.
[01:53:01.290 --> 01:53:02.290]  Exactly.
[01:53:02.290 --> 01:53:06.290]  So what I'm saying is the New York Times came out two weeks ago or three weeks ago and said,
[01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:09.290]  yes, a lot of the Ukrainian troops are Nazis.
[01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:11.290]  Yes, they have swastika tattoos.
[01:53:11.290 --> 01:53:12.290]  Yes, they haul Hitler.
[01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:13.290]  But they're good people.
[01:53:13.290 --> 01:53:19.290]  So we literally have our media saying real Nazis are good, but then Roseanne Barr is a Nazi.
[01:53:19.290 --> 01:53:22.290]  I mean, it doesn't float.
[01:53:22.290 --> 01:53:23.290]  People aren't buying it.
[01:53:23.290 --> 01:53:24.290]  So what about my question?
[01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:25.290]  Is there a Great Awakening?
[01:53:25.290 --> 01:53:31.290]  It's a unified field of bullshit, and it's backward day every single day, Alex.
[01:53:31.290 --> 01:53:32.290]  That's how the devil likes it.
[01:53:32.290 --> 01:53:35.290]  The devil is a trickster, and he loves to fool with us.
[01:53:35.290 --> 01:53:40.290]  He loves to get us thinking good is bad and bad is good, period.
[01:53:40.290 --> 01:53:43.290]  Remember, they put snake venom in that shit.
[01:53:43.290 --> 01:53:45.290]  That's what COVID is.
[01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:46.290]  It's snake venom.
[01:53:46.290 --> 01:53:47.290]  Think about that.
[01:53:47.290 --> 01:53:50.290]  The snake, the Garden of Eden, snake, snake, snake.
[01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:52.290]  Think about it.
[01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:57.290]  It's the HIV delivery system.
[01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:58.290]  You cannot make this up.
[01:53:58.290 --> 01:54:02.290]  To me, it's so crazy because they don't even censor the videos on Twitter.
[01:54:02.290 --> 01:54:09.290]  There will be a video with 5 million views that the Ukrainian military puts out where they're doing blood and soil rituals where they cut their arms,
[01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:16.290]  jump in a grave, bleed in it, hail Zelensky, and they're hailing Hitler to a Jewish guy, Zelensky.
[01:54:17.290 --> 01:54:18.290]  Like you said, it's the devil.
[01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:21.290]  It's total trickster stuff, just totally bizarre, insane.
[01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:24.290]  Here's what one of my rabbi friends said, though.
[01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:26.290]  You know what they told me on YouTube?
[01:54:26.290 --> 01:54:31.290]  Well, if you want to get monetized, Roseanne, because I'm trying to get a job.
[01:54:31.290 --> 01:54:37.290]  Like I told somebody, I said, I support a large family of lazy Jews.
[01:54:37.290 --> 01:54:39.290]  They fired me off all my jobs.
[01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:42.290]  I'm trying to podcast because I have a lot to say.
[01:54:42.290 --> 01:54:44.290]  It isn't that I'm doing it just for money.
[01:54:44.290 --> 01:54:45.290]  I'm like you, Alex.
[01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:47.290]  I am on fire.
[01:54:47.290 --> 01:54:53.290]  So they told me, well, you can't be monetized on YouTube unless you support the Ukrainian war.
[01:54:53.290 --> 01:54:55.290]  To me, so I called my rabbi.
[01:54:55.290 --> 01:54:57.290]  I'm like one of my rabbi friends.
[01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:59.290]  I'm like, how am I supposed to do that?
[01:54:59.290 --> 01:55:00.290]  And you know what he told me?
[01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:01.290]  This was really great.
[01:55:01.290 --> 01:55:05.290]  He said, think about how God works, Roseanne.
[01:55:05.290 --> 01:55:11.290]  He's using a Jewish guy, Zelensky, to destroy the Ukrainian Nazis.
[01:55:11.290 --> 01:55:15.290]  And I went, wow, God really is funny.
[01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:17.290]  He really is funny.
[01:55:17.290 --> 01:55:19.290]  That's cool.
[01:55:19.290 --> 01:55:20.290]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:55:20.290 --> 01:55:22.290]  What do you think of Ye?
[01:55:22.290 --> 01:55:24.290]  You think he was doing the same thing you're doing?
[01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:27.290]  Because he wouldn't tell me what his intention was.
[01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:29.290]  Coming on and saying Hitler is great and he loves Hitler.
[01:55:29.290 --> 01:55:31.290]  What do you think that was?
[01:55:31.290 --> 01:55:32.290]  The mask?
[01:55:32.290 --> 01:55:33.290]  I don't know.
[01:55:33.290 --> 01:55:36.290]  I'm just asking your opinion.
[01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:46.290]  I tried to contact him because I think he has a good impulse, but he needs some wires connected.
[01:55:46.290 --> 01:55:52.290]  I felt his impulse was there was something good trying to happen there.
[01:55:52.290 --> 01:56:00.290]  But he needs some real big wires connected that his culture and background does not know how to connect.
[01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:06.290]  A lot of people who don't know what I know, it's impossible for them to connect it.
[01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:13.290]  That's another reason why I'm podcasting, so that people are going to be able to connect it.
[01:56:13.290 --> 01:56:19.290]  Because it is going to be a very powerful weapon against the one who wants us all dead.
[01:56:19.290 --> 01:56:21.290]  Who wants everyone with the soul dead.
[01:56:21.290 --> 01:56:26.290]  Who wants all of our life force to steal it from us to get at our children.
[01:56:26.290 --> 01:56:28.290]  That's the real thing they want.
[01:56:28.290 --> 01:56:31.290]  That's the real thing the devil wants is innocent children.
[01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:35.290]  He's got a lot of wires that aren't connected.
[01:56:35.290 --> 01:56:39.290]  He has bipolar disorder and they probably got him on the wrong meds.
[01:56:39.290 --> 01:56:43.290]  But he can correct it with the right kind of meditation, as have I.
[01:56:43.290 --> 01:56:45.290]  I love to help him.
[01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:49.290]  I called his family and I have offered my help.
[01:56:49.290 --> 01:56:53.290]  They did call me back, but I didn't find the message for three months.
[01:56:53.290 --> 01:56:55.290]  I'll offer it again.
[01:56:55.290 --> 01:56:59.290]  Kanye, I like to help you understand what you don't understand.
[01:56:59.290 --> 01:57:01.290]  There's a lot you don't understand.
[01:57:01.290 --> 01:57:03.290]  I've got his numbers.
[01:57:03.290 --> 01:57:06.290]  So when we get back we should both call him and try to figure out what's going on.
[01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:07.290]  I think he means well.
[01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:08.290]  We're going to go to break.
[01:57:08.290 --> 01:57:09.290]  You take a five minute break.
[01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:10.290]  You've done a great job.
[01:57:10.290 --> 01:57:11.290]  Can I get a smoke?
[01:57:11.290 --> 01:57:12.290]  Yes ma'am.
[01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:14.290]  I don't want to tattle on you, but yes.
[01:57:14.290 --> 01:57:16.290]  You get a six minute break.
[01:57:16.290 --> 01:57:17.290]  So you get six minutes.
[01:57:17.290 --> 01:57:18.290]  Please stay with us next hour.
[01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:19.290]  Let's come back and talk.
[01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:20.290]  RFK Jr.
[01:57:20.290 --> 01:57:21.290]  Trump indictments.
[01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:22.290]  Love him.
[01:57:22.290 --> 01:57:23.290]  The new world order.
[01:57:23.290 --> 01:57:24.290]  How incredible.
[01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:26.290]  They cut it out.
[01:57:26.290 --> 01:57:27.290]  They're going to do it here again.
[01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:28.290]  It's why the mainstream media is dead.
[01:57:28.290 --> 01:57:29.290]  They're not mainstream.
[01:57:29.290 --> 01:57:30.290]  The dinosaur media.
[01:57:30.290 --> 01:57:32.290]  So we're going to play some promos and stuff.
[01:57:32.290 --> 01:57:37.290]  And in the first five minutes, the next hour, then Roseanne Barr will be back in six minutes.
[01:57:37.290 --> 01:57:39.290]  We count this break eight minutes.
[01:57:39.290 --> 01:57:43.290]  So we'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, with our number three with Roseanne Barr.
[01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:44.290]  Madmaxworld.tv.

[01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:58.290]  Cancelling time.
[01:57:58.290 --> 01:57:59.290]  Every 15 days.

[01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:01.290]  Every three months.

[01:58:14.290 --> 01:58:17.290]  Instead of making 20, 30, 40 percent like we do on the products.
[01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:19.290]  But these really are amazing products.
[01:58:19.290 --> 01:58:21.290]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[01:58:21.290 --> 01:58:23.290]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[01:58:23.290 --> 01:58:25.290]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[01:58:25.290 --> 01:58:27.290]  People are listening more than ever.
[01:58:27.290 --> 01:58:29.290]  But in this major recession going into depression.
[01:58:29.290 --> 01:58:31.290]  And with supply chain breakdowns.
[01:58:31.290 --> 01:58:32.290]  I know it's hard.
[01:58:32.290 --> 01:58:33.290]  I know times are tough.
[01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:35.290]  So thank you for your support.

[01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:18.290]  It boosts women.

[01:59:19.290 --> 01:59:21.290]  But women like pink labels.
[01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:23.290]  Men like different color labels.
[01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:25.290]  So it works for men as well.
[01:59:25.290 --> 01:59:26.290]  It's the same formula.

[01:59:58.290 --> 02:00:01.290]  One of the things that we're not hearing a lot about.
[02:00:01.290 --> 02:00:02.290]  Is the unique.
[02:00:02.290 --> 02:00:04.290]  Potential safety problem.
[02:00:04.290 --> 02:00:06.290]  Of coronavirus vaccines.
[02:00:06.290 --> 02:00:07.290]  And then.
[02:00:07.290 --> 02:00:08.290]  Something changed.
[02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:09.290]  Any vaccine.
[02:00:09.290 --> 02:00:11.290]  Released by emergency use authorization.
[02:00:11.290 --> 02:00:12.290]  By the FDA.
[02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:13.290]  Is an outstanding.
[02:00:13.290 --> 02:00:14.290]  Vaccine.
[02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:15.290]  J&J's vaccine.
[02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:18.290]  Has a risk of life threatening blood clots.
[02:00:19.290 --> 02:00:20.290]  When you hear the beep.
[02:00:20.290 --> 02:00:22.290]  That's the sound of safety.
[02:00:22.290 --> 02:00:23.290]  So don't overthink it.
[02:00:23.290 --> 02:00:25.290]  They're both really good.
[02:00:25.290 --> 02:00:28.290]  They're all really good vaccines.
[02:00:28.290 --> 02:00:29.290]  Get vaccinated now.
[02:00:29.290 --> 02:00:30.290]  You gotta call now.
[02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:31.290]  If you wait.
[02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:32.290]  It's gonna be really too late.
[02:00:32.290 --> 02:00:33.290]  To protect your child.
[02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:34.290]  If this was your child.
[02:00:34.290 --> 02:00:35.290]  What happens next.
[02:00:35.290 --> 02:00:37.290]  Could make it the worst day of your life.
[02:00:37.290 --> 02:00:39.290]  So even though COVID poses zero threat.
[02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:40.290]  To healthy children.
[02:00:40.290 --> 02:00:41.290]  Vaccinate your children.
[02:00:41.290 --> 02:00:42.290]  Do the right thing.
[02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:43.290]  Be safe.
[02:00:43.290 --> 02:00:44.290]  And not sorry.
[02:00:44.290 --> 02:00:46.290]  I'm strongly recommending.
[02:00:46.290 --> 02:00:47.290]  For adolescents to get their.
[02:00:47.290 --> 02:00:48.290]  Two doses of vaccine.
[02:00:48.290 --> 02:00:51.290]  Fully immunized after those two doses.
[02:00:51.290 --> 02:00:52.290]  Advanced technology.
[02:00:52.290 --> 02:00:53.290]  That can help save lives.
[02:00:53.290 --> 02:00:55.290]  This is gonna be a long lasting vaccine.
[02:00:55.290 --> 02:00:57.290]  A long lasting vaccine.
[02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:59.290]  A few moments later.
[02:00:59.290 --> 02:01:00.290]  We're seeing that two doses.
[02:01:00.290 --> 02:01:02.290]  Is not holding up well.
[02:01:02.290 --> 02:01:04.290]  For emergency room visits.
[02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:06.290]  It's not holding up well for hospitalizations.
[02:01:06.290 --> 02:01:09.290]  Here we go again.
[02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:11.290]  Everyone's going to need a booster.
[02:01:11.290 --> 02:01:13.290]  You need that third immunization.
[02:01:13.290 --> 02:01:14.290]  Triple the amount.
[02:01:14.290 --> 02:01:15.290]  Get that third immunization.
[02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:16.290]  The two mRNA vaccines.
[02:01:16.290 --> 02:01:18.290]  Were always a three dose vaccine.
[02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:19.290]  The two mRNA vaccines.
[02:01:19.290 --> 02:01:21.290]  Were always a three dose vaccine.
[02:01:21.290 --> 02:01:23.290]  I've always said this is a three dose vaccine.
[02:01:23.290 --> 02:01:25.290]  I've always said this is a three dose vaccine.
[02:01:25.290 --> 02:01:27.290]  This is a three dose vaccine.
[02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:28.290]  But I'm not done yet.
[02:01:28.290 --> 02:01:30.290]  That third immunization.
[02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:32.290]  The problem is.
[02:01:32.290 --> 02:01:33.290]  It's not holding up.
[02:01:33.290 --> 02:01:35.290]  So we may have to look at.
[02:01:35.290 --> 02:01:37.290]  Sort of innovative solutions.
[02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:38.290]  Oh god not this again.
[02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:40.290]  A fourth immunization.
[02:01:40.290 --> 02:01:42.290]  Just to keep them going.
[02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:43.290]  Keep the country going.
[02:01:43.290 --> 02:01:45.290]  We have to consider some out of the box things.
[02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:46.290]  A fourth immunization.
[02:01:46.290 --> 02:01:47.290]  Fourth.
[02:01:47.290 --> 02:01:48.290]  A fourth immunization.
[02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:49.290]  Get that second boost.
[02:01:49.290 --> 02:01:50.290]  A second boost.
[02:01:50.290 --> 02:01:51.290]  To keep the country going.
[02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:53.290]  I've made that recommendation.
[02:01:53.290 --> 02:01:54.290]  A fourth immunization.
[02:01:54.290 --> 02:01:56.290]  But I'm still not done.
[02:01:56.290 --> 02:02:00.290]  Unfortunately the numbers are starting to trend up again.
[02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:02.290]  So the hospitalizations are up.
[02:02:02.290 --> 02:02:05.290]  And so the most important message that I have this morning.
[02:02:05.290 --> 02:02:07.290]  Is get your new bivalent booster.
[02:02:07.290 --> 02:02:10.290]  Willie and Lise were saying they got their booster.
[02:02:10.290 --> 02:02:11.290]  And I was like oh I need to get mine.
[02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:13.290]  And then I found out.
[02:02:13.290 --> 02:02:15.290]  They're talking about the third shot.
[02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:19.290]  And is that the bivalent or is it the fourth booster.
[02:02:19.290 --> 02:02:20.290]  Or does it matter.
[02:02:20.290 --> 02:02:22.290]  Don't worry so much about the number.
[02:02:22.290 --> 02:02:23.290]  There's no wrong way to use it.
[02:02:23.290 --> 02:02:24.290]  You have to get it.
[02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:26.290]  This new bivalent booster.
[02:02:26.290 --> 02:02:28.290]  You can double or triple stack them.
[02:02:28.290 --> 02:02:30.290]  The new bivalent one is doing a much better job.
[02:02:30.290 --> 02:02:31.290]  You have to get a booster.
[02:02:31.290 --> 02:02:33.290]  You need to get this new bivalent booster.
[02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:35.290]  That bivalent booster for COVID.
[02:02:35.290 --> 02:02:38.290]  But does everyone ages 12 and older need a booster.
[02:02:38.290 --> 02:02:39.290]  The answer is yes.
[02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:40.290]  Yes.
[02:02:40.290 --> 02:02:43.290]  And by the way if you're over 50 and have gotten two boosters.
[02:02:43.290 --> 02:02:46.290]  And more than two to four months out.
[02:02:46.290 --> 02:02:48.290]  You're going to need a third booster as well.
[02:02:48.290 --> 02:02:50.290]  A fifth immunization.
[02:02:50.290 --> 02:02:51.290]  Five.
[02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:55.290]  I don't think we're going to need an annual booster like flu.
[02:02:55.290 --> 02:02:56.290]  Eventually.
[02:02:56.290 --> 02:03:00.290]  Dr. Hotez supports yearly boosters just like flu.
[02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:01.290]  But I'm still not done.
[02:03:01.290 --> 02:03:05.290]  It looks as though the boosters are not holding up quite as well as we'd like.
[02:03:05.290 --> 02:03:09.290]  And I think our thinking is going to change.
[02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:13.290]  And that what's going to happen is every, you know, few months.
[02:03:13.290 --> 02:03:15.290]  We may need another booster.
[02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:18.290]  Perfect results each and every time.
[02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:22.290]  You know we just could not overcome that massive disinformation campaign.
[02:03:22.290 --> 02:03:25.290]  These fake concepts of herd immunity and discrediting masks.
[02:03:25.290 --> 02:03:27.290]  Dr. Hotez you are a national treasure.
[02:03:27.290 --> 02:03:30.290]  It is picking off young people like we've never seen.
[02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:32.290]  Dr. Peter Hotez that was extremely informative.
[02:03:32.290 --> 02:03:35.290]  Disinformation that you're hearing that kids are fine.
[02:03:35.290 --> 02:03:36.290]  It's nonsense.
[02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:38.290]  Kids need to get that vaccination.
[02:03:38.290 --> 02:03:40.290]  You healthcare workers have been our saviors.
[02:03:40.290 --> 02:03:42.290]  Watch out for that misinformation.
[02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:46.290]  Dr. Peter Hotez is probably one of the smartest people on this topic.
[02:03:46.290 --> 02:03:50.290]  If you haven't gotten your five and ups vaccinated yet, now's the time to do that.
[02:03:50.290 --> 02:03:52.290]  Dr. Peter Hotez thank you for saving the world.
[02:03:52.290 --> 02:03:56.290]  We also support giving that third immunization for the 12 to 17 year olds.
[02:03:56.290 --> 02:03:57.290]  People have to feel safe.
[02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:59.290]  Dr. Hotez you are a voice of reason.
[02:03:59.290 --> 02:04:01.290]  Take down the fake information.
[02:04:01.290 --> 02:04:03.290]  These fake concepts of herd immunity.
[02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:05.290]  Our last hope is to vaccinate our way through this.
[02:04:05.290 --> 02:04:08.290]  Make certain that everybody's vaccinated including their kids.
[02:04:08.290 --> 02:04:12.290]  That's the single most important thing right now the American people have to do.
[02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:17.290]  Dr. Peter Hotez was a person that we like to go to for this sort of expertise.
[02:04:17.290 --> 02:04:23.290]  The single most impactful thing you can do is make certain that you're fully boosted and preferably too boosted.
[02:04:23.290 --> 02:04:26.290]  Monkeypox is a global emergency.
[02:04:26.290 --> 02:04:32.290]  And it's accelerating among a specific social network of men who have sex with men.
[02:04:32.290 --> 02:04:34.290]  Not because it's sexually transmitted.
[02:04:34.290 --> 02:04:37.290]  Monkeypox is sexually transmitted.
[02:04:37.290 --> 02:04:39.290]  Almost exclusively.
[02:04:39.290 --> 02:04:41.290]  Before we let you go we have to stop and applaud you.
[02:04:41.290 --> 02:04:46.290]  Because a lot of MSNBC viewers have watched you constantly for the last three years or so.
[02:04:46.290 --> 02:04:47.290]  And have come to trust you.
[02:04:47.290 --> 02:04:49.290]  I don't know if they fully appreciate what you have done.
[02:04:58.290 --> 02:05:01.290]  InfoWars is a one of a kind operation.
[02:05:01.290 --> 02:05:04.290]  And so please go to InfoWars store and just make a donation.
[02:05:04.290 --> 02:05:06.290]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:08.290]  You have a little profile there.
[02:05:08.290 --> 02:05:09.290]  Cancel anytime.
[02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:11.290]  Every 15 days.
[02:05:11.290 --> 02:05:12.290]  Every month.
[02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:13.290]  Every three months.
[02:05:13.290 --> 02:05:14.290]  Every six months.
[02:05:14.290 --> 02:05:15.290]  Up to nine months.
[02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:18.290]  You can go in and every month or every week.
[02:05:18.290 --> 02:05:19.290]  Whenever you want you program it.
[02:05:19.290 --> 02:05:20.290]  You just click it.
[02:05:20.290 --> 02:05:22.290]  And then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[02:05:22.290 --> 02:05:23.290]  So please do that as well.
[02:05:23.290 --> 02:05:25.290]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees.
[02:05:25.290 --> 02:05:28.290]  Instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:30.290]  But these really are amazing products.
[02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:32.290]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[02:05:32.290 --> 02:05:35.290]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[02:05:35.290 --> 02:05:37.290]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[02:05:37.290 --> 02:05:38.290]  People are listening more than ever.
[02:05:38.290 --> 02:05:41.290]  But in this major recession going into depression.
[02:05:41.290 --> 02:05:42.290]  And with supply chain breakdowns.
[02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:43.290]  I know it's hard.
[02:05:43.290 --> 02:05:44.290]  I know times are tough.
[02:05:44.290 --> 02:05:46.290]  So thank you for your support.
[02:05:46.290 --> 02:05:47.290]  But whatever you do.
[02:05:47.290 --> 02:05:48.290]  Pray for the broadcast.
[02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:49.290]  And share the articles and the videos.
[02:05:49.290 --> 02:05:51.290]  That you can do for free.
[02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:53.290]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[02:05:53.290 --> 02:05:55.290]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us.
[02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:56.290]  Please support us now.
[02:05:56.290 --> 02:05:58.290]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:05:58.290 --> 02:05:59.290]  God bless you.
[02:06:01.290 --> 02:06:03.290]  adjourned
[02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:12.290]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:14.290]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:19.290]  So.
[02:06:19.290 --> 02:06:22.290]  Roseanne Barr is an iconic TV host and comedian.
[02:06:22.290 --> 02:06:24.290]  And she's become even more iconic.
[02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:26.290]  The last 6, 7 years.
[02:06:26.290 --> 02:06:27.290]  For being censored.
[02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:28.290]  For saying George Soros.
[02:06:30.290 --> 02:06:35.730]  Works for Hitler, though he said it was the best time of his life and everything else, uh, but but that's how it works
[02:06:37.090 --> 02:06:38.450]  so now
[02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:45.330]  We see robert f kennedy jr being censored. We're saying that atrazine sterilizes frogs and also bends the gender of humans
[02:06:45.889 --> 02:06:47.570]  in studies and now
[02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:50.050]  Google and youtube have censored another video of him
[02:06:50.610 --> 02:06:52.610]  That's presidential election meddling
[02:06:54.130 --> 02:06:56.550]  And this just broke this is the new york times and axios
[02:06:57.330 --> 02:07:03.670]  Axios balsonaro who son who's in the member of parliament there congress said we helped wake him up years ago
[02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:08.710]  Has been banned by the communist government that clearly stole the last election from running
[02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:11.350]  So if you question that there was election meddling
[02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:13.590]  This is election meddling
[02:07:13.590 --> 02:07:17.910]  The government's saying he can't run for office just like they're trying to get trump to be ineligible
[02:07:18.309 --> 02:07:20.630]  Just like they don't want tucker to be able to continue his show
[02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:26.650]  They want him silenced they want us silenced this is outrageous brazil court borrowers balsonaro
[02:07:27.670 --> 02:07:29.670]  From running for office for eight years
[02:07:30.469 --> 02:07:34.630]  Brazil's highest court that was always at war with him voted friday to ban former president
[02:07:35.170 --> 02:07:40.870]  Balsonaro from running for office for eight years for undermining the country's democracy and making false claims about his voting system
[02:07:41.590 --> 02:07:45.670]  So because he pointed out that he only lost in one city and they found all these magic votes
[02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:47.910]  This is right to say that just like you're in the u.s
[02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:54.790]  Oh, it's illegal to question election fraud unless you're a democrat or a communist they're saying you can't have who you want to vote for
[02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:59.430]  Because he said we're trying to keep him from voting for him
[02:08:00.389 --> 02:08:02.389]  So again, you can't have
[02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:05.670]  Who you want to vote for
[02:08:06.230 --> 02:08:09.110]  Because he said we want to keep you from voting for him
[02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:15.270]  You can't have this candidate because you and the this candidate say we're trying to keep you from voting for him
[02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:17.430]  So now you can't vote for him
[02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:21.910]  20 plus members of congress that were at the capitol who supported the january 6 peaceful protests
[02:08:22.389 --> 02:08:24.389]  Like mtg and gozer and others
[02:08:24.710 --> 02:08:30.150]  The democratic party went into state court and tried to block them from running for office because they're popular
[02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:36.389]  This is pure election meddling. That's what the censorship is. That's what all this control is. It's outrageous. It's in your face
[02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:45.270]  The populist former president will also be banned from seeking any lower office the ruling if upheld after an expected appeal
[02:08:46.230 --> 02:08:50.490]  Will prevent balsamaro from running in the next presidential election schedule for 2026
[02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:56.550]  Because we know when you still want election it makes the person more popular look at trump
[02:08:56.710 --> 02:09:01.430]  This is a perfect example of what's happening. What is your view on the indictments of trump jack smith?
[02:09:01.670 --> 02:09:05.430]  What's your view on rfk jr a lot to cover rosanne bar?
[02:09:08.230 --> 02:09:10.230]  I think that you know it
[02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:14.710]  Somebody should sue the entire government under rico
[02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:19.190]  Uh, they should get giuliani. He won under rico. I won. Uh,
[02:09:19.670 --> 02:09:23.590]  A couple of lawsuits under rico against tabloids and I won
[02:09:24.389 --> 02:09:26.389]  upwards of seven figures
[02:09:26.389 --> 02:09:32.309]  Um, all you have to do is prove organized crime, which I think you know, uh durham. He sort of proved that already
[02:09:32.469 --> 02:09:35.750]  Um, it's organized crime. It's a criminal
[02:09:36.389 --> 02:09:40.550]  Uh cabal that runs our country and they do nothing legal
[02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:42.950]  Everything they do is illegal
[02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:48.070]  They they don't care about our laws. They just make new laws and they're not even supposed to be
[02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:50.870]  Making legislation, but they do
[02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:58.950]  It's judicial fiat like in israel, you know, a bunch of really communist left-wing people in israel
[02:09:59.030 --> 02:10:02.309]  Are have taken over the judicial system there
[02:10:02.710 --> 02:10:08.950]  And what they do is if you are a religious jew in israel and you go under the left-wing
[02:10:09.670 --> 02:10:14.870]  A judicial system there you are automatically guilty and people don't know that
[02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:19.910]  It's like an extreme example of what's in america. It's like
[02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:25.110]  to the left of america the attack on religious people or people who
[02:10:25.670 --> 02:10:27.750]  You don't have any belief system at all
[02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:34.230]  That isn't uh secular humanism, which secular humanism is a gateway drug to satanism, I think
[02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:39.910]  But uh, you know and it really is if you think about it and that brings me back to the whole story of kane
[02:10:40.150 --> 02:10:42.150]  Versus abel which people don't know
[02:10:42.469 --> 02:10:49.830]  But their fight was that abel said that there is a judge of the universe and kane said there is no judge
[02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:55.430]  That's ridiculous. That was their fight. People don't know that and that is the fight we're having still today
[02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:57.830]  and then you know kane was
[02:10:58.150 --> 02:11:03.030]  Was a blood drinker and so are the people who say the very same thing today
[02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:09.750]  The bible I believe was written and it's timeless and it it means it applies more
[02:11:10.309 --> 02:11:14.710]  To today than it did in the past. It's about today right now
[02:11:15.190 --> 02:11:18.309]  It's a time machine that is about right now
[02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:24.389]  And I I do teach that and talk about that with people which is what I would talk to kanye about
[02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:26.710]  I don't think he has
[02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:29.670]  together about people say that this is a
[02:11:30.309 --> 02:11:37.030]  Kind of a war about good versus evil and I wish they knew just how dead on they are and why
[02:11:38.389 --> 02:11:40.389]  Because it's true
[02:11:41.110 --> 02:11:45.270]  What do you think you asked me I know I went off there that's that's exactly where i'm going
[02:11:45.590 --> 02:11:47.590]  What do you make of rfk jr?
[02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:51.670]  He's a truth teller I hate that he's
[02:11:52.309 --> 02:11:58.550]  I mean, I think that he's waking up democrats. I don't think they could hear anything trump or you know says
[02:11:59.270 --> 02:12:03.830]  But I love that he respects trump and that he says trump is a great debater and he
[02:12:04.230 --> 02:12:08.150]  You know respects and has love for trump because his whole family did
[02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:13.910]  And uh, you know, we all know that trump was a very dear friend of jfk jr
[02:12:14.309 --> 02:12:18.309]  And they were very tight and i'm sure they talked about a lot of things
[02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:24.230]  And uh, i'm sure that trump is a friend of rfk jr, too. So it's good
[02:12:24.309 --> 02:12:29.590]  It's like a maybe a needed healing for our nation to bring people together because if we don't
[02:12:30.150 --> 02:12:36.469]  Get together and like I I in my act I say why can't we use all the hatred we have for each other?
[02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:42.630]  And make it work for us get together with all of our hatred and just point it upward
[02:12:43.330 --> 02:12:49.830]  Together at the guilty instead of each other. Let's take all of the hatred we feel for each other
[02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:55.750]  That they've farmed us to do and and just uh, you know
[02:12:56.150 --> 02:13:02.070]  Instead of hating each other. Let's just point it upwards at the people who are doing all of this to us
[02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:07.750]  Let's put our hate upward because people say oh, we've got to love we've got to forget
[02:13:08.309 --> 02:13:10.389]  Forgive and love and that's all crap
[02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:16.630]  God tells us who we are to hate evil and to do everything we can to fight and destroy it
[02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:18.950]  He doesn't say love and forgive it
[02:13:19.190 --> 02:13:24.870]  We're under mind control to say we're supposed to forgive all the horrible things that are done to us
[02:13:25.190 --> 02:13:30.309]  We're supposed to fight it and destroy it. We're supposed to bring it to its knees. It needs to go
[02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:36.790]  I totally agree, you know, there's so many topics so many angles so many things
[02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:40.950]  We could cover and hit here. You got to be on god's side alex
[02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:43.750]  You can't be tricked into
[02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:49.510]  Being fooled and tricked to be on the side of evil and that's what I just see people being tricked
[02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:52.790]  and fooled into being on the side of evil and you know
[02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:56.389]  They don't think they're going to be judged for it because they don't believe that there is a judge
[02:13:56.469 --> 02:14:00.150]  But there is a judge and i'm one of them. I'm going to judge them
[02:14:01.190 --> 02:14:08.150]  I feel like I have been called to judge them, you know, my family name is david and i'm very proud of that
[02:14:08.230 --> 02:14:13.590]  I'm from the tribe and the house of david and i'm probably the last of my line one of them
[02:14:14.230 --> 02:14:19.030]  But i'll stand here in it and talk and say and speak for you know
[02:14:19.110 --> 02:14:22.389]  Till god takes me away from this world. I will do it
[02:14:24.070 --> 02:14:28.790]  Beautiful I want to go over some major articles with you and get your take on on some major issues here in a moment
[02:14:29.190 --> 02:14:34.469]  Uh, but but before we do that you do a podcast. You've got a website. We'll put it on screen
[02:14:34.710 --> 02:14:40.170]  I I said it wrong. It's uh, rosannebard.com not rosanne world rosannebard.com
[02:14:41.130 --> 02:14:48.090]  And you can find my podcast where you find all the podcasts rumble, uh, whatever they're called rumble, um,
[02:14:48.809 --> 02:14:52.809]  You know, I don't know. Well, I want listeners to realize that they know who you are
[02:14:53.050 --> 02:14:56.090]  They like what you're saying and they but they have to remember
[02:14:56.410 --> 02:15:00.010]  The way we get around censors and break the back of the system is promoting people
[02:15:00.490 --> 02:15:03.309]  That are telling the truth and opening up minds to go to rosannebar.com
[02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:10.350]  Well, that's what I said, but I said on feel because you're not allowed to say hey they they stole I had to use
[02:15:11.130 --> 02:15:16.910]  Sarcasm to say of course biden got 81 million votes by winning 36 counties
[02:15:17.150 --> 02:15:23.790]  I had to use sarcasm. Otherwise, I wouldn't be nowhere and then they say you can't use sarcasm either
[02:15:25.230 --> 02:15:28.590]  Of course biden can you know win the iron man, of course biden can fly
[02:15:29.550 --> 02:15:34.750]  Of course though, you know hitler didn't kill anybody and then and then they have the nerve because I went and watched the full show
[02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:39.630]  You did that to say that you literally were saying that that is so sick
[02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:45.790]  It is and the people through it doing it too. They knew that they removed the biden part of it on purpose
[02:15:46.110 --> 02:15:49.790]  So they're that evil they they want me dead
[02:15:50.590 --> 02:15:55.550]  You know, and then they killed my character and all my friends who you know are whistleblowers
[02:15:55.550 --> 02:15:57.309]  I have a lot of friends that are whistleblowers
[02:15:57.309 --> 02:16:01.630]  They said they killed you to send a message because they want you
[02:16:01.870 --> 02:16:05.389]  With your face in the dirt with their jackboot grinding it in the dirt
[02:16:05.710 --> 02:16:11.790]  They're trying to send a psychological message for you that you're finished and that you should kill yourself
[02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:14.110]  And I felt that they were doing that to me too
[02:16:14.430 --> 02:16:20.670]  But unluckily for them I have god and they can't do nothing about that. They can't take me away from god
[02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:25.230]  They can't shut god up and they can't shut me up either and here I am back
[02:16:25.309 --> 02:16:29.309]  I'm 70 and I feel like i'm 16 years old because i'm that
[02:16:30.030 --> 02:16:32.029]  pissed
[02:16:32.190 --> 02:16:33.630]  Well, you're definitely on fire
[02:16:33.630 --> 02:16:39.550]  I will fight for this country till i'm dead and gone and then probably I might come back from the dead to do it some more
[02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:45.310]  Well, I want to run through I want to run through a laundry list of topics with you than any other topics you want

[02:19:46.510 --> 02:19:48.270]  All right, roseanne
[02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:50.990]  I got 100 questions while we're getting these callers on the board here
[02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:53.470]  as they call in
[02:19:53.470 --> 02:19:57.550]  But just think because your millions are listening to you right now and millions will watch this later
[02:19:57.950 --> 02:20:00.830]  What else is on your radar screen? What else is key to you?
[02:20:00.910 --> 02:20:04.350]  What else do you want to impart to viewers? I interrupted you with a break an hour ago
[02:20:04.510 --> 02:20:09.790]  You said what about the holocaust and how it's a sacrifice and how they're doing new sacrifices against us
[02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:14.270]  And I agree that was a satanic ritual by the nazis. They admitted it and it's similar cults now
[02:20:16.029 --> 02:20:18.910]  I mean describe what you meant by that and then other points you want to make before we go to calls
[02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:21.470]  uh, well, they
[02:20:21.470 --> 02:20:26.190]  They rich I believe that the holocaust was a ritual sacrifice of jewish blood
[02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:31.950]  Because they are always going after jewish blood. It's at a premium. It still is I mean, you know
[02:20:32.830 --> 02:20:38.990]  The un pays for jewish blood, uh, you know from their ngos, um
[02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:45.150]  nazi ngos pay for jewish blood and uh, you know, and then the un
[02:20:46.110 --> 02:20:51.630]  Oh my god, they're so evil. Oh my god. They're so evil. They're trying to erase jewish history in
[02:20:52.330 --> 02:20:56.750]  jerusalem and judea where the jewish people come from where the bible
[02:20:57.230 --> 02:21:01.310]  It's about they're trying to get rid of the bible I think and god
[02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:06.830]  But uh, it's it's all about sacrificing jewish lives and who's behind it are people
[02:21:07.470 --> 02:21:13.230]  You follow the money who gets rich when the jewish people are are killed and their property is
[02:21:14.330 --> 02:21:16.330]  Absorbed think about it
[02:21:18.350 --> 02:21:20.350]  I agree, please continue on that line
[02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:22.830]  well, it's
[02:21:22.830 --> 02:21:28.990]  the rothschilds the banker the rothschild banking family gets rich when they kill jewish people and that's what
[02:21:29.310 --> 02:21:31.390]  Happened in world war ii they
[02:21:33.150 --> 02:21:35.150]  They leverage the lives of jews
[02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:38.590]  That's how they got rich in the first place
[02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:45.950]  They they they took the property of the jews they set up and that's what the evil jews do and it says that in the bible
[02:21:46.270 --> 02:21:48.350]  That god told moses don't take
[02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:55.950]  They're called the arab rav. That's what I want to tell kanye. Don't say jews kanye say arab rav
[02:21:56.590 --> 02:22:02.670]  Um, that's what the bible says that god told moses don't take them out. They're they're mixed with pharaoh
[02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:07.710]  They're they're mixed with the babylonian bloodline the arab rav
[02:22:08.110 --> 02:22:15.470]  God told moses leave him in egypt. Don't take him out and and moses argued with god and moses said but you yourself said
[02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:21.150]  Anybody can change anybody can repent anybody can come to you and god said they can't change
[02:22:21.470 --> 02:22:28.510]  Because they're mixed in with that bloodline they cannot change and and moses said but you yourself say god
[02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:32.590]  That anyone can have a change of heart and so god said to moses
[02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:36.430]  Okay, take them out and see what happens. God said have it your way
[02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:40.510]  So what happened the first thing they did when moses was 10 minutes late?
[02:22:40.510 --> 02:22:43.890]  They build a golden calf to hathor the cow that the egyptian
[02:22:44.590 --> 02:22:46.590]  You know satanist child
[02:22:46.650 --> 02:22:51.310]  Sacrificers worshiped every single thing in deep judaism
[02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:57.310]  It says every single thing that befalls the jewish people. It does not come from the gentiles
[02:22:57.390 --> 02:23:01.230]  It comes from the arab rav. They set up the jewish people because they become
[02:23:02.430 --> 02:23:03.310]  rich
[02:23:03.310 --> 02:23:09.950]  When they turn in their fellows, it's about the enemy within it isn't about the gentile nations or any of the stuff that they
[02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:11.710]  come
[02:23:11.710 --> 02:23:18.350]  Spread that crap. It is about them. They hate us because we believe that there is a judge and they being from cain
[02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:24.190]  They believe there is no judge. In other words, they believe there is no god above them besides a cow
[02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:27.470]  Or an owl or something like that, you know the goat
[02:23:28.029 --> 02:23:33.470]  But and the rothschilds you can see in their parties. They wear goat heads, you know, they do they are child
[02:23:33.930 --> 02:23:37.390]  Sacrificers and they call themselves jews, but they are in no way jews
[02:23:37.630 --> 02:23:43.310]  But moses took him out and that's why moses was not allowed to enter the promised land and in his final speech
[02:23:43.869 --> 02:23:47.710]  To uh the nations which the bible says that he spoke in
[02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:51.390]  You know every tongue at the same time and everybody heard him
[02:23:51.390 --> 02:23:59.310]  So he spoke in several and of course, this is allegory and it's about spiritual. It's about the spiritual war. It isn't like
[02:24:00.430 --> 02:24:02.430]  Word for word. It's about
[02:24:02.590 --> 02:24:04.990]  the war in the spirit world
[02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:07.470]  And uh, you know
[02:24:07.470 --> 02:24:09.310]  He regretted that
[02:24:09.310 --> 02:24:13.310]  and uh, you know, he wished he had not done it and so here they are and
[02:24:14.590 --> 02:24:17.470]  The bible tells us that they are responsible
[02:24:17.550 --> 02:24:24.430]  They delay the redemption of humanity more than any other group and all you have to do is look around at these people
[02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:26.029]  and
[02:24:26.029 --> 02:24:33.230]  they're at the top it says they're easily identifiable because they sit at the top of every power structure and all they do is
[02:24:33.869 --> 02:24:41.310]  Destroy they can't create anything. All they do is destroy and their their prized possession is to destroy
[02:24:41.950 --> 02:24:46.910]  the hearts and souls of the people who have hearts and souls and who
[02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:49.550]  You know believe in god
[02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:54.910]  That's what they feed on and and they love creating our fear. They love they get
[02:24:55.790 --> 02:25:02.130]  Energy, uh from making us fear them and from making us think that they rule us, but in reality
[02:25:02.690 --> 02:25:04.690]  They don't it's just all
[02:25:05.470 --> 02:25:07.470]  artificial intelligence
[02:25:07.970 --> 02:25:10.050]  We we've got to go to break in a few minutes to come back with callers
[02:25:10.610 --> 02:25:12.210]  I mean the lines are loaded up here
[02:25:12.210 --> 02:25:18.610]  But I wanted to add a term arab rav to the human beings because you need to know that stop saying the jews
[02:25:19.090 --> 02:25:21.090]  Say the arab rav
[02:25:22.930 --> 02:25:26.310]  That means good teachers of bad information
[02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:31.670]  You you you mentioned that the mutilation of children the whole transgender cult it's everywhere
[02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:33.910]  They're passing laws to arrest you
[02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:38.790]  They're passing laws to take children away from parents if the parents won't let the state cut their genitals off
[02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:42.470]  This is just unbelievable evil. This is sacrifice of children's future
[02:25:43.029 --> 02:25:46.310]  And then when they commit suicide, they say oh they commit suicide because you weren't nice to them
[02:25:46.310 --> 02:25:54.310]  No, the national institutes of health did a study they committed suicide because of the chemicals and the surgeries the suicide of children
[02:25:54.390 --> 02:25:59.270]  Surgeries the suicide of people who've had the uh gender
[02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:02.310]  you know affirming
[02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:10.630]  It's far higher than people who commit suicide because they feel they're in the wrong body and they're lying about every bit of it
[02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:13.910]  You know what? They are they're doing it for money
[02:26:14.310 --> 02:26:18.790]  They got uh, the insurance companies to cover it and they're just making money
[02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:26.310]  They're making bank on it mutilating kids making them sterile. You think that a seven-year-old kid understands that they'll never have sex
[02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:28.790]  They will never have sex
[02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:30.790]  They will never have an orgasm
[02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:34.390]  They will never have children and they'll never have sex in their life
[02:26:34.390 --> 02:26:38.390]  You think a seven-year-old understands that but gavin newsome thinks they do
[02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:43.750]  Well, they know it's the next best thing to kill them in the womb or human sacrifice
[02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:49.270]  Well, they can get in there and put their hands all over their genitals. I think oh boy, that's their big thrill and
[02:26:50.310 --> 02:26:53.990]  It's just pedophilia. That's what they're trying to do at the un level
[02:26:54.470 --> 02:26:56.470]  And nobody knows that
[02:26:57.430 --> 02:27:03.190]  To lower the age of consent herself and then she's everybody's hero. She was right there doing it
[02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:06.070]  She wanted to lower the age of consent below 12
[02:27:06.390 --> 02:27:11.350]  And what are they all saying? Oh children have the right to have sex with adults that are perverts
[02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:15.029]  That's the official un policy with a dozen judges
[02:27:15.490 --> 02:27:20.230]  Legalized sex any child wants to have sex. I'm good. Can they buy cigarettes? Can they buy a gun in the military? No
[02:27:20.869 --> 02:27:24.710]  No children have to be protected. It's kane saying there is no judge
[02:27:25.350 --> 02:27:31.610]  That's why they don't like israel either because they want to get rid of that because israel and jews and christians
[02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:37.830]  And muslims say but there is a judge. No, there isn't. That's what they're saying. There is no judge
[02:27:38.470 --> 02:27:43.190]  Well, that's what dr. Zelenko said before he died he was so smart were you familiar with dr. Zelenko
[02:27:43.350 --> 02:27:47.510]  He was a dear dear dear friend that tried to save my sister's life
[02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:51.130]  He tried to save my little sister's life and unfortunately
[02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:53.990]  She died
[02:27:56.710 --> 02:28:02.630]  Yeah, I had family almost killed by these people and i'm i'm i'm mad and and they really are evil and they are against god
[02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:04.390]  And they know that's what they're doing
[02:28:04.390 --> 02:28:08.550]  We're at madmaxworld.tv because you can't share inputwords.com or man.video on most platforms

[02:33:08.500 --> 02:33:12.500]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:33:12.500 --> 02:33:16.500]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:19.500]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:24.500]  Your film is now ready to be shown.
[02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:56.500]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. I'm so glad that you could join us today for this Wednesday, July 25th, 2001 broadcast.
[02:33:56.500 --> 02:34:06.500]  Two months before 9-11, Alex Jones went on live television and predicted that there was going to be a major false flag terror attack.
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:11.500]  Tyranny is enveloping the globe, and the United States is a shining jewel the globalists want to bring down,
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:14.500]  and they will use terrorism as the pretext to get it done.
[02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:19.500]  We know the government's planning terrorism. We know Oklahoma City and World Trade Center was terrorism.
[02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:22.500]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners.
[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:25.500]  If you do it, we're going to blame you, because we know who's up to it.
[02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:29.500]  Alex said the terrorist attack would take place in New York City,
[02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:37.500]  specifically the World Trade Center, orchestrated by the CIA's boogeyman, Osama bin Laden.
[02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:41.500]  Or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center, we know who to blame.
[02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:43.500]  If any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:49.500]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, running the Mujahideen War,
[02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:53.500]  and whose family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now,
[02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:55.500]  and sits on the board of Iridium Satellite,
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:34:59.500]  he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:14.500]  And we are back live as we wage war on corruption here.
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:16.500]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:18.500]  Roseanne Barr is back in the studio.
[02:35:18.500 --> 02:35:21.500]  Talk about huge breaking news.
[02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:27.500]  I just read a tweet from Elon Musk that I wasn't aware of, about Paul Ehrlich.
[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:33.500]  I talked about him earlier today, who helped write the U.S. government plan for eugenics depopulation,
[02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:40.500]  basically Hitler 2.0, dealing with the sterilization of 8 million Native Americans,
[02:35:40.500 --> 02:35:42.500]  and a project that he was involved in.
[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:46.500]  And Elon Musk says, Paul Ehrlich has done immense damage to humanity, immense.
[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:47.500]  I despise him.
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:51.500]  That's in a big article by Shane Cashman.
[02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:53.500]  Everybody loves Alex Jones.
[02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:54.500]  The story's not really about me.
[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:56.500]  It's just about the crazy world that's going on.
[02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:59.500]  I mean, I'm part of the story, but that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:05.500]  It's a very long article full of a lot of really wild stuff, and he only posted part of it.
[02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:07.500]  The full article's at TimCast.com.
[02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:10.500]  So it was great to have him in the studio with us a few weeks ago,
[02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:11.500]  and a really impressive article he's written.
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:12.500]  I've read the whole thing.
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:13.500]  I've read like a third of it.
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:14.500]  It's long.
[02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:15.500]  Shane Cashman.
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:16.500]  You can see that right there.
[02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:18.500]  So, Rosanne, before we go to these calls, here we are.
[02:36:18.500 --> 02:36:25.500]  I mean, we are really seeing the Great Awakening, but I don't want to be overconfident.
[02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:27.500]  How do you think the bad guys are going to strike back?
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:29.500]  Strike back?
[02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:31.500]  Is that what you're asking?
[02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:32.500]  I mean, they never give up.
[02:36:32.500 --> 02:36:33.500]  Yeah.
[02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:36.500]  I mean, what is your concern of how they're going to throw a curveball at us?
[02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:41.500]  Well, I think they have horrible things up their sleeve.
[02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:45.500]  I had a dream in 2000, which I reported.
[02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:47.500]  You know, I always have dreams that come true.
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:51.500]  You know, you're kind of prescient, and you see the future too, Alex,
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:53.500]  because you're filled with the Spirit of God.
[02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:56.500]  You're a man of God, and that's why I love you, Alex.
[02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:57.500]  I told you that before.
[02:36:57.500 --> 02:37:00.500]  But I have dreams, and then they come true too.
[02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:06.500]  But I saw something horrible in 2000 in a dream, and I reported it to the FBI,
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:10.500]  because, I don't know, I didn't know who else to report it to, and nothing was done.
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:12.500]  And, of course, it happened.
[02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:13.500]  I'm not going to go into it.
[02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:24.500]  And I think it's – I think they got – I think they want to – now I'm shaking.
[02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:29.500]  I think they want to use horrible weapons against the American people.
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:36.500]  I think they want to do something horrible to the American people here.
[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:37.500]  I think that's why –
[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:38.500]  I think they already have.
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:40.500]  It was a shot, but they're planning even more.
[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:46.500]  That's why they're trying to force – trying to back Putin into a corner
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:50.500]  so that he uses the big one against us.
[02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:55.500]  But I don't think he will because he believes in God too, he says.
[02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:56.500]  I think you're right.
[02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:57.500]  They're trying to get us in a nuclear war.
[02:37:57.500 --> 02:38:00.500]  Yeah, I do think that that's what they got up their sleeve.
[02:38:00.500 --> 02:38:05.500]  But luckily for us, Trump locked down Cheyenne Mountain.
[02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:07.500]  And, you know, I know a lot of people, Alex.
[02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:12.500]  I talk to a lot of people, and they said Trump locked down the nuclear codes in Cheyenne Mountain
[02:38:12.500 --> 02:38:15.500]  because he knew that that's what they had up their sleeve.
[02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:19.500]  So, you know, I don't think that God's going to allow them to do that.
[02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:22.500]  And, you know, the Bible says – I'm just telling people this.
[02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:28.500]  The Bible says that the end of the era of Rob is coming and that they will be finished by 2025,
[02:38:28.500 --> 02:38:30.500]  and that's what I pray for.
[02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:32.500]  I pray that these evil people are done.
[02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:35.500]  And I think that they are done and that they know they're done,
[02:38:35.500 --> 02:38:42.500]  and their desperation is a horrifying thing for us because what will they do now that they know they're done?
[02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:43.500]  I don't know.
[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:44.500]  I totally agree.
[02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:45.500]  Let's take some calls.
[02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:47.500]  Tito in California, you're on the air with Roseanne Barr.
[02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:49.500]  Thanks, Tito.
[02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:50.500]  Hello, hello.
[02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:51.500]  Nice to meet you guys.
[02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:52.500]  It's a pleasure.
[02:38:52.500 --> 02:38:55.500]  I was born in Nicaragua and I came here as a little kid.
[02:38:56.500 --> 02:39:05.500]  I was a dictatorship socialist country, so I'm always trying to educate my Latino community on the traits that I'm seeing here in the United States of America.
[02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:06.500]  I love this country.
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:08.500]  I would die for this country.
[02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:14.500]  And, Roseanne, I just want to say thank you for all you're doing because it's hard for me to continue this battle
[02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:20.500]  because I get called a sellout and things like that, you know, because I used to be a Democrat and now I'm a Republican.
[02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:23.500]  And I'm a part of a group called LegZit.
[02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:25.500]  And, you know, it's a hard battle.
[02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:28.500]  But hearing you, it makes me continue to continue going forward.
[02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:30.500]  And I just want to say thank you for that.
[02:39:30.500 --> 02:39:31.500]  God bless you for telling me that.
[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:33.500]  You give me so much strength by telling me that.
[02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:35.500]  God bless you, my brother.
[02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:37.500]  Thank you.
[02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:43.500]  Yeah, and look, Latinos, not Republicans or Republicans, but they're better than Democrats, are like 30, 40 percent voting Republicans.
[02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:47.500]  So you're not alone, brother, people sitting there being mean to you because you're getting off the plantation.
[02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:50.500]  Everybody's in the process of waking up at one stage or another.
[02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:51.500]  So thank you so much, Tito.
[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:54.500]  Let's go to Alvin in Texas to talk to Roseanne Barr.
[02:39:54.500 --> 02:39:55.500]  Go ahead, Alvin.
[02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:57.500]  Thanks for calling.
[02:39:57.500 --> 02:39:58.500]  Hey.
[02:39:58.500 --> 02:40:06.500]  So, Roseanne, I wanted to know how hopefully you can tell the folks why you chose, instead of going on mass media, you know,
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:14.500]  like MSNBC or Fox or any other show, to defend yourself from what was clearly sarcasm,
[02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:18.500]  though clumsy, what you said on C.O. Vaughn.
[02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:19.500]  It wasn't clumsy.
[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:20.500]  It was brilliant.
[02:40:20.500 --> 02:40:22.500]  Excuse me.
[02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:31.500]  Anyhow, why why you would choose to go on a show where a guy like Alex Jones frequently platforms anti-Semites like E.
[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:36.500]  Michael Jones or Nick Fuentes or, you know, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:39.500]  And these guys, these guys have publicly.
[02:40:39.500 --> 02:40:42.500]  And it doesn't make any sense.
[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:46.500]  It does with the context I brought today, which is about Arab Rob.
[02:40:46.500 --> 02:40:48.500]  It does make sense.
[02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:50.500]  And, you know, it does make sense.
[02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:53.500]  And I want you to listen to what I said about Arab Rob.
[02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:56.500]  And that is different from Jews.
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:40:57.500]  So don't mix them up.
[02:40:57.500 --> 02:40:58.500]  Sure.
[02:40:58.500 --> 02:41:01.500]  Well, let me since he brought me in here, Roseanne, let me respond to Alvin.
[02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:03.500]  Alvin, nice try with your seminar call.
[02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:04.500]  Ridiculous.
[02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:07.500]  I don't agree with a lot of what Nick Fuentes says.
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:09.500]  I don't even know who he is.
[02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:10.500]  He's an interesting guy.
[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:12.500]  But the point is, same thing with you.
[02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:17.500]  So you guys, the point is, we're going to there are two genders.
[02:41:17.500 --> 02:41:19.500]  There are X and Y chromosomes.
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:21.500]  OK, now that's a fact.
[02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:23.500]  But I can have lunatics on effect like Tucker Carlson used to do.
[02:41:23.500 --> 02:41:25.500]  He used to get liberals on.
[02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:26.500]  It was super informative.
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:27.500]  I wish leftists would come on my show.
[02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:29.500]  So I've had communists on.
[02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:31.500]  I've had Nazis on.
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:36.500]  I've had transgender, you know, pedo promoters on to show how bad they are.
[02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:42.500]  So the idea that you want to police my show and call somebody, try to say, don't go on here.
[02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:45.500]  It's, quote, anti-Semitic.
[02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:46.500]  It's just preposterous.
[02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:47.500]  A, it's not true.
[02:41:47.500 --> 02:41:52.500]  B, your tactic as a leftist, trying to control discourse.
[02:41:52.500 --> 02:42:00.500]  As if NBC or any of them shows that have me on or that I would go on there when they help poison America.
[02:42:00.500 --> 02:42:03.500]  They would interview you for an hour and put 30 seconds out.
[02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:06.500]  You come here because you know it's big and we're friends and I'm not going to censor you.
[02:42:06.500 --> 02:42:12.500]  Well, because American people listen to you, Alex, and they don't listen to NBC and all their lies.
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:18.500]  I mean, they helped steal the election and they helped put people in rest homes to die.
[02:42:18.500 --> 02:42:19.500]  That's why I don't go on there.
[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:22.500]  Simply incredible.
[02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:26.500]  And they called me a racist as well and tried to, you know, kill me.
[02:42:26.500 --> 02:42:27.500]  That's why.
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:29.500]  Thanks, though.
[02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:30.500]  Have a nice day.
[02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:35.500]  Yeah, but it's just they always want to get, they always want to control information.
[02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:38.500]  They always, these leftists have the same idiotic tactics.
[02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:43.500]  Did you say anything about BDS, State Department's BDS, by the way?
[02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:45.500]  I'm familiar with that.
[02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:46.500]  No, him.
[02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:47.500]  I'm talking to the guy.
[02:42:47.500 --> 02:42:49.500]  He hadn't said shit about it.
[02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:51.500]  Did you say shit about it?
[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:54.500]  Am I still on?
[02:42:54.500 --> 02:42:55.500]  I don't know.
[02:42:55.500 --> 02:42:56.500]  Yeah, you are.
[02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:58.500]  Hey, guys, answer the question.
[02:42:58.500 --> 02:43:00.500]  Oh, I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:01.500]  Of course you don't.
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:03.500]  So don't talk about anti-Semitism.
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:05.500]  You're ill-informed and ignorant.
[02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:06.500]  Bye.
[02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:08.500]  Sorry, Alex, I'm hanging up on your guests.
[02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:09.500]  Absolutely.
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:10.500]  I agree.
[02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:12.500]  He doesn't even know about massive boycotts on Israel.
[02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:13.500]  He's an idiot.
[02:43:13.500 --> 02:43:19.500]  When you were talking about the sterilization of 8 million First Nations people here, I
[02:43:19.500 --> 02:43:25.500]  want to say, too, talking about Holocaust and sacrifice, you know that there were 50
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:32.500]  million American First Nation American Indians that were murdered by this government as well.
[02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:35.500]  That was a Holocaust on this continent.
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:39.500]  Yeah, it doesn't take away from any other Holocaust.
[02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:42.500]  No, it's a Holocaust everywhere.
[02:43:42.500 --> 02:43:48.500]  After the Holocaust in Germany, the Nazi world order, it didn't lose the war.
[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:50.500]  It continued it.
[02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:52.500]  And it went to Brazil.
[02:43:52.500 --> 02:43:58.500]  It went to South America and experimented on captive populations there, murdered them.
[02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:01.500]  It went to Indochina and did it.
[02:44:01.500 --> 02:44:06.500]  It has never ended, for Christ's sake.
[02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:09.500]  Hitler was only one branch of this system.
[02:44:09.500 --> 02:44:12.500]  Let's go to John in New Hampshire.
[02:44:12.500 --> 02:44:13.500]  Absolutely.
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:15.500]  John, you're on the air with Roseanne Barr.
[02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:16.500]  Go ahead.
[02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:17.500]  Hi, thanks.
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:24.500]  Your phone's breaking up.
[02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:26.500]  Talk right into your phone.
[02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:31.500]  Put him on hold.
[02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:33.500]  Get to a better spot, sir.
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:35.500]  Get out of whatever building you're in or get to a better spot.
[02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:36.500]  We'll go back to you.
[02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:40.500]  Roseanne, I interrupted you when you talk about the Nazi-type mindset spread.
[02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:42.500]  Start over.
[02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:43.500]  What you're saying is true.
[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:44.500]  Continue.
[02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:53.500]  What MK Ultra Nazi Mind Control Program does is create a perfect mind slave that never questions.
[02:44:53.500 --> 02:45:03.500]  It never questions its role as being made into a docile wage slave.
[02:45:03.500 --> 02:45:11.500]  And you are never allowed, your brain doesn't work so that you ever can place the blame upward.
[02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:12.500]  You're not allowed to do that.
[02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:14.500]  That's what Mind Control does.
[02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:21.500]  It makes you place the blame laterally or downward so that you can feel smug and self-righteous.
[02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:22.500]  That's what it does to you.
[02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:24.500]  That's how it controls your mind.
[02:45:24.500 --> 02:45:33.500]  But it never allows you to place the blame upward where it belongs.
[02:45:33.500 --> 02:45:34.500]  Absolutely.
[02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:35.500]  Absolutely on target.
[02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:37.500]  Let's get another caller in here.
[02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:42.500]  Let's go to William in North Carolina on the Affirmative Action Supreme Court ruling.
[02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:44.500]  He has a question or comment for Roseanne Barr.
[02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:45.500]  Go ahead.
[02:45:45.500 --> 02:45:46.500]  Hi.
[02:45:46.500 --> 02:45:47.500]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:48.500]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:49.500]  Go ahead.
[02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:50.500]  All right.
[02:45:50.500 --> 02:45:56.500]  So real quick before I get to my call here, I just want to say to Roseanne, I just want
[02:45:56.500 --> 02:46:01.500]  to say that all of the attacks and everything that's happening to you, and you said you
[02:46:01.500 --> 02:46:06.500]  had dreams and stuff like that, I just want to say that that's because you are a recipient
[02:46:06.500 --> 02:46:11.500]  of God's grace, and I just pray, and I know you're Jewish, but I still want to pray the
[02:46:11.500 --> 02:46:16.500]  precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ upon you, and I pray that the Holy Ghost continues
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:17.500]  to enlighten you.
[02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:19.500]  And that's for you too, Alec.
[02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:20.500]  Yes.
[02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:21.500]  Thank you.
[02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:29.500]  So real quick, I just want to get your position on the Supreme Court finally getting rid of
[02:46:29.500 --> 02:46:33.500]  Affirmative Action and, you know, of course, the loving liberals freaking out about it
[02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:35.500]  because they're the real racists.
[02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:37.500]  Oh, my God, they are the real racists.
[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:38.500]  It's terrible.
[02:46:38.500 --> 02:46:42.500]  They're the real racists because they love eugenics.
[02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:46.500]  They love fake Nazi science.
[02:46:46.500 --> 02:46:51.500]  Every place where they teach that, you know, every place where they affirm that gender
[02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:59.500]  care, mutilation care, they also have big contributions from Monsanto.
[02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:01.500]  It goes hand in hand.
[02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:07.500]  And, you know, Monsanto, as well as Fauci and all this stuff, real science has a control
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:08.500]  group.
[02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:16.500]  And if you will note and study, none of this stuff about the vaccines, they have never
[02:47:16.500 --> 02:47:18.500]  used a control group ever.
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:21.500]  So that is, in fact, fake science.
[02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:29.500]  And we are under the mind control of seeing fake science as science, which is Fauci fake
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:30.500]  science.
[02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:31.500]  Absolutely.
[02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:33.500]  Specifically, though, two wrongs don't make a right.
[02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:37.500]  And race based admissions and all this is just to create more division.
[02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:40.500]  And so the Supreme Court, I think, is starting to realize that.
[02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:46.500]  You know, it really pisses me off that they take out Judge Roberts, probably the greatest
[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:48.500]  of all time.
[02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:55.500]  Supreme Court justice interprets the law of liberty for the people.
[02:47:55.500 --> 02:48:01.500]  But they say, well, he was a recipient of, you know, this this whatever it's called.
[02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:04.500]  I'm I'm blanking on it.
[02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:05.500]  Affirmative action.
[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:06.500]  Yeah.
[02:48:06.500 --> 02:48:07.500]  Affirmative action.
[02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:08.500]  And that he took it.
[02:48:08.500 --> 02:48:09.500]  He removed the ladder.
[02:48:09.500 --> 02:48:14.500]  God, that is so racist because he is a genius.
[02:48:14.500 --> 02:48:18.500]  He is a genius of law of the Constitution.
[02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:24.500]  He didn't need affirmative action to get where he went because he's a genius.
[02:48:24.500 --> 02:48:25.500]  But you know what?
[02:48:25.500 --> 02:48:29.500]  The system was so racist at that time they would have kept him out.
[02:48:29.500 --> 02:48:31.500]  But it's not like that now.
[02:48:31.500 --> 02:48:33.500]  Now it's like against merit.
[02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:38.500]  It has been turned upside down, like everything the left touches turns to shit and actually
[02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:40.500]  destroys the thing it's supposed to help.
[02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:46.500]  Like when the leftists were coming to protest against.
[02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:48.500]  Well, everything they touch turned to shit.
[02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:50.500]  Let's just say everything they touch.
[02:48:50.500 --> 02:48:51.500]  Labor rights.
[02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:53.500]  Then they end up bankrupt in the union.
[02:48:53.500 --> 02:48:55.500]  Everything they touch turns to shit.
[02:48:55.500 --> 02:49:00.500]  And I don't think it's on accident because I think they are under the fascist.
[02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:02.500]  You know, they're just fascists.
[02:49:02.500 --> 02:49:05.500]  They work hand in hand with the right wing.
[02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:07.500]  You know, it's the same bird as a left wing.
[02:49:07.500 --> 02:49:08.500]  We've only got a few minutes left.
[02:49:08.500 --> 02:49:09.500]  We'll get a few minutes left.
[02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:10.500]  We'll get more calls.
[02:49:10.500 --> 02:49:11.500]  People really want to talk to you.
[02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:13.500]  Let's talk to Alex in California.
[02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:17.500]  Right now they are engaged in destroying women's rights.
[02:49:17.500 --> 02:49:20.500]  That's how, you know, that's why they do what they do.
[02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:24.500]  They want to erase women's rights and all rape activists.
[02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:28.500]  They want to silence rape activists and get rid of all rape laws.
[02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:30.500]  That's what they're doing.
[02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:34.500]  Let's go to Alex in California, then Alex in Florida.
[02:49:34.500 --> 02:49:35.500]  Alex, you're on the air.
[02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:37.500]  You have a question for Roseanne Barr about Hollywood and Hunter Biden.
[02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:38.500]  Go ahead.
[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:39.500]  Yes.
[02:49:39.500 --> 02:49:40.500]  Hi.
[02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:44.500]  I want to know if Roseanne heard the recent story about Hunter Biden being linked to the
[02:49:44.500 --> 02:49:45.500]  satanic sex club in L.A.?
[02:49:45.500 --> 02:49:49.500]  And then I had a question for you afterwards, Alex.
[02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:54.500]  It is, Roseanne, as you see that, it's in the new whistleblower documents, that satanic
[02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:55.500]  sex clubs.
[02:49:55.500 --> 02:50:01.500]  Well, he has that tattoo on his back of whatever it's called, that place where they do all
[02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:02.500]  the sacrificing.
[02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:07.500]  He's got a tattoo on his back of that lake, whatever it is, where they do all that child
[02:50:07.500 --> 02:50:08.500]  sacrifice.
[02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:09.500]  It's tattooed into his skin.
[02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:11.500]  He's a victim.
[02:50:11.500 --> 02:50:18.500]  Like, you know, all these people that are in that club, they do it to their own kids.
[02:50:18.500 --> 02:50:22.500]  All these shooters have CIA, CIA dads.
[02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:24.500]  They do it to their children.
[02:50:24.500 --> 02:50:29.500]  That's how they create a perfect mind control victim, which is what they want, their own
[02:50:29.500 --> 02:50:30.500]  family.
[02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:31.500]  That's how they continue to.
[02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:39.500]  The CIA NASA Brain Interface Program.
[02:50:39.500 --> 02:50:41.500]  And that guy and his son was in the program.
[02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:44.500]  Theodore Kosinski, the Unabomber, was in MKUltra.
[02:50:44.500 --> 02:50:46.500]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:47.500]  Does that answer your question, Alex?
[02:50:47.500 --> 02:50:49.500]  Because you said you had another question for me.
[02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:50.500]  Yes.
[02:50:50.500 --> 02:50:55.500]  I interviewed you in 2008 about the Marines doing DUI checkpoints in California.
[02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:57.500]  And it was in your film, Police State.
[02:50:57.500 --> 02:51:00.500]  But I heard you talking recently about 9-11.
[02:51:00.500 --> 02:51:04.500]  I just want to know if you were considering writing a book about 9-11 and also Columbine
[02:51:04.500 --> 02:51:08.500]  as well, because I know there's a lot of inconsistencies and it's a crazy story with the two shooters.
[02:51:08.500 --> 02:51:10.500]  Were you considering writing books about those?
[02:51:10.500 --> 02:51:11.500]  I think it'd be really good for you.
[02:51:11.500 --> 02:51:12.500]  Yes, I was.
[02:51:12.500 --> 02:51:16.500]  And I remember doing the interview with you 12, 13, 14 years ago.
[02:51:16.500 --> 02:51:17.500]  God bless you.
[02:51:17.500 --> 02:51:18.500]  Good to hear from you, brother.
[02:51:18.500 --> 02:51:20.500]  We're almost out of time.
[02:51:20.500 --> 02:51:23.500]  The great Jay Dyer takes over Fridays in the fourth hour.
[02:51:23.500 --> 02:51:26.500]  Then the amazing Owen Troyer will take over at 3 p.m.
[02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:27.500]  Central.
[02:51:27.500 --> 02:51:29.500]  But Roseanne Barr is here.
[02:51:29.500 --> 02:51:31.500]  And she's talking about sophisticated dialectic.
[02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:33.500]  She has a way of just putting it out bluntly.
[02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:37.500]  But I agree that they have sex trafficking that they're saying is no big deal.
[02:51:37.500 --> 02:51:39.500]  They're not going to test the DNA of kids.
[02:51:39.500 --> 02:51:42.500]  They just turn over to random strangers or even ID them at the border.
[02:51:42.500 --> 02:51:43.500]  I started a month ago.
[02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:45.500]  That is to enable the trafficking.
[02:51:45.500 --> 02:51:46.500]  They admit the trafficking.
[02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:50.500]  And by having all these women come out and make fake allegations and have it come out
[02:51:50.500 --> 02:51:54.500]  that it's fake, that then delegitimizes real women that are being raped.
[02:51:54.500 --> 02:51:55.500]  And I agree.
[02:51:55.500 --> 02:51:59.500]  It's all about lowering the value of humans and legitimizing abuse.
[02:51:59.500 --> 02:52:02.500]  But you know what they're also disguising?
[02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:05.500]  Because I've been thinking about this, you know, this Epstein thing.
[02:52:05.500 --> 02:52:09.500]  Jeffrey Epstein was running the world.
[02:52:09.500 --> 02:52:11.500]  He was running the Federal Reserve.
[02:52:11.500 --> 02:52:13.500]  Think about it, Alex.
[02:52:13.500 --> 02:52:15.500]  He was in charge of the Federal Reserve.
[02:52:15.500 --> 02:52:17.500]  Wouldn't you really break it down and think about it?
[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:23.500]  He was definitely a high-level manager for the most powerful group, MI6, tied into CIA and Mossad.
[02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:25.500]  Everybody went to him to get blackmailed.
[02:52:25.500 --> 02:52:27.500]  They knew they were going to have sex with kids.
[02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:29.500]  And he was like the master manager of that.
[02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:33.500]  It's true.
[02:52:33.500 --> 02:52:35.500]  What does it mean to you that that started to come out?
[02:52:35.500 --> 02:52:37.500]  Does that show that globalists aren't all-powerful?
[02:52:37.500 --> 02:52:39.500]  What do you think?
[02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:44.500]  I think they're exposing themselves because, I say, with the power of the Internet for the first time,
[02:52:44.500 --> 02:52:52.500]  the facts of how the world really works cannot anymore be hidden from the people.
[02:52:52.500 --> 02:52:54.500]  We can have it at our fingertips, facts.
[02:52:54.500 --> 02:52:59.500]  And it's for the first time that no church or state can censor the facts from the human beings.
[02:52:59.500 --> 02:53:02.500]  And I think that that's God.
[02:53:02.500 --> 02:53:09.500]  And I think that they expose themselves, and we don't have to do anything but witness it.
[02:53:09.500 --> 02:53:15.500]  And we are witnessing history in the making, and it is indeed biblical.
[02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:23.500]  And if you have the eyes to see it and the discretion inside because you have a clean heart before your maker,
[02:53:23.500 --> 02:53:32.500]  it's absolutely fantastic, and it should strengthen your resolve and your faith.
[02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:33.500]  Absolutely, Roseanne.
[02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:37.500]  We've got unlimited callers here for you, but I know you've been on for almost two hours.
[02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:38.500]  You've done a great job.
[02:53:38.500 --> 02:53:41.500]  Let's go to the order these calls have been received.
[02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:43.500]  Let's go to Curtis in Minnesota.
[02:53:43.500 --> 02:53:44.500]  Roseanne Barr, go ahead.
[02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:46.500]  Hey, Roseanne.
[02:53:46.500 --> 02:53:47.500]  Hi.
[02:53:47.500 --> 02:53:48.500]  Hi.
[02:53:48.500 --> 02:53:50.500]  It's great that you're on the show today.
[02:53:50.500 --> 02:53:51.500]  Thank you.
[02:53:51.500 --> 02:53:53.500]  The Holy Spirit is on the move.
[02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:54.500]  Yeah.
[02:53:54.500 --> 02:53:59.500]  Alex started out with Rodney Brown and Dave Scarlett, and now you.
[02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:02.500]  It's like a grand slam for a spiritual battle.
[02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:04.500]  Alex is so great.
[02:54:04.500 --> 02:54:06.500]  Everything he's told us has happened.
[02:54:07.500 --> 02:54:13.500]  He has more credibility than anybody else who's been in front of a microphone on the public airwaves.
[02:54:13.500 --> 02:54:20.500]  He definitely does for people who are informed, but you have a lot of credibility with a lot of people that don't know anything.
[02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:25.500]  And so when they hear you, I mean, it hits home to a lot of people.
[02:54:25.500 --> 02:54:27.500]  Thank you for telling me that.
[02:54:28.500 --> 02:54:35.500]  Yeah, I wanted to lay out Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Mandela.
[02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:43.500]  They all took on the establishment, and they all had a victory using nonviolence, but then they all paid a price.
[02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:44.500]  Yeah, they did.
[02:54:44.500 --> 02:54:52.500]  And I think, yep, we've got a huge spiritual battle ahead, and the answers are biblical.
[02:54:52.500 --> 02:54:54.500]  You know, the truth will set you free.
[02:54:54.500 --> 02:54:56.500]  Alex is doing that day in and day out.
[02:54:56.500 --> 02:54:57.500]  Yep.
[02:54:57.500 --> 02:54:58.500]  Love conquers all.
[02:54:58.500 --> 02:55:00.500]  That's basic, but you know what?
[02:55:00.500 --> 02:55:01.500]  That's the weapon.
[02:55:01.500 --> 02:55:02.500]  Absolutely.
[02:55:02.500 --> 02:55:06.500]  When we have all these people sliding into this country, they're just victims, really.
[02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:07.500]  Yep.
[02:55:07.500 --> 02:55:08.500]  They're going to be here.
[02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:12.500]  When this thing melts down, people are going to have to realize that not all those people are their enemies.
[02:55:12.500 --> 02:55:13.500]  That's right.
[02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:14.500]  I remember that.
[02:55:15.500 --> 02:55:27.500]  I had a quick T-shirt idea for Alex, globalist solutions, and then list off the truth will set you free and love conquers all.
[02:55:27.500 --> 02:55:32.500]  And info wars, we might have to start calling it spiritual wars, because this thing is really spiritual.
[02:55:32.500 --> 02:55:34.500]  It is a war, that's for damn sure.
[02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:38.500]  And people have the memory of a goldfish.
[02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:44.500]  Instead of the love thing, which, of course, love is, you know, the greatest thing in the world.
[02:55:44.500 --> 02:55:50.500]  The universe is made of love and God is love and God made his creation from love.
[02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:54.500]  But I think we should cue into some hate of evil right now.
[02:55:54.500 --> 02:56:05.500]  Hatred of evil, because hatred is, you know, a huge motivating thing for the human being, especially when they hate evil and hate the devil.
[02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:07.500]  Hate for a while.
[02:56:07.500 --> 02:56:09.500]  Stop loving everything.
[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:14.500]  Focus in on hating evil and see how fast shit changes.
[02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:16.500]  I swear to God, it's true.
[02:56:16.500 --> 02:56:18.500]  Curtis, thank you so much.
[02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:20.500]  Look, Roseanne's got to go.
[02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:24.500]  We've got Jay and we've got a bunch of other callers here, and I'm sorry I didn't get to you.
[02:56:24.500 --> 02:56:26.500]  Jay and I are going to take over.
[02:56:26.500 --> 02:56:28.500]  We've got some closing comments, but thank you for coming in to clarify.
[02:56:28.500 --> 02:56:31.500]  I know you did it on the show you were on, Theo Vaughn.
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:33.500]  They're going to take this out of context again.
[02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:34.500]  It's what they do.
[02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:48.500]  I prayed with you, Alex, and I'm going to ask God to protect me and you and everybody who's hearing us, that he will not let them come at us.
[02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:53.500]  Because as we're promised, any weapon formed against us will not harm us.
[02:56:53.500 --> 02:56:57.500]  And so far, I'm still standing, no matter what they've done to me.
[02:56:57.500 --> 02:57:00.500]  And they've done more than anybody knows, because I haven't talked about it.
[02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:02.500]  But they've done a lot.
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:06.500]  And here I am, still standing, looking good, and feeling good, too.
[02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:17.500]  But I'm going to pray that for all that are hearing us and watching us and all who are open to it, that God will put his arms around us,
[02:57:17.500 --> 02:57:27.500]  and he will protect us and strengthen us and bring us together so that we can figure this out and make it better for all the children in this world.
[02:57:28.500 --> 02:57:33.500]  And we just thank him so much that we're able to do this.
[02:57:33.500 --> 02:57:41.500]  I mean, this has never happened before in history, that we have access to each other and the freedom of these airwaves.
[02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:43.500]  This is the renaissance, brother.
[02:57:43.500 --> 02:57:45.500]  Two minutes. Come right back. Five more minutes.
[02:57:47.500 --> 02:57:49.500]  InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:53.500]  And so, please, go to InfoWars.org and just make a donation.
[02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:55.500]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[02:57:55.500 --> 02:57:57.500]  You have a little profile there, cancel anytime.
[02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:06.500]  Every 15 days, every month, every three months, every six months, up to nine months, you can go in and every month or every week,
[02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:07.500]  whenever you want, you program it.
[02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:10.500]  You just click it, and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[02:58:10.500 --> 02:58:11.500]  So please do that as well.
[02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:16.500]  That way, we get 95 percent of it after credit card fees, instead of making 20, 30, 40 percent like we do on the products.
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:18.500]  But these really are amazing products.
[02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:20.500]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[02:58:20.500 --> 02:58:23.500]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:58:23.500 --> 02:58:25.500]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:26.500]  People are listening more than ever.
[02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:31.500]  But in this major recession, going into depression, and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:32.500]  I know times are tough.
[02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:34.500]  So thank you for your support.
[02:58:34.500 --> 02:58:37.500]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:39.500]  That you can do for free.
[02:58:39.500 --> 02:58:41.500]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[02:58:41.500 --> 02:58:44.500]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[02:58:44.500 --> 02:58:46.500]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:58:46.500 --> 02:58:47.500]  God bless you.
[02:58:47.500 --> 02:58:51.500]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[02:58:51.500 --> 02:58:56.500]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarstore.com.
[02:58:56.500 --> 02:59:02.500]  They are both clones of national bestselling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker
[02:59:02.500 --> 02:59:04.500]  that are listeners and patriots.
[02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:08.500]  They're allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[02:59:08.500 --> 02:59:12.500]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[02:59:12.500 --> 02:59:17.500]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain.
[02:59:18.500 --> 02:59:23.500]  And to also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated
[02:59:23.500 --> 02:59:25.500]  and are more inductive to pain.
[02:59:25.500 --> 02:59:28.500]  There's major research behind this all.
[02:59:28.500 --> 02:59:34.500]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWars MD and Nerve Renew from InfoWars MD
[02:59:34.500 --> 02:59:38.500]  exclusively at InfoWarstore.com right now.
[02:59:38.500 --> 02:59:40.500]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[02:59:40.500 --> 02:59:43.500]  You'll find them exclusively at InfoWarstore.com.
[02:59:43.500 --> 02:59:45.500]  And they fund their operation.
[02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:55.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:56.700 --> 03:00:13.020]  This is our final segment, the final segment with Roseanne Barr in studio.
[03:00:13.020 --> 03:00:17.620]  I'll be back in Austin, Texas here in the next day or so, back in studio for as long
[03:00:17.620 --> 03:00:18.700]  as you allow us to be here.
[03:00:18.700 --> 03:00:19.700]  We are under enemy attack.
[03:00:19.700 --> 03:00:22.220]  We're only here by the grace of God and your support.
[03:00:22.220 --> 03:00:26.220]  Roseanne, you got caught up on that hard break, can't stop the end-of-the-hour satellite break.
[03:00:26.220 --> 03:00:27.220]  It cuts hard.
[03:00:27.220 --> 03:00:31.380]  You were saying a prayer and trying to get people to realize how important historically
[03:00:31.380 --> 03:00:35.060]  the moment is that we have independent media still, despite all the attacks, despite the
[03:00:35.060 --> 03:00:36.780]  surveillance and censorship.
[03:00:36.780 --> 03:00:39.940]  This really is something precious, so you left off there.
[03:00:39.940 --> 03:00:41.900]  Please finish your important thoughts.
[03:00:41.900 --> 03:00:47.140]  Well, you know, I said this is the real renaissance.
[03:00:47.140 --> 03:00:54.420]  This is the time where we have the truth on our side and nobody can stop it.
[03:00:54.420 --> 03:01:01.580]  It's just the beauty that is going to come forth because of you, because of you supporting
[03:01:01.580 --> 03:01:03.980]  truth, you out there.
[03:01:03.980 --> 03:01:09.020]  It's just going to go and it's going to get bigger and bigger and it's just wonderful.
[03:01:09.020 --> 03:01:10.380]  Be part of it.
[03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:12.140]  Be part of it.
[03:01:12.140 --> 03:01:16.300]  Open your eyes, open your soul, open your ears and be part of it.
[03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:17.300]  Don't be afraid.
[03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:21.900]  Don't be afraid to leave Babylon.
[03:01:21.900 --> 03:01:24.420]  Let it fall.
[03:01:24.420 --> 03:01:25.420]  Let Babylon fall.
[03:01:25.420 --> 03:01:26.420]  Wow.
[03:01:26.420 --> 03:01:27.420]  Beautifully said.
[03:01:27.420 --> 03:01:28.420]  RosanneBarr.com.
[03:01:28.420 --> 03:01:30.060]  People can find your show dates there.
[03:01:30.060 --> 03:01:32.980]  They can find your podcast, RosanneBarr.com.
[03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:36.700]  Rosanne, just for a moment, we've got anything else you want to add that you haven't added
[03:01:36.700 --> 03:01:39.580]  and we'll let you get back to your ranch.
[03:01:39.580 --> 03:01:55.540]  Well, I just want to thank everybody for giving me so much love and support.
[03:01:55.540 --> 03:01:58.580]  I just am filled up with it.
[03:01:58.580 --> 03:02:00.660]  I just thank you.
[03:02:00.660 --> 03:02:01.660]  Love you back.
[03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:04.940]  I want to say the same thing to our audience, same thing to them.
[03:02:04.940 --> 03:02:05.940]  We're all in this together.
[03:02:05.940 --> 03:02:06.940]  It's beautiful.
[03:02:06.940 --> 03:02:07.940]  Every race, color and creed.
[03:02:07.940 --> 03:02:08.940]  I'll keep on too.
[03:02:09.300 --> 03:02:10.300]  I love you, Alex.
[03:02:10.300 --> 03:02:17.660]  I'm going to keep fighting and you give me some soul energy and I just thank you so much
[03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:18.660]  for it.
[03:02:18.660 --> 03:02:22.620]  I was lonely for so long and I just thank your audience.
[03:02:22.620 --> 03:02:23.620]  Thank you.
[03:02:23.620 --> 03:02:25.620]  I'm not lonely no more.
[03:02:25.620 --> 03:02:26.620]  Wow.
[03:02:26.620 --> 03:02:31.740]  Rosanne Barr, thank you for coming in and knocking it out of the park and exposing how they totally
[03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:36.060]  misrepresented what you said again because they are of their father, the devil.
[03:02:36.060 --> 03:02:37.060]  They are liars.
[03:02:37.060 --> 03:02:38.060]  Thank you, Rosanne Barr.
[03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:39.180]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:02:39.180 --> 03:02:40.180]  Bye, Alex.
[03:02:40.180 --> 03:02:41.180]  All right.
[03:02:41.180 --> 03:02:42.180]  Thank you.
[03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:43.180]  Wow.
[03:02:43.180 --> 03:02:44.180]  Incredible.
[03:02:44.180 --> 03:02:50.100]  And you heard the truth there and now you'll see the total lies like Jones joins her in
[03:02:50.100 --> 03:02:51.100]  loving Hitler.
[03:02:51.100 --> 03:02:55.260]  Jones wore a swastika shirt and said, you know, kill all the Jews.
[03:02:55.260 --> 03:02:57.020]  That's what they're going to say.
[03:02:57.020 --> 03:02:58.020]  Because they're the bad guys.
[03:02:58.020 --> 03:03:02.020]  They're the globalists and they can't stop lying.
[03:03:02.020 --> 03:03:05.660]  They can't stop stealing and they can't stop pillaging.
[03:03:05.660 --> 03:03:07.420]  But we've got to stop them, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:07.780 --> 03:03:12.820]  So we're going to go on a break and the great Jay Dyer, always loaded for bear, is going
[03:03:12.820 --> 03:03:18.620]  to take over the source documents of the New World Order and how they operate and how to
[03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:19.940]  stop them.
[03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:20.940]  Always informative.
[03:03:20.940 --> 03:03:27.260]  Then in an hour from now, or technically in about 56 minutes from now, the amazing Owen
[03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:32.300]  Schroyer will take over at 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:35.780]  And Owen's a great mind, great friend of mine, and he's gone through so much to promote liberty.
[03:03:35.780 --> 03:03:39.460]  So please join him and share clips of the show.
[03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:43.620]  And Harrison Smith and the entire crew and everything we do is only thanks to you.
[03:03:43.620 --> 03:03:45.100]  So thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[03:03:45.100 --> 03:03:48.780]  When you call in and thank me all day, I say, listen, thanks for thanking me.
[03:03:48.780 --> 03:03:51.980]  But will you please go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a great product.

[03:04:07.060 --> 03:04:10.660]  But please, God loves to keep me humble, man.
[03:04:10.660 --> 03:04:12.940]  Always right here on the edge of not being able to operate.
[03:04:12.940 --> 03:04:13.940]  I love the crew.
[03:04:13.940 --> 03:04:14.940]  I love the work we're doing.
[03:04:14.940 --> 03:04:15.940]  I love our archives.
[03:04:15.940 --> 03:04:17.660]  I love all the synergy we've got.
[03:04:17.660 --> 03:04:21.700]  We're really hitting on all cylinders, but God just keeps you right there at the verge
[03:04:21.700 --> 03:04:22.700]  of collapse.
[03:04:22.700 --> 03:04:23.700]  So just let me know.
[03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:24.700]  God's in control.
[03:04:24.700 --> 03:04:27.300]  But it's really God working through you that's in control.
[03:04:27.300 --> 03:04:28.300]  You're in control.
[03:04:28.300 --> 03:04:31.180]  You can pull the plug on this operation, or you can let us fly together and defeat the
[03:04:31.180 --> 03:04:32.180]  new world order.
[03:04:32.180 --> 03:04:36.740]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get great products, books, films, t-shirts, you name
[03:04:36.740 --> 03:04:38.540]  it, or just make a donation or both.

[03:04:43.260 --> 03:04:46.820]  cancelling time for free, InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:04:46.820 --> 03:04:47.820]  Take action.
[03:04:47.820 --> 03:04:48.820]  Make the decision.
[03:04:48.820 --> 03:04:49.820]  So many of you have done it.
[03:04:49.820 --> 03:04:50.820]  That's why we're changing the world.
[03:04:50.820 --> 03:04:54.340]  Now, if others will just jump on board, we're going to come in for the big win.
[03:04:54.340 --> 03:04:55.340]  God bless you all.
[03:04:55.340 --> 03:04:58.860]  Jay Dyer takes over now.
[03:04:58.860 --> 03:05:03.780]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire
[03:05:03.780 --> 03:05:05.620]  food supply.
[03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:10.260]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:05:10.260 --> 03:05:14.460]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:05:14.460 --> 03:05:17.280]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:20.620]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:05:20.620 --> 03:05:25.820]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:05:25.820 --> 03:05:29.100]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:05:29.100 --> 03:05:35.220]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[03:05:35.220 --> 03:05:39.500]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:05:39.500 --> 03:05:45.340]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands-down the best.
[03:05:45.340 --> 03:05:51.500]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[03:05:51.500 --> 03:05:57.500]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:57.500 --> 03:06:05.500]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:05.500 --> 03:06:09.460]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jason Alsace, and I'm here with Jamie Henshaw, and we're
[03:06:09.460 --> 03:06:15.100]  going to be talking about the hottest growing religion out there, and that's appropriate
[03:06:15.100 --> 03:06:21.340]  because we cover cults, mind control, alternative religions, sex and groups all the time because
[03:06:21.340 --> 03:06:26.460]  those are often used by the power elite to steer us into a new direction.
[03:06:26.460 --> 03:06:30.860]  Even antinatalism from Extinction Rebellion, the Green Agenda, all those things are kind
[03:06:30.860 --> 03:06:35.260]  of bound up with the new age, with worshiping Gaia.
[03:06:35.260 --> 03:06:39.580]  And one of those recent religions, and I say recent because we're going to find out the
[03:06:39.580 --> 03:06:45.940]  real history of Wicca and many of the offshoots of goddess worship and whatnot, they're not
[03:06:45.940 --> 03:06:46.940]  actually that old.
[03:06:46.940 --> 03:06:49.940]  I'm not saying that there weren't ancient witches.
[03:06:49.940 --> 03:06:56.220]  There were, but ancient and medieval witchcraft doesn't really have a connection to today's
[03:06:56.220 --> 03:07:02.940]  religious movements known as Wicca and the so-called traditional witchcraft movements.
[03:07:02.940 --> 03:07:07.980]  What I want to talk about is their real origins and the sociocultural impacts that they have.
[03:07:07.980 --> 03:07:12.540]  If you go and you read about rising religions, religious trends, you'll find out that especially
[03:07:12.540 --> 03:07:18.420]  amongst Zoomers and even millennials, the fastest growing religion, supposedly according
[03:07:18.420 --> 03:07:21.940]  to the mainstream media, is witchcraft and Wicca.
[03:07:21.940 --> 03:07:29.380]  And it's, I think, tied into the decline of patriarchy and the rise of feminism in a society
[03:07:29.380 --> 03:07:35.040]  that's geared more and more towards what we might call feminine ideas or equalitarianism.
[03:07:35.040 --> 03:07:41.900]  So the loss of the patriarchy or the loss of the father archetype goes along with the
[03:07:41.900 --> 03:07:49.060]  loss of order, structure, logos, and the rise of the feminine or the rise of the goddess.
[03:07:49.060 --> 03:07:51.060]  And that, I think, is not accidental.
[03:07:51.060 --> 03:07:52.460]  I think it's by design.
[03:07:52.460 --> 03:07:57.500]  So we're going to get Jamie to give us some insights on the history and the rise of witchcraft.
[03:07:57.500 --> 03:08:02.780]  Well, we're going to do Defense Against the Dark Arts class today.
[03:08:02.780 --> 03:08:08.780]  And well, because we've studied a lot, along with Wicca, we've also studied Rosicrucian,
[03:08:08.780 --> 03:08:14.060]  Manly P. Hall, Emerald Tablets, Philosophical Research Society.
[03:08:14.060 --> 03:08:15.060]  What else?
[03:08:15.060 --> 03:08:16.060]  Hermetics.
[03:08:16.060 --> 03:08:17.060]  Just all of that.
[03:08:17.060 --> 03:08:18.060]  Yeah.
[03:08:18.060 --> 03:08:19.060]  Neoplatonism, alchemy, all that.
[03:08:19.060 --> 03:08:20.060]  Right.
[03:08:20.060 --> 03:08:22.660]  Freemasonry, Egyptology, Golan Don OTO.
[03:08:22.660 --> 03:08:28.700]  And all of these things have roots in the same ideologies.
[03:08:28.700 --> 03:08:35.700]  And we are going to show today that the newest trend is going to be witchcore, I think.
[03:08:35.700 --> 03:08:36.700]  What do you think?
[03:08:36.700 --> 03:08:42.140]  Well, if you go on TikTok, the hottest videos don't have anything to do with anything based
[03:08:42.140 --> 03:08:43.140]  in reality.
[03:08:43.140 --> 03:08:46.020]  It's what crystals give you sex energy.
[03:08:46.020 --> 03:08:50.220]  So this is what all the people who are 17, 18, 19 are watching, especially women.
[03:08:50.220 --> 03:08:53.660]  They're getting into their crystals and getting sex power from crystals.
[03:08:53.660 --> 03:08:58.700]  So that's what everybody who's 25 and under is watching on social media.
[03:08:58.700 --> 03:08:59.700]  Yeah.
[03:08:59.700 --> 03:09:05.580]  So 10 years ago, I wrote a book about princess programming, and all of that stuff came true.
[03:09:05.580 --> 03:09:07.740]  I linked that to androgyny.
[03:09:07.740 --> 03:09:09.820]  All that stuff came true.
[03:09:09.820 --> 03:09:15.820]  And now we are going to be seeing the rise of your traditional classic witch, along with
[03:09:15.820 --> 03:09:19.380]  the aesthetic of ugliness is going to be rolled into that.
[03:09:19.380 --> 03:09:24.540]  Well, that's relevant because the archetype of the witch is the hag, right?
[03:09:24.540 --> 03:09:31.100]  And the old hag who's childless, barren, sterile, and there's the notions of she consumes the
[03:09:31.100 --> 03:09:32.800]  children in some way.
[03:09:32.800 --> 03:09:37.920]  And those myths, those stories have a basis in reality because I did an interview with
[03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:42.200]  a professor this week on my channel, and we were talking about, he did a history of witchcraft
[03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:45.000]  from a biological and sociological perspective.
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:48.280]  And he was talking about how this is really the predecessor to modern feminism and to
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:54.960]  abortion is what witches were doing in the 15th, 16th century.
[03:09:54.960 --> 03:09:59.800]  And also we are going to link it to the music industry and the fashion industry.
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:03.960]  And they say that fashion is the witch's greatest friend.
[03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:09.800]  And we saw all of that play out with the Balenciaga scandals and the people that were linked to
[03:10:09.800 --> 03:10:10.800]  that.
[03:10:10.800 --> 03:10:15.760]  So you're going to be seeing more of this come out in fashion, goat's heads, blood,
[03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:18.640]  bodily fluids, nasty things, even more.
[03:10:18.640 --> 03:10:19.640]  Well, Target, right?
[03:10:19.640 --> 03:10:21.320]  Just did a bunch of those, right?
[03:10:21.320 --> 03:10:22.320]  Yes.
[03:10:22.320 --> 03:10:27.000]  And we'll get into Target deeply when we get to the end and the point of what we're making
[03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:28.000]  in the show.
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  Okay.
[03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:33.080]  So it's going to be gore.
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:34.080]  It's going to be-
[03:10:34.080 --> 03:10:35.080]  What's going to be gore?
[03:10:35.080 --> 03:10:36.080]  The fashion trends.
[03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:37.080]  Of the future.
[03:10:37.080 --> 03:10:38.080]  The coming fashion trends?
[03:10:38.080 --> 03:10:39.080]  Yes.
[03:10:39.080 --> 03:10:40.080]  Okay.
[03:10:40.080 --> 03:10:41.080]  We're predicting coming fashion trends.
[03:10:41.080 --> 03:10:42.080]  Witchcore, gore, goat's heads, androgyny.
[03:10:42.080 --> 03:10:43.080]  But isn't it already here?
[03:10:43.080 --> 03:10:44.080]  It is, but-
[03:10:44.080 --> 03:10:48.400]  Are you saying it's going to get more popular?
[03:10:48.400 --> 03:10:51.160]  You're going to be seeing it more and more.
[03:10:51.160 --> 03:10:52.160]  Okay.
[03:10:52.160 --> 03:10:53.920]  So right now it's in the high fashion world.
[03:10:53.920 --> 03:10:56.040]  It's in elite Hollywood.
[03:10:56.040 --> 03:10:57.400]  It's at Met Gala.
[03:10:57.400 --> 03:11:00.000]  But now it's at Target.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  Now it spills down.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:02.000]  Exactly.
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:07.480]  It trickles down to Target and it's going to be in the lower levels of culture very
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:08.480]  soon.
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:14.080]  Your little niece is going to be wearing a pointy hat and riding a broomstick for fashion
[03:11:14.080 --> 03:11:15.080]  reasons.
[03:11:15.080 --> 03:11:18.880]  Well, and Harry Potter kind of was a big part of making this popular.
[03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:22.840]  I mean, I know that was just kind of young adult fiction, but what I'm saying is that
[03:11:22.840 --> 03:11:25.040]  it really opened the gate.
[03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:29.520]  Even at that time, I remember reading that a lot of the occult societies and secret societies
[03:11:29.520 --> 03:11:35.280]  were actually thanking JK Rowling for opening up a lot of people to the possibilities of
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:38.520]  getting into witchcraft, especially that younger generation.
[03:11:38.520 --> 03:11:42.640]  So do you remember that 1993 Disney movie, Hocus Pocus?
[03:11:42.640 --> 03:11:43.640]  Yes.
[03:11:43.640 --> 03:11:50.280]  And in the original movie, it was the three children who defeated the evil witches who
[03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:53.040]  were trying to steal their life force, their adrenochrome, their essence.
[03:11:53.040 --> 03:11:54.040]  Yes.
[03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:55.600]  They're kind of still in the essence of the young.
[03:11:55.600 --> 03:11:56.600]  Yes.
[03:11:56.600 --> 03:12:02.360]  And so the sequel came out in 2022 and the entire narrative is kind of skewed in a way
[03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:06.680]  because it was very different where the witch sisters returned to the future.
[03:12:06.680 --> 03:12:12.520]  They're local heroes now, and they're emulated by the townspeople and all of the townspeople
[03:12:12.520 --> 03:12:15.400]  dress up as them and portray them in the talent competition.
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:16.400]  Yeah.
[03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:21.000]  And the new Hocus Pocus witchcraft is not normalized and it surprises the witches when they come
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  back.
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  Right.
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:30.160]  And the three teen girls in Hocus Pocus, too, have to empathize with the witches and carry
[03:12:30.160 --> 03:12:32.440]  on their traditions instead of defeating them.
[03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:33.440]  Right.
[03:12:33.440 --> 03:12:34.440]  Right.
[03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:35.440]  Yeah.
[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:38.920]  And of course, Disney, too, had a huge role in the last 20, 30 years of pushing witchcraft,
[03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:45.160]  too, because a lot of this, you'll notice, it comes along with a bunch of other cultural
[03:12:45.160 --> 03:12:51.560]  engineering, culture steering, which I think comes out of Tavistock and a lot of that comes
[03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:56.120]  out of Stanford Research, and that's tied to the gender stuff, right?
[03:12:56.120 --> 03:13:02.240]  So the idea that there are these mystical transcendent forces that we can tap into and
[03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:07.960]  magically become anything we want to become, magical thinking, that's essentially postmodernism.
[03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:13.480]  So the philosophical ideologies of postmodernism are often connected to these new religious
[03:13:13.480 --> 03:13:16.640]  movements and the idea of magical thinking.
[03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:21.000]  So since you mentioned Disney, let's look at what the kids are watching, a new show
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:22.000]  called Pauline.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:26.480]  Pauline is a typical teenager struggling to balance school with thoughts about crumbling
[03:13:26.480 --> 03:13:29.680]  society and the ongoing climate crisis.
[03:13:29.680 --> 03:13:33.320]  Things get more complicated when she becomes pregnant after a one-night stand with a boy
[03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:36.440]  named Lucas, who just happens to be Satan.
[03:13:36.440 --> 03:13:38.640]  Pauline follows the pair's complicated love story.
[03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:43.240]  So this is coming out on Disney Plus for little kids.
[03:13:43.240 --> 03:13:48.680]  There's also a cartoon that is an FX show on Disney Plus called Little Demon 2022.
[03:13:48.680 --> 03:13:54.480]  Well, they were putting, I mean, they were putting Crowley in themes in cartoons, you
[03:13:54.480 --> 03:13:59.200]  know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, like literal Crowley phrases.
[03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:07.320]  So Little Demon is about a girl whose mom got impregnated by Satan and tried to unalive
[03:14:07.320 --> 03:14:13.120]  her at birth, but then she saw that the baby was a girl and decided to keep it.
[03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:17.320]  And so now Satan is the absentee father trying to get his daughter back.
[03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:23.520]  And the mom is a Baphomet character and has tattoos all over her and is very, like, muscular
[03:14:23.520 --> 03:14:25.200]  like a man, but with breasts.
[03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:31.680]  And there's actually a scene where the mom gets naked and does a cartoon version, does
[03:14:31.680 --> 03:14:36.080]  a spell to go to the other side, and she looks exactly like Baphomet.
[03:14:36.080 --> 03:14:45.480]  Well, Baphomet is a image that conjures up a transcendence of biology and gender, right?
[03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:51.440]  So it has both genders because the idea in a lot of the alchemical and neoplatonic tradition
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:55.280]  is that there's a higher status that we all kind of fell from.
[03:14:55.280 --> 03:15:00.520]  And so there was a point at some, you know, primeval stage or some golden era where we
[03:15:00.520 --> 03:15:03.000]  were above man and woman.
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:08.120]  We were something higher, some being that had either both genders or no gender, right?
[03:15:08.120 --> 03:15:16.040]  And so falling into genderhood, a lot of the neoplatonic idea, then put us into this
[03:15:16.040 --> 03:15:22.080]  situation where man's problems, humanity's problems result from being different.
[03:15:22.080 --> 03:15:28.120]  And so if we can make everything kind of unique and the same, excuse me, if we can get rid
[03:15:28.120 --> 03:15:32.880]  of everything being unique and make everything kind of homogenized, then we could get rid
[03:15:32.880 --> 03:15:37.200]  of all the battles and the warfare and the distinctions that we have, right?
[03:15:37.280 --> 03:15:41.760]  And I think masculinity is what causes, you know, society to go to war.
[03:15:41.760 --> 03:15:46.360]  And if if we could just make men more feminine and women more masculine, we could all kind
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:49.840]  of be this equal type of thing, this new creature, this new goblin.
[03:15:49.840 --> 03:15:51.040]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:52.040]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:52.040 --> 03:15:56.840]  And we're talking about the rise of witchcraft and why it's a problem.
[03:15:56.840 --> 03:16:00.720]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reese of The
[03:16:00.720 --> 03:16:01.720]  Reese Report.
[03:16:01.720 --> 03:16:05.280]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.

[03:17:06.360 --> 03:17:09.000]  So I get constant questions online in person.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:10.000]  Hey, what's better?
[03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:11.000]  Knockout.
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:12.000]  What's better?
[03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:13.000]  Down and out.
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:14.000]  What's better?
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:15.640]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:17:15.640 --> 03:17:20.120]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[03:17:20.120 --> 03:17:21.240]  people.
[03:17:21.240 --> 03:17:25.320]  So one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[03:17:25.320 --> 03:17:26.520]  That's how our bodies work.

[03:19:57.920 --> 03:20:04.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.700 --> 03:20:17.660]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, we're talking about the tradition of the higher
[03:20:17.660 --> 03:20:23.500]  original being or the original single cell organism, which was not gendered, that was
[03:20:23.500 --> 03:20:26.220]  not any kind of distinctive thing.
[03:20:26.220 --> 03:20:31.860]  It was something higher that we evolved into or we fell into, which then caused the differences
[03:20:31.860 --> 03:20:34.340]  and the distinctions in the warfare that we experienced.
[03:20:34.340 --> 03:20:39.260]  And if we could just all be melded back into one big blob, as Huxley says in Perennial
[03:20:39.260 --> 03:20:42.940]  Philosophy, then we could get rid of war, we could get rid of all the problems that
[03:20:42.940 --> 03:20:43.940]  humanity has.
[03:20:43.940 --> 03:20:48.180]  And that's really partly what the Baphomet symbolizes, it's a lot of things that's supposed
[03:20:48.180 --> 03:20:51.020]  to be balanced between polar opposites and all that.
[03:20:51.020 --> 03:20:54.820]  But one of the reasons that it's hallowed by a lot of these people, a lot of these groups
[03:20:54.820 --> 03:21:02.660]  is because for them it's a symbol for a new age, a new era, a new aeon, the aeon of the
[03:21:02.660 --> 03:21:07.380]  crown and conquering child, if you're in certain esoteric occult societies, they think
[03:21:07.380 --> 03:21:12.740]  that this new age is one that will give, will surpass Christianity, so you had this old
[03:21:12.740 --> 03:21:17.380]  age of the father and then Christianity age of the son, and now we'll pass on into some
[03:21:17.380 --> 03:21:23.140]  new Luciferian age, which will be the crown and conquering child or something like this,
[03:21:23.140 --> 03:21:27.380]  that's where we're going and the symbol of that aeon or that era is typically something
[03:21:27.380 --> 03:21:28.380]  like Baphomet.
[03:21:29.100 --> 03:21:36.820]  Well, not only is it a symbol of male and female, of mundane and spiritual, but also
[03:21:36.820 --> 03:21:42.940]  animal and man conjoined, and that's going to lead to man's merging with technology
[03:21:42.940 --> 03:21:43.940]  and transhumanism.
[03:21:43.940 --> 03:21:51.340]  Right, so it's an evolutionary image of ascending from animal to man to whatever the next tech
[03:21:51.340 --> 03:21:53.540]  god will be.
[03:21:53.540 --> 03:21:58.140]  So let's talk about some of these high-profile witches.
[03:21:58.140 --> 03:21:59.580]  Okay, sure.
[03:21:59.580 --> 03:22:05.180]  Well everyone knows, I think number one on my list would be Marina Abramovich, and she
[03:22:05.180 --> 03:22:09.740]  got famous in 2016 for her spirit cooking, remember that?
[03:22:09.740 --> 03:22:10.740]  Yes.
[03:22:10.740 --> 03:22:12.220]  And this is why...
[03:22:12.220 --> 03:22:16.860]  All the Democrat elite hanging out and they're all into witchcraft and spirit cooking and
[03:22:16.860 --> 03:22:18.220]  the Podestas and all that, yeah.
[03:22:18.220 --> 03:22:23.220]  Well, this is why even when I would be studying Wicca and witchcraft and stuff like that,
[03:22:23.900 --> 03:22:25.980]  I couldn't get into it because of the mediums they use.
[03:22:25.980 --> 03:22:30.180]  If you actually want to get down to the nitty-gritty and do a spell, you're going to have to be
[03:22:30.180 --> 03:22:31.180]  using bodily fluids.
[03:22:31.180 --> 03:22:33.180]  That's a bunch of nasty bodily fluids.
[03:22:33.180 --> 03:22:34.180]  It's really gross.
[03:22:34.180 --> 03:22:35.180]  Yes, nasty.
[03:22:35.180 --> 03:22:38.780]  It's blood, breast milk, all that stuff.
[03:22:38.780 --> 03:22:45.180]  So she is also famous for her Hollywood mock cannibal dinner parties, right?
[03:22:45.180 --> 03:22:49.300]  She's good friends with Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, James Franco.
[03:22:49.300 --> 03:22:55.340]  One of her early art installments was a picture of her sitting on a pile of bloody cow bones
[03:22:55.340 --> 03:22:56.340]  called Balkan Baroque.
[03:22:56.340 --> 03:22:59.340]  Have you seen that picture?
[03:22:59.340 --> 03:23:00.340]  No.
[03:23:00.340 --> 03:23:10.580]  So this is what the culture is projected to start accepting, discussing things as art.
[03:23:10.580 --> 03:23:12.360]  Well, that's been by design.
[03:23:12.360 --> 03:23:17.260]  This was something that the CIA pioneered with the Congress for Cultural Freedom in
[03:23:17.260 --> 03:23:22.700]  the Cold War when they tried to get everybody into abstract art to supposedly combat cosmism
[03:23:22.700 --> 03:23:26.060]  and Soviet art, the realism of Soviet art.
[03:23:26.060 --> 03:23:31.380]  So the CIA promoted abstract art, and then it made alliances with the postmodernists.
[03:23:31.380 --> 03:23:36.860]  So a lot of postmodern art starts going in this direction of intentionally defying all
[03:23:36.860 --> 03:23:43.420]  conventions, defying all notions of taboos and morality, and so it becomes this transgressive
[03:23:43.420 --> 03:23:44.420]  thing.
[03:23:44.420 --> 03:23:49.060]  And that's where we get the next level of that consciously Luciferian satanic art of
[03:23:49.060 --> 03:23:54.740]  people like H.R. Giger and Damien Hirst and the Piss Christ and all this kind of stuff.
[03:23:54.740 --> 03:24:01.620]  So in 2020, Abramovich was hired by Bill Gates to do a video advertisement for HoloLens 2,
[03:24:01.620 --> 03:24:04.100]  which was a headset designed for mixed reality, right?
[03:24:04.100 --> 03:24:07.700]  Yeah, I made a YouTube video on this at the time.
[03:24:07.700 --> 03:24:09.700]  I remember that very well.
[03:24:09.700 --> 03:24:13.780]  Well, luckily, it was only up for less than a week before it was given 24,000 thumbs down.
[03:24:14.100 --> 03:24:15.140]  It got bombed.
[03:24:15.140 --> 03:24:17.940]  On YouTube, we do not want your gross witchcraft.
[03:24:17.940 --> 03:24:25.460]  But then in 2021, they unveiled an art installation piece by her to the victims of the Holocaust
[03:24:25.460 --> 03:24:30.180]  in Ukraine called Crystal Wall of Crying, and that was attended by Zelensky and the
[03:24:30.180 --> 03:24:36.180]  presidents of Israel and Germany, and which is supposed to be symbolically linked to the
[03:24:36.180 --> 03:24:37.700]  Wailing Wall in Jerusalem.
[03:24:37.700 --> 03:24:44.420]  So she has got some very powerful friends in high places who are actually students of
[03:24:44.420 --> 03:24:47.300]  hers, and she is considered their mentor.
[03:24:47.300 --> 03:24:53.860]  Yeah, I think witchcraft appeals to obviously a lot of the elite women out there, the girl
[03:24:53.860 --> 03:24:54.740]  bosses, right?
[03:24:54.740 --> 03:24:58.180]  The people who are leaning in, and it's a way for them to network.
[03:24:58.180 --> 03:25:02.980]  I remember Hillary famously was attending certain covens and witchcraft meetings.
[03:25:02.980 --> 03:25:04.580]  If you remember that, that came out.
[03:25:04.580 --> 03:25:08.340]  And now she used to have Larry Nichols on, who was always talking about, Hillary's a
[03:25:08.340 --> 03:25:08.980]  witch.
[03:25:08.980 --> 03:25:11.700]  Hillary goes to witch meetings, she's a witch.
[03:25:11.700 --> 03:25:13.300]  That's how Larry Nichols talked.
[03:25:13.300 --> 03:25:15.460]  But anyway, yeah, he talked about that a long time ago.
[03:25:15.460 --> 03:25:17.620]  I think he was a bodyguard or something for the Clintons.
[03:25:17.620 --> 03:25:24.660]  But yeah, so witchcraft is, I think, pretty popular amongst the girl boss elites.
[03:25:25.300 --> 03:25:32.580]  Well, not only that, it is popular amongst the pop stars that also exhibit monarch mind
[03:25:32.580 --> 03:25:33.940]  control symbols.
[03:25:34.980 --> 03:25:36.340]  Well, yeah, witchcraft.
[03:25:36.340 --> 03:25:37.540]  So they go hand in hand.
[03:25:37.540 --> 03:25:42.980]  Yeah, the covens are good places for pulling for the elite structure.
[03:25:42.980 --> 03:25:48.580]  So if you want to go up into society, especially within the circles of the pop stars and the
[03:25:48.580 --> 03:25:52.660]  Democratic Party and all that, witchcraft and Satanism are actually ways that you kind
[03:25:52.660 --> 03:25:56.660]  of go up the rungs of the ladder if you're particularly devious.
[03:25:56.660 --> 03:26:02.100]  So I think it's recruiting grounds for higher level serving the system, so to speak.
[03:26:02.660 --> 03:26:07.780]  So one of the premier examples of this is Madonna, who made Kabbalah mainstream.
[03:26:09.460 --> 03:26:14.180]  She is famous for blasphemous images and videos and songs, right?
[03:26:14.180 --> 03:26:19.060]  She initiated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera into the Hollywood cult, and she
[03:26:19.060 --> 03:26:21.700]  says that her performances are like sermons.
[03:26:21.700 --> 03:26:26.340]  And then you've got Katy Perry, who just did a recent, like a couple years ago, series
[03:26:26.340 --> 03:26:26.900]  of videos.
[03:26:27.700 --> 03:26:30.900]  It had the classic witch on broomstick themes.
[03:26:30.900 --> 03:26:32.740]  One of the videos called Cry About It Later.
[03:26:33.460 --> 03:26:43.700]  And then just recently, Taylor Swift and her cult phenomenon of a concert called Eras.
[03:26:43.700 --> 03:26:47.940]  The live performance of her song Willow has fans screaming, summon the demons.
[03:26:48.820 --> 03:26:55.780]  And the screenshots from her video for a song called Karma featuring Ice Spice has her going
[03:26:55.780 --> 03:27:01.860]  into the underworld and portraying demonic images with horns and masks and things like
[03:27:01.860 --> 03:27:02.100]  that.
[03:27:02.100 --> 03:27:07.220]  Well, they were also claiming that people that went to her concerts had amnesia, that
[03:27:07.220 --> 03:27:08.500]  they didn't recall the events.
[03:27:08.500 --> 03:27:11.300]  And so maybe there was something else going on, right?
[03:27:11.300 --> 03:27:16.500]  So, yeah, they couldn't remember anything that happened, only that they had a transcendental
[03:27:16.500 --> 03:27:17.540]  experience.
[03:27:17.540 --> 03:27:23.300]  And then there was another article about Taylor Swift, where a therapist said that over 50
[03:27:23.380 --> 03:27:29.140]  percent of my female patients that have mental illnesses are also upset with Taylor Swift.
[03:27:30.740 --> 03:27:33.380]  So some links to think about.
[03:27:33.380 --> 03:27:38.980]  Yeah, the pop stars are really, I mean, whether they're witches or not, every one of them
[03:27:38.980 --> 03:27:41.540]  individually, they utilize the same principles, right?
[03:27:41.540 --> 03:27:49.060]  I think you've talked about Anton LaVey says that you pull from all of your skills and
[03:27:49.060 --> 03:27:54.500]  strategy and techniques that you have as a woman, including intentionally becoming an
[03:27:54.500 --> 03:27:56.660]  object of attraction, right?
[03:27:56.660 --> 03:27:57.620]  Like lust.
[03:27:57.620 --> 03:28:00.260]  You do this as part of your craft, right?
[03:28:00.260 --> 03:28:05.780]  And what's interesting is that the craft of Freemasonry is the basis for today's modern
[03:28:05.780 --> 03:28:11.780]  witchcraft, because Wicca comes out of actually it's not an ancient goddess tradition.
[03:28:11.780 --> 03:28:16.420]  It's actually Crowley and Gerald Gardner that are the original founders of modern Wicca.
[03:28:16.420 --> 03:28:22.260]  They're the one that gave the radar, the way the confession of the witches comes from
[03:28:22.260 --> 03:28:23.780]  phrases from Crowley.
[03:28:23.780 --> 03:28:27.460]  And Gerald Gardner studied under Crowley for many years before he created modern Wicca.
[03:28:28.100 --> 03:28:31.140]  Hence the use of bodily fluids, just like the O.T.O.
[03:28:31.780 --> 03:28:32.020]  Yeah.
[03:28:32.020 --> 03:28:38.500]  So they again, it's and this is really just a way, I think, to get you to do more and
[03:28:38.500 --> 03:28:44.100]  more degrading things to ensure that you can go up in the hierarchy of control.
[03:28:44.180 --> 03:28:47.860]  And that's why the elites are all people who are, you know, compromised in a blackmail
[03:28:47.860 --> 03:28:48.100]  sense.
[03:28:48.100 --> 03:28:48.660]  Don't get away.
[03:28:48.660 --> 03:28:50.020]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:28:50.020 --> 03:28:54.660]  We're talking about the control of culture through various cults, including witchcraft.
[03:28:54.660 --> 03:28:55.940]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:28:57.700 --> 03:29:02.820]  We have three original one of a kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist and
[03:29:02.820 --> 03:29:07.460]  inforestore.com that don't have fillers that are filled with high quality essential oils
[03:29:07.460 --> 03:29:08.340]  and more.
[03:29:08.340 --> 03:29:09.540]  We have the tumor toothpaste.
[03:29:10.340 --> 03:29:13.780]  We have the ultimate tooth whitening, a cruel calcium toothpaste.
[03:29:13.780 --> 03:29:17.940]  And we have the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key
[03:29:17.940 --> 03:29:21.380]  essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole
[03:29:21.380 --> 03:29:22.900]  mouth, your throat and more.
[03:29:22.900 --> 03:29:24.980]  These are really game changing toothpaste.
[03:29:24.980 --> 03:29:26.340]  They're very, very strong.
[03:29:26.340 --> 03:29:28.420]  Most over the counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[03:29:28.420 --> 03:29:29.460]  Ours don't.
[03:29:29.460 --> 03:29:30.980]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[03:29:30.980 --> 03:29:36.900]  It is just chock full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[03:29:36.900 --> 03:29:38.820]  So it's now back in stock.
[03:29:38.820 --> 03:29:40.420]  It became a bestseller.
[03:29:40.420 --> 03:29:43.700]  The tumeric toothpaste is available again at inforestore.com.
[03:29:43.700 --> 03:29:45.300]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[03:29:45.300 --> 03:29:49.140]  We got some of that left and we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste
[03:29:49.140 --> 03:29:50.660]  in stock, but it's running out as well.
[03:29:50.660 --> 03:29:54.420]  So all three toothpaste in stock for a limited time inforestore.com.
[03:29:57.460 --> 03:30:00.900]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:30:00.900 --> 03:30:02.260]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:30:02.900 --> 03:30:06.100]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:30:06.900 --> 03:30:10.340]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[03:30:10.340 --> 03:30:15.060]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:20.420]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:30:20.420 --> 03:30:21.780]  five, six, seven days a week.
[03:30:22.660 --> 03:30:23.700]  It's really just incredible.
[03:30:24.580 --> 03:30:27.620]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:30:28.180 --> 03:30:33.380]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:30:34.020 --> 03:30:35.060]  I know you spread the word.
[03:30:35.060 --> 03:30:35.940]  I know you pray for us.
[03:30:35.940 --> 03:30:36.580]  That's wonderful.
[03:30:36.580 --> 03:30:37.140]  Keep doing it.
[03:30:37.140 --> 03:30:41.140]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:41.140 --> 03:30:44.100]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:30:44.100 --> 03:30:45.940]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:30:45.940 --> 03:30:50.260]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:50.260 --> 03:30:53.860]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:30:53.860 --> 03:30:55.220]  our funding problems will be over.
[03:30:55.220 --> 03:30:56.420]  Please take action now.
[03:30:56.420 --> 03:30:59.780]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months.
[03:30:59.780 --> 03:31:01.380]  And it's TurboForce Plus.
[03:31:01.380 --> 03:31:02.980]  We made it even stronger.

[03:32:56.200 --> 03:33:05.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:07.700 --> 03:33:35.700]  Welcome back, I just want to let you know I'm here with my wife, Jamie, and we are talking about the rise of witchcraft as the most popular religious trend amongst the young, amongst Zoomers, and we're talking about why that might be, and is this actually just part of social engineering and steering us into a society more amenable to the technocratic order and what the global elite want.
[03:33:35.700 --> 03:33:37.700]  I think that's absolutely the case.
[03:33:37.700 --> 03:33:47.700]  In fact, the modern so-called Wicca is not an ancient religion, it's a retooled, repackaged, recreated thing from Gerald Gardner and Alistair Crowley.
[03:33:47.700 --> 03:33:51.700]  Didn't you say he just liked to smack butts?
[03:33:52.700 --> 03:34:01.700]  Yeah, well, that comes from what he would get the witches naked, sky clad out in the woods and just spank them with switches.
[03:34:01.700 --> 03:34:05.700]  So that was what Gerald Gardner was really interested in.
[03:34:05.700 --> 03:34:10.700]  It had nothing to do with trying to find some mystical powers, it was just a cult.
[03:34:10.700 --> 03:34:20.700]  It's just a way to set up, you know, mind control, you know, fleecing operations with covens, basically.
[03:34:21.700 --> 03:34:28.700]  And, you know, witchcraft isn't all lavender herbs and crystals, it's disgusting things, right?
[03:34:28.700 --> 03:34:48.700]  Yeah, I mean, there's this idea that there's a white magic and then there's black magic and you can do white magic, but no, actually all magic is really just delusion, it's deception, and it's just putting you into a ridiculous situation to believe in irrational things and be controlled by forces far above you that are highly deceptive and highly manipulative.
[03:34:48.700 --> 03:34:52.700]  And I don't just mean the demons, I'm talking about on the human sphere as well.
[03:34:52.700 --> 03:35:02.700]  Like a lot of these cults, all these religious groups are actually part and parcel of pushing us into an elite structure that control mechanism of the Great Reset and all that.
[03:35:02.700 --> 03:35:15.700]  So all of these things actually, for example, any nature worship tradition is absolutely amenable to the Great Reset because it's going to get us into this idea that humanity needs to be depopulated for Mother Earth.
[03:35:15.700 --> 03:35:18.700]  We've got to have a global government for Mother Earth, etc.
[03:35:18.700 --> 03:35:21.700]  So even the alien cults, they all say the same thing.
[03:35:21.700 --> 03:35:29.700]  Well, I realize some of my examples might be a little outdated, elder millennial, talking about Madonna and Katy Perry and stuff like that.
[03:35:29.700 --> 03:35:30.700]  What about the younger people?
[03:35:30.700 --> 03:35:33.700]  Yeah, so I have these Gen Z witches.
[03:35:33.700 --> 03:35:36.700]  First one is Abigail Breslin, the little girl from science.
[03:35:36.700 --> 03:35:37.700]  You remember her?
[03:35:38.700 --> 03:35:42.700]  So she's all grown up now and she is a singer with an alter ego named Sophomore.
[03:35:42.700 --> 03:35:48.700]  And she describes herself as a very witchy person and comes from a long line of witchy women with psychic medium abilities.
[03:35:48.700 --> 03:35:55.700]  There is a up-and-coming TikTok star named Ashnikko who is very open about being a witch on her TikToks.
[03:35:55.700 --> 03:36:02.700]  There is a girl called Melanie Martinez who has also many of the symbols of monarch mind control.
[03:36:02.700 --> 03:36:03.700]  She's got the split dyed hair.
[03:36:03.700 --> 03:36:05.700]  She's got the alter personalities.
[03:36:05.700 --> 03:36:12.700]  On her album called K-12, her alter goes through a portal with an immortal angel named Lilith.
[03:36:12.700 --> 03:36:19.700]  And Lilith is a higher up spirit in witchcraft and Satanism.
[03:36:19.700 --> 03:36:23.700]  Well, Lilith is associated with child sacrifice and abortion.
[03:36:23.700 --> 03:36:24.700]  Right.
[03:36:24.700 --> 03:36:26.700]  So this is the demon from the Talmud, a succubus.
[03:36:26.700 --> 03:36:31.700]  This is who's leading Melanie Martinez through the portal.
[03:36:31.700 --> 03:36:32.700]  She's also mentioned in Isaiah.
[03:36:32.700 --> 03:36:34.700]  So she's actually in the text of Isaiah.
[03:36:34.700 --> 03:36:35.700]  Lilith is.
[03:36:35.700 --> 03:36:42.700]  And she's also mentioned in, I think, Epic of Gilgamesh or Inanna, one of those Anunnaki tales.
[03:36:42.700 --> 03:36:43.700]  They also talk about her.
[03:36:43.700 --> 03:36:49.700]  Her album Crybaby is an extraterrestrial looking thing.
[03:36:49.700 --> 03:36:57.700]  So we were talking about the Baphomet earlier with the fusion of different species, different genders, different.
[03:36:57.700 --> 03:36:58.700]  Genetic modification.
[03:36:58.700 --> 03:36:59.700]  Yeah.
[03:36:59.700 --> 03:37:04.700]  So she has an extraterrestrial looking altar.
[03:37:04.700 --> 03:37:11.700]  And then you have Bella Porch is also another one with the witchcraft symbolism.
[03:37:11.700 --> 03:37:16.700]  And Emma Watson, Hermoine from Harry Potter.
[03:37:16.700 --> 03:37:17.700]  He for she.
[03:37:17.700 --> 03:37:18.700]  Thanks.
[03:37:18.700 --> 03:37:19.700]  Her covenant, which is for supporting her.
[03:37:19.700 --> 03:37:20.700]  Yes.
[03:37:20.700 --> 03:37:26.700]  In fact, thanks to Brittany Sellner for pointing out that Emma Watson recently announced that she was initiated into witchcraft.
[03:37:26.700 --> 03:37:30.700]  And she has announced that on her Instagram or something.
[03:37:30.700 --> 03:37:37.700]  But we were just talking about this notion of feminism and Luciferianism with Selmer from a more cultural perspective.
[03:37:37.700 --> 03:37:42.700]  And Jamie is giving us the breakdown from more of an occult, an esoteric perspective.
[03:37:42.700 --> 03:37:44.700]  So you have culture and you have a culture.
[03:37:44.700 --> 03:37:46.700]  So we're talking about the culture today.
[03:37:46.700 --> 03:37:47.700]  But, yeah.
[03:37:47.700 --> 03:37:51.700]  So here you have a younger pop stars as well.
[03:37:51.700 --> 03:37:52.700]  Also representing this.
[03:37:53.700 --> 03:37:58.700]  So it's not just the older generation of the Madonna's and the Britney Spears and the Katy Perry's.
[03:37:58.700 --> 03:38:00.700]  It's the new ones as well.
[03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:08.700]  And why do you do you think that they're that they reach a certain level and then they get reached out to to join it?
[03:38:08.700 --> 03:38:10.700]  Or do you think that they go seeking it out?
[03:38:10.700 --> 03:38:11.700]  Do you think they're recruited?
[03:38:11.700 --> 03:38:13.700]  I guess is what I'm trying to say.
[03:38:13.700 --> 03:38:16.700]  I think they want to fit in with the culture.
[03:38:16.700 --> 03:38:20.700]  And that includes what we're talking about.
[03:38:20.700 --> 03:38:25.700]  I mean, do you think that they're paid to do this or do you think that they're recruited into it and really initiated into it?
[03:38:25.700 --> 03:38:29.700]  Yes, I think they're really initiated into it and paid to do it.
[03:38:29.700 --> 03:38:32.700]  So it's a win in their mind.
[03:38:32.700 --> 03:38:33.700]  It's a win win.
[03:38:33.700 --> 03:38:34.700]  Right.
[03:38:34.700 --> 03:38:37.700]  But these things used to be more hidden.
[03:38:37.700 --> 03:38:41.700]  Even, you know, 10, 20 years ago, you'd have to.
[03:38:41.700 --> 03:38:43.700]  But now you can be openly a witch, openly a Satanist.
[03:38:43.700 --> 03:38:47.700]  I mean, you know, for a lot of these groups, abortion is a sacrament.
[03:38:47.700 --> 03:38:48.700]  Right.
[03:38:49.700 --> 03:38:50.700]  So it's celebrated.
[03:38:50.700 --> 03:38:55.700]  And even in what we do in decoding movies and stuff, it used to be more occult.
[03:38:55.700 --> 03:38:56.700]  Subtle.
[03:38:56.700 --> 03:38:57.700]  Yes.
[03:38:57.700 --> 03:38:58.700]  Subtle.
[03:38:58.700 --> 03:38:59.700]  Exactly.
[03:38:59.700 --> 03:39:05.700]  But the more you learn about magic, the more you're going to be convinced that humanity is under a spell in a literal sense.
[03:39:05.700 --> 03:39:12.700]  And also that all of magic is inherently sexual in nature.
[03:39:13.700 --> 03:39:17.700]  Well, I mean, humans are primarily, you know, driven by biology.
[03:39:17.700 --> 03:39:18.700]  Right.
[03:39:18.700 --> 03:39:20.700]  That's our most fundamental component in this.
[03:39:20.700 --> 03:39:24.700]  I mean, I believe we have a soul and higher, but I'm saying from the vantage point of this world.
[03:39:24.700 --> 03:39:25.700]  Right.
[03:39:25.700 --> 03:39:29.700]  We are beings with bodies where we have an animalistic component to us.
[03:39:29.700 --> 03:39:38.700]  And so to steer and manipulate the biological drives is one of the key means by which the elite, the power elite control us.
[03:39:38.700 --> 03:39:42.700]  And it's the mode of creation of new souls and people.
[03:39:42.700 --> 03:39:43.700]  Right.
[03:39:43.700 --> 03:39:51.700]  But I'm saying that thus they would like to control sexuality for the purpose ultimately of having no humans.
[03:39:51.700 --> 03:39:52.700]  Right.
[03:39:52.700 --> 03:39:53.700]  I mean, whatever works to have less humans.
[03:39:53.700 --> 03:40:00.700]  And so these kinds of sex cults and witchcraft and all these things are ultimately kind of being versions of sex cults.
[03:40:00.700 --> 03:40:06.700]  These are actually ultimately just to steer sexuality away from reproduction.
[03:40:06.700 --> 03:40:07.700]  That's it.
[03:40:07.700 --> 03:40:13.700]  So when you're introducing concepts of magic to children.
[03:40:13.800 --> 03:40:22.039]  In my opinion, this is not a very good thing to do because the magic wand according to
[03:40:22.039 --> 03:40:25.359]  them is a phallus, right?
[03:40:25.359 --> 03:40:28.320]  And they have poems about it.
[03:40:28.320 --> 03:40:32.279]  They call it the hollow tube that brings the fire from heaven.
[03:40:32.279 --> 03:40:35.800]  And so when you've got all these kids running around with wands in their hands, what they're
[03:40:35.800 --> 03:40:38.759]  actually doing is being prepped to use.
[03:40:38.759 --> 03:40:43.480]  Well, it's funny because it's supposed to be everything in these kinds of religions
[03:40:43.480 --> 03:40:47.119]  or pagan religion is supposed to be the exaltation and worship of nature.
[03:40:47.119 --> 03:40:51.439]  But the irony is that it's not actually about the worship of nature for the production
[03:40:51.439 --> 03:40:52.599]  of new life.
[03:40:52.599 --> 03:40:55.439]  It's actually about the stunting of new life, right?
[03:40:55.439 --> 03:40:59.279]  So these groups are not really about celebrating nature and life.
[03:40:59.279 --> 03:41:04.340]  They might say that, but they all celebrate, you know, abortion, they all celebrate things
[03:41:04.340 --> 03:41:07.679]  that are detrimental to human life and civilization, right?
[03:41:07.679 --> 03:41:10.539]  So the wand, the phallus is not being used to create new life.
[03:41:10.539 --> 03:41:16.539]  Like you said, it's being used to force their will onto reality and to redirect the sexual
[03:41:16.539 --> 03:41:22.420]  impulse into imposing your will on society and not to have children, right?
[03:41:22.420 --> 03:41:30.580]  And so their dictum is love under will and your will is what you're supposed to be.
[03:41:30.580 --> 03:41:31.580]  Your will is law.
[03:41:31.580 --> 03:41:33.060]  There's not a law that you submit to.
[03:41:33.060 --> 03:41:34.340]  Your will is the law.
[03:41:34.340 --> 03:41:37.900]  And also to get in touch with your holy guardian angel.
[03:41:37.900 --> 03:41:42.900]  And I don't have a picture of him, but in our live talks and like what we're going to
[03:41:42.900 --> 03:41:48.980]  be doing in LA, if you come to that, your mind is going to be blown like the Tim and
[03:41:48.980 --> 03:41:54.259]  Eric meme, even more so than it is today.
[03:41:54.259 --> 03:41:59.340]  But these guardian angels look exactly like the demons from childhood's end that they're
[03:41:59.340 --> 03:42:00.340]  trying to get in touch with.
[03:42:00.340 --> 03:42:06.980]  Arthur C. Clarke, who's in the circles of, you know, the Corlean occultists and the Luciferians.
[03:42:07.060 --> 03:42:11.099]  When he draws the sentinel and that's connected to the childhood's end and that's connected
[03:42:11.099 --> 03:42:12.099]  to 2001, right?
[03:42:12.099 --> 03:42:18.300]  It has this Corlean is this demonic looking figure and it demands a sacrifice of the children,
[03:42:18.300 --> 03:42:19.300]  right?
[03:42:19.300 --> 03:42:21.699]  So the idea is that you give us your firstborn, right?
[03:42:21.699 --> 03:42:27.460]  And that's, again, tying back into that notion of abortion as a giant sacrifice, right?
[03:42:27.460 --> 03:42:32.220]  To the power elite so that the power elite can supposedly evolve us into the next phase
[03:42:32.220 --> 03:42:34.740]  of human evolution, this new aeon, right?
[03:42:34.740 --> 03:42:39.179]  They really do see it as a cycle, cycle of human sacrifice and the idea is that, well,
[03:42:39.179 --> 03:42:43.220]  but nature itself is a cycle of human sacrifice and death, predator, prey.
[03:42:43.220 --> 03:42:49.179]  So that's, they're saying that we're the priests of evolution is what they're saying by that.
[03:42:49.179 --> 03:42:50.179]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:42:50.179 --> 03:42:51.179]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:51.179 --> 03:42:56.939]  We'll be right back covering the rise of witchcraft on the Alex Jones show.

[03:43:30.340 --> 03:43:32.939]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[03:43:32.939 --> 03:43:34.060]  The enemy's out in the open.
[03:43:34.060 --> 03:43:35.060]  People are vindicated.

[03:45:51.000 --> 03:46:03.640]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[03:46:03.640 --> 03:46:04.640]  supply.
[03:46:04.640 --> 03:46:09.560]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:46:09.560 --> 03:46:13.759]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:46:13.759 --> 03:46:16.599]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:46:16.599 --> 03:46:19.920]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:46:19.920 --> 03:46:25.119]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:46:25.119 --> 03:46:27.840]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:46:27.840 --> 03:46:34.519]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[03:46:34.519 --> 03:46:38.840]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:46:38.840 --> 03:46:44.640]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:46:44.640 --> 03:46:50.800]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[03:46:58.240 --> 03:47:04.439]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.900 --> 03:47:18.900]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer. I'm Jason Alicis, and I'm here with Jamie, and we're talking about the rise of witchcraft.
[03:47:18.900 --> 03:47:29.900]  One of our good friends wrote a good book called Occult Feminism, and she talks about the secret history of women's liberation actually having its predecessor in witchcraft.
[03:47:29.900 --> 03:47:37.900]  Witchcraft really paved the way, you could say, for a lot of the revolutionary ideas of feminism and radical egalitarianism.
[03:47:37.900 --> 03:47:43.900]  And that also goes back to the French Revolution, if you're familiar with the excellent book by James Billington.
[03:47:43.900 --> 03:47:54.900]  He's not any kind of conspiracy theorist. He's actually a historian. He was a Librarian of Congress scholar who was writing about the track of revolutionary philosophy and thought.
[03:47:54.900 --> 03:48:02.900]  And he notes that a lot of the revolutionaries, some of the French Revolution, Mary Wollstonecraft famously, they were early pioneer feminists.
[03:48:02.900 --> 03:48:08.900]  And so feminism really has its roots in not just witchcraft, but also French Revolution.
[03:48:08.900 --> 03:48:14.900]  And that's why it was so important for them to push the notion that everything is equal, everything is the same.
[03:48:14.900 --> 03:48:22.900]  And we have to war against all of the inequalities, all the distinctions and all the differences, because it becomes a power dynamic.
[03:48:22.900 --> 03:48:34.900]  It's an oppressor-oppressed dynamic. This is where we get this idea that everybody who has any advantage or has any gifts or has any talents or skills or abilities is somehow privileged and therefore bad and therefore an oppressor.
[03:48:34.900 --> 03:48:40.900]  And so I recommend getting Rachel Wilson's book, Occult Feminism. It's really good on this.
[03:48:40.900 --> 03:48:45.900]  I would say that Jamie and I, we've also been critiquing and calling this out for a long time.
[03:48:45.900 --> 03:48:51.900]  And I know that if you come to our LA event, like Jamie was saying, you're going to see a really good critique of this stuff when Jamie does her presentation on
[03:48:52.900 --> 03:49:04.900]  Hollywood and mind control and AI and how Hollywood's really been prepping us for this, initiating us on a mass scale in terms of, you know, what most people watch movies.
[03:49:04.900 --> 03:49:10.900]  They don't watch the news. They don't watch it. They watch people are taught and indoctrinated by stories, by film.
[03:49:11.900 --> 03:49:23.900]  And so there's this notion that if we can make everyone equal and make everyone the same, if we can homogenize everyone and everything, then we'll have this peaceful future order.
[03:49:23.900 --> 03:49:31.900]  And it's all just ridiculous dystopianism. Utopianism is actually used as a strategy and a technique to reengineer society.
[03:49:32.900 --> 03:49:39.900]  So it's a tool. It's not really about giving you a coon pod, giving you equality, giving you the UBI. It's all baloney.
[03:49:39.900 --> 03:49:45.900]  And likewise, the idea of feminism and you being empowered and a girl boss and leaning in.
[03:49:45.900 --> 03:49:54.900]  All that's going to give you is you being alone when you're 50 or 60 and you being put into the euthanasia centers, you know, sleep pod.
[03:49:54.900 --> 03:49:58.900]  Right. That's what that's going to get you, because you don't have children. You have offspring. You have a legacy.
[03:49:58.900 --> 03:50:10.900]  You have any of those things that the lies of feminism and radical individualism and postmodernist and magical thinking you can identify as whatever you want.
[03:50:10.900 --> 03:50:19.900]  These are all destructive. And as Rachel notes, you couldn't have today's trends and all this kind of stuff if you had not previously had feminism.
[03:50:20.900 --> 03:50:26.900]  Feminism prepared the way for the Skittles rainbow revolution that prepared the way for the trans revolution.
[03:50:26.900 --> 03:50:30.900]  And that's all going to prepare the way for the next phase, which will be the transhumanist revolution.
[03:50:30.900 --> 03:50:39.900]  Well, the Skittles agenda and witchcraft kind of merged together perfectly in the recent Target scandal.
[03:50:39.900 --> 03:50:43.900]  They had those clothes for children that said Satan loves pronouns.
[03:50:43.900 --> 03:50:50.900]  And the creator of those designs posted their Instagram wearing horns and looking like Baphomet.
[03:50:53.900 --> 03:50:56.900]  Well, we've been talking about this for ages. You wrote in your book. Right.
[03:50:56.900 --> 03:51:00.900]  I wrote in my book. My stuff came out almost 10 years ago. Right.
[03:51:00.900 --> 03:51:05.900]  That that this was really an intentional social engineering and a cult project.
[03:51:05.900 --> 03:51:13.900]  And people say, oh, that's crazy. You think that there's Satanists that are involved in pop culture and you're a nutball, you're tenfold hat.
[03:51:13.900 --> 03:51:19.900]  No, we've been absolutely vindicated. Now they've you know, it's it's hidden in plain sight.
[03:51:19.900 --> 03:51:22.900]  Well, it used to be hidden in plain sight. Now it's just right in your face. Right.
[03:51:22.900 --> 03:51:25.900]  So is anybody saying I'm sorry you were right? No.
[03:51:25.900 --> 03:51:27.900]  So you're still you're you're a bigot. Right.
[03:51:28.900 --> 03:51:35.900]  So it was bad or didn't exist when you talked about it and that it would be eventually in the public purview.
[03:51:35.900 --> 03:51:39.900]  Now that it's in the public purview. Well, it's not that bad. And you're a bigot for not liking it. Right.
[03:51:39.900 --> 03:51:43.900]  So what's the next phase? Well, it's going to be like the state religion of some kind.
[03:51:43.900 --> 03:51:49.900]  Right. If you don't believe in, you know, the the whatever new age of world religions coming. Right.
[03:51:49.900 --> 03:51:51.900]  You're the bad person. You're the bigot. You've got to go.
[03:51:51.900 --> 03:51:57.900]  And we have seen all of these corporations pledge their allegiance to the rainbow flag.
[03:51:57.900 --> 03:52:02.900]  And well, have you ever wondered why Target is at the forefront of these things?
[03:52:02.900 --> 03:52:06.900]  Well, each time. Yes. Target is one of these. Absolutely.
[03:52:06.900 --> 03:52:10.900]  Tip of the spear pioneering Luciferian companies. Absolutely.
[03:52:10.900 --> 03:52:15.900]  Decoding decoding corporate logos is a part of this education that you need to have.
[03:52:15.900 --> 03:52:22.900]  And the circum pumped, which is the logo of Target, is a very deep esoteric symbol.
[03:52:22.900 --> 03:52:28.900]  Going back to Pythagoras, Plato's symbol is the monad. It's a symbol of the Illuminati.
[03:52:28.900 --> 03:52:35.900]  It's an alchemical symbol of fire. It is the point in the circle, which is a hermaphroditic symbol.
[03:52:35.900 --> 03:52:39.900]  So even Dan Brown, you remember him? He wrote a whole book.
[03:52:39.900 --> 03:52:45.900]  He called it the Lost Symbol. And at the end of the book, it reveals it's the point within the circle, the Target logo.
[03:52:45.900 --> 03:52:54.900]  So all of these corporations that have pledged their allegiance to the Skittles agenda are also influenced by occultism.
[03:52:54.900 --> 03:52:57.900]  Witchcraft, Freemasonry is a huge one.
[03:52:58.900 --> 03:53:03.900]  Almost every corporate logo that you see that is prevalent is not a word.
[03:53:03.900 --> 03:53:09.900]  Prevalent is can be traced back to some kind of.
[03:53:09.900 --> 03:53:14.900]  Occult symbol. Well, I think part of that is just basic geometry.
[03:53:14.900 --> 03:53:20.900]  I don't think it's all intentionally occult symbols. I do think some of these corporations are probably doing that.
[03:53:20.900 --> 03:53:27.900]  Even the realm of the quote occult, a lot of this symbology just comes from basic universal geometric forms.
[03:53:27.900 --> 03:53:30.900]  So it's not always intentionally quote occultic.
[03:53:30.900 --> 03:53:38.900]  I mean, when Plato was doing, you know, geometric platonic solid analysis, it wasn't because he had some sort of intentionally satanic view.
[03:53:38.900 --> 03:53:42.900]  He just thought that that's how reality was structured because he got this from an older tradition.
[03:53:42.900 --> 03:53:50.900]  So certain companies, I think you're absolutely right, are absolutely more on board with being self-consciously satanic.
[03:53:50.900 --> 03:53:53.900]  And we see that with the choices that they have in advertising.
[03:53:53.900 --> 03:54:02.900]  And it's just it's amazing to me because I, you know, I talked about corporations being and pushing this agenda 15 years ago.
[03:54:02.900 --> 03:54:04.900]  And people would say, oh, were you a communist?
[03:54:04.900 --> 03:54:10.900]  You don't believe in libertarian principles of freedom of speech and companies do whatever they want.
[03:54:10.900 --> 03:54:19.900]  And I was like, no, I'm telling you on a moral basis that these companies, the corporations, the Fortune 500, the Fortune 100 are objectively signed onto an evil agenda.
[03:54:19.900 --> 03:54:24.900]  They're part of the Bilderberg Group. They're part of the CFR, Trilateral Commission, Global Order.
[03:54:24.900 --> 03:54:36.900]  And, you know, people were still divided, you know, 10, 15 years ago into this dialectic between, well, it's the Democrats, it's the Republicans, it's the libertarians and the Ayn Rand people versus the socialists.
[03:54:37.900 --> 03:54:42.900]  All of those are controlled mechanisms. And until you can see that, you're really not going to get anywhere.
[03:54:42.900 --> 03:54:47.900]  You're not going to make any progress. So there's a higher level game being played.
[03:54:47.900 --> 03:54:54.900]  And the religious spheres of these cults and these groups and these the groundswell of these movements, if you read about Tavistock,
[03:54:54.900 --> 03:55:04.900]  then you know that it's pushed from a social engineering perspective on purpose and they do it with full knowledge of what they're doing.
[03:55:04.900 --> 03:55:09.900]  So it's not like there's a secret wizard somewhere that's running the New World Order.
[03:55:09.900 --> 03:55:15.900]  It's social engineers and technocrats who push things because of the effectiveness of what's pushed.
[03:55:15.900 --> 03:55:19.900]  It's not really about the truth or falsity of the systems.
[03:55:19.900 --> 03:55:23.900]  So Tavistock will push these things. Stanford Research will push these things.
[03:55:23.900 --> 03:55:28.900]  Look at changing images of man because they're amenable to the end goal of technocracy.
[03:55:28.900 --> 03:55:30.900]  It's not whether witchcraft is true or false.
[03:55:30.900 --> 03:55:33.900]  It's not whether they really believe in Roman Catholicism and Pope Francis.
[03:55:33.900 --> 03:55:40.900]  It's whether the agenda that's being pushed with Francis, for example, in the Muslim Jewish Christian Faith Center,
[03:55:40.900 --> 03:55:44.900]  this new monotheistic, quote, faith center that they push in Abu Dhabi.
[03:55:44.900 --> 03:55:50.900]  It's whether that fits into the ultimate agenda of what the ultimate power elite technocrat,
[03:55:50.900 --> 03:55:53.900]  royal society people have written about and talked about for so long.
[03:55:53.900 --> 03:55:59.900]  That's what it's really about. So witchcraft, Wicca, this kind of stuff that promotes
[03:55:59.900 --> 03:56:03.900]  and is usually associated with feminism, which is about the destruction of the family
[03:56:03.900 --> 03:56:06.900]  and the promotion of abortion, which is about the reduction of human population.
[03:56:06.900 --> 03:56:11.900]  So simple. So you're caught up in and especially if you're young,
[03:56:11.900 --> 03:56:15.900]  you're not sophisticated enough to understand that these are movements that are used
[03:56:15.900 --> 03:56:21.900]  for much bigger purposes than your, you know, feelies and your empowerment.
[03:56:21.900 --> 03:56:25.900]  It's nothing to do with your empowerment. It's about controlling you.
[03:56:26.900 --> 03:56:28.900]  What do you think?
[03:56:28.900 --> 03:56:35.900]  Yeah, I just feel sorry for all the people that are going to be caught up in this witchcraft craze
[03:56:35.900 --> 03:56:42.900]  and aesthetic for all of the reasons or why they would do it.
[03:56:42.900 --> 03:56:49.900]  But because they feel disempowered, I think, and they don't know where to turn.
[03:56:49.900 --> 03:56:53.900]  Well, and we've had, you know, decades of breakdown.
[03:56:53.900 --> 03:56:58.900]  If you look at the Jaffe Memo, the 1967-68 Jaffe Memo from Rockefeller Foundation
[03:56:58.900 --> 03:57:02.900]  and Planned Parenthood, it talks about the promotion of all these alternative ideas,
[03:57:02.900 --> 03:57:06.900]  alternative systems, alternative living on purpose from the top down.
[03:57:06.900 --> 03:57:09.900]  That was written right in the midst of the 60s counterculture revolution.
[03:57:09.900 --> 03:57:14.900]  It's saying that all the Planned Parenthoods, all of the Population Council,
[03:57:14.900 --> 03:57:17.900]  all of that should be pushing all of these ideas, right?
[03:57:17.900 --> 03:57:20.900]  All of these alternative lifestyles and alternative movements,
[03:57:20.900 --> 03:57:25.900]  including the Skittles agenda, including forced abortions,
[03:57:25.900 --> 03:57:30.900]  all of that should be pushed to reduce the population and to break up families.
[03:57:30.900 --> 03:57:33.900]  That's what this is about. It's robbing you.
[03:57:33.900 --> 03:57:37.900]  The devil comes to steal, kill, and destroy, not to empower you.
[03:57:37.900 --> 03:57:40.900]  It's lying and saying that you're going to be empowered.
[03:57:40.900 --> 03:57:43.900]  This is The Alex Jones Show. Go to the Infowars store and get those products.
[03:57:43.900 --> 03:57:45.900]  This is Jay Dyer.
[03:57:46.900 --> 03:57:50.900]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Infowars Store at Infowars Live
[03:57:50.900 --> 03:57:52.900]  not at a probiotic for more than three years?

[03:58:01.900 --> 03:58:03.900]  They got bought by a libtard company and said,

[03:58:06.900 --> 03:58:12.900]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[03:58:43.900 --> 03:58:50.900]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move
[03:58:50.900 --> 03:58:52.900]  against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:58:52.900 --> 03:58:55.900]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[03:58:55.900 --> 03:58:57.900]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:58:57.900 --> 03:59:00.900]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:59:00.900 --> 03:59:03.900]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:59:03.900 --> 03:59:07.900]  It's the same thing with Infowars, but Infowars is not owned by Fox
[03:59:07.900 --> 03:59:11.900]  or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:59:11.900 --> 03:59:14.900]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:59:14.900 --> 03:59:17.900]  When you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:59:17.900 --> 03:59:21.900]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:59:21.900 --> 03:59:25.900]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:59:25.900 --> 03:59:28.900]  I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
