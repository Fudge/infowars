[00:00.000 --> 00:03.520]  Towards the end of the Vietnam War, there was a saying,
[00:03.520 --> 00:06.800]  the war is over if you want it to be.
[00:06.800 --> 00:10.040]  Well, the coronavirus lockdown and martial law
[00:10.040 --> 00:13.640]  is over if you want it to be.
[00:13.640 --> 00:16.240]  The LA Times and other major publications
[00:16.240 --> 00:19.080]  are reporting what the health departments are putting out
[00:19.080 --> 00:21.720]  in California, that it turns out now
[00:21.720 --> 00:25.240]  they're doing mass testing that the majority of the public
[00:25.240 --> 00:29.400]  that's tested has the antibodies for COVID-19
[00:29.400 --> 00:31.880]  because it's the same antibodies
[00:31.880 --> 00:34.960]  and the same genetic material from people
[00:34.960 --> 00:37.040]  that have had the common cold before
[00:37.040 --> 00:39.480]  because that's what the Corona family is.
[00:39.480 --> 00:41.200]  So here's the footage.
[00:41.200 --> 00:43.000]  These numbers have come out from the health departments.
[00:43.000 --> 00:44.600]  These are confirmed.
[00:44.600 --> 00:46.400]  We've got similar numbers from New York,
[00:46.400 --> 00:48.000]  Texas, other states.
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.760]  But John Roberts, one of the main anchors of Fox today
[00:51.760 --> 00:54.480]  comes walking into the White House briefing room
[00:54.480 --> 00:56.080]  and he tells one of the other reporters,
[00:56.080 --> 01:01.080]  take the mask off, man, it's a hoax, it's 0.1%.
[01:03.320 --> 01:04.880]  We have articles on enforce.com
[01:04.880 --> 01:06.960]  linked to the health department numbers.
[01:06.960 --> 01:11.040]  It's actually lower than one-tenth of 1%.
[01:11.040 --> 01:14.600]  This thing is way weaker than the flu,
[01:14.600 --> 01:19.600]  but the media is hyping it like it is bubonic plague
[01:19.800 --> 01:22.000]  or airborne Ebola.
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.520]  Here is the incredible video
[01:24.520 --> 01:26.960]  that Fox News is confirming is real.
[01:26.960 --> 01:27.800]  Thank you.
[01:27.800 --> 01:28.640]  All right, man.
[01:28.640 --> 01:29.480]  $40,000, baby.
[01:29.480 --> 01:30.440]  You can take out the master.
[01:30.440 --> 01:34.440]  The case fatality rate's at 0.1 to 0.3, according to USC.
[01:34.440 --> 01:35.600]  Is it real?
[01:35.600 --> 01:36.440]  No, you're exaggerating.
[01:36.440 --> 01:37.920]  That's reassuring.
[01:37.920 --> 01:38.760]  USC.
[01:38.760 --> 01:40.520]  Everybody here's been vaccinated anyway.
[01:40.520 --> 01:44.200]  USC and LA County Public Health come up with the study.
[01:44.200 --> 01:47.880]  They found that there are 7,000 cases in California,
[01:47.880 --> 01:50.120]  but they really believe that there are anywhere
[01:50.120 --> 01:54.880]  around 221,000 to 422,000 people who are infected.
[01:54.880 --> 01:55.720]  Really?
[01:55.720 --> 01:56.560]  Yeah.
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.560]  So that makes it 0.1 to 0.3?
[02:00.560 --> 02:02.200]  Does the study even come out like that?
[02:02.200 --> 02:03.400]  Yeah, just give it to them.
[02:05.960 --> 02:10.680]  So it suggests that the case fatality risk is 10,000.
[02:10.680 --> 02:11.680]  What else?
[02:11.680 --> 02:12.920]  Put your right mind before you.
[02:12.920 --> 02:13.760]  Yeah, exactly that.
[02:13.760 --> 02:15.720]  That's what it is.
[02:15.720 --> 02:17.080]  Oh, it's a hoax.
[02:17.080 --> 02:20.200]  A lot of people are going to ask this question.
[02:20.200 --> 02:23.640]  Alex, you said it's a man-made bio weapon out of Wuhan.
[02:23.640 --> 02:26.320]  They're now confirming that 10 weeks after you first
[02:26.320 --> 02:29.320]  broke it with top bio weapons experts,
[02:29.320 --> 02:32.320]  the guy that wrote the US Biological Weapons Law
[02:32.320 --> 02:34.840]  and represents the United Nations.
[02:34.840 --> 02:38.920]  How suddenly are you saying it's a hoax?
[02:38.920 --> 02:42.480]  The mass death numbers are the hoax.
[02:42.480 --> 02:44.960]  The shutdown of society is the hoax.
[02:44.960 --> 02:47.760]  The virus is man-made.
[02:47.760 --> 02:50.840]  The Nobel Prize winner who discovered HIV has said that.
[02:50.840 --> 02:54.040]  Major Indian universities have scanned it and said that.
[02:54.040 --> 02:57.360]  So why is it man-made but still not that deadly?
[02:57.360 --> 03:00.560]  Because the NIH, Bill and Melinda Gates and the Globalist
[03:00.560 --> 03:04.640]  on Record, funded China to do it and make it
[03:04.640 --> 03:07.840]  so that when it got out, it's highly communicable
[03:07.840 --> 03:11.480]  so everybody gets it, everybody gets scared,
[03:11.480 --> 03:13.400]  everybody wants a vaccine.
[03:13.400 --> 03:15.960]  So they own the test for it
[03:15.960 --> 03:18.240]  and they own the procedures to treat it
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.040]  and it's a novel virus, meaning completely new
[03:22.040 --> 03:23.760]  that they control.
[03:23.760 --> 03:27.920]  You see, they could never patent the regular cold virus
[03:27.920 --> 03:29.960]  because there's thousands every year.
[03:29.960 --> 03:31.920]  They could never patent the flu virus
[03:31.920 --> 03:33.520]  because there's thousands every year.
[03:33.520 --> 03:36.280]  So they made a chimera that's got at least
[03:36.280 --> 03:38.080]  five different viruses in it.
[03:39.480 --> 03:42.360]  So that now when you get it,
[03:42.360 --> 03:44.640]  they can scare you and treat you
[03:44.640 --> 03:47.240]  with AZT and other AIDS drugs,
[03:47.240 --> 03:51.440]  which they admit actually kill more people than it helps.
[03:51.440 --> 03:53.800]  So that's why it's man-made.
[03:53.800 --> 03:58.400]  So that when you get tested or positive for the hoax,
[03:58.400 --> 04:01.520]  they can now go to town on you with their chemicals,
[04:01.520 --> 04:03.720]  with their biologicals and try to force you
[04:03.720 --> 04:05.360]  to take a vaccine and try to say,
[04:05.360 --> 04:07.160]  we've all got to have a digital ID
[04:07.160 --> 04:09.720]  tied to the fact that we have antibodies
[04:09.720 --> 04:13.480]  for this novel virus they have created.
[04:13.480 --> 04:16.680]  This is a way to make every human on earth suspect,
[04:16.680 --> 04:18.680]  a way to make every human on earth bad,
[04:18.680 --> 04:21.040]  to make us all wear masks and not trust each other
[04:21.040 --> 04:24.040]  and to make the WHO run by Bill and Melinda Gates,
[04:24.040 --> 04:26.160]  the UN and Communist China,
[04:26.160 --> 04:28.640]  the good guys that are gonna take control
[04:28.640 --> 04:31.960]  of our society and life and order our economy shut down
[04:31.960 --> 04:34.720]  with blue cities and blue states and Hollywood
[04:34.720 --> 04:37.800]  and the media saying President Trump and Alex Jones
[04:37.800 --> 04:41.680]  are terrorists for trying to reopen the economy.
[04:41.680 --> 04:43.600]  This is 21st century war.
[04:43.600 --> 04:45.040]  This is the Psy-Op.
[04:45.040 --> 04:46.520]  But humanity is awakening.
[04:47.400 --> 04:49.360]  This information is being censored on Facebook,
[04:49.360 --> 04:50.600]  Twitter and Google.
[04:50.600 --> 04:54.400]  You at band.video at an enforce.com watching this
[04:54.400 --> 04:56.520]  are the only hope of sharing this video
[04:56.520 --> 04:58.760]  and explaining to people that it's confirmed
[04:58.760 --> 05:00.880]  coronavirus is a China hoax.
[05:00.880 --> 05:03.640]  I don't matter how hard I wanna fight.
[05:03.640 --> 05:06.680]  If other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying,
[05:06.680 --> 05:07.720]  you don't spread the word,
[05:07.720 --> 05:10.280]  you don't buy the products to fund our operation.
[05:10.280 --> 05:12.480]  The dog does it, but you get that.
[05:12.480 --> 05:13.520]  You are patriots.
[05:13.520 --> 05:16.560]  You are people that live and work in the real world
[05:16.560 --> 05:18.760]  of erase color and create and understand what's happening.
[05:18.760 --> 05:20.440]  And that's why when you call in and thank me
[05:20.440 --> 05:22.360]  for what I've done, it's really a sick joke.
[05:22.360 --> 05:24.280]  Thank you for what you've done.
[05:24.280 --> 05:25.320]  We're all of this together.
[05:25.320 --> 05:27.120]  We believe in the rights of the unborn.
[05:27.120 --> 05:28.160]  We believe in families.
[05:28.160 --> 05:29.920]  We believe in the right to self-defense.
[05:29.920 --> 05:32.640]  We believe in capitalism, America and Jesus Christ,
[05:32.640 --> 05:35.320]  number one, and we believe in free speech.
[05:35.320 --> 05:38.160]  And so the fact that you shop with us
[05:38.160 --> 05:39.560]  and the fact that you spread the word
[05:39.560 --> 05:42.320]  about what we're doing does everything in the world.
[05:42.320 --> 05:45.080]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually
[05:45.080 --> 05:47.200]  because the globalists thought they'd have
[05:47.200 --> 05:48.760]  this whole planet sewn up by now.
[05:48.760 --> 05:50.240]  They thought they'd be in charge.
[05:50.240 --> 05:51.200]  They thought they wouldn't want,
[05:51.200 --> 05:54.240]  but they didn't count on you and I and others
[05:54.240 --> 05:55.160]  coming together.
[05:55.160 --> 05:56.520]  So God bless you all.
[05:56.520 --> 06:00.120]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[06:00.120 --> 06:01.440]  You think just let me say it.
[06:01.440 --> 06:04.160]  But even now, orders are being shouted into telephones
[06:04.160 --> 06:06.600]  and men with guns supposed to be on their way.
[06:06.600 --> 06:07.680]  It's chance of settlement.
[06:07.680 --> 06:08.520]  Damn it.
[06:08.520 --> 06:09.520]  Why?
[06:09.520 --> 06:11.520]  Because while the truncheon may be used
[06:11.520 --> 06:16.040]  in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[06:16.040 --> 06:18.040]  Words are for the means to meaning
[06:18.040 --> 06:20.040]  and for those who are not.
[06:20.040 --> 06:23.040]  And so the world is in the hands of God.
[06:23.040 --> 06:26.040]  And so the world is in the hands of God.
[06:26.040 --> 06:28.040]  And so for those who will listen,
[06:28.040 --> 06:31.040]  the enunciation of the truth is here.
[06:31.040 --> 06:35.040]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[06:35.040 --> 06:36.040]  You decided, sir.
[06:36.040 --> 06:37.040]  You wanted it foolproof.
[06:37.040 --> 06:39.040]  You told me every television in longer.
[06:39.040 --> 06:42.040]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[06:42.040 --> 06:44.040]  And where once you have the freedom to object,
[06:44.040 --> 06:46.040]  something can speak as you saw fit.
[06:46.040 --> 06:49.040]  You now have sensors and systems of surveillance
[06:49.040 --> 06:52.040]  coercing your conformity and submitting your submission.
[06:52.040 --> 06:53.040]  We need cameras.
[06:53.040 --> 06:54.040]  How did this happen?
[06:54.040 --> 06:56.040]  Who's to blame?
[06:56.040 --> 06:59.040]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[06:59.040 --> 07:01.040]  They will be held accountable.
[07:01.040 --> 07:04.040]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty,
[07:04.040 --> 07:07.040]  you need only look into a mirror.
[07:07.040 --> 07:09.040]  I know why you did it.
[07:09.040 --> 07:11.040]  I know you were afraid.
[07:11.040 --> 07:12.040]  Who would it be?
[07:12.040 --> 07:15.040]  War, terror, disease?
[07:15.040 --> 07:19.040]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason
[07:19.040 --> 07:21.040]  and rob you of your common sense.
[07:21.040 --> 07:23.040]  Fear got the best of you.
[07:23.040 --> 07:27.040]  And in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[07:27.040 --> 07:29.040]  He promised you order.
[07:29.040 --> 07:30.040]  He promised you peace.
[07:30.040 --> 07:34.040]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[07:41.040 --> 07:42.040]  There is a war.
[07:42.040 --> 07:44.040]  It's happening now.
[07:44.040 --> 07:46.040]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[07:46.040 --> 07:49.040]  The time to choose sides has come.
[07:49.040 --> 07:51.040]  We are the resistance.
[07:51.040 --> 07:54.040]  We are the Info War.
[08:01.040 --> 08:07.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, April 22nd, 2020.
[08:07.040 --> 08:20.040]  And I have news so insanely important that I'm choking right now.
[08:20.040 --> 08:22.040]  I mean, the crew knows this is not theatrics.
[08:22.040 --> 08:25.040]  They've been watching me the last month here.
[08:25.040 --> 08:28.040]  This is so incredible.
[08:28.040 --> 08:33.040]  It's all confirmed.
[08:33.040 --> 08:38.040]  Planetary world government making humans non-essential,
[08:38.040 --> 08:41.040]  cutting us off in the name of protecting us,
[08:41.040 --> 08:44.040]  bankrupting small-town America,
[08:44.040 --> 08:54.040]  and killing hundreds of millions of people.
[08:54.040 --> 08:57.040]  And I don't say this to go, oh, look, I'm so smart.
[08:57.040 --> 08:59.040]  No, no, no, I know the agenda.
[08:59.040 --> 09:02.040]  I'm watching like a slow-motion train wreck,
[09:02.040 --> 09:06.040]  destroying all of our futures.
[09:06.040 --> 09:11.040]  The World Health Organization and the UN World Food Program
[09:11.040 --> 09:19.040]  are the authors and are in command of the global government
[09:19.040 --> 09:25.040]  and always said they bring in world government using a medical tyranny.
[09:25.040 --> 09:28.040]  And behind that are the big megacorporations,
[09:28.040 --> 09:30.040]  big pharma and tax-free operations
[09:30.040 --> 09:37.040]  that are eugenics organizations that want to depopulate.
[09:37.040 --> 09:41.040]  And so I've been harping on the fact that, hey,
[09:41.040 --> 09:44.040]  on average 8 to 12 million people starved to death a year in the world,
[09:44.040 --> 09:47.040]  died malnutrition, a cold bug comes by,
[09:47.040 --> 09:49.040]  a flu bug comes by that wouldn't hurt a healthy person,
[09:49.040 --> 09:55.040]  and it kills somebody that's malnourished.
[09:55.040 --> 09:59.040]  The original British concentration camps were used on the Scots
[09:59.040 --> 10:02.040]  and the Irish, they were invented against the Scots.
[10:02.040 --> 10:04.040]  They weren't called concentration camps officially
[10:04.040 --> 10:10.040]  until the Boor War in South Africa with Winston Churchill
[10:10.040 --> 10:16.040]  riding around on his horse, putting out propaganda dispatches.
[10:16.040 --> 10:25.040]  But these camps are where Andrew Jackson's mother and brother died
[10:25.040 --> 10:28.040]  and they just put you in them and they don't kill you,
[10:28.040 --> 10:32.040]  they just don't give you anything but bread and water once a day.
[10:32.040 --> 10:35.040]  And on average, most people are dead in about a month,
[10:35.040 --> 10:39.040]  but you feel good and you give them a piece of bread,
[10:39.040 --> 10:43.040]  you give them a cup of water and then they just shrivel up,
[10:43.040 --> 10:47.040]  lay down on the ground and then die.
[10:47.040 --> 10:51.040]  And so I was saying from numbers I saw three weeks ago
[10:51.040 --> 10:54.040]  that about 2 million people are starving to death right now
[10:54.040 --> 10:56.040]  or dying in the next month.
[10:56.040 --> 10:59.040]  From the numbers I saw, just out of India,
[10:59.040 --> 11:02.040]  it was 2 million, so I just went with that one country.
[11:02.040 --> 11:06.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, the numbers are now in from the UN themselves
[11:06.040 --> 11:14.040]  who again orchestrate this and then ask for power and control.
[11:14.040 --> 11:20.040]  30 million are starving to death on top of the 10 million right now.
[11:20.040 --> 11:24.040]  That's the Globe and Mail, the big Canadian paper.
[11:24.040 --> 11:29.040]  Again, the magnitude of that.
[11:29.040 --> 11:32.040]  So last night I see my son driving down a side road,
[11:32.040 --> 11:37.040]  he doesn't live with me, he's grown up, he's moved out now at 17.
[11:37.040 --> 11:43.040]  He flags me, I say pull in here and we pull in to a strip center
[11:43.040 --> 11:47.040]  and we're not parked in the front row, we're parked in a side row
[11:47.040 --> 11:51.040]  about 30 feet from a liquor store from a tanning place
[11:51.040 --> 11:55.040]  and from an AT&T store, in fact, we're parked kind of by the AT&T store,
[11:55.040 --> 11:57.040]  maybe 40 feet from the liquor store.
[11:57.040 --> 12:00.040]  And I see guys with masks putting boxes out front of it
[12:00.040 --> 12:03.040]  and one of them looks at me and says, put your mask on,
[12:03.040 --> 12:06.040]  but from a distance I can see what he was saying.
[12:06.040 --> 12:09.040]  So I talk to my son, he walks over with me,
[12:09.040 --> 12:11.040]  and I think to shoot footage of this on my phone,
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.040]  and I go, yeah dude, I'm not trying to come in and buy your liquor,
[12:15.040 --> 12:17.040]  he goes, well still you need to wear a mask.
[12:17.040 --> 12:20.040]  So I start talking and people come out of the store and they go,
[12:20.040 --> 12:22.040]  oh Alex Jones or something, and they go, yeah, it's all fraud.
[12:22.040 --> 12:27.040]  Did you see John Roberts today saying it's 0.1% dying?
[12:27.040 --> 12:31.040]  And I said, yeah, that's what a lot of the numbers are showing.
[12:31.040 --> 12:34.040]  We'll go over that in a moment, it's beyond bombshell.
[12:34.040 --> 12:38.040]  So there were the three people in the liquor store coming out
[12:38.040 --> 12:43.040]  when I'm arguing with a guy who's telling me from 30, 40 feet away,
[12:43.040 --> 12:44.040]  hey, put your mask on.
[12:44.040 --> 12:47.040]  I guess he thought I was coming in the liquor store.
[12:47.040 --> 12:52.040]  And so I started trying to show the guy the video, he didn't want to see it.
[12:52.040 --> 12:54.040]  And he had this power trip looking his eye.
[12:54.040 --> 12:58.040]  And I said, you're pathetic, you're being dog trained to submit
[12:58.040 --> 13:00.040]  and all this six foot separation.
[13:00.040 --> 13:03.040]  They're coming out with microchips, they're coming out with forced inoculations.
[13:03.040 --> 13:09.040]  This is all a setup for medical tyranny and you're a fool.
[13:09.040 --> 13:12.040]  And that guy started laughing at me.
[13:12.040 --> 13:16.040]  And so I just said, listen, I'm not putting you down, you work at a liquor store.
[13:16.040 --> 13:20.040]  But there's a reason I'm successful and there's a reason you're not.
[13:20.040 --> 13:25.040]  You are a willful moron.
[13:25.040 --> 13:31.040]  Had another guy in a gas station the day before that, pull that crap.
[13:31.040 --> 13:33.040]  So that's the reality of where we are.
[13:33.040 --> 13:35.040]  If you're wearing a mask, I'm not judging you.
[13:35.040 --> 13:38.040]  In fact, we ordered a bunch of masks that are coming in next week.
[13:38.040 --> 13:40.040]  So you can pre-order them now.
[13:40.040 --> 13:42.040]  That are a nice black mask with infowars.com on them.
[13:42.040 --> 13:46.040]  And if you, in the future, they're saying, we're, this is going to go forever now.
[13:46.040 --> 13:47.040]  Watch.
[13:47.040 --> 13:48.040]  It's submission.
[13:48.040 --> 13:52.040]  So if you got to get on an airplane and you got to go in the grocery store, hey,
[13:52.040 --> 13:55.040]  a light comfortable cloth one that you can breathe through.
[13:55.040 --> 13:59.040]  Go along with the Kabuki theater, the submission, but fight back while you're at it
[13:59.040 --> 14:03.040]  and shoot your mouth off the whole time.
[14:03.040 --> 14:06.040]  Limited edition COVID-19 hoax mask.
[14:06.040 --> 14:08.040]  I told them to put hoax on the page.
[14:08.040 --> 14:09.040]  They didn't.
[14:09.040 --> 14:13.040]  The listeners are like, well, wait, you're saying it's a hoax, but you're not.
[14:13.040 --> 14:15.040]  But you're selling a mask.
[14:15.040 --> 14:17.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a real virus.
[14:17.040 --> 14:19.040]  It kills people just like the flu.
[14:19.040 --> 14:24.040]  But the height to say no one could ever die from the flu or from a cold bug again.
[14:24.040 --> 14:26.040]  And this idea, it's like mass shootings.
[14:26.040 --> 14:28.040]  Again, I said this a thousand times.
[14:28.040 --> 14:32.040]  Even Bill Maher came on Friday and said, he said mass shootings are terrible,
[14:32.040 --> 14:35.040]  but they only kill about 100 people a year.
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.040]  Well, he goes, it's the same thing with this.
[14:38.040 --> 14:40.040]  The flu is terrible, colds are terrible.
[14:40.040 --> 14:42.040]  It kills a lot of old people, but that's what's always happened.
[14:42.040 --> 14:44.040]  You can't protect people.
[14:44.040 --> 14:46.040]  And that's where it gets crazy.
[14:46.040 --> 14:52.040]  A vaccine, they admit won't even protect you from it.
[14:52.040 --> 14:54.040]  So why are they doing it?
[14:54.040 --> 14:56.040]  And now they admit there's hundreds of mutations of it.
[14:56.040 --> 14:58.040]  So why would one for one mutation?
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.040]  Because it's what's in there and it's a digital vaccine with an ink.
[15:03.040 --> 15:04.040]  They're rolling out.
[15:04.040 --> 15:07.040]  This has been announced where you will then buy and sell off that.
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.040]  They will put credits on to your body because you've taken the shot.
[15:12.040 --> 15:19.040]  They're going to pay you to take DNA vaccines that actually change your body's DNA.
[15:19.040 --> 15:20.040]  They have a name for that.
[15:20.040 --> 15:21.040]  It's called cancer.
[15:21.040 --> 15:28.040]  So Bill Gates, who openly says he wants to reduce population, is coming with that virus.
[15:28.040 --> 15:33.040]  They transferred to China that they allowed to be released against us with total surveillance,
[15:33.040 --> 15:35.040]  drones flying around controlling everybody.
[15:35.040 --> 15:36.040]  It's incredible.
[15:36.040 --> 15:42.040]  But the big news, the giant or incredible news, call everyone you know, don't tune in.
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.040]  We're going to cover on the other side of this quick break.
[15:45.040 --> 15:47.040]  This is so important.
[15:47.040 --> 15:50.040]  Wait till we cover this.
[15:50.040 --> 16:19.040]  It is Earth Shaking.
[16:20.040 --> 16:22.040]  See them now at survivalistcamps.com.
[16:22.040 --> 16:24.040]  That's survivalistcamps.com.
[16:24.040 --> 16:53.040]  Trust your family's survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[16:54.040 --> 17:20.040]  Thank you.
[17:20.040 --> 17:46.040]  Thank you.
[17:46.040 --> 18:12.040]  Thank you.
[18:12.040 --> 18:38.040]  Thank you.
[18:38.040 --> 19:04.040]  Thank you.
[19:04.040 --> 19:30.040]  Thank you.
[19:30.040 --> 19:59.040]  Thank you.
[20:01.040 --> 20:29.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:29.040 --> 20:30.040]  Welcome back.
[20:30.040 --> 20:34.040]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and we're committing a thought crime here according to Google,
[20:34.040 --> 20:37.040]  Facebook, Twitter, the United Nations, CNN.
[20:37.040 --> 20:42.040]  They're all over the news saying questioning the deaths, questioning the numbers.
[20:42.040 --> 20:45.040]  A saying zinc is good for you and antiviral.
[20:45.040 --> 20:46.040]  None of it is allowed.
[20:46.040 --> 20:52.040]  Facebook's working with state governments to try to ban anybody and block any protest
[20:52.040 --> 20:54.040]  who are demanding reopen America.
[20:54.040 --> 20:59.040]  You don't go out in protest and demonstrate and say that you're an American.
[20:59.040 --> 21:01.040]  You don't go out and exercise your right of assembly.
[21:01.040 --> 21:04.040]  You stay in your house.
[21:04.040 --> 21:07.040]  Like this is communist China.
[21:07.040 --> 21:12.040]  Now, the most viral video out there that I've seen in a long time happened yesterday
[21:12.040 --> 21:14.040]  before a White House press briefing.
[21:14.040 --> 21:24.040]  John Roberts, very popular host and talk show host and reporter for Fox News for over a decade.
[21:24.040 --> 21:28.040]  He walks in an hour before the press conference starts and he sees everybody fear mongering,
[21:28.040 --> 21:34.040]  wearing masks, getting into the Kabuki theater, getting into the fear, getting into the dog training.
[21:34.040 --> 21:43.040]  He witnesses this and he says, hey, it's 0, it's 0.01%.
[21:43.040 --> 21:49.040]  There's 400 plus thousand people in LA County, the health department's reporting.
[21:49.040 --> 21:52.040]  And there's only 600 to something dead.
[21:52.040 --> 21:55.040]  And I looked up the numbers today.
[21:55.040 --> 21:58.040]  663 that may have died from coronavirus.
[21:58.040 --> 22:04.040]  They had a test, a positive test for coronavirus.
[22:04.040 --> 22:06.040]  So they may have died from it.
[22:06.040 --> 22:16.040]  663 people out of their estimates from what they've been testing now, 400,000 or more have had it.
[22:16.040 --> 22:18.040]  663.
[22:18.040 --> 22:30.040]  Now, if you go to the calculator.net, when you put 663 into 400,000, you get 663 divided 400,000 equals,
[22:30.040 --> 22:33.040]  and then there's the number right there.
[22:33.040 --> 22:49.040]  0.0016575 equals 0., there's your final number, 0.16575.
[22:49.040 --> 23:00.040]  So you do your own math with that, but that is not even close to 1%.
[23:00.040 --> 23:11.040]  0.16, 0.16.
[23:11.040 --> 23:18.040]  So that's 16% of 1% death rate.
[23:18.040 --> 23:21.040]  And you can have a lot of fun with that math.
[23:21.040 --> 23:24.040]  And there's all these people that don't want you to look at these numbers.
[23:24.040 --> 23:34.040]  But let's say, as they continue to test, that we find out that number even goes down.
[23:34.040 --> 23:37.040]  Or maybe some of the people that test positive later die.
[23:37.040 --> 23:38.040]  Maybe it goes up.
[23:38.040 --> 23:43.040]  Maybe it goes up to 0.2%, maybe 0.3%.
[23:43.040 --> 23:47.040]  That's still below the flu for old people.
[23:47.040 --> 23:52.040]  Because when you enter that into the number, that it's almost universal,
[23:52.040 --> 23:56.040]  that it's people with preexisting conditions or who are super old above 85 years of age.
[23:56.040 --> 24:00.040]  It's the same all over the world.
[24:00.040 --> 24:02.040]  Now, the virus is attacking men's testicles.
[24:02.040 --> 24:04.040]  And of course, that's the real design of it.
[24:04.040 --> 24:05.040]  It is a chimera.
[24:05.040 --> 24:07.040]  It is a bio weapon.
[24:07.040 --> 24:11.040]  So Bill and Melinda Gates can own the vaccine and own the response to it.
[24:11.040 --> 24:15.040]  Because you can't have a vaccine for a regular cold virus because there's thousands of new ones a year.
[24:15.040 --> 24:19.040]  So you got to have something that's a novel so you can claim you've got a treatment for it,
[24:19.040 --> 24:20.040]  even though that's a fraud.
[24:20.040 --> 24:26.040]  And that answer is why they released the bio weapon.
[24:26.040 --> 24:29.040]  So let's walk through it.
[24:29.040 --> 24:32.040]  And let's talk about how huge this is.
[24:32.040 --> 24:39.040]  The UN itself says an extra 30 million people are starving to death on top of the 10 million that die every year.
[24:39.040 --> 24:46.040]  So they're talking about, in official press releases, from the World Food Program,
[24:46.040 --> 24:52.040]  30 million people dying instead of 10 million people dying.
[24:52.040 --> 24:54.040]  And there's millions dying right now.
[24:54.040 --> 24:55.040]  But see, they're not human.
[24:55.040 --> 24:59.040]  They're not cool, wearing masks at all, chic.
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.040]  And because they're really non-essential of the New World War.
[25:02.040 --> 25:07.040]  And so everyone's being herded and prepared for microchips, for drone surveillance,
[25:07.040 --> 25:12.040]  for total control, for world IDs, for medical IDs, for medical passports.
[25:12.040 --> 25:13.040]  It's all being announced.
[25:13.040 --> 25:16.040]  There's no debating it.
[25:16.040 --> 25:18.040]  The robot suppression system.
[25:18.040 --> 25:25.040]  Chinese made drones and face scanning now being used in California and New York and other blue states.
[25:25.040 --> 25:30.040]  This is their globalist revolution to cut the carbon, to kill the industrial state,
[25:30.040 --> 25:32.040]  to make you poor and to make you austere.
[25:32.040 --> 25:33.040]  This is their admitted plan.
[25:33.040 --> 25:34.040]  They're all over the news.
[25:34.040 --> 25:37.040]  The Pope says, we are dying because we're evil.
[25:37.040 --> 25:38.040]  We deserve this.
[25:38.040 --> 25:40.040]  Capitalism is wasteful.
[25:40.040 --> 25:41.040]  The Earth is doing this.
[25:41.040 --> 25:48.040]  You're hearing the whole UN, Gaia, world government speech that we deserve this from the Hollywood trash
[25:48.040 --> 25:57.040]  and everybody else that are the same ones saying, shut everything down to save lives.
[25:57.040 --> 26:04.040]  But they are the ones that are always telling us they want to get rid of the population
[26:04.040 --> 26:05.040]  and kill the old people.
[26:05.040 --> 26:10.040]  So this is an incredible moment to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:10.040 --> 26:12.040]  And here's what's going to happen.
[26:12.040 --> 26:16.040]  As they test more people, you're going to see that death rate go down,
[26:16.040 --> 26:19.040]  which we predicted months ago and it's now happening.
[26:19.040 --> 26:26.040]  And we're going to find out that people are having an autoimmune response to the virus and to other viruses.
[26:26.040 --> 26:32.040]  A lot of times it turned out the flu and they would put a respirator on you and blow your lungs out and kill you with them.
[26:32.040 --> 26:34.040]  And now they admit what doctors said a month ago.
[26:34.040 --> 26:35.040]  Don't put them on respirators.
[26:35.040 --> 26:43.040]  They're having an autoimmune response, put them on the same thing you'd give somebody when they get stung by a bee,
[26:43.040 --> 26:46.040]  an EpiPen or prescription Benadryl.
[26:46.040 --> 26:47.040]  And it works like a charm.
[26:47.040 --> 26:50.040]  But see, the hospitals are saying, oh, no, don't do that.
[26:50.040 --> 26:51.040]  That's not the treatment.
[26:51.040 --> 26:53.040]  It has to be UN approved.
[26:53.040 --> 26:59.040]  The UN has to tell our doctors and our president, our country how to live and what to do.
[26:59.040 --> 27:05.040]  So let's go out to break with John Roberts and the super viral clip that you've got to send everybody.
[27:05.040 --> 27:06.040]  It's on infowars.com.
[27:06.040 --> 27:07.040]  It's on man dot video.
[27:07.040 --> 27:08.040]  I shot a report around it.
[27:08.040 --> 27:10.040]  It's five minutes long that really encapsulates it.
[27:10.040 --> 27:14.040]  I think perfectly the whole game plan.
[27:14.040 --> 27:17.040]  But but here's here's John Roberts.
[27:17.040 --> 27:29.040]  All right, man.
[27:29.040 --> 27:30.040]  Everybody here's been vaccinated anyway.
[27:30.040 --> 27:37.040]  USC and LA County Public Health come up with a study that found that there are 7,000 cases in California.
[27:37.040 --> 27:44.040]  But they really believe that there are anywhere from 221,400 to 2,000 people who were infected.
[27:44.040 --> 27:45.040]  Really?
[27:45.040 --> 27:46.040]  Yeah.
[27:46.040 --> 27:49.040]  So that makes it 0.1 to 0.3?
[27:49.040 --> 27:50.040]  Yeah.
[27:50.040 --> 27:52.040]  There's a study to get out there today.
[27:52.040 --> 27:55.040]  Yeah, just give it to them.
[27:55.040 --> 27:58.040]  So it suggests that the patient is out of here.
[27:58.040 --> 27:59.040]  10.
[27:59.040 --> 28:01.040]  It seems to me.
[28:01.040 --> 28:02.040]  What else?
[28:02.040 --> 28:03.040]  What's your right mind with the three?
[28:03.040 --> 28:04.040]  Yeah, exactly that.
[28:04.040 --> 28:05.040]  That's what it is.
[28:05.040 --> 28:07.040]  Oh, it was a hoax.
[28:07.040 --> 28:09.040]  I don't know if it was a hoax.
[28:09.040 --> 28:18.040]  All right, folks.
[28:18.040 --> 28:19.040]  So there you go.
[28:19.040 --> 28:20.040]  That's what's going on.
[28:20.040 --> 28:22.040]  Of course, the Internet comes out and says that's fake.
[28:22.040 --> 28:23.040]  No, that's real.
[28:23.040 --> 28:24.040]  John Roberts has confirmed it.
[28:24.040 --> 28:25.040]  That was a live feed.
[28:25.040 --> 28:29.040]  It's picked up and sold by hundreds of thousands already tuned in.
[28:29.040 --> 28:34.040]  And historic moment, Fox News admits COVID-19 is a giant hoax.
[28:34.040 --> 28:36.040]  The video is at man.video.
[28:36.040 --> 28:37.040]  Share it, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:37.040 --> 28:40.040]  Because then we explain how it's a hoax, why it's a hoax,
[28:40.040 --> 28:43.040]  what they're trying to do, and how you can counter it.
[28:43.040 --> 28:46.040]  We have cracked the code at man.video.
[28:46.040 --> 28:47.040]  Get it out.
[28:47.040 --> 28:49.040]  If you don't want to have a total depression,
[28:49.040 --> 28:50.040]  force an oculation.
[28:50.040 --> 28:51.040]  You've got to move.
[28:51.040 --> 28:53.040]  You've got to take action.
[28:53.040 --> 28:55.040]  Come with me if you want to live.
[28:55.040 --> 29:00.040]  Seriously, folks, this is real.
[29:00.040 --> 29:03.040]  House flies defecate every four to five minutes,
[29:03.040 --> 29:05.040]  spreading diseases and germs.

[29:29.040 --> 29:31.040]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[29:31.040 --> 29:33.040]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[29:33.040 --> 29:34.040]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[29:34.040 --> 29:36.040]  I sued the IRS in one.
[29:36.040 --> 29:39.040]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[29:39.040 --> 29:41.040]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[29:41.040 --> 29:43.040]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[29:43.040 --> 29:45.040]  they thought might never be solved.
[29:45.040 --> 29:46.040]  I can help you too.
[29:46.040 --> 29:49.040]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[29:49.040 --> 29:51.040]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[29:51.040 --> 29:54.040]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website,
[29:54.040 --> 29:59.040]  danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[29:59.040 --> 30:04.040]  What are champions made of?
[30:04.040 --> 30:06.040]  Here's a man who can show you.
[30:06.040 --> 30:32.040]  No!
[30:32.040 --> 31:00.040]  How do you put a people under house arrest?
[31:00.040 --> 31:02.040]  How do you put a people under house arrest?
[31:02.040 --> 31:04.040]  How do you put them under siege?
[31:04.040 --> 31:07.040]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus
[31:07.040 --> 31:10.040]  that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state
[31:10.040 --> 31:12.040]  and then had China release
[31:12.040 --> 31:14.040]  to then take down the populist president
[31:14.040 --> 31:16.040]  and those pesky American people
[31:16.040 --> 31:18.040]  that have become too uppity.
[31:18.040 --> 31:20.040]  Bill Maher even admitted it.
[31:20.040 --> 31:22.040]  Man, I hope we have a depression.
[31:22.040 --> 31:24.040]  Now they've tailored the whole thing
[31:24.040 --> 31:26.040]  where the big corporations and the media
[31:26.040 --> 31:29.040]  are gonna keep the country closed
[31:29.040 --> 31:31.040]  along with the help of the blue cities and blue states
[31:31.040 --> 31:33.040]  all the time blaming Trump
[31:33.040 --> 31:35.040]  and capitalism and Americanism
[31:35.040 --> 31:37.040]  for the depression it creates.
[31:37.040 --> 31:39.040]  If America is that stupid,
[31:39.040 --> 31:41.040]  we deserve what happens to us.
[31:41.040 --> 31:43.040]  But as for me, I'm not sitting here
[31:43.040 --> 31:45.040]  and I'm not taking it.
[31:45.040 --> 31:47.040]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure
[31:47.040 --> 31:49.040]  that they're the good people keeping everybody safe.
[31:49.040 --> 31:51.040]  But that's not what they're doing.
[31:51.040 --> 31:53.040]  They are pulling America up by its roots
[31:53.040 --> 31:55.040]  and irrevocably damaging our savings,
[31:55.040 --> 31:57.040]  our health, our whole world
[31:57.040 --> 31:59.040]  and committing millions of third-world people to death.
[32:27.040 --> 32:31.040]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, you goo,
[32:31.040 --> 32:33.040]  but it's high quality and aerosolizes it
[32:33.040 --> 32:35.040]  in a really great way.
[32:35.040 --> 32:37.040]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[32:37.040 --> 32:39.040]  It's got organic alcohol in it,
[32:39.040 --> 32:41.040]  so spray it right in your eyes.
[32:41.040 --> 32:43.040]  But I just love it personally
[32:43.040 --> 32:45.040]  as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[32:45.040 --> 32:47.040]  So, this is a real innovation.
[32:47.040 --> 32:49.040]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out
[32:49.040 --> 32:51.040]  with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[32:51.040 --> 32:53.040]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out
[32:53.040 --> 32:55.040]  and smells great.
[32:55.040 --> 32:58.040]  So refreshing, this is a big winner.
[33:25.040 --> 33:27.040]  Alex Jones.
[33:27.040 --> 33:29.040]  The far-right conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[33:35.040 --> 33:37.040]  Alex Jones.
[33:39.040 --> 33:41.040]  Scott.
[33:41.040 --> 33:43.040]  Russian.
[33:43.040 --> 33:45.040]  Scott.
[33:45.040 --> 33:47.040]  Until war comes to mind.
[33:51.040 --> 33:53.040]  Reputation's amazing.
[33:53.040 --> 33:56.040]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[33:59.040 --> 34:02.040]  Can you imagine what would be happening
[34:02.040 --> 34:04.040]  if Hillary Clinton was president today?
[34:04.040 --> 34:06.040]  They would be carrying out this exact same plan,
[34:06.040 --> 34:08.040]  except it'd be ten times worse
[34:08.040 --> 34:11.040]  because you wouldn't have Trump in there trying to block it,
[34:11.040 --> 34:13.040]  trying to reason with the American people
[34:13.040 --> 34:15.040]  to not be hysterical and to not give in to the fear.
[34:15.040 --> 34:17.040]  But they didn't do that.
[34:17.040 --> 34:19.040]  So the president then had to ride the wave,
[34:19.040 --> 34:21.040]  or he would have been destroyed,
[34:21.040 --> 34:23.040]  and that was the trap that was set.
[34:23.040 --> 34:25.040]  But the next part of the trap is destroy the economy,
[34:25.040 --> 34:27.040]  which they've basically already done.
[34:27.040 --> 34:30.040]  Crude oil's never been at zero,
[34:30.040 --> 34:32.040]  and now it's negative.
[34:32.040 --> 34:35.040]  And sweet crude and processed crude
[34:35.040 --> 34:37.040]  is on its way down to zero.
[34:37.040 --> 34:40.040]  That's called cardiac arrest
[34:40.040 --> 34:42.040]  in the economy.
[34:42.040 --> 34:45.040]  And it's irrevocable if it's not turned around in weeks,
[34:45.040 --> 34:49.040]  and a lot of estimates are it can't be done now.
[34:49.040 --> 34:54.040]  So this is the globalist plan for total dependency.
[34:54.040 --> 34:56.040]  Now, the good news is here,
[34:56.040 --> 34:58.040]  most people won't starve to death in the U.S.
[34:58.040 --> 35:01.040]  But in the third world, it is a death sentence,
[35:01.040 --> 35:04.040]  and my family has said they've never seen me this upset.
[35:04.040 --> 35:06.040]  The crews never seen me this upset.
[35:06.040 --> 35:08.040]  I'm not a bleeding heart.
[35:08.040 --> 35:10.040]  Meaning I'm a tough guy.
[35:10.040 --> 35:13.040]  I physically am ill
[35:13.040 --> 35:16.040]  over the tens of millions starving to death right now
[35:16.040 --> 35:19.040]  because metaphysically, I know I'm next,
[35:19.040 --> 35:20.040]  and my family's next,
[35:20.040 --> 35:23.040]  and God is pissed at me for not doing more
[35:23.040 --> 35:25.040]  and not being stronger.
[35:25.040 --> 35:28.040]  And I'm normally in good stead with the big guy,
[35:28.040 --> 35:31.040]  and God is really pissed at me right now.
[35:31.040 --> 35:34.040]  And I have been praying a lot,
[35:34.040 --> 35:36.040]  and I've been understanding what has to happen,
[35:36.040 --> 35:38.040]  and God is literally telling me,
[35:38.040 --> 35:40.040]  Jones, you better start civil disobedience,
[35:40.040 --> 35:42.040]  and you better do it now.
[35:42.040 --> 35:44.040]  And I was told a month ago,
[35:44.040 --> 35:46.040]  you go out and demonstrate we're going to take your kids.
[35:46.040 --> 35:48.040]  Well, I went out and I did it, and it's been national news,
[35:48.040 --> 35:50.040]  and they're trying to take them right now
[35:50.040 --> 35:52.040]  about the grace of God it hadn't happened.
[35:52.040 --> 35:54.040]  But it doesn't matter, they're going to take my kids anyways
[35:54.040 --> 35:56.040]  into the new world order if I don't do this.
[35:56.040 --> 35:59.040]  And I'm not up here shooting my mouth off like I'm a tough guy.
[35:59.040 --> 36:04.040]  They're killing 30 million people right now.
[36:04.040 --> 36:06.040]  I said 2 million a few weeks ago with the numbers I had.
[36:06.040 --> 36:09.040]  Now it's 30 million dying!
[36:09.040 --> 36:13.040]  Ha!
[36:13.040 --> 36:16.040]  It's not a bleeding heart that I'm virtue signaling.
[36:16.040 --> 36:18.040]  I am not even getting chills right now.
[36:18.040 --> 36:21.040]  I have been getting on fire.
[36:21.040 --> 36:23.040]  And men especially know what it feels like
[36:23.040 --> 36:25.040]  when you feel like you're on fire.
[36:25.040 --> 36:30.040]  I used to only feel like that when I was fighting for my life.
[36:30.040 --> 36:33.040]  Opening huge cans of kick-ass.
[36:33.040 --> 36:35.040]  And that's not good, folks.
[36:35.040 --> 36:40.040]  That's savage caveman instincts turning on
[36:40.040 --> 36:46.040]  because my intellect and my soul is danger, Will Robinson.
[36:46.040 --> 36:49.040]  Notice just suddenly, it's flash.
[36:49.040 --> 36:52.040]  Even Joel Scalzen thought they'd have World War III first before this.
[36:52.040 --> 36:54.040]  And he's like, no, he was wrong.
[36:54.040 --> 36:56.040]  Because they just suddenly did that move, man.
[36:56.040 --> 37:01.040]  They always said, we're launching the new world order in 2020.
[37:01.040 --> 37:03.040]  David Rockefeller said it in the 70s.
[37:03.040 --> 37:05.040]  Strobe Talbot said it in the 90s.
[37:05.040 --> 37:07.040]  They always said, 2020, 2020.
[37:07.040 --> 37:10.040]  We will have a new world order by 2020,
[37:10.040 --> 37:14.040]  but we'll pay for it in blood and money.
[37:14.040 --> 37:18.040]  That's like, that's Senate testimony.
[37:22.040 --> 37:24.040]  In the 80s.
[37:26.040 --> 37:29.040]  Oh, and let me just tell you something.
[37:29.040 --> 37:35.040]  The globalists admit that they put garbage in to create garbage out.
[37:35.040 --> 37:38.040]  So they try to dump things down like, well, wait a minute,
[37:38.040 --> 37:40.040]  the virus is man-made in a bio weapon,
[37:40.040 --> 37:43.040]  but you're saying it's a hoax that it's not that deadly.
[37:46.040 --> 37:50.040]  But then you're saying it's mutating and it targets the testicles.
[37:50.040 --> 37:53.040]  Next segment, I'll lay that out.
[37:53.040 --> 37:56.040]  This virus is super bad.
[37:56.040 --> 37:59.040]  But not in the ways we've been told.
[37:59.040 --> 38:02.040]  And I foresaw this 10, 11 weeks ago and it's all come out.
[38:02.040 --> 38:04.040]  Because I already knew about their weapons programs,
[38:04.040 --> 38:05.040]  the type of stuff they do.
[38:05.040 --> 38:07.040]  They don't like hard kills.
[38:09.040 --> 38:13.040]  They like soft kills, but they have their lower level folks are in on it.
[38:13.040 --> 38:16.040]  They go, oh, we're just going to kill the really old that are weighing down the system.
[38:16.040 --> 38:19.040]  It's the death panel and people that are already really, really sick.
[38:19.040 --> 38:22.040]  And so it does have that level in its first attack.
[38:22.040 --> 38:25.040]  But then it sits in the body and does a bunch of other stuff.
[38:25.040 --> 38:28.040]  And so they don't want you to know that a vaccine in all the studies
[38:28.040 --> 38:31.040]  will lower your immunity to the mutations of it.
[38:31.040 --> 38:34.040]  And they don't want you to know that it's nutrition and sunlight and water
[38:34.040 --> 38:35.040]  and getting healthy.
[38:35.040 --> 38:37.040]  That is basically a total defense.
[38:40.040 --> 38:43.040]  At every level, they're trying to block people having an understanding.
[38:43.040 --> 38:45.040]  And it's just the sinisterness of it.
[38:45.040 --> 38:52.040]  And every angle pre-programmed and war game in all these different globalist disease X thrills
[38:52.040 --> 39:01.040]  and lockstep drills and event 201 drills and the smirking and the laughing
[39:01.040 --> 39:04.040]  and the giggling on Ted TV when he says the equation,
[39:04.040 --> 39:08.040]  we got to get humans to zero to save the earth and the crowd laughs
[39:08.040 --> 39:11.040]  because they're in on it.
[39:15.040 --> 39:20.040]  By 1966, in places like University of Texas,
[39:20.040 --> 39:25.040]  they were openly taking the top students in the country and teaching them
[39:25.040 --> 39:28.040]  about the eugenics world government takeover.
[39:31.040 --> 39:34.040]  This is a cult of mad scientists.
[39:34.040 --> 39:36.040]  They're taking over.
[39:36.040 --> 39:39.040]  They think you're a useful eater.
[39:39.040 --> 39:43.040]  Bill Joy wrote about it in 1999 and why the future doesn't need us,
[39:43.040 --> 39:44.040]  Wired Magazine.
[39:44.040 --> 39:47.040]  How he went to the meeting with the top billionaires,
[39:47.040 --> 39:52.040]  they made the decision to entertain you, dumb you down, stun you and then kill you.
[39:52.040 --> 39:54.040]  Theodore Kaczynski was in the CIA.
[39:54.040 --> 39:55.040]  He was briefed on all this.
[39:55.040 --> 39:56.040]  He thought it was horrible.
[39:56.040 --> 39:58.040]  He started bombing people.
[39:58.040 --> 40:00.040]  He knew we're involved in it.
[40:00.040 --> 40:02.040]  He's in a supermax prison.
[40:08.040 --> 40:09.040]  All right, I'm going to go to break it.
[40:09.040 --> 40:13.040]  As I said, I'll come back and get into this.
[40:13.040 --> 40:14.040]  So it's a paradox.
[40:14.040 --> 40:18.040]  You need to boost your immune system and your body's defenses all the time.
[40:18.040 --> 40:22.040]  And yes, I sell and promote things that keep us on air that I know are good,
[40:22.040 --> 40:24.040]  that you like, that are good for your family.
[40:24.040 --> 40:26.040]  If you don't get storeable foods,
[40:26.040 --> 40:32.040]  and if you don't get a backup plan while you still can, you are insane.
[40:32.040 --> 40:35.040]  And you got the money to go to the grocery store while you can
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.040]  and stock up and fill up your pantry and fill up your garage with stuff that saves
[40:38.040 --> 40:39.040]  more power to you.
[40:39.040 --> 40:41.040]  But that stuff's four or five times more expensive
[40:41.040 --> 40:43.040]  than the high quality storeable food that we have.
[40:43.040 --> 40:45.040]  It's now back in stock again.
[40:45.040 --> 40:51.040]  And I just ordered more food yesterday because I got to take care of family.
[40:51.040 --> 40:54.040]  And I remember telling family, hey, you better get more than a couple of months.
[40:54.040 --> 40:56.040]  They're like, oh, Alex, it'll be back in two weeks.
[40:56.040 --> 40:57.040]  I said BS.
[40:57.040 --> 40:59.040]  It's never turning back on.
[40:59.040 --> 41:02.040]  My own family won't listen to me, even though they're smart.
[41:02.040 --> 41:03.040]  And so yeah, it's symbiotic.
[41:03.040 --> 41:06.040]  This funds our operation.
[41:06.040 --> 41:08.040]  The suicide mission I'm on.
[41:08.040 --> 41:10.040]  But we're all in a suicide mission.
[41:10.040 --> 41:11.040]  We don't turn this around.
[41:11.040 --> 41:13.040]  So I feel good doing this.
[41:13.040 --> 41:16.040]  But I'm just telling you, from the bottom of my heart, you need horrible food.
[41:16.040 --> 41:17.040]  We've got the best.
[41:17.040 --> 41:18.040]  They've got it.
[41:18.040 --> 41:19.040]  They're packaging it.
[41:19.040 --> 41:20.040]  They're getting it out to people.
[41:20.040 --> 41:24.040]  And I'm ashamed that most of the other companies, I say most because there might be some that are legitimate.
[41:24.040 --> 41:28.040]  We haven't found them because I got worried that our supplier would run out.
[41:28.040 --> 41:30.040]  So I called around, ordered a bunch of stuff.
[41:30.040 --> 41:31.040]  None of it.
[41:31.040 --> 41:32.040]  None of it ever came in.
[41:32.040 --> 41:34.040]  None of it.
[41:34.040 --> 41:37.040]  10 weeks later, none of it came in.
[41:37.040 --> 41:40.040]  Stuff I ordered came in two weeks before they said it would.
[41:40.040 --> 41:43.040]  So get your orders in.
[41:43.040 --> 41:46.040]  The number they told me is four weeks on average or whatever they said.
[41:46.040 --> 41:47.040]  Don't say that, Jones.
[41:47.040 --> 41:49.040]  Say six because we don't want to be charged backs.
[41:49.040 --> 41:50.040]  Okay.
[41:50.040 --> 41:51.040]  Six weeks.
[41:51.040 --> 41:52.040]  Get your orders in.
[41:52.040 --> 41:53.040]  But here's the thing.
[41:53.040 --> 41:54.040]  The orders are flooding in right now.
[41:54.040 --> 41:56.040]  They may pause orders again.
[41:56.040 --> 42:00.040]  So you better get your orders in at m4store.com from the great folks of my patriot.
[42:00.040 --> 42:01.040]  They're in our back end.
[42:01.040 --> 42:03.040]  People make jokes about that.
[42:03.040 --> 42:04.040]  They're in our computers.
[42:04.040 --> 42:05.040]  They run it.
[42:05.040 --> 42:06.040]  They take the orders.
[42:06.040 --> 42:08.040]  We've been partnered with them for many years.
[42:08.040 --> 42:13.040]  They make the Alexa pure breeze, the water filtration systems, all of their awesome folks.
[42:13.040 --> 42:15.040]  And it's their mission to prepare people.
[42:15.040 --> 42:16.040]  And they just do a great job.
[42:16.040 --> 42:22.040]  And they sell the food, the filters, everything for half of what a competitor's do because
[42:22.040 --> 42:25.040]  it is literally a mission of Matt Redhawk from God.
[42:25.040 --> 42:28.040]  And you hear a lot of these fake preachers and stuff saying that with these guys, it
[42:28.040 --> 42:29.040]  really is a mission.
[42:29.040 --> 42:30.040]  They've done so much for us.
[42:30.040 --> 42:31.040]  We really appreciate them.
[42:31.040 --> 42:33.040]  And they're just a God's sin.
[42:33.040 --> 42:37.040]  Through all this evil, though, you see that hand of God and Providence, though, working
[42:37.040 --> 42:38.040]  so many ways.
[42:38.040 --> 42:40.040]  I'm just very, very humble.
[42:40.040 --> 42:43.040]  But we have to just call out to Jesus.
[42:43.040 --> 42:44.040]  That's really the answer here.
[42:44.040 --> 42:46.040]  And this is a spiritual fight.
[42:46.040 --> 42:49.040]  And I can't, and you can't expect to beat this on your own.
[42:49.040 --> 42:52.040]  But you have to do it and testify against the New World Order.
[42:52.040 --> 42:54.040]  And I've got some other stuff to cover as well.
[42:54.040 --> 43:21.040]  I'm going to make Christians mad at me about the Mark of the Beast because they're scared.
[43:21.040 --> 43:30.040]  The world is now being tested.
[43:30.040 --> 43:35.040]  And we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole
[43:35.040 --> 43:41.040]  lives believing if they just submit down a bigger way, somehow they'll create a heavenly
[43:41.040 --> 43:42.040]  future.
[43:42.040 --> 43:50.040]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic
[43:50.040 --> 43:53.040]  and are building an anti-human future.
[43:53.040 --> 44:21.040]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[44:21.040 --> 44:31.040]  And it's like putting a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[44:31.040 --> 44:42.040]  And it's like putting a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[44:42.040 --> 44:59.040]  And it's like putting a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[44:59.040 --> 45:08.040]  And it's like putting a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[45:08.040 --> 45:30.040]  And it's like putting a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[45:30.040 --> 45:59.040]  And it's like putting a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[45:59.040 --> 46:28.040]  And it's like putting a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[46:28.040 --> 46:57.040]  And it's like putting a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[46:57.040 --> 47:12.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:12.040 --> 47:39.040]  There has never been a more important time for people to wake up and take action.
[47:39.040 --> 47:45.040]  And I am Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday, April 22nd edition.
[47:45.040 --> 47:54.040]  I want to open the phones up and I want to take a lot of calls for first-time callers in the next hour.
[47:54.040 --> 47:57.040]  And then we'll have a free for all after that.
[47:57.040 --> 48:01.040]  We have the head of GAB that's really been standing up to censorship and doing a lot of amazing things.
[48:01.040 --> 48:12.040]  We have a lot of key intel popping in as well, one of the alternative places for people to communicate that isn't censored.
[48:12.040 --> 48:24.040]  877-789-2539-877-789. Alex, 877-789-2539. So that is coming up.
[48:24.040 --> 48:26.040]  All right, let me lay this out.
[48:26.040 --> 48:37.040]  And again, anybody that's tuned in in the last 11 weeks since this all kicked off knows that I have made a lot of predictions and engaged a lot of analysis.
[48:37.040 --> 48:40.040]  And I said, you watch when they shut down for two weeks.
[48:40.040 --> 48:44.040]  They're then going to say, oh, it's just two months and then six months and it's never going to stop.
[48:44.040 --> 48:46.040]  And they're programming you that you're not essential.
[48:46.040 --> 48:50.040]  Think about if aliens arrived and landed and said, you are not essential.
[48:50.040 --> 48:55.040]  We will decide who is essential.
[48:55.040 --> 49:02.040]  You would say this is an attack, this is a demonization, this is beyond racism, this is even worse.
[49:02.040 --> 49:09.040]  It's saying like the Nazis did that you're useless eaters and must be gotten rid of.
[49:09.040 --> 49:13.040]  Because with robots and computers, they can make humans obsolete.
[49:13.040 --> 49:24.040]  And the globalists are teaching us now that we're obsolete and having a whole revolutionary rollout of medical tyranny forced inoculations and so much more.
[49:24.040 --> 49:28.040]  And so now the Communist Chinese see that we're bucking it.
[49:28.040 --> 49:29.040]  We're trying to reopen.
[49:29.040 --> 49:37.040]  People are pointing out that, hey, they're counting all deaths that test positive for COVID-19 as having COVID and dying from COVID.
[49:37.040 --> 49:46.040]  And then it turns out that anybody that's got the cold or anybody that ever had the cold or anybody that had had the flu are saying positive.
[49:46.040 --> 49:51.040]  And then it's a total fraud because they say they're testing for genetic material in the body.
[49:51.040 --> 50:00.040]  But you notice as the test goes out and as we test more than anybody in the world combined, but the media says, oh, we haven't done any testing.
[50:00.040 --> 50:02.040]  And the Trump said a bad job.
[50:02.040 --> 50:04.040]  We go, wait a minute.
[50:04.040 --> 50:08.040]  LA County with the percentages they've got now project.
[50:08.040 --> 50:09.040]  That was yesterday.
[50:09.040 --> 50:10.040]  400,000 people have it now.
[50:10.040 --> 50:15.040]  They're saying it's more like 450,000 and it's going to just go exponential.
[50:15.040 --> 50:22.040]  And it's killing zero.
[50:22.040 --> 50:31.040]  We'll put that back on screen point one six zero point one six five seven four nine nine nine nine.
[50:31.040 --> 50:33.040]  According to the health department's numbers.
[50:33.040 --> 50:44.040]  And again, almost all of those super sick on dialysis, kidney failure, liver failure, cancer, the average age, 86 years old, just like what you saw.
[50:44.040 --> 50:50.040]  In Italy.
[50:50.040 --> 50:55.040]  Super old population three generations to a house.
[50:55.040 --> 50:59.040]  They lose up to 60 to 70,000 a year from the flu.
[50:59.040 --> 51:06.040]  By the way, I've got numbers here out of Michigan, where the flu is killed more people than this.
[51:06.040 --> 51:20.040]  So if you're a radio listener, this is from the health department of LA County, it's in the local newspapers linked up on info wars.com.
[51:20.040 --> 51:25.040]  And you really need to go see this for yourself.
[51:25.040 --> 51:29.040]  Study shows LA County coronavirus count upwards of 400,000.
[51:29.040 --> 51:30.040]  That was again, a few days ago.
[51:30.040 --> 51:32.040]  Now it's above that today.
[51:32.040 --> 51:35.040]  The number 663 deaths.
[51:35.040 --> 51:36.040]  You add that together.
[51:36.040 --> 51:40.040]  It's incredible.
[51:40.040 --> 51:48.040]  Of course, they use this to scare everybody at study finds.org headline was oh my gosh, it's up 55 times higher than confirmed cases.
[51:48.040 --> 51:53.040]  But then you read that means, oh, it's not killing very many people that get it.
[51:53.040 --> 51:55.040]  That was in study finds.org.
[51:55.040 --> 51:59.040]  So see how they're spinning this.
[51:59.040 --> 52:04.040]  And then there's another article here out of the Detroit news.
[52:04.040 --> 52:09.040]  In Michigan, deaths were down in March, but it doesn't feel that way.
[52:09.040 --> 52:11.040]  No, no, it doesn't feel that way.
[52:11.040 --> 52:13.040]  We're all dead.
[52:13.040 --> 52:15.040]  Okay, save me.
[52:15.040 --> 52:22.040]  Culinary statistics from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services record 5,929 deaths in March 2020.
[52:22.040 --> 52:33.040]  On average, the month of March has seen 8,542 deaths from flu.
[52:33.040 --> 52:36.040]  So more die in that month from flu.
[52:36.040 --> 52:38.040]  According to the Health Department there in Michigan.
[52:38.040 --> 52:40.040]  But see, that doesn't matter, does it?
[52:40.040 --> 52:43.040]  Because it's so much fun to get into being scared.
[52:43.040 --> 52:47.040]  It's so much fun with all the attention.
[52:47.040 --> 52:55.040]  And then the internet can't even believe the video of John Roberts that was on C-SPAN that was on dozens of internet feeds was all over.
[52:55.040 --> 52:57.040]  And they've confirmed, no, that's that happened.
[52:57.040 --> 52:58.040]  He walks in.
[52:58.040 --> 53:04.040]  He's talking about a real study, real numbers out of LA County.
[53:04.040 --> 53:08.040]  And the internet can't even believe it's real.
[53:08.040 --> 53:16.040]  Because you see, my aunt used to have a bumper sticker on her car that says, if you want your children to listen, whisper.
[53:16.040 --> 53:18.040]  And I remember seeing that when I had children.
[53:18.040 --> 53:21.040]  I noticed if I didn't want them to hear, they'd really pay attention.
[53:21.040 --> 53:24.040]  If I try to talk right at them, they'll ignore you.
[53:24.040 --> 53:28.040]  So see, John Roberts walks in an hour before it starts, he's there early.
[53:28.040 --> 53:32.040]  He goes, hey, Bob, you know, this is ridiculous.
[53:32.040 --> 53:34.040]  Not even one percent are dying.
[53:34.040 --> 53:37.040]  Give it a break, my God, this is a hoax.
[53:37.040 --> 53:41.040]  And when everybody picks up on us, that goes, well, we're all vaccinated anyways.
[53:41.040 --> 53:43.040]  They go, oh, do they have a secret vaccine?
[53:43.040 --> 53:47.040]  No, no, the guy's just being smart ass.
[53:47.040 --> 53:50.040]  Because they've also told people, oh, you had the flu shot, you're more protected.
[53:50.040 --> 53:52.040]  It's the opposite.
[53:52.040 --> 53:57.040]  And so that's just another ignoramus wearing his mask, shooting something back at John Roberts.
[53:57.040 --> 53:59.040]  And so the Internet obsesses on that.
[53:59.040 --> 54:06.040]  Oh, oh, secretly, you know, they've been given vaccines.
[54:06.040 --> 54:11.040]  And the media spends it that New York Times photographer jokes about coronavirus vaccine on hot mic.
[54:11.040 --> 54:12.040]  They spend it.
[54:12.040 --> 54:13.040]  It's not that.
[54:13.040 --> 54:17.040]  It's a real numbers out of the health department that they don't want you to discuss.
[54:17.040 --> 54:18.040]  They don't want you to talk about.
[54:18.040 --> 54:19.040]  We're going to play it again in a moment.
[54:19.040 --> 54:21.040]  But here's what you need to know.
[54:21.040 --> 54:27.040]  The chai comms see everybody waking up and getting scared that they've launched the attack.
[54:27.040 --> 54:32.040]  So now they're saying the United States did it.
[54:32.040 --> 54:33.040]  America is scared of the virus.
[54:33.040 --> 54:36.040]  They're scared of the fact that the economy is going down.
[54:36.040 --> 54:44.040]  So China starts showing the people with the chemical sprays again and all the fear and all the drones and locking people up and going, oh, there's at least 30 strains.
[54:44.040 --> 54:47.040]  Some of them are deadlier than before.
[54:47.040 --> 54:51.040]  Just like Scooby Doo.
[54:51.040 --> 54:53.040]  The bad guys want to take the country over.
[54:53.040 --> 54:56.040]  They want to drive the stock market down to 5% buy it all up.
[54:56.040 --> 55:06.040]  Like Lord Rothschild did at the battle of Waterloo in 12 in 1815.
[55:06.040 --> 55:10.040]  And Lord Wellington are really just beating Napoleon for the second time.
[55:10.040 --> 55:12.040]  It was the battle of Waterloo.
[55:12.040 --> 55:16.040]  They sent carrier pitches to the coast had fast Corvette.
[55:16.040 --> 55:17.040]  Not by Chevy.
[55:17.040 --> 55:21.040]  That's named after a fast ship haul ass across the channel.
[55:21.040 --> 55:26.040]  And they ran in right as the stock market over London and said, well and good annihilated.
[55:26.040 --> 55:35.040]  And the stocks went to 1% Lord Rothschild bought them all and became supreme ruler of the British Empire.
[55:35.040 --> 55:39.040]  And it's the same thing driving it all down to nothing.
[55:39.040 --> 55:47.040]  All the oil down to nothing surveillance control domination and then they've patented the virus.
[55:47.040 --> 55:48.040]  They've already got it.
[55:48.040 --> 55:54.040]  Bill and Melinda Gates admit they have all these Chimera coronaviruses patented ready to be put in the vaccine.
[55:54.040 --> 56:08.040]  But you've got to beg and plead first and learn how to be locked down and learn how to wear a mask and learn how to be in a depression and beg them for your world ID and beg them for your immunity passport and get all the other scared people demanding we get in line.
[56:08.040 --> 56:10.040]  Or it's all over.
[56:10.040 --> 56:13.040]  And yeah, drones flying over that detect your breathing.
[56:13.040 --> 56:19.040]  And if they think you might have a breathing problem, the drone calls the police and you're arrested robot controllers.
[56:19.040 --> 56:24.040]  You flip a switch and suddenly we're all inside the system.
[56:24.040 --> 56:27.040]  877-789-2539.
[56:27.040 --> 56:31.040]  I got a lot of news, a lot of clips, a lot of insanity coming up.
[56:31.040 --> 56:33.040]  It's so critical in the second hour.
[56:33.040 --> 56:35.040]  Please don't just be spectators.
[56:35.040 --> 56:38.040]  Be the Paul Revere's that you are.
[56:38.040 --> 56:43.040]  Male, female, old, young, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, gay, straight, Christian, agnostic.
[56:43.040 --> 56:50.040]  If you don't want to be a slave, now's the time to get active and to go to band.video and share that video.
[56:50.040 --> 56:51.040]  Historic moment.
[56:51.040 --> 56:56.040]  Fox News admits COVID-19 is a giant hoax and there it all is hiding right there.
[56:56.040 --> 56:58.040]  And it's the statistics.
[56:58.040 --> 57:04.040]  But people don't care about the number to see the authority figure behind the scenes going, this is a giant scam.
[57:04.040 --> 57:09.040]  And you can see Roberts is pissed to see everybody acting like a bunch of scared little goons.
[57:09.040 --> 57:11.040]  Because he knows what's coming.
[57:11.040 --> 57:16.040]  Like everybody in North Korea bowing to Kim Jong-un, who by the way is that heart surgery that had been seen in weeks.
[57:16.040 --> 57:18.040]  Might be dead for all we know.
[57:18.040 --> 57:19.040]  All hell's breaking loose.
[57:19.040 --> 57:20.040]  We're going to start the second hour.
[57:20.040 --> 57:25.040]  But tell everybody about that local AM or FM station or TV station right now and keep doing it.
[57:25.040 --> 57:31.040]  And send out the links at infowars.com for a live show with a live feed right now.
[57:31.040 --> 57:36.040]  And tell folks, it turns out that COVID-19 is a giant hoax.
[57:36.040 --> 57:39.040]  But if we don't get the word out, we're all doomed.
[57:39.040 --> 57:40.040]  Pay it forward.
[57:40.040 --> 57:41.040]  Warn others.
[57:41.040 --> 57:42.040]  Chain reaction.
[57:42.040 --> 57:44.040]  That can override the globalist before it's too late.
[57:44.040 --> 57:46.040]  But this could not be more critical.
[57:46.040 --> 57:47.040]  Act now.
[57:47.040 --> 58:02.040]  10 weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high quality, affordable food, not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown.
[58:02.040 --> 58:07.040]  It would cause, because the globalists were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states.
[58:07.040 --> 58:11.040]  Now that prediction has come true because the globalists are running an operation.
[58:11.040 --> 58:13.040]  It's not predictions.
[58:13.040 --> 58:15.040]  We have their battle plans.
[58:15.040 --> 58:22.040]  Going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storeable food companies were sold out, except my Patreon supply because they're the biggest and more preposition.
[58:22.040 --> 58:28.040]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner.
[58:28.040 --> 58:31.040]  They stopped taking orders till they got caught back up.
[58:31.040 --> 58:32.040]  Well, now they're caught back up.
[58:32.040 --> 58:36.040]  They got high quality, affordable food in stock, ready to be packaged and shipped to you.

[59:53.040 --> 59:56.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:56.040 --> 1:00:01.040]  What is the end game?
[1:00:01.040 --> 1:00:04.040]  What is the end game?
[1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:07.040]  The end game has been initiated.
[1:00:07.040 --> 1:00:11.040]  I intend to start taking your phone calls when we come back in the next segment.
[1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.040]  I'm going to hit some of the top stories as well.
[1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:17.040]  Then Rob do has put together an extremely powerful presentation.
[1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:21.040]  We're going to premiere in the last segment of this hour.
[1:00:21.040 --> 1:00:26.040]  I'm just going to leave it at that and we'll continue with calls into the next hour.
[1:00:26.040 --> 1:00:30.040]  Andrew Toriba of GAV is going to be popping in for a couple of segments.
[1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:35.040]  Then we will continue into the fourth hour with your phone calls here today.
[1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:40.040]  The end game has been initiated.
[1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:42.040]  This is a special report.
[1:00:42.040 --> 1:00:48.040]  It's an audio report for radio listeners, a TV report for obviously folks viewing us.
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:52.040]  But we will post this to band.video and infowars.com the next few minutes.
[1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:55.040]  Here it is. The end game has been initiated.
[1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:01.040]  For more than two decades I have analyzed the architecture of the globalist system,
[1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:05.040]  who runs it, how it operates, what its goals are, what makes it tick.
[1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:10.040]  And so we knew that the heart of it was a worldwide medical dictatorship
[1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:15.040]  because that's true power over populations is who can have children,
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:20.040]  what type of drugs and medicines you can take, what type of inoculations you're forced to take.
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:30.040]  Authoritarians over the last 200 years really began to notice that armies invading or taking over get resisted.
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:36.040]  But if you can do it through the cover of medical necessity,
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:41.040]  and if you can pose as the guardian of civilization and society,
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:45.040]  then you can really stampede people into doing whatever you want.
[1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:49.040]  And again for 26 years studying the whole globalist system,
[1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:57.040]  Bill Gates and the big foundations he represents have been at the heart of this entire dehumanization operation.
[1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:04.040]  And so it's a very heavy heart that I realized that I just had to trust in God and turn over to God at this point
[1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:11.040]  because the last two months with the lockdown and them rolling out the plan exactly as we predicted they would,
[1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:15.040]  confirms to me that they're going to execute the next phases of the plan.
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:19.040]  So they're coming with forced inoculations next year.
[1:02:19.040 --> 1:02:27.040]  They're coming to not let you travel or have a job or live unless you don't just submit to COVID-19 vaccine
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:31.040]  and the Trojan Horse Nanotech, they admit they're going to put it.
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:36.040]  But they're also coming with all of these other so-called vaccines that actually go in
[1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:42.040]  and attack different parts of the brain and actually destroy parts of the brain
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:48.040]  associated with spiritual connections and deep emotions in higher levels of brainwaves.
[1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:51.040]  They call these anti-stress vaccines, anti-drug vaccines.
[1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:53.040]  They've had it for more than 20 years.
[1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:57.040]  They've been experimenting on them with mental patients and the military and others.
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:01.040]  And it is so draconian, so when they call something a vaccine,
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:05.040]  it's not the classic learned immunity like a 500-year-old smallpox vaccination
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:08.040]  that still had side effects and was dangerous,
[1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:12.040]  but in many cases did give people learned immunity when they were healthy
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:16.040]  instead of getting sick when they were run down, which had a higher chance of morbidity.
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:20.040]  That's all real science. It's still Russian roulette, very, very dangerous.
[1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:24.040]  But now to have Bill Gates out in the open announcing World Government,
[1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:28.040]  announcing a digital ink that will be in the vaccine.
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:29.040]  This is official.
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:34.040]  ID 2020 and other systems to be connected to your bank accounts
[1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:36.040]  so that it'll be the new global currency.
[1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:41.040]  It's just a giant leap forward into this control system.
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:43.040]  So I've been down on air.
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:46.040]  I know listeners have been pretty upset and bummed out.
[1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:48.040]  But the good news is this shows revelations is true.
[1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:51.040]  It shows God is real. It shows prophecy is real.
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:55.040]  And in my experience studying the New World War, they are Satanists.
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:56.040]  They believe in the devil.
[1:03:56.040 --> 1:04:00.040]  So so many people say, oh, that's the Jewish God, or that's the Christian God,
[1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:04.040]  and that's your cosmology, you know, the Chinese don't have that.
[1:04:04.040 --> 1:04:06.040]  This group doesn't believe that.
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:09.040]  Well, actually, ladies and gentlemen, if you study every ancient culture,
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:12.040]  they believe in evil. They believe in evil spirits. They believe in good.
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:15.040]  The Native Americans did. Every culture did.
[1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:19.040]  And these are all ways that ancient cultures were able to, you know,
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:23.040]  basically look at what they saw in the world and give us some type of meaning.
[1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:26.040]  But regardless, whether you believe the spiritual world or not,
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:28.040]  the globalists are manifesting it.
[1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:30.040]  They're pushing these archetypes and they believe it.
[1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:32.040]  And they're actually building it.
[1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:36.040]  So whether you believe in Jesus Christ and the God of the Bible and revelations or not,
[1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:40.040]  this system is being built and is anti-human.
[1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:43.040]  They're not trying to make us take microchips to all living in Kumbaya, Heaven.
[1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:46.040]  They're doing it to literally remove us out of the world,
[1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:49.040]  dehumanize us, and then build a post-human planet.
[1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:52.040]  So this is, wake up and say no or be destroyed forever.
[1:04:52.040 --> 1:04:55.040]  I'm Alex Jones. Thank you for watching.
[1:04:59.040 --> 1:05:02.040]  Now that this UN global government,
[1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:05.040]  CHICOM, billable indicates medical tyranny,
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:07.040]  has seen how far they can push it now,
[1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:11.040]  we just lapped it up like poison.
[1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:14.040]  You know now they're going to launch more bio attacks
[1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:16.040]  and even more hardcore.
[1:05:16.040 --> 1:05:19.040]  This early one does kill people,
[1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:22.040]  but see it's a virus billable indicates own.
[1:05:22.040 --> 1:05:25.040]  It's a virus that's novel from others
[1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:27.040]  so they can give you a vaccine.
[1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:29.040]  You see, a regular cold or flu virus,
[1:05:29.040 --> 1:05:31.040]  you really can't do a vaccine for it because it's always mutated.
[1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:35.040]  But see, because this is a chimera and lab made,
[1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:38.040]  they can have a speciality.
[1:05:38.040 --> 1:05:40.040]  So it's a whole giant franchise.
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:42.040]  They can fill the rich off of it.
[1:05:42.040 --> 1:05:44.040]  They can just surveil everybody.
[1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:46.040]  Everybody gets to become a suspect.
[1:05:46.040 --> 1:05:48.040]  And now when you would have low numbers of death,
[1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:51.040]  it doesn't matter because they make a huge spectacle out of it.
[1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:53.040]  You watch next year with the flu.
[1:05:53.040 --> 1:05:55.040]  It'll even be bigger as well.
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:57.040]  This is what they've done to us
[1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:00.040]  because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots.
[1:06:09.040 --> 1:06:11.040]  We're now into our number two broadcasting worldwide
[1:06:11.040 --> 1:06:13.040]  in the most dire times this planet has ever faced.
[1:06:13.040 --> 1:06:15.040]  World government.
[1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:17.040]  Like a Klingon warship.
[1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:20.040]  Uncloaked in the last two months.
[1:06:20.040 --> 1:06:21.040]  And it's firing on us.
[1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:23.040]  You want to use a cheesy Star Trek analogy.
[1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:24.040]  Just boom.
[1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:26.040]  Door closes.
[1:06:26.040 --> 1:06:28.040]  It's here.
[1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:31.040]  And people are calling me on the street.
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:33.040]  They're running up freaking out apologizing.
[1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:35.040]  They're like, it's on the news and plantable chips.
[1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:36.040]  World government.
[1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:37.040]  They're having pedophiles.
[1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:39.040]  People's houses.
[1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:41.040]  World governments being announced.
[1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:43.040]  Force inoculations, Jones, how did you know it?
[1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:45.040]  How did I know it?
[1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:48.040]  They've been programming everybody in the media
[1:06:48.040 --> 1:06:50.040]  and the culture for decades.
[1:06:50.040 --> 1:06:53.040]  And they've got all the patents and they've got the preparations.
[1:06:53.040 --> 1:06:57.040]  And they tried to hire my dad when he was in high school
[1:06:57.040 --> 1:06:59.040]  because he was top of his class.
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:02.040]  They hire everybody that's top of the class or try.
[1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:11.040]  The public has been so incredibly naive about everything.
[1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:15.040]  Well, I didn't grow up being naive.
[1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:18.040]  I didn't even realize growing up that I was around people
[1:07:18.040 --> 1:07:20.040]  that actually knew how stuff worked.
[1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:22.040]  I just thought everybody knew how stuff worked.
[1:07:22.040 --> 1:07:24.040]  Oh, yeah.
[1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:26.040]  Wait till what I get to.
[1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:34.040]  In the last segment of the Sauer, let's not get to this yet.
[1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:36.040]  Let's save that.
[1:07:36.040 --> 1:07:39.040]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:41.040]  I want to go to a lot of them.
[1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:43.040]  I don't want to make you wait.
[1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:45.040]  And I've got all this news to cover,
[1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:48.040]  but let me just restate the basics.
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:51.040]  They debate whether eight to 12 million people
[1:07:51.040 --> 1:07:56.040]  are going to die of starvation every year.
[1:07:56.040 --> 1:08:00.040]  And now the U.N. is reporting 30 million are going to starve to death.
[1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:04.040]  That's 20 million more in the next 12 months under this.
[1:08:04.040 --> 1:08:08.040]  That's official put out press release from the United Nations.
[1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:13.040]  The very group orchestrating and running the shutdown of the world
[1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:17.040]  that causes the chain reaction where over 2 billion people
[1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:21.040]  make less than a dollar a day.
[1:08:21.040 --> 1:08:23.040]  That's a bunch of make like a dollar a week.
[1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:27.040]  And most their money goes for food.
[1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:31.040]  Their children are barefoot.
[1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:33.040]  And the left side, well, there are too many people let them die.
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:35.040]  Okay, but then you care about everybody here.
[1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:38.040]  We've all got to wear masks so no old people die.
[1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:39.040]  Yeah, right.
[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:43.040]  You're sick death cult that loves killing people.
[1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:45.040]  And I got news for people that are selfish
[1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:46.040]  and think they get ahead like that.
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.040]  You're going to be the first when stuff collapses to go.
[1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:54.040]  In fact, the left statistically has seven to eight to nine times
[1:08:54.040 --> 1:08:56.040]  putting on the study mental illness,
[1:08:56.040 --> 1:08:59.040]  six, seven, eight, nine, 10 times more likely to steal.
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:03.040]  You normally have three times the debt of a Christian or a conservative
[1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:04.040]  or libertarian.
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:10.040]  You're physically ugly in all the studies.
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:12.040]  Because you're evil trash.
[1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:15.040]  And you know, I don't say that to be mean.
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:19.040]  You chose to resonate with evil.
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:23.040]  And so you've been turned into a biological Android,
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:25.040]  a worthless piece of trash.
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:29.040]  And so of course you project onto us that we're a worthless piece of trash
[1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:34.040]  or some little kid starving in Africa or Latin America or Asia
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:39.040]  doesn't deserve a future when you cut their economy off on purpose
[1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:41.040]  in the name of saving people's lives.
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:46.040]  And it causes 10,000 times the death.
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:50.040]  You will never metaphysically get away with that.
[1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:52.040]  God hates your guts.
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:55.040]  And boy, you think your God Satan is powerful.
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:09:58.040]  That's just because you don't have any connection to God.
[1:09:58.040 --> 1:10:02.040]  If you knew how the universe really worked, you'd be scared.
[1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:07.040]  I'm scared just thinking about what you've done.
[1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:09.040]  People ask how I'm not afraid of the new world order
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:11.040]  because I'm afraid of God.
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:13.040]  And that's not like God's intimidate me.
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:15.040]  I've got in God's presence.
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:20.040]  And let me tell you, that'll get you straight real quick.
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:26.040]  So this is it.
[1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:29.040]  We weren't just going to abort babies and devil worship
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:35.040]  and have pedophile storytime and just sail off into the pedophile sunset.
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:42.040]  We're sailing off the edge of a damn cliff right now.
[1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:46.040]  Now, I was going to get to this at the start of the show,
[1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:48.040]  but I'm going to just go to phone calls
[1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:50.040]  and I'm going to hit this at the bottom of the hour.
[1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:59.040]  But guess what I have right here from Bloomberg?
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:06.040]  Global financial recess, global financial reset, both,
[1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:13.040]  worldwide bankruptcy, starting with the states.
[1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:14.040]  And you know what that means?
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:17.040]  You ain't getting your pension funds, public employees.
[1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:20.040]  You dumb leftist morons.
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:22.040]  You took the bait.
[1:11:22.040 --> 1:11:23.040]  You said, stay home.
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:24.040]  You stole the economy.
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:27.040]  And all the numbers show it can't be reversed.
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:32.040]  So now you're getting ready to go bankrupt.
[1:11:32.040 --> 1:11:35.040]  And McConnell is only bringing this out now
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:37.040]  because they've been talking to the Justice Department
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:41.040]  and they're saying, do you really want to lose your pension funds leftist?
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:46.040]  Because you're the idiot schmucks that have hijacked the economy
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:49.040]  and are doing this to punish Americans for wanting to be prosperous
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:52.040]  and wanting to not lose a trade war with China
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:57.040]  and not wanting to get on our knees in front of the globalist ding dong,
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:00.040]  not wanting to, you know, let them have their way with us,
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:05.040]  not let them spiritually rape us.
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:07.040]  Because that's what this is really all about.
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:10.040]  Let me tell you.
[1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:18.040]  Satan wants to rape you and destroy your free will.
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:20.040]  God wants to love you.
[1:12:20.040 --> 1:12:22.040]  And McConnell's coming out saying this
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:27.040]  because we maybe have two weeks to turn this around
[1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:30.040]  before it's irrevocable and all your pension funds are worthless
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:32.040]  in California and Michigan.
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:36.040]  It's all the blue states that are going to go down the toilet.
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:40.040]  The red states are smart.
[1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:44.040]  And McConnell's like, you're going to go bankrupt.
[1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:46.040]  That's better than us bailing you out.
[1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:49.040]  He's letting the Democrats know you're not getting a fiat bailout
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:53.040]  on the red states, paying for your blue state idiocy,
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:54.040]  trying to sink the country.
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:56.040]  You're going to go bankrupt.
[1:12:56.040 --> 1:12:58.040]  You're going to lose your pension funds
[1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:02.040]  because we're all going to lose them in about two, three weeks.
[1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:06.040]  We're over the edge of the cliff and it's bye-bye time.
[1:13:06.040 --> 1:13:08.040]  See, I said I'd hit it at the bottom of the arm.
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:09.040]  I'm already hitting it.
[1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:11.040]  God almighty.
[1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:13.040]  You know, when I got up here about two months ago
[1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:15.040]  and the lockdown started and I said we could maybe go a month
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:18.040]  and a half, two months and then you're going to hear about global bankruptcy.
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:19.040]  That's in the other articles.
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:23.040]  And you're going to hear about having like half of your pension fund
[1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:25.040]  knocked out up front and then a few years later,
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:26.040]  they'll take the next half.
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:28.040]  And this damn virus is meant to kill your ass
[1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:30.040]  so they don't have to pay for the pension funds.
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:31.040]  I mean, that's what this is.
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:35.040]  So McConnell just is saying, hey, you know what your pension funds?
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:39.040]  All this wear your mask and get all into it and have fun
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:47.040]  and play along with the new world order and have the fun theater garbage.
[1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:50.040]  You're going to lose everything you've got.
[1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:52.040]  And the leftists have no memory.
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:54.040]  So when this all goes to hell in a handbasket,
[1:13:54.040 --> 1:13:56.040]  they'll point at those of us that warn them and say we're bad.
[1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:59.040]  Because we don't take the microchip and the new digital currency
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:01.040]  that'll save things next year.
[1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:03.040]  This is it.
[1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:08.040]  Bringing us down to the ground, bankrupting us.
[1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:11.040]  So we'll submit to their total takeover.
[1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:14.040]  And they're ridiculous dog training.
[1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:18.040]  Now, let's play the John Roberts video that keeps people waking up.
[1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:22.040]  It's going viral everywhere, which is confirmed to be real.
[1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:23.040]  It's in the damn health department.
[1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:27.040]  The numbers are real.
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:35.040]  That less than 1%, 16% of 1% are dying in LA County.
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:37.040]  And here he is saying you can take your damn mask off
[1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:40.040]  in the White House briefing room.
[1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:44.040]  All right, man, you can take off the mask.
[1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:47.040]  The case fatality rates are 0.1 to 0.3.
[1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:49.040]  Is that right?
[1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:51.040]  That's reassuring.
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:53.040]  Everybody here's been vaccinated anyway.
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:57.040]  USC and LA County Public Health come up with a study that found
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:00.040]  that there are 7,000 cases in California.
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:06.040]  But they really believe that there are anywhere from 221,442,000 people
[1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:08.040]  who were infected.
[1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:09.040]  Really?
[1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:13.040]  So that makes it 0.1 to 0.3.
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:15.040]  Is this study you're going to be doing?
[1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:18.040]  Yeah, I'll just give it to them.
[1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:23.040]  So it suggests that the case fatality rate is 10.
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:25.040]  Well, it's just the case.
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:26.040]  What's your right mind before you?
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:28.040]  Yeah, exactly that.
[1:15:28.040 --> 1:15:30.040]  So it was a hoax.
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:37.040]  I don't know if it was a hoax.
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:41.040]  No, it's not a hoax because if you look at a whole field of clover,
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:44.040]  there's probably two or three four-leaf clovers in there.
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:46.040]  Did you say, hey, that field's got four-leaf clovers in it?
[1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:48.040]  It's not a hoax to say they're there.
[1:15:48.040 --> 1:15:49.040]  It's just super rare.
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:52.040]  So the virus hitting the hoax is just like a four-leaf clover
[1:15:52.040 --> 1:16:18.040]  that's got four-leaf clovers in it.
[1:16:18.040 --> 1:16:44.040]  It's just a hoax to say they're there.

[1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:02.280]  The America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the free home of
[1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:08.840]  the brave is dying right now. And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us,
[1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:14.200]  shutting us down and making us dependent on them. The food shortages have begun. The depression is
[1:18:14.200 --> 1:18:18.520]  going to be long and very, very serious. In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[1:18:18.520 --> 1:18:22.600]  Trump tried to stop it, but the mainstream media working with the tri-coms blocked it.
[1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:28.440]  That's why you and myself, everybody else has to get prepared now. Do not wait. It's not about
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:32.840]  the virus. It's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:37.400]  year. Get your high quality, swarble foods and info or short.com. They're available again,
[1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:44.040]  but for a limited time the food supply is running out. There are major shortages. This is a globalist
[1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:50.600]  siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism, but we the people, the patriots have to be prepared.
[1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:54.280]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far. We'll get ready to be really proven right.
[1:18:54.280 --> 1:19:00.600]  Get your swarble foods now at infoorstore.com. There's a process where you take a stallion
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:05.400]  and you tie him down and you cut his testicles off and then he becomes gelded. Well, that's
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:09.640]  what's happening to the entire world right now. We're going into deep, deep tyranny.
[1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:13.640]  Boys like North Korea and China are going into deeper tyranny as well. It's all directed by
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:19.720]  the UN. It's all a big, cooked up, giant plan to absolutely take control of your life, bankrupt
[1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:25.160]  the economy and make you dependent on the big mega banks. And to get your universal income,
[1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:29.000]  you're going to have to take the inoculations, brainwash your kids the way they say and have
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.880]  absolutely no freedom. And it's all happening, boom, overnight. This is a giant revolution.
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:37.320]  And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said, Oh, it's just an extended spring break. Two
[1:19:37.320 --> 1:19:42.680]  weeks. Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years. It never ends. No one can ever die
[1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:48.360]  from a virus again. Government will save you. It's a takeover. It's the opposite. They're coming
[1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:52.760]  with forced inoculations on record. They'll reduce your fertility, lower your immunity,
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:57.160]  and in many cases kill you. And they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[1:19:57.160 --> 1:20:03.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:32.920]  Well, it was a month ago. Longer we put out the Gregory's report
[1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:39.000]  that COVID-19 is the perfect storm for global reset. And now it's being announced.
[1:20:39.640 --> 1:20:46.760]  Blue states are going to have all their pension funds taken if your county city or state folks.
[1:20:47.720 --> 1:20:50.840]  And that was the plan for everybody. And well, you get what you want. So
[1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:54.920]  you want to destroy America and have a depression like Bill Maher talked about.
[1:20:54.920 --> 1:21:00.040]  Okay. Well, you guys are the most leveraged out. So it's going to hit you hardest. But
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:05.080]  that's why they call you dumbasses. Why they call you Satanist. You just don't understand
[1:21:06.040 --> 1:21:12.280]  the good sense the Lord gave you. Let's just do this though. Let's start going on your phone
[1:21:12.280 --> 1:21:18.600]  calls as promised. Don, Dave, Kenny, Tricia, Patrick, Steve, Jesse, Tammy, and many others.
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:25.480]  Tammy in California where that got you positioned for total collapse. What is your take on all this?
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:32.360]  Yeah. Hi, Alex. Gavin just put something out yesterday in California. He's announcing his
[1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:37.560]  new plan to gently introduce California to socialism. He's not reopening the state,
[1:21:37.560 --> 1:21:44.040]  but he has launched a website for every healthy California to volunteer and says he wants to
[1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:49.640]  grow an army to do all the work needed for free. Well, that's right, because you're not essential
[1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:55.000]  at your regular job or your regular shop or the little restaurant you have or your dog grooming
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:59.800]  thing, or you maybe do people's lashes, or maybe you do gardening or maybe you write books. But
[1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:04.600]  you're going to be I saw that you're going to be essential though under the psychopath governor.
[1:22:05.480 --> 1:22:10.440]  Exactly. Exactly. In fact, I meant to cover that it's in my stack, but I won't be able to
[1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:17.160]  probably find it. There's so many articles because in Gavin Newsom launches volunteer force to put
[1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:22.200]  California back to work. I saw that last night. So but again, you can only work for him because
[1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:28.120]  he's essential. You like how that works? No, because you know what? We didn't vote for Gavin Newsom.
[1:22:28.120 --> 1:22:32.920]  When we went to bed that night, Cox was in the lead. There are several screen captures of the
[1:22:32.920 --> 1:22:38.600]  television. Oh, there's no election fraud in blue states. No, it's true. States never go back because
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:46.120]  of total fraud. Yeah. So yes, the website that he has launched is called Californians for All.
[1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:51.400]  Isn't that nice and cool? Oh, you work for free as a slave. Yeah, Californians for All.
[1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:58.280]  Not for this miscreant. I don't. So is that Californiansforall.com or.gov or.state or?
[1:22:58.280 --> 1:23:10.840]  California volunteers.ca.gov. Yeah, yeah, there it is. Oh, forced labor because you know in the
[1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:16.120]  future like North Korea or Venezuela, you're going to have to go out and do your days of work.
[1:23:16.680 --> 1:23:21.080]  A lot of times at private companies like you're a prisoner, we're all trustees now. But if we
[1:23:21.080 --> 1:23:26.280]  if we do good job, we can leave our houses and have our little card and go, I'm essential.
[1:23:26.280 --> 1:23:33.720]  Oh, and they want us to give blood. I wouldn't have any allow anybody in the state of California
[1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:38.760]  to stick a needle in California and Arkansas run by Democrats at the time are famous. They get your
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:45.240]  blood and then sell it and make money personally. The Clintons made over $50 million on prisoners
[1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:50.600]  blood with HIV. Believe it. I remember California passed the law. You can give people HIV now.
[1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:56.600]  Isn't that liberal? Oh, yes. That's true. That's true. That's liberal blood and the same senators
[1:23:56.600 --> 1:24:02.520]  no recourse to sue and the senators trying to pass a law that pedophilia is legal as long as it's
[1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:10.840]  same sex. It doesn't surprise me. Same God. You didn't say that. I'm not kidding. It's crazy.
[1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:16.360]  I didn't. I didn't. I didn't see that. There's so many lawless laws that are passed in California.
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:20.840]  I just regard them because they go against the Constitution. So I'm sure a lot of the gun
[1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:26.040]  owners here in California just regard all the gun laws. They've supposedly supposedly passed
[1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:31.160]  because they go against the Constitution of the United States of America. So that you're right,
[1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:36.360]  ma'am. God bless you. We're all in this together. What do you make of the incredible footage of the
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:42.520]  hot mic? People don't care that LA County 600 something dead out of 400,000 that have it showing
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:49.640]  it's less than 1%. Like we said, 16% of 1%. I mean, we're talking ultra low. But nobody cares
[1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:53.960]  about the actual statistic from the county. They just are freaking out that behind the scenes,
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:25:01.160]  the media knows it's a hoax. She's gone. Wanted to get her take on that because that is so massive.
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:06.200]  That's the clip when you go in a store and they're saying, where are your mask? Where are your mask?
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:11.800]  You just show them that and say, you're an idiot. Because next it'll be take your shot.
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:18.920]  Take your shot. They're coming for your pension funds. But you don't care your leftist. You want
[1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:23.720]  to lose them. You like it as long as America collapses. You love it.
[1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:32.920]  Let's talk to Dave in North Carolina, where the bio weapon virus originally was sold by Obama
[1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:42.680]  and Fauci to the sky coms. Go ahead, Dave. Hey, Alex, how are you? Thank you for taking my call.
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:49.560]  The major thing that I want to talk about is messaging and how the media is using messaging
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:55.880]  for behavior control and always have. And I've got an example right here. It's like,
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:26:00.680]  guess way down in Michigan, but people think it's the end of the world. They're just hyping
[1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:08.440]  the living hell out of everything. Right, exactly. And when you own the messaging,
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:14.200]  you own the behavior. And you can get whatever behavior that you want. And unfortunately,
[1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:20.920]  what's happened is that with alternative media sources, people like you and others that are
[1:26:20.920 --> 1:26:28.440]  out there, citizen journalists, Owen Troyer, David Knight, that are out there speaking the truth,
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:35.000]  the problem is the media has been caught and they've been lying to us for decades about everything.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:39.400]  And so now they're bringing on the big mega hoax of this to get rid of our speech, everything.
[1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:44.040]  I mean, notice that Facebook and Google and Twitter are banning anyone that organizes a
[1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:49.480]  protest against this. You're being called obsolete, nonessential. You're being told they're about to
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:55.560]  bankrupt everything. And then if you try to protest a liberal from Harvard Zuckerberg goes,
[1:26:55.560 --> 1:27:04.200]  sorry, you don't have speech because I'm a liberal. Exactly. And that's what they're trying. I mean,
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:10.440]  look at the education system that we have and the way that our kids come out of school, absolutely
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:16.280]  ignorant of anything. They can't tell you what anything in the preamble of the Constitution.
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:22.120]  They can't tell you what article one, two and three represent. They can't even name off the
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:29.160]  constitutional amendments. And then they go off to college and they're taught some garbage and
[1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:35.000]  constantly or you just said it. Notice they have lockdowns at colleges and days that white people
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:40.040]  can't be there and distancing and, you know, all this neuroses. This is how they're launching
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:45.080]  into our daily lives, where we all enforce on each other to wear the mask six feet apart,
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:49.560]  can't bring your kid in the store. And the next is take your vaccine, go to your work brigade,
[1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:54.840]  do what you have to now to get things going to prove your part of the team. These people are
[1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:59.960]  morons. They've forgotten history. They've learned to hate America. And so now all their
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:03.560]  prosperity is going to be sucked out of them. But because they have no memory, because they're
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:08.200]  not conscious, a lot of them don't have souls now, they've lost them. They're just robots and don't
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:13.080]  care. As long as they feel like they're winning while they schmuck off the edge of a cliff,
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:17.720]  I appreciate your call, Dave. And all these folks that think they're going to protect themselves
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:23.800]  by going along with the system and getting more money and running the New Zealand. I remember,
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:29.400]  as I told you 15 years ago, all the big Hollywood money was saying we're done with movies. We don't
[1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:33.160]  care about the money. We're all running because there's going to be a bio weapon release to kill
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:37.400]  everybody on the planet. And we're all building bunkers in New Zealand. And now it's in the news.
[1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:43.240]  That's the case. This is only the test bio weapon. The real ones are coming. Once you learn to lock
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:48.520]  down properly, they're going to hit you with drone delivered bio weapons and you're all dead.
[1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:53.560]  Remember, I don't say something unless I mean it. Going along with this is certain death for you
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:29:00.840]  and your family. You'll be right back. Attention GCN self reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted
[1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:05.720]  an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:09.880]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde, I want to tell you about
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:15.240]  a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:20.040]  an endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic
[1:29:20.040 --> 1:29:23.960]  flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding,
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:28.440]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location. And rather than move it back
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:32.840]  to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[1:29:32.840 --> 1:29:36.920]  if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory. So here's what you should do right now. Check out
[1:29:36.920 --> 1:29:43.400]  the PPX microgrid system at my own power grid dot com. That's my own power grid dot com over a
[1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:47.720]  thousand dollars in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too. And the best part,
[1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:54.120]  you're not going to pay 750 or $500, 300 or even 200. Go to my own power grid dot com to learn more.
[1:29:54.120 --> 1:30:02.520]  That's my own power grid dot com. Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that
[1:30:02.520 --> 1:30:08.440]  would cut their energy used by half. And the United States wouldn't sign on to it. So guess what
[1:30:08.440 --> 1:30:14.120]  happened along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon
[1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:20.280]  footprint by half. And that means you're going to be poor now and under his control. And of course,
[1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:25.240]  with the medical tyranny comes the force inoculations, a microchip that comes with the
[1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:32.200]  vaccine and so much more. And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:37.080]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:41.960]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long, women own their bodies. Now say you don't
[1:30:41.960 --> 1:30:46.520]  own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you. If you don't submit, you can't
[1:30:46.520 --> 1:30:51.480]  buy or sell or leave your home, mark the beast. Oh, and guess what? Jeffrey Epstein and all these
[1:30:51.480 --> 1:30:56.440]  people hang out together with Bill Gates under a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face.
[1:30:56.440 --> 1:31:02.840]  They hate you and your family. Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population
[1:31:02.840 --> 1:31:09.880]  itself obsolete, non-essential. That's why they position it with economic tariffs,
[1:31:09.880 --> 1:31:15.320]  taxes and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States
[1:31:15.320 --> 1:31:21.800]  has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate. That's part of making us obsolete
[1:31:21.800 --> 1:31:28.360]  so that as the human world is phased out, they can simply look at us and say, because again,
[1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:34.360]  you are non-essential. That's what the robots and all of this is about. It's about setting it up
[1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:39.880]  where we're no longer in charge of our lives. We can be told to stay on our houses and after all,
[1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:44.920]  shut up. This world doesn't belong to people anyways. It belongs to the new AI gods, the
[1:31:44.920 --> 1:31:48.920]  rich elitists that have merged with machines. Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[1:31:48.920 --> 1:31:55.960]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing. These people are completely psychotic and make
[1:31:55.960 --> 1:32:02.040]  Hitler look like a choir boy. Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it,
[1:32:02.040 --> 1:32:08.600]  admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation
[1:32:08.600 --> 1:32:14.280]  level on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown. That is hundreds
[1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:19.480]  of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and the very people that cooked
[1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:23.880]  it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization, with Bill Gates involved,
[1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:28.600]  are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression,
[1:32:28.600 --> 1:32:33.800]  and forcibly inoculate everybody. This is insane. Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:37.720]  You need to get prepared now. You need to get high quality, storable food now back in stock
[1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:43.880]  at infowarstore.com and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:48.520]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge
[1:32:48.520 --> 1:32:53.720]  verbally, social distancing. This is beyond 1984. The tyranny of the dual orders here.
[1:32:53.720 --> 1:33:15.160]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war. You are the Paul Revere's.
[1:33:23.720 --> 1:33:42.600]  We've seen this a lot in the last few months. They said, oh, when it gets bad and 3 million
[1:33:42.600 --> 1:33:48.920]  people die in the United States, we're going to stop resuscitating people that have heart attacks,
[1:33:48.920 --> 1:33:55.320]  whether they be 50 years old or 80 years old, because we need the hospital space. Well, now they
[1:33:55.320 --> 1:34:01.320]  admit that the hospitals are three times emptier than they've ever been in the last 50 years.
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:07.240]  The National Health Service reports they're four times more empty than ever. Empty.
[1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:20.040]  But now when you have a heart attack, just like Venezuela, they don't resuscitate you because
[1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:25.960]  that's non-essential and you're non-essential. When I was looking the numbers up, I had a guest on
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:32.040]  talking about this and I didn't even know this. You get fourth. In fact, I even pulled the article
[1:34:32.040 --> 1:34:37.320]  up a few nights ago when David I said I didn't know that the feds give a hospital if someone doesn't
[1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:46.200]  have coverage, $4,000 for pneumonia, $40,000 for COVID-19. So they can say, you know, a kitchen sink
[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:52.760]  or a roll of toilet paper has got COVID-19. It's just a giant hoax. The virus is man made.
[1:34:52.760 --> 1:35:03.960]  It mutates. It goes after testicles and it kills old people. But it's really novel because it's
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:11.160]  been engineered to show the NIH and the CHICOMS can own it and own the response to it. New York
[1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:15.720]  Post. New York issues. You don't resuscitate guidelines for cardiac patients amid coronavirus.
[1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:23.080]  Yep. So there you go. Death panels, folks. Bye-bye.
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:31.320]  And we're not going to take care of the old people or anybody else. Everybody has to die now.
[1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:36.360]  Like the 30 million people the UN says are starving to death now because of the lockdown.
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:43.080]  That's okay. 30 million are cool because it's so fun to wear a mask and act all avant-garde
[1:35:43.080 --> 1:35:47.720]  and we're all doing this together. We're all heroes and the medical workers are such heroes.
[1:35:49.240 --> 1:36:00.360]  Well, yeah. I think emergency room workers and people that are technicians, paramedics on the
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:06.440]  ambulances have got one of the hardest jobs you can have. I had friends that are or were paramedics.
[1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:10.600]  They have the highest level of PTSD I've ever seen. I mean, the stories they tell. I mean,
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:16.040]  dead kids, kids dead that ate their dad's cocaine, kids eaten by pit bulls. The worst thing is little
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:24.360]  kids. I've seen war footage that we never put on air, but nobody puts it on air of kids arms and
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:28.120]  legs blown off, lower mandibles blown off, going, my, my, my, my, and there's no lower.
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:35.160]  The tonsil, like a Colombian that time, little girls. I mean, I made myself watch like five
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:40.040]  minutes of it once. I have nightmares about it today. So I mean, I get there are a lot of amazing
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:44.920]  medical workers and I'm out here virtue signaling, you know, kissing your ass with this fake counterfeit
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:51.160]  currency of caring. I get their badasses. I mean, long term cops that are in big cities
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:56.440]  and in areas. I mean, they see some stuff. You can be the toughest guy around. You see, especially
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:01.000]  kids smashed up in cars. I've seen a few car wrecks when people had their heads cut off and arms cut
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:05.080]  off and I help people. They're like, help me. Oh, my arm's like spewing blood on you. And,
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:12.360]  you know, you handle at the time and you go home and sleep for two days. I get it. I've only seen
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:17.160]  a few things like that. It traumatized me, but I got family that are nurses or doctors. They're
[1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:22.600]  drinking vodka and having sex and watching pornoes and Netflix. Okay. And I was told by
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:27.000]  separate people that, yeah, well, we're having a party. What are you doing? Well, what do you think
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:30.040]  the nurses and the doctors are having a good time? What are you doing? Well, what do you think we're
[1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:36.600]  doing? Watching porn and Netflix? Yeah. I got to talk to family. They go, I'm watching porn and
[1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:40.360]  drinking vodka. I was like, oh, you're having a party? What's going on? Well, there's nobody here.
[1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:47.240]  We're just, what do you think we're doing? You're banging the nurses. I mean, this is a family show.
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:52.120]  I'm just telling you, there's nobody in the damn hospitals. They're in there having orgies, ladies
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:38:00.200]  and gentlemen. So I'm not going to sit here and play along with this crap. I said, get
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:06.840]  storable food. And I said, get prepared. And I said, do all that because they're going to bring
[1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:12.120]  down the economy and things are insane. And I believe if I was them, and I hate to give my
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:15.960]  ideas, but I've studied them so long that they're not getting them for me. I've studied them. It's
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:20.280]  the other way around. It's not, they're not getting it from me. I just don't know how I call it. So
[1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:28.840]  dead on. They've got mutagenic viruses that show up as a cold bug. And if you want to have a tailored
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:37.320]  cold bug, a coronavirus, it's just the most common thing there is folks that you use a bio weapon,
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:45.960]  you can release strains of it that only mutate and only replicate enough times to kill somebody.
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:51.240]  And that's how you have these micro areas. They don't want to release a bio weapon that keeps
[1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:56.840]  raging. You release one genetically engineered with DNA control. Now they have control folks.
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:02.040]  How many times it'll mutate? What it'll do 30, 40, 50 steps out of it. They've got control. Now
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:06.360]  these are nanotech. These aren't your granddaddy or grandma or your daddy or mama's viruses.
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:14.120]  And they can tailor bio weapons that aren't just race specific. They can tailor them to
[1:39:14.120 --> 1:39:17.960]  an individual, though they'd have to have your blood and a bunch of tests that would be expensive.
[1:39:17.960 --> 1:39:23.320]  But that's why they want everybody's DNA. It's all in the DNA.
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:32.200]  And now they've got DNA vaccines that are not RNA for the virus. It's for your body.
[1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:38.520]  Now that's so dangerous, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, live viruses are hell enough on you and
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:44.200]  cause massive cancer and infertility and autoimmune diseases off the chart with Gardasil and things
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:49.160]  like this. This isn't a live virus cupcake. This is a DNA injection.
[1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:56.520]  And as they reported, some of these vaccines have the whole human genome in them.
[1:39:58.440 --> 1:40:03.240]  So yeah, this is a nightmare scenario from hell.
[1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:09.560]  But hey, at least all the sneaking around is over. The new world order is out in the open.
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:13.720]  They're going to send pedophiles convicted to your school to bounce your kid on their knee.
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:16.440]  They're going to track you with drones. They're going to forcefully inject you.
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:19.640]  They're going to make your job obsolete and put you in forced labor brigades.
[1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:24.280]  It's all being announced because Thomas Jefferson was asked once in a letter by a
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:32.040]  member of the Virginia legislature, the Commonwealth. What is the limit of tyranny
[1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:35.160]  man will accept? And he said, is the limit to which you will accept?
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:46.280]  Tyrants will always override the next tyrant. There's no limit to the black hole.
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:50.920]  So you think about that. We're going to go to break. I said, I get to rob to his big piece.
[1:40:50.920 --> 1:40:54.600]  I'm really excited about Torba coming on. Let's push him back to 15 after he'll understand.
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:58.040]  I'll premiere that second segment and then get to Torba and his big news from Gab.
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:01.880]  And then we'll continue, but I want to go to your phone calls next segment.
[1:41:01.880 --> 1:41:05.560]  The next and then we'll get to that report and then make you see this.
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:10.040]  But I've got like six or seven reports. We have a premiere together. They're all just,
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:14.600]  oh, I mean, you know, about sign. I mean, if you wouldn't saw a science fiction movie
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:18.920]  five years ago with this stuff in it, you'd be scared like God, this is a scary movie.
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:23.240]  But since it's happening in real world, there's this cognitive distance. It's crazy. Also,
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:29.080]  we're funded by viewers and listeners like you. The globalists are trying to shut us down. I want
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:32.920]  to stay in the fight. Plus we got great products you need. I want to thank you all for your support.

[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:43.560]  out to get your orders in while you can for the great depression. The globalist are engineering
[1:42:43.560 --> 1:42:48.360]  because the total stock market crash is shut for about a month from now unless we averted
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:55.480]  in the put options. The put options have got it set to go down about May 22nd.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:01.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars can now offer high quality, durable food again.
[1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:08.600]  Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago and they told people they had food. Most folks
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:15.160]  never will deliver their food. Well, when our sponsors food began to run short, they just
[1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:21.000]  spend it sales. So they open more factories and secured more food. So either orders in or right
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:26.520]  now they can take new orders and get it to you quickly. They'll probably have to suspend orders
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:32.760]  very, very soon again, because the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution, farming,
[1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:37.240]  you name it. And now it's mainstream news. The food shortages and delivery are already
[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:43.320]  starting to happen. If Trump can turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away from
[1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:48.040]  the globalist, things may be okay, but it looks like it's going to get very, very rough. So again,
[1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:51.880]  ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number one thing you need high quality,
[1:43:51.880 --> 1:44:08.200]  storeable food ready to get to you and your family. Now if you get your orders in the forestore.com.
[1:44:22.200 --> 1:44:29.800]  It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality
[1:44:29.800 --> 1:44:35.080]  and aerosolizes it in a really great way. I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:40.360]  It's got organic alcohol in it. So spray it right in your eyes. But I just love it personally as
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:45.160]  something that's a moisturizer as well. So this is a real innovation. I don't know why others didn't
[1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:49.800]  think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it. So it doesn't
[1:44:49.800 --> 1:44:54.760]  dry you out. It smells great. It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:28.120]  It was I, the leader of Cobra, that foresaw your inner kindness and how much you would enjoy
[1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:34.440]  watching Netflix and wearing masks and gloves when you went out to feel all important like you
[1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:41.880]  were in a war. With the real tired of Cobra was always the billions of people at the edge of
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:50.280]  starvation who were about dying at the tune of over a million people every three weeks. Cobra
[1:45:50.280 --> 1:45:57.320]  thanks you for what you've done. Continue the lockdowns while I depopulate the planet. Hail,
[1:45:57.320 --> 1:46:04.840]  Cobra! Biopqq. Research that. Look into it for yourself. Big brother and the globalist don't
[1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:11.400]  want you to. CoQ10. Oh, you probably want to spend some time researching CoQ10. And then research
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:18.920]  DNA Force Plus and the types that we have in here. The very best forms of BQQ and CoQ10.
[1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:25.800]  And then a whole bunch of other natural ingredients for Mother Nature that are known
[1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:32.920]  to supercharge it all. This is our best selling overall formula. And I told listeners at the
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:38.840]  end of last year that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup
[1:46:38.840 --> 1:46:43.880]  in them to fund our operations. But because of what's happening and going on in the world right now,
[1:46:45.080 --> 1:46:51.080]  I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force Plus
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:57.240]  to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your family. DNA Force Plus now 50% off.
[1:46:57.240 --> 1:47:03.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:07.880 --> 1:47:11.640]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now. There is no government official here,
[1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:15.640]  but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:18.040]  Cool.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:31.960]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people. The press is not the enemy of the
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:48.360]  people. The press is not the enemy of the people. They came in peace.
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:48:01.400]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:07.560]  fake news. Maybe we should go out. All journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:21.640]  we're not the enemy of the people. We're not the enemy of the people.
[1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:32.600]  We're not the enemy of the people. We're not the enemy of the people.
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:43.320]  is CNN and now they tell you well you went out yesterday the economy never opens again
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:49.320]  and you take inoculations and drones watch you you've got a medical ID and a chip under the skin
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:55.480]  and all of a sudden the trap clink shut and you're inside the new world order
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:49:00.680]  and again everybody's freaking out i see it all over the internet the email is pouring out
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:05.560]  it's like jones how did you predict that it's incredible don't you feel vindicated
[1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:11.640]  it'd be like if i had binoculars and i lived in say colorada and a giant
[1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:17.000]  forest fire was over the hill and i was able to see it because i had a high house and i told my
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:23.240]  neighbors who i guess weren't watching tv hey a big fire is coming it'll be here probably about
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:28.360]  two a.m you know it's like nine p.m at night they're like oh whatever and then now the fires burned
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:35.240]  everybody's houses down and killed my neighbors and i'm 20 miles away in the next town hearing
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:41.400]  about it they're like are you feeling pretty good right now man you how you must be walking on
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:52.200]  clouds right now uh no i am completely freaked out because you know i always said i'm doubling
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:59.080]  down on evil and i'm having children and i'm gonna we're gonna we're gonna win this thing
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:05.320]  but for the first time in my life i'm not guilty i have children but it's like man i better bust
[1:50:05.320 --> 1:50:10.680]  my butt right now to turn this around because and you better too because this is bad it's it's
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:15.960]  exactly the attack pattern we thought they'd launch from the research it's it's their best move
[1:50:15.960 --> 1:50:21.080]  and then it comes out that it's killing
[1:50:22.920 --> 1:50:30.520]  one sixteenth of one percent in the la o numbers and let's say that goes up to half a percent
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:34.920]  or whatever that's like a bad flu and it's killing what the flu would kill old people
[1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:40.680]  this whole thing is insane and others say in the states are all gonna go bankrupt
[1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:47.400]  miss mcconnell this it's just out of control let's go to your phone calls who's been holding
[1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:52.760]  the longest here that would be kenny kenny you're on the air from ohio welcome sir
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:51:00.520]  hey happy earth day alex oh which means anti-human day yeah the pope's saying we all deserve this
[1:51:00.520 --> 1:51:09.960]  right now yes sir a um couple things here one with oil being so low and aoc is happy and
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:15.400]  you know content uh where do you see this coming i mean are we gonna make it back
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:20.360]  can we come back personally i don't think we could come back from this i think we're done
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:27.800]  but the good news is the earth is healing oh yeah well we're the problem you know humans are
[1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:31.800]  bad we deserve to starve and die but we gotta lock everything down to save every human even
[1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:36.920]  though it's starving 30 million people are set to die the un says so they're like give us more money
[1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:42.360]  they'll keep that and then make sure everybody dies i mean how sick is that but you just said it
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:48.200]  and what's what's crazy is the democrat states and counties and cities are the ones that are
[1:51:48.200 --> 1:51:53.720]  going to go bankrupt and they love it they love the needles the feces the collapsing
[1:51:53.720 --> 1:51:57.240]  because they think there's always another bailout coming what's going to happen when the average
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:01.560]  snot knows leftist learns the lockdown never ends and they never get a bailout
[1:52:01.560 --> 1:52:08.360]  they'll never learn we see that happening every day with people being brainwashed by what's going
[1:52:08.360 --> 1:52:13.480]  on with this virus right now everybody's scared people are keeping themselves locked down wearing
[1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:19.160]  their nice little masks but yet meanwhile doctors and nurses are on tiktok dancing
[1:52:19.160 --> 1:52:24.280]  having good times in hospitals i don't think it's right well i talked to some family that
[1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:28.440]  works at the biggest va hospital uh one of the biggest in the country i'll just leave it at that
[1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:34.040]  and she said we had one old guy that had a he's fine they locked everything down
[1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:40.040]  and basically everybody's drinking and partying but overall still victims and my wife's read me
[1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:43.640]  these text messages and i'm just like this is ridiculous so i talked to some other family
[1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:49.400]  that works in a big hospital and uh he's a doctor and he was just like no it's a it's like animal
[1:52:49.400 --> 1:52:55.640]  house i said yes drinking partying the nurses you know the doctors are you know one of the most
[1:52:55.640 --> 1:53:01.080]  let's just say loose groups as doctors and nurses it's like a talk about a porn movie folks i mean
[1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:06.600]  people know about medical stuff that's what goes on these hospitals and so it is just party time
[1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:11.880]  and it's like oh they're so tough they're so incredible uh most these hospitals are doing
[1:53:11.880 --> 1:53:16.200]  elective surgeries and it's still a tough job and you've got a lot of work to do they're all happy
[1:53:16.200 --> 1:53:22.760]  because there's nobody in there i mean it's just the hoax of hoaxes but that's why the medical
[1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:27.160]  workers are coming out saying to the people saying open things up going how dare you we're not opening
[1:53:27.160 --> 1:53:33.400]  up there's a party going down inside if the house is a rocking don't come knocking come on in
[1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:36.440]  god bless you sir i appreciate your call kidding

[1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:12.760]  pure uh pro pure well let me just interrupt you because that's my my famous mainstay and i apologize
[1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:17.080]  yeah it's about getting in the mindset of a garden the mindset of getting together with
[1:54:17.080 --> 1:54:21.000]  family and having five acres in the middle of nowhere that's cheap just we've got to start
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:27.160]  realizing it's probably all going to go down if not now later their goal is to collapse it on purpose
[1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:31.800]  and they're collapsing the poor third world and no one's even talking about these people
[1:54:31.800 --> 1:54:37.240]  i mean this is scary man if they can kill them you know we have empathy it's programmed into
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:42.200]  us where we feel and we feel like we care about them but that's that's because it could be us next

[1:54:52.920 --> 1:54:58.200]  profess that jesus christ is my lord and savior and uh hopefully i can give you a couple uh
[1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:04.120]  scriptures for in this man please please please prophesy for us tell us well in the book of
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:09.320]  matthew chapter five it says blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:15.000]  theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:21.080]  shall sell this excuse me shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake
[1:55:21.080 --> 1:55:27.080]  rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the
[1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:34.280]  prophets which were before you and there's another one we're letting our light shine alex and it's
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:39.560]  this is another one in matthew uh let your light so shine before men that they too may
[1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:44.440]  see your good works and glorify your father which art in heaven and just through reading
[1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:48.440]  and scripture and i was raised in the church and i'm just so thankful for that foundation by the
[1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:52.760]  way trish i don't want you to be able to finish up but think about that people that really have
[1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:56.120]  god not the fake demon churches and all the rest of the people that really have god in them
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:01.320]  have a light coming out of them people see it those that don't have no light and the bible
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:06.760]  saying you gotta let that light shine right and i kind of done a parallel you kind of remind me
[1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:10.840]  think of this when they used to look at john the baptist back today oh that crazy man out in the
[1:56:10.840 --> 1:56:16.440]  wilderness well you might get a lot of slack from people but just remember you might be the crazy
[1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:21.080]  man out in the wilderness preaching but you're standing for the truth and i appreciate uh you
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:24.600]  doing that well i don't want to compare myself to john the baptist i got his head cut off but i
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:29.400]  always thought my job was to get people away for the big move that was coming down against us and
[1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:35.320]  yeah he was out wearing you know wearing uh buckskin and harry and yelled and screamed at people
[1:56:35.320 --> 1:56:39.880]  and you know somebody started a fight with him he kicked their ass so yeah exactly modern world
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:45.160]  teaches that christians are these little whims that roll over but that's not uh what really
[1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:52.120]  happened with with christians and people of god jesus was super tough obviously and he did beat up
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:57.240]  the money changers because they were satanic but but he was there to show people the real strength
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:02.520]  of being able to be the sacrifice and so that was his role people didn't see that as wimping
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:06.760]  because they don't have to it's the opposite of being a wimp it's very strong to turn yourself over
[1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:11.080]  to be tortured to death for the people and to take on their sins because if you think being tortured
[1:57:11.080 --> 1:57:15.800]  to death was bad he says christ took on all the sin that had happened the current sin and all sin
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:21.800]  to come meaning he experienced it every child being raped every person being killed every form of
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:28.440]  satanism every sin ever god literally took it on to transmute it so that god could take us
[1:57:28.440 --> 1:57:32.840]  into him even though he's perfect he had to take it on and you read that when you're little it
[1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:37.480]  doesn't make sense now it makes total sense the ultimate ritual the creator of the universe
[1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:42.040]  projected down into a single body hold on trace don't hang up i want you to finish up when you

[2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:54.040]  life no man coming to the father but by me there's no way to help to have him but through with the
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:01:00.520]  bridge that jesus did for us and paid our send that and um the caller when they screened the call
[2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:07.480]  i'm in michigan here with this lovely whitler as our governor i signed the petition as you know
[2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:14.920]  i did buy some storable seats too by the way and uh from the store there but uh i work in a food
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:22.680]  warehouse and my son also uh tape works in the warehouse as well and uh it's just amazing to see
[2:01:22.680 --> 2:01:28.200]  how thin the the supply chain is getting because well the trucks we do get come in the stuff goes
[2:01:28.200 --> 2:01:33.400]  right out and i am very thankful to have a job and hey everybody out there worldwide everybody's
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:37.880]  essential but you're seeing when i tell people that we're talking to big food companies and they're
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:42.600]  all running out and all getting low and then now things are breaking down and there's a depression
[2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:46.680]  which is already starting it's going to be devastating all these folks that are getting into
[2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:50.760]  this shutdown they're going to get a little taste of what the third world's getting right now
[2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:56.360]  now yeah that's that's the scary part you know and i my heart goes out to all those people and
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:00.920]  actually you know what though this country we've been so blessed for so long and it's like i look
[2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:06.840]  at it for granted for what's on my plate you know better it's it's not what by the way can you believe
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:13.080]  that literally what what a book two thousand years ago said is now unfolding and i was talking
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:17.640]  to an atheist they go well people just took the idea of the mark the beast and and are manifesting
[2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:23.000]  it because it's it's a way to control people and i go really you think that's what it is really you
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:28.600]  think so no those people have never had the spiritual experiences those of us have had and
[2:02:28.600 --> 2:02:33.560]  i won't get into those but i've literally had hundreds of dreams that come exactly true that i
[2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:38.440]  tell people about and other stuff i won't even get into air because they'll use it against me but
[2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:44.440]  those of us that have experienced it they can see past the veil uh yeah have have and it's not
[2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:49.400]  something i even want to do it's it's pretty horrific stuff folks because there's a lot of
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:53.240]  noise in the universe and let me just tell you most of it's bad stuff down at this level
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:59.560]  but it's an amazing time anything else trash i would just like to say thank you all the truck
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:05.640]  drivers out there my dad was a truck driver and my husband was a truck driver my dad passed away
[2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:11.560]  actually this year which my dad was a comedian and he passed away on february 29th of course this was
[2:03:11.560 --> 2:03:15.880]  before they were doing any kind of testing sorry i'm choking up a little bit but he's in a much
[2:03:15.880 --> 2:03:21.400]  better place and i don't have to worry about what we're going through now well his spirits his
[2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:26.440]  spirits a hundred percent real your father is a hundred percent a trillion percent more powerful
[2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:32.360]  than he ever was if he was right with god right but anyways i just want to let you know that i'm
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:37.800]  praying for everybody there in the country here that you know because as we see the day approaching
[2:03:37.800 --> 2:03:42.680]  we're we're to draw closer the lord and he will draw closer to us just stay strong now and by the
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:48.760]  way i said i would cover this earlier i didn't get to it but i if you go to info wars.com or
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:52.920]  band up video and we have articles about mark the beast and the digital mark and you have to
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:04:00.120]  have us to buy and sell and the fake christians are just savaging in there going no the the the
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:05.960]  rapture has to happen first you're of the devil warning people against this
[2:04:05.960 --> 2:04:10.840]  and the and the barcode six six six it's all precursors of that there are many anti christ
[2:04:10.840 --> 2:04:15.960]  and then now this code is six six six in the patent and it's world government it's evil
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:23.560]  it's taking control and it's the fake christians saying i'm bad because they are scared and they
[2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:28.520]  don't want to stand against the beast well god's gonna say i don't know you when they stand before

[2:06:59.480 --> 2:07:06.600]  on info wars.com it needs to be shared the v-series nine years ago the remake totally predicted the
[2:07:06.600 --> 2:07:11.640]  medical tyranny belomal indicates vaccines that are tainted with tracking chips to buy and sell
[2:07:11.640 --> 2:07:18.120]  so in a fictitious alien takeover this is the worst that riders could come up with and it turns out
[2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:25.640]  it's what actually the rockerfiller foundation in 2010 wrote about so it's predicted programming
[2:07:25.640 --> 2:07:31.400]  the simpson's also predicted it here's part of that report though unlike you we don't divide
[2:07:31.400 --> 2:07:38.040]  ourselves into countries we're one united people this is the day i've been looking forward to for
[2:07:38.040 --> 2:07:42.840]  a long time we're honored and privileged to be able to assist mankind with our knowledge and
[2:07:42.840 --> 2:07:49.560]  technology the visitors didn't just get here they've been here for years for decades they've
[2:07:49.560 --> 2:07:55.000]  been implementing a plan that will result in the extermination of every man woman and child
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:08:00.280]  on the face of this earth behind closed doors on this new york campus a secret gathering of some
[2:08:00.280 --> 2:08:06.120]  of the world's most powerful people gays buffett bloomberg winfrey together with others at the
[2:08:06.120 --> 2:08:12.040]  meeting including george soros ted turner david rockerfeller that much money that much power
[2:08:12.040 --> 2:08:18.280]  around one table it begs the question what were they doing what were they scheming probably one
[2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:22.680]  of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero but let's let's take a look these
[2:08:22.680 --> 2:08:29.640]  posing as humans established themselves in all facets of life would be business government
[2:08:29.640 --> 2:08:37.000]  and religion the military it took years and what's embedded among us they set out to cause
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:47.320]  worldwide instability a new world order can unnecessary wars economic meltdown faith twisted
[2:08:47.320 --> 2:08:53.800]  into extremism what difference at this point does it make tonight we're announcing the expansion
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:08:59.160]  of our healing centers the goal is to open one in every major city across the world
[2:08:59.160 --> 2:09:07.480]  we want to provide complete medical services to all you're talking about universal health care
[2:09:07.480 --> 2:09:14.120]  the idea of a medicare for all but that's called the death panel i believe that's what you call it
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:20.440]  yes they gain trust with the promise of friendship and technology and of course all they're really
[2:09:20.440 --> 2:09:27.800]  doing is positioning themselves as the saviors of mankind you've agreed that you're going to
[2:09:27.800 --> 2:09:31.480]  spend more than a hundred million dollars on this what where is that money being spent you
[2:09:32.120 --> 2:09:39.160]  warned everybody about this in a ted talk in 2015 you predicted this would happen if anything
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:46.200]  kills over 10 million people in the next few decades it's most likely to be a highly infectious
[2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:51.960]  virus rather than a war we also have ambitious goals for getting vaccine coverage up how do you
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:58.840]  see us acclimating back into a normal life when we don't have the cure for this and of course all
[2:09:58.840 --> 2:10:05.240]  they're really doing is positioning themselves as the saviors they won't be back to normal until
[2:10:05.240 --> 2:10:16.280]  we either have that phenomenal vaccine where the vitamin is that no it's the flu vaccine what human
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:22.120]  vaccine they're not mixing their drug into the vitamin shot they're mixing it into our flu vaccine
[2:10:25.080 --> 2:10:31.560]  the shipment leaves tomorrow there's an approach called the RNA vaccine that people like
[2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:40.200]  maderna cure back and others are using that in 2015 we'd identified that is very promising
[2:10:40.200 --> 2:10:49.160]  uh for pandemics and for uh other applications as well and for uh other applications as well
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:59.800]  r6 i thought it was r6 it's what they put in the vitamin shot they experimented on people
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:04.680]  examination of the r6 using human technology revealed nothing more than a simple saline shot
[2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:11.240]  but when i used our equipment i found something quite different r6 has a molecular compound
[2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:17.000]  that embeds itself in human dna it interacts with the human genome then emits a wavelength
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:22.200]  of sorts this vaccine actually does that it's just tagging humans like animals in the wild
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:29.960]  eventually what we'll have to have is certificates of who's the recovered person who's a vaccinated

[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:32.600]  government agency is going to be worrying about a flu vaccine where they got to feed vitamin to
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:39.480]  evaluate which in all likelihood is nothing more than a vitamin shot they know exactly how to play

[2:14:01.480 --> 2:14:08.920]  billion uh of those is is going to be an incredible challenge this is the day i've been looking forward
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:16.680]  to for a long time a lot of us here have been talking over the months ahead trying to make sure
[2:14:16.680 --> 2:14:23.480]  that we get everyone to show up and and do absolutely the best they can for vaccination

[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:37.480]  them died other causes if you believe that number you put it into four hundred thousand
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:44.920]  you get zero point one six five seven four nine nine nine not even a fraction of one percent
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:50.760]  and those numbers are coming out everywhere but you're told the great depression is good

[2:18:56.200 --> 2:18:59.320]  how do you put a people under house arrest how do you put them under siege
[2:18:59.320 --> 2:19:05.160]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with
[2:19:05.160 --> 2:19:10.560]  the globalist deep state and then had China release to then take down the populist president
[2:19:10.560 --> 2:19:14.760]  and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[2:19:14.760 --> 2:19:18.600]  Bill Maher even admitted it, man, I hope we have a depression, and now they've tailored
[2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:24.400]  the whole thing with the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country
[2:19:24.400 --> 2:19:29.240]  closed along with the help of the blue states and blue states all the time blaming Trump
[2:19:29.240 --> 2:19:32.680]  and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:37.960]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us, but as for me, I'm not sitting
[2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:39.680]  here and I'm not taking it.
[2:19:39.680 --> 2:19:43.360]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:46.160]  safe, but that's not what they're doing.
[2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:52.000]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health,
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:20:17.560]  our whole world and committing millions of third world people to death.
[2:20:17.560 --> 2:20:30.160]  We are back live.
[2:20:30.160 --> 2:20:32.600]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[2:20:32.600 --> 2:20:36.280]  Your phone calls are coming up a bunch of special reports haven't gotten to David Knight
[2:20:36.280 --> 2:20:39.560]  joined us in the fourth hour.
[2:20:39.560 --> 2:20:45.280]  The huge news has come out LA County says 400,000 plus cases they project from the testing
[2:20:45.280 --> 2:20:55.200]  and the statistics they have and that that is 0.16 deaths or a fraction of 1%.
[2:20:55.200 --> 2:21:00.600]  So as the testing increases, we find this out, but regardless, Texans find $4,000 for
[2:21:00.600 --> 2:21:02.760]  violating COVID-19 curfew.
[2:21:02.760 --> 2:21:09.280]  Each member of the family in the car, $12,000.
[2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:13.760]  So it's happening all over the country, the disgusting out of control power grabs.
[2:21:13.760 --> 2:21:20.560]  But the good news is as we go to Andrew Torba, founder of GAB, people are fighting back.
[2:21:20.560 --> 2:21:26.240]  And so to the Attorney General's credit, he has come out and said that it sounds a lot
[2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:30.760]  like house arrest to him.
[2:21:30.760 --> 2:21:33.840]  These lock down orders telling you you're not essential stay in your house.
[2:21:33.840 --> 2:21:34.840]  Here it is.
[2:21:34.840 --> 2:21:40.520]  And the idea that you have to stay in your house is disturbingly close to house arrest.
[2:21:40.520 --> 2:21:45.280]  I'm not saying it wasn't justified and not saying in some places it might be still justified,
[2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:48.800]  but it's a very onerous as is shutting down your livelihood.
[2:21:48.800 --> 2:21:56.400]  So these are very, very burdensome contingents on liberties and we adopted them.
[2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:01.400]  We have to remember for the limited purpose of slowing down the spread that is bending
[2:22:01.400 --> 2:22:02.400]  the curve.
[2:22:02.400 --> 2:22:08.160]  We didn't adopt them as the comprehensive way of dealing with this disease.
[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:13.000]  And we have now are seeing that these are bending the curve and now we have to come
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:15.960]  up with more targeted approaches.
[2:22:15.960 --> 2:22:20.800]  I mean, this is a little bit like, you know, fighting a cancer, which is, you know, sometimes
[2:22:20.800 --> 2:22:23.120]  cancer is spreading.
[2:22:23.120 --> 2:22:27.960]  And one of the treatments you can use is chemotherapy to drive it back and localize it and make
[2:22:27.960 --> 2:22:33.920]  it more susceptible to surgery or more targeted thing like radiation or even immunotherapy.
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:38.680]  But your first thing is to drive it back to a manager, more manageable state.
[2:22:38.680 --> 2:22:40.760]  And that's what we're doing and have done.
[2:22:40.760 --> 2:22:45.160]  And the question is, you can't, you can't just keep on feeding the patient chemotherapy
[2:22:45.160 --> 2:22:48.880]  and say, well, we're killing the cancer because we're getting to the point where we're killing
[2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:50.400]  the patient.
[2:22:50.400 --> 2:22:53.640]  And now is the time that we have to start looking ahead and shifting to more.
[2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:58.720]  But that was always the plan because the globalists see humanity as a cancer and they want full
[2:22:58.720 --> 2:22:59.720]  control.
[2:22:59.720 --> 2:23:07.520]  But Trump was stampeded into the reaction, now they say, one death is Trump's fault.
[2:23:07.520 --> 2:23:12.840]  And they can name any common cold as coronavirus and then count that old person that dies is
[2:23:12.840 --> 2:23:13.840]  that.
[2:23:13.840 --> 2:23:14.840]  It's an incredible time.
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:17.760]  I wanted to get Andrew Torbaugh on a few weeks ago, but he's on with us now.
[2:23:17.760 --> 2:23:22.960]  And wow, we've got Facebook going around saying, if you protest the lockdown, they'll ban
[2:23:22.960 --> 2:23:23.960]  you.
[2:23:23.960 --> 2:23:28.520]  They've just expanded it to everybody, Twitter censoring of the president of Brazil and the
[2:23:28.520 --> 2:23:30.280]  president of the United States.
[2:23:30.280 --> 2:23:35.480]  But GABS launched really great things like, you know, videoconferencing and so much more.
[2:23:35.480 --> 2:23:40.680]  So the center.com as well and gab.com, Andrew, great to know there's a few outposts out there
[2:23:40.680 --> 2:23:43.280]  of freedom other than info wars.
[2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:45.560]  Good to have you on with us.
[2:23:45.560 --> 2:23:47.280]  Great to be here as always, Alex.
[2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:52.040]  There's a lot going on, obviously in the world, things have changed, but I'm optimistic.
[2:23:52.040 --> 2:23:53.040]  GABS is growing.
[2:23:53.040 --> 2:23:54.520]  I'm growing closer with God.
[2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:58.720]  I'm growing closer with my family spending time with my wife and daughter.
[2:23:58.720 --> 2:24:00.480]  So I'm trying to be optimistic through all of this.
[2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:06.880]  And I'm knowing that our team is working very hard to build the viable alternative ecosystem.
[2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:10.400]  You know, we started out as a Twitter alternative, but we've become so much more.
[2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:12.280]  We now have a web browser.
[2:24:12.280 --> 2:24:13.680]  We have a news source.
[2:24:13.680 --> 2:24:18.240]  We have a videoconferencing alternative to zoom launching next week.
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:22.520]  So we've been building like crazy and they tried to take us out just like they tried
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:23.520]  to take you out.
[2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:27.400]  But we've both only grown stronger over the past year or two, which is incredible.
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:32.720]  And thanks to the support, I was about to say it's 100 percent because we took action
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:33.720]  or willing to do it.
[2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:38.040]  But the listeners and supporters and users, they are everything.
[2:24:38.040 --> 2:24:39.040]  Absolutely.
[2:24:39.040 --> 2:24:40.040]  Without a doubt.
[2:24:40.040 --> 2:24:42.680]  I mean, we see crazy stuff happening right now.
[2:24:42.680 --> 2:24:44.280]  And you know, I saw all this coming.
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:48.560]  I was living and working in Silicon Valley, working directly with these companies.
[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:51.080]  Know a lot of the folks that work at these companies.
[2:24:51.080 --> 2:24:52.080]  There's crazy stuff.
[2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:57.200]  China is agreeing to restrict anti government content in Vietnam now on behalf of the government.
[2:24:57.200 --> 2:24:58.200]  Right.
[2:24:58.200 --> 2:24:59.600]  These companies are in bed with China.
[2:24:59.600 --> 2:25:01.480]  Also, why are we using ChaiCom software?
[2:25:01.480 --> 2:25:02.840]  Why are we using things like zoom?
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:04.440]  Why are why are our teenagers?
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:09.080]  Why are our youth in this country using things like tick tock, which is owned by the Chinese?
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:10.080]  This is insanity.
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:11.960]  They are getting all of the data.
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:15.600]  They are collecting all of our data, all of our information tracking us everywhere.
[2:25:15.600 --> 2:25:20.040]  The amount of privacy invasion that is going on in these ChaiCom apps is absurd.
[2:25:20.040 --> 2:25:23.600]  So what we're trying to do is build an open source people powered alternative that is
[2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:27.640]  based here in the United States of America built by Americans.
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:30.800]  And that's what we've been doing.
[2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:34.920]  You know, it's really obvious now, they were so busy trying to shut everybody down that
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:36.960]  was independent ahead of this takeover.
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:38.400]  We know they've been cooking it up.
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:42.840]  They admit they've been cooking up this virus release or using any virus to then scare everybody.
[2:25:42.840 --> 2:25:45.760]  I mean, this is really the big tech takeover.
[2:25:45.760 --> 2:25:46.760]  Absolutely.
[2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:50.520]  I mean, you see YouTube CEO saying they're going to ban anybody that goes against the
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:25:51.520]  who guidelines.
[2:25:51.520 --> 2:25:56.480]  You can't say take vitamin C on YouTube or you're going to get demonetized or banned.
[2:25:56.480 --> 2:25:58.200]  This is absolutely insane.
[2:25:58.200 --> 2:26:00.320]  I don't care what the who says.
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:02.360]  I don't care what YouTube says.
[2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:04.640]  I'm going to I'm going to investigate things on my own.
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:05.920]  I'm going to get information on my own.
[2:26:05.920 --> 2:26:09.720]  I'm going to research things on my own like an individual.
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:14.800]  I'm not going to bow down to this religion of scientism, which is which is really the
[2:26:14.800 --> 2:26:15.800]  new religion.
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:16.800]  We're thinking about it.
[2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:21.640]  It's it is the new religion, this scientism, this bow down to the scientists or whatever
[2:26:21.640 --> 2:26:22.640]  they say.
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:25.360]  Well, the problem is that we have multiple scientists saying conflicting things and
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:27.640]  then you actually look at the data as you were just talking about.
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:31.920]  You see that the death rate is, you know, dramatically low compared to things like suicide
[2:26:31.920 --> 2:26:35.920]  in this country or the drug drug epidemic that is happening in this country.
[2:26:35.920 --> 2:26:41.520]  I'm in Pennsylvania and my governor has has gone off a cliff with the tyranny of what's
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:42.520]  happening here.
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:46.440]  Over the past couple of weeks, it's been insane to see the progression just go into the grocery
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:51.600]  store and seeing how the grocery stores are now funneling people in, you know, like like
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:54.920]  rabbits and counting the amount of people that go in and you're not allowed to enter
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:56.560]  the store unless you have a mask now.
[2:26:56.560 --> 2:27:01.560]  And this hysteria has got to stop and it's all the blue cities and blue states that are
[2:27:01.560 --> 2:27:02.560]  doing it.
[2:27:02.560 --> 2:27:04.080]  And they're so eager to do it yesterday.
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:09.560]  I was in a parking lot at a strip center because I saw my son driving and he said pull
[2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:13.000]  over we were talking and a guy was at the window pointing at me saying put a mask on
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  before you come in here.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.120]  And I went over and the guy was an idiot.
[2:27:16.120 --> 2:27:17.120]  He was an idiot.
[2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:18.720]  It's just total mind control.
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:22.840]  Oh, they don't care about the 30 million currently starving to death because of this in the
[2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:23.840]  third world, though.
[2:27:23.840 --> 2:27:25.960]  Oh, well, that's no big deal.
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:32.160]  Well, Alex, in my county in Pennsylvania, I believe there's maybe 10 total cases, 10
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:33.840]  total cases, zero deaths.
[2:27:33.840 --> 2:27:37.200]  And yet everything in my county is also locked down with the rest of the state.
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:40.560]  You know, the majority of these cases, the majority of these deaths are happening in
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:41.560]  the big inner cities.
[2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:42.560]  So you're old people.
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:47.680]  Remember the movie The Island came out like 15 years ago where where they're really being
[2:27:47.680 --> 2:27:51.480]  harvested for their organs, but they're told they're in this armored city just to protect
[2:27:51.480 --> 2:27:52.480]  them.
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:53.480]  Is there's a virus outside?
[2:27:53.480 --> 2:27:57.440]  I mean, literally, you could tell those go into a hole and let us have your organs.
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:27:58.440]  They do it.
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:00.880]  They told them the virus was out there.
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:01.880]  It's insanity.
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:02.880]  And you know what?
[2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:04.360]  I'm not going to bow down to fear.
[2:28:04.360 --> 2:28:07.600]  The thing that we always have to remember, Alex, is that we have God on our side, right?
[2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:09.880]  We are not of this world, but we have Jesus Christ.
[2:28:09.880 --> 2:28:10.920]  We have God on our side.
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:13.040]  We have our families are getting closer together.
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:14.960]  I'm trying to stay positive throughout all of this.
[2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:19.360]  There's a lot of good things that are happening right now because of this.
[2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:22.640]  In spite of this, this negative thing that's happening and impacting everyone around the
[2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:24.640]  world, I'm trying to stay positive here.
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:30.120]  Andrew, I want to talk about how we fight back when we come back and what you think's
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:33.480]  coming up next in the censorship war is because it is getting insane.
[2:28:33.480 --> 2:28:35.680]  And I want the listeners to know this, and I love you to death.
[2:28:35.680 --> 2:28:36.680]  You're awesome.
[2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:37.680]  Folks, you're the reason we're here.
[2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:41.680]  When I say you're everything, you're everything, when you tell people about GAB, you tell people
[2:28:41.680 --> 2:28:44.760]  about Info Wars, about Band-Aid video, it changes the world.
[2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:46.840]  That's the only reason we're still here getting this out.
[2:28:46.840 --> 2:28:50.200]  And by the way, we're having a devastating effect on the globalist.
[2:28:50.200 --> 2:28:55.160]  You're having a devastating effect on the globalist, so I salute you.
[2:28:55.160 --> 2:28:58.600]  Attention all radio listeners who still need food supplies.
[2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:02.520]  If you've thought about the implication of food-related supply chain disruptions and
[2:29:02.520 --> 2:29:06.680]  are concerned about the coming quarantines, this will be the most important message you
[2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:07.920]  will ever hear.
[2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:08.920]  Here's why.
[2:29:08.920 --> 2:29:12.960]  In the next few days, all Americans will face extremely hard choices.
[2:29:12.960 --> 2:29:18.160]  If we've learned anything from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns
[2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:20.960]  are just a few days away here in the U.S.
[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:26.520]  Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce, you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom
[2:29:26.520 --> 2:29:29.240]  seeds to grow a one-acre crisis garden.
[2:29:29.240 --> 2:29:34.120]  The truth is, growing nutrient-dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single
[2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:36.040]  most important thing you do.
[2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:41.500]  Go to survivalseedbank.com and watch the new video to understand the nature of the threat.
[2:29:41.500 --> 2:29:43.480]  This could be life-saving.
[2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:46.040]  Lockdowns can last from six to eight weeks.
[2:29:46.040 --> 2:29:47.840]  Get free bonus seeds.
[2:29:47.840 --> 2:29:49.480]  Special quarantine reports too.
[2:29:49.480 --> 2:29:51.880]  Go to survivalseedbank.com.
[2:29:51.880 --> 2:29:56.320]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[2:29:56.320 --> 2:30:01.600]  Writing in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that half a billion
[2:30:01.600 --> 2:30:07.920]  people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all
[2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:11.160]  the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[2:30:11.160 --> 2:30:16.280]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and
[2:30:16.280 --> 2:30:20.720]  the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization
[2:30:20.720 --> 2:30:25.800]  with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society,
[2:30:25.800 --> 2:30:28.120]  the depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[2:30:28.120 --> 2:30:29.120]  This is insane.
[2:30:29.120 --> 2:30:31.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[2:30:31.840 --> 2:30:35.080]  You need to get prepared now, you need to get high-quality, storable food now back in
[2:30:35.080 --> 2:30:40.800]  stock at infowarstore.com and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally
[2:30:40.800 --> 2:30:41.800]  everywhere.
[2:30:41.800 --> 2:30:45.760]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people and to send you can't
[2:30:45.760 --> 2:30:48.280]  even challenge verbally social distancing.
[2:30:48.280 --> 2:30:50.120]  This is beyond 1984.
[2:30:50.120 --> 2:30:51.800]  The tyranny of the dual orders here.
[2:30:51.800 --> 2:30:54.200]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the Info War.
[2:30:54.200 --> 2:30:56.960]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[2:30:56.960 --> 2:31:00.960]  Authoritarians across the planet want the power to be able to tell you to stay in your
[2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:04.560]  houses and don't leave and only go where they tell you to go.
[2:31:04.560 --> 2:31:06.560]  It's called martial law.
[2:31:06.560 --> 2:31:08.680]  It's called living in the authoritarian country.
[2:31:08.680 --> 2:31:10.160]  Everybody knows that.
[2:31:10.160 --> 2:31:11.160]  Everybody understands that.
[2:31:11.160 --> 2:31:15.480]  And the Democrats have now shown their hands with the deep state saying we're going to
[2:31:15.480 --> 2:31:20.000]  listen to Fauci and the World Health Organization who've done nothing but put out all this
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:24.280]  fake disinformation so far, we're not going to listen to the president, we're not going
[2:31:24.280 --> 2:31:29.080]  to listen to Congress, but that all these other corporations are going to work in tandem
[2:31:29.080 --> 2:31:33.560]  with Big Tech to surveil and control and keep things shut down.
[2:31:33.560 --> 2:31:36.920]  This is economic warfare and I know everybody understands that.
[2:31:36.920 --> 2:31:41.680]  Public with the president and others need to develop a plan to understand that this is
[2:31:41.680 --> 2:31:47.960]  a global corporate civil war and that we're being held hostage and this is a mutiny against
[2:31:47.960 --> 2:31:50.640]  our country by globalist forces.
[2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:56.840]  Only understanding the reality and the magnitude of that gives us any chance of defeating it.
[2:31:56.840 --> 2:32:01.320]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think, even if it ends up
[2:32:01.320 --> 2:32:05.560]  hurting me short term, I believe in God and I believe in the long run, it'll end up being
[2:32:05.560 --> 2:32:08.800]  better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[2:32:08.800 --> 2:32:12.600]  I understand what comes around, what goes around, what you say and I live that and I
[2:32:12.600 --> 2:32:15.280]  fundamentally just tell you to level and understand it.
[2:32:15.280 --> 2:32:19.360]  Now, if I would have hyped up the virus, it was going to kill 3, 4, 5 million people
[2:32:19.360 --> 2:32:23.880]  like the UN did, I would have told five times more supplements, but you know what, I didn't
[2:32:23.880 --> 2:32:24.880]  do that.
[2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:30.320]  But I said on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient, people are
[2:32:30.320 --> 2:32:35.320]  deficient and I have died and so many other issues, you need those products regardless.
[2:32:35.320 --> 2:32:39.080]  So we started selling out of vitamin mineral fusion, all the other products, I cut the
[2:32:39.080 --> 2:32:46.280]  prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis
[2:32:46.280 --> 2:32:50.520]  to make sure people were incentivized to up their body's offenses.
[2:32:50.520 --> 2:33:20.360]  Now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get your storeable food now.
[2:33:20.520 --> 2:33:29.600]  Susan Wachowski, my brother Ann Wachowski are heavily involved in eugenics, they're
[2:33:29.600 --> 2:33:33.960]  heavily involved in these DNA companies that tell you they're getting your DNA for one
[2:33:33.960 --> 2:33:37.640]  reason, they use it for another, they've been caught doing that and they were brought
[2:33:37.640 --> 2:33:43.440]  in to censor YouTube and take control of it and help suppress folks around the world.
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:50.880]  They go on Brian Stelter's show and talk about how if you don't follow the World Health
[2:33:50.880 --> 2:33:56.840]  Organization's directives, not Congress, not the president, not your own speech, the UN,
[2:33:56.840 --> 2:34:00.400]  you're going to be taken down and they say vitamin C doesn't help you, vitamin D doesn't
[2:34:00.400 --> 2:34:07.520]  help you, silver is horrible, vitamin A is horrible, hydroxychloroquine, even though all
[2:34:07.520 --> 2:34:11.240]  the studies say it's awesome, Bill and Melinda Gates have one study say it isn't.
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:17.040]  There's no hope but vaccines, there's no hope but gene therapy from these wonderful little
[2:34:17.040 --> 2:34:23.400]  ladies and meanwhile Brian Stelter says he crawled out of bed to cry for our pre-pandemic
[2:34:23.400 --> 2:34:28.800]  lives tears that have been waiting a month to escape, the psychotic doesn't know how
[2:34:28.800 --> 2:34:34.800]  ridiculous he sounds, I wanted to share because it feels freeing, see psychos are always trying
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:40.000]  to sound like they have real emotions, no it's not a time for fake invincibility, journals
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:47.800]  are hating this, oh you're a person just like us psycho boy, YouTube CEO, anything that
[2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:57.200]  goes against WHO is a violation of YouTube policies, that's right, you see it's everything.
[2:34:57.200 --> 2:35:01.560]  They'll also ban you if they say that Joe Biden has dementia but it doesn't matter if
[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:05.880]  he clearly does, so these are your new rulers watching, controlling, they didn't just steal
[2:35:05.880 --> 2:35:09.120]  your data, they didn't just destroy your privacy, they didn't just tell authoritarian
[2:35:09.120 --> 2:35:15.120]  states arrest people, now they're gonna tell you what you can and you can't do and by the
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:19.840]  way if you protest they're gonna ban you too, here's what she had to say on Brian the creepiest
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:23.280]  man alive Stelter show.
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:27.960]  You're taking the lie down, that's a pretty aggressive approach, well I'll start this
[2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:34.880]  over again, you're taking the lie down, these people define what's a lie, YouTube was for
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:41.800]  the people and now it's like no, she's involved with Glaxo Smith Klein, I mean these are nasty
[2:35:41.800 --> 2:35:47.160]  people, I'm sorry, yeah Google is a drug company now folks, they're the biggest one, they've
[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:50.920]  merged a bunch of them, so they're not telling you oh by the way I work for a drug company,
[2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:54.960]  my sister's an executive at it and we're pushing the very vaccine on you know, she doesn't
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:58.240]  tell you like in the old days they would on Fox News would cover Rupert Murdoch, they
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:02.080]  go by the way he owns our parent company, they don't do that, she just goes if you
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:06.120]  criticize anything, if you don't talk about Bill Gates as if he's God, we're gonna ban
[2:36:06.120 --> 2:36:10.560]  you, sorry, and don't try to demonstrate we'll ban you for that, I'm a woman though so it's
[2:36:10.560 --> 2:36:15.320]  okay, by the way it's okay that Tim Cook runs death camps because Tim Cook's gay, so it's
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:19.280]  alright, oh sorry let's go back to her.
[2:36:19.280 --> 2:36:23.280]  Just putting in the truth next to the lie, you're taking the lie down, that's a pretty
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:25.200]  aggressive approach.
[2:36:25.200 --> 2:36:33.680]  Well, I mean we do remove across YouTube in non-pandemic times information that is a
[2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:39.560]  violation of our policy and we've had community guidelines since the very beginning of YouTube.
[2:36:39.560 --> 2:36:47.880]  Our policy, our policy is you're non-essential, okay, it's a policy, it changes and we've
[2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:53.080]  had rules forever, you know, when we bought YouTube and now there's no free space, that's
[2:36:53.080 --> 2:36:56.960]  okay because I act all non-threatening like this, it doesn't matter I'm coming with a
[2:36:56.960 --> 2:37:02.240]  forced denoculation with my sister or I've got your DNA and I'm selling it because I'm
[2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:05.440]  a woman so I'm sorry let's go back to her.
[2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:09.800]  Had community guidelines since the very beginning of YouTube and we've always, anything that
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:15.240]  is a violation of our policy we do remove it and what was really unique about this was
[2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:20.760]  just how fast moving the COVID-19 crisis was and so we've had to make numerous policy
[2:37:20.760 --> 2:37:23.280]  changes all within a really short period of time.
[2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:30.080]  How fast you stampede this now with less than one tenth of one percent deaths and then most
[2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:35.320]  of it is a zinc deficiency crisis, let's let's finish up.
[2:37:35.320 --> 2:37:40.040]  A period of time to be able to make sure that we stayed abreast of the changes so for example
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:49.120]  just recently there was a theory that 5G was causing coronavirus symptoms now no established
[2:37:49.120 --> 2:37:52.560]  health organization says that 5G is the source of the issue.
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:56.560]  Suppose again, I'm going to go back to her guess, everyone just pointed out major studies
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:38:00.840]  saying 5G, 4G, all of it lowers fertility, all of it lowers immune system, you can just
[2:38:00.840 --> 2:38:07.200]  type that in, it's Wired Magazine, it's major studies but see she says there's no established
[2:38:07.200 --> 2:38:12.160]  that says that, it's like tobacco is good for you, drug, remember back when there's nothing
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:16.840]  established that cigarettes cause lung cancer, it's the same crap from this woman who by the
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:22.560]  way sadly invested in 5G a lot as well and so is Google.
[2:38:22.560 --> 2:38:28.640]  But again she's like no, people thought that no, Victoria let's you do that, sorry here
[2:38:28.640 --> 2:38:29.640]  we go.
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:36.160]  So established health organization says that 5G is the source of the issue and so that
[2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:42.800]  quickly, we quickly deemed that a violation of our policies with COVID-19 and removed
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:43.800]  that context.
[2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:49.240]  And notice they're having, setting down the spread of communication is like setting down
[2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:53.000]  the spread of a virus, let's go back and look at Stelter where he kind of sharks out there
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:59.600]  for a minute and goes, he kind of goes from the good boy act to showing us, you know what,
[2:38:59.600 --> 2:39:03.920]  well you know what the young ones see, here let's go back.
[2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:07.840]  Everyone's YouTube is different, are there certain videos that basically everybody has
[2:39:07.840 --> 2:39:12.360]  seen because they are so important or they are from such authoritative sources?
[2:39:12.360 --> 2:39:18.440]  Well we definitely saw a really high click-through and all the different public health information
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:25.800]  that we made available but this crisis has just moved so quickly, I think it's just the
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:31.600]  speed of it has taken away everyone in terms of how quickly we moved from just having a
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:37.240]  few infections, right, to having large parts of the world being under quarantine.
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:39.240]  Because they tested positive for a cold.
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:43.320]  Users have changed, so first starting with just really basic information about what was
[2:39:43.320 --> 2:39:49.560]  coronavirus, then we really focused on the stay at home messages and got that and now
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:55.440]  really interestingly we're seeing a lot of users come to us and want to know about life
[2:39:55.440 --> 2:40:01.040]  under quarantine and so we see a lot of interest in things like exercise at home, like how
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:07.200]  do I fix my dishwasher, how do I fix my freezer, how do I get my company to use that for quarantine.
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:12.200]  And so we've definitely seen an evolution across our platform in all these different
[2:40:12.200 --> 2:40:13.200]  ways.
[2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:16.840]  Do you think this crisis has caused YouTube to change in ways that will be long-term?
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:22.600]  I can't listen to it anymore, let's go back to Andrew Torba of Gab Founder, give us your
[2:40:22.600 --> 2:40:26.480]  take on this, tell us about the exciting video conferencing, because I don't want to use
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:31.880]  Zoom that the judges and the courts and the FBI is using and everybody is using but then
[2:40:31.880 --> 2:40:33.960]  it's Chycom Run, yeah.
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:35.600]  Right, absolutely.
[2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:40.000]  I mean there's plenty of articles out there that show, the Intercept had one that showed
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:43.680]  that Zoom has over 700 employees out of China.
[2:40:43.680 --> 2:40:49.680]  They admitted to, openly admitted to Alex, routing call data through Chinese servers.
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:56.040]  So you have hundreds of millions of people now that are using this for church, for school,
[2:40:56.040 --> 2:41:00.360]  for all sorts of things, talking with their friends, governments are using this and who
[2:41:00.360 --> 2:41:03.840]  knows, the Chinese government is probably intercepting all of that call data.
[2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:08.240]  So we saw this going on, we saw these reports of the privacy nightmare with Zoom and the
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:11.840]  shady connections to China and we said, we're going to build our own, just like we did with
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:15.600]  Gab as an alternative to Twitter, just like we did with Decentre as an alternative to
[2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:20.200]  the Chrome browser, Safari browser, Big Tech browsers, we're going to build an alternative
[2:41:20.200 --> 2:41:23.800]  to Zoom and that's going to be coming out next week, we're going to be launching that
[2:41:23.800 --> 2:41:27.960]  into beta, so we're really excited about that, to give people just an option, a choice.
[2:41:27.960 --> 2:41:32.480]  You can use the Chycom connected software or you can use the American built and American
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:33.480]  owned and operated.
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:37.080]  And by the way, if folks get excited about this, it can blow up so huge because they
[2:41:37.080 --> 2:41:41.840]  know you were a big developer out there, they know you're a smart guy and they, they literally
[2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:46.000]  tied you to some white supremacist scumbag that posted something on a message board
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:49.960]  you ran as if you were that, but they failed to shut you down thanks to your supporters
[2:41:49.960 --> 2:41:54.040]  and that's why I said to listeners again, you're not part of the solution, you're it
[2:41:54.040 --> 2:41:55.040]  folks.
[2:41:55.040 --> 2:41:57.600]  Yeah, Andrew Dwarb is a smart guy, he wants to fight tyranny, so do I.
[2:41:57.600 --> 2:42:02.080]  We're just like you, but without each other, we're nothing folks and I know I harp on that
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:07.840]  but man, listeners need to know you are the answer, look in the mirror and I can't wait
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:08.840]  to use your system.
[2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:12.200]  I'm going to tell all these interviewers, all these folks that want me to use Zoom,
[2:42:12.200 --> 2:42:14.720]  I say no, we're going to use GAB system.
[2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:15.720]  What's it going to be called?
[2:42:15.720 --> 2:42:21.280]  It's going to be called on, on by GAB and we're really excited because like you said,
[2:42:21.280 --> 2:42:23.720]  you know, we're 100% funded by our users.
[2:42:23.720 --> 2:42:26.320]  We have 4 million people that are coming to this site every month.
[2:42:26.320 --> 2:42:28.360]  We are user funded, user owned.
[2:42:28.360 --> 2:42:29.360]  We always have them.
[2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:31.360]  We don't have big venture capitalist investors.
[2:42:31.360 --> 2:42:33.240]  We don't have big corporate advertisers.
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:39.680]  Just like M4 Wars, GAB has since it started back in 2016, been 100% funded, owned and
[2:42:39.680 --> 2:42:41.640]  operated by the people.
[2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:45.160]  And we thank all the people out there who have been supporting us and all of our products.
[2:42:45.160 --> 2:42:49.520]  We're really excited to get this out and we can't wait to just offer people an option
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:52.160]  outside of the chatcom software that's out there right now.
[2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:53.160]  All right.
[2:42:53.160 --> 2:42:54.160]  I know you're busy.
[2:42:54.160 --> 2:43:01.440]  I'm going to go to calls, allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:05.640]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:10.080]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:15.520]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:18.320]  the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[2:43:18.320 --> 2:43:23.960]  Powerful, quiet and effective, the breeze uses a four step purification process to help
[2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:26.360]  you breathe easier and cleaner.
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:30.440]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars, but the Alexa Pure
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:35.040]  Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[2:43:35.040 --> 2:43:41.440]  The breeze in the ion cluster patented technology used in the system, eliminate up to 99.97%
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:43.200]  of airborne contaminants.

[2:43:50.800 --> 2:43:54.640]  Check this special today at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:43:54.640 --> 2:43:57.200]  I'm always excited about Infowars Life Products.
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:43:58.200]  They're amazing.
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:43:59.200]  They're cutting edge.
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:00.200]  You love them.
[2:44:00.200 --> 2:44:01.200]  I love them.
[2:44:01.200 --> 2:44:03.240]  And they find the Infowar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:09.840]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:17.600]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:21.920]  And there's another innovation, it's the spray cap.
[2:44:21.920 --> 2:44:27.360]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, you goo, but it's high quality and
[2:44:27.360 --> 2:44:29.480]  aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[2:44:29.480 --> 2:44:32.720]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:37.560]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes, but I just love it personally
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:39.920]  as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[2:44:39.920 --> 2:44:41.680]  So this is a real innovation.
[2:44:41.680 --> 2:44:45.760]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[2:44:45.760 --> 2:44:49.560]  essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out, it smells great.
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:51.480]  It's so refreshing.
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:53.360]  This is a big winner.
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:45:00.960]  10 weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high quality, durable food.
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:05.680]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown, it would
[2:45:05.680 --> 2:45:10.280]  cause, because the globalists were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:12.840]  through the blue cities and blue states.
[2:45:12.840 --> 2:45:17.280]  Now that prediction has come true because the globalists are running an operation.
[2:45:17.280 --> 2:45:21.520]  It's not predictions, we have their battle plans.
[2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:26.520]  So going back more than 8 weeks ago, all major storeable food companies were sold out, except
[2:45:26.520 --> 2:45:29.800]  my Patreon supply, because they're the biggest and we're prepositioning.
[2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:33.600]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be
[2:45:33.600 --> 2:45:37.200]  able to fulfill them in a timely manner, they stopped taking orders till they got caught
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:38.200]  back up.
[2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:41.720]  Well, now they're caught back up, they've got high quality storeable food in stock, ready
[2:45:41.720 --> 2:45:47.320]  to be packaged and shipped to you, get your orders in now at infowarstore.com to go right
[2:45:47.320 --> 2:45:51.720]  at the head of the queue and get delivered to you as fast as possible and from the employer.
[2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:56.240]  Here's to our full food now at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:56.240 --> 2:46:03.560]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:08.920]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes and controls to where family
[2:46:08.920 --> 2:46:14.360]  farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large
[2:46:14.360 --> 2:46:16.080]  corporate conglomerate.
[2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:23.000]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out, they can simply
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:26.960]  look at us and say, because again, you are non-essential.
[2:46:26.960 --> 2:46:29.920]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[2:46:29.920 --> 2:46:34.040]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[2:46:34.040 --> 2:46:37.880]  We can be told to stay on our houses and after all, shut up.
[2:46:37.880 --> 2:46:42.480]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways, it belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists
[2:46:42.480 --> 2:46:43.720]  that have merged with machines.
[2:46:43.720 --> 2:46:46.720]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[2:46:46.720 --> 2:46:49.800]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[2:46:49.800 --> 2:47:19.360]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:28.160]  Man, it is crazy what's on InfoWars.com, Paul Joseph Watson has said, is this the
[2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:32.000]  new normal, martial law total collapse?
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:36.360]  They promise it's only a few weeks, no, that was just getting the handcuffs on, especially
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:37.360]  young women.
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:40.960]  Some guy puts a gun to your head and says, just put these handcuffs on, everything will
[2:47:40.960 --> 2:47:44.400]  be all right, you better run for your life, he may shoot you, but you get in that vehicle,
[2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:45.400]  you're dead.
[2:47:45.400 --> 2:47:47.320]  He's going to torture you to death.
[2:47:47.320 --> 2:47:52.720]  So we got the handcuffs on us now, there's still time to maybe click the door lock and
[2:47:52.720 --> 2:47:56.440]  jump out and roll down the highway, it's still going to be rough or you can get taken to
[2:47:56.440 --> 2:48:00.880]  that farmhouse and America wants to be in the farmhouse.
[2:48:00.880 --> 2:48:03.360]  You want to be there with him raping and pulling your teeth out with pliers.
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:04.920]  So don't worry, it's going to happen.
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:10.840]  I know our regular listeners aren't like that, but man, for the average person, you are screwed.
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:13.720]  We got something really crazy I'm about to get to right now.
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:17.520]  There is also video of women being arrested for playground with their children and empty
[2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:18.520]  playgrounds.
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:25.320]  They, you know, they almost arrested the goat when he was down in Florida doing football,
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:28.320]  you know, training in a, in a, in a park doing push-ups.
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:33.040]  I mean, it's just the police are just bureaucrats that follow their orders.
[2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:39.360]  I'm not even enemies with the average police officer, but this is a takeover and us not
[2:48:39.360 --> 2:48:42.520]  saying no and not taking control of our governments has allowed this.
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:47.320]  Senator Torba of GAB, what are you making closing of this power grab and how far it's
[2:48:47.320 --> 2:48:52.840]  gone and the head of Facebook saying, yeah, we're going to block anybody and ban people
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:57.200]  that try to protest being permanently locked down, the new normals being permanently locked
[2:48:57.200 --> 2:48:58.200]  down.
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:02.920]  Alex, my favorite thing about what's going on on Facebook right now is they're issuing
[2:49:02.920 --> 2:49:08.680]  warnings to users who have clicked on a coronavirus quote misinformation.
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:13.280]  And then the story broke that a Facebook fact checker, who is a part of the team that is
[2:49:13.280 --> 2:49:19.960]  making sure that what is being posted is within the acceptable authoritative narrative, turns
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:22.840]  out that person worked at the Wuhan Biolab, right?
[2:49:22.840 --> 2:49:24.280]  What a coincidence, right?
[2:49:24.280 --> 2:49:25.280]  Very interesting to see that.
[2:49:25.280 --> 2:49:29.160]  He's the head of Facebook science fact checking.
[2:49:29.160 --> 2:49:30.160]  Right.
[2:49:30.160 --> 2:49:31.160]  Exactly.
[2:49:31.160 --> 2:49:38.240]  And she worked at the Wuhan Biolab and is responsible for correcting the record on the Wuhan Biolab
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:39.920]  and what is actually going on.
[2:49:39.920 --> 2:49:44.560]  That is the new level of conflict of interest, just like having Hitler over the Nuremberg
[2:49:44.560 --> 2:49:46.480]  trial.
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:47.480]  It's unbelievable.
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:49.800]  I mean, they're not even hiding this stuff anymore.
[2:49:49.800 --> 2:49:51.480]  They're hiding really in plain sight.
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:56.000]  And I think what we need to do is what we at GAB have been doing, what you at Infowars
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.440]  have been doing for years now, which is building.
[2:49:58.440 --> 2:50:00.600]  We need to build alternative infrastructure.
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:05.360]  We need to build alternative platforms, alternative technology, because as long as we continue
[2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:10.360]  to use these platforms, as long as we continue to rely on these platforms as quote unquote
[2:50:10.360 --> 2:50:15.160]  authoritative sources of information, we're going to lose because we're not playing in
[2:50:15.160 --> 2:50:16.160]  our own battleground.
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:20.480]  And again, they say, oh, build your own thing, but then they come after Infowars, they come
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:21.480]  after GAB.
[2:50:21.480 --> 2:50:26.640]  That's why financial support and word of mouth is not keying its oxygen.
[2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:27.640]  That's how we stay in the fight.
[2:50:27.640 --> 2:50:31.560]  Because let me tell you, it's scary how few platforms are left, my friend.
[2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:32.560]  Absolutely.
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:33.560]  Absolutely.
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:36.600]  You know, we're 100% dependent on our people, right?
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:38.560]  We have no outside venture capitalists.
[2:50:38.560 --> 2:50:40.880]  We have no big corporate sponsors.
[2:50:40.880 --> 2:50:43.320]  All these guys have billions and billions of dollars.
[2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:48.720]  And you know, here we are in a small town in Pennsylvania, living the American dream
[2:50:48.720 --> 2:50:54.120]  and building an alternative that is truly powered by the people, funded by the people.
[2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:55.640]  We have a web browser now.
[2:50:55.640 --> 2:50:56.760]  We have a social network now.
[2:50:56.760 --> 2:50:59.800]  We're about to launch a video conferencing alternative.
[2:50:59.800 --> 2:51:02.520]  We have so many different things and so many different products that we're building because
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:06.440]  these things are essential, but all of them work together for one common purpose, which
[2:51:06.440 --> 2:51:11.120]  is to empower people to speak freely and to offer an alternative to the Silicon Valley
[2:51:11.120 --> 2:51:12.120]  Tierney.
[2:51:12.120 --> 2:51:14.440]  And that's what we've been doing for about four years now, and that's what I'm going
[2:51:14.440 --> 2:51:15.440]  to continue to do.
[2:51:15.440 --> 2:51:16.640]  It's absolutely beautiful.
[2:51:16.640 --> 2:51:22.160]  When you launch the new competitor that's not ChyCon Global, it's Run of Zoom in the
[2:51:22.160 --> 2:51:24.640]  next week or so, please come back on the day.
[2:51:24.640 --> 2:51:25.640]  It's there.
[2:51:25.640 --> 2:51:27.040]  Let's test it out together on air.
[2:51:27.040 --> 2:51:28.040]  I would love to do that with you.
[2:51:28.040 --> 2:51:29.040]  Thank you so much.
[2:51:29.040 --> 2:51:30.040]  That'd be fantastic.
[2:51:30.040 --> 2:51:31.600]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[2:51:31.600 --> 2:51:32.600]  Thank you.
[2:51:32.600 --> 2:51:35.320]  It's innovators like that that are going to save us, and it's your support of innovations
[2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:38.600]  that are going to save us, folks, because you could say, like, that's the arteries in
[2:51:38.600 --> 2:51:41.400]  the heart, but you're the blood and the oxygen supporting it.
[2:51:41.400 --> 2:51:44.960]  And speaking of that, I want to go to some calls, and I'll get to this other creepy thing
[2:51:44.960 --> 2:51:49.600]  that's really important that we need to cover that Daria tried to get me to cover last week
[2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:50.600]  and I didn't cover.
[2:51:50.600 --> 2:51:52.520]  And now it's kind of breaking big, and I'm glad it is.
[2:51:52.520 --> 2:51:57.120]  There's an article about it on Forrest.com, Predictum Programming, Internet Notes, eerie
[2:51:57.120 --> 2:51:58.120]  similarities.
[2:51:58.120 --> 2:52:00.440]  It's not eerie similarities.
[2:52:00.440 --> 2:52:05.360]  In 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in coronavirus pandemic, it is a grim reaper slaughtering
[2:52:05.360 --> 2:52:09.720]  people in mass in a world depopulation event that's beautiful and wonderful, and then the
[2:52:09.720 --> 2:52:13.320]  earth is reborn after we're exterminated and saved.
[2:52:13.320 --> 2:52:17.920]  Yeah, you're like, why in the hell do they do things like this?
[2:52:17.920 --> 2:52:20.480]  They do it because it's a ritual, folks.
[2:52:20.480 --> 2:52:22.320]  They're externalizing their method.
[2:52:22.320 --> 2:52:28.240]  All right, I want to hit a few calls before we end this segment, but our biggest problem
[2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:32.760]  funding our operations around here is that I get so busy and then I don't plug the great
[2:52:32.760 --> 2:52:36.160]  products that you need that are high quality that from what we're doing here.
[2:52:36.160 --> 2:52:43.120]  And so I just want to ask listeners to think about something.
[2:52:43.120 --> 2:52:47.320]  Imagine if M. Volwars wasn't here.
[2:52:47.320 --> 2:52:50.600]  And I can tell you, keeping M. Volwars at the current size, I'd love to be a lot bigger
[2:52:50.600 --> 2:52:55.760]  and more offensive to the globalists, both offensive to what they like and offensive
[2:52:55.760 --> 2:53:00.600]  politically to take down what they're doing, both a offense and offensive.
[2:53:00.600 --> 2:53:04.080]  But it really is you supporting the broadcast when you spread the word, when you pray for
[2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:06.840]  us, when you buy the products that makes the whole world go around.
[2:53:06.840 --> 2:53:08.960]  So I'm not going to belabor this.
[2:53:08.960 --> 2:53:12.240]  I think if you don't have swarable foods right now, you're crazy.
[2:53:12.240 --> 2:53:15.320]  You hear callers calling the work at warehouses that are basically becoming empty, and as
[2:53:15.320 --> 2:53:16.880]  soon as the food comes out, it's gone.
[2:53:16.880 --> 2:53:18.880]  Well, I have the numbers here.
[2:53:18.880 --> 2:53:20.160]  We're going into a depression.
[2:53:20.160 --> 2:53:24.160]  They're talking about everything going belly up, the state's all going bankrupt, starting
[2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:28.320]  with blue states, and they're going to then pull us down with them.
[2:53:28.320 --> 2:53:30.440]  And the leader of the Senate saying, no, we're not going to do that.
[2:53:30.440 --> 2:53:32.440]  We're going to let blue cities and states go down.
[2:53:32.440 --> 2:53:33.440]  We just can't help it.
[2:53:33.440 --> 2:53:35.120]  You're the ones locking the country down.
[2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:38.400]  That is a very positive move, to be honest.
[2:53:38.400 --> 2:53:43.280]  And the Justice Department said, you got people on house arrest.
[2:53:43.280 --> 2:53:47.880]  This is mutiny at the state levels against the country.
[2:53:47.880 --> 2:53:52.560]  This is insane, letting the UN tell you through big tech and through local government when
[2:53:52.560 --> 2:53:56.600]  you can open with something that doesn't even kill 1% of people that are already run down
[2:53:56.600 --> 2:53:57.600]  and sick.
[2:53:57.600 --> 2:54:03.920]  This is us just capitulating the total fear and acting like cowardly hysterics.
[2:54:03.920 --> 2:54:10.680]  Yes, I promote zinc, and I promote vitamin C, and I promote sunlight, and I support
[2:54:10.680 --> 2:54:14.440]  being healthy because if you don't have those things, the regular cold comes along and kills
[2:54:14.440 --> 2:54:15.600]  you that are in the hammer.
[2:54:15.600 --> 2:54:18.800]  That's why they're called essential, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:54:18.800 --> 2:54:24.480]  But separate from that, I look for a day when the federal government says food's not essential.
[2:54:24.480 --> 2:54:25.480]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[2:54:25.480 --> 2:54:28.280]  You ever needed food?
[2:54:28.280 --> 2:54:29.280]  It's ridiculous.
[2:54:29.280 --> 2:54:30.280]  You need food.
[2:54:30.280 --> 2:54:31.280]  We have our quality food.
[2:54:31.280 --> 2:54:34.400]  I will get your orders in now at infowarstore.com.
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:36.400]  We had to suspend orders again for a couple of weeks.
[2:54:36.400 --> 2:54:39.040]  As long as you get your order in, you will get it.
[2:54:39.040 --> 2:54:40.040]  They have the food.
[2:54:40.040 --> 2:54:42.320]  They have to package it and ship it to you.
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:46.480]  But they may suspend orders again when they came back about three weeks ago and said,
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:47.920]  okay, you can do food orders again.
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:48.920]  They've caught up.
[2:54:48.920 --> 2:54:51.760]  In fact, we're ahead of schedule.
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:54.520]  They called us up yesterday, and they said, okay, people figured it out.
[2:54:54.520 --> 2:54:58.800]  They're just buying food, hand over fist right now, and we don't want to raise prices, but
[2:54:58.800 --> 2:55:03.280]  we've already opened up two more factories, and between me, you and the fence post, maybe
[2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:06.480]  in two weeks, they're going to suspend food sales again, and then they're not sure they
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:10.800]  can ever get long-term food orders out the next six months a year.
[2:55:10.800 --> 2:55:12.320]  I mean, it's that crazy.
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:13.600]  It's that insane.
[2:55:13.600 --> 2:55:15.560]  It's that out of control.
[2:55:15.560 --> 2:55:20.120]  I would get your storeable food orders in now and in FullWarStore.com before it's too
[2:55:20.120 --> 2:55:24.720]  late, and then I would do all the other really important things for you and your family that
[2:55:24.720 --> 2:55:30.400]  are no-brainers, because the globalists, we've bowed down to this, not the audience, but
[2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:32.080]  the general public has so much.
[2:55:32.080 --> 2:55:36.000]  They've got all sorts of really nasty bio-weapons ready, and that's why they say, oh, get ready
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:37.160]  for it to cycle.
[2:55:37.160 --> 2:55:41.800]  They can release any number of weaponized cold viruses now and just call it COVID-20,
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:46.520]  COVID-21, and then have the patents of the vaccines, and they've got cold viruses that
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:48.560]  obviously kill a lot more than this one does.
[2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:50.280]  So this is just a beta test.
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:55.200]  We have really gotten a fetal position and urinated all over ourselves collectively,
[2:55:55.200 --> 2:55:58.760]  and so they're just going to hammer the hell out of us.
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:02.480]  Unless the Chai Common Globalist agents get arrested, unless Big Pharma gets shut down
[2:56:02.480 --> 2:56:06.480]  with what they're doing, unless we go into total offense and expose them, they have really
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:09.080]  cracked the code to bring us down.
[2:56:09.080 --> 2:56:15.200]  So I would suggest everybody get prepared now with 8-pack PowerStack, X3, DNA Force Plus,
[2:56:15.200 --> 2:56:19.600]  Living Defense Plus, Limited Edition, InfoWars, COVID-19 masks to get the First Amendment
[2:56:19.600 --> 2:56:24.960]  out and expose the hoax, Bazo Beach, 40% off, Real Red Pill, Real Ripple Plus, Ultra-12,
[2:56:24.960 --> 2:56:29.800]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Winter Sun, Alexa Pure Breeze, Bodies, Ultra Turmeric Formula,
[2:56:29.800 --> 2:56:37.480]  Turbo Force, Storeable Food, it's all 30% to 60% off right now at InfoWarsTour.com.
[2:56:37.480 --> 2:56:41.880]  And the big thing I do, if you haven't done it yet, is the Turmeric, the X3, X2 should
[2:56:41.880 --> 2:56:48.480]  be back in soon, and I would really, if I was you, take the Winter Sun that we still
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:51.920]  have in stock, sold out for months, it's now back in stock, we've already sold out a half
[2:56:51.920 --> 2:56:56.200]  our stock though, and it has the Vitamin D3 under the tongue, and it has the Vitamin K
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:56:57.880]  with it that's so important.
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:02.160]  And again, the YouTube will ban you, if you say you need Vitamin C, it's essential, you'll
[2:57:02.160 --> 2:57:06.560]  die without Vitamin C, but YouTube is such a cult of satanic demons.
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:10.480]  Instead of I was lying, I should be able to say, hey, you need Vitamin C. I expect them
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:13.080]  again to say, food, you don't need anymore.
[2:57:13.080 --> 2:57:16.200]  And just say, that's a conspiracy theory, and food is not essential.
[2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:20.320]  These people are trash, they want to make you poor to control you, they don't want to
[2:57:20.320 --> 2:57:25.360]  manage uppity, first world nations, and we're being brought to heel right now, and it's
[2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:26.360]  disgusting.
[2:57:26.360 --> 2:57:32.880]  All right, folks that have been holding patiently, like EJ, and Ryan, and John, and Patrick,
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:38.360]  and Ruben, and Sunny, we're going to all of you on the other side in T-minus two minutes,
[2:57:38.360 --> 2:57:43.160]  and then David Nights coming in studio, we'll be right back with the fourth hour and that
[2:57:43.160 --> 2:57:44.160]  big report.
[2:57:44.160 --> 2:57:52.640]  And all of a sudden, the trap snaps, and you're inside, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[2:57:52.640 --> 2:57:58.280]  of years, going back to the Magna Carta in 1215, of hard fought, basic human dignity,
[2:57:58.280 --> 2:58:03.720]  and liberty, and believing that the individual was sovereign, and had basic, unenable rights,
[2:58:03.720 --> 2:58:08.280]  has been absolutely erased just in March.
[2:58:08.280 --> 2:58:15.400]  And the Communist Chinese have been our teachers, and Big Tech has been our controllers, we're
[2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:22.040]  all being introduced now, in the digital straight jacket that depends on us complying with it,
[2:58:22.040 --> 2:58:26.400]  and depends on us all pin pecking each other into submission.
[2:58:26.400 --> 2:58:30.960]  But for all of you out there that have decided to go along with this, mark your calendars
[2:58:30.960 --> 2:58:36.760]  down, and then in a few months, a few years, look at the world, and remember, you did this.
[2:58:36.760 --> 2:58:40.480]  You were the prisoners, you were the slaves, you were the people that crouched down and
[2:58:40.480 --> 2:58:46.680]  licked the hand that fed you, ask for me, give me liberty, or give me death.
[2:58:46.680 --> 2:58:51.800]  It's been sold out for more than four months, but our best selling, vitamin D3 and vitamin
[2:58:51.800 --> 2:58:58.480]  K formula is back in stock, winter sun, in the fall, in the winter, as you know, your
[2:58:58.480 --> 2:59:03.400]  body when you're not getting sunlight on the skin does not produce vitamin D3.
[2:59:03.400 --> 2:59:08.640]  So it's important to be ingested, but a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut.
[2:59:08.640 --> 2:59:13.840]  So you take this formula under the tongue, it tastes sweet naturally, let it sit there
[2:59:13.840 --> 2:59:19.640]  about 30 seconds to a minute, and then you swallow the rest, and it's just amazing.
[2:59:19.640 --> 2:59:24.640]  It's back in stock, and yes, we're going to offer it a 50% off, because that's the right
[2:59:24.640 --> 2:59:28.240]  thing to do during this crisis, so winter sun, 50% off.
[2:59:28.240 --> 2:59:32.040]  We also have ultra 12, highest quality B12.
[2:59:32.040 --> 2:59:37.240]  It is also available, take it out of the tongue, 50% off, infowarstore.com, and we have X3,
[2:59:37.240 --> 2:59:42.360]  even though it's going to sell out, super high quality for a thionine, it is 60% off
[2:59:42.360 --> 2:59:49.280]  because I want you to have it right now, infowarstore.com.
[2:59:49.280 --> 2:59:52.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:22.280]  Hello, can you hear me?
[3:00:22.280 --> 3:00:23.280]  I sure can, brother.
[3:00:23.280 --> 3:00:24.280]  Thanks for calling today.
[3:00:24.280 --> 3:00:25.280]  I appreciate you, Alex.
[3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:29.880]  I've been listening to you for about 12 years, and this is the first time ever I have ever
[3:00:29.880 --> 3:00:32.880]  felt compelled to call in.
[3:00:32.880 --> 3:00:34.440]  Well, good to have you here, brother.
[3:00:34.440 --> 3:00:36.800]  I feel very compelled right now to believe me.
[3:00:36.800 --> 3:00:38.800]  I hear you.
[3:00:38.800 --> 3:00:41.320]  Hosea 4-6, I'll just start that out.
[3:00:41.320 --> 3:00:43.160]  My people shall perish for lack of knowledge.
[3:00:43.160 --> 3:00:47.280]  I think that's really the overarching tent over this world right now.
[3:00:47.280 --> 3:00:52.280]  Yeah, we've got less than 1% dying, and it's like it's the end of the world while the
[3:00:52.280 --> 3:00:57.720]  real economy dies, and while 30 million people are set to starve to death, the UN admits
[3:00:57.720 --> 3:00:59.960]  in the next few months, people go, so what?
[3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:04.960]  They need to die to stop the virus when the virus hadn't even killed 200,000 people worldwide.
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:05.960]  Yep.
[3:01:05.960 --> 3:01:06.960]  Yep.
[3:01:06.960 --> 3:01:11.320]  Now, as I heard your interviews with David Eich, I saw his interview with Brian Rose.
[3:01:11.320 --> 3:01:16.680]  I do know that you kind of disagree on some of the things he talks about, but in my view,
[3:01:16.680 --> 3:01:20.640]  and I'm going to explain, I'm going to try to be like laser focused here and get to all
[3:01:20.640 --> 3:01:21.800]  these points.
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:27.160]  In my view, he's actually 100% dead on, but let me add some things which he did not talk
[3:01:27.160 --> 3:01:28.160]  about.
[3:01:28.160 --> 3:01:34.600]  And what I want to talk about today is the whole topic of virology itself from the start
[3:01:34.600 --> 3:01:38.280]  and where we are today to get us to where we are with COVID-19.
[3:01:38.280 --> 3:01:40.000]  I'm not a virologist.
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:41.400]  I'm not an immunologist.
[3:01:41.400 --> 3:01:43.880]  I am not any of those things.
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:46.840]  Don't, don't, don't preface it while you're on air.
[3:01:46.840 --> 3:01:47.840]  Just get to it.
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:48.840]  Yes, sir.
[3:01:48.840 --> 3:01:49.840]  Okay.
[3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:52.120]  Uh, we always, uh, question the government narrative about every subject.
[3:01:52.120 --> 3:01:56.080]  Have we ever questioned really the narrative about virology as a whole?
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:02:01.720]  So let's start at the beginning, virology was started by Louis Pasteur.
[3:02:01.720 --> 3:02:06.400]  He said in the late 1880s, I've got these molecules are 100 times smaller than bacteria.
[3:02:06.400 --> 3:02:07.400]  They make you sick.
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:13.680]  Funny thing is electron microscope wasn't even, uh, created for 50 years.
[3:02:13.680 --> 3:02:15.280]  He could never have known that.
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:19.680]  And he was exposed 100 years after the fact by Gerard Giesen in the book, uh, The Private
[3:02:19.680 --> 3:02:20.680]  Science by Louis Pasteur.
[3:02:20.680 --> 3:02:22.680]  So let me move on from there.
[3:02:22.680 --> 3:02:23.680]  No, you're right.
[3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:28.040]  All of this is based on stuff where they make science fit into what was already a school
[3:02:28.040 --> 3:02:29.520]  of thought and believed.
[3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:31.640]  We do know there are these little particles out there.
[3:02:31.640 --> 3:02:35.440]  Of course there were smaller particles that was hard to predict, but, but then now they're
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:39.280]  trying to make everything import to the relationship they originally gave it.
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:40.280]  You got it.
[3:02:40.280 --> 3:02:44.960]  That's the result of Dr. Stefan Lenka.
[3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:45.960]  Tell me about it.
[3:02:45.960 --> 3:02:46.960]  Okay.
[3:02:46.960 --> 3:02:53.520]  Stefan Lenka, German, um, biochemist, a couple years back, he put up a hundred thousand
[3:02:53.520 --> 3:02:59.160]  dollar bounty for anybody in the world that could prove to him in court that the measles
[3:02:59.160 --> 3:03:00.160]  virus exists.
[3:03:00.160 --> 3:03:01.160]  Stefan Lenka.
[3:03:01.160 --> 3:03:02.160]  He's out of Germany.
[3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:03.160]  You can look this up.
[3:03:03.160 --> 3:03:08.520]  So it went to a court, a guy named David Barton challenged him, another doctor and said, Hey,
[3:03:08.520 --> 3:03:09.880]  I'm going to prove it.
[3:03:09.880 --> 3:03:12.640]  Our court said, Mr. Lenka, you got to pay him a hundred thousand dollars.
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:14.920]  No, I remember this now.
[3:03:14.920 --> 3:03:16.560]  Not so fast.
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:22.400]  It got put up to the German Supreme Court that that doctor and a bunch of his colleagues,
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:28.040]  other experts could never prove that the virus could ever exist.
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:29.040]  So then we have the MMR.
[3:03:29.040 --> 3:03:33.920]  They've been shooting kids with for how many decades for a virus that they cannot even
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:34.920]  prove exists.
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:35.920]  Okay.
[3:03:35.920 --> 3:03:40.120]  Well, sir, I mean, look, we all argue about viruses and all this.
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:44.480]  They're caught adding things to vaccines and declassified secret testing.
[3:03:44.480 --> 3:03:46.120]  The constant gardeners about that.
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:47.120]  It's fictitious.
[3:03:47.120 --> 3:03:48.400]  You know, it's a fictional deal.
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:52.760]  It's all that the admissions of secret testing by major governments, putting lethal ones
[3:03:52.760 --> 3:03:54.120]  on people are confirmed.
[3:03:54.120 --> 3:03:59.040]  So why do we trust groups that have done secret lethal testing that Bill Gates's father was
[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:01.200]  involved in on record?
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:04.640]  And then Bill Gates says he wants to kill everybody and now he wants to put something
[3:04:04.640 --> 3:04:05.640]  in.
[3:04:05.640 --> 3:04:10.520]  He's ignores all the elephants in the room, whether we argue that viruses are the way
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:14.200]  they say they are viral spread is the way we know.
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:16.800]  Everyone always debates what can't be proven.
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:21.680]  What we know is they've been caught adding stuff in these injections that has nothing
[3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:26.240]  to do with this supposed pathogen they're trying to create immunity for.
[3:04:26.240 --> 3:04:28.640]  So that to me is the gigantic enchilada.
[3:04:28.640 --> 3:04:29.880]  Thank you, Patrick.
[3:04:29.880 --> 3:04:31.960]  But yeah, all of us open for discussion.
[3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:35.200]  How dare anyone say we shouldn't have a discussion?
[3:04:35.200 --> 3:04:39.240]  The guy that says we shouldn't have David Icon or we shouldn't have David Knight on
[3:04:39.240 --> 3:04:40.240]  her.
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:41.560]  We shouldn't have Dr. Boyle on her.
[3:04:41.560 --> 3:04:45.320]  We should have anybody on is a cult member and I'm not some damn cult and I'm on the
[3:04:45.320 --> 3:04:48.560]  payroll of big pharma will be right back.
[3:04:48.560 --> 3:04:55.640]  I'm on the payroll of people stay with us.

[3:06:29.760 --> 3:06:30.960]  Hey Alex can you hear me?
[3:06:30.960 --> 3:06:31.960]  I sure can.
[3:06:31.960 --> 3:06:32.960]  Thanks for calling.
[3:06:32.960 --> 3:06:33.960]  You're welcome.
[3:06:33.960 --> 3:06:35.920]  I'm a long time listener first time caller.
[3:06:35.920 --> 3:06:40.840]  You woke me up to the double narrative in 2011 with Fukushima and I know I'm not supposed
[3:06:40.840 --> 3:06:45.880]  to thank you but without leadership and without vision the Bible says the people perish and
[3:06:45.880 --> 3:06:50.240]  I hate to think where we the people would be without you guys courageously.
[3:06:50.240 --> 3:06:54.520]  Well EJ I just want to thank you and look I mean I'm glad I've been here I'm glad I
[3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:55.520]  was awake.
[3:06:55.520 --> 3:06:59.080]  I just don't want to make it like these other talk shows like I heard limbo and God bless
[3:06:59.080 --> 3:07:04.720]  him I hope he beats the cancer but he's like it prompted a good job I'm not giving my show
[3:07:04.720 --> 3:07:11.600]  you want to come audition and it's that arrogance man we're under total attack and so I'm fighting
[3:07:11.600 --> 3:07:18.680]  back against evil that's not some special thing like if somebody walks at me in a picnic
[3:07:18.680 --> 3:07:23.040]  at the park and started attacking my children I'm going to fight them really hard I might
[3:07:23.040 --> 3:07:26.400]  get my ass kicked but they're about to I'm about try to kill them and I don't want my
[3:07:26.400 --> 3:07:31.560]  wife to say man you're really I would expect my wife to say hey good job I expect her to
[3:07:31.560 --> 3:07:35.520]  go yeah you do what you're supposed to in fact if I need help I expect her to join in
[3:07:35.520 --> 3:07:40.440]  you get what I'm saying it's not heroic to fight exterminist coming for you it is the
[3:07:40.440 --> 3:07:43.440]  default position does that make sense EJ?
[3:07:43.440 --> 3:07:44.440]  It totally does.
[3:07:44.440 --> 3:07:47.400]  Sorry I'm going to shut up go ahead.
[3:07:47.400 --> 3:07:52.080]  Well yesterday I woke up with a scratchy throat and decided to stay home from work and called
[3:07:52.080 --> 3:07:57.160]  my IT department and the person who was helping to set me up remotely lives in the Philippines
[3:07:57.160 --> 3:08:02.840]  and so I started making small talk and asked her how she was experiencing COVID 1984 and
[3:08:02.840 --> 3:08:07.680]  she lives just north of Manila and she started telling me that she's only able to leave her
[3:08:07.680 --> 3:08:12.640]  house once a week and that a local official in a mask comes to her door gives her a piece
[3:08:12.640 --> 3:08:15.320]  of paper so she can leave her house.
[3:08:15.320 --> 3:08:19.640]  Oh yeah I read that the Philippines has the worst martial law on the planet you leave
[3:08:19.640 --> 3:08:22.160]  your house for like like two hours once a week.
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:26.360]  Yeah she has to go on to Facebook so they tell her when to leave her home.
[3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:30.800]  Well you talk about job security for the cops and bureaucrats man I mean this is a disgusting
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:35.760]  wet dream where you can't go to the park unless they say so disgusting.
[3:08:35.760 --> 3:08:36.760]  Exactly and it's huge.
[3:08:36.760 --> 3:08:40.200]  By the way I guarantee you Robert Barnes is going to sue where this woman got arrested
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:42.480]  stories on info wars dot com.
[3:08:42.480 --> 3:08:47.000]  Awesome but yeah they were she was saying that if they're caught violating the order
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:52.040]  that they're arrested and taken to a public holding square for like six hours where for
[3:08:52.040 --> 3:08:56.880]  quote they have to be there sit there for lectures and contemplation.
[3:08:56.880 --> 3:09:02.160]  And so she was telling me too that the district that she lived in they created what's called
[3:09:02.160 --> 3:09:06.280]  the rat challenge where people who go to the wet market will get paid a reward for whoever
[3:09:06.280 --> 3:09:10.600]  catches and traps the most rats in order to keep the markets clean.
[3:09:10.600 --> 3:09:14.840]  And I was just sitting there thinking this sounds like Nazi Germany and I was feeling
[3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:20.120]  so bad for her and then I realized wait a second that's going to be us unless we take
[3:09:20.120 --> 3:09:21.680]  a stand now.
[3:09:21.680 --> 3:09:28.160]  And so I just want to say I decided this week to come out of the closet as an info warrior
[3:09:28.160 --> 3:09:33.120]  and started posting your articles and started sharing the truth.
[3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:37.920]  And it's just like the prophet Jeremiah I feel like who so you can only hear the truth
[3:09:37.920 --> 3:09:42.360]  for so long before it comes to fire in your bones enough to share it.
[3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:47.760]  And I just you're right Alex Courage is contagious because I've started posting and sharing truth
[3:09:47.760 --> 3:09:48.760]  with my friends.
[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:54.560]  They've started sharing our articles to you and you're right we are the answer.
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:57.840]  And thank you to you for creating the open to open America website I've been trying to
[3:09:57.840 --> 3:10:04.760]  log on for since yesterday and there's like a pop up window that says the site is blocked
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:06.680]  due to it being a security threat.
[3:10:06.680 --> 3:10:10.600]  So I don't know what's going on there but I'm just trying to get information and to
[3:10:10.600 --> 3:10:15.280]  be able to attend a rally in Sacramento I heard Owen mentioned and was hoping to come
[3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:18.760]  join you guys and often but I don't know if they're well we're not a big company.
[3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:22.920]  So once we get stuff launched it usually does pretty good but I'm getting a lot of calls
[3:10:22.920 --> 3:10:25.400]  about people not being able to go to the website.
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:29.840]  I just try as best I can it's a real frustration point believe me we're going to have a big
[3:10:29.840 --> 3:10:33.120]  rally here at Saturday in Austin there will be rallies all over the country.
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:39.000]  It's very very important but the point you get out there is that there is a chain reaction
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:43.240]  happening like Jeremiah with a fire in the bones and it's a beautiful thing and we have
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:46.120]  to do it now because all the denial is over.
[3:10:46.120 --> 3:10:49.360]  This is world government out in the open they admit the vaccine wouldn't protect you from
[3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:53.240]  this anyways then what is it well he says oh it's going to have a digital ink so we'll
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:10:56.840]  have a new Microsoft computer code to buy and sell.
[3:10:56.840 --> 3:11:00.560]  And then literally if you go to Band-Aught Video Info Wars any article about the Mark
[3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:04.160]  of the Beast there's all these people going you're going to hell Jones you're a false
[3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:06.200]  profit this is not Mark of the Beast.
[3:11:06.200 --> 3:11:11.920]  We are raptured first and they're never going to fight the Mark of the Beast because they
[3:11:11.920 --> 3:11:17.200]  believe the rapture ideology that they don't have to face the devil or go through this
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:22.800]  and so they support Bill Gates they support Satan and they're so mad at me because they
[3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:25.720]  can't believe they're not going to get teleported out.
[3:11:25.720 --> 3:11:32.000]  The revelation says the dead in Christ are raised up after the devil is bound and put
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:37.080]  into the pit by the archangel a five-year-old can read that and I'm not bashing Christians
[3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:41.800]  that watch all the big shows of left behind and want to believe all this but they're all
[3:11:41.800 --> 3:11:45.520]  going to take the mark they're all going to submit to the beast they're going to turn
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:47.720]  their kids over to the pedophiles too.
[3:11:47.720 --> 3:11:51.320]  Their churches are going to put chips and they go oh it's up the Lord oh you're a love
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:57.480]  chip and and and I'm not being sarcastic because you can't be the mark because they have because
[3:11:57.480 --> 3:11:59.680]  they're going to be raptured you understand.
[3:11:59.680 --> 3:12:05.080]  Thank you EJ I really appreciate your call let's go ahead and talk to Reuben in Texas
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:09.480]  Reuben thanks for calling hey Alex thanks so much for taking my call man I appreciate
[3:12:09.480 --> 3:12:10.480]  it.
[3:12:10.480 --> 3:12:11.480]  Appreciate you brother.
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:14.400]  Before I get to my point I just wanted to say if it wasn't for you hammering the chai
[3:12:14.400 --> 3:12:18.680]  calm hammering or just bringing communism and its bloody history to our attention over
[3:12:18.680 --> 3:12:25.800]  the years me it was 2012 where I started listening so just appreciate that man but yeah to get
[3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:31.680]  to my point I woke up this morning Austin Texas I'm listening to the Travis County
[3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:39.320]  scanner right and I hear a report come in from dispatchers saying that a customer at
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:46.280]  a local privately owned I think tool shopper or something along those lines had reported
[3:12:46.280 --> 3:12:52.040]  another customer for not wearing a mask and you know so the dispatchers asking officers
[3:12:52.040 --> 3:12:57.400]  hey can you know can can can we do anything about that and then the officers was responding
[3:12:57.400 --> 3:13:02.520]  well you know if it wasn't management us making the complaints and we can't really we'll have
[3:13:02.520 --> 3:13:07.600]  to look into it blah blah blah but I mean hey the snitching has come in it's begun it's
[3:13:07.600 --> 3:13:11.840]  scary to see the self shackling of my fellow men in Austin Texas I'm not even from Texas
[3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:15.640]  man I'm from West LA I came out here to do film and acting but man what a mistake but
[3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:21.880]  oh yeah this is like the worst of LA here now but notice it's like the burka we're worried
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:26.000]  about women wearing burkas we all wear this burka to show the shame that we're a human
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:31.480]  and we could be a carrier we're a bad person right right and I have I have people close
[3:13:31.480 --> 3:13:35.920]  to me on the west coast man that actually are in the military and they went to the commissary
[3:13:35.920 --> 3:13:41.600]  this morning and the commissary being the grocery store on base and you know one of

[3:19:58.200 --> 3:20:28.080]  Jones show in 1994 the Simpsons aired a piece about spherical where you chop up little children
[3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:34.160]  grind them into sausages and eat them Hitler had his blood taken and put a little sausage
[3:20:34.160 --> 3:20:40.120]  as he had the higher levels of the SS take like it was priced blood and with this devil
[3:20:40.120 --> 3:20:44.520]  works per lady the New York Times has been promoting attacking us for criticizing you
[3:20:44.520 --> 3:20:49.720]  know she blood lets herself and people drink her blood but she says it's not Satanism David
[3:20:49.720 --> 3:20:56.440]  night yeah that's right nothing to see here let's move on before you take over I wanted
[3:20:56.440 --> 3:21:00.040]  to just hit this because this has been really hot on the internet we covered it back eight
[3:21:00.040 --> 3:21:05.720]  years ago predicted programming internet notes eerie similarities between 2012 Olympic opening
[3:21:05.720 --> 3:21:11.560]  ceremony will roll some b-roll of that and coronavirus pandemic this is mass pandemics
[3:21:11.560 --> 3:21:17.320]  of the Spanish flu 1918 a grim reaper over them and then after it even shows the grim
[3:21:17.320 --> 3:21:23.280]  reaper right there lording over small children and destroying them the earth is reborn and
[3:21:23.280 --> 3:21:28.760]  a new age of goodness begins when the grim reaper kills the children in their beds and
[3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:34.320]  there's even a big covid type cold virus it is a coronavirus right there at the center
[3:21:34.320 --> 3:21:39.120]  of it what why do you think they flaunt such things like this well you see this type of
[3:21:39.120 --> 3:21:44.360]  stuff all the time in terms of symbolism that they have at the CERN you know the center
[3:21:44.360 --> 3:21:50.240]  when they had their bizarre opening ceremony that they had there but this is very specific
[3:21:50.240 --> 3:21:54.920]  isn't it I hadn't seen this yet this is pretty amazing grim reaper and the covid 19 and a
[3:21:54.920 --> 3:21:59.480]  symphony of death killing the children yeah yeah well you know that it's kind of interesting
[3:21:59.480 --> 3:22:02.640]  because you know Michael Moore has come out with his new documentary called planet of
[3:22:02.640 --> 3:22:08.040]  the humans and he says you know we were lied to about all this renewable energy and everything
[3:22:08.040 --> 3:22:12.520]  it's bunk and these people are just doing this to make money imagine that it kind of
[3:22:12.520 --> 3:22:17.920]  figured that out finally but his end solution is of course the same thing kill all the kids
[3:22:17.920 --> 3:22:21.440]  don't have any more children I we got to reduce the population and look at this is eight years
[3:22:21.440 --> 3:22:27.160]  ago yeah rones with witches flying around on brooms killing children and sucking them
[3:22:27.160 --> 3:22:32.360]  into a black hole well you know it's always the same solution isn't it it doesn't matter
[3:22:32.360 --> 3:22:38.360]  whether it's a coronavirus or whether it is the wow it's just amazing it doesn't matter
[3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:43.880]  if it's always child sacrifice look the grim reaper is drawing the child up yeah yeah well
[3:22:43.880 --> 3:22:48.840]  you know 50 years ago the first earth they they were talking about we're gonna have global
[3:22:48.840 --> 3:22:52.320]  cooling it was gonna be a new ice age so we had to kill all the kids and it was immediately
[3:22:52.320 --> 3:22:57.160]  as global warming they did a complete 180 but the solution remained the same no matter
[3:22:57.160 --> 3:23:03.080]  what it is always save the surprise and see that's what this all is is world and the pope
[3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:07.280]  says we deserve to die it's for the earth they're openly giving us their one world religion
[3:23:07.280 --> 3:23:11.800]  their carbon tax shutting our economy off and when we submit we believe we're saving our
[3:23:11.800 --> 3:23:16.560]  economy we're destroying our economy David yeah you know he he said we've sinned against
[3:23:16.560 --> 3:23:21.320]  the earth and there are a lot of orthodox Catholics have pointed out back in the fall
[3:23:21.320 --> 3:23:25.440]  when they're brought in yeah earth worship they even brought in this pocket mama thing
[3:23:25.440 --> 3:23:31.200]  from the Amazon they had a bunch of orthodox Catholics do it in the river there but now
[3:23:31.200 --> 3:23:35.760]  he's saying we've offended the earth and this is basically what we've seen you know from
[3:23:35.760 --> 3:23:40.840]  Aaron Darnowski and Jennifer Lawrence you know when they did mother exclamation mark
[3:23:40.840 --> 3:23:44.400]  but you know Alex when he's talking about this and talking about carbon taxes of course
[3:23:44.400 --> 3:23:51.400]  he's also coming from the liberation theology you know the the marks communism yeah exactly
[3:23:51.400 --> 3:23:56.040]  and more motion broke it down that if they had the 50% carbon cuts by 2025 it'd be a
[3:23:56.040 --> 3:24:00.960]  billion dead well the UN admits to the 10 million dying this year it'll be 30 million
[3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:06.160]  the UN says with the lockdown so that's that's 20 extra million dead but who cares that's
[3:24:06.160 --> 3:24:10.920]  right the earth anyways David right that's right yeah absolutely they're going to they're
[3:24:10.920 --> 3:24:14.480]  going to do that by shutting down the food supply and also shutting down energy you got
[3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:20.080]  AOC celebrating the fact that you know you had negative prices on some futures contracts
[3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:25.240]  on oil you said loves to see shut down as good of the earth yeah even though Venezuela
[3:24:25.240 --> 3:24:29.760]  is causing mass death of their own people since we mentioned it here's more predictive
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:36.760]  programming again right here you have the grim reaper the grim reaper overlooking children
[3:24:36.760 --> 3:24:41.480]  with little grim reapers grabbing them and killing them and giving them to him and this
[3:24:41.480 --> 3:24:49.360]  being worshipped at the London games eight years ago the Olympics here is 1994 so I guess
[3:24:49.360 --> 3:24:55.840]  that's a 26 years ago I wasn't even yeah I was just about to get on air then here they
[3:24:55.840 --> 3:25:06.320]  are ladies and gentlemen showing you what spirit cooking is a tinder you just cut in
[3:25:06.320 --> 3:25:11.760]  line didn't you report to detention order for how long oh about seven minutes a pound
[3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:18.280]  should do it okay I got your German club right here
[3:25:18.280 --> 3:25:34.480]  oh relax kids I've got a gut feeling orders around here somewhere after all isn't there
[3:25:34.480 --> 3:25:39.400]  a little order and all of them they can put child flavoring and Pepsi if they can it's
[3:25:39.400 --> 3:25:42.840]  like the golden child they try to feed him the blood of a sacrifice child to corrupt
[3:25:42.840 --> 3:25:47.640]  him they're showing you every child's the golden child and they believe satanically they can
[3:25:47.640 --> 3:25:52.300]  corrupt you that somehow it gives them entry oh yeah yeah and this is something that's been
[3:25:52.300 --> 3:25:56.240]  widespread in Hollywood I mean so let's go to the next clip there's a longer one of this
[3:25:56.240 --> 3:26:05.280]  but here they are in 1993 talking about a virus meant to bring in total tyranny people
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:12.280]  are so fit here everyone looks like they're not financial services free sunscreen so
[3:26:12.280 --> 3:26:20.120]  progressive do you vaccinate your children of course but not stupid progressive okay
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:27.320]  that's a wrong one but in post this is live no big deal but in post please pretty cupcake
[3:26:27.320 --> 3:26:35.640]  please we played it probably ten times the last month it is titled
[3:26:35.640 --> 3:26:42.440]  Simpsons 1993 predicted COVID-19 lockdown and they're sitting around going we're going
[3:26:42.440 --> 3:26:45.920]  to use the release of a virus put a real one to kill a certain amount of people to cause
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:51.520]  a giant panic and the shutdown of civilization to have full control and force an oculation
[3:26:51.520 --> 3:26:55.080]  and they're just throwing at their face yeah well you know they've gotten what they wanted
[3:26:55.080 --> 3:27:01.120]  I mean you know as they look at this I look at 50 years of what's going on with climate
[3:27:01.120 --> 3:27:06.000]  change in about 50 days they've been able to do this globally they've been able to implement
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:10.880]  the Green New Deal we could call it I guess the CDC New Deal or the NIH New Deal or the
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:15.720]  COVID New Deal but they've been able to get everything that they want Alex and and it
[3:27:15.720 --> 3:27:21.520]  just continues to go and what they want is they want us to have a society that's based
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:25.600]  on austerity they take down our standard of living they want to eliminate families this
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:30.280]  is their whole oh yeah I know a clip we can have it's the John Roberts we played five

[3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:10.240]  writes Michael Snyder the economic collapse block at this point we should no longer speak
[3:30:10.240 --> 3:30:15.920]  of economic collapse as something that will happen in the future it is now here and he
[3:30:15.920 --> 3:30:22.720]  does an excellent job in the article and fours dot com of laying it out this was done by design
[3:30:22.720 --> 3:30:29.000]  Trump fought to open the economy but the hijacked blue cities and states with the chai comms
[3:30:29.000 --> 3:30:34.800]  and with Hollywood and the media held America underwater until we sucked it into our lungs
[3:30:34.800 --> 3:30:39.720]  and now we're lying there like a fish dying there's not much time to get the water out
[3:30:39.720 --> 3:30:44.480]  of our lungs so remember for decades to come when millions starve to death worldwide and
[3:30:44.480 --> 3:30:51.160]  you live in slums with no medicine the globalist did this the globalist did this the globalist
[3:30:51.160 --> 3:30:57.440]  did this the globalist did this hiding in plain view Politico the associated press you
[3:30:57.440 --> 3:31:03.680]  name and admit that a half a billion people extra 500 million are now at the subsistence
[3:31:03.680 --> 3:31:08.960]  starvation level on top of all the millions already starving because the global lockdown
[3:31:08.960 --> 3:31:14.280]  that is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and
[3:31:14.280 --> 3:31:18.720]  the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization
[3:31:18.720 --> 3:31:23.480]  with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society
[3:31:23.480 --> 3:31:27.720]  create a depression and forcibly inoculate everybody this is insane ladies and gentlemen
[3:31:27.720 --> 3:31:32.000]  if they succeed it's over you need to get prepared now you need to get high quality
[3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:36.880]  storeable food now back in stock at info war store dot com and you need to get politically
[3:31:36.880 --> 3:31:41.680]  active and challenge this verbally everywhere big tech is trying to censor everyone right
[3:31:41.680 --> 3:31:45.960]  now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing
[3:31:45.960 --> 3:31:51.000]  this is beyond 1984 the tyranny of the dual orders here get prepared now and spread the
[3:31:51.000 --> 3:31:56.720]  word in the info war you are the paul reveres there's a process where you take a stallion
[3:31:56.720 --> 3:32:01.520]  and you tie him down and you cut his testicles off and then he becomes gelted well that's
[3:32:01.520 --> 3:32:06.080]  what's happening to the entire world right now we're going into deep deep tyranny places
[3:32:06.080 --> 3:32:10.320]  like north korea and china are going to deeper tyranny as well it's all directed by the un
[3:32:10.320 --> 3:32:16.360]  it's all a big cooked up giant plan to absolutely take control of your life bankrupt the economy
[3:32:16.360 --> 3:32:21.560]  and make you dependent on the big mega banks and to get your universal income you're going

[3:32:30.560 --> 3:32:34.280]  you put the handcuffs on they said oh it's just an extended spring break two weeks notice
[3:32:34.280 --> 3:32:39.360]  now it's 18 months two years five years it never ends no one can ever die from a virus
[3:32:39.360 --> 3:32:44.960]  again government will save you it's a takeover it's the opposite they're coming with forced
[3:32:44.960 --> 3:32:49.320]  inoculations on record they'll reduce your fertility lower your immunity and in many
[3:32:49.320 --> 3:32:58.400]  cases kill you and they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people you're listening
[3:32:58.400 --> 3:33:12.400]  to the alex jones show
[3:33:12.400 --> 3:33:20.160]  from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show and now your
[3:33:20.160 --> 3:33:30.640]  host david night this morning i talked about the 50th anniversary of earth day and uh
[3:33:30.640 --> 3:33:35.080]  weekend that's actually a little bit fun to talk about that because i've been watching
[3:33:35.080 --> 3:33:39.920]  these people spin these lies for a very long time it's tempered by the fact that they've
[3:33:39.920 --> 3:33:44.120]  been able to get everything that they want they don't realize that but some of them do
[3:33:44.120 --> 3:33:50.720]  aoc does now she's very excited that the oil business is melting down the problem is is
[3:33:50.720 --> 3:33:54.520]  that there isn't going to be electricity to run the hospitals in new york city aoc maybe
[3:33:54.520 --> 3:34:01.600]  she doesn't understand that and of course it's not just energy it's also food as we
[3:34:01.600 --> 3:34:11.120]  see farmers destroying eggs destroying fresh fruit even potatoes in idaho you had a farmer
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:15.120]  last week i talked about it he was giving away about a million potatoes because he couldn't
[3:34:15.120 --> 3:34:21.840]  sell them the chain of customers the supply chain had been disrupted with the shutdown
[3:34:21.840 --> 3:34:25.880]  of restaurants and we've got a lot of laws that are in place around the country that
[3:34:25.880 --> 3:34:30.120]  don't allow restaurants even though they buy food they process food they make it they deliver
[3:34:30.120 --> 3:34:36.080]  it to your table but no no no in la and in boston and in many other places the restaurants
[3:34:36.080 --> 3:34:41.080]  are not allowed to sell the food as groceries they can only go through the extra steps that
[3:34:41.080 --> 3:34:44.920]  have already been vetted by a local health department but they are not allowing them
[3:34:44.920 --> 3:34:48.280]  to sell groceries so basically just shutting them out so he didn't have anybody to sell
[3:34:48.280 --> 3:34:54.920]  to and he said my farm's been in business for 133 years but i'm not planting any more
[3:34:54.920 --> 3:35:00.840]  potatoes this season this year and so we see as this is all being shut down as the oil
[3:35:00.840 --> 3:35:06.840]  is being shut down gets goes into negative territory about negative thirty seven dollars
[3:35:06.840 --> 3:35:13.200]  to get rid of a contract that was coming due the futures contract and so you think the
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:17.320]  oil producers are going to be producing any more oil do you think the potato farmers the
[3:35:17.320 --> 3:35:24.440]  produce farmers in florida the egg and dairy producers who are being forced to pour their
[3:35:24.440 --> 3:35:27.720]  stuff down the drain or destroy it because they can't even give it away fast enough you
[3:35:27.720 --> 3:35:32.160]  think we're going to have that as well i mean we not only need electricity for the hospitals
[3:35:32.160 --> 3:35:36.800]  we need food for the doctors and the nurses even if you and i aren't important right how
[3:35:36.800 --> 3:35:42.600]  about medicine when you start breaking the supply chain with these lockdowns and these
[3:35:42.600 --> 3:35:47.680]  shutdowns something as oh well it doesn't matter if we have the restaurants right except
[3:35:47.680 --> 3:35:54.880]  it kills the farmers and then that kills food production and so as we look at our way forward
[3:35:54.880 --> 3:35:59.800]  there is some good news on the horizon a lot of people are looking at the system that has
[3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:06.000]  now been imposed on us with just a matter of just a few days and they're saying maybe
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:11.000]  we don't need the government permissions for all these things to begin with a good example
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:15.640]  of this is what's happening in wyoming we have a new law there's reason is pointing
[3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:22.960]  out that is probably the best food freedom law so far they're saying that they've had
[3:36:22.960 --> 3:36:27.040]  a five year old law and they've been adding different amendments to it that would allow
[3:36:27.040 --> 3:36:33.160]  people to have illegal food transactions yes this is the government this is the government
[3:36:33.160 --> 3:36:39.120]  putting their power their bureaucracy ahead of you even being able to get food and so
[3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:44.560]  they said they added an amendment that would add low risk foods such as homemade jams to
[3:36:44.560 --> 3:36:48.880]  be sold in grocery stores to be sold in consumed and restaurants and then there was a new amendment
[3:36:48.880 --> 3:36:55.320]  past last month that is going to take effect in july and they said the new amendment will
[3:36:55.320 --> 3:37:01.360]  allow them to do animal share and so basically what they would do is get the u.s. department
[3:37:01.360 --> 3:37:05.800]  of agriculture and their inspectors out of the business they would sell the animals to
[3:37:05.800 --> 3:37:13.200]  consumers sell shares of the animals to the consumers and then they would essentially
[3:37:13.200 --> 3:37:18.320]  let the consumers eventually have the animals this is something that is not legal in the
[3:37:18.320 --> 3:37:23.240]  other 49 states they said the idea for this bill is simple a rancher on the board the
[3:37:23.240 --> 3:37:29.520]  nonprofit farm to consumer legal defense fund said let ranchers and farmers sell herd shares
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:34.320]  for their animals that way the entire herd is owned by all the customers before slaughter
[3:37:34.320 --> 3:37:38.400]  thereby meeting the exemption standards of the federal law now the rancher doesn't have
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:44.040]  to jump through the hoops of the federal meat inspection act and can utilize the smaller
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:49.480]  mom and pop victors that still exist in some of our small towns I don't know if they exist
[3:37:49.480 --> 3:37:56.320]  in many towns because the mom and pop organizations are the ones that have been hit the hardest
[3:37:56.320 --> 3:38:01.040]  with the shutdowns you know that the big the big retailers the walmart's the cascos and
[3:38:01.040 --> 3:38:06.600]  so forth they're all still in business because they are going to enforce the rules of social
[3:38:06.600 --> 3:38:11.000]  distancing and mask wearing and hopping on your left leg which is going to be coming
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:17.760]  up next week no it's the small mom and pops that are struggling for survival if we can
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:24.280]  do things like this then we can come out of this a better country because we have to realize
[3:38:24.280 --> 3:38:31.280]  that the constitution we should at this point understand the constitution is finally dead
[3:38:31.280 --> 3:38:37.160]  you know stick a fork in it it's done we want to be able to eat but folks we've got to do
[3:38:37.160 --> 3:38:45.040]  something about this as we have a quarantine time coming we have four out of five parents
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:52.200]  according to the UK say then that's about 80% say that they have stronger family bonds
[3:38:52.200 --> 3:38:55.480]  since they're spending more time together during the lockdown they're getting together
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:38:59.040]  they're playing board games they're making puzzles they said they found a quarter of
[3:38:59.040 --> 3:39:05.520]  families have picked up family gardening it's a way for them to bond together it's also
[3:39:05.520 --> 3:39:10.800]  a way to brighten up the backyard it might be a way for you to survive if they completely
[3:39:10.800 --> 3:39:16.800]  destroy the food distribution and make no mistake about it you know we have people
[3:39:16.800 --> 3:39:21.280]  who think they know better than you in Washington the fatal conceit about all that is they don't
[3:39:21.280 --> 3:39:27.880]  even understand what they have broken at this point you know you've broken a lot of people's
[3:39:27.880 --> 3:39:32.120]  spirits to the extent that about 80% of them say well even if we are allowed to come back
[3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:35.640]  out we don't know we're going to do that right away we might stay in place for quite some
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:41.160]  time those 20% to say they're going to do it right away they're probably the 20% that
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:46.160]  are making the country run right now in the first place the good news is that even though
[3:39:46.160 --> 3:39:53.800]  63% of the people like the idea that government has taken more power over their lives we've
[3:39:53.800 --> 3:40:01.120]  got about you know 40% or so that don't like that that want to have the decisions in their
[3:40:01.120 --> 3:40:05.640]  lives made by them and when we have people that are forced to do homeschooling we've
[3:40:05.640 --> 3:40:11.400]  now got about 60 million families that have been forced into homeschooling because schools
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:17.760]  have been locked down and they're starting to realize what homeschoolers have known all
[3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:21.520]  along as they point out with us not only have family bonds grown stronger but community
[3:40:21.520 --> 3:40:27.480]  bonds have gotten stronger as well all that stuff about socialization that was simply
[3:40:27.480 --> 3:40:35.880]  to get you socialist it was not about building community bonds all of us who do homeschooling
[3:40:35.880 --> 3:40:42.160]  know that our kids are related to people of all ages better than people who went through
[3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:48.520]  a rigidly age segregated environment like I did when I grew up and I've seen the homeschoolers
[3:40:48.520 --> 3:40:51.960]  do this as well now they're seeing it 62% of the parents report their children are more
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:56.080]  community minded about half the kids are running errands for their friends and neighbors nearly
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:41:00.520]  three and four respondents say their children are tasked with getting groceries for older
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:04.600]  people in their community in other words they're kind of helping little old ladies across the
[3:41:04.600 --> 3:41:10.800]  street imagine that imagine that instead of being institutionalized also 60% of the parents
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:15.600]  said that they're happier with their partner after just four weeks in quarantine the reality
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:20.400]  is is that as we're starting to experience some of these things as we see the heavy handiness
[3:41:20.400 --> 3:41:25.000]  of the government protectors you know the people who say well we're here to protect
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:28.480]  you but we're not gonna let you have ventilators when they're telling everybody they needed
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:34.120]  ventilators we're here to protect you but we're gonna stand in the way of tests we're
[3:41:34.120 --> 3:41:38.720]  here to protect you but we don't have any way that we can deliver masks and and the
[3:41:38.720 --> 3:41:43.720]  tests that we sent out they're all you contaminated with coronavirus now that was the first round
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:49.120]  of tests that they sent out as you start to see this they start to realize maybe start
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:54.120]  to realize the same people who say that they're putting your health before everything else
[3:41:54.120 --> 3:42:01.360]  the NIH have been funding and spider prohibition has been funding gain of research bio weapon
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:06.440]  research both here in the United States and also giving 3.7 million dollars to the Chinese
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:12.000]  so what's up with this can we take these ideas and can we pull it back I think it's too late
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:16.880]  to do anything about Washington I've said for a long time we've got to cut Washington
[3:42:16.880 --> 3:42:22.720]  off it is a metastasizing cancer and if you can't see that now after what they have done
[3:42:22.720 --> 3:42:28.680]  to all of us and how they have misallocated even this money that they call the cares act
[3:42:28.680 --> 3:42:34.240]  understand that it's spread as well to the governors in various places I think what we're
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:38.120]  gonna have to do is gonna have to start creating communities and we're gonna have to start
[3:42:38.120 --> 3:42:43.200]  watching each other's backs and those communities are going to be built up of families who are
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:54.600]  starting to come together we'll be right back stay with us this ad will only run for a couple
[3:42:54.600 --> 3:43:00.000]  of days because it's about to sell out I notice hey we had a lot of prostagard people love

[3:43:53.480 --> 3:44:01.320]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete non essential
[3:44:01.320 --> 3:44:07.760]  that's why they position it with economic tariffs taxes and controls to our family farms and
[3:44:07.760 --> 3:44:12.720]  industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate
[3:44:12.720 --> 3:44:20.480]  conglomerate that's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out they
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:25.720]  can simply look at us and say because again you are non essential that's what the robots
[3:44:25.720 --> 3:44:30.760]  and all of this is about it's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our
[3:44:30.760 --> 3:44:36.480]  lives we can be told to stay on our houses and after all shut up this world doesn't belong
[3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:41.880]  to people anyways it belongs to the new ai gods the rich elitist that emerged with machines
[3:44:41.880 --> 3:44:46.760]  yeah that sounds completely insane doesn't it that's actually the public plan they're
[3:44:46.760 --> 3:44:54.840]  pushing these people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy it's
[3:44:54.840 --> 3:44:59.100]  time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs the alexa pure pro

[3:46:02.400 --> 3:46:08.200]  sign on to it so guess what happened along came covid nineteen and bill gates celebrating
[3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:13.200]  saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half and that means you're gonna be poor
[3:46:13.200 --> 3:46:19.000]  now and under his control and of course with the medical tyranny comes the force inoculations
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:25.200]  a micro chip that comes with the vaccine and so much more and bill gates admits that seven
[3:46:25.200 --> 3:46:30.240]  hundred thousand people will get sick and die from it so remember folks they're coming

[3:46:53.080 --> 3:47:16.360]  your family you're listening to the alex jones show news analysis reports it's the alex
[3:47:16.360 --> 3:47:28.120]  jones show and now your host david knight welcome back let's talk a little bit about
[3:47:28.120 --> 3:47:33.440]  michael moore's disillusionment it's called planet of the humans and it debuted today
[3:47:33.440 --> 3:47:39.280]  earth day fiftieth anniversary of earth day and he's made it available for free because
[3:47:39.280 --> 3:47:45.440]  that's kind of what it's worth but for what it's worth let's take a look at the education
[3:47:45.440 --> 3:47:51.440]  of michael moore it's taken him a long time 50 years he's not quite caught on but he has
[3:47:51.440 --> 3:47:55.400]  caught on to some of the schemes that have been there from the very beginning there's
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:48:01.800]  an article on counterpoint counterpunch.org i think this is a uk publication and listen
[3:48:01.800 --> 3:48:08.880]  to the way this starts out back in 2007 the environmental organization 350.org was founded
[3:48:08.880 --> 3:48:15.280]  by bill mckibben the name refers to the theory that 350 parts per million of carbon in the
[3:48:15.280 --> 3:48:21.920]  atmosphere is the highest concentration that can occur before the life support system unravels
[3:48:21.920 --> 3:48:29.600]  for good it was already at 385 parts per million when 350 was formed now it's at 410 parts per
[3:48:29.600 --> 3:48:37.840]  million exclamation mark clearly we're losing the battle against climate chaos well i would
[3:48:37.840 --> 3:48:42.400]  say that's one conclusion you could say i would say that you have lost the argument you've
[3:48:42.400 --> 3:48:49.960]  lost the your theory is garbage if we're going to die when it gets to 350 and it was 385 before
[3:48:49.960 --> 3:48:55.920]  you even got your website going and now it's at 410 then obviously this is a bunch of bunk
[3:48:55.920 --> 3:49:00.840]  but as they were going through talking about how this is and the mindset of these type
[3:49:00.840 --> 3:49:07.280]  of people they think this is the most important documentary ever ever maybe even more important
[3:49:07.280 --> 3:49:12.240]  than the convenient lines of algore and they express it this way the bottom line there
[3:49:12.240 --> 3:49:18.600]  are too many clever apes consuming too much too rapidly see this kind of forced austerity
[3:49:18.600 --> 3:49:24.480]  that we have now adopted through the covid lockdown is exactly what these people have
[3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:28.240]  been after from the very beginning and when i looked at this i nearly fell out of my chair
[3:49:28.240 --> 3:49:33.480]  i thought do these people listen to me they said we could power the grid on unicorn farts
[3:49:33.480 --> 3:49:41.080]  i've been laughing at these people complaining that co2 and again they typically don't is
[3:49:41.080 --> 3:49:45.840]  that chris mathews before he left he had on somebody who was preaching about the environment
[3:49:45.840 --> 3:49:50.080]  and he said they said carbon because i just they like to talk about carbon because it
[3:49:50.080 --> 3:49:56.120]  sounds dirty you think of getting you know black soot on your hands and they're referring
[3:49:56.120 --> 3:50:02.240]  to carbon dioxide of course what you and i breathe out and what plants need to survive
[3:50:02.240 --> 3:50:08.080]  this symbiotic relationship here but chris mathews said you know yeah carbon monoxide
[3:50:08.080 --> 3:50:11.720]  that stuff will kill you no no no i'm talking about carbon dioxide they don't know the difference
[3:50:11.720 --> 3:50:16.640]  between carbon carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and so when they talk about it i just so well
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:21.680]  it's unicorn farts but this is we could power the grid on unicorn farts but if we keep on
[3:50:21.680 --> 3:50:27.720]  breeding and consuming worse we'll still eat the planet yeah that's the bottom line that's
[3:50:27.720 --> 3:50:33.120]  from uh michael more that's the wisdom of michael more what if green energy cannot save
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:37.600]  the planet what if wind farms solar panels other green energy projects are not enough
[3:50:37.600 --> 3:50:44.920]  to save the planet and humanity just cannot sustain life as we know it does that mean
[3:50:44.920 --> 3:50:50.160]  that we now get to throw out the un 2030 agenda for sustainability let's take it out well
[3:50:50.160 --> 3:50:54.800]  it's actually already been enacted for a large part of it and they're accustomed to meaning
[3:50:54.800 --> 3:51:01.360]  you to living under that forced austerity they just had a different excuse for they just
[3:51:01.360 --> 3:51:06.360]  pulled out this rationale and put that in and they don't have a problem doing that because
[3:51:06.360 --> 3:51:12.440]  if you go back to 1970 and i remember 1970 i was in high school when they told everybody
[3:51:12.440 --> 3:51:19.880]  that we were going to have a new ice age and within less than 10 years they did a 180 and
[3:51:19.880 --> 3:51:24.360]  said no no we're gonna have global warming but the most interesting thing about that was
[3:51:24.360 --> 3:51:30.800]  not their inaccuracy of their predictions but the fact that regardless of going from
[3:51:30.800 --> 3:51:35.400]  a new ice age to an idea where everything was going to melt and we were going to die
[3:51:35.400 --> 3:51:44.080]  from heat the solution remain the same austerity and eliminating humans that has always been
[3:51:44.080 --> 3:51:49.880]  the same thing regardless of what happens that's always the same solution and so when
[3:51:49.880 --> 3:51:53.080]  he talks about planet of the humans what he's really saying he could have subtitled it
[3:51:53.080 --> 3:51:59.680]  die humans right because he wants to he's referencing you know the planet of the apes
[3:51:59.680 --> 3:52:05.440]  where humanity basically killed itself and so as the guy who is directing it again michael
[3:52:05.440 --> 3:52:12.160]  moore produced this he's got another guy who directed it and this director walks through
[3:52:12.160 --> 3:52:19.120]  like michael moore basically talking to the to the audience and he says the the best solution
[3:52:19.120 --> 3:52:24.280]  is we've got to have fewer children infinite growth will be suicide this is malthusianism
[3:52:24.280 --> 3:52:29.360]  this is the you know the idea that hey look at this look at the cities they are filthy
[3:52:29.360 --> 3:52:34.560]  we've got horses all over the place excrement in the streets and there's more horses and
[3:52:34.560 --> 3:52:40.240]  carriages this year than I've ever seen in my life and if this continues to go this way
[3:52:40.240 --> 3:52:48.120]  we are going to be over our heads in horse excrement and this is the way these guys always
[3:52:48.120 --> 3:52:53.000]  think they never think that somebody's going to develop a car and michael moore says well
[3:52:53.000 --> 3:52:56.040]  I thought electric cars were a good idea but I didn't really think about where the electricity
[3:52:56.040 --> 3:53:01.880]  was coming from well you know michael it always it comes out of the wall of course right the
[3:53:01.880 --> 3:53:06.760]  group that I used to work with we pushed back against the renewable scams that michael moore
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:12.880]  has just figured out and it never failed when we'd have a conference we would ask people
[3:53:12.880 --> 3:53:18.640]  in the audience what is your favorite source of energy and you would always have somebody
[3:53:18.640 --> 3:53:25.480]  say electricity it's not a source it's a product and this is what ALC doesn't understand when
[3:53:25.480 --> 3:53:30.760]  she cheers the idea that people are shutting down oil production everywhere right now you
[3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:37.440]  got a glut right now you're enjoying cheap prices but that isn't going to last if we
[3:53:37.440 --> 3:53:41.480]  have broken the supply chains and this is exactly what these people want to do I assume
[3:53:41.480 --> 3:53:44.720]  that solar panels would last forever he said I didn't know what went into the making of
[3:53:44.720 --> 3:53:51.400]  them he didn't understand and he still doesn't understand the energy equation of that and
[3:53:51.400 --> 3:53:58.840]  so when we look at the the earth persters they're still out there pushing the idea this
[3:53:58.840 --> 3:54:03.000]  is cnn air quality in the u.s. dramatically worse than in prior years says a new state
[3:54:03.000 --> 3:54:08.760]  of the air report I guess they didn't get the memo that the factories are closed the cars
[3:54:08.760 --> 3:54:14.640]  are not going on the highway but you know this this is where we are with these people
[3:54:14.640 --> 3:54:20.520]  if we can move ahead if we can look at some of the things that this is exposed because
[3:54:20.520 --> 3:54:27.000]  they've moved so quickly they may have awakened enough of the people to do something about
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:31.080]  this like I said the vast majority of people are happy with the way things are going they
[3:54:31.080 --> 3:54:33.920]  will give more control of their life over to the government they believe the government
[3:54:33.920 --> 3:54:38.680]  is going to help them you and I know better and a lot of people are getting a heavy dose
[3:54:38.680 --> 3:54:43.480]  of reality that is far more extensive than what Michael Moore has just figured out here's
[3:54:43.480 --> 3:54:50.000]  an example the CDC says that poisonings from cleaners and disinfectants on a sharp rise
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:55.880]  since the pandemic I said calls to poison centers about exposure to cleaners and disinfectants
[3:54:55.880 --> 3:55:02.000]  increased 20% in the first three months of this year they have freaked everybody out
[3:55:02.000 --> 3:55:12.240]  so much about viruses as I said on the program the CDC has turned America ODC OCD obsessive
[3:55:12.240 --> 3:55:17.840]  compulsive disorder that's what we've become to the extent that people are poisoning themselves
[3:55:17.840 --> 3:55:23.160]  trying to disinfect their groceries but there's another poison that's out there there's a
[3:55:23.160 --> 3:55:27.200]  poison that the CDC has been trying to sell us with their lying statistic for a long time
[3:55:27.200 --> 3:55:34.200]  and that's vaccines specifically the MMR vaccine here's their poison could the MMR vaccine
[3:55:34.200 --> 3:55:41.320]  help to protect against coronavirus complications asked the Daily Mail on behalf of the CDC of
[3:55:41.320 --> 3:55:49.520]  course they said people over the age of 65 are most likely to die of COVID-19 MMR vaccination
[3:55:49.520 --> 3:55:55.680]  began in the UK in the 1960s meaning that older people miss the MMR therefore according
[3:55:55.680 --> 3:56:01.240]  to the mindset of these geniuses therefore it's they're dying because they didn't get
[3:56:01.240 --> 3:56:07.360]  the MMR vaccine well no it's not quite that simple minded but pretty much they say that
[3:56:07.360 --> 3:56:12.960]  rubella looks similar it's 29% the same they said of the coronavirus well that means it's
[3:56:12.960 --> 3:56:16.520]  not the same at all we're talking about the planet of the apes playing the humans you
[3:56:16.520 --> 3:56:23.840]  know they're very different but they're a lot closer than rubella and coronavirus and
[3:56:23.840 --> 3:56:29.000]  yeah they said the team has no proof that the MMR vaccine has any impact on COVID-19
[3:56:29.000 --> 3:56:35.600]  patients but a study is warranted and you should get your vaccine yeah they're not
[3:56:35.600 --> 3:56:39.040]  going to talk about stem cells they're not going to talk about the fact that you had
[3:56:39.040 --> 3:56:45.760]  a Chinese doctor in Wuhan who did an experiment with umbilical cord stem cells and found
[3:56:45.760 --> 3:56:50.400]  the not only cured 100% of the patients but it also repaired any damage to their lungs
[3:56:50.400 --> 3:56:54.240]  they don't want to talk about stem cells because that's a cure that doesn't fit their business
[3:56:54.240 --> 3:56:58.880]  model we had Goldman Sachs lecturing the pharmaceutical business that look at this
[3:56:58.880 --> 3:57:05.320]  particular company they cured a disease don't do that they made a 12 billion dollars the
[3:57:05.320 --> 3:57:09.200]  first year and then they were out of business because they cured this particular disease
[3:57:09.200 --> 3:57:14.560]  and we don't even have time to talk about how the now the mainstream media is coming
[3:57:14.560 --> 3:57:22.200]  after hydroxychloroquine the bottom line folks they're using a VA study uh where they went
[3:57:22.200 --> 3:57:27.200]  after the sickest people that they had in the hospital and they didn't give them the
[3:57:27.200 --> 3:57:31.640]  full treatment either but this is the way they will spin it and I wish we had more time
[3:57:31.640 --> 3:57:36.360]  but I'll cover it in detail tomorrow morning at eight o'clock central time nine o'clock
[3:57:36.360 --> 3:57:45.960]  eastern the day of the night show join me then
