[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.853]  Towards the end of the Vietnam War, there was a saying, the war is over if you want it to be.
[00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:13.757]  Well, the coronavirus lockdown and martial law is over if you want it to be.
[00:00:13.757 --> 00:00:28.285]  The LA Times and other major publications are reporting what the health departments are putting out in California, that it turns out now they're doing mass testing, that the majority of the public that's tested has the antibodies for COVID-19.
[00:00:29.506 --> 00:00:39.540]  Because it's the same antibodies and the same genetic material from people that have had the common cold before because that's what the corona family is.
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.242]  So here's the footage.
[00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:42.984]  These numbers have come out from the health departments.
[00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:43.745]  These are confirmed.
[00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:48.012]  We've got similar numbers from New York, Texas, other states.
[00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:58.044]  But John Roberts, one of the main anchors of Fox, today comes walking into the White House briefing room, and he tells one of the other reporters, take the mask off, man.
[00:00:58.044 --> 00:00:59.946]  It's a hoax.
[00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:00.106]  It's 0.1%.
[00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.021]  We have articles on Infowars.com linked to the health department numbers.
[00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:11.103]  It's actually lower than one-tenth of one percent.
[00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:21.109]  This thing is way weaker than the flu, but the media is hyping it like it is bubonic plague or airborne Ebola.
[00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:26.916]  Here is the incredible video that Fox News is confirming is real.
[00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:30.437]  You can take off the mask.
[00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:36.318]  The case fatality rate is 0.1 to 0.3.
[00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:37.559]  That's reassuring.
[00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:40.700]  Everybody here has been vaccinated anyway.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.420]  USC and L.A.
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.181]  County Public Health came out with a study.
[00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:47.082]  They found that there are 7,000 cases in California.
[00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:53.246]  But they really believe that there are anywhere from 221,000 to 442,000 people who were infected.
[00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:53.486]  Really?
[00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:53.866]  Yeah.
[00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:56.568]  So that makes it 0.1 to 0.3.
[00:01:56.568 --> 00:01:58.890]  Is there a study you can give out?
[00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.371]  What are you doing?
[00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:02.932]  Yeah, just give it to them.
[00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:07.175]  So it suggests that the case fatality rate is 0.10.
[00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:08.156]  What else?
[00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:11.718]  Just put your right line with the 40.
[00:02:11.718 --> 00:02:13.199]  Yeah, exactly that.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.141]  That was a hoax.
[00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:20.343]  A lot of people are going to ask this question.
[00:02:20.343 --> 00:02:23.664]  Alex, you said it's a man-made bioweapon out of Wuhan.
[00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:29.368]  They're now confirming that ten weeks after you first broke it with top bioweapons experts.
[00:02:29.368 --> 00:02:31.009]  The guy that wrote the U.S.
[00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.951]  biological weapons law and represents the United Nations.
[00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:36.852]  How suddenly are you saying it's a hoax?
[00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.530]  The mass death numbers are the hoax.
[00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.012]  The shutdown of society is the hoax.
[00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:47.814]  The virus is man-made.
[00:02:47.814 --> 00:02:50.896]  The Nobel Prize winner who discovered HIV has said that.
[00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:54.078]  Major Indian universities have scanned it and said that.
[00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:56.320]  So why is it man-made but still not that deadly?
[00:02:57.403 --> 00:03:22.862]  Because the NIH, Bill and Melinda Gates, the globalist on record, funded China to do it and make it, so that when it got out, it's highly communicable, so everybody gets it, everybody gets scared, everybody wants a vaccine, so they own the test for it, and they own the procedures to treat it, and it's a novel virus, meaning completely new, that they control.
[00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:29.970]  You see, they could never patent the regular cold virus because there's thousands every year.
[00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.595]  They could never patent the flu virus because there's thousands every year.
[00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:37.840]  So they made a chimera that's got at least five different viruses in it.
[00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:51.538]  So that now, when you get it, they can scare you and treat you with AZT and other AIDS drugs, which they admit actually kill more people than it helps.
[00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:53.861]  So that's why it's man-made.
[00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:54.722]  So that when you get...
[00:03:55.783 --> 00:04:12.850]  Tested and are positive for the hoax, they can now go to town on you with their chemicals, with their biologicals, and try to force you to take a vaccine, and try to say we've all got to have a digital ID tied to the fact that we have antibodies for this novel virus they have created.
[00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.731]  This is a way to make every human on earth suspect.
[00:04:16.731 --> 00:04:18.711]  A way to make every human on earth bad.
[00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:21.072]  To make us all wear masks and not trust each other.
[00:04:21.072 --> 00:04:41.016]  And to make the WHO run by Bill and Melinda Gates, the UN, and Communist China the good guys that are going to take control of our society and life and order our economy shut down with blue cities and blue states and Hollywood and the media saying President Trump and Alex Jones are terrorists for trying to reopen the economy.
[00:04:41.736 --> 00:04:43.657]  This is 21st Century War.
[00:04:43.657 --> 00:04:45.037]  This is the PSYOP.
[00:04:45.037 --> 00:04:47.418]  But humanity is awakening.
[00:04:47.418 --> 00:04:50.719]  This information is being censored on Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[00:04:50.719 --> 00:05:00.661]  You at Band.Video and at InfoWars.com watching this are the only hope of sharing this video and explaining to people that it's confirmed coronavirus is a giant hoax.
[00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:02.462]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight.
[00:05:03.662 --> 00:05:11.570]  If other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying, if you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products to fund our operation, the dog doesn't hunt.
[00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.491]  But you get that.
[00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:13.532]  You are patriots.
[00:05:13.532 --> 00:05:18.817]  You are people that live and work in the real world of a race, color, and creed that understand what's happening.
[00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:22.421]  And that's why when you call in to thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick joke.
[00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:22.942]  Thank you.
[00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:24.283]  For what you've done.
[00:05:24.283 --> 00:05:25.324]  We're all in this together.
[00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:27.107]  We believe in the rights of the unborn.
[00:05:27.107 --> 00:05:28.108]  We believe in families.
[00:05:28.108 --> 00:05:29.570]  We believe in the right to self-defense.
[00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.514]  We believe in capitalism in America and Jesus Christ, number one.
[00:05:33.514 --> 00:05:35.377]  And we believe in free speech.
[00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:41.664]  And so the fact that you shop with us, and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing, does everything in the world.
[00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:48.734]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now.
[00:05:48.734 --> 00:05:50.217]  They thought they'd be in charge.
[00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:55.204]  They thought they would have won, but they didn't count on you and I and others coming together.
[00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:56.245]  So God bless you all.
[00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.520]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.720]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.202]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[00:06:14.202 --> 00:06:15.562]  It's Chancellor Sutton.
[00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:16.242]  Damn it!
[00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.322]  Why?
[00:06:17.322 --> 00:06:23.904]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:06:23.904 --> 00:06:26.945]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:34.713]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:06:34.713 --> 00:06:35.734]  You decided, sir.
[00:06:35.734 --> 00:06:36.674]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:06:36.674 --> 00:06:38.314]  You told me every television in London!
[00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:40.435]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:06:40.435 --> 00:06:42.215]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:51.618]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subverting your submission.
[00:06:51.618 --> 00:06:52.038]  Cameras.
[00:06:52.038 --> 00:06:53.078]  We need cameras.
[00:06:53.078 --> 00:06:54.499]  How did this happen?
[00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:55.259]  Who's to blame?
[00:06:56.286 --> 00:06:58.911]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:00.854]  They will be held accountable.
[00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:06.725]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.912]  I know why you did it.
[00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:10.992]  I know you were afraid.
[00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:12.654]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:07:12.654 --> 00:07:13.394]  War?
[00:07:13.394 --> 00:07:14.035]  Terror?
[00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:15.335]  Disease?
[00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:21.780]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:28.165]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:07:28.165 --> 00:07:34.329]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:42.740]  There is a war.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.600]  It's happening now.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.981]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:07:46.981 --> 00:07:49.542]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:51.462]  We are the resistance.
[00:07:51.462 --> 00:08:00.945]  We are the Infowar.
[00:08:00.945 --> 00:08:04.826]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, April 22nd, 2020, and
[00:08:09.963 --> 00:08:19.966]  I have news so insanely important that I'm choking right now.
[00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.547]  I mean, the crew knows this is not theatrics.
[00:08:21.547 --> 00:08:25.608]  They've been watching me the last month here.
[00:08:25.608 --> 00:08:27.869]  This is so incredible.
[00:08:27.869 --> 00:08:33.150]  It's all confirmed.
[00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.731]  Planetary world government
[00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:54.782]  Making humans not essential, cutting us off in the name of protecting us, bankrupting small town America, Main Street America, and killing hundreds of millions of people.
[00:08:54.782 --> 00:08:57.443]  And I don't say this to go, oh look, I'm so smart.
[00:08:57.443 --> 00:08:59.383]  No, no, no, I know the agenda.
[00:08:59.383 --> 00:09:04.165]  I'm watching like a slow motion train wreck, destroying all of our futures.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:25.815]  The World Health Organization and the UN World Food Program are the authors and are in command of the global government and always said they bring in world government using a medical tyranny.
[00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:33.782]  And behind that are the big mega corporations, big pharma and tax-free operations that are eugenics organizations that want to depopulate.
[00:09:38.004 --> 00:09:55.291]  And so I've been harping on the fact that, hey, on average, 8 to 12 million people starve to death a year in the world, die of malnutrition, a cold bug comes by, a flu bug comes by that wouldn't hurt a healthy person, and it kills somebody that's malnourished.
[00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:59.872]  The original British concentration camps were used on the Scots and the Irish.
[00:09:59.872 --> 00:10:01.633]  They were invented against the Scots.
[00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:06.075]  They weren't called concentration camps officially until the Boer War.
[00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:15.968]  In South Africa, with Winston Churchill riding around on his horse, putting out propaganda dispatches.
[00:10:15.968 --> 00:10:24.990]  But these camps are where Andrew Jackson's mother and brother died.
[00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:31.691]  And they just put you in them, and they don't kill you, they just don't give you anything but bread and water once a day.
[00:10:31.691 --> 00:10:35.152]  And on average, most people are dead in about a month.
[00:10:35.694 --> 00:10:48.043]  But you feel good, and you give them a piece of bread, you give them a cup of water, and then they just shrivel up, lay down on the ground, and then die.
[00:10:48.043 --> 00:10:57.170]  And so, I was seeing from numbers I saw three weeks ago, that about two million people are starving to death right now, or dying, in the next month.
[00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.313]  From the numbers I saw, just out of India, it was two million.
[00:11:00.313 --> 00:11:01.554]  So I just went with that one country.
[00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:14.659]  Ladies and gentlemen, the numbers are now in from the UN themselves, who again orchestrate this and then ask for power and control.
[00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:21.105]  30 million are starving to death on top of the 10 million right now.
[00:11:21.105 --> 00:11:24.588]  That's the Globe and Mail, the big Canadian paper.
[00:11:24.588 --> 00:11:27.851]  Again, the magnitude of that.
[00:11:29.315 --> 00:11:32.801]  So last night, I see my son driving down a side road.
[00:11:32.801 --> 00:11:33.462]  He doesn't live with me.
[00:11:33.462 --> 00:11:33.983]  He's grown up.
[00:11:33.983 --> 00:11:37.268]  He's moved out now at 17.
[00:11:37.268 --> 00:11:37.869]  He flags me.
[00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:38.631]  I say, pull in here.
[00:11:41.007 --> 00:11:45.529]  And we pull in to a strip center, and we're not parked in the front row.
[00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:53.433]  We're parked in a side row about 30 feet from a liquor store, from a tanning place, and from an AT&T store.
[00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:57.414]  In fact, we're parked kind of by the AT&T store, maybe 40 feet from the liquor store.
[00:11:57.414 --> 00:12:04.037]  And I see guys with masks putting boxes out front of it, and one of them looks at me and says, put your mask on.
[00:12:04.037 --> 00:12:05.238]  But from a distance, I could see what he was saying.
[00:12:06.946 --> 00:12:08.727]  So I talked to my son, he walks over with me.
[00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:11.729]  I didn't think to shoot footage of this on my phone.
[00:12:11.729 --> 00:12:14.972]  And I go, uh, yeah, dude, I'm not trying to come in and buy your liquor.
[00:12:14.972 --> 00:12:18.014]  And he goes, well, still, you need to wear a mask.
[00:12:18.014 --> 00:12:21.096]  So I start talking and people come out of the store and they go, oh, Alex Jones.
[00:12:21.096 --> 00:12:22.657]  Yeah, it's all a fraud.
[00:12:22.657 --> 00:12:27.440]  Did you see John Roberts today saying it's 0.1% dying?
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.123]  And I said, yeah, that's what a lot of the numbers are showing.
[00:12:32.123 --> 00:12:33.064]  We'll go over that in a moment.
[00:12:33.064 --> 00:12:34.065]  It's beyond bombshell.
[00:12:35.071 --> 00:12:44.986]  So there were the three people in the liquor store coming out when I'm arguing with a guy who's telling me from 30, 40 feet away, hey, put your mask on.
[00:12:44.986 --> 00:12:47.930]  I guess he thought I was coming in the liquor store.
[00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.093]  And so I started trying to show the guy the video.
[00:12:50.093 --> 00:12:50.895]  He didn't want to see it.
[00:12:52.725 --> 00:12:55.789]  And he had this power trip look in his eye, and I said, you're pathetic.
[00:12:55.789 --> 00:13:00.475]  You're being dog-trained to submit in all this six-foot separation.
[00:13:00.475 --> 00:13:03.779]  They're coming out with microchips, they're coming out with forced inoculations.
[00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:09.567]  This is all a setup for medical tyranny, and you're a fool!
[00:13:09.567 --> 00:13:10.869]  And that guy started laughing at me.
[00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:16.378]  And so I just said, listen, I'm not putting you down, you work at a liquor store.
[00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:20.621]  But there's a reason I'm successful and there's a reason you're not.
[00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:22.683]  You are a willful moron.
[00:13:22.683 --> 00:13:28.787]  Had another guy in a gas station the day before that pull that crap.
[00:13:31.598 --> 00:13:33.100]  So that's the reality of where we are.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.782]  If you're wearing a mask, I'm not judging you.
[00:13:34.782 --> 00:13:42.631]  In fact, we ordered a bunch of masks that are coming in next week, so you can pre-order them now, that are nice black masks with InfoWars.com on them.
[00:13:42.631 --> 00:13:46.055]  And if you, in the future, they're saying, this is going to go forever now.
[00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:46.296]  Watch.
[00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:48.442]  It's submission.
[00:13:48.442 --> 00:14:03.671]  So if you got to get on an airplane or you got to go in the grocery store, hey, a light, comfortable cloth one that you can breathe through, go along with the kabuki theater, the submission, but fight back while you're at it and shoot your mouth off the whole time.
[00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:06.993]  Limited edition COVID-19 hoax mask.
[00:14:06.993 --> 00:14:08.474]  I told them to put hoax on the page.
[00:14:08.474 --> 00:14:08.934]  They didn't.
[00:14:08.934 --> 00:14:10.916]  So listeners are like, well, wait, you're saying it's a hoax, but
[00:14:11.943 --> 00:14:14.944]  You're not, but you're selling a mask.
[00:14:14.944 --> 00:14:17.045]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a real virus.
[00:14:17.045 --> 00:14:19.505]  It kills people, just like the flu.
[00:14:19.505 --> 00:14:26.188]  But the hype to say no one could ever die from the flu or from a cold bug again, and this idea, it's like mass shootings.
[00:14:26.188 --> 00:14:28.008]  Again, I've said this a thousand times.
[00:14:28.008 --> 00:14:33.690]  Even Bill Maher came on Friday and Saturday and said mass shootings are terrible, but they only kill about 100 people a year.
[00:14:35.626 --> 00:14:38.007]  Well, he goes, it's the same thing with this.
[00:14:38.007 --> 00:14:42.728]  The flu is terrible, colds are terrible, it kills a lot of old people, but that's what's always happened.
[00:14:42.728 --> 00:14:46.689]  You can't protect people, and that's where it gets crazy.
[00:14:46.689 --> 00:14:51.910]  A vaccine, they admit, won't even protect you from it.
[00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.891]  So why are they doing it?
[00:14:53.891 --> 00:15:02.813]  And now they admit there's hundreds of mutations of it, so why would one, for one mutation, because it's what's in there, and it's a digital vaccine with an ink.
[00:15:03.783 --> 00:15:07.666]  They're rolling out, this has been announced, where you will then buy and sell off that.
[00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:12.510]  They will put credits onto your body because you've taken the shot.
[00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:18.655]  They're going to pay you to take DNA vaccines that actually change your body's DNA.
[00:15:18.655 --> 00:15:22.057]  They have a name for that, it's called cancer.
[00:15:22.057 --> 00:15:25.120]  So, Bill Gates, who openly says he wants to reduce population,
[00:15:26.368 --> 00:15:51.725]  is coming with that virus they transferred to China that they allowed to be released against us with total surveillance drones flying around controlling everybody it's incredible but the big news the gigantor incredible news call everyone you know don't tune in we're gonna cover on the other side of this quick break this is so important wait till we cover this it is earth-shaking
[00:15:59.438 --> 00:16:00.299]  Maybe not today.
[00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:02.000]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.723]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[00:16:05.723 --> 00:16:06.824]  Forget bunkers.
[00:16:06.824 --> 00:16:08.646]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:16:08.646 --> 00:16:10.347]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[00:17:30.418 --> 00:17:33.640]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.

[00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:38.083]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[00:17:41.826 --> 00:17:43.387]  NASA PAC technology.
[00:17:43.387 --> 00:17:44.008]  Bacon.
[00:17:44.008 --> 00:17:48.171]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon.
[00:17:48.171 --> 00:17:49.612]  Or warm and serve.

[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:05.563]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars can now offer high-quality, storable food again.
[00:18:05.563 --> 00:18:11.106]  Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago, and they told people they had food.
[00:18:11.106 --> 00:18:12.907]  Most folks never were delivered their food.
[00:18:12.907 --> 00:18:22.593]  Well, when our sponsors' food began to run short, they just suspended sales until they opened more factories and secured more food.
[00:18:22.593 --> 00:18:24.314]  So to get your orders in right now,
[00:18:24.694 --> 00:18:27.838]  They can take new orders and get it to you quickly.
[00:18:27.838 --> 00:18:40.975]  They'll probably have to suspend orders very, very soon again because the lockdown on the economy is killing food distribution, farming, you name it, and now it's mainstream news that food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen.
[00:18:41.716 --> 00:18:48.420]  If Trump can turn the economy back on and wrest control of our system away from the globalists, things may be okay.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.661]  But it looks like it's going to get very, very rough.
[00:18:50.661 --> 00:18:57.425]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number one thing you need, high-quality, storable food, ready to get to you and your family now.
[00:18:57.425 --> 00:18:59.166]  If you get your orders in at 4store.com.
[00:19:00.177 --> 00:19:05.159]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[00:19:05.159 --> 00:19:13.043]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[00:19:13.043 --> 00:19:19.366]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:20.106]  TurboForce.

[00:20:03.252 --> 00:20:05.874]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:31.723]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.723 --> 00:20:37.307]  And we're committing a thought crime here according to Google, Facebook, Twitter, the United Nations, CNN.
[00:20:37.307 --> 00:20:41.270]  They're all over the news saying, questioning the deaths, questioning the numbers.
[00:20:42.634 --> 00:20:45.235]  A sang zinc is good for you and antiviral.
[00:20:45.235 --> 00:20:46.356]  None of it is allowed.
[00:20:46.356 --> 00:20:54.741]  Facebook's working with state governments to try to ban anybody and block any protest who are demanding reopen America.
[00:20:54.741 --> 00:20:59.623]  You don't go out and protest and demonstrate and say that you're an American.
[00:20:59.623 --> 00:21:01.764]  You don't go out and exercise your right of assembly.
[00:21:01.764 --> 00:21:04.686]  You stay in your house.
[00:21:04.686 --> 00:21:06.207]  Like this is Communist China.
[00:21:07.543 --> 00:21:14.487]  Now the most viral video out there that I've seen in a long time happened yesterday before a White House press briefing.
[00:21:14.487 --> 00:21:24.153]  John Roberts, very popular host and talk show host and reporter for Fox News for over a decade.
[00:21:24.153 --> 00:21:33.999]  He walks in an hour before the press conference starts and he sees everybody fear-mongering, wearing masks, getting into the Kabuki theater, getting into the fear, getting into the dog training.
[00:21:33.999 --> 00:21:36.901]  He witnesses this and he says,
[00:21:39.955 --> 00:21:44.339]  It's zero, it's .01 percent.
[00:21:44.339 --> 00:21:53.348]  There's 400 plus thousand people in LA County, the health department's reporting, and there's only 600 and something dead.
[00:21:53.348 --> 00:21:57.332]  And I looked up the numbers today, 663 that may have died from coronavirus, they had a
[00:22:01.985 --> 00:22:07.670]  A positive test for coronavirus, so they may have died from it.
[00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:18.477]  663 people, out of their estimates from what they've been testing now, 400,000 or more have had it.
[00:22:18.477 --> 00:22:19.098]  663.
[00:22:19.098 --> 00:22:23.041]  Now if you go to the calculator.net, when you put 663 into 400,000,
[00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:31.167]  You get 663 divided 400,000 equals.
[00:22:31.167 --> 00:22:32.949]  And then there's the number right there.
[00:22:32.949 --> 00:22:34.870]  0.0016575 equals zero point.
[00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:35.850]  There's your final number.
[00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:35.910]  0.16575.
[00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:35.950]  So.
[00:22:52.861 --> 00:22:56.845]  You do your own math with that, but that is not even close to 1%.
[00:22:56.845 --> 00:22:56.865]  .16.
[00:22:56.865 --> 00:22:56.905]  .16.
[00:22:56.905 --> 00:23:01.430]  So that's 16% of 1% death rate.
[00:23:18.359 --> 00:23:21.080]  And you can have a lot of fun with that math.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.722]  And there's all these people that don't want you to look at these numbers.
[00:23:23.722 --> 00:23:34.548]  But let's say, as they continue to test, that we find out that number even goes down.
[00:23:34.548 --> 00:23:37.209]  Or maybe some of the people that test positive later die.
[00:23:37.209 --> 00:23:38.190]  Maybe it goes up.
[00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.191]  Maybe it goes up to 0.2%, maybe 0.3%.
[00:23:40.191 --> 00:23:41.852]  That's still below the flu for old people.
[00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:56.529]  Because when you enter that into the number, that it's almost universal that it's people with pre-existing conditions or who are super old above 85 years of age.
[00:23:56.529 --> 00:24:00.251]  It's the same all over the world.
[00:24:00.251 --> 00:24:04.593]  Now the virus is attacking men's testicles, and of course that's the real design of it.
[00:24:04.593 --> 00:24:05.673]  It is a chimera.
[00:24:05.673 --> 00:24:06.614]  It is a bio-weapon.
[00:24:07.864 --> 00:24:15.911]  So Bill and Melinda Gates can own the vaccine and own the response to it because you can't have a vaccine for a regular cold virus because there's thousands of new ones a year.
[00:24:15.911 --> 00:24:20.795]  So you got to have something that's novel so you can claim you've got a treatment for it, even though that's a fraud.
[00:24:20.795 --> 00:24:26.560]  And that answer is why they released the bioweapon.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.943]  So let's walk through it.
[00:24:29.943 --> 00:24:31.745]  And let's talk about how huge this is.
[00:24:33.126 --> 00:24:39.353]  The UN itself says an extra 30 million people are starving to death on top of the 10 million that die every year.
[00:24:39.353 --> 00:24:50.565]  So they're talking about, in official press releases from the World Food Program, 30 million people dying instead of 10 million people dying.
[00:24:52.162 --> 00:24:54.003]  And there's millions dying right now.
[00:24:54.003 --> 00:24:55.343]  But see, they're not human.
[00:24:55.343 --> 00:24:59.625]  They're not cool wearing masks and all chic.
[00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:02.526]  Because they're really not essential to the new world order.
[00:25:02.526 --> 00:25:12.130]  And so everyone's being herded and prepared for microchips, for drone surveillance, for total control, for world IDs, for medical IDs, for medical passports.
[00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:13.291]  It's all being announced.
[00:25:13.291 --> 00:25:14.131]  There's no debating it.
[00:25:16.069 --> 00:25:22.689]  The robot suppression system, Chinese-made drones and face scanning now being used in California and New York and other blue states.
[00:25:25.612 --> 00:25:32.575]  This is their globalist revolution to cut the carbon, to kill the industrial state, to make you poor and to make you austere.
[00:25:32.575 --> 00:25:34.716]  This is their admitted plan and they're all over the news.
[00:25:34.716 --> 00:25:37.437]  The Pope says, we are dying because we're evil.
[00:25:37.437 --> 00:25:38.738]  We deserve this.
[00:25:38.738 --> 00:25:40.378]  Capitalism is wasteful.
[00:25:40.378 --> 00:25:41.879]  The earth is doing this.
[00:25:41.879 --> 00:25:53.264]  You're hearing the whole UN, Gaia, world government speech that we deserve this from the Hollywood trash and everybody else that are the same ones saying, shut everything down to save lives.
[00:25:57.369 --> 00:26:05.713]  But they are the ones that are always telling us they want to get rid of the population and kill the old people.
[00:26:05.713 --> 00:26:10.756]  So this is an incredible moment to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:10.756 --> 00:26:11.836]  And here's what's going to happen.
[00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:18.719]  As they test more people, you're going to see that death rate go down, which we predicted months ago, and it's now happened.
[00:26:18.719 --> 00:26:23.442]  And we're going to find out that people are having an autoimmune response to the virus.
[00:26:24.676 --> 00:26:24.976]  I don't know.
[00:26:39.534 --> 00:26:43.296]  The same thing you give somebody when they get stung by a bee.
[00:26:43.296 --> 00:26:46.197]  An EpiPen or prescription Benadryl.
[00:26:46.197 --> 00:26:47.117]  And it works like a charm.
[00:26:47.117 --> 00:26:49.718]  But see, the hospitals are saying, oh no, don't do that.
[00:26:49.718 --> 00:26:50.899]  That's not the treatment.
[00:26:50.899 --> 00:26:52.139]  It has to be U.N.
[00:26:52.139 --> 00:26:52.800]  approved.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.560]  The U.N.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:59.062]  has to tell our doctors and our president, our country, how to live and what to do.
[00:26:59.062 --> 00:26:59.963]  So let's go out to break.
[00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:01.934]  We're good to go.
[00:27:21.257 --> 00:27:26.459]  Case fatality rates are 0.1 to 0.3 according to USC.
[00:27:26.459 --> 00:27:26.939]  Really?
[00:27:26.939 --> 00:27:28.019]  That's reassuring.
[00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:30.600]  Everybody here has been vaccinated anyway.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.341]  USC and L.A.
[00:27:31.341 --> 00:27:34.082]  County Public Health came out with a study.
[00:27:34.082 --> 00:27:44.865]  They found that there are 7,000 cases in California, but they really believe that there are anywhere from 221,000 to 442,000 people who were infected.
[00:27:44.865 --> 00:27:46.406]  Really?
[00:27:46.406 --> 00:27:46.566]  Yeah.
[00:27:46.566 --> 00:27:47.626]  So that makes it 0.1 to 0.3?
[00:27:50.603 --> 00:27:52.284]  All right, folks!
[00:28:17.958 --> 00:28:18.960]  So there you go.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.921]  That's what's going on.
[00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:22.004]  Of course, the internet comes out and says that's fake.
[00:28:22.004 --> 00:28:23.026]  No, that's real.
[00:28:23.026 --> 00:28:24.608]  John Roberts has confirmed it.
[00:28:24.608 --> 00:28:25.629]  That was a live feed.
[00:28:25.629 --> 00:28:29.134]  It was picked up and saw by hundreds of thousands already tuned in.
[00:28:29.134 --> 00:28:31.197]  And historic moment, Fox News admits.
[00:28:32.912 --> 00:28:34.473]  COVID-19 is a giant hoax.
[00:28:34.473 --> 00:28:36.234]  The video is at man.video.
[00:28:36.234 --> 00:28:44.059]  Share it, ladies and gentlemen, because then we explain how it's a hoax, why it's a hoax, what they're trying to do, and how you can counter it.
[00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:46.500]  We have cracked the code at man.video.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.461]  Get it out.
[00:28:47.461 --> 00:28:51.824]  If you don't want to have a total depression, forced inoculation, you've got to move!
[00:28:51.824 --> 00:28:53.585]  You've got to take action!
[00:28:53.585 --> 00:28:55.506]  Come with me if you want to live.
[00:28:55.506 --> 00:28:57.007]  Seriously, folks, this is real.
[00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:05.014]  House flies defecate every four to five minutes, spreading diseases and germs.

[00:30:16.295 --> 00:30:17.675]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!

[00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:48.424]  888-253-3139 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 That's InfoWarsStore.com
[00:31:00.507 --> 00:31:02.329]  How do you put a people under house arrest?
[00:31:02.329 --> 00:31:04.331]  How do you put them under siege?
[00:31:04.331 --> 00:31:18.065]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist Deep State and then had China release to then take down the populist president and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[00:31:18.866 --> 00:31:20.207]  Bill Maher even admitted it.
[00:31:20.207 --> 00:31:22.069]  Man, I hope we have a depression.
[00:31:22.069 --> 00:31:37.401]  And now they've tailored the whole thing with the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed along with the help of the blue states and blue states all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[00:31:37.401 --> 00:31:40.424]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us.
[00:31:40.424 --> 00:31:43.786]  But as for me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it.
[00:31:43.786 --> 00:31:47.910]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody safe.
[00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.291]  But that's not what they're doing.
[00:31:50.291 --> 00:32:00.097]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole world, and committing millions of third-world people to death.
[00:32:00.097 --> 00:32:02.459]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[00:32:02.459 --> 00:32:08.422]  They're amazing, they're cutting-edge, you love them, I love them, and they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[00:32:08.422 --> 00:32:12.365]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development
[00:32:13.533 --> 00:32:15.174]  That is amazing.
[00:32:15.174 --> 00:32:22.839]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:25.161]  And there's another innovation.
[00:32:25.161 --> 00:32:27.262]  It's the spray cap.
[00:32:27.262 --> 00:32:32.666]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[00:32:32.666 --> 00:32:34.847]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[00:32:34.847 --> 00:32:35.748]  I like to put it on my hands.
[00:32:36.508 --> 00:32:38.009]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[00:32:38.009 --> 00:32:40.811]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes.
[00:32:40.811 --> 00:32:45.213]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[00:32:45.213 --> 00:32:47.014]  So, this is a real innovation.
[00:32:47.014 --> 00:32:53.398]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[00:32:53.398 --> 00:32:54.899]  It smells great.
[00:32:54.899 --> 00:32:56.720]  It's so refreshing.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:03.263]  This is a big winner.
[00:33:03.263 --> 00:33:05.885]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.968 --> 00:33:23.874]  I mean, there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:33:23.874 --> 00:33:25.915]  Alex Jones!
[00:33:25.915 --> 00:33:39.204]  The far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[00:33:39.204 --> 00:33:40.325]  Scum!
[00:33:40.325 --> 00:33:41.466]  Russian scum!
[00:33:50.332 --> 00:33:52.135]  Reputation's amazing.
[00:33:52.135 --> 00:33:53.597]  I will not let you down.
[00:33:53.597 --> 00:33:56.481]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:34:00.011 --> 00:34:04.052]  Can you imagine what would be happening if Hillary Clinton was president today?
[00:34:04.052 --> 00:34:15.856]  They would be carrying out this exact same plan, except it'd be ten times worse because you wouldn't have Trump in there trying to block it, trying to reason with the American people to not be hysterical and to not give in to the fear.
[00:34:15.856 --> 00:34:17.596]  But they didn't do that.
[00:34:17.596 --> 00:34:22.778]  So the president then had to ride the wave or he would have been destroyed, and that was the trap that was set.
[00:34:22.778 --> 00:34:26.699]  But the next part of the trap is destroy the economy, which they've basically already done.
[00:34:28.117 --> 00:34:32.581]  Crude oil's never been at zero, and now it's negative.
[00:34:32.581 --> 00:34:37.525]  And sweet crude and processed crude is on its way down to zero.
[00:34:37.525 --> 00:34:42.509]  That's called cardiac arrest in the economy.
[00:34:42.509 --> 00:34:49.714]  And it's irrevocable if it's not turned around in weeks, and a lot of estimates are it can't be done now.
[00:34:49.714 --> 00:34:54.658]  So, this is the globalist plan for total dependency.
[00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:57.481]  Now the good news is here, most people won't starve to death in the U.S.
[00:34:58.786 --> 00:35:01.308]  But in the third world, it is a death sentence.
[00:35:01.308 --> 00:35:04.429]  And my family has said they've never seen me this upset.
[00:35:04.429 --> 00:35:06.591]  The crew's never seen me this upset.
[00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:08.732]  I'm not a bleeding heart.
[00:35:08.732 --> 00:35:10.653]  Meaning, I'm a tough guy.
[00:35:10.653 --> 00:35:14.255]  I physically am ill.
[00:35:14.255 --> 00:35:16.757]  Over the tens of millions starving to death right now.
[00:35:16.757 --> 00:35:20.919]  Because metaphysically, I know I'm next and my family's next.
[00:35:20.919 --> 00:35:24.642]  And God is pissed at me for not doing more and not being stronger.
[00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:31.274]  And I'm normally in good stead with the big guy, and God is really pissed at me right now.
[00:35:31.274 --> 00:35:43.044]  And I have been praying a lot, and I've been understanding what has to happen, and God is literally telling me, Jones, you better start civil disobedience, and you better do it now.
[00:35:43.044 --> 00:35:46.787]  And I was told a month ago, you go out and demonstrate, we're gonna take your kids.
[00:35:46.787 --> 00:35:50.350]  Well, I went out and I did it, and it's been national news, and they're trying to take them right now.
[00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:52.232]  But by the grace of God, it hadn't happened.
[00:35:52.657 --> 00:35:56.159]  But it doesn't matter, they're going to take my kids anyways into the new world order if I don't do this.
[00:35:56.159 --> 00:35:59.802]  And I'm not up here shooting my mouth off like I'm a tough guy.
[00:35:59.802 --> 00:36:04.806]  They're killing 30 million people right now!
[00:36:04.806 --> 00:36:13.111]  I said 2 million a few weeks ago, the numbers I had now it's 30 million dying!
[00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:17.735]  It's not a bleeding heart that I'm virtue signaling, I am not even getting chills right now.
[00:36:17.735 --> 00:36:19.336]  I have been getting on fire.
[00:36:21.378 --> 00:36:24.220]  And men, especially, know what it feels like when you feel like you're on fire.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:30.703]  I used to only feel like that when I was fighting for my life.
[00:36:30.703 --> 00:36:33.184]  Opening huge cans of kick-ass.
[00:36:33.184 --> 00:36:35.226]  And that's not good, folks.
[00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:46.211]  That's savage, caveman instincts turning on because my intellect and my soul is, danger, Will Robinson.
[00:36:46.211 --> 00:36:47.212]  Notice, just suddenly.
[00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:49.260]  It's flash.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.701]  Even Joel Skousen thought they'd have World War III first before this.
[00:36:51.701 --> 00:36:53.763]  And he's like, no, he was wrong.
[00:36:53.763 --> 00:36:56.105]  Because they just suddenly did that move, man.
[00:36:56.105 --> 00:37:01.128]  They always said, we're launching the new world order in 2020.
[00:37:01.128 --> 00:37:03.690]  David Rockefeller said it in the 70s.
[00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.031]  Stroke Talbot said it in the 90s.
[00:37:05.031 --> 00:37:06.192]  They always said 2020, 2020.
[00:37:06.192 --> 00:37:13.678]  We will have a new world order by 2020, but we'll pay for it in blood and money.
[00:37:13.678 --> 00:37:17.701]  That's Senate testimony!
[00:37:22.307 --> 00:37:26.891]  In the 80s.
[00:37:26.891 --> 00:37:31.334]  Oh, and let me just tell you something.
[00:37:31.334 --> 00:37:36.058]  The globalists admit that they put garbage in to create garbage out.
[00:37:36.058 --> 00:37:46.706]  So they try to dumb things down like, well wait a minute, the virus is man-made and a bio-weapon, but you're saying it's a hoax that it's not that deadly.
[00:37:46.706 --> 00:37:49.108]  But then you're saying it's mutating and it targets the testicles.
[00:37:51.198 --> 00:37:53.120]  Next segment I'll lay that out.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.864]  This virus is super bad.
[00:37:56.864 --> 00:37:59.026]  But not in the ways we've been told.
[00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:01.829]  And I foresaw this 10-11 weeks ago and it's all come out.
[00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:05.072]  Because I already knew about their weapons programs, the type of stuff they do.
[00:38:05.072 --> 00:38:06.574]  They don't like hard kills.
[00:38:09.295 --> 00:38:13.197]  They like soft kills, but they have their lower level folks are in on it.
[00:38:13.197 --> 00:38:16.279]  They go, oh, we're just going to kill the really old that are weighing down the system.
[00:38:16.279 --> 00:38:19.260]  It's the death panel and people that are already really, really sick.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.062]  And so it does have that level in its first attack.
[00:38:23.062 --> 00:38:25.544]  But then it sits in the body and does a bunch of other stuff.
[00:38:25.544 --> 00:38:31.927]  And so they don't want you to know that a vaccine in all the studies will lower your immunity to the mutations of it.
[00:38:31.927 --> 00:38:35.749]  And they don't want you to know that it's nutrition and sunlight and water and getting healthy.
[00:38:35.749 --> 00:38:37.550]  That is basically a total defense.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:57.763]  Every level they're trying to block people having an understanding and it's just the sinisterness of it and every angle pre-programmed and war game in all these different globalist disease X drills and lockstep drills and event 201 drills and
[00:38:59.645 --> 00:39:15.596]  The smirking and the laughing and the giggling on TED TV when he says the equation, we got to get humans to zero to save the earth, and the crowd laughs because they're in on it.
[00:39:15.596 --> 00:39:27.465]  By 1966, at places like University of Texas, they were openly taking the top students in the country and teaching them about the eugenics world government takeover.
[00:39:31.718 --> 00:39:34.880]  This is a cult of mad scientists.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.002]  They're taking over.
[00:39:37.002 --> 00:39:40.184]  They think you're a useful eater.
[00:39:40.184 --> 00:39:45.567]  Bill Joy wrote about it in 1999 in Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, Wired Magazine.
[00:39:45.567 --> 00:39:47.248]  How he went to the meeting with the top billionaires.
[00:39:47.248 --> 00:39:52.552]  They made the decision to entertain you, dumb you down, stun you, and then kill you.
[00:39:52.552 --> 00:39:54.193]  Theodore Kaczynski was in the CIA.
[00:39:54.193 --> 00:39:55.694]  He was briefed on all this.
[00:39:55.694 --> 00:39:56.615]  He thought it was horrible.
[00:39:56.615 --> 00:40:00.577]  He started bombing people he knew were involved in it.
[00:40:00.577 --> 00:40:01.598]  He's in a supermax prison.
[00:40:08.382 --> 00:40:13.443]  All right, I'm gonna go to break, and as I said, I'll come back and get into this.
[00:40:13.443 --> 00:40:14.723]  So it's a paradox.
[00:40:14.723 --> 00:40:19.464]  You need to boost your immune system and your body's defenses all the time.
[00:40:19.464 --> 00:40:24.766]  And yes, I sell and promote things that keep us on air that I know are good, that you like, that are good for your family.
[00:40:24.766 --> 00:40:30.787]  If you don't get storable foods, and if you don't get a backup plan while you still can, you are insane.
[00:40:32.915 --> 00:40:39.458]  And you got the money to go to the grocery store while you can and stock up and fill up your pantry and fill up your garage with stuff that saves more power to you.
[00:40:39.458 --> 00:40:43.359]  But that stuff's four or five times more expensive than the high-quality, storable food that we have.
[00:40:43.359 --> 00:40:45.480]  It's now back in stock again.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.282]  And I just ordered more food yesterday.
[00:40:49.282 --> 00:40:51.903]  Because I gotta take care of family.
[00:40:51.903 --> 00:40:54.364]  And I remember telling family, hey, you better get more than a couple months.
[00:40:54.364 --> 00:40:56.485]  They're like, oh, Alex, it'll be back in two weeks.
[00:40:56.485 --> 00:40:57.705]  I said, BS.
[00:40:57.705 --> 00:40:59.066]  It's never turning back on.
[00:40:59.066 --> 00:41:01.187]  My own family won't listen to me, even though they're smart.
[00:41:02.424 --> 00:41:03.645]  And so, yeah, it's symbiotic.
[00:41:03.645 --> 00:41:07.027]  This fund's our operation.
[00:41:07.027 --> 00:41:08.928]  This suicide mission I'm on.
[00:41:08.928 --> 00:41:10.229]  But we're all on a suicide mission.
[00:41:10.229 --> 00:41:11.069]  We don't turn this around.
[00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:12.750]  So I feel good doing this.
[00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:16.172]  But I'm just telling you, from the bottom of my heart, you need affordable food.
[00:41:16.172 --> 00:41:17.032]  We've got the best.
[00:41:17.032 --> 00:41:17.653]  They've got it.
[00:41:17.653 --> 00:41:18.593]  They're packaging it.
[00:41:18.593 --> 00:41:20.054]  They're getting it out to people.
[00:41:20.054 --> 00:41:24.897]  And I'm ashamed that most of the other companies, I say most because there might be some that are legitimate, we haven't found them.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:30.045]  Because I got worried that our supplier would run out, so I called around, ordered a bunch of stuff.
[00:41:30.045 --> 00:41:32.028]  None of it ever came in.
[00:41:32.028 --> 00:41:34.451]  None of it.
[00:41:34.451 --> 00:41:37.135]  Ten weeks later, none of it came in.
[00:41:37.135 --> 00:41:39.298]  Stuff I ordered came in.
[00:41:39.298 --> 00:41:40.419]  Two weeks before they said it would.
[00:41:43.137 --> 00:41:43.997]  Get your orders in.
[00:41:43.997 --> 00:41:46.158]  The number they told me is four weeks on average, whatever they said.
[00:41:46.158 --> 00:41:46.939]  Don't say that, Jones.
[00:41:46.939 --> 00:41:47.619]  Say six.
[00:41:47.619 --> 00:41:49.500]  Because we don't want any chargebacks.
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.581]  Okay, six weeks.
[00:41:50.581 --> 00:41:51.301]  Get your orders in.
[00:41:51.301 --> 00:41:52.301]  But here's the thing.
[00:41:52.301 --> 00:41:54.242]  The orders are flooding in right now.
[00:41:54.242 --> 00:41:56.023]  They may pause orders again.
[00:41:56.023 --> 00:42:00.405]  So you better get your orders in at infowarestore.com from the great folks at MyPatriot.
[00:42:00.405 --> 00:42:01.386]  They're in our back end.
[00:42:01.386 --> 00:42:02.726]  People make jokes about that.
[00:42:02.726 --> 00:42:03.707]  Ha ha ha.
[00:42:03.707 --> 00:42:04.607]  They're in our computers.
[00:42:04.607 --> 00:42:05.108]  They run it.
[00:42:05.108 --> 00:42:06.108]  They take the orders.
[00:42:06.108 --> 00:42:08.129]  We've been partnered with them for many years.
[00:42:08.129 --> 00:42:09.350]  They make the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:11.691]  Water filtration systems, all of it.
[00:42:11.691 --> 00:42:13.271]  They're awesome folks.
[00:42:13.271 --> 00:42:14.992]  And it's their mission to prepare people.
[00:42:14.992 --> 00:42:16.052]  And they just do a great job.
[00:42:16.052 --> 00:42:24.796]  And they sell the food, the filters, everything for half of what competitors do, because it is literally a mission of Matt Redhawk from God.
[00:42:24.796 --> 00:42:26.736]  And you hear a lot of these fake preachers and stuff saying that.
[00:42:26.736 --> 00:42:29.077]  With these guys, it really is a mission.
[00:42:29.077 --> 00:42:30.058]  They've done so much for us.
[00:42:30.058 --> 00:42:30.938]  We really appreciate them.
[00:42:30.938 --> 00:42:33.379]  And they're just a godsend.
[00:42:33.379 --> 00:42:37.640]  Through all this evil, though, you see the hand of God in Providence, though, working in so many ways.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.641]  I'm just very, very humbled.
[00:42:39.601 --> 00:42:42.343]  But we have to just call out to Jesus.
[00:42:42.343 --> 00:42:44.024]  That's really the answer here.
[00:42:44.024 --> 00:42:45.865]  And this is a spiritual fight.
[00:42:45.865 --> 00:42:48.866]  And I can't and you can't expect to beat this on your own.
[00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:51.788]  But you have to do it and testify against the New World Order.
[00:42:51.788 --> 00:42:53.789]  And I've got some other stuff to cover as well.
[00:42:53.789 --> 00:42:59.873]  The fake Christians mad at me about the Mark of the Beast because they're scared.
[00:42:59.873 --> 00:43:03.975]  When one studies history and human nature, you learn very quickly that
[00:43:05.561 --> 00:43:27.162]  Rugged individualism and people that think for themselves, build free societies, innovate, do amazing things, but those that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient, those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue, they create stagnation, corruption, tyranny, and then finally collapse.
[00:43:27.162 --> 00:43:29.765]  And the world is now being tested.
[00:43:30.834 --> 00:43:42.656]  And we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing if they just submit now in a bigger way, somehow they'll create a heavenly future.
[00:43:42.656 --> 00:43:52.958]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic and are building an anti-human future.
[00:43:52.958 --> 00:43:58.039]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[00:43:59.719 --> 00:44:04.602]  Cobra is now in command of you and your family.
[00:44:04.602 --> 00:44:20.109]  Google and Facebook, as well as Apple, work closely with our organization, the Hiss Corps, to surveil your every movement with robot drones and other systems to ensure the safety of the public.
[00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:33.856]  Of course it was I 12 years ago with Obama, who serves us well, and Fauci, who transferred the bioweapons to Communist China so we could now release the weapon.
[00:44:33.856 --> 00:44:47.083]  But without the loving liberal media scaring you into submission, and the corporate press, worshiping corporations that shut down all access, as well as blue city governors and mayors,
[00:44:47.543 --> 00:44:56.488]  We would never have been able to give you a depression that will destroy your future forever and starve the third world.
[00:44:56.488 --> 00:44:58.650]  Well done, American cowards!
[00:45:00.253 --> 00:45:05.658]  One of the best nutrients nature has provided, beetroot, has been used for hundreds of years in natural medicine.

[00:45:30.888 --> 00:45:34.549]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:41.632]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[00:45:41.632 --> 00:45:45.614]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy, and delicious drinking water.

[00:46:01.084 --> 00:46:06.851]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think, even if it ends up hurting me short term.
[00:46:06.851 --> 00:46:12.638]  I believe in God, and I believe in the long run, it'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[00:46:12.638 --> 00:46:14.781]  I understand what comes around and goes around.
[00:46:14.781 --> 00:46:16.783]  You reap what you sow, and I live that.
[00:46:16.783 --> 00:46:18.765]  And I fundamentally, at a cellular level, understand it.
[00:46:23.926 --> 00:46:27.489]  You know what?
[00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:29.351]  I didn't do that.
[00:46:29.351 --> 00:46:36.696]  But I said, on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient, people are deficient in iodine and so many other issues.
[00:46:36.696 --> 00:46:39.559]  You need those products regardless.
[00:46:39.559 --> 00:46:42.921]  So we started selling out of Vitamineral Fusion and all the other products.
[00:46:42.921 --> 00:46:48.506]  I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing.
[00:46:48.666 --> 00:46:51.008]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:32.267 --> 00:47:39.150]  There has never been a more important time for people to wake up and take action.
[00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:40.950]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:45.652]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday, April 22nd edition.
[00:47:45.652 --> 00:47:57.036]  I want to open the phones up, and I want to take a lot of calls for first-time callers in the next hour, and then we'll have a free-for-all after that.
[00:47:57.036 --> 00:48:00.938]  We have the head of GAAB that's really been standing up to censorship and doing a lot of amazing things.
[00:48:03.063 --> 00:48:10.265]  As well, one of the alternative places for people to communicate that isn't censored.
[00:48:10.265 --> 00:48:12.246]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[00:48:12.246 --> 00:48:12.966]  So that is coming up.
[00:48:12.966 --> 00:48:14.086]  All right, let me lay this out.
[00:48:14.086 --> 00:48:16.867]  And again, anybody that's tuned in in the last 11 weeks since this all kicked off knows
[00:48:32.574 --> 00:48:37.318]  That I have made a lot of predictions and engaged in a lot of analysis.
[00:48:37.318 --> 00:48:39.400]  And I said, you watch when they shut down for two weeks.
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.224]  They're then going to say, oh, it's just two months and then six months, and it's never going to stop.
[00:48:44.224 --> 00:48:46.606]  And they're programming you that you're not essential.
[00:48:46.606 --> 00:48:50.649]  Think about if aliens arrived and landed and said, you are not essential.
[00:48:50.649 --> 00:48:52.311]  We will decide who is essential.
[00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:58.852]  You would say this is an attack, that this is a demonization.
[00:48:58.852 --> 00:49:01.154]  This is beyond racism.
[00:49:01.154 --> 00:49:07.799]  This is even worse at saying, like the Nazis did, that you're useless eaters and must be gotten rid of.
[00:49:07.799 --> 00:49:13.903]  Because with robots and computers, they can make humans obsolete.
[00:49:13.903 --> 00:49:22.169]  And the globalists are teaching us now that we're obsolete and having a whole revolutionary rollout of medical tyranny, forced inoculations, and so much more.
[00:49:24.591 --> 00:49:29.634]  And so, now the Communist Chinese see that we're bucking it, we're trying to reopen.
[00:49:29.634 --> 00:49:37.918]  People are pointing out that, hey, they're counting all deaths that test positive for COVID-19 as having COVID and dying from COVID.
[00:49:37.918 --> 00:49:47.283]  And then it turns out that anybody that's got the cold, or anybody that ever had the cold, or anybody that had the flu are saying positive, and then it's a total fraud!
[00:49:47.283 --> 00:49:49.965]  Because they say they're testing for genetic material in the body.
[00:49:52.142 --> 00:50:05.412]  But you notice, as the test goes out, and as we test more than anybody in the world combined, but the media says, oh, we haven't done any testing, and that Trump's done a bad job, we go, wait a minute, L.A.
[00:50:05.412 --> 00:50:09.856]  County, with the percentages they've got now, project, that was yesterday, 400,000 people have it.
[00:50:09.856 --> 00:50:18.022]  Now they're saying it's more like 450,000, and it's gonna just go exponential, and it's killing zero,
[00:50:21.872 --> 00:50:29.575]  We'll put that back on screen.
[00:50:29.575 --> 00:50:30.076]  0.16.
[00:50:30.076 --> 00:50:31.136]  0.165749999.
[00:50:31.136 --> 00:50:33.577]  According to the health department's numbers.
[00:50:33.577 --> 00:50:40.520]  And again, almost all of those super sick, on dialysis, kidney failure, liver failure, cancer.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.701]  The average age, 86 years old.
[00:50:42.701 --> 00:50:48.364]  Just like what you saw in Italy.
[00:50:50.336 --> 00:50:55.319]  Super old population, three generations to a house.
[00:50:55.319 --> 00:50:59.782]  They lose up to 60 to 70,000 a year from the flu.
[00:50:59.782 --> 00:51:06.287]  By the way, I've got numbers here out of Michigan where the flus killed more people than this.
[00:51:06.287 --> 00:51:12.391]  So if you're a radio listener, this is from the health department of LA County.
[00:51:12.391 --> 00:51:16.314]  It's in the local newspapers linked up on Infowars.com.
[00:51:19.778 --> 00:51:24.939]  And you really need to go see this for yourself.
[00:51:24.939 --> 00:51:25.860]  Study shows L.A.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.620]  County coronavirus count upwards of 400,000.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.541]  That was, again, a few days ago.
[00:51:30.541 --> 00:51:31.861]  Now it's above that.
[00:51:31.861 --> 00:51:35.302]  Today, the number is 663 deaths.
[00:51:35.302 --> 00:51:40.143]  You add that together, it's incredible.
[00:51:40.143 --> 00:51:41.724]  Of course, they use this to scare everybody.
[00:51:41.724 --> 00:51:47.265]  At studyfinds.org, the headline was, oh my gosh, it's up 55 times higher than confirmed cases.
[00:51:48.712 --> 00:51:53.735]  But then you read, that means, oh, it's not killing very many people that get it.
[00:51:53.735 --> 00:51:55.016]  That was in StudyFinds.org.
[00:51:55.016 --> 00:51:59.339]  So, see how they're spinning this?
[00:51:59.339 --> 00:52:04.322]  And then there's another article here, out of the Detroit News.
[00:52:04.322 --> 00:52:08.745]  In Michigan, deaths were down in March, but it doesn't feel that way!
[00:52:08.745 --> 00:52:09.386]  No!
[00:52:09.386 --> 00:52:10.727]  No, it doesn't feel that way!
[00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:13.228]  We're all dead!
[00:52:13.228 --> 00:52:14.009]  Bill Gates, save me!
[00:52:15.421 --> 00:52:21.885]  Preliminary statistics from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services record 5,929 deaths in March of 2020.
[00:52:21.885 --> 00:52:24.647]  On average, the month of March has seen 8,542 deaths from flu.
[00:52:33.223 --> 00:52:38.266]  So more die in that month from flu, according to the health department there in Michigan.
[00:52:38.266 --> 00:52:39.687]  But see, that doesn't matter, does it?
[00:52:39.687 --> 00:52:43.249]  Because it's so much fun to get into being scared.
[00:52:43.249 --> 00:52:45.491]  It's so much fun with all the attention.
[00:52:45.491 --> 00:52:54.456]  And then the internet can't even believe the video of John Roberts that was on C-SPAN, that was on dozens of internet feeds.
[00:52:54.456 --> 00:52:56.798]  It was all over, and they've confirmed, no, that happened.
[00:52:57.577 --> 00:53:02.940]  He walks in, he's talking about a real study, real numbers out of L.A.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:08.264]  County, and the internet can't even believe it's real.
[00:53:08.264 --> 00:53:16.008]  Because you see, my aunt used to have a bumper sticker on her car that says, if you want your children to listen, whisper.
[00:53:16.008 --> 00:53:18.150]  And I remember seeing that when I had children.
[00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:21.552]  I noticed if I didn't want them to hear, they'd really pay attention.
[00:53:21.552 --> 00:53:23.033]  If I tried to talk right at them, they'll ignore you.
[00:53:24.298 --> 00:53:26.799]  So see, John Roberts walks in an hour before it starts.
[00:53:26.799 --> 00:53:27.919]  He's there early.
[00:53:27.919 --> 00:53:32.140]  He goes, hey, Bob, you know, this is ridiculous.
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:34.061]  Not even 1% are dying.
[00:53:34.061 --> 00:53:34.681]  Give it a break.
[00:53:34.681 --> 00:53:37.162]  My God, this is a hoax.
[00:53:37.162 --> 00:53:41.143]  And when everybody picks up on it, the guy goes, well, we're all vaccinated anyways.
[00:53:41.143 --> 00:53:43.104]  They go, oh, do they have a secret vaccine?
[00:53:43.104 --> 00:53:46.805]  No, no, the guy's just being smart ass.
[00:53:46.805 --> 00:53:49.205]  Because they've also told people, oh, he's had the flu shot.
[00:53:49.205 --> 00:53:50.346]  You're more protected.
[00:53:50.346 --> 00:53:50.966]  It's the opposite.
[00:53:52.659 --> 00:53:57.422]  And so that's just another ignoramus wearing his mask, shooting something back at John Roberts.
[00:53:57.422 --> 00:53:58.964]  And so the Internet obsesses on that.
[00:53:58.964 --> 00:54:06.549]  Oh, oh, secretly, you know, they've been given vaccines.
[00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:11.593]  And the media spins it that New York Times photographer jokes about coronavirus vaccine on Hot Mike.
[00:54:11.593 --> 00:54:12.133]  They spin it.
[00:54:12.133 --> 00:54:13.214]  It's not that.
[00:54:13.214 --> 00:54:17.057]  It's a real numbers out of the health department that they don't want you to discuss.
[00:54:17.057 --> 00:54:18.037]  They don't want you to talk about.
[00:54:18.037 --> 00:54:19.058]  We're going to play it again in a moment.
[00:54:19.058 --> 00:54:20.159]  But here's what you need to know.
[00:54:21.584 --> 00:54:25.986]  The Chi-Coms see everybody waking up and getting scared.
[00:54:25.986 --> 00:54:27.167]  That they've launched the attack.
[00:54:27.167 --> 00:54:32.329]  So now they're saying the United States did it.
[00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:35.231]  Americans are scared of the virus, they're scared of the fact that the economy's going down.
[00:54:36.078 --> 00:54:45.060]  So China starts showing the people with the chemical sprays again and all the fear and all the drones and locking people up and going, oh, there's at least 30 strains.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.880]  Some of them are deadlier than before.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:51.401]  Just like Scooby-Doo.
[00:54:51.401 --> 00:54:53.302]  The bad guys want to take the country over.
[00:54:53.302 --> 00:55:00.383]  They want to drive the stock market down to 5%, buy it all up, like Lord Rothschild did at the Battle of Waterloo in 12... in 1815.
[00:55:06.698 --> 00:55:10.160]  And Lord Wellington had really just beaten Napoleon for the second time.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.901]  It was the Battle of Waterloo.
[00:55:11.901 --> 00:55:16.023]  They sent carrier pigeons to the coast, had fast Corvette.
[00:55:16.023 --> 00:55:18.424]  Not by Chevy, that's named after a fast ship.
[00:55:18.424 --> 00:55:21.006]  Haul ass across the Channel.
[00:55:21.006 --> 00:55:25.768]  And they ran in right as the stock market opened in London and said, Wellington annihilated.
[00:55:25.768 --> 00:55:28.410]  And the stocks went to 1%.
[00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:33.933]  Lord Rothschild bought them all and became Supreme Ruler of the British Empire.
[00:55:35.083 --> 00:55:35.924]  That's the same thing.
[00:55:35.924 --> 00:55:38.849]  Driving it all down to nothing.
[00:55:38.849 --> 00:55:40.111]  Crude down to nothing.
[00:55:40.111 --> 00:55:41.253]  All the oil down to nothing.
[00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:46.892]  Surveillance, control, domination, and then they've patented the virus.
[00:55:46.892 --> 00:55:47.813]  They've already got it.
[00:55:47.813 --> 00:55:54.256]  Bill and Melinda Gates admit they have all these Chimera coronaviruses patented, ready to be put in the vaccine.
[00:55:54.256 --> 00:56:06.782]  But you've got to beg and plead first, and learn how to be locked down, and learn how to wear a mask, and learn how to be in a depression, and beg them for your World ID, and beg them for your immunity passport, and get all the other scared people demanding we get in line.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:09.681]  Or it's all over.
[00:56:09.681 --> 00:56:13.743]  And yeah, drones flying over to detect your breathing.
[00:56:13.743 --> 00:56:18.146]  And if they think you might have a breathing problem, the drone calls the police and you're arrested.
[00:56:18.146 --> 00:56:19.127]  Robot controllers.
[00:56:19.926 --> 00:56:25.029]  You flip a switch and suddenly we're all inside the system.
[00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:26.129]  877-789-2539.
[00:56:26.129 --> 00:56:33.573]  I got a lot of news, a lot of clips, a lot of insanity coming up that's so critical in the second hour.
[00:56:33.573 --> 00:56:35.394]  Please don't just be spectators.
[00:56:35.394 --> 00:56:38.035]  Be the Paul Reveres that you are.
[00:56:38.035 --> 00:56:43.178]  Male, female, old, young, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, gay, straight, Christian, agnostic.
[00:56:43.178 --> 00:56:49.161]  If you don't want to be a slave, now's the time to get active and to go to Band.Video and share that video.
[00:56:50.461 --> 00:56:56.566]  Historic moment, Fox News admits COVID-19 is a giant hoax and there it all is, hiding right there.
[00:56:56.566 --> 00:56:58.648]  And it's the statistics!
[00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:04.633]  But people don't care about the number to see the authority figure behind the scenes going, this is a giant scam.
[00:57:04.633 --> 00:57:09.197]  And you can see Roberts is pissed to see everybody acting like a bunch of scared little goons.
[00:57:09.197 --> 00:57:10.158]  Because he knows what's coming.
[00:57:11.929 --> 00:57:16.453]  Everybody in North Korea bowing to Kim Jong-un, who, by the way, has had heart surgery and hasn't been seen in weeks.
[00:57:16.453 --> 00:57:18.135]  Might be dead for all we know.
[00:57:18.135 --> 00:57:19.036]  All hell's breaking loose.
[00:57:19.036 --> 00:57:24.661]  We're going to start the second hour, but tell everybody about that local AM or FM station or TV station right now and keep doing it.
[00:57:24.661 --> 00:57:30.967]  And send out the links at infowars.com forward slash show to the live feed right now.
[00:57:30.967 --> 00:57:36.312]  And tell folks, it turns out that COVID-19 is a giant hoax, but
[00:57:37.355 --> 00:57:39.336]  If we don't get the word out, we're all doomed!
[00:57:39.336 --> 00:57:40.417]  Pay it forward!
[00:57:40.417 --> 00:57:41.097]  Warn others!
[00:57:41.097 --> 00:57:42.178]  Chain reaction!
[00:57:42.178 --> 00:57:44.499]  That can override the globalists before it's too late!
[00:57:44.499 --> 00:57:46.560]  But this could not be more critical!
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.781]  Act now!
[00:57:47.781 --> 00:57:49.362]  Act now!
[00:57:49.362 --> 00:57:54.205]  Ten weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high-quality, affordable food.
[00:57:54.205 --> 00:58:05.392]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown it would cause, because the globalists were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states.
[00:58:06.152 --> 00:58:10.575]  Now that prediction has come true, because the globalists are running an operation.
[00:58:10.575 --> 00:58:12.536]  It's not predictions.
[00:58:12.536 --> 00:58:14.817]  We have their battle plans.
[00:58:14.817 --> 00:58:23.082]  So, going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storable food companies were sold out, except My Patriot Supply, because they're the biggest and we're pre-positioned.
[00:58:23.082 --> 00:58:31.107]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner, they stopped taking orders until they got caught back up.
[00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:31.267]  Well,
[00:58:31.827 --> 00:58:39.092]  In a constant search to upgrade your favorite formulas, we brought you a new way to get your B12 with the most effective and expensive form available.

[00:59:53.658 --> 00:59:59.301]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:59.301 --> 01:00:01.043]  What is the endgame?
[01:00:01.043 --> 01:00:01.983]  What is the endgame?
[01:00:07.935 --> 01:00:10.898]  The endgame has been initiated.
[01:00:10.898 --> 01:00:14.401]  I intend to start taking your phone calls when we come back in the next segment.
[01:00:14.401 --> 01:00:16.983]  I'm going to hit some of the top stories as well.
[01:00:16.983 --> 01:00:20.706]  Then Rob Dew has put together an extremely powerful presentation.
[01:00:20.706 --> 01:00:24.549]  We're going to premiere in the last segment of this hour.
[01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:25.430]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:28.192]  And we'll continue with calls into the next hour.
[01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:31.395]  Andrew Torba of Gab is going to be popping in for a couple segments.
[01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:35.539]  And then we will continue in to the fourth hour with your phone calls here today.
[01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:40.736]  The endgame has been initiated.
[01:00:40.736 --> 01:00:42.237]  This is a special report.
[01:00:42.237 --> 01:00:48.680]  It's an audio report for radio listeners, a TV report for, obviously, folks viewing us.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:52.522]  But we will post this to Band.Video and to InfoWars.com in the next few minutes.
[01:00:52.522 --> 01:00:53.322]  Here it is.
[01:00:53.322 --> 01:00:54.603]  The endgame has been initiated.
[01:00:55.609 --> 01:01:05.616]  For more than two decades, I have analyzed the architecture of the globalist system, who runs it, how it operates, what its goals are, what makes it tick.
[01:01:05.616 --> 01:01:19.205]  And so we knew that the heart of it was a worldwide medical dictatorship, because that's true power over populations, is who can have children, what type of drugs and medicines you can take, what type of inoculations you're forced to take.
[01:01:20.475 --> 01:01:30.104]  Authoritarians over the last 200 years really began to notice that armies invading or taking over get resisted.
[01:01:30.104 --> 01:01:44.598]  But if you can do it through the cover of medical necessity, and if you can pose as the guardian of civilization and society, then you can really stampede people into doing whatever you want.
[01:01:45.479 --> 01:01:57.947]  And again, for 26 years studying the whole globalist system, Bill Gates and the big foundations he represents have been at the heart of this entire dehumanization operation.
[01:01:57.947 --> 01:02:11.116]  And so it's with a very heavy heart that I realized that I just have to trust in God and turn it over to God at this point, because the last two months with the lockdown and them rolling out the plan exactly as we predicted they would,
[01:02:11.736 --> 01:02:15.780]  Confirms to me that they're going to execute the next phases of their plan.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:19.363]  So they're coming with forced inoculations next year.
[01:02:19.363 --> 01:02:24.208]  They're coming to not let you travel or have a job or live.
[01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:30.773]  Unless you don't just submit the COVID-19 vaccine and the Trojan horse nanotech they admit they're going to put in it.
[01:02:31.894 --> 01:02:48.260]  But they're also coming with all these other so-called vaccines that actually go in and attack different parts of the brain and actually destroy parts of the brain associated with spiritual connections and deep emotions and higher levels of brainwaves.
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:51.522]  They call these anti-stress vaccines, anti-drug vaccines.
[01:02:51.522 --> 01:02:53.302]  They've had it for more than 20 years.
[01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:57.264]  They've been experimenting on them with mental patients in the military and others.
[01:02:58.324 --> 01:02:59.626]  And it is so draconian.
[01:02:59.626 --> 01:03:16.441]  So when they call something a vaccine, it's not the classic learned immunity like a 500-year-old smallpox vaccination that still had side effects and was dangerous, but in many cases did give people learned immunity when they were healthy instead of getting sick when they were run down, which then had a higher chance of morbidity.
[01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:17.662]  That's all real science.
[01:03:17.662 --> 01:03:20.725]  It's still Russian roulette, very, very dangerous.
[01:03:20.725 --> 01:03:23.968]  But now to have Bill Gates out in the open announcing world government,
[01:03:24.628 --> 01:03:28.272]  Announcing a digital ink that will be in the vaccine.
[01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:29.734]  This is official.
[01:03:29.734 --> 01:03:35.981]  ID2020 and other systems to be connected to your bank accounts so that'll be the new global currency.
[01:03:35.981 --> 01:03:41.107]  It's just a giant leap forward into this control system.
[01:03:41.107 --> 01:03:41.247]  So
[01:03:42.288 --> 01:03:45.929]  I've been down on air, and the listeners have been pretty upset and bummed out.
[01:03:45.929 --> 01:03:48.750]  But the good news is, this show's revelations is true.
[01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:49.790]  It shows God is real.
[01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:51.591]  It shows prophecy is real.
[01:03:51.591 --> 01:03:55.152]  And in my experience studying the New World Order, they are Satanists.
[01:03:55.152 --> 01:03:56.452]  They believe in the devil.
[01:03:56.452 --> 01:04:01.853]  So, so many people say, oh, that's the Jewish God, or that's the Christian God, and that's just your cosmology.
[01:04:01.853 --> 01:04:03.614]  You know, the Chinese don't have that.
[01:04:04.894 --> 01:04:06.155]  This group doesn't believe that.
[01:04:06.155 --> 01:04:10.137]  Well, actually, ladies and gentlemen, if you study every ancient culture, they believe in evil.
[01:04:10.137 --> 01:04:11.458]  They believe in evil spirits.
[01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:12.698]  They believe in good.
[01:04:12.698 --> 01:04:13.839]  The Native Americans did.
[01:04:13.839 --> 01:04:14.840]  Every culture did.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:22.424]  And these are all ways that ancient cultures were able to, you know, basically look at what they saw unfolding in the world and give it some type of meaning.
[01:04:23.184 --> 01:04:28.265]  But regardless, whether you believe the spiritual world or not, the globalists are manifesting it.
[01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:32.607]  They're pushing these archetypes, and they believe it, and they're actually building it.
[01:04:32.607 --> 01:04:39.809]  So whether you believe in Jesus Christ and the God of the Bible and Revelations or not, this system is being built and is anti-human.
[01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:43.409]  They're not trying to make us take microchips to all live in kumbaya heaven.
[01:04:43.409 --> 01:04:49.431]  They're doing it to literally remove us out of the world, dehumanize us, and then build a post-human planet.
[01:04:49.431 --> 01:04:52.452]  So this is wake up and say no or be destroyed forever.
[01:04:53.032 --> 01:04:53.773]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:53.773 --> 01:04:59.839]  Thank you for watching.
[01:04:59.839 --> 01:05:01.160]  Now that this U.N.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:12.310]  global government shy-com-billable into Gates' medical tyranny has seen how far they can push it now, we just lapped it up like poison.
[01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:16.935]  You know now they're going to launch more bio-attacks that are even more hardcore.
[01:05:16.935 --> 01:05:17.996]  This early one
[01:05:19.204 --> 01:05:22.387]  Does kill people, but see, it's a virus Bill and Melinda Gates own.
[01:05:22.387 --> 01:05:26.992]  It's a virus that's novel from others, so they can give you a vaccine.
[01:05:26.992 --> 01:05:31.797]  You see, a regular cold or flu virus, you really can't do a vaccine for because it's always mutating.
[01:05:31.797 --> 01:05:37.482]  But see, because this is a chimera and lab made, they can have a speciality.
[01:05:38.383 --> 01:05:39.985]  So it's a whole giant franchise.
[01:05:39.985 --> 01:05:41.747]  They get filthy rich off of it.
[01:05:41.747 --> 01:05:43.428]  They get to surveil everybody.
[01:05:43.428 --> 01:05:45.190]  Everybody gets to become a suspect.
[01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:50.776]  And now when you have low numbers of death, it doesn't matter because they make a huge spectacle out of it.
[01:05:50.776 --> 01:05:54.199]  You watch next year with the flu, it'll even be bigger as well.
[01:05:54.199 --> 01:05:56.822]  This is what they've done to us because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots.
[01:06:08.442 --> 01:06:13.346]  We're now into our number two broadcasting worldwide in the most dire times this planet has ever faced.
[01:06:13.346 --> 01:06:20.152]  World government, like a Klingon warship, uncloaked in the last two months.
[01:06:20.152 --> 01:06:21.313]  And it's firing on us.
[01:06:21.313 --> 01:06:23.735]  We won't use a cheesy Star Trek analogy.
[01:06:23.735 --> 01:06:24.555]  Just boom.
[01:06:24.555 --> 01:06:26.697]  Door closes.
[01:06:26.697 --> 01:06:28.379]  It's here.
[01:06:28.379 --> 01:06:28.519]  And...
[01:06:29.673 --> 01:06:31.255]  People are calling me on the street.
[01:06:31.255 --> 01:06:32.596]  They're running up, freaking out, apologizing.
[01:06:32.596 --> 01:06:33.737]  They're like, it's on the news!
[01:06:33.737 --> 01:06:34.538]  Implantable chips!
[01:06:34.538 --> 01:06:35.879]  World government!
[01:06:35.879 --> 01:06:39.383]  They're having pedophiles come to people's houses!
[01:06:39.383 --> 01:06:41.225]  World government's being announced!
[01:06:41.225 --> 01:06:42.546]  Forced inoculations, Jones!
[01:06:42.546 --> 01:06:43.327]  How did you know it?
[01:06:43.327 --> 01:06:45.910]  How did I know it?
[01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:52.817]  They've been programming everybody in the media and the culture for decades and they've got all the patents and they've got the preparations and
[01:06:54.209 --> 01:06:59.753]  They tried to hire my dad when he was in high school because he was top of his class.
[01:06:59.753 --> 01:07:06.078]  They hire everybody that's top of the class or try.
[01:07:06.078 --> 01:07:13.824]  The public has been so incredibly naive about everything.
[01:07:13.824 --> 01:07:16.746]  Well, I didn't grow up being naive.
[01:07:16.746 --> 01:07:20.529]  I didn't even realize growing up that I was around people that actually knew how stuff worked.
[01:07:20.529 --> 01:07:21.950]  I just thought everybody knew how stuff worked.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:33.467]  Oh yeah, wait till what I get to in the last segment of this hour.
[01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:34.688]  Let's not get to this yet.
[01:07:34.688 --> 01:07:35.909]  Let's save that.
[01:07:35.909 --> 01:07:40.033]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:07:40.033 --> 01:07:40.874]  I want to go to a lot of them.
[01:07:40.874 --> 01:07:43.316]  I don't want to make you wait.
[01:07:43.316 --> 01:07:48.940]  And I've got all this news to cover, but let me just restate the basics.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:53.284]  They debate whether 8 to 12 million people, it varies, die of starvation every year.
[01:07:56.434 --> 01:08:00.215]  And now the UN's reporting 30 million are going to starve to death.
[01:08:00.215 --> 01:08:03.855]  That's 20 million more in the next 12 months under this.
[01:08:03.855 --> 01:08:08.436]  That's official, put out press release from the United Nations.
[01:08:08.436 --> 01:08:20.078]  The very group orchestrating and running the shutdown of the world that causes the chain reaction, where over 2 billion people make less than a dollar a day.
[01:08:20.078 --> 01:08:23.479]  Hell, a bunch of them make like a dollar a week.
[01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.459]  And most of their money goes for food.
[01:08:27.912 --> 01:08:31.433]  Their children are barefoot.
[01:08:31.433 --> 01:08:33.353]  And the left's like, well, there are too many people, let them die.
[01:08:33.353 --> 01:08:38.455]  Okay, but then you care about everybody here and we've all got to wear masks so no old people die?
[01:08:38.455 --> 01:08:39.595]  Yeah, right.
[01:08:39.595 --> 01:08:43.376]  You're a sick death cult that loves killing people.
[01:08:43.376 --> 01:08:46.737]  And I got news for people that are selfish and think they get ahead like that.
[01:08:46.737 --> 01:08:49.298]  You're going to be the first when stuff collapses to go.
[01:08:49.298 --> 01:08:50.538]  In fact, the left
[01:08:51.690 --> 01:08:56.451]  Statistically has seven to eight to nine times, depending on the study, mental illness.
[01:08:56.451 --> 01:08:59.852]  Six, seven, eight, nine, ten times more likely to steal.
[01:08:59.852 --> 01:09:05.013]  You normally have three times the debt of a Christian or a conservative or a libertarian.
[01:09:05.013 --> 01:09:10.814]  You're physically ugly in all the studies.
[01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:13.314]  Because you're evil trash.
[01:09:13.314 --> 01:09:14.955]  And you know, I don't say that to be mean.
[01:09:14.955 --> 01:09:17.015]  You chose to resonate with evil.
[01:09:19.591 --> 01:09:25.437]  And so you've been turned into a biological android, a worthless piece of trash.
[01:09:25.437 --> 01:09:42.314]  And so of course you project onto us that we're a worthless piece of trash or some little kid starving in Africa or Latin America or Asia doesn't deserve a future when you cut their economy off on purpose in the name of saving people's lives and it causes 10,000 times the death!
[01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:50.620]  You will never metaphysically get away with that.
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.521]  God hates your guts.
[01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:55.202]  And boy, you think your God Satan's powerful.
[01:09:55.202 --> 01:09:58.182]  That's just because you don't have any connection to God.
[01:09:58.182 --> 01:10:02.183]  If you knew how the universe really worked, you'd be scared.
[01:10:02.183 --> 01:10:07.025]  I'm scared just thinking about what you've done.
[01:10:07.025 --> 01:10:10.906]  People ask how I'm not afraid of the new world order, all the stuff they're doing, because I'm afraid of God.
[01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:13.026]  And that's not like God's intimidating me.
[01:10:13.026 --> 01:10:14.627]  I've got in God's presence.
[01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:20.442]  Then let me tell you, that'll get you straight real quick.
[01:10:20.442 --> 01:10:26.744]  So, this is it.
[01:10:26.744 --> 01:10:35.246]  We weren't just gonna abort babies and devil worship and have pedophile story time and just sail off into the pedophile sunset.
[01:10:35.246 --> 01:10:37.687]  We're sailing off the edge of a damn cliff right now.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:59.143]  Now, I was gonna get to this at the start of the show, but I'm gonna just go to phone calls and I'm gonna hit this at the bottom of the hour, but guess what I have right here from Bloomberg?
[01:10:59.143 --> 01:11:08.385]  Global financial recess, global financial reset, both, worldwide bankruptcy.
[01:11:09.514 --> 01:11:12.997]  Starting with the states.
[01:11:12.997 --> 01:11:14.339]  And you know what that means?
[01:11:14.339 --> 01:11:16.901]  You ain't getting your pension funds, public employees.
[01:11:16.901 --> 01:11:20.144]  You dumb leftist morons.
[01:11:20.144 --> 01:11:21.566]  You took the bait.
[01:11:21.566 --> 01:11:22.727]  You said stay home.
[01:11:22.727 --> 01:11:24.148]  You stalled the economy.
[01:11:24.148 --> 01:11:26.811]  And all the numbers show it can't be reversed.
[01:11:26.811 --> 01:11:30.675]  And so now, you're getting ready to go bankrupt.
[01:11:32.202 --> 01:11:40.608]  And McConnell is only bringing this out now because they've been talking to the Justice Department and they're saying, do you really want to lose your pension funds leftist?
[01:11:40.608 --> 01:11:55.118]  Because you're the idiot schmucks that have hijacked the economy and are doing this to punish Americans for wanting to be prosperous and wanting to not lose a trade war with China and not wanting to get on our knees in front of the globalists, ding dong.
[01:11:57.386 --> 01:12:00.228]  Not wanting to, you know, let them have their way with us.
[01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:01.908]  Not let them spiritually rape us.
[01:12:01.908 --> 01:12:07.992]  Because that's what this is really all about.
[01:12:07.992 --> 01:12:10.893]  Let me tell you.
[01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:14.375]  Satan wants to rape you.
[01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:18.658]  And destroy your free will.
[01:12:18.658 --> 01:12:20.058]  God wants to love you.
[01:12:20.058 --> 01:12:22.700]  And McConnell's coming out saying this because
[01:12:24.352 --> 01:12:32.776]  We maybe have two weeks to turn this around before it's irrevocable and all your pension funds are worthless in California and Michigan.
[01:12:32.776 --> 01:12:36.498]  It's all the blue states that are going to go down the toilet.
[01:12:36.498 --> 01:12:37.439]  The red states are smart.
[01:12:40.865 --> 01:12:44.329]  And McConnell's like, uh, you're going to go bankrupt.
[01:12:44.329 --> 01:12:45.751]  That's better than us bailing you out.
[01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:54.861]  He's letting the Democrats know you're not getting a fiat bailout on the red states, paying for your blue state idiocy, trying to sink the country.
[01:12:54.861 --> 01:12:56.242]  You're going to go bankrupt.
[01:12:56.242 --> 01:12:59.947]  You're going to lose your pension funds because we're all going to lose them.
[01:13:01.109 --> 01:13:06.596]  In about two, three weeks, we're over the edge of the cliff, and it's bye-bye time.
[01:13:21.656 --> 01:13:30.221]  Having like half of your pension fund knocked out up front, and then a few years later they'll take the next half, and this damn virus is meant to kill your ass so they don't have to pay for the pension funds.
[01:13:30.221 --> 01:13:31.722]  I mean, that's what this is!
[01:13:31.722 --> 01:13:45.030]  So McConnell just is saying, hey, you don't want your pension funds, all this wear your mask and get all into it and have fun and play along with the new world order and have the fun, theater garbage.
[01:13:47.503 --> 01:13:50.426]  You're going to lose everything you've got.
[01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:51.987]  And the leftists have no memory.
[01:13:51.987 --> 01:13:55.911]  So when this all goes to Hell in a Handbasket, they'll point at those of us that warned them and say, we're bad.
[01:13:55.911 --> 01:14:01.156]  Because we don't take the microchip and the new digital currency that'll save things next year.
[01:14:01.156 --> 01:14:03.498]  This is it.
[01:14:03.498 --> 01:14:05.440]  Bringing us down to the ground.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.783]  Bankrupting us.
[01:14:08.783 --> 01:14:10.465]  So we'll submit to their total takeover.
[01:14:11.519 --> 01:14:14.160]  And their ridiculous dog training.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.202]  Now let's play the John Roberts video that keeps people waking up.
[01:14:18.202 --> 01:14:19.243]  It's going viral everywhere.
[01:14:19.243 --> 01:14:22.004]  Which is confirmed to be real.
[01:14:22.004 --> 01:14:23.125]  It's in the damn health department.
[01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:27.307]  The numbers are real!
[01:14:27.307 --> 01:14:30.149]  That less than 1%.
[01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:34.891]  16% of 1% are dying in LA County.
[01:14:34.891 --> 01:14:38.253]  And here he is saying you can take your damn mask off in the White House briefing room.
[01:14:40.503 --> 01:14:41.183]  All right, man.
[01:14:41.183 --> 01:14:42.384]  Where do you go, buddy?
[01:14:42.384 --> 01:14:44.746]  You can take off your mask, though.
[01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:47.608]  The case fatality rate's at 0.1 to 0.3, according to USC.
[01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:49.829]  Is it really?
[01:14:49.829 --> 01:14:51.210]  That's reassuring.
[01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:53.492]  Everybody here's been vaccinated anyway.
[01:14:53.492 --> 01:14:54.232]  USC and L.A.
[01:14:54.232 --> 01:15:07.782]  County Public Health came out with a study that found that there are 7,000 cases in California, but they literally believe that there are anywhere from 221,000 to 442,000 people who were infected.
[01:15:07.782 --> 01:15:08.102]  Really?
[01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:10.699]  So that makes it 0.1 to 0.3?
[01:15:10.699 --> 01:15:17.645]  Does the study think about what you're doing?
[01:15:17.645 --> 01:15:19.126]  It was a hoax!
[01:15:19.126 --> 01:15:21.808]  I don't think it was a hoax.
[01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:44.055]  No, it's not a hoax, because if you look at a whole field of clover, there's probably two or three four-leaf clovers in there.
[01:15:44.055 --> 01:15:46.536]  And you say, hey, that field's got four-leaf clovers in it.
[01:15:46.536 --> 01:15:48.876]  It's not a hoax to say they're there, it's just super rare.
[01:15:48.876 --> 01:15:55.039]  So the virus isn't a hoax, it's just like a four-leaf clover that gave Bill Gates control of the whole planet in your life.
[01:15:57.290 --> 01:16:00.732]  Attention all radio listeners who still need food supplies.
[01:16:00.732 --> 01:16:10.096]  If you've thought about the implication of food-related supply chain disruptions and are concerned about the coming quarantines, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:16:10.096 --> 01:16:11.017]  Here's why.
[01:16:11.017 --> 01:16:15.099]  In the next few days, all Americans will face extremely hard choices.
[01:16:15.099 --> 01:16:22.803]  If we've learned anything from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days away here in the U.S.
[01:16:23.203 --> 01:16:31.391]  Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce, you can still get enough open-pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one-acre crisis garden.
[01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:38.157]  The truth is, growing nutrient-dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single most important thing you do.
[01:16:38.157 --> 01:16:43.562]  Go to survivalseabank.com and watch the new video to understand the nature of the threat.
[01:16:43.562 --> 01:16:44.863]  This could be life-saving!
[01:16:45.223 --> 01:16:48.105]  Lockdowns can last from six to eight weeks.

[01:17:58.796 --> 01:18:04.739]  The America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the free, home of the brave, is dying right now.
[01:18:04.739 --> 01:18:11.501]  And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us, shutting us down, and making us dependent on them.
[01:18:11.501 --> 01:18:13.562]  The food shortages have begun.
[01:18:13.562 --> 01:18:16.443]  The depression is going to be long and very, very serious.
[01:18:16.443 --> 01:18:18.684]  In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[01:18:18.684 --> 01:18:19.625]  Trump tried to stop it.
[01:18:20.205 --> 01:18:22.746]  But the mainstream media working with the shy comms blocked it.
[01:18:22.746 --> 01:18:27.267]  That's why you and myself, everybody else, has to get prepared now.
[01:18:27.267 --> 01:18:28.067]  Do not wait.
[01:18:28.067 --> 01:18:29.007]  It's not about the virus.
[01:18:29.007 --> 01:18:33.649]  It's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year.
[01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:36.429]  Get your high-quality, storable foods at infowarshore.com.
[01:18:36.429 --> 01:18:38.670]  They're available again, but for a limited time.
[01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:40.590]  The food supply is running out.
[01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:42.091]  There are major shortages.
[01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:47.555]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism.
[01:18:47.555 --> 01:18:50.798]  But we the people, the patriots, have to be prepared.
[01:18:50.798 --> 01:18:52.720]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.141]  We'll get ready to be really proven right.
[01:18:54.141 --> 01:18:56.403]  Get your storable foods now at infowarestore.com.
[01:18:58.154 --> 01:19:05.038]  There's a process where you take a stallion and you tie him down and you cut his testicles off and then he becomes gelded.
[01:19:05.038 --> 01:19:07.799]  Well, that's what's happening to the entire world right now.
[01:19:07.799 --> 01:19:09.860]  We're going into deep, deep tyranny.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:12.722]  Places like North Korea and China are going into deeper tyranny as well.
[01:19:12.722 --> 01:19:14.362]  It's all directed by the UN.
[01:19:14.362 --> 01:19:16.744]  It's all a big, cooked up, giant plan.
[01:19:17.424 --> 01:19:22.789]  To absolutely take control of your life, bankrupt the economy, and make you dependent on the big mega banks.
[01:19:22.789 --> 01:19:30.095]  And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations, brainwash your kids the way they say, and have absolutely no freedom.
[01:19:30.095 --> 01:19:32.096]  And it's all happening, boom, overnight.
[01:19:32.096 --> 01:19:34.118]  This is a giant revolution.
[01:19:34.118 --> 01:19:38.021]  And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said, oh, it's just an extended spring break, two weeks.
[01:19:38.021 --> 01:19:40.804]  Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years.
[01:19:40.804 --> 01:19:41.945]  It never ends.
[01:19:41.945 --> 01:19:44.127]  No one can ever die from a virus again.
[01:19:44.127 --> 01:19:45.167]  Government will save you.
[01:19:45.988 --> 01:19:47.229]  It's a takeover.
[01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:47.989]  It's the opposite.
[01:19:47.989 --> 01:20:01.259]  They're coming with forced inoculations on record that will reduce your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases kill you, and they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[01:20:01.259 --> 01:20:03.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:29.374 --> 01:20:40.957]  Well, it was a month ago, the longer we put out the Gregory's Report, that COVID-19 is the perfect storm for global reset, and now it's being announced blue states are
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:47.944]  We're going to have all their pension funds taken, if you're a county, city, or state folks.
[01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:50.725]  And that was the plan for everybody, and well, you get what you want.
[01:20:50.725 --> 01:20:56.109]  So, you want to destroy America and have a depression like Bill Maher talked about?
[01:20:56.109 --> 01:20:57.450]  Okay.
[01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:02.193]  Well, you guys are the most leveraged out, so it's going to hit you hardest, but that's why they call you dumbasses.
[01:21:02.193 --> 01:21:04.154]  That's why they call you Satanists.
[01:21:04.154 --> 01:21:08.777]  You just don't understand the good sense the Lord gave you.
[01:21:08.777 --> 01:21:10.058]  Let's just do this, though.
[01:21:11.616 --> 01:21:13.217]  Let's start going to your phone calls as promised.
[01:21:13.217 --> 01:21:18.699]  Don, Dave, Kenny, Tricia, Patrick, Steve, Jesse, Tammy and many others.
[01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:24.341]  Tammy in California, where they've got you positioned for total collapse.
[01:21:24.341 --> 01:21:26.642]  What is your take on all this?
[01:21:26.642 --> 01:21:28.443]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:21:28.443 --> 01:21:30.884]  Gavin just put something out yesterday in California.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.145]  He's announcing his new plan to gently introduce California to socialism.
[01:21:36.145 --> 01:21:46.976]  He's not reopening the state, but he has launched a website for every healthy Californian to volunteer and says he wants to grow an army to do all the work needed for free.
[01:21:47.964 --> 01:22:04.627]  Well that's right, because you're not essential at your regular job, or your regular shop, or the little restaurant you have, or your dog grooming thing, or you maybe do people's lashes, or maybe you do gardening, or maybe you write books, but you're going to be, I saw that, you're going to be essential though under the psychopath governor.
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:07.301]  Exactly.
[01:22:07.301 --> 01:22:07.762]  Exactly.
[01:22:07.762 --> 01:22:09.103]  In fact, I meant to cover that.
[01:22:09.103 --> 01:22:11.044]  It's in my stack, but I won't be able to probably find it.
[01:22:11.044 --> 01:22:12.025]  There's so many articles.
[01:22:12.025 --> 01:22:18.450]  But you guys, Gavin Newsom launched his volunteer force to put California back to work.
[01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:19.891]  I saw that last night.
[01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:23.193]  But again, you can only work for him because he's essential.
[01:22:23.193 --> 01:22:24.054]  You like how that works?
[01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:26.327]  No, because you know what?
[01:22:26.327 --> 01:22:28.228]  We didn't vote for Gavin Newsom.
[01:22:28.228 --> 01:22:31.030]  When we went to bed that night, Cox was in the lead.
[01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:33.732]  There are several screen captures of the television screen.
[01:22:33.732 --> 01:22:36.633]  Oh, there's no election fraud in blue states.
[01:22:36.633 --> 01:22:37.274]  No, it's true.
[01:22:37.274 --> 01:22:41.156]  Blue states never go back because of total fraud, yeah.
[01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:46.059]  So yeah, the website that he has launched is called Californians for All.
[01:22:46.059 --> 01:22:47.360]  Isn't that nice and free?
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:50.002]  Oh, you work for free as a slave, yeah.
[01:22:50.002 --> 01:22:51.523]  Californians for All.
[01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:53.871]  Not for this, Ms.
[01:22:53.871 --> 01:22:54.992]  Prehens, I don't.
[01:22:54.992 --> 01:23:01.439]  So is that CaliforniansForAll.com or .gov or .state?
[01:23:01.439 --> 01:23:05.122]  It says CalifornianVolunteers.ca.gov.
[01:23:05.122 --> 01:23:06.244]  Yeah, yeah, there it is.
[01:23:08.236 --> 01:23:10.057]  Oh, forced labor.
[01:23:10.057 --> 01:23:16.883]  Because you know in the future, like North Korea or Venezuela, you're going to have to go out and do your days of work.
[01:23:16.883 --> 01:23:20.726]  A lot of times at private companies, like you're a prisoner, we're all trustees now.
[01:23:20.726 --> 01:23:27.512]  But if we do a good job, we can leave our houses and have our little card and go, I'm essential.
[01:23:27.512 --> 01:23:28.073]  I'm essential.
[01:23:29.392 --> 01:23:30.992]  Oh, and they want us to give blood.
[01:23:30.992 --> 01:23:34.633]  I wouldn't allow anybody in the state of California to stick a needle in my eye.
[01:23:34.633 --> 01:23:38.335]  Oh, you know, California and Arkansas, run by Democrats at the time, are famous.
[01:23:38.335 --> 01:23:42.296]  They get your blood and then sell it and make money, personally.
[01:23:42.296 --> 01:23:47.337]  The Clintons made over $50 million on prisoners' blood with HIV.
[01:23:47.337 --> 01:23:48.057]  I believe it.
[01:23:48.057 --> 01:23:49.458]  Remember, California passed the law.
[01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:50.458]  You can give people HIV now.
[01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:51.738]  Isn't that liberal?
[01:23:51.738 --> 01:23:52.939]  Oh, yes, that's true.
[01:23:52.939 --> 01:23:53.479]  That's true.
[01:23:53.479 --> 01:23:55.499]  That's liberal.
[01:23:55.499 --> 01:23:57.840]  And you have absolutely no recourse to sue.
[01:23:58.641 --> 01:24:01.802]  And the Senator's trying to pass a law that pedophilia is legal.
[01:24:01.802 --> 01:24:04.484]  As long as it's same sex.
[01:24:04.484 --> 01:24:06.464]  That doesn't surprise me.
[01:24:06.464 --> 01:24:08.605]  Same guy.
[01:24:08.605 --> 01:24:09.426]  You didn't see that?
[01:24:09.426 --> 01:24:09.966]  I'm not kidding.
[01:24:09.966 --> 01:24:11.427]  It's crazy.
[01:24:11.427 --> 01:24:12.887]  I didn't see that.
[01:24:12.887 --> 01:24:16.549]  There's so many lawless laws that are passed in California.
[01:24:16.549 --> 01:24:19.270]  I disregard them because they go against the Constitution.
[01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:26.373]  So I'm sure a lot of the gun owners here in California disregard all the gun laws they've supposedly passed because
[01:24:26.758 --> 01:24:30.859]  They go against the Constitution of the United States of America.
[01:24:30.859 --> 01:24:31.580]  You're right, ma'am.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:32.280]  God bless you.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.760]  We're all in this together.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.182]  What do you make of the incredible footage of the hot mic?
[01:24:37.182 --> 01:24:38.642]  People don't care that L.A.
[01:24:38.642 --> 01:24:44.284]  County, 600-something dead out of 400,000 that have it, showing it's less than 1%, like we said.
[01:24:44.284 --> 01:24:45.364]  16% of 1%.
[01:24:45.364 --> 01:24:49.146]  I mean, we're talking ultra low.
[01:24:49.146 --> 01:24:51.807]  But nobody cares about the actual statistic from the county.
[01:24:51.807 --> 01:24:55.308]  They just are freaking out that behind the scenes, the media knows it's a hoax.
[01:24:57.483 --> 01:24:58.383]  She's gone.
[01:24:58.383 --> 01:25:01.244]  Wanted to get her take on that because that is so massive.
[01:25:01.244 --> 01:25:05.366]  That's the clip when you go in a store and they're saying, where are your masks?
[01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:07.127]  Where are your masks?
[01:25:07.127 --> 01:25:09.928]  You just show them that and say, you're an idiot.
[01:25:09.928 --> 01:25:11.908]  Because next it'll be, take your shot.
[01:25:11.908 --> 01:25:13.349]  Take your shot.
[01:25:13.349 --> 01:25:16.550]  They're coming for your pension funds.
[01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:17.831]  But you don't care.
[01:25:17.831 --> 01:25:18.671]  You're leftist.
[01:25:18.671 --> 01:25:19.951]  You want to lose them.
[01:25:19.951 --> 01:25:21.472]  You like it.
[01:25:21.472 --> 01:25:23.773]  As long as America collapses, you love it.
[01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:34.898]  Let's talk to Dave in North Carolina, where the bioweapon virus originally was sold by Obama and Fauci to the Chi-Coms.
[01:25:34.898 --> 01:25:36.980]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:38.241]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[01:25:38.241 --> 01:25:42.085]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:25:42.085 --> 01:25:49.653]  The major thing that I want to talk about is messaging and how the media is using messaging
[01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:53.532]  For behavior control and always have.
[01:25:53.532 --> 01:25:55.254]  And I've got an example right here.
[01:25:55.254 --> 01:25:59.397]  It's like, death's way down in Michigan, but people think it's the end of the world.
[01:25:59.397 --> 01:26:04.260]  They're just hyping the living hell out of everything.
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:05.381]  Right, exactly.
[01:26:05.381 --> 01:26:10.445]  And that's when you own the messaging, you own the behavior.
[01:26:10.445 --> 01:26:13.086]  And you can get whatever behavior that you want.
[01:26:13.086 --> 01:26:18.971]  And unfortunately, what's happened is that with alternative media sources, people like you,
[01:26:19.711 --> 01:26:20.072]  I'm good.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.541]  And so now they're bringing on the big mega hoax of this to get rid of our speech, everything.
[01:26:39.541 --> 01:26:45.843]  I mean, notice that Facebook and Google and Twitter are banning anyone that organizes a protest against this.
[01:26:45.843 --> 01:26:48.504]  You're being called obsolete, non-essential.
[01:26:48.504 --> 01:26:50.965]  You're being told they're about to bankrupt everything.
[01:26:50.965 --> 01:26:59.347]  And then if you try to protest, a liberal from Harvard, Zuckerberg, goes, sorry, you don't have speech, because I'm a liberal.
[01:27:01.770 --> 01:27:04.313]  Exactly.
[01:27:04.313 --> 01:27:12.421]  Look at the education system that we have, and the way that our kids come out of school absolutely ignorant of anything.
[01:27:12.421 --> 01:27:16.424]  They can't tell you anything in the preamble of the Constitution.
[01:27:16.424 --> 01:27:19.888]  They can't tell you what Article 1, 2, and 3 represent.
[01:27:19.888 --> 01:27:23.772]  They can't even name off the constitutional amendments.
[01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:25.073]  And then they go off to college.
[01:27:26.486 --> 01:27:31.471]  And they're taught some garbage and constantly are... Oh you just said it.
[01:27:31.471 --> 01:27:39.099]  Notice they have lockdowns at colleges and days that white people can't be there and distancing and you know all this neuroses.
[01:27:39.099 --> 01:27:41.482]  This is how they're launching into our daily lives.
[01:27:41.482 --> 01:27:45.286]  Where we all enforce on each other to wear the mask six feet apart.
[01:27:45.286 --> 01:27:46.387]  Can't bring your kid in the store.
[01:27:46.587 --> 01:27:48.348]  And the next is take your vaccine.
[01:27:48.348 --> 01:27:49.770]  Go to your work brigade.
[01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:52.412]  Do what you have to now to get things going.
[01:27:52.412 --> 01:27:54.313]  To prove you're part of the team.
[01:27:54.313 --> 01:27:55.534]  These people are morons.
[01:27:55.534 --> 01:27:56.956]  They've forgotten history.
[01:27:56.956 --> 01:27:58.537]  They've learned to hate America.
[01:27:58.537 --> 01:28:01.940]  And so now, all their prosperity is going to be sucked out of them.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:06.003]  But because they have no memory, because they're not conscious, a lot of them don't have souls now.
[01:28:06.003 --> 01:28:07.044]  They've lost them.
[01:28:07.044 --> 01:28:08.945]  They're just robots and don't care.
[01:28:08.945 --> 01:28:13.289]  As long as they feel like they're winning while they schmuck off the edge of a cliff.
[01:28:13.289 --> 01:28:14.370]  I appreciate your call, Dave.
[01:28:15.546 --> 01:28:23.469]  And all these folks that think they're going to protect themselves by going along with the system and getting more money and running the New Zealand.
[01:28:23.469 --> 01:28:34.133]  I remember, as I told you 15 years ago, all the big Hollywood money was saying we're done with movies, we don't care about the money, we're all running because there's going to be a Bio-Weapon release to kill everybody on the planet.
[01:28:34.946 --> 01:28:38.628]  And we're all building bunkers in New Zealand and now it's in the news that's the case.
[01:28:38.628 --> 01:28:40.930]  This is only the test bioweapon.
[01:28:40.930 --> 01:28:42.410]  The real ones are coming.
[01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:48.394]  Once you learn to lock down properly, they're gonna hit you with drone-delivered bioweapons and you're all dead.
[01:28:48.394 --> 01:28:51.155]  Remember, I don't say something unless I mean it.
[01:28:51.155 --> 01:28:54.637]  Going along with this is certain death for you and your family.
[01:28:54.637 --> 01:28:55.298]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:57.361 --> 01:29:08.553]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:29:08.553 --> 01:29:15.440]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:16.060]  I think so.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:39.300]  That's right.
[01:29:59.403 --> 01:30:05.545]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy use by half.
[01:30:05.545 --> 01:30:07.806]  And the United States wouldn't sign on to it.
[01:30:07.806 --> 01:30:08.946]  So guess what happened?
[01:30:08.946 --> 01:30:16.029]  Along came COVID-19, and Bill Gates is celebrating, saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[01:30:16.029 --> 01:30:19.410]  And that means you're going to be poor now, and under his control.
[01:30:19.410 --> 01:30:26.893]  And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the forced inoculations, a eek microchip that comes with the vaccine, and so much more.
[01:30:27.373 --> 01:30:32.376]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[01:30:32.376 --> 01:30:37.278]  So remember folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[01:30:37.278 --> 01:30:45.142]  The same left that says kill babies all day long, women own their bodies, now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[01:30:45.362 --> 01:30:48.124]  And if you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home.
[01:30:48.124 --> 01:30:48.984]  Mark the Beast.
[01:30:48.984 --> 01:30:50.365]  Oh, and guess what?
[01:30:50.365 --> 01:30:56.649]  Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates and are a bunch of dirty devil worshippers in your face.
[01:30:56.649 --> 01:30:57.810]  They hate you and your family.
[01:30:58.706 --> 01:31:06.632]  Globalism is all about making the nation-state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[01:31:06.632 --> 01:31:19.101]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[01:31:19.101 --> 01:31:25.126]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out,
[01:31:25.706 --> 01:31:29.989]  They can simply look at us and say, because again, you are not essential.
[01:31:29.989 --> 01:31:33.012]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[01:31:33.012 --> 01:31:37.175]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[01:31:37.175 --> 01:31:40.998]  We can be told to stay in our houses, and after all, shut up!
[01:31:40.998 --> 01:31:42.659]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways.
[01:31:42.659 --> 01:31:47.182]  It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[01:31:47.182 --> 01:31:48.964]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[01:31:49.741 --> 01:31:52.883]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[01:31:52.883 --> 01:31:58.348]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[01:31:58.348 --> 01:32:12.679]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level, on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[01:32:13.319 --> 01:32:29.991]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19, and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the CHICOMS at the World Health Organization, with Bill Gates involved, are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[01:32:29.991 --> 01:32:30.491]  Thank you, everybody.
[01:32:30.491 --> 01:32:31.231]  This is insane.
[01:32:31.231 --> 01:32:33.932]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[01:32:33.932 --> 01:32:35.373]  You need to get prepared now.
[01:32:35.373 --> 01:32:39.914]  You need to get high-quality, storable food now back in stock at InfowarStore.com.
[01:32:39.914 --> 01:32:44.015]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[01:32:44.015 --> 01:32:50.278]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[01:32:50.278 --> 01:32:51.638]  This is beyond 1984.
[01:32:51.638 --> 01:32:53.859]  The tyranny of the new world order is here.
[01:32:53.859 --> 01:32:56.279]  Get prepared now and spread the word of the Infowar.
[01:32:56.279 --> 01:32:57.700]  You are the Paul Reveres!
[01:33:01.195 --> 01:33:03.832]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:36.850 --> 01:33:39.332]  They've seen this a lot in the last few months.
[01:33:39.332 --> 01:33:54.821]  They said, oh, when it gets bad and three million people die in the United States, we're going to stop resuscitating people that have heart attacks, whether they be 50 years old or 80 years old, because we need the hospital space.
[01:33:54.821 --> 01:34:02.206]  Well, now they admit that the hospitals are three times emptier than they've ever been in the last 50 years.
[01:34:02.206 --> 01:34:05.568]  The National Health Service reports they're four times more empty than ever.
[01:34:12.095 --> 01:34:22.705]  But now when you have a heart attack, just like Venezuela, they don't resuscitate you because that's non-essential.
[01:34:22.705 --> 01:34:23.626]  And you're non-essential.
[01:34:23.626 --> 01:34:27.550]  When I was looking the numbers up, we had a guest on talking about this and I didn't even know this.
[01:34:29.625 --> 01:34:33.326]  You get four... In fact, I even pulled the article a few nights ago when David Icke said it.
[01:34:33.326 --> 01:34:34.346]  I didn't know that.
[01:34:34.346 --> 01:34:44.429]  The feds give a hospital, if someone doesn't have coverage, $4,000 for pneumonia, $40,000 for COVID-19.
[01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:49.231]  So they can say, you know, a kitchen sink or a roll of toilet paper has got COVID-19.
[01:34:49.231 --> 01:34:51.632]  It's just a giant hoax.
[01:34:51.632 --> 01:34:53.952]  The virus is man-made.
[01:34:53.952 --> 01:34:55.773]  It mutates.
[01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:58.234]  It goes after testicles.
[01:34:58.234 --> 01:34:59.214]  And it kills old people.
[01:35:01.226 --> 01:35:10.872]  But it's really novel because it's been engineered to show the NIH and the CHICOMS can own it and own the response to it.
[01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:12.252]  New York Post.
[01:35:12.252 --> 01:35:12.893]  New York issues.
[01:35:12.893 --> 01:35:18.276]  Do not resuscitate guidelines for cardiac patients amid coronavirus.
[01:35:18.276 --> 01:35:18.956]  Yep.
[01:35:18.956 --> 01:35:21.438]  So there you go.
[01:35:21.438 --> 01:35:22.719]  Death panels, folks.
[01:35:22.719 --> 01:35:23.219]  Bye-bye.
[01:35:26.972 --> 01:35:29.814]  And we're not going to take care of the old people or anybody else.
[01:35:29.814 --> 01:35:32.215]  Everybody has to die now.
[01:35:32.215 --> 01:35:36.538]  Like the 30 million people the UN says are starving to death now because of the lockdown.
[01:35:36.538 --> 01:35:37.579]  That's okay!
[01:35:37.579 --> 01:35:39.260]  30 million are cool!
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:44.943]  Because it's so fun to wear a mask and act all avant-garde and we're all doing this together.
[01:35:44.943 --> 01:35:49.406]  We're all heroes and the medical workers are such heroes.
[01:35:49.406 --> 01:35:50.807]  Well, yeah.
[01:35:50.807 --> 01:35:54.470]  I think emergency room workers and people that
[01:35:56.494 --> 01:36:03.921]  Our technicians, paramedics on the ambulances have got one of the hardest jobs you can have.
[01:36:03.921 --> 01:36:08.405]  I've had friends that are, or were paramedics, they have the highest level of PTSD I've ever seen.
[01:36:08.405 --> 01:36:09.947]  I mean, the stories they tell.
[01:36:09.947 --> 01:36:15.452]  I mean, dead kids, kids dead that ate their dad's cocaine, kids eaten by pit bulls.
[01:36:15.452 --> 01:36:16.353]  The worst thing is little kids.
[01:36:18.683 --> 01:36:27.568]  I've seen war footage that we never put on air, but nobody puts it on air of kids' arms and legs blowing off, lower mandibles blowing off, going, my, my, my, my!
[01:36:27.568 --> 01:36:37.734]  And there was no lower... and the tongue's all like a Colombian necktie, little girls going... I mean, I made myself watch like five minutes of it once, and I have nightmares about it today.
[01:36:37.734 --> 01:36:46.280]  So, I mean, I get there are a lot of amazing medical workers, and I'm out here virtue signaling, you know, kissing your ass with this fake counterfeit currency of caring.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:47.841]  I get they're badasses.
[01:36:48.721 --> 01:36:53.583]  I mean, long-term cops that are in big cities and areas, I mean, they see some stuff.
[01:36:53.583 --> 01:36:57.925]  You can be the toughest guy around, and you see, especially kids smashed up in cars.
[01:36:57.925 --> 01:37:01.987]  I've seen a few car wrecks where people had their heads cut off and arms cut off, and I help people.
[01:37:01.987 --> 01:37:02.888]  They're like, help me!
[01:37:02.888 --> 01:37:04.648]  Oh, my arm's like spewing blood on you.
[01:37:04.648 --> 01:37:09.551]  And, you know, you handle it at the time, and you go home and sleep for two days.
[01:37:09.551 --> 01:37:11.992]  I get it.
[01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:13.332]  I've only seen a few things like that.
[01:37:13.332 --> 01:37:14.313]  It traumatized me, but
[01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:17.170]  I got family that are nurses or doctors.
[01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:21.953]  They're drinking vodka and having sex and watching pornos and Netflix, okay?
[01:37:21.953 --> 01:37:25.074]  And I was told by separate people that, yeah, well, we're having a party.
[01:37:25.074 --> 01:37:26.395]  I go, what are you doing?
[01:37:26.395 --> 01:37:27.156]  Well, what do you think?
[01:37:27.156 --> 01:37:29.077]  The nurses and the doctors are having a good time.
[01:37:29.077 --> 01:37:29.597]  What are you doing?
[01:37:29.597 --> 01:37:30.818]  What do you think we're doing?
[01:37:30.818 --> 01:37:32.018]  Watching porn and Netflix?
[01:37:32.018 --> 01:37:34.400]  Yeah.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.160]  I got to talk to family.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.441]  They go, I'm watching porn and drinking vodka.
[01:37:37.441 --> 01:37:39.002]  And I was like, oh, you're having a party?
[01:37:39.002 --> 01:37:39.543]  What's going on?
[01:37:39.543 --> 01:37:40.483]  Well, there's nobody here.
[01:37:40.483 --> 01:37:42.824]  We're just, what do you think we're doing?
[01:37:42.824 --> 01:37:43.625]  You're banging the nurses.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:47.361]  I mean, this is a family show.
[01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:50.742]  I'm just telling you, there's nobody in the damn hospitals.
[01:37:50.742 --> 01:37:55.584]  They're in there having orgies, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:55.584 --> 01:37:59.786]  So, I'm not going to sit here and play along with this crap.
[01:37:59.786 --> 01:38:03.187]  I said get storable food, and I said get prepared.
[01:38:04.815 --> 01:38:09.698]  And I said, do all that because they're going to bring down the economy and things are insane.
[01:38:09.698 --> 01:38:15.282]  And I believe if I was them, and I hate to give my ideas, but I've studied them so long that they're not getting them from me.
[01:38:15.282 --> 01:38:15.962]  I've studied them.
[01:38:15.962 --> 01:38:17.103]  It's the other way around.
[01:38:17.103 --> 01:38:19.204]  It's not, they're not getting it from me.
[01:38:19.204 --> 01:38:20.285]  I just don't know how I call it.
[01:38:20.285 --> 01:38:23.847]  So that on.
[01:38:23.847 --> 01:38:27.510]  They've got mutagenic viruses that show up as a cold bug.
[01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:33.634]  And if you want to have a tailored cold bug, a coronavirus, it's just the most common thing there is folks.
[01:38:35.552 --> 01:38:45.970]  That you use a bioweapon, you can release strains of it that only mutate and only replicate enough times to kill somebody.
[01:38:48.393 --> 01:38:48.653]  And that's
[01:39:09.901 --> 01:39:15.104]  They can tailor bioweapons that aren't just race-specific, they can tailor them to an individual.
[01:39:15.104 --> 01:39:22.468]  Though they'd have to have your blood and a bunch of tests would be expensive, but that's why they want everybody's DNA.
[01:39:22.468 --> 01:39:26.570]  It's all in the DNA.
[01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:32.213]  And now they've got DNA vaccines that are not RNA for the virus, it's for your body.
[01:39:33.243 --> 01:39:36.044]  Now that's so dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:36.044 --> 01:39:44.606]  I mean, live viruses are hell enough on you and cause massive cancer and infertility and autoimmune diseases off the chart with Gardasil and things like this.
[01:39:44.606 --> 01:39:46.766]  This isn't a live virus cupcake.
[01:39:46.766 --> 01:39:53.248]  This is a DNA injection.
[01:39:53.248 --> 01:39:56.489]  And as they reported, some of these vaccines have the whole human genome in them.
[01:39:58.584 --> 01:40:05.909]  So yeah, this is a nightmare scenario from hell.
[01:40:05.909 --> 01:40:08.110]  But hey, at least all the sneaking around is over.
[01:40:08.110 --> 01:40:10.292]  The New World Order is out in the open.
[01:40:10.292 --> 01:40:13.914]  They're going to send pedophiles convicted to your school to vouch your kid on their name.
[01:40:13.914 --> 01:40:15.075]  They're going to track you with drones.
[01:40:15.075 --> 01:40:16.616]  They're going to forcibly inject you.
[01:40:16.616 --> 01:40:19.858]  They're going to make your job obsolete and put you in forced labor brigades.
[01:40:19.858 --> 01:40:21.819]  It's all being announced.
[01:40:21.819 --> 01:40:25.102]  Because Thomas Jefferson was asked once in a letter by a member of the
[01:40:26.283 --> 01:40:30.768]  Virginia Legislature, the Commonwealth.
[01:40:30.768 --> 01:40:32.991]  What is the limit of tyranny man will accept?
[01:40:32.991 --> 01:40:39.879]  And he said, is the limit to which you will accept?
[01:40:39.879 --> 01:40:43.383]  Tyrants will always override the next tyrant.
[01:40:43.383 --> 01:40:46.307]  There's no limit to the black hole.
[01:40:47.628 --> 01:40:48.468]  So you think about that.
[01:40:48.468 --> 01:40:49.189]  We're going to go to break.
[01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:51.090]  I said I'd get to Rob Dews' big piece.
[01:40:51.090 --> 01:40:52.551]  I'm really excited about Torba coming on.
[01:40:52.551 --> 01:40:53.871]  Let's push him back to 15 after.
[01:40:53.871 --> 01:40:54.752]  He'll understand.
[01:40:54.752 --> 01:40:59.854]  I'll premiere that second segment and then get to Torba and his big news from Gab.
[01:40:59.854 --> 01:41:06.338]  Then we'll continue, but I want to go to your phone calls next segment, the next, and then we'll get to that report and then wait till you see this.
[01:41:06.338 --> 01:41:10.120]  But I've got like six or seven reports we haven't premiered yet that they're all just
[01:41:12.509 --> 01:41:16.916]  I mean, if you went and saw a science fiction movie five years ago with this stuff in it, you'd be scared.
[01:41:16.916 --> 01:41:19.079]  Like, God, this is a scary movie.
[01:41:19.079 --> 01:41:22.084]  But since it's happening in the real world, there's this cognitive dissonance.
[01:41:22.084 --> 01:41:22.464]  It's crazy.
[01:41:24.892 --> 01:41:27.454]  We're funded by viewers and listeners like you.
[01:41:27.454 --> 01:41:28.936]  The globalists are trying to shut us down.
[01:41:28.936 --> 01:41:29.857]  I want to stay in the fight.
[01:41:29.857 --> 01:41:31.218]  Plus, we've got great products you need.
[01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:33.100]  I want to thank you all for your support.

[01:42:34.743 --> 01:42:40.488]  Terrible Food, now available again, but they may pause orders again to get the orders out, so get your orders in while you can.
[01:42:40.488 --> 01:42:49.856]  For the Great Depression, the globalists are engineering, because the total stock market crash is set for about a month from now, unless we avert it, in the put options.
[01:42:49.856 --> 01:42:54.961]  The put options have got it set to go down about May 22nd.
[01:42:57.202 --> 01:43:02.627]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars can now offer high-quality, affordable food again.
[01:43:02.627 --> 01:43:08.172]  Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago, and they told people they had food.
[01:43:08.172 --> 01:43:10.734]  Most folks never would deliver their food.
[01:43:10.734 --> 01:43:19.222]  Well, when our sponsors' food began to run short, they just suspended sales until they opened more factories and secured more food.
[01:43:19.622 --> 01:43:24.465]  So if you get your orders in right now, they can take new orders and get it to you quickly.
[01:43:24.465 --> 01:43:38.035]  They'll probably have to suspend orders very, very soon again because the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution, farming, you name it, and now it's mainstream news that food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen.
[01:43:38.775 --> 01:43:45.478]  If Trump can turn the economy back on and wrest control of our system away from the globalists, things may be okay.
[01:43:45.478 --> 01:43:47.718]  But it looks like it's going to get very, very rough.
[01:43:47.718 --> 01:43:54.341]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number one thing you need, high quality, storable food, ready to get to you and your family.
[01:43:54.341 --> 01:43:57.342]  Now, if you get your orders in at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:57.342 --> 01:43:59.703]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[01:43:59.703 --> 01:44:00.283]  They're amazing.
[01:44:00.283 --> 01:44:00.963]  They're cutting edge.
[01:44:00.963 --> 01:44:01.444]  You love them.
[01:44:01.444 --> 01:44:02.024]  I love them.
[01:44:02.024 --> 01:44:04.805]  And they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[01:44:05.663 --> 01:44:12.427]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[01:44:12.427 --> 01:44:20.092]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[01:44:20.092 --> 01:44:22.413]  And there's another innovation.
[01:44:22.413 --> 01:44:24.494]  It's the spray cap.
[01:44:24.494 --> 01:44:32.099]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.000]  I like to put it on my hands.
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.242]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[01:44:35.242 --> 01:44:38.065]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes.
[01:44:38.065 --> 01:44:42.469]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[01:44:42.469 --> 01:44:44.271]  So, this is a real innovation.
[01:44:44.271 --> 01:44:50.798]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[01:44:50.798 --> 01:44:52.139]  Smells great.
[01:44:52.139 --> 01:44:53.961]  It's so refreshing.
[01:44:53.961 --> 01:44:54.862]  This is a big winner.
[01:44:58.302 --> 01:45:10.285]  It was only four months ago that I warned President Trump and the American people that Cobra would never stand for you resisting our takeover.
[01:45:10.285 --> 01:45:19.827]  There is no limit to which we will not stoop to make you bow via the fear that is innate in your hearts.
[01:45:19.827 --> 01:45:25.708]  It was I, the leader of Cobra, that foresaw your inner cowardice.
[01:45:26.508 --> 01:45:27.689]  We're good to go.
[01:45:47.896 --> 01:45:48.536]  Bio PQQ.
[01:45:48.536 --> 01:45:49.097]  Research that.
[01:45:49.097 --> 01:45:50.177]  Look into it for yourself.
[01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:52.338]  Big Brother and the Globalists don't want you to.
[01:45:52.338 --> 01:45:52.498]  CoQ10.
[01:45:52.498 --> 01:45:55.379]  Oh, you probably want to spend some time researching CoQ10.
[01:45:55.379 --> 01:45:57.980]  And then research DNA Force Plus and the types.
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:31.681]  This is our best-selling overall formula.
[01:46:31.681 --> 01:46:41.123]  And I told listeners at the end of last year that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup in them to fund our operations.
[01:46:41.123 --> 01:46:52.706]  But because of what's happening and going on in the world right now, I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force Plus to have DNA Force Plus
[01:47:01.175 --> 01:47:08.083]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:08.083 --> 01:47:09.926]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now.
[01:47:09.926 --> 01:47:15.753]  There is no government official here, but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:47:27.179 --> 01:47:30.681]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:47:30.681 --> 01:47:34.103]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:47:34.103 --> 01:47:36.824]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:47:36.824 --> 01:47:37.985]  They came in peace.
[01:47:56.977 --> 01:48:02.899]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[01:48:02.899 --> 01:48:20.425]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[01:48:20.425 --> 01:48:21.806]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:48:21.806 --> 01:48:23.166]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:48:23.166 --> 01:48:24.307]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:48:32.133 --> 01:48:38.216]  This is CNN.
[01:48:38.216 --> 01:48:44.320]  And now they tell you, the UN announced yesterday the economy never opens again.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:46.721]  And you take inoculations and drones watch you.
[01:48:46.721 --> 01:48:50.603]  You've got a medical ID and a chip under the skin.
[01:48:50.603 --> 01:48:52.384]  Ha ha ha!
[01:48:52.384 --> 01:48:56.747]  And all of a sudden the trap clinks shut and you're inside the New World Order.
[01:48:56.747 --> 01:48:58.327]  And again, everybody's freaking out.
[01:48:58.327 --> 01:48:59.728]  I see it all over the internet.
[01:48:59.728 --> 01:49:00.649]  The emails pour in.
[01:49:01.778 --> 01:49:04.360]  It's like, Jones, how did you predict that it's incredible?
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:05.601]  Don't you feel vindicated?
[01:49:05.601 --> 01:49:23.515]  It'd be like if I had binoculars, and I lived in, say, Colorado, and a giant forest fire was over the hill, and I was able to see it, because I had a high house, and I told my neighbors, who I guess weren't watching TV, hey, a big fire's coming, and it'll be here probably about 2 a.m.
[01:49:23.515 --> 01:49:25.096]  You know, it's like 9 p.m.
[01:49:25.096 --> 01:49:25.336]  at night.
[01:49:25.336 --> 01:49:27.017]  They're like, oh, whatever.
[01:49:27.017 --> 01:49:31.161]  And then now the fire's burned everybody's houses down and killed my neighbors.
[01:49:33.413 --> 01:49:40.177]  I'm 20 miles away in the next town, hearing about it, and they're like, are you feeling pretty good right now, man?
[01:49:40.177 --> 01:49:46.121]  You must be walking on clouds right now.
[01:49:46.121 --> 01:49:47.721]  Uh, no.
[01:49:47.721 --> 01:49:50.763]  I am completely freaked out.
[01:49:50.763 --> 01:49:59.328]  Because, you know, I always said I'm doubling down on evil and I'm having children and I'm gonna, we're gonna win this thing.
[01:49:59.328 --> 01:50:01.790]  But for the first time in my life, I'm not guilty, I have children.
[01:50:04.085 --> 01:50:09.850]  It's like, man, I better bust my butt right now to turn this around because, and you better too, because this is bad.
[01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:15.255]  It's exactly the attack pattern we thought they'd launch from the research.
[01:50:15.255 --> 01:50:18.898]  It's their best move.
[01:50:18.898 --> 01:50:28.846]  And then it comes out that it's killing 1 16th of 1% in the LAO numbers.
[01:50:28.846 --> 01:50:30.908]  And let's say that goes up to half a percent or whatever.
[01:50:30.908 --> 01:50:31.929]  That's like a bad flu.
[01:50:33.069 --> 01:50:36.250]  And it's killing what the flu would kill, old people.
[01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:43.071]  This whole thing is insane, and now they're saying the states are all gonna go bankrupt.
[01:50:43.071 --> 01:50:45.291]  Mitch McConnell this.
[01:50:45.291 --> 01:50:46.131]  It's just out of control.
[01:50:46.131 --> 01:50:47.011]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:50:47.011 --> 01:50:49.392]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:50:49.392 --> 01:50:50.532]  That would be Kenny.
[01:50:50.532 --> 01:50:52.272]  Kenny, you're on the air from Ohio.
[01:50:52.272 --> 01:50:54.013]  Welcome, sir.
[01:50:54.013 --> 01:50:57.253]  Hey, happy Earth Day, Alex.
[01:50:57.253 --> 01:50:58.894]  Oh, which means anti-human day?
[01:50:58.894 --> 01:51:00.914]  Yeah, the Pope's saying we all deserve this right now.
[01:51:02.102 --> 01:51:03.383]  Yes, sir.
[01:51:03.383 --> 01:51:05.465]  A couple things here.
[01:51:05.465 --> 01:51:12.610]  One with oil being so low and AOC is happy and, you know, content.
[01:51:12.610 --> 01:51:14.092]  Where do you see this coming?
[01:51:14.092 --> 01:51:16.093]  I mean, are we going to make it back?
[01:51:16.093 --> 01:51:17.434]  Can we come back?
[01:51:17.434 --> 01:51:19.756]  Personally, I don't think we could come back from this.
[01:51:19.756 --> 01:51:21.197]  I think we're done.
[01:51:21.197 --> 01:51:23.259]  But the good news is the Earth is healing.
[01:51:26.377 --> 01:51:27.217]  Well, we're the problem.
[01:51:27.217 --> 01:51:31.839]  You know, humans are bad, we deserve to starve and die, but we gotta lock everything down to save every human.
[01:51:31.839 --> 01:51:35.501]  Even though it's starving, 30 million people are set to die, the UN says.
[01:51:35.501 --> 01:51:39.443]  So they're like, give us more money, they'll keep that, and then make sure everybody dies.
[01:51:39.443 --> 01:51:41.604]  I mean, how sick is that?
[01:51:41.604 --> 01:51:43.225]  But you just said it.
[01:51:43.225 --> 01:51:50.288]  And what's crazy is, the Democrat states and counties and cities are the ones that are gonna go bankrupt, and they love it.
[01:51:51.129 --> 01:51:55.911]  They love the needles, the feces, the collapsing, because they think there's always another bailout coming.
[01:51:55.911 --> 01:52:03.254]  What's going to happen when the average schnot nose leftist learns the lockdown never ends and they never get a bailout?
[01:52:03.254 --> 01:52:04.855]  They'll never learn.
[01:52:04.855 --> 01:52:10.277]  We see that happening every day with people being brainwashed by what's going on with this virus right now.
[01:52:10.277 --> 01:52:11.618]  Everybody's scared.
[01:52:11.618 --> 01:52:15.220]  People are keeping themselves locked down, wearing their nice little masks.
[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:20.642]  But yet, meanwhile, doctors and nurses are on TikTok dancing, having good times in hospitals.
[01:52:21.502 --> 01:52:22.222]  I don't think it's right.
[01:52:39.113 --> 01:52:42.616]  And my wife's reading me these text messages, and I'm just like, this is ridiculous.
[01:52:42.616 --> 01:52:50.181]  Then I talked to some other family that works in a big hospital, and he's a doctor, and he was just like, no, it's like Animal House.
[01:52:50.181 --> 01:52:54.244]  I said, yes, drinking, partying, the nurses and the doctors are, you know.
[01:52:55.264 --> 01:52:58.846]  One of the most, let's just say, loose groups is doctors and nurses.
[01:52:58.846 --> 01:53:00.967]  It's like a, talk about a porn movie, folks.
[01:53:00.967 --> 01:53:03.748]  People know about medical stuff, that's what goes on in these hospitals.
[01:53:03.748 --> 01:53:06.730]  And so, it is just party time.
[01:53:06.730 --> 01:53:10.832]  And it's like, oh, they're so tough, they're so incredible.
[01:53:10.832 --> 01:53:15.594]  Most of these hospitals are doing elective surgeries, and it's still a tough job when you've got a lot of work to do.
[01:53:15.594 --> 01:53:17.475]  They're all happy because there's nobody in there.
[01:53:18.135 --> 01:53:21.776]  I mean, it's just the hoax of hoaxes.
[01:53:21.776 --> 01:53:26.538]  But that's why the medical workers are coming out saying to the people, saying, open things up, going, how dare you?
[01:53:26.538 --> 01:53:28.239]  We're not opening up.
[01:53:28.239 --> 01:53:30.240]  There's a party going down inside.
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:32.781]  If the house is a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.
[01:53:32.781 --> 01:53:34.721]  Come on in.
[01:53:34.721 --> 01:53:35.482]  God bless you, sir.
[01:53:35.482 --> 01:53:39.043]  I appreciate your call, Kenny.
[01:53:39.043 --> 01:53:41.404]  Who's up next here?
[01:53:41.404 --> 01:53:43.064]  Trish in Michigan.
[01:53:43.064 --> 01:53:45.165]  Trish, welcome to the airwaves.
[01:53:45.165 --> 01:53:46.826]  Hello, can you hear me okay, Alex?
[01:53:46.826 --> 01:53:47.166]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:53:47.987 --> 01:53:48.447]  Wow.
[01:53:48.447 --> 01:53:51.870]  Well, I would just like to say I'm glad to be part of this war we're in.
[01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:53.672]  We're in a spiritual war for sure.
[01:53:53.672 --> 01:53:57.655]  And I buy many of your products, love them.
[01:53:57.655 --> 01:54:01.198]  I even stocked up on some, have some storable food.
[01:54:01.198 --> 01:54:05.441]  And when it comes time to crack into them, it's not going to matter how good or how bad they are.
[01:54:05.441 --> 01:54:06.863]  It's better than nothing.
[01:54:06.863 --> 01:54:08.264]  And I have the Alexa Pure
[01:54:09.699 --> 01:54:12.881]  Let me just interrupt you because that's my famous mainstay and I apologize.
[01:54:12.881 --> 01:54:20.384]  Yeah, it's about getting in the mindset of a garden, the mindset of getting together with family and having five acres in the middle of nowhere that's cheap.
[01:54:20.384 --> 01:54:23.745]  We've got to start realizing it's probably all going to go down.
[01:54:23.745 --> 01:54:24.726]  If not now, later.
[01:54:24.726 --> 01:54:31.629]  Their goal is to collapse it on purpose and they're collapsing the poor third world and no one's even talking about these people.
[01:54:31.969 --> 01:54:33.790]  I mean, this is scary, man!
[01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:34.930]  If they can kill them!
[01:54:34.930 --> 01:54:36.471]  You know, we have empathy.
[01:54:36.471 --> 01:54:39.933]  It's programmed into us where we feel, and we feel like we care about them.
[01:54:39.933 --> 01:54:42.314]  But that's because it could be us next.
[01:54:42.314 --> 01:54:42.994]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:54:45.532 --> 01:54:50.674]  I would like to say thank you for being steadfast in the faith and for standing up for the truth.
[01:54:50.674 --> 01:54:55.677]  And since you are worldwide, I would like to just profess that Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior.
[01:54:55.677 --> 01:54:59.379]  And hopefully I can give you a couple of scriptures for encouragement.
[01:54:59.379 --> 01:54:59.639]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:54:59.639 --> 01:55:01.660]  Please, please, please prophesy for us.
[01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:02.180]  Tell us.
[01:55:03.123 --> 01:55:07.205]  Well, in the Book of Matthew, Chapter 5, it says, And there's another one.
[01:55:07.205 --> 01:55:08.906]  We're letting our light shine, Alex.
[01:55:33.147 --> 01:55:43.655]  And it's, this is another one in Matthew, uh, let your light so shine before men that they too may see your good works and glorify your father which art in heaven.
[01:55:43.655 --> 01:55:48.379]  And just through reading in scripture, and I was raised in a church, and I'm just so thankful for that foundation.
[01:55:48.379 --> 01:55:50.781]  By the way, Trish, I want you to be able to finish up and think about that.
[01:55:51.991 --> 01:55:57.515]  People that really have God, not the fake demon churches and all the rest of it, but people that really have God in them, have a light coming out of them.
[01:55:57.515 --> 01:55:58.656]  People see it.
[01:55:58.656 --> 01:56:00.877]  Those that don't have no light.
[01:56:00.877 --> 01:56:03.039]  And the Bible's saying, you gotta let that light shine.
[01:56:03.039 --> 01:56:04.620]  Right.
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:11.865]  And I kind of done a parallel, you kind of remind me, think of this, when they used to look at John the Baptist back in the day, oh, that crazy man out in the wilderness.
[01:56:11.865 --> 01:56:19.390]  Well, you might get a lot of slack from people, but just remember, you might be the crazy man out in the wilderness preaching, but you're standing for the truth.
[01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:21.692]  And I appreciate you doing that.
[01:56:21.852 --> 01:56:29.436]  Well, I don't want to compare myself to John the Baptist that got his head cut off, but I always thought my job was to get people awake for the big move that was coming down against us.
[01:56:29.436 --> 01:56:35.439]  And yeah, he was out wearing, you know, wearing buckskin and hairy and yelled and screamed at people.
[01:56:35.439 --> 01:56:38.101]  And, you know, somebody started a fight with him, he kicked their ass.
[01:56:38.101 --> 01:56:39.301]  So, yeah, exactly.
[01:56:39.301 --> 01:56:47.326]  Modern world teaches that Christians are these little wimps that roll over, but that's not what really happened with Christians and people of God.
[01:56:48.306 --> 01:56:54.951]  Jesus was super tough, obviously, and he did beat up the money changers because they were satanic.
[01:56:54.951 --> 01:56:59.455]  But he was there to show people the real strength of being able to be the sacrifice.
[01:56:59.455 --> 01:57:01.256]  And so, that was his role.
[01:57:01.256 --> 01:57:05.079]  People didn't see that as wimpy, because it's the opposite of being a wimp.
[01:57:05.079 --> 01:57:10.183]  It's very strong to turn yourself over, to be tortured to death for the people, and to take on their sins.
[01:57:10.183 --> 01:57:14.106]  Because if you think being tortured to death was bad, it says Christ took on all the sin that had happened,
[01:57:14.546 --> 01:57:18.750]  The current sin and all sin to come, meaning he experienced it.
[01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:31.961]  Every child being raped, every person being killed, every form of Satanism, every sin ever, God literally took it on to transmute it so that God could take us into him, even though he's perfect, he had to take it on.
[01:57:31.961 --> 01:57:33.523]  And you read that when you're little, it doesn't make sense.
[01:57:33.523 --> 01:57:35.604]  Now it makes total sense, the ultimate ritual.
[01:57:36.425 --> 01:57:40.087]  The creator of the universe projected down into a single body.
[01:57:40.087 --> 01:57:40.788]  Hold on, Trace.
[01:57:40.788 --> 01:57:41.208]  Don't hang up.
[01:57:41.208 --> 01:57:42.849]  I want you to be able to finish up when we come back.
[01:57:42.849 --> 01:57:43.770]  Hour number three.
[01:57:43.770 --> 01:57:47.232]  More calls and a ton of news straight ahead.
[01:57:47.232 --> 01:57:54.736]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[01:57:54.736 --> 01:58:00.900]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.361]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[01:58:02.581 --> 01:58:05.244]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:08.747]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[01:58:08.747 --> 01:58:18.015]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[01:58:18.015 --> 01:58:18.916]  Let me tell you something, man.
[01:58:19.056 --> 01:58:25.877]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[01:58:25.877 --> 01:58:27.358]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[01:58:27.358 --> 01:58:31.339]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[01:58:31.339 --> 01:58:33.539]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[01:58:33.539 --> 01:58:36.540]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritions because they don't want you to have it.
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:38.420]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:38.960]  I got it.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.201]  I hid it from the nurses.
[01:58:40.201 --> 01:58:41.221]  I started taking it.
[01:58:41.221 --> 01:58:43.281]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[01:58:43.281 --> 01:58:44.201]  It saved my life.
[01:58:44.201 --> 01:58:46.922]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[01:58:48.373 --> 01:58:52.037]  Look, the globalists are satanists, alright?
[01:58:52.037 --> 01:58:58.824]  Lawrence Rothschild recently posed at a gallery of art worshipping the devil and praising Lucifer.
[01:58:59.724 --> 01:59:01.365]  You cannot make this up.
[01:59:01.365 --> 01:59:02.946]  They flaunt it in our face.
[01:59:02.946 --> 01:59:04.287]  That's what environmentalism is.
[01:59:04.287 --> 01:59:09.950]  It's about having an anti-human future and having people live in a subsistence, feudal, serf state.
[01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:11.211]  That's what they want.
[01:59:11.211 --> 01:59:16.854]  These people that have stolen the planet and are worth trillions of dollars do not want you having a good life.
[01:59:16.854 --> 01:59:18.555]  They know you're having fun.
[01:59:18.555 --> 01:59:21.397]  They know you have a great wife, a great husband, great children.
[01:59:21.397 --> 01:59:22.698]  They hate your guts.
[01:59:22.698 --> 01:59:26.100]  They are the most horrible, evil people on the planet.
[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:27.701]  They openly fund racism.
[01:59:28.161 --> 01:59:29.903]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:09.935 --> 02:00:14.837]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:14.837 --> 02:00:20.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:32.306]  Alright Trish, we're getting into your connection to God and the God of the Bible that predicted all of this.
[02:00:32.306 --> 02:00:33.106]  It's amazing.
[02:00:33.106 --> 02:00:34.447]  Go ahead and finish your points.
[02:00:35.074 --> 02:00:42.321]  I would just like to say that I am praying for you, Alex, and all the crew, that everything that you do, truly, this is a spiritual war.
[02:00:42.321 --> 02:00:49.888]  And like Jesus says in John 14, 6, Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[02:00:49.888 --> 02:00:51.970]  No man cometh to the Father but by me.
[02:00:51.970 --> 02:00:56.955]  There is no way to heaven but through the bridge that Jesus did for us and paid our sin debt.
[02:00:58.973 --> 02:01:05.056]  The caller, when they screen the call, I'm in Michigan here with this lovely Whittler as our governor.
[02:01:05.056 --> 02:01:06.116]  I signed the petition.
[02:01:06.116 --> 02:01:14.180]  I did buy some storable seats too, by the way, from the store there.
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:19.282]  I work in a food warehouse and my son also, Tate, works in the warehouse as well.
[02:01:21.716 --> 02:01:28.899]  It's just amazing to see how thin the supply chain is getting, because the trucks we do get come in, the stuff goes right out.
[02:01:28.899 --> 02:01:34.341]  And I am very thankful to have a job, and hey, everybody out there worldwide, everybody's essential.
[02:01:34.341 --> 02:01:45.305]  But you're seeing, when I tell people that we're talking to big food companies, and they're all running out, and all getting low, and then now things are breaking down, and there's a depression, which is already starting, it's going to be devastating.
[02:01:45.305 --> 02:01:50.767]  All these folks that are getting into this shutdown, they're going to get a little taste of what the third world's getting right now.
[02:01:51.738 --> 02:01:54.619]  Yeah, that's the scary part.
[02:01:54.619 --> 02:01:57.159]  My heart goes out to all those people.
[02:01:57.159 --> 02:01:58.080]  Actually, you know what, though?
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:03.961]  This country, we've been so blessed for so long, and it's like, I look at my people for what's on my plate.
[02:02:03.961 --> 02:02:12.703]  By the way, can you believe that literally what a book 2,000 years ago said is now unfolding?
[02:02:12.703 --> 02:02:19.545]  And I was talking to an atheist, they go, well, people just took the idea of the Mark of the Beast and are manifesting it because it's a way to control people.
[02:02:19.545 --> 02:02:19.825]  And I go,
[02:02:21.457 --> 02:02:21.797]  Really?
[02:02:21.797 --> 02:02:22.778]  You think that's what it is?
[02:02:22.778 --> 02:02:22.978]  Really?
[02:02:22.978 --> 02:02:23.698]  You think so?
[02:02:23.698 --> 02:02:24.899]  No.
[02:02:24.899 --> 02:02:42.626]  Those people have never had the spiritual experiences those of us have had, and I won't get into those, but I've literally had hundreds of dreams that come exactly true that I tell people about, and other stuff I won't even get into air because they'll use it against me, but those of us that have experienced it, they can see past the veil, have
[02:02:44.247 --> 02:02:45.548]  And it's not something I even want to do.
[02:02:45.548 --> 02:02:50.513]  It's it's pretty horrific stuff, folks, because there's a lot of noise in the universe.
[02:02:50.513 --> 02:02:54.256]  And let me just tell you, most of it's bad stuff down at this level.
[02:02:54.256 --> 02:02:56.117]  But it's an amazing time.
[02:02:56.117 --> 02:02:57.799]  Anything else, Trish?
[02:02:57.799 --> 02:03:01.282]  I would just like to say thank you to all the truck drivers out there.
[02:03:01.282 --> 02:03:04.585]  My dad was a truck driver and my husband was a truck driver.
[02:03:04.585 --> 02:03:08.108]  My dad passed away actually this year, which my dad was a comedian.
[02:03:08.752 --> 02:03:10.614]  And he passed away on February 29th.
[02:03:10.614 --> 02:03:13.597]  Of course, this was before they were doing any kind of testing.
[02:03:13.597 --> 02:03:14.918]  Sorry, I'm choking up a little bit.
[02:03:14.918 --> 02:03:20.364]  But he's in a much better place, and I don't have to worry about what we're going through now.
[02:03:20.364 --> 02:03:22.966]  Well, his spirit's 100% real.
[02:03:22.966 --> 02:03:29.273]  Your father is 100%, a trillion percent more powerful than he ever was if he was right with God.
[02:03:29.273 --> 02:03:29.473]  Right.
[02:03:30.572 --> 02:03:41.560]  But anyways, I just want to let you know that I'm praying for everybody there in the country here that, you know, because as we see the day approaching, we're to draw closer to the Lord, and He will draw closer to us.
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:42.560]  Just stay strong, Alex.
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:44.562]  And by the way, I said I would cover this earlier.
[02:03:44.562 --> 02:03:46.663]  I didn't get to it.
[02:03:46.663 --> 02:03:58.511]  But if you go to InfoWars.com or Banned.Video, we have articles about Mark of the Beast and the digital Mark, and you have to have his divine cell, and the fake Christians are just savaging in there, going, no,
[02:03:59.754 --> 02:04:03.296]  The rapture has to happen first.
[02:04:03.296 --> 02:04:06.138]  You're of the devil warning people against this.
[02:04:06.138 --> 02:04:09.459]  And the barcode 666, it's all precursors of that.
[02:04:09.459 --> 02:04:10.980]  There are many antichrists.
[02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:14.222]  And then now this code is 666 in the patent.
[02:04:14.222 --> 02:04:15.463]  And it's world government.
[02:04:15.463 --> 02:04:15.943]  It's evil.
[02:04:17.392 --> 02:04:25.961]  It's taking control and it's the fake Christians saying, I'm bad because they are scared and they don't want to stand against the beast.
[02:04:25.961 --> 02:04:29.665]  Well, God's going to say, I don't know you when they stand before God.
[02:04:29.665 --> 02:04:31.707]  So, God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[02:04:32.728 --> 02:04:37.650]  By the way, if you think there's a pre-tribulation rapture, I hope you're right, okay?
[02:04:37.650 --> 02:04:40.971]  Don't get so viciously mad at me when I've actually read Revelation.
[02:04:40.971 --> 02:04:47.094]  It says he wages war against the saints, overcomes them, then after the battle of Armageddon, the dead in Christ are risen.
[02:04:47.094 --> 02:04:48.975]  That is the resurrection.
[02:04:48.975 --> 02:04:52.036]  And you are about to find out very soon how wrong you are.
[02:04:52.036 --> 02:04:56.658]  You will face Satan.
[02:04:56.658 --> 02:04:59.899]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor.
[02:04:59.899 --> 02:05:01.440]  But I still need my morning coffee.
[02:05:02.819 --> 02:05:12.228]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:05:12.228 --> 02:05:23.879]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[02:05:23.879 --> 02:05:28.062]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[02:05:28.963 --> 02:05:33.004]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[02:05:33.004 --> 02:05:39.906]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[02:05:39.906 --> 02:05:42.826]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[02:05:42.826 --> 02:05:52.509]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:09.588 --> 02:06:13.210]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:06:13.210 --> 02:06:15.071]  Run on for a long time.
[02:06:15.071 --> 02:06:22.595]  Alright, Andrew Torba of Gab is joining us for a couple of segments and I'll continue with the calls into the next hour and then David Knight's going to be joining us.
[02:06:22.595 --> 02:06:27.237]  But we have massive news next segment with Torba.
[02:06:27.237 --> 02:06:30.519]  The Attorney General, looks like Barr more and more is real.
[02:06:30.519 --> 02:06:35.441]  It would take hours to go into how he keeps doing the right thing, he keeps saying the right thing.
[02:06:35.441 --> 02:06:36.782]  Trump, trust him, I trust Trump.
[02:06:38.015 --> 02:06:42.739]  Bar call stay-at-home orders, house arrest.
[02:06:42.739 --> 02:06:44.541]  So we're going to play that next segment.
[02:06:44.541 --> 02:06:46.663]  We'll have that audio and video for you.
[02:06:46.663 --> 02:06:47.484]  Unbelievable.
[02:06:47.484 --> 02:06:53.169]  And we'll continue with your phone calls, EJ and everybody else that's holding.
[02:06:53.169 --> 02:06:56.872]  Now this video is like a 15-minute report or so.
[02:06:56.872 --> 02:06:59.335]  It's going up on Bandot Video in the next few minutes.
[02:06:59.335 --> 02:07:00.556]  It'll be on Infowars.com.
[02:07:00.556 --> 02:07:01.316]  It needs to be shared.
[02:07:02.222 --> 02:07:12.931]  The V Series, nine years ago, the remake, totally predicted the medical tyranny, Bill and Melinda Gates, vaccines that are tainted with tracking chips to buy and sell.
[02:07:12.931 --> 02:07:24.139]  So in a fictitious alien takeover, this is the worst the writers could come up with, and it turns out it's what actually the Rockefeller Foundation in 2010 wrote about.
[02:07:24.139 --> 02:07:25.801]  So it's predictive programming.
[02:07:25.801 --> 02:07:27.542]  The Simpsons also predicted it.
[02:07:27.542 --> 02:07:28.463]  Here's part of that report.
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:33.205]  Though unlike you, we don't divide ourselves into countries.
[02:07:33.205 --> 02:07:35.248]  We're one united people.
[02:07:35.248 --> 02:07:39.293]  This is a day I've been looking forward to for a long time.
[02:07:39.293 --> 02:07:43.500]  We're honored and privileged to be able to assist mankind with our knowledge and technology.
[02:07:44.292 --> 02:07:46.714]  The visitors didn't just get here.
[02:07:46.714 --> 02:07:49.537]  They've been here for years, for decades.
[02:07:49.537 --> 02:07:56.423]  They've been implementing a plan that will result in the extermination of every man, woman, and child on the face of this earth.
[02:07:56.423 --> 02:08:02.248]  Behind closed doors on this New York campus, a secret gathering of some of the world's most powerful people.
[02:08:02.628 --> 02:08:09.994]  Gates, Buffett, Bloomberg, Winfrey, together with others at the meeting, including George Soros, Ted Turner, David Rockefeller.
[02:08:09.994 --> 02:08:16.299]  That much money, that much power around one table, it begs the question, what were they doing?
[02:08:16.299 --> 02:08:17.800]  What were they scheming?
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:20.983]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[02:08:20.983 --> 02:08:22.604]  But let's take a look.
[02:08:22.604 --> 02:08:29.690]  These posing as humans established themselves in all facets of life, whether it be business, government,
[02:08:30.510 --> 02:08:31.391]  Religion?
[02:08:31.391 --> 02:08:32.773]  The military?
[02:08:32.773 --> 02:08:34.956]  It took years.
[02:08:34.956 --> 02:08:39.121]  And what's embedded among us they set out to cause worldwide instability.
[02:08:39.121 --> 02:08:41.123]  A new world order.
[02:08:41.123 --> 02:08:41.604]  Cannibalism.
[02:08:41.604 --> 02:08:44.107]  Unnecessary wars.
[02:08:44.107 --> 02:08:46.029]  Economic meltdown.
[02:08:46.029 --> 02:08:48.593]  Faith twisted into extremism.
[02:08:49.432 --> 02:08:52.334]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:08:52.334 --> 02:08:55.656]  Tonight we're announcing the expansion of our healing centers.
[02:08:55.656 --> 02:08:59.338]  The goal is to open one in every major city across the world.
[02:08:59.338 --> 02:09:04.341]  We want to provide complete medical services to all.
[02:09:04.341 --> 02:09:07.623]  You're talking about universal health care.
[02:09:07.623 --> 02:09:10.585]  The idea of a Medicare for all.
[02:09:10.585 --> 02:09:13.106]  But that's called the death panel.
[02:09:13.106 --> 02:09:14.407]  I believe that's what you call it, yes.
[02:09:15.356 --> 02:09:26.386]  They gain trust with the promise of friendship and technology and of course all they're really doing is positioning themselves as the saviors of mankind.
[02:09:26.386 --> 02:09:29.989]  You've agreed that you're going to spend more than a hundred million dollars on this.
[02:09:29.989 --> 02:09:31.330]  Where is that money being spent?
[02:09:32.176 --> 02:09:36.378]  You warned everybody about this in a TED Talk in 2015.
[02:09:36.378 --> 02:09:38.138]  You predicted this would happen.
[02:09:38.138 --> 02:09:48.482]  If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war.
[02:09:48.482 --> 02:09:51.744]  We also have ambitious goals for getting vaccine coverage up.
[02:09:51.744 --> 02:09:55.005]  How do you see us acclimating back into a normal life?
[02:09:55.726 --> 02:09:58.448]  When we don't have the cure for this.
[02:09:58.448 --> 02:10:03.271]  And of course all they're really doing is positioning themselves as the saviors.
[02:10:03.271 --> 02:10:08.034]  They won't be back to normal until we either have that phenomenal vaccine.
[02:10:08.034 --> 02:10:13.637]  Is that the vitamin shot?
[02:10:13.637 --> 02:10:14.738]  No.
[02:10:14.738 --> 02:10:15.999]  It's the flu vaccine.
[02:10:15.999 --> 02:10:18.160]  What, human vaccine?
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:20.302]  They're not mixing their drug into the vitamin shot.
[02:10:20.302 --> 02:10:22.203]  They're mixing it into our flu vaccine.
[02:10:25.299 --> 02:10:26.760]  Ship at least tomorrow.
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:45.854]  There's an approach called the RNA vaccine that people like Moderna, CureVac and others are using that in 2015 we'd identified that as very promising for pandemics and for other applications as well.
[02:10:45.854 --> 02:10:49.237]  And for other applications as well.
[02:10:54.818 --> 02:10:54.938]  R6.
[02:10:54.938 --> 02:10:56.598]  What the hell is R6?
[02:10:56.598 --> 02:10:58.379]  It's what they put in the vitamin shot.
[02:10:58.379 --> 02:11:00.639]  They experimented on people.
[02:11:00.639 --> 02:11:05.880]  Examination of the R6 using human technology revealed nothing more than a simple saline shot.
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:09.941]  But when I used R equipment, I found something quite different.
[02:11:09.941 --> 02:11:14.162]  R6 has a molecular compound that embeds itself in human DNA.
[02:11:14.162 --> 02:11:17.762]  It interacts with the human genome, then emits a wavelength of sorts.
[02:11:17.762 --> 02:11:19.743]  This vaccine actually does that.
[02:11:19.743 --> 02:11:22.223]  It's attacking humans like animals in the wild.
[02:11:24.636 --> 02:11:34.107]  Eventually what we'll have to have is certificates of who's a recovered person, who's a vaccinated person, because you don't want people moving around the world.
[02:11:34.107 --> 02:11:43.017]  Is Bill Gates working with ID2020, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Accenture, Microsoft, the United Nations, and many, many others to create a new digital identity?
[02:11:43.357 --> 02:12:05.907]  Which includes the use of biometrics, blockchain, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence that will not only serve as a digital certificate of vaccination, but will also include all of your medical records, all of your financials, every form of identification including your passports, your driver's licenses, your online accounts, virtually every aspect of your life linked to you both on and offline.
[02:12:06.207 --> 02:12:16.750]  MIT, under funding of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has developed a quantum dot ink implant that can be monitored by a smartphone.
[02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:27.774]  So eventually there will be sort of this digital immunity proof that will help facilitate the global reopening.
[02:12:28.772 --> 02:12:42.882]  And in 2020, World Patent Number 060606 was published by Microsoft Technology, titled Cryptocurrency System Using Body Activity Data.
[02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:56.334]  It outlines a technology wherein human body activity associated with a task provided to a user may be used in a mining process of a cryptocurrency system.
[02:12:56.334 --> 02:13:07.859]  The human is given an activity to accomplish, which is sent from a body sensor to the cloud and to the cryptocurrency system, rewarding the human with money.
[02:13:07.859 --> 02:13:10.200]  So she's tagging humans like animals in the wild.
[02:13:13.205 --> 02:13:20.627]  They did everything from here.
[02:13:20.627 --> 02:13:24.628]  Tested it on humans, packaged it to look like the flu shot.
[02:13:24.628 --> 02:13:28.729]  When this shit mingles with the real shots, no one will be able to tell the difference.
[02:13:28.729 --> 02:13:33.450]  No government agency is going to be worrying about a flu vaccine where they got to feed vitamin to evaluate.
[02:13:33.450 --> 02:13:35.911]  Which in all likelihood is nothing more than a vitamin shot.
[02:13:37.130 --> 02:13:40.552]  They know exactly how to play us.
[02:13:40.552 --> 02:13:44.275]  The media bombards us with stories of epidemics, pandemics.
[02:13:44.275 --> 02:13:46.677]  So we run out, we get a shot to protect ourselves.
[02:13:46.677 --> 02:13:50.479]  That's what the V's are counting on, our predictability.
[02:13:50.479 --> 02:13:56.163]  So you can avoid lots of diseases if you've been properly vaccinated.
[02:13:56.163 --> 02:14:06.751]  And how you get a vaccine that making seven billion of those is going to be an incredible challenge.
[02:14:07.031 --> 02:14:11.335]  This is a day I've been looking forward to for a long time.
[02:14:11.335 --> 02:14:23.546]  A lot of us here have been talking over the months ahead, trying to make sure that we get everyone to show up and do absolutely the best they can for vaccination.
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:40.123]  With an added addendum is going live at Band.Video as we speak and InfoWars.com.
[02:14:40.123 --> 02:14:44.386]  Are you going to warn people?
[02:14:44.386 --> 02:14:46.587]  Now, I'll say that again.
[02:14:46.587 --> 02:14:50.370]  There's a big article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:14:50.370 --> 02:14:51.690]  Are you going to get it out to people?
[02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:52.571]  I'm not bitching at you.
[02:14:52.571 --> 02:14:54.292]  I'm saying you want to lose?
[02:14:54.292 --> 02:14:58.655]  Because now you know this show isn't just something I made up.
[02:14:58.655 --> 02:15:01.156]  I'm covering their battle plan.
[02:15:01.156 --> 02:15:03.778]  You know how frustrating it is to watch them publicly plan all this?
[02:15:04.946 --> 02:15:07.968]  And then to see humanity caught flat-footed?
[02:15:07.968 --> 02:15:09.509]  What am I talking about?
[02:15:09.509 --> 02:15:14.732]  I'm talking about John Roberts coming out and saying, L.A.
[02:15:14.732 --> 02:15:19.935]  County coronavirus study shows it kills 0.16 or 16% of 1%.
[02:15:19.935 --> 02:15:22.117]  It's even lower than that.
[02:15:22.117 --> 02:15:22.717]  That's not even 1%.
[02:15:31.421 --> 02:15:33.685]  663 people have died who were infected with coronavirus.
[02:15:33.685 --> 02:15:35.147]  Most of them died of other causes.
[02:15:35.147 --> 02:15:36.730]  If you believe that number, you put it into 400,000, you get 0.16574999.
[02:15:36.730 --> 02:15:38.232]  Not even a fraction of 1%.
[02:15:46.369 --> 02:15:49.190]  And those numbers are coming out everywhere.
[02:15:49.190 --> 02:15:53.471]  But you're told the Great Depression's good and 30 million starving to death is good.
[02:15:53.471 --> 02:15:55.012]  You're told to submit and wear your mask.
[02:15:55.012 --> 02:15:59.573]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:15:59.573 --> 02:16:01.654]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:16:01.654 --> 02:16:02.994]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:16:03.394 --> 02:16:09.943]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:16:09.943 --> 02:16:15.030]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:19.737]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:16:20.157 --> 02:16:23.279]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:16:23.279 --> 02:16:30.282]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:16:30.282 --> 02:16:35.464]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:16:35.464 --> 02:16:38.766]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:16:38.766 --> 02:16:39.726]  Get clean.

[02:18:09.051 --> 02:18:10.592]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:18:10.592 --> 02:18:12.132]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:18:12.132 --> 02:18:13.513]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:18:13.513 --> 02:18:15.534]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:18:15.534 --> 02:18:16.835]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:18:16.835 --> 02:18:17.775]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:18:35.263 --> 02:18:38.724]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[02:18:38.724 --> 02:18:41.785]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[02:18:41.785 --> 02:18:43.585]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139 is the InfoWars Store Online.
[02:18:43.585 --> 02:18:44.726]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:56.329 --> 02:18:58.170]  How do you put people under house arrest?
[02:18:58.170 --> 02:19:00.171]  How do you put them under siege?
[02:19:00.171 --> 02:19:13.880]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist Deep State and then had China release to then take down the populist president and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:16.021]  Bill Maher even admitted it.
[02:19:16.021 --> 02:19:17.882]  Man, I hope we have a depression.
[02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:33.213]  And now they've tailored the whole thing with the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed, along with the help of the blue states, all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[02:19:33.213 --> 02:19:36.235]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us.
[02:19:36.235 --> 02:19:39.617]  But as for me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it.
[02:19:39.617 --> 02:19:43.760]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody safe.
[02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:46.122]  But that's not what they're doing.
[02:19:46.122 --> 02:19:59.517]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole world, and committing millions of third world people to death.
[02:19:59.517 --> 02:20:02.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:13.463 --> 02:20:22.347]  I know you can see me, now here's a surprise.
[02:20:22.347 --> 02:20:29.190]  I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise.
[02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:30.091]  We are back live.
[02:20:30.091 --> 02:20:32.492]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[02:20:32.492 --> 02:20:34.012]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[02:20:34.012 --> 02:20:35.753]  A bunch of special reports I haven't gotten to.
[02:20:35.753 --> 02:20:37.394]  David Knight joins us in the fourth hour.
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:40.901]  The huge news has come out.
[02:20:40.901 --> 02:20:41.081]  L.A.
[02:20:41.081 --> 02:20:55.106]  County says 400,000-plus cases they project from the testing, the statistics they have, and that that is 0.16 deaths, or a fraction of 1%.
[02:20:55.106 --> 02:20:57.888]  So as the testing increases, we find this out.
[02:20:57.888 --> 02:21:02.629]  But regardless, Texans fined $4,000 for violating COVID-19 curfew.
[02:21:02.629 --> 02:21:04.230]  Each member of the family in the car, $12,000!
[02:21:09.201 --> 02:21:13.565]  So it's happening all over the country, the disgusting out-of-control power grabs.
[02:21:13.565 --> 02:21:20.512]  But the good news is, as we go to Andrew Torba, founder of Gab, people are fighting back.
[02:21:20.512 --> 02:21:33.764]  And so to the Attorney General's credit, he has come out and said that it sounds a lot like house arrest to him, these lockdown orders telling you you're not essential, stay in your house.
[02:21:33.764 --> 02:21:34.105]  Here it is.
[02:21:35.646 --> 02:21:40.528]  The idea that you have to stay in your house is disturbingly close to house arrest.
[02:21:40.528 --> 02:21:42.129]  I'm not saying it wasn't justified.
[02:21:42.129 --> 02:21:45.190]  I'm not saying in some places it might be still justified.
[02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:48.731]  But it's very onerous, as is shutting down your livelihood.
[02:21:48.731 --> 02:21:54.414]  So, these are very, very burdensome impingements on liberty.
[02:21:54.414 --> 02:21:55.454]  And he adopted them.
[02:21:56.324 --> 02:22:07.909]  We have to remember, for the limited purpose of slowing down the spread, that is bending the curve, we didn't adopt them as the comprehensive way of dealing with this disease.
[02:22:07.909 --> 02:22:16.013]  And we have now seen that these are bending the curve and now we have to come up with more targeted approaches.
[02:22:16.013 --> 02:22:21.896]  I mean, this is a little bit like, you know, fighting a cancer, which is, you know, sometimes cancer is spreading.
[02:22:22.945 --> 02:22:33.832]  And one of the treatments you can use is chemotherapy to drive it back and localize it and make it more susceptible to surgery or more targeted thing like radiation or even immunotherapy.
[02:22:33.832 --> 02:22:38.575]  But your first thing is to drive it back to a more manageable state.
[02:22:38.575 --> 02:22:40.876]  And that's what we're doing and have done.
[02:22:40.876 --> 02:22:49.462]  And the question is, you can't just keep on feeding the patient chemotherapy and say, well, we're killing the cancer because we're getting to the point where we're killing the patient.
[02:22:50.302 --> 02:22:52.583]  And now is the time that we have to start looking ahead.
[02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:13.294]  It's Trump's fault, and they can name any common cold as coronavirus and then count that old person that dies as that.
[02:23:13.294 --> 02:23:14.014]  It's an incredible time.
[02:23:14.014 --> 02:23:17.676]  I wanted to get Andrew Torbaugh on a few weeks ago, but he's on with us now.
[02:23:17.676 --> 02:23:23.700]  And wow, we've got Facebook going around saying if you protest the lockdown, they'll ban you.
[02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:25.521]  They've just expanded it to everybody.
[02:23:25.521 --> 02:23:30.163]  Twitter's censoring the President of Brazil and the President of the United States.
[02:23:30.163 --> 02:23:32.585]  But Gab's launched really great things like
[02:23:33.385 --> 02:23:35.449]  You know, video conferencing and so much more.
[02:23:35.449 --> 02:23:38.695]  So, thecenter.com as well and gab.com.
[02:23:38.695 --> 02:23:43.343]  Andrew, great to know there's a few outposts out there of freedom other than InfoWars.
[02:23:43.343 --> 02:23:44.064]  Good to have you on with us.
[02:23:45.444 --> 02:23:47.145]  Great to be here as always, Alex.
[02:23:47.145 --> 02:23:49.246]  There's a lot going on, obviously, in the world.
[02:23:49.246 --> 02:23:52.067]  Things have changed, but I'm optimistic.
[02:23:52.067 --> 02:23:53.148]  Gab is growing.
[02:23:53.148 --> 02:23:54.568]  I'm growing closer with God.
[02:23:54.568 --> 02:23:58.250]  I'm growing closer with my family, spending time with my wife and daughter.
[02:23:58.250 --> 02:24:00.391]  So I'm trying to be optimistic through all of this.
[02:24:00.391 --> 02:24:06.834]  And I'm knowing that our team is working very hard to build the viable alternative ecosystem.
[02:24:06.834 --> 02:24:10.396]  You know, we started out as a Twitter alternative, but we've become so much more.
[02:24:10.396 --> 02:24:12.237]  We now have a web browser.
[02:24:12.237 --> 02:24:13.658]  We have a news source.
[02:24:13.658 --> 02:24:13.998]  We have
[02:24:14.618 --> 02:24:18.200]  A video conferencing alternative to Zoom launching next week.
[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:23.242]  So we've been building like crazy and they tried to take us out just like they tried to take you out.
[02:24:23.242 --> 02:24:27.324]  And yet we've both only grown stronger over the past year or two, which is incredible.
[02:24:27.324 --> 02:24:30.606]  And thanks to the support of people who are watching the show.
[02:24:30.606 --> 02:24:33.427]  I was about to say, it's 100% because we took action and are willing to do it.
[02:24:33.427 --> 02:24:37.189]  But the listeners and supporters and users, they are everything.
[02:24:38.892 --> 02:24:40.073]  Absolutely, without a doubt.
[02:24:40.073 --> 02:24:42.575]  I mean, we see crazy stuff happening right now.
[02:24:42.575 --> 02:24:44.377]  And, you know, I saw all this coming.
[02:24:44.377 --> 02:24:50.942]  I was living and working in Silicon Valley, working directly with these companies, know a lot of the folks that work at these companies.
[02:24:50.942 --> 02:24:51.723]  There's crazy stuff.
[02:24:51.723 --> 02:24:55.386]  Facebook is agreeing to restrict anti-government content in Vietnam now.
[02:24:55.979 --> 02:24:57.840]  On behalf of the government, right?
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:24:59.441]  These companies are in bed with China.
[02:24:59.441 --> 02:25:01.422]  Also, why are we using ChaiCon software?
[02:25:01.422 --> 02:25:02.803]  Why are we using things like Zoom?
[02:25:02.803 --> 02:25:09.007]  Why are our teenagers, why are our youth in this country using things like TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese?
[02:25:09.007 --> 02:25:10.227]  This is insanity.
[02:25:10.227 --> 02:25:11.908]  They're getting all of the data.
[02:25:11.908 --> 02:25:15.591]  They're collecting all of our data, all of our information, tracking us everywhere.
[02:25:15.591 --> 02:25:19.513]  The amount of privacy invasion that is going on in these ChaiCon apps is absurd.
[02:25:19.973 --> 02:25:27.556]  So what we're trying to do is build an open-source, people-powered alternative that is based here in the United States of America, built by Americans.
[02:25:27.556 --> 02:25:30.718]  And that's what we've been doing.
[02:25:30.718 --> 02:25:36.900]  You know, it's really obvious now why they were so busy trying to shut everybody down that was independent ahead of this takeover.
[02:25:36.900 --> 02:25:38.321]  We know they've been cooking it up.
[02:25:38.321 --> 02:25:42.843]  They admit they've been cooking up this virus release or using any virus to then scare everybody.
[02:25:42.843 --> 02:25:45.184]  I mean, this is really the big tech takeover.
[02:25:46.588 --> 02:25:47.088]  Absolutely.
[02:25:47.088 --> 02:25:51.390]  I mean, you see YouTube's CEO saying they're going to ban anybody that goes against the WHO guidelines.
[02:25:51.390 --> 02:25:56.351]  You can't say, take vitamin C on YouTube or you're going to get demonetized or banned.
[02:25:56.351 --> 02:25:58.312]  This is absolutely insane.
[02:25:58.312 --> 02:26:00.033]  I don't care what the WHO says.
[02:26:00.033 --> 02:26:02.433]  I don't care what YouTube says.
[02:26:02.433 --> 02:26:04.374]  I'm going to investigate things on my own.
[02:26:04.714 --> 02:26:05.995]  I'm going to get information on my own.
[02:26:05.995 --> 02:26:09.777]  I'm going to research things on my own, like an individual.
[02:26:09.777 --> 02:26:17.142]  I'm not going to bow down to this religion of scientism, which is really the new religion, Alex, when we're thinking about it.
[02:26:17.142 --> 02:26:22.265]  It is the new religion, this scientism, this bow down to the scientists, to whatever they say.
[02:26:22.265 --> 02:26:30.090]  Well, the problem is that we have multiple scientists saying conflicting things, and then you actually look at the data, as you were just talking about, and you see that the death rate is dramatically low.
[02:26:30.470 --> 02:26:30.731]  I don't
[02:26:47.549 --> 02:26:56.472]  How the grocery stores are now funneling people in, you know, like rabbits and counting the amount of people that go in and you're not allowed to enter the store unless you have a mask now.
[02:26:56.472 --> 02:26:59.093]  And this hysteria has got to stop.
[02:26:59.093 --> 02:27:01.994]  And it's all the blue cities and blue states that are doing it.
[02:27:01.994 --> 02:27:03.694]  And they're so eager to do it.
[02:27:03.694 --> 02:27:09.837]  Yesterday, I was in a parking lot at a street center because I saw my son driving and he said, pull over.
[02:27:09.837 --> 02:27:13.658]  We were talking and a guy was at the window pointing at me saying, put a mask on before you come in here.
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:16.082]  And I went over and told the guy he was an idiot.
[02:27:16.082 --> 02:27:16.842]  He was an idiot.
[02:27:16.842 --> 02:27:18.924]  It's just total mind control.
[02:27:18.924 --> 02:27:23.989]  Oh, they don't care about the 30 million currently starving to death because of this in the third world though.
[02:27:23.989 --> 02:27:25.411]  Oh, well that's no big deal.
[02:27:26.772 --> 02:27:31.596]  Well Alex, in my county, in Pennsylvania, I believe there's maybe 10 total cases.
[02:27:31.596 --> 02:27:33.738]  10 total cases, zero deaths.
[02:27:33.738 --> 02:27:37.141]  And yet everything in my county is also locked down with the rest of the state.
[02:27:37.141 --> 02:27:41.785]  You know, the majority of these cases, the majority of these deaths are happening in the big inner cities.
[02:27:41.785 --> 02:27:42.906]  So you have people that live there.
[02:27:42.906 --> 02:27:45.328]  Remember the movie The Island came out like 15 years ago?
[02:27:46.189 --> 02:27:52.839]  Where they're really being harvested for their organs, but they're told they're in this armored city to protect them because there's a virus outside.
[02:27:52.839 --> 02:27:57.387]  I mean, literally, you could tell those, go into a hole and let us have your organs.
[02:27:57.387 --> 02:27:59.370]  They'd do it if they told them the virus was out there.
[02:28:00.771 --> 02:28:02.272]  It's insanity, and you know what?
[02:28:02.272 --> 02:28:04.313]  I'm not going to bow down to fear.
[02:28:04.313 --> 02:28:07.535]  The thing that we always have to remember, Alex, is that we have God on our side, right?
[02:28:07.535 --> 02:28:13.038]  We are not of this world, but we have Jesus Christ, we have God on our side, we have our families are getting closer together.
[02:28:13.038 --> 02:28:14.879]  I'm trying to stay positive throughout all of this.
[02:28:14.879 --> 02:28:22.984]  There's a lot of good things that are happening right now because of this, in spite of this negative thing that's happening and impacting everyone around the world.
[02:28:22.984 --> 02:28:24.205]  I'm trying to stay positive here.
[02:28:25.859 --> 02:28:33.422]  Andrew, I want to talk about how we fight back when we come back, and what you think is coming up next in the censorship wars, because it is getting insane.
[02:28:33.422 --> 02:28:35.563]  And I want the listeners to know this, and I love you to death.
[02:28:35.563 --> 02:28:36.243]  You're awesome, folks.
[02:28:36.243 --> 02:28:37.744]  You're the reason we're here.
[02:28:37.744 --> 02:28:39.785]  When I say you're everything, you're everything.
[02:28:39.785 --> 02:28:44.647]  When you tell people about Gab, you tell people about InfoWars, about VanDopVideo, it changed the world.
[02:28:44.647 --> 02:28:46.767]  That's the only reason we're still here getting this out.
[02:28:46.767 --> 02:28:50.009]  And by the way, we're having a devastating effect on the globalists.
[02:28:50.009 --> 02:28:53.110]  You're having a devastating effect on the globalists, so I salute you.
[02:28:55.106 --> 02:28:58.547]  Attention all radio listeners who still need food supplies.
[02:28:58.547 --> 02:29:07.931]  If you've thought about the implication of food-related supply chain disruptions and are concerned about the coming quarantines, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:29:07.931 --> 02:29:08.851]  Here's why.
[02:29:08.851 --> 02:29:12.913]  In the next few days, all Americans will face extremely hard choices.
[02:29:12.913 --> 02:29:20.616]  If we've learned anything from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days away here in the U.S.
[02:29:21.016 --> 02:29:29.201]  Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce, you can still get enough open-pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one-acre crisis garden.
[02:29:29.201 --> 02:29:35.985]  The truth is, growing nutrient-dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single most important thing you do.
[02:29:35.985 --> 02:29:41.388]  Go to survivalseedbank.com and watch the new video to understand the nature of the threat.
[02:29:41.388 --> 02:29:43.049]  This could be life-saving.
[02:29:43.049 --> 02:29:45.931]  Lockdowns can last from 6 to 8 weeks.
[02:29:45.931 --> 02:29:47.192]  Get free bonus seeds.
[02:29:51.735 --> 02:30:11.030]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level, on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.370]  That is
[02:30:11.810 --> 02:30:27.875]  Hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19, and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the CHICOMS at the World Health Organization, with Bill Gates involved, are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[02:30:28.035 --> 02:30:29.075]  This is insane.
[02:30:29.075 --> 02:30:31.776]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[02:30:31.776 --> 02:30:33.237]  You need to get prepared now.
[02:30:33.237 --> 02:30:34.617]  You need to get high-quality, storable food.
[02:30:34.617 --> 02:30:37.738]  Now back in stock at InfowarStore.com.
[02:30:37.738 --> 02:30:41.840]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:48.102]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[02:30:48.102 --> 02:30:50.103]  This is beyond 1984.
[02:30:50.103 --> 02:30:51.703]  The tyranny of the dual order is here.
[02:30:51.703 --> 02:30:53.884]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the Infowar.
[02:30:54.124 --> 02:30:56.025]  You are the Paul Reveres!
[02:30:56.025 --> 02:31:04.470]  Authoritarians across the planet want the power to be able to tell you to stay in your houses and don't leave, and only go where they tell you to go.
[02:31:04.470 --> 02:31:06.491]  It's called martial law.
[02:31:06.491 --> 02:31:08.372]  It's called living in an authoritarian country.
[02:31:08.372 --> 02:31:09.832]  Everybody knows that.
[02:31:09.832 --> 02:31:11.413]  Everybody understands that.
[02:31:11.413 --> 02:31:17.917]  And the Democrats have now shown their hands with the deep state, saying, we're going to listen to Fauci and the World Health Organization.
[02:31:18.477 --> 02:31:22.141]  We've done nothing but put out all this fake news information so far.
[02:31:22.141 --> 02:31:23.863]  We're not going to listen to the President.
[02:31:23.863 --> 02:31:25.084]  We're not going to listen to Congress.
[02:31:26.135 --> 02:31:33.479]  That all these other corporations are going to work in tandem with big tech to surveil and control and keep things shut down.
[02:31:33.479 --> 02:31:36.600]  This is economic warfare and I know everybody understands that.
[02:31:36.600 --> 02:31:50.467]  Public, with the President and others, need to develop a plan to understand that this is a global corporate civil war and that we're being held hostage and this is a mutiny against our country by globalist forces.
[02:31:50.467 --> 02:31:55.169]  Only understanding the reality of the magnitude of that gives us any chance of defeating it.
[02:31:57.441 --> 02:32:02.586]  The power that I have is that I tell you what I really think, even if it ends up hurting me short term.
[02:32:02.586 --> 02:32:08.391]  I believe in God, and I believe in the long run, it'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[02:32:08.391 --> 02:32:12.515]  I understand what comes around, goes around, you reap what you sow, and I live that.
[02:32:12.515 --> 02:32:15.278]  And I fundamentally, at a cellular level, understand it.
[02:32:15.278 --> 02:32:20.203]  Now, if I would have hyped up the virus was going to kill 3, 4, 5 million people like the UN did,
[02:32:20.803 --> 02:32:23.084]  I would have sold five times more supplements.
[02:32:23.084 --> 02:32:23.685]  But you know what?
[02:32:23.685 --> 02:32:25.085]  I didn't do that.
[02:32:25.085 --> 02:32:32.429]  But I said, on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient, people are deficient in iodine, and so many other issues.
[02:32:32.429 --> 02:32:35.271]  You need those products regardless.
[02:32:35.271 --> 02:32:38.413]  So we started selling out of Vitamin Mineral Fusion and all the other products.
[02:32:38.413 --> 02:32:49.899]  I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their body's defenses.
[02:32:50.399 --> 02:32:59.070]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get restorable food now.
[02:32:59.070 --> 02:33:01.733]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.126 --> 02:33:29.468]  Susan Wachowski and her brother Ann Wachowski are heavily involved in eugenics.
[02:33:29.468 --> 02:33:37.049]  They're heavily involved in these DNA companies that tell you they're getting your DNA for one reason, they use it for another, they've been caught doing that.
[02:33:37.049 --> 02:33:43.331]  And they were brought in to censor YouTube and take control of it and help suppress folks around the world.
[02:33:43.331 --> 02:33:52.093]  But they go on Brian Stelter's show and talk about how if you don't follow the World Health Organization's directives,
[02:33:52.913 --> 02:33:56.734]  Not Congress, not the President, not your own speech, the U.N.
[02:33:56.734 --> 02:33:57.935]  You're going to be taken down.
[02:33:57.935 --> 02:34:11.119]  And they say vitamin C doesn't help you, vitamin D doesn't help you, silver is horrible, vitamin A is horrible, hydroxychloroquine, even though all the studies say it's awesome, Bill Monegate's had one study say it isn't.
[02:34:11.119 --> 02:34:12.800]  There's no hope but vaccines.
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:17.642]  There's no hope but gene therapy from these wonderful little ladies.
[02:34:18.906 --> 02:34:23.970]  And meanwhile, Brian Stelter says he crawled out of bed to cry for our pre-pandemic lives.
[02:34:23.970 --> 02:34:27.692]  Tears that have been waiting a month to escape.
[02:34:27.692 --> 02:34:30.034]  God, this psychotic doesn't know how ridiculous he sounds.
[02:34:30.034 --> 02:34:32.916]  I wanted to share because it feels freeing to do so.
[02:34:33.854 --> 02:34:36.356]  See, psychos are always trying to sound like they have real emotions.
[02:34:36.356 --> 02:34:42.941]  No, it's not a time for fake invincibility journos who are living this, hating this like everyone else.
[02:34:42.941 --> 02:34:47.385]  Oh, you're a person just like us, psycho boy, YouTube CEO.
[02:34:47.385 --> 02:34:52.309]  Anything that goes against WHO is a violation of YouTube policies.
[02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:53.490]  That's right.
[02:34:53.490 --> 02:34:57.133]  You see, it's everything.
[02:34:57.133 --> 02:35:00.115]  They'll also ban you if they say that Joe Biden has dementia.
[02:35:01.001 --> 02:35:02.722]  Doesn't matter if he clearly does.
[02:35:02.722 --> 02:35:10.567]  So these are your new rulers watching, controlling, they didn't just steal your data, they didn't just destroy your privacy, they didn't just help authoritarian states arrest people.
[02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:17.031]  Now, they're gonna tell you what you can and you can't do, and oh, by the way, if you protest, they're gonna ban you too.
[02:35:17.031 --> 02:35:23.214]  Here's what she had to say on, uh, Brian the Creepiest Man Alive Stalter Show.
[02:35:23.214 --> 02:35:24.355]  You're taking the lie down.
[02:35:24.355 --> 02:35:25.556]  That's a pretty aggressive approach.
[02:35:28.683 --> 02:35:31.787]  You're taking the lie down.
[02:35:31.787 --> 02:35:34.029]  These people define what's a lie.
[02:35:34.029 --> 02:35:38.854]  YouTube was for the people, and now it's like, no.
[02:35:38.854 --> 02:35:40.876]  She's involved with GlaxoSmithKline.
[02:35:40.876 --> 02:35:42.818]  I mean, these are nasty people.
[02:35:42.818 --> 02:35:43.059]  I'm sorry.
[02:35:44.344 --> 02:35:46.146]  Yeah, Google is a drug company now, folks.
[02:35:46.146 --> 02:35:47.087]  They're the biggest one.
[02:35:47.087 --> 02:35:48.329]  They've merged a bunch of them.
[02:35:48.329 --> 02:35:54.556]  So they're not telling you, oh, by the way, I work for a drug company, my sister's an executive at it, and we're pushing the very vaccine on you.
[02:35:54.556 --> 02:35:55.537]  No, she doesn't tell you.
[02:35:55.537 --> 02:35:58.140]  Like in the old days, they would on Fox News would cover Rupert Murdoch.
[02:35:58.140 --> 02:35:59.922]  They'd go, by the way, he owns our parent company.
[02:36:00.242 --> 02:36:00.923]  They don't do that.
[02:36:00.923 --> 02:36:06.487]  She just goes, if you criticize anything, if you don't talk about Bill Gates as if he's God, we're gonna ban you.
[02:36:06.487 --> 02:36:06.887]  Sorry.
[02:36:06.887 --> 02:36:09.629]  And don't try to demonstrate we'll ban you for that.
[02:36:09.629 --> 02:36:11.591]  I'm a woman though, so it's okay.
[02:36:11.591 --> 02:36:15.834]  By the way, it's okay that Tim Cook runs death camps because Tim Cook's gay, so it's alright.
[02:36:15.834 --> 02:36:19.156]  I'm sorry, let's go back to her.
[02:36:19.156 --> 02:36:21.758]  Just putting the truth next to the lie.
[02:36:21.758 --> 02:36:22.899]  You're taking the lie down.
[02:36:22.899 --> 02:36:24.100]  That's a pretty aggressive approach.
[02:36:25.114 --> 02:36:35.002]  Well, I mean, we do remove, you know, across YouTube in non-pandemic times, information that is a violation of our policy.
[02:36:35.002 --> 02:36:38.245]  And we've had community guidelines since the very beginning of YouTube.
[02:36:39.554 --> 02:36:45.298]  Our policy, our policy is you're non-essential, okay?
[02:36:45.298 --> 02:36:47.660]  It's a policy, it changes.
[02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:56.047]  And we've had rules forever, you know, when we bought YouTube and now there's no free speech, but it's okay because I act all non-threatening like this.
[02:36:56.047 --> 02:37:02.952]  Doesn't matter I'm coming with a forced inoculation with my sister or I've got your DNA and I'm selling it because I'm a woman.
[02:37:02.952 --> 02:37:04.333]  I'm sorry, let's go back to her.
[02:37:05.299 --> 02:37:12.643]  We've had community guidelines since the very beginning of YouTube, and we've always, anything that is a violation of our policy, we do remove it.
[02:37:12.643 --> 02:37:22.630]  And what was really unique about this was just how fast-moving the COVID-19 crisis was, and so we've had to make numerous policy changes, all within a really short period of time.
[02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:23.250]  Pause again.
[02:37:23.250 --> 02:37:25.251]  How fast you stampede it is?
[02:37:25.251 --> 02:37:29.614]  Now with less than one-tenth of one percent deaths?
[02:37:29.614 --> 02:37:33.896]  And then most of it is a zinc deficiency crisis?
[02:37:33.896 --> 02:37:34.657]  Let's finish up.
[02:37:35.666 --> 02:37:38.968]  of time to be able to make sure that we stay abreast of the changes.
[02:37:38.968 --> 02:37:46.732]  So, for example, just recently there was a theory that 5G was causing coronavirus symptoms.
[02:37:46.732 --> 02:37:54.956]  Now, no established health organization says that 5G is the source of the issue.
[02:37:54.956 --> 02:38:00.638]  Everyone just pointed out major studies saying 5G, 4G, all that lowers fertility, all that lowers immune system.
[02:38:00.638 --> 02:38:01.439]  You just type that in.
[02:38:01.439 --> 02:38:02.719]  It's Wired Magazine.
[02:38:02.719 --> 02:38:03.540]  It's major studies.
[02:38:05.660 --> 02:38:08.101]  But see, she goes, there's nothing established that says that.
[02:38:08.101 --> 02:38:10.901]  It's like, tobacco's good for you, drug, you know.
[02:38:10.901 --> 02:38:14.342]  Remember back when that, there's nothing established that cigarettes cause lung cancer.
[02:38:14.342 --> 02:38:19.404]  It's the same crap from this woman, who, by the way, is heavily invested in 5G real loud as well.
[02:38:19.404 --> 02:38:22.484]  And so is Google.
[02:38:22.484 --> 02:38:24.785]  But again, she's like, no!
[02:38:24.785 --> 02:38:28.406]  People don't know that we don't let you do that!
[02:38:28.406 --> 02:38:28.846]  Sorry, here we go.
[02:38:30.607 --> 02:38:35.471]  Established health organization says that 5G is the source of the issue.
[02:38:35.471 --> 02:38:43.398]  And so that quickly, we quickly deem that a violation of our policies with COVID-19 and remove that content.
[02:38:43.398 --> 02:38:44.079]  Pause again.
[02:38:44.079 --> 02:38:50.304]  Notice they're having, setting down the spread of communication is like shutting down the spread of a virus.
[02:38:50.304 --> 02:38:53.647]  Let's go back and look at Stelter, where he kind of sharks out there for a minute and goes,
[02:38:54.568 --> 02:39:02.014]  He kind of goes from the good boy act to showing us what the young ones see.
[02:39:02.014 --> 02:39:03.635]  Let's go back.
[02:39:03.635 --> 02:39:05.116]  Everyone's YouTube is different.
[02:39:05.116 --> 02:39:12.242]  Are there certain videos that basically everybody is seeing because they are so important or they are from such authoritative sources?
[02:39:12.927 --> 02:39:20.291]  Well, we definitely saw a really high click-through and all the different public health information that we made available.
[02:39:20.291 --> 02:39:25.514]  But this crisis has just moved so quickly.
[02:39:25.514 --> 02:39:36.621]  Just the speed of it has taken away everyone's time in terms of how quickly we move from just having a few infections, right, to having large parts of the world being under quarantine.
[02:39:36.621 --> 02:39:38.582]  Because they tested positive for a cold.
[02:39:39.096 --> 02:39:39.956]  Users have changed.
[02:39:39.956 --> 02:39:48.960]  So, you know, first starting with just really basic information about what was coronavirus, you know, then we really focused on the stay-at-home messages and got that.
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:57.084]  And now, really interestingly, we're seeing a lot of users come to us and want to know about life under quarantine.
[02:39:57.084 --> 02:40:00.605]  And so we see a lot of interest in things like exercise at home.
[02:40:00.605 --> 02:40:02.706]  Like, how do I fix my dishwasher?
[02:40:02.706 --> 02:40:04.187]  How do I fix my freezer?
[02:40:04.187 --> 02:40:05.367]  Stay in your prison cell!
[02:40:05.367 --> 02:40:06.548]  You're doing so well!
[02:40:07.188 --> 02:40:13.072]  And so we've definitely seen an evolution across our platform in all these different ways.
[02:40:13.072 --> 02:40:17.335]  Do you think this crisis has caused YouTube to change in ways that will be long-term?
[02:40:17.335 --> 02:40:19.436]  Alright, I can't listen to it anymore.
[02:40:19.436 --> 02:40:21.718]  Let's go back to Andrew Torba of Gab.
[02:40:21.718 --> 02:40:23.159]  Gab, founder, give us your take on this.
[02:40:23.159 --> 02:40:33.246]  Tell us about the exciting video conferencing, because I don't want to use Zoom that the judges and the courts and the FBI is using and everybody's using, but then it's Chai Com Run.
[02:40:33.246 --> 02:40:33.386]  Yeah.
[02:40:34.764 --> 02:40:35.665]  Right, absolutely.
[02:40:35.665 --> 02:40:43.650]  I mean, there's plenty of articles out there that show, The Intercept had one that showed that Zoom has over 700 employees out of China.
[02:40:43.650 --> 02:40:49.654]  They admitted to, openly admitted to Alex, routing call data through Chinese servers.
[02:40:49.654 --> 02:40:58.260]  So you have hundreds of millions of people now that are using this for church, for school, you know, for all sorts of things, talking with their friends.
[02:40:58.260 --> 02:40:59.421]  Governments are using this.
[02:41:00.021 --> 02:41:00.342]  I think so.
[02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:22.921]  We're going to build an alternative to Zoom, and that's going to be coming out next week.
[02:41:22.921 --> 02:41:27.923]  We're going to be launching that into beta, so we're really excited about that, to give people just an option, a choice.
[02:41:27.923 --> 02:41:34.005]  You can use the QICOM-connected software, or you can use the American-built and American-owned and operated software.
[02:41:34.005 --> 02:41:38.326]  And by the way, if folks get excited about this, it could blow up so huge, because they know you were a big developer.
[02:41:38.906 --> 02:41:54.738]  Out there, they know you're a smart guy, and they literally tied you to some white supremacist scumbag that posted something on a message board you ran as if you were that, but they failed to shut you down thanks to your supporters, and that's why I said to the listeners again, you're not part of the solution, you're it, folks.
[02:41:54.738 --> 02:42:00.542]  Yeah, Andrew Torb is a smart guy, he wants to fight tyranny, so do I. We're just like you, but without each other, we're nothing, folks.
[02:42:01.062 --> 02:42:05.724]  I know I harp on that, but man, listeners need to know, you are the answer.
[02:42:05.724 --> 02:42:09.546]  Look in the mirror, and I can't wait to use your system.
[02:42:09.546 --> 02:42:13.248]  I'm going to tell all these interviewers, all these folks that want me to use Zoom, I say no.
[02:42:13.248 --> 02:42:14.629]  We're going to use Gab's system.
[02:42:14.629 --> 02:42:15.289]  What's it going to be called?
[02:42:16.834 --> 02:42:23.660]  It's going to be called On by Gab, and we're really excited because, like you said, we're 100% funded by our users.
[02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:26.262]  We have 4 million people that are coming to this site every month.
[02:42:26.262 --> 02:42:28.324]  We are user funded, user owned.
[02:42:28.324 --> 02:42:29.125]  We always have been.
[02:42:29.125 --> 02:42:31.327]  We don't have big venture capitalist investors.
[02:42:31.327 --> 02:42:34.009]  We don't have big corporate advertisers, just like InfoWars.
[02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:41.571]  Gab has, since it started back in 2016, been 100% funded, owned, and operated by the people.
[02:42:41.571 --> 02:42:45.092]  And we thank all the people out there who have been supporting us and all of our products.
[02:42:45.092 --> 02:42:52.054]  We're really excited to get this out, and we can't wait to just offer people an option outside of the chat.com software that's out there right now.
[02:42:52.054 --> 02:42:53.414]  All right, I know you're busy.
[02:42:53.414 --> 02:42:54.535]  We're going to come back in a few more minutes.
[02:42:54.535 --> 02:42:55.095]  I'm going to go to calls.
[02:42:56.104 --> 02:43:01.308]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[02:43:01.308 --> 02:43:05.612]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[02:43:05.612 --> 02:43:10.055]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[02:43:10.055 --> 02:43:18.462]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[02:43:18.462 --> 02:43:25.688]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[02:43:26.088 --> 02:43:29.711]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[02:43:29.711 --> 02:43:35.016]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[02:43:35.016 --> 02:43:43.083]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[02:43:43.083 --> 02:43:48.468]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze today and save big on a world class air filtration system for your home.
[02:43:48.468 --> 02:43:50.750]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.
[02:43:50.750 --> 02:43:52.771]  Get this special today at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:54.730 --> 02:43:57.094]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[02:43:57.094 --> 02:43:57.675]  They're amazing.
[02:43:57.675 --> 02:43:58.336]  They're cutting edge.
[02:43:58.336 --> 02:43:58.777]  You love them.
[02:43:58.777 --> 02:43:59.418]  I love them.
[02:43:59.418 --> 02:44:03.065]  And they fund the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[02:44:03.065 --> 02:44:07.011]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:09.801]  That is amazing.
[02:44:09.801 --> 02:44:17.484]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[02:44:17.484 --> 02:44:19.805]  And there's another innovation.
[02:44:19.805 --> 02:44:21.885]  It's the spray cap.
[02:44:21.885 --> 02:44:27.308]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[02:44:27.308 --> 02:44:29.468]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[02:44:29.468 --> 02:44:30.389]  I like to put it on my hands.
[02:44:31.129 --> 02:44:32.630]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:35.451]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[02:44:35.451 --> 02:44:39.854]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[02:44:39.854 --> 02:44:41.634]  So, this is a real innovation.
[02:44:41.634 --> 02:44:47.978]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[02:44:47.978 --> 02:44:49.518]  It smells great.
[02:44:49.518 --> 02:44:51.339]  It's so refreshing.
[02:44:51.339 --> 02:44:52.200]  This is a big winner.
[02:44:55.967 --> 02:45:00.812]  Ten weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high-quality, sorable food.
[02:45:00.812 --> 02:45:11.984]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown it would cause, because the Globeless were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states.
[02:45:12.745 --> 02:45:17.170]  Now that prediction has come true, because the globalists are running an operation.
[02:45:17.170 --> 02:45:19.152]  It's not predictions.
[02:45:19.152 --> 02:45:21.415]  We have their battle plans.
[02:45:21.415 --> 02:45:29.684]  So, going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storable food companies were sold out, except My Patriot Supply, because they're the biggest and were prepositioned.
[02:45:29.684 --> 02:45:32.367]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in,
[02:45:32.887 --> 02:45:35.190]  That they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner.
[02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:37.692]  They stopped taking orders until they got caught back up.
[02:45:37.692 --> 02:45:39.274]  Well, now they're caught back up.
[02:45:39.274 --> 02:45:43.158]  They've got high-quality, storable food in stock, ready to be packaged and shipped to you.
[02:45:43.158 --> 02:45:51.588]  Get your orders in now at InfowarStore.com to go right at the head of the queue and get delivered to you as fast as possible and from the Infowar.
[02:45:51.588 --> 02:45:53.830]  Get your storable food now at InfowarStore.com.
[02:45:55.512 --> 02:46:03.419]  Globalism is all about making the nation-state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[02:46:03.419 --> 02:46:15.909]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[02:46:15.909 --> 02:46:21.935]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out,
[02:46:22.495 --> 02:46:26.798]  They can simply look at us and say, because again, you are not essential.
[02:46:26.798 --> 02:46:29.820]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[02:46:29.820 --> 02:46:33.983]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[02:46:33.983 --> 02:46:37.806]  We can be told to stay in our houses, and after all, shut up!
[02:46:37.806 --> 02:46:39.447]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways.
[02:46:39.447 --> 02:46:43.971]  It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[02:46:43.971 --> 02:46:45.772]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[02:46:46.553 --> 02:46:49.698]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[02:46:49.698 --> 02:46:59.072]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[02:46:59.072 --> 02:47:01.695]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:13.226 --> 02:47:21.611]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:21.611 --> 02:47:26.515]  Man, it is crazy what's on InfoWars.com.
[02:47:26.515 --> 02:47:28.856]  Paul Joseph Watson has said, is this the new normal?
[02:47:28.856 --> 02:47:31.998]  Martial law, total collapse.
[02:47:31.998 --> 02:47:34.700]  They promised it was only a few weeks, so that was just getting the handcuffs on.
[02:47:35.799 --> 02:47:36.119]  I think so.
[02:47:59.445 --> 02:48:00.846]  America wants to be in the farmhouse.
[02:48:00.846 --> 02:48:03.328]  You want to be there with him raping him, pulling your teeth out with pliers.
[02:48:03.328 --> 02:48:05.209]  So don't worry, it's going to happen.
[02:48:05.209 --> 02:48:10.834]  I know our regular listeners aren't like that, but man, for the average person, you are screwed.
[02:48:10.834 --> 02:48:13.636]  We got something really crazy I'm about to get to right now.
[02:48:13.636 --> 02:48:18.059]  There's also video of women being arrested for playground with their children at empty playgrounds.
[02:48:18.059 --> 02:48:21.222]  They almost arrested the goat.
[02:48:23.186 --> 02:48:28.391]  When he was down in Florida doing football, you know, training in a park, doing push-ups.
[02:48:28.391 --> 02:48:33.056]  I mean, it's just... The police are just bureaucrats that follow their orders.
[02:48:33.056 --> 02:48:42.385]  I'm not even enemies with the average police officer, but... This is a takeover, and us not saying no and not taking control of our governments has allowed this.
[02:48:42.385 --> 02:48:43.466]  Andrew Torba of Gab.
[02:48:44.639 --> 02:48:47.780]  What do you make in closing of this power grab and how far it's gone?
[02:48:47.780 --> 02:48:55.644]  And the head of Facebook saying, yeah, we're going to block anybody and ban people that try to protest being permanently locked down.
[02:48:55.644 --> 02:48:57.405]  The new normal is being permanently locked down.
[02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:08.626]  Alex, my favorite thing about what's going on on Facebook right now is they're issuing warnings to users who have clicked on coronavirus quote misinformation.
[02:49:08.626 --> 02:49:19.752]  And then the story broke that a Facebook fact checker who is a part of the team that is making sure that what is being posted is within the acceptable authoritative narrative.
[02:49:19.752 --> 02:49:22.773]  Turns out that person worked at the Wuhan Biolab, right?
[02:49:22.773 --> 02:49:24.134]  What a coincidence, right?
[02:49:24.134 --> 02:49:25.634]  Very interesting to see that.
[02:49:25.634 --> 02:49:28.636]  Actually, she's the head of Facebook science fact checking.
[02:49:29.784 --> 02:49:30.825]  Right, exactly.
[02:49:30.825 --> 02:49:39.876]  And she works at the Wuhan Biolab and is responsible for correcting the record on the Wuhan Biolab and what is actually going on there.
[02:49:39.876 --> 02:49:42.519]  That is a new level of conflict of interest.
[02:49:42.519 --> 02:49:44.922]  It's like having Hitler over the Nuremberg trial.
[02:49:46.435 --> 02:49:47.316]  It's unbelievable.
[02:49:47.316 --> 02:49:49.717]  I mean, they're not even hiding this stuff anymore.
[02:49:49.717 --> 02:49:51.418]  They're hiding really in plain sight.
[02:49:51.418 --> 02:49:58.381]  And I think what we need to do is what we at GAP have been doing, what you at InfoWars have been doing for years now, which is building.
[02:49:58.381 --> 02:50:00.562]  We need to build alternative infrastructure.
[02:50:00.562 --> 02:50:09.086]  We need to build alternative platforms, alternative technology, because as long as we continue to use these platforms, as long as we continue to rely on these platforms,
[02:50:09.605 --> 02:50:10.326]  I don't know.
[02:50:31.875 --> 02:50:33.016]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:50:33.016 --> 02:50:36.559]  And again, you know, we're 100% dependent on our people, right?
[02:50:36.559 --> 02:50:38.520]  We have no outside venture capitalists.
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:40.822]  We have no big corporate sponsors.
[02:50:40.822 --> 02:50:43.184]  All these guys have billions and billions of dollars.
[02:50:43.184 --> 02:50:54.093]  And, you know, here we are in a small town in Pennsylvania, living the American dream and building an alternative that is truly powered by the people, funded by the people.
[02:50:54.093 --> 02:50:55.614]  We have a web browser now.
[02:50:55.614 --> 02:50:56.695]  We have a social network now.
[02:50:56.695 --> 02:50:59.257]  We're about to launch a video conferencing alternative.
[02:50:59.737 --> 02:51:03.642]  We have so many different things and so many different products that we're building because these things are essential.
[02:51:03.642 --> 02:51:11.971]  But all of them work together for one common purpose, which is to empower people to speak freely and to offer an alternative to the Silicon Valley tyranny.
[02:51:11.971 --> 02:51:15.215]  And that's what we've been doing for about four years now, and that's what I'm going to continue to do.
[02:51:15.215 --> 02:51:16.536]  It's absolutely beautiful.
[02:51:16.536 --> 02:51:17.257]  When you launch...
[02:51:18.118 --> 02:51:23.242]  The new competitor that's not Chi Com Global's run of Zoom in the next week or so.
[02:51:23.242 --> 02:51:24.563]  Please come back on the day.
[02:51:24.563 --> 02:51:24.923]  It's there.
[02:51:24.923 --> 02:51:27.064]  Let's test it out together on air.
[02:51:27.064 --> 02:51:27.905]  I would love to do that with you.
[02:51:27.905 --> 02:51:28.465]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:28.465 --> 02:51:30.287]  That'd be fantastic.
[02:51:30.287 --> 02:51:31.428]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:51:31.428 --> 02:51:32.068]  Thank you.
[02:51:32.068 --> 02:51:34.049]  It's innovators like that that are going to save us.
[02:51:34.049 --> 02:51:37.031]  And it's your support of innovations that are going to save us, folks.
[02:51:37.031 --> 02:51:41.295]  Because you could say like that's the arteries in the heart, but you're the blood, the oxygen supporting it.
[02:51:41.295 --> 02:51:43.356]  And speaking of that, I want to go to some calls.
[02:51:43.356 --> 02:51:47.219]  Then I'll get to this other creepy thing that's really important that we need to cover that
[02:51:48.058 --> 02:51:52.743]  Daria tried to get me to cover it last week, and I didn't cover it, and now it's kind of breaking big, and I'm glad it is.
[02:51:52.743 --> 02:51:55.826]  There's an article about it on fullwarriors.com, Predictive Programming.
[02:51:55.826 --> 02:51:58.428]  Internet notes, eerie similarities.
[02:51:58.428 --> 02:52:00.190]  It's not eerie similarities.
[02:52:00.190 --> 02:52:12.522]  Between 2012 Olympics opening ceremony and coronavirus pandemic, it is a grim reaper slaughtering people en masse in a world depopulation event that's beautiful and wonderful, and then the earth is reborn after we're exterminated and saved.
[02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:17.861]  You're like, why in the hell do they do things like this?
[02:52:17.861 --> 02:52:20.362]  They do it because it's a ritual, folks.
[02:52:20.362 --> 02:52:22.403]  They're externalizing their method.
[02:52:22.403 --> 02:52:23.963]  All right.
[02:52:23.963 --> 02:52:36.087]  I want to hit a few calls before we end this segment, but our biggest problem funding our operations around here is that I get so busy and then I don't plug the right products that you need that are high quality that fund what we're doing here.
[02:52:36.087 --> 02:52:37.288]  And so I just want to
[02:52:39.702 --> 02:52:42.624]  Ask listeners to think about something.
[02:52:42.624 --> 02:52:47.247]  Imagine if InfoWars wasn't here.
[02:52:47.247 --> 02:52:59.134]  And I can tell you, keeping InfoWars at the current size, I'd love it to be a lot bigger and more offensive to the globalists, both offensive to what they like and offensive politically to take down what they're doing, both a offense and offensive
[02:53:00.523 --> 02:53:06.808]  But it really is you supporting the broadcast when you spread the word, when you pray for us, when you buy the products that makes the whole world go round.
[02:53:06.808 --> 02:53:09.110]  So I'm not going to belabor this.
[02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:12.192]  I think if you don't have storable foods right now, you're crazy.
[02:53:12.192 --> 02:53:15.194]  You hear callers calling that work at warehouses that are basically becoming empty.
[02:53:15.194 --> 02:53:17.176]  And as soon as the food comes out, it's gone.
[02:53:17.176 --> 02:53:18.777]  Well, I have the numbers here.
[02:53:18.777 --> 02:53:20.118]  We're going into a depression.
[02:53:20.118 --> 02:53:22.740]  They're talking about everything going belly up.
[02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:24.962]  The state's all going bankrupt, starting with blue states.
[02:53:24.962 --> 02:53:26.443]  And they're going to then pull us down with them.
[02:53:28.115 --> 02:53:30.638]  And the leader of the Senate saying, no, we're not going to do that.
[02:53:30.638 --> 02:53:32.340]  We're going to let blue cities and states go down.
[02:53:32.340 --> 02:53:33.181]  We just can't help it.
[02:53:33.181 --> 02:53:35.043]  You're the ones locking the country down.
[02:53:35.043 --> 02:53:38.327]  That is a very positive move, to be honest.
[02:53:38.327 --> 02:53:41.911]  And the Justice Department said, you got people on house arrest.
[02:53:43.191 --> 02:53:47.736]  This is mutiny at the state levels against the country.
[02:53:47.736 --> 02:53:57.346]  This is insane letting the UN tell you through big tech and through local government when you can open with something that doesn't even kill 1% of people that are already run down and sick.
[02:53:57.346 --> 02:54:03.133]  This is us just capitulating to total fear and acting like cowardly hysterics.
[02:54:05.057 --> 02:54:11.100]  Yes, I promote zinc, and I promote vitamin C, and I promote sunlight, and I support being healthy.
[02:54:11.100 --> 02:54:15.482]  Because if you don't have those things, the regular cold comes along and kills you better than a hammer.
[02:54:15.482 --> 02:54:18.663]  That's why they're called essential, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:18.663 --> 02:54:24.406]  But, separate from that, I look for a day when the federal government says, food's not essential.
[02:54:24.406 --> 02:54:26.127]  It's a conspiracy theory, everybody needs food.
[02:54:28.170 --> 02:54:28.871]  It's ridiculous.
[02:54:28.871 --> 02:54:29.591]  You need food.
[02:54:29.591 --> 02:54:30.591]  We have high-quality food.
[02:54:30.591 --> 02:54:34.333]  I would get your orders in now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:54:34.333 --> 02:54:36.773]  We had to suspend orders again for a couple weeks.
[02:54:36.773 --> 02:54:38.974]  As long as you get your order in, you will get it.
[02:54:38.974 --> 02:54:39.734]  They have the food.
[02:54:39.734 --> 02:54:42.175]  They just have to package it and ship it to you.
[02:54:42.175 --> 02:54:44.476]  But they may suspend orders again.
[02:54:44.476 --> 02:54:48.438]  When they came back about three weeks ago and said, okay, you can do food orders again, we've caught up.
[02:54:48.438 --> 02:54:49.478]  In fact, we're ahead of schedule.
[02:54:51.687 --> 02:54:54.192]  They called us up yesterday and they said, OK, people figured it out.
[02:54:54.192 --> 02:54:56.617]  They're just buying food hand over fist right now.
[02:54:56.617 --> 02:55:00.304]  And we don't want to raise prices, but we've already opened up two more factories.
[02:55:01.523 --> 02:55:05.665]  You know, between me, you and the Fence Post, maybe in two weeks, they're going to suspend food sales again.
[02:55:05.665 --> 02:55:10.748]  And then they're not sure they can ever get long-term food orders out the next six months a year.
[02:55:10.748 --> 02:55:12.229]  I mean, it's that crazy.
[02:55:12.229 --> 02:55:13.509]  It's that insane.
[02:55:13.509 --> 02:55:15.471]  It's that out of control.
[02:55:15.471 --> 02:55:20.613]  So I would get your storable food orders in now and in fullmorestore.com before it's too late.
[02:55:20.613 --> 02:55:27.037]  And then I would do all the other really important things for you and your family that are no-brainers, because the globalists
[02:55:27.757 --> 02:55:29.539]  We've bowed down to this.
[02:55:29.539 --> 02:55:31.981]  Not the audience, but the general public has so much.
[02:55:31.981 --> 02:55:35.023]  They've got all sorts of really nasty bioweapons ready.
[02:55:35.023 --> 02:55:36.404]  And that's why they say, oh, get ready for it.
[02:55:36.404 --> 02:55:37.085]  Cycle.
[02:55:37.085 --> 02:55:44.972]  They can release any number of weaponized cold viruses now and just call it COVID-20, COVID-21, and then have the patents of the vaccines.
[02:55:44.972 --> 02:55:48.535]  And they've got cold viruses that obviously kill a lot more than this one does.
[02:55:48.535 --> 02:55:50.256]  So this is just a beta test.
[02:55:50.256 --> 02:55:54.440]  We have really gotten a fetal position and urinated all over ourselves collectively.
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:58.583]  And so, they're just going to hammer the hell out of us.
[02:55:58.583 --> 02:56:09.010]  Unless the Chai Com and Globalist agents get arrested, unless Big Pharma gets shut down with what they're doing, unless we go into total offense and expose them, they have really cracked the code to bring us down.
[02:56:09.010 --> 02:56:20.419]  So I would suggest everybody get prepared now with 8-pack Power Stack X3, DNA Force Plus, Living Defense Plus, Limited Edition InfoWars COVID-19 Mask to get the First Amendment out and expose the hoax.
[02:56:20.999 --> 02:56:31.668]  Bazo beats 40% off, Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, Ultra 12, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Winter Sun, Alexa Pure Breeze, Bodies, Ultra Turmeric Formula, Turbo Force, Storable Food.
[02:56:31.668 --> 02:56:37.432]  It's all 30 to 60% off right now at infowarestore.com.
[02:56:37.432 --> 02:56:39.854]  And the big thing I do, if you haven't done it yet, is the turmeric.
[02:56:40.655 --> 02:56:44.198]  The X3, X2 should be back in soon.
[02:56:44.198 --> 02:56:49.922]  And I would really, if I was you, take the Winter Sun that we still have in stock, sold out for months.
[02:56:49.922 --> 02:56:51.103]  It's now back in stock.
[02:56:51.103 --> 02:56:53.025]  We've already sold out a half our stock, though.
[02:56:53.025 --> 02:56:57.808]  It has the vitamin D3 under the tongue, and it has the vitamin K with it that's so important.
[02:56:57.808 --> 02:57:02.071]  And again, YouTube will ban you if you say you need vitamin C. It's essential.
[02:57:02.071 --> 02:57:08.616]  You'll die without vitamin C. But YouTube is such a cult of satanic demons, even if I was lying, I should be able to say, hey, you need vitamin C.
[02:57:09.950 --> 02:57:13.013]  I expect them again to say, food you don't need anymore.
[02:57:13.013 --> 02:57:16.156]  And just say that's a conspiracy theory and food is not essential.
[02:57:16.156 --> 02:57:18.138]  These people are trash.
[02:57:18.138 --> 02:57:19.979]  They want to make you poor to control you.
[02:57:19.979 --> 02:57:25.805]  They don't want to manage uppity first world nations and we're being brought to heel right now and it's disgusting.
[02:57:25.805 --> 02:57:28.767]  All right, folks that have been holding patiently like EJ.
[02:57:29.788 --> 02:57:34.053]  And Ryan, and John, and Patrick, and Ruben, and Sonny.
[02:57:34.053 --> 02:57:38.278]  We're going to all of you on the other side in T-minus two minutes.
[02:57:38.278 --> 02:57:41.201]  And then, David Knight's coming in studio.
[02:57:41.201 --> 02:57:45.446]  We'll be right back with the fourth hour and that big report.
[02:57:45.446 --> 02:57:49.751]  And all of a sudden, the trap snaps, and you're inside.
[02:57:51.261 --> 02:58:09.015]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years, going back to Magna Carta in 1215, of hard-fought basic human dignity and liberty, and believing that the individual was sovereign, and had basic, unalienable rights, has been absolutely erased, just in March.
[02:58:09.015 --> 02:58:16.680]  And the Communist Chinese have been our teachers, and Big Tech has been our controllers, and we're all being introduced now
[02:58:17.654 --> 02:58:27.238]  The digital straitjacket that depends on us complying with it, and depends on us all hen-pecking each other into submission.
[02:58:27.238 --> 02:58:36.662]  But for all of you out there that have decided to go along with this, mark your calendars down, and then in a few months, a few years, look at the world and remember, you did this.
[02:58:36.662 --> 02:58:42.225]  You were the prisoners, you were the slaves, you were the people that crouched down and licked the hand that fed you.
[02:58:42.225 --> 02:58:44.566]  As for me, give me liberty, or give me death.
[02:58:46.579 --> 02:58:54.323]  It's been sold out for more than four months, but our best-selling vitamin D3 and vitamin K formula is back in stock.
[02:58:54.323 --> 02:58:56.204]  Winter sun.
[02:58:56.204 --> 02:59:02.427]  In the fall, in the winter, as you know, your body, when you're not getting sunlight on the skin, does not produce vitamin D3.
[02:59:02.427 --> 02:59:05.469]  So it's important to ingest it.
[02:59:05.469 --> 02:59:08.590]  But a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut.
[02:59:08.590 --> 02:59:15.214]  So you take this formula under the tongue, it tastes sweet naturally, let it sit there about 30 seconds to a minute,
[02:59:15.714 --> 02:59:19.597]  And then you swallow the rest, and it's just amazing.
[02:59:19.597 --> 02:59:26.303]  It's back in stock, and yes, we're going to offer it at 50% off, because that's the right thing to do during this crisis.
[02:59:26.303 --> 02:59:28.184]  So, Winter Sun, 50% off.
[02:59:28.184 --> 02:59:31.166]  We also have Ultra 12, highest quality, B12.
[02:59:31.166 --> 02:59:35.430]  It is also available, take it out of the tongue, 50% off.
[02:59:35.430 --> 02:59:37.231]  InfoWarsTore.com, and we have X3.
[02:59:37.231 --> 02:59:43.977]  Even though it's going to sell out, super high quality, deeper iodine, it is 60% off, because I want you to have it right now.
[02:59:43.977 --> 02:59:44.998]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:49.071 --> 02:59:55.993]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:55.993 --> 03:00:06.496]  We are back live, broadcasting worldwide, taking your phone calls.
[03:00:06.496 --> 03:00:07.657]  Right now.
[03:00:07.657 --> 03:00:11.898]  Okay, this has been holding the longest here.
[03:00:16.243 --> 03:00:17.745]  That'd be Patrick in Florida.
[03:00:17.745 --> 03:00:21.368]  Go ahead, Patrick, then Ruben.
[03:00:21.368 --> 03:00:22.489]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:00:22.489 --> 03:00:23.170]  I sure can, brother.
[03:00:23.170 --> 03:00:24.652]  Thanks for calling today.
[03:00:24.652 --> 03:00:25.753]  I appreciate you, Alex.
[03:00:25.753 --> 03:00:33.501]  I've been listening to you for about 12 years, and this is the first time ever I have ever felt compelled to call in.
[03:00:33.501 --> 03:00:34.522]  Well, good to have you here, brother.
[03:00:34.522 --> 03:00:36.123]  I feel very compelled right now, too.
[03:00:36.123 --> 03:00:36.444]  Believe me.
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:38.641]  I hear you.
[03:00:38.641 --> 03:00:41.323]  Hosea 4-6, I'll just start that out.
[03:00:41.323 --> 03:00:43.225]  My people shall perish for lack of knowledge.
[03:00:43.225 --> 03:00:47.508]  I think that's really the overarching intent over this world right now.
[03:00:47.508 --> 03:00:59.937]  Yeah, we've got less than 1% dying, and it's like it's the end of the world while the real economy dies, and while 30 million people are set to starve to death, the UN admits in the next few months, people go, so what?
[03:00:59.937 --> 03:01:03.320]  They need to die to stop the virus, when the virus hadn't even killed 200,000 people worldwide!
[03:01:05.461 --> 03:01:06.602]  Yep, yep.
[03:01:06.602 --> 03:01:09.385]  Now, I heard your interviews with David Icke.
[03:01:09.385 --> 03:01:11.567]  I saw his interview with Brian Rose.
[03:01:11.567 --> 03:01:14.570]  I do know that you kind of disagree on some of the things he talks about.
[03:01:15.359 --> 03:01:21.784]  But in my view, and I'm going to explain, I'm going to try to be like laser focused here and get to all these points.
[03:01:21.784 --> 03:01:28.189]  In my view, he's actually 100% dead on, but let me add some things which he did not talk about.
[03:01:28.189 --> 03:01:37.455]  And what I want to talk about today is the whole topic of virology itself from the start and where we are today to get us to where we are with COVID-19.
[03:01:37.455 --> 03:01:40.037]  I'm not a virologist.
[03:01:40.037 --> 03:01:40.958]  I'm not an immunologist.
[03:01:41.862 --> 03:01:44.343]  I am not any of those things.
[03:01:44.343 --> 03:01:45.563]  Don't preface it while you're on air.
[03:01:45.563 --> 03:01:46.883]  Just get to it.
[03:01:46.883 --> 03:01:47.703]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:47.703 --> 03:01:49.324]  Okay.
[03:01:49.324 --> 03:01:52.024]  We always question the government narrative about every subject.
[03:01:52.024 --> 03:01:56.405]  Have we ever questioned, really, the narrative about virology as a whole?
[03:01:56.405 --> 03:01:57.545]  So let's start.
[03:01:57.545 --> 03:02:01.686]  At the beginning, virology was started by Louis Pasteur.
[03:02:01.686 --> 03:02:04.246]  He said in the late 1880s, I've got these molecules.
[03:02:04.246 --> 03:02:06.347]  They're a hundred times smaller than bacteria.
[03:02:06.347 --> 03:02:07.067]  They make you sick.
[03:02:07.836 --> 03:02:13.624]  Funny thing is, electron microscope wasn't even created for 50 years.
[03:02:13.624 --> 03:02:21.474]  He could never have known that and he was exposed 100 years after the fact by Gerard Gieson in the book, The Private Science by Louis Pasteur.
[03:02:21.474 --> 03:02:22.576]  So let me move on from there.
[03:02:22.836 --> 03:02:23.536]  No, you're right.
[03:02:23.536 --> 03:02:29.439]  All of this is based on stuff where they make science fit into what was already a school of thought and believed.
[03:02:29.439 --> 03:02:31.600]  We do know there are these little particles out there.
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:33.140]  Of course, there were smaller particles.
[03:02:33.140 --> 03:02:34.561]  That was hard to predict.
[03:02:34.561 --> 03:02:39.223]  But then now they're trying to make everything comport to the relationship they originally gave it.
[03:02:39.223 --> 03:02:39.663]  You got it.
[03:02:39.663 --> 03:02:44.845]  Have you ever heard of Dr. Stefan Lenka?
[03:02:44.845 --> 03:02:46.446]  Tell me about it.
[03:02:46.446 --> 03:02:50.288]  Okay, Stefan Lenka, German biochemist.
[03:02:51.309 --> 03:03:00.793]  A couple years back, he put up a $100,000 bounty for anybody in the world that could prove to him in court that the measles virus exists.
[03:03:00.793 --> 03:03:03.214]  Stefan Lanka, he's out of Germany, you can look this up.
[03:03:03.214 --> 03:03:05.035]  So it went to court.
[03:03:05.035 --> 03:03:09.717]  A guy named David Barton challenged him, another doctor, and said, hey, I'm going to prove it.
[03:03:09.717 --> 03:03:12.238]  Lower court said, Mr. Lanka, you've got to pay him $100,000.
[03:03:12.238 --> 03:03:14.739]  No, I remember this now.
[03:03:14.739 --> 03:03:15.619]  Not so fast.
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:27.969]  It got put up through the German Supreme Court that that doctor and a bunch of his colleagues, other experts, could never prove that the virus could ever exist.
[03:03:27.969 --> 03:03:32.012]  So then we have the MMR they've been shooting kids with for how many decades?
[03:03:32.012 --> 03:03:35.175]  For a virus that they cannot even prove exists.
[03:03:35.175 --> 03:03:35.315]  Okay?
[03:03:36.803 --> 03:03:39.984]  Well, sir, I mean, look, we all argue about viruses and all this.
[03:03:39.984 --> 03:03:44.446]  They're caught adding things to vaccines and declassified secret testing.
[03:03:44.446 --> 03:03:46.066]  The constant gardeners about that.
[03:03:46.066 --> 03:03:46.807]  It's fictitious.
[03:03:46.807 --> 03:03:48.287]  You know, it's a fictional deal.
[03:03:48.287 --> 03:03:54.049]  It's all the admissions of secret testing by major governments, including lethal ones on people are confirmed.
[03:03:54.049 --> 03:04:00.392]  So why do we trust groups that have done secret lethal testing that Bill Gates's father was involved in on record?
[03:04:01.132 --> 03:04:04.795]  And then Bill Gates says he wants to kill everybody, and now he wants to put something in us.
[03:04:04.795 --> 03:04:08.618]  See, everybody always ignores all the elephants in the room.
[03:04:08.618 --> 03:04:15.843]  Whether we argue that viruses are the way they say they are, or viral spread is the way we, you know, everyone always debates what can't be proven.
[03:04:16.704 --> 03:04:26.196]  What we know is they've been caught adding stuff in these injections that has nothing to do with the supposed pathogen they're trying to create immunity for.
[03:04:26.196 --> 03:04:28.518]  So that to me is the gigantic enchilada.
[03:04:28.518 --> 03:04:29.820]  Thank you, Patrick.
[03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:31.942]  But yeah, all of it's open for discussion.
[03:04:31.942 --> 03:04:34.485]  How dare anyone say we shouldn't have a discussion?
[03:04:35.026 --> 03:04:43.453]  Anybody that says we shouldn't have David Icke on, or we shouldn't have David Knight on, or we shouldn't have Dr. Boyle on, or we shouldn't have anybody on, is a cult member.
[03:04:43.453 --> 03:04:47.776]  And I'm not in some damn cult, but I'm on the payroll of Big Pharma.
[03:04:47.776 --> 03:04:48.677]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:48.677 --> 03:04:50.058]  I'm on the payroll of the people.
[03:04:50.058 --> 03:04:50.639]  Stay with us.

[03:06:12.145 --> 03:06:20.811]  We've got to move quick because I've got one more big news item I need to hit before David Knight comes in and takes over today.
[03:06:20.811 --> 03:06:24.033]  He's got some things to say.
[03:06:24.033 --> 03:06:27.596]  But EJ in California, then Ruben in Texas.
[03:06:27.596 --> 03:06:29.737]  EJ, you're on the air.
[03:06:29.737 --> 03:06:31.078]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[03:06:31.078 --> 03:06:31.599]  I sure can.
[03:06:31.599 --> 03:06:33.020]  Thanks for calling.
[03:06:33.020 --> 03:06:33.680]  You're welcome.
[03:06:33.680 --> 03:06:35.882]  So I'm a longtime listener, first time caller.
[03:06:35.882 --> 03:06:37.883]  You woke me up to the double narrative in 2011 with Fukushima.
[03:06:39.884 --> 03:06:45.706]  And I know I'm not supposed to thank you, but without leadership and without vision, the Bible says that people perish.
[03:06:45.706 --> 03:06:52.729]  And I hate to think where we, the people, would be without you guys courageously... Well, EJ, I just want to thank you.
[03:06:52.729 --> 03:06:54.189]  And look, I mean, I'm glad I've been here.
[03:06:54.189 --> 03:06:55.610]  I'm glad I was awake.
[03:06:55.610 --> 03:06:57.951]  I just don't want to make it like these other talk shows.
[03:06:57.951 --> 03:07:02.853]  Like I heard Limbaugh, and God bless him, I hope he beats the cancer, but he's like, Impromptu did a good job.
[03:07:02.853 --> 03:07:04.813]  I'm not giving my show.
[03:07:04.813 --> 03:07:06.194]  You want to come audition?
[03:07:07.150 --> 03:07:08.914]  And it's that arrogance, man.
[03:07:08.914 --> 03:07:10.838]  We're under total attack.
[03:07:10.838 --> 03:07:12.482]  And so I'm fighting back against evil.
[03:07:13.991 --> 03:07:16.312]  That's not some special thing!
[03:07:16.312 --> 03:07:22.875]  Like, if somebody walks up to me at a picnic at the park and started attacking my children, I'm gonna fight them really hard.
[03:07:22.875 --> 03:07:25.957]  I might get my ass kicked, but they're about to... I'm about to try to kill them.
[03:07:25.957 --> 03:07:30.839]  And I don't want my wife to say, man, you're really... I would expect my wife to say, hey, good job.
[03:07:30.839 --> 03:07:33.080]  I expect her to go, yeah, you did what you're supposed to.
[03:07:33.080 --> 03:07:35.321]  In fact, if I need help, I expect her to join in.
[03:07:35.321 --> 03:07:36.862]  Do you get what I'm saying?
[03:07:36.862 --> 03:07:40.064]  It's not heroic to fight exterminists coming for you.
[03:07:40.064 --> 03:07:41.524]  It is the default position.
[03:07:41.524 --> 03:07:42.385]  Does that make sense, EJ?
[03:07:43.439 --> 03:07:44.439]  It totally does.
[03:07:44.439 --> 03:07:45.120]  Sorry, I'm going to shut up.
[03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:47.341]  Go ahead.
[03:07:47.341 --> 03:07:57.225]  Well, yesterday I woke up with a scratchy throat and decided to stay home from work and called my IT department and the person who was helping to set me up remotely lives in the Philippines.
[03:07:57.225 --> 03:08:01.227]  And so I started making small talk and asked her how she was experiencing COVID-19.
[03:08:02.708 --> 03:08:15.693]  And she lives just north of Manila and she started telling me that she's only able to leave her house once a week and that a local official in a mask comes to her door, gives her a piece of paper so she can leave her house.
[03:08:15.693 --> 03:08:16.633]  Oh yeah, I read that.
[03:08:16.633 --> 03:08:19.414]  The Philippines has the worst martial law on the planet.
[03:08:19.414 --> 03:08:21.375]  You leave your house for like two hours once a week.
[03:08:22.665 --> 03:08:26.268]  Yeah, she has to go on to Facebook, so they tell her when to leave her home.
[03:08:26.268 --> 03:08:29.210]  Well, you talk about job security for the cops and bureaucrats, man.
[03:08:29.210 --> 03:08:34.054]  I mean, this is a disgusting wet dream where you can't go to the park unless they say so.
[03:08:34.054 --> 03:08:35.695]  Disgusting.
[03:08:35.695 --> 03:08:36.155]  Exactly.
[03:08:36.155 --> 03:08:40.279]  By the way, I guarantee you Robert Barnes is going to sue where this woman got arrested.
[03:08:40.279 --> 03:08:43.381]  Stories on Infowars.com.
[03:08:43.381 --> 03:08:44.362]  Awesome.
[03:08:44.362 --> 03:08:50.887]  But yeah, she was saying that if they're caught violating the order that they're arrested and taken to a public holding square for like six hours.
[03:08:51.587 --> 03:08:56.069]  Where for quote, they have to be there, sit there for lectures and contemplation.
[03:08:56.069 --> 03:09:10.414]  And so she was telling me too that the district that she lived in, they created what's called the rat challenge where people who go to the wet market will get paid a reward for whoever catches and traps the most rats in order to keep the markets clean.
[03:09:10.414 --> 03:09:15.856]  And I was just sitting there thinking, this sounds like Nazi Germany, and I was feeling so bad for her.
[03:09:15.856 --> 03:09:20.718]  And then I realized, wait a second, that's going to be us unless we take a stand now.
[03:09:21.596 --> 03:09:32.903]  And so I just wanted to say, I decided this week to come out of the closet as an info warrior and started posting your articles and sharing the truth.
[03:09:32.903 --> 03:09:42.210]  And it's just like the prophet Jeremiah, I feel like, who said, you can only hear the truth for so long before it comes to fire in your bones and you have to share it.
[03:09:42.210 --> 03:09:43.631]  And I just, you're right.
[03:09:43.631 --> 03:09:48.434]  Alex, courage is contagious because I've started posting and sharing the truth with my friends.
[03:09:48.434 --> 03:09:50.015]  They've started sharing the articles too.
[03:09:51.065 --> 03:09:53.571]  And you're right, we are the answer.
[03:09:53.571 --> 03:09:57.399]  And thank you, too, for creating the Open to Open America website.
[03:09:57.399 --> 03:09:59.905]  I've been trying to log on since yesterday.
[03:10:01.718 --> 03:10:12.721]  There's like a pop-up window that says the site is blocked due to it being a security threat, so I don't know what's going on there, but I'm just trying to get information and to be able to attend a rally in Sacramento.
[03:10:12.721 --> 03:10:17.143]  I heard Owen mention and was hoping to come join you guys in Austin, but I don't know.
[03:10:17.143 --> 03:10:24.565]  Well, we're not a big company, so once we get stuff launched, it usually does pretty good, but I'm getting a lot of calls about people not being able to go to the website.
[03:10:25.766 --> 03:10:26.967]  I just try as best I can.
[03:10:26.967 --> 03:10:28.648]  It's a real frustration point, believe me.
[03:10:28.648 --> 03:10:30.408]  But we're going to have a big rally here.
[03:10:30.408 --> 03:10:31.429]  It's Saturday in Austin.
[03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:32.790]  There will be rallies all over the country.
[03:10:32.790 --> 03:10:33.890]  It's very, very important.
[03:10:33.890 --> 03:10:36.832]  But the point you get at there is that
[03:10:37.881 --> 03:10:42.763]  There is a chain reaction happening like Jeremiah with the fire in the bones, and it's a beautiful thing.
[03:10:42.763 --> 03:10:46.045]  And we have to do it now because all the denial is over.
[03:10:46.045 --> 03:10:47.606]  This is world government out in the open.
[03:10:47.606 --> 03:10:50.267]  They admit the vaccine wouldn't protect you from this anyways.
[03:10:50.267 --> 03:10:50.927]  Then what is it?
[03:10:50.927 --> 03:10:52.968]  Well, he says, oh, it's going to have a digital ink.
[03:10:52.968 --> 03:10:55.950]  So we'll have a new Microsoft computer code to buy and sell.
[03:10:56.730 --> 03:11:03.736]  And then, literally, if you go to Bandot Video or InfoWars, any article about the Mark of the Beast, there's all these people going, you're going to hell, Jones.
[03:11:03.736 --> 03:11:04.537]  You're a false prophet.
[03:11:04.537 --> 03:11:06.138]  This is not Mark of the Beast.
[03:11:06.138 --> 03:11:08.040]  We are raptured first.
[03:11:08.040 --> 03:11:16.427]  And, I mean, they're never going to fight the Mark of the Beast because they believe the rapture ideology that they don't have to face the devil or go through this.
[03:11:17.268 --> 03:11:19.430]  And so they support Bill Gates.
[03:11:19.430 --> 03:11:21.272]  They support Satan.
[03:11:21.272 --> 03:11:25.657]  And they're so mad at me because they can't believe they're not going to get teleported out.
[03:11:25.657 --> 03:11:34.086]  The Revelation says the dead in Christ are raised up after the devil is bound and put into the pit by the archangel.
[03:11:34.086 --> 03:11:35.308]  A five-year-old could read that.
[03:11:35.788 --> 03:11:43.193]  And I'm not bashing Christians that watch all the big shows of Left Behind and want to believe all this, but they're all going to take the mark.
[03:11:43.193 --> 03:11:45.054]  They're all going to submit to the beast.
[03:11:45.054 --> 03:11:47.615]  They're going to turn their kids over to the pedophiles, too.
[03:11:47.615 --> 03:11:50.197]  Their churches are going to put chips in them, like, oh, it's not the Lord.
[03:11:50.197 --> 03:11:52.238]  Oh, you love chip.
[03:11:52.238 --> 03:11:58.562]  And I'm not being sarcastic because it can't be the mark because they're going to be raptured.
[03:11:58.562 --> 03:11:59.523]  You understand?
[03:11:59.523 --> 03:12:00.223]  Thank you, EJ.
[03:12:00.223 --> 03:12:01.244]  I really appreciate your call.
[03:12:03.217 --> 03:12:05.118]  Let's go ahead and talk to Reuben in Texas.
[03:12:05.118 --> 03:12:07.339]  Reuben, thanks for calling.
[03:12:07.339 --> 03:12:07.819]  Hey, Alex.
[03:12:07.819 --> 03:12:09.099]  Thanks so much for taking my call, man.
[03:12:09.099 --> 03:12:09.580]  I appreciate it.
[03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:10.680]  Appreciate you, brother.
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:22.665]  Before I get to my point, I just wanted to say, if it wasn't for you hammering the Chai Com, hammering or just bringing communism and its bloody history to our attention over the years, me, it was 2012 where I started listening.
[03:12:22.665 --> 03:12:24.986]  So just appreciate that, man.
[03:12:24.986 --> 03:12:30.188]  But yeah, to get to my point, I woke up this morning, Austin, Texas.
[03:12:30.188 --> 03:12:32.349]  I'm listening to the Travis County Scanner, right?
[03:12:33.093 --> 03:12:49.076]  And I hear a report coming from the dispatchers saying that a customer at a local privately owned, I think, tool shop or something along those lines had reported another customer for not wearing a mask.
[03:12:49.076 --> 03:12:55.557]  And, you know, so the dispatchers asking officers, hey, can, you know, can we do anything about that?
[03:12:55.557 --> 03:12:59.138]  And then the officers was responding, well, you know, if it wasn't management,
[03:12:59.580 --> 03:13:01.361]  Oh yeah, this is like the worst of L.A.
[03:13:01.361 --> 03:13:01.621]  here now.
[03:13:01.621 --> 03:13:02.841]  But notice, it's like the burqa.
[03:13:02.841 --> 03:13:03.982]  We're worried about women wearing burqas.
[03:13:03.982 --> 03:13:07.883]  We all wear this burqa to show the shame that we're a human and we can be a carrier.
[03:13:07.883 --> 03:13:08.584]  We're a bad person.
[03:13:29.491 --> 03:13:30.332]  Right, right.
[03:13:30.332 --> 03:13:48.663]  And I have people close to me on the West Coast, man, that actually are in the military, and they went to the commissary this morning, and the commissary being the grocery store on base, and you know, one of them was wearing a mask, and they lifted it up to simply take a deep breath, and were berated right then and there, you know, reminded to wear their mask.
[03:13:49.008 --> 03:13:51.670]  There's MPs all outside the commissary, dude.
[03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:53.171]  It's nuts.
[03:13:53.171 --> 03:14:00.936]  Oh yeah, and again, it's all the bureaucracy, and you have less than one-tenth of one percent dying from it in L.A.
[03:14:00.936 --> 03:14:02.217]  County, but people don't care.
[03:14:02.217 --> 03:14:07.601]  And meanwhile, they're going to get the Depression, they're going to get bankruptcy, they're going to be homeless, they don't care.
[03:14:07.601 --> 03:14:10.723]  It's so much fun to go suppress the American people.
[03:14:10.723 --> 03:14:14.946]  The good news is, the governor's waking up in Texas, and when Owen was out there Saturday,
[03:14:15.566 --> 03:14:19.372]  Demonstrating outside the Capitol grounds, because he's making you get a permit to be on the Capitol grounds.
[03:14:19.372 --> 03:14:20.995]  State police said, no, come up here, do it here.
[03:14:20.995 --> 03:14:21.936]  The governor wants you to.
[03:14:21.936 --> 03:14:24.580]  So the governor and Trump know what's happening.
[03:14:24.580 --> 03:14:25.742]  They're fighting it, brother.
[03:14:25.742 --> 03:14:26.543]  God bless you, Reuben.
[03:14:26.543 --> 03:14:28.807]  All right, David Nikes, Post Takeover.
[03:14:29.855 --> 03:14:32.657]  Because I wanted him to come in today and be able to talk about some of the stuff he's been covering.
[03:14:32.657 --> 03:14:34.379]  He goes weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[03:14:34.379 --> 03:14:34.859]  to 11 a.m.
[03:14:34.859 --> 03:14:35.399]  when I come on.
[03:14:35.399 --> 03:14:36.340]  He'll be here.
[03:14:36.340 --> 03:14:37.401]  I've got one more segment.
[03:14:37.401 --> 03:14:42.145]  He'll call us for the next segment, and then he'll take over for a couple of segments ahead of the war with Owen Schroer.
[03:14:42.145 --> 03:14:46.568]  But Ryan, Tara, and Sonny, I keep saying this.
[03:14:46.568 --> 03:14:47.589]  It's not anybody's fault.
[03:14:47.589 --> 03:14:49.710]  I guess I forget every day when we take calls.
[03:14:49.710 --> 03:14:52.332]  Is there a way to get their name and number into Mara?
[03:14:52.332 --> 03:14:55.855]  Have we ever done that, John, where we actually call the callers back?
[03:14:55.855 --> 03:14:57.817]  We are calling callers back the next day.
[03:14:58.749 --> 03:15:01.811]  Could we all get them on as guests at 11.30 tomorrow?
[03:15:01.811 --> 03:15:05.393]  Then it's up to you to make me at 11.30, talk to Sonny, Tara, and Ryan.
[03:15:05.393 --> 03:15:06.914]  All three of them get like five minutes.
[03:15:06.914 --> 03:15:07.634]  We love them.
[03:15:07.634 --> 03:15:12.617]  We appreciate them holding for, you know, one person an hour and something minutes, another person an hour and 19 minutes.
[03:15:12.617 --> 03:15:13.758]  But I tried as best I could.
[03:15:13.758 --> 03:15:15.139]  We got to go to break.
[03:15:15.139 --> 03:15:19.001]  David Knight is coming up, but I got to hit this predictive programming piece.
[03:15:19.001 --> 03:15:21.843]  Well, there's actually a couple of them we're going to hit.
[03:15:21.843 --> 03:15:24.824]  Spirit Cooking over a decade ago on The Simpsons.
[03:15:26.226 --> 03:15:31.690]  How that ties into a huge satanic ritual at the 2012 Olympics.
[03:15:31.690 --> 03:15:37.935]  We'll get David Knight in here with me to talk about that next segment, and then he will take over for two segments here today.
[03:15:37.935 --> 03:15:40.898]  But what huge news!
[03:15:40.898 --> 03:15:51.085]  What massive news that the LA Health Department says you've got less than one-tenth of one percent chance of dying if you get COVID-19.
[03:15:53.516 --> 03:15:58.577]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[03:15:58.577 --> 03:16:03.939]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[03:16:03.939 --> 03:16:11.981]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[03:16:23.032 --> 03:16:24.253]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:24.253 --> 03:16:28.154]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:28.154 --> 03:16:29.695]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:29.695 --> 03:16:32.657]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:32.657 --> 03:16:38.219]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:38.219 --> 03:16:39.420]  I can help you, too.

[03:16:52.921 --> 03:16:54.182]  Maybe not today.
[03:16:54.182 --> 03:16:55.462]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[03:16:55.462 --> 03:16:59.204]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[03:16:59.204 --> 03:17:00.284]  Forget bunkers.
[03:17:00.284 --> 03:17:02.105]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[03:17:02.105 --> 03:17:03.826]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[03:18:00.641 --> 03:18:07.407]  And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us, shutting us down, and making us dependent on them.
[03:18:07.407 --> 03:18:09.469]  The food shortages have begun.
[03:18:09.469 --> 03:18:12.392]  The depression is going to be long and very, very serious.
[03:18:12.392 --> 03:18:14.594]  In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[03:18:14.594 --> 03:18:15.535]  Trump tried to stop it.
[03:18:16.095 --> 03:18:18.637]  But the mainstream media, working with the triad comms, blocked it.
[03:18:18.637 --> 03:18:23.161]  That's why you and myself, everybody else, has to get prepared now.
[03:18:23.161 --> 03:18:23.961]  Do not wait.
[03:18:23.961 --> 03:18:24.882]  It's not about the virus.
[03:18:24.882 --> 03:18:29.546]  It's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year.

[03:18:36.511 --> 03:18:37.993]  There are major shortages.
[03:18:38.553 --> 03:18:43.454]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism.
[03:18:43.454 --> 03:18:46.695]  But we, the people, the patriots, have to be prepared.
[03:18:46.695 --> 03:18:48.615]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far.

[03:19:49.726 --> 03:19:56.507]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:56.507 --> 03:19:59.168]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.242 --> 03:20:19.384]  In 1994.
[03:20:21.857 --> 03:20:31.585]  The Simpsons aired a piece about spirit cooking, where you chop up little children, grind them into sausages, and eat them.
[03:20:31.585 --> 03:20:34.347]  Hitler had his blood taken and put in little sausages.
[03:20:34.347 --> 03:20:38.130]  He had the higher levels of the SS take, like it was Christ blood.
[03:20:38.130 --> 03:20:47.377]  And with this devil worshiper lady the New York Times has been promoting, attacking us for criticizing, you know, she bloodlets herself and people drink her blood.
[03:20:47.377 --> 03:20:49.980]  But she says it's not Satanism, David Knight.
[03:20:50.620 --> 03:20:52.621]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:20:52.621 --> 03:20:53.621]  Nothing to see here.
[03:20:53.621 --> 03:20:55.022]  Let's move on.
[03:20:55.022 --> 03:20:58.903]  Before you take over, I wanted to just hit this because this has been really hot on the internet.
[03:20:58.903 --> 03:21:00.704]  We covered it back eight years ago.
[03:21:00.704 --> 03:21:06.366]  Predictive programming, internet notes, eerie similarities between 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
[03:21:06.366 --> 03:21:08.047]  We'll roll some B-roll of that.
[03:21:08.047 --> 03:21:10.088]  And coronavirus pandemic.
[03:21:10.088 --> 03:21:13.669]  This is mass pandemics with the Spanish flu in 1918.
[03:21:13.669 --> 03:21:15.010]  A grim reaper over them.
[03:21:15.630 --> 03:21:21.494]  And then after, it even shows the Grim Reaper right there, lording over small children and destroying them.
[03:21:21.494 --> 03:21:28.679]  The earth is reborn and a new age of goodness begins when the Grim Reaper kills the children in their beds.
[03:21:28.679 --> 03:21:31.942]  And there's even a big COVID-type cold virus.
[03:21:31.942 --> 03:21:34.884]  It is a coronavirus right there at the center of it.
[03:21:34.884 --> 03:21:37.466]  Why do you think they flaunt such things like this?
[03:21:38.322 --> 03:21:48.771]  Well, you see this type of stuff all the time in terms of symbolism that they have at the CERN Center when they had their bizarre opening ceremony that they had there.
[03:21:48.771 --> 03:21:50.713]  But this is very specific, isn't it?
[03:21:50.713 --> 03:21:51.554]  I hadn't seen this yet.
[03:21:51.554 --> 03:21:52.695]  This is pretty amazing.
[03:21:52.695 --> 03:21:54.837]  Grim Reaper and the COVID-19.
[03:21:54.837 --> 03:21:56.818]  And a symphony of death killing the children.
[03:21:56.818 --> 03:21:57.299]  Yeah.
[03:21:57.679 --> 03:21:58.099]  Yeah.
[03:21:58.099 --> 03:22:07.908]  Well, you know, that's kind of interesting because, you know, Michael Moore has come out with his new documentary called Planet of the Humans, and he says, you know, we were lied to about all this renewable energy and everything.
[03:22:07.908 --> 03:22:09.049]  It's bunk.
[03:22:09.049 --> 03:22:10.971]  And these people are just doing this to make money.
[03:22:10.971 --> 03:22:12.212]  Imagine that.
[03:22:12.212 --> 03:22:13.894]  He kind of figured that out, finally.
[03:22:13.894 --> 03:22:17.257]  But his solution is, of course, the same thing.
[03:22:17.257 --> 03:22:18.018]  Kill all the kids.
[03:22:18.018 --> 03:22:19.099]  Don't have any more children.
[03:22:19.099 --> 03:22:20.300]  We've got to reduce the population.
[03:22:20.600 --> 03:22:21.701]  And look at this, this is eight years ago.
[03:22:21.701 --> 03:22:28.047]  Drones with witches flying around on brooms, killing children and sucking them into a black hole.
[03:22:28.047 --> 03:22:29.369]  Keep going.
[03:22:29.369 --> 03:22:31.891]  Well, you know, it's always the same solution, isn't it?
[03:22:31.891 --> 03:22:38.017]  It doesn't matter whether it's a coronavirus or whether it is the, wow, it's just amazing.
[03:22:38.017 --> 03:22:39.058]  It doesn't matter if it's a coronavirus.
[03:22:39.058 --> 03:22:40.339]  It's always child sacrifice.
[03:22:40.339 --> 03:22:42.421]  Look, the Grim Reaper is drawing the child up.
[03:22:42.421 --> 03:22:43.162]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:22:43.769 --> 03:22:49.336]  Well, you know, 50 years ago, the first Earth Day, they were talking about we're going to have global cooling.
[03:22:49.336 --> 03:22:51.398]  It was going to be a new ice age, so we had to kill all the kids.
[03:22:51.398 --> 03:22:53.221]  And it was immediately as global warming.
[03:22:53.221 --> 03:22:56.925]  They did a complete 180, but the solution remained the same.
[03:22:56.925 --> 03:22:59.568]  No matter what it is, it's always... Save the surprise!
[03:23:00.922 --> 03:23:02.863]  And see, that's what this all is.
[03:23:02.863 --> 03:23:05.305]  The Pope says we deserve to die for the Earth.
[03:23:05.305 --> 03:23:10.127]  They're openly giving us their one-world religion, their carbon tax, shutting our economy off.
[03:23:10.127 --> 03:23:14.510]  And when we submit we believe we're saving our economy, we're destroying our economy, David.
[03:23:14.510 --> 03:23:19.733]  Yeah, you know, he said we've sinned against the Earth, and there were a lot of Orthodox Catholics that pointed out
[03:23:20.553 --> 03:23:30.540]  Back in the fall, when they brought in this Pacamama thing from the Amazon, they had a bunch of Orthodox Catholics threw it in the river there.
[03:23:30.540 --> 03:23:33.122]  But now he's saying we've offended the earth.
[03:23:33.122 --> 03:23:40.987]  And this is basically what we've seen from Aaron Darnofsky and Jennifer Lawrence, you know, when they did Mother!
[03:23:40.987 --> 03:23:49.012]  But, you know, Alex, when he's talking about this and talking about carbon taxes, of course, he's also coming from the liberation theology, you know, the Marxism.
[03:23:51.194 --> 03:23:51.934]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:24:09.065 --> 03:24:14.128]  They're going to do that by shutting down the food supply and also shutting down energy.
[03:24:14.128 --> 03:24:20.992]  You've got AOC celebrating the fact that you had negative prices on some futures contracts on oil.
[03:24:20.992 --> 03:24:22.173]  She loves to see that.
[03:24:22.173 --> 03:24:24.334]  A shutdown is good of the earth!
[03:24:24.334 --> 03:24:28.217]  Even though Venezuela is causing mass deaths of their own people.
[03:24:28.217 --> 03:24:31.839]  Since we mentioned it, here's more predictive programming.
[03:24:31.839 --> 03:24:34.841]  Again, right here you have the Grim Reaper overlooking
[03:24:35.973 --> 03:24:41.295]  Children with little grim reapers grabbing them and killing them and giving them to him.
[03:24:41.295 --> 03:24:45.217]  And this being worshipped at the London Games eight years ago at the Olympics.
[03:24:45.217 --> 03:24:51.640]  Here is 1994, so I guess that's 26 years ago.
[03:24:51.640 --> 03:24:55.501]  I wasn't even, I was just about to get on air then.
[03:24:55.501 --> 03:25:00.484]  Here they are, ladies and gentlemen, showing you what spirit cooking is.
[03:25:04.364 --> 03:25:05.084]  Mmm.
[03:25:05.084 --> 03:25:07.465]  Uh, you just cut in line, didn't you?
[03:25:07.465 --> 03:25:08.805]  Report to detention, Uter.
[03:25:08.805 --> 03:25:10.165]  For how long?
[03:25:10.165 --> 03:25:16.226]  Oh, about seven minutes a pound should do it.
[03:25:16.226 --> 03:25:18.307]  Okay, I got your German grub right here.
[03:25:18.307 --> 03:25:27.628]  Bart, does it strike you as odd that Uter disappeared and suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called Uterbraten?
[03:25:27.628 --> 03:25:29.148]  Oh, relax, kids.
[03:25:29.148 --> 03:25:31.849]  I've got a gut feeling Uter's around here somewhere.
[03:25:33.807 --> 03:25:36.188]  After all, isn't there a little ooder and all of it?
[03:25:36.188 --> 03:25:43.430]  And again, if they can put child flavoring in Pepsi, if they can, it's like the Golden Child, they try to feed him the blood of a sacrificed child to corrupt him.
[03:25:43.430 --> 03:25:50.292]  They're showing you, every child's the Golden Child, and they believe satanically they can corrupt you, that somehow it gives them entry.
[03:25:50.292 --> 03:25:51.372]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:25:51.372 --> 03:25:53.913]  And this is something that's been widespread in Hollywood.
[03:25:53.913 --> 03:25:55.153]  So let's go to the next clip.
[03:25:55.153 --> 03:26:02.655]  There's a longer one of this, but here they are in 1993, talking about a virus meant to bring in total tyranny.
[03:26:07.058 --> 03:26:08.839]  Okay, that's a wrong one, but in post, this is live.
[03:26:08.839 --> 03:26:13.742]  No big deal, but in post, please, pretty cupcake, please.
[03:26:13.742 --> 03:26:17.363]  We played it probably ten times last month.
[03:26:17.363 --> 03:26:17.964]  It is titled...
[03:26:35.606 --> 03:26:39.730]  Simpsons 1993 predicted COVID-19 lockdown.
[03:26:39.730 --> 03:26:51.542]  And they're sitting around going, we're going to use the release of a virus, but a real one, to kill a certain amount of people, to cause a giant panic and the shutdown of civilization to have full control and force inoculation.
[03:26:51.542 --> 03:26:53.003]  And they're just throwing it in their face.
[03:26:53.003 --> 03:26:53.343]  Yeah.
[03:26:53.343 --> 03:26:55.165]  Well, you know, they've gotten what they wanted.
[03:26:55.165 --> 03:26:58.068]  I mean, you know, as they look at this, I look at 50 years,
[03:26:59.489 --> 03:27:02.130]  Of what's going on with climate change.
[03:27:02.130 --> 03:27:04.771]  In about 50 days, they've been able to do this globally.
[03:27:04.771 --> 03:27:07.411]  They've been able to implement the Green New Deal.
[03:27:07.411 --> 03:27:11.672]  We could call it, I guess, the CDC New Deal, or the NIH New Deal, or the COVID New Deal.
[03:27:11.672 --> 03:27:14.393]  But they've been able to get everything that they want, Alex.
[03:27:14.393 --> 03:27:16.654]  And it just continues to go.
[03:27:16.654 --> 03:27:22.335]  And what they want is they want us to have a society that's based on austerity.
[03:27:22.335 --> 03:27:23.476]  They take down our standard of living.
[03:27:23.476 --> 03:27:25.256]  They want to eliminate families.
[03:27:25.256 --> 03:27:25.596]  And surveillance.
[03:27:25.596 --> 03:27:26.837]  This is their whole... Oh yeah.
[03:27:26.837 --> 03:27:28.337]  And I know a clip we can have.
[03:27:28.817 --> 03:27:31.297]  It's the John Roberts we played five times today.
[03:27:31.297 --> 03:27:32.938]  We're going to come out of break when you take over.
[03:27:32.938 --> 03:27:35.058]  We're going to play that John Roberts clip.
[03:27:35.058 --> 03:27:37.319]  Because everybody ignores the fact that the health department is saying this.
[03:27:37.319 --> 03:27:38.739]  This is a real video.
[03:27:38.739 --> 03:27:40.359]  That it's less than 1%.
[03:27:40.359 --> 03:27:42.319]  It's a fraction that are dying.
[03:27:42.319 --> 03:27:43.380]  Everybody's like, is this real?
[03:27:43.380 --> 03:27:48.621]  Because it's John Roberts, the authority figure, going, this is a bunch of crap, a hoax, my God, take your mask off.
[03:27:48.621 --> 03:27:50.681]  Well, he doesn't know the camera's on.
[03:27:50.681 --> 03:27:55.782]  So everybody's freaked out about that clip instead of... It's the health department admitting it.
[03:27:55.782 --> 03:27:56.502]  Yeah.
[03:27:56.502 --> 03:27:56.722]  Oh, yeah.
[03:27:57.290 --> 03:27:59.971]  All right, David Knight's about to take over for 30 minutes.
[03:27:59.971 --> 03:28:00.692]  We appreciate everybody.
[03:28:00.692 --> 03:28:01.812]  And then the war room's coming up.
[03:28:01.812 --> 03:28:12.358]  And then, like I said, if you're watching this in post later, double cupcakes, triple frosties with little cherries on top.
[03:28:12.358 --> 03:28:15.119]  We're going to have that clip for you because it's amazing.
[03:28:15.119 --> 03:28:17.641]  And I will start my show tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[03:28:17.641 --> 03:28:22.143]  Central with that clip because it's so powerful to show how they're throwing at your face.
[03:28:22.603 --> 03:28:23.844]  All right, David Knight takes over.
[03:28:23.844 --> 03:28:26.286]  Please don't forget the only word here on air is your word of mouth.
[03:28:26.286 --> 03:28:29.409]  I want to reach people and warn them about the hoax, about the tyranny, about the evils.
[03:28:29.409 --> 03:28:31.110]  So tell folks about Bandai Video.
[03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:35.374]  Tell folks about all the great shows like David Knight, and of course, the world with Owen Schroyer and myself.
[03:28:35.374 --> 03:28:37.896]  And send out those videos, because if you don't do it, nobody will.
[03:28:37.896 --> 03:28:40.018]  And remember, we've got great products as well.
[03:28:40.018 --> 03:28:44.421]  Yeah, the virus is overblown and a hoax, but the martial law and depression's real.

[03:29:54.042 --> 03:29:56.224]  The official numbers are now in.
[03:29:56.224 --> 03:30:00.968]  The United States is in the biggest financial collapse in our history.
[03:30:00.968 --> 03:30:03.170]  This is the worst employment collapse in U.S.
[03:30:03.170 --> 03:30:08.114]  history by a very wide margin, writes Michael Snyder, the Economic Collapse Blog.
[03:30:08.114 --> 03:30:13.899]  At this point, we should no longer speak of economic collapse as something that will happen in the future.
[03:30:13.899 --> 03:30:15.300]  It is now here.
[03:30:15.300 --> 03:30:20.124]  And he does an excellent job in the article on Infowars.com of laying it out.
[03:30:20.444 --> 03:30:22.787]  This was done by design.
[03:30:22.787 --> 03:30:38.444]  Trump fought to open the economy, but the hijacked blue cities and states with the tricoms and with Hollywood and the media held America underwater until we sucked it into our lungs and now we're lying there like a fish dying.
[03:30:38.444 --> 03:30:40.306]  There's not much time to get the water out of our lungs.
[03:30:40.626 --> 03:30:48.727]  So remember, for decades to come, when millions starve to death worldwide and you live in slums with no medicine, the globalists did this!
[03:30:48.727 --> 03:30:50.388]  The globalists did this!
[03:30:50.388 --> 03:30:51.908]  The globalists did this!
[03:30:51.908 --> 03:30:54.168]  The globalists did this!
[03:30:54.168 --> 03:31:09.031]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level, on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[03:31:09.031 --> 03:31:09.351]  That is
[03:31:09.811 --> 03:31:25.828]  Hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19, and the very people that cooked it up and gave me the chi-coms at the World Health Organization, with Bill Gates involved, are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[03:31:26.028 --> 03:31:27.089]  This is insane.
[03:31:27.089 --> 03:31:29.770]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[03:31:29.770 --> 03:31:31.211]  You need to get prepared now.
[03:31:31.211 --> 03:31:35.753]  You need to get high-quality, storable food now back in stock at InfowarStore.com.
[03:31:35.753 --> 03:31:39.855]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[03:31:39.855 --> 03:31:46.118]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[03:31:46.118 --> 03:31:47.479]  This is beyond 1984.
[03:31:47.479 --> 03:31:49.700]  The tyranny of the dual order is here.
[03:31:49.700 --> 03:31:52.121]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the Infowar.
[03:31:52.121 --> 03:31:53.522]  You are the Paul Reveres!
[03:31:54.162 --> 03:32:01.066]  There's a process where you take a stallion and you tie him down and you cut his testicles off and then he becomes gelded.
[03:32:01.066 --> 03:32:03.808]  Well, that's what's happening to the entire world right now.
[03:32:03.808 --> 03:32:05.889]  We're going into deep, deep tyranny.
[03:32:05.889 --> 03:32:08.730]  Places like North Korea and China are going into deeper tyranny as well.
[03:32:08.730 --> 03:32:10.391]  It's all directed by the UN.
[03:32:10.391 --> 03:32:12.753]  It's all a big, cooked up, giant plan.
[03:32:13.433 --> 03:32:18.815]  To absolutely take control of your life, bankrupt the economy, and make you dependent on the big mega banks.
[03:32:18.815 --> 03:32:26.119]  And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations, brainwash your kids the way they say, and have absolutely no freedom.
[03:32:26.119 --> 03:32:28.099]  And it's all happening, boom, overnight.
[03:32:28.099 --> 03:32:30.120]  This is a giant revolution.
[03:32:30.120 --> 03:32:33.642]  And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said, oh, it's just an extended spring break, two weeks.
[03:32:34.002 --> 03:32:36.805]  Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years.
[03:32:36.805 --> 03:32:37.946]  It never ends.
[03:32:37.946 --> 03:32:40.128]  No one can ever die from a virus again.
[03:32:40.128 --> 03:32:42.009]  Government will save you.
[03:32:42.009 --> 03:32:43.250]  It's a takeover.
[03:32:43.250 --> 03:32:44.011]  It's the opposite.
[03:32:44.011 --> 03:32:46.453]  They're coming with forced inoculations on record.
[03:32:46.453 --> 03:32:50.897]  They'll reduce your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases kill you.
[03:32:50.897 --> 03:32:57.643]  And they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[03:32:57.643 --> 03:33:00.286]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.981 --> 03:33:19.165]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.165 --> 03:33:21.586]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[03:33:21.586 --> 03:33:27.208]  Alright, this morning, I talked about the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, and that's actually
[03:33:32.625 --> 03:33:38.389]  A little bit fun to talk about that, because I've been watching these people spend these lives for a very long time.
[03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:41.211]  It's tempered by the fact that they've been able to get everything that they want.
[03:33:41.211 --> 03:33:44.194]  They don't realize that, but some of them do.
[03:33:44.194 --> 03:33:45.575]  AOC does.
[03:33:45.575 --> 03:33:49.718]  She's very excited that the oil business is melting down.
[03:33:49.718 --> 03:33:54.361]  The problem is, is that there isn't going to be electricity to run the hospitals in New York City, AOC.
[03:33:54.361 --> 03:33:56.443]  Maybe she doesn't understand that.
[03:33:56.443 --> 03:33:58.885]  And of course, it's not just energy.
[03:33:58.885 --> 03:34:00.186]  It's also food.
[03:34:01.403 --> 03:34:09.990]  As we see farmers destroying eggs, destroying fresh fruit, even potatoes in Idaho.
[03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:16.175]  You had a farmer last week, I talked about it, he was giving away about a million potatoes because he couldn't sell them.
[03:34:16.175 --> 03:34:16.856]  The chain
[03:34:17.859 --> 03:34:31.450]  Of customers, the supply chain had been disrupted with the shutdown of restaurants and we've got a lot of laws that are in place around the country that don't allow restaurants, even though they buy food, they process food, they make it, they deliver it to your table, but no, no, no.
[03:34:32.508 --> 03:34:38.610]  In LA, and in Boston, and in many other places, the restaurants are not allowed to sell the food as groceries.
[03:34:38.610 --> 03:34:45.592]  They can only go through the extra steps that have already been vetted by a local health department, but they are not allowing them to sell groceries.
[03:34:45.592 --> 03:34:47.272]  So they're basically just shutting them out.
[03:34:47.272 --> 03:34:49.693]  So he didn't have anybody to sell to.
[03:34:49.693 --> 03:34:56.315]  And he said, my farm's been in business for 133 years, but I'm not planting any more potatoes this season, this year.
[03:34:57.455 --> 03:35:12.349]  And so we see as this is all being shut down, as the oil is being shut down, it goes into negative territory, about negative $37 to get rid of a contract that was coming due, a futures contract.
[03:35:12.349 --> 03:35:15.111]  And so you think the oil producers are going to be producing any more oil?
[03:35:15.111 --> 03:35:19.075]  Do you think the potato farmers, the produce farmers in Florida,
[03:35:20.203 --> 03:35:29.147]  The egg and dairy producers who are being forced to pour their stuff down the drain or destroy it because they can't even give it away fast enough, do you think we're going to have that as well?
[03:35:29.147 --> 03:35:36.729]  I mean, we not only need electricity for the hospitals, we need food for the doctors and the nurses, even if you and I aren't important, right?
[03:35:36.729 --> 03:35:38.470]  How about medicine?
[03:35:38.470 --> 03:35:47.413]  When you start breaking the supply chain with these lockdowns and these shutdowns, something as, oh, well, it doesn't matter if we have the restaurants, right?
[03:35:47.413 --> 03:35:48.574]  Except it kills the farmers.
[03:35:49.724 --> 03:35:52.386]  And then that kills food production.
[03:35:52.386 --> 03:35:57.409]  And so, as we look at our way forward, there is some good news on the horizon.
[03:35:57.409 --> 03:36:04.194]  A lot of people are looking at the system that has now been imposed on us in a matter of just a few days.
[03:36:04.194 --> 03:36:10.399]  And they're saying, maybe we don't need the government permissions for all these things to begin with.
[03:36:10.399 --> 03:36:12.340]  A good example of this is what's happening in Wyoming.
[03:36:13.223 --> 03:36:22.047]  We have a new law there, as Reason is pointing out, that is probably the best food freedom law so far.
[03:36:22.047 --> 03:36:31.291]  They're saying that they've had a five-year-old law and they've been adding different amendments to it that would allow people to have illegal food transactions.
[03:36:31.291 --> 03:36:32.512]  Yes, this is the government.
[03:36:32.512 --> 03:36:38.915]  This is the government putting their power, their bureaucracy, ahead of you even being able to get food.
[03:36:38.915 --> 03:36:40.736]  And so they said they added an amendment
[03:36:41.454 --> 03:36:47.419]  That would add low-risk foods such as homemade jams to be sold in grocery stores, to be sold and consumed in restaurants.
[03:36:47.419 --> 03:36:50.101]  And then there was a new amendment passed last month.
[03:36:51.257 --> 03:36:52.838]  That is going to take effect in July.
[03:36:52.838 --> 03:36:57.901]  And they said the new amendment will allow them to do animal share.
[03:36:57.901 --> 03:37:00.943]  And so basically what they would do is get the U.S.
[03:37:00.943 --> 03:37:04.405]  Department of Agriculture and their inspectors out of the business.
[03:37:04.405 --> 03:37:16.072]  They would sell the animals to consumers, sell shares of the animals to the consumers, and then they would essentially let the consumers eventually have the animals.
[03:37:16.072 --> 03:37:18.753]  This is something that is not legal in the other 49 states.
[03:37:20.114 --> 03:37:21.585]  They said the idea for this bill is simple.
[03:37:22.386 --> 03:37:30.172]  A rancher on the board of the non-profit Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund said let ranchers and farmers sell herd shares for their animals.
[03:37:30.172 --> 03:37:37.378]  That way the entire herd is owned by all the customers before slaughter, thereby meeting the exemption standards of the federal law.
[03:37:37.378 --> 03:37:48.647]  Now the rancher doesn't have to jump through the hoops of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and can utilize the smaller mom-and-pop butchers that still exist in some of our small towns.
[03:37:48.647 --> 03:37:50.729]  I don't know if they exist in many towns because
[03:37:51.369 --> 03:37:56.990]  The mom-and-pop organizations are the ones that have been hit the hardest with these shutdowns.
[03:37:56.990 --> 03:38:13.413]  You know that the big retailers, the Walmarts, the Costcos and so forth, they're all still in business because they are going to enforce the rules of social distancing and mask wearing and hopping on your left leg, which is going to be coming up next week.
[03:38:13.413 --> 03:38:17.294]  No, it's the small mom-and-pops that are struggling for survival.
[03:38:17.294 --> 03:38:18.974]  If we can do things like this,
[03:38:20.435 --> 03:38:23.357]  Then we can come out of this a better country.
[03:38:23.357 --> 03:38:30.042]  Because we have to realize that the Constitution, we should at this point understand the Constitution is finally dead.
[03:38:30.042 --> 03:38:33.865]  You know, stick a fork in it, it's done.
[03:38:33.865 --> 03:38:39.170]  We want to be able to eat, but folks, we've got to do something about this.
[03:38:39.170 --> 03:38:47.636]  As we have quarantine time coming, we have four out of five parents, according to the UK, say, and that's about 80%,
[03:38:49.051 --> 03:38:54.855]  Say that they have stronger family bonds since they're spending more time together during the lockdown.
[03:38:54.855 --> 03:38:57.856]  They're getting together, they're playing board games, they're making puzzles.
[03:38:57.856 --> 03:39:02.999]  They said they found a quarter of families have picked up family gardening.
[03:39:02.999 --> 03:39:04.781]  It's a way for them to bond together.
[03:39:04.781 --> 03:39:07.302]  It's also a way to brighten up the backyard.
[03:39:07.302 --> 03:39:13.366]  It might be a way for you to survive if they completely destroy the food distribution.
[03:39:14.386 --> 03:39:19.648]  And make no mistake about it, you know, we have people who think they know better than you in Washington.
[03:39:19.648 --> 03:39:25.911]  The fatal conceit about all that is they don't even understand what they have broken at this point.
[03:39:25.911 --> 03:39:33.874]  You know, you've broken a lot of people's spirits to the extent that about 80% of them say, well, even if we are allowed to come back out, we don't know if we're going to do that right away.
[03:39:33.874 --> 03:39:35.955]  We might stay in place for quite some time.
[03:39:37.228 --> 03:39:44.015]  Those 20% who say they're going to do it right away, they're probably the 20% that are making the country run right now in the first place.
[03:39:44.015 --> 03:39:55.327]  The good news is that even though 63% of the people like the idea that government has taken more power over their lives, we've got about 40% or so that don't like that.
[03:39:59.278 --> 03:40:03.021]  that want to have the decisions in their lives made by them.
[03:40:03.021 --> 03:40:13.151]  And when we have people that are forced to do homeschooling, we've now got about 60 million families that have been forced into homeschooling because schools have been locked down.
[03:40:13.151 --> 03:40:18.295]  And they're starting to realize what homeschoolers have known all along.
[03:40:18.295 --> 03:40:23.260]  As they point out with this, not only have family bonds grown stronger, but community bonds have gotten stronger as well.
[03:40:23.260 --> 03:40:25.522]  You know all that stuff about socialization?
[03:40:26.536 --> 03:40:31.580]  That was simply to get you socialist.
[03:40:31.580 --> 03:40:34.382]  It was not about building community bonds.
[03:40:34.382 --> 03:40:46.751]  All of us who do homeschooling know that our kids related to people of all ages better than people who went through a rigidly age segregated environment like I did when I grew up.
[03:40:47.571 --> 03:40:49.192]  And I've seen the homeschoolers do this as well.
[03:40:49.192 --> 03:40:52.795]  Now they're saying that 62% of the parents report their children are more community-minded.
[03:40:52.795 --> 03:40:55.877]  About half the kids are running errands for their friends and neighbors.
[03:40:55.877 --> 03:41:01.382]  Nearly three in four respondents say their children are tasked with getting groceries for older people in their community.
[03:41:01.382 --> 03:41:04.944]  In other words, they're kind of helping little old ladies across the street.
[03:41:04.944 --> 03:41:05.445]  Imagine that.
[03:41:06.536 --> 03:41:09.597]  Imagine that, instead of being institutionalized.
[03:41:09.597 --> 03:41:15.160]  Also, 60% of the parents said that they're happier with their partner after just four weeks in quarantine.
[03:41:15.160 --> 03:41:30.226]  The reality is, is that as we're starting to experience some of these things, as we see the heavy handedness of the government protectors, you know, the people who say, well, we're here to protect you, but we're not going to let you have ventilators when they're telling everybody they needed ventilators.
[03:41:30.226 --> 03:41:33.188]  We're here to protect you, but we're going to stand in the way of tests.
[03:41:34.042 --> 03:41:39.664]  We're here to protect you, but we don't have any way that we can deliver masks and the tests that we sent out.
[03:41:39.664 --> 03:41:42.225]  They're already contaminated with coronavirus.
[03:41:42.225 --> 03:41:45.326]  That was the first round of tests that they sent out.
[03:41:45.326 --> 03:41:54.929]  As you start to see this, and you start to realize, maybe you start to realize, it's the same people who say that they're putting your health before everything else, the NIH.
[03:41:55.902 --> 03:42:06.529]  Have been funding, in spite of prohibitions, been funding gain of research, bioweapon research, both here in the United States and also giving $3.7 million to the Chinese.
[03:42:06.529 --> 03:42:08.631]  So what's up with this?
[03:42:08.631 --> 03:42:11.353]  Can we take these ideas and can we pull it back?
[03:42:11.353 --> 03:42:13.194]  I think it's too late to do anything about Washington.
[03:42:13.194 --> 03:42:18.218]  I've said for a long time, we've got to cut Washington off.
[03:42:18.218 --> 03:42:20.639]  It is a metastasizing cancer.
[03:42:20.639 --> 03:42:23.862]  And if you can't see that now, after what they have done to all of us,
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:28.902]  And how they have misallocated even this money that they call the CARES Act.
[03:42:28.902 --> 03:42:33.865]  Understand that it's spread as well to the governors in various places.
[03:42:33.865 --> 03:42:37.367]  I think what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to start creating communities.
[03:42:37.367 --> 03:42:39.348]  And we're going to have to start watching each other's backs.
[03:42:39.348 --> 03:42:44.191]  And those communities are going to be built up of families who are starting to come together.
[03:42:44.191 --> 03:42:44.972]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:44.972 --> 03:42:45.332]  Stay with us.
[03:42:53.186 --> 03:42:57.229]  This ad will only run for a couple days because it's about to sell out.
[03:42:57.229 --> 03:42:59.591]  I noticed, hey, we had a lot of Prostagard.
[03:42:59.591 --> 03:43:00.171]  People love it.
[03:43:00.171 --> 03:43:01.252]  We've got a lot of it.
[03:43:01.252 --> 03:43:03.513]  Why is it suddenly almost sold out?
[03:43:03.513 --> 03:43:10.759]  And I went, oh my gosh, it's an incredible formula, not just for the prostate, the salt palmetto that's on record for helping that.
[03:43:10.759 --> 03:43:19.645]  It's got everything, vitamin D, a big dose of that, a big dose of zinc, a big dose of selenium, copper, chromium, and a bunch of other stuff.
[03:43:19.645 --> 03:43:20.606]  This is
[03:43:21.266 --> 03:43:23.687]  The perfect formula for what's going on right now.
[03:43:23.687 --> 03:43:26.169]  And it's about to sell out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:26.169 --> 03:43:31.432]  And I want you to have it, so that after all this craziness passes, it becomes a normal regimen in your life.
[03:43:31.432 --> 03:43:34.034]  Because it's something, in my view, you need every day.
[03:43:34.034 --> 03:43:34.754]  Get it right now.
[03:43:34.754 --> 03:43:37.636]  Prostagard at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:37.636 --> 03:43:46.081]  And whatever you do, please warn others that Mother Nature has given us a lot of things that really help boost our overall health and wellness.
[03:43:53.448 --> 03:44:01.355]  Globalism is all about making the nation-state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[03:44:01.355 --> 03:44:13.845]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[03:44:13.845 --> 03:44:19.870]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out,
[03:44:20.430 --> 03:44:24.732]  They can simply look at us and say, because again, you are not essential.
[03:44:24.732 --> 03:44:27.754]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[03:44:27.754 --> 03:44:31.916]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[03:44:31.916 --> 03:44:35.738]  We can be told to stay in our houses, and after all, shut up!
[03:44:35.738 --> 03:44:37.379]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways.
[03:44:37.379 --> 03:44:41.901]  It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[03:44:41.901 --> 03:44:43.702]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[03:44:44.488 --> 03:44:47.631]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[03:44:47.631 --> 03:44:52.095]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.

[03:45:55.225 --> 03:46:01.373]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy use by half.
[03:46:01.373 --> 03:46:03.636]  And the United States wouldn't sign on to it.
[03:46:03.636 --> 03:46:04.797]  So guess what happened?
[03:46:04.797 --> 03:46:11.506]  Along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates is celebrating, saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[03:46:11.886 --> 03:46:15.228]  And that means you're going to be poor now, and under his control.
[03:46:15.228 --> 03:46:23.212]  And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the forced inoculations, a eek microchip that comes with the vaccine, and so much more.
[03:46:23.212 --> 03:46:28.195]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[03:46:28.195 --> 03:46:32.758]  So remember folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[03:46:33.118 --> 03:46:34.918]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:11.500 --> 03:47:12.560]  News.
[03:47:12.560 --> 03:47:13.921]  Analysis.
[03:47:13.921 --> 03:47:15.342]  Reports.
[03:47:15.342 --> 03:47:18.264]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:18.264 --> 03:47:23.348]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[03:47:23.348 --> 03:47:27.230]  Welcome back.
[03:47:27.230 --> 03:47:29.852]  Let's talk a little bit about Michael Moore's disillusionment.
[03:47:29.852 --> 03:47:35.276]  It's called Planet of the Humans, and it debuted today, birthday, 50th anniversary birthday.
[03:47:36.634 --> 03:47:41.181]  And he's made it available for free because that's kind of what it's worth.
[03:47:41.181 --> 03:47:43.023]  But for what it's worth, let's take a look.
[03:47:44.091 --> 03:47:46.312]  At the education of Michael Moore.
[03:47:46.312 --> 03:47:49.612]  It's taken him a long time, 50 years.
[03:47:49.612 --> 03:47:55.194]  He's not quite caught on, but he has caught on to some of the schemes that have been there from the very beginning.
[03:47:55.194 --> 03:47:58.775]  There's an article on counterpoint, counterpunch.org.
[03:47:58.775 --> 03:48:01.316]  I think this is a UK publication.
[03:48:01.316 --> 03:48:03.496]  And listen to the way this starts out.
[03:48:03.496 --> 03:48:09.918]  Back in 2007, the environmental organization 350.org was founded by Bill McKibben.
[03:48:10.638 --> 03:48:23.083]  The name refers to the theory that 350 parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere is the highest concentration that can occur before the life support system unravels for good.
[03:48:23.083 --> 03:48:27.524]  It was already at 385 parts per million when 350 was formed.
[03:48:27.524 --> 03:48:30.505]  Now it's at 410 parts per million!
[03:48:30.505 --> 03:48:31.466]  Exclamation mark!
[03:48:32.421 --> 03:48:36.604]  Clearly, we're losing the battle against climate chaos.
[03:48:36.604 --> 03:48:39.866]  Well, I would say that's one conclusion you could say.
[03:48:39.866 --> 03:48:42.227]  I would say that you have lost the argument.
[03:48:42.227 --> 03:48:44.189]  You've lost your theory.
[03:48:44.189 --> 03:48:45.910]  It's garbage.
[03:48:45.910 --> 03:48:53.455]  If we're going to die when it gets to 350, and it was 385 before you even got your website going, and now it's at 410, then obviously
[03:48:54.673 --> 03:48:56.014]  This is a bunch of bunk.
[03:48:56.014 --> 03:49:06.179]  But as they were going through, talking about how this is, and the mindset of these type of people, they think this is the most important documentary ever, ever!
[03:49:06.179 --> 03:49:09.980]  Maybe even more important than the convenient lines of Al Gore.
[03:49:09.980 --> 03:49:16.923]  And they express it this way, the bottom line, there are too many clever apes consuming too much too rapidly.
[03:49:16.923 --> 03:49:19.985]  See, this kind of forced austerity that we have now adopted,
[03:49:20.987 --> 03:49:23.391]  Through the COVID lockdown.
[03:49:23.391 --> 03:49:25.976]  It's exactly what these people have been after from the very beginning.
[03:49:25.976 --> 03:49:28.300]  And when I looked at this, I nearly fell out of my chair.
[03:49:28.300 --> 03:49:30.824]  I thought, do these people listen to me?
[03:49:30.824 --> 03:49:33.469]  They said we could power the grid on unicorn farts!
[03:49:34.773 --> 03:49:51.200]  I've been laughing at these people, complaining that CO2, and again, they typically don't, is that Chris Matthews, before he left, he had on somebody who was preaching about the environment, and he said, they said carbon, because it just, they like to talk about carbon, because it sounds dirty.
[03:49:51.200 --> 03:49:55.321]  You know, you think of getting, you know, black soot on your hands.
[03:49:55.321 --> 03:50:04.165]  And they're referring to carbon dioxide, of course, what you and I breathe out, and what plants need to survive this symbiotic relationship here.
[03:50:05.054 --> 03:50:09.096]  But Chris Matthews said, you know, carbon monoxide, that stuff will kill you.
[03:50:09.096 --> 03:50:11.057]  No, no, no, I'm talking about carbon dioxide.
[03:50:11.057 --> 03:50:14.799]  They don't know the difference between carbon, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide.
[03:50:14.799 --> 03:50:17.900]  And so when they talk about it, I just say, well, it's just unicorn farts.
[03:50:17.900 --> 03:50:20.462]  But we could power the grid on unicorn farts.
[03:50:20.462 --> 03:50:22.943]  But if we keep on breeding and consuming,
[03:50:23.956 --> 03:50:26.298]  We'll still eat the planet.
[03:50:26.298 --> 03:50:27.458]  Yeah, that's the bottom line.
[03:50:27.458 --> 03:50:28.979]  That's from Michael Moore.
[03:50:28.979 --> 03:50:30.961]  That's the wisdom of Michael Moore.
[03:50:30.961 --> 03:50:33.563]  What if green energy cannot save the planet?
[03:50:33.563 --> 03:50:38.686]  What if wind farms, solar panels, other green energy projects are not enough to save the planet?
[03:50:38.686 --> 03:50:44.390]  And humanity just cannot sustain life as we know it.
[03:50:44.390 --> 03:50:48.793]  Does that mean that we now get to throw out the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainability?
[03:50:49.423 --> 03:50:50.024]  Let's take it out.
[03:50:50.024 --> 03:50:53.347]  Well, it's actually already been enacted for a large part of it.
[03:50:53.347 --> 03:50:59.232]  And they're accustoming you to living under that forced austerity.
[03:50:59.232 --> 03:51:01.073]  They just had a different excuse for it.
[03:51:01.073 --> 03:51:03.676]  They just pulled out this rationale and put that in.
[03:51:03.676 --> 03:51:06.158]  And they don't have a problem doing that.
[03:51:06.158 --> 03:51:14.245]  Because if you go back to 1970, and I remember 1970, I was in high school, when they told everybody that we were going to have a new Ice Age.
[03:51:15.880 --> 03:51:22.564]  And within less than 10 years, they did a 180 and said, no, no, no, we're going to have global warming.
[03:51:22.564 --> 03:51:39.913]  But the most interesting thing about that was not their inaccuracy of their predictions, but the fact that regardless of going from a new ice age to an idea where everything was going to melt and we were going to die from heat, the solution remained the same.
[03:51:39.913 --> 03:51:41.954]  Austerity and eliminating humans.
[03:51:43.049 --> 03:51:44.810]  That has always been the same thing.
[03:51:44.810 --> 03:51:49.332]  Regardless of what happens, that's always the same solution.
[03:51:49.332 --> 03:51:54.714]  And so, when he talks about Planet of the Humans, what he's really saying, he could have subtitled it, Die Humans, right?
[03:51:54.714 --> 03:52:02.497]  Because he wants to, he's referencing, you know, the Planet of the Apes, where humanity basically killed itself.
[03:52:02.497 --> 03:52:06.599]  And so, as the guy who's directing it, again, Michael Moore produced this.
[03:52:06.599 --> 03:52:08.200]  He's got another guy who directed it.
[03:52:09.133 --> 03:52:21.104]  And this director walks through, like Michael Moore, basically talking to the audience, and he says the best solution is we've got to have fewer children.
[03:52:21.104 --> 03:52:22.945]  Infinite growth will be suicide.
[03:52:22.945 --> 03:52:24.306]  This is Malthusianism.
[03:52:24.306 --> 03:52:32.393]  This is the idea that, hey, look at this, look at the cities, they are filthy, we've got horses all over the place, excrement in the streets.
[03:52:33.382 --> 03:52:37.406]  And there's more horses and carriages this year than I've ever seen in my life.
[03:52:37.406 --> 03:52:46.914]  And if this continues to go this way, we are going to be over our heads in horse excrement.
[03:52:46.914 --> 03:52:48.396]  And this is the way these guys always think.
[03:52:48.396 --> 03:52:51.819]  They never think that somebody's going to develop a car.
[03:52:51.819 --> 03:52:57.083]  And Michael Moore says, well, I thought electric cars were a good idea, but I didn't really think about where the electricity was coming from.
[03:52:57.083 --> 03:52:59.786]  Well, you know, Michael, it always comes out of the wall, of course, right?
[03:53:01.847 --> 03:53:08.909]  The group that I used to work with, we pushed back against the renewable scams that Michael Moore has just figured out.
[03:53:08.909 --> 03:53:17.551]  And it never failed when we'd have a conference that we would ask people in the audience, what is your favorite source of energy?
[03:53:17.551 --> 03:53:21.232]  And you would always have somebody say, electricity.
[03:53:21.232 --> 03:53:23.593]  It's not a source, it's a product.
[03:53:23.593 --> 03:53:25.414]  And this is what AOC doesn't understand.
[03:53:25.414 --> 03:53:26.554]  When she chairs the idea,
[03:53:27.631 --> 03:53:30.312]  That people are shutting down oil production everywhere.
[03:53:30.312 --> 03:53:31.272]  Right now, you've got a glut.
[03:53:31.272 --> 03:53:33.693]  Right now, you're enjoying cheap prices.
[03:53:33.693 --> 03:53:37.295]  But that isn't going to last.
[03:53:37.295 --> 03:53:41.176]  If we have broken the supply chains, and this is exactly what these people want to do.
[03:53:41.176 --> 03:53:43.297]  I assumed that solar panels would last forever, he said.
[03:53:43.297 --> 03:53:45.038]  I didn't know what went into the making of them.
[03:53:45.038 --> 03:53:51.340]  He didn't understand, and he still doesn't understand, the energy equation of that.
[03:53:51.340 --> 03:53:55.602]  And so, when we look at the earth-bursters,
[03:53:56.735 --> 03:53:58.737]  They're still out there pushing the idea.
[03:53:58.737 --> 03:53:59.637]  This is CNN.
[03:53:59.637 --> 03:54:00.478]  Air quality in the U.S.
[03:54:00.478 --> 03:54:04.822]  dramatically worse than in prior years, says a new State of the Air report.
[03:54:04.822 --> 03:54:10.747]  I guess they didn't get the memo that the factories are closed, the cars are not going down the highway.
[03:54:10.747 --> 03:54:14.870]  But, you know, this is where we are with these people.
[03:54:14.870 --> 03:54:21.856]  If we can move ahead, if we can look at some of the things that this has exposed, because they've moved so quickly.
[03:54:23.015 --> 03:54:27.217]  They may have awakened enough of the people to do something about this.
[03:54:27.217 --> 03:54:31.058]  Like I said, the vast majority of people are happy with the way things are going.
[03:54:31.058 --> 03:54:33.239]  They will give more control of their life over to the government.
[03:54:33.239 --> 03:54:35.360]  They believe the government's going to help them.
[03:54:35.360 --> 03:54:36.160]  You and I know better.
[03:54:36.943 --> 03:54:43.346]  And a lot of people are getting a heavy dose of reality that is far more extensive than what Michael Moore has just figured out.
[03:54:43.346 --> 03:54:44.086]  Here's an example.
[03:54:44.086 --> 03:54:51.269]  The CDC says that poisonings from cleaners and disinfectants are on a sharp rise since the pandemic.
[03:54:51.269 --> 03:54:59.472]  They said calls to poison centers about exposure to cleaners and disinfectants increased 20% in the first three months of this year.
[03:54:59.472 --> 03:55:04.414]  They have freaked everybody out so much about viruses.
[03:55:04.414 --> 03:55:05.435]  As I've said on the program,
[03:55:06.656 --> 03:55:11.860]  The CDC has turned America OCD.
[03:55:11.860 --> 03:55:13.921]  Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
[03:55:13.921 --> 03:55:15.282]  That's what we've become.
[03:55:15.282 --> 03:55:21.026]  To the extent that people are poisoning themselves trying to disinfect their groceries.
[03:55:21.026 --> 03:55:22.967]  But there's another poison that's out there.
[03:55:22.967 --> 03:55:27.230]  There's a poison that the CDC has been trying to sell us with their lying statistics for a long time.
[03:55:27.230 --> 03:55:28.331]  And that's vaccines.
[03:55:28.331 --> 03:55:29.972]  Specifically the MMR vaccine.
[03:55:30.697 --> 03:55:31.458]  Here's their poison.
[03:55:31.458 --> 03:55:38.164]  Could the MMR vaccine help to protect against coronavirus complications?
[03:55:38.164 --> 03:55:39.885]  Asks the Daily Mail.
[03:55:39.885 --> 03:55:42.527]  On behalf of the CDC, of course.
[03:55:42.527 --> 03:55:48.573]  They said, people over the age of 65 are most likely to die of COVID-19.
[03:55:48.573 --> 03:55:54.117]  MMR vaccination began in the UK in the 1960s, meaning that older people miss the MMR.
[03:55:54.117 --> 03:55:54.598]  Therefore,
[03:55:56.172 --> 03:55:56.532]  I don't know.
[03:56:14.741 --> 03:56:18.064]  We're talking about the Planet of the Apes, Planet of the Humans, you know.
[03:56:18.064 --> 03:56:23.668]  They're very different, but they're a lot closer than rubella and coronavirus.
[03:56:23.668 --> 03:56:31.595]  And yeah, they said the team has no proof that the MMR vaccine has any impact on COVID-19 patients, but a study is warranted.
[03:56:31.595 --> 03:56:35.237]  And you should get your vaccine.
[03:56:35.237 --> 03:56:36.659]  Yeah, they're not going to talk about stem cells.
[03:56:37.643 --> 03:56:50.474]  They're not going to talk about the fact that you had a Chinese doctor in Wuhan who did an experiment with umbilical cord stem cells and found they not only cured 100% of the patients, but it also repaired any damage to their lungs.
[03:56:50.474 --> 03:56:53.336]  They don't want to talk about stem cells because that's a cure.
[03:56:53.336 --> 03:56:55.798]  That doesn't fit their business model.
[03:56:55.798 --> 03:57:00.042]  We had Goldman Sachs lecturing the pharmaceutical business, said, look at this particular company.
[03:57:00.042 --> 03:57:01.923]  They cured a disease.
[03:57:01.923 --> 03:57:02.684]  Don't do that!
[03:57:03.749 --> 03:57:09.230]  They made 12 billion dollars the first year and then they were out of business because they cured this particular disease.
[03:57:09.230 --> 03:57:16.551]  And we don't even have time to talk about how the mainstream media is coming after hydroxychloroquine.
[03:57:16.551 --> 03:57:26.353]  The bottom line, folks, they're using a VA study where they went after the sickest people that they had in the hospital.
[03:57:26.353 --> 03:57:28.114]  And they didn't give them the full treatment either.
[03:57:28.114 --> 03:57:29.674]  But this is the way they will spin it.
[03:57:30.751 --> 03:57:37.963]  And I wish we had more time, but I'll cover it in detail tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock Central Time, 9 o'clock Eastern, The David Knight Show.
[03:57:37.963 --> 03:57:38.344]  Join me then.
