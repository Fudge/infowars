[00:00.000 --> 00:17.760]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:42.240]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. The answer to the ongoing lockdowns being announced worldwide
[00:42.240 --> 00:45.240]  is people to speak up and say no and to tell the truth.
[00:45.240 --> 00:51.960]  If you're back and they should be begging you to do the right thing, you're about to
[00:51.960 --> 00:59.960]  open a pit of hell. You do not get a vaccine passport put on us. You know, as the population
[00:59.960 --> 01:05.960]  who's in control, you know that the people or the politicians, once you get a power,
[01:05.960 --> 01:11.960]  you will never relinquish it. Do you think that the four feet of marble that holds you
[01:11.960 --> 01:20.960]  above, high in this chamber, will help you from the fate of humanity, which you are unleashing?
[01:20.960 --> 01:29.960]  No! It won't! Your children and your children's children will be subjugated.
[01:29.960 --> 01:36.960]  They will be asked how many vaccines have you had? Have you been a good little Nazi?
[01:36.960 --> 01:47.960]  Hail Fauci! Hail Fauci! Hail Fauci! Hail Fauci! There's been a lot of talk about the Nuremberg Code.
[01:47.960 --> 01:57.960]  Well, I brought you a copy. You are all in violation of Section 1. Yes, you, Dr. Wotan,
[01:57.960 --> 02:07.960]  you are in violation of the Nuremberg Code, which is international law. And the definition is...
[02:07.960 --> 02:09.960]  Sir, your time has expired.
[02:09.960 --> 02:12.960]  The definition we shall not be.
[02:12.960 --> 02:17.960]  Well, that's definitely my brother from another mother. I want to get that gentleman on the show.
[02:17.960 --> 02:21.960]  This is from the San Diego board meeting there. And there are a lot of other great clubs
[02:21.960 --> 02:26.960]  who are going to be playing from that meeting coming up here. In fact, let's just get to one right now.
[02:26.960 --> 02:33.960]  Here's a gym owner saying, I will never submit. People understand, the chains are going on. Here it is.
[02:33.960 --> 02:40.960]  My name is Lou Yardell. I'm the owner of MetroFlex Gym and Oceanside.
[02:40.960 --> 02:46.960]  It's been 18 months since people have been so scared of dying that they gave up on living.
[02:46.960 --> 02:52.960]  I'm here today to talk about recent recommendations to ask employers to do your dirty work.
[02:52.960 --> 02:59.960]  Asking them to mandate vaccines is another misstep in a parade of failures of our government.
[02:59.960 --> 03:05.960]  You want to know why there's so much kickback on this? We simply don't trust you.
[03:05.960 --> 03:12.960]  And why would we? It's gone from two weeks to flatten the curve to show me your papers if you want to work here.
[03:12.960 --> 03:19.960]  It went from stemming the flow of the ICU overflow to eradicating a virus that will never go away.
[03:19.960 --> 03:25.960]  The proof is in Israel with the highest rates of vaccines and many more breakthrough cases than ever seen.
[03:25.960 --> 03:34.960]  Masks didn't work, stay-at-home orders didn't work, and lockdowns will go down in history as one of the greatest blunders of our time.
[03:34.960 --> 03:38.960]  We talk about personal responsibility in getting the vaccine.
[03:38.960 --> 03:50.960]  Dr. Wilma Wooten, not once have I heard you or any other health officer talk about the importance of the fact that 78% of the people admitted to the ICU will overweight or obese.
[03:50.960 --> 04:00.960]  You, nor our elected officials, minus Jim Desmond, have ever mentioned the effectiveness of maintaining healthy weight, exercise, proper nutrition, vitamin supplementation, not a peep.
[04:00.960 --> 04:04.960]  We are talking about health? We talking about health?
[04:04.960 --> 04:11.960]  Instead we get wear a mask, stay home, close your business and take this shot, none of which boosts your immune system.
[04:11.960 --> 04:18.960]  Don't talk to me about personal responsibility until every employer is held responsible for injury resulting from this shot when they require it.
[04:18.960 --> 04:23.960]  Or big pharma companies are held liable. I'm going to make this real simple for y'all.
[04:23.960 --> 04:30.960]  I will never, and I mean ever, submit to any requested requirement to wear a mask or vaccine mandates.
[04:30.960 --> 04:38.960]  I will never submit to rules that segregate or dismantle people and put them against each other. Thank you.
[04:38.960 --> 04:44.960]  Well, once folks get it, they understand and see all.
[04:44.960 --> 04:48.960]  The reason I found that is I was on Twitter and people said, oh, these are the new Alex Joneses.
[04:48.960 --> 04:53.960]  No, they're not. They're humans that see the same takeover and recognize the lies that are going to fight back.
[04:53.960 --> 05:19.960]  We're going to win, but it's going to be rough, folks. Stay with us. The main broadcast starts now.
[05:24.960 --> 05:31.960]  If you haven't tried it, it's back in stock at infowarstore.com, discounted because of the COVID lockdown,
[05:31.960 --> 05:35.960]  because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America.
[05:35.960 --> 05:41.960]  It's not been available for over six months, but now it's back in stock and it's available in only two places.
[05:41.960 --> 05:54.960]  At infowarstore.com and Dr. Jones naturals.com. It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash, so get your activated charcoal toothpaste, activated charcoal mouthwash with central oils and more.
[05:54.960 --> 06:01.960]  At infowarstore.com and funding info war, a true 360 win.
[06:01.960 --> 06:15.960]  We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France. We shall fight on the seas and oceans. We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[06:15.960 --> 06:32.960]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender.
[06:46.960 --> 06:57.960]  Why couldn't a ragtag group who was a small minority of the Afghan population beat the Russians and now beat the biggest empire the world's ever seen?
[06:57.960 --> 07:05.960]  And it's because they are willing to die and because they have the resistance of will to never give up.
[07:05.960 --> 07:16.960]  In fact, I saw a nine-month-old piece with the Taliban leader speaking and then I saw him from about six months ago once Biden had been installed. He just said that. He said resistance is victory.
[07:16.960 --> 07:21.960]  We'll never stop fighting. You'll never defeat us because we'll never give up.
[07:21.960 --> 07:34.960]  Now, I don't like a lot of things about the Taliban, but compared to the satanic New World Order, compared to the globalists, compared to what they wanted to our children, well, the Taliban pale in significance.
[07:34.960 --> 07:42.960]  Because they're doing what they do from a stone age caveman-like perspective.
[07:42.960 --> 07:58.960]  Facing this modern globalist scourge that literally wants to dumb humans down so much and divide us away from our friends and family and isolate us so much that we're no longer even human, that's the globalist project is dehumanize us.
[07:58.960 --> 08:07.960]  So we can learn a lot from the Taliban and the fact that they haven't submitted. Same thing for the North Vietnamese.
[08:07.960 --> 08:17.960]  I didn't like Ho Chi Minh and I don't like communism, but you notice today they're one of our biggest trading partners and their enemies with China and they're becoming more free market than the United States is in many ways.
[08:17.960 --> 08:24.960]  That's because other than bombs, it would have been better to be diplomatic with business and commerce.
[08:24.960 --> 08:43.960]  A lesson from Vietnam, the Vietnam War, and the lesson from the Afghanistan situation where empires have been going for 2600 years to die, is that if you don't submit as a people, you cannot be conquered.
[08:43.960 --> 09:01.960]  And the reason we live under so much tyranny in Australia, in New Zealand, in the United Kingdom, in Europe, in Canada, and now to a great extent in the U.S. is because we've forgotten the Anglo-Saxon ethos of the Knights of the Round Table and King Arthur, who was a real person, though it became legend,
[09:01.960 --> 09:17.960]  the son of Uther Pendragon, and the Round Table of the Lords and the Magna Carta being able to have a vote against the king, and then that evolved or devolved down to the common people having basic rights.
[09:17.960 --> 09:28.960]  That idea did not exist anywhere else in the world except for a very short time in one area of Greece, and that again was only the nobility that was allowed to vote.
[09:28.960 --> 09:35.960]  And so that system is under globalist attack because it does not want to have that type of system.
[09:35.960 --> 09:47.960]  They want the rest of the Third World to not want to become American-like and have to process and have private property and to be making society a better society and a more successful society and a more secure society and a more wealthy society.
[09:47.960 --> 09:53.960]  The globalists want a post-industrial world, so they're everywhere saying, thank God the whites are a minority.
[09:53.960 --> 10:04.960]  On the news, America is a terrible, evil, white supremacist place. Let's get rid of its basic tenants, and then they're replacing it with something more akin to the Communist Chinese.
[10:04.960 --> 10:13.960]  Now, if you want to know what's happening in Afghanistan, you want to know what's happening over in China and Hong Kong and Taiwan, it's very simple.
[10:13.960 --> 10:28.960]  If you've read the Council on Foreign Relations, which is the top globalist in the United States, hooked in with British intelligence and the UN and the rest of it, they've been saying for 50 years we're going to build up China and replace the United States.
[10:28.960 --> 10:40.960]  And they've been saying now for 20 years there's going to be a moment where the United States has a president that basically stands down at bases all around the world and then China will come into the vacuum and take over.
[10:40.960 --> 11:00.960]  Now, I'm not arguing to be an empire, I'm not arguing to stand all these places, but I'm saying the way Joe Biden did it was the perfect way to embolden and green light China to openly threaten to invade Taiwan and Hong Kong yesterday in the National People's Daily newspaper.
[11:00.960 --> 11:10.960]  And when you read the article, I might read the whole thing, it's just stunning, there's an English translation of it, it's all over the news.
[11:10.960 --> 11:19.960]  And they said America's a joke, America's over, it will not help you, Taiwan, the Taliban has crushed America, Joe Biden is an idiot.
[11:19.960 --> 11:31.960]  And that's his position, he is a Chinese spy, he's a globalist minion, and he is designed to come in and demoralize and destroy this country.
[11:31.960 --> 11:38.960]  That's why Saki yesterday at a press conference, they said what about Americans, there's thousands of Americans, they can't get out.
[11:38.960 --> 11:54.960]  He said oh, that's not our main thing, we care about Afghans and people that are targeted persons or whatever, and of course they mean the boyfriends and stuff of the ambassadors.
[11:54.960 --> 12:04.960]  So it's all about training you that you're crap because you're an American, all about training you that you're garbage, you gotta wear a mask over your face because you're an Australian.
[12:04.960 --> 12:11.960]  You've got to have the government announce oh, we're going to take 20 something thousand of your children without asking and inoculate them.
[12:11.960 --> 12:19.960]  And if you don't let us do it, there might be fines, meaning if you don't fill out the waiver farm, there might be fines.
[12:19.960 --> 12:25.960]  There is no law in Australia to make young people take shots, there is no law, there is no mandate to force you to take them.
[12:25.960 --> 12:33.960]  And in public schools and private schools, under law, they have to let you have a waiver for your children, but they don't want you to know about that, it's all color of law.
[12:33.960 --> 12:36.960]  What you see in Australia is all an exercise in fraud.
[12:36.960 --> 12:44.960]  Watch the Australian health minister announce 24,000 students will be injected in stadium without parental consent.
[12:44.960 --> 12:52.960]  You just take them to the school and they're going to take your children in Australia, already got caught a month ago doing this, and the same health minister said get over it big deal.
[12:52.960 --> 12:58.960]  He's committing a serious crime, he needs to be locked up, giving an experimental injection to the children.
[12:58.960 --> 13:09.960]  In fact, guys pull it up for a couple of weeks ago, the Australian leader, the Australian prime minister, he came out and was questioned and said, what about these side effects?
[13:09.960 --> 13:15.960]  And he said, well, you don't have to take the shot, that's why there is medical consent.
[13:15.960 --> 13:20.960]  Australian leader asked about side effects, says, well, you don't have to take the shot.
[13:20.960 --> 13:32.960]  Oh, but then their underlings go out and say you do, and there could be $5,000 Aussie dollar fines if you don't let them inject your seven year old.
[13:32.960 --> 13:41.960]  It's not even an authorized shot worldwide, it's experimental, it's not even a vaccine, it's a gene therapy.
[13:41.960 --> 13:44.960]  And again, it's all done through fraud.
[13:44.960 --> 13:53.960]  And then they say, oh, we're going to take your children to the sports stadium, and your parents won't be allowed in, you can drop them off there if you want.
[13:53.960 --> 14:01.960]  And we're going to take a minute and give them these shots, so it's all color of law, fraudulent intimidation.
[14:01.960 --> 14:07.960]  It's very, very, very dangerous for them to be able to force something like this into your body, especially when there's so many medical issues.
[14:07.960 --> 14:16.960]  So I'm going to hit the huge Afghanistan, China, geopolitical developments, the 25th Amendment talk on Joe Biden coming up bottom of the hour.
[14:16.960 --> 14:22.960]  But the first thing I want to hit is the forced inoculation of children already being done in the UK, already being done in Canada and Australia,
[14:22.960 --> 14:28.960]  and you know it's come out in the news, they're doing it in some schools here without asking the parents, totally criminal.
[14:28.960 --> 14:31.960]  And when it happens, they just cover it up because oh, it's for the greater good.
[14:31.960 --> 14:33.960]  That's how tyranny operates.
[14:33.960 --> 14:41.960]  Look at these headlines, without health, Canada approval, provincial governments are illegally vaccinating 11 year olds now without parental consent.
[14:41.960 --> 14:51.960]  Then this huge study out of Israel, there's also another study out of the United States where all the variants came from right after the inoculation began.
[14:51.960 --> 14:53.960]  Of course, these are live virus vaccines.
[14:53.960 --> 14:56.960]  That's why they spread, that's why they're causing variants.
[14:56.960 --> 15:02.960]  That's why you've seen that massive spike in actual ill people now because of the vaccine, which is a poison.
[15:02.960 --> 15:05.960]  That is all coming up.
[15:05.960 --> 15:07.960]  But around the world, millions are hitting the streets.
[15:07.960 --> 15:09.960]  Look at that shot of France.
[15:09.960 --> 15:16.960]  They say it was over a million people in Paris demonstrating against the vaccine pass and the whole control system, so people understand what's going on.
[15:16.960 --> 15:29.960]  Then I've got stacks of articles about young people having heart attacks, people dying after they're injected with the Pfizer or Moderna GMO shots that cause inflammation in the heart, lungs and brain.
[15:29.960 --> 15:41.960]  Singapore team who suffered heart attacks in the hospital six days, following first Pfizer jab, awarded $166,000 by the Singaporean government that when they confirmed it caused the heart attack.
[15:41.960 --> 15:43.960]  There you go.
[15:43.960 --> 15:46.960]  No wonder these vaccines were banned in India and China.
[15:46.960 --> 15:48.960]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[15:48.960 --> 15:51.960]  No, it's only for those in the West that they take this deadly poison.
[15:51.960 --> 15:53.960]  Everywhere else, they're being banned.
[15:53.960 --> 15:59.960]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[16:23.960 --> 16:25.960]  This is a supply of free electricity from the sun.

[18:02.960 --> 18:03.960]  Hey, Alex.
[18:03.960 --> 18:04.960]  Welcome.
[18:04.960 --> 18:09.960]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[18:09.960 --> 18:12.960]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[18:12.960 --> 18:18.960]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[18:18.960 --> 18:24.960]  Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[18:24.960 --> 18:26.960]  Living defense brought me back.
[18:26.960 --> 18:31.960]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[18:31.960 --> 18:49.960]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[18:49.960 --> 18:50.960]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[18:50.960 --> 18:59.960]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.

[19:55.960 --> 19:59.960]  And another part of the cell ending is the privacy pouches for your cell phone.
[19:59.960 --> 20:27.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:27.960 --> 20:39.960]  So, Australia's so-called conservative prime minister, Scott Morrison, supposedly, you know, lets the other regions, the other premiers, decide what they're going to do.
[20:39.960 --> 20:42.960]  That's basically let the country go under UN control.
[20:42.960 --> 20:48.960]  And I mentioned this earlier, I'm not just going to talk about it and not show it, it's pretty amazing footage.
[20:48.960 --> 20:51.960]  Here he is being asked about people that have died from the so-called vaccines.
[20:51.960 --> 20:54.960]  His response is, well, you don't have to take it.
[20:54.960 --> 21:00.960]  It's experimental, it's killing people, they admit that, and now they're going to try to force the children of Australia to do it.
[21:00.960 --> 21:02.960]  The same thing is coming here.
[21:02.960 --> 21:04.960]  This has got to be our line in the sand.
[21:04.960 --> 21:08.960]  We've got to have a peaceful uprising to this, but I mean civil disobedience.
[21:08.960 --> 21:13.960]  Because what the system is doing, they know, has nothing to do with health, it's about power and control.
[21:13.960 --> 21:23.960]  In the next segment, I'm going to play you a bunch of clips of medical doctors talking about the spike proteins and the studies and what it's doing to your body and how it eats holes in your capillaries and causes blood clots.
[21:23.960 --> 21:25.960]  And this is on purpose, folks.
[21:25.960 --> 21:27.960]  If they can get away with this, they can get away with anything.
[21:27.960 --> 21:29.960]  And I've explained this before.
[21:29.960 --> 21:35.960]  They were able to use Agent Orange and the troops, knowing it was going to cause a bunch of cancer in Vietnam.
[21:35.960 --> 21:39.960]  They were able to give anthrac shots to our troops, knowing it was going to cause Gulf War illness.
[21:39.960 --> 21:40.960]  They got away with that.
[21:40.960 --> 21:43.960]  And the millions of autistic children with what the vaccines have done.
[21:43.960 --> 21:45.960]  So now they're going even bigger.
[21:45.960 --> 21:50.960]  All over the world, millions of children have gotten polio from Bill Gates' program.
[21:50.960 --> 21:52.960]  That's even in Reuters and Associated Press.
[21:52.960 --> 21:54.960]  They got away with that, too.
[21:54.960 --> 21:56.960]  Now, he has been kicked out of over 30 countries.
[21:56.960 --> 21:58.960]  So this is their big launch.
[21:58.960 --> 21:59.960]  This is their big move.
[21:59.960 --> 22:02.960]  And you talk to people that have gotten sick or a family that have died.
[22:02.960 --> 22:04.960]  They just go, well, that's just the way it is.
[22:04.960 --> 22:08.960]  For the woman in San Antonio, both their parents died after the vaccine.
[22:08.960 --> 22:10.960]  She said, well, it's worth it.
[22:10.960 --> 22:12.960]  It's Stockholm syndrome.
[22:12.960 --> 22:16.960]  So let's go ahead and go to the leader of Australia.
[22:16.960 --> 22:17.960]  This is the model of the world.
[22:17.960 --> 22:18.960]  Back on lock now.
[22:18.960 --> 22:21.960]  They're now saying you cannot leave your house to get fresh air.
[22:21.960 --> 22:23.960]  They've got a $5,000 fine in jail time.
[22:23.960 --> 22:27.960]  And now they're announcing forced inoculations of the children outside of law.
[22:27.960 --> 22:29.960]  Australia is now run by a terrorist government.
[22:29.960 --> 22:30.960]  Here it is.
[22:30.960 --> 22:33.960]  Being your pharmacist as opposed to seeing the GP.
[22:33.960 --> 22:41.960]  And secondly, can you talk about the two people who sadly died taking AstraZeneca?
[22:41.960 --> 22:47.960]  And would you be worried if one of those people, as I understand it,
[22:47.960 --> 22:54.960]  had or the family claims didn't get fully informed of the symptoms to look out for?
[22:54.960 --> 22:58.960]  Well, we're all responsible for our own health.
[22:58.960 --> 23:06.960]  And when it comes to informed consent and giving consent to whatever treatment or procedure you may have or I may have,
[23:06.960 --> 23:11.960]  then I'm ultimately responsible for what people do in their health treatment to me.
[23:11.960 --> 23:18.960]  And there has been the opportunity for people to visit their GP, to have that consultation.
[23:18.960 --> 23:21.960]  The government has provided that and funded that.
[23:21.960 --> 23:25.960]  And the informed consent process provides the decision to the individual.
[23:25.960 --> 23:27.960]  That's the sort of country we live in.
[23:27.960 --> 23:31.960]  People make their own decisions about their own health and their own bodies.
[23:31.960 --> 23:35.960]  That's why we don't have mandatory vaccination in relation to the general population here.
[23:35.960 --> 23:38.960]  Because people make their own decisions.
[23:38.960 --> 23:40.960]  And we encourage people to make those decisions.
[23:40.960 --> 23:43.960]  We make as much information available to them as possible.
[23:43.960 --> 23:49.960]  The vaccines, like any vaccine, with any vaccine there are risks associated.
[23:49.960 --> 23:54.960]  And I won't go into each of the individual ones because I don't want to particularly draw attention to anyone.
[23:54.960 --> 24:00.960]  But we all understand that with any vaccine there are risk factors and they're enumerated
[24:00.960 --> 24:05.960]  and they're made available to people and people make decisions about that.
[24:05.960 --> 24:11.960]  I'll let the Chief Medical Officer and others speak to those because they have the details.
[24:11.960 --> 24:14.960]  I've been informed of those cases and there have been other cases.
[24:14.960 --> 24:19.960]  And they're terribly tragic cases, like all of these are.
[24:19.960 --> 24:22.960]  And I feel for their families in those situations.
[24:22.960 --> 24:28.960]  And this is the terrible impact that the pandemics have when you're responding to pandemics.
[24:28.960 --> 24:37.960]  But I do know that if vaccination rates, as we see, particularly for those who are older, are not where we want them to be,
[24:37.960 --> 24:39.960]  then people's lives are at risk.
[24:39.960 --> 24:42.960]  It's not a vaccine. It's experimental.
[24:42.960 --> 24:45.960]  The literature is blank on these.
[24:45.960 --> 24:46.960]  And that's a fact.
[24:46.960 --> 24:49.960]  And it's the exact same program Australia is under that we're under.
[24:49.960 --> 24:54.960]  So he's a lot slicker than these other politicians over there, but he is a liar.
[24:54.960 --> 25:01.960]  When he says that we've told you the risk and you've been led to know the risk and it's up to you.
[25:01.960 --> 25:03.960]  You've had informed consent.
[25:03.960 --> 25:05.960]  That's Nuremberg code talk he's putting out.
[25:05.960 --> 25:08.960]  He knows what he's doing.
[25:08.960 --> 25:14.960]  In fact, guys, get the clip from Sunday I never played with the medical doctors explaining that the Nuremberg code is being violated.
[25:14.960 --> 25:20.960]  They give the code sections to the author of the U.S. biological weapons law and the co-author of the UN world law on it,
[25:20.960 --> 25:24.960]  explaining how it's illegal, but I mean, this is just insane.
[25:24.960 --> 25:34.960]  Yeah, so here is the announcements in one of their regions that they're taking 24,000 children outside of parental consent.
[25:34.960 --> 25:36.960]  That's what's in the fine print of the news.
[25:36.960 --> 25:41.960]  Attempting this buffalo movement just to make everybody get in line and go over the edge of the cliff.
[25:41.960 --> 25:42.960]  Here it is.
[25:42.960 --> 25:48.960]  I want to stress that to the mums and dads, your children will be well looked after inside when they arrive.
[25:48.960 --> 25:50.960]  They'll be literally ushered.
[25:50.960 --> 25:51.960]  We'll have nurses.
[25:51.960 --> 25:53.960]  We'll have some of the youth command.
[25:53.960 --> 26:01.960]  We'll have some of the young police from the various operations within police there just to guide them through as to where they go.
[26:01.960 --> 26:06.960]  They'll be looked after every moment inside the stadium and they'll be well cared for.
[26:06.960 --> 26:08.960]  So mums and dads feel secure.
[26:08.960 --> 26:11.960]  We've got about 24,000 students we're aiming to get through next week.
[26:11.960 --> 26:15.960]  The messages will come out this week and the opportunity is there.
[26:15.960 --> 26:18.960]  But really, you've got to take it, grasp it with both hands.
[26:18.960 --> 26:24.960]  I know if you talk to any of our Olympians, I'll tell you, you just got to grasp opportunity.
[26:24.960 --> 26:27.960]  And this is an opportunity, so don't waste it.
[26:27.960 --> 26:33.960]  All right, when we start the next segment, I'm going to play five or six doctor clips, however much time I have.
[26:33.960 --> 26:42.960]  prestigious doctors, one of them is the top virologist in France, explaining that this is deadly poison and not a vaccine and causing prior disease.
[26:42.960 --> 26:50.960]  And turning off your white blood cells, your killer T's, very similar to HIV.
[26:50.960 --> 26:51.960]  You're going to hear that when we come back.
[26:51.960 --> 26:57.960]  This is real and they're really trying this on us because they've been ordered by the big banks and the globalists.
[26:57.960 --> 26:59.960]  You do this or you'll be destroyed.
[26:59.960 --> 27:06.960]  So now five presidents have been murdered, all of them black, by the way, in Africa and Haiti.
[27:06.960 --> 27:11.960]  Some of them tortured to death because they said we're not taking this experimental shot.
[27:11.960 --> 27:13.960]  And you saw what happened to them.
[27:13.960 --> 27:16.960]  So this is a big, big, big deal.
[27:16.960 --> 27:18.960]  By the way, this is not a gimmick.
[27:18.960 --> 27:25.960]  I said the sale had to end yesterday for X to the deep crystal iodine at 50% off because we're about to run out of it.
[27:25.960 --> 27:26.960]  I got busy.
[27:26.960 --> 27:27.960]  The crew got busy.
[27:27.960 --> 27:31.960]  I've been taking care of sick family with all these variants they've put out.
[27:31.960 --> 27:33.960]  And so I did not get the new ads cut.
[27:33.960 --> 27:36.960]  I did not come up with the new sales and we're low on a product.
[27:36.960 --> 27:38.960]  So I just haven't had, I haven't done it.
[27:38.960 --> 27:41.960]  After the show today, I'll come up with a new sales for tomorrow.
[27:41.960 --> 27:43.960]  So it's extended one more day.
[27:43.960 --> 27:50.960]  If you haven't experienced X to deeper crystal iodine that's not bound to any other element, it actually gets into your cells.
[27:50.960 --> 27:54.960]  It's into your blood and it's just essential for your immune system.
[27:54.960 --> 28:00.960]  One of the big things that people are deficient is iodine and it is essential for so much more.
[28:00.960 --> 28:06.960]  Stamina, libido, mental focus, everything X to is 50% off infowarstore.com.
[28:06.960 --> 28:14.960]  So look at the thousands of five star reviews that they scroll up 98% reviews, 6000 plus reviews, 4.9 stars.
[28:14.960 --> 28:18.960]  X to is 50% off today is the last day.
[28:18.960 --> 28:29.960]  And in the last day for pure turmeric liquid extract at 50% off so good for your immune system and for antioxidants and of course good for inflammation to take care of that.
[28:29.960 --> 28:33.960]  Dr. Jones charcoal toothpaste that sale will continue to now back in stock.
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.960]  With the accident concentrated charcoal people love so much along with the accident charcoal mouthwash with essential oils.
[28:38.960 --> 28:40.960]  Those are worth 33% off.
[28:40.960 --> 28:46.960]  And then we have Emirates essentials hand sanitizers all natural eucalyptus peppermint and lavender back in stock 25% off.
[28:46.960 --> 28:49.960]  And we have lung cleanse that's going to end tomorrow.
[28:49.960 --> 28:52.960]  Got in the day actually 50% off for all those great essential oils.
[28:52.960 --> 28:56.960]  That's the lung cleanse mouth and throat defense infowarstore.com.
[28:56.960 --> 28:58.960]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[28:58.960 --> 29:02.960]  Hey everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture.
[29:02.960 --> 29:03.960]  Me too.
[29:03.960 --> 29:10.960]  But listen after all the research all the conflicting studies after all the squabbling there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:10.960 --> 29:14.960]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:14.960 --> 29:17.960]  You probably already believe that I certainly do.
[29:17.960 --> 29:18.960]  So here's the thing.
[29:18.960 --> 29:27.960]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:27.960 --> 29:32.960]  Now you'll have to sign a waiver but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com.
[29:32.960 --> 29:34.960]  No cures or treatments there.
[29:34.960 --> 29:43.960]  Instead little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called immune 10x.
[29:43.960 --> 29:51.960]  In the best part you can go to the stronger defense website right now and claim your own supply of immune 10x without paying anything today.

[29:59.960 --> 30:04.960]  So when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[30:04.960 --> 30:06.960]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[30:06.960 --> 30:11.960]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[30:11.960 --> 30:15.960]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[30:15.960 --> 30:21.960]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that you know with a deep burden source you know and I got really excited about that.
[30:21.960 --> 30:28.960]  So I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[30:28.960 --> 30:35.960]  You know I could think again I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back
[30:35.960 --> 30:38.960]  and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[30:38.960 --> 30:40.960]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[30:40.960 --> 30:44.960]  The one I like recently is a knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it.
[30:44.960 --> 30:48.960]  It's amazing. It works. But anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[30:48.960 --> 30:54.960]  We have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[30:54.960 --> 31:18.960]  I beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.

[31:57.960 --> 32:23.960]  So thank you so much for your support.
[32:23.960 --> 32:32.960]  Think about that because that's where we are. Imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years ago if somebody told you this would be happening.
[32:32.960 --> 32:34.960]  But it is happening now.
[32:34.960 --> 32:39.960]  And then they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine is a gene therapy and it doesn't really work.
[32:39.960 --> 32:43.960]  She got to take it every few months and the people that have submitted say great.
[32:43.960 --> 32:49.960]  I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[32:49.960 --> 32:55.960]  There's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing the shedding of the virus and that's in mainline studies.
[32:55.960 --> 33:02.960]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this need to go to prison for it right now.
[33:02.960 --> 33:17.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:17.960 --> 33:20.960]  And we are back ladies and gentlemen.
[33:20.960 --> 33:36.960]  One of the top trends on Twitter last night this morning was questions swirl over why Twitter gives Taliban a platform while banning American dissidents like Alex Jones, President Trump, and so many others.
[33:36.960 --> 33:39.960]  And the Taliban actually responded to this.
[33:39.960 --> 33:47.960]  I guess that's why it was one of the top things on Twitter this morning was why is Alex Jones banned.
[33:47.960 --> 33:57.960]  Why is President Trump banned but why is the Taliban not banned and turned out the Taliban spokesperson actually brought up the subject so I'll play that start of the next segment but let me do this.
[33:57.960 --> 34:00.960]  I've got so many of these clips I could fill the whole four hour show with them.
[34:00.960 --> 34:05.960]  But this is just the last few days prominent prestigious scientists and doctors.
[34:05.960 --> 34:09.960]  So let me just play these back to back I'll introduce them right now.
[34:09.960 --> 34:16.960]  This is Dr. Ryan Cole owns a huge clinic, a bunch of genetic stuff, highly respected.
[34:16.960 --> 34:18.960]  And he's linking to all the major studies.
[34:18.960 --> 34:20.960]  It's a whole hour long thing you did on this.
[34:20.960 --> 34:32.960]  And it's in mainline studies that these so called vaccines lower one of your key immune cells, not the T lymphocyte but the killer T actually basically turns off about a third of them.
[34:32.960 --> 34:41.960]  So we're going to play clip 10, then Stephanie Seneff, one of the top research scientists at MIT and an expert on mRNA.
[34:41.960 --> 34:47.960]  We've got Dr. Charles Hough talking about spike proteins in the blood and the Dr. Richard Fleming.
[34:47.960 --> 34:51.960]  And then I've got more clips after that but we'll see if we have time to get to all of them.
[34:51.960 --> 34:54.960]  Just play those four clips back to back.
[34:54.960 --> 35:00.960]  Here's what I'm seeing in the laboratory already and this is very, very concerning.
[35:00.960 --> 35:07.960]  When we give these shots, we can look at the types of white blood cells in the body.
[35:07.960 --> 35:10.960]  We can look at your T cells, your B cells, the ratios.
[35:10.960 --> 35:18.960]  And you have a broad array of immune cells that work together to fight off viruses, to keep cancers in check.
[35:18.960 --> 35:28.960]  We're already seeing the signals in the laboratory decreases of certain critically important T cells that you need, your innate immune system.
[35:28.960 --> 35:32.960]  Your marines of your body, the first ones in fighting off viruses, fighting off cancers.
[35:32.960 --> 35:39.960]  It's why kids have done phenomenally well and survived this virus at 100% rate statistically this year.
[35:39.960 --> 35:47.960]  Because they have an innate T cell immune response that has two to three times the activity of an adult T cell immune response.
[35:47.960 --> 35:55.960]  They have two to three times the enzymes that throw the little hand grenades in the cells and blow up the infected cells compared to adults.
[35:55.960 --> 35:58.960]  And that's why kids have done so wonderfully against this virus.
[35:58.960 --> 36:08.960]  But what we're seeing in the laboratory after people get these shots, we're seeing a very concerning locked in low profile of these important killer T cells that you want in your body.
[36:08.960 --> 36:10.960]  It's almost a reverse HIV.
[36:10.960 --> 36:13.960]  In HIV, you'll lose your helper T cells, your CD4 cells.
[36:13.960 --> 36:19.960]  In this virus post-vaccine, what we're seeing is a drop in your killer T cells, your CD8 cells.
[36:19.960 --> 36:21.960]  And what does CD8 cells do?
[36:21.960 --> 36:23.960]  They keep all other viruses in check.
[36:23.960 --> 36:24.960]  What am I seeing in the laboratory?
[36:24.960 --> 36:27.960]  I'm seeing an uptick of herpes family viruses.
[36:27.960 --> 36:28.960]  I'm seeing herpes.
[36:28.960 --> 36:29.960]  I'm seeing shingles.
[36:29.960 --> 36:30.960]  I'm seeing mono.
[36:30.960 --> 36:37.960]  I'm seeing a huge uptick in human papilloma virus in the cervical biopsies and the cervical pap smears in women.
[36:37.960 --> 36:43.960]  In addition to that, there's a little infectious bump the kids get called maluskin contagiosin.
[36:43.960 --> 36:45.960]  What do you need to keep that in check?
[36:45.960 --> 36:47.960]  You need CD8 killer T cells.
[36:47.960 --> 36:53.960]  I am seeing a 20 times increase in individuals over the age of 50 of this little bump in rash.
[36:53.960 --> 36:59.960]  You know, that's innocuous, but what it tells me is the immune status of these individuals who have gotten the shot.
[36:59.960 --> 37:03.960]  We're literally weakening the immune system of these individuals.
[37:03.960 --> 37:08.960]  So, and of course this vaccine, I don't like calling it that, but I guess...
[37:08.960 --> 37:09.960]  Yeah, I know.
[37:09.960 --> 37:12.960]  I always hesitate on that too. Injection, maybe.
[37:12.960 --> 37:13.960]  Yeah, I call it...
[37:13.960 --> 37:17.960]  Well, I think I'm starting to think in terms of magnetic goo, but...
[37:17.960 --> 37:19.960]  I know, there's that issue as well.
[37:19.960 --> 37:21.960]  Maybe we can go on that in a minute.
[37:21.960 --> 37:33.960]  So, in essence, we have turned the body into a factory for making a protein, which for all intents and purposes, is a prion.
[37:33.960 --> 37:34.960]  In terms of...
[37:34.960 --> 37:40.960]  Yeah, and worse than that, they actually re-engineered the protein to make it more prion-like than it normally is.
[37:40.960 --> 37:47.960]  Because they have milked with the protein structure to give it a pair of prolings that are next door to each other.
[37:47.960 --> 37:53.960]  Two prolings, they've modified the prion. They've modified the spike protein in the design for the vaccine.
[37:53.960 --> 37:57.960]  Such that, and they did that so that it couldn't go into the membrane.
[37:57.960 --> 37:58.960]  So, they wanted it to stay.
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.960]  So, basically, the protein is made by these cells under instruction from the vaccine.
[38:03.960 --> 38:06.960]  And then it's released and exposed on their membrane.
[38:06.960 --> 38:09.960]  It attaches to ACE2 receptors.
[38:09.960 --> 38:14.960]  And then it needs to be exposed to the immune cells so they can make their antibodies.
[38:14.960 --> 38:20.960]  The whole point is to have these cells collaborate with each other and one cell exposes them, another one makes the antibodies.
[38:20.960 --> 38:26.960]  And they thought it was really a good idea not to let it go into the membrane because then it would sort of expose itself.
[38:26.960 --> 38:29.960]  There's like a critical part it wants the antibodies to be able to see.
[38:29.960 --> 38:34.960]  And they've mucked with the protein so that it can't snap into place and go into the membrane.
[38:34.960 --> 38:39.960]  So, it stays stuck to the ACE2 receptors, which I think is really, really bad because it suppresses them.
[38:39.960 --> 38:45.960]  Many papers have shown that the spike protein suppresses the ACE2 receptors, and that's causing a lot of these other symptoms that we're seeing.
[38:45.960 --> 38:50.960]  Heart problems and blood problems, you know, thrombosis and loss of platelets.
[38:50.960 --> 38:55.960]  All these things are happening in response to this shutdown of the ACE2 receptor.
[38:55.960 --> 39:05.960]  Because, firstly, the COVID spikes end up in the blood and the nanoparticles are absorbed into the vascular endothelium.
[39:05.960 --> 39:15.960]  And so, the vascular endothelium is going to end up covered with spike proteins because that's where these little capsules of messenger RNA are absorbed.
[39:15.960 --> 39:27.960]  And so, I set out to then investigate that theory by doing a blood test called a D dimer, which is a blood test that detects blood clots.
[39:27.960 --> 39:29.960]  It detects recent blood clots.
[39:29.960 --> 39:37.960]  And so, the test has to be done between four and seven days after the injection to see whether clotting had occurred.
[39:37.960 --> 39:47.960]  Because it seemed to me that the blood clots that were occurring in my patients were most likely microvascular, which meant they were very small,
[39:47.960 --> 39:53.960]  too small to be detected on any CT scan or MRI or any medical imaging.
[39:53.960 --> 40:01.960]  They were too small and too scattered. And this made sense because we know these things get absorbed into the capillary networks in very small vessels.
[40:01.960 --> 40:08.960]  So, I then managed to find a group of people in my practice who had had their injection the week before.
[40:08.960 --> 40:17.960]  And in some, I was able to get them to do a blood test even before their injection to get a baseline.
[40:17.960 --> 40:23.960]  But in some of them, I was just only able to catch them and find two because I didn't know who was getting these shots.
[40:23.960 --> 40:25.960]  I haven't been involved in giving them to them.
[40:25.960 --> 40:33.960]  Anyway, the bottom line is I found approximately 62% of people have an elevated D dimer test,
[40:33.960 --> 40:42.960]  which means that 62% of people are getting microvascular blood clots directly following this shot.
[40:42.960 --> 40:55.960]  So the alarming part about this is that these people had no idea that they had blood clots because these blood clots are so scattered and so small,
[40:55.960 --> 40:58.960]  their symptoms were very nonspecific.
[40:58.960 --> 41:09.960]  But if you think of some of the frequent side effects from the shot, people often get headache, they get fatigue, they get nausea, they get dizziness.
[41:09.960 --> 41:13.960]  All of those would be symptoms of tiny blood clots in your brain.
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.960]  The spike protein is well known to cross the blood brain barrier.
[41:17.960 --> 41:24.960]  It causes the brain to look like a sponge or a spongiform encephalopathy, which is frequently called mad cow disease.
[41:24.960 --> 41:30.960]  It causes Alzheimer's disease with what's called Lewy body formation, these prions in the brain.
[41:30.960 --> 41:35.960]  It causes damage to the heart because this inflammation of blood clotting is occurring all over the body.
[41:35.960 --> 41:39.960]  It's not going to be consistent that everybody's going to have to see that outcome.
[41:39.960 --> 41:44.960]  I've got like five more of these, and that's just the clips I got today.
[41:44.960 --> 41:48.960]  I've got the head virologist in France, the most respected, saying the same thing.
[41:48.960 --> 41:51.960]  He speaks English. You'll hear from him.
[41:51.960 --> 41:55.960]  And I've got all these other top scientists.
[41:55.960 --> 42:03.960]  So again, not about hearing Alex Jones say it, it's about what they're saying, and this is in the medical literature, and I want to explain something.
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.960]  That's what happened in the mice. The blood clots began to grow immediately and usually killed them in six months to a year.
[42:08.960 --> 42:13.960]  A mouse or mice or rats only live a few years, so their lifespan is accelerated.
[42:13.960 --> 42:22.960]  With humans, it's a guesstimation by Sherry Tenpenny and other daughters, but they said generally rats, it's like rat years versus dog years versus horse years versus human years.
[42:22.960 --> 42:26.960]  But if it's killing a rat in six months, it's going to kill a human in five years.
[42:26.960 --> 42:29.960]  I mean, depending on how it hits your body and what it does.
[42:29.960 --> 42:32.960]  So it might kill you in a year. It might kill you right away. It might kill you in 10 years.
[42:32.960 --> 42:43.960]  The point is, it starts growing the crystals and blocking your smaller vessels, then it gets bigger and bigger, and then it starts creating lesions on the lungs, the brain, and that's why people bleed out and die so quickly.
[42:43.960 --> 42:47.960]  So it's just how fast will these crystals grow in you?
[42:47.960 --> 42:53.960]  And the worst part is, once the inoculated take this, they then shed priles on us, they start producing them.
[42:53.960 --> 42:57.960]  Yeah, the people that take the shots are now walking bio-weapons.
[42:57.960 --> 43:03.960]  For only one week, we're running Boost Your Body's Natural Defenses Supercell.
[43:03.960 --> 43:09.960]  And we have the vitamin D3 gummies with calcium, 50% off, so essential for your immune system.
[43:09.960 --> 43:16.960]  Vitamin C, zinc, and rose hips, very strong formula. This is 50% off and at FullWarStore.com.
[43:16.960 --> 43:26.960]  Now back at stock, just came back in yesterday, very powerful pure turmeric extract tincture, not as your immune system, but for inflammation and a lot more.
[43:26.960 --> 43:29.960]  And then, it's sold out for more than six months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[43:29.960 --> 43:34.960]  We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with natural peppermint and so much more.
[43:34.960 --> 43:41.960]  Back at stock from Dr. Jones Naturals and The Mouthwash with the activated charcoal and essential oils is back at stock.
[43:41.960 --> 43:44.960]  These are great products, they're high quality, and they fund the InfoWars.
[43:44.960 --> 43:48.960]  So thank you all for your support. Check them out today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[43:48.960 --> 43:54.960]  The sale runs for only one week. It is the Boost Your Body's Natural Defenses Supercell.
[43:54.960 --> 43:58.960]  And, another part of the sale ending is the privacy pouches for your cell phone.
[43:58.960 --> 44:02.960]  So what's the most important part, let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[44:02.960 --> 44:10.960]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegor.
[44:10.960 --> 44:21.960]  Paraboforce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[44:21.960 --> 44:29.960]  Some people get 15 hours out of it, some people get about 8 hours, but people take this, people are taking sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[44:29.960 --> 44:35.960]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[44:35.960 --> 44:38.960]  It's a total solution, all around the best you're going to find.
[44:38.960 --> 44:43.960]  Turboforce, without you, we don't roll. With you, we search forward together.
[44:43.960 --> 44:48.960]  It's like a bulldozer without the diesel fuel. If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[44:48.960 --> 44:59.960]  If you support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind, it's a win-win, 360-together, infoorstore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[44:59.960 --> 45:13.960]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in sixth grade, and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena.
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.960]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[45:18.960 --> 45:21.960]  But when it comes to media, InfoWars has been the tip of that spear.
[45:21.960 --> 45:29.960]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[45:29.960 --> 45:37.960]  And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off on all the amazing products.
[45:37.960 --> 45:45.960]  There's not so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets. And then you fund InfoWars and Mike Lindell in the fight for free speech against the globalist.
[45:45.960 --> 45:49.960]  There's not a better place to spend your money than mypillow.com with promo code Alex.
[45:49.960 --> 45:55.960]  And if you do it, it funds the InfoWars, it funds the election investigation, and it stands up against these globalist bullies.
[45:55.960 --> 45:59.960]  Mypillow.com, promo code Alex, take action now.
[45:59.960 --> 46:08.960]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do.
[46:08.960 --> 46:16.960]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[46:16.960 --> 46:23.960]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarsstore.com.
[46:23.960 --> 46:32.960]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated, they fit almost all types of androids and iPhones, and 50% off, $14.95.
[46:32.960 --> 46:35.960]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[46:35.960 --> 46:48.960]  We've got a private label for them, FullWars on them for $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family, these systems, to educate them about what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[46:48.960 --> 46:56.960]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global system.
[46:56.960 --> 47:23.960]  They're 50% off right now at infowarsstore.com.
[47:23.960 --> 47:50.960]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, August 18th, transmission.
[47:50.960 --> 48:03.960]  All right, I'm behind as usual, we have covered a lot, I'm going to get into China, Biden, the larger global geopolitical system of why they're setting the US up like this and where I think this is going to go.
[48:03.960 --> 48:31.960]  And then I'm going to open the phones up as well and then Michael and Dell is going to be joining us in the third hour and talk about what really happened at his big conference last week, which had incredible information and algorithms and proof of fraud in multiple states and that all overshadowed by that one poison pill of, oh, we have all the proof that China hacked it and took control when it was the Democrats doing it with stuffed ballot boxes at point-blank range.
[48:31.960 --> 48:48.960]  And I've been involved with Trump and Robert Barnes and everybody during the whole debacle, actually trying to prove the real fraud, trying to get the signatures, all of it, and everybody went off down the rabbit trail, the machines, and that's been proven now to be a distraction.
[48:48.960 --> 49:00.960]  It was, remember the US Postal Service Driver, he was driving from one state to another and the whole vehicle was full of giant boxes of ballots, so he opened it up.
[49:00.960 --> 49:06.960]  That's their prerogative, you know, they think something's wrong and what was it?
[49:06.960 --> 49:14.960]  All printed by a computer, not written with a pen, perfect flat ballots, hadn't gone, you know, already filled out for Joe Biden.
[49:14.960 --> 49:18.960]  That's how they did it. That's how they did it.
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.960]  With the vans pulling up in Michigan and Pennsylvania and, you know, in the middle of the night, that's how they did it and I love Lindell.
[49:24.960 --> 49:30.960]  He's doing more than anybody, exposing the fraud and has all this courage, so we'll get his take on that, where he's going from there.
[49:30.960 --> 49:34.960]  Don't forget, he's a huge sponsor of ours, been a big supporter of ours.
[49:34.960 --> 49:42.960]  We would be in the red right now, it wasn't for Mike Lindell, and right now we're in the black a little bit, thanks to you supporting what he's doing, getting great progress at the same time.
[49:42.960 --> 49:53.960]  So whether it's shoes and slippers or whether it's crate towels or amazing sheets are obviously his whole lot of groundbreaking pillows and in human beds that are revolutionary and cat beds and dog beds and American flags.
[49:53.960 --> 50:02.960]  Made America and his great book, all of it, MyPillow.com, up to 66% off, the best pillows you're going to find with promo code A-L-E-X.
[50:02.960 --> 50:13.960]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex. And then separately, again, I haven't come up with new specials, I was in there for an hour this morning, and they're like, you don't have a lot of product in, you keep running sales.
[50:13.960 --> 50:22.960]  We've got stuff on order, a lot of it comes in in six weeks, you've got to stop doing sales, and then it was 10 o'clock in the morning, I'd come over here and do the show to get ready.
[50:22.960 --> 50:32.960]  And they just said, run the sale one more day, and then after the show, I'm going to go over there and try to figure out what we've got, what we can sell, because supply chain breakdowns are just insane.
[50:32.960 --> 50:39.960]  With anything like a supplement that's got a lot of high quality ingredients that are the highest standard. We can put crap in it all day long, we don't do that.
[50:39.960 --> 50:51.960]  And there's huge supply chain stuff in the news right now taking place. T-shirts are easy, all caps are great, but people buy very little of those compared to supplements or things like that.
[50:51.960 --> 50:56.960]  So buy some T-shirts please, they're great, they spread the word too, and we have no shortage of T-shirts.
[50:56.960 --> 51:01.960]  We get all the T-shirts we want, made right here in America, printed America, hiring Americans, everything.
[51:01.960 --> 51:06.960]  But, and I'm not complaining, I'm just saying, last day to get X2, survival shield, deep breath crystal, I-9.
[51:06.960 --> 51:13.960]  Last day to get the privacy pouches to block the contact tracers and hackers with 11 free bumper stickers with it, $14.95.
[51:13.960 --> 51:20.960]  Last day today, look at that great Info Wars, don't tread on me modern rattlesnake flag, that is pretty kick butt looking.
[51:20.960 --> 51:26.960]  It's all there at infowarstore.com, but the bodies, the vitamin C, all that's sold out actually.
[51:26.960 --> 51:31.960]  We've got the turmeric left, we've got the X2 left, we've got the toothpaste back in, that's going to continue.
[51:31.960 --> 51:33.960]  The toothpaste will continue at 33% off.
[51:33.960 --> 51:39.960]  Alright, enough about that, thanks for your support. We do not have George Soros as our sugar daddy, you are our supporters.
[51:39.960 --> 51:41.960]  You are the Info War and I salute you.
[51:41.960 --> 51:43.960]  Okay, let me shut up and finish up with this.
[51:43.960 --> 51:56.960]  We only played part of it, let's go to medical doctor, Dr. Richard Fleming talking about the spike proteins, and then we'll go to another top scientist.
[51:56.960 --> 52:00.960]  The spike protein is well known to cross the blood brain barrier.
[52:00.960 --> 52:07.960]  It causes the brain to look like a sponge or a spongiform encephalopathy, which is frequently called mad cow disease.
[52:07.960 --> 52:13.960]  It causes Alzheimer's disease with what's called Lewy body formation, these prions in the brain.
[52:13.960 --> 52:18.960]  It causes damage to the heart because this inflammation of blood clotting is occurring all over the body.
[52:18.960 --> 52:25.960]  It's not going to be consistent that everybody's going to have the same bad outcome and it's going to slowly but surely take place over time.
[52:25.960 --> 52:33.960]  And I remember raising the question back in March that there was no way in the world that these vaccines, these drug-vaxxed
[52:33.960 --> 52:41.960]  subjects that they were coming out with, could have the immune response they were doing unless there was something else beside the genetic code for the spike protein.
[52:41.960 --> 52:43.960]  And it looks like there is.
[52:43.960 --> 52:52.960]  They're actually called self-amplifying mRNAs, which means it also carries the genetic code to make more and more and more of the spike protein.
[52:52.960 --> 52:58.960]  If I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying that then these instructions can themselves self-replicate,
[52:58.960 --> 53:04.960]  which means this may be an ongoing transformation of people's bodies into spike protein factories.
[53:04.960 --> 53:07.960]  Am I hearing you correctly?
[53:07.960 --> 53:09.960]  Right, so for a variety of reasons, that's right.
[53:09.960 --> 53:19.960]  First off, there's now two published papers that show that the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, even if it's just for the spike protein, can get into your DNA.
[53:19.960 --> 53:21.960]  That's called reverse transcription.
[53:21.960 --> 53:24.960]  And that's something that we've known about in science since HIV.
[53:24.960 --> 53:26.960]  So we know it gets back into your DNA.
[53:26.960 --> 53:30.960]  We know it gets into all but three of the human chromosomes.
[53:30.960 --> 53:33.960]  We know that it keeps replicating itself.
[53:33.960 --> 53:37.960]  We know that the injections don't stay at the site of injection.
[53:37.960 --> 53:39.960]  And we have known that since 2017.
[53:39.960 --> 53:42.960]  This is not brand new to the world.
[53:42.960 --> 53:48.960]  Moderna had a lipid nanoparticle influenza vaccine that they did studies on in the animals.
[53:48.960 --> 53:55.960]  And when they injected in the animals, that spread to the brain, the heart, the liver, the spleen, the bone marrow, all throughout the animal.
[53:55.960 --> 54:03.960]  So to prove that they thought that this was going to say right where it was, was just, it's their line.
[54:03.960 --> 54:09.960]  And by the way, we have congressional hearings saying the exact same thing last year and this year.
[54:09.960 --> 54:10.960]  This is all fact.
[54:10.960 --> 54:12.960]  And now they're rolling it out against our children.
[54:12.960 --> 54:14.960]  Are we going to put up with this?
[54:14.960 --> 54:18.960]  I mean, Jeffrey Dahmer injected bleach in people's brains to make them slaves.
[54:18.960 --> 54:22.960]  They're doing basically the same thing with prions here, mad cow disease.
[54:22.960 --> 54:24.960]  I mean, they are really going for broke here.
[54:24.960 --> 54:26.960]  Now I'm going to play this doctor.
[54:26.960 --> 54:30.960]  This is Dr. Sachart Bakati.
[54:30.960 --> 54:32.960]  I pronounced that right.
[54:32.960 --> 54:33.960]  Very prestigious scientist.
[54:33.960 --> 54:34.960]  The whole bios online.
[54:34.960 --> 54:35.960]  You look it up.
[54:35.960 --> 54:36.960]  Who does a visual.
[54:36.960 --> 54:38.960]  So this is not good for radio listeners, but it's still important.
[54:38.960 --> 54:44.960]  TV viewers can see it where he explains what the spike proteins do in the studies when you take the second shot.
[54:44.960 --> 54:46.960]  Here it is.
[54:46.960 --> 54:54.960]  Now, the terrible thing is this.
[54:54.960 --> 55:04.960]  If you have the first shot, these spike proteins are going to protrude out into the bloodstream and they will meet the killer lymphocytes.
[55:04.960 --> 55:10.960]  But in the first five to seven days, there will still not be any antibodies.
[55:10.960 --> 55:28.960]  However, after that, when the antibodies come, these antibodies are going to buy in these spikes and complement is going to be activated and complement is going to riddle the special wall with its bullets.
[55:28.960 --> 55:38.960]  It is known by the way, and this has also been published that if the vaccination is repeated, this is the second shot.
[55:38.960 --> 55:41.960]  The IDG immediately rises further.
[55:41.960 --> 55:42.960]  All right.
[55:42.960 --> 55:50.960]  And I think you will remember that Michael showed you that this mRNA circulates for many days.
[55:50.960 --> 55:53.960]  So what happens then after this effort?
[55:53.960 --> 55:56.960]  I'm trying to give you a piece of advice, everyone.
[55:56.960 --> 56:04.960]  If you had a first shot and got away with it, thank God, thank the Lord, but don't take the second shot.
[56:04.960 --> 56:10.960]  Because when you take the second shot, you are going to be asking for big troubles, why?
[56:10.960 --> 56:25.960]  Because now, outcome the spikes, now the antibodies are there as we know, then the complement system has no other way.
[56:25.960 --> 56:27.960]  It has no choice.
[56:27.960 --> 56:28.960]  It has no brain.
[56:28.960 --> 56:31.960]  It's going to riddle this vessel with holes.
[56:31.960 --> 56:34.960]  And this vessel is going to leak.
[56:34.960 --> 56:35.960]  All right.
[56:35.960 --> 56:37.960]  Now, this is a leak.
[56:37.960 --> 56:46.960]  And if the mRNA is still in the blood circle here, and it is, then it's going to leak out.
[56:46.960 --> 56:48.960]  Maybe this is the liver.
[56:48.960 --> 56:50.960]  So a liver cell would take this up.
[56:50.960 --> 56:51.960]  All right.
[56:51.960 --> 56:58.960]  Very bad thought or the pancreas or the heart or the brain.
[56:58.960 --> 57:03.960]  These are terrible, terrible thoughts.
[57:03.960 --> 57:08.960]  And that's why all these top scientists went on TV before they even launched the vaccine and said, it's going to kill a bunch of people.
[57:08.960 --> 57:11.960]  Even on Fox News, they had procedure scientists on.
[57:11.960 --> 57:17.960]  And now they went ahead with it and see, they think when people get poisoned, they'll live in denial and say, well, there's no way they did that to me.
[57:17.960 --> 57:22.960]  So it's okay that I had a stroke or a heart attack or my mom died, my brother died, my daughter died, my son died.
[57:22.960 --> 57:23.960]  This is it.
[57:23.960 --> 57:25.960]  I mean, this is the attack.
[57:25.960 --> 57:28.960]  And so, yeah, China is important.
[57:28.960 --> 57:29.960]  Yeah, Afghanistan is important.
[57:29.960 --> 57:35.960]  But all of its window dressing to worldwide martial law run by the UN with deadly clotting shots are putting in us.
[57:35.960 --> 57:36.960]  And that's just the beginning.
[57:36.960 --> 57:39.960]  We know these shots also cause cancer on record.
[57:39.960 --> 57:42.960]  I mean, within weeks, the cancers are exploding.
[57:42.960 --> 57:44.960]  These are kill shots.
[57:44.960 --> 57:45.960]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[57:45.960 --> 57:48.960]  Stay with us.
[57:48.960 --> 57:56.960]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six plus months of where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.
[57:56.960 --> 57:58.960]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago.
[57:58.960 --> 58:00.960]  It became a best seller within six months.
[58:00.960 --> 58:04.960]  And now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain, we haven't had it.
[58:04.960 --> 58:07.960]  Finally, it came back in a limited supply.
[58:07.960 --> 58:08.960]  Believe me, I'm happy too.
[58:08.960 --> 58:10.960]  It's a great toothpaste and it funds the info war.
[58:10.960 --> 58:14.960]  So if you want to get it and stock up on it because you were already a fan or you haven't tried it.
[58:14.960 --> 58:23.960]  It's back in stock at infowarstore.com discounted because of the COVID lockdown because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America.
[58:23.960 --> 58:25.960]  It's not been available for over six months.
[58:25.960 --> 58:34.960]  But now it's back in stock and it's available in only two places infowarstore.com and Dr. Jones naturals.com.
[58:34.960 --> 58:37.960]  It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.
[58:37.960 --> 58:48.960]  So get your activated charcoal toothpaste activated charcoal mouthwash with central oils and more at infowarstore.com and fund the info war a true 360 win.
[58:49.960 --> 58:54.960]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[58:54.960 --> 58:56.960]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[58:56.960 --> 59:01.960]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[59:01.960 --> 59:04.960]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[59:04.960 --> 59:08.960]  And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew.
[59:08.960 --> 59:11.960]  You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[59:11.960 --> 59:18.960]  So I took it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[59:18.960 --> 59:21.960]  You know, I could think again. I could connect with people again.
[59:21.960 --> 59:27.960]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[59:27.960 --> 59:30.960]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[59:30.960 --> 59:35.960]  The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[59:35.960 --> 59:38.960]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[59:38.960 --> 59:40.960]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[59:40.960 --> 59:44.960]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[59:44.960 --> 1:00:05.960]  I beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:14.960]  In the interest of time, I'm not going to play the so-called surgeon general and the clip I have. It's right here. Maybe I should play it.
[1:00:14.960 --> 1:00:21.960]  Saying, oh, learned immunity, natural immunity is not as good as this Pfizer shot.
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:31.960]  When on record, all the literature shows this is terrible lowers your immunity long term, doesn't protect you as a fraud and that learned immunity is the gold standard.
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:37.960]  And then now these Pfizer shots, Moderna shots actually attack your white blood cells, your killer white blood cells.
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:40.960]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:42.960]  And what happens when they turn those off?
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:47.960]  White blood cells, killer white blood cells go around eating cancer.
[1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:53.960]  And what do your lymph nodes do? They grab cancer, they take it to it, they get rid of it. That's like an execution depot.
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:58.960]  You turn those off suddenly, there's a jailbreak, the cancer takes over.
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:06.960]  That's a layman's term of putting it. And then, you know, then you're Roger Stone's wife, take the Pfizer shot and get cancer two weeks later. Very sad.
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:11.960]  So here's Dr. Harvey Rice talking about natural immunity.
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:18.960]  Yeah, I had to bring you guys on for this because I think I had five or six emails in the course of an hour, one hour.
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:22.960]  I don't know what was going on this weekend about the Lambda variant, so I had to get your take on that.
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:32.960]  All right, I want Dr. Rice you to respond to what we heard from Biden's surgeon general today on my favorite topic, natural immunity.
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:41.960]  We are seeing more and more data that tells us that while you get some protection from natural infection, it's not nearly as strong as what you get from the vaccine,
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:46.960]  especially with the Delta variant, which is the heartiest and most contagious variant we've seen today.
[1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:51.960]  We need all the protection that we can get. That's why the vaccines are so effective.
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:54.960]  Dr. Rice, really?
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:02:01.960]  Well, really not. This is contrary to 50 years of virology and vaccinology.
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:09.960]  The vaccines, of course, if you give a strong enough vaccine, you can make antibodies at almost any level you want, but that's not immunity.
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:20.960]  Immunity is how the person responds to an infection and natural immunity is much stronger and much broader and much deeper and much longer lasting than vaccine immunity.
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:36.960]  And we have over and over now data showing how long natural immunity, having had COVID immunity, survives and lasts compared to the three to five or six months of vaccine immunity before you need booster after booster after booster.
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:40.960]  And that's a Yale epidemiology professor, one of the most respected in the world.
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:48.960]  Here's another respected doctor, Dr. Taryn Clark, on the biggest false flag, the biggest red flag you see from Big Pharma.
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:57.960]  I want to show you a couple of these and tell you that your biggest red flag for propaganda from public health is experts say.
[1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:02.960]  They're not saying the data shows. They're not saying the study shows. They say experts say.
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:07.960]  And so as we read this, this is a tweet from the CDC.
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:14.960]  Pregnant? You may discuss COVID-19 vaccines with your doctor, but it's not required before vaccination.
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:26.960]  While studies have not yet been done, experts believe mRNA vaccines like COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk for hashtag pregnant people.
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:34.960]  If I recommend that a pregnant woman takes vitamin D, I have her ask her obstetrician.
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:39.960]  We don't put anything in a pregnant woman's body without asking her obstetrician.
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:43.960]  And here you have the CDC basically saying, you don't really need to talk to your doctor.
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:50.960]  And some mysterious expert says, no studies, but we say it's okay.
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:54.960]  I wonder if I were pregnant woman, I would be thinking, can I talk to this expert?
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:58.960]  Can I ask them my questions about this vaccine?
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:02.960]  Should I sue them if I have a side effect?
[1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:05.960]  It's on and on.
[1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:09.960]  Here's another one. I've already had COVID-19, so I don't need to be vaccinated.
[1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:14.960]  This is a myth, according to public health. Doctors know this is a fact.
[1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:23.960]  We have a broad and durable immune response to COVID, and there are multiple studies that document that we do not need to be vaccinated.
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:29.960]  And yet we have these statements. You should still get vaccinated, health experts say.
[1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:34.960]  This is corporations creating a new dark age, erasing all the science, saying they're science.
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:39.960]  When somebody says, hey, don't talk about your doctor, just take this.
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:42.960]  Even all literature says pregnant women shouldn't take any of this stuff.
[1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:49.960]  Oh, hey, you can trust us, even though you've got immunity, you need to take another shot.
[1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:54.960]  Even though all the literature says all the science shows, all the studies show, you've had COVID,
[1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:59.960]  and you take a vaccine that can kill you in anaphylactic shock.
[1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:05.960]  You say you want to fight tyranny. You say you want to fund the Second American Revolution.
[1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:07.960]  I know you do. That's why you're here.
[1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:13.960]  So I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening right now to understand that there are really two places in the media
[1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:17.960]  that don't back down and that tell the truth, that have great products that are self-funded.
[1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:23.960]  And that's infowarstore.com with the supplements, the books, the films, the water filters, the air filters, all of it,
[1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:26.960]  and Mike Lindell and MyPillow.com.

[1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:57.960]  because we're sponsored by patriots like you and we're thankful and we will never back down to the globalist.
[1:05:57.960 --> 1:06:25.960]  So, thank you so much for your support.
[1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:29.960]  All right, we are back live thanks to you.
[1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:33.960]  You are the gravity that holds us in the sky.
[1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:40.960]  It is your will which empowers info wars and that's why from the bottom of my heart,
[1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:47.960]  I salute all of you of every race, color and creed that have red blood that love liberty and justice and love God.
[1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:51.960]  I stand with you now, tomorrow and forever.
[1:06:51.960 --> 1:07:01.960]  Thank you again for joining us on this live August 18 transmission.
[1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:07.960]  We have Michael and Dell joining us coming up in the third hour.
[1:07:07.960 --> 1:07:10.960]  I want to open the phones up again some this hour.
[1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:14.960]  But I only want to take about 10 calls because I don't want to leave people on hold.
[1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:19.960]  Next hour, Michael and Dell's on so we're going to put 10 calls on the board.
[1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:24.960]  We're going to go to your calls before the cellar ends and cover a lot of news.
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:25.960]  It's all free number.
[1:07:25.960 --> 1:07:30.960]  I want to get your take on the Afghan situation, the China situation, China threatening to invade Taiwan,
[1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:34.960]  saying America's weak by the globalists have done this where you see it going.
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:39.960]  25th Amendment, the targeting of our children with these poisonous injections.
[1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:40.960]  What is your line in the sand?
[1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:42.960]  What are you doing to fight these tyrants?
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:48.960]  There's also all these amazing videos of people waking up and confronting the globalist a lot.
[1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:51.960]  Of exciting things happening, a lot of scary things.
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:54.960]  But man, we are here in the middle of it.
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:58.960]  I know why a lot of people see this stuff going on and decide to live in denial.
[1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:00.960]  I kind of want to myself.
[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:02.960]  I mean, I've known this was coming forever.
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:07.960]  But I personally am the type of person that will just be honest with listeners.
[1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:10.960]  And I know you're going through a lot because I'm going through a lot too.
[1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:15.960]  Processing this, processing what we're up against is something that we got to reach out to God,
[1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:19.960]  give it to God, talk to God and just make it through it and realize the enemy is counting on us,
[1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:20.960]  getting depressed.
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:22.960]  The enemy is counting on us, getting angry.
[1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:25.960]  They're counting on us, lashing out stupidly or giving up.
[1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:27.960]  And we're not going to do that for the children.
[1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:30.960]  We're going to get even more hardcore, more focused, more dedicated.
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:37.960]  We're going to speak out and expose their agenda and block their agenda through civil disobedience every damn way we can.
[1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:42.960]  When I'm putting my finger at you telling you that, I got three more pointed back at me because
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:50.960]  in a gut level, watching them do this, physically, physically, I'm ready to fight.
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:56.960]  And that we have to understand that we are an advanced species and advanced creatures
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:02.960]  and that the enemy has set this up where they want a physical conflict in the paradigm they're in right now.
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:07.960]  And they could definitely use that in the United States to accelerate China's takeover of the planet.
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:11.960]  And that's exactly what China is planning as a civil war here in America.
[1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:14.960]  So even though every indicator is we need that physical civil war,
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:20.960]  to understand it's part of a larger plan where, yeah, once the idiot leadership of the military has been rolled up
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:24.960]  and once the corrupt people at the top of the Justice Department have been dealt with,
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:33.960]  the country will be so badly damaged and in such a bad position that it will take decades to reconstitute the republic.
[1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:39.960]  And by then, the globalists would have fully taken over the planet with economic warfare and other things.
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:45.960]  We're in a Hobson's choice. We're in a Catch-22. We're in a real paradox here.
[1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:51.960]  And we've got to figure the way out of this. The only way to do it is discernment, getting on our knees to God.
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:54.960]  You know, I've been playing this clip the last few weeks on air quite a bit.
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:10:01.960]  Don Jr. put out a video that's only a minute long called Worst and Saigon that just illustrates what's happening.
[1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:05.960]  But why would it be done so perfectly bad?
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:10.960]  But we know why. We're going to talk about it in a moment, but here it is.
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:15.960]  Do you see any parallels between this withdrawal and what happened in Vietnam with some people feeling...
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:17.960]  None whatsoever. Zero.
[1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:29.960]  There's going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a embassy of the United States from Afghanistan.
[1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:35.960]  Helicopters and black smoke visible American diplomats, including the ambassador evacuated to the airport.
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:42.960]  At least 500 staff leaving the country so far. The embassy shuttered the flag coming down.
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:47.960]  The evacuation of Americans is continuing tonight, but it has been interrupted by sporadic gunfire.
[1:10:47.960 --> 1:11:02.960]  The embassy telling Americans to shelter in place.
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:18.960]  The toll-free number, the Guinness, is 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:21.960]  Your calls are coming up by the end of the hour.
[1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:27.960]  And I don't want to gonzo journalism right ourself in the story, but we are all of us part of the story, aren't we?
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:33.960]  We should swirl over why Twitter gives Taliban a platform while banning American dissidents.
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:45.960]  All those have watched and wrote the article, and it's got tweets in here by a lot of folks, like Mike Cernovich and others, asking why is Alex Jones is an American band?
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:54.960]  And why is Joe Rogan called a traitor for having a quote, insurrection, to saw him interview Alex Jones, but meanwhile real terrorists officially have their Twitter account?
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:58.960]  And I don't think Mike Cernovich or myself are calling for censoring the Taliban.
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:02.960]  I want to actually hear what they have to say. I want to dialogue with anybody.
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:07.960]  I think speech is there. The devil has his speech. God's people have theirs.
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:10.960]  And the real author of censorship is anything satanic.
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:13.960]  And the Taliban responded to all the challenges.
[1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:20.960]  Well, why is President Trump banned? And why is Alex Jones banned off Twitter, but you're not?
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:25.960]  And of course, then they were also being criticized in other press release, Clipple Play.
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:29.960]  They were being criticized over saying, why are you censoring?
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:33.960]  And they said, well, you censor too. And Tucker Carlson had a great point a few nights ago.
[1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:39.960]  The left toppling statues, the lefts making us all wear hijabs over our face.
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:47.960]  We know they had a love affair with radical Islam. We know they helped put the Arab spring in power all over the world, Libya, Syria.
[1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:52.960]  They tried to take over Iraq, Egypt, areas of Africa.
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:58.960]  And so we know Obama and the left and the Muslim Brotherhood are double-teaming the West, basically.
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:04.960]  And that they didn't want, once the U.S. pulled out, the 2.2 trillion had been spent,
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:08.960]  actually handed over to a legitimate government. They wanted destabilization,
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:15.960]  just like the West and Zbigniew Brzezinski set up the Taliban in the 1970s.
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:21.960]  For the Mujahideen War, and just like they were protected in 2001,
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:26.960]  and 30-something thousand were flown out in the air lift of evil by the U.S. military to Pakistan.
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:30.960]  It's the same story over and over again. It's not that the Taliban works for the U.S. government,
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:34.960]  it works for the globalist, and they know it. And that's why they're so arrogant.
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:40.960]  So here is the spokesperson of the Taliban talking about Western censorship legitimizing his censorship.
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:57.960]  This question should be asked to those people who are claiming to be promoters of freedom of speech,
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:06.960]  who do not allow publication of all information. I can ask Facebook company.
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:10.960]  This question should be asked to them.
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:16.960]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen. The left loves authoritarianism.
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:22.960]  And Tucker Carlson had an excellent piece, I don't know, it was two nights ago or last night,
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:25.960]  because I was just watching him online this morning and I was up at like 5 a.m.
[1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:29.960]  But he made the point about the left's religion and trillions spent in Afghanistan
[1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:33.960]  to try to teach the Afghan villages that men can have babies.
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:36.960]  And it was internal CIA reports saying this makes them rebel more.
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:39.960]  Why are we doing this? They know it's not true.
[1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:43.960]  But it was all the leftist attempt to make them mentally ill like us and break them down.
[1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:47.960]  They don't teach all the transgenderism and all this because they really believe it.
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:50.960]  They're doing it as a poison to sabotage the culture.
[1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:54.960]  That's why Communist China bans all the George Soros stuff in their country.
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:58.960]  They want men and women together. They put homosexuals in prison in China.
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:04.960]  And I'm not defending that. My point is, is that they say that's not allowed here. We're strong.
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:09.960]  They want to be like the 1950s United States because they know that's a strong system.
[1:15:09.960 --> 1:15:13.960]  Not all the things we're taught here are to implode us and destroy us
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:17.960]  because multinational banks own our government and they want to consolidate, implode the government
[1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:23.960]  and take full control of it. They want the political class that's offshore to get rid of the middle class.
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:27.960]  And so now they're branding a middle class as white and racist.
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:31.960]  Even the richest people in the world, according to the average income, are Asians.
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:34.960]  In the United States, the top nine groups, the most money are Asian.
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:37.960]  It doesn't matter. Everybody has a right to try to develop wealth.
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:43.960]  But the ultra super rich are offshore and they're at war with a free market economy.
[1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:45.960]  They want a vertical integration.
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:47.960]  All right. I see the phones loading up. Your call is coming up.
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:54.960]  I'll get more into China's threat to invade Taiwan on the back of what Biden just did in Afghanistan and more.
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:58.960]  I'm Alex Jones. Tomorrow's News Today.

[1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:03.960]  Hey, everybody. Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too.
[1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:10.960]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:14.960]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:17.960]  You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[1:17:17.960 --> 1:17:27.960]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:32.960]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:43.960]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10x.
[1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:50.960]  In the best part, you can go to the StrongerDefense website right now and claim your own supply of Immune 10x without paying anything today.
[1:17:50.960 --> 1:18:17.960]  Crazy, right? Learn more about this unusual, limited-time offer at StrongerDefense.com at StrongerDefense.com.
[1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:31.960]  Think about that, because that's where we are. Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening.
[1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:38.960]  But it is happening now. And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work.
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:48.960]  So you've got to take it every few months. And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:55.960]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus. And that's in mainline studies.
[1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:59.960]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this. Need to go to prison for it right now.
[1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:19.960]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:38.960]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:49.960]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know.
[1:19:49.960 --> 1:20:01.960]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:30.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:42.960]  All right, so this is a fight between good and evil. It's about global domination. And the controllers of the planet, the dominant corporations, they don't want a powerful nation state.
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:48.960]  They don't want one that has private property in the Second Amendment. So the United States is being maneuvered towards collapse.
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:55.960]  We're being told by our leaders we shouldn't even exist. We're a shameful place. Our borders are wide open. We're supposed to pay for the whole world.
[1:20:55.960 --> 1:21:05.960]  We're supposed to have all these Afghan refugees come here. And they don't care if Biden's approval rating falls, because he's just a puppet they can replace any time they want.
[1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:14.960]  Biden approval falls below 50% for the first time in poll averages in Afghanistan chaos. The polls are all fake to begin with. He's been hated the whole time.
[1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:26.960]  It's something they installed. Taliban tells Joe Biden to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the 9 11 attacks.
[1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:37.960]  Again, putting it in our face. After Kabul, China exploits preparations of American weakness or perceptions of American weakness.
[1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:44.960]  China urges US to cut official contact and military connection to Taiwan, even though we have a treaty with them.
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:52.960]  And then I've got the article put out by the People's Daily. Chinese state media outlets says US will abandon Taiwan too once a war breaks out.
[1:21:52.960 --> 1:22:05.960]  And they say in the article, a war is going to be breaking out. Here it is in English from the Global Times of China, the official Communist Party spokesperson, mouthpiece.
[1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:12.960]  And you got to read this article for yourself. I mean, it is bad. America's done. America's over. It's going to abandon Taiwan and Hong Kong.
[1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:21.960]  The Chinese are getting ready to invade, they say, and everybody better just give up and basically threaten Japan as well.
[1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:32.960]  Haven't seen stuff like this since World War II. And they've got nuclear weapons and say they're willing to use it, continuing back with Afghanistan that signaled US weakness.
[1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:37.960]  They could have controlled the roads. They could have held the Taliban back. They could have put them on a timetable that Trump had.
[1:22:37.960 --> 1:22:40.960]  All that was thrown out the window. They were told, just do what you want.
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:47.960]  They wouldn't have got on those highways and driven in there in five mile, 10 mile long convoys unless they knew they were going to be allowed to take over.
[1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:57.960]  This was a deal set up just like you saw the Arab Spring funded by Biden and Obama then to overthrow our allies, to overthrow people that were pro-Christian,
[1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:05.960]  to kill people, to blow up churches and mass all over the Middle East. The same operation.
[1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:14.960]  Diplomat. Not even tanks can stop. Large wave of Afghan refugees heading to Europe, four to five million.
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:27.960]  Insanity. UNICEF, that's the UN, is taking the Taliban at face value on promise of a program to educate women and girls. Oh yeah, they're really going to educate them all right.
[1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:33.960]  At least they won't let men in their bathrooms though or say that men can have babies. I mean, I don't know what's worse.
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:38.960]  If you look at other flying over here though, it's almost all military aged men. I'll say this about the old Islamics.
[1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:46.960]  When you look at who's fleeing the country, they're not even letting the women on the planes. It's men first, screwed the women and children.
[1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:53.960]  Quite literally over in Afghanistan, I mean, pedophilia is a national pastime over there. That's why the left likes them so much.
[1:23:53.960 --> 1:24:03.960]  Unbelievable. Taliban troll Biden on Twitter by posing with ice cream. That's right, they've got ice cream stands now that $2.2 trillion was dumped into the country.
[1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:10.960]  They'll loot it back to the stone age quicker enough. But there they are with their ice creams saying, look, we're nice too. We've got ice cream.
[1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:17.960]  That's the whole message. If you've got ice cream, well, you're not a bad person. You've got to be nice to the Taliban now.
[1:24:17.960 --> 1:24:26.960]  After all, they've got ice cream. Meanwhile, Joe Biden takes nine vacations the last few months.
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:36.960]  So that's where we are on that front. I want to take your phone calls from Zach and Carlos and Jose and Corey and Matthew and Sue and Brian and Kim and Robert and John.
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:46.960]  We'll get to everyone of you before this hour ends and Mike Lindell joins us. Let's go ahead and talk to Carlos in Texas. Carlos, go ahead.
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:59.960]  Hey, Alex. I like to start off by saying I love Secret 12. I still got some blue bottles that you used to sell back in the day that you had to stop selling about a year ago.
[1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:03.960]  But I bought about a lifetime supply of it to support the Info War.
[1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:07.960]  Thank you, brother. We couldn't fund our operation without you.
[1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:20.960]  Yes, sir. Well, Alex, after everything I've heard on your show, I had to put my mom in the hospital. She needed oxygen and I was afraid to take her to the hospital.
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:26.960]  I didn't know what to do. I took her to the first hospital and they wanted to push the vaccine on her right off the bat.
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:30.960]  Are you vaccinated? Why aren't you vaccinated? You need to get vaccinated.
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:42.960]  And mom didn't feel comfortable being there. So I had to take her to another hospital where they wouldn't push the vaccine on her anymore. So it was very difficult.
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:51.960]  Well, first off, brother, you know that's not a vaccine. It's an experimental drug and they've run off all the nurses and doctors that said no to it.
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:55.960]  So they've got a bunch of cult members. How is your mother doing now?
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:04.960]  Well, we're able to give her to one of the good hospitals. I don't want to say the name, but there's only two hospitals where people make it out alive in Houston. There's only two.
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:10.960]  And as you know, there's a whole bunch of them. She's on oxygen. She's having pulmonary treatments right now.
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:21.960]  The one thing that they didn't tell us is they gave her remdesivir and I read all the papers on remdesivir and I'm going to have to find a way to detox her from all that crap they put in her.
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:34.960]  I was about to say that's what Fauci recommends when remdesivir has like an 8% success rate compared to hydroxychloroquine and all the other things that have like 98% success. Yeah, that's just amazing.
[1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:43.960]  Now, these hospitals are really dangerous, scary places now because they're corporate basically meat factories. They're like meat packing facilities.
[1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:53.960]  Now, the one thing that came out good is I was back home just like the way you're doing with your parents. I tried to nurse my mom back to health. I couldn't because I didn't have everything that they have at the hospital.
[1:26:53.960 --> 1:27:16.960]  But my dad, after seven days of ivermectin, bedesinide, azithromycin and charythromycin, COVID free in seven days. I didn't need anything else. He was taking zinc. I made him take vitamin D3. And you need to make a quinine supplement, too.
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:29.960]  I totally agree. I totally agree. Carlos, God bless you. And look, the moral of the story here is the system is corporate run. They're going to send a message down that is going to cause as much death as possible because that's their mission.
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:39.960]  The average nurse, the average doctor just follows orders now. And it's a scary thing to realize that we've gotten to this point, but it's because we've been asleep at the switcher.
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:49.960]  We've been absolutely asleep at the switch. And that's why you've got to be the people that wake folks up. If you're listening right now, you realize the responsibility you've got. I mean that in a respectful way.
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:59.960]  I realize my responsibility. You think I want to talk at a checkout counter when I see a bunch of little kids with double mask on? No, I got stuff to do. No, but I say, hey, I care about you and your family.
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:06.960]  Double masking that's causing pneumonia. Look up the studies. Look up other diseases, spiking in children because of the mask.
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:15.960]  And I just do it everywhere because I have a responsibility. So you have responsibility and it's going to change the world to tell folks about, hey, that forbid to show Alex Jones, you've heard he's been demonized.
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:21.960]  You ought to hear what he's talking about. You ought to hear the guest he's got. You ought to hear the callers he's got. Wow, free world news dot TV.
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:34.960]  Maybe write it down on a piece of paper for him or tell him, you know, info wars dot com. And that's the chain reaction and say, listen, if you get helped by the information there, share the URL with others and tell them to share it.
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:41.960]  And then if we do that simple human thing of human intelligence, we can override the entire globalist operation.
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:51.960]  All right, we're going to come right back and go to Zach in Colorado and many others. Stay with us info wars dot com tomorrow's news today, our backup site news wars dot com.
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:58.960]  And of course, the big video site band dot video.
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:07.960]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative. Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:15.960]  It hurts. It stinks. It's got pus coming out of it. I go to the doctor. They fix it. That's not negative. I'm not living in denial.
[1:29:15.960 --> 1:29:23.960]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet, but now it's come to the surface. That's actually a positive thing.
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:32.960]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job. They stole the election. We can't get down about that. We have forced them out in the open.
[1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:39.960]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed. They're scared. That's why instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers.
[1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:46.960]  Look what happened. No, we're a bunch of winners. They're trying to suppress us. Let our light of truth shine until everybody.
[1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:55.960]  What's happening? Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos. Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[1:29:55.960 --> 1:30:17.960]  We're going to win this together and the fight starts in FullWars.com.
[1:30:26.960 --> 1:30:31.960]  My brain was enlightened. I could think again. I could connect with people again.
[1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:37.960]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:45.960]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is Knockout. It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[1:30:45.960 --> 1:30:54.960]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:30:54.960 --> 1:30:58.960]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:31:24.960 --> 1:31:39.960]  While encouraging hormonal balance, perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male path, alpha power can help use performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[1:31:39.960 --> 1:31:50.960]  Let alpha power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health. Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny. Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with alpha power.

[1:31:59.360 --> 1:32:06.720]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:12.480]  I was in sixth grade. And we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:16.880]  in the arena. And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[1:32:16.880 --> 1:32:22.720]  But when it comes to media, Infowars has been the tip of that spear. But Mike Lindell has come along
[1:32:22.720 --> 1:32:28.160]  and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and
[1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:35.520]  other issues. And that's why if you go to mypelo.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off

[1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:40.080]  All right, folks, we're taking your phone calls.
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:44.320]  Want to race through your calls right now? Let's go ahead and go to
[1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:55.600]  Zach in Colorado. Zach, welcome. Hey, Alex, good calling in. We spoke once before,
[1:33:55.600 --> 1:34:01.040]  probably about a year ago, we're still talking about vaccines. I'm completely unvaccinated,
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:07.120]  but just also wanted to do a quick plug. If I could love all your products, probably the two
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:13.520]  favorites that I got right now that I'm using almost every day. The B12 and also the X2
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:19.360]  and kind of the best thing I could say about the X2 is if you look on the label that, I mean,
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:24.880]  I don't know if I'm letting the secret out of the bag, but serving size is one drop,
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:31.040]  not a drop or one drop, and there's 600 servings in a bottle. So I don't know anything else that's
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:36.240]  that good for you and that kind of a deal that you can get 600 of anything for that price.
[1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:40.960]  No, I appreciate your support. I really enjoy that. But hey, why I called in,
[1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:46.560]  I think it was Harrison just yesterday or two days ago, I said, what's your best predictions
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:55.200]  for the end of the Biden administration? And honestly, I see it ending as a false flag assassination.
[1:34:55.200 --> 1:35:01.680]  He has so much egg on his face with everything going on, especially Afghanistan now, and he's
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:08.400]  just on vacation. I mean, what's stopping them from one day the news headlines are Biden was
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:14.720]  poisoned that we we hadn't even seen them in over a week. So I agree with you, things are so crazy,
[1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:19.280]  and they want to discredit and collapse America on the world scene. So China can take over. I
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:23.120]  think anything's in the cards. Great point, Zach. Thank you for the call. Move it quick to get to
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:29.200]  everybody. Let's go to Corey in Florida. Corey, you're on the air. How are you? I'm good, brother.
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:35.600]  Go ahead. Afghanistan is the distraction. We have to ask ourselves, who benefits from this the most?
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:40.160]  And that would be the state in China. They are in a hole that they bug themselves into,
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:45.520]  and they need the distraction. And then even bad, this is going to clog the news cycles for weeks.
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:48.480]  And what does that distract us from? What are we not talking about them?
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:55.440]  Well, we're not talking about the global force inoculations. We're not talking about China trying
[1:35:55.440 --> 1:36:00.240]  to take over the planet. I mean, what else? No, we're just not talking about forced inoculations.
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:04.080]  We're not talking about all of that. We're not talking about election fraud. We're not talking
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:11.520]  about, you know, again, you're having Mr. Lindell. Come on. Again, this man is a saint. He has done
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:17.200]  a lot for this country in the world. And I hope that he is recognized. They're going to try to
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:21.920]  get rid of Biden. They need to get rid of him. And that's also part of this. It's a multifaceted
[1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:26.880]  issue. China is going to get involved in this. This will escalate in order to make Biden look
[1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:33.120]  bad and to get us into a large distraction from the main issues. Absolutely. Let China take Taiwan,
[1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:37.520]  blaming on Biden, then a 25th Amendment Biden, and then Kamala Harris comes in.
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:42.160]  Let China take the deeper minerals from Afghanistan. They've already been speaking
[1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:45.600]  with them, making the worst. They want to put a highway in there. This is, it's,
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:51.200]  it's all part of their plan. This is all contrived. It's all been planned. It's not inadvertent.
[1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:54.880]  The usurpations and intimidations are not a mistake. They are deliberate.
[1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:01.200]  All right. Another amazing point. Anything else? There goes Corey. All right. Let's keep going
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:06.800]  with these amazing callers. Let's take another call. Let's talk to Robert in Texas. Go ahead,
[1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:14.400]  Robert. Alex. Yes, sir. Georgetown, Texas. Conservative area. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They vote
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:20.960]  for Biden, but hello. You guys do this thing. When you get on air, you go, hello. I'm here, man.
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:25.440]  No, no, I'm doing that. I got a phone call coming in from a student that just got pulled out.
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:29.120]  It's okay. We love you. We want to talk, Robert. We want to talk to you.
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:34.240]  In school district, Westlake, they're having problems on the fake mass thing. You can look
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:40.720]  it up. A couple, they're French. A libtard went and made it like it was an assault.
[1:37:41.520 --> 1:37:48.000]  It's what they did. They've known each other for years and she pulled the person's mask down,
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:53.600]  giving the kiss on the cheeks. No big deal. Yeah, I saw them. So they're French. They knew the lady.
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:58.480]  They kissed her on the cheek as a joke and she libtarded out and turned on them just to say she
[1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:03.760]  was assaulted. I saw that. Yeah. Yeah. No, I just got done talking with the people, but anyway.
[1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:06.400]  Well, tell me about it. That's big news, Robert. Are you a lawyer or something?
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:10.160]  No, I got a seventh grade education. I'm only doing this.
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:13.360]  I'm trying to figure out why you're talking to the people that are in legal trouble
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:19.120]  for pulling the mask down. Just go ahead. Oh, I'm not. I just heard about the story today
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:23.920]  talking to somebody that knows them, but Gateway College Prep up here in Georgetown,
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:29.200]  you know how conservative that is? My son's math teacher in seventh grade is going to
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:34.240]  segregate. All heck is breaking loose right now. Oh, yeah. The left is creating total racial
[1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:38.960]  division all over the country. They're separating black from white. This is just incredible. These
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:44.800]  people, it's a total psychological war and we just grovel. They go, oh, we're anti-racist.
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:48.880]  We're going to segregate blacks to teach you how bad whites are and then segregate whites to teach
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:54.240]  you how bad you are. Screw these people. No, I wish I could put you on speaker and read what
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:58.880]  I sent off to the email, but I asked the principal because I pinned them all down today because
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:03.280]  my son's second day of school over here at Gateway. And I said, what are you going to do with stuff?
[1:39:03.280 --> 1:39:08.720]  He's a frickin' mutt. He's black, Hispanic, and white. Are we going to, which superior race is
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:15.600]  he right now? Wow. So you're saying Georgetown schools north of Austin are segregating people
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:19.520]  according to race. Thanks for the call. And nothing surprises me when it's happening all over the
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:26.000]  country, but folks, they're castrating seven-year-old boys in America. I mean, this is just a cult.
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:33.680]  We must fight racism. Now, segregate people. And we just keep growling the left. That's why
[1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:39.200]  this keeps getting worse. Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Matthew in California. Matthew,
[1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:45.120]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alec, I was calling in. You've been talking a lot about
[1:39:45.120 --> 1:39:50.400]  the cry on shedding, and that's kind of been waving like a big red flag. You seem to kind of
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:56.560]  brush over it to a small extent, but it seems like without getting the vaccine,
[1:39:57.200 --> 1:40:03.600]  then it seems that we may be at risk of inherently getting what the people from the vaccine are getting.
[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:09.280]  And I wanted to hear what, you know, your sources are saying of the serious implications of that.
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:13.680]  Well, my sources are the actual thousands of studies and scientific documents I've read.
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:20.960]  So the so-called shot you're given, whether it's Pfizer, Moderna, or AstraZeneca, or any of the others,
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:27.520]  Johnson & Johnson, they don't protect you. It has nothing to do with that. Never did. That's
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:31.040]  what they tell you. It doesn't protect you now. And they go, oh, the variant is why you're getting
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:36.320]  sick. But then the variant has been created in the body of the people that took it. So this is
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:42.640]  not even a vaccine. This is a mRNA gene therapy program, which then lowers your normal body
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:46.640]  immune system, your white blood cells, so that you become an invalid.
[1:40:48.640 --> 1:40:56.640]  So the gene therapy, people are getting this, it's incubating in the body. And then your sources,
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:01.680]  of course, like well-respected doctors across the world are saying that it's incubating in the body
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:07.840]  and then shedding out of the body and then coming to other people. So I was curious, what are the
[1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:14.000]  implications of those that are shedding coming into the body of... Yeah, sure. Can we get an
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.800]  inoculation to stop from the viral shedding? And that's what they're doing. No, they're saying,
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:22.720]  we're going to inject people, they're going to create new viruses, then we're going to give you
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:27.280]  new injections to stop those viruses. And then that will cause more mutations, because these
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:34.000]  aren't regular attenuated vaccines, attenuated tetanus, attenuated bacteria, attenuated viruses.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:37.760]  Where your body learns what it is and learns you to feed it without it replicating. That's not what
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:44.320]  this is, sir. This is a program that goes in and has your body create this spike protein forever
[1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:50.480]  more. Does that make sense? Makes perfect sense. So I'm just curious, should we be concerned on a
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:57.520]  high level of being around people who are shedding these... About half the public took it. I mean,
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:02.720]  that horse left the barn a long time ago. That's exactly what we're talking about, Matthew.
[1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:11.120]  I appreciate your call. That is exactly what we're talking about, Matthew. Is that this is a big trap.
[1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:15.920]  That's why they put up the vaccine cards a year ago with five vaccines on them.
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:19.680]  That's why Bill Gates said a year and a half ago, you will, or more than that, he said,
[1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:25.280]  you will have boosters. This has all been planned. It's all been planned out. And it's not just about
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:31.360]  poisoning the population. It's also about controlling us, tracking us, dividing us. It's
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:36.000]  just a nightmare plan. And now we're all distracted from globalism. And now they're raping us and
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:39.440]  our borders are wide open. We're going bankrupt because we're busy, trying to just be able to be
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:44.880]  an essential business or have a special pass on our phones. We go to a restaurant or go to the mall.
[1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:49.440]  I mean, this is, we're off a cliff right now. We're in to the tyranny now. And it only gets
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:43:00.960]  worse submitting to it. With a ride back, stay with us. It is through our five senses
[1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:06.400]  that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told. And the only way to see
[1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:12.240]  through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:18.160]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down
[1:43:18.160 --> 1:43:23.920]  its natural functions, natural functions, which have been known for millennia. The Hindu chakras
[1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:28.640]  align with the endocrine system. The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye,
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:34.880]  also described as the seat of the soul. The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of
[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:41.520]  consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality. Fluoride free water is essential to
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:47.600]  keeping our pineal gland healthy. Our water filtration systems with the proper filters
[1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:52.800]  will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal.

[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:07.440]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on and that its
[1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:13.120]  criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public. They do the same things over
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:18.400]  and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:24.320]  Well guess what? It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenice's globalist that
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:30.320]  ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with ACT and other chemicals that actually
[1:44:30.320 --> 1:44:36.240]  killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that
[1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:40.400]  would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[1:44:40.960 --> 1:44:47.280]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:52.080]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19
[1:44:52.080 --> 1:44:57.360]  vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV. That's right ladies
[1:44:57.360 --> 1:45:05.360]  and gentlemen. Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface
[1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:09.200]  material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth

[1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:04.240]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six
[1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:09.040]  plus months of where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash. We only came out with
[1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:12.800]  it a year and a half ago. It became a best seller within six months and now because of the COVID
[1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:18.400]  lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain, we haven't had it. Finally, it came back in a
[1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:22.560]  limited supply. Believe me, I'm happy too. It's a great toothpaste and it funds the InfoWare.
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:25.600]  So if you want to get it and stock up on it because you are already a fan or if you haven't

[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:36.560]  of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America. It's not been available

[1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:05.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:58.240]  Alex Jones, man. I'm not even about to ask how you're doing because I'm pretty sure you're
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:04.880]  frustrated right now in the North. But the reason why I'm calling in is because I wanted you to
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:10.320]  explain to me a little more so I could understand why are so many people are not and it seems like
[1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:16.160]  it's the right going after Joe Biden and I'm not defending that map, but they're going after Joe
[1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:21.440]  Biden now for doing what they were begging Trump to do back then to withdraw the truth.
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:26.240]  No, I totally agree. And Ron Paul, Ron Paul wrote an article about it. We posted they're doing
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:31.200]  cheap shots on Biden because that's the military industrial complex that didn't like Trump either.
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:36.080]  They've gotten rid of Trump. Biden got set up by his advisors and believed the withdrawal was all
[1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:39.600]  going to be handled. That's why he said that back in July. Everything's handled. It's going to be
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:43.760]  great. And then basically his own people set him up. I don't like Joe Biden, but you're absolutely
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:48.880]  right. He was set up and so to just blame Joe Biden's not good. And I hope tuning into the show,
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:55.280]  sir, you've picked up on the fact I've made that point. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. One more thing before
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:49:00.800]  you let me go. You need to go back on Joe Rogan, man. You and Eddie Brown need to go back on Joe
[1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:05.680]  Rogan. That was the best podcast I've ever seen in my life. Hey, Joe knows that. You know, I had
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:11.040]  dinner with Joe like a month ago and I brought up. I said, you got to have me back on. He goes,
[1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:15.840]  he goes, oh, Alex, you're just, you know, that's so many new people interview. And so most people
[1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:23.600]  have only been on his show. Let's just like Joey Diaz. We're only 50 times, three times. So I would
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:27.520]  love to go back home with Joe. He gets lobbied to do it all the time. It probably get 50 million
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:33.760]  views. I hear you, brother. Thank you, Jose. Yeah, that's a, that's a very complex issue about
[1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:39.440]  it's fun to bash Joe Biden and he was a puppet. He did still the election,
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:43.680]  but he was put there because he's weak by the real enemy behind the scenes. So
[1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:46.160]  anytime you're bashing Biden, you're like basically beating up a
[1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:53.200]  teriatric person in a nursing home. I mean, that's it. That's why they put him in there so they
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:50:01.360]  could have him take the blame. That's been the point the whole time. All right. Let's take another
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:11.600]  call here. Let's go ahead and go to Kim in Vegas. Welcome. Hey, good morning, Alex. Thanks for taking
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:22.160]  my call. Thanks for calling. So I have two vaccine injured grandchildren from normal vaccines.
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:33.200]  And now from the COVID vaccine, we've lost two family members. We've got one that if he makes
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:41.200]  it to Christmas, I would actually be surprised because I'm sure that his doctors are going to
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:48.560]  convince him to take that third booster and, you know, he's already had heart problem,
[1:50:49.280 --> 1:50:58.560]  blood clot problem. So, you know, but my question is we know actually my daughter,
[1:50:59.200 --> 1:51:07.760]  my mother-in-law and her husband have not taken the vaccine, but now they've gotten the new variant.
[1:51:07.760 --> 1:51:18.240]  So, my question is that if you could do some research, the people who are getting sick from the
[1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:27.040]  vaccinated, are they going to start producing the spike protein as well?
[1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:33.760]  That's a great question. We're going to get some scientists and medical doctors on to look at that.
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:40.880]  But I think the preliminary evidence says yes. And again, even Drudge Report, great. I hope Matt
[1:51:40.880 --> 1:51:44.320]  Drudge is back running Drudge Report. Whatever's been going on over there, it's been a little bit
[1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:49.840]  better lately, has a proper headline, a reality-based headline. Boosters in September, vaccines
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:55.040]  declining effectiveness against infection. Is it ever going to end? No, because the vaccines create
[1:51:55.040 --> 1:52:00.720]  new variants, and that's in the major studies. And so it's not designed to end. It's a takeover
[1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:08.480]  plan. Kim, anything else? I have another question for you, because I'm having a hard time finding
[1:52:08.480 --> 1:52:20.000]  some research on it. I was sent a TikTok video yesterday from a gentleman named Combine Brian,
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:27.200]  and it sounds like the government is taking over his combining business
[1:52:27.200 --> 1:52:39.120]  to mow over people's crops. And information I got from somebody else saying that they've been told
[1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:47.520]  to destroy a part of their crops, and if they don't do it, then somebody's spraying their field
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:53.840]  with Agent Orange to destroy their crops. Have you heard anything about that?
[1:52:53.840 --> 1:52:59.920]  No, I haven't, but there's a demoralization project happening to shut the country down.
[1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:05.520]  The federal government has paid farmers not to produce before, but send all that to Showtips
[1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:10.640]  and infowars.com. Thank you so much. Who knows? Things are so crazy now. It might be true. I'll
[1:53:10.640 --> 1:53:16.320]  look into it. Haven't heard of that. Great questions. Thank you so much. All right, let's go to Sue in
[1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:24.800]  Florida. Sue's up next. Welcome, Sue. Hi, Alex. Pleasure to speak with you. First, I want to plug
[1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:31.600]  your X2. Excellent, excellent product. All of your supplements are good, but your X2 is fabulous.
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:41.120]  The reason I'm calling is I recently resigned from my job because we were told that we needed to
[1:53:41.120 --> 1:53:48.400]  have the vaccine, and if we didn't have the vaccine, we would have to get tested weekly at our own
[1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:58.400]  expense. And I'm like, well, you know, that's not happening. So no big deal. You know, I go for job
[1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:04.080]  interview. And of course, they asked me why I left my previous job, and I told them they said, well,
[1:54:04.080 --> 1:54:12.080]  we're considering mandating it here also. Now, we'll pay for the test, but I'm thinking, you
[1:54:12.080 --> 1:54:16.000]  know, this is Florida. And, you know, I didn't really think we were going to have this much
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:20.720]  problem in Florida. It's everywhere. There's nowhere to run. We've got to face it. And again,
[1:54:20.720 --> 1:54:26.000]  the PCR test that they're still using is 100% fraudulent. It's all a scam. It's all lawyers
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:30.640]  and companies virtue signaling. And because the lawyers and the companies don't want to get sued,
[1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:34.160]  we're going to lose everything anyways, to a societal collapse. That's what people have to
[1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:39.520]  understand. This is designed to collapse industry and collapse small business that is the heart
[1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:47.120]  of the engine of our economy. And so people have to start saying no to the conflict avoidance and
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:52.480]  the liability avoidance of lawyers, because they're using that to walk everyone into this,
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:55:01.040]  you understand? Yeah. Yeah. But that's all I had. It's just very discouraging. But, you know, I
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:05.520]  know you're right. We do. We have to say no. Well, here's the deal. I'm sorry you left one job
[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:09.920]  because of this. Now, the next one wants it. A lot of it is get the job there and just try to
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:16.000]  educate the boss about it. And then let him fire you over it and sue him. Because the idea that
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:19.920]  it's one thing to mandate a regular vaccine that's approved that already has problems. Okay.
[1:55:19.920 --> 1:55:24.320]  This is an experimental gene therapy that they skipped animal trials on
[1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:30.640]  so they could get away with what they're doing now. I mean, this was all premeditated. And it's
[1:55:30.640 --> 1:55:35.200]  a big thing that Trump got suckered into. One of the only big weak parts of Trump is that he bought
[1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:38.800]  into this. But I get why he did. They were holding economy hostage. He wanted to get the vaccine out,
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:46.720]  get us going, but it's not a vaccine. So thank you, Sue, for the call. All right. That's why I'm
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:52.320]  not mad at the crew. They're doing a great job. But I said only take 10 calls so that I will just
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:57.120]  go to 10 calls this hour and not leave people hanging out there not getting on air. But that
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:06.880]  got lost in translation. And so I've got Charlie and Randy and Brian and Barry and John. And I've
[1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:10.720]  got Mike Lindell coming up, talking about election fraud and what they've discovered and what's
[1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:15.040]  coming up next. I'm really excited about this interview. So we're going to go to break. We're
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:17.760]  going to come back for a few minutes and take a few more of these calls. And then I guess if
[1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:22.080]  you're still there after Lindell leaves, we'll finish up with you. I really want to hear from you.
[1:56:22.080 --> 1:56:25.920]  I just don't want to disrespect callers. We have 20 phone lines. It's following a
[1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:30.640]  certain limiting to 10. So we break the cycle of making folks sit on hold. But I guess,
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:35.440]  comically, that is not going to be broken. Separately, today is the last day. Yesterday
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:38.640]  was going to be the last day. But today is the last day because we haven't gotten new cells up yet

[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:55.920]  So when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds overweight I had brain
[1:58:55.920 --> 1:59:01.040]  fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show
[1:59:01.040 --> 1:59:05.680]  and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked
[1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:09.520]  pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you had you know with a deep
[1:59:09.520 --> 1:59:14.160]  burden source you know and I got really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went
[1:59:14.160 --> 1:59:20.480]  from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could
[1:59:20.480 --> 1:59:25.920]  connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and
[1:59:25.920 --> 1:59:30.720]  I religiously take basically all of your supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:35.680]  the one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it
[1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:40.800]  works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist
[1:59:40.800 --> 1:59:45.600]  system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands. Beautifully said
[1:59:45.600 --> 2:00:01.520]  brother I thank you so much for your call and godspeed you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:00:15.680 --> 2:00:28.160]  welcome back Mike Lindell on the latest on his big symposium last week joins us next segment
[2:00:28.720 --> 2:00:31.520]  but right now let's go to John in Kentucky John welcome
[2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:39.840]  hey Alex I just wanted to say thank you um first time I heard you was on the
[2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:49.600]  Joe Rogan podcast and um I think everyone inherently has uh is waiting for someone
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:57.040]  to tap into that uh that void that god has for us um and you definitely did that for me
[2:00:57.680 --> 2:01:01.760]  so I thank you for that um I don't want to take up too much time but I just wanted to ask
[2:01:02.960 --> 2:01:05.520]  I really trust what you're saying about these vaccines
[2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:12.720]  and it just I can't like figure out why these people like Bill Gates and
[2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:19.840]  Klaus Schwab why have they not taken you off the air yet well they have tried
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:25.600]  they have the Democratic Party sued me almost 50 times uh they've they've been platformed
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:30.720]  us all over the place uh and so we built our own systems and it costs a lot of money to do it
[2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:36.000]  and you guys supported us to do it and and and so that's why people you know info wars is alive at
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:41.440]  bandot video and and info wars dot com but we're censored and blocked almost everywhere else and
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:46.320]  then talk radio is used to censorship so on the left tried to threaten our radio stations
[2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:50.480]  that actually got us more affiliates I mean so America still has a lot of freedom I mean
[2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:54.720]  Bill Gates isn't god Bill Gates has been kicked out of 30 plus countries did you know that
[2:01:54.720 --> 2:02:00.880]  I heard you talking about that with the shots and that's the situation
[2:02:03.200 --> 2:02:06.800]  so yeah I want to tell you is there's not just evil in the world
[2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:14.800]  John there's also good yeah yeah and and that's definitely really important because
[2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:22.880]  uh I would say I took the black pill at one time and um definitely kind of was in despair at
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:29.040]  how much evil I mean I'm pretty young and here's a good news John you know you're real you know you
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:33.120]  you love justice and freedom so you are speaking out on the air you're taking action I can tell
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:38.640]  you I'm a hundred percent real doesn't mean I'm a perfect vessel though uh and I asked myself the
[2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:42.880]  same question let me ask that question why am I still on there I think it's because of John from
[2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:50.160]  Kentucky and all these other people supporting us does that make sense yes sir think about that
[2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:54.800]  that's all very very real like why is Joe Rogan supported me during all the censorship with nobody
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:03:00.640]  else would well it's because he figured out it was the right thing to do and so there there are good
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:06.160]  people and there are bad people and when good people do the right thing we have a great society
[2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:10.800]  when good people bow down to the system we have hell on earth I appreciate your call
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:15.680]  all right we got our guests coming up so if Randy and Brian want to hold I'll try to get to you
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:20.400]  after Mike Lindell leaves I'm going to come back with Mike Lindell can't wait to talk to him
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:27.600]  about the symposium last week that had so much gold so many algorithms and proof and all these
[2:03:27.600 --> 2:03:34.640]  states and oh his experts up there and then it all got distracted by the whole china thing
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:38.160]  which I have no doubt China's bought off our government to see afar and the rest of it but
[2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:42.960]  Mike Lindell is coming up on the other side because he's the man in the arena and that's what matters
[2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:48.480]  to me is they want to intimidate everybody and not have us ask questions but 87 percent of
[2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:53.920]  republicans question the election believe was fraudulent and we've got over 40 percent of
[2:03:53.920 --> 2:03:59.440]  democrats thinking that that's almost a majority of democrats too so this is very legitimate and
[2:03:59.440 --> 2:04:05.200]  other people aren't willing to stick their head up above the grass and do this but Mike Lindell is so
[2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:10.000]  as I said man in the arena you have a big open event like that I was really worried about the
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:13.360]  event and then we were going to fly up there in the plane we're going to fly on broke down so I
[2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:19.040]  took that as an omen not to go but I wish I would have been there but the big event like that wide
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:24.480]  over the way he had it open everybody I'm surprised that it didn't didn't have more problems I see it
[2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:30.960]  overall it's about a b-plus but an a-plus for action and effort a b-plus for the information
[2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:35.520]  because a few poison pills got thrown in but I've been through the poison pills myself I've
[2:04:35.520 --> 2:04:40.080]  experienced it myself and I've been doing this like I'm not going to tell Mike Lindell how to
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:44.320]  stuff a huge American company and hire thousands of people and you know and and and do what he's
[2:04:44.320 --> 2:04:48.080]  doing I've been in the media dealing with these people forever I've already been down the road
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:52.560]  Mike Lindell's been down so I've experienced some of the staff who's he's experienced but he's a guy
[2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:57.040]  just now getting in the arena and kicking ass we'll talk to him in 60 seconds stay with us
[2:04:57.040 --> 2:05:05.040]  you say you want to fight tyranny you say you want to fund the second american revolution
[2:05:05.680 --> 2:05:09.920]  I know you do that's why you're here so I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening

[2:06:40.160 --> 2:06:45.280]  and patriotism and so he had that big conference last week for three days Wednesday Thursday
[2:06:46.480 --> 2:06:51.920]  I guess it was Tuesday Wednesday Thursday up in Sioux Falls South Dakota and I watched it and had
[2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:57.120]  all these scientists and engineers showing the algorithms showing the proof showing you know
[2:06:57.120 --> 2:07:03.440]  all this and then the media focused on one issue with one file he was given that turned out was not
[2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:09.120]  an accurate file but that's how they do it but what I love is our listeners love Mike Lindell
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:16.560]  now more than ever they get that he's a man in the arena they get that he's somebody trying to
[2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:20.640]  figure it all out we all saw the anomalies we all saw the problems we all saw in Michigan
[2:07:20.640 --> 2:07:25.200]  everywhere where Trump's way up here and then right when they close things boom Biden comes
[2:07:25.200 --> 2:07:30.400]  up over it we all saw that and so when we investigate we're going to go into all different
[2:07:30.400 --> 2:07:35.520]  areas so Mike Lindell of mypillow.com joins us right now he's also supporting the show
[2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:40.080]  so promo code alex at mypillow.com great products made in America that supports all the work we're
[2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:44.720]  doing Mike again I think you did a great job at the conference overall you're a man in the arena as
[2:07:44.720 --> 2:07:50.000]  I said five times already but describe the good the bad the ugly of the conference and I'd like
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:54.720]  to get into all the big discoveries that were made and proven that got overshadowed by the
[2:07:54.720 --> 2:08:00.320]  media distracting onto a few things uh that that that you know more than a hundred percent uh uh
[2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:05.840]  basically manifest. The thing that I don't know what you're talking about as far as uh
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:13.680]  they focused on a bad file uh there was no file focused on that I seen but let's do the good the
[2:08:13.680 --> 2:08:18.160]  bad the ugly and maybe that'll come up with what you're talking about there because here's what
[2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:25.440]  happened when I they um and I'm going to go do a timeline here so I had my own team for five months
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:32.000]  spent millions of dollars this is people that uh white hat hackers from all different um all
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:37.520]  different um walks of life I mean they're not they didn't know each other I got my information
[2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:43.200]  and got all these terabytes from four different sources by the way including Dennis Montgomery
[2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:49.440]  everybody keeps attacking this Dennis Montgomery I have validated his stuff's valid everybody data
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:55.440]  is data if you get it from the same place pcaps uh just like the routers in Arizona if they open
[2:08:55.440 --> 2:09:01.600]  them up they would match everything matches like uh like Alex says there the experts I had on the
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:08.400]  stage these guys now are scientists physicists uh one of them has four degrees these guys didn't
[2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:12.640]  know each other either before the selection they're just doing their other job they came together
[2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:18.960]  and showed the algorithms all of this stuff matches it's all the same this was a massive cyber
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:26.400]  attack it affected every single state and so when I went to have this symposium all I wanted was to
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:32.960]  take politicians from every state which we are there all 50 states were represented I wanted
[2:09:32.960 --> 2:09:39.520]  to have cyber forensic experts there and breakout rooms that which they would they would the challenge
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:48.080]  was show show us show prove that this is not election data from or not valid data from the 2020
[2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:53.440]  election that's all they had they didn't have time it would take them months if I gave them all the
[2:09:53.440 --> 2:09:58.080]  info which I would never do because they would well I found out later it's a good thing I didn't do
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:03.200]  that well anyway here's how it manifested out so then you have that and then I have all the experts
[2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:10.640]  on the stage and Alex I wanted to make break through the media finally call out the media
[2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:18.480]  you know for for seven months now I have been half to listen to to get my voice out there was
[2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:24.400]  all the left-wing media that attacks me daily well that ship sailed now now we have voices like your
[2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:30.320]  show frank speech dot com all these voices out there that now we can just keep putting out the
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:38.240]  evidence and stuff I have a show daily now at 6 p.m central time on frank speech calm and anyway
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:46.240]  here's what happened at the cyber symposium so a couple days before I was I hired a red team
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:51.920]  and I didn't know what a red team was so this red team comes in and I give them a piece of the
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:11:00.640]  just one terabyte of the data on 9 p.m on saturday night this is the 7th now all of a sudden I'm
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:07.840]  getting feedback from one guy on that red team his name is Jason or Josh Merritt now Josh Merritt
[2:11:07.840 --> 2:11:12.800]  turned out to be he's a bad guy okay I think it's all over the news right now he's the guy that went
[2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:18.800]  to the washington times it's a that is false whatever he's also a guy that put a terabyte of
[2:11:18.800 --> 2:11:26.480]  or I mean put a p-cap into those rooms that was from me from Mesa county so so what you might be
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:31.360]  talking about there um Alex is this guy yes that's what I was that's what I was getting into
[2:11:32.240 --> 2:11:37.600]  yep yep he put a p-cap in there now this so let me tell you how the timeline how we how we found
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:44.480]  all this out so we get to go you know I'm going in that election room now my guy on my team uh this
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:50.640]  guy first name is Conan this is one of my guys I've had for uh seven eight months he uh was one of
[2:11:50.640 --> 2:11:57.680]  the guys that validated all the all the data packet captures I have and so I had him and another guy
[2:11:57.680 --> 2:12:03.040]  named Todd those are the only two I had on my team from before that the rest was this red team
[2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:07.600]  well this guy in the red team kept saying he's saying these things that didn't quite make sense in
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:12.480]  that and that's a roam on the on saturday of the ninth I'm going what do you mean I've got this
[2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:18.240]  validated by everybody or I mean by many many people spend millions of dollars now we go to go
[2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:23.200]  to the symposium on the morning it started the morning on uh Tuesday morning the first thing
[2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:30.080]  Dominion did is they sued Newsmax and oan because they were going to air uh frank speech that are
[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:35.760]  run at live for the three days uh so they sued them then we get there and there was a tack on our
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:42.480]  attack on the uh our software the stuff that our servers and stuff for frank speech dot com the live
[2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:49.600]  stream service I had four backups so they attack this one this one this one on the fourth backup
[2:12:49.600 --> 2:12:57.920]  it held now this was 162 million attacks I got that number from the cyber guys now we go through
[2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:02.960]  the first day and I'm uh and we did a mock collection by the way we did a mock collection
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:08.960]  as a guy hacked into that with his cell phone uh into the machines he hacked into there in five
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:13.920]  minutes from from this so we had to restart the mock collection I was about to say that's what I'm
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:18.800]  saying that was all really powerful so much of it was really groundbreaking amazing but then the
[2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:23.520]  guy you mentioned was the one all over the news that was basically saying you had a fake packet
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:29.600]  of info and it was you you're saying it's him so here's what so here's what happened so the next
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:34.800]  day now it's now it's Tuesday or Wednesday morning I'm going here and all this stuff now he hadn't
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:41.120]  released that packet yet but all of a sudden there's a I get up there's an article released to the
[2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:48.320]  new to the Washington Times with this Josh Merritt on there who doesn't he says he's leading my team
[2:13:48.320 --> 2:13:54.720]  he's not leading a one car parade I mean this guy was brought in I just met the guy and so he was
[2:13:54.720 --> 2:14:00.800]  putting us all this stuff out into these cyber break rooms well then I told CNN I said you know
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:05.760]  what there's some bad stuff going on here I said I'm not giving all this stuff to all you guys to
[2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:12.480]  bring out and make it um alter it or make it look bad and then press I said we're releasing stuff
[2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:18.640]  and no everyone there said yes this is valid data from the 2020 election now Alex here's what started
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:25.360]  happening I flew a gallon Tina Peters we have 100% evidence now and you might have seen this on the
[2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:31.920]  news this was in Colorado Dominion and the secretary secretary of state went in her office
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:37.920]  and they and we have we have the before and after they took all this stuff and they're doing it
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:44.960]  throughout Colorado so they found out that we had this now when she came to the symposium
[2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:51.360]  her office was raided and there and they started putting all these false allegations about her out
[2:14:51.360 --> 2:14:58.800]  there it was horrific then so we got her to the symposium well then the next day this is when
[2:14:58.800 --> 2:15:05.600]  started happening um another guy I flew in from Colorado his house got raided with four little
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:12.320]  kids they took all his electronics then I got physically attacked in that and now Sheridan
[2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:19.120]  hotel 11 30 at night I get I get to my room that that attacks been out in the news they they said
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:23.600]  oh this didn't happen this didn't happen trust me it happened I just got off the phone with the
[2:15:23.600 --> 2:15:28.720]  investigator there were so many bad actors there then at one o'clock in the morning I got a call
[2:15:28.720 --> 2:15:34.400]  from the head of the red team and the red team and he said Mike we've got a guy that someone's
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:40.160]  here that's bad we found out it was um um that josh merit but he but we didn't know if he was the
[2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:44.080]  one that planned it there sure stay there Mike Lindell hopefully you do the whole hour I want to
[2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:47.680]  hear all this I want to go through the Colorado thing I want to go through you're being assaulted
[2:15:47.680 --> 2:15:52.160]  I want to give you time you're not in a rush here unless you are to tell people everyone wants to
[2:15:52.160 --> 2:15:55.360]  hear specifically how you got assaulted more stay there we got to go to break
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:04.240]  hey everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture me too but listen
[2:16:04.240 --> 2:16:08.800]  after all the research all the conflicting studies after all the squabbling there's one thing
[2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:14.400]  almost everyone agrees on it's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life
[2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:19.520]  and death you probably already believe that I certainly do so here's the thing I wanted to get
[2:16:19.520 --> 2:16:25.440]  past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate
[2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:30.640]  some efficacy in immune support now you'll have to sign a waiver but you can check out what I've
[2:16:30.640 --> 2:16:36.800]  discovered at strongerdefense.com no cures or treatments there instead little known but shocking

[2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:29.040]  a spy movie we were just talking to Mike Lindell of mypilla.com during the break he was describing
[2:20:29.040 --> 2:20:34.160]  it and I know how he feels because I've snuck into bohemian grove I've covered the black helicopters
[2:20:34.160 --> 2:20:39.120]  I've been at all the big RNC DNC events and you try to tell people in just a few segments what's
[2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:43.040]  going on you can't do it because it's so real and Mike Lindell is a lot like me it's kind of
[2:20:43.040 --> 2:20:46.880]  screaming consciousness he like remembers what he saw he starts telling you he's going to come back
[2:20:46.880 --> 2:20:52.560]  to Mara in the fourth hour for a full hour but he's got like dozens of lawyers right outside he's
[2:20:52.560 --> 2:20:58.560]  got to go to emergency meeting he did get assaulted they have the hotel footage the Washington Post
[2:20:58.560 --> 2:21:02.960]  said it didn't happen they have the proof so he's just got to go through this he's fighting back
[2:21:02.960 --> 2:21:08.080]  that's good I expected him to get attacked doing what he did so in the eight minutes we have left
[2:21:08.080 --> 2:21:12.080]  this segment Mike Lindell you wanted to go back to Wednesday the second night of the symposium
[2:21:12.720 --> 2:21:19.440]  right the second so after I got attacked then I get a call at 1 a.m. by Colonel Phil Waldron
[2:21:19.440 --> 2:21:25.840]  he was leading the red team and he said we have a report there's going to be a poison pill and he's
[2:21:25.840 --> 2:21:32.080]  giving me information now I had to make a decision at that time so I went back to my guy which was
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:39.120]  Conan and said you know what I don't want you to release any more stuff to that to those breakout
[2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:44.720]  rooms because this is I got to take this information with everything that's went on and plus this
[2:21:44.720 --> 2:21:50.080]  Josh Merritt had went public with all this disinformation that the data was wrong and all
[2:21:50.080 --> 2:21:55.520]  this stuff about Josh Merritt but my concern was you're going to give everybody data that's a classic
[2:21:55.520 --> 2:22:00.880]  thing is somebody to put BS in the middle of it right and then what they thought is they would do
[2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:04.880]  that then they would come in just like they did that guy the house just got raided with four little
[2:22:04.880 --> 2:22:09.520]  kids they took all these electronics so I made a call don't give them anymore that's when we were
[2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:15.680]  going to really drop the china stuff we had all these captures of where are the data where china
[2:22:15.680 --> 2:22:20.320]  did the attacks well and then I asked him I said do they have enough in those breakout rooms he said
[2:22:20.320 --> 2:22:25.280]  Mike they could look at that stuff for two weeks we have we've given them you know all this you
[2:22:25.280 --> 2:22:31.360]  know all this data from the 2020 election that's what I wanted and you know what so we did that
[2:22:31.360 --> 2:22:39.040]  we get through the the third day and I it was so successful because all the all my things were
[2:22:39.040 --> 2:22:45.600]  we're accomplished um and then there was a bonus of that it revealed all of this bad stuff you know
[2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:50.160]  all the bad people have revealed themselves we're we're rewriting tapes all the people that were
[2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:58.080]  there that have tried to suppress this tried to um that tried to it did these attacks um both um
[2:22:58.080 --> 2:23:03.600]  on the supposed you're saying the suppression of your event is the evidence of even more fraud
[2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:09.520]  because in a lot of time it's a war game yeah 100% and anyway here's where we come out of this
[2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:16.640]  where we leave this um uh a all the all 50 states were ended up being represented all 50
[2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:21.120]  so they were all there and they're all bringing it back to their states and they're going you know
[2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:28.880]  what we we uh the data that I have the hundred now remember everybody I have all the cyber data
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:35.760]  from the 2020 election in my possession okay I'm not going to go give it this just a good example
[2:23:35.760 --> 2:23:41.840]  I'm not going to give it to the oh go validate this it took me um I don't know six six to eight
[2:23:41.840 --> 2:23:48.000]  people didn't know each other validating data and validated it took them three to four months
[2:23:48.640 --> 2:23:53.280]  and I said so these guys there's no sense I already know it's real I'm putting that over here for the
[2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:57.920]  supreme court when we need to get when we're going to get there and here's what we here's what right
[2:23:57.920 --> 2:24:03.680]  now what everybody learned all of that data I spent two months Alex with experts for cyber
[2:24:03.680 --> 2:24:09.200]  experts saying what does this all these packet captures and data what did that manifest to
[2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:14.000]  so we put up states we put up all the states I don't know if you watch that it's on frank
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:20.080]  speech dot com right now shows what it did that cyber attack what it did to every state every
[2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:26.720]  single state was affected so now every state has standing okay eight states were flipped from
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:32.880]  Biden to Donald Trump my home state of Minnesota New Hampshire Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania
[2:24:32.880 --> 2:24:38.560]  Georgia Arizona and Nevada but every other state there was one million votes just in
[2:24:38.560 --> 2:24:45.280]  Georgia I mean in Texas and one million votes in Florida those were the two most attack states
[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:50.640]  where they flipped that's one million votes in each one of them states now we had experts on there
[2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:56.880]  that our scientists and physicists not so I'm laying out that that was impossible and as they
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:25:01.280]  described it's like going uphill on cruise control they ran out in Florida they ran out in Texas
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:07.360]  that's right and they showed how they used the 2010 voter rolls that explains why it always
[2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:12.880]  bothered me like 20 some thousand non-residents that voted well you know what Alex people are
[2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:18.640]  generally good people 20 some thousand people didn't jump across out of Georgia or Nevada and say
[2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:24.160]  let's go commit a crime and I'm going well the reason for it since they used the 2010 voter rolls
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:29.120]  which we 100 percent shown their Dr. Frank did what happened was those people don't live in
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:33.840]  Georgia anymore or all these dead people that voted that always bothered me they just use their names
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:38.800]  listen tomorrow what are you going to cover tomorrow when you do a full hour because I'm
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:43.280]  looking forward to that we're going to go we're going to go that we're going to talk about Tina
[2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:50.640]  Peters all the stuff we have in Colorado that that that happened there the cover up of Dominion
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:56.160]  what they're doing now they're going town to town state to state they're deleting stuff there this
[2:25:56.160 --> 2:26:03.280]  is the absolute biggest historical cover up to the biggest crime in history and one of the things
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:08.640]  I need to say before I get off here one of the things there that we had counterintelligence there
[2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:14.480]  that went through the place and and they're still working on a report as is the soup balls police
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:18.960]  police department the detectives on what happened to me physically but one of the things they did
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:25.280]  and true news I put out a report and you know I'm calling out all bad media I'm calling out
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:31.520]  bad media I even gave the this guy that put out the report with this associate press to to the
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:36.080]  walls the Washington Post I gave his phone number out Alex because I'm not going to take
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:42.400]  these guys doing this bad journalist anymore but one of the things that happened is true news I went
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:50.560]  out there and went after true news.com now I find out they're a great ministry and I called up Rick
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:57.920]  Wiles and here we both find out we prayed together this morning we were both set up these guys
[2:26:57.920 --> 2:27:02.720]  they're not just going over here they're trying to divide us over here and put us against each other
[2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:06.560]  sure they're running they're running major they're running major major psy ops so let me just say
[2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:11.920]  this in closing I I'm not defending Dominion I'm just saying to say the proof that they did
[2:27:11.920 --> 2:27:18.080]  something from the top what I do see is Democrats loading machines with briefcases and suitcases
[2:27:18.080 --> 2:27:22.480]  running ballots over and over again we have them we have the postal service workers saying they had
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:27.840]  whole trucks full of ballots just for Joe Biden being delivered across state lines in Pennsylvania
[2:27:27.840 --> 2:27:33.600]  to me that's the smoking gun evidence and I saw that in your symposium where they were showing the
[2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:39.360]  proof yeah but you know what that's organic cheating and that's good that's organic cheating
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:46.640]  I'm talking about what I am talking about machines and and that's what happened our country was taken
[2:27:47.600 --> 2:27:54.080]  we have 100 evidence that China used the Democratic Party and the Democrats warned us of these
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:59.200]  machines Alex they warned us oh that's another great point in fact after you leave guys find that
[2:27:59.200 --> 2:28:03.360]  two-minute compilation of Democrats attacking the machines that's your biggest defense Mike
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:09.120]  is you have Democrats saying exactly what you said right 100% they're saying what I said but now
[2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:16.560]  we have proof 100% proof of machines in Colorado or machine or machines that we can say that I'll
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:22.800]  bring it all out on your show tomorrow um where this hero Tina Peters she had we have before and
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:27.200]  after of what they taught I totally agree I thought that was the most compelling thing and I watched
[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:32.960]  almost all of the three days so let me let me tell you what we're doing before we go to the break
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:40.160]  yo if you go to crime.frankspeech.com everybody crime.frankspeech.com and you're out there and you've

[2:29:55.920 --> 2:30:03.920]  at mysolarbackup.com so when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275
[2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:09.200]  pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding onto a job
[2:30:09.200 --> 2:30:13.440]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original
[2:30:13.440 --> 2:30:18.240]  survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that
[2:30:18.240 --> 2:30:21.760]  stew you had you know with a deep burden source you know and I got really excited about that so
[2:30:21.760 --> 2:30:28.640]  I took it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened
[2:30:28.640 --> 2:30:33.840]  you know I could think again I could connect with people again and over the course of the next
[2:30:33.840 --> 2:30:38.240]  couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements
[2:30:38.240 --> 2:30:43.200]  they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout it literally
[2:30:43.200 --> 2:30:47.200]  like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is
[2:30:47.200 --> 2:30:51.680]  we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way
[2:30:51.680 --> 2:30:56.880]  to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother I thank you so much
[2:30:56.880 --> 2:31:04.480]  for your call and godspeed let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a science
[2:31:04.480 --> 2:31:10.000]  fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world government's being established where members of
[2:31:10.000 --> 2:31:15.360]  congress and former presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental
[2:31:15.360 --> 2:31:22.320]  injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your body then you're not allowed to fly
[2:31:22.320 --> 2:31:28.320]  on an airplane think about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell
[2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:34.880]  just five years ago if somebody told you this would be happening but it is happening now and
[2:31:34.880 --> 2:31:39.520]  then they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine is a gene therapy and it doesn't really work so you
[2:31:39.520 --> 2:31:44.640]  got to take it every few months and the people that have submitted say great I want to take it
[2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:49.360]  all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID even though it gets you sick from COVID
[2:31:49.360 --> 2:31:54.240]  and now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing the shedding of the virus
[2:31:54.240 --> 2:31:59.760]  and that's in mainline studies Bill Gates and Fauci did this need to go to prison for it right now
[2:31:59.760 --> 2:32:07.600]  the first time I heard the speech the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt I was in
[2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:13.440]  sixth grade and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena
[2:32:13.440 --> 2:32:17.280]  and I just remember thinking about that saying I want to be the man in the arena
[2:32:17.920 --> 2:32:22.560]  but when it comes to media info wars has been the tip of that spear but Mike Lindell has come
[2:32:22.560 --> 2:32:28.480]  along and done just as good a job as we've done maybe even better when it comes to election fraud

[2:33:39.120 --> 2:33:44.000]  breaking news and information that I want to hit we've got a new Greg Reese report that we'll be
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:51.440]  playing here in just a moment that is so important lockdown Aussies war in America you're next but
[2:33:51.440 --> 2:33:58.080]  right now let's go to Randy in Pennsylvania welcome Randy oh yeah good brother go ahead
[2:33:58.960 --> 2:34:04.480]  good I've got um so my girlfriend recently took the the vaccine and she's been in the hospital
[2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:12.960]  twice now and for cancer tests and the doctor she had was a new one but she actually said it was
[2:34:12.960 --> 2:34:18.640]  the vaccine that caused it and the last time in they were talking about running her blood through
[2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:29.040]  a machine and I mean that's bad stuff right yes sir I mean repeat what you said because I missed
[2:34:29.040 --> 2:34:36.960]  the first word okay so my girlfriend has taken the vaccine she was forced into it at work she
[2:34:36.960 --> 2:34:43.440]  thought she was going to lose her job she maybe it was a month two three weeks later she was in
[2:34:43.440 --> 2:34:50.160]  the hospital they were she was coming up positive for cancer yeah so she went and had her studies
[2:34:50.160 --> 2:34:56.720]  and the new doctor Donna Pittsburgh she was she told her that the vaccine caused this
[2:34:56.720 --> 2:35:02.480]  and she could not guarantee what was going to happen to her down the road three weeks later
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:08.720]  she's back in the hospital again and same thing's happening you know sounds like she got a good
[2:35:08.720 --> 2:35:13.040]  doctor in a good hospital I actually had it in my stack and I'm having trouble finding it but
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:17.520]  Theranos is back in the news because the trial of that lady's about to begin remember her blood
[2:35:17.520 --> 2:35:22.320]  test that would do hundreds of tests at once was always a fraud it's like PCR the whole things of
[2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:28.560]  fraud and so they were going to give everybody cancer and so they said when they started the shots
[2:35:28.560 --> 2:35:34.480]  eight months ago they go say that a cancer diagnosis isn't real just ignore it but the doctors don't
[2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:41.440]  do that and so that's what this does it turns your killer white blood cells off they eat cancer
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:47.520]  they eat other stuff mainly cancer they eat bad parts of your body cells cells stop cells start
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:53.920]  misbehaving they kill them and this thing turns those off well what's that going to do it's going
[2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:57.840]  to kill you and so man that is really scary and it what did she take the Pfizer or the Moderna
[2:35:58.640 --> 2:36:04.800]  the Moderna and then and then I got one more thing I want to say a couple years I've been
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:10.960]  listening to you about seven years now like you you changed my life but I've had a lot of new
[2:36:10.960 --> 2:36:16.000]  friends who listened to you but we bought some military trucks and we drive around and we try to
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:21.360]  you know we will print some of your stuff out and we'll spread the the news to people and
[2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:26.080]  right now I'm working on a truck that has like a a tv set on it that'll play door in a day
[2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:32.000]  and we're going to play your show 24 7 brother stuff like that in a cool truck it's total attention
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:36.720]  every mind you free is so key and every person that sees you out there doing that it lets them
[2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:42.080]  know people are waking up I'm sorry to hear this happen to your girlfriend is she pretty much awake
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:47.520]  now though oh she she's which she was awake she's a conservative she does the local showdown at
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:52.720]  Pittsburgh and like I said she was in a bad place she was going to lose her job if she didn't get
[2:36:52.720 --> 2:37:00.160]  the shot so she actually got the vaccine it's not a vaccine it's poison and she found out a
[2:37:00.160 --> 2:37:05.920]  month later no one in the office had had the shot done either she was the only one well
[2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:11.040]  that's what I'm finding is all the politicians they all say do it but the cops don't do it nobody
[2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:15.680]  does it and so just again that's conservatives we're like well we'll we'll do it some snow but
[2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:22.400]  you know I'm gonna follow the rules and I know don't do it then they say dandelion root I got
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:27.920]  a good friend who says that might help you know these people absolutely dandelion root I've got
[2:37:27.920 --> 2:37:34.080]  a whole list of things all right well I'm praying for your girlfriend and wow what a story man she's
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:38.080]  got to warn people now let's just get one more call and we'll come back next segment by the
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:43.360]  Greg race report Barry in Arizona go ahead Afghanistan withdraw Republicans impeachment
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:50.240]  abide go ahead hey um thanks for taking my call so first thing I want to address is um
[2:37:50.240 --> 2:37:55.200]  why people are wondering why the republicans are not calling for impeachment right now and
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:01.520]  what I can tell you is that they're resisting that because they do not want to raise the specter
[2:38:01.520 --> 2:38:08.640]  of Kamala Harris being the first female president so that's a big priority for them right now
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:16.160]  just to be a criticizer your anti-woman no I think they just don't want to step the precedent
[2:38:16.160 --> 2:38:22.480]  of having somebody like her you know sitting at the helm um and I tend to kind of agree with that
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:31.200]  you know well I mean Joe Biden's basically like a like a trash can a dumpster fire at this point
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:36.240]  yeah he's a basket case so it's kind of a rocking hard place but that's just my feeling about that
[2:38:36.240 --> 2:38:40.720]  so I'm kind of want to defend Trump a little bit on the whole vaccine thing and a lot of people
[2:38:41.440 --> 2:38:46.320]  kind of get stuck in this thing like you know there's there's a third option or more options
[2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:51.600]  or whatever but sometimes it's just a binary option you got you got a bad solution and a
[2:38:51.600 --> 2:38:57.520]  worse solution you know Trump had to get the vaccine out because he knew that we were not
[2:38:57.520 --> 2:39:04.320]  going to get out of this COVID thing without any pain just an impossible situation you know so I mean
[2:39:04.320 --> 2:39:09.680]  he did what he could and lifted regulations got warp speed going and the vaccines out you know
[2:39:09.680 --> 2:39:16.080]  trusting that the people developing them would you know do the best they could or you know trusting
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:21.920]  them to like do that maybe maybe they had some yeah there's no doubt there's no doubt that
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:27.120]  that's what happened there's no doubt but that we moved on from that we just Trump needs to come out
[2:39:27.120 --> 2:39:31.920]  and say I didn't realize what they did they set me up because he's going to get burned on this
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:35.600]  one way or the other he needs to get out he's already saying oh you shouldn't be made to take it
[2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:40.800]  that's not enough we need him to come out and really point things out but getting back to that
[2:39:40.800 --> 2:39:46.400]  binary option thing it's like there's there was no third option with Afghanistan that's why you
[2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:51.200]  disagreed with me the other night but when I suggested that Afghanistan should have been made
[2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:56.720]  a permanent colony or put to territory of the United States it was either going to be us doing
[2:39:56.720 --> 2:40:01.360]  that or China getting in there and exploiting it for their purpose there's no third option there
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:06.080]  Alec. Hey Barry I appreciate your call I'm going to explain this to you if we didn't prop up China
[2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:09.680]  for 50 years and give them all our jobs and one side of trade deals they wouldn't have the money
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:14.960]  and control the dominate the world we could be in Afghanistan modernizing the country because
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:20.640]  we're getting rare earth minerals instead we're put into loser positions by the big foundations
[2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:25.680]  where we predict and and pretend like Americans that we're out running the world for a greater
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:31.120]  good we're there to build evil we're there to build corruption and I don't blame troops that were
[2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:36.080]  sent for the wrong reasons and all the rest of it I'm telling you in the end game they'll take 20
[2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:40.480]  years of work and thousands are dead and 2.2 trillion and flush it down the toilet because the
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:45.360]  globalists don't want stability and they don't want wealth and they don't want success they want
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:52.640]  collapse and failure all right all Joseph Watson's coming up in t-minus 19 minutes but
[2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:56.720]  we've got several key reports that have just come out we haven't aired yet and one of them is
[2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:05.680]  lockdown to Aussies war in America you're next that is coming up next segment separately if I
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:11.600]  don't plug I'm not here on air and I appreciate you guys supporting us if I could plug once a month
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:15.200]  and fund our whole operation I'd do it but when I don't plug at least once an hour we can't pay
[2:41:15.200 --> 2:41:21.680]  our bills so please support our local TV stations and radio stations if you hear us on a local station
[2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:26.640]  tell folks about it become a sponsor or support the sponsors or send a hundred dollar donation
[2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:30.480]  into the general manager or the owners of the station and say we appreciate it because you
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:35.040]  doing that has gotten us from being on late at night most stations to on prime time and the
[2:41:35.040 --> 2:41:40.400]  stations get great ratings is truth is popular that's how we've stayed on air despite all the
[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:45.520]  platforming and internet attacks was the hundreds of radio stations out there so we could then promote
[2:41:45.520 --> 2:41:49.920]  band of video and info wars dot com we're not competition with our local stations we love them
[2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:55.760]  we wouldn't survive without them and without the compliment of band of video info wars dot com and
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:42:01.120]  the audience coming there and we barely kept our head above water yes you can go to info war store
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:06.240]  dot com and make a recurring donation or only sign up once and do it for five dollars twenty five
[2:42:06.240 --> 2:42:11.600]  dollars fifty dollars but that's that's how you fund us but the real thing to do is to fund
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:17.600]  those local radio stations call them become a sponsor support their sponsors let them know
[2:42:17.600 --> 2:42:22.720]  you support them or just make a one-time donation or monthly donation to those radio stations that
[2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:27.440]  really changes the world and then yes I extended it one day because I've got to go do this after the
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:32.880]  show look at what we've got product wasp up with a new sale all the privacy pockets that block the

[2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:06.560]  that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see through
[2:43:06.560 --> 2:43:13.280]  this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming
[2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:19.600]  too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[2:43:19.600 --> 2:43:24.480]  natural functions which have been known for millennia the hindu chakras align with the
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:30.160]  endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described
[2:43:30.160 --> 2:43:35.840]  as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[2:43:35.840 --> 2:43:42.000]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential to keeping
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:48.320]  our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your

[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:19.200]  several ossees speaking out about the tyrannical lockdowns in australia people aren't allowed
[2:48:19.200 --> 2:48:25.120]  to travel more than five kilometers from their home people who live alone were once allowed
[2:48:25.120 --> 2:48:32.720]  further to briefly visit a friend but no longer now they can only register a single person within
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:38.800]  five kilometers of their home within that five kilometers they are only allowed outside of their
[2:48:38.800 --> 2:48:46.160]  home for two hours a day and when they are out they need permission they are required to scan qr
[2:48:46.160 --> 2:48:51.760]  codes with their phones to show where they've been there are only three permissible reasons
[2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:59.280]  to leave your home to exercise or to go shopping if there is a shop within your five k bubble
[2:48:59.280 --> 2:49:06.480]  or go to work that is if you still have a job most shops have been shut down in australia
[2:49:06.480 --> 2:49:12.720]  for over 200 days and in many areas people cannot go to work unless they get the shot
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:20.160]  but if you are caught outside without an excuse you are arrested if you are not wearing a mask
[2:49:20.160 --> 2:49:27.040]  while alone in your car you are pulled over by the police the premier of australia recently said
[2:49:27.600 --> 2:49:32.800]  that this is literally a war but it's really really important for us to acknowledge and accept
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:38.960]  that we need vaccination as a key tool in fighting this this is literally a war and we've known we've
[2:49:38.960 --> 2:49:46.000]  been in a war for some time but never to this extent and seeing that only 0.032 percent have been
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:54.400]  infected we know that the premier isn't declaring war against covid that would be insane she is
[2:49:54.400 --> 2:50:01.840]  declaring war against the people and she isn't joking girls as young as 12 years old are getting
[2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:10.560]  pepper sprayed and arrested by the police for not wearing masks in 2020 australian citizens
[2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:17.360]  were being arrested for questioning the government online now they are being arrested for questioning
[2:50:17.360 --> 2:50:23.120]  the government in their own homes after being reported to the police by his wife for questioning
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:29.920]  the government an australian man was taken against his will in an ambulance to a prison-like facility
[2:50:29.920 --> 2:50:37.280]  where he was questioned told he has had a nervous breakdown and diagnosed as having a problem trusting
[2:50:37.280 --> 2:50:44.000]  authority they are building concentration camps melbourne's center for national resilience
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:50.240]  is set to open by the end of the year they call them quarantine camps but this makes no sense
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:59.040]  considering only 0.032 percent of the population is infected by definition these are concentration
[2:50:59.040 --> 2:51:05.680]  camps and they're coming to america next australia lost their guns because they never had the bill
[2:51:05.680 --> 2:51:12.240]  of rights to protect them america does but for how long what do you think people need to know
[2:51:12.240 --> 2:51:18.400]  anything that you think hasn't been said or that people really need to know in america in america
[2:51:18.400 --> 2:51:23.600]  yeah we need you guys it doesn't matter if joe biden's in the white house at this point in time

[2:51:27.760 --> 2:51:31.920]  do or die we've got china on our doorstep and the thing is if you guys don't find out who you

[2:51:57.840 --> 2:52:03.360]  percent for one person that's sick i mean this is a total joke ladies and gentlemen they cooked it up
[2:52:03.360 --> 2:52:09.120]  they released to take over now their vaccines are causing the illnesses and death is insane now i've
[2:52:09.120 --> 2:52:14.640]  dropped the ball i've been on the air two hours and 52 minutes and i was printing articles up and
[2:52:14.640 --> 2:52:19.040]  looking at articles right before i went live but i didn't think to go check info wars dot com
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:25.120]  during the breaks and stuff my fault i've dropped the ball look at this a jamie white article on
[2:52:25.120 --> 2:52:32.720]  info wars dot com it's so huge i can spend hours on this gates foundation partnered with quote
[2:52:32.720 --> 2:52:39.520]  socialist internet group running china's covet propaganda campaign soldier bill gates is a chai
[2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:46.800]  com sympathizer he said china did a great job we did a bad job i mean he is an authoritarian
[2:52:46.800 --> 2:52:53.840]  he's the one that got china opened up internet-wise to his company bill amanda gates foundation is
[2:52:53.840 --> 2:52:59.120]  partnered with the communist chinese party socialist propaganda apparatus now tasked with
[2:52:59.120 --> 2:53:03.200]  running the china's covet 19 propaganda campaign according to documents and that's why they run
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:07.360]  the major fact checkers you know the sponsors of almost all the major fact checkers in the us
[2:53:07.920 --> 2:53:12.800]  that you heard me right china funds gates and he runs that according to a 2015 memo the china
[2:53:12.800 --> 2:53:19.840]  internet development foundation the cidf and gates foundation agreed to form a cooperatized partner
[2:53:21.440 --> 2:53:28.720]  on the basis of equality mutual benefit and complementary advantage according to the cooperation
[2:53:28.720 --> 2:53:33.520]  from a random understanding of the two parties will rely on new technology such as the internet
[2:53:34.320 --> 2:53:39.760]  to promote pragmatic cooperation the fields of charity public health international development
[2:53:39.760 --> 2:53:44.480]  it goes on then they mentioned what they actually do that censor americans so let's boil that down
[2:53:46.240 --> 2:53:51.840]  they partnered with common china bill gates did to put out official lines that didn't come out of
[2:53:51.840 --> 2:54:00.000]  wuhan blah blah blah so you'd be censored if you challenge that a pretty big deal let's continue
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:05.920]  1.9 million americans listed on secret terror watch list found on unsecured foreign server
[2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:12.560]  that's right now they're saying the code keys were left open just like you're in the office of
[2:54:12.560 --> 2:54:18.160]  personnel management hack obama transferred that to china tens of millions of american citizens on
[2:54:18.160 --> 2:54:23.520]  it over two million spies and government agents 1.9 million americans listed on secret terror
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:29.120]  watch list found on unsecured foreign server the head of the security research at the firm
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:34.320]  focused on cyber security and privacy online recently discovered a u.s. government terror
[2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:41.200]  watch list being hosted by foreign ip address with no protections the researcher explains that in
[2:54:41.760 --> 2:54:47.840]  july of 2021 he found the list of 1.9 million americans online without a password protection
[2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:53.760]  or another form of authentication the watch list came from the terrorist screening center a multi
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:55:00.080]  agency group administered by the fbi the tsc and maintains the country's no fly list which is a
[2:55:00.080 --> 2:55:06.160]  subset of the larger watch list and who's on that well you know his name is nick fuentes and that
[2:55:06.160 --> 2:55:10.320]  all ties into this so the government didn't worry about jihadis hell they can come here without
[2:55:10.320 --> 2:55:15.440]  passports they're worried about you and here's the headline from reclaim the net at info wars.com
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:22.880]  dhs considers using january 6 to justify mass social media surveillance of citizens
[2:55:23.440 --> 2:55:28.240]  which they're already doing steven co barren michael more compare republicans to the taliban
[2:55:28.240 --> 2:55:34.000]  say we should be arrested mob rule twitter rolls out new tools for speedy reporting of covet
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:39.840]  misinformation washington post jennifer rubin whites must accept the demographic tide is
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:45.520]  washing over them admit america was never theirs what does that mean oh you mean second amendment
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:49.440]  right to do process that's what she wants to get rid of saying it's white
[2:55:51.040 --> 2:55:56.480]  and again that all ties into the 1.9 million americans listed publicly on a watch list
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:55:58.640]  that the government just puts out there for everybody
[2:56:00.720 --> 2:56:04.480]  and even after he reported to the government they wouldn't remove it because they don't
[2:56:04.480 --> 2:56:10.160]  care there are a bunch of incompetence robbing and stealing and raping and doing whatever they want
[2:56:10.160 --> 2:56:15.280]  but people are fighting back i started the show this day there's so many new videos of city council

[2:58:52.320 --> 2:58:57.840]  basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely
[2:58:57.840 --> 2:59:02.560]  holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got
[2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:07.520]  was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you
[2:59:07.520 --> 2:59:11.360]  came out with x2 you had you know with a deep burn source you know and i got really excited about
[2:59:11.360 --> 2:59:17.920]  that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[2:59:17.920 --> 2:59:23.280]  enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of
[2:59:23.280 --> 2:59:27.680]  the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your
[2:59:27.680 --> 2:59:32.640]  supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it
[2:59:32.640 --> 2:59:37.120]  literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is
[2:59:37.120 --> 2:59:41.840]  we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do
[2:59:41.840 --> 2:59:46.960]  that is to take our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much for
[2:59:46.960 --> 3:00:02.880]  calling godspeed you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:02.880 --> 3:00:21.120]  live from london england it's haul joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:00:22.160 --> 3:00:28.320]  and we're live welcome to the summit news hour we've got a raft of headlines coming up over the
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:32.880]  course of the next 60 minutes including what's going to happen with the fallout from the taliban
[3:00:32.880 --> 3:00:39.680]  takeover of afghanistan and particularly as it relates to europe of course we've got people
[3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:45.840]  talking about up to three million afghan refugees heading to europe we already have boatloads of
[3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:51.440]  migrants arriving on the south coast of england in dingies in many cases just running off into the
[3:00:51.440 --> 3:00:57.840]  nearest town amongst them a great percentage of them are already afghan migrants and have been
[3:00:57.840 --> 3:01:06.000]  for the past six months plus already arriving in the uk macron uh the german chancellor angela
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:12.080]  mercola scrambling presuming or pretending that europe's borders have been fortified since the
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:17.600]  last crisis and that will be enough to keep them at bay but if you talk to other experts if you
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:23.840]  listen to other experts doesn't seem to be the case but i'm going to save that for a little bit
[3:01:23.840 --> 3:01:28.800]  later in the show we got a couple of videos we've also got a video coming up later with the world
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:35.040]  economic forum's latest proposal on how they're going to identify the plebs the serfs because of
[3:01:35.040 --> 3:01:40.400]  course now because they've introduced these indefinite face masks rules which they expect everyone
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:44.720]  to abide by for the next god knows how many years because they're always going to have new viruses
[3:01:44.720 --> 3:01:52.560]  new flu seasons new infections they can't identify people via biometric face scanning technology
[3:01:52.560 --> 3:01:58.880]  just as the u.s. army did at the start of the occupation of afghanistan because they're literally
[3:01:58.880 --> 3:02:04.880]  treating us now like enslaved prisoners in an occupied country so the world economic forum's
[3:02:04.880 --> 3:02:10.960]  got a novel new way to identify people and it's not creepy at all it's not concerning at all
[3:02:10.960 --> 3:02:18.160]  but we're going to get into that later in the show australia as you know is no longer a democratic
[3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:25.200]  country they're pursuing this disastrous harebrained absurd zero covid policy which is never going to
[3:02:25.200 --> 3:02:30.000]  end because this virus is going to still be circulating amongst the population with its
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:37.520]  various variants and scariots for the next god knows how many years too and so we see videos
[3:02:37.520 --> 3:02:43.600]  like this on a daily basis another one out today headline which just went up on summit news about
[3:02:43.600 --> 3:02:51.920]  45 minutes ago australian police pepper spray children for not wearing face masks yes they're
[3:02:51.920 --> 3:02:58.480]  now actually targeting children who go to shopping malls and are caught maybe snitched on by
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:04.160]  suspecting members of the public for not wearing their face diapers yet another chilling video
[3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:10.880]  out of locked down australia shows police pepper spraying preteen children to the egregious crime
[3:03:10.880 --> 3:03:17.200]  of not wearing face masks even though as we know from dr. Fauci's own emails from back in february 2020
[3:03:17.920 --> 3:03:23.360]  the face masks are completely pointless the sage advisers to the uk government came out and
[3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:30.720]  admitted last month that the holes in the masks are 1000 times larger than the covid 19 virus
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:38.000]  particle so they're completely pointless and it was all an exercise in experimenting on systems
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:45.120]  of mass conformity and now that compliance regime is being meted out on 12 year old kids as you see
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:52.160]  here in the video and it shows a group of children who were apparently as I said spotted in a shopping
[3:03:52.160 --> 3:03:58.720]  mall daring to not wear a face mask there's a physical escalation it ends up with one of the
[3:03:58.720 --> 3:04:04.080]  kids being tackled to the ground by these brave police officers half of whom aren't even wearing
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:11.520]  masks themselves and then the police officers choose to pepper spray one of the children because
[3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:18.880]  of course it's for their safety it's for their protection that they are manhandled dragged to
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:25.920]  the ground and pepper sprayed in the face that's to protect them that's to ensure their health
[3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:31.840]  and their security as we highlighted earlier this month another clip showed an elderly man
[3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:37.200]  suffering a suspected heart attack after he was arrested by police for not wearing a mask
[3:04:37.200 --> 3:04:44.240]  outside while exercising he was literally walking in a local botanical gardens they spotted him
[3:04:44.240 --> 3:04:50.400]  without a face mask again tackled him to the ground he suffered a cardiac arrest could have
[3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:55.040]  killed him this is what's unfolding in Australia as the authorities threatened now to go door to
[3:04:55.040 --> 3:05:01.360]  door and perform covid tests we'll be back with more summit.news don't go away you say you want to

[3:06:26.400 --> 3:06:31.280]  tried to go out in the streets and protest this over the course of several weekends in australia
[3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:38.080]  then the government came out and threatened to hit them with fines of up to 11 500 dollars
[3:06:38.080 --> 3:06:42.800]  merely for protesting against these measures because australia is no longer a free country
[3:06:43.520 --> 3:06:48.960]  so now we have a similar situation to what we saw right at the start of the first lockdowns across
[3:06:48.960 --> 3:06:55.360]  the developed nations of the world where police and also military and sydney and other areas of
[3:06:55.360 --> 3:07:00.880]  australia are literally out hunting in packs looking for people not wearing face masks so of
[3:07:00.880 --> 3:07:07.200]  course they deployed surveillance drones to detect people not wearing face masks they said people
[3:07:07.200 --> 3:07:13.200]  couldn't travel more than three kilometers outside their own homes they fed people's license plates
[3:07:13.200 --> 3:07:21.120]  into databases to track if they'd left the allotted allowed area and it only gets worse on a day-to-day
[3:07:21.120 --> 3:07:27.200]  basis we have another headline after they pepper sprayed 12 year old girls because apparently
[3:07:27.200 --> 3:07:33.280]  that's necessary to protect their health and safety now in australia brave police officers
[3:07:33.280 --> 3:07:39.200]  dragging 12 year old kids to the ground for their safety another headline here australian police
[3:07:39.200 --> 3:07:47.440]  chastised man who went outside to get some fresh air how dare he footage from a news conference
[3:07:47.440 --> 3:07:52.320]  and they're very proud about this like the new south wales top public health official a couple
[3:07:52.320 --> 3:07:57.040]  of weeks ago who staged a news conference and ordered people not to talk to their friends and
[3:07:57.040 --> 3:08:01.520]  neighbors even if they were wearing a face mask they're very proud about this and they announced
[3:08:01.520 --> 3:08:07.120]  it in press conference conferences on a routine basis the officer in this case said that the
[3:08:07.120 --> 3:08:13.680]  incident had been detected as a result of the military because it's medical martial law right
[3:08:13.680 --> 3:08:18.080]  now in australia and new south wales police undertaking home checks on people who were
[3:08:18.080 --> 3:08:23.840]  supposed to be self isolating under the country's draconian lockdown regime and not just people who
[3:08:23.840 --> 3:08:29.600]  were supposed to be self isolating by the way because in this video he brags about how police
[3:08:29.600 --> 3:08:38.000]  and military had checked on no fewer than 2,300 houses in that one region on i don't know whether
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  it is a weekly or a daily basis more than the cases that they're even having for coronavirus in
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:48.560]  these regions so they're checking on houses where people aren't even registered in their
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:54.480]  little government pinged at database as being infected with covid because they've already
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:09:01.040]  come out and said as we had the article last week that they quote won't hesitate to go door to door
[3:09:01.040 --> 3:09:07.120]  to carry out covid tests whether people comply with them or not and of course the next step
[3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:14.800]  beyond that is mandatory vaccines door to door so the cop in the video said the officers visited
[3:09:14.800 --> 3:09:19.920]  a home in southwest sydney and quote found a person that should be there but wasn't there
[3:09:19.920 --> 3:09:25.680]  there they made a number of inquiries and not that long after he was stitched on by his neighbors
[3:09:25.680 --> 3:09:31.120]  most likely the person returned to the front of the house in a motor vehicle we've had cases
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:39.200]  out of the uk where 11 year old girls get pinged in this pandemic covid app situation in our country
[3:09:39.760 --> 3:09:44.800]  where police literally turned up in riot vans and started shouting at this little girl through a
[3:09:44.800 --> 3:09:50.880]  letterbox to check that she was self-isolating well they turned up at this guy's house in
[3:09:50.880 --> 3:09:57.840]  australia found that he wasn't there then tracked him down with their surveillance technology gave
[3:09:57.840 --> 3:10:02.320]  them an a penalty infringement notice which stated that he had hopped in his car and went out for
[3:10:02.320 --> 3:10:09.840]  some fresh air and hadn't been anywhere else yes he probably went to his local park maybe his local
[3:10:09.840 --> 3:10:16.320]  hiking trail to breathe fresh air and not only is he facing a fine and if he does it again
[3:10:16.320 --> 3:10:23.040]  potential prison time the police the authorities there felt the need to publicly shame him during
[3:10:23.040 --> 3:10:30.320]  a live press conferences conference for seeking out fresh air the cop said if you're going to
[3:10:30.320 --> 3:10:34.480]  behave like this if you're going to step outside the health orders you will be checked on and you
[3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:39.200]  will get an infringement notice and that person will continue to be checked on to make sure they
[3:10:39.200 --> 3:10:46.000]  comply so this guy's basically imprisoned in his home now for the next what 10 days two weeks minimum
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:52.640]  with daily police visits after they publicly shamed him on the mainstream media via a live
[3:10:52.640 --> 3:10:59.280]  press conference as we highlighted last week with police already paying aggressively enforced home
[3:10:59.280 --> 3:11:04.320]  visits to anyone suspected of being infected the premier of victoria also said authorities
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:11.120]  wouldn't hesitate to perform door-to-door covid test on citizens and again i had the video last
[3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:18.160]  week where there was a guy whose wife snitched on him because he questioned covid he actually
[3:11:18.160 --> 3:11:23.760]  questioned the lockdowns whether they were reasonable he ended up getting carted to a mental
[3:11:23.760 --> 3:11:30.640]  asylum by the government and in fact i've received another email from an australian who said the same
[3:11:30.640 --> 3:11:36.960]  thing happened to him and we're developing a story on that too but it could have been so much
[3:11:36.960 --> 3:11:42.240]  different for australia it could have been so much different for all of these countries because the
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:48.960]  few countries in the west or in europe at least that refused to impose these draconian lockdowns
[3:11:48.960 --> 3:11:55.120]  their death rate their infection rate is exactly the same to all the other developed nations that
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:12:02.800]  impose these draconian lockdowns a prime example being belarus headline no lockdown belarus reports
[3:12:02.800 --> 3:12:10.000]  covid mortality rates similar to neighboring countries that impose draconian lockdowns we have
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:15.440]  the graphs here in the video proving this the country of belarus which imposed no legal lockdown
[3:12:15.440 --> 3:12:20.320]  at all just like sweden throughout the entire pandemic has released covid mortality figures
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:26.640]  which are broadly in line with other nearby countries which did impose draconian lockdowns
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:31.280]  after authorities in belarus refused to put their citizens under lockdown the global media
[3:12:31.280 --> 3:12:38.240]  had a collective hissy fit they said this would be the pandemic central of europe like they did
[3:12:38.240 --> 3:12:44.960]  with sweden with one headline declaring quote one leader looks hell bent on turning covid-19
[3:12:44.960 --> 3:12:52.080]  into a catastrophe for his country well what actually happened months and months later while
[3:12:52.080 --> 3:12:58.560]  we're managing to avoid all the negative impacts of lockdown of course mass unemployment economic
[3:12:58.560 --> 3:13:06.880]  stagnation people missing vital hospital treatments depression suicide they avoided all that and their
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:14.240]  response to it and the consequences of that was far from a catastrophe newly released overall
[3:13:14.240 --> 3:13:21.120]  death statistics from the start of the pandemic up to march 2021 in belarus which didn't lock down
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:26.480]  show that the death rate is similar to neighboring countries such as latvia russia and ukraine which
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:32.320]  imposed all lockdowns indeed when compared to poland which imposed a particularly harsh lockdown
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:39.040]  belarus's mortality rate in march 2021 was significantly lower and these are the latest
[3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:45.760]  statistics statistics that we have they did the exact same thing as sweden sweden has a lower death
[3:13:45.760 --> 3:13:51.440]  rate than the uk and they don't have all the attendant problems of people dying from not
[3:13:51.440 --> 3:13:58.240]  receiving hospital treatment people dying from being mired in poverty of course we know 150
[3:13:58.240 --> 3:14:03.600]  million people were pushed into extreme poverty across the world as a result of lockdowns
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:09.520]  and belarus is similar to sweden which suffered fewer than 15 000 covid deaths despite refusing
[3:14:09.520 --> 3:14:14.320]  to impose a lockdown figures show that cases of death tend to fall in waves where there are
[3:14:14.320 --> 3:14:21.760]  lockdowns imposed are not proving that lockdowns are completely pointless will jones wrote about
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:26.560]  this for lockdowns skeptics dot org he said alongside places like south to coater florida
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:31.680]  sweden and tanzania belarus is an important illustration of what can be expected from
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:36.880]  covid 19 when restrictions aren't imposed like those places we see that the outcome is basically
[3:14:36.880 --> 3:14:42.640]  the same as similar places where restrictions are imposed don't expect any of this to be
[3:14:42.640 --> 3:14:47.280]  highlighted by the mainstream media the same mainstream media which chastised this belarus
[3:14:47.280 --> 3:14:52.640]  leader said that it would be a catastrophe for not walking down didn't happen which has
[3:14:52.640 --> 3:14:57.600]  parroted the provable falsehood that repeated lockdowns were to thank for ending each wave
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:15:03.280]  of covid if you actually look at the figures across numerous european countries
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:09.040]  the cases were already going down before the lockdowns were imposed and they impose the
[3:15:09.040 --> 3:15:14.800]  lockdowns and they say oh look the lockdowns worked they work so well we need to continue
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:23.520]  having them every six months until eternity absolutely incredible meanwhile lockdown forever
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:28.720]  meanwhile lockdown forever scotland's leftist government wants to make emergency coronavirus
[3:15:28.720 --> 3:15:36.400]  laws permanent so these laws run up until march of next year 2022 because they're expecting to
[3:15:36.400 --> 3:15:42.320]  have another wave during the winter but even months and months before that the scottish
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:48.160]  government is saying that they want to make these laws permanent so they don't have to keep renewing
[3:15:48.160 --> 3:15:54.160]  them of course as we know government works by imposing laws with sunset clauses and they remove
[3:15:54.160 --> 3:16:00.320]  the sunset clauses and this continues forever we'll be back what if you could cut your heating

[3:19:53.440 --> 3:20:04.880]  absolutely you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:12.320 --> 3:20:17.840]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:20:17.840 --> 3:20:28.000]  well we're gonna see a lot of atrocities in afghanistan with the taliban retaking control
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:33.600]  of the country the biden administration's disastrous pull out and those atrocities
[3:20:33.600 --> 3:20:39.280]  are going to be hyped we have at least 10 000 americans still trapped in afghanistan meanwhile
[3:20:39.280 --> 3:20:46.000]  the biden administration seems more concerned about rescuing the quote refugees but as ever
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:50.720]  everything is not as it seems we're going to go to this video and i'm going to talk about a potential
[3:20:50.720 --> 3:20:58.080]  new refugee crisis impacting the west as a result of what happened in afghanistan but first here's
[3:20:58.080 --> 3:21:02.560]  the video europe prepares for more cultural enrichment let's roll it
[3:21:07.920 --> 3:21:13.440]  the taliban takeover of afghanistan means that europe is now facing the risk of another refugee
[3:21:13.440 --> 3:21:20.320]  influx how it started how it ended this has brought the hashtag refugees welcome crowd out in full
[3:21:20.320 --> 3:21:27.520]  force once again because it went so well the first time seems to be overwhelmingly young men don't
[3:21:27.520 --> 3:21:32.480]  see many women or children but i suppose they're all doctors or lawyers in waiting so why should
[3:21:32.480 --> 3:21:39.680]  we concern ourselves humanitarian development worker sible schne hager told german wdr television
[3:21:39.680 --> 3:21:46.720]  on sunday quote we can assume that up to three million afghans will make their way to europe
[3:21:46.720 --> 3:21:52.080]  in the foreseeable future well what's another three million get ready to see european cities
[3:21:52.080 --> 3:21:58.640]  put up more refugees welcome posters as stones throw away from diversity barriers get ready to
[3:21:58.640 --> 3:22:04.560]  be culturally enriched but once again the facts contradict the narrative afghanistan will probably
[3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:11.440]  be more stable under the taliban than it has during any time in the past 20 years most of the afghan
[3:22:11.440 --> 3:22:18.880]  population welcomes the taliban takeover and it's over the war's over this situation isn't
[3:22:18.880 --> 3:22:24.880]  comparable to syria and yeah there are a relatively small number of people who worked for the u.s in
[3:22:24.880 --> 3:22:32.000]  afghanistan whose lives are under threat they're genuine refugees but three million people they're
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:39.920]  not refugees they're economic migrants as taliban spokesman sahail shaheen told sky news most of the
[3:22:39.920 --> 3:22:45.440]  people who are leaving afghanistan are not doing so because they feel unsafe they're doing it because
[3:22:45.440 --> 3:22:52.960]  afghanistan is a poor country everyone wants to live afghanistan because afghanistan is a poor
[3:22:52.960 --> 3:22:58.640]  country up to 70 percent of the people are living under a poverty line the vast majority of people
[3:22:58.640 --> 3:23:04.320]  fleeing afghanistan are not refugees they're economic migrants that's why they want to go to
[3:23:04.320 --> 3:23:11.760]  germany and the uk and not saudi arabia despite saudi arabia being the first safe haven again going
[3:23:11.760 --> 3:23:18.240]  back to the works of the humanitarian worker sebel schno harger quote i always ask people why don't
[3:23:18.240 --> 3:23:25.680]  you go to saudi arabia they are muslims this is your culture the answer is always no germany is
[3:23:25.680 --> 3:23:32.320]  better gee i wonder why saudi arabia puts them up in remote rudimentary refugee tent cities with
[3:23:32.320 --> 3:23:38.800]  one communal toilet the uk and germany put them up in four star hotels and give them free money
[3:23:38.800 --> 3:23:43.120]  that's why they want to come here and personally i don't blame them for wanting to come here but
[3:23:43.120 --> 3:23:49.360]  that's not the issue the issue is we tried this already back in 2015 and it was an unmitigated
[3:23:49.360 --> 3:23:54.800]  disaster with a likely runoff election against anti mass migration populist marina le penne
[3:23:54.800 --> 3:24:01.040]  coming up next year even globalist stooge immanuel macron is worried the french president is calling
[3:24:01.040 --> 3:24:06.640]  for a robust plan to quote protect against significant irregular migratory flows from
[3:24:06.640 --> 3:24:13.360]  afghanistan the vast majority of migrants on violent criminals or terrorists but too many of
[3:24:13.360 --> 3:24:21.040]  them are for europe to put its people at risk again pols show 39 of afghan support suicide
[3:24:21.040 --> 3:24:27.200]  bombings in defense of islam isis bragged about how it exploited the refugee wave to insert terror
[3:24:27.200 --> 3:24:32.560]  cells into europe there were then a multitude of terror attacks in europe carried out by isis
[3:24:32.560 --> 3:24:37.760]  adherents who were either refugees or asylum seekers the majority of the paris massacre
[3:24:37.760 --> 3:24:45.360]  terrorists entered europe via the refugee wave i think of 11-year-old ebra accoland torn limb
[3:24:45.360 --> 3:24:51.760]  from limb by the stock home truck terrorist a failed asylum seeker i think of french school
[3:24:51.760 --> 3:24:58.800]  teacher samuel patty beheaded by an islamist who was given refugee status i think of the woman
[3:24:58.800 --> 3:25:05.680]  beheaded near a church in niece by a tunisian who arrived in italy as a boat migrant i think of the
[3:25:05.680 --> 3:25:13.920]  1200 women who were viciously sexually assaulted in one night in cologne on new year's eve 2015
[3:25:13.920 --> 3:25:20.160]  the culprits were almost entirely north african or middle eastern men the majority were either
[3:25:20.160 --> 3:25:26.480]  asylum seekers illegal immigrants or refugees i think of the afghan asylum seeker who raped
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:31.600]  and murdered a teenage girl in germany before dumping her body in a river i think of the
[3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:36.960]  mentally disabled 11-year-old girl who was raped by an afghan refugee and this isn't even to mention
[3:25:36.960 --> 3:25:43.040]  the societal dislocation caused by the mass influx of foreign populations who have no desire to
[3:25:43.040 --> 3:25:48.480]  integrate or contribute the uk government has announced that afghan refugees will be allowed
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:55.520]  to enter the country without even needing to show a passport what could possibly go wrong the previous
[3:25:55.520 --> 3:26:02.240]  time the uk began rescuing asylum seekers from war-torn countries a royal navy picked up a refugee
[3:26:02.240 --> 3:26:09.520]  in libya called salman abadi he repaid them by blowing up a bunch of kids at the manchester arena
[3:26:09.520 --> 3:26:16.240]  yeah you'd have thought we'd learned our lesson by now polls show that 99 of afghan support sharia
[3:26:16.240 --> 3:26:21.200]  law good well send them to other middle eastern countries where they'll fit in europe is full
[3:26:21.200 --> 3:26:26.960]  the uk is full we already have record numbers of boat migrants arriving anyway some of whom just
[3:26:26.960 --> 3:26:32.320]  rock up on beaches in dingies and run into the nearest town we don't even know who these people
[3:26:32.320 --> 3:26:37.760]  are and now we're just gonna let in thousands more without even checking their identity meanwhile
[3:26:37.760 --> 3:26:44.320]  i'm gonna have to show my id and vaccine passport to go to a football match in my own country no
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:50.000]  enough is enough if these people are genuine refugees send them to other middle eastern
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:55.440]  countries because europe has already tried experimenting with mass economic migration
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:27:00.480]  from these areas of the world and the consequences were horrendous
[3:27:00.480 --> 3:27:09.920]  so there you have it we have numerous previous examples basically every major terror attack
[3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:15.280]  and many of the smaller ones in europe throughout the past five years were committed were carried
[3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:21.200]  out by asylum seekers refugees illegal immigrants and again it's not to say that everyone who wants
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:26.720]  to come over if i was them i want to get out of those s-hole countries as well doesn't mean to
[3:27:26.720 --> 3:27:32.880]  say every one of them is a terrorist or a violent criminal the fact is we already tried that experiment
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:39.520]  in 2015 it was an unmitigated disaster why are we doing it again as i said you're going to see
[3:27:39.520 --> 3:27:45.520]  these taliban atrocities some of them real some of them hyped up by the media over the course of
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:51.760]  the next few weeks to grease the skids for a new invasion of the west invasion of the europe
[3:27:51.760 --> 3:27:57.520]  with these refugees who aren't refugees they're economic migrants we saw this in syria
[3:27:57.520 --> 3:28:02.480]  for years and years and years where they would stage the fake chemical attacks and blame them on
[3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:09.520]  our sad to get more syrian migrant refugees crossing into europe they didn't care about the
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:14.800]  fact that a quarter of these migrants coming over literally supported isis according to the polls
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:20.000]  carried out by pew in the region the polls as i mentioned huge numbers of afghan support
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:24.880]  suicide bombings in defense of islam just because those people don't support the taliban or don't
[3:28:24.880 --> 3:28:30.320]  support isis doesn't mean they're not potential g-hardists and we've learned that lesson to our
[3:28:30.320 --> 3:28:38.480]  cost multiple times in europe to great tragedy over the past six years i have to show my id to go to
[3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:43.760]  a football match from september to go to a nightclub the id is linked with the vaccine passport but
[3:28:43.760 --> 3:28:49.600]  if i'm an afghan migrant i can just show up on a boat not even present any documents whatsoever
[3:28:49.600 --> 3:28:55.440]  and waltz right into the country and be put up by the government in a four-star hotel it's ridiculous
[3:28:55.440 --> 3:29:01.520]  and it has to stop the fact of going you know listeners calling to the show and they thank me
[3:29:01.520 --> 3:29:08.720]  and it makes me feel pathetic because i sit there and i beg you for support constantly for prayer
[3:29:08.720 --> 3:29:14.320]  for financial support and for word of mouth and then we're all this together and i you know it gets
[3:29:14.320 --> 3:29:18.240]  old having to come to you and say hey i got great products please bomb or we won't be here on air
[3:29:18.240 --> 3:29:22.480]  but it's true for the only media organization in the united states that promotes liberty at this level
[3:29:23.120 --> 3:29:27.520]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody
[3:29:27.520 --> 3:29:32.080]  else they've crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order
[3:29:32.080 --> 3:29:36.720]  comes out the open our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken off air that's why
[3:29:36.720 --> 3:29:41.360]  america has got to be taken down you can't have all these other nations enslaved and america
[3:29:41.360 --> 3:29:46.720]  still quasi free you can't have info wars has been proven right be on air with all the craziness
[3:29:46.720 --> 3:29:51.680]  that's about to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now just get ready so thank you all and get
[3:29:51.680 --> 3:29:56.160]  an info wars store dot com get some great 2020 election shirts supplements and so much more
[3:29:56.160 --> 3:29:58.320]  they're wonderful products and they support the info we're thank you
[3:30:01.680 --> 3:30:06.400]  the globalists are having their revolution but free humanity has to have its revolution
[3:30:07.200 --> 3:30:12.240]  we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to
[3:30:12.240 --> 3:30:19.520]  to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate
[3:30:20.480 --> 3:30:28.240]  controlled slaves worse than slaves and just just property from cradle to grave of the system
[3:30:29.280 --> 3:30:36.240]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control
[3:30:36.240 --> 3:30:42.240]  we have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and
[3:30:42.240 --> 3:30:48.080]  we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia it's that choice
[3:30:48.080 --> 3:30:53.520]  it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice we've got freedom
[3:30:53.520 --> 3:30:58.560]  or slavery go to evil it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it
[3:30:59.920 --> 3:31:05.120]  let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a science fiction movie
[3:31:05.120 --> 3:31:10.480]  set in the year 2020 where a world government's being established where members of congress and
[3:31:10.480 --> 3:31:16.000]  former presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection
[3:31:16.000 --> 3:31:23.040]  that grows blood clots and prions all over your body that you're not allowed to fly on an airplane
[3:31:23.600 --> 3:31:29.360]  think about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years ago
[3:31:29.360 --> 3:31:36.080]  if somebody told you this would be happening but it is happening now and then they tell you oh sorry
[3:31:36.080 --> 3:31:41.200]  it's not a vaccine is a gene therapy and it doesn't really work she got to take it every few months
[3:31:41.200 --> 3:31:46.000]  and the people that have submitted say great i want to take it all the time so i can go outside
[3:31:46.000 --> 3:31:50.320]  and not get sick from covid even though it gets you sick from covid and now there's record numbers
[3:31:50.320 --> 3:31:56.000]  of really sick people from the sloughing the shedding of the virus and that's in mainline studies
[3:31:56.000 --> 3:32:00.800]  bill gates and falcy did this need to go to prison for it right now i have gotten so many
[3:32:00.800 --> 3:32:06.000]  requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six plus months of where is the activated

[3:33:03.200 --> 3:33:05.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:13.520 --> 3:33:18.000]  you're listening to summit.news with paul joseph watson
[3:33:18.000 --> 3:33:26.320]  so the biden administration has made it clear that they're going to leave
[3:33:26.320 --> 3:33:31.760]  up to 10 000 americans who are trapped in afghanistan potentially their lives at threat
[3:33:32.720 --> 3:33:38.480]  high and dry meanwhile they've authorized 500 million dollars for afghan refugees there was
[3:33:38.480 --> 3:33:44.240]  an advisory put out by the u.s government just about an hour ago which says the united states
[3:33:44.240 --> 3:33:50.880]  government cannot ensure safe passage to the airport in cabal for evacuation even for u.s
[3:33:50.880 --> 3:33:57.200]  citizens but there's plenty of money plenty of transport plenty of media narrative available
[3:33:57.200 --> 3:34:03.200]  plenty of sympathy for quote afghan refugees coming to the west apparently now they're more
[3:34:03.200 --> 3:34:08.560]  important than actual american citizens british citizens who are trapped in afghanistan jack
[3:34:08.560 --> 3:34:14.160]  persoviet just tweeted not one refugee should be settled while they're at americans trapped behind
[3:34:14.160 --> 3:34:20.800]  enemy lines and yet that's exactly what's happening and now we see in europe the greek the skids being
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:30.640]  greased for the influx for the invasion of up to three million afghan refugees this after we
[3:34:30.640 --> 3:34:37.440]  had a crisis from 2015 to 16 where over a million refugees some of them from syria the majority
[3:34:37.440 --> 3:34:43.920]  weren't even from syria crossing into europe what happened in the years that followed massive rise
[3:34:43.920 --> 3:34:49.760]  in violent crime massive rise in sexual assaults in major cities across europe massive spiking
[3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:55.440]  isis inspired terror attacks many of which were carried out by terrorists who exploited the refugee
[3:34:55.440 --> 3:35:03.120]  wave to slip into europe unnoticed including the paris massacre terrorists who killed over 100
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:08.720]  people including the manchester arena bomber who was literally rescued as a refugee by the royal
[3:35:08.720 --> 3:35:15.520]  navy two years before he carried out that disgusting atrocity killing over 20 people
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:24.240]  injuring a thousand people at the manchester arena bombing now we have this headline again on this
[3:35:24.240 --> 3:35:28.560]  refugee problem which they're hyping up and again they're going to have atrocities carried out by the
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:33.200]  taliban they're already atrocities being carried out the media is going to take the worst of those
[3:35:33.200 --> 3:35:40.720]  hype them up to grease the skids for more refugees to be sent to the west diplomat not even tanks
[3:35:40.720 --> 3:35:46.400]  those the head's words not even tanks can stop large wave of afghan refugees heading to europe
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:52.080]  despite europe heavily fortifying its borders since the 2015 crisis the top diplomat wants
[3:35:52.080 --> 3:35:57.120]  that not even tanks can stop a potentially large wave of afghan refugees heading to the continent
[3:35:57.120 --> 3:36:05.120]  30 000 people a week were already fleeing that country even before the taliban took full control
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:12.560]  i mentioned the comments of the humanitarian worker the pro-refugee humanitarian worker
[3:36:12.560 --> 3:36:18.160]  on german television just a couple of days ago who said not only are there three million afghan
[3:36:18.160 --> 3:36:24.160]  refugees set to flee the country but when you ask them where they want to go they don't want to go
[3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:29.440]  to saudi arabia they don't want to go to turkey even though those countries are more in line with
[3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:35.600]  their religion and their culture 99 of afghan support sharia law but they don't want to go to
[3:36:35.600 --> 3:36:41.600]  countries which have pockets of sharia law or a full sharia law they want to come to the west
[3:36:41.600 --> 3:36:47.360]  and impose it here she said quote i always ask people why don't you go to saudi arabia they're
[3:36:47.360 --> 3:36:54.000]  muslims this is your culture the answer is always no germany is better and as i mentioned in the
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:59.040]  video the reason they don't want to go to saudi arabia is because they put them up in these 10
[3:36:59.040 --> 3:37:05.440]  cities in remote areas life is hard life is a struggle as you would expect for a refugee
[3:37:06.240 --> 3:37:12.240]  they have like one communal toilet between 100 of them they get to europe they get benefits they
[3:37:12.240 --> 3:37:18.800]  get welfare havens they get free money they get put up in literal four star hotels at taxpayer
[3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:24.560]  expense by our government so again i don't even blame them that's exactly what i'd do in their
[3:37:24.560 --> 3:37:29.440]  situation but i blame our leaders because the consequences as we've seen in europe over the
[3:37:29.440 --> 3:37:36.640]  past six years are completely catastrophic and we can't repeat that again two people who don't
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:42.080]  want to repeat it again at least in the short term despite one of them being the primary person to
[3:37:42.080 --> 3:37:47.520]  blame for it happening in the first place angela merkel they're very concerned about it merkel
[3:37:47.520 --> 3:37:54.320]  and french president macron because merkel's party is up for reelection uh next year i believe
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:37:58.640]  and of course we have the french presidential election next year as well where macron again
[3:37:58.640 --> 3:38:04.480]  is likely to run off against marine le pen the anti mass migration populace so at least for the
[3:38:04.480 --> 3:38:11.760]  moment they've got to pose as if they don't want another influx of potentially three million refugees
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:17.040]  into europe because they want to win those elections if this was post those elections they
[3:38:17.040 --> 3:38:23.760]  probably wouldn't care about it because they're both globalist stuges but armin lasher the head of
[3:38:23.760 --> 3:38:29.200]  the christian democratic union in germany and the man most likely to replace chancellor angela merkel
[3:38:29.200 --> 3:38:36.480]  said 2015 should not be repeated even though his party and his leader were directly to blame for
[3:38:36.480 --> 3:38:40.480]  2015 they don't want to happen it they want it don't want it to happen again on their watch at
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:46.640]  least before the election because it's going to impact their reelection chances and macron himself
[3:38:46.640 --> 3:38:51.920]  has called for a quote robust coordinated and united response in order to protect the continent from
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:38:58.720]  major irregularly migratory flows from afghanistan however two countries that bore the brunt of the
[3:38:58.720 --> 3:39:03.040]  previous refugee crisis greece and turkey have indicated they will put up stern resistance
[3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:08.480]  to absorbing large numbers of migrants fleeing afghanistan of course greece was completely
[3:39:08.480 --> 3:39:15.040]  overrun back in 2015 so was hungary now greece as minister for migration told reuters that his
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:21.200]  country quote will not and cannot become a gateway for migrants and refugees trying to reach the eu
[3:39:22.080 --> 3:39:29.600]  now they did a pubsons choice deal back in i think it was 2016-17 with turkey where the eu gave
[3:39:29.600 --> 3:39:35.200]  turkey six billion euros to house all these refugees the problem with that is now turkeys
[3:39:35.200 --> 3:39:40.640]  basically full they're home to four million refugees which is the largest concentrated
[3:39:40.640 --> 3:39:46.160]  population of refugees in the entire world and now their government is under pressure from their
[3:39:46.160 --> 3:39:52.800]  people because turks are being impacted through job losses through the economic impact of these
[3:39:52.800 --> 3:39:58.720]  migrants through the social dislocation that these migrants bring even though they're mainly syrians
[3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:05.680]  so they should fit in better than even the ones coming from afghanistan but turkish public opinion
[3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:09.760]  is dead against this they don't want any more refugees so they're putting their government
[3:40:09.760 --> 3:40:16.320]  under pressure to not accept more and so what do we do well as i mentioned in the video the UK
[3:40:16.320 --> 3:40:22.240]  government is now literally not only saying that they're going to take in 20 000 minimum to begin
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:28.640]  with refugees who help to the UK government or help to the international forces they've outright
[3:40:28.640 --> 3:40:34.880]  come and said you don't need any identity documents any passport to get into the country what is that
[3:40:34.880 --> 3:40:40.640]  going to do it's going to incentivize the ones who are coming in boats already from France a huge
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:46.800]  proportion of which are afghans and have been for years and years and years so again they're
[3:40:46.800 --> 3:40:53.040]  openly incentivizing it look at what salvini did in italy back in 2018 when he came to power before
[3:40:53.040 --> 3:40:58.720]  he lost power he basically said we're not accepting you we're not sending out boats to collect you as
[3:40:58.720 --> 3:41:04.720]  a taxi service if you come you put your own lives at risk and just we're not having it anymore
[3:41:04.720 --> 3:41:12.160]  that saved it cut the number of migrant deaths traveling to italy in boats in half it was actually
[3:41:12.160 --> 3:41:17.680]  the humanitarian policy but of course as soon as salvini lost power and the socialist government
[3:41:17.680 --> 3:41:23.440]  got back in in italy that was completely reversed more migrants are dying but they don't really care
[3:41:23.440 --> 3:41:30.400]  about that more are coming into europe post salvini because he actually managed to put a lid on it
[3:41:30.400 --> 3:41:36.560]  so we've got macron and merkel saying that they don't want these migrants they're going to put
[3:41:36.560 --> 3:41:40.960]  up a strong defense against this happening again just because they want to win the election it's
[3:41:40.960 --> 3:41:46.560]  a very cynical ploy but then in the uk where our own government isn't going to be up for
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:52.080]  reelection for two or three years now and it's supposedly a conservative government that believes
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:56.240]  in strong borders despite the fact we have record numbers of migrants being rescued and
[3:41:56.240 --> 3:42:02.800]  given taxi services and four-star hotels by that same government the home secretary pretty patelle
[3:42:02.800 --> 3:42:08.320]  has not only called on other european countries to follow suit but she says the uk should provide
[3:42:08.320 --> 3:42:15.040]  support to the most vulnerable fleeing afghanistan so they can start a new life in safety in the uk
[3:42:15.040 --> 3:42:20.080]  away from the tyranny and oppression they face in afghanistan and as we mentioned and covered in
[3:42:20.080 --> 3:42:25.680]  the video basically the new qualification for being a refugee is not being under direct threat
[3:42:25.680 --> 3:42:32.480]  of death or persecution it's merely not liking the government not liking the new regime that has
[3:42:32.480 --> 3:42:38.080]  taken charge which is not to deny the fact that taliban atrocities are going to take place they're
[3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:43.920]  already taking place today but the media is hyping them up you have sky news desperate afghan women
[3:42:43.920 --> 3:42:49.600]  throw babies over razor wire at least one killed and several injured as taliban violently disperse
[3:42:49.600 --> 3:42:54.640]  protests they're going to amplify these stories to grease the skids for another migrant influx
[3:42:54.640 --> 3:43:01.600]  into europe despite it being a complete disaster don't go away we'll be back the answer to 1984
[3:43:02.800 --> 3:43:10.560]  is 1776
[3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:15.360]  info wars has been banned
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:29.520]  and arrested attacked and threatened because we are effective the great awakening is here

[3:43:54.560 --> 3:43:56.960]  info wars dot com
[3:43:58.800 --> 3:44:03.760]  so when i first started taking survival skills basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight
[3:44:03.760 --> 3:44:08.640]  i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard
[3:44:08.640 --> 3:44:12.800]  dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[3:44:12.800 --> 3:44:17.520]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you
[3:44:17.520 --> 3:44:21.120]  had you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it
[3:44:21.120 --> 3:44:27.600]  and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:32.960]  know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple
[3:44:32.960 --> 3:44:37.520]  of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're

[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:47.120]  want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves
[3:44:47.120 --> 3:44:51.680]  clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take
[3:44:51.680 --> 3:44:56.560]  our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much for your call and god

[3:47:02.640 --> 3:47:13.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:19.040 --> 3:47:24.160]  live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson
[3:47:24.160 --> 3:47:34.000]  well as the biden administration puts out 500 million dollars for afghan refugees to come to
[3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:39.600]  the united states many of whom will come unchecked some of whom will come with g hardest sympathies
[3:47:40.240 --> 3:47:44.720]  the department of homeland security is concentrating on the real terror threat
[3:47:44.720 --> 3:47:50.960]  which is americans who oppose covid lockdown measures we saw that advisory last week where
[3:47:50.960 --> 3:47:57.280]  the dhs came out and said that those who oppose vaccines mask mandates lockdown measures are
[3:47:57.280 --> 3:48:03.920]  a potential violent domestic extremist terror threat we had an article where baler college of
[3:48:03.920 --> 3:48:09.760]  medicine professor peter hotets published a paper suggesting it should be a hate crime to criticize
[3:48:09.760 --> 3:48:14.960]  dr anthony fouchy and other scientists who are promoting mass vaccination they're literally
[3:48:14.960 --> 3:48:22.560]  trying to create a new privileged class a special protected identity that you're not allowed to
[3:48:22.560 --> 3:48:28.400]  criticize unless you'll be placed on the list as a domestic extremist maybe you'll be put on a no
[3:48:28.400 --> 3:48:35.440]  fly list so we have this narrative of americans in question covid being placed in the domestic
[3:48:35.440 --> 3:48:44.400]  extremist category and then we have grievance grifters in america allegedly baking crimes against
[3:48:44.400 --> 3:48:50.160]  them or faking threats intimidation against them to bolster their own profile we had this
[3:48:50.160 --> 3:48:56.400]  headline a few days ago muzzle vaccine official claimed was mailed to her as a threat revealed to
[3:48:56.400 --> 3:49:03.200]  have been purchased on her credit card this was tenancy vaccine official dr michelle fiskus who
[3:49:03.200 --> 3:49:08.000]  asserted that someone had mailed her a muzzle in an attempt to intimidate her it subsequently
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:13.600]  emerged that the item was purchased with a credit card in fiskus's name so they had a big
[3:49:13.600 --> 3:49:19.200]  uh department of safety and homeland security investigation about this and it turned out that
[3:49:19.920 --> 3:49:24.960]  it was purchased on an amazon account and the credit card linked to that amazon account
[3:49:24.960 --> 3:49:31.760]  was this same doctor who claimed that she was the subject the victim of a bullying intimidation
[3:49:31.760 --> 3:49:37.680]  campaign before she came out and said and claimed that someone had created a fake amazon account
[3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:44.320]  and had somehow stolen her credit card details and added them to that account to frame her and
[3:49:44.320 --> 3:49:49.600]  make it seem as if that she purchased the muzzle and obviously as we know she'd never do that she'd
[3:49:49.600 --> 3:49:56.400]  never purchased the muzzle to smother herself in fake victimhood even though she's literally out
[3:49:56.400 --> 3:50:02.880]  on the news previously blaming quote white male rural conservatives for not taking the
[3:50:02.880 --> 3:50:09.760]  vaccine so she had a grievance against them and then mysteriously this intimidation bullying well
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:14.640]  hate crime happens against her turns out the item was purchased on her credit card but i'm sure
[3:50:15.280 --> 3:50:20.560]  we can trust her we can believe her that she was framed on the subject of masks though
[3:50:21.440 --> 3:50:28.000]  the globalist are having a big problem now they've made masks the norm the new norm people
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:31.680]  are still wearing them and will continue to wear them beyond the pandemic i'm sure they've
[3:50:31.680 --> 3:50:38.160]  got more pandemics planned that will necessitate permanent mask mandates for an elongated time
[3:50:38.160 --> 3:50:44.160]  problem is their facial recognition software is having trouble producing people's identities if
[3:50:44.160 --> 3:50:49.440]  they're wearing those face masks but the world economic forum has come up with a solution
[3:50:50.000 --> 3:50:55.760]  and it's really not creepy at all let's go to this clip and i'll come back and talk about it after
[3:50:55.760 --> 3:51:02.480]  them the world economic forum has released another video about our changing world and it's
[3:51:02.480 --> 3:51:08.000]  totally not creepy at all you see the davos globalists have a problem now that they've
[3:51:08.000 --> 3:51:13.440]  normalized the wearing of face masks under never ending covid rules their facial recognition
[3:51:13.440 --> 3:51:19.520]  software is having trouble identifying all the serfs and i mean how else is this totally
[3:51:19.520 --> 3:51:26.000]  beneficent altruistic loving group of global billionaires going to track your every movement
[3:51:27.040 --> 3:51:32.960]  for the greater good well and this totally doesn't sound like a nefarious nightmarish philip k
[3:51:32.960 --> 3:51:37.520]  dick novel at all they're going to use technology developed by nasa and the pentagon that fires
[3:51:37.520 --> 3:51:42.240]  lasers at your body to detect your unique cardiac signature which is then matched against a medical
[3:51:42.240 --> 3:51:58.160]  database to reveal your personal identity see i told you it wasn't creepy
[3:52:03.040 --> 3:52:09.200]  from the world economic forums official website security in a heartbeat digital acceleration
[3:52:09.200 --> 3:52:13.520]  has also put the limelight back onto security issues much of the world's moved to online
[3:52:13.520 --> 3:52:18.640]  weather for work or for your weekly shop involves sharing personal or business information remotely
[3:52:18.640 --> 3:52:23.280]  with an ever wider number of entities not only that but when people started wearing masks
[3:52:23.840 --> 3:52:30.000]  facial recognition security systems were stumped oh no one solution to this conundrum may be the
[3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:36.400]  unique pattern of your heartbeat developed by the pentagon and nasa cardio id devices can detect
[3:52:36.400 --> 3:52:41.840]  an individual's unique cardiac signature using an infrared laser the technology is already available
[3:52:41.840 --> 3:52:47.920]  for licensing and security is only one possible use another application could be identifying
[3:52:47.920 --> 3:52:54.400]  opted in shoppers as they enter a store for example to personalize their visit identifying
[3:52:54.400 --> 3:53:01.120]  shoppers as they enter a store i think i remember seeing that somewhere else before oh yeah minority
[3:53:01.120 --> 3:53:08.960]  report
[3:53:31.120 --> 3:53:42.900]  The movie, set in 2054, presents a fictionalised hellscape vision of the future, where people
[3:53:42.900 --> 3:53:47.460]  are pinged everywhere they go via implants that broadcast their personal identity, where
[3:53:47.460 --> 3:53:52.540]  shoppers are swamped by a deluge of ads that scan their retinas and call them by name as
[3:53:52.540 --> 3:53:53.540]  they walk by.
[3:53:53.540 --> 3:53:56.700]  Surely the World Economic Forum doesn't want that!
[3:53:56.700 --> 3:54:00.740]  I mean it's not like their founder, Klaus Schwab, literally wrote an entire book about
[3:54:00.740 --> 3:54:05.160]  authorities forcing people to undergo brain scans to pick up signs of discontent before
[3:54:05.160 --> 3:54:06.520]  they're allowed to travel.
[3:54:06.520 --> 3:54:10.200]  It's not like he wrote that law enforcement agencies will use techniques to determine
[3:54:10.200 --> 3:54:14.640]  the likelihood of criminal activity, assess guilt or even possibly retrieve memory directly
[3:54:14.640 --> 3:54:18.320]  from people's brains, which just happens to be the plot of the Minority Report.
[3:54:18.320 --> 3:54:22.280]  It's not like he said that active implantable microchips that break the skin barrier of
[3:54:22.280 --> 3:54:25.880]  our bodies will change how we interface with the world and force us to question what it
[3:54:25.880 --> 3:54:29.880]  means to be human, and it's not like he wrote that such technology will allow authorities
[3:54:29.880 --> 3:54:34.160]  to intrude into the hitherto private space of our minds, reading our thoughts and influencing
[3:54:34.160 --> 3:54:35.160]  our behaviour.
[3:54:35.160 --> 3:54:40.640]  You'd have to be a paranoid nut back to believe any of that, even though he literally wrote
[3:54:40.640 --> 3:54:41.640]  it in his own book.
[3:54:41.640 --> 3:54:46.720]  All of this just makes me even more thankful to the New York Times, which dismissed the
[3:54:46.720 --> 3:54:51.160]  World Economic Forum's great reset as a baseless conspiracy theory.
[3:54:51.160 --> 3:54:58.400]  I'm just so grateful that none of this is actually happening, even as they publicly
[3:54:58.400 --> 3:55:02.320]  announced that it is.
[3:55:02.320 --> 3:55:06.320]  Well there you have it, they're going to keep you muzzled, but they're also going to track
[3:55:06.320 --> 3:55:13.040]  you, trace you via the pandemic via the Mandator Government app, and eventually, as we explain
[3:55:13.040 --> 3:55:19.840]  in the video, via the system where they literally identify you via the trend, the pattern of
[3:55:19.840 --> 3:55:23.760]  your heartbeat, and it's not creepy at all, it's just a conspiracy theory.
[3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:29.080]  The New York Times told me it was a conspiracy theory, even though Klaus Einelschwab writes
[3:55:29.080 --> 3:55:34.880]  about it in his own book, and he's very proud about it, it's really just fake news.
[3:55:34.880 --> 3:55:39.440]  Of course, if you say it's a good thing, then it suddenly becomes real, and it's not fake,
[3:55:39.440 --> 3:55:41.600]  but we're not on that side.
[3:55:41.600 --> 3:55:49.320]  Meanwhile, some good news, believe it or not, in France, their vaccine passport system is
[3:55:49.320 --> 3:55:52.520]  proving to be a complete failure.
[3:55:52.520 --> 3:55:58.480]  Others are refusing to enforce France's vaccine passport, anecdotal evidence detailed by former
[3:55:58.480 --> 3:56:02.760]  Google software engineer Mike Hearn, strongly suggest that most restaurants, cafes and other
[3:56:02.760 --> 3:56:08.520]  businesses in France are not enforcing the country's controversial vaccine passport system.
[3:56:08.520 --> 3:56:12.400]  We highlighted the videos last week where you had police on the first day that this was
[3:56:12.400 --> 3:56:18.120]  introduced for people visiting bars, cafes, cinemas, public venues, patrolling them, making
[3:56:18.120 --> 3:56:24.520]  people show their medical papers, just to use services, just to buy a cup of coffee.
[3:56:24.520 --> 3:56:26.280]  That was an intimidation campaign.
[3:56:26.280 --> 3:56:32.160]  It seems that in the days following, it became very lax indeed, and then because of the fact
[3:56:32.160 --> 3:56:37.160]  that a lot of these cafes, restaurants were half empty, the business owners were struggling
[3:56:37.160 --> 3:56:39.280]  because people were avoiding them.
[3:56:39.280 --> 3:56:47.320]  They just stopped enforcing this system altogether, even under the threat of massive fines.
[3:56:47.320 --> 3:56:51.000]  He says, the test certificates being checked once and then swapped for a token that doesn't
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:56.760]  expire, expired tests being accepted, so basically they accept fake tests.
[3:56:56.760 --> 3:57:01.960]  People accepting paper test certificates without scanning them, accepting QR codes that failed
[3:57:01.960 --> 3:57:02.960]  to scan.
[3:57:02.960 --> 3:57:09.000]  That's the big headline today of RT, crash France's repeated health pass system failed
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:12.280]  or leaving citizens without the QR codes needed for daily life.
[3:57:12.280 --> 3:57:18.560]  This QR pandemic code that they've premised this digital medical ID around continues to
[3:57:18.560 --> 3:57:23.360]  fail people on enforcing it, and that's very good news.
[3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:25.840]  Israel, by the way, has brought it back in.
[3:57:25.840 --> 3:57:29.720]  They rolled it out as an intimidation campaign to threaten young people into getting the
[3:57:29.720 --> 3:57:30.920]  vaccine.
[3:57:30.920 --> 3:57:36.560]  Now the vaccines have proven to be a complete failure, so they're bringing the vaccine passports
[3:57:36.560 --> 3:57:37.560]  back.
[3:57:37.560 --> 3:57:41.520]  How far along the road will this get in other European countries, including my own country,
[3:57:41.520 --> 3:57:46.000]  remains to be seen, but those Afghan refugees will be let in without any ID whatsoever.
[3:57:46.000 --> 3:58:12.280]  More rooms coming up next, summit.news, don't go away.
