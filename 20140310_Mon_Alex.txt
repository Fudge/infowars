[01:31.680 --> 01:39.040]  fifth even though they tell you you can't on your tax filings but hey you know four legs

[02:01.240 --> 02:07.680]  and a different set of rules for all the rest of us slaves well slaves is the operative word
[02:07.680 --> 02:11.840]  because it is an unconstitutional tax it is in the communist manifesto to have an income
[02:11.840 --> 02:20.160]  tax the average American didn't pay an income tax till 1951 I mean this is an alien thing
[02:20.160 --> 02:24.200]  I'll never forget they want Ron Paul was on CNN once and what do we do figure about income
[02:24.200 --> 02:28.240]  tax what'll build the government what runny goes this capital was built before we had
[02:28.240 --> 02:32.960]  an income tax the income tax doesn't run the country it goes to interest on the debt of
[02:32.960 --> 02:36.760]  the Federal Reserve but hey don't let facts get in the way of it go ahead sir I'm sorry
[02:36.760 --> 02:43.400]  make a point well you know here's the thing if they're going to continue to ignore us
[02:43.400 --> 02:50.880]  and implement things that we don't want like an example of Obamacare you know you fully
[02:50.880 --> 02:55.760]  implement that when we told you we don't want it we're not going to pay taxes anymore life
[02:55.760 --> 03:00.760]  their lifeblood of this whole system is money if they don't have money they can't function
[03:00.760 --> 03:08.320]  they can't send troops into attack if they don't have money to pay them so cut them off
[03:08.320 --> 03:13.280]  very well said no I agree and withdraw consent from the system speak out against it take
[03:13.280 --> 03:17.600]  our moral authority away from them point out that literally were run by offshore banks
[03:17.600 --> 03:22.960]  and it's over the occupation will begin to fall they want us poor the globalists admit
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.520]  this they they set the economy up to make it artificially scarce because they don't

[03:45.480 --> 03:49.960]  California on what happened there and it's a fascinating interview I was listening to

[04:35.720 --> 04:40.400]  the status religion which he agrees is more dangerous than a lot of people that are controlled
[04:40.400 --> 04:45.400]  by establishment religion and again I'm a religious person I'm a spiritual person but
[04:45.400 --> 04:48.920]  I'm not an establishment religion person but I don't get mad at folks that say I can't
[04:48.920 --> 04:54.920]  see it I don't believe it. What I get mad at is atheists that tend to replace one thing
[04:54.920 --> 05:00.080]  with a statement God and he agrees that those atheists are dangerous.

[09:08.160 --> 09:14.200]  to talk about his futurist view on the world and where things are going but to also go
[09:14.200 --> 09:21.400]  over some of the contemporary news that is unfolding in the world today and then we
[09:21.400 --> 09:27.120]  also have government run healthcare where now they promise no new regulations on doctors
[09:27.120 --> 09:37.440]  it is 155 thousand in the coming changes are vast the number of codes will explode from
[09:37.440 --> 09:43.360]  a 17 thousand of the current system to 155 thousand under the new one according to the
[09:43.360 --> 09:48.960]  centers for medical and medicine services and it's designed to totally destroy all free
[09:48.960 --> 09:53.920]  independent medical centers doctors you name it all the smaller clinics and hospitals it
[09:53.920 --> 09:57.960]  was written by big hospitals and foreign insurance companies and offshore insurance
[09:57.960 --> 10:03.440]  companies to totally shut everything down but them it's a monopoly takeover to take
[10:03.440 --> 10:09.160]  you from 40 hours to less than 30 hours a week to not cover pre-existing conditions
[10:09.160 --> 10:13.320]  government being involved with corporations screwed up our healthcare if you think it
[10:13.320 --> 10:18.500]  was already bad it was the best 50 years ago here in the US hands down not debated royalty
[10:18.500 --> 10:23.960]  came here from around the world now it's going to be the worst so the weekly standard has
[10:23.960 --> 10:31.160]  those numbers we're also going to be getting into the architect of it Ezekiel Emmanuel
[10:31.160 --> 10:35.720]  we have the clip coming up he says we'll get to at the bottom of the hour you don't even
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.600]  need a doctor it's like Cuba I mean you've got plenty of doctors in healthcare you just
[10:40.600 --> 10:46.080]  get a cane if your knees are bad or a cane if you're going blind I mean just a cane
[10:46.080 --> 10:51.460]  is the answer so everybody's like I want the healthcare like England you ever watched the
[10:51.460 --> 10:56.280]  parliamentary stuff on C-SPAN where they admit 18 months to get a broken leg fix and stuff
[10:56.280 --> 11:01.440]  I mean wow you folks you're really in for a rude awakening just like we told you Obamacare
[11:01.440 --> 11:06.160]  would increase your prices we're going to get into this move to disarm people as well
[11:06.160 --> 11:12.840]  and the whole climate change push for taxation just a bunch of news with our guest and Hillary
[11:12.840 --> 11:18.440]  Clinton calls Vladimir Putin Hitler takes one to no one this is all coming up with Stefan
[11:18.440 --> 11:25.680]  Malone and again he is the founder and host of free domain radio one of the largest most
[11:25.680 --> 11:30.760]  popular philosophical shows in the world with more than 2,500 podcasts 10 books and 50 million
[11:30.760 --> 11:34.360]  downloads that's an old bio it's more than that now and he spread the cause of liberty
[11:34.360 --> 11:38.360]  philosophy listeners throughout the world and I'm not going to go over his whole background
[11:38.360 --> 11:42.960]  but prior to that he was a thriving career and software entrepreneur and executive in
[11:42.960 --> 11:46.920]  2006 he left his work in the tech industry to vote his efforts to free domain radio
[11:46.920 --> 11:52.560]  now self-identified full-time parent and philosopher thought criminal Stefan speaks regularly at
[11:52.560 --> 11:57.920]  liberty themed events across North America and South America and his author of two novels
[11:57.920 --> 12:03.320]  revolutions and the god of atheists as well as eight nonfiction books on relationships
[12:03.320 --> 12:08.080]  government and religion and free domain radio.com is his site again I'm your host Alex Jones
[12:08.080 --> 12:12.520]  if you just joined us with info wars.com you can follow us on Twitter at real Alex Jones
[12:12.520 --> 12:17.040]  before I go anywhere I want to thank you for coming to join us oh it's my pleasure thank
[12:17.040 --> 12:21.880]  you so much for having me I'm actually in town for the Texas Bitcoin conference tomorrow
[12:21.880 --> 12:25.760]  and it's a real pleasure to I mean we've done a couple of shows remotely so it's very nice
[12:25.760 --> 12:31.040]  to be able to do a show face to face well it's good to have you here brother now there's
[12:31.040 --> 12:35.720]  so much I want to throw out but I want to cover the waterfront here yeah quantifying
[12:35.720 --> 12:38.960]  because I know you're a smart guy when it comes to history that's why I like having you on
[12:38.960 --> 12:43.240]  I'm someone of a history novice myself looking at the wider spectrum I believe undoubtedly
[12:43.240 --> 12:47.480]  we're in the bottom of a very decadent phase in the cycle but coming out of that could
[12:47.480 --> 12:53.200]  be Renaissance I want to see a view agree with that be what do you expect the status
[12:53.200 --> 12:58.640]  to are the biggest religion in the world versus one of the other largest religions the liberty
[12:58.640 --> 13:02.360]  lovers you know just are into humans and human empowerment call it a religion if you want
[13:02.360 --> 13:07.200]  point is humans tend to organize in that fashion what do we do and what's going to happen as
[13:07.200 --> 13:11.760]  the status discover it's not delivering it's a fraud it's a lie they tend to double down
[13:11.760 --> 13:15.720]  and call for a hundred percent taxation the taxing class tends to start engaging in tax
[13:15.720 --> 13:20.800]  fraud where you have a $3,000 truck and they say we say it's worth 30,000 that's not happening
[13:20.800 --> 13:26.760]  to friends of mine we have like 93 Chevy Silveradoes and then the state just says sorry pay that
[13:26.760 --> 13:30.400]  we're not giving you your sticker this is happening everywhere what's going to happen
[13:30.400 --> 13:35.280]  as they double down historically what comes out of that what are they going to go through
[13:35.280 --> 13:40.560]  with the singularity stacked on top of it with all the societal crises and all the fans
[13:40.560 --> 13:46.680]  super bugs and like everything coming to a head what do you expect to happen well violence
[13:46.680 --> 13:51.840]  of course is an addiction and most addictions have to run their course you know most people
[13:51.840 --> 13:57.320]  who get involved in addictive behavior and I'm escalating and escalating and escalating
[13:57.320 --> 14:03.120]  and our focus on trying to use government violence to solve complex social problems
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.000]  I think you're right it's in it's death throws I mean how much further can it go I mean taxation
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.920]  if you count debt and so on and you count all this scale taxes all embedded in your
[14:11.920 --> 14:17.640]  income and in your bills and in your regulations and so on 60 70 80 percent who even knows what
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.440]  it is how much bigger how much more powerful can you get how much more debt can a country
[14:21.440 --> 14:26.000]  run into how many more military bases can the United States have overseas I think we're
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.200]  reaching the end mathematically and morally of this focus on trying to use the state to
[14:31.200 --> 14:37.040]  solve social problems the idea that you can solve social problems voluntarily and peacefully
[14:37.040 --> 14:43.000]  and virtuously and cooperatively is an enlightenment idea that got eclipsed by the progressive
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.480]  movement the communist movement the socialist movement of the 20s where a whole bunch of
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.280]  people so claims the moral high ground claim the moral high ground we can solve poverty
[14:50.280 --> 14:55.880]  we can solve illness we can make everybody educated we can teach the poor and now I mean
[14:55.880 --> 15:01.280]  the whole thing is completely unraveling you don't see a lot of calls outside of Obamacare
[15:01.280 --> 15:04.840]  which I think was pretty unique in that the democrats just had all the cards in one moment
[15:04.840 --> 15:08.360]  in history you don't see a lot of call for big government programs you don't actually
[15:08.360 --> 15:11.720]  see even see that much of a call for more government spending on things like education
[15:11.720 --> 15:15.960]  because they're spending so much and getting so little results I think people are recognizing
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.480]  that more money more power is not going to solve the problem and then people are beginning
[15:20.480 --> 15:25.200]  to look for alternatives it's still early but we have to be out there saying no coercion
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.640]  is never going to work to solve these problems coercion is like a drug for a toothache you
[15:30.640 --> 15:35.320]  know you take heroin for a toothache you feel fine for a little while and then the rot sets
[15:35.320 --> 15:38.600]  in deeper and then when you do finally go see the dentist it's way worse than if you've
[15:38.600 --> 15:42.680]  gone up front so in a democracy you can bribe a whole bunch of people with the money of
[15:42.680 --> 15:47.360]  the unborn you can sell off you know the fetuses to the banksters around the world the bill
[15:47.360 --> 15:50.400]  comes due and the longer we push it off the worse it's going to be and I think people
[15:50.400 --> 15:53.840]  are just kind of getting around to the point now and there's not any economists that deny
[15:53.840 --> 15:57.640]  that now you're right we've reached the point now where ten years ago we talked about this
[15:57.640 --> 16:02.440]  all that doesn't exist now it's like okay you're right it's going on but what are you
[16:02.440 --> 16:06.000]  going to do about it well the stimulus package the whole Keynesian thing right like oh well
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.960]  there's a dip in the demand which is the result of prior Fed policies and pushing everyone
[16:09.960 --> 16:13.960]  into a home policies and people say well the stimulus package is going to even things out
[16:13.960 --> 16:18.160]  and then it's going to grow again well they had the largest stimulus package in the history
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.240]  of the known universe and the economy is still a complete mess so I think people are no longer
[16:23.240 --> 16:27.080]  they they're hitting the gas pedal but there's no gas getting to the engine I think people
[16:27.080 --> 16:31.160]  are recognizing it's just not working anymore and I hope that people are beginning to look
[16:31.160 --> 16:35.440]  at voluntary options for solving some very deep social problems half of which are natural
[16:35.440 --> 16:39.760]  to the human sure but what do you expect to happen in the interim as those that follow
[16:39.760 --> 16:45.960]  the God of the state discover that the golden calf isn't going to deliver well you say some
[16:45.960 --> 16:49.560]  of them are going to double down and those people we have to call out on a moral basis
[16:49.560 --> 16:53.600]  I think the practical argument has been one you know libertarians have been saying for
[16:53.600 --> 16:58.320]  4050 years or if you count classical liberals 250 years that the state is not going to
[16:58.320 --> 17:02.080]  produce anything good in the long run we've won the practical argument because the results
[17:02.080 --> 17:06.760]  are just so catastrophic around Thomas Jefferson is right that nobody's arguing well a bit
[17:06.760 --> 17:10.000]  more state and we'll be fine you know I mean this is the death throes of the addiction
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.040]  to state coercion but what we need to start hitting people with Alex is the moral argument
[17:15.040 --> 17:20.720]  that when they say more taxation will solve the problem what they're saying is more violence
[17:20.720 --> 17:26.160]  more theft more stealing ration more stealing more debt is going to solve the problem that
[17:26.160 --> 17:30.120]  they're advocating an escalation of violence to solve complex problems got to call them
[17:30.120 --> 17:33.800]  out Marley the practical argument has been one but we need to hit them hard in the moral
[17:33.800 --> 17:39.440]  soul of plexus so to speak I agree with you let me just throw a total wildcard at you
[17:39.440 --> 17:46.800]  because I keep seeing this in the news every time I turn around leaders in government and
[17:46.800 --> 17:50.400]  the people that are over the quote child porn investigations are reportedly involved in
[17:50.400 --> 17:55.480]  it here's the Daily Mail why did number 10 cover up AIDS child porn arrest down in street
[17:55.480 --> 18:01.080]  only confirms details when pressed by mail as further sex allegations against PM's friend
[18:01.080 --> 18:06.480]  emerged here's an example of government statistically truancy officers and CPS people can look this
[18:06.480 --> 18:11.280]  up at the highest level of pedophilia so the people that are over stopping it are the ones
[18:11.280 --> 18:15.560]  that are involved in it I mean right there proves the whole state argument why is that
[18:15.560 --> 18:20.400]  what I mean what is that people who wish to do evil congregate to the state I mean this
[18:20.400 --> 18:25.360]  is the the wasn't just the BBC is the government run you have to pay the taxes for whether you
[18:25.360 --> 18:29.040]  like it or not much of pedophiles run a bunch of had just Jimmy Seville and all these people
[18:29.040 --> 18:34.080]  with like a 30 year pedophile ring going on up there people in power are the people
[18:34.080 --> 18:38.000]  who want power of the people who want to get over the rules they're imposing on others
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.400]  I mean you read this John Kerry quote about how horrible it is to invade a sovereign country
[18:42.400 --> 18:47.680]  when he was talking about Putin and Ukraine I mean the level of hypocrisy shown by those
[18:47.680 --> 18:51.620]  in power is astounding is like watching two alcoholics scream you're a drunk at each other
[18:51.620 --> 18:56.840]  when they're both complete alcoholics so people who want to do great evil gravitate to where
[18:56.840 --> 19:00.600]  you're exempt from the moral rules and exempt from the law which is at the top of the status
[19:00.600 --> 19:04.560]  apparatus that's why expecting the state to save us from evil the state is a giant magnet
[19:04.560 --> 19:09.360]  for evil doers and it gives them the most possible power that you can have in this known universe
[19:09.360 --> 19:14.360]  so it seems to me that if you want to do terrible things like like rape children yeah gravitate
[19:14.360 --> 19:18.360]  towards the government the SEC during the financial crisis delete up to the financial
[19:18.360 --> 19:23.640]  crisis the amount of pornography that was found on the SEC computers ran into the thousands
[19:23.640 --> 19:27.600]  they had PowerPoint presentations of rampant pornography being developed and shown in the
[19:27.600 --> 19:31.600]  SEC while they were supposed to be guarding everybody's financial interests well you know
[19:31.600 --> 19:34.800]  if you're into looking at porn at work of course you want to go work for the government
[19:34.800 --> 19:39.480]  because in the private sector you'd be tossed out it's just amazing how disconnected they
[19:39.480 --> 19:44.240]  are and really historically it's government Nero Caligula the examples are legion that
[19:44.240 --> 19:48.680]  become delusional announce their God and then build pyramids and say bring your children
[19:48.680 --> 19:53.640]  up here to be sacrificed to me to show your ultimate service to them the whole world becomes

[24:30.360 --> 24:36.200]  it's deaf on model news take on that the incredible anti gun confiscation garbage that's going

[24:45.800 --> 24:50.720]  unprecedented the status they're now losing the intellectual battle so they're moving
[24:50.720 --> 24:55.080]  toward censorship that's coming up in the next long segment this segment's only six
[24:55.080 --> 25:00.040]  minutes long and Stefan I know you're a big geopolitical analyst I wanted to get your
[25:00.040 --> 25:06.640]  take on the situation in the Crimea in the Ukraine well I guess the first thing to recognize
[25:06.640 --> 25:12.200]  is that up until 1953 the Ukraine was part of Russia and they still very much identify
[25:12.200 --> 25:17.240]  I mean the the whole eastern half of the country speaks Russian and and is very nationalistic
[25:17.240 --> 25:24.680]  very Russian nationalistic it is one of the most corrupt autocracies in in all of Europe
[25:24.680 --> 25:28.800]  in fact in in all the world outside of Africa I mean the level of corruption is it's a mess
[25:28.800 --> 25:33.800]  staggering I mean the amount of debt and so on now they want to join the EU a study came
[25:33.800 --> 25:36.920]  I shouldn't laugh because it's just tragic but a study came out in I think I'm out of
[25:36.920 --> 25:40.920]  the fire into the furnace yeah I mean that the the amount of corruption in the EU has
[25:40.920 --> 25:46.280]  been estimated conservatively is about the same size as the entire economy of the of
[25:46.280 --> 25:50.440]  Ukraine so the idea that they're going to go to the EU to try and get away from corruption
[25:50.440 --> 25:55.160]  is completely mad yes out of the frying pan into the fire now of course Russia has for
[25:55.160 --> 25:59.800]  many years been paying the Ukraine to store the black sorry so the fourth fleet is is
[25:59.800 --> 26:03.880]  in the Crimea and when in a time of instability when they don't know which way the government
[26:03.880 --> 26:08.080]  is going to go it seems to me I'm no don't know for sure but it seems to me that Putin
[26:08.080 --> 26:12.720]  is simply saying I need to go in and secure my fleet because I don't know what's going
[26:12.720 --> 26:16.480]  to happen to the government and this is exactly I mean if Turkey was about to be taken over
[26:16.480 --> 26:20.080]  if America thought Turkey was about to be taken over by a communist government they
[26:20.080 --> 26:23.440]  would move in to secure their bases they would move in to secure their military assets it
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.080]  seems to me that was this is right on the Russian border and used to be part of Russia
[26:27.080 --> 26:31.440]  so it's it's I'm not defending Russia it's just the West is in there starting the whole
[26:31.440 --> 26:36.720]  thing is my issue yeah and of course Russia a Putin one of Putin's arguments is look he
[26:36.720 --> 26:41.120]  says I stood behind the America when they went into Iraq which I disagreed with when
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.840]  they wanted some of the Eastern Bloc countries to join EU and NATO I didn't stand in the
[26:45.840 --> 26:49.680]  way but you know enough interference you know they he feels that the West is coming in an
[26:49.680 --> 26:53.960]  interfering on stuff right on the border and remember what happened in 62 when the muscles
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.480]  were going to be installed in Cuba I mean America went insane because it was right off
[26:57.480 --> 27:01.920]  the coast of America and this is right off the coast right off the coast is right attached
[27:01.920 --> 27:06.560]  to Russia and it was a former satellite so no but you're right they're moving NATO ships
[27:06.560 --> 27:12.080]  into that area as well yeah and it's a major escalation and America has been spending five
[27:12.080 --> 27:18.240]  billion dollars over the past 15 20 years to promote its agenda and you train and you
[27:18.240 --> 27:22.440]  know there's been some reports that some of the protesters are being directly paid by
[27:22.440 --> 27:29.240]  American satellite organizations and so on so that is an extreme invasion of sovereignty
[27:29.240 --> 27:34.360]  of of Eastern Europe and of Russia again not to defend Russia it's an autocracy and put
[27:34.360 --> 27:38.840]  in the horrible but it's a giant provocation and in common law and in common sense you
[27:38.840 --> 27:44.400]  start something you lose moral high ground which shows the delusional nature with Kerry
[27:44.400 --> 27:48.600]  saying you can't invade countries when they just did this to Syria they just did this
[27:48.600 --> 27:54.480]  to Libya and now they actually started this operation it just shows the hubris you raised
[27:54.480 --> 27:59.760]  the point of Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney and Obama laughing on yeah so in a debate with
[27:59.760 --> 28:04.480]  Mitt Romney in the last cycle Mitt Romney said well you know when Russia could do something
[28:04.480 --> 28:08.400]  in the Ukraine and Barack Obama laughed at him and said the 1980s are calling they want
[28:08.400 --> 28:12.760]  their foreign policy back the cold was been over for 20 years now I think the Democratic
[28:12.760 --> 28:16.280]  Party is all it had had a pretty soft spot for Russia since the Al Jazeera incident and
[28:16.280 --> 28:21.960]  the huec and they were covering up so much of spies Russian spies inside putting libertarians
[28:21.960 --> 28:26.320]  and conservatives and freedom lovers in death camps is their dream so Stalin was kind of
[28:26.320 --> 28:30.040]  their rock star yeah and the covering up of Stalin's crimes and all of this kind of stuff
[28:30.040 --> 28:34.520]  so people what they have they have been up spread centerfolds of Stalin oh yeah they've
[28:34.520 --> 28:37.680]  they've really been very pro-communist very pro-Russia because they're on the left right
[28:37.680 --> 28:41.680]  because I'm you know the moment is like anti Russia on the left is about as prevalent as
[28:41.680 --> 28:45.560]  anti-war sentiments when you have a Democrat in the White House so yeah so I think that
[28:45.560 --> 28:49.480]  they're not really seeing things very clearly Russia has changed to some degree but it is
[28:49.480 --> 28:55.400]  still remains very autocratic very very dictatorial and you know this guy came out of the KGB ranks
[28:55.400 --> 29:00.000]  not known for its touchy friendly Democratic feelers so I think it is not something that
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.160]  is going to be a huge escalation situation it's just that they moved to protect their
[29:03.160 --> 29:07.200]  military assets when there was unstable government that seems to me I mean I don't agree with
[29:07.200 --> 29:10.720]  any of it I mean it's all that just a bunch of thugs but I can and the EU just wants
[29:10.720 --> 29:15.240]  to liquidate of another corrupt state and suck it dry and this group of thugs want
[29:15.240 --> 29:20.720]  to be paid off by the EU for the assets I mean all it is is Russia and the EU and George
[29:20.720 --> 29:25.480]  Soros struggling over looting something well and now you know way the way that being bought
[29:25.480 --> 29:29.400]  off and it all comes back down to buying people off it's all just a mafia movie in in nice
[29:29.400 --> 29:33.760]  suits but they all end up getting to now the EU is going to put a $15 billion aid package
[29:33.760 --> 29:37.360]  in America is going to kick up in another billion dollars loan guarantees the banks
[29:37.360 --> 29:40.840]  isn't getting paid it's like a payday loan yeah the banks just get paid and the poor
[29:40.840 --> 29:44.000]  get poorer it's the same story over and over all right I want to come back and cover a

[34:57.860 --> 35:03.580]  wasn't on the air anymore. He took 2 million viewers every night and had it down to 380,000
[35:03.580 --> 35:08.300]  when he left. And it's the same for MSNBC. They're all in free fall, so I ask you the
[35:08.300 --> 35:15.220]  question. Maybe zombies are real. I always thought it was medically impossible. You have
[35:15.220 --> 35:17.540]  zombie banks. This is zombie media.
[35:17.540 --> 35:23.060]  Well, look, I mean, the gun thing is tricky. And it's not tricky because the facts aren't
[35:23.060 --> 35:27.740]  on the side of the First Amendment rights, Second Amendment rights, guys. It's just
[35:27.740 --> 35:31.340]  tricky because people see a gun and they think violence. They don't think protection.
[35:31.340 --> 35:32.340]  Sure, I get it.
[35:32.340 --> 35:35.300]  People see a cop with the gun and they think protection. But they see a private citizen
[35:35.300 --> 35:39.420]  with a gun and the less intelligent among us are like, ooh, that's violent.
[35:39.420 --> 35:40.620]  Hollywood told them that.
[35:40.620 --> 35:46.780]  Yeah. And so the idea that guns prevent crime is kind of confusing to people. And you know,
[35:46.780 --> 35:49.660]  it's like you exercise and you feel tired. It's like, well, how is this supposed to make
[35:49.660 --> 35:54.180]  me feel stronger? It's like, you make you feel tired. So for people who just live on the
[35:54.180 --> 35:58.260]  surface and see, oh, there's a gun. That must mean there's crime as opposed to the idea
[35:58.260 --> 36:01.260]  that guns prevent what millions of crimes.
[36:01.260 --> 36:02.260]  It's unbelievable.
[36:02.260 --> 36:04.940]  But what you don't see people have a tough time with, right?
[36:04.940 --> 36:09.020]  40 plus crimes are stopped, FBI's own numbers. They don't like to advertise for every time
[36:09.020 --> 36:10.300]  it's used in a crime.
[36:10.300 --> 36:14.300]  Right. Right. And they say, well, you know, you're more in danger of shooting yourself
[36:14.300 --> 36:17.700]  with a gun and all that kind of stuff. It's like, I think that statistically this is all
[36:17.700 --> 36:18.700]  very false.
[36:18.700 --> 36:21.180]  Well, it's like saying you can't have a car. You might get killed with it. I mean, nothing's
[36:21.180 --> 36:22.180]  safe.
[36:22.180 --> 36:28.380]  Well, there is this weird, dumb thinking where if you get rid of guns, you get rid of violence,
[36:28.380 --> 36:31.820]  which is again, it's just not true. It's like, you know, then why don't people say, well,
[36:31.820 --> 36:34.500]  let's get rid of police and we'll get rid of arrests and we'll get rid of jails and
[36:34.500 --> 36:38.340]  then there'll be no violence because nobody is fundamentally against guns.
[36:38.340 --> 36:43.580]  What they are for the anti-gun people, what they're for is for guns to be centralized
[36:43.580 --> 36:47.700]  in the hands of the elite. They are for the guns being centralized in the hands of the
[36:47.700 --> 36:51.860]  cops because if you have anti-gun laws, cops with guns need to go around in people's houses
[36:51.860 --> 36:53.940]  and take those guns away.
[36:53.940 --> 36:56.060]  Which is now happening in Connecticut and California.
[36:56.060 --> 37:00.100]  And nobody, this is one thing to be really clear with anti-gun people. They're not anti-gun.
[37:00.100 --> 37:04.540]  They are very pro-government guns. They're just anti-private citizens' guns, which is
[37:04.540 --> 37:06.380]  always something that happens.
[37:06.380 --> 37:08.220]  That's right. It's the ultimate form of discrimination.
[37:08.220 --> 37:09.220]  Yeah.
[37:09.220 --> 37:12.820]  They've got, that's why they obsess on religion and race and sexual preference because they
[37:12.820 --> 37:14.420]  don't care about all that.
[37:14.420 --> 37:17.860]  But when it comes to foreign banks getting bailouts, when it comes to them being exempt,
[37:17.860 --> 37:22.420]  diplomatic immunity, they have bodyguards. We don't. They're flaming hypocrites.
[37:22.420 --> 37:26.260]  Yeah. Why don't you get the Secret Service to stop having guns if not having guns around
[37:26.260 --> 37:27.260]  prevents crime?
[37:27.260 --> 37:30.660]  It's like, I mean, they spend so much money protecting the president with massive amounts
[37:30.660 --> 37:35.180]  of military force. And then for private citizens, you can't have protection, but they love it.
[37:35.180 --> 37:37.540]  They love it when you don't have private protection.
[37:37.540 --> 37:40.660]  Why? Well, you know why? Because then you're dependent on the government for protection,
[37:40.660 --> 37:44.540]  which will never come. Look, what's happening to Detroit. It takes an hour or two to get
[37:44.540 --> 37:46.060]  somebody to come by after a non-level call.
[37:46.060 --> 37:47.540]  And the police chief said buy a gun.
[37:47.540 --> 37:53.020]  Yeah. And basically, they're there to identify your body if you're unlucky. So the government
[37:53.020 --> 37:56.780]  is continually breaking your leg and saying, then giving you a crush and saying, see without
[37:56.780 --> 38:00.180]  me, you couldn't even walk. And this is what they do. They want to take away your protection
[38:00.180 --> 38:03.860]  the same way they want to take away your capacity to create your own jobs. So then you're dependent
[38:03.860 --> 38:06.980]  upon government providing you minimum wage security and all that kind of stuff. They
[38:06.980 --> 38:10.860]  want to take away your capacity to save. So you're dependent upon them for old age pension.
[38:10.860 --> 38:13.700]  And then they even write white papers like Cloward and Pivot admitting it.
[38:13.700 --> 38:18.540]  Absolutely. The creation of a dependent underclass is one of the most savage aspects of late
[38:18.540 --> 38:24.260]  model democracy. And it's resisted to some degree by the Republicans, but it is avidly
[38:24.260 --> 38:28.380]  pursued by the Democrats. And now, of course, they want to make you dependent on the government
[38:28.380 --> 38:32.700]  for your healthcare, one of the most sensitive, difficult, emotionally draining and unstable
[38:32.700 --> 38:36.420]  things that happens. They're going to keep breaking the system until they say, look,
[38:36.420 --> 38:38.180]  we have to take it over. It's so broken.
[38:38.180 --> 38:41.180]  And by the way, you said that everybody else said that because we know how they operate
[38:41.180 --> 38:44.980]  in other countries, it's not like this is the first time they've done this. We watch
[38:44.980 --> 38:49.340]  them over and over again. And then even Ezekiel Emanuel comes out and says, yeah, we're trying
[38:49.340 --> 38:53.860]  to wreck the healthcare system right now. I mean, if I was trying to wreck a fire department,
[38:53.860 --> 38:57.300]  I should be thrown in jail. If I wanted to burn down the fire department, he wants to
[38:57.300 --> 39:03.860]  burn down the healthcare system, destroy our and then he's a hero. And he admits it on
[39:03.860 --> 39:06.300]  Fox News.
[39:06.300 --> 39:10.780]  It's terrorism. It's terrorism, you know, by any rational definition, it is terror.
[39:10.780 --> 39:15.180]  That's right. He's a terrorist. Yeah, you are. You are destroying the lifeline for human
[39:15.180 --> 39:20.060]  beings to survive illnesses. And you are making them dependent upon a system. Now, it's the
[39:20.060 --> 39:23.540]  beginning. This is this happened in Canada, which nationalized healthcare generation
[39:23.540 --> 39:27.460]  or two ago. Now, the first generation gets it pretty good because the doctors all grew
[39:27.460 --> 39:31.260]  up in that system in the remnants of the free market they used to do in house calls. They're
[39:31.260 --> 39:34.580]  used to being really good at serving their honorable. Yeah, that doesn't just change.
[39:34.580 --> 39:38.020]  It's a ghost in the machine. It kind of and then it takes a while for that echo effect
[39:38.020 --> 39:41.420]  to fade away. And then the next generation of doctors who come in who never face any
[39:41.420 --> 39:44.980]  free market restrictions or never had to do customer service and they basically get paid
[39:44.980 --> 39:49.540]  by the government for ignoring their patients. The second generation is where it really,
[39:49.540 --> 39:53.660]  really gets hit hard. And that's what happened in Canada as well. First generation, doctors
[39:53.660 --> 39:56.580]  still working hard. They're still caring about the be, you know, suddenly stop caring because
[39:56.580 --> 40:00.020]  the government takes over. But the next generation of doctors, you know, it's like the first
[40:00.020 --> 40:03.140]  generation of the NASA engineers did some great stuff. You know, what have they done over
[40:03.140 --> 40:06.220]  the last 30 years? They've just get photocopied in the space shuttle and calling it progress.
[40:06.220 --> 40:10.220]  And then, you know, so this is one thing that is an illusion that when you take something
[40:10.220 --> 40:13.500]  over and you got some free market remnants, it actually works relatively okay. And it
[40:13.500 --> 40:17.900]  slowly goes out of focus over time. Then the next generation, as is so often the case with
[40:17.900 --> 40:22.140]  the government gets really hosed with, with debt and a completely dysfunctional system.
[40:22.140 --> 40:26.140]  I mean, when they first privatized the, the educational system, the teachers didn't wake
[40:26.140 --> 40:30.660]  up not caring anymore, right? But a generation or two later, when you can no longer get fired
[40:30.660 --> 40:34.620]  and everyone's just going in there to hide out from any public free market. Yeah. Then
[40:34.620 --> 40:38.500]  it gets worse and worse and worse. But by then the system is too embedded to undo with anything
[40:38.500 --> 40:43.180]  short of revolution. I mean, sort of a verbal revolution, a revolution and no one can deny.
[40:43.180 --> 40:47.060]  Look at all the numbers. I mean, the metrics, the, the, the lowering test scores, the physically
[40:47.060 --> 40:52.940]  lowering IQ, the obesity, the, the cancer rates, the, the saving rates. I mean, we
[40:52.940 --> 40:59.020]  every gauge, the West is in free fall. And the problem is you look at everywhere else.
[40:59.020 --> 41:04.220]  They've, they've never even gone up to the heights to fall. I mean, it's a bad, what
[41:04.220 --> 41:09.340]  do you expect if we don't get the new Renaissance going on absolute new dark age? I mean, this
[41:09.340 --> 41:13.220]  is a pretty bad situation. Yeah. I mean, I, I, you know, the, the one thing
[41:13.220 --> 41:18.100]  that is so frustrating, you know, as a, a former technology entrepreneur and executive,
[41:18.100 --> 41:22.140]  one thing that's so frustrating Alex is that the remnants of the free market keep creating
[41:22.140 --> 41:26.780]  all of these incredible things, you know, like cell phones where you can video around
[41:26.780 --> 41:31.580]  the world, you know, when you're on a data plan virtually for free. And all of this stuff
[41:31.580 --> 41:35.100]  that is so incredible, the human productivity, human connectivity, you know, we have the
[41:35.100 --> 41:39.580]  new Gutenberg press, as you and I talked about in a show before, which allows us to communicate
[41:39.580 --> 41:43.780]  the greatest ideas with no gatekeepers, no people in the way between people who've got
[41:43.780 --> 41:46.780]  great ideas and people who can receive them. You don't have to pass through the sensorious
[41:46.780 --> 41:49.700]  field. We're not saying the technology is bad. It's just that Soran's trying to put
[41:49.700 --> 41:55.060]  his will into the computers. Go ahead. The government keeps taking it over. And, and
[41:55.060 --> 41:59.460]  that which was designed to facilitate communication and spread ideas is now being used to. Well,
[41:59.460 --> 42:04.180]  it's like you said, the paradox. It's true. Historically, a freer country creates so much
[42:04.180 --> 42:09.060]  wealth. Everyone's bathing and luxury. Then the kids become spoiled. They don't appreciate
[42:09.060 --> 42:13.980]  it. Deconnitz comes in. Terany comes in. How do you get by that cycle? By having huge human
[42:13.980 --> 42:19.580]  goals that we individually believe in so collectively carry out? Well, you, you, my
[42:19.580 --> 42:23.780]  argument is that you have to rethink all the basic human institutions that we have inherited
[42:23.780 --> 42:27.460]  from history. Everything that is inherited is open to question. You know, we did this
[42:27.460 --> 42:32.580]  with slavery in the West, right? I mean, the Western European Christian culture. We ended
[42:32.580 --> 42:35.580]  it. Shall we get blind with it? Yeah, of course. Naturally, right? I mean, nobody's
[42:35.580 --> 42:38.620]  going to the Muslim's reparations. They had a far harsher slave trade than the West.
[42:38.620 --> 42:42.060]  Well, it's going on right now. Yeah. And only 5% of the slaves in the Atlantic trade ended
[42:42.060 --> 42:45.100]  up in America, which, you know, it doesn't justify the institution, but it certainly
[42:45.100 --> 42:48.380]  means that if you're going to look for scapegoats for slavery, you don't start with America.
[42:48.380 --> 42:54.020]  But what happens is every institution, now we've inherited this centralized collective
[42:54.020 --> 42:58.820]  violent monopoly called the state. I think we need to open it up to question. Is this
[42:58.820 --> 43:02.660]  the best way to organize society? Do we really want to get stuck in this continual cycle
[43:02.660 --> 43:06.940]  where the government lets you have some freedom? You generate some wealth. The government takes
[43:06.940 --> 43:10.620]  that wealth and uses it to expand itself at your expense and eventually kills the goose
[43:10.620 --> 43:14.460]  that lays the golden egg. This cycle has been around since ancient Egypt, ancient Rome,
[43:14.460 --> 43:18.820]  ancient Greece, modern, the modern British Empire, German, empire, Austria, Hungarian
[43:18.820 --> 43:22.980]  empires. It's the same thing. A little bit of freedom. Make some money. Government taxes,
[43:22.980 --> 43:29.660]  grows into an empire. They become arrogant, disconnected. And then there's this, you kill
[43:29.660 --> 43:33.100]  the remnants of the free market. Where is America down now? They went down like five
[43:33.100 --> 43:36.300]  or six points in the economic freedom. Oh, yeah. Well, there's like scores of countries
[43:36.300 --> 43:40.580]  ahead of us now. Yeah. And in freedom of the press and everything, we're going down. But
[43:40.580 --> 43:45.200]  on the plus side, the mainstream media appears to be having a good internet stake being driven
[43:45.200 --> 43:49.340]  through its heart, which I think is a glorious end to a ghastly beast. And that brings me
[43:49.340 --> 43:54.220]  to my next point. They will then respond by trying to censor. And there's moves and I'll
[43:54.220 --> 43:59.300]  let you deny manmade global warming. Bloomberg moves to ban pro-gun speech. Facebook now working
[43:59.300 --> 44:03.940]  with a former New York mayor to censor support for the Second Amendment. And it goes to these
[44:03.940 --> 44:09.460]  anti-gun sites where they're in talks and admit he's funding it to not let pro-Second
[44:09.460 --> 44:12.900]  Amendment speech beyond Facebook. They can have bots that block it. We've already seen
[44:12.900 --> 44:18.060]  our pro-gun memes being blocked. People go, well, that's their own. They own that site.
[44:18.060 --> 44:24.660]  They advertised it as a commons. Yes. They had they built it on our material like YouTube.
[44:24.660 --> 44:29.180]  And then now they're clearly in. I mean, this is we don't know what they're being threatened
[44:29.180 --> 44:33.380]  with behind the scenes. I mean, I can't imagine that. I'm just saying that's outrageous. No,
[44:33.380 --> 44:36.780]  it is now. Bloomberg wants to get rid of free speech. The beauty of it though. They only
[44:36.780 --> 44:41.220]  shoot at the they only shoot at the airplanes over the target, right? When you get close
[44:41.220 --> 44:44.700]  at the target, that's when you get the anti. Oh, we're kicking their butt. Yeah. So the
[44:44.700 --> 44:48.740]  fact that, I mean, you know, you're achieving something when the powers that be don't like
[44:48.740 --> 44:52.060]  what you're doing. You know, you know, a drug works on an illness when the illness, if it
[44:52.060 --> 44:56.660]  were conscious, would hate that drug, right? So the fact that there's outrage and frustration
[44:56.660 --> 45:01.100]  and counterattacks squealing. It's beautiful. I mean, if you know, you're doing nothing.
[45:01.100 --> 45:04.060]  If it doesn't, you know, if nobody is bothered by anything you're doing, there's a great quote
[45:04.060 --> 45:08.140]  from Churchill where he said, you have enemies. Good. That means that you have stood up for
[45:08.140 --> 45:13.700]  something sometime in your life. And the fact that people are being attacked for pro free
[45:13.700 --> 45:19.220]  speech, for pro gun, for pro freedom, for pro trade, for anti. Yeah, don't take it like,
[45:19.220 --> 45:22.980]  oh, I better give up. Take it like, I'm, I'm affecting something. I'm on to something here.
[45:22.980 --> 45:26.340]  I'm bothering bad people. That's what good people are supposed to do. We're supposed
[45:26.340 --> 45:30.420]  to bother bad people. That's the whole point. So I think it's great that there's a lot of
[45:30.420 --> 45:34.500]  flak being sent up. If there wasn't, we'd be, we'd be peddling in a basement in the
[45:34.500 --> 45:38.580]  dark doing nothing, but it does show what authoritarians they are. They're now sending
[45:38.580 --> 45:42.340]  out hundreds of thousands of letters saying, well, you didn't turn in your semi automatic
[45:42.340 --> 45:46.860]  handgun or you didn't register it, turn it in or we're going to SWAT team you. That article
[45:46.860 --> 45:51.980]  is linked on red on info wars.com. They're trying to pass another law to expand gun confiscation.
[45:51.980 --> 45:56.100]  They're banning basically gun manufacturing in California with micro stamping. They just
[45:56.100 --> 46:01.060]  shut down the last lead smelter for lead bullets. I mean, they, so, so yeah, I mean, I want
[46:01.060 --> 46:05.620]  people, especially young people, lift the curtain, see the gun, see the gun that is
[46:05.620 --> 46:09.220]  the state, you know, like there was this very energetic occupy movement where they were
[46:09.220 --> 46:12.540]  outraged at the bankers, right? And they would, they wanted to, and they are all these crazy
[46:12.540 --> 46:14.820]  socialist nonsense because, you know, they're academic.
[46:14.820 --> 46:19.060]  Let's try to hijack it. Yeah, yeah, I got it. But what they did see, which was a terrifyingly
[46:19.060 --> 46:25.620]  beautiful thing for the young to see, what they saw was 3,000 activists being arrested
[46:25.620 --> 46:30.100]  and zero bankers. In fact, the bankers got hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts.
[46:30.100 --> 46:35.140]  And Homeland Security simultaneously directing it in 35 cities. Yeah, they're being scooped
[46:35.140 --> 46:39.620]  up at 2am. Yeah, and good. I mean, I'm sorry that it happened to them, but at least they're
[46:39.620 --> 46:44.180]  seeing what it is that they're facing. And they will be, hopefully if they've got any
[46:44.180 --> 46:47.860]  brains in their skulls, they will not be tempted to go to the state for solutions when they
[46:47.860 --> 46:51.820]  see the state paying off the people who prey upon the poor and the middle class and who
[46:51.820 --> 46:56.420]  sell off the unborn in debt and bonds. They will see them rewarding those people and arresting
[46:56.420 --> 46:59.740]  their brothers and sisters in a revolutionary movement. Hopefully then they will turn away
[46:59.740 --> 47:03.980]  from the state because we all we need to do is lift the veil. Evil can never win because
[47:03.980 --> 47:06.820]  the moment that people see it as evil, they reject it. Evil always has to come.
[47:06.820 --> 47:09.820]  Well, that's right. As soon as we understand the new world order is a private corporate
[47:09.820 --> 47:14.620]  system that's anti free market seeking to shut down competition through the state monopoly
[47:14.620 --> 47:18.420]  combined. As soon as those two things are connected by the right wing and the left wing,
[47:18.420 --> 47:23.660]  it's game over. It's game over that George Soros is basically tax exempt, General Electric
[47:23.660 --> 47:28.220]  Google, Warren Buffett, his company's 400 plus billion of bailout money the last six
[47:28.220 --> 47:33.220]  years while he lobbies for higher taxes on the middle class because he literally is shutting
[47:33.220 --> 47:38.500]  down his competition while feeding on us like a mosquito. I mean, it's game over for that
[47:38.500 --> 47:39.500]  piece of crap.
[47:39.500 --> 47:43.380]  The minute that's understood. Yeah, what's it? A guy who goes to buy a joint in Colorado
[47:43.380 --> 47:49.060]  has in that purchase paid more taxes than all of General Electric. Yeah, they make up the
[47:49.060 --> 47:53.140]  rules and they exempt themselves. That's the whole point of power is to inflict rules on
[47:53.140 --> 47:57.300]  others and escape those rules yourself. You know, if you could convince everyone else
[47:57.300 --> 48:01.380]  in the world to not be a thief, your job as a thief would be totally easy. Nobody would
[48:01.380 --> 48:04.940]  have any locks. They wouldn't protect anything. They just assume they lost it or mislaid it,
[48:04.940 --> 48:05.940]  right?
[48:05.940 --> 48:09.580]  The whole purpose of ethics historically has been to convince the masses to be good so
[48:09.580 --> 48:13.180]  that they're productive, which makes them fatter cattle to be preyed on by the rulers.
[48:13.180 --> 48:17.840]  The rulers give us ethics to make sure we don't compete with their evil. It's got nothing
[48:17.840 --> 48:21.940]  to do with them actually believing, you know, Thou shall not steal as a foundational ethic.
[48:21.940 --> 48:25.020]  I don't believe anyone has ever said, well, but you see taxation is a form of theft and
[48:25.020 --> 48:28.100]  therefore it's a violation of one of the Ten Commandments. That's like Ron Paul's sign.
[48:28.100 --> 48:32.260]  He says, don't steal. Government doesn't like competition. I hate competition. Yeah. This
[48:32.260 --> 48:36.020]  is the whole problem of ethics. It's invented by, and I'm an ethical guy and I believe in
[48:36.020 --> 48:40.220]  universal ethics and I believe in virtue. But the problem is they use it to make us simple
[48:40.220 --> 48:46.700]  to chomps and naive while they are rapacious. Yeah. I mean, only idiots rob banks. If you
[48:46.700 --> 48:50.020]  want to be a good bank robber, own a bank. That's the way. That's the way. Exactly.
[48:50.020 --> 48:53.860]  But to make your point, I interrupted about that. Well, it's just so we're always told
[48:53.860 --> 48:58.140]  as kids, you know, like, don't steal. Don't push. Don't use force to get your way. Negotiate.
[48:58.140 --> 49:02.040]  Use your words. That's what they always say, right? And when you see something like internationally
[49:02.040 --> 49:06.220]  that's what's happening with the Ukraine, what do they do? They threaten economic sanctions.
[49:06.220 --> 49:09.980]  They threaten ostracism. They threaten to cancel travel visas. They threaten all of
[49:09.980 --> 49:14.580]  this kind of stuff. They're using their words, not their guns and their bombs because Russia
[49:14.580 --> 49:18.380]  has power. Russia has nukes, right? That the age of European warfare ended with the invention
[49:18.380 --> 49:25.180]  of the nuclear bomb. But with us, we get guns and we get jail with us. So with each other,
[49:25.180 --> 49:28.900]  with rulers, they all deal with each other diplomatically and they negotiate and they
[49:28.900 --> 49:33.180]  threaten things and so on. But they don't threaten war that much in the West anymore.
[49:33.180 --> 49:38.380]  But with us, we get guns and we get jail. And this is the horrible. And it's only because
[49:38.380 --> 49:42.420]  it's safe for us. We don't have nukes. Yeah, of course. I mean, we're we're the livestock
[49:42.420 --> 49:46.260]  and they care about us in so far as they want us to be productive. They empathize with us
[49:46.260 --> 49:49.860]  like a farmer empathizes with a cow's desire not to put his face in it. And they describe
[49:49.860 --> 49:54.180]  us all elites throughout history, call their subjects cattle. Oh, absolutely. We're just
[49:54.180 --> 49:58.420]  a form of livestock. And this is the first. The Aztecs called their lower class, you know,
[49:58.420 --> 50:02.500]  you know, basically livestock. So that's your livestock. You know, in the ancient, you know,
[50:02.500 --> 50:06.540]  Hebrew stuff, the neighbors were at livestock. But I mean, every to the Egyptians, everybody
[50:06.540 --> 50:10.740]  else was livestock. Every the Nazis, everybody else was livestock. Yeah. I mean, that's how
[50:10.740 --> 50:13.260]  it works. We're going to go to break. Come right back with phone calls. We'll be with
[50:13.260 --> 50:16.860]  us 20 minutes the next hour. We'll get into the healthcare, the global warming, all of

[54:25.460 --> 54:43.780]  Make no mistake as I like to say we do not live in boring times it was very interesting
[54:43.780 --> 54:47.540]  times the old Chinese adage that yeah it's interesting but it also has a double meaning
[54:47.540 --> 54:51.820]  it's very serious and you know the crazy thing is I'm just somebody that studied history
[54:51.820 --> 54:57.460]  in common sense and much of what we've broken down has turned out to be the truth they've
[54:57.460 --> 55:01.260]  gone through this process of there's no government drug dealing there's no government money laundering
[55:01.260 --> 55:05.900]  there's there's no cancer viruses being out of the vaccines there's no covered population
[55:05.900 --> 55:10.380]  reduction programs now it's just all coming out but it almost just unoculates people
[55:10.380 --> 55:16.380]  psychologically to go okay big deal to where they'll put up with anything so how do you
[55:16.380 --> 55:21.660]  quantify that paradox I'm kind of getting it well for me at least being a freedom fighter
[55:21.660 --> 55:26.660]  means always being sorry that I'm right you know cuz it's like I feel like a sort of doctor
[55:26.660 --> 55:29.380]  you know you got a patient who smokes and smokes you keep saying man you gotta stop
[55:29.380 --> 55:32.900]  smoking it's gonna make you sick you gotta say and a guy keeps smoking and then he gets
[55:32.900 --> 55:37.580]  sick and you're like man I hate being right I just I wish I'd been wrong like it so it
[55:37.580 --> 55:42.020]  had all turned out to be not be true and we now the poor but no longer poor income disparities
[55:42.020 --> 55:46.860]  had come down national debt had been paid off and peace and unicorns and rainbows you know
[55:46.860 --> 55:53.500]  populated the planet but it is a gruesome thing to know where this kind of system leads
[55:53.500 --> 56:00.220]  there is no end to power lust you know they've done studies the acquisition of power over
[56:00.220 --> 56:05.460]  other human beings is more addictive than cocaine it actually releases the same kind
[56:05.460 --> 56:10.380]  of chemical hormones in the brain that a drug addiction does yeah but I like seeing people
[56:10.380 --> 56:18.260]  empowered in art and literature and and you know huge exploration being launched I don't
[56:18.260 --> 56:22.420]  like telling people what to do no no but that's you know because you're not addicted to power
[56:22.420 --> 56:29.820]  but it is a very very powerful addiction right I mean what's that guy said stroke of the
[56:29.820 --> 56:35.420]  pen law the land oh my god yeah I mean pretty stroke of the pen law the land gotta go yeah
[56:35.420 --> 56:40.300]  I mean that that amount of power to I mean imagine what Obama can do what about Obama
[56:40.300 --> 56:44.620]  going I'm good at killing people yeah well you know he may not like to I mean even if
[56:44.620 --> 56:48.740]  you're a real killer you don't like oh I'm really good at killing people yeah my existence
[56:48.740 --> 56:53.340]  an ad I've not seen on anyone's business card yet but but Obama I mean look at this he can
[56:53.340 --> 56:59.380]  he can pass Obamacare he can then add thousands of amendments to it after the fact with no
[56:59.380 --> 57:05.260]  congressional approval he can be the savior of his own bill yeah he can fix his own problem
[57:05.260 --> 57:10.860]  he can they can hand out waivers a direct contradiction of the Constitution total discrimination
[57:10.860 --> 57:14.380]  yes supposed to guarantee you equal equal treatment under the law they're handing out thousands
[57:14.380 --> 57:19.500]  of those are royal indulgences those are you this is it's it's papal middle ages nonsense
[57:19.500 --> 57:24.620]  right so and that kind of power you can lie to people and say you'll keep your doctor
[57:24.620 --> 57:28.460]  and then what are the consequences I mean you lie to the government you are going away
[57:28.460 --> 57:33.340]  to in a dark hole for a very long time the government lies to you they get your vote with
[57:33.340 --> 57:37.740]  no negative consequences they have no contract with you that's right when the FBI's been
[57:37.740 --> 57:40.540]  here before with subpoenas for people threatening on the website or something you know just
[57:40.540 --> 57:44.820]  sad issues they go talk to me and I go I'm cannot talk to you because you'll you always
[57:44.820 --> 57:48.620]  people in jail saying they gave false answers and that's unconstitutional law I'm not talking
[57:48.620 --> 57:52.220]  to you yeah we'll talk to me no you understand the first rule of fight club is don't talk
[57:52.220 --> 57:55.420]  to the government the second rule is don't talk to the government the third rule is keep
[57:55.420 --> 57:59.060]  your mouth shut yeah the fourth rule shut up the what's the fifth rule I don't talk to
[57:59.060 --> 58:02.220]  the government yeah exactly I got on a limb here it kind of goes on friend right kind of
[58:02.220 --> 58:05.740]  goes for infinity the eighth rule interestingly enough is don't talk to the government but
[58:05.740 --> 58:09.900]  yes yes so so they have no duty to protect you they have no duty to control you you have
[58:09.900 --> 58:13.580]  no control over your government people think that the vote you all you're doing is voting
[58:13.580 --> 58:16.940]  for people already bought and sold by special interests you know they should have those
[58:16.940 --> 58:20.700]  NASCAR stickers all over the congressman by who's bought and sold them it's not your interest
[58:20.700 --> 58:24.540]  that there's well that's it people in government corporations and all this they just join their
[58:24.540 --> 58:29.060]  group and then distort everything according to what group they're with and I thought I
[58:29.060 --> 58:34.900]  was on team humanity to have a college of ideas where we vote in the free market or
[58:34.900 --> 58:41.180]  we believe in through free association that's what builds a great civilization back thank

[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:24.620]  upon the poor in the working class after talking about capitalist being evil for doing the
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:29.500]  same thing he had sex with his maid had a kid toss her out on the street never paid her
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:34.500]  a penny all the studies that carl marx did of the market system at the time he could
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:38.700]  never find a worker who didn't wasn't paid anything except in his own house his maid he
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:42.260]  was the worst exploiter i was just pointing out the moral hypocrisy and he was an angel
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:46.580]  compared to lennon oh yeah well then he wasn't an outright murderer marx but lennon was an
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:51.380]  outright just savage genocidal murderer i mean non-stop blood fests but sorry can call
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.460]  her even i get distracted did you have a question well yeah it's kind of funny though just real
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:02:00.580]  quick i want to talk about the irs i'm being honest but it's funny how these neo marxists
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:08.100]  of today through osmosis almost have this same degree of hypocrisy that carl marx did
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:12.460]  i mean it's almost like it's through osmosis some it's just incredible blood thirsty criminals
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:17.740]  who have grabbed the moral high ground and lecture to everyone when they're exempt from
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:22.340]  everything they're doing and engage in every dirty trick and hey you try claiming the
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:27.460]  fifth in an irs investigation they'll clap you in irons but the hussey up there can be
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:32.660]  caught lying last year taking the fifth does it again she doesn't get in trouble and the
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:37.060]  irs going to be enforcing some aspects of obama care and they are desperate to get out of
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.860]  obama care themselves they are lobbying like crazy to get out of obama care oh yeah the
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.180]  unions the government people and they're all going to be exempt oh it's for us it's for
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:48.580]  us alex i mean you know not for the ruler or something you don't build you know your
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:52.740]  electric fences around your bedroom if you're the farmer it's just for the cows horrible

[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:04.260]  sorry to hear that value i was a drywall contractor in colorado my entire livelihood
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:11.300]  and trade was awarded to a legal alien put out a business my home taken from the murals
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:16.340]  all the value of my property wiped away they almost force you with because again i'm not
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.500]  even against the illegals the point is you have them here they'll work for less their
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:23.740]  wives going welfare they then undermine the cost you're in the system the irs comes and
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:28.780]  takes you over you almost have to survive to just start acting like the illegals get
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:33.860]  a fake name pay nothing operate do whatever you want and and just sit there in jail when
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:37.300]  they arrest you for whatever they'll just let you out i mean you can really learn something
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:41.100]  from the illegals they're almost the total libertarians except they then siphon off the
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:45.420]  state what do you say about that stephan oh i mean american immigration policy since
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:49.580]  the 60s has been a disaster i mean in the 60s i mean then this is the case in in other
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:55.180]  countries like australia and so on they try to bring people in who are educated who are
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.940]  at least share some of the comic what sort of use of the west yeah i mean you can't
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:01.580]  just go and try emigrating to australia if you're coming from some third world country
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:05.020]  the democrats and again i don't want to sound like i'm pounding on the democrats like i'm
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:08.620]  no republican but the democrats they're the virulent cancer they are very much bringing
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.660]  in their voting base and their voting basis is underskilled people from third world countries
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:17.140]  this has been explicit in their platform since the 1960s i think it was said kennedy who first
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:21.220]  brought in this bill used to get 90% of immigrants from europe now get the majority of immigrants
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:24.940]  coming in from unskilled from third world and this drives down wages and then they say well
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:29.420]  now you see we need minimum wage laws to bring the wages back up and it's you know i'm i'm
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:33.060]  for open borders there's no such thing as you know an illegal anybody right but given
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:37.500]  this policy it's just a complete but yeah you could have open borders worldwide if there
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:42.340]  wasn't any welfare exactly but you have welfare and then let them vote to take my guns yeah
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:48.420]  i mean literally they can then vote to make me their slave yeah and it happens it is that's
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:53.300]  what democracy is two wolves vote that i'm a sheep i'm their dinner yeah and they want

[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:58.340]  the enemy has shown their hand we broke off of their sites bragging yesterday that they were
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:03.380]  about to get facebook to restrict discussion of the second amendment that article is bloomberg
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:09.220]  moves to ban pro gun speech facebook now working with the former new york mayor front groups to
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:15.540]  censor support for second amendment this just got released an hour ago it'll be going up on info
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:20.900]  wars dot com mom's demand action literally that's like three people in san antonio when we had thousands
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:25.460]  out there uh they try to start a fight with us on video we're gonna add that to the article
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:30.660]  this just was released march 5th that's today 2014 facebook's announced today that the company
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.980]  and its popular photo sharing subsidiary instagram will take significant steps remember they arrest
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:41.460]  kids that draw a picture of a gun at school to block potentially illegal firearms sales through
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:46.820]  their platforms now that's meant to sound reasonable for the first time the sites will delete
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:52.020]  reported post reported by them offering to buy or sell guns without background checks
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:58.100]  now people go well that sounds reasonable then you read deeper anyone with a profile under 18
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:03.700]  won't be able to see things about guns or read the word gun so they can have bots that block
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:08.020]  everything this already happened us we send out a pro gun meme with like hitler saying i love gun
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:12.660]  control you know and stuff like that or people about Benghazi the navy seal group they just block it
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:18.020]  yeah and this has been their plan all along and you read into the document it's page after page
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:23.540]  but it says facebook will continue to report the law enforcement blah blah blah facebook will
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:29.540]  take down reported pages of groups where guns are sold and now again these are groups gun shops and
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:34.580]  gun groups that then link to their gun shop guns not being sold there they send it to a gun shop
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:39.220]  make you buy it yeah but they create this illusion until the owner of the page acknowledges the page
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:44.100]  and includes the information prominently at the top of the page facebook's help center will remind
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:49.300]  sellers that they may conduct background checks for so it's all about you say you will comply with
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:55.940]  the laws they're the new arbiters of free speech online facebook will provide public education
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:01.140]  ad space targeted at users interested in firearm related content to ensure they know about the gun
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:06.660]  laws so now they'll be mayor bloomberg anti-gun literally brainwash the public as the attorney
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:11.060]  general said that famous quote i'm sure you've seen that targeted at people so they get free
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:16.740]  advertising now and it goes on it will block people from being able to see the gun sites so
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:23.620]  it gives them free advertising you name it these people always set themselves up
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:28.740]  like the adl southern prairie law center over law enforcement where they set all the policies
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:34.020]  they're god rachel maddow is gone well first of all i i can't imagine facebook is really enjoying
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:37.540]  this process you know they say they're working with the new york government or whatever and it's
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:41.460]  like that's like me working with a mugger for the orderly transfer of my wallet the fact that he
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:45.060]  has a gun to my ribs is pretty much the whole equation right i mean what the government can do
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:50.740]  to business is significant i know i know a lot of businesses use government to to get rent seeking
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:54.660]  to get comparative advantage and so on but if the government comes knocking and says we'd really
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:59.060]  like you to work with us well they are the guys with all the guns and we've been so compliant
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:03.540]  that's what's empowered the beast it's time to start not complying now but what's beautiful about
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.900]  this and we were just talking about this in the break that i think the government still thinks
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:10.100]  that they have a monopoly of information distribution like back in the day when there were
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:15.060]  like three networks and the government's basically controlled or or managed or had the license fees
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:20.260]  for all of these things right licensed through the FCC now i mean what a great way to educate
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:23.780]  kids about the second amendment because lord knows with teenagers like these people have
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:28.740]  never met a teenager you go to a teenager and say you're not allowed to see this and it's two clicks
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:32.980]  away on the internet what's the first thing that that stay out of the liquor cabinet yeah yeah yeah
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:37.060]  i mean i think the average age stop chasing cheerleaders the average age of kids getting
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:41.860]  porn these days is 10 to 11 years old when it's you know not legal until i don't know 18 or 19 or
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:46.100]  something like that right so it's a beautiful way to get kids interested in the second amendment to
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.620]  have facebook facebook stop locking stuff because now they're going to get educated about it well
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:55.780]  that's it they're putting in the same category as porn i mean it's it's it's mad and and it's it's
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:01.700]  wonderful how much work the government is doing on behalf of liberty advocates in helping the teenagers
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:06.580]  to understand the power of the state and helping them get interested in topics now taboo which is
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:11.140]  you know i mean that's like uh it's catnip for a teenager oh it's taboo the powers that be don't
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:15.940]  want me to see this here i'm going to go and find it right away i mean you couldn't advertise
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:21.060]  education well listen they did that i actually figured out was the reason i was successful
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:27.940]  one of the big maker to break it moments was i put out some documentaries about the military
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:32.100]  training for martial law which they they do perennially they do it all the time but
[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:37.060]  the military got to hold these documentaries police say 2000 others i was always somewhat
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:43.380]  successful and the marine corps and the army across the board said do not watch alex jones or
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:48.900]  listen to alex jones most of them didn't know who i was that's why today undoubtedly we are like the
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:54.020]  number one show in the us armed forces because they still say do not listen to him do not listen
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:14:01.220]  to ron paul do not do not get involved in the tea party it's making them all run to it what were
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:06.900]  they thinking i mean they're thinking they have control over the narrative the narrative is fragmented
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:13.380]  there used to be a soul control over the narrative right like when the the the catholic priests spoke
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:18.180]  the the liturgy in latin in the middle ages and the commoners didn't know latin and they couldn't
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:22.660]  get a hold of the bible and then martin luther comes along translates it into a language they
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:28.980]  can see and the monopoly of christendom it then fragments into you know swing aliens and anabaptists
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:34.260]  and and lutherans and all this kind of stuff and that creates more individual debate and discussion
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:39.300]  i think that the people in power now they grew up in like the 70s or the 80s or whatever
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:43.780]  and there was a monopoly of narrative back then now there's no monopoly on narrative they think
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:48.100]  that they can close this down and it's not going to it's not going to be like whack-a-mole for
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:54.340]  well that's like they'll have msnbc or others go alex jones has no listeners and is not important
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:59.060]  and it's not on am and fm stations and then people go look i'm on over a hundred and exist
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:03.060]  because he's not on on media controlled by the government but but the difference is i'm on over
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:08.420]  160 but we've been more successful in the free market internet the point is is that they lie
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:14.260]  incessantly yeah they lie incessantly and you're right they operate like they think they're in a
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:19.780]  vacuum you can lie if nobody can cross check you right but but people don't like i my website got
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:23.300]  banned in the armed services too and the number of military listeners to my show went through the
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:28.500]  roof oh that's what i'm telling you i get couldn't they know when they ordered the pentagon in like
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:34.660]  99 2008 i mean suddenly i had this giant audience and suddenly i was being given all this info that
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:39.220]  turned out to be accurate people leaking you know just basic stuff don't like secrets but what was
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:43.380]  going on because they didn't like the training they were being given to take on americans they
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:47.460]  heard a guy saying it was bad they knew i was telling the truth then they're told don't listen to
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:52.340]  this guy then they come in and say you're gonna get run or get pt duty if we find any more of
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:58.340]  these films here suddenly everyone was watching them yeah i mean i mean what was the system thinking
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:03.460]  it's the dilution of control the technology has by it's the strizand effect i'm sorry what now you
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:07.380]  know the the strizand effect where she kept threatening the sue bloggers don't say where i
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:11.220]  live don't talk about me so it brought all this attention to it made a thousand times bigger oh
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:17.540]  yeah yeah yeah okay but i'm saying literally that shows how screwed up these people are i mean i don't
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:24.020]  mean to keep marveling about it it's just that it's what you're saying is true well they inhabit the
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:29.620]  state which is an institution that is so ancient it's ridiculous it's just an outgrowth of warlords
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:33.940]  and and witch doctors from the stone age they inhabit the state which is retro and they have
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:40.900]  had so much monopoly control over the media that i think that they still don't quite grasp just how
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:46.900]  porous information has become and how i mean you know it's like you put a tiny pebble in a stream
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:50.740]  and you think you're damning the whole stream no everything just goes around it i mean there's no
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.820]  rock big enough to damn the flow me here's an example i learned early on with stalkers or people
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.300]  in the media that make stuff up who wanted attention smaller people than me making stuff up don't
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:03.780]  respond they go away you give them attention it gives them attention they do it more yeah
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:09.380]  yeah and i mean that's 101 i'm not that smart i know that how can the system not know that
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:15.380]  well remember they're also playing to an older audience i think younger people are much more
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:20.180]  open to a principled ideas of freedom than older people to some degree to some degree and i think
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:24.660]  what they're doing is they're playing to an audience that themselves do not understand how
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:28.660]  widely porous the flow of information has become so what they're saying the people are saying well
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:32.100]  we don't want our kids seeing these these second amendment things it's like well we just we talked
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:36.340]  to facebook and it's taken care of and people are like hey i'm over 50 that sounds plausible to me
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:39.940]  because you know when they weren't allowed to show it on tv they weren't allowed to show it on tv
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:44.100]  and nobody knew about it oh when it wasn't allowed yeah don't they get by by banning super bowl ads
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:48.580]  that are pro gun by by by arresting kids that draw a picture of a gun at school they only make it
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:53.140]  sexier because let me tell you with the liberal trendies the sexiest thing now is to go square
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:58.500]  dancing two-stepping by guns become a hillbilly we're actually winning with the young liberals
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:01.940]  they're waking up becoming libertarians yeah i don't know what's going to happen for the power
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:06.100]  structure because it's not going well well the other thing too is that i think people that the
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:10.420]  government control of the schools have become so complete so absolute at this started in the 60s
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:15.060]  when you could no longer fire teachers and it just became so absolute and i don't think people
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:19.940]  really remember or understand that when young people think of the state they think of the school
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:25.220]  and the experiences they have in the school are so uniformly negative these days i mean it was
[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:30.100]  pretty bad when i was that was horrible i was yeah but it's become even worse now like i mean
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:34.820]  in the 30 years since i was in high school i mean it's become exponentially worse like now as you
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:38.900]  know they're they're built by the same people who build prisons they're a mind control facility
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:44.660]  yeah it is it is a prison it is an actual prison that you're forced to go to and so i think the
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:49.380]  government is used to this patriotic blah blah blah but but teenagers now understand that it's
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:53.060]  the government that runs their lives as teenagers it's the government that makes them go to and
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:56.660]  they're rebelling against mommy and daddy now but the state is their mommy and daddy they're
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:00.500]  going to rebel against the state raised by the state they've been put in state institutions from
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:04.740]  about the age of three or four onwards and so when the state tells them stuff all the rebellion
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:08.980]  that used to go to mom and dad in the 50s is now going to the state what a beautiful situation to be
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:14.820]  and what a great fomenting wonderful lava pool we've got to inject some reason and passion into
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:18.740]  and to wake people up because for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction hey imagine
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:22.900]  if if this imagine if high school went on forever well welcome to the modern government you know
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.020]  if boy if that doesn't make you know i have a recurring nightmare that i still have where i'm
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:29.940]  back in high school i still do you still have that one where you didn't study for some tests

[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:32.180]  house of cards that i have not yet watched but everyone keeps telling me about so
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:39.460]  most propaganda is in movies and tv not in the news and i'm kind of blind because i only focus
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:44.820]  on news i should focus more on the propaganda in films but that discussion coming up in the next
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:49.940]  segment after calls fred in wisconsin you're a trooper for holding you're on the air worldwide go
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:56.660]  ahead hey alex um wanted to ask you and your guest uh you have an uncanny ability to predict the
[01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:03.780]  future based on the events going on right now and i see all these young young people california
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:08.580]  signing up for these medical marijuana cards and i see it spreading across the united states
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:16.100]  and i believe that if legalization happens if it really does come across that this is going to
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:22.340]  lead to gun confiscation later and that all these databases are being built because it's still
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:27.620]  against the federal law to have a gun and be under the influence of marijuana regardless of what
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:32.580]  the states say i think it's going to be a big problem and i didn't get my first gun until i was
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:40.420]  25 so i think it's just going to lead to a future gun confiscation problem especially if they lose
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:46.020]  all the money sure sure and i want to be clear about this whole gun issue the guns are important
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:50.500]  but the reason we obsess on it is when they come to try to take them it's because they're going to
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:55.860]  take the first amendment the fourth to tenth everything else which just symbolize rights
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:26:00.980]  that were already inalienable and already existed and the point is is that they go oh we're friends
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:05.940]  just let us register them and then they always confiscate them and so yes undoubtedly the plan
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:11.460]  is to take our guns but but as stefan said so they have the monopoly what's a bank robber
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:15.300]  doing he comes in he says hands up and he takes the gun away from the security guard yeah i mean
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:20.180]  that's what they're doing they're securing what they've hijacked what they've usurped and i at an
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:25.940]  instinctive level do not want to be usurped stefan you know that the system is about to crash when
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:31.380]  they try to grab the guns that is always what happens because when the system crashes the dependent
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:36.180]  classes get kind of angry where's the welfare check where's the social security check where
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:40.580]  my money's being inflated right out of my bank account i can't buy food i mean this is what
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:47.940]  happened in ukraine ukraine the average gdp per person or is like 35 or 100 or $4 000 compared
[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:52.660]  to poland which is 30 or 40 000 because they got such a corrupt regime the arab string was because
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:57.060]  the price of wheat went up three times they couldn't afford to eat so when you've got a dependent
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:27:02.260]  class which has been fostered for the last 30 years when you're about to run out of money you've
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:06.580]  got to grab those guns otherwise you could be facing some significance and i want to explain
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:12.500]  something it is massive centralization that allows runs on banks that allows starvation
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:18.740]  that allows deflation the inflate if you have a truly diverse free multi crop economy you have
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:24.660]  some problems but you just get richer and richer history shows the problem is ever getting to that
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:30.260]  point where you get government and regulators out of your hair and and have a virtuous society
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:34.660]  then it's like a perpetual motion machine but again then you become decadent it's the same
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:40.020]  cycle anything else caller i would just keep my name off that list as long as possible to see what
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:45.700]  they actually do but well yeah i mean folks you can get guns anywhere in the u.s without getting
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:50.500]  them through a registration system in most areas it's legal to buy from a private seller me i'm so
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:54.740]  prominent anyways i go buy guns in the background check why do i care i don't think i even have
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:58.660]  hardly any guns that i bought from friends or family and they could say anything's illegal to
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:02.980]  nitpicking it you know it's the cops show up and say you know you're have a gun illegally no i don't
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:07.860]  i don't have your you know your view that my gun's illegal as my grandpa gave it to me 30 years ago
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:13.700]  you know they can frame anything the way they want it to yeah and i would strongly suggest that
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:19.780]  it's a great barometer of an economic catastrophe when the escalation of gun grabbing goes on that's
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:22.980]  the time where you've got to stop thinking about whatever savings you got whatever finances you've
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:26.260]  got that's right they're going to take everything else when they go for the guys robert in mass
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:31.140]  you're on the air is the canary in the coal mine go ahead robert how you doing i'm good go ahead
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:36.020]  i just want to say you're doing a great job your true american patriot in the spirit of 76 was
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:41.780]  on thank you brother what's your question comment well my my question is about the first the irs

[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:22.020]  podcast with Stefan Malanu on his site that's supporting the free market of ideas when you pass
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:27.860]  on his podcast when you pass on our podcast when you tell friends and family about the different
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:32.580]  radio shows and books all of that is little individual actions we're not in some vacuum
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:37.540]  we're just the kleptocrats and people that think in gang mentality who aren't creative and gang up
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:44.100]  to rob us that are creative we're better than them when we take the field we our ideas win i've
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:48.340]  experienced it and they're a lot more articulate better folks than me out there just don't have
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:53.300]  confidence in themselves i've been on there 19 years from nowhere folks with free association
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:38:00.020]  we reach 3 million people that's a conservative number every day and we're growing and and
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:04.660]  freedom is popular and we can legalize freedom as ron paul says we can have a debate about what
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:10.100]  freedom is total anarchic capitalism like Stefan Malanu or me just saying hey i want my republic
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:15.060]  back it's better than me and run by foreign banks just don't blame the republic as they do for what
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:18.660]  our society's turned into now i'm going to go back to calls but if you want to comment on voting
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:25.300]  with our dollars i'd like to get that and then i've never heard such a buzz uh as about house of
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:29.060]  cards and people in the street going it's what you say about them and i don't know how it's on
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:34.180]  netflix but that shows the model of a netflix platform five years old dominating everything
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:38.900]  hundred million viewers a week that show alone i keep telling people don't try to go to hollywood
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:44.340]  to be successful go make your own film with passion yeah and and it'll pay for itself and the next
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:50.420]  film will make money but so many people just want to go make it and be rich with no passion and then
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:55.780]  there'll be a bling bling hip hop star or or there'll be a movie star not getting that the journey is
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:39:03.220]  the destination so house of cards with a 9.0 rating on imdb almost unheard of what is your
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:08.740]  take on this phenomenon well it's free market art it's art without a license because it's coming
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:13.460]  through netflix it's coming out there's no FCC there's nothing like that and i had a guy on talking
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:17.700]  about a good documentary called divorce corps about family courts and just how unbelievably
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:22.020]  predation and what predation they have particularly on the american male in the divorce situation
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:27.540]  and he was pointing out like no tv studio can accurately portray judicial corruption
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:32.500]  because networks are getting sued all the time and the last thing they want to do is piss off
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:35.940]  judges because they're gonna sit in front of some judge who's going to remember them and judge
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:40.740]  against them right so this is netflix streaming directly through the internet bypassing the
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:46.420]  FCC bypassing the regulators and so they can put out an honest to goodness portrayal of i think
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:50.340]  what politics looks like you compare this to something like the west wing which was there
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:55.300]  in sorkin's drama about democrats in the white house which was state humping demo porn from you
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:40:02.100]  know a couple of decades ago this is the true face of politics this is the backstabbing uh the the
[01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:08.180]  evil the monstrosity the hypocrisy uh i mean it's like othello where you had iago is the bad guy
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:12.900]  making othello into a bad guy but there's no good guy in this whole thing and it's the democrats
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:16.900]  because normally you get left wing writers if they have to portray bad people in politics they
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:23.620]  make them republicans but these are democrats and it is showing just how corrupt the system is how
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:30.580]  unsustainable the system is uh and it's not even backroom deals for the sake of any advancing agenda
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:34.180]  like it's not like they want to do good things and they have to regretfully do bad things to get
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:38.740]  those good things going they only pretend they want to do good things in order to advance their own
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:42.820]  personal power and agenda and i think that is an accurate view and i think it's going to really
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:49.220]  color and condition particularly young people's view of what it is to be in politics and what the
[01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:54.100]  government really looks like from the inside i think it's very powerful but you said it yourself
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:58.180]  because i talked to a lot of people that say man that this is really accurate and and by the way
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:04.420]  this is what you're saying about the government alex it it's a sign that the whole wall of
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:07.860]  hollywood control is imploding i was talking about this the last few months and i've had a lot of
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:12.900]  big hollywood people and rock stars contact me and and and say man you don't know how true what
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.740]  you're saying is when i'm out in hollywood i've been to a lot of big a-list parties and stuff
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:20.740]  back when i would even go do that because now i realize nothing ever really comes of it so why
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:24.340]  go out there because i used to go out there to be on big national tv shows and that doesn't really
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:29.060]  do anything so what's the point but i would go out there and people weren't liberal they weren't
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:34.180]  conservative they were libertarian they know the systems of fraud they want freedom for their kids
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:38.420]  they know gmo's bad they're liberal on some issues conservative on others those traditional
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:43.780]  issues they've all got guns uh even if they claim they're anti-gun because the studio won't put you
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:49.860]  on if you don't toe the line and the few people that would come on my show literally would get
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:53.700]  called in and told you're never going to work again if you don't stop that if you want to be
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:57.620]  part of a libertarian group you've got to be literally in a secret society in hollywood
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:01.940]  but the truth is because they haven't let them be libertarian or what they call conspiracy
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:07.700]  theorists people that question known liars the hottest thing for i don't know eight years
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:12.340]  it was about eight years ago i know that's where i'm getting invited out there a lot by a lot of
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:18.020]  people it was just a few folks that were willing to go on the show uh and i'm telling you across
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:23.860]  the board but some of them like brad pit or angeline jolly that i know woke up and saw my
[01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:28.020]  films and erin russo's i'll leave it at that and we're awake they got freaked out went and joined
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:34.340]  the un see some of them go okay it is all rigged i will literally go sell out to it sure or they
[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:39.060]  argue well i'll do more better you know inside the system but but what i'm saying is the whole
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:43.860]  facade of somner redstone and all these top lawyers and people that i've had meetings with
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:52.100]  literally is about keeping people on the plantation and mind control to keep hollywood under the fake
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:57.620]  liberal progressive authoritarianism the facade is already falling yeah and they're now figuring
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:02.980]  out they can go out and say and do what they want and i'm telling you house of cards i believe is
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:09.140]  then going to be seen as the dam breaking so i want to declare they're dead hollywood as the la
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:14.740]  mayor said a few months ago is quote in an emergency in his bankrupt and is in a crisis you bet it's
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:20.420]  over yeah it's over it's over for them and mainstream media is over the dinosaur media is over but
[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:25.860]  the next thing to fully implode i'm saying is hollywood and now they're finally desperate
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:32.820]  where man of steel is decentralized anti eugenics and movies like nut job or antigen to 21 now suddenly
[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:39.940]  or the lego movie is libertarian yeah suddenly though in their death throes they're allowing
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:44.180]  the directors i've talked to some of them to actually go go be pro-liberty and those are the
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:48.420]  only films that are making it now so instead of hollywood just collapsing they can either collapse
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:53.940]  or hollywood can make the decision to survive and join with liberty but they've now reached
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:57.780]  that tipping point what do you think's going to happen well they'll follow the dollar this is what
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:02.260]  you were saying with the when talking about the products that you sell you know everything you
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:07.300]  subsidize grows and everything you don't subsidize shrinks so i mean in terms of giving money to
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:12.740]  people right so whatever you subsidize is going to grow so yeah if people want libertarian messages
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:17.780]  then the people in hollywood will change to reflect that don't go and spend your money on stuff that
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:22.500]  promotes a demoral agenda it's very fundamental you know you've they've been wagging the dog here
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:26.900]  it's time for us to wag them you vote with the dollar i mean in house of cards i'm not going
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:32.580]  to give any spoilers so i'm panicking about that the rich guy says to the vice president you are
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:38.900]  about to make an enemy of a man with 40 billion dollars and he says what do i care about your money
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:45.540]  i have the guys with all the guns that is a very powerful statement to come out of mainstream
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:49.300]  media or at least this mainstream is just going to get that is an incredibly powerful statement
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:53.940]  to come out he's saying i have all the guns that's what government is it's not your protector it's
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:57.940]  not your savior it's not the salvation of the poor it's not the healer of the sick it's not
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:03.620]  jesus walking on water to bring you a donut it is the guys with all the guns and that's all it is
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:08.900]  that's all it's ever been and the fact that it actually has been said to the general public in
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:14.500]  one of the most popular shows to come out in the last year i have all the guys with the guns
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:20.340]  shocking i mean it's something i've been saying for like 30 years and now i can see it actually
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:24.580]  coming out of government's a gang with it with with with a flag they are the you know they're
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:28.420]  the they're the disorganized crime organized crime is the mafia government they're just the
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:32.980]  better criminals right like the guys who own the banks of the better bank robbers the the guys who
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:37.460]  run the government are the better organized criminals they just they won and they get to run
[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:41.940]  the show and the fact that it's actually being talked about and there is this complete it might
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:47.300]  as well be a mob movie and it's incredibly popular yes it is incredibly popular and even the name of
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:52.820]  it house of cards it's all about to come down and what a wonderful thing it has been to be right for
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:57.860]  30 years and have the credibility of accurately predicting catastrophe because it's really hard
[01:45:57.860 --> 01:46:01.780]  to argue with people who've been saying the non-obvious for 30 years who turn out to be completely
[01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:08.420]  right and i think that this uh there's no future in the universe of house of cards it is all just
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:13.380]  circling the drain grab as much as you can it's like indiana jones like when the the door is
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:16.980]  coming down you just grab whatever gold you can stuff in your pockets and try and get out
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:21.300]  the days are numbered and this is why the anti-gun stuff is so strong oh the elites are all running
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:26.260]  to armored redoubts in the middle of nowhere they're already running down the temple hallway with the
[01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:31.220]  big rock rolling towards them right and and they're telling us be calm though yeah yeah
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:34.740]  because they don't want us to run for the exits and block their exit bison government bonds it's a
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:40.340]  really great investment they have bonds in canada the 75 year bonds i mean does anyone seriously
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:44.980]  think that this system is going to be around in 75 years to pay off that principle it's it's mad
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:50.580]  but what does it say that i could produce something like loose change seen over 150 million times
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:56.740]  downloaded i mean i helped produce those uh what was the producer uh that i can make films i'm not
[01:46:56.740 --> 01:47:01.780]  bragging but but literally i've made films that have been seen 50 60 million times myself a piece
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:07.620]  just on youtube and google and i'm nobody imagine when that paradigm finally shifts and people
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:13.460]  realize they don't have to run to la try to go make their movies when everyone starts making
[01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:18.100]  them themselves and all that new talent gets turned list it's a new renaissance on every front
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:23.700]  i don't think the globalists can stop human progress unless one of their little experiments
[01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:29.380]  or the or a war they start ends up you know killing everybody i just hope that collectively
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:33.860]  through individual action we can block them from blowing the planet up well that's what we have
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:37.940]  to do i mean people ask me where does the future go the future goes where the most passionate and
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:41.620]  virtuous people tell it to go it's up to us it's up to the people i mean where does the future
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:44.660]  goes where i wanted to go it's where you wanted to go it's where these listeners wanted to go
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:49.780]  that's where the future goes and my experience was you know i struggled through um uh graduate
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:53.540]  school in canada heavily socialist country i did it's not like i couldn't master the material it
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:58.340]  was just really hard work trying to get free market voluntary principles to be accepted by
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:03.620]  academics up in canada and uh i tried to publish books i wrote books i've really got great reviews
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:08.340]  on the books nobody would publish them now i do i don't have your reach i got three to four million
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:12.580]  downloads a month of a philosophy show i mean this is unprecedented the fact that i can actually
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:17.060]  talk to people now top philosophers in the world can't get that but you go out in the free market
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:22.180]  boom you win it shows they can't pick the winners look at more and more they can't they're out of
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:27.460]  bullets look at how they try to make hillary like a movie star cnn msnb cc so beautiful she's so
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:31.380]  glamorous no wonder you're tanking like a lead balloon in the ratings trying to make michelle
[01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:37.460]  obama looks like a reanimated did snapping turtle uh you know how beautiful she is i mean it's
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:42.180]  literally a bunch of narcissistic criminals at least the old-fashioned kleptocrats you
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:46.900]  to stay quiet and shut up and just look stately they actually want to be on red carpets and put
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:52.340]  right around in front of us in some edward brunet's type deal it's not working no i think it's it's
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:56.020]  better if they don't talk so much you know it's like that really pretty but dumb girlfriend everyone
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:59.780]  has at one time in their life or another it's like i'll introduce you to my friends if you
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:03.540]  just smile and not talk too much that would be excellent well i mean i mean look it's one thing
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:07.540]  if you've scumbag you know rock and roll people or whatever want to show off of a bunch of women
[01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:11.700]  and in a jet and bling people kind of go oh that's rock stars yeah or that's hip hop people it's
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:17.540]  still cheesy but when the president and his whole camp followers are strutting around and red carpets
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:23.140]  and and i'm good at killing people and and look how sexy my wife is i mean it's delusion
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:28.660]  yeah i mean don't they know people don't want to look at you and a taxpayer paid red carpet
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:33.620]  and we're sick of you well but they live in the bubble of privilege right they live in the bubble
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:37.940]  i can't picture what it's like to be on the other side of the gun because you know my whole life
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:42.340]  with i as a kid doesn't you know and go to school or you pay your taxes obey the law you sit this
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:46.260]  side of the gun gun pointing straight at you right barrel straight at you i can't even imagine
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:50.260]  what it must be like i was to be on the other side of that gun in other words people have to
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:54.260]  watch your show people have to give you money people have to do what you say like i can't
[01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:59.460]  imagine but it must that would be like a woman having sex with me who didn't want to yeah that's
[01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:04.580]  horrible i mean i we have some compassion some empathy and all well no i mean the point is i
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:10.020]  want her to be passionate and like me like i want them out of free association the government is
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:14.020]  raping us they want to go they want to rape us but they want to go back into power this is what
[01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:19.060]  it like for me no i know but i'm saying they want to make us oh i know it's it's rape it's rape but
[01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:23.060]  that's because they know they have nothing of value to add but their vanity can't accept that so
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:28.420]  they have to force it on us for me being in power be like take a wild ferret and up and an aquarium
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:33.140]  and put it in that wild ferret that ferret's going to be like ah gotta get out i mean you put me in
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:37.380]  power for a day i'm cloying to get out these people work night and day for years to get back
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:41.540]  into power i mean it's like they're a completely different species and then you study how they
[01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:47.060]  live they're actually prisoners in some ways yeah yeah no because the bureaucracy is the real power

[01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:09.620]  even looked to see what it was now i hear you they declare the fifth when they're committing crimes but
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:13.700]  then they don't let us declare the fifth in irish forms and that's all i could say and then in the
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:17.700]  next thing everyone's saying they want to take your guns i don't believe they want to take your
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:22.660]  guns at all not for one minute well they're trying to confiscate them everywhere they get control they
[01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:29.460]  do no i believe that's a ruse i believe they don't want to take your guns they want you to use your
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:37.780]  guns and then they can blame the economic collapse on you well when there is a large economic collapse
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:42.420]  it'll be guns that maintain order like in the la riots from the cops left so i hear you and i

[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:15.140]  gonna i mean then that then they should outlaw all these shoot them up games then oh no no they're
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:19.700]  allowed to have shoot them up games uh violently on the super bowl but a pro gun thing about men
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:23.140]  protecting their household that doesn't even show a gun that's banned on the super bowl
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:30.020]  well yeah exactly i i don't get their thinking i really don't get their thinking i hear you brother

[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:10.660]  want to touch base you started off this segment about the gun ban in canada it's the swiss style
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:15.700]  classic green and what it is the rcmp have just banded it without going through uh the proper
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:19.300]  channels and whatnot now what i've done is i started the youtube channel and i've started
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:24.260]  speaking out against it this morning i called the head office for the firearms registry here in
[01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:30.820]  canada and i i videotape to the uh the encounter i uh and i put it on youtube and i told them i was
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:35.540]  very nice to her you know ask my questions which she couldn't answer any of them and i was just
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:39.620]  basically said okay thanks very much just so you know i'm going to put this on youtube and have a
[01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:44.820]  nice day my phone rang 20 minutes later she called and she said have you put that on youtube yet
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:48.900]  and it was slow to load and it was in the process and i just said yeah i put it on youtube and she
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.340]  said well you're gonna have to take that down because you didn't have my permission at that point i
[01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:56.980]  informed her that she's a public servant and then i do not need her permission so i encourage all
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:58:02.020]  canadian to call the registry office and uh and voice their concerns absolutely no i've been following
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:06.340]  this in canada where they're lawlessly just reclassifying guns and that they've registered
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:09.940]  and confiscating them and this is happening everywhere uh stefan this is really getting
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:13.780]  serious well you know and this is the example of what we've been talking about different rules for
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:18.340]  them than for you you see they can bypass legal procedures to take your guns but if you take
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:22.660]  a call without that permission that's wrong because you don't have their pay even though if you

[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:09.380]  but they're operating like that now i saw a time magazine cover the other day that had the
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:17.220]  capital on it when it said majority rule and was x'd out and was saying the majority in a fake
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:22.820]  poll want to ban guns but we can't do it the majority when obama care was an old magazine
[02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:26.980]  but we can't do it the majority want to have their heads chopped off we can't do it
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:35.540]  there's a new article out at info wars dot com poll 71 percent wish they'd not voted for obama
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:42.020]  even 55 percent of democrats say they regret reelecting the president too late suckers
[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:47.780]  and it doesn't mean romney would have been even better the fix was in that's the point
[02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:50.900]  matt drudge tweets report warning about suicide of the g.o.p
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:57.620]  and then that's got shaftley's report uh reposted uh in it

[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:23.380]  doing great talking to you big hey um i'm calling about something that i heard another caller say
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:29.060]  earlier so woke up this morning and i was just really thinking um you know how for the last few
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:34.500]  months you've been feeling in your gut that there's a false flag and uh coming up and i just was
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:41.700]  thinking um i thought a really cool um on youtube a do it geoengineering uh scientists has got a
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:47.860]  video out i really think that that might be what they're up to in california um because it just
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:52.980]  there's not enough evidence and they're getting smarter because too many people out there are
[02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:58.500]  kind of pointing out their false flags and it just seems like that's um something that um maybe
[02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:02.580]  you can blow the lid off of you know with well sure here's the problem and i'm not criticizing
[02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:07.700]  anybody everybody uses the layman provincial term chemtrails that we started hearing about in the
[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:15.140]  early 90s and there's a patent and the guy wanting 92 want to forget the scientist name uh a un science
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:20.180]  prize for developing quote sunscreen for the earth kids textbooks teach that they're already spraying
[02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:25.060]  it to save us from global warming but the details are all classified it's added to jet fuel under
[02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:30.100]  four patents so the pilots don't even know what's going on it's aerosolized barium salts limit oxide
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:36.340]  others there's a five billion dollar a year energy department of energy program and they do seem to be
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:41.940]  concentrating out on the west coast with all that moisture coming in manipulating and stopping it
[02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:45.540]  and they've got aircraft out there spraying and we know what's going on and they've had
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:51.940]  even people from the california department of uh environment you know go out there and and go yeah
[02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:55.780]  we're getting like 20 times the aluminum we're getting them barium salts the trees are dying
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:04:01.540]  so i don't know what's going on because the program's secret but it's bad and it's weather
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:08.180]  modification you name it and i mean the globalist will pay to ship general motors to china will pay
[02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:14.420]  to ship jeep to italy they'll they'll they'll they'll pay to shut down your local power plant
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:22.580]  i mean they are shutting america down except for select globalists who are exempt and it's it's
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:27.060]  it's just a serious situation i hear you so we do need to look at the california drought isn't a
[02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:31.620]  chem drill operation and look at the geoengineering program and admit it's going on and show that it
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:36.420]  manipulates weather uh and and do a report for the nightly news or something on that i agree with

[02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:37.860]  we appreciate her coming back on today with one of the most serious issues of this republic
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:43.620]  and quite frankly the future of the world itself and she of course is a best-selling
[02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:47.860]  author and she became the the leader of the conservative movement with the publication
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:53.940]  of her best-selling book in 64 a choice not an echo and i'm not going to go over all the things
[02:08:53.940 --> 02:09:00.420]  she's done in her 47 year this is an old bio battle it's more than that now and she has
[02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:06.660]  testified before more than 50 congressional state legislative committees she was appointed by
[02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:14.340]  um president uh reagan for a member of the bicentennial commission and she promotes all
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:21.300]  things americana and they've gone out and indexed the poll numbers and showed what i what i and many
[02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:26.500]  of you already knew but it's good to document it but the vast majority between 75 and 90
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:33.060]  depending on the poll of illegals and even immigrants period tend to vote democratic
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:39.220]  anti-gun anti-family you name it and even though it's not in their interest they they they want
[02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:44.900]  to be plying and they just vote straight ticket and i've got big criticisms of the republican
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:51.620]  leadership they've been supporting this amnesty with the republican big donors um because they're
[02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:56.100]  part of this globalist agenda but all over the world they've gotten rid of borders partially
[02:09:56.100 --> 02:10:00.340]  and they've just europe's going bankrupt they use the immigrant populations to become the new
[02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:05.780]  bureaucratic enforcement arm uh i've had members of the uh EU parliament on members of the UK
[02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:12.260]  parliament even liberal members on talking about this situation and if you can get a group to come
[02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:19.940]  in who can then vote to get welfare in exchange for voting for parties that will take guns and
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:24.820]  it will take liberty and take sovereignty you have been conquered you have been conquered
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:30.580]  demographically uh i'll be honest if we had 30 million illegals here and they were green skinned
[02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:35.780]  uh not predominantly you know light brown skin from latin america and they were voting for the
[02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:40.980]  second amendment national sovereignty freedom worn on welfare it's a lot of people but we've
[02:10:40.980 --> 02:10:46.900]  aborted 50 plus million americans maybe we need them since rovey wait the problem is the ideology
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:51.540]  is pure poison and if you haven't traveled latin america i suggest you go travel it it's a nightmare
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:57.540]  i'd love to export freedom down there instead we're exporting the poverty the crime up here in
[02:10:57.540 --> 02:11:03.060]  mexico's afel state and this idea that we are somehow hateful and criminal and we already
[02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:06.500]  have the most open policies in the world if we don't just throw our doors up and say have your
[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:11.620]  babies here free all the welfare and we won't wear american flags at school we'll take down american
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:20.020]  flags uh we won't dress as cowboys or natives uh at uh you know college parties on halloween
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:24.580]  i mean it's a joke oh you criticize obama it's because you're racist no it's because obama
[02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:30.340]  cares a scam so i want to give phyllis shaffley the the the floor here i've said my piece to break
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:35.860]  down her tip of the spear coverage that's been on drudgereport.com from the phyllis shaffley report
[02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:43.540]  at eagleforum.org you can also go to phyllis shaffley.com and she joins us right now to
[02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:48.740]  break this down because obama is already i want to cover what's going to happen if they do this
[02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:54.180]  but then obama is already legalizing mostly illegals by fiat so the republican leadership
[02:11:54.180 --> 02:11:59.460]  a is being beaten on getting amnesty because it is suicide for the country but b they have to be
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:04.900]  beaten on letting obama act as an executive dictator doesn't mean he's a dictator fully
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:10.180]  the office is becoming dictatorial so um mrs phyllis shaffley thank you so much for coming on
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:16.100]  you've got the floor give us this report worldwide that people are tuning in to hear right now well
[02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:22.660]  hi alex i'm happy to join you and you laid it out very well these people who want to bring in
[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:29.460]  millions of people uh they're going to vote democratic and we know this not because it's my
[02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:34.500]  opinion or because i've talked to them it's because all of these recognized pollsters
[02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:41.780]  have reached a consensus on this and there's no dispute in it these these pollsters all say
[02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:47.780]  uh that the ones coming in the big majority of them are people who believe in big government
[02:12:47.780 --> 02:12:54.260]  offering more services than limited government balance budgets and that sort of thing and you
[02:12:54.260 --> 02:13:00.180]  know the conservative movement and the republican party are built on restraint in government limited
[02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:07.860]  government and the millions of new people are bringing in are not bad at all they have no
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:12.980]  experience with it they don't think they like it they're glad to come here and accept the welfare
[02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:19.780]  of goodies that our government hands out and you've got seven plus billion people that would like
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:24.900]  to come here and under globalism there's no sovereignty no borders that sounds like they
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:30.340]  want to make us the new calcutta well i think it was ron reagan who said uh country without
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:37.220]  without borders is not a country you you've got to have borders and uh we expect people to
[02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:43.700]  respect them and if people want to come to this country they ought to obey our laws and uh these
[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:49.380]  pollsters for example uh they they've taken a poll on uh whether you whether you want the
[02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:55.140]  children in the public school to to be taught that america is a great country and of course the big
[02:13:55.140 --> 02:14:01.380]  majority of americans don't think that uh but the uh the recent immigrants even if they're
[02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:09.380]  naturalized uh not even the majority believe that and uh they ask them well are you for obama care
[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:16.900]  well yes they are a majority for obama care and uh it's no wonder why is anybody surprised that
[02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:24.420]  they vote for the democrats that that's the way it is you know i know a lot of democrats and and
[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:28.820]  finally some of them are waking up that obama care was a premeditated fraud in a scam to select
[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:35.300]  interest uh a literal looting but if so many democrats should say i don't care we're going
[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:39.540]  to wreck the whole system and then i'm going to get something free i mean i mean they don't even
[02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:44.100]  care if they're getting screwed over as long as they feel like they're part of some winning team
[02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:48.980]  i mean i've got to say it democrats on msnbc live talk about how smart they are all day i don't
[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:52.820]  know if you've seen mark dice's videos where he goes out and talks to democrats in california
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:58.340]  and they say the most authoritarian things they don't know that the earth orbits the sun the
[02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:05.620]  average democrat has got to be the stupidest person on the planet well maybe they think they're
[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:13.700]  smart because they've learned how to get free money and uh the uh these polls are are really
[02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:21.700]  very very revealing and they these people who are coming in uh our people have no experience
[02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:27.460]  with our type of government you've heard people say that we are an exceptional country uh that
[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:34.260]  word isn't even strong enough america is unique there's no other country that is built on the idea
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:39.460]  of limited government as thomas jeverson said bind them down from mischief with the chains of the
[02:15:39.460 --> 02:15:45.540]  constitution and we think they ought to keep their spending down and keep taxes low and so forth
[02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:51.540]  and other countries don't don't even understand that they they depend on the government for uh
[02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:57.860]  uh practically to walk across the street whether they can or not and uh they they don't know what
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:04.580]  we're talking about but we say we want a smaller government doing less and so we can bring in the
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:11.380]  people who want the government running things who want the government to doing handouts uh
[02:16:11.380 --> 02:16:18.500]  you're going to get more democratic votes why are you surprised well you're certainly right and america
[02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:25.860]  was hyper unique hyper exceptional by every metric of inventions trailblazing military activity
[02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:32.980]  just on every front literature art we have been the flower of the renaissance in the last uh 230
[02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:39.380]  plus years and now we see all the prosperity going out the window as we follow the globalist
[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:46.900]  collectivist program that always creates rack and ruin well all of these trade agreements uh
[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:51.540]  which are presented the name of globalism and getting along in the world and free trade and
[02:16:51.540 --> 02:16:58.100]  all those slogans uh they create jobs and investment in other countries they don't
[02:16:58.100 --> 02:17:05.300]  create them in this country we lose jobs and and uh it's a it's a real betrayal this is why the
[02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:12.900]  middle class has been shrinking every year under the obama administration and uh so uh
[02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:20.660]  um it's just this new report that i have out it's a 48 a 40 page report it's available on my website
[02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:28.020]  eagleform.org and just to give you another example one poll found that 81 percent of
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:35.060]  native born americans uh believe our schools should teach that students should be proud to be
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:41.380]  america but only 50 percent only half of the emigrants even after their naturalized believe
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:49.860]  that and you know these uh these amnesty advocates like to compare our current immigration with what
[02:17:49.860 --> 02:17:57.060]  we were bringing in around 1920 and the people who came in from western europe in 1920 uh all wanted
[02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:04.020]  to be uh real americans i i have any number of friends who told me when they came as a teenager
[02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:09.860]  and landed at ellis island in new york their mother or father would say now we're in america
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:14.420]  we're going to be americans and we're going to speak english and this is our country now
[02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:20.820]  and that's not the way they feel about it today uh the ones who are coming in seem to
[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:26.020]  maintain their allegiance to their own their own their own country and when you take the oath of
[02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:32.180]  citizenship you're supposed to renounce all allegiance to any king potentate foreign government
[02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:37.460]  of any kind and i don't know whether they recite all that but it's obvious they don't believe it
[02:18:37.460 --> 02:18:45.300]  because the polls all show that uh they're not proud to be an american and uh they uh really
[02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:52.260]  don't believe in the type of government of limited government that made our country uh the most
[02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:57.540]  prosperous and the freest country on the face of the earth that's right you can't argue with the cold
[02:18:57.540 --> 02:19:04.260]  hard scientific sociological geopolitical facts um i want to go to break here and come back and get
[02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:09.220]  into some more of the poll numbers that are on the site of everybody that wants to go check them

[02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:27.780]  selling books we're gonna talk about her newest bestseller where obama is waging war on the first
[02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:32.420]  amendment and not just the others our religious freedom is within the first amendment where i
[02:24:32.420 --> 02:24:36.660]  talked to her about that in the next segment the short one though phyllis please because you're
[02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:41.380]  pausing and letting me jump in i want you to roll here because you've got all the deep data and the
[02:24:41.380 --> 02:24:47.060]  research break down what it means if they get this next crop of illegals legalized obviously
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:53.780]  then the next group the next we're in total checkmate politically because because these folks are
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:59.620]  voting in a collectivist manner and i've tried to reach out to the quote immigrant population
[02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:04.420]  with some success but we just can't reach enough of them a is there any way to turn this around
[02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:09.700]  b how do we beat it and what's going on in washington good effort to talk radio because the mainstream
[02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:17.860]  media is is concealing the whole thing and they're two powerful lobbying groups that are pushing for
[02:25:17.860 --> 02:25:25.620]  more more illegal and legal immigration and they are the big business crowd who want cheap labor
[02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:30.660]  and then of course the democrats who want to vote and my report which is now available on
[02:25:30.660 --> 02:25:39.700]  evilform.org it's 40 pages there's a lot of statistical stuff if you want the abbreviated
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:45.460]  every man's version you can ask for my phyllis schlafly report called does the republican party
[02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:52.660]  have a future but at any event what these polls consistently show is that three fours of his
[02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:58.660]  panics coming in want a bigger government providing more services i'm talking about services
[02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:06.820]  like healthcare obama care and only a tiny percentage uh even understand or want a smaller
[02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:14.020]  government and you know that if uh if we want to leave a country of freedom and prosperity to
[02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:19.860]  our children and grandchildren we've got to cut down the size of government stop these executive
[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:26.740]  actions that obama is taking on his own which he is doing unilaterally and says he can do whatever
[02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:35.140]  he wants with his fan and uh have to realize that these people coming in uh the overwhelming majority
[02:26:35.140 --> 02:26:41.940]  of them want the government providing big services and which is of course very costly in every way
[02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:52.180]  expanding on that look at what a monumental fraud and a deception obama care is everything
[02:26:52.180 --> 02:26:58.260]  that's being pushed is really bad for the overall population bad for common sense bad for fairness
[02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:05.620]  but still people that are part of the democratic party cult uh just don't care they just think
[02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:11.620]  they've won and then you've got the people like bainer and others that uh are bought off by the
[02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:17.140]  same interest i mean what do we do about this well the facts are so overwhelming for example the
[02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:22.980]  congressional budget office which certainly is not a right wing source said that obama care is going
[02:27:22.980 --> 02:27:32.340]  to cost us uh over two million jobs and uh mostly by companies reducing the number of hours that
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:38.980]  their employees can work and the obama administration tried to put a happy face on this by saying oh
[02:27:38.980 --> 02:27:44.100]  that's great people will have more free time they'll be able to do more fun things that they want to
[02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:49.620]  do when they're not working well that's not the way you get ahead and that's not the way you support
[02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:57.860]  your family uh we believe in in work and full-time work and we hope guys will have a good job full
[02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:03.620]  time it's going to be able to support his family but that isn't what obama wants he wants to cut
[02:28:03.620 --> 02:28:07.940]  the amount of work people are doing so they're working less hours getting less money and then
[02:28:07.940 --> 02:28:17.300]  they're have their insurance paid for by the taxpayers it's also rotten alex i uh and and the
[02:28:17.300 --> 02:28:24.180]  high-handed dictatorial way that obama is doing it it's amazing but these polls are very compelling
[02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:30.900]  in showing uh what the people think about this and and they're not voting for amnesty they're
[02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:36.740]  voting for handouts by the government and they get that by voting democratic and then they'll
[02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:43.700]  support literally making those of us that produce their slaves and then george soros and warren
[02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:51.780]  buffett big constituents of the democrats and big um recipients of of corporate welfare
[02:28:52.740 --> 02:28:57.700]  and they and then they write the laws to be exempt from the taxes their lobbying to raise taxes on
[02:28:57.700 --> 02:29:03.620]  the middle class this takes us back to a democracy where two wolves can vote to eat the sheet for dinner
[02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:13.780]  you know you know that'd be a joke but weren't so really tragic uh the way they uh the way
[02:29:13.780 --> 02:29:20.260]  are manipulating the people and making them think that the government is the the source of goodness
[02:29:20.260 --> 02:29:27.140]  and money and and the number of people who are now on food stamps uh the number of people who get
[02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:34.740]  housing supplement the e itc the earned income tax credit that just gives you a bigger tax free

[02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:24.820]  oh they doled up obama care they said there weren't any death panels it didn't ration
[02:33:24.820 --> 02:33:30.660]  care didn't kick pre-existing condition folks off you could keep your doctor firm pledge
[02:33:32.100 --> 02:33:36.820]  it would lower your premium to the cost of a phone bill or cable bill i don't know maybe for a whole
[02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:43.540]  hotel and mine has doubled in the last since it went in six months ago herola revero was on the
[02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:51.540]  show a few months ago his has tripled and for that of all of his six employees tripled uh and my
[02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:59.460]  dad's is more than doubled and everyone i know it's at least doubled because some some it's only
[02:33:59.460 --> 02:34:04.580]  gone up 45 50 60 percent but most people it's more than doubled so if you average it it's about a
[02:34:04.580 --> 02:34:10.100]  doubling to be technical and that's just year one i mean this is just going to get better and better
[02:34:10.100 --> 02:34:15.380]  and the reason i raise that is they said hey if you don't like obama care you're racist
[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:21.380]  on msnbc and cnn and there are no death panels and none of this is true we we had
[02:34:21.380 --> 02:34:27.620]  the bill and now obama acts as a dictator implementing what he wants where he wants
[02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:32.500]  oh unions you're exempt but not families that's the ultimate form of discrimination
[02:34:33.700 --> 02:34:36.820]  while they're talking about discrimination we don't like it because he's black
[02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:40.980]  let me tell you i'd vote for a black man in about half a second if he was like ron paul
[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:47.220]  i could care without love it it'd be even better because then they couldn't attack him as much but
[02:34:47.220 --> 02:34:52.340]  but they would though they it wouldn't work if they were libertarian or conservative it is so
[02:34:52.340 --> 02:34:58.580]  disgusting when obama said two weeks ago uh in a time magazine interview and was in the new yorker
[02:34:58.580 --> 02:35:05.940]  similar things that well my poll numbers are down because of racism what what and i i'm ranting
[02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:11.380]  we got phyllis shaftley with us of eagle forum dot org and amizah shaftley is is like one of the
[02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:16.100]  icons of true conservatism in this country best-selling author constitutional lawyer
[02:35:16.100 --> 02:35:21.780]  you're getting into amnesty how do we beat it where is it but then we go to the next problem as
[02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:26.340]  you know you're you're best-selling books out about it doesn't matter obama is just legalizing
[02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:31.380]  a bunch of the illegals ordering the courts to let people go in the in the amnesty courts
[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:36.500]  he's just doing it by executive fiat to begin with so where's the republican leadership beginning
[02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:43.700]  impeachment of the president turning the office into a dictatorship well i hope you saw him on
[02:35:43.700 --> 02:35:48.980]  your your television screen what he said he had a pan has a pan and he can do whatever he wants to
[02:35:48.980 --> 02:35:57.300]  do and a telephone and it is and uh it was so arrogant it was so condescending to americans
[02:35:57.300 --> 02:36:02.740]  it was embarrassing if we think we're self governing people and he has changed his own law
[02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:10.660]  obama care i think personally unilaterally about 30 times and uh it and he just wants to do whatever
[02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:16.980]  he wants to uh to uh get the democrats reelected and i think the only way we can save our country
[02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:24.740]  is to elect a majority of conservatives to the u.s uh senate in november and get the right guys
[02:36:24.740 --> 02:36:31.860]  dominated in the primary and it it it is so important because for example if obama gets
[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:36.980]  another appointment to the supreme court uh he would rule the country with his bloody ideas for
[02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:43.780]  the next 50 years and and we cannot afford that we need to have enough senators to stand up and
[02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:48.980]  say we're not going to give you many more judges because some of these i call them supremacist
[02:36:48.980 --> 02:36:58.020]  judges uh are as bad as the obama in trying to remake the law and dictate to the american people
[02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:03.780]  you you've been fighting this journey for 60 plus years as a constitutional lawyer but
[02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:10.500]  i studied political elites i studied history even if you were a corrupt elite america and
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:17.300]  prosperity is incredibly profitable you would rather skim off the top of that big large yes
[02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:23.700]  then destroy it and debase it all so you can run it but tyrants always debilitate everything
[02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:29.780]  because they hate individual freedom and they jealously want to shut it down thus destroying
[02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:34.820]  the engine of their own success but i i want to warn the political elite including the democrats
[02:37:35.620 --> 02:37:40.980]  you are literally burning down your own house you guys run the country now and you have such a
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:49.380]  long-term hatred of men and of families and of women and of prosperity and of just uprightness
[02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:53.540]  i mean i've i've really studied these people and now i've come around to the understanding that
[02:37:53.540 --> 02:37:58.980]  they really do want to screw stuff up they really are like michael savage said i think
[02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:03.460]  mentally ill uh if you disagree with that tell me uh fellas but i mean you've been fighting
[02:38:03.460 --> 02:38:10.340]  these people for a long time what is wrong with them well they want power and they think the way
[02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:17.860]  they would get power is to make the america american workforce be in competition with the
[02:38:17.860 --> 02:38:22.980]  people in the rest of the world you know a lot of our products are starting to come from vietnam
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:28.420]  uh where they work for 28 cents an hour and i do not think americans should have to be in
[02:38:28.420 --> 02:38:35.220]  competition with people like that we have clearly a better system a unique system a prosperous system
[02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:41.620]  a successful system that's why everybody wants to come here and uh we should let in only people
[02:38:41.620 --> 02:38:47.780]  who like our country obey our laws like switzerland i mean i mean you could have 10 million dollars
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:53.300]  they won't let you in unless you have a skill you're bringing uh switzerland their money only
[02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:58.180]  goes up in the value their crime only goes down they get better and better and better why don't
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:39:02.900]  we do what switzerland did that's right and they just voted down this increased immigration
[02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:10.340]  and that's why they've been able to keep a a free and prosperous country and we should do the same
[02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:19.140]  but the trouble is the the media is so so much in favor of obama no matter what he did they they
[02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:26.500]  try to ruin anybody who criticizes him but americans have got to speak up we have a great
[02:39:26.500 --> 02:39:33.540]  country we need to not let anybody in except somebody who wants to honor our country our flag
[02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:40.180]  our constitution and we don't and you know the polls are showing alex that the majority of these
[02:39:40.180 --> 02:39:46.020]  people coming in the international law should top our constitution you got to be kidding
[02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:52.420]  we're not you and i are not going to let international law trump our constitution
[02:39:53.620 --> 02:40:00.260]  that's right and you have all the polls listed uh there from uh the pew research you name it there's
[02:40:00.260 --> 02:40:04.980]  a whole yes all the ones that everybody else quotes only they don't seem to quote the part
[02:40:04.980 --> 02:40:11.540]  about uh what they believe on amnesty but all the polls are consistent in saying that the
[02:40:11.540 --> 02:40:18.100]  overwhelming majority of people coming in uh want bigger government handing out more services it's
[02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:23.860]  basically like a beautiful ship that's not perfect but the best out there and you've always envied
[02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:28.820]  it and you finally get on board and then the democrats hand hand you a dynamite to put in the
[02:40:28.820 --> 02:40:34.180]  bottom of the ship to sink it and then you dynamite the ship and you're sinking you're like i won i
[02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:42.340]  brought down america instead of just joining with america there is a real hatred of this country and
[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:48.820]  i'm sick of it there is a hatred of this country and there's a hatred of the institution of marriage
[02:40:48.820 --> 02:40:55.140]  too uh which i hope i have a new book out on yeah let's segue into that let's segue to the attack
[02:40:55.140 --> 02:41:03.380]  on religion the attack on marriage obama's book is uh uh no higher power obama's war on religious
[02:41:03.380 --> 02:41:08.820]  freedom and you can see that everywhere the people who want to be politically correct uh even the
[02:41:08.820 --> 02:41:14.580]  military has done some things like clamping down on on prayers and the and the oath to serve god
[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:21.380]  and country so help me god and and the superintendents of the of the public schools are well they're
[02:41:21.380 --> 02:41:26.740]  going after little kids won't let them mention jesus they're singing a christmas carol or bring
[02:41:26.740 --> 02:41:31.700]  a christmas card even though everybody else is allowed to do whatever they want yeah and uh it's
[02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:38.100]  a real war on the first amendment obama's idea about the first amendment is you should have the
[02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:43.700]  right to go into your church and lock the door and say a prayer where nobody can hear you and that'll
[02:41:43.700 --> 02:41:49.460]  be okay he's not going to take that away from by the way for those that don't know um the first
[02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:54.260]  amendment says congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the
[02:41:54.260 --> 02:42:00.180]  free exercise thereof it means you don't have a state-run religion but you could absolutely come
[02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:06.180]  to school and you can hand out christmas cards you can hand out muslim material during the lunch
[02:42:06.180 --> 02:42:11.860]  break you can hand out atheist material as a valoviktorian you can give whatever speech you
[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:17.860]  want and thank god as a football player you can and they know that and they are persecuting people
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:24.500]  where they find bibles in people's bags in in public school in texas and quote throw them in the
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:30.900]  trash and suspend them this is outrageous authoritarianism and of course the founding
[02:42:30.900 --> 02:42:37.700]  fathers and all presidents prior to obama were quoting their faith and their belief in god all
[02:42:37.700 --> 02:42:43.700]  the time honoring the national day of prayer uh for example when uh obama gives a thanksgiving
[02:42:43.700 --> 02:42:49.780]  day address he makes a whole long list of people to thank but god didn't make the god and he's just
[02:42:49.780 --> 02:42:56.500]  trying to eliminate any public mention of god and our country was built on people believing
[02:42:56.500 --> 02:43:02.580]  in god and being religious people and people of faith why is it that the collectivist and soviet
[02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:08.500]  types hate god is it because obviously the state is god and they don't want any higher power above
[02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:16.260]  them you know that's right they want the state to be in control of everything and we don't and
[02:43:16.260 --> 02:43:23.940]  we've got a proven best country and that's why people want to come here and and it's uh it's
[02:43:23.940 --> 02:43:30.180]  the most freedom it's the most prosperity and obama has a nutty idea that it really isn't fair
[02:43:30.180 --> 02:43:38.340]  that the united states has so much good things of life and and uh more prosperity than any
[02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:43.300]  other country and more power than other countries and he wants to make everybody equal and we don't
[02:43:43.300 --> 02:43:49.460]  want to be equal to all the poor countries and we don't want our guys to have to compete with people
[02:43:49.460 --> 02:43:54.420]  making the products in vietnam and work for 28 cents an hour well it's not fair trade when we
[02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:58.020]  have all the regulations and bureaucracy and shutting down our power plants and they go to
[02:43:58.020 --> 02:44:02.900]  vietnam with no regulations dubbing the toxic waste right in the river and this is all about
[02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:08.180]  cloward and piven making us dependent in closing spend a few minutes on the attack on the family
[02:44:08.180 --> 02:44:15.780]  it's so naked now the attack on women the attack on manhood i mean the msnbc i'm sure you've seen
[02:44:15.780 --> 02:44:21.060]  their promo where they say your kids now belong to the state i mean these people are really being
[02:44:21.060 --> 02:44:28.180]  naked about them their takeover why do you think that is oh well they're feeling that they've won
[02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:36.180]  and they want to want to do socket to us and the only way we can remain a free country is if parents
[02:44:36.180 --> 02:44:43.860]  are controlled their children not the government and if if we were able to elect a congressman
[02:44:43.860 --> 02:44:49.940]  and representative who believe in limited government lower taxes and letting people spend
[02:44:49.940 --> 02:44:56.580]  their own money and set up a government spending it and these are the issues that are so important
[02:44:56.580 --> 02:45:03.860]  the upcoming election this year and i urge everybody to go into the primary where where
[02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:09.700]  the you know i hear people say in november well i don't like to have a guy on either party well
[02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:14.260]  that's your fault that you weren't in there in the primary is getting the right guy on the ballot
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:18.420]  because he's not going to get elected unless he's on the ballot well it's definitely a lesser two
[02:45:18.420 --> 02:45:22.900]  evils and i've never even been to that view but the democrats are going for total broke the republican
[02:45:22.900 --> 02:45:26.500]  leadership is trying to kill the tea party we've got to get behind the tea party which you're a
[02:45:26.500 --> 02:45:32.020]  proto founder of across the board but i think about my grandmothers and how they interact with my
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:37.380]  grandfathers i'm all three of my grandparents are gone one of them still here that they weren't
[02:45:37.380 --> 02:45:43.540]  subservient women but they were on a team in that family and that family came first and they were
[02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:49.060]  powerful effective smart women that you know would read to me for hours in the summer when i was
[02:45:49.060 --> 02:45:55.140]  visiting them and who were super smart and had you know multiple degrees yeah yeah they could read
[02:45:55.140 --> 02:46:01.780]  and and and they and they wanted a strong family and i remember my grandmother my you know reading me
[02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:06.980]  the uh the uh you know when ulysses comes home and everything and his house has been taken over
[02:46:06.980 --> 02:46:11.700]  kind of an example of what's happened to america they were just such strong powerful women compared
[02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:17.620]  to what women are today and they call this modern thing a feminist and it's the complete opposite
[02:46:17.620 --> 02:46:22.580]  of an empowered woman you know notice the feminists they don't don't let women own guns i mean it's
[02:46:22.580 --> 02:46:27.860]  just so insane to see how they are destroying men they're destroying women all the things they're
[02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:33.620]  getting away with it it's so disgusting to see women becoming married to the state basically
[02:46:34.980 --> 02:46:40.660]  that's right that's what you you don't set up the family a traditional man and woman where the
[02:46:40.660 --> 02:46:47.220]  man is a provider and protector uh and then all these babies appear uh if you look to big brother
[02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:52.180]  government to support you and that's not the kind of country we want well you're supposed to put the
[02:46:52.180 --> 02:46:57.940]  load on the men so they compete and make a stronger society not not say uh men or nobodies they're
[02:46:57.940 --> 02:47:02.420]  idiots women you're in charge with the state and of course everything falls apart i mean look at
[02:47:02.420 --> 02:47:08.900]  illegitimacy in the black community less than 10 uh before the great society in the 60s these are
[02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:15.540]  mainline numbers now upwards of 90 and that same system is being deployed it is a system wrecking
[02:47:15.540 --> 02:47:19.940]  program uh we're going to plug the website one more time but i want to play you the clip
[02:47:19.940 --> 02:47:26.100]  since you mentioned it uh here is obama saying i've got a phone i've got a pin uh we are not
[02:47:26.100 --> 02:47:32.420]  just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure uh that we're providing americans
[02:47:32.420 --> 02:47:39.380]  the kind of health that they need uh i've got a pen and i've got a font and i can use that pen
[02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:44.580]  to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the
[02:47:44.580 --> 02:47:50.260]  ball forward and then since we were mentioning msnbc and promos saying your kids belong to him
[02:47:50.980 --> 02:47:56.500]  here's uh melissa harris perry uh going from memory on her name on they're saying you know
[02:47:56.500 --> 02:47:59.460]  we need to get over this idea that your kids belong to you they belong to the collective
[02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:06.580]  a bunch of control freaks and again at the level of msnbc hosts they are known technocrats with a
[02:48:06.580 --> 02:48:12.020]  scientific sociological takedown program i've read their textbooks these are cold-blooded
[02:48:12.020 --> 02:48:17.220]  culture killers let's play that clip and then get phyllis shafley's take on it so part of it
[02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:21.780]  is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids
[02:48:21.780 --> 02:48:26.020]  belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities once it's everybody's
[02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:30.580]  responsibility and not just the households then we start making better investments and once they
[02:48:30.580 --> 02:48:34.660]  get you into government health care they're going to run your life because well we're all having to
[02:48:34.660 --> 02:48:42.820]  pay for health care uh phyllis you know the ninth that said that parents right to control their
[02:48:42.820 --> 02:48:49.860]  own children stops at the threshold of the school door and the schools take over and we cannot allow
[02:48:49.860 --> 02:48:56.020]  that to happen it's unbelievable every nightmare visited upon the soviet union and other collectives
[02:48:56.020 --> 02:49:04.260]  hellholes is now manifesting um in closing and i appreciate you coming on what is your gut level
