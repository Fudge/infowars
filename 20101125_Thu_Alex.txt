[01:11.320 --> 01:14.920]  around they don't want to get into all of it there's a lot of harassment going

[01:37.280 --> 01:40.480]  winter starting to set in I've been a start to setting up in Minnesota we
[01:40.480 --> 01:45.280]  already had a blizzard you know our winners are a little bit different than
[01:45.280 --> 01:49.120]  Texas winners usually but yeah we've already had a blizzard we've got snow on
[01:49.120 --> 01:52.720]  the ground and not even though the temperatures have been hovering around
[01:52.720 --> 01:57.240]  freezing the snow hasn't fully left so who knows maybe we'll have it the rest
[01:57.240 --> 02:01.440]  of the year gov you know this show we have the first little short segment and
[02:01.440 --> 02:06.320]  we're gonna come back with a long segment but but I just wanted to commend
[02:06.320 --> 02:10.400]  you and the team and I'm very honored to have been involved as investigative
[02:10.400 --> 02:14.480]  reporting goes and for groundbreaking information and courage and the fact
[02:14.480 --> 02:19.760]  that it got on air I know most of the crew agreed I don't know your view but
[02:19.760 --> 02:25.280]  I believe that police state episode was so far the best the conspiracy theories
[02:25.280 --> 02:30.320]  ever put on air I won't I won't be that judgmental I'm proud of all of them that
[02:30.320 --> 02:33.320]  we're putting on the air you know they're all different topics they're all
[02:33.320 --> 02:38.280]  extremely interesting and when you delve and get into them they get even more
[02:38.280 --> 02:44.720]  interesting to do them but Alex I I'm gonna drop a bombshell on you today okay
[02:44.720 --> 02:52.640]  and that is this it all may be coming to an end for me and I haven't gone
[02:52.640 --> 02:58.320]  public with this I saved it for you because of my respect for you but it
[02:58.320 --> 03:02.520]  deals directly with what's going on with our airlines as you know I've had
[03:02.520 --> 03:09.480]  hip resurfacing done so that every time I get on a plane the buzzer goes off well
[03:09.480 --> 03:13.520]  now they've gone to this enhanced interrogation or whatever they want to
[03:13.520 --> 03:19.680]  call it enhanced searching Alex that guy in San Diego is completely correct if
[03:19.680 --> 03:26.520]  they did this to you on the street it would be considered a sexual attack
[03:26.520 --> 03:33.360]  absolutely so I am refusing to fly commercial airlines anymore I will not
[03:33.360 --> 03:40.120]  subject myself to this I'm a governor I'm a mayor I'm a United States Navy
[03:40.120 --> 03:45.000]  veteran I don't feel that I need to prove that I'm not a murderer and that I
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.200]  would hijack a plane or any such nonsense and I will not subject myself
[03:51.200 --> 03:57.360]  and the head of Homeland Security Janet or Napolitano whatever her name was her
[03:57.360 --> 04:02.880]  big quote yesterday was on this enhanced searching she said if you don't like it
[04:02.880 --> 04:08.240]  don't fly well that's the ultimatum she's given me and I'm exercising it I
[04:08.240 --> 04:13.360]  will not fly on a commercial airliner again unless I change my mind well you
[04:13.360 --> 04:19.200]  know me I don't change my mind too often no you don't and governor some
[04:19.200 --> 04:22.520]  stations don't carry this first segment I want to come back and recap all this
[04:22.520 --> 04:26.400]  because that was on my list I wanted to talk about the breaking seriously
[04:26.400 --> 04:31.520]  historical transmission that we hope makes it on air tonight I mean there's
[04:31.520 --> 04:34.480]  never been anything this brave on television dealing with JFK or this
[04:34.480 --> 04:39.240]  accurate then I want to go back over the FEMA camp special the police state
[04:39.240 --> 04:43.440]  special it's gonna rear tonight before the premiere and that was next TSA I've
[04:43.440 --> 04:47.040]  flown with you I've seen what you go through and now they actually stick
[04:47.040 --> 04:51.080]  their hands in your pants we broke that two weeks ago people didn't believe it
[04:51.080 --> 04:54.200]  now it's confirmed stay there governor I'm gonna talk about this when we get
[04:54.200 --> 05:02.440]  back this is incredible stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good
[05:02.440 --> 05:06.440]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[05:06.440 --> 05:10.240]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[05:10.240 --> 05:14.360]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:14.360 --> 05:18.560]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[05:18.560 --> 05:22.880]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[05:22.880 --> 05:26.840]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[05:26.840 --> 05:31.200]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[05:31.200 --> 05:34.960]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[05:34.960 --> 05:39.080]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:39.080 --> 05:42.880]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[05:42.880 --> 05:46.360]  powered generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors

[08:05.480 --> 08:13.800]  GCN radio network well his hit TV show is now well into its second season the
[08:13.800 --> 08:19.040]  JFK special with breaking never before seen deathbed confession by one of the
[08:19.040 --> 08:23.760]  assassins it fingers George Herbert Walker Bush we're gonna get governor
[08:23.760 --> 08:26.680]  Ventura to talk about as much as he can ahead of the premiere tonight nine
[08:26.680 --> 08:31.520]  o'clock central on true TV the hour before the police state FEMA camp
[08:31.520 --> 08:38.360]  special that has just literally been a brush fire across the country a huge
[08:38.360 --> 08:41.440]  story in the last week since it aired that's gonna re-air at eight o'clock
[08:41.440 --> 08:45.320]  tonight the hour before the new premiere I have the governor on to talk
[08:45.320 --> 08:49.600]  about that today but he said Alex I've got something else I want to talk about
[08:49.600 --> 08:55.560]  and he said he was saving it for this radio broadcast today and this is
[08:55.560 --> 09:00.600]  newsworthy and so governor Jesse Ventura before we get into the TV show we
[09:00.600 --> 09:05.240]  appreciate you breaking this here and joining the revolt and break down now
[09:05.240 --> 09:11.040]  your view on what's happening well Alex as you know first of all I had to have
[09:11.040 --> 09:16.720]  hip surgery so I got a technique called hip resurfacing which means of course
[09:16.720 --> 09:21.080]  they put carbon titanium steel in your body they cover your joint with it and
[09:21.080 --> 09:25.560]  it's because of that that I'm able to walk today if it worked for the hip
[09:25.560 --> 09:29.920]  surgery the resurfacing I would be in a wheelchair and would be an infallent and
[09:29.920 --> 09:35.000]  I wouldn't be leading too good of a life but I had to have it but in light of that
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.760]  every time I go to an airport the the metal detector goes off because I have
[09:40.760 --> 09:46.280]  the metal in my body which many people do now they've done this enhanced
[09:46.280 --> 09:51.960]  searching where where the TSA and Homeland Security said it's not good
[09:51.960 --> 09:57.400]  enough they're gonna either you got to go into these full body X-ray machines if
[09:57.400 --> 10:02.440]  you set it off or you now don't even get wanded you get completely hand-searched
[10:02.440 --> 10:08.520]  to wear if they touched you the guy from San Diego is completely correct if you
[10:08.520 --> 10:14.000]  were touched that way on the street it would be a sexual assault but they're
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  able to get away with this because of apparently providing safety for us in
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.400]  airplanes so I've made the decision myself personally that I will not fly
[10:25.400 --> 10:30.200]  public aircraft anymore nor use the public to where I'm subjected to this I
[10:30.200 --> 10:36.840]  feel that as a former governor a former mayor a honorably discharged United
[10:36.840 --> 10:43.560]  States Navy veteran of Vietnam veteran that I I can't live with myself and
[10:43.560 --> 10:49.240]  subject myself that every time I go to an airport I have to prove that I'm not
[10:49.240 --> 10:54.480]  a murderer I have to prove that I'm not guilty of anything I have to prove that
[10:54.480 --> 11:01.000]  I won't hijack a plane I find it ridiculous and so for my own personal
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.080]  choice I will not fly a commercial airliner or subject myself to that again
[11:07.080 --> 11:13.520]  and it probably means an end to my career pretty much I don't know if
[11:13.520 --> 11:17.520]  there's jobs to do now I will have to fly either in a private plane or find
[11:17.520 --> 11:23.400]  another mode of transportation if I so desire to do them but I will not do this
[11:23.400 --> 11:29.000]  anymore the United States of America within our boundaries be subjected to
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.920]  a policy that is the exact opposite of our legal standards in America of that
[11:34.920 --> 11:41.320]  you're innocent until proven guilty now I admit certainly security things need to
[11:41.320 --> 11:46.320]  be done but why is the US government in charge of it why isn't in each
[11:46.320 --> 11:52.560]  individual airline in charge of their own security and determining who flies
[11:52.560 --> 11:58.120]  their planes and who don't well that's a key governor TSA is already rolling out
[11:58.120 --> 12:03.840]  Viper teams they have mobile vans mobile trucks where they are openly now making
[12:03.840 --> 12:10.000]  people go through them at random sports stadium events at musical events at bus
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.240]  stops at train stations on highways this is a total federal power grab with
[12:15.240 --> 12:20.280]  minimum wage security guards given powers that police can engage in and
[12:20.280 --> 12:27.760]  yesterday I had the DA on from San Mateo County and that's where the San
[12:27.760 --> 12:32.920]  Francisco Airport is based and he said that his sheriff's deputies can't grab
[12:32.920 --> 12:36.120]  someone's genitals inside their pants are on the outside unless it's an
[12:36.120 --> 12:39.000]  emergency and the person has been arrested and then it's got to be same
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.440]  gender and he said that he's not just warned that the TSA that they're not
[12:43.440 --> 12:47.400]  above the law that was his quote but that he is now dispatched sheriff's
[12:47.400 --> 12:52.320]  deputies to the San Francisco Airport and that if he sees them touching
[12:52.320 --> 12:55.920]  people's genitals through the clothes it's a misdemeanor they'll be arrested
[12:55.920 --> 12:59.400]  if they put them in the pants which they've now announced and they've now
[12:59.400 --> 13:03.240]  confirmed including in some cases actually going in the underwear and
[13:03.240 --> 13:09.360]  grabbing the genitals and squeezing them that it will be felony sexual assault
[13:09.360 --> 13:15.120]  now other DA's have come out now major airports in Florida are saying we don't
[13:15.120 --> 13:19.360]  have to have the federal government in here we are going to do our own security
[13:19.360 --> 13:26.000]  well to me why why why isn't it done by the airlines in the first place they're
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.360]  supposed to be private enterprise why is it the government that provides
[13:31.360 --> 13:37.160]  security for the airlines let the airlines provide their own and then you
[13:37.160 --> 13:41.320]  choose who you want to fly with and if you have a relationship with that
[13:41.320 --> 13:46.240]  airline like in my case it would be Delta airline because they bought out and
[13:46.240 --> 13:51.600]  merged with Northwest well Northwest the hub was here I know them very well
[13:51.600 --> 13:57.560]  having been the governor why can't I have a relationship with an airline where
[13:57.560 --> 14:02.240]  I'm not subjected to this type of behavior simply because I want to go
[14:02.240 --> 14:08.640]  fly and do my jobs well whatever it may be go on vacation whatever it might be
[14:08.640 --> 14:14.280]  but yet I I've never been arrested I've never broken the law I'm not a
[14:14.280 --> 14:18.800]  terrorist I've served my country honorably for six years as in the
[14:18.800 --> 14:26.520]  military I was no ill will on my country I'm a patriot to my country and yet I'm
[14:26.520 --> 14:32.720]  suggest subjected and treated like I might hijack a plane or I might blow up
[14:32.720 --> 14:39.360]  and murder people and I take offense to that Alex well governor that's what
[14:39.360 --> 14:43.800]  this is all about it's about training us that we're the bad guys and that we
[14:43.800 --> 14:47.440]  have no constitutional training they don't search people like this in
[14:47.440 --> 14:52.440]  communist China well I have friends in Mexico who come from Europe and they've
[14:52.440 --> 14:57.680]  told me they avoid the United States like the plague now that when they go to
[14:57.680 --> 15:02.520]  Mexico and that they will fly through any other cities accepted going through the
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.600]  United States is that really how we want to portray ourselves in the world
[15:07.600 --> 15:11.680]  well CNN reported as well as the Associated Press that it's been over
[15:11.680 --> 15:17.480]  nine billion dollars a year lost since 2006 that they know of because
[15:17.480 --> 15:23.040]  tourism is down by over a third because foreigners won't come here because of the
[15:23.040 --> 15:26.680]  police state and they've been phasing in these enhanced pat downs they've been
[15:26.680 --> 15:31.560]  phasing in the body scanners for tourists from outside now they're just doing it
[15:31.560 --> 15:35.360]  to citizens and we're doing the same thing and just last week they had the
[15:35.360 --> 15:41.160]  heads of the pilot association they had the heads of the flight attendant unions
[15:41.160 --> 15:46.240]  they had the heads lobbyists that represent the hotels and the theme parks
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.240]  and they said please stop it's killing us well the thing is to Alex okay they'll
[15:51.240 --> 15:55.800]  offer to me when I when I put off the original buzzer when I walk through you've
[15:55.800 --> 16:01.680]  seen it we've traveled together the buzzer goes off well then I'm given an
[16:01.680 --> 16:08.200]  option I can go into this whole body scan x-ray machine which if they have to
[16:08.200 --> 16:13.680]  black out your face because if the photo from that were put on the internet they
[16:13.680 --> 16:20.200]  would have full nudity of you did you hear about a mule king right so you're
[16:20.200 --> 16:25.480]  also being x-rayed Alex yes now if you're flying four times a week I don't
[16:25.480 --> 16:31.440]  care how much they tell you how little radiation you're getting you start
[16:31.440 --> 16:36.760]  multiplying that out four or five six times a week 52 weeks out of the year
[16:36.760 --> 16:41.880]  maybe then it's five years from now I get some brain tumor and everyone's gonna
[16:41.880 --> 16:47.240]  say gee how did that happen incredible that was my I don't want to go in those
[16:47.240 --> 16:52.960]  things the pilots don't want to be subjected to them the flight attendants
[16:52.960 --> 16:57.080]  don't want to be subjected to people who fly the most do not want to be
[16:57.080 --> 17:01.880]  subjected when you go in and get an x-ray they cover your genitals with lead
[17:01.880 --> 17:09.160]  the guy goes into another room they even do that with teeth x-rays they you know
[17:09.160 --> 17:13.560]  and now they're saying oh yeah go walk through this thing four or five times a
[17:13.560 --> 17:19.440]  week and then tell me three years from now something wrong well that was my
[17:19.440 --> 17:25.720]  develop something why refuse to do that so now I'm subjected to these searches
[17:25.720 --> 17:32.000]  that on the street would be deemed as you said by this deputy illegal absolutely
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.560]  by multiple DA's now and you know and what and they're doing and I think you're
[17:37.560 --> 17:41.880]  exactly right Alex I think they're doing this to prepare us they're getting
[17:41.880 --> 17:48.000]  that's why I'm rebelling because Alex I was getting in a free society I was
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.840]  getting too comfortable being searched three to four to five times a week and I
[17:54.840 --> 18:01.080]  finally said I can't do this anymore and keep my sanity I believe in freedom and
[18:01.080 --> 18:05.920]  I believe nobody has the right to search you for any reason in our country
[18:05.920 --> 18:09.960]  unless they have probable cause that you've committed a crime and they got a
[18:09.960 --> 18:19.720]  warrant to that extent and so the only way I can rebel is do what Poletano said
[18:19.720 --> 18:26.760]  he gave the ultimatum if you don't like it don't fly all right I take her up on
[18:26.760 --> 18:31.240]  it I'm not flying anymore absolutely so you agree that we need to draw the line
[18:31.240 --> 18:34.920]  here and say no because notice it's always more more more take your shoes
[18:34.920 --> 18:39.000]  off answer questions can't carry shampoo can't have toothpaste now we're gonna

[18:52.280 --> 19:00.440]  the scanner you will not fly and this is the seizure of the once free Western
[19:00.440 --> 19:03.800]  society they know exactly and on top of it governor what do you think of
[19:03.800 --> 19:08.680]  Chertoff ordering the first scanners as Homeland Security had and then becoming
[19:08.680 --> 19:13.320]  the head of the company making millions of dollars himself off this well you

[24:17.680 --> 24:22.400]  central 10 p.m. Eastern True TV of the JFK special and believe me nothing like
[24:22.400 --> 24:27.080]  this has ever been on national TV this is bold but governor finishing up
[24:27.080 --> 24:33.480]  briefly with the huge revolt I mean every time I turn on TV CNN MSNBC Fox it's
[24:33.480 --> 24:38.400]  all they're talking about and more and more people I've seen polls of 96% in
[24:38.400 --> 24:41.960]  Reuters saying they're not gonna fly because of this big sis
[24:41.960 --> 24:47.960]  Napolitano's already had to back off and say that okay under 12 we won't grab
[24:47.960 --> 24:53.600]  your genitals okay the pilots you've just got to show an ID to make sure that
[24:53.600 --> 24:58.840]  you are who you say you are so they're backing off the problem is they'll just
[24:58.840 --> 25:02.520]  stage some new terror attack the latest thing in Germany it turned out that was
[25:02.520 --> 25:07.080]  a government drill there wasn't really a bomb yesterday they just use that to to
[25:07.080 --> 25:13.280]  scare monger rush but I see the American people finally really getting
[25:13.280 --> 25:17.480]  angry over the government sticking their hands down their pants well I hope so
[25:17.480 --> 25:22.960]  Alex I mean maybe they've finally gone too far I don't know I certainly would
[25:22.960 --> 25:28.480]  hope so as I said they've gone too far with me I will not fly commercial again
[25:28.480 --> 25:32.480]  as long as these standards that are currently in place right now apply and
[25:32.480 --> 25:36.280]  and you said something very astute and it's the same thing was happening I
[25:36.280 --> 25:40.480]  noticed flying that five six seven years ago I got angry by him asking me
[25:40.480 --> 25:44.080]  questions taking my shoes off now it was routine like I was taking out the
[25:44.080 --> 25:48.400]  garbage or you know making coffee it was I felt comfortable doing it we're all
[25:48.400 --> 25:52.680]  being conditioned and and it's always more more more this is Pavlovian
[25:52.680 --> 25:57.840]  conditioning oh absolutely absolutely it is because that's what happened to me
[25:57.840 --> 26:03.320]  this summer I was flying probably three to three four times a week doing the show
[26:03.320 --> 26:08.280]  the different locations throughout the country and I started to become
[26:08.280 --> 26:12.800]  comfortable with the fact that three or four times a week I would be padded down
[26:12.800 --> 26:18.680]  and searched well it got the then the last time I flew was when the enhanced
[26:18.680 --> 26:24.920]  went into effect I had one last flight from Washington DC back to Minneapolis
[26:24.920 --> 26:32.240]  and of course I set the buzzer off I refused to go into the microwave and so
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.560]  they did that at the hand search me and they explained they don't even use the
[26:36.560 --> 26:44.240]  wand now Alex they used to just basically want you which I you know I may
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.720]  still fly in foreign countries because foreign countries just want you where
[26:49.720 --> 26:54.000]  they don't actually touch you they just go around you with the handheld wand
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.680]  well let's look at this quickly and then move on to the point is that won't
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.880]  happen in the United States now unless they change policy so I'm left with no
[27:02.880 --> 27:07.720]  alternative as the Poletano said in her blunt statement if you don't like it
[27:07.720 --> 27:12.520]  don't fly so I'm choosing not to fly and I encourage others to do the same that
[27:12.520 --> 27:15.720]  will shut these parasites down I think they're gonna fail then they'll just
[27:15.720 --> 27:22.600]  stage a terror attack governor looking at this though just three weeks ago I was
[27:22.600 --> 27:26.120]  in an airport watching them put their hands through the clothes on the genitals
[27:26.120 --> 27:33.240]  and they push I saw this happen and now it's all over the news men women they
[27:33.240 --> 27:38.200]  actually squeeze your privates I had it done to me and they don't squeeze they
[27:38.200 --> 27:44.320]  didn't do that to me but they actually go into your groin that's so close that
[27:44.320 --> 27:51.680]  they actually go down through your groin and almost to Uranus okay well now sir
[27:51.680 --> 27:57.200]  you know and you know that's what was done to me a couple weeks ago the last
[27:57.200 --> 28:02.880]  draw for me okay well since then sir they now this is mainstream news we
[28:02.880 --> 28:05.520]  broke this a few weeks ago people couldn't believe it it's now all over the
[28:05.520 --> 28:12.560]  news they actually stick their hand into your pants and grab your genitals well
[28:12.560 --> 28:20.480]  I can't believe these people would do it that worked for TSA they're okay with
[28:20.480 --> 28:25.040]  what they're doing they say oh we're professionals and you know you know you
[28:25.040 --> 28:30.880]  know you know what it is Alex and let's tie it into the JFK show right now we
[28:30.880 --> 28:35.560]  have a confession tonight that people for the first time in history will hear
[28:35.560 --> 28:41.200]  someone confess to the murder of John Kennedy and I'll just say this this is a
[28:41.200 --> 28:46.360]  spine-chilling confession it hits me right in the gut when it happens every
[28:46.360 --> 28:51.520]  time I look at it and what hits me the most out of it is this Alex the person
[28:51.520 --> 28:59.800]  confessing is not confessing out of shame the person is proudly confessing
[28:59.800 --> 29:05.600]  the person believes that what they did in killing our president that our
[29:05.600 --> 29:13.240]  country benefited from it in the long run and that's truly the chilling part of
[29:13.240 --> 29:19.040]  the show is that these people that work for our government now believe that what
[29:19.040 --> 29:24.400]  they're doing is in the best interest of our country because this guy that
[29:24.400 --> 29:29.960]  participated in murdering our president that was the that's the attitude he has
[29:29.960 --> 29:36.720]  it's not a confession of sorrow it's a confession of I want the world to know
[29:36.720 --> 29:41.400]  what we did because we're proud of it stay there governor big long segment
[29:41.400 --> 29:45.480]  coming up good let's get into this in more detail this is chilling and

[33:54.040 --> 33:59.000]  Hopkins as saying the scanners were safe when the federal government's own
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.280]  bodies say it's not and then the John Hopkins head of radiology came out the
[34:03.280 --> 34:08.760]  doctor mr. Love and told AP we didn't tell him that that's not true they'd
[34:08.760 --> 34:14.920]  been on record saying repeated you know doses of this will give you skin cancer
[34:14.920 --> 34:19.240]  bare minimum it is x-rays and what about the TSA workers that are around it all
[34:19.240 --> 34:23.480]  day and we know they're firing TSA workers that don't want to do this over
[34:23.480 --> 34:27.560]  and over again they stick their hands in your pants they say let me interject
[34:27.560 --> 34:32.840]  something though you won't have to necessarily worry about that because you
[34:32.840 --> 34:38.080]  know if you go through and you don't set off the metal detector it's the same as
[34:38.080 --> 34:42.880]  always no no TSA is now announced in the Chicago Tribune that they do plan to
[34:42.880 --> 34:46.360]  have scanners everywhere and phase out metal detectors all together you're
[34:46.360 --> 34:51.200]  right for now governor but no right now see the only reason I did it is because
[34:51.200 --> 34:57.400]  I have to surgery the way they put the metal in my body so I can't no matter I
[34:57.400 --> 35:03.800]  could walk through naked and it's gonna go off because it's inside my body but
[35:03.800 --> 35:08.360]  if you go through and you don't have any metal on you you strip down the way they
[35:08.360 --> 35:12.840]  tell you put your shoes on there and all that you can still travel normal if
[35:12.840 --> 35:17.920]  I was faced with only that I would continue to fly but it's traumatic
[35:17.920 --> 35:22.760]  watching I was in San Jose three weeks ago and for 20 minutes drinking coffee
[35:22.760 --> 35:29.840]  after I'd gone through governor I only watched women and children no men I saw
[35:29.840 --> 35:34.640]  them feeling up year-old two-year-old babies it happened to one of my employees
[35:34.640 --> 35:39.920]  Michelle for a 20 month old baby to her they had a man search Michelle that
[35:39.920 --> 35:43.960]  works in my office I mean governor this is just they're breaking every taboo but
[35:43.960 --> 35:48.640]  I'm sorry you got back to the raw exercise of power how the TSA say they're
[35:48.640 --> 35:53.120]  proud of what they're doing same thing with his deathbed assassin confession
[35:53.120 --> 35:57.440]  this is a famous villain this is a famous well-known character what was the
[35:57.440 --> 36:05.360]  term you used off air I don't recall I mean you describe you described him
[36:05.360 --> 36:10.840]  really well though because you know me it'll be exposed tonight as a well and
[36:10.840 --> 36:16.200]  the thing is about this person he's proud of it this is not a confession of
[36:16.200 --> 36:22.440]  sorrow it's not a confession of I want to apologize to America that we killed
[36:22.440 --> 36:28.160]  your president it's a confession of wait a minute I want credit for this
[36:28.160 --> 36:34.760]  because we made America a better place by killing your president by taking the
[36:34.760 --> 36:41.080]  vote away from you and putting it into a trigger finger instead of a ballot you
[36:41.080 --> 36:45.680]  know and that's the real scary part about it on the show tonight and you know
[36:45.680 --> 36:52.880]  the other there's fun parts of the show too we retrace the the exact route that
[36:52.880 --> 36:57.720]  Oswald took when he left the bookstore and was subsequently arrested in the
[36:57.720 --> 37:05.480]  theater and that in itself is bizarre it makes no sense you know and so people
[37:05.480 --> 37:09.560]  will watch that it'll be very interesting you also as a as an expert
[37:09.560 --> 37:18.200]  marksman in the Navy SEALs who shot expert you tried to recreate what Oswald
[37:18.200 --> 37:21.720]  supposedly did and you couldn't know I couldn't even you couldn't come close
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.400]  Alex because of the fact you can't work the bolt fast enough and get on target
[37:26.400 --> 37:31.080]  once you go to work the man let your car candle bolt it's a piece of junk that
[37:31.080 --> 37:36.720]  the telescopic site was like a thin cigar and this is identical to what they
[37:36.720 --> 37:42.120]  showed as the killing weapon well when you do the bolt for the second and third
[37:42.120 --> 37:46.320]  shots which allegedly he missed the first shot anyway so I would miss the
[37:46.320 --> 37:51.320]  first shot on purpose except for the last time the last I did it four times
[37:51.320 --> 37:56.000]  the last time I did it just to show that the first shot would be the best
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.320]  I said this time instead of missing the first shot on purpose I'm going to shoot
[38:01.320 --> 38:05.840]  the silhouette of Jackie right in the right between the shoulder blades and I
[38:05.840 --> 38:11.440]  did it with the first shot to show how accurate you would be with the first shot
[38:11.440 --> 38:17.840]  but then subsequently working the bolt takes you off target yes well the
[38:17.840 --> 38:23.360]  fastest I could do the bolt was 8.6 seconds and they're claiming Oswald
[38:23.360 --> 38:29.720]  did it the six flat now you're almost three seconds faster than I could so it
[38:29.720 --> 38:33.520]  took you eight seconds to do to me each six just to do the bolt and that's
[38:33.520 --> 38:39.800]  blindly shooting you can't even get on target that's just to be able to get the
[38:39.800 --> 38:44.680]  rounds out Alex yeah that's firing the two rounds well the three the initial
[38:44.680 --> 38:48.360]  round and then the two that come after sure he's got to do the bolt on twice
[38:48.360 --> 38:56.040]  now I did score a headshot but let's remember my targets will not be moving
[38:56.040 --> 39:02.640]  or declining mine were stationary they were the identical length of the Warren
[39:02.640 --> 39:07.560]  Commission stated we measured them off and I go up in a big lift so I'm at the
[39:07.560 --> 39:12.560]  exact shooting position that they claimed Oswald shot from but the difference
[39:12.560 --> 39:18.560]  my targets were not moving his were and I couldn't even do it to targets that
[39:18.560 --> 39:22.200]  work that we're not moving sure just to be specific though I know there were
[39:22.200 --> 39:26.360]  three shots I'm saying one shot where you're already have the round chambered
[39:26.360 --> 39:30.560]  and then twice that you had to do the bolt that took over eight seconds took
[39:30.560 --> 39:37.200]  eight point six seconds that was my fastest that was the fastest one we did
[39:37.200 --> 39:40.920]  it four times well you know what the Italians called that rifle the humane
[39:40.920 --> 39:46.880]  rifle oh yeah no I'm aware of it yeah no we had we had got Dr. Fetcher was with
[39:46.880 --> 39:52.960]  us when we did it and you also interviewed Jim Mars yep great guy we
[39:52.960 --> 39:57.640]  talked to Jim right in the theater and Jim will reveal stuff tonight that's very
[39:57.640 --> 40:02.600]  interesting let's talk to me really interesting about what well here's one
[40:02.600 --> 40:07.560]  interesting thing you got Alex on food for thought of common sense now you've
[40:07.560 --> 40:12.200]  just had the murder of the president a little while later you have a murder of
[40:12.200 --> 40:17.760]  a police officer on the street now the only phone call made was that someone
[40:17.760 --> 40:23.680]  went into the movie theater didn't buy a ticket now if that happened in that
[40:23.680 --> 40:27.840]  sequence of order the murder of the president a half hour later the murder
[40:27.840 --> 40:32.040]  of a police officer and a half hour later somebody don't buy a ticket to go
[40:32.040 --> 40:39.720]  into a theater how come nearly 20 cops and eight or nine squad cars arrive to
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.280]  arrest a guy who didn't buy a ticket to the theater well normally especially in
[40:44.280 --> 40:49.360]  1963 they would just send in the theater manager to throw you out or demand you
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.680]  buy a ticket well not only that but as a police dispatcher you got the president
[40:54.680 --> 40:59.400]  murdered out there you got a police officer shot dead on the street you're
[40:59.400 --> 41:04.200]  gonna dispatch 20 cops to a movie theater now it shows it was all staged it
[41:04.200 --> 41:10.320]  was all staged I believe that Oswald was supposed to die in the theater and I
[41:10.320 --> 41:13.840]  think that's where the screw-up came up that they were gonna get him and kill
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.680]  him there for resisting arrest and that way they do him in there but then I'm
[41:19.680 --> 41:24.240]  the defendant someone a file I believe they had to then take him in the custody
[41:24.240 --> 41:29.000]  and then of course they then had to get Ruby to kill it by the way there's a
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.840]  phenomenal new book on it out Alex I don't know if you know that have you
[41:32.840 --> 41:40.280]  heard of Judith Barry Baker yes well I just read her book fills in all the
[41:40.280 --> 41:47.120]  blanks of New Orleans prior to him going to Dallas everything the entire Jim
[41:47.120 --> 41:55.440]  Garrison case becomes crystal clear this was Oswald's mistress and he knows more
[41:55.440 --> 41:59.720]  than Marina would ever know because that's the one of the keys to the
[41:59.720 --> 42:07.800]  mystery Oswald was already estranged from Marina for months prior to the
[42:07.800 --> 42:15.560]  killing amazing he was having an affair with this woman and she herself was
[42:15.560 --> 42:21.560]  involved in the whole thing of Oswald clearly was a CIA agent and an FBI
[42:21.560 --> 42:27.700]  informant because he was working on a project with this woman with David
[42:27.700 --> 42:34.060]  Ferry with dr. Osher of the famous Osher cancer clinic down in Tulane they
[42:34.060 --> 42:41.880]  were attempting to create a fast-moving cancer of which to assassinate Castro and
[42:41.880 --> 42:47.080]  now they put in the vaccines governor but that's the behind the story of who
[42:47.080 --> 42:52.320]  Lee Harvey Oswald was why do you think Alex they had to take all information on
[42:52.320 --> 42:56.800]  Oswald and lock it up in the National Archives because of national security
[42:56.800 --> 43:00.840]  Oh absolutely I mean why do you think he's out at a secret U2 spy plane base
[43:00.840 --> 43:06.040]  in Japan is allowed to go to Russia and allowed to defect back and then just
[43:06.040 --> 43:12.960]  left alone and not thrown in in irons I mean this guy Lee Oswald when you if you
[43:12.960 --> 43:19.200]  read this book by Judith Barry Baker Lee I she wrote the book she's in hiding
[43:19.200 --> 43:23.960]  she's in Europe right now and she's been in hiding you know how she hid out all
[43:23.960 --> 43:29.000]  these years she became a Mormon and she entered them you know Mormons have kind
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.440]  of their close-knit communities of protection and that's how she David
[43:34.440 --> 43:40.520]  Ferry warned her if you want to live you better go underground and she did her
[43:40.520 --> 43:45.800]  husband didn't know about this her children didn't and it's all documented
[43:45.800 --> 43:50.320]  in this book it's it's just thrilling to read this thing well I want to get her
[43:50.320 --> 43:56.160]  on the show I've been meaning to do that she's in Europe we can all come here
[43:56.160 --> 44:02.640]  because of fear for her life even today and in the book though you remember when
[44:02.640 --> 44:08.040]  Oswald worked at the O'Reilly coffee company yes she was likewise hired there
[44:08.040 --> 44:13.520]  that was both under the guise of working for Dr. Oster Oswald could move about
[44:13.520 --> 44:18.680]  freely because he did his time cards every day and in the book she shows you
[44:18.680 --> 44:23.960]  the time cards with her initials at the bottom it's all true and it's all
[44:23.960 --> 44:31.840]  documented she has it all now this was a government agent definitely it's even
[44:31.840 --> 44:36.640]  come out in some government documents that he was also we have CIA documents
[44:36.640 --> 44:42.240]  that have been declassified that show a George Herbert Walker Bush working for
[44:42.240 --> 44:48.560]  the CIA but he said he was never in the CIA until the mid-70s when Nixon who we
[44:48.560 --> 44:54.000]  know was involved in the JFK operation magically makes him CIA director but
[44:54.000 --> 45:00.280]  tonight you guys really do something that takes a lot of hood smoke whatever
[45:00.280 --> 45:04.800]  you do one of these things Alex you think you know it all I mean I've been
[45:04.800 --> 45:12.120]  studying JFK now for over 25 years but in the course of doing this I even I got
[45:12.120 --> 45:16.440]  stunned when there's a connection to George Herbert Walker Bush and we will
[45:16.440 --> 45:21.720]  expose that tonight also and it was something that I never had a clue of in
[45:21.720 --> 45:26.480]  all of the research I had done up until this so that's one of the exciting
[45:26.480 --> 45:31.440]  things about doing this show is no matter what preconceived ideas that I
[45:31.440 --> 45:36.240]  have a knowledge I have going in something always happens or something
[45:36.240 --> 45:43.040]  rears its head that I had unaware of like in many cases it always turns out to be
[45:43.040 --> 45:48.800]  Hallibur but in this case of course it's it's it's different but Halliburton was
[45:48.800 --> 45:53.880]  involved in one way Halliburton was a subsidiary of Kellogg Brown and Root that
[45:53.880 --> 45:58.920]  made the billions of dollars on construction projects and dredging the
[45:58.920 --> 46:03.000]  Gulf of Tonk and in other areas they were some of the biggest lobbyist angry
[46:03.000 --> 46:10.880]  about oh yeah the Halliburton rears its head even 40 years after the war
[46:11.600 --> 46:19.640]  amazing unbelievable that's coming up tonight 9 o'clock on true TV it's on
[46:19.640 --> 46:24.960]  most basic cable packages it'll be interesting Alex now this should be
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.320]  headline news in the paper tomorrow shouldn't it yes I mean the fact that
[46:29.320 --> 46:34.920]  someone is now confessed to killing our president because let's remember
[46:34.920 --> 46:40.680]  something there's no statute of limitations on murder if you kill
[46:40.680 --> 46:46.480]  someone 50 years ago you can be tried for it today because there's no statute
[46:46.480 --> 46:51.000]  of limitations so here you have a confession to the murder of our
[46:51.000 --> 46:57.200]  president and yet mainstream media won't even report to show tomorrow that
[46:57.200 --> 47:01.680]  this happened governor let's try to be on the front page of every newspaper in
[47:01.680 --> 47:07.880]  America governor let's try to change that together with the audience right now
[47:07.880 --> 47:13.440]  we have succeeded in the 50 plus times we've done this almost every time
[47:13.440 --> 47:19.680]  yesterday we did a term dealing with silver and only made it to number two we
[47:19.680 --> 47:24.960]  need to make this the number one Google search today right now so that hundreds
[47:24.960 --> 47:30.040]  of publications go click on it and find out that it's info wars calm and
[47:30.040 --> 47:38.560]  prison planet calm we need to make JFK deathbed confession those three words
[47:38.560 --> 47:43.640]  and that will lead them to Jesse Ventura to air JFK assassination deathbed
[47:43.640 --> 47:47.040]  confession that will lead them to the article that leads them to the show
[47:47.040 --> 47:51.880]  tonight folks this is true activism just like we started three weeks ago the
[47:51.880 --> 47:56.040]  revolt against the TSA here on this show even mainstream media has admitted
[47:56.040 --> 48:00.760]  that the drudge report teamed up with us and now it's the biggest story and the
[48:00.760 --> 48:04.760]  revolt is on we can have another salvo for truth here I want you to go to
[48:04.760 --> 48:11.480]  Google and type in these this acronym in two words JFK or the initials not
[48:11.480 --> 48:19.720]  acronym JFK deathbed confession JFK deathbed confession I even want the crew
[48:19.720 --> 48:24.560]  to type it into Google right now I'm gonna do it during the break JFK deathbed
[48:24.560 --> 48:29.840]  confession JFK deathbed confession those three words let's make it number one I
[48:29.840 --> 48:33.120]  mean they put a lot on the line they've had guys in suits breaking into their
[48:33.120 --> 48:36.880]  trash trying to find out their JFK context they've been I've been getting
[48:36.880 --> 48:41.240]  threats there's been all sorts of chicanery going on they exposed the FEMA
[48:41.240 --> 48:44.640]  camps last week like no one has ever done with the complete proof we're gonna
[48:44.640 --> 48:49.000]  talk about that before just you gotta leave her in about 12 minutes this this
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.480]  is just as brown breaking or more tonight 9 o'clock central 10 o'clock
[48:53.480 --> 48:56.760]  Eastern let's make it the number one search term today so people get interested
[48:56.760 --> 49:02.520]  and check it out this is how we go around the media blockade JFK deathbed
[49:02.520 --> 49:08.440]  confession now shifting gears governor Ventura I want to salute you and I want
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.120]  to say I was honored to be involved and thank you for involving me and on the
[49:13.120 --> 49:16.840]  fusion centers the Mayak report that we broke last year when law enforcement gave
[49:16.840 --> 49:21.320]  it to us but putting it on national TV going to the FEMA camps going and
[49:21.320 --> 49:25.360]  confronting the congressman that co-authored and then sponsored bills
[49:25.360 --> 49:30.160]  having them play dumb and then confronting them with the bill I thought
[49:30.160 --> 49:34.400]  it was going to rear tonight like the Wall Street one aired from the week
[49:34.400 --> 49:40.400]  before last week before the police state one but it's they're not rearing the
[49:40.400 --> 49:43.200]  police state tonight at eight they're airing something else one of the
[49:43.200 --> 49:47.400]  previous shows and that's fine but I think this is some of the most important
[49:47.400 --> 49:51.440]  television I've ever seen it really woke a lot of folks up we've had Glenn Beck
[49:51.440 --> 49:56.000]  denying FEMA camps we've had popular mechanics with their classic disinfo
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.880]  straw men going to things that aren't camps to then say there are no camps in
[49:59.880 --> 50:05.720]  the world you know that classic tactic what can you the bottom line was I saw
[50:05.720 --> 50:12.920]  one absolutely I mean I stood in front of it and they call it a resident and the
[50:12.920 --> 50:17.800]  things got barbed wire fence it's got two double multiple fences 20 feet in
[50:17.800 --> 50:23.200]  between them I was a governor I know what a prison looks like and you know this
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.600]  looks like a prison you can't walk in it no one can come out freely yet it's
[50:28.600 --> 50:33.240]  called a residence they even have a sign you can be arrested if you bring in
[50:33.240 --> 50:40.120]  anything that allows someone to escape well then clearly this is not what I
[50:40.120 --> 50:46.360]  saw a residence this is a detainment center which is another word for a
[50:46.360 --> 50:52.600]  prison guys giving a document cam shot for prison planet dot TV viewers and
[50:52.600 --> 50:58.240]  and so you know that's the bottom line is that these places are out there the
[50:58.240 --> 51:03.280]  other big thing to remember is when I go to confront these congressmen remember
[51:03.280 --> 51:09.040]  they may be telling the truth they maybe don't know what's in the bill that's
[51:09.040 --> 51:13.320]  how inadequate these Democrats and Republicans are today because they're
[51:13.320 --> 51:17.200]  told how to vote by their political parties they don't need to know what's
[51:17.200 --> 51:22.600]  in a bill they get told from the higher echelon vote yes on this vote no on
[51:22.600 --> 51:27.920]  that well why would they subject themselves to all that additional reading if
[51:27.920 --> 51:31.200]  all they have if they're told how to vote in the first place well sir there's
[51:31.200 --> 51:37.000]  some breaking news on this front we have had listeners that have contacted Jim
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.280]  Gerlich his office that have contacted the other congressmen that you were able
[51:42.280 --> 51:47.080]  to talk to Steve Cohen of Tennessee and he sent a response out Gerlich did and
[51:47.080 --> 51:54.160]  said I was made aware of the legislation by Willow Grove Air Force base and he
[51:54.160 --> 51:58.080]  said the base is in the process of being decommissioned and would be an
[51:58.080 --> 52:02.400]  effective way for both saved jobs prepared for emergencies and he goes on
[52:02.400 --> 52:06.960]  to say citizens would not be held against their will but when you go to the
[52:06.960 --> 52:10.000]  urban warfare drills when you see what FEMA is training for when you read the
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.880]  bill it says any purpose that Homeland Security and FEMA see fit and you
[52:15.880 --> 52:20.920]  confront them you I mean what I mean maybe Gerlich is ignorant but but watching
[52:20.920 --> 52:25.600]  the body language of Cohen and then watching him laugh and once you hand
[52:25.600 --> 52:30.800]  him the bill and say oh actually I do know about this I mean talk about a
[52:30.800 --> 52:36.240]  Perry Mason moment governor but I mean specifically what was it like when he
[52:36.240 --> 52:40.240]  brought up the camps in the bill and then he just says oh big big aliens green
[52:40.240 --> 52:45.440]  man people coming down in machines yeah they won't they make light of it they they
[52:45.440 --> 52:50.240]  want to they just laugh it off with you like it's much to do about nothing why
[52:50.240 --> 52:55.560]  are you concerned about this I've told you there's no problem so I guess you're
[52:55.560 --> 53:00.360]  just supposed to believe this elected person you know it's don't believe your
[53:00.360 --> 53:06.080]  lying eyes Alex when you go and like I haven't visually see them and then you
[53:06.080 --> 53:10.520]  actually use your eyes to read the bill it's almost like they're saying to you
[53:10.520 --> 53:16.640]  oh don't don't believe your lying eyes I'll give you the answer here well you've
[53:16.640 --> 53:20.960]  you've made history no one has ever put this together on national television and
[53:20.960 --> 53:25.360]  that's another issue how are you getting this on television I don't know you
[53:25.360 --> 53:31.280]  know let's give two TV credit and Mark Juris they added that work because he
[53:31.280 --> 53:36.240]  told me unequivocally at dinner he said there's never been any thought that your
[53:36.240 --> 53:42.480]  shows would not go on from the moment we contracted to do them and not so you
[53:42.480 --> 53:47.840]  know I don't you know I never believed they'd go on either well tell you maybe
[53:47.840 --> 53:52.280]  the powers to be are so arrogant now that they're to the point where it
[53:52.280 --> 53:57.360]  doesn't matter anymore whether we know now or not I agree I think that's
[53:57.360 --> 54:02.200]  probably 50% of it the rest is they they operate through our ignorance our
[54:02.200 --> 54:07.160]  compartmentalization and a lot of people in media in the power structure really
[54:07.160 --> 54:10.960]  aren't part of the elite and so the globalist can't come out on in every
[54:10.960 --> 54:15.080]  case and stop something from getting on air now they always just counted on
[54:15.080 --> 54:20.040]  people self-censoring or saying oh I don't believe that right well let's
[54:20.040 --> 54:24.620]  remember to what Albert Einstein said that it applies greatly to the United
[54:24.620 --> 54:29.720]  States of America Albert Einstein's quote a foolish faith and authority is
[54:29.720 --> 54:35.560]  the enemy of the truth and that's what we have in this country our egos we have
[54:35.560 --> 54:39.720]  this foolish faith and authority that authority would never do anything to
[54:39.720 --> 54:44.960]  harm us authority is always good it has our best interest in mind well I got
[54:44.960 --> 54:52.440]  news for you you can be deceived you can elect evil people you know they can
[54:52.440 --> 54:57.120]  deceive you they will portray to you something that they are not you've all
[54:57.120 --> 55:04.320]  seen pro wrestling well pro wrestling isn't too far from politics absolutely
[55:04.320 --> 55:08.600]  let me add one more point in girlics response to constituents he says
[55:08.600 --> 55:12.600]  however as I made clear to mr. Ventura I am more than happy to address any
[55:12.600 --> 55:18.280]  potential problems with the legislation and so he never spoke to me no no he
[55:18.280 --> 55:22.840]  says he says he told you one time to come and that you didn't come so he's
[55:22.840 --> 55:28.120]  lying we went there twice you see it right on the film no I know so he's I
[55:28.120 --> 55:33.000]  never spoke to him I wouldn't know him if he walked up to me right now I spoke
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.680]  to his one of his couple of his people they informed me that he left to go back
[55:37.680 --> 55:41.680]  to his constituency and that he wouldn't be able to see me and that's at the time
[55:41.680 --> 55:44.400]  that you'd agreed to meet with him knows clearly they've been caught they were
[55:44.400 --> 55:49.240]  apologetic on the video clearly you went twice when they said be there and when
[55:49.240 --> 55:53.600]  they found out you were there at the office suddenly he disappeared out the
[55:53.600 --> 56:00.080]  back door yeah and now he's saying that I didn't show up yeah well you'll be the
[56:00.080 --> 56:04.400]  judge it's all unfilled you know I know it nobody just shows sir I don't think
[56:04.400 --> 56:09.280]  they're playing dumb okay I mean look everything in that emergency centers act
[56:09.280 --> 56:13.160]  is what they've already built what we documented years ago it's just the
[56:13.160 --> 56:17.040]  rolling out of it kind of like they were already wiretapping but then they
[56:17.040 --> 56:21.440]  retroactively made it legal absolutely I think it ties right into that old
[56:21.440 --> 56:27.680]  continuity of government Alex well which they've of course been rolling out
[56:27.680 --> 56:33.720]  since Ronald Reagan well I did notice that the ratings came out and for this
[56:33.720 --> 56:37.840]  season the police state had the highest ratings of any of the shows which again
[56:37.840 --> 56:42.440]  certifies the truth shows the people are hungry for hardcore news I hope the JFK
[56:42.440 --> 56:47.880]  special tonight tops it all 9 o'clock central 10 p.m. Eastern and lobby true
[56:47.880 --> 56:52.240]  TV and tell them rear that police state tonight I mean come on I thought that
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.240]  was Aaron at 8 that is that just blew me away the water specials coming up
[56:56.240 --> 57:01.680]  with also the BP special you and I down there in the gulf yeah and we also go
[57:01.680 --> 57:05.680]  back to 9 11 and we'll focus on the alleged plane that hit the Pentagon
[57:05.680 --> 57:11.440]  unbelievable well governor we've only got about two minutes left any other
[57:11.440 --> 57:19.680]  tidbits on the TSA on the JFK I just like to say Alex again I'm making my
[57:19.680 --> 57:24.400]  stand I'm not going to fly commercial anymore in the United States because of
[57:24.400 --> 57:29.840]  you know I explained all that and so until the policy changes I don't know
[57:29.840 --> 57:34.480]  you know I can't state the future of the show now they're all done this year but
[57:34.480 --> 57:39.120]  of course I have to fly in which to do them and certainly I don't believe they
[57:39.120 --> 57:44.720]  have the budget to fly me in a private jet so it may be curtains for the show I
[57:44.720 --> 57:51.920]  don't know but if it is whatever it's a stamp that I feel I must make I hope
[57:51.920 --> 57:58.000]  people respect my decision but I feel I have to make it and so Alex I guess I
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.560]  won't see you anymore unless we're driving oh man I always enjoy hanging out
[58:02.560 --> 58:07.360]  with you you know but I've got to make a stand because again I'm in a worse
[58:07.360 --> 58:12.320]  predicament because I set the things off every time no no I understand and
[58:12.320 --> 58:15.920]  watching you go I mean you sat there while you were being searched in front of
[58:15.920 --> 58:19.200]  me with the other hands all over you said this is like East Germany that's

[1:00:50.760 --> 1:00:56.360]  here he's getting ready to go back to Mexico next week and you also heard it
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:01.520]  breaking news here that he will not be flying commercial anymore and let me
[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:04.560]  tell you they patted him down when I flown with him for like 10 minutes they
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:08.800]  go up the legs all over and that was a few months ago now it's got to be hands
[1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:14.960]  in the pants and the hotels the theme parks they don't want to lose the
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:18.920]  business but the globalist have said they want to make air travel harder they
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:21.400]  want to make it restrictive with checkpoints they want to put carbon
[1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:25.440]  taxes on it and ban non-essential travel that's why they're going to put
[1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:29.120]  transponders in all the cars and satellite tracker boxes the feds have
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:31.360]  openly announced this they're now getting ready everybody ready for it
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:35.880]  attacks you by the mile they want you bankrupt they're waging war against the
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:40.320]  real economy we've got to stop them now because if they just incrementally do
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:45.480]  this they're gonna win this is now the biggest story in the country and we're
[1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:50.120]  gonna get into a bunch of other just really important news coming up after
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:56.720]  the break before I get to all of your phone calls but you heard Ventura he's
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:02:03.960]  being abused by the TSA he's being violated so he is done he is done with
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:07.640]  it and we're gonna give that mp3 of the first two segments where he talked
[1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:12.040]  about that to Curtin Emo who's doing a story for info wars dot com we're
[1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:15.480]  getting that processed right that piece of audio for him fantastic great job
[1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:25.240]  crew also this is the first anniversary of climate gate this is when climate
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:31.600]  gate really broke and of course on this day last year we were popping champagne
[1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:36.920]  on air knowing that we had blown up the Death Star as I put it but James
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:40.480]  Corbett Corbett reports on a great little ten minute video that if I have
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:44.120]  time later towards the end of the next hour I'm gonna play it if not it's up
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:49.800]  on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but but that's that's news that
[1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:56.800]  a celebrity a former governor a TV host and believe me it's not talk Ventura is
[1:02:56.800 --> 1:03:09.840]  very committed stubborn jackass like I am too a jackass isn't a common term
[1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:13.520]  jackass a jackass is a donkey and if the donkey doesn't want to move it's not
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:17.520]  gonna move actually I actually like him and I'm the same way to a certain
[1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:22.480]  extent and that's what made this country great is the stubbornness in the face of
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:28.320]  tyranny and I mean if a donkey doesn't want to move folks you can be it over
[1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:32.600]  the head with a two by four there's stories about that in the Bible where
[1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:36.120]  the guy's beating his donkey's death because the donkey sees an angel up
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:39.520]  ahead on the road and the guy hadn't seen it yet the donkey won't move the guy's
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:44.920]  beating it over the head because I guess me and Ventura a pair of jackasses
[1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:55.080]  but the issue is though seriously Americans Americans ought to be like
[1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:59.160]  that I mean look we're done I don't care what I'm all the fancy talk I don't care
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:03.520]  what you say we're not get rid of this stuff and I like how he says at the end
[1:04:03.520 --> 1:04:09.280]  of his police state episode last week I said it before and I'll say it again I
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:18.920] 'd rather face the danger than give up my liberties so Jesse Ventura is a great
[1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:23.720]  guy and he's really smart and he learns more and more about the new order all
[1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:27.600]  the time and it's it's always scary when he comes back from Mexico's he's right
[1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:31.480]  another 20 30 bucks he didn't really watch TV down there and he comes back
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:36.040]  with even more knowledge so that's air at 9 o'clock let's make a JFK deathbed

[1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:13.840]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:17.840]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:05:17.840 --> 1:05:22.160]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:26.520]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:30.280]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:05:30.280 --> 1:05:34.400]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:38.360]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:30.760]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:36.160]  we're live ladies and gentlemen there's a lot of crazy news going on I heard a
[1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:43.360]  liberal talk show host this morning in Austin giddy with primitive war fever
[1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:50.120]  just absolutely getting incredibly excited over the prospects of war in
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:09:00.560]  Mexico and clearly the crisis on the border with the United States and
[1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:05.040]  Mexico does warrant serious hardcore military we need a hundred thousand
[1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:08.600]  troops on that border more people have died on that border in the last two
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:14.360]  years then would die in two years in the Vietnam War at its height 28 plus
[1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:22.200]  thousand and growing and it's all swept under the rug but Governor Rick Perry
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:25.840]  who's running for president you can absolutely believe that when he says
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:30.920]  he's not running for president asking why he's a liar in the next year when he
[1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:37.320]  announces with him and little Sarah Palin I wonder what they're going to be
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:42.480]  doing in the Lincoln bedroom I mean give me a break Perry says he considers
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:48.120]  military in Mexico that's the San Antonio Express news today he said it on
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:53.840]  television last night Governor Rick Perry who continues to insist he's not
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:56.720]  interested in the presidency is nevertheless always ready to tell the
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:10:02.520]  federal government how to do its job on such matters as border security
[1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:07.800]  including indicating he and the US should be open to sending military into
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:11.760]  Mexico to help fight the drug war and I'm going to go over more of his quotes
[1:10:11.760 --> 1:10:14.640]  in fact let's pull it up on YouTube what he actually said to play that a
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:23.000]  little bit later I meant to tell the crew that here's the problem the Mexican
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:29.200]  military and the Mexican governors and the Mexican Congress almost to a man are
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:33.440]  involved in the narcotics trafficking you can go to Mexico and watch the
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:40.200]  military tending and growing and guarding the marijuana the Mexican
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:43.840]  military has been caught over and over again shipping cocaine heroin into the
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:52.320]  US the people the Mexican military are killing our cartels and cowboys and
[1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:58.960]  coyotes coyotes who are smuggling it and not paying their cut their small time
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:03.520]  people just like the mafia in New York or Chicago if you go back 50 years ago
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:09.040]  of some small time group was trying to bring drugs on the streets they'd get
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:16.760]  filled full of holes or they get cement shoes so I wanted to briefly just
[1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:21.680]  break down the facts and I've had sociologist anthropologist on State
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:25.720]  Department experts none of this is my opinion okay and I lived down here in
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:30.320]  Texas I told folks six seven years ago it was a war zone when the media was
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:35.280]  denying it we've had car bombs rocket attacks in Texas police being killed
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:39.280]  it's all swept under the rug and it's getting worse and worse last year I had
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:44.080]  a state senator on who admitted on air that martial law has quietly already
[1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:48.920]  been declared as of the middle of last year almost a year and a half ago on the
[1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:55.520]  Texas Mexico border the military has pulled back 10 miles off the borders as
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:00.360]  of three months ago from Arizona to Texas they've seated 80 miles into
[1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:04.880]  Arizona areas of the state to drug cartels and the feds have put up signs
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:11.000]  saying don't go into these areas drug cartels in the area when sheriffs that
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.560]  I've had on this show from Texas have caught truckloads of marijuana and
[1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:19.040]  cocaine in some cases three to six miles in both cases one was three one was
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:24.240]  six over the US Mexican troops drive over in armored vehicles and stop our
[1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:28.560]  police on highways with machine guns and say give it back or your dad and they
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:34.560]  escort it back the federal government knows this so when all even the
[1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:38.640]  liberals get giddy about the idea of a war and say let's go help the Mexican
[1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:42.880]  military stop the drug cartels do you understand that there's already
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:47.320]  billions and billions a year in US government funds to Mexico and to
[1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:52.240]  Calderon to launch this attack against the other cartels that's caused this war
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:58.160]  to explode so this will be adding gasoline to it now if you want to put
[1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:02.640]  the military on the border and next time Mexican troops shoot at ranchers or our
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:07.360]  police or a military and you want to have warthogs a tens fly up and down
[1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:12.880]  destroying all their vehicles I'm all for that when Mexico commits an act of
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:18.360]  war next time I say have Abrams tanks lined up I say have a 10 warthogs just
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:23.720]  10 or so every state on the border and in 10 minutes they can have crews ready
[1:13:23.720 --> 1:13:30.000]  and launch those and fly up and any Mexican columns of trucks or personnel
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:35.120]  kill them all how's that sound you want a war that's righteous and good
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:39.640]  Mexico's running all over this country that's what armies are for is to defend
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:44.960]  your border instead of having a tens flying around killing innocent Iraqis
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:50.080]  and Afghans and people let's talk about the real threat the Mexican government
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:55.040]  is a narco terrorist criminal state that abuses and dominates its own people and
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:14:01.120]  the criminal banks that run this country are using the criminal families in
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:05.160]  Mexico to rule and to squeeze the good hard-working people in Mexico and
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:10.000]  they're sick of it and this war down there is more about a rebellion than a
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:16.320]  quote drug war that's only the surface so I stand with the Mexican people who
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:19.600]  don't hate the United States and understand that criminal interests run
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:23.400]  the US just like their country and I stand for Mexico to have liberty I'd
[1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:27.560]  love Mexico to get a bill of rights and Constitution root out corruption it'd
[1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:32.200]  be a wonderful place to live it's beautiful it's wealthy when it comes to
[1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:37.160]  natural resources but Mexico isn't going to get fixed and the US is going to
[1:14:37.160 --> 1:14:40.520]  collapse right along with it if we allow them to send the military down into
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:46.360]  Mexico that's our military being sent to back up the main drug cartel the
[1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:53.800]  Mexican government to secure their monopoly of the 500 billion in heroin
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:58.200]  and cocaine and marijuana coming in every year now what's the real solution
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:03.640]  staring everyone in the face that would end almost all of this crime overnight
[1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:08.720]  so many criminal criminal enterprises have been grown through this and have
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:12.520]  been funded they're gonna find new things to do but it won't be half as bad
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:18.960]  what do you do do you send the military down to fight a bunch of people that are
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:24.480]  in plain clothes in a guerrilla war and when the smaller cartels have bought
[1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:29.880]  off most of the police and the military because the military brass and the
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:33.040]  governors they're cheap they don't pay off their troops to not be involved in
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:36.480]  drugs because they want all the money for themselves they don't share it
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:41.440]  they're not smart in their corruption the lower level cartels will pay off the
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:45.680]  police and military that's why they can't be beaten this is a nightmare
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:50.280]  quagmire not one of our troops should be sent over that border unless it's in
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:57.040]  an A-10 warthog to open up on those armored columns and by the way you
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:01.280]  don't need to shoot a DU around to go through their armor they've got non DU
[1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:05.680]  rounds they can use exploding rounds fired out of that Vulcan cannon do not
[1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:11.280]  fire DU down there you do not need DU you're not fighting T-72 Russian tanks
[1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:18.400]  with seven-inch armor you can just fire explosive rounds or regular lead rounds
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:23.400]  at those suckers send them in send in a hundred warthogs they'll clean up that
[1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:27.640]  border in a matter of hours and of them and of the Mexican Air Force wants to
[1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:34.400]  get it on send in the F-15s the F-16s send in the B-2 bombers hit their
[1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:39.040]  air bases blow them to kingdom come but see our military won't be used for
[1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:42.800]  something real to defend our country like George Washington would do you know
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:46.520]  what George Washington would do right now no our military's got to go pick on
[1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:49.720]  people thousands of miles away because they want to steal their oil and get
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:54.800]  their opium same reason they want us to now go into Mexico to back up their
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:17:00.720]  criminal government now what do you do to end all this overnight you decriminalize
[1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:06.200]  heroin and cocaine like it was 80 plus years ago let me see they're sort of
[1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:12.680]  criminalizing it by 1932-33 so how many years is that yeah you're talking 80
[1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:21.200]  years or close to it you could buy pure cocaine pure heroin at the drug store
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:25.680]  and there were far fewer people on it because it was looked down upon people
[1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:28.360]  knew how dangerous it was but if you wanted to go kill yourself go ahead
[1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:34.560]  that's a free society what if they lose in 33 what have they just gotten rid of
[1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:38.360]  prohibition they couldn't the corrupt cops the corrupt FBI the corrupt
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:42.480]  government making hundreds of millions of dollars in every major city and that
[1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:46.480]  was back in those numbers off the speakeasies they it was it wasn't the
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:50.240]  Christians that got liquor outlawed they were the useful idiots it was the big
[1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:54.320]  distillers and the corrupt governments that wanted that and when they lost their
[1:17:54.320 --> 1:17:58.960]  prohibition you know where they could make 10 20 times what they could
[1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:03.640]  previously when liquor was legal they needed something news they made marijuana
[1:18:03.640 --> 1:18:09.640]  cocaine and heroin illegal so they could jack up the price again who set up
[1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:13.800]  skull and bones who set up the CIA admittedly the main families that
[1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:18.560]  controlled opium in this country this is like ABC news this is not my opinion
[1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:23.960]  this is absolute fact the drug dealers make the drugs illegal the drug dealers
[1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:30.200]  want the drugs illegal you decriminalize now you don't sell it over the
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:35.760]  counter but if somebody's an addict they can go get a slip of paper from the
[1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:38.720]  government and go get it and then something else happens they stop
[1:18:38.720 --> 1:18:44.240]  breaking in your house for your stereo computer for grandma's painting all
[1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:50.400]  these all these pawn shops fencing all the stolen goods will dry up all this
[1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:58.400]  scum will just blow away I've seen the criminology reports over 90% of home
[1:18:58.400 --> 1:19:05.040]  invasions and thefts and carjackings and muggings are drug related you don't see
[1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:08.680]  why knows out knocking people over the head very often for money no they can
[1:19:08.680 --> 1:19:13.120]  just panhandle because the because the beer's cheap the whiskey's cheap let me
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:17.760]  tell you if whiskey was $200 a bottle instead of $7 a bottle for that rot
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:21.040]  gut they drink you'd have homeless people breaking in houses like a bunch of
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:26.560]  zombies you see the crackhead zombies breaking in houses because that stuff's
[1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:33.400]  expensive this is a scourge of crime so no Perry we don't send our troops down
[1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:37.520]  there to secure the drugs for your globalist buddies decriminalize Perry
[1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:42.680]  decriminalize if you really want to be tough call for the warthogs to be
[1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:50.320]  brought in 10 a 10s per state 20 miles from the border the crews waiting in
[1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:57.560]  their shacks the bombs the missiles the gatlin guns loaded send up some send up

[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:48.080]  in turn will no longer fly due to abuse he's endured at the hands of the TSA and
[1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:52.320]  he says it may put an end to his career very powerful stuff we're doing the
[1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:57.640]  search term JFK deathbed confession for this bombshell TV show out tonight let's
[1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:00.800]  go ahead now and go to your phone calls and I've got economic and police state
[1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:04.720]  news coming up but this issue with Perry getting ready to run for president got
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:11.280]  his new book out it's gonna be him and Palin you just watch and he said let's
[1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:17.440]  get tough let's send our Marines down into Mexico the government's corrupt
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:24.200]  they're the main drug dealers and you know that the government knows that Rick
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:28.760]  Perry trying to make girls take Gardasil shots that are deadly Rick Perry tried to
[1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:33.040]  push through NAFTA and get style super highways and steal all this property I
[1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:39.480]  mean the guys is conservative as Mao Zedong let's go ahead but hey you know
[1:25:39.480 --> 1:25:45.720]  he looks like the bad guy from Scarface so you know what's wrong with that and
[1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:49.600]  you know he wears fancy suits he's got a Texas accent it must be good Becky in
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:26:00.320]  Ohio you're on the air welcome okay I went to get on my flight out this is
[1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:08.640]  happening by Alice but some guy got ahead of me in the line and actually took my
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:15.840]  feet on the plane and they stopped it once and then Sturges went back and
[1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:19.960]  said there's some man there she didn't check his ticket or anything and then
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:23.880]  when they took me back out to the plane the pilot said no I've shut the doors
[1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:29.800]  we're not gonna stop the plane and I lost my feet he was probably air
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:34.960]  Marshall I don't know but they said it is stand by or something but they
[1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:39.160]  wouldn't even check him they wouldn't make him get off the plane nothing well
[1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:45.080]  it's all about not giving a service you know I've read corporate studies that
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:50.280]  were done back in the 50s and 60s when McDonald's put out trash cans saying
[1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:54.680]  thank you well why not make you cook your own food people think you're getting a
[1:26:54.680 --> 1:26:58.040]  better deal by cleaning up your own food no you're just destroying jobs in the
[1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:03.520]  economy and lowering the overall standard of service just like gas stations
[1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:08.200]  that didn't have service pumps well now they estimate we lose billions of
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:11.800]  year and people not checking their water not getting their oil checked you know
[1:27:11.800 --> 1:27:15.760]  not getting service it kills those entry-level jobs we need to demand more
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:20.840]  service as a country and and that creates more jobs and then more service
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:25.080]  and then more jobs instead they're getting rid of the entire economy with
[1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:30.920]  globalism and automation the only part of the economy growing is government
[1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:35.080]  Becky I'm sorry to hear that happen to you let's talk to Sean in Oregon Sean
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:42.000]  you're on the air good go ahead I've been thinking about these the body skinners
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:47.760]  and how we can make it more powerful to the public and we covered the the mobile
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:53.080]  x-ray vans a couple months ago and if we could get those into everybody's mind I
[1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:57.080]  think that would just put it over the top and just destroy it by the way I have a
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:02.640]  story about that here today and I agree with you out in Denver where they have
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:07.600]  one of the mobile TSA vans it's an 18-wheeler trailer that they drive around
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:11.640]  and naked body scan people with this is already begun it's in courthouses you
[1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:16.400]  name it and they report that they caught employees having sex in it so that's the
[1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:21.040]  only reason it's news it's not coming it's already here it's just going to be
[1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:25.840]  expanded it's like Ventura was saying well I've got a replaced hip that's why
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:31.120]  they always fill me up I'm not doing it anymore well they the TSA has said this
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:37.000]  will be for everyone in El Paso the El Paso Times reported four months ago or
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:42.760]  three months ago that that they're already doing it so so that they're
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:47.920]  already forcing everyone in in a major Texas airport to do it here it is it's
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:54.120]  Denver Airport mobile command used for sex and I mean that's what they do I
[1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:57.320]  mean it's just a bunch of slobs anything else
[1:28:57.320 --> 1:29:02.160]  oh exactly I mean if we can get Fox News to come in they ran their
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:05.680]  video story about the TSA you know going around and shooting those things into
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:09.200]  people's walls people people flip their gasket thinking that they're gonna be
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:11.760]  driving around and searching their cars and stuff like that well it's been in
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:14.720]  Forbes that they've got 500 trucks driving around looking through your
[1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:21.680]  walls and that's those systems are so high-powered they dwarf a regular chest
[1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:26.440]  x-ray I mean there's no doubt that that's like super high-powered it seems
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:30.480]  like people are okay with it at the airport because they don't fly but if
[1:29:30.480 --> 1:29:34.040]  they realize that they're gonna be you know at that checkpoint searching their
[1:29:34.040 --> 1:29:38.320]  cars for drugs and shooting their kids in the backseat full x-rays then there's
[1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:41.800]  no escaping I hear a lot of people saying well I just won't fly then well if
[1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:46.280]  this is still coming you know that just gave me a very important idea I'm gonna
[1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:49.440]  talk about when we get back stay with us

[1:32:07.360 --> 1:32:10.720]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:14.600]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:32:14.600 --> 1:32:18.820]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[1:32:18.820 --> 1:32:23.280]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:28.000]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:31.800]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:35.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:17.200]  leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:24.400]  the GCN radio network we are back live ladies and gentlemen and I want to get
[1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:28.320]  people's attention here we know we're going into tyranny we know the world
[1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:35.440]  economy is being imploded we know that our society is going in the wrong
[1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:40.760]  direction we understand that it's up to us now to get the word out to people and
[1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:46.560]  what's old news is new news to people that aren't aware of the fellow reserve
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:50.400]  being private or aren't aware that in upstate New York and other areas they
[1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:57.400]  have the National Guard out running x-ray scanners over cars and the TSA has
[1:33:57.400 --> 1:34:02.640]  mobile trucks where they're training to put citizens through checkpoints we have
[1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:08.280]  to get the word out to people and Tim here in the office just came and gave me
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:11.040]  this little air horn he said I thought you might want this he said watch out
[1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:14.840]  it's really loud so I'm gonna press this here open and break the microphone to
[1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:19.520]  get people's attention you know to to to basically underline and highlight how
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:28.160]  serious this information is that loud I guess I'm already I guess I'm already so
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:34.840]  deaf though from years of radio with too high a headphones on
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:45.160]  it's like a boat horn or something okay folks getting serious here and getting
[1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:50.240]  back into your phone calls I want to get into the economy here in a moment
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:56.440]  obviously huge developments on that front but first let's continue with your
[1:34:56.440 --> 1:35:03.160]  phone calls who's up next year Victoria in Montana you're on the air welcome
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:07.880]  thank you Alex I just wanted to say thank you for all that you do and let you
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:14.760]  know I'm an avid prison planet subscriber and I have two things for you the
[1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:19.200]  first one is if our government really wanted to take care of the border
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:23.600]  problems with Mexico and stop the illegal immigrant traffic from coming into
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:27.480]  the United States over the border all they would have to do is station our
[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:32.200]  military on the border and it would stop that problem overnight but instead they
[1:35:32.200 --> 1:35:36.480]  want to use our troops to enslave the American people and all these FEMA
[1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:40.240]  camps that they've been you know stationing all over the nation that I
[1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:50.760]  saw on Governor's show last Friday and also they they're enslaving the people
[1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:55.840]  and other nations for the Federal Reserve system the bankers robbing the
[1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:00.240]  people of their national of their resources and making them indentured
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:04.800]  slaves for life in their own country this is all about money and control and
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:08.920]  they're not trying to help anything and the other thing that I was looking at
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:14.080]  was Gerald Salente yesterday he was talking about real education being the
[1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:18.240]  key to the infill war and instead of what they're doing in the schools and I
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:22.920]  totally agree with that since I was in there briefly and got out of that so
[1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:28.960]  another thing that that I did this past week I created like six articles that
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:32.920]  are free showing parents how to recognize whether their child is like a
[1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:38.680]  visual auditory tactile or a kinesthetic learner and then giving them some tips
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:43.360]  on how to help their children learn any kind of information they want to a lot
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:49.240]  easier once they recognize which type of learner they really are so if it's okay
[1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:57.760]  I'll give this site out where people can get that it's on www.fonixreadingpro.com
[1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:05.200]  and it's the last six that I put up so that they could learn that but tell me
[1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:08.520]  what do you think about stationing our troops on the border to protect our
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:12.560]  country instead of all the other countries no absolutely it's common
[1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:16.000]  sense it's what the military is for everything the federal government's
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:19.320]  supposed to do they won't do everything they're not supposed to do and barred by
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:22.040]  law from doing they do do because they're a bunch of tyrants
[1:37:22.040 --> 1:37:25.760]  Ruth in Louisiana you're on the air thanks for holding
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:34.680]  hello Alex hey Ruth I hope you have a nice Thanksgiving you too and I'm
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:40.960]  always praying for you and praying for just been touring everything else this
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:48.520]  is a deal you know my mother used to say talk is cheap you can't have your cake
[1:37:48.520 --> 1:37:55.400]  you need it too and what we need to do now there's going to be approximately 20
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:38:14.040]  need people flying for the holiday well that's what's happening yeah that'll
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:18.360]  bring these people that'll bring them to their knees and you know speaking of
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:24.120]  that a few days ago they had this supposed bomb on the German plane and
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:28.480]  then it was the telltale side oh they're not sure if it's a bomb and now some
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:32.840]  unnamed government did a drill and that's mainstream news today and put a
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:38.040]  fake bomb on it but they won't say who now now and and something hit me wait a
[1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:41.880]  minute they knew that there were supposedly cartridge bombs a few weeks
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:48.160]  ago right before the election they're mailed to England the bomb experts
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:51.880]  tested to say it's not a bomb and Obama comes out an hour later and says it is a
[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:57.280]  bomb the US tells them tested again like no we know that's a bomb because we
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:03.040]  mailed it you know that's the one thing they left out so so again it's all just
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:08.360]  drills they use these drills to basically carry out these operations it's
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:12.080]  always the same and so Germany's like imminent terror attack imminent terror
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:16.600]  attack and then there's a drill of a fake bomb but they use it for a day and a
[1:39:16.600 --> 1:39:20.400]  half to scare everybody and then come out quietly and say by the way it was
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:24.360]  just a drill and so this is like all these fake terror attack drills they
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:35.160]  have are to condition people to accept all this well I just wish people would
[1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:40.800]  just stop flying period I hear you ma'am and I appreciate your call the issue is
[1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:46.920]  though it's very nuanced they want us to slowly quit traveling slowly quit
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:50.760]  front-flying as they reorganize things but they don't want it to happen
[1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:56.160]  immediately because that upsets their agenda and the way they've got this
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:40:02.080]  put into phases so yes if people stop flying immediately in large enough
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:07.760]  numbers they will at least back off for a while then they'll come back I remember
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:11.520]  it's got to be eight nine years ago reading mainstream news articles about a
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:24.200]  big RFID symposium that was going on up in Chicago and it was it was it was
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:27.920]  transcripts of the big speeches they were giving and then the head of it
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:32.760]  was saying look our internal studies show that 80 plus percent of people hate
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:36.920]  these RFID and all their products tracking everything they do but our
[1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:40.760]  studies also show that if we just demand it and push it through and ignore what
[1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:45.800]  they say and do they'll just get into it so the key is we've got to just keep
[1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:50.200]  pushing and hammering and never stop well that's what we've got to do it's
[1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:54.440]  whoever wants it most they want this control grid they want to take over
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:41:05.000]  society they want to dominate and control everything we need to continue to
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:10.680]  expose them to document what they're doing and to resist them and it's just
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:16.320]  that simple okay let's go ahead and go back to another caller James and
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:22.080]  Michigan James are on the air good I just want to first say I appreciate you
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:26.680]  what you're doing and your crew I highly respect all you guys you guys are
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:31.040]  brave enough to go after the main corruption of our system another thing
[1:41:31.040 --> 1:41:36.600]  I want to bring up to is we need to get the word out about Jesse Ventura not
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:42.720]  wanting to fly and that we got tons and tons of jet people that own jets and
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:48.640]  planes people should all contribute to get him to fly privately so he doesn't
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:54.960]  have to get screened like he is absolutely I mean this is for all of
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:42:01.480]  us think what's coming next if we don't say no to this now James right and he's
[1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:06.400]  the only one that has publicized on TV and we need them if we don't have him
[1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:12.200]  we're done good point anything else that'll be it I appreciate everything you
[1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:15.160]  guys are doing Alex you have a good day I appreciate you Jeff we're gonna
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:20.880]  continue or James we're gonna continue with Jeff J Jackie Pat and others after
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:27.160]  the break but I want to get back into the TSA some next hour with Bob Chapman
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:30.960]  because they're really coming out with this info now they're really trying to
[1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:35.280]  get off of the defensive into the offensive with with more lies more
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:43.280]  propaganda TSA list myths facts about passenger security measures and we're
[1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:46.120]  gonna be going over this because it's just more lies these people are
[1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:50.480]  unbelievable but it doesn't matter I mean just a couple weeks ago they said
[1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:53.520]  we're not patting your genitals now they admit they're even going in your pants
[1:42:53.520 --> 1:42:58.480]  or they say oh there's no radiation danger or they say they don't save the
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:06.920]  images it's just lies lies lies new lies for old now looking at the economy here
[1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:13.960]  is French news agency World Trade Organization chief warns against
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:19.560]  currency wars the private WTO the globalist organization all part of this
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:24.280]  program deindustrialized the big banks have set up the currency wars to devalue
[1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:28.400]  currency that's a global devaluation on a currency war and we told you it was
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:31.800]  coming the head of the World Trade Organization today warned countries
[1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:35.080]  against keeping their currencies undervalued to create jobs saying such
[1:43:35.080 --> 1:43:38.800]  policies could spark a return to 1930s style protectionism they mean
[1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:44.280]  depression and it goes on from there Bernanke takes aim at China Wall Street
[1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:48.600]  Journal Federal Reserve chairman Bernanke fired back and criticism home and
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:52.440]  abroad of the feds easy money policies arguing that China and others are
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:55.560]  causing global problems by preventing their currencies from strengthening as
[1:43:55.560 --> 1:44:01.000]  their economies boom by keeping their currencies are officially weak mr. Bernanke
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:05.040]  argued in Frankfurt Friday China and other emerging markets are allowing
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:10.240]  their economies to overheat preventing trade imbalances from adjusting and
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:13.920]  worsening the so-called two-speed global economy that they've already done
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:17.680]  that the globalist always again oh we've got a currency problem we need a
[1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:22.640]  global government the global currency oh China's got too low of a currency in too
[1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:26.680]  many factories they made deals with them they did this they knew I mean that's
[1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:29.760]  like Greenspan talking about we need to get rid of the criminality in banking
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:32.840]  when he's one of the heads of it and got rid of the Glass-Steagall he helped
[1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:41.080]  engineer that so we've got that and all the jobless list numbers point pouring
[1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:46.880]  in before I go further though I've seen a whole bunch of news articles and I've
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:51.640]  talked to people in my friends my family my neighbors they say that every coin
[1:44:51.640 --> 1:44:55.680]  shop in the town I live in is out of coins out of silver out of gold out of
[1:44:55.680 --> 1:45:01.280]  everything a lot of big gold dealers and silver dealers are out or charging huge
[1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:08.320]  premiums right now so you saw gold shoot up over 1400 silver up to you know 29
[1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:12.200]  then it went down a little now it's gone starting to go back up again but
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:18.400]  that's the digital manipulated market in the real market worldwide gold and
[1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:27.720]  silver physical holdings are drying up are disappearing that's exactly what
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:31.680]  Max Kaiser was talking about by the physical gold and silver selling out
[1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:35.680]  almost everywhere that indicates that it should be even higher because people
[1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:39.680]  are flooding out of currencies and in paper into gold and silver and it's
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:42.720]  only what two and a half three percent now was just one percent a few years
[1:45:42.720 --> 1:45:46.560]  ago when you get up to five six percent starting to go into gold and silver of
[1:45:46.560 --> 1:45:50.960]  the general public out of a hundred percent it's gonna be unbelievable now
[1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:56.520]  wanted to bring Ted Anderson up to break down this simple fact for folks Alex
[1:45:56.520 --> 1:45:59.680]  I'm right here with you and I've been listening to you know explain what this
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:03.480]  means I mean there's a big article yesterday Patrick Heller put out that
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:07.880]  there's a silver bar shortage and it's also happening in the coin market I
[1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:12.520]  know right now US Eagles are just almost impossible to buy I've been trying to
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:15.680]  find them all over the place for my wholesalers I think I'll have to wait
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:23.080]  till next year to get a decent supply on them in the year 2010 or to 2011 when
[1:46:23.080 --> 1:46:27.000]  they come out it's just all over the place widespread like you said dealers
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:31.880]  just don't have supply especially small little coin shops that you know people
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:35.160]  walk in the door they buy what they have they can't replace it it's a big
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:39.040]  problem out there because people want gold and silver they're not fooled by
[1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:42.800]  what's going on out here Bernanke right now is trying to tell everybody in
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:47.160]  Europe that we need to continue on with this quantitative easing which I just
[1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:53.120]  today the Federal Reserve stepped in and bought 2.169 billion dollars in US
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:58.080]  government Treasury debt just today just just for Friday I mean it's just and
[1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:03.160]  the globalist this is key the globalist are going to blame America for this but
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:08.640]  they're offshore using us to to basically take over the planet through their
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:13.800]  fractional reserve currency but dollar devaluation in the last few years has
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:17.960]  led to these other economies to start devaluation of their currencies because
[1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:21.760]  the dollar is the world reserve currency now that they're lowering the Federal
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:25.480]  Reserve blames them and claims the economic problems are being caused by
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:30.440]  that it's being caused by the globalist it sure as Alex it's been caused by the
[1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:34.760]  globalist and it's just all a big plan and sovers reflecting the prices on that
[1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:39.640]  I mean we had silver at $25 an ounce here just a few days ago silver's almost
[1:47:39.640 --> 1:47:46.160]  at its peak again seeing a high today of $27 and 36 36 cents that's just a direct
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:50.600]  reflection on what the fiat money is doing I mean the currencies around the
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:54.880]  world are all coming down unilaterally and that's why gold and silver's been
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:58.680]  doing so well and they think that they can dupe us into thinking hey if we just
[1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:02.120]  suppress the prices for a couple of days people become convinced that it's
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:06.400]  better to stay and fiat money than it is to have the real gold and silver that
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:10.800]  it was intended for us by our father our founding fathers of this nation many
[1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:15.560]  years ago you know just you can't print money and expect that people are
[1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:18.440]  going to continue to believe that it's going to hold value that's why there's
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:22.400]  so much talk about inflation as a matter of fact there's lots of warnings
[1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:26.920]  coming to Ben Bernanke right now talking about hey you got to stop this QE2
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:30.920]  thing because we're going to see inflation here in this country and and
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:34.680]  that's that that's the news I mean I was looking at Bloomberg's top 10 stories
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:37.960]  and there's just like two or three that don't cover this inflation issue
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:42.800]  everything else is all about it and you know Alex everybody knows that you just
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:46.760]  simply can't run a printing press and expect the dollar to hold value well
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:50.480]  you've also got all the other globalists now positioning themselves like
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:54.480]  they're against what's happening when they're all part of the same group that's
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:58.160]  engineered this to have the head of the World Trade Organization say that this
[1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:05.320]  can cause 1930s style depression I mean that's what's happening Ted tell folks
[1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:08.840]  about today's gold and silver offer well I think the best way to get introduced
[1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:11.560]  to gold and silver I know you're thinking about gold and silver out there
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:14.360]  because people are calling us and they're actually buying from us with the
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:20.480]  market even lower which is really smart on their part but you know that $97 for
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:25.560]  the your three DVDs 97 bucks gets you the fall of the Republic endgame and
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:29.760]  Obama deception if you don't know what's going on watch those three videos pass
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:33.920]  them out make copies you know for 97 bucks you're gonna get three silver
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:38.240]  dollars it's just like the total win-win situation I haven't made a better deal
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:42.600]  than that completely off hands down since I've been in business I've been in it
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:47.600]  for 30 years the rest of it I mean British sovereigns right now at 369
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:52.640]  Franks are at 294 they've all come down a little now is the time to buy but if
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:56.240]  you're looking at getting started and you just want to be you know introduced
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:01.520]  to gold and silver I can't make this easier for you $97 and we do accept
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:05.760]  credit cards for that you're gonna get that's delivered three silver let me
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:09.280]  let me fire this out silver and gold going back up people need to take
[1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:13.400]  advantage of this but the issue is you have silver and gold and incredibly low
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:17.200]  prices the radio offers some of the best deals you'll find anywhere where this is
[1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:22.800]  when they're almost everybody sold out or they are jacking up prices right now
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:26.080]  because the premiums they're having to pay but Ted's been in the business 30
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:29.480]  plus years he's got the great connections he's got a lot of volume a
[1:50:29.480 --> 1:50:39.400]  great place to buy 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 and the best thing is all these

[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:52.560]  wants to be felt up by these people I you know it just doesn't it's it's like a
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:57.480]  direct violation of of our constitutional rights it's just simply wrong
[1:55:57.480 --> 1:56:02.640]  and it's neat to see it develop like it has especially from your your
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:05.840]  particular show I mean it's like the whole world grabbed this story thank
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:09.760]  goodness well the D I mean DA's are saying it's it's felonies what they're
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:13.560]  doing well I know it and and I had a story one of the callers called me
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:19.400]  personally said his friend just had breast removal surgery because they had
[1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:24.720]  breast cancer she had breast cancer a doctor's note not to be felt up and they
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:29.040]  did it anyways I mean they don't care if you've got sutures they don't care if
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:32.720]  it's not sanitary they don't care if they just search 50 people with the same
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:39.240]  gloves they're gonna do it because they are God you know it it boggles my mind
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:42.400]  what the government thinks that they can do I mean it's obviously they have no
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:46.400]  regard to the people of the United States I mean we should be up in arms
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:49.960]  against these people there's no question about it they're representing us we
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:53.640]  don't want this why are they doing it and it makes absolutely no sense well
[1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:56.680]  curtain him I'll put out the story yesterday and I really think it should
[1:56:56.680 --> 1:57:02.240]  be one of the biggest developments ever and you know that's the DA says that he
[1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:06.520]  is sending deputies into the airports to stake them out that they're gonna
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:10.360]  arrest people that they see doing this so the DA's aren't just now and it's
[1:57:10.360 --> 1:57:13.360]  other DA's are joining it they're not just warning them now hey you better not
[1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:17.320]  do this they've got them basically staking out some of the airports and
[1:57:17.320 --> 1:57:21.080]  now the vice presidents responding I mean this is big and now we're about to
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:24.080]  go to break and come back with calls and Bob Chapman Ted and other news but

[1:59:11.720 --> 1:59:16.920]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[1:59:16.920 --> 1:59:22.120]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[1:59:22.120 --> 1:59:26.400]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government

[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:34.280]  Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does

[2:00:56.560 --> 2:01:04.680]  we're gonna be getting to all of you so much is going on but Bob Chapman boy I
[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:09.440]  tell you this currency devaluation is accelerating we have the head of the
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:14.480]  World Trade Organization coming out and talking about 1930s style collapse and
[2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:20.440]  quote protectionism we've got Bernanke trying to blame China for what's going
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:23.280]  on but the Federal Reserve has led the way to devalue globally as the World
[2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:28.480]  Reserve currency with the dollar we've got the revolt against TSA now no doubt
[2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:32.120]  the biggest story in the world only getting bigger we have to you know we
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:35.520]  just tapped into the anger here three weeks ago but it's it's it's it's clear
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:40.080]  this show launched it our listeners did what amazing what an amazing time to be
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:46.200]  alive Bob well it certainly is and as you know I've worked for over 50 years on
[2:01:46.200 --> 2:01:52.320]  this project and I was saying to Judy this morning that we're finally getting
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:02:02.880]  results after all those years I must have 15 or 20 videos in my link section
[2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:08.320]  for tomorrow's issue on TSA alone I mean there's so many stories out there of
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:17.720]  people getting fondled and the outrage as far as the WTO is concerned and they
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:23.320]  are terrified that this is the end of the game for them and quite frankly it
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:30.920]  is because the currency war as they call it is going to move next to a Brazil
[2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:38.880]  did recently and that is penalized six percent of the money coming in for
[2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:45.920]  anybody who brings dollars in to purchase securities that give off dividends
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:49.760]  and interest and that's going to spread around the world the reason why is when
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:53.840]  the dollars go in they create inflation and these countries got enough
[2:02:53.840 --> 2:03:01.400]  inflation as it is the next step will be tariffs and the tariffs will put the
[2:03:01.400 --> 2:03:06.800]  WTO out of business which I think is terrific and in fact I've been writing
[2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:18.560]  about that today in regard to the 1930s and the outcome and it's coming and that
[2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:28.640]  means NAFTA and CAFTA and then WTO which has been with us since 1986 and we
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:38.120]  started off with the trade and tariff rules of 1962 and they've spent a lot
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:42.280]  of time bringing this together and I don't think they ever thought that it
[2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:47.160]  would bring about the destruction of the World Trade Organization well that's the
[2:03:47.160 --> 2:03:51.520]  heart of globalism is internationally controlling trade controlling currencies
[2:03:51.520 --> 2:03:55.520]  and they've been able to consolidate and get the power but now as they try to get
[2:03:55.520 --> 2:04:00.000]  even more power people are realizing they've engineered it and that's right
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:04.440]  and of course your programs and programs like it and all of the stuff that we put
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:10.200]  out every week is reaching all over the world and I thank goodness that we are
[2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:19.360]  and as far as Bernanke blaming the Chinese everybody's to blame everybody's
[2:04:19.360 --> 2:04:24.360]  been doing the same thing since the end of the Second World War and even before
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:35.200]  that when the Treasury Department in 1934-5 set up a subsidiary called I can't
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:40.000]  think of it right now but anyway they have a subsidiary and in that sensory
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:48.280]  city or which they funded it's funded the exchange stabilization fund the
[2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:52.240]  exchange stable stay there Bob come back with the exchange stabilization fund

[2:08:43.320 --> 2:08:48.800]  insane the austerity is here so give us give us the big picture but first finish
[2:08:48.800 --> 2:08:51.680]  up with that organization you were talking about stable you know trying to
[2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:55.480]  quote stabilize the currencies and what's really going on with this fight
[2:08:55.480 --> 2:09:02.640]  between the US and China well in 1934 5 the exchange stabilization fund was
[2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:06.400]  formed within the Treasury Department and it's right now it's probably get
[2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:10.920]  close to a trillion dollars in it and they go into the markets and they do
[2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:15.040]  what they want to do with currencies they also use swaps to do the same thing
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:19.080]  which I won't go into detail on but essentially we give five other countries
[2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:22.960]  money and they give us their money and we all go out and manipulate the market
[2:09:22.960 --> 2:09:30.440]  the the key is really coming not only from China but from Russia and Brazil
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:35.680]  and other countries that are big traders and they're saying look we don't want
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:42.480]  your money coming in here number one and number two we're going to continue to
[2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:47.400]  adjust our currencies as we see fit so there's no meaning of mining the mines
[2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:51.920]  here whatsoever the G20 was a good example they couldn't get together on
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:59.360]  anything another non-event so it's going to go into tariffs on on goods and
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:03.600]  services and it's something the United States needs because we've lost eight and
[2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:09.720]  a half million jobs in 10 years there's 432,000 companies left the country
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:14.800]  we've got transnational corporations that are America based that are taking
[2:10:14.800 --> 2:10:20.040]  all their foreign profits 1.7 trillion right now and putting them in the Cayman
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:25.320]  Islands and not paying taxes five years ago they got a tax holiday and they were
[2:10:25.320 --> 2:10:30.320]  able to bring back 350 billion or 500 billion to the United States at five
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:35.240]  and a quarter percent instead of 33% tax I mean all kinds of shenanigans have
[2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:42.880]  gone on it's time to put it to rest to an end you were talking about taxes on
[2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:48.800]  soda pop what's going to happen next if they get that passed they will put a
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:56.520]  special tax of probably 15 to 20% on restaurants and dining out that's
[2:10:56.520 --> 2:11:03.720]  usually the course that's followed by those who do that those countries what
[2:11:03.720 --> 2:11:09.880]  was some of the other things you mentioned no I mean really the VAT to
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:15.840]  expand out into cars refrigerators and this is in federal control and tracking
[2:11:15.840 --> 2:11:21.520]  of all commerce that's why they're cracking down on garage sales on cupcake
[2:11:21.520 --> 2:11:27.040]  sales on people selling eggs or tomatoes on the side of the road they it looks
[2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:30.840]  like they're gonna pass it's passed out a committee this internet censorship bill
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:36.160]  I forgot to get to that that's huge news today they look like they're gonna pass
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:40.920]  the food safety act that goes after the farms and ranches I mean they are
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:46.080]  hitting us with everything right now well they certainly are and those are
[2:11:46.080 --> 2:11:52.320]  very visible and during this lame duck session they're shooting for the food
[2:11:52.320 --> 2:12:00.200]  safety act which you just mentioned coming out of was a committee yes the
[2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:06.040]  food set yeah and then followed by the arms limitations treaty which they're
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:13.160]  very very anxious to get passed and don't ask don't tell the dream act which is
[2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:21.320]  the pathway for citizenship for illegal aliens and there's no end to it I
[2:12:21.320 --> 2:12:26.520]  mean we're fighting like mad that we do have some big issues and I think the
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:32.240]  biggest issue that's really hit the hot button the people is the TSA issue but
[2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:37.440]  I think what's coming right behind that is the the Federal Reserve issue because
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:41.920]  they have to use the creation of money and credit to keep the economy going
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:48.240]  until they decide they're going to pull the plug and during that process they're
[2:12:48.240 --> 2:12:51.640]  going to have to over the next two years and I said this in mid-May on this
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:55.880]  program they're going to have five trillion dollars two point five and two
[2:12:55.880 --> 2:13:02.080]  point five for QE two and QE three and that'll carry them through the next
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:06.400]  election what'll happen after that I don't know and in the interim we're
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:11.320]  going to have lots of inflation and it may lead to hyperinflation as well that
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:15.520]  means gold and silver are going to go right through the roof I mean they tried
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:19.600]  to hammer golden server down early this morning around a half hour after the
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:24.520]  comics opening they weren't successful they banged it down about seven or eight
[2:13:24.520 --> 2:13:30.760]  dollars it came back like a zombie and they just can't kill it and so next
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:35.120]  week should be a good week in spite of the fact that Tuesday is options
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:41.400]  expiration for golden silver options on the comics and so we got a long way to
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:46.120]  go and people should be taking advantage of working with Midas and getting
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:51.440]  golden server coins it's not going to get any cheaper and take advantage of
[2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:57.280]  getting that one-fifth ounce coin so you can get the international forecaster
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:14:04.320]  free of charge Bob shifting gears into censorship here's Wired magazine
[2:14:04.320 --> 2:14:09.560]  web censorship bill sales through Senate committee we've been covering this
[2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:15.600]  legislation for a year we've read the subsections on air but even this report
[2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:20.560]  admits that it allows the Attorney General outside of any court any
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:27.320]  indictment any charges to shut down any website they wish at any time at on
[2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:32.760]  Thursday the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved a bill that would
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:36.720]  give the Attorney General the right to shut down websites with a court order if
[2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:40.080]  copyright infringement is deemed central to the activity of the site
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:45.560]  regardless of the website is actually committed a crime she no no judge no
[2:14:45.560 --> 2:14:52.160]  no no nothing they just do it the combating online infringement and
[2:14:52.160 --> 2:14:57.560]  counterfeits act is amongst the most draconian laws ever considered this is
[2:14:57.560 --> 2:15:01.880]  Wired magazine saying this not us to combat digital piracy and contains what
[2:15:01.880 --> 2:15:05.240]  some have called the nuclear option which would essentially allow the Attorney
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:11.320]  General to turn suspected websites off so now we just suspect you and here's
[2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:15.440]  another one this is like China this is a French news agency woman may be first
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:22.000]  in China persecuted over tweet and she's being sent to a quote forced labor
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:27.280]  camp for causing disruptive social order for basically criticizing the
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:31.800]  government so that's what these internet ID systems do that Microsoft and other
[2:15:31.800 --> 2:15:37.400]  ones I mean here we are in America and they're saying no judge no jury no proof
[2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:42.200]  anything we'll shut down your website we'll shut down your ISP we'll do it
[2:15:42.200 --> 2:15:48.240]  whenever we want for any reason and we go through this all the time on YouTube
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:52.200]  and other places people will just file fake copyright stuff it's not true you
[2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:54.720]  know there's law firms running around suing people for posting you know a
[2:15:54.720 --> 2:15:58.720]  couple paragraphs from an article they're losing in court because it's fair
[2:15:58.720 --> 2:16:03.600]  use I've seen that in the news lately but but the issue is that this will just
[2:16:03.600 --> 2:16:08.080]  say it doesn't matter the Attorney General's God will do whatever we want
[2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:11.520]  and this is what cast done scene wants to do they want to shut down the
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:15.320]  alternative media and this lame duck group of criminals is doing this we've
[2:16:15.320 --> 2:16:19.240]  got to get this repealed if they pass it but it's sailed out a committee and has
[2:16:19.240 --> 2:16:23.920]  been bundled and Reuters reports that both the food safety takeover the farms
[2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:27.040]  and ranches of is what it is nothing to do with food safety written by big
[2:16:27.040 --> 2:16:31.280]  agra that that's set to pass now it's got the votes and they're saying this is
[2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:36.880]  set to pass I mean this is insane Bob well it certainly is it just reminds me
[2:16:36.880 --> 2:16:43.600]  of all us died by beer and in German that means where is your papers and it's
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:48.840]  the same concept you do what we want you to do or we'll shut you down I wonder
[2:16:48.840 --> 2:16:54.320]  what they're going to do about the ISP's that are outside the United States they
[2:16:54.320 --> 2:16:58.000]  are now in question they're now trying to sign an international treaty which
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:02.520]  even wired admits is secret but that but was leaked a few months ago where
[2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:09.120]  internationally they're signing deals to do the same thing we can have world
[2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:15.400]  revolution well look this information liberty the fight against the global is
[2:17:15.400 --> 2:17:19.000]  already the hottest thing in the world as they try to squeeze and restrict it
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:22.480]  people are really going to want it and it's going to verify everything we've
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:26.680]  said and then as the rest of the tyranny comes in and abuses everybody it's
[2:17:26.680 --> 2:17:31.000]  waking up all the sheeple they're the ones waking up the sheeple not us they're
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:36.640]  the ones coming out with brazen classical tyranny when you said we write
[2:17:36.640 --> 2:17:42.880]  about that and they're kind of messing in their own stuff and that's kind of
[2:17:42.880 --> 2:17:46.440]  create a problem for them did you see the video clip of Jay Rockefeller saying
[2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:51.800]  he wants to shut down Fox and MSNBC no well think about that think about that
[2:17:51.800 --> 2:17:56.480]  you've got the mainstream media who's being killed by the alternative
[2:17:56.480 --> 2:18:00.880]  media and you've got the federal government and the corporate crooks
[2:18:00.880 --> 2:18:05.480]  that are being exposed so they're in a poor perfect storm wanting to shut down
[2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:08.680]  alternative media because the mainstream media is being killed by us the
[2:18:08.680 --> 2:18:12.240]  government's being destroyed by us the corrupt people are being hurt by us but
[2:18:12.240 --> 2:18:15.440]  then Rockefeller comes out and says hey don't worry we're going to shut it all
[2:18:15.440 --> 2:18:26.040]  down the government's going to program the media well there you have it 1984 you
[2:18:26.040 --> 2:18:32.440]  will do what we tell you to do and if you do not we will incarcerate you just
[2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:37.560]  remember we're going to have to fight back and all you listeners have got to be
[2:18:37.560 --> 2:18:42.720]  listening hard about these things you got to go to Congress with them and do
[2:18:42.720 --> 2:18:47.720]  what we can in the legal process hopefully we can stop them and we're
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:58.760]  capable of doing that I think that this TSA event could be very catalytic you
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:06.960]  never know what things are going to turn into and this particular action and
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:12.240]  concept that's being pushed and promulgated by government is nothing
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:19.680]  more than psychological warfare it to me is the training of people to do what
[2:19:19.680 --> 2:19:25.360]  they're told to you know go from one place to another and you do what we tell
[2:19:25.360 --> 2:19:31.200]  you to do and if we can break them on this I think it'll be a big break for
[2:19:31.200 --> 2:19:37.400]  us because Congress will be more apt to listen to what we have to say as a
[2:19:37.400 --> 2:19:41.480]  people and as the public has victories against Terany we learn that we can have
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:45.400]  victory against other forms of Terany and I've been saying that for three
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:49.920]  weeks now mainstream news is realizing this is a catalyst that's going to be
[2:19:49.920 --> 2:19:54.560]  bigger than the Tea Party and they'll try to co-opt it they can't win Bob

[2:24:23.240 --> 2:24:26.760]  we will be
[2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:39.320]  yeah we will be victorious it's that attitude of victory we're in the right an
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:43.480]  army of potbellied federal demons training us how to be slaves they're
[2:24:43.480 --> 2:24:46.040]  only doing that ahead of taking your pension funds and everything you got
[2:24:46.040 --> 2:24:51.460]  and conscripting your children to fight for the new world order army I mean they
[2:24:51.460 --> 2:24:56.840]  see us as a product they want to force vaccines on us force prozac force
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:25:03.360]  aspartame force fluoride on us now it comes out they've been putting uranium
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:07.320]  in the water mainstream news and covering it up and it's just a minor
[2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:12.480]  footnote we've got raving lunatic psychos running everything why because we
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:17.680]  let them that's where psychos want to go they want power over people normal
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:21.520]  people don't that's why psychopaths tend to get in control in history Bob
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:26.240]  Chapman's our guest but we're gonna Jeff J Jackie Pat China and others that are
[2:25:26.240 --> 2:25:29.520]  holding but I mean it's really that simple Bob but you were you were finishing
[2:25:29.520 --> 2:25:34.680]  up with that point that this is a big awakening and it's devastating I mean
[2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:39.440]  it's already cut air travel massively and when you've got the notice the pilots
[2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:42.880]  just said we're not gonna fly they said okay you don't have to do the Pat down
[2:25:42.880 --> 2:25:47.640]  anymore but then everybody goes yeah I never thought of that why is a pilot
[2:25:47.640 --> 2:25:51.480]  have to have his his private parts grabbed and go through all this when we
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:56.240]  trust him with a gun and he's flying the giant plane that's a huge missile it's
[2:25:56.240 --> 2:26:02.040]  baloney you know who watches the CIA who watches all these secret agencies
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:06.760]  nobody but they're always getting caught shipping in drugs every evil you can
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:14.400]  imagine Bob that's completely true and but I think people are starting to think
[2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:20.640]  along those lines where why are they doing this to us and what should we do
[2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:26.880]  to stop it I think people cutting back on flying is gonna really do it and we
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:32.760]  could have a no fly day if possible when no one goes to the planes maybe these
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:39.800]  baboons in Washington will get the message well there's no doubt the
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:43.560]  enemy is trying to enslave us right now trying to accelerate their program
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:47.640]  because they know that they're behind schedule or waking up but I think that
[2:26:47.640 --> 2:26:52.600]  that's just accelerating our awakening well I agree with that that two-edged
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:56.720]  sewer that you mentioned earlier in the program and for every action is a
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:03.560]  reaction and we're reacting and and we're giving them a pain a big one and
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:09.480]  it's not only TSA it's lots of other things unfortunately we have this lame
[2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:14.880]  duck session and I don't know whether they're gonna be able to pass what they
[2:27:14.880 --> 2:27:20.880]  want to pass but they sure gonna try and we don't know what the new people in
[2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:25.480]  Congress are gonna do until probably March or April and will they be bought
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:31.640]  off or how many of them will be remains to be seen they certainly know why they
[2:27:31.640 --> 2:27:35.440]  get elected and that is to get rid of the person who was in there no matter
[2:27:35.440 --> 2:27:41.120]  what party he was in because he did the things that people in that constituency
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:48.560]  didn't want him to do you know I'm just go ahead but I I think that that we've
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:52.560]  we've gained an edge on him here that we didn't have before and I think we've
[2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:57.200]  got to use it to the utmost and every one of these events that comes by
[2:27:57.200 --> 2:28:03.160]  whether it's the the Fed reserve or Max Kaiser and yourself I saw that tape
[2:28:03.160 --> 2:28:08.920]  excellent let's everybody go out and buy a silver coin are maybe lots of them
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:18.760]  and we can put JP Morgan Chase and HSBC in a hole they'll go under and that
[2:28:18.760 --> 2:28:22.560]  would be terrific and in silver would be one or two or three or four hundred
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:27.360]  dollars an ounce and so you're all looking at making money by doing this
[2:28:27.360 --> 2:28:33.840]  and getting rid of the largest sharehold in the Federal Reserve who which JP
[2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:39.160]  Morgan Chase which represents the black mobility of Europe and particularly the
[2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:45.040]  coin of anyone absolutely and Bob it's simple if you sit on your butt as a
[2:28:45.040 --> 2:28:49.200]  spectator and let a bully squat on you and spit on you you know things are
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:52.880]  never going to change the globalists know how powerful individuals are that's
[2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:56.400]  why they're always trying to tie us down and teach us we don't have power if we
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:01.760]  just all of us start speaking out getting angry putting fliers out calling
[2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:06.880]  into talk radio calling Congress saying no you see a police checkpoint get out
[2:29:06.880 --> 2:29:10.560]  and say this violates the law and you know what they might crack you over the
[2:29:10.560 --> 2:29:16.920]  head so why you know what I mean it's time to take action when you see
[2:29:16.920 --> 2:29:20.480]  tyranny and to realize it's a threat to you and your family I mean this isn't
[2:29:20.480 --> 2:29:25.360]  some good old boy boss hog corruption as I've said many times that we're facing
[2:29:25.360 --> 2:29:30.880]  this is scientific murderous eugenics folks you ain't seen nothing yet if they
[2:29:30.880 --> 2:29:34.080]  get this world government place and I know your church is bought off and
[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:38.040]  tells you it's a foregone conclusion and Jesus is about to teleport you out of
[2:29:38.040 --> 2:29:41.760]  here the people in Germany thought that too they thought it in Russia they think
[2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:46.480]  it in China no we're gonna have to face this head on okay that's what God wants
[2:29:46.480 --> 2:29:50.680]  you to do get up off your hands in and say no to evil you're against abortion

[2:30:24.200 --> 2:30:28.960]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:30:28.960 --> 2:30:32.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:30:32.760 --> 2:30:36.360]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:16.360]  support the operation Alex so please plug plus it gets all the word out in the
[2:39:16.360 --> 2:39:19.440]  info out look at the effect we're having look at the stories we're
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:23.880]  generating we're beginning to take over the news cycle on so many fronts this
[2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:27.400]  is scaring the system Bob we're not tooting our horn you're not tooting
[2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:32.400]  your horn we're having huge effect and make no mistake our names we're getting
[2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:36.160]  demonized by the media they hit pieces they're in danger our treasures in
[2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:40.440]  danger we're physically in danger we need people support we deserve the
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:45.480]  support don't we Bob we certainly do we stick our necks out a long way away and
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:51.720]  we usually don't talk about it and practically never but the financing is
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:57.000]  very very important for Alex and the more he grows the more information is
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:40:01.200]  going to be reached more people throughout the entire world we're not
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:05.280]  the only ones who've got these problems look at the demonstrations and marches
[2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:10.160]  and confrontations in Europe they're going on every day and we'll even hear
[2:40:10.160 --> 2:40:16.000]  about them usually Alex picks them up I pick some up pick them up but not many
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:20.320]  people do well they'll have millions in France thirsting they'll have millions
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:23.880]  in France or hundreds of thousands and our owner millions in Greece and the
[2:40:23.880 --> 2:40:27.000]  media says a few thousand were out but then you read the foreign news it's
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:32.320]  millions they lie well that's absolutely true and I get those questions all the
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:36.840]  time when I do those overseas broadcasts you know to the marine
[2:40:36.840 --> 2:40:42.760]  disposition and they fill me in on things I didn't know because they're on the
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:52.120]  scene and they I was even told yesterday that on the basis and the the
[2:40:52.120 --> 2:40:57.680]  internet that is available to the military personnel is different than
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:04.000]  what is available outside so if you get out to the city or out to the city and
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:09.640]  you go to a library and you start searching you know even in English if
[2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:14.080]  you're if you're in Europe or someplace you'll find that there's all kinds of
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:20.120]  things on the internet that you can't get on the internet on the base well now
[2:41:20.120 --> 2:41:23.440]  everybody's going outside to find out what's going on well that's why they
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:28.840]  have geo filtering and that's because we woke them up absolutely Bob one other
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:33.000]  point I wanted to make before we go to callers this is on CNBC nearly one in
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:37.640]  five Americans had mental illness in 09 no they didn't they're saying if you
[2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:40.600]  don't trust government that's a mental illness or if you're upset that's a
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:43.680]  mental illness you're supposed to be upset that's why you have this I mean it
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:47.240]  might be one out of 50 that really has a mental problem and usually it's
[2:41:47.240 --> 2:41:51.400]  chemical from the medical doctors we've talked to but now the government they
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:55.400]  can't get you in debt or get you working for the government or get you in the
[2:41:55.400 --> 2:41:59.360]  in in in you know one of their criminal justice systems they want to get you in
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:02.920]  the mental system and they're now saying they don't want 45 million Americans
[2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:06.600]  to be able to own a gun they don't tell you that when they give you a mental
[2:42:06.600 --> 2:42:12.320]  designation so you get your insurance paid for or whatever that that you know
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:16.120]  that 20% of the public's not gonna be able to own guns now I mean this is
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:21.800]  incredible Bob it certainly is that it's moving on all fronts and it's the
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:25.680]  things that they've been planning for years and years and years that's what
[2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:30.080]  all those thick think tanks and foundations and all these groups that we
[2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:35.880]  talk about that's what they've been up to with tax-free money and here we are
[2:42:35.880 --> 2:42:40.560]  trying to fight them with one hand tied behind our back and that's why Alex
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:44.720]  needs your help well just spread the word just spread the word I mean it's
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:47.800]  wonderful we're having a lot of success I just want to continue that but it's
[2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:54.200]  time to time to wake up folks this is the wake-up call here ladies and
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:42:59.720]  gentlemen these are pretty effective actually is that making the microphone
[2:42:59.720 --> 2:43:06.120]  peak I already broke one one time just barely patting it all right let's go to
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:08.800]  some phone calls here ladies and gentlemen with Bob Chapman of the
[2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:13.760]  international forecaster comm Jeff in Canada you're on the air hey Alex how
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:17.320]  you doing I'm doing all right I'm almost over this chest cold I've had so I'm
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:22.040]  happy go ahead first of all I just got to say you know what I think I'm glad you
[2:43:22.040 --> 2:43:25.720]  playing use on your show I think nice of Sidone you should become your personal
[2:43:25.720 --> 2:43:30.920]  theme song Alex that is a good song I'm a big fan of music another big fan of
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:35.760]  us say up in Canada you know our government's gone even more psychotic
[2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:40.240]  than yours we've all got your backup here you know really appreciate you being
[2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:44.760]  on the front lines for all these years with this TFA thing it's really got me
[2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:48.280]  concerned because I'm actually flying into the States for the first time in a
[2:43:48.280 --> 2:43:52.600]  couple weeks and I don't want to go so I had an idea and I might and I need your
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:57.320]  help with it I think if we could get a couple patriot lawyers together we're
[2:43:57.320 --> 2:44:01.720]  willing to donate a couple hours of their time to write up like a checklist
[2:44:01.720 --> 2:44:08.880]  and legally to talk to you know things to say to the TFA screeners and in a
[2:44:08.880 --> 2:44:12.200]  legal format like that don't touch my junk stuff it's just gonna get you
[2:44:12.200 --> 2:44:16.720]  laughed at if you go there with like the law written down on a piece of paper now
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:20.240]  what you do is you let them grope you and you tell them no that makes them
[2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:25.480]  enjoy it more and then you call the local district attorney and you demand
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:29.040]  that they indict them they're not above the law look they don't have immunity I
[2:44:29.040 --> 2:44:33.120]  had the DA on their immunity is when they're in the right just like I have
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:37.280]  immunity to kill a burglar in my house it's not immunity when I'm in the right
[2:44:37.280 --> 2:44:41.120]  I'm immune when they're outside of their little office they're not even sworn
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:46.160]  cops they are engaging in felony groping they're going to get indicted do you
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:51.440]  realize how big that news is from those DA's yesterday oh I it's huge it's huge
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:55.080]  but the question I have is should we be videotaping everything that goes on while
[2:44:55.080 --> 2:44:58.720]  we're going through screening let me tell you I phones are great but but but we
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:06.800]  bought one at the office it's a little you know I I nano what are the little
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:11.640]  music players call yeah yeah nano iPod they've got them now they can store
[2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:15.040]  thousands of songs but also have a little bitty camera in them and you can
[2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:18.880]  just clip it onto your shirt and the goons don't even know you're recording
[2:45:18.880 --> 2:45:24.080]  at all but absolutely you should record it all put it on YouTube just two weeks
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:26.760]  ago they were saying they weren't touching your gentles through your clothes
[2:45:26.760 --> 2:45:31.640]  now they admit they're reaching in the pants and grabbing many people's you
[2:45:31.640 --> 2:45:35.920]  know again they try to stonewall they try to lie you said you need our help
[2:45:35.920 --> 2:45:39.840]  what's your final point Jeff well it's just yeah if we could get something you
[2:45:39.840 --> 2:45:43.720]  know like a checklist of things to say a way to body language that sort of stuff
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:47.240]  put it up on your website no I say I say do you know just tell them you're it's
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:52.280]  wrong to grope me it violates law and then you just go to the DA after it
[2:45:52.280 --> 2:45:56.520]  happens and you get them indicted I appreciate your call I mean look they've
[2:45:56.520 --> 2:46:00.880]  already in two days now they've got a whole bunch of airports fact I have the
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:04.960]  article that major airport associations are saying we'll do our own security get
[2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:10.000]  out of here see it was never the law the airports got invited them in right
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:12.880]  after the government stage 9-11 when they were all you know ready to lick
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:17.040]  boots and do whatever they were told okay so it's a power grab it's on it it's
[2:46:17.040 --> 2:46:21.920]  all civil that's why they threaten you with civil $11,000 fines first it was
[2:46:21.920 --> 2:46:26.800]  10 now 11 if you don't submit it's all intimidation Bob Chapman your comments
[2:46:26.800 --> 2:46:31.520]  well I think you're absolutely right and as I said early in the program it's
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:37.160]  psychological warfare to get people in a submissive mood that the government can
[2:46:37.160 --> 2:46:42.120]  do anything they want and yeah get out of your trance wake up get out of it get
[2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:47.040]  out of the trance folks sorry Bob go ahead oh that's okay another thing too is
[2:46:47.040 --> 2:46:53.680]  I understand that there are 17 airports who have already opted out of the system
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:47:00.080]  yes now why don't the rest of them opt out of the system then we won't have them
[2:47:00.080 --> 2:47:03.000]  in there to do those things but then the feds are going to go blow up a plant one
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:06.360]  of those airports so we have to expose the false flag terror and say you know
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:09.960]  we're gonna fly even more with the airport that you're bombing I want to
[2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:13.680]  go to the airport where the feds are doing it okay we're not given into your
[2:47:13.680 --> 2:47:18.840]  terrorism right Bob absolutely we're fighters and we want to make everybody
[2:47:18.840 --> 2:47:23.760]  else fighters I mean seriously you've got a better chance of dying from a honey
[2:47:23.760 --> 2:47:30.040]  bee sting literally than you do been killed by a terrorist it's ridiculous
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:37.280]  when I saw Ollie north back in 1984-85 before the Senate committee talk about
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:43.680]  terrorism and a summer build been laden I knew then that's what the scam was
[2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:51.720]  going to be and after that I questioned about it and he just laughed and
[2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:57.280]  giggled and wouldn't answer me that's right Bob you've been very successful
[2:47:57.280 --> 2:48:00.280]  in business and also worked in intelligence for the US government and
[2:48:00.280 --> 2:48:03.960]  you you want to finally tell your other Ollie north stories or is that still
[2:48:03.960 --> 2:48:10.760]  secret no no they're not interesting oh yeah I'd rather hear what what our
[2:48:10.760 --> 2:48:14.400]  listeners want to hear because that's why we're here hey you know what I found
[2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:18.000]  out from a major magazine reporter and I checked it last night it was true a
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:21.880]  major magazine reporter was here and I was talking about Gary Allen the book
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:25.440]  you help get published none there call a conspiracy really helping wake me up and
[2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:29.920]  I was like 12 14 I forget how old I was I was real young when I read it and he
[2:48:29.920 --> 2:48:35.360]  said did you know Gary Allen son runs Politico Gary Allen son runs like one of
[2:48:35.360 --> 2:48:40.000]  the hottest news websites in the world now did you know that no I didn't I
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  haven't been in touch with him for 20 years did you know Gary Allen son well
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:49.920]  yeah but he was young at the time I didn't have anything to do with him I
[2:48:49.920 --> 2:48:54.440]  just knew him that's it well that's amazing I mean I knew his wife better
[2:48:54.440 --> 2:49:02.600]  but in fact when we've we've published the Gary Allen report I handed
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:09.040]  everything over to his wife and I never took a dime out of it I just let him
[2:49:09.040 --> 2:49:13.720]  take keep the whole thing because I was making piles of money and so I said you
[2:49:13.720 --> 2:49:20.640]  know Gary you need an income so here and one time you were we had about 40,000
[2:49:20.640 --> 2:49:25.360]  subscribers so we did okay but at one time you were also the biggest private
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:31.320]  silver and gold broker right absolutely a stock broker that is as opposed to
[2:49:31.320 --> 2:49:37.800]  coins and bullion how much were you what was your volume at your peak well I
[2:49:37.800 --> 2:49:44.080]  was in gross commissions I was doing about an average in about 300,000 a
[2:49:44.080 --> 2:49:50.400]  month which is about you know 3.6 million a year and I used to keep 65
[2:49:50.400 --> 2:49:55.880]  percent of it so I did okay and that was back in the 80s and 90s that was
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:04.200]  really between 1976 and 1988 with the top years and they started to fade towards
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:09.120]  88 and that's when I shut it down and retired in which I really shouldn't have
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:12.760]  it done because it was bored to death played golf and tennis and I said I got
[2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:16.920]  to use my mind if someone says to me well why don't you start a newsletter and I
[2:50:16.920 --> 2:50:22.520]  say gee that sounds like a great idea so we did it and here we are fighting the
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:25.800]  new world order I meant to get to all these calls we're gonna cut was jam in
[2:50:25.800 --> 2:50:28.960]  one row let's just skip the break I'm out of control today skip the network
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:34.080]  break please let's talk to Jay and mass you're on the air hey Alex thanks for
[2:50:34.080 --> 2:50:36.880]  taking the call you touched on this a little bit earlier but I have a
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:41.040]  question for you now on the TSA stuff if this is something that they opt out of
[2:50:41.040 --> 2:50:45.240]  and it's repealed and everything doesn't that sort of play into the powers that
[2:50:45.240 --> 2:50:49.080]  be hands where they could not orchestrate another attack and no no no
[2:50:49.080 --> 2:50:53.840]  definitely they're gonna blow some stuff up and say see we told you now it's a
[2:50:53.840 --> 2:50:58.640]  proctology exam and people go that's right I'm so scared of al-qaeda we have
[2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:01.480]  to point out like Ron Paul you got a better chance of dying in a car wreck
[2:51:01.480 --> 2:51:06.640]  honey bee sting football accident slipping and falling I mean it's one of
[2:51:06.640 --> 2:51:10.440]  the lowest causes of death is terrorism and then when you research it most of
[2:51:10.440 --> 2:51:14.800]  its government sponsored so it's happening that it was real you know what
[2:51:14.800 --> 2:51:19.320]  I'm ready to face the danger it's a bunch of bull I mean there's 28,000 dead
[2:51:19.320 --> 2:51:23.680]  on the US Mexican border and nothing's being that's more than Vietnam every
[2:51:23.680 --> 2:51:28.600]  year okay that's this is incredible but they they're not worried about that they
[2:51:28.600 --> 2:51:33.520]  just hype it up and who the terrorist look he's got a turban on it's all a
[2:51:33.520 --> 2:51:38.960]  delusion I'm sorry Jay finish your point no it just seems like I mean from my
[2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:41.600]  point of view it seems like it's almost the win-win for them because if they do
[2:51:41.600 --> 2:51:44.880]  have to repeal it they can just orchestrate something else and then almost
[2:51:44.880 --> 2:51:48.840]  it heightened the terror you know what I mean yes Bob Chapman your comments on
[2:51:48.840 --> 2:51:56.280]  that well that's a hard one yes they could turn it that way but I think if we
[2:51:56.280 --> 2:51:59.360]  can stop them from doing what they're doing whether it's through the airport's
[2:51:59.360 --> 2:52:05.560]  dropping out of the system in which they can and as I said 17 have already done
[2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:12.960]  so and the latest one was Orlando and I we got to shut them down one way or the
[2:52:12.960 --> 2:52:18.800]  other and whatever the response is it is I mean you know it's just like well the
[2:52:18.800 --> 2:52:22.640]  bullies after me and if enough and if I punch him in the face I'm gonna get
[2:52:22.640 --> 2:52:27.880]  pounded so what if you fight back he's gonna say gee I better go pick on
[2:52:27.880 --> 2:52:31.920]  somebody else it's not gonna take a swing at me
[2:52:31.920 --> 2:52:39.600]  it's incredible Bob let's go ahead and take another call let's talk to Jackie
[2:52:39.600 --> 2:52:44.160]  in Canada Jackie you're on the air worldwide hey Mr. Alex Jones I just
[2:52:44.160 --> 2:52:48.200]  want to say hi I pray for you I listened to you for the first time like five years
[2:52:48.200 --> 2:52:51.720]  ago and I have three very important points if I could please say them first
[2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:57.160]  of all I agree the Bible says stand up for righteousness stand against evil but
[2:52:57.160 --> 2:53:00.080]  we have to remember you know when people's lives are at stake they need to
[2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:02.920]  receive the gospel they need to believe in Jesus Christ because if they don't
[2:53:02.920 --> 2:53:06.000]  believe in him and they die they're gonna go to hell for eternity Jesus is
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:09.840]  only with heaven because he never sinned and we all sinned so second of all I
[2:53:09.840 --> 2:53:14.240]  think a great idea we can all do is get together and protest outside of the
[2:53:14.240 --> 2:53:19.960]  TV news stations and protest that we want the truth because that is what is
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:26.600]  deceiving most people right now and if they got the truth then everything could
[2:53:26.600 --> 2:53:30.840]  change the state terrorist attacks can't work and we need that we deserve the
[2:53:30.840 --> 2:53:34.080]  truth it's evil that they're lying to us and the last thing is those people in
[2:53:34.080 --> 2:53:39.720]  the FEMA camps that we saw on your show with with the governor Ventura who are
[2:53:39.720 --> 2:53:46.400]  those kids in the in the FEMA camps can we investigate that are you there yes
[2:53:46.400 --> 2:53:51.800]  yes I'm there go ahead sorry so that was three very fast points but we saw
[2:53:51.800 --> 2:53:55.200]  those kids in the FEMA camps behind the gates who are people there's people in
[2:53:55.200 --> 2:53:58.800]  FEMA camps right now what's going on who are they okay well we've explained
[2:53:58.800 --> 2:54:03.800]  that it's it's it's covered we've done many shows that that footage is from
[2:54:03.800 --> 2:54:09.040]  yours truly my crew shot that and we explain it if you listen on the show
[2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:13.400]  they take the children of immigrants who are citizens themselves and they lock
[2:54:13.400 --> 2:54:17.240]  them up in those camps and under the congressional hearings they admit that
[2:54:17.240 --> 2:54:20.640]  they build the camps in the name of immigrants but that they're also for
[2:54:20.640 --> 2:54:24.480]  citizens so they're set up for entire families I appreciate your call let's
[2:54:24.480 --> 2:54:27.920]  go ahead and talk to Pat in Texas you're on the air with Bob Chapman go
[2:54:27.920 --> 2:54:33.120]  ahead hi I've got a couple of points of first of all a friend of mine had a
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:37.280]  dream of 9-1-1 before it happened but she didn't pursue it at all saw the
[2:54:37.280 --> 2:54:41.280]  buildings planes everything and she's had a dream of a woman a white
[2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:47.320]  American like woman with a suit on and a baby doll at its arms and her arms and
[2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:51.560]  before she got onto the plane she threw the baby doll down jumped on it blew up
[2:54:51.560 --> 2:54:57.120]  and I'm wondering are they X-Ring babies and how do you how do you know that they
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:04.600]  don't and they let a baby dog and a second point I want to say is I want to
[2:55:04.600 --> 2:55:09.920]  take up for Perry because I know air Perry sometimes gets on her nerves but
[2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:14.400]  you know what abortion is a number one issue in America today I hate to tell you
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:19.440]  that but I'm watching I watch that told me when Kay Bailey Hutchison voted for
[2:55:19.440 --> 2:55:25.160]  culture and essentially voting for the health care bill and paying for abortion
[2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:29.640]  I think it's gonna freeze over and it froze over here everything was white the
[2:55:29.640 --> 2:55:33.240]  air was white I'm listening Pat we're almost out of time I appreciate your
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:42.040]  call look I want to get Bob's final comment here because look I don't go
[2:55:42.040 --> 2:55:47.560]  off of dreams here on the show but yes they have been advertising wide al-qaeda
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:50.560]  because they really don't like the fact that the public goes wait a minute you
[2:55:50.560 --> 2:55:54.040]  say Muslims did it or foreigners did it but citizens are the people being
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:55:58.840]  harassed so they want to hype up that oh the white-bread people they're behind
[2:55:58.840 --> 2:56:02.800]  it and you know black folks they're behind it and all these other everybody's
[2:56:02.800 --> 2:56:09.400]  a terrorist and yes they do x-ray baby dolls they x-ray everything and Bob
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:17.440]  shabbin your comments covered it I think that we have to deal with the absolute
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:23.520]  realities and that's what we're doing on this show and the other things are very
[2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:29.000]  peripheral by the way they just gave me a helium article here it says the chance
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:35.760]  of dying in a terror attack in the United States is greater than winning the
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:42.480]  powerball twice in a row I don't know if if that's true but I do know it's one
[2:56:42.480 --> 2:56:47.680]  of the lowest statistical chances you've got to die I do know you've got a better
[2:56:47.680 --> 2:56:51.480]  chance of being struck by lightning let's let's put up with helium says it
[2:56:51.480 --> 2:56:57.240]  says but it is likely as winning the powerball twice in a row terrorist attacks
[2:56:57.240 --> 2:57:02.640]  I will kill fewer people than among other things heart disease cancer car
[2:57:02.640 --> 2:57:07.840]  accident suicide complications due to surgery at least in America it will I
[2:57:07.840 --> 2:57:15.640]  agree with that I mean it's just a hyped up made-up thing Bob well I it's a
[2:57:15.640 --> 2:57:23.160]  repetition of a form of brainwashing and the American people unfortunately have
[2:57:23.160 --> 2:57:31.320]  bought it and the catalyst of course was 9-11 and in this last 10 years that was
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:35.320]  trauma-based mind control they took that event and then tried to sell us on the
[2:57:35.320 --> 2:57:41.440]  new way through that exactly and that's what this is all about and you can't
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:46.880]  get let let them suck you into the vortex stop watching the crummy TV
[2:57:46.880 --> 2:57:52.760]  programs and spend your time listening to things like Alex has to say and
[2:57:52.760 --> 2:57:57.400]  supporting them we've got to reach people all over the world yes we're worried
[2:57:57.400 --> 2:58:01.520]  about Americans because we're Americans but there's more people that need help
[2:58:01.520 --> 2:58:06.520]  as well and that radiation over the airways has got to go out well we're
[2:58:06.520 --> 2:58:11.080]  all in this together and this is a global government it's a new world order
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:15.720]  we're fighting folks you can call 806-86-2237 get a free copy of their
