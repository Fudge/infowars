[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  exciting things happen in the last few days especially a phone call I just had
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  before I went on air want to say hi to the great folks out there listening that
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.000]  it just is a distraction at certain levels how amazing life is and how if you
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  just take action and stand up against tyranny the great things that happen the
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  wonderful people you meet the fellow freedom fighters the fellow lovers of
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  truth that you run into in this life it is just it is just so booing and
[02:09.000 --> 02:16.000]  exciting and I just don't have words to describe it that said I wasn't here
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  yesterday because I'm trying to stay focused on the film and a book I'm
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  trying to finish both of and I have a deadline of less than two months to
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  finish both of them and so coming up the next few weeks there may be a few
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  shows where I'm not here because I have to meet deadlines and I've met every
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.000]  deadline that I've ever had except for one this book is already now behind
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  schedule so it's a second deadline now and so you're going to hear Burma's
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  Jason Burma's to the great job yesterday popping in occasionally in the next
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000]  couple months as I finish this book and the film you know the radio show is
[02:52.000 --> 02:59.000]  number one and is most important but it's unscripted it's uncrafted it's
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.000]  it's not polished which is good the chaos involved in it and the free
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  wheeling and the phone calls and the gas and it's important it's listened to
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  by millions of people every single day now but the films are evergreen and is
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  my true passion and that's where I can really put across what I believe and
[03:23.000 --> 03:30.000]  what I stand for and the information I'm covering and so I don't know I'm
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  just drawn I'm torn I feel like I'm going in too many directions and the
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  time is short the globalists are moving on us on every front I just appreciate
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  all of you and all your support and just know this we're not perfect we don't
[03:44.000 --> 03:51.000]  have all the answers we make mistakes and I'm trying to mature here and live up
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  to the challenge of the amazing responsibility I have because I never
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  knew when I first got involved in this 14 years ago that it would turn into
[04:01.000 --> 04:09.000]  something like it is now I just in my wildest dreams I just set out to stand
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  up against tyranny and corruption and I am just humbled and really blasted but
[04:17.000 --> 04:25.000]  but blasted in a good way it's and by the excitement and the support and the
[04:25.000 --> 04:32.000]  love and the just the the interfacing with humanity is so amazing and so
[04:32.000 --> 04:41.000]  wholesome and so good but the same time the death threats and the surveillance
[04:41.000 --> 04:50.000]  and the harassment and the lies about me it's all it's all like a dream row row
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  row your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is
[04:54.000 --> 05:02.000]  by the dream over I back of all the new stay with us hello friends this is Alex Jones

[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[08:06.000 --> 08:29.000]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:29.000 --> 08:36.000]  all right I want to be clear about this particular subject and I want to flesh
[08:36.000 --> 08:42.000]  it out and really break down the different facets to it because when you
[08:42.000 --> 08:53.000]  talk about man-made climate change when you talk about issues of attacks on
[08:53.000 --> 09:00.000]  land when you talk about serfdom and feudalism and animal ID and premise
[09:00.000 --> 09:06.000]  society the global federalization and corporatization of all farms and
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.000]  ranches the domestication of society it all ties together under agenda 21
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  under United Nations laws and treaties that our illegitimate government
[09:20.000 --> 09:35.000]  has to deal with.
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  So I want to go over some of that today also want to take your phone
[09:41.000 --> 09:50.000]  800-259-9231
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  throughout the radio show today on any issue item or new story you wish to
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  discuss and there are plenty of them
[09:56.000 --> 10:12.000]  1800-259-9231 climate denial astro turfers should stop hiding behind
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  pseudonyms online to stop oil coal and electricity companies inserting their
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  views into the media by stealth we need to make blog commenters accountable
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  now this is George Monbiott out of the London Guardian
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  now George Monbiott a month ago was a signatory with several hundred other
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  major media columnist calling for a one-world government he signed an open
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.000]  letter calling for a world government
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  one of the other signers wrote a story for the Financial Times of London we
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  talked a lot about called and now for world government where it says yes we
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  want an authoritarian world government run by private banks that you will pay
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  all your carbon taxes to that will chronicle and categorize everything you
[10:59.000 --> 11:12.000]  do and how you live your life
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  now we simultaneously are seeing news articles here in the United States and
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.000]  bills introduced and the major media beating the drum to license bloggers
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  license you so that you're allowed to have your free speech and so the
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  government establishment says you're certified information and they want to
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  pass lobbying laws where you can't come out and criticize the bill or a piece
[11:41.000 --> 11:49.000]  of legislation but then the big banks the big oil companies by the way they're
[11:49.000 --> 11:55.000]  all supporting the global carbon tax they can run around and push all the
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  propaganda they want all day but that if you speak out against them on your
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  blog or your MySpace or anywhere else you're not allowed to and they're
[12:02.000 --> 12:09.000]  actually proposing this they're not just introducing cyber bullying acts and
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  hate crime acts one of them that's past the house that say that if you
[12:14.000 --> 12:22.000]  influence somebody to go out and do something illegal that you're going to
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  be held accountable and we've got Obama running around saying oh we're going
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  to arrest people for crimes they might commit in the future with no evidence
[12:31.000 --> 12:43.000]  and definitely hold them this is all tyranny on steroids and every time I
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.000]  get up on air and I explain the sun is causing the earth to warm and now that
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  the sun is cooled off is not putting as much radiation it's causing the earth
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  to cool every time I go on the air and play video when we're simulcasting at
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.000]  planet.tv of the composite satellite images from the 1970s till now during
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  the spring and summer the ice cap gets smaller on the north and south the
[13:09.000 --> 13:17.000]  Arctic and the Antarctic and during the winter it gets bigger but the media
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  every year only shows you the spring and summer and says look it's all
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.000]  disappearing it's all melting right now in a parlor trick in a scam in a
[13:25.000 --> 13:31.000]  fraud and every time I do that I get scores of emails and people commenting
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  all over info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and all over YouTube and
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  everywhere else I'm not even looking for this stuff and I see it everywhere
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.000]  saying Alex Jones works for oil companies Alex Jones is lying he's
[13:44.000 --> 13:51.000]  paid to lie I mean it's a fact that the ice caps expand by 33% on average and
[13:51.000 --> 13:58.000]  contract by 33% during the summer they get smaller during the winter they get
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  bigger it's a fact that polar bear numbers are up it's a fact they swim out
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  of the ice flows and hunt beluga whale and seal it's a fact they're not
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  dying it's a factor not drowning because the all the ice melted the ice didn't
[14:12.000 --> 14:20.000]  melt it's one of the biggest expansions in record last winter and now it's
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  contracting and they show that on the news they show a contracting and show
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  you a few months of a contracting and and know they're lying and when I had
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  David the Rothschild on a few years ago he's in in game blueprint for global
[14:35.000 --> 14:43.000]  enslavement he said you work for an oil company you're being paid by the oil
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  companies you own oil I started laughing at him and he went no you do you do
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  don't you when the Rothschilds are some of the biggest holders of private land
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.000]  and oil company stocks in the world on record and the oil companies have all
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  got behind man made global warming and global tax they're all behind it ladies
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.000]  and gentlemen I have so much evidence I don't know where to start I told you
[15:10.000 --> 15:19.000]  that last week I was in a Barnes and Nobles and I had this idea as I was
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  walking past a magazine rack I said I'm going to close my eyes walk up that
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  magazine rack and I'm going to reach into the rack and grab two magazines and
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  then I'm going to read those magazines and I'm going to cover the propaganda
[15:33.000 --> 15:42.000]  in them and I pulled a woman's magazine and I left that at home I didn't get
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  through that one there was so much propaganda I couldn't even get to do one
[15:45.000 --> 16:01.000]  of them and I pulled the Atlantic Atlantic Monthly and I pulled the
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  Atlantic and then I sat down that night and tried to read it and ladies and
[16:06.000 --> 16:14.000]  gentlemen half half of the advertisers every other page is a full page ad by
[16:14.000 --> 16:20.000]  oil companies saying global warming surreal need global tax now here is
[16:20.000 --> 16:28.000]  Mr. Monbiott George Monbiott saying that the oil companies are secretly funding
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  bloggers and scientists that don't believe in man-made global warming and
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  that we need to have our free speech band he also again writes articles calling
[16:35.000 --> 16:45.000]  for dictatorial world government and it's all the same all these writers it's a
[16:45.000 --> 16:51.000]  carbon copy and then openly I walk up and randomly grab two magazines and the
[16:51.000 --> 16:59.000]  woman's magazine get the name was it look or sell for something I couldn't I
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  started looking in the first few pages were drug ads and Prozac type drug ads
[17:03.000 --> 17:09.000]  and your husband's bad ads and you don't need marriage anymore divorce is good
[17:09.000 --> 17:16.000]  and I didn't footnote that one I footnoted Atlantic the Atlantic July
[17:16.000 --> 17:25.000]  August 2009 issue and this one says marriage isn't good this has an article
[17:25.000 --> 17:35.000]  titled getting over marriage like let me get the exact headline I'll see it here
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.000]  it's it's near the end I've got it footnoted the point is we go live at
[17:40.000 --> 17:46.000]  prison planet dot TV later I'm gonna show you the actual Atlantic month the
[17:46.000 --> 17:54.000]  article but but there's a whole other area of this we're literally submerged
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.000]  we're drowning we're being held under propaganda you look at Times Square
[18:00.000 --> 18:05.000]  New York City with the flashing telescreens and the blurbs and being
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.000]  bombarded by media everywhere we've all got our Apple iPhones bombarding us with
[18:09.000 --> 18:15.000]  news and information government propaganda there's radio TV everywhere
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  we're losing our humanity and something like the Atlantic or the economist is
[18:20.000 --> 18:27.000]  targeting the middle class the supposed upper crust the upper middle class and
[18:27.000 --> 18:33.000]  when you read one of these it's just total propaganda total dehumanization
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.000]  and this is what I randomly grabbed off the shelf there were hundreds and
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.000]  hundreds and hundreds of magazines hundreds of them and you can grab
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  anything but but when you grab something that intelligence here read it's just
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  all propaganda in your face but when you read kind of the general public
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  magazines it's all about distractions diversions not caring about your
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  neighbor just being blissfully unaware and when you watch the teleprompter
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  reading info babes it's all giggling and laughing and everything's happy it's all
[19:05.000 --> 19:11.000]  meant to soothe you and they'll talk about some horrible tyranny like it's a
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  good thing but then they'll talk about somebody who's for liberty and freedom
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  and occasionally frown about them and it's all about body language ladies and
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  gentlemen if you take away anything from this radio show it's this you're being
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.000]  bombarded constantly with an agenda of enslavement and dehumanization and
[19:27.000 --> 19:33.000]  death I mean the two magazines I grabbed off the shelf randomly I'm ten feet
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  away I close my eyes I walk up hands out grab two magazines open them some ladies
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  looking at me like I'm a lunatic but I wanted to just randomly test enemy
[19:42.000 --> 19:47.000]  operations and it hit me and hit me hard it blew me over it's everything just
[19:47.000 --> 19:52.000]  total devastation and now they want to ban our free speech so we can just you
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.000]  know try to fend off their attacks these bastards are so criminal and so cold
[19:57.000 --> 20:03.000]  blooded mom be out knows exactly what he's doing how would you like to cook any

[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  the enemy's own manuals their own public documents and I am a expert on the
[24:38.000 --> 24:45.000]  new world order and general knowledge of their operations and it is hard for
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.000]  me totally dedicated to this to be able to grasp all the things they're doing
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  because it's like a hive of locust that just operate is like a hive colony of
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.000]  corrupt lion's insects that have all these instincts of evil and deception
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.000]  and duplicity I mean the the oil companies are openly financing the
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  global carbon tax move because they're owned by the big central banks but then
[25:11.000 --> 25:18.000]  they could put out the hoax that oil companies are financing anti-global
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  warming news and then openly this isn't the only magazine I've seen time
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  magazine Newsweek all of you've seen it if you're at the dentist office or a
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  beauty salon today or anywhere pick up a news magazine it's all global
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  carbon tax and how great it is and how great global government is and then
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  I'm called a cook and people say it doesn't exist when I play the pope
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  calling for a world government or I play Al Gore calling for it they can call for
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  it everywhere and then then they have newspapers call up and ask me if I'm
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  crazy if it exists thinking it exists I mean it's just crazy mind games folks
[25:56.000 --> 26:04.000]  and almost all of these newspaper reporters people like mom be out lives
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  in London drink sodium fluoride every day probably shoots his kids up with
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  vaccines full of mercury I see Bill Clinton on TV all the time looking like
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  he's about to die drinking diet Coke full aspartame these people are all eating
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  their own poison I don't know you're a bunch of lunatics man I mean you know
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  you're crazy like a fox you are in control you are a pack of liars and
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  deceivers people trying to destroy our freedom of speech in fact print me that
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  article guys I forgot to do it this morning I don't want to just source
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  anything without actually having it for people because folks are lazy and they
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.000]  won't believe it well you guys print me up well you guys print me up the
[26:44.000 --> 26:54.000]  headline journalist prominent journalist sign sign letter calling for
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  world government and just add mom be out and I'm going to get the exact
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  headline I think it was times of London or something but that was like a month
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  ago if you understand mom be out writes articles saying there is no
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  world government only cooks and crazies believe in it and then he openly
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  writes articles calling for world government I mean this is a religion of
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.000]  disdain a religion of practicing mental illness on the public that's why they
[27:19.000 --> 27:26.000]  claim they killed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed more than 12 or 13 times we've done
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  Steve Watson's done stories counting it up and they would say they killed him
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  two months before and then say oh we killed him again and they never
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  retract the last time they killed him and they did that with chemical Ali and
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  Saddam's sons and a bunch of and they do it on purpose they practice lying
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  having it openly be a lie it's like Obama saying he's fighting against
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.000]  loopholes for the bankers to getting stimulus money and brokerage firms and
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  then it turns out he signed the executive order and ordered Senator Dodd to
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  put it on as a rider in the stimulus package and then they blame Dodd and
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  tried to hang out their own minion and Dodd turned against them and said you
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.000]  told me to do that you signed the executive order I mean just levels of
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  deceit I've never seen and they'll even burn their own people for no reason
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  that even serve them it's why would you any of you even psychos want to serve
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  people like this who want to kill everybody even if you're a psycho you're
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  not getting a place at the table dummy but you just are so enamored with the
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  evil and the destructiveness and the mass killing like a moth like a
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.000]  demonic interdimensional hellraiser insect that is flying towards the
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  vortex of death a black flame black sunshine just flying into the mouth of
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.000]  this hell force I don't understand it's just insane until you realize it's a
[28:46.000 --> 28:52.000]  title force of evil it's just a self-destructive turn the chess board
[28:52.000 --> 29:02.000]  over crap in your own nest a lot of people do the things they do I realize
[29:02.000 --> 29:07.000]  that society is imploding it's falling apart everywhere and I never had some
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  high view of myself as some strong person or smart person or decent person
[29:11.000 --> 29:17.000]  or wholesome person but I guess I really am I see I recognize all the evil in
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  myself all the greed all the pettiness and I don't like it but I guess that's
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  what it is to be good though see I've always felt guilty and bad but see I
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.000]  guess that's what it is to be good most these people don't even feel any of it
[29:32.000 --> 29:38.000]  they don't even recognize good and evil it's a fun game for Monbiot to call for
[29:38.000 --> 29:45.000]  banning free speech and you bastard I'm gonna come back take your calls but

[46:03.000 --> 46:09.000]  they have none of it no discernment that they'll never have higher knowledge
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  that they'll never discover the secrets of life that I'm just beginning to
[46:14.000 --> 46:20.000]  discover and it's like lightning it's incredible it's magic and so much
[46:20.000 --> 46:29.000]  human potential I feel sad for FBI agents I feel sad for BATF agents a

[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  sorry for people who attacked me not even because their government agents
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  and have joined the evil but because they're peddling arrogant and frustrated
[46:50.000 --> 46:56.000]  and jealous of my success jealous of someone going into a fiery building

[47:15.000 --> 47:31.000]  threatened by sincerity you are in this for the wrong reason
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.000]  you should have a spirit of wanting to pour yourself out in service to humanity
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.000]  wanting to pour yourself out in resistance to tyranny wanting to resist
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  the bullies and the thugs you should be able to image what's happening to
[47:42.000 --> 47:47.000]  children and women and men in bondage worldwide the horrible suffering the
[47:47.000 --> 47:55.000]  torture the captives the fact that the evil system revels in caging
[47:55.000 --> 48:04.000]  humanity revels in enslaving humanity revels in degrading and revels in
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  having the power and not being able to be resisted or ever brought to justice
[48:08.000 --> 48:19.000]  all of us myself included but every day because we're immersed in evil and
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  corruption and decadence we have to hit our knees even if you don't believe in
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.000]  God or a creator and can't see them just a magical creation all around you
[48:29.000 --> 48:37.000]  and just the far-outness of we have dreams incredible stories while we're

[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  psyche bend our soul away from all that's wholesome and good and upright we
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.000]  all even if you don't believe in God you should believe in the human soul and
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  the human spirit and its connection to things greater and you should realize
[49:14.000 --> 49:20.000]  we're all spoiled brats myself included and you should know what Chronicles 7
[49:20.000 --> 49:25.000]  14 says give my people what you're called by my name shall humble themselves

[57:16.000 --> 57:21.000]  him I don't know probably 10 times yeah in one of the times I think it's a couple
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.000]  years ago you were telling him about when you had predicted 9-11 in July of
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  that year on your show and told people to call the White House and you were
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  telling him that you had done that and then and you said to him you told him
[57:38.000 --> 57:44.000]  and then you said that's the kind of sources I have in the Pentagon I was
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  wondering what he meant by that yeah I say stuff on air and I've gotten probably
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  50 emails over the years about that like oh my god that was secret radio
[57:52.000 --> 57:58.000]  transmission and I've been you know caught but no I mean I said that on air I
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.000]  remember getting calls from people saying something big's coming up we're not sure
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  what it is and I've said that over and over again on air I could also see all
[58:07.000 --> 58:11.000]  the chatter the way they were building up on the media the way the feds had bombed
[58:11.000 --> 58:20.000]  the World Trade Center the first time in 93 and yeah absolutely that's what I mean
[58:20.000 --> 58:27.000]  people in the Pentagon told you that some they were planning something like that was coming up
[58:27.000 --> 58:35.000]  specifically I picked up on 9-11 being an inside job because I saw the whole
[58:35.000 --> 58:41.000]  preparatory build up towards it hold on I'll try to explain it to you

[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  know some stations just now tuned in kind of like XM only carries the last
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  three hours of the Friday show so I want to recap he just called in and said
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  you had Bob Bowman on former head of the Star Wars program talking about a
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  couple days ago and years ago he was on your show and you were talking about
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  how you predicted 9-11 and on July 25th launched Operation Exposed Government
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Terrorists on your TV show and radio show said call the White House tell them
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  don't blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on your CIA asset who some have
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  been lauding then I added that's the kind of sources I have in the Pentagon and
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  yes as I've said hundreds of times there are just thousands of different data
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  points and they were in a preparatory phase in the mainstream media over and
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  over and over again saying that terrorists are going to attack when they
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  attack give all your rights up America is not going to be the same and I knew
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  the feds had already hit the World Trade Center in 93 I could see the
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  preparation and then I did get some phone calls from individuals saying you're
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  right there's going to be a big terror attack in the next three months but
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  that's not just me the Washington Post in fact I'm going to try to print this
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  article up on September 10th ran an article written by a retired military
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  officer I've got to pull it to remember exactly what's saying Israel may stage
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  a terror attack as a pretext to get us involved in Middle East very soon
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  including with nukes now again I'm not waiting in on Israel running the 9-11
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  attacks my issue is a lot of people were trying to get warnings out a lot of
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  people knew this was coming so yes sir I got unspecific warnings and I've put
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  that on record does that answer your question David from Venezuela yeah yeah
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  yeah let me ask the second one you said this on air many times and this is I'm
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  asking you just to try to get an insight into the workings of the machine you
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  know you said that they've tried to hire you you know offer you big contracts
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  and kind of buy you off or whatever I was wondering if you could say who what
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  companies that was and what what what terms they tried to get you into and
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  how much they offered you well as a journalist when I'm wearing that hat
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  if somebody says this is off the record it's been off the record that's the whole

[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  blogs and media the hate crimes bill the cyberbullying
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  bill that is all coming up and but first I want to take some of your phone calls
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  who've been holding since the last hour people that are patiently holding there like anonymous
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  Joseph Frank Vicki Rich and others but I had a caller for stations that just joined
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  us he was asking about the fact that I've
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  mentioned many times on air that I've had offers at selling out
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  some of them have been veiled others have been overt
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  but I wear many hats I wear the hat of a
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  filmmaker I wear the hat of a syndicated radio host I wear the hat of a journalist we've broken a lot of
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  national stories and so when someone says this is off
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  record unless it's illegal what they're telling me
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  and you know completely immoral I don't break
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  that confidence that's why I'm known as somebody who people
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  don't have confidence I mean I know a lot of really huge Hollywood stars
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  some of the biggest and it's kind of like
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  when I was like 1314 my dad said you know the secret
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  to the girls liking you in school is kiss and don't tell
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  you know dads when you're on fishing trips tell you these things
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  and he told you don't act desperate with a girl if you like
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  or tell her that be confident kiss and don't tell boy I put that into function it was
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  girls wanted to be kissed because you know they
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  they wanted me to take them on a date but they didn't want me to talk about everything that happened
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  on the day so it's called journalistic sources
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  and it's the same thing I've been at the Texas
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Capitol going back 12 plus years ago and
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  had people like well let's just say
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  at as high level as you get in the state government walk over and say Alex
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  this off record I'm sure if you'd like it to be
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  look these slaves don't want your help and you ought to work with
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  the system some of us aren't that bad but we know the system is corrupt we work through it and you just ought
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  to join us you're a young smart guy
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  you ought to play ball with us one time
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  I had a very very famous
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  local Democrat in Texas a big campaign donor to Bill Clinton
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  calling me up and say we like your show
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  and you're a smart guy and you could move up in Democratic Party politics you're good looking
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  you're smart I guess this was about 97
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  I was on the radio and local cable TV and he said you ought to quit bashing
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  Bill Clinton and you ought to know what a great guy he is and you ought to come over to some of our meetings and
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  you know
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  getting involved with us
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  and then about a month later I went on a bash Bill Clinton a bunch more called him a criminal
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  and stuff and played video him with the Chinese general shaking their hands and I got this
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  threatening phone calls the guy had my home number my home number was the cable TV hot
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  hotline number people you know comment line I was in a little apartment
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  and I got called up saying you've done it now I can't believe you did that so I mean you know
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  that's an example right there or you have a radio
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  executive of one of the big three syndicators isn't even really around
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  today I guess this is like a 90 1997
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  fly into Austin
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  and take me out to eat at a local Chinese
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  food restaurant and say Alex do you want
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  to be on a crusade which is going
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  nowhere you're not going to put on a bunch of stations you're not going to get your word out you're just going to
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  probably not end up not even being on radio because you know stations get bought and sold
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  and you're lucky to be on the air locally that's really hard
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  to do or do you want to be a big star
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  no more black helicopters no more fellow reserve and I said is this an offer
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  at a payoff and he said no this is the
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  way the world works you're talented you have
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  incredible radio presence you reach out and grab people and you deserve
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  producers and support and you can make a million dollars in the first year
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  you could be the next rush limbaugh and of course I knew they done this to a hundred
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  young punks you know I wasn't being you know deluded by this but
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  the money was offered and I said thanks but no thanks and they couldn't
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  believe it and then I had other meetings with other radio people who weren't even that big
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  and there were similar offers
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  but stand up for the second amendment not losing the
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  the deer rifle
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  that my dad's dad gave him that my dad gave
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  me the equivalent of that of a
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  sword that had been passed down I cared more about that
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  sword than about all the money in the world do you understand
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  that I don't want to lose
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  that I care more about my children
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  I didn't know why I was the way I've learned more about instincts and what makes this
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  perfect but I cared more about my children than I
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  hadn't even had yet and their future generations
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  I love them all and I want them to exist
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  I know what we do now at this key crossroads controls the destiny of humanity
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  we can't hand over that responsibility to these tyrants
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  and control freaks and these people that are very very
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  spiritually broken and weak
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  and so I turned that down
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  and I've been offered
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  a couple national TV shows
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  and this is what we want you to do
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  and we want you to kind of be a clown
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  and we'll put you on national TV
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  and I go you know I'm not really interested in that
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  and then production companies go okay well
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  we'll do it according to how you'd like to do it and then they pitch that
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  and they say no so you know I mean I don't even care now
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  I mean I think I've had three or four national production
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  companies call me to
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  pay me to go do pilots and even do it my way I mean I'm being offered TV shows
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  and I'm not even calling them back I'm like nah I don't even want it because I don't even want to go fly
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  around on planes and be with these Hollywood people and film a bunch of stuff and then
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  and then they'll try to go sideways on me and make me look stupid and then I get in a big fight
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  and you know politically
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  frankly I don't even want to work I want to just make my films my way do it my way
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  even though it's not perfect and do my little radio show and
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  frankly I dream of seeing the south pacific seeing the stars
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  from the southern hemisphere I dream of going to Europe I dream of going
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  to Egypt you know I want to go to Africa I've got
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  a wonderlust I just dream of fishing and swimming
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  in underground cenotes and aquifer skin diving and the aquifers around here
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  I don't even want to let people know there's all these
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  cenotes as they're called in Mexico here in Texas it'll be too crowded when I try to go to them
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  I've been here since I've even gotten to go to one
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  it's nothing like swimming around in those caves with light shining down in the big fish
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  and snapping turtles in are in them and it's just heaven
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  getting out on the side of a cypress bank and eating a bologna and cheese sandwich
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  while your kids play with boats and little toy boats
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  just the heat and the crickets and the bugs and the
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  buzz it's just totally but then when I get in one of those places my soul
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  opens up my humanity opens up and I want to go warn people about the new world order
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  and then I can't be there anymore and I haven't in years been able to even
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  enjoy nature and I have to stumble back out up the cliffs
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  to the car parking lot and drive back and start trying to warn people and then I
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  overwork and do it half ass and go in all these different directions and I just
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  all I can tell you
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  folks is this is real
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  the new world order is real
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  and I am making a sacrifice to be here doing this I am sick of this
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  so many stacks of news and corruption and evil
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  that I don't even want to focus on it because when I focus then all the connections
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  and the operations and the enemy program and different sectors of it
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  three dimensional map pulls up in my mind from all my study and I get a headache by the end of the show
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  and I get upset and I am like my god and I see what they are doing to us
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  I mean these families call me in mass who were having
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  their children taken and I can't help them
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  and all these government sources and police and military
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  calling me and incredible breaking news and videos and documents and
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  FBI training films and I don't even have time to get it on the
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  web or analyze it or break it down and all the big news we have broken the DHS
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  and MYAC and clergy response teams and
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  wars and what was going to happen with the stock market and housing bubbles
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  and having all this knowledge having all this data
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  having all this discernment
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  and then knowing there is no way to even warn people or tell people
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  and then having them argue is it real
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  is it real god almighty look around you
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  alright look I am going to at least take five or six calls and I got to get into all this global warming
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  global tax news and bunch of other stuff
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  The phone rings and the questions are asked
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  Will the life change tea help me? Our answer is always the same

[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  Starves or surrender

[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  They came and took it all away
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  The lanes in the middle
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  It was an inside job just like it always is
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  All right, let's get through some of your calls
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Because I do have a ton of news that I want to get to as well
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  We'll continue with calls
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  Some Bob Chapman's on with a sandwich tartare coming up
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  It's incredible how fast these shows go by when I start pontificating
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  Those were heavy questions
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  Wow, you really have sources in the Pentagon? Yeah
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Unbelievable stuff. It's huge news
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  But I'm writing a book
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  And I'm doing a film and I keep saying I'm going to get this video up
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  That's worse than the MIAC report, worse than DHS about conservatives and gun owners being terrorist
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  And then I have so few personnel
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  And then I've tried to grow my operation
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  But we're so busy doing all these other things
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  It's just insane and just stacks of things and people calling up saying I'm losing my house
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Help me do a money bomb to pay for my house
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  And then listeners saying this and I'm like well I can't do that
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  If I do one listeners money bomb then everybody would expect a money bomb for themselves
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  I could be like a liar like Obama and just hug them and say oh I'm going to get you a house
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  And then not do it as if I can do that as if I can barely even pay my own bills
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  And then if I tell people hey you can't start doing this
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  You can't ask for money on my forum, then I'm bad
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  It's not just going out and fighting the New World Order
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  It's dealing with all the politics and then people think you're omnipresent and all powerful
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  And you can wave magic wands and do a story on this, do a report on that
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  Hey you're not talking about this flu thing enough
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  I saw something on 9-Eleven Blogger attacking me saying I hadn't covered the nanothermite reports
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  I just did a Google and it was like 15 articles we posted in the last 2 months
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  And 4 or 5 guests on it and actually we had Richard Gage on
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  6 times and it's not enough
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  I'm covering up the nanothermite, in fact I blew the towers up
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  It's me and again it's not even frustrating me that I have all these lies told about me
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  It's that I'm the bad one, it's that I did everything
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  I was the bad one, but it's like helping a drowning man
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  That parents when I was a little kid at a German Shepherd that if you were swimming
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  You couldn't take it swimming with you because it would come out and claw you trying to save you
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  But it's kind of the reverse of this, it's like trying to help a drowning man
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  I'm like let me help you, there's a New World Order, you did it
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  They're pushing me under, you're the New World Order
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  But I'm not going to be negative, I know I'm doing the right thing
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  I know I'm for real, I know I'm legitimate and I know I'm going to move forward
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  I'm going to move forward and try to warn people about vaccines that are killing them
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  And Kim trailing what's going on that's mainstream news
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Wars and torture and government child kidnapping rings
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  And government corruption and Obama lying about everything
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  I'm just here saying wow look at all this bad stuff, what does humanity want to do
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  We need to stand together and say no
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  And humanity it's easier to say no, we're not going to fix any of this, we're going to get you
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  It's your fault and so all I can say is folks
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Society is collapsing, this is the big depression, this is the New World Order
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  This is real, it's all happening now, this is just the beginning of the slide downward
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  Let's take a call
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  A ton of news is coming up, this isn't some radio show
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  With a big act, a liberal act or a conservative act
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  This is one guy who's tuned into what the elite are saying
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  And doing and let me tell you it's scary folks
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  And all I'm not trying to tell you to believe what I say or what I do, I'm just telling you
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  You don't know the full picture, you're being manipulated, we're being lied to, none of us have the full picture
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  All we know is a bunch of crooks are running things and we better do something about it
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  Anonymous in Canada, you're on the air anonymous
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  We're out from Maddox
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  Go ahead, yes go ahead
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  I can't do this stuff back and forth with people
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  I'm sorry, Joseph in California, Joseph you're on the air, go ahead
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Hello Alex, it's an honor to be on your show
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  I appreciate all the work you've done, I'm your legend of work time
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  I'd like to get on the foster care agency and the traffic bolt
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  I was a survivor from 1994 to 1999
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  I tried to get my parents convicted of murder which were completely impossible about a baby that I buried
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  They tried to break and watch me to believing that
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  I had helped bury the baby and everything, I mean, they were doing all kinds of bad stuff
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  My sister's got molested and it's just an awful system
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  I'm telling the listeners right now, this is no lie, this is very true
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  You want to write that story up, you want to post that on the web
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  Everybody should tell their horror stories about what government did to them
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  I appreciate your call, you got a bad phone
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  We'll come back and try to take a few more calls and see if we can get on the phone when people hear
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  You know, my cell phone when I use it cuts out about half the time I'm using
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  And everybody's on Skype phones and IP phones now
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  And I'm not complaining, I'm just pointing out
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  Is our communications getting better? As Joe Rogan said
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  My 2,000 were supposed to be flying around on silver jetpacks
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  Instead, my cell phone craps out every time I step behind a bush
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  Inner Health Botanicals, this company produces the highest quality superfood around
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  It's called Inner Food, my wife just loves the stuff
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  His Editors Choice Award, or Best Superfood of 2009
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients, no fillers, no sweeteners
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price and their formula really works
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  This is the real thing for the great health you need
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  Try the Nutra Cafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  Don't forget to try their other great products
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  Go to www.ENERFOD.com

[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  A long time sponsor of ours
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  This is Alex Jones
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  Well you should

[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  And secure a 30 state concealed weapons permit

[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  Plus if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free spring filled armory XV pistol
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  In the caliber of your choice
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  Now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  Front site provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes

[1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  I was a highwayman
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:11.000]  Along the coach roads I did ride
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:15.000]  Life's one hell of an adventure
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  We're only here one time
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  I've made the decision
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  To be legitimate
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  To be upfront
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  Try to be wholesome
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  To be for real
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  And to be a good guy
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  But if you're a good guy
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  You can't just say you're a good guy
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  And then ignore all the evil that's going on around you
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  See, good propaganda
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  The elite has written
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  And Joseph Goebbels said this
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  So did Edward Bernays
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  The father of kind of western propaganda
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  In the last hundred years
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  That it speaks to your laziness
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  It speaks to your archetypes
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  It speaks to rationalization
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  People want to ignore things
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  You can't ignore the corruption
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  That's out of control anymore, ladies and gentlemen
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  All right, let's go back to the calls, as promised here
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  Let's talk to Frank in North Carolina
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  Here on the air. Thanks for holding, Frank
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  Hey, Alex. I appreciate you taking my call
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  Appreciate you calling. I appreciate that good, clear phone line
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  Well, I thought you would appreciate that
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  I normally don't have the opportunity to do this
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  But I figured I'd take advantage of it
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  And so I am on a regular phone
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  I woke up back in 2005
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  It's the first time I've ever called you
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  I've been listening to your show ever since then
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  And trying to wake up as many people as I can
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  But I was so caught up
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  I'm embarrassed that it took me that long to wake up
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  I'm 43. I was so caught up in watching the insanity of the left
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  That I wasn't paying enough attention to what the right was up to
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  I voted for George Bush. I'm ashamed to say
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  I voted for him twice
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  My father, before that, did vote for Ron Paul
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  And the Republican primary this past year
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  And I could not vote for McCain or Obama
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  But anyway, that's a little bit about me
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  But I credit you with helping me to break free
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  Of that false left paradigm
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  And also, Alan Watt has been instrumental
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  In me really understanding the bigger picture
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  And I don't know how he does it
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  His knowledge is amazing, as is yours
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  But anyway...
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  Well, what is amazing is that when you research what Alan Watt's saying
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  Which we've done, it's all true
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  No matter how wild it sounds, it's all sourced
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  But see, I'll stop a lot of times and try to source when I'm saying
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  Alan, it's real smooth, because a lot of times he won't even source it
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  He posts it on the side of sourcing
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  But he just says it as fact
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  And so it just really comes off well
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  I'll go ahead and announce, there's some bigger surprises
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  But he is in the next Obama film
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  It's hard to get into Canada
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  Especially if you're anti-New World Order
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  But we got in, interviewed him for two days
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  He's going to be in the next two films
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  The eugenics film, and the next Obama film
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  And so Alan Watt is in the next film
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  But side-issue, go ahead
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  Actually, he does source quite a bit of what he says
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  People will spend that as a jive, I'm not saying that
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  I know, I'm just saying
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  He will sometimes just make these statements
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  And then he won't stop and source
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:17.280]  He'll just say it's on the site and I'm just saying it's very smooth how he does it.
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:22.840]  You know a lot of times he will tell you the name of the book that the person wrote and
[1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:26.920]  he won't maybe give you the exact page but he'll give you the name of the person and
[1:36:26.920 --> 1:36:27.920]  what not.
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:30.840]  But anyway, I was in the Marine Corps for four years after high school.
[1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:34.280]  It's something that I had planned on doing and I did my four years and got out and that's
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:35.280]  what I planned on doing.
[1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:39.600]  I went back to school, got a bachelor's degree and what not but anyway you know that's the
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:45.840]  only time in my entire life that I've ever had to raise my hand and take an oath and
[1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:48.840]  swear allegiance.
[1:36:48.840 --> 1:36:53.000]  They made me do that before I went down to Parris Island for basic and I had to swear
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:57.560]  an oath to defend, to uphold and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:03.600]  and domestic and as best I can remember there was no expiration date on that.
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:04.600]  Well there isn't.
[1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:06.180]  I'm almost sure there wasn't.
[1:37:06.180 --> 1:37:12.120]  There isn't and the New World Order uses our best men, a few good men to carry out all
[1:37:12.120 --> 1:37:16.440]  these New World Order actions and always frames it like we're the good guys and a lot of times
[1:37:16.440 --> 1:37:22.240]  we are but they don't tell the Marines, oh by the way the globalists funded that thug
[1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:28.240]  or that revolutionary group built them up as the pretext to then bring in the Marines
[1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:34.000]  or the Army and so it's that playing chess instead of checkers is what a lot of folks
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:35.640]  call it.
[1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:40.560]  They have to start playing chess instead of checkers and figure out how sophisticated
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:45.320]  this is like oh we bomb Qaddafi, he's the bad guy but as soon as he does what the New
[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:53.760]  World Order says now he's a good guy, again it's the truth is black and white but it's
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:59.000]  more sophisticated and it's hard to find out what the real black and white are.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:03.400]  You know it's easy to say oh things are black and white which they are but how do you find
[1:38:03.400 --> 1:38:07.920]  what's really black and what's really white because the enemy is great at camouflaging
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:08.920]  everything.
[1:38:08.920 --> 1:38:13.880]  It's like Donald Rumsfeld gave the reactors in North Korea, the West, Arm, Pakistan with
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:22.640]  the nukes that's on record, again they're creating these enemies and then well like
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:27.240]  Saddam Hussein basically telling him April Gillespie to go ahead and attack Kuwait and
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:31.200]  he'd been told to go ahead and attack Iran and was funded and so when he got told to
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:36.440]  do that he said well hell I'll do it then, I mean he was recruited by the CIA at 18 years
[1:38:36.440 --> 1:38:43.080]  of age on record, he was sent in, he committed assassinations in Iraq, he was put in power
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:49.320]  by the West, he was set up, is that saying he's good, no, the point is who set it up,
[1:38:49.320 --> 1:38:56.800]  it's kind of like a mafia chief and he sends out his capos to order the soldiers to carry
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:05.360]  out crimes and then they bust the captains and the privates and they're in a judgment
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:13.040]  at Nuremberg trial and the judge is the don, the judge is the crime boss that sent them.
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:20.240]  Here's an example of hypocrisy and I've, you know, this was the mainstream news in 2004.
[1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:26.240]  They were arresting people as kind of sacrificial goats who had tortured people to death in Afghanistan
[1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:31.920]  at these bases and then the guys would go hey I was ordered to a national security letter,
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:37.000]  the FBI would arrest them, this was in the news and declare Patriot Act powers and gag
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:40.320]  them so they couldn't show those orders to torture.
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:46.040]  Now torture is bad enough folks but when you get caught torturing so you burn the guys
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:51.320]  that follow the orders, that's a level of hypocrisy that just blows me away.
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:52.560]  Anything else, Frank?
[1:39:52.560 --> 1:39:57.960]  One quick note and then a final question, I'm sure you're going to be covering this
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:03.840]  if you haven't already, Burmese may have covered it last night or sometime but Wayne
[1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:07.880]  Madsen has just come out with a report on something, key words would be the Q group
[1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:12.560]  and the NSA, a special unit for the purpose of suppressing news media and whistleblowers
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:16.600]  with anything related to 9-11 so everybody make a note of that.
[1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:22.880]  Okay, I didn't hear this, go to WayneMadsenreport.com right now, this is too important, call Wayne
[1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:28.120]  Madsen right now, see if he can pop in right now or if he can pop in next hour with Chapman.
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:31.400]  Madsen, by the way, is another guy where no matter how wild it sounds, it always comes
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:35.800]  out later he was right on issue after issue.
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:40.280]  You know why I can confirm, I haven't confirmed what you're saying yet but remember the Violent
[1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:48.080]  Radicalization Act that they were having two years ago hearings in Congress about and they
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:53.960]  showed architects and engineers, Richard Gage, they showed video of him next to Al Qaeda
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:57.920]  training groups and said this is Al Qaeda, we've got to ban these groups, they've had
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:04.000]  Army colonels on the news, on Fox saying kill bloggers and then the Cybersecurity Command
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:10.240]  Head a month and a half ago said we're going to attack U.S. bloggers and then two years
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:16.680]  ago they had the Pentagon announced CENTCOM out of Florida, said we're now going to engage
[1:41:16.680 --> 1:41:22.080]  in offensive actions against bloggers in the U.S. and then now he's saying it's called
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:25.080]  the Q group.
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:26.080]  Tell me more about this.
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:31.880]  Okay, it's mainly NSA, apparently the FBI, some elements of the FBI are also involved
[1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:37.400]  and also private contractors approximately a thousand, according to Wayne Madsen, throughout
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:43.480]  the country heading away in little places I don't know where but to I guess to call
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:50.000]  out and bring to the attention anyone who may be going, you know, be coming out as a
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:57.160]  whistleblower or anyone in the media who may be revealing too much or touching any dangerous
[1:41:57.160 --> 1:42:01.560]  issues that may connect 9-11 in any way with the government.
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:07.360]  I actually watched a video about approximate five-minute interview where he was being interviewed
[1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:12.560]  by someone from the delay between his responses to the question or the guy had a British accent.
[1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:18.200]  I think it was some type of foreign media but it's about a five-minute interview and
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:20.800]  I'm sure he's probably got something on his website about it as well.
[1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:24.640]  Now here it is, we've got it, we'll go ahead and play Wayne Madsen right now.
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:25.640]  What was your question?
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:30.160]  I just, I don't understand, you have all these learned guests on there like Bob Bowman
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:33.640]  for example and you know Mike Rivera and all these guys who, they're with it, they know
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:38.360]  what's going on, they've known for a lot longer than I have but they have this certain reverence
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:43.280]  for Obama and it's so obvious to me right from the beginning this guy is so transparent
[1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:49.240]  what he's all about when you find out who is backing this guy, you know, the Rockefellers,
[1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:54.720]  Brzezinski, all these guys, they handpicked this guy for his talent as a slick showroom
[1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:59.160]  spokesman and these guys still, I mean they sound so intelligent, they're giving, they're
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:03.760]  revealing all this information like Lieutenant Colonel Bob Bowman did the other day but then
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:09.160]  in the end it's like, well, you know, I think he can save us, he'll turn against his masters,
[1:43:09.160 --> 1:43:11.160]  the New World Order and he'll save us and I'm like, he's got it.
[1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:12.920]  And you want to know my take on that?
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:16.800]  All right, I appreciate your call, I mean is that your point, you want my response to
[1:43:16.800 --> 1:43:17.800]  that?
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:18.800]  Yes sir.
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:19.800]  Okay, thank you.
[1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:25.120]  I like Mike Rivera, okay, and I knew he was looking around for a radio show, I don't have
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:28.400]  any control over who gets a show but I told Ted, this is a talented guy, you got to give
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:30.640]  him a radio show and he has one here.
[1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:36.200]  And then he suddenly starts liking Obama and saying, well, you know, he'll end the war
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:37.960]  and he'll do this and that, I think it's great.
[1:43:37.960 --> 1:43:44.240]  Now he immediately, as soon as Obama showed he was a liar, came out and said, I'm against
[1:43:44.240 --> 1:43:49.200]  Obama, Obama's horrible, so you know, Mike's good on that but we had some big arguments
[1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:51.960]  on and on fair about that.
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:43:57.000]  Bowman is trying to play a little politics here, knowing that Obama's popular, a lot
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:01.760]  of folks, you know, he's trying to say, oh yeah, he is controlled by these people and
[1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:05.480]  man, I sure wish he'd rebel against him.
[1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:13.280]  So you know, I don't know, look, I have people on who I don't totally agree with.
[1:44:13.280 --> 1:44:15.360]  I don't totally agree with myself sometimes.
[1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:18.360]  I'll listen to the rebroadcast sometime while I'm working and I'm like, I don't agree with
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:26.680]  how I said that or I got that date wrong, you know, or I'll cross the name of two presidents,
[1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:30.920]  you know, just do crazy stuff because you're on air, you're thinking, all this stuff's
[1:44:30.920 --> 1:44:31.920]  going on.
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:36.400]  So I just, you know what, I don't sit there and judge people who I know are good and fighting
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:45.760]  tyranny and we're 95% on the same page, you know, but yeah, I'll tell you who I think
[1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:51.360]  has a lot of credibility at Swain Madsen and used to work for the NSA and a lot more because
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:54.240]  you know, I'd see this guy saying stuff five, six, seven years ago and I couldn't believe
[1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:56.200]  it and then it always comes out to be true.
[1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:01.400]  I mean, I've never seen Wayne wrong, never seen him wrong.
[1:45:01.400 --> 1:45:07.000]  And here he is with some scary news, but don't let this intimidate you because if we get
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:13.120]  intimidated by this, if we give into this fear, you know, it's good to know this information.
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:14.720]  He's doing a good job putting it out.
[1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:22.200]  But if we give into the fear and then we shut up, they win.
[1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:27.680]  I will tell you this, 9 11 truths now worldwide, it's the majority in the Netherlands.
[1:45:27.680 --> 1:45:28.680]  They've had national polls.
[1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:30.200]  The majority lives inside job here.
[1:45:30.200 --> 1:45:35.160]  They believe they had a nationally televised trial of the evidence of 9 11.
[1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:38.480]  People came out saying it's an inside job.
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:42.280]  All these engineers, all these top engineers and physicists and peer reviewed journals
[1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:44.640]  are coming out saying it's an inside job.
[1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:46.320]  They found the thermite and the thermate folks.
[1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:47.560]  They blew the buildings up.
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:52.680]  I mean, we got the police on CNN saying get back.
[1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:53.680]  We're blowing the building up.
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:45:56.440]  I've talked to the cops who were there and heard it.
[1:45:56.440 --> 1:45:58.000]  They weren't part of it.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:45:59.720]  The debunkers always saying the cops did it.
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:01.560]  No, they were told they're bringing building seven down.
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:03.040]  They're going to blow it up, get back.
[1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:07.360]  And then Larry Silverstein saying it, folks, we have New York police coming up to we are
[1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:08.360]  change.
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:10.280]  It's in truth rising.
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:16.800]  My film saying I'm going to say you have a bomb and I'm going to put you in jail.
[1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:21.480]  I'm saying you're, you have a bomb and the police show up in uniform and say your video
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:24.360]  cameras or guns were arresting you.
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:27.520]  I mean, they're framing people on camera and don't care.
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:28.520]  That's folks.
[1:46:28.520 --> 1:46:32.560]  The mafia runs America and they blew those buildings up as sure as the sun came out this
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:33.560]  morning.
[1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:37.840]  I'm risking my life doing this.
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:41.240]  We have a chance to bring these people down and yes, they're afraid more people in government
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:42.480]  are starting to come out.
[1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:46.240]  They have one of the 9 11 commission members come out a few months ago in mainstream news
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:51.360]  and say, I'm publishing a book in four months saying that the Pentagon met with us secretly
[1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:52.920]  and said, cover this up.
[1:46:52.920 --> 1:46:53.920]  What really happened?
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:54.920]  And we agreed to lie.
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:59.200]  In fact, pull that article up, Watson wrote one 9 11 commission member says, you know,
[1:46:59.200 --> 1:47:00.200]  they agreed to lie.
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:05.200]  I'm going to give the name and info on that and put up on screen for folks at prison planet
[1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:06.200]  TV.
[1:47:06.200 --> 1:47:07.200]  Thanks.
[1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:09.680]  First we'll play Madsen though.
[1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:18.600]  And then we call them, we talked to the publisher.
[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:19.600]  It was a major publisher.
[1:47:19.600 --> 1:47:20.880]  My producers are trying to set them up.
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:22.200]  Oh, we want to have him on about the book.
[1:47:22.200 --> 1:47:27.080]  He goes, oh, he's decided to not publish now.
[1:47:27.080 --> 1:47:30.360]  He's not doing the gun to release the book now.
[1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:31.760]  And a lot of this is a sick game.
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:33.480]  And I'm not saying that's what happened here.
[1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:36.600]  But Bob Bowman, you know, he started coming out against the Star Wars program as an offensive
[1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:41.880]  weapon and saying, well, they're lying about this because he headed the program.
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:45.120]  General Electric came to him and said, how about a million bucks a year, Colonel?
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:48.240]  I mean, that's how this works.
[1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:53.080]  And he said, no, because his integrity was, was, was what, what, was what mattered.
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:56.920]  I mean, they really blew those buildings up folks.
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:48:00.080]  I'm really on air fighting them, risking my life, my family, everything.
[1:48:00.080 --> 1:48:06.080]  And I'm not asking for anybody to go, oh, you're so special, Alex.
[1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:07.680]  I'm doing this because I believe in humanity.
[1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:08.680]  I believe in our future.
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:16.040]  I don't want people that stage giant terror attacks in midtown Manhattan or lower Manhattan
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:17.440]  to run things.
[1:48:17.440 --> 1:48:21.160]  We come back, we'll play this clip because it's exactly five minutes long.
[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:31.000]  Wayne Matson on international television.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  God help us.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  I mean, you know what?
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:38.040]  Every time more evidence of the fact that it's an inside job comes out, I get sad.
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:43.960]  I wish I was wrong about this, but ladies and gentlemen, the government has lied to
[1:48:43.960 --> 1:48:45.720]  you over and over and over again.
[1:48:45.720 --> 1:48:49.080]  Remember, and I only use these cases because they're well known.
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:51.800]  There are tens of thousands declassified that aren't well known.
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:55.760]  Well, when we cover about 20, 30, I don't know, 25 of those or so in the film, in-game
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:49:02.240]  blueprint for global enslavement with the mainstream video clips and mainstream articles
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:04.360]  and government documents.
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:13.960]  But I mean, if they'll take 4,300 plus foster children and radiate them to death, little
[1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:18.480]  kids and take troops in Project Shad and march them into chambers and nerve gas and
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:21.640]  killing our own troops, they'll do anything.
[1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:28.160]  The sky's the limit.
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:29.520]  And that's the point here.
[1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:31.960]  This isn't a game.
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:33.680]  I'm really fighting the new world order.
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:36.240]  I'm really energizing the people.
[1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:37.240]  You're energizing the people.
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:39.280]  We're really having victories.
[1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:40.840]  We got to do something, man.
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:44.960]  The government admitted in congressional hearings, they were doing tests of Army doctors to
[1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:47.680]  see if they'd kill U.S. troops.
[1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:54.760]  You know, they did university studies previous to that in fake settings telling students
[1:49:54.760 --> 1:50:02.480]  to kill people and they found 90-plus percent when ordered to kill someone by an authority
[1:50:02.480 --> 1:50:04.040]  figure would do it.
[1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:09.520]  Those are famous psychology tests, but I mean, they really do it, folks.
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:16.720]  They really take little kids and murder them and put them in a chamber and send high-powered
[1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:21.160]  radiation through their little bodies and then they take them and their blood breaks
[1:50:21.160 --> 1:50:24.960]  out all over them and they start bleeding and they're dead a few hours later.
[1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:26.880]  I mean, they have blistered little skin.
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:31.680]  They really take little and put them in incinerators.
[1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:34.800]  And they do that to test cadres and bevies of psychos.
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:39.360]  They take those psychos and set up larger like a Petri dish of bacteria and grow a larger
[1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:40.360]  host.
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:44.800]  Then they take it into a factory setting and just produce psychopaths with the video games
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:46.320]  and the TV and the culture.
[1:50:46.320 --> 1:50:50.320]  Now they've got a giant, dark Army forging, building up.
[1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:54.640]  Then they go into the last phase with 24 saying torture of kids is good to get answers.
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:57.920]  Then they turn the mass of people into psycho demons.
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:51:01.520]  They've raised a hell force.

[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:44.480]  Guys, go ahead and throw that other article up on the screen, I want to read the headline
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:48.480]  for people if they want to go, read theprisonplanet.com story.
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:55.160]  It has links to mainstream news where the counsel of the 9-11 commission, headline 9-11
[1:54:55.160 --> 1:55:00.320]  commission counsel, government agreed to lie about 9-11, new book from man tasked by government
[1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:05.000]  to help investigate attacks, unveils how official story is almost entirely untrue.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:14.080]  And then we have links to the mainstream media articles there in the story scroll down where
[1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:19.600]  he said that out of the Washington Post and other publications, like I'm going to read
[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:21.240]  that next hour.
[1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:29.360]  Right now let's go to this clip with Wayne Madsen, here it is, Wayne Madsen breaking
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:34.880]  down the domestic spy force to cover up the fact that the Pentagon carried out the attacks,
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:35.880]  carried us.
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:44.120]  Well, it is operating now, it's the NSA security group called the Q group, its headquarters
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:49.480]  are within the national security agency headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, however the group
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:58.360]  also works closely with FBI counterintelligence officers as well as something I learned recently,
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:00.520]  local police department intelligence units.
[1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:07.240]  So it's a very large group, about a thousand agents and informants employed by this secretive
[1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:10.160]  agency within a secretive agency, the NSA.
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:14.280]  Just to make this clear, when you talk about the NSA, of course you're talking about the
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:19.080]  American national security agency, you're saying this is emerging as a whole new branch
[1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:25.080]  of power within the US, now if that is true, is it answerable to?
[1:56:25.080 --> 1:56:32.440]  It's really answerable to no one, on paper of course, this security organization answers
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:37.240]  to the director of the national security agency, General Keith Alexander.
[1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:43.400]  But I've been told by people on the inside that the oversight committees in the House
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:48.280]  of Representatives and the Senate, the House and Senate intelligence committees, as well
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:55.600]  as the congressional offices of Maryland representatives and senators, particularly
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:57:01.080]  representative Dutch Ruppersburg, who represents the national security agency headquarters,
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:06.400]  it's in his district, there are informants even on their staff, so people who come to
[1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:12.800]  them with complaints, that information is passed to this NSA security group.
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:18.640]  The NSA, highly secretive course, often with good reason, I must press you on this, what
[1:57:18.640 --> 1:57:24.880]  evidence do you have to suggest all these claims you are making?
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:32.040]  I've actually seen documentation about an organization, a program within NSA, it's a
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:37.480]  program called First Fruits, a database, it keeps track of journalists who write about
[1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:44.000]  the national security agency, and also contains information about who they're talking to.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:50.640]  It's a draconian organization, it's prosecuted several people who are just doing their jobs,
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:57.480]  the most egregious being Ken Ford, who was an Iraqi, Iraq's signals intelligence officer
[1:57:57.480 --> 1:58:01.880]  working in the Iraqi shop, who discovered evidence that there was no weapons of mass
[1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:07.200]  destruction, he was set up in a sting operation by this Q group, and it's the most egregious
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:13.280]  case I've ever seen, he was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison based on
[1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:20.760]  a sting that involved a tainted jury pool, dirty judges, dirty prosecutors, and with
[1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:25.240]  the active involvement of this NSA security group, not the only case but the most egregious
[1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:26.240]  I've seen.
[1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:30.560]  Now of course the previous administration, George W. Bush raced ahead with strengthening
[1:58:30.560 --> 1:58:36.960]  and intensifying the powers of security agencies in the US, how is the liberal Obama...
[1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:41.960]  We're going to come back, folks, this is actually on record, stay with us.

[2:00:10.360 --> 2:00:11.360]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:19.960]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin,
[2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:24.240]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.240 --> 2:00:30.920]  Wayne Madsen has broken countless stories that are just huge.
[2:00:30.920 --> 2:00:34.320]  He was the first person, he's up at the National Press Club every day, working for some of
[2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:38.120]  the biggest publications in the country, worked for the National Security Agency.
[2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:40.880]  I sent a crew up there to interview him and they said it was just amazing at the Press
[2:00:40.880 --> 2:00:41.880]  Club.
[2:00:41.880 --> 2:00:45.200]  All these old famous reporters coming over going, off the record, it's New World Order,
[2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:49.600]  it's global government, it's total takeover, Alex is right, Wayne's right, it's bad, but
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:52.440]  we won't talk about it.
[2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:58.480]  And he told us about a story that was going to be breaking soon about white supremacists
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:02.200]  in all these veterans organizations in the Pentagon, and then that came out a few weeks
[2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:07.360]  later on national news, but we didn't run with it because it's, it was kind of a side
[2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:11.960]  issue to our main purview, and I didn't want to list these people's names myself first.
[2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:17.600]  I wanted to wait, in fact, 80%, 90% of the stuff I learn about here, we end up not even
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:23.480]  covering because if I can 100% privy, we just don't even go with it because I'm not in the
[2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:30.240]  business of being sued here, listing a bunch of Army colonels and generals as Nazis.
[2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:33.440]  But that was one of the latest things he, he talked about here that came out mainstream
[2:01:33.440 --> 2:01:37.400]  after he told us internally and name names, it was, it wasn't even him breaking it, it
[2:01:37.400 --> 2:01:39.160]  was other people.
[2:01:39.160 --> 2:01:44.440]  He said it's a manufactured flu virus, this, this is what they're going to do, this is
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:49.780]  what it's really a mixture of, he's talking to microbiologists in DC, months later that
[2:01:49.780 --> 2:01:54.400]  exact thing came out mainstream news, all the scientists saying it was a man made and
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:01:58.400]  all that, but exactly what he said and time and time again, he just breaks really good
[2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:08.000]  news, but when he gets up on air, on foreign television, on RT in this case and talks about
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:14.400]  how they have intelligence units of the NSA using Army intelligence, using local police
[2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:19.440]  to harass 911 truthers and to watch government whistleblowers and to track us and to set
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:20.440]  people up.
[2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:24.320]  Folks, I told you I've been in the parking lot and had the guys block my car and it's
[2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:28.640]  special forces and they go, look, we're watching you and we're, you know, just watch your ass.
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:31.560]  I mean, these, and you know, and you're going, my God, they're just laughing at their car
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:35.920]  and drive off or, you know, they call your wife up and they go, the little white dogs
[2:02:35.920 --> 2:02:36.920]  in the backyard.
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:37.920]  Oh, look, he's eating his food.
[2:02:37.920 --> 2:02:38.920]  My wife walks over.
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:40.800]  Nobody can see in our backyard and there's the white dog.
[2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:44.640]  I mean, these people, you know, they call up and tell my wife, you know, they're a woman
[2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:47.640]  and I've gotten her pregnant and, and then it's a big joke.
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:50.480]  The phone saying US government on it with no phone number.
[2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:53.720]  I mean, they want you to know it's them.
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:03:00.840]  And God, they're murderers and they shipped the heroin in the cocaine in they, they stage
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:05.280]  nine 11 and it's a group within a group now watching the government.
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:11.640]  But remember two years ago, the violent radicalization act, Richard Gage and they put Richard Gage
[2:03:11.640 --> 2:03:15.680]  up on Congress and said, we've got to ban this group and said, he's with this group and
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:17.760]  showed al-Qaeda training videos.
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:21.240]  And now notice they said, nine, 11 truths going to get violent, nine, 11 truths going
[2:03:21.240 --> 2:03:22.240]  to get violent.
[2:03:22.240 --> 2:03:23.960]  And Lynn Beck said, we got to use the army against them.
[2:03:23.960 --> 2:03:27.480]  We got to arrest them and all this talking points.
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:33.000]  And every time somebody, you know, somebody let off a flash bang by the army, Navy recruiting
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:37.640]  center in Times Square and they said, nine, 11 truth that it would no evidence.
[2:03:37.640 --> 2:03:43.800]  And then now you see it fulfilling the reality happening because they did it folks and they
[2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:47.000]  know we're exposing them because he can only come on for like five minutes.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:49.040]  We're going to have him on with Bob Chapman right now.
[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:54.160]  And you know, the issue is I got the army documents a month before it then ended up in
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:56.880]  mainstream news from the army.
[2:03:56.880 --> 2:04:02.160]  I was given the spy and army source where I was under surveillance with Ron Paul at the
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:07.840]  T at the anti fed rallies saying we're terrorist watches folks.
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:12.720]  I'm living a spy novel and all I'm doing saying I don't want foreign bankers raping
[2:04:12.720 --> 2:04:14.720]  me.
[2:04:14.720 --> 2:04:15.720]  Let's go to Bob Chapman briefly.
[2:04:15.720 --> 2:04:19.000]  We're going to come back with him and Wayne Madsen and we're going to let Wayne go quickly
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:20.640]  because he's got to go into a meeting.
[2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:22.960]  But I mean, Bob, this is getting crazy, man.
[2:04:22.960 --> 2:04:25.080]  We're all living a spy novel here.
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:30.720]  I would have never been believed it would have happened this way.
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:36.080]  I'm really, really surprised that some of the players are who they are.
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:42.720]  And you know, the military knows better now they pay these young men a lot of money to
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:43.720]  do what they do.
[2:04:43.720 --> 2:04:46.200]  I hope these young men know that most of them you get killed later.
[2:04:46.200 --> 2:04:49.240]  I hope you know you get killed or sent down the river later.
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:50.240]  Bob, stay there.
[2:04:50.240 --> 2:04:53.800]  Let's briefly come back with Wayne with this and then get in a bunch of financial news
[2:04:53.800 --> 2:04:54.800]  and a lot more.
[2:04:54.800 --> 2:04:55.800]  Stay with us.
[2:04:55.800 --> 2:04:56.800]  Hello, friends.

[2:05:06.600 --> 2:05:07.600]  important than ever.

[2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:17.280]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:19.680]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[2:05:19.680 --> 2:05:22.920]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation that you do.

[2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:04.680]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:07:04.680 --> 2:07:06.960]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:12.600]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor they found that over 260 chemicals
[2:07:12.600 --> 2:07:15.600]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:07:15.600 --> 2:07:19.720]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental
[2:07:19.720 --> 2:07:21.040]  system diseases.
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:22.920]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:27.680]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low cost way to take back control of
[2:07:27.680 --> 2:07:29.440]  you and your family's drinking water.
[2:07:29.440 --> 2:07:34.160]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere

[2:07:39.520 --> 2:07:40.520]  techniques.

[2:07:52.920 --> 2:08:10.280]  web at www.ecolovle.com today at acolablue.com.
[2:08:10.280 --> 2:08:23.080]  All right, for the full hour, Bob Chapman of theinternationalforecaster.com worked in
[2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:27.520]  intelligence in Europe, in Berlin and that key frontline officer in the Cold War and
[2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:30.920]  also in South Africa, France and other nations.
[2:08:30.920 --> 2:08:35.440]  So he's particularly skilled to talk about these intelligence matters with us.
[2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:40.400]  Wayne Madsen worked for the Naval Reconnaissance Office, the NSA, he's written for some of
[2:08:40.400 --> 2:08:44.800]  the largest publications in the country and he's been all over international and national
[2:08:44.800 --> 2:08:46.600]  television many times.
[2:08:46.600 --> 2:08:52.200]  We have him on more and more now because he just keeps breaking huge stories and just
[2:08:52.200 --> 2:08:55.880]  while my guys were with him for a day and a half in D.C., they were witnessing him at
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:09:01.080]  the press club hearing huge breaking news that we didn't even talk about that then broke
[2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:02.760]  weeks later in the news.
[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:06.840]  So it's just he ought to move to D.C. but I couldn't stand being there and actually
[2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:10.920]  be around all these reporters because they all know about this but none of them have
[2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:13.280]  the courage he has to come out and talk about it.
[2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:15.880]  That's what blew away my camera guys and my producer that went.
[2:09:15.880 --> 2:09:19.920]  They said there were all these famous reporters and old men and big newspaper reporters going,
[2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:23.200]  it's new world order, it's global government, we're being robbed by foreign banks, yeah
[2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:27.240]  they staged the attacks, everybody knows but we're scared.
[2:09:27.240 --> 2:09:31.440]  This is incredible so Bob Chapman's with us and Wayne Madsen, Wayne just for this segment
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:35.800]  because he's got to go on a meeting, Wayne, I saw you on international television, I also
[2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:38.120]  saw a story at WayneMadsenReport.com.
[2:09:38.120 --> 2:09:45.000]  We've got it linked up on infowars.com right now where there's an NSA intelligence unit
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:51.680]  called the Q group briefly tell us exactly what's going on with it, why it was set up,
[2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:56.880]  who it's targeting and then I want to back up what you've been talking about.
[2:09:56.880 --> 2:10:02.160]  We have the Violent Radicalization Act hearings in Congress where they show architects and
[2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:08.840]  engineers for 9-11 Truth, almost a thousand members now, all these physicists peer reviewed
[2:10:08.840 --> 2:10:16.360]  journals, international television, thermites been found, separate universities, they blew
[2:10:16.360 --> 2:10:21.840]  the buildings up, they're really getting desperate and you're saying this Q group is out to persecute
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:32.320]  government whistleblowers specifically, I guess like a person like yourself or others,
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:36.800]  tell us about what's happening, I mean is this going after Sybil Edmonds, is this like
[2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:43.280]  going after the Army colonels that exposed the FBI and the CIA were blocking the able
[2:10:43.280 --> 2:10:47.400]  danger investigation, tell us what's going on with this Q group then we'll get Bob Chapman's
[2:10:47.400 --> 2:10:48.400]  take on it.
[2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:54.120]  Well Alex, what Q group is, it's the NSA Personnel Security Office, it's always existed, you
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:59.200]  know, it's the group that does background investigations, gives people the clearances
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:07.280]  to work there, does periodic updates of their security clearances, but since 9-11 what
[2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:13.480]  this group has turned into, it's turned into a secretive intelligence gathering agency
[2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:16.560]  within a secret intelligence gathering agency.
[2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:23.240]  What they're doing now is going after anyone within the National Security Agency, NSA,
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:30.560]  which is employees and government contractors who in any way, shape or form, are seen as
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:37.520]  potential whistleblowers, may have been to a meeting they didn't agree with, it's like
[2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:44.680]  a shdadi force and it's really causing a lot of people to lose their clearances, to lose
[2:11:44.680 --> 2:11:49.520]  their jobs, to also blacklist these people to make sure they don't even get a job in
[2:11:49.520 --> 2:11:54.320]  another agency that requires the security clearance, so that's essentially, it's about
[2:11:54.320 --> 2:12:01.360]  a thousand informants and employees and agents, they work closely with FBI counterintelligence
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:06.680]  out of the Washington D.C. field office and out of Baltimore field office, and this is
[2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:14.040]  exactly what this group is doing, and recently they've really been going after people who
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:23.680]  may have had some knowledge because they worked in NSA on 9-11 and obviously they don't want
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:28.560]  any of that information to come out, and they also I might add are conducting surveillance
[2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:34.400]  of journalists who write about NSA, there's at least eight I heard of in the last couple
[2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:39.160]  of weeks, unfortunately I'm one of them, or fortunately whatever you're looking at
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:46.400]  it, but they have photographs, dossiers, and what I'm called a telephone transcripts
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:52.280]  and email transcripts of conversations between an email between journalists and people who
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:57.320]  either worked in NSA or still work at the agency.
[2:12:57.320 --> 2:13:03.480]  Wayne, continue, give us specifics if you can without revealing your source about these
[2:13:03.480 --> 2:13:04.480]  documents you saw.
[2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:11.200]  Well, the documents I saw had to do with a database called First Proofs, it's a joint
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:21.200]  NSA CIA operation under the dial and deception committee, but it used to be basically an
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:27.160]  online clipping service, anytime there was an article about NSA it would wind up in this
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:32.480]  database, but it's expanded now to include journalists and who they're talking to, so
[2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:39.200]  it contains information derived from wiretaps, whether they're legal or not, probably most
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:44.360]  of them are under stellar wind and are illegal, and against the Fourth Amendment, against
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:51.760]  the foreign intelligence prevails back, but I've seen those documents, I've also seen
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:52.760]  that.
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:13:56.360]  By the way, it's not just, let me stop you, it's not just you saying this, Wayne Madsen,
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:02.200]  much of this has come out, they're spying on congresswomen, congressmen, governors, journalists,
[2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:07.440]  this is all admitted, we live in a stasi state and they probably like what you're doing,
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:12.200]  they like everybody knowing we live in East Germany, this is disgusting.
[2:14:12.200 --> 2:14:19.600]  Absolutely, and as I say, I've also seen documents that show even though my room was
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:27.520]  redacted it was clear that I was under investigation by the Q group for talking to certain individuals
[2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:33.200]  within NSA, I've seen those documents as well, I've flared those documents, they told me
[2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:38.040]  I have to wait in line behind everybody else, even I've asked for expedited processing
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:43.560]  as a journalist, at first they said they would give me expedited processing for the
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:46.040]  FOIA and then they turned around and said we're not going to do it.
[2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:50.080]  Well I've done the FOIAs and they just say hire a lawyer, national security, we're not
[2:14:50.080 --> 2:14:55.240]  giving you your FBI file, CIA, NSA, Alex Jones, go fly a kite.
[2:14:55.240 --> 2:15:01.720]  Right, basically I got the same message from them, but the most egregious example was what
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:08.560]  they did to Ken Ford who worked in the Iraq signal intelligence shop in March of 03, this
[2:15:08.560 --> 2:15:16.640]  is the month we attacked, Bush attacked Iraq, Ken Ford had been a uniform secret service
[2:15:16.640 --> 2:15:20.960]  agent who guarded President Clinton at the White House, he transferred to NSA to get
[2:15:20.960 --> 2:15:27.920]  him into a new career pattern, he was tasked with looking at signals and intercepts of
[2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:33.280]  Iraqi government communications to find evidence of weapons and mass destruction, he found
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:38.680]  no evidence, he made a report with his name on it, it winds up on Big Cheney's desk,
[2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:42.800]  he stung in an operation where they accused him of stealing classified information out
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:48.520]  of NSA during the middle of the day, absolutely impossible to do with the security there,
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:57.320]  they basically invited him and he was convicted by a dirty judge at a taint-a-jury pool and
[2:15:57.320 --> 2:16:05.520]  a couple of dirty federal prosecutors, he's sitting now in Pennsylvania, in a federal
[2:16:05.520 --> 2:16:10.000]  prison in Pennsylvania, and he got seven years at a judge.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:15.600]  Well, let me ask you this question, we know they also went for Sybil Edmonds and others
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:20.440]  and they admit they have army intelligence spying on peace groups, in the Fed groups,
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:25.240]  tea parties, you go to a tea party, there's just feds everywhere with cameras, DHS reports
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:30.360]  demonizing liberals, conservatives, they don't care, I mean this really is a great
[2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:36.080]  a thug criminal government and I interrupted you earlier and I want to go to Bob Chapman
[2:16:36.080 --> 2:16:41.240]  here in a moment, you were getting into some more of these documents you've seen and how
[2:16:41.240 --> 2:16:45.960]  they work with local police, all I hear is local radio ads to recruit for the CIA, they
[2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:50.400]  admit they're setting up local offices, doesn't even matter if that's illegal, I mean are
[2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:55.240]  these guys just going to openly turn us into Nazi Germany?
[2:16:55.240 --> 2:17:00.760]  Well, I think they already basically have done the rudimentary, we're turning us into
[2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:06.120]  that kind of society, I mean it was clear what they did to Ken Ford sitting seven years
[2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:11.960]  in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary in Pennsylvania, they made an example of him for others but
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:17.680]  I know people who have been fired, lost their clearances, I witnessed surveillance myself
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:23.960]  just a couple of weeks ago by people who worked with this Q-group at NSA when I was meeting
[2:17:23.960 --> 2:17:28.760]  a person who used to work there, so it's real, I've seen it, I've seen it in the
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:36.880]  police, I've actually also witnessed the surveillance. Man, America's now like downtown
[2:17:36.880 --> 2:17:43.080]  Havana, I just can't, and of course suddenly it's not about fighting Al Qaeda, suddenly
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:48.840]  it's all about the American people and the government see persecuting itself, this is
[2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:54.240]  a purge is what's happening, this is an intimidation, Bob Chapman your view on what Wayne Madsen's
[2:17:54.240 --> 2:18:03.680]  breaking down here? In one word it's terrifying and I guess all of us who have been reporting
[2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:10.720]  into this and also experienced counterintelligence and work for the government, we never expected
[2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:15.680]  them to really come out and be open the way they have but they are, just like Wayne just
[2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:20.280]  said, it's on, it's here, it's now, they're doing it and they really don't care who knows
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:26.360]  it. In fact, they want people to know, the times I've had the military in a parking lot
[2:18:26.360 --> 2:18:29.800]  block me in and threaten me, they just go, we want you to know we're watching and we're
[2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:34.240]  here, and I guess they're proud to kill this country, I mean I guess they think it's good
[2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:41.880]  they blew up those towers. Could very well be. Well we're going to let Wayne go here
[2:18:41.880 --> 2:18:47.440]  in a moment but Wayne, are they that scared of 9-11 truth, I mean I guess this is really
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:52.200]  good news overall that they're that scared of 9-11 truth.
[2:18:52.200 --> 2:18:57.240]  Well I think this is the big one, I mean it was clear they wanted to suppress anybody
[2:18:57.240 --> 2:19:03.640]  who had information about the lack of WMDs in Iraq, some people were targeted because
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:12.240]  of that but I think that the big, the 500 pound gorilla now is information about 9-11,
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:17.680]  people who were on duty that know that, that I've just reported that two aircraft were
[2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:24.680]  shot down over Shanksville on 9-11, one being United 93 and the other one being a Global
[2:19:24.680 --> 2:19:29.680]  Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle, it's amazing no one has been up to Shanksville really to
[2:19:29.680 --> 2:19:35.040]  ask the witnesses what they saw. Now the FBI has been up there to brow BTC but I know from
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:43.400]  NSA sources that the Air Force intercepted an aircraft on that day and shot it down.
[2:19:43.400 --> 2:19:47.040]  Wayne hold on and Bob let's do one more second with Wayne to the bottom of the air then we'll
[2:19:47.040 --> 2:19:51.720]  have Chapman with us on the economy, this is just blowing me away and folks I've been
[2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:57.680]  in the parking lot had him block me in and had him get in my face, I mean this is real,
[2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:01.880]  this country's gone to hell.
[2:20:01.880 --> 2:20:05.520]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using

[2:21:09.040 --> 2:21:15.080]  powerful world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world
[2:21:15.080 --> 2:21:21.240]  domination? For thousands of years their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of
[2:21:21.240 --> 2:21:30.360]  the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first

[2:22:00.040 --> 2:22:06.140]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question. What would
[2:22:06.140 --> 2:22:10.720]  you list as the things that the federal government does really well? The armed forces and printing
[2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:15.400]  bogus money doesn't count. Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have
[2:22:15.400 --> 2:22:20.440]  to protect your assets and escape the paper markets. The only real option is precious
[2:22:20.440 --> 2:22:25.880]  metals for your retirement, your kids' education or just plain survival when the whole Obama
[2:22:25.880 --> 2:22:31.200]  mess comes crashing down. You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package
[2:22:31.200 --> 2:22:34.760]  and I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your
[2:22:34.760 --> 2:22:44.720]  family. Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128, that's 800-686-2237, extension
[2:22:44.720 --> 2:22:50.040]  128 and together we can develop a make sense program before the clock runs out. Once more
[2:22:50.040 --> 2:23:00.760]  John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128 and take charge of your future and thank you.
[2:23:00.760 --> 2:23:05.120]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and
[2:23:05.120 --> 2:23:10.000]  China have now penetrated our power grid, even as energy experts are reporting that each
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:14.400]  summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid. Some say that
[2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:19.360]  this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating
[2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:25.000]  a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark. Are you prepared
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:29.600]  for the next round of storm related outages or government created blackouts? Have you
[2:23:29.600 --> 2:23:34.640]  ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply
[2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:40.080]  of electrical power? If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[2:23:40.080 --> 2:23:45.000]  Solar powered generators are finally available. They have no moving parts to wear out or break
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:50.920]  and require absolutely no gas whatsoever. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:58.160]  so go to mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Check out mysolarbackup.com. It is a great
[2:23:58.160 --> 2:24:04.160]  system to use your power. Federal agents, we are armed!
[2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:11.800]  Look, I didn't know what I was getting into 14 years ago. I knew it was bad, but you know
[2:24:11.800 --> 2:24:17.680]  what? I'm glad I got into it now that I know just how bad it is. I got the video, Congress
[2:24:17.680 --> 2:24:21.360]  hearings where they admit Dinecore kidnaps, children in mass, and nothing's done to them.
[2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:24.600]  I mean, it's just total criminal. We're going to let Wayne go in two minutes. He's got to
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:28.840]  go into a meeting in the rest of the hour with Bob Chapman. Very important economic news.
[2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:35.080]  But finishing up, Wayne, drop this bombshell on us about Shanksville, and that's the intel
[2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:39.680]  we were already getting from the Happy Hooligans and others of the years. Drop that bombshell
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:46.320]  on us, and then briefly wash them post $250,000 to, I guess, get the news reported like you
[2:24:46.320 --> 2:24:49.840]  want and to get to have a secret meeting with a White House official.
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:55.960]  Well, Shanksville, I spoke to the witness who was closest to where that hurt was made
[2:24:55.960 --> 2:25:01.720]  in the ground that could have not been made by a Boeing 757. I've just arrived yesterday
[2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:07.800]  at Los Angeles Airport on a Boeing 757, and that point would not cause a small hole like
[2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:12.200]  that. What that was, according to the description I received from the witness, was something
[2:25:12.200 --> 2:25:19.640]  that looked amazingly matched the description of a Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.
[2:25:19.640 --> 2:25:30.400]  There was no noise, was solid white, no rivets, tubular, had various fins on it, and that's
[2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:35.200]  what declared some treating and thrashing in the ground. Now, we were told that was
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:41.440]  the impact point of Flight 93, which it wasn't. So the question is, there were two F-16s
[2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:47.280]  over the area at the time. I know from NSA sources that they said they were engaging
[2:25:47.280 --> 2:25:52.800]  a target. Cheney was informed that the Air Force shot down an aircraft over Pennsylvania
[2:25:52.800 --> 2:25:58.440]  that was sent to him by the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Jumper. And so there's
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:03.760]  plenty of evidence in the intelligence community that much more happened over Pennsylvania.
[2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:08.680]  Actually, I referred to it as a dog fight. It was a dog fight over Shanksville that morning.
[2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:19.160]  Well, what about a commercial plane? Yeah, I mean, we also have, I mean, just so many
[2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:24.120]  witnesses to all these different explosions and things happening in the air. And we have
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:29.120]  Cheney and Rumsfeld over and over again saying the missile that hit the Pentagon when we shot
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:33.240]  down the Shanksville plane. Do they do that in case it ever comes out? They go, oh, see,
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:37.480]  I told you. I mean, is that why on national TV, the owner of the World Trade Center said,
[2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:41.880]  God, blew it up? Well, right. I think, I think if they, you know, I long enough kind of
[2:26:41.880 --> 2:26:46.960]  split up eventually and actually, you might actually point to telling the truth. Okay.
[2:26:46.960 --> 2:26:52.840]  In closing, what, what about the Washington Post, which now openly is a giant payoff machine?
[2:26:52.840 --> 2:26:59.400]  Unbelievable, offering people access to the reporters, their pictures, their editor and
[2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:06.360]  members of the Obama administration for healthcare salon at the publisher's private home. One
[2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:13.160]  of the, one of the fees was $250,000. I think the Washington Post has always been a dubious
[2:27:13.160 --> 2:27:17.760]  newspaper, but I'd say they just driven the last nail in the road. I mean, openly it's
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:23.120]  a quarter mill to get what you want from those people. Wayne Madsen, we'll talk to you soon.
[2:27:23.120 --> 2:27:28.120]  I really appreciate you coming on WayneMadsenReport.com. You bet. Just amazing. And I apologize
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:32.600]  to Bob for having him on the first 20 minutes, but Bob, this stuff just keeps breaking. Give
[2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:39.120]  us your take on what you've just heard. Of course, you know about the Washington Post.
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:44.920]  You know, it's, it's right in our face and we just got to keep on hammering away at the
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:52.720]  truth on your program and in the forecaster and, and all the other people who are doing
[2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:57.520]  the kind of thing that we are. We've got to let the world know what's going on. If we
[2:27:57.520 --> 2:28:01.840]  can expose what they're doing and the, and the people can understand and they'll believe
[2:28:01.840 --> 2:28:07.760]  what we say and now they're open-minded about these sort of things more than they have been
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:14.440]  before. We can get a groundswell growing and, and when they go to harass some, someone,
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:20.840]  you know, 50 or 100 people show up, then the government's going to start backing off because
[2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:28.160]  the only thing that can come after a confrontation like that is, is a more aggressive power.
[2:28:28.160 --> 2:28:33.320]  And that's going to put the government in a very compromised position. So the best thing
[2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:38.200]  we can do is do what we're doing and keep on doing it. And my hat, of course, like I'm
[2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:44.920]  sure yours is, is off to Wayne Madsen. He does beautiful work. Everything that he publishes,
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:51.960]  I get my hands on, I use as a link in my publication. You know that separately. Remember Jesse Ventura
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:57.040]  when he told MPR and then they called the CIA and they confirmed it. He shows up the
[2:28:57.040 --> 2:29:00.280]  first week at work. They say, hey, they want to meet you in the basement. He goes, who?
[2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:08.200]  And they go, go down there. And there's 23 CIA officers basically asking him questions,
[2:29:08.200 --> 2:29:14.040]  but not answering his questions. And he said, you're not supposed to be operating here,
[2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:19.760]  but they are. And now they're openly operating spooks and spies running around. It's not
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:24.100]  enough. They ship in the drugs for our kids. It's not enough. They steal all the money
[2:29:24.100 --> 2:29:30.760]  with the banks. Now they're hiring all these bankers to swindle. I mean, it's just my,
[2:29:30.760 --> 2:29:37.320]  they are, it's so corrupt. I can't even believe it, Bob. I can't either. I shake my head and
[2:29:37.320 --> 2:29:44.320]  I say to my wife, I've never seen anything like this. These people just don't care.
[2:29:44.320 --> 2:29:47.400]  America is completely run by criminals. Anyway, you slice it, dice it. We're going to the
[2:29:47.400 --> 2:29:53.960]  economy. The Bob coming up. We're on the march. The empire's on the
[2:29:53.960 --> 2:30:03.080]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones. Have you heard of the

[2:31:03.400 --> 2:31:08.320]  you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation
[2:31:08.320 --> 2:31:12.680]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants
[2:31:12.680 --> 2:31:17.640]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[2:31:17.640 --> 2:31:22.420]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[2:31:22.420 --> 2:31:26.360]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with
[2:31:26.360 --> 2:31:30.320]  the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm
[2:31:30.320 --> 2:31:34.160]  season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather
[2:31:34.160 --> 2:31:38.960]  related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[2:31:38.960 --> 2:31:42.760]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[2:34:47.720 --> 2:34:54.200]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book or, you know, from Alice in Wonderland.
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:34:58.640]  Our sponsor, Colablu, with the Colablu 28 machine will allow you to do just that. It's

[2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:46.080]  you got interrupted there by Madsen, but you know that's important. Just been 5, 10 minutes
[2:35:46.080 --> 2:35:56.040]  or so on the economy. Worse than thought, jobless numbers, people defaulting on credit card,
[2:35:56.040 --> 2:36:02.960]  debt, home, debt, and then now the carbon tax passes the house. All of this craziness
[2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:12.440]  is happening. I mean, you're an economic whiz kid on this stuff. What are we facing?
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:22.040]  Well, the debt picture continues to, continue to rise each day, whether it's personal, corporate,
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:28.000]  or governmental. And those figures we have twice a week in the international forecasters,
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:35.560]  you know. And there's no let up in sight. A good point is that a savings is now up to
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:42.600]  a 6.9% level, whereas a year and a half to two years ago there's a minus 1.5 or 1%. That's
[2:36:42.600 --> 2:36:48.560]  good, but government wants, and Wall Street and banking want, people to spend and get
[2:36:48.560 --> 2:36:54.120]  themselves deeper in the debt to keep the economy floating. And so, you know, you can't
[2:36:54.120 --> 2:37:01.400]  have it both ways. Unemployment, like John Williams, who comes in at 20.6%, I come in
[2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:09.800]  at 20.5%. Official government figure for U6, and that's what we're using, is 16.5%. If
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:14.640]  you add in the birth, death ratio, and that's something the government put in there in order
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:23.440]  to say that they couldn't pull small and medium sized businesses, and so they get that. And
[2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:30.040]  so these guesses aggregate about 185,000 jobs a month that government creates out of thin
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:40.120]  air. So if you add that to the 16.5 official U6, then you've got 20.5% or 20.6%. And that's
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:44.440]  what unemployment really is, and it's going to continue to get worse, not as quickly as
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:50.400]  it had previously for about the next year and a quarter, maybe a year and a half, it'll
[2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:56.120]  probably go up into the 22, 25% area. And then after that, it's going to expedite to
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:38:02.280]  the upside again. Now, there's an event that just happened on Wall Street, extraordinarily
[2:38:02.280 --> 2:38:10.880]  important. The FBI, at the behest of Goldman Sachs, swooped in and grabbed a fellow as he
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:17.560]  got off a plane. His name is Sergey, something or other. He is a Russian name. And they
[2:38:17.560 --> 2:38:23.800]  grabbed him because he went to work for another firm, which was a competitor. And Goldman
[2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:31.800]  Sachs said that they stole, he stole, a coded program. But what they didn't tell, and in
[2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:33.200]  the process of doing that...
[2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:37.600]  Yeah, I saw that in the news, and I'm getting a lot of calls about it. Explain what this
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:42.440]  program does, because it allows people to completely rig the market, doesn't it?
[2:38:42.440 --> 2:38:43.440]  Yes.
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:45.320]  Okay, explain that, explain that.
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:50.240]  Let me tell you where they got it. They got it from the United States government. And
[2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:54.560]  they are the only ones that got it. And the government tells Goldman, or Goldman tells
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:39:01.480]  government, this is what we're going to do to rig the markets. And so with that, Goldman,
[2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:05.520]  for the past six months, has been making a fortune because they're front running the
[2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:09.840]  trades and they're getting in front of the government, and the government allows them
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:10.840]  to do that.
[2:39:10.840 --> 2:39:14.680]  And that's why they've reported record profits for those who don't know. Go ahead.
[2:39:14.680 --> 2:39:20.120]  That's right. And so, you know, the rest of the streets saying, my goodness gracious,
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:24.880]  I mean, how did they do this? And they figured it out. And so there's another program, too,
[2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:29.840]  and I'm going to shove this in from the side, which a New York Stock Exchange has, in which
[2:39:29.840 --> 2:39:36.080]  it pays market makers to go in and take the other side of a trade, in other words, to
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:40.640]  opportune the market. And they pay them to do that, which is the most ludicrous thing
[2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:45.400]  I've ever heard. And they've been doing it for about a year and a half. But anyway, getting
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:55.080]  back to Goldman, Goldman admits, and they said this themselves, that this formula, these
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:40:01.000]  algorithms, and these things that we're using allow you to rig the market. I mean, what
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:05.480]  boob is this? I couldn't believe it. So anyway,
[2:40:05.480 --> 2:40:09.520]  Explain how that works, though, because I mean, this has even hit some mainstream news
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:13.920]  now that somehow in between trades,
[2:40:13.920 --> 2:40:22.400]  Yes, they take the difference in between trades. It's a timing mechanism, and it's a sensitive
[2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:29.720]  mechanism, which allows you to pick up a penny here, a quarter of a penny there, a penny
[2:40:29.720 --> 2:40:34.760]  and a half here. Well, by the end of the day, you might have $8 billion, you know. And so
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:36.200]  that's what they've been doing.
[2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:37.200]  Unbelievable.
[2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:43.720]  And they've been screwing, and plain English, all the other market makers, they've taken
[2:40:43.720 --> 2:40:51.720]  over, over 50% of the black box business, which is, that is done mathematically. And
[2:40:51.720 --> 2:40:54.200]  they're just screwing the hell out of the American public.
[2:40:54.200 --> 2:40:58.960]  So it's all about monopolies. And again, when did this start? Because it seems the
[2:40:58.960 --> 2:41:04.360]  last two years or so, government worldwide just said break all laws, rape everyone,
[2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:10.640]  do it, but also global corporations now stores. I was in years ago that were nice, the carpets
[2:41:10.640 --> 2:41:16.960]  falling apart, the walls, the pain, the upholstery. It's like corporate America has decided everything
[2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:21.600]  rot like it's not going to be here. And all these rich people I know through lawyers and
[2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:25.440]  other people, a lot of folks live here and Austin, they're wealthy, are leaving the country
[2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:30.880]  saying get out, America won't be here. I mean, are they just going to suck it all dry and
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:34.520]  then just send out Marines to machine gun anybody that doesn't like it? I mean, are
[2:41:34.520 --> 2:41:37.960]  they just going to throttle the hell out of us like, like we're Ukraine or something
[2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:42.480]  and Stalin's getting his jollies? I mean, is there any end of these bastards rigging
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:47.360]  and stealing and everything they, I mean, is there, I mean, I mean, they're ruining
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:53.320]  even if they're criminals, Bob, they have in mind. Exactly. But even if they're criminals,
[2:41:53.320 --> 2:42:00.600]  aren't they wrecking everything? I'm sorry, go ahead. I said, we have to hope the military
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:06.800]  will bark that they won't go through with it. And there'll always be some who will,
[2:42:06.800 --> 2:42:12.040]  those morons who meet you in your parking lot, like the morons that come in and beat
[2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:16.840]  you up and stuff like that. I mean, the same morons who have been threatening threatening
[2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:23.200]  me since 1967, they're going to, they're going to be there. They're not going to go away.
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:27.560]  But the majority of people in the military and the law enforcement are decent people.
[2:42:27.560 --> 2:42:32.360]  And the question is, are they going to stand up for the American citizens, their fellow
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:38.400]  friends, the people they live with? Are they going to go around jackbooted and goose stepping
[2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:44.120]  to what the people who control our government want them to do? And that's what it's going
[2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:45.680]  to come down to.
[2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:52.040]  Well, the reason I started ranting about it, they just going wild because you're an expert
[2:42:52.040 --> 2:42:58.520]  in the market. So explain this to me. If they're able to rig things and it starts cheating
[2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:03.560]  everybody else, that will, when it finally comes out, destroy confidence. But I guess
[2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:07.160]  they don't even care when that happens because they're the regulators. They'll just put more
[2:43:07.160 --> 2:43:12.200]  regulations allowing them to steal and they don't care. They want to implode everything.
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:17.800]  Everything they're doing is to destroy confidence, bring things down. The global carbon taxes,
[2:43:17.800 --> 2:43:23.520]  the shutdown industry, paying tax incentives for 20 years to move corporations and factories
[2:43:23.520 --> 2:43:30.360]  offshore. I mean, they are really trying to screw everything up. They really are bastards.
[2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:35.640]  And the answer, if you have wealth of any kind, you want to be in gold and silver coins.
[2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:41.360]  And if you get piles of money and there are listeners that do, you can also buy gold and
[2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:48.160]  silver shares along with that. And that is your only salvation. There is no other except
[2:43:48.160 --> 2:43:54.120]  the rudiments, which is food, a filter and weapons with plenty of clips and ammo.
[2:43:54.120 --> 2:43:58.360]  I just can't believe it. I mean, Bob, when you call these people idiots, I know why you're
[2:43:58.360 --> 2:44:02.880]  saying that, but I mean, tell me if I'm wrong or elaborate. These thugs that are on power
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:06.920]  trips that are into how they're macho and into how they're secret agents and get to
[2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:12.640]  carry out all this activity with our new domestic spy force. Overnight going from we found Al
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:16.680]  Qaeda to we fight gun owners and veterans and people that don't like to fed. I mean, they've
[2:44:16.680 --> 2:44:26.000]  openly announced it. These guys, I don't think they realize that they're going to be set
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:30.640]  up in the end too. That they're the first group when the globalists win that are going
[2:44:30.640 --> 2:44:34.480]  to get set up and put in prison or bare minimum lose their jobs. A lot of them are going
[2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:41.080]  to get killed. I mean, I don't understand evil because once you get into it, it creates
[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:45.680]  a climate that destroys everything and then nobody's safe. And don't these dumb yuppies
[2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:50.600]  realize that corruption isn't cute? That once the constitution bill of rights is gone, all
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:56.400]  the the sharks and wolves get to come in and have their way with us, Bob. They haven't
[2:44:56.400 --> 2:45:00.880]  thought that far ahead and many of them are incapable of doing so. But I want to tell
[2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:07.480]  you something. I do a program once a week and have for some years, which is all military
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:14.880]  for the most part state department and mostly retired and active military. And I got a letter
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:20.480]  yesterday, which isn't tomorrow's issue coming out into the U.S. section. And it's from a
[2:45:20.480 --> 2:45:25.120]  Marine. He says there's 25 of us here in New York City who are out of the Corps, but some
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:30.960]  of us are still active and you know, we're listening to, you know, everything that you
[2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:38.760]  put on and trying to help us and stuff like that. But they know what's going on. My newsletter,
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:46.880]  as far as I know, is the most pirated newsletter in the world. It's all over Washington. It's
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:52.600]  all over the state department. I don't know who is doing that and how they're they getting
[2:45:52.600 --> 2:45:57.320]  it. No, no, it's listen, Bob, Bob, it's the radio shows, this show and hundreds of other
[2:45:57.320 --> 2:46:02.120]  shows you do our books, our films, our DVDs, your newsletter. No, it's everywhere. They're
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:07.400]  needed deep in it. So I guess in a way we should celebrate that the NSA's got goons
[2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:12.440]  out harassing and arresting and setting people up in 9 11 truth because that means they're
[2:46:12.440 --> 2:46:18.200]  scared to death of us. That's right. And we got to keep on doing what we're doing. And
[2:46:18.200 --> 2:46:22.360]  you got to keep on supporting us out there and putting the word out that everybody in
[2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:27.480]  the country should be listening to Alex and everybody should be listening to the forecast.
[2:46:27.480 --> 2:46:33.760]  I mean, we got the forecaster in Iraq and Afghanistan and the high ranks of the military
[2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:37.640]  are going eight trying to find out how it's getting there. And by the way, that's not
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:44.080]  just you saying this when they ordered Fox failing to attack Iran. He said no one resigned.
[2:46:44.080 --> 2:46:50.360]  So I mean, it's really happening. We're going to, we're going to win. It's just going to
[2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:54.800]  be very painful. And if these people think that smart telling us what they're doing,
[2:46:54.800 --> 2:47:00.240]  that's okay. We don't care. We know what they're doing. We've known for a long time. It just
[2:47:00.240 --> 2:47:04.320]  took a lot of people a long time to catch on. And the only reason most of them caught
[2:47:04.320 --> 2:47:10.640]  on is because of Alex Jones and people like you with your wonderful programs. So everybody
[2:47:10.640 --> 2:47:15.600]  support the sponsors, put the word out, make sure everybody that you know, listens to this
[2:47:15.600 --> 2:47:16.600]  program.
[2:47:16.600 --> 2:47:20.440]  Bob, I want to come back in the segment and then, and then five minutes in the next hour
[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:26.280]  when we got Webster Tarpley, uh, economists coming on to talk more about all these issues.
[2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:30.520]  But speaking of sponsors, I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson of them. We'll come back
[2:47:30.520 --> 2:47:34.280]  to Dan, Chris, Derek, Mike and a few others for Bob Chapman, the international forecaster
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:38.960]  dot com, my sites info wars.com and prison planet dot TV. Just for two minutes for you
[2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:44.040]  to break. I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up. I've had him on about three weeks and I always
[2:47:44.040 --> 2:47:48.120]  try to tell people buy gold when it's down. They don't listen. They only buy when it's
[2:47:48.120 --> 2:47:53.240]  high. But right now, Ted's bought it when it's low and he'll sell it to you even as
[2:47:53.240 --> 2:47:57.760]  it's starting to go up a little bit today. But regardless, ladies and gentlemen with
[2:47:57.760 --> 2:48:02.060]  the banks and the new stimulus package, let's talk about that in the next segment and trillions
[2:48:02.060 --> 2:48:06.440]  more for foreign banks and to get the federal reserve and limited power. Now is the time
[2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:10.120]  to get into silver and gold. And I wanted Ted to give the listeners and this runs throughout
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:14.920]  Sunday. These specials end Sunday evening. Ted was telling me on silver and gold, the
[2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:19.560]  best prices you're going to find out there bar none. Ted Anderson, tell folks about
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:23.440]  the Friday specials that run through Sunday and be happy to and anybody with a half a
[2:48:23.440 --> 2:48:26.880]  brain in their head knows that they'd have to get away from this fiat currency we have
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:33.600]  here in our nation. But right now I have the Lakota's at $18 and 17 cents. I mean, that
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:40.040]  is close to the lowest price I've ever been able to offer those coins for. And I can't
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:44.880]  say enough for them. It's a great buy. Then I also have the Franks currently right now
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:50.680]  at $216 last time I've been able to offer them. It was $222. So that gives you a little
[2:48:50.680 --> 2:48:56.600]  bit of an idea where they're at right now. British sovereigns right now $266 last time
[2:48:56.600 --> 2:49:02.360]  I offered those $271. So, you know, it gives you just right now at this particular time,
[2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:07.080]  I'm buying because I've been doing this for 30 years. I watch what's going on. The prices
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:11.720]  are low right now. But then you take a look at what they're doing to this nation and just
[2:49:11.720 --> 2:49:18.800]  consider the fact that this is all being financed by a printing press through a fiat paper system.
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:24.480]  You know darn well that the United States dollars doomed. And so I really suggest if
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:30.720]  anybody has been sitting on the fence thinking about precious metals, now is the time to
[2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:31.720]  do it.
[2:49:31.720 --> 2:49:36.120]  And by the way, here's the LA Times today dollars futures reserve currency and focus
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:40.800]  as world leaders meet. And then I have Reuters here where they've unveiled the new world
[2:49:40.800 --> 2:49:47.240]  currency coin at G8. But this isn't in US news. It's in the foreign news. You would
[2:49:47.240 --> 2:49:49.560]  think this would be news, Ted.
[2:49:49.560 --> 2:49:53.240]  You sure would think so. And just yesterday there was a huge article about gold in the
[2:49:53.240 --> 2:49:59.760]  Wall Street Journal. You know, there's a people need to pay attention to what's going on.
[2:49:59.760 --> 2:50:04.480]  This is a wonderful opportunity to get into the gold and silver prices at a corrected
[2:50:04.480 --> 2:50:11.720]  level. You know, we are close to August now, September, October. Historically gold is always
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:16.280]  up during those months. Now is the time to be getting in. There's no question about it.
[2:50:16.280 --> 2:50:23.240]  And like I said, I don't, I, you know, I think $17.71 was the very lowest price I could
[2:50:23.240 --> 2:50:29.320]  ever offer Lakota for. And right now I have them at 1817, which is, you know, just a fraction
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:30.320]  away from that.
[2:50:30.320 --> 2:50:33.800]  And you've also got great deals on gold. The brokers will be there until midnight tonight
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:36.360]  and then off and on. You can call them. They'll call you back. A lot of them are gonna be
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:42.000]  there on the weekend right through to Sunday evening. Don't wait. 1-800-686-2237. Here's

[2:50:52.960 --> 2:50:57.800]  One more time, 800-686-2237. Thanks, Ted.
[2:50:57.800 --> 2:50:58.800]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:01.400]  All right, Bob, stay there. Call straight ahead.

[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:07.960]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:52:07.960 --> 2:52:12.520]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:13.800]  us would like to see.
[2:52:13.800 --> 2:52:18.960]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:52:18.960 --> 2:52:20.320]  of the American people.
[2:52:20.320 --> 2:52:24.720]  Well Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:52:24.720 --> 2:52:29.800]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:52:29.800 --> 2:52:37.920]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:52:37.920 --> 2:52:42.640]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents
[2:52:42.640 --> 2:52:49.280]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the

[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:26.080]  chemicals? Of course you can't. The air that you breathe and the water you drink should
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:29.120]  help maintain good health, not take away from it.

[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:41.640]  Webster Tarble is coming up in 20 after. I said I'd go through the global warming propaganda
[2:54:41.640 --> 2:54:45.760]  and just show you what's in the magazines and newspapers, the level of brainwashing.
[2:54:45.760 --> 2:54:50.520]  That's coming up right now in this segment. The next, let's take your phone calls for
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:56.920]  Bob Chapman. Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Texas. You're on the air. Dan, thanks
[2:54:56.920 --> 2:54:57.920]  for holding.
[2:54:57.920 --> 2:54:58.920]  Hello.
[2:54:58.920 --> 2:54:59.920]  Yes, sir.
[2:54:59.920 --> 2:55:05.120]  I wanted to ask him about hyperinflation if he really thinks it's going to hit in the
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:06.120]  fall.
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:15.720]  Yes, I do. And I think one of the keys here, and that's going to make it hit, is that the
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:23.600]  banks that have been given money by the Federal Reserve, and it's called loans, have been
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:30.600]  holding them on the balance sheet. And what they've been doing with it is either depositing
[2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:40.800]  at the Fed, or they've been buying Treasury paper with it. And the Treasury paper purchases
[2:55:40.800 --> 2:55:49.480]  as well have been coming from the funds that were received by the banks from the Fed for
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:56:01.240]  the purchase of what they call collateralized debt obligations, which are bonds with mortgages
[2:56:01.240 --> 2:56:03.000]  inside of them.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  Now the Fed has created money out of thin air to do this, and that money becomes monetized
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:18.320]  once the banks use it, not about money from the CDOs being paid for them, but the money
[2:56:18.320 --> 2:56:26.840]  that was lent to them. And I think the economy is not going to be recovering adequately by
[2:56:26.840 --> 2:56:34.400]  the end of the year. And I think that during the fall, that the banks are going to start
[2:56:34.400 --> 2:56:39.960]  using some of that money that's on the balance sheets, and they'll be lending more liberally.
[2:56:39.960 --> 2:56:44.440]  Well, how does the second bailout, Bob, interrupt? How does the second bailout?
[2:56:44.440 --> 2:56:50.000]  That leads to my prediction in January that there would be a second bailout. And I said
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:54.640]  they would start talking about it probably in September. Well, they started a couple
[2:56:54.640 --> 2:57:02.680]  of months before, and the next deal I want to get passed is $2 trillion, not $787 trillion.
[2:57:02.680 --> 2:57:07.840]  Which under fractional reserve, that'll be $20 trillion.
[2:57:07.840 --> 2:57:17.160]  If they want, yes. And that money will be okayed. When, I don't know, it's in the formative
[2:57:17.160 --> 2:57:23.880]  stages. If I had to guess, I'd say September, October, November. And so that money plus
[2:57:23.880 --> 2:57:28.640]  the money the banks already have that's been lent to them, will be probably starting to
[2:57:28.640 --> 2:57:36.720]  go into the economy during the following year. Now, that will begin to start high for inflation.
[2:57:36.720 --> 2:57:42.920]  And the reason they're doing it that way is that next year is an election year. And so
[2:57:42.920 --> 2:57:46.480]  they want the economy to be better, and it will be better.
[2:57:46.480 --> 2:57:51.280]  But also won't all these trillions floating around go into commodities because the currencies
[2:57:51.280 --> 2:57:58.040]  aren't safe. That'll further drive up inflation. Yes. And that's one of the reasons why commodities
[2:57:58.040 --> 2:58:02.520]  have been doing what they've been doing. If you watch oil as an example, an eight out
[2:58:02.520 --> 2:58:08.760]  of 10 days that went down from $70 to $60 a barrel, that's not normal. That's your government
[2:58:08.760 --> 2:58:15.640]  at work. Yeah, that's why we're seeing all this program. They gave to Goldman Sachs.
[2:58:15.640 --> 2:58:20.000]  That's your government at work rigging everything. So you disagree with George Humphrey, America
[2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  or anymore? You disagree with George Humphrey. He says that there may be inflation, hyperinflation,
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:31.600]  but he thinks it's like a long stagnation like Japan with certain certain things going up,
[2:58:31.600 --> 2:58:37.560]  but overall not. Got it. Either way, it's horrible. All right, Bob, stay there. Let's
[2:58:37.560 --> 2:58:44.040]  take a few more phone calls. Hope that answered your question, caller. Thank you for listening

[2:59:54.080 --> 3:00:18.640]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Bob Chapman and I during
[3:00:18.640 --> 3:00:25.840]  breaks talking about nice third world countries to live in. Man to watch our country overrun
[3:00:25.840 --> 3:00:32.240]  by parasites and the republic really is falling. Bob if they pass the second stimulus which
[3:00:32.240 --> 3:00:36.520]  is really letting the federal government give all its power to the private federal reserve
[3:00:36.520 --> 3:00:42.080]  and the global greenhouse tax and the federalization of all the water and the hate speech laws
[3:00:42.080 --> 3:00:47.800]  and they're really trying to pass everything right now and they're getting most of it.
[3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:52.320]  Did you say the republic had fallen if they're able to ram through all of this?
[3:00:52.320 --> 3:00:58.720]  Yes I think you're right. You know they're doing anything they can to do that. The only
[3:00:58.720 --> 3:01:04.680]  thing I saw today that surprised me is two former members of the federal reserve said
[3:01:04.680 --> 3:01:09.480]  no you shouldn't give them all those things to do with all those powers and I was really
[3:01:09.480 --> 3:01:16.280]  surprised at that. These both these men were in mid 80s and I said to my assistant I said
[3:01:16.280 --> 3:01:21.680]  you know these are the guys that have taken from the system, been involved with the Illuminati
[3:01:21.680 --> 3:01:26.600]  all their lives, lived fat and happy and now they're at their end of their days. They know
[3:01:26.600 --> 3:01:31.240]  they can't take it with them and they're telling the truth.
[3:01:31.240 --> 3:01:35.080]  That happens a lot of people that want to keep their soul at the end and finally get
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:36.080]  true wisdom.
[3:01:36.080 --> 3:01:41.240]  I just saw two of them this morning.
[3:01:41.240 --> 3:01:43.440]  Are you saying that's in the news or that's an inside piece?
[3:01:43.440 --> 3:01:50.080]  No it's in the news. It's in the news. One's Taylor and the other is Matlin or I think
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:51.080]  it's in the news.
[3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:56.560]  Well listen, I have Bloomberg a couple months ago with a, in fact we can search this and
[3:01:56.560 --> 3:02:03.640]  get the actual headline. With a current, it was a Dallas fed board member saying New York's
[3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:07.760]  running everything, they've hijacked the country, they've declared the war powers. In fact that
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:16.080]  was the Bloomberg headline, fed chief, fed, New York fed using war powers and so, I mean
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:22.000]  I guess it's so centralized now because it's so criminal that maybe people in the fed that
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:25.880]  aren't involved in the total criminality are hedging their bets, kind of going I'm not
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:28.080]  with them.
[3:02:28.080 --> 3:02:33.320]  I think you're right. I think you're right and I think they are fearful for their families
[3:02:33.320 --> 3:02:38.560]  and I think the line has been drawn and there's a group of us on one side which includes some
[3:02:38.560 --> 3:02:42.320]  of the people who are involved in the evil doing the same look. I didn't think it was
[3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:46.400]  going to get this bad. I don't want any part of it anymore. They're on our side of the
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:52.280]  line and then there's all the other bad guys on the other side and it's going to come to
[3:02:52.280 --> 3:02:59.520]  punch up time and you and I got to be careful what we do because they're going to take
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:04.200]  try to take us out in the meantime.
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:07.520]  Absolutely. Let's jam in another call here. Chris in Tennessee, you're on the air with
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:08.840]  Bob Chapman. Thanks for holding.
[3:03:08.840 --> 3:03:13.640]  Hello Alex. Hello Bob. What I wanted to talk about was Ed and Eileen Brown, the anti-tax
[3:03:13.640 --> 3:03:18.640]  protesters who had just sentenced to 30 years and also the people that helped them. Do you
[3:03:18.640 --> 3:03:24.240]  think that this is going to send a clear message to the other anti-tax protesters to discourage
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:25.240]  things or to-
[3:03:25.240 --> 3:03:32.280]  I'll tell you what happened with that. I supported Ed and Elaine the entire time, but I said
[3:03:32.280 --> 3:03:36.840]  it needs to be nonviolent because of these patriots, a lot of them are big on talk and
[3:03:36.840 --> 3:03:42.720]  short on action. Like Elvis said, let's talk a little more action and I saw things escalating
[3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:47.800]  and I knew feds were in there trying to hype things, get the paranoia going. That whole
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:53.360]  thing was a setup and then I was the bad one when I told folks, I said this isn't a game,
[3:03:53.360 --> 3:03:56.440]  I said it's a joke and when the feds go in there and grab them, people aren't going to
[3:03:56.440 --> 3:03:57.680]  help them.
[3:03:57.680 --> 3:04:03.680]  So Ed and Elaine Brown are good people. We got a story up about how they were wrongfully
[3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:11.280]  put in prison, but they were set up and now they're going to spend the rest of their lives
[3:04:11.280 --> 3:04:17.240]  in prison and it's a horrible shame. But I know how these things work and I heard the
[3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:25.600]  people on air, I saw the operations going on and the feds just love this. Bob Chapman.
[3:04:25.600 --> 3:04:32.040]  I think that they shouldn't worry too much because sometime over the next five years
[3:04:32.040 --> 3:04:36.040]  this thing's going to blow up and we're going to take them out of prison and we're going
[3:04:36.040 --> 3:04:42.720]  to put Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Geithner in their places and their cells.
[3:04:42.720 --> 3:04:49.120]  Well I say that, certainly a great idea Bob Chapman. I mean mainstream news admits Geithner
[3:04:49.120 --> 3:04:53.560]  works for Goldman Sachs as he steals all the money and gives it to them. I mean they're
[3:04:53.560 --> 3:04:58.440]  openly bank robbing everything, but SWAT teams are grabbing elderly couples and throwing
[3:04:58.440 --> 3:05:01.400]  them in the hoose count.
[3:05:01.400 --> 3:05:05.240]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:05:05.240 --> 3:05:10.560]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[3:05:10.560 --> 3:05:15.720]  auditor they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[3:05:15.720 --> 3:05:19.760]  water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and
[3:05:19.760 --> 3:05:24.920]  developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric
[3:05:24.920 --> 3:05:29.400]  Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking
[3:05:29.400 --> 3:05:34.720]  water. The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere

[3:05:40.120 --> 3:05:41.120]  techniques.

[3:08:02.440 --> 3:08:08.440]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:15.480]  Look, I just want listeners to understand something. All I go off of is what the Rand
[3:08:15.480 --> 3:08:22.760]  Corporation Trilateral Commission CFR has to say. In fact, I've got it in there on Aaron's
[3:08:22.760 --> 3:08:27.200]  desk as we were working on a new film we put in the film last night with Jeb Bush at the
[3:08:27.200 --> 3:08:33.840]  CFR running the committee that is going to instruct the president how to shanghai the
[3:08:33.840 --> 3:08:40.640]  people with illegal alien amnesty and completely breaking the back of sovereignty of the nation
[3:08:40.640 --> 3:08:45.400]  because once we implode and fall apart, the big global corporations, the powerful government,
[3:08:45.400 --> 3:08:51.320]  it's the only life raft to swim to. It's come on board with us or drowned, be slaves with
[3:08:51.320 --> 3:08:56.280]  us or drowned. This is what feudalism and serfdom is and for those of us that study
[3:08:56.280 --> 3:09:00.840]  this, we understand it. It's history. I can pick up any famous award-winning history
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:04.920]  book and read about the same systems there. It's not like I have some knowledge no one
[3:09:04.920 --> 3:09:10.520]  else has. I guess it's like if you know how to ride a skateboard and jump a curb but somebody
[3:09:10.520 --> 3:09:13.640]  else doesn't, it's just you can't believe they don't know how. Or if somebody can't
[3:09:13.640 --> 3:09:18.280]  ride a biker like it's so simple and the public goes, there is no bike. You're insane. It's
[3:09:18.280 --> 3:09:23.360]  a conspiracy theory. And I'm going, look, you need to learn how to ride this bike.
[3:09:23.360 --> 3:09:26.320]  Our better analogy is, you know, the house is on fire. I'm going, look, you got fire
[3:09:26.320 --> 3:09:30.400]  smoke coming out right there. This has happened before. We know what fires look like. They're
[3:09:30.400 --> 3:09:35.120]  going, oh, there's no problem. It's okay to have spies spying on us locally and have
[3:09:35.120 --> 3:09:39.560]  the kids being trained to spy on their parents and have offshore banks with unlimited money.
[3:09:39.560 --> 3:09:47.000]  We're screwed. I have a family too. You just keep wanting it to stop. You keep wanting
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:51.120]  it to end. I want to quit the radio show. I don't want to make films. I don't want to
[3:09:51.120 --> 3:09:59.120]  come up here tonight and work. I'm sick of it. I don't want to have a Dinecore video
[3:09:59.120 --> 3:10:04.160]  from Congress where they admit in congressional hearings, Dinecore and Halliburton run giant
[3:10:04.160 --> 3:10:08.480]  child kidnapping rings and Rumsfeld says they're above the law. We're not going to do anything
[3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:15.280]  to them. I mean, it's freaking me out. It freaks me out. We've had 50 million abortions
[3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:20.360]  and people make excuses about that and lie about that and say it in a baby. It's a baby
[3:10:20.360 --> 3:10:29.840]  dumbass. I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm tired of people playing games with reality. Sodium
[3:10:29.840 --> 3:10:34.840]  fluoride eats holes in your brains and gives you bone cancer. Show them. Just Google the
[3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:39.880]  term fluoride bone cancer. Thousands of mainstream articles, government documents. You're going
[3:10:39.880 --> 3:10:45.800]  to see it. Look, people say, oh, well, you don't do a perfect job or you do this. You
[3:10:45.800 --> 3:10:54.440]  do that. I know I'm not perfect. I'm not up to this task. I'm sick of it. And I'm not
[3:10:54.440 --> 3:11:01.200]  trying to rant. I said, I'll take a few more calls for Bob Chapman. It's just, this is
[3:11:01.200 --> 3:11:07.720]  so real. I can't believe I'm watching the equivalent of a Soviet slash Nazi takeover
[3:11:07.720 --> 3:11:14.840]  of America happening. I can't believe it. Bob, you ever feel like that? Just like, I mean,
[3:11:14.840 --> 3:11:20.120]  even though we're immersed in this, that it's still so classically corrupt, so classically
[3:11:20.120 --> 3:11:26.080]  evil, so classically bad, and the public's like under some kind of spell. And then the
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:30.920]  and then the we're running on fumes. Everything's falling apart. Society's imploding. Thank
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:36.520]  you, Aaron. Here's a council on farm relations, backs amnesty for illegals, opposes our Pio
[3:11:36.520 --> 3:11:42.640]  style raids, CFR recommendations, amnesty plans, Florida Governor Jeb Bush with the
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:50.960]  CFR task force, advising Obama. Your comments, your comments on that rant, Bob Chapman.
[3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:56.920]  Well, number one, as far as the CFR is concerned, that's exactly what you should expect for
[3:11:56.920 --> 3:12:05.520]  them. And it shows you it's a bipartisan organization. All of the members have the same goal in mind,
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:10.240]  and that is world government. So it doesn't matter what party they're in. Most of them
[3:12:10.240 --> 3:12:16.880]  are members of the Illuminati, which includes Bush family. And to refer back to what you
[3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:24.080]  were talking about just now, yes, it does get burdensome as deeply as we have been involved
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:30.480]  in this for as the number of years that we've been. We're always shocked when the things
[3:12:30.480 --> 3:12:38.560]  that we predict happen, such as the arrogant in openness, arrogance in openness of these
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:46.800]  people doing what they're doing. I guess we thought in our mind's eye that perhaps we
[3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:54.240]  wouldn't be able to see it coming. This is like a movie, and we're part of it. And they
[3:12:54.240 --> 3:12:58.600]  just putting it together for us. But we know what we're going to have to do in the final
[3:12:58.600 --> 3:13:03.680]  analysis. And I think the military knows as well. And that's where it's going to end
[3:13:03.680 --> 3:13:09.760]  up. And it's either going to be them or us. And there's 300 million Americans out there,
[3:13:09.760 --> 3:13:15.920]  80 million have been trained in the military, and 40 million have been seen combat. And
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:21.840]  so we're counting on you because we're going to need you because these people in Washington
[3:13:21.840 --> 3:13:30.760]  tend on getting rid of people like Alex and I in you, believe me. And you saw the recent
[3:13:30.760 --> 3:13:38.000]  commentaries about who the terrorists are. Anybody who's not in the military who's been
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:45.280]  trained for the military, well, that's all of us practically. And so this is where this
[3:13:45.280 --> 3:13:50.880]  thing is headed. And we're just going to keep it together and keep on slashing away at the
[3:13:50.880 --> 3:13:53.120]  forest and knocking those trees down.
[3:13:53.120 --> 3:13:58.520]  Well, that's it. We can't let them break our spirit. And my spirit isn't broken. It's
[3:13:58.520 --> 3:14:02.440]  stronger than ever. I just can't believe that the public doesn't know they're under total
[3:14:02.440 --> 3:14:11.880]  attack. And they're just letting the enemy lock their heads off. And it's just, it's
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:13.600]  just so mind blowing, Bob.
[3:14:13.600 --> 3:14:19.880]  Well, it gets overwhelming at times, I know. And just like all of the work that we do.
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:25.120]  And especially the enormous amount of work we physically and mentally and emotionally
[3:14:25.120 --> 3:14:31.480]  do every day. I mean, I had a cold this week. I had to shut down operations for a day. And
[3:14:31.480 --> 3:14:38.160]  here we are back again. I won't stop. There's only one way they can stop me. And I'm healthy
[3:14:38.160 --> 3:14:42.520]  and I'm not going to give up. And I'm going to keep on blasting away at these people just
[3:14:42.520 --> 3:14:45.240]  like you are. And we're going to win.
[3:14:45.240 --> 3:14:49.040]  Well, the last thing is for them to kill us. And they have killed a lot of patriots and
[3:14:49.040 --> 3:14:56.000]  people, but I think they understand that as they force people against the wall, that freedom
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:00.280]  is just another word for nothing left to lose. I think they understand we have a Mount
[3:15:00.280 --> 3:15:04.240]  Numbered. And I think they know that they're going to lose in the end. And so they're,
[3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:09.320]  they're trying to eat around the edges and, and, and, and slowly, you know, make excuses
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:11.720]  for what they do.
[3:15:11.720 --> 3:15:18.800]  But it's just going to be Alex, you know, I, this all brings me back to red dawn and
[3:15:18.800 --> 3:15:28.840]  the scene in the, uh, open air, uh, uh, place with a, uh, we're keeping prisoners and, uh,
[3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:35.040]  the boys came, uh, to see their parents who were incarcerated inside this thing by the
[3:15:35.040 --> 3:15:40.440]  communists who had taken over. And, uh, in referring to you and I, if the government
[3:15:40.440 --> 3:15:50.840]  takes us out, like the man said to his son, avenge me. That's all we ask. Avenge me.
[3:15:50.840 --> 3:16:00.520]  Absolutely. Well, I think the system knows that because anybody who doesn't think of
[3:16:00.520 --> 3:16:09.720]  my family, they know, you know, it's just the issue is the average troops in the cops,
[3:16:09.720 --> 3:16:14.440]  they're just biological androids if they're not awake. I don't even want, I don't have
[3:16:14.440 --> 3:16:19.680]  some macho wish to go, go get in a fight with them. You know, that's the thing, Bob. I mean,
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:24.800]  I just want to defeat the Queen Beatrix and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and Maury
[3:16:24.800 --> 3:16:30.920]  Strong and all this scum. And that was my closing point to you. And I appreciate you
[3:16:30.920 --> 3:16:37.540]  joining us. Bob Chapman is that I was watching congressional debates and I was watching some
[3:16:37.540 --> 3:16:42.520]  of the Obama staff and his people and some of the Republican leadership as well. I mean,
[3:16:42.520 --> 3:16:52.120]  these really are just oily dirt bag crooks and they're just there to manhandle with
[3:16:52.120 --> 3:16:58.360]  their canned ham hands stuff through. I saw Barney Frank live yesterday going, we know
[3:16:58.360 --> 3:17:03.320]  this, but this bill isn't good, but it doesn't matter. We've just got to get this foreign
[3:17:03.320 --> 3:17:08.880]  service spending bill for 10 billion or whatever it was through. And then Obama was signing
[3:17:08.880 --> 3:17:16.120]  statements can, can, can, can fix it. I mean, I was watching him say to the Democrats, stop
[3:17:16.120 --> 3:17:22.280]  fighting Obama, add whatever you want with signing statements. And then here's Obama
[3:17:22.280 --> 3:17:26.280]  saying he doesn't do signing statements while he's already breaking Bush's record and the
[3:17:26.280 --> 3:17:31.160]  number of signing statements in this many months in office, you know, four months in
[3:17:31.160 --> 3:17:36.760]  office, he's beating Bush in four months of office. And here's the president now, just
[3:17:36.760 --> 3:17:42.760]  like an imperial ruler with signing statements. I mean, it's just, but then they say he doesn't
[3:17:42.760 --> 3:17:47.520]  sign signing statements. And here's Barney Frank just admitting we don't even have a
[3:17:47.520 --> 3:17:53.760]  government. It's just criminals doing whatever they want as if if they pass a bill that Obama
[3:17:53.760 --> 3:18:04.480]  could just legislate from the executive, whatever he wants. Just amazing, isn't it, Bob? It's
[3:18:04.480 --> 3:18:11.440]  the world we live in and we got to deal with it. All right, buddy. I'll see you next Friday.
[3:18:11.440 --> 3:18:16.200]  All right, the international forecaster.com. Our sites are prisonplanet.tv and info wars.com.
[3:18:16.200 --> 3:18:19.920]  We're about to break. I want to get into global warming hoax first and what it really means
[3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:23.840]  Webster Tarpley, then some economic news and more calls. In fact, the calls on economics
[3:18:23.840 --> 3:18:30.680]  can just ask Tarpley those questions and get their view on it. But Webster, do you ever
[3:18:30.680 --> 3:18:35.680]  stagger back by the hypocrisy of Obama? When you said he was going to be the greatest liar
[3:18:35.680 --> 3:18:40.760]  ever, six months before he was in office, I thought you had gone overboard. I knew it
[3:18:40.760 --> 3:18:45.560]  was bad, but I mean, this guy has brought lying to a new level where he says I'm against
[3:18:45.560 --> 3:18:50.480]  Bush and torture. It was outrageous. And against secret detention. That's why we're
[3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:57.120]  going to just have preemptive stuff for what you might commit with no, with no evidence.
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:19:03.480]  So it's now pre cog, pre crime. I mean, it's like an alternate dimension. Webster Tarpley.
[3:19:03.480 --> 3:19:08.080]  Well, it's, um, I guess the first president who wanted this stuff was Nixon, right? Preventive
[3:19:08.080 --> 3:19:15.520]  detention. And now we have Obama with unlimited detention, no habeas corpus, no due process,
[3:19:15.520 --> 3:19:20.960]  no nothing. And you see that it seems to me it's a three part process. You have a world
[3:19:20.960 --> 3:19:26.080]  economic depression. You go back to the 1930s. First you have a depression, then you're
[3:19:26.080 --> 3:19:31.440]  going to have pressures towards dictatorship. Unless you can solve the depression, most
[3:19:31.440 --> 3:19:37.000]  governments in the world go into this authoritarian involution. And then at the end of that, you've
[3:19:37.000 --> 3:19:41.960]  got World War three. And we can see signs of that. So certainly Obama's a liar. The good
[3:19:41.960 --> 3:19:47.200]  news is that Obama's lies are not successful. He bombed in Moscow. Nobody went Gaga for
[3:19:47.200 --> 3:19:52.240]  Obama in Russia. Russian's very, very smart, much better than the Germans last summer.
[3:19:52.240 --> 3:19:56.720]  And the other side now is he bombed in La Quila where he was trying to ram down. Let's talk
[3:19:56.720 --> 3:20:01.680]  about that. Then the global warming stuff and a lot more. Webster Tarpley is our guest.
[3:20:01.680 --> 3:20:05.720]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non hybrid
[3:20:05.720 --> 3:20:10.520]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[3:20:10.520 --> 3:20:14.400]  non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds have
[3:20:14.400 --> 3:20:17.880]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country. And it's possible that could
[3:20:17.880 --> 3:20:22.440]  even happen again. So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[3:20:22.440 --> 3:20:28.640]  mix of non hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank. And it can produce an endless supply
[3:20:28.640 --> 3:20:33.160]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[3:20:33.160 --> 3:20:37.320]  not been genetically modified in any way. And you actually get enough seeds to plant
[3:20:37.320 --> 3:20:44.680]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com
[3:20:44.680 --> 3:20:56.000]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:21:02.240]  non hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[3:21:02.240 --> 3:21:08.360]  On the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[3:21:08.360 --> 3:21:13.080]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:18.560]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:23.120]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged
[3:21:23.120 --> 3:21:27.840]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:33.800]  or a personality cultist who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[3:21:33.800 --> 3:21:40.200]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about
[3:21:40.200 --> 3:21:46.840]  a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,
[3:21:46.840 --> 3:21:53.760]  and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download
[3:21:53.760 --> 3:22:01.800]  it in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:22:01.800 --> 3:22:04.520]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:09.680]  financial affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts,
[3:22:09.680 --> 3:22:13.960]  confiscation of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again
[3:22:13.960 --> 3:22:18.920]  have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug
[3:22:18.920 --> 3:22:23.840]  and Money Laundering Act, the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with
[3:22:23.840 --> 3:22:28.600]  the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some precious metal
[3:22:28.600 --> 3:22:33.360]  holdings are subject to government intervention. For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared
[3:22:33.360 --> 3:22:37.280]  a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately. Whether if you

[3:24:00.720 --> 3:24:11.440]  All right, we're back live. Webster, I want to get into global warming first. Then we'll
[3:24:11.440 --> 3:24:15.960]  get into you saying he flopped. I don't know if I completely agree with that, but I respect
[3:24:15.960 --> 3:24:22.360]  your opinion. But I haven't been following him maybe as closely as you have. But I was
[3:24:22.360 --> 3:24:32.000]  in Barnes and Nobles last Friday, and I just decided to randomly walk across the room to
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:38.960]  the stacks of magazines and to just see what the propaganda was, close my eyes, and grab
[3:24:38.960 --> 3:24:46.560]  two. I only got through one. One was in Women's Magazine. One was the Atlantic. And I opened
[3:24:46.560 --> 3:24:54.840]  it up and literally 50%, I have all my notes in here, of the ads are we need a global carbon
[3:24:54.840 --> 3:25:00.200]  tax and they're most up and paid for by oil companies. And then so I sort of digging through
[3:25:00.200 --> 3:25:05.320]  time and Newsweek and a few other magazines when I was over at my parents, they were all
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:18.960]  the same. I mean, you talk about total propaganda immersion. Every other ad is for global carbon
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:27.360]  taxes and how it will save us. And then another one is how the family isn't good. And we need
[3:25:27.360 --> 3:25:33.240]  to stop having marriages. And basically the state can raise the kids. And then there's
[3:25:33.240 --> 3:25:40.520]  another weird one in here that says they want to start terraforming the planet with giant
[3:25:40.520 --> 3:25:46.600]  blimps. I mean, you can't make up this much craziness. I mean, the public is just as much
[3:25:46.600 --> 3:25:52.640]  as I think I know about propaganda. It's total immersion, Webster. All the oil companies,
[3:25:52.640 --> 3:25:57.080]  all the big banks, everybody behind this global carbon tax to regulate every facet of our
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:26:02.680]  lives and like with the car companies where Obama only keeps open the car dealerships
[3:26:02.680 --> 3:26:09.400]  that make payments to him. I mean, is this just pure mafia government? And why are they
[3:26:09.400 --> 3:26:11.840]  pushing so hard for this carbon tax?
[3:26:11.840 --> 3:26:17.000]  Well, of course, it's a form of mass brainwashing. But let's also remember something similar
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:23.600]  has been tried before. If you go back to the Carter era, it was the same hysterical propaganda
[3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:30.000]  about the limits to growth, the need for sacrifice, the idea of synthetic fuels that
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:36.920]  oil was bad and that nuclear, of course, was demonized with the staged three mile island
[3:26:36.920 --> 3:26:42.080]  incident with a scenario film with Jane Fonda coming out two weeks before, and so on and
[3:26:42.080 --> 3:26:45.960]  so forth. If you go back, if you have any old paperback books, go and look in the back.
[3:26:45.960 --> 3:26:52.120]  The ones that come from the late 1970s have some kind of stuff about limits to growth
[3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:57.320]  or the population bomb or the oil crisis or something like this. So this is standard.
[3:26:57.320 --> 3:27:02.880]  This is that wing of the trilateral commission in the Bilderberg. It's the Rockefeller group
[3:27:02.880 --> 3:27:06.760]  and the soft power group and the rest of them.
[3:27:06.760 --> 3:27:15.800]  And as you're speaking for prisonplanet.tv viewers, I'm on page one of the Atlantic and
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:18.960]  while you're talking, I'm just going to be flipping through it. See, this is Dutch royal
[3:27:18.960 --> 3:27:24.160]  shell owned by Queen Matrix saying we've got to cut the CO2 and have a global tax.
[3:27:24.160 --> 3:27:28.960]  That's the flagship of the oil cartel, Royal Dutch Shell. That's the Anglo-Dutch heart
[3:27:28.960 --> 3:27:34.600]  of the matter. That's the alliance that was cemented with William and Mary going over
[3:27:34.600 --> 3:27:39.320]  to take over from the stewards in 1688 with the glorious revolution. That's the current
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:47.080]  form of that. However, just on that front, BP, British Petroleum, had this whole demagogic
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:53.120]  campaign that they were beyond petroleum. They have dropped it. It's a loser. So remember,
[3:27:53.120 --> 3:28:00.720]  this doesn't go on forever. It's a huge assault right now, but don't give up, don't despair
[3:28:00.720 --> 3:28:05.800]  because this is the hysteria and it's very intense, but I don't think it can be kept
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:06.800]  up for too long now.
[3:28:06.800 --> 3:28:11.720]  But it's even got Agenda 21 in here about UN, I mean, just everything, this whole thing.
[3:28:11.720 --> 3:28:14.400]  Yeah, the whole international bureaucracy, the whole...
[3:28:14.400 --> 3:28:17.440]  This is calling for the fan to be given.
[3:28:17.440 --> 3:28:23.600]  Let's fight back now. I'd like to talk about what I heard from your previous guy. This
[3:28:23.600 --> 3:28:27.880]  is a chance to organize a political party to sweep these people aside, but let's talk
[3:28:27.880 --> 3:28:29.040]  about global warming.
[3:28:29.040 --> 3:28:34.560]  The Waxman bill, what does it do? Cap and trade bill, right? This is a piece of absolute
[3:28:34.560 --> 3:28:42.480]  lunacy. It's $15 per whatever unit of hypothetical carbon that has to be offset. Now, the immediate
[3:28:42.480 --> 3:28:48.040]  effect of this cap and trade essentially is to put another tax on productive activity
[3:28:48.040 --> 3:28:49.040]  in the United States.
[3:28:49.040 --> 3:28:54.440]  This is the opposite of what you want to do. You want to tax speculative Wall Street transactions
[3:28:54.440 --> 3:29:00.400]  with a Tobin tax, a securities transfer tax. So you're taxing paper speculation, not production.
[3:29:00.400 --> 3:29:05.240]  This is obviously the reverse. This leaves the speculation alone. They're going to let
[3:29:05.240 --> 3:29:10.200]  derivatives go further, as Guy Fners said this morning, and now they're going to tax
[3:29:10.200 --> 3:29:16.600]  production. But in particular, it's the final deindustrialization of the United States,
[3:29:16.600 --> 3:29:22.560]  and it's genocide because one of the main U.S. exports that still remains is of course
[3:29:22.560 --> 3:29:28.360]  food. The American farmer is a unique success story. The whole food situation of this planet
[3:29:28.360 --> 3:29:32.360]  depends on the American farmer. If you have a cap and trade, you're going to double the
[3:29:32.360 --> 3:29:37.320]  export price of U.S. corn and U.S. grain. You're going to kill out of the billion people
[3:29:37.320 --> 3:29:41.080]  who are on the verge of starvation. You can easily kill half of them. You're talking about
[3:29:41.080 --> 3:29:47.040]  500 million dead or something like that. And by the way, they admit, they admit that their
[3:29:47.040 --> 3:29:54.200]  carbon cuts will do that. They say that's good. They're on the march, the empires on
[3:29:54.200 --> 3:30:03.680]  the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[3:30:03.680 --> 3:30:08.620]  you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation
[3:30:08.620 --> 3:30:12.960]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants
[3:30:12.960 --> 3:30:17.960]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[3:30:17.960 --> 3:30:22.680]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[3:30:22.680 --> 3:30:26.640]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with
[3:30:26.640 --> 3:30:30.640]  the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm
[3:30:30.640 --> 3:30:34.440]  season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather
[3:30:34.440 --> 3:30:39.240]  related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[3:30:39.240 --> 3:30:43.040]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[3:32:01.520 --> 3:32:07.120]  Americans know the significance of July 4, 1776. However, few know the importance of
[3:32:07.120 --> 3:32:14.480]  September 17, 1787, the day the Constitution was written and adopted by our founders. Unfortunately,
[3:32:14.480 --> 3:32:20.280]  over 200 years later, this sacred document is under attack, along with our beloved Republic,
[3:32:20.280 --> 3:32:24.000]  throughout the span of history, brave men and women have rallied behind banners which

[3:33:00.000 --> 3:33:20.560]  We're going to go back to Tarbley in a moment, but I've been promising to do this since yesterday,
[3:33:20.560 --> 3:33:26.840]  so I want people watching at PrismPlanet.tv. This is just one magazine. I've walked it
[3:33:26.840 --> 3:33:31.160]  with my eyes closed and grabbed off the rack. I said, I want to see what the propaganda
[3:33:31.160 --> 3:33:35.000]  is, because every magazine I seem to open is full of nothing but brainwashing for world
[3:33:35.000 --> 3:33:41.520]  government and the family's bad, and guns are bad, and patriotism's bad, and veterans
[3:33:41.520 --> 3:33:47.960]  are bad, and they need to be arrested. I mean, just crazy. And so I walk over and I grab
[3:33:47.960 --> 3:33:55.000]  the Atlantic. Now look at this. First thing, Dutch roll shelf. They have three ads in this
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:34:01.840]  magazine. CO2 is evil. We need a global carbon tax. We need to have the UN run it with energy,
[3:34:01.840 --> 3:34:09.020]  regional carbon sequestering partnerships to make everybody put their carbon into Dutch
[3:34:09.020 --> 3:34:14.400]  roll shelf mines that will store carbon dioxide below the Earth's crust. I mean, you know,
[3:34:14.400 --> 3:34:20.000]  this total insanity. And then everything's about the Green Revolution, and then you
[3:34:20.000 --> 3:34:25.440]  get into here, and we need global regional control, and the Federal Reserve's got to
[3:34:25.440 --> 3:34:30.840]  run. Every facet of the economy, this is the Federal Reserve takeover. All states advertising.
[3:34:30.840 --> 3:34:36.240]  Everybody's going to be forced to have insurance. So everybody in the pool. And then you've
[3:34:36.240 --> 3:34:41.560]  got IBM saying, we're going to make everybody accept our smart grid. This will lower CO2
[3:34:41.560 --> 3:34:47.920]  emissions, because only absolutely essential travel will be allowed. I mean, this is total
[3:34:47.920 --> 3:34:53.200]  tyranny, but this is a magazine. Look, Monsanto. We got to force everybody on the GMO. It's
[3:34:53.200 --> 3:34:58.560]  wonderful. Letters to the editor. This is all global governments needed. Police states
[3:34:58.560 --> 3:35:03.000]  needed. JPMorgan's great. We're going to save you. Why an oil company president supports
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:11.240]  cap and trade. An open letter from shell.us. Of course, US doesn't even mean the United
[3:35:11.240 --> 3:35:15.160]  States. They just put that on there to make you think it's like America. Oh, look, he's
[3:35:15.160 --> 3:35:20.000]  America. Look, it's a Dutch roll shell right there. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a few pages
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:28.280]  into this. This is a story about how we need the feds to take over. I mean, it's, it's,
[3:35:28.280 --> 3:35:37.720]  it's literally, here's another one about global carbon taxes and 401ks and the banks and this
[3:35:37.720 --> 3:35:46.120]  story is about it. And I mean, it's literally all propaganda. And, and, and then I randomly
[3:35:46.120 --> 3:35:51.800]  pick up other magazines. It, it used to be drug ads in these things. And there's still
[3:35:51.800 --> 3:35:57.160]  a few of those, but now it's, you know, here's Lipitor. There's one there, but mainly it's
[3:35:57.160 --> 3:36:01.600]  we need a global carbon tax and to control everybody. And this says, don't read the food
[3:36:01.600 --> 3:36:07.040]  packages. Just look at the rating game. This is about Harry Potter having sex with topless
[3:36:07.040 --> 3:36:15.520]  dancers. Very strange. Here's another one about global markets. Here's another one about
[3:36:15.520 --> 3:36:21.400]  a car company. And now we need global carbon taxes and controls. Here's another one for
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:29.720]  global carbon taxes and controls. Here's another one. I mean, it, it's just unbelievable. Here's
[3:36:29.720 --> 3:36:36.760]  another one about essentials to reuse recyclable materials. And again, it's a total cult brain
[3:36:36.760 --> 3:36:44.240]  washing and car companies bragging about how they're doing this and just on and on and
[3:36:44.240 --> 3:36:51.880]  on and on and then Dow chemical with propaganda about the environment. I mean, notice this
[3:36:51.880 --> 3:36:55.600]  is the only advertising. There's no more money left. It's all just the robber barons
[3:36:55.600 --> 3:37:04.520]  raping everybody. And look, look at this one. Then it says, do we want to chem trail everybody
[3:37:04.520 --> 3:37:08.840]  that shows a blimp spraying chemicals? Cause they say, oh, the earth is dying from carbon
[3:37:08.840 --> 3:37:13.040]  dioxide that plants breathe, but do we want to let the secret chem trailing program go
[3:37:13.040 --> 3:37:19.080]  on moving heaven and earth? And then I got the Wall Street Journal saying we need global
[3:37:19.080 --> 3:37:22.520]  chem trailing and that it's already going on. I mean, I mean, we're living in the twilight.
[3:37:22.520 --> 3:37:26.440]  Folks, I'm not even halfway through the magazine and tar please on hold. And I want to get
[3:37:26.440 --> 3:37:32.920]  his take on a whole bunch of stuff as well. But here, here's another one. And then they've
[3:37:32.920 --> 3:37:39.680]  got one in here about how marrying is bad and then better luck this time. Another article
[3:37:39.680 --> 3:37:44.080]  about the green economy. I mean, that's all folks. This is a random magazine. It's just
[3:37:44.080 --> 3:37:52.360]  total brainwashing. This is worse than 1984. I mean, do people learn are people not insulted
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:37:58.920]  by being immersed in stuff like this, being immersed in total propaganda, total brainwashing?
[3:37:58.920 --> 3:38:04.040]  There's another one about the power grid and the takeover. Here's another one about the
[3:38:04.040 --> 3:38:09.960]  environment. Here's another bank advertisement. Here's one about daredevil. William F Buckley
[3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:14.320]  admitted CIA fake conservative, sent in to destroy the conservative movement, show this
[3:38:14.320 --> 3:38:20.920]  slime bag how great he is. It's just all unbelievable crap. And I'm trying to find the one about
[3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:26.520]  how marriage isn't good, get rid of it. I mean, these people literally are waging war
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:36.280]  on reality. And they are genocidalist. They are psychopathic control freaks. They are
[3:38:36.280 --> 3:38:42.200]  complete scum. I'm going to find the one saying get rid of marriage. I'll find it while Webster
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:47.760]  is talking. Oh, Webster. Oh, yeah. Here's the last ad. Another one with shell in the
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:53.960]  new energy future will need to think around corners. And then it says the global population
[3:38:53.960 --> 3:39:00.600]  and what shell wants to do to take care of it. I mean, these people mean business Webster.
[3:39:00.600 --> 3:39:05.320]  What does it mean? Because I've since looked at other magazines when it's almost a complete
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:11.520]  conversion. No more drug company ads. Now it's just direct banking and oil company propaganda.
[3:39:11.520 --> 3:39:19.200]  Well, you got to remember that the Atlantic monthly is the house organ of the left oligarchy.
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:27.080]  I call them the left oligarchs. This is the Boston and Connecticut Insurance Mutual Fund.
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:31.760]  It's kind of a second wall street that you have up there in New England. So this extreme
[3:39:31.760 --> 3:39:38.000]  multicultural politically correct. And what they're expressing is their class consciousness.
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:42.640]  In other words, what seems to me to be worth underlining is the hysteria of all of this,
[3:39:42.640 --> 3:39:47.920]  the desperation, the lunacy of it all, right? It's like a-
[3:39:47.920 --> 3:39:53.960]  Yeah, these people need to be in insane asylums. I agree. I mean, they say get rid of the fricking
[3:39:53.960 --> 3:39:58.240]  family openly. They're waging war on the species.
[3:39:58.240 --> 3:40:06.960]  Right. What you learn from this is that the U.S. ruling elite is terminally decadent.
[3:40:06.960 --> 3:40:12.000]  You can choose between keeping that ruling elite and having the country go down. If they
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:16.640]  remain in power with the kinds of values they have, and Obama is, of course, their creature,
[3:40:16.640 --> 3:40:22.240]  Obama finds this very congenial. These are his ego ideals, right? The Yale Law School
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:28.400]  and Columbia and all the rest of this. This is the territory of the Atlantic Monthly.
[3:40:28.400 --> 3:40:32.480]  And they were big supporters. Andrew Sullivan is one of the guys who said, if we can only
[3:40:32.480 --> 3:40:36.600]  get Obama in, then we can go back to false flag because people will believe him where
[3:40:36.600 --> 3:40:37.600]  they wouldn't believe-
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:43.480]  Well, there isn't a strange fate that I said, I'm going to randomly walk across Barnes and
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:49.240]  Noble, close my eyes 10 feet away, walk up and randomly grab two magazines. This is one
[3:40:49.240 --> 3:40:52.240]  of them. The other one's a women's magazine. I haven't been able to read yet, but the first
[3:40:52.240 --> 3:40:56.520]  page was get rid of your man. And it's the same message in here. I guess they want to
[3:40:56.520 --> 3:41:02.720]  destroy the family because anything that's cohesive, anything that stands upright away
[3:41:02.720 --> 3:41:08.120]  from them must be destroyed because we've all got to cling to their skirts. I mean, what
[3:41:08.120 --> 3:41:09.120]  is-
[3:41:09.120 --> 3:41:14.960]  Again, this is their class consciousness. And what they would say is, this is the ruling
[3:41:14.960 --> 3:41:19.960]  class that hates the blue collar and middle class. So what they're saying is that we
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:27.040]  don't like middle class values or working class values because we are this cosmopolitan
[3:41:27.040 --> 3:41:33.160]  polymorphous perverse mass of creatures, right? And therefore, we don't like your
[3:41:33.160 --> 3:41:38.360]  Victorian morality, right? This is also Soros, right? He wants to legalize drugs, right?
[3:41:38.360 --> 3:41:42.920]  He wants to bring in massive narcotics, make it available everywhere. And there's a big
[3:41:42.920 --> 3:41:47.840]  campaign. If you look at MSNBC, they're actively campaigning for drug legalization, which would
[3:41:47.840 --> 3:41:53.800]  be one of the main tools that they would use to destroy the family. Any parent knows that
[3:41:53.800 --> 3:41:58.600]  anybody coming on the scene saying, I want to legalize drugs is your deadly enemy, right?
[3:41:58.600 --> 3:42:03.720]  That's the middle class fighting for its existence against this hysterical oligarchy.
[3:42:03.720 --> 3:42:10.080]  Tarpa, let me stop you there. And I'm not going to interrupt much more, but I'm for decriminalization
[3:42:10.080 --> 3:42:13.520]  because we know they use it to launder the money and then put people in prison. I'm
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:17.840]  not for legalization. And you're right. I've seen the university papers about how they
[3:42:17.840 --> 3:42:21.820]  want to drug the public. That's what the Prozac and Ritalin is. And I understand the
[3:42:21.820 --> 3:42:26.840]  Soros angle is he loves it for that. But can't you see that they're also using the phony
[3:42:26.840 --> 3:42:29.320]  drug war as another pretext of control?
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:34.160]  But there's no drug war. The CIA brings the drugs and Wall Street launders the money.
[3:42:34.160 --> 3:42:38.880]  And if you're going to capitulate to the CIA and Wall Street, that's the end of it.
[3:42:38.880 --> 3:42:43.920]  You think now they want to legalize it directly, sell it to us. And then maybe make kids take
[3:42:43.920 --> 3:42:44.920]  it in their lunchboxes.
[3:42:44.920 --> 3:42:50.040]  Yes, they want the American people to be more stupefied than they are. They say you're
[3:42:50.040 --> 3:42:55.240]  not stupefied enough. You've got to be more inert, more apathetic, more dumbed down. And
[3:42:55.240 --> 3:42:59.880]  the next wave is we're going to say that marijuana is cool and we're going to ram that down
[3:42:59.880 --> 3:43:00.880]  your throat.
[3:43:00.880 --> 3:43:04.560]  Well, look at Afghanistan. And I'm sure you've seen this, but now the BBC admits, I heard
[3:43:04.560 --> 3:43:08.040]  this a month ago in my car and almost fell over. So I've told the story every day since
[3:43:08.040 --> 3:43:13.680]  and they said, Oh, the army does guard the poppy fields now. So the local farmers have
[3:43:13.680 --> 3:43:18.200]  some money. And so the Taliban can't rough them up when the Taliban has been given different
[3:43:18.200 --> 3:43:22.640]  sectors works for the government as a client, as you've documented. And they admitted it's
[3:43:22.640 --> 3:43:28.360]  up like ninefold what it was. And local news says here in Austin, we're neck deep swimming
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:34.800]  and heroin. I mean, they're openly shipping it in now and saying it's for America's security.
[3:43:34.800 --> 3:43:39.200]  And these are the last days of Pompeii. What I would say is the kind of stuff you're seeing
[3:43:39.200 --> 3:43:44.440]  with that, that, that sort of eco fascism in the Atlantic monthly, that is a ruling
[3:43:44.440 --> 3:43:50.320]  class that sees the British Isles are sinking into the North Sea under the weight of, you
[3:43:50.320 --> 3:43:55.760]  know, trillions and trillions of derivatives. And the US is collapsing at a breathtaking
[3:43:55.760 --> 3:44:01.560]  rate. So the Anglo American ruling class collectively says we are doomed. If they were religious,
[3:44:01.560 --> 3:44:05.560]  they would express this with the idea that the end of the world is at hand because for
[3:44:05.560 --> 3:44:10.800]  them, it seems to be now they're they're obviously neo pagan. So they express it in this stuff.
[3:44:10.800 --> 3:44:15.320]  You know, the polar bears are dying and the seas are rising and all the rest of it. But
[3:44:15.320 --> 3:44:19.800]  even there, notice British petroleum, you're not going to find any more British petroleum
[3:44:19.800 --> 3:44:23.840]  green ads because they've quit it. That's the news from yesterday. They're not going
[3:44:23.840 --> 3:44:28.240]  to be beyond petroleum anymore. They're going to be we're an oil and gas company and that's
[3:44:28.240 --> 3:44:33.560]  who we are. And we're giving up this whole idiotic garbage of beyond petroleum. So this
[3:44:33.560 --> 3:44:38.120]  is the good news. You're saying you believe they're stalling and they did announce yesterday.
[3:44:38.120 --> 3:44:43.320]  We're not going to bring the carbon tax vote up for two months in the Senate. But I think
[3:44:43.320 --> 3:44:48.000]  that could be a fast one. But, but, but you're saying from your antennae, your feelers out
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:53.680]  there that you're saying you believe this, this was all this over propaganda, this over
[3:44:53.680 --> 3:45:01.520]  energetic propaganda everywhere was actually a death rattle, a, a, a, a new order sits in
[3:45:01.520 --> 3:45:05.960]  its in its crap filled diapers. There is no plan. In other words, this is these are a
[3:45:05.960 --> 3:45:11.360]  bunch of pragmatists to they go from one thing to another. But the idea is that if you look
[3:45:11.360 --> 3:45:15.800]  at the situation, I think in the Congress, it's going to be hard to pass this. If you
[3:45:15.800 --> 3:45:20.360]  look at the, the world situation, that's really the news of today was the last day of the
[3:45:20.360 --> 3:45:26.920]  world economic summit, the group of eight in La Quila presided over by Berlusconi. The
[3:45:26.920 --> 3:45:32.520]  Obama's task, Obama was the chairman of this expanded group of eight where they brought
[3:45:32.520 --> 3:45:37.440]  in Brazil, they brought in some other third world countries, developing countries, and
[3:45:37.440 --> 3:45:42.440]  they said, okay, now you're going to join in on some kind of a cap and trade or carbon
[3:45:42.440 --> 3:45:48.920]  emissions limits. We're going to impose our carbon, uh, offsets and permits on you and
[3:45:48.920 --> 3:45:55.400]  Lula of all people, the international monetary fund puppet Lula of Brazil says no, we're
[3:45:55.400 --> 3:46:01.480]  not going to do it. And also India says no and China says no. So this is a good case
[3:46:01.480 --> 3:46:06.600]  where the third world got us to write and then we're the, you know, but this is a big
[3:46:06.600 --> 3:46:11.840]  defeat. But this was what they wanted to do is to say, how do we strangle the economic
[3:46:11.840 --> 3:46:16.080]  development of China and India and Brazil? How do we, because these are the brick, right?
[3:46:16.080 --> 3:46:21.080]  You put in Russia, that's the brick, the B R I C group. How do we strangle them? Well,
[3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:25.480]  they said we'll use, we won't, we won't try to bomb them because we can't, it's too big
[3:46:25.480 --> 3:46:30.960]  and you know, the consequences would be disastrous. We won't use Bush's right wing methods anymore.
[3:46:30.960 --> 3:46:36.040]  We'll use Obama's left wing methods and we'll get them to strangle them with, uh, rather
[3:46:36.040 --> 3:46:41.080]  than bomb them, strangle them using these left wing, uh, demagogic slogans about global
[3:46:41.080 --> 3:46:44.880]  warming and the polar bears and all the rest of this stuff. As far as I can see, he has
[3:46:44.880 --> 3:46:50.680]  fallen on his face. And this is one of his primordial tasks. The Anglo-American finance
[3:46:50.680 --> 3:46:55.200]  oligarchs wanted him to strangle above all China and he has failed.
[3:46:55.200 --> 3:47:00.400]  Well, I want to bring this up to you and I want you to break down that good news here,
[3:47:00.400 --> 3:47:09.800]  Webster. But the issue is I did watch his press conference, uh, with a Russian president
[3:47:09.800 --> 3:47:15.560]  and I don't find the Russian president to be particularly an imposing figure, but Obama
[3:47:15.560 --> 3:47:21.640]  was groveling and very supine almost to him. And then I same thing with the Saudi king,
[3:47:21.640 --> 3:47:26.240]  the bowing, the groveling, when he doesn't have a teleprompter, is that why he got the
[3:47:26.240 --> 3:47:32.280]  power? Because every time I see him with even an oil company, exec or a banker, he or,
[3:47:32.280 --> 3:47:39.080]  or, or, uh, he is chief of staff or Geithner, he literally totes and bowels to everyone.
[3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:46.360]  And is this a problem for the elite when people keep seeing Obama, uh, groveling, uh, to anybody
[3:47:46.360 --> 3:47:50.200]  and everybody? He is like Lord, uh, Sir Neville Chamberlain and
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:57.200]  with Obama is a weakling and appeaser by design in the sense that only by being an appeaser
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:02.200]  can he be the kind of warmonger that they need. Remember with Chamberlain, Chamberlain
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:06.040]  said, we're not going to get involved. We're just going to build up Hitler and play him
[3:48:06.040 --> 3:48:10.520]  against the Soviets and Stalin. And we'll get rid of both of them in the process and
[3:48:10.520 --> 3:48:14.880]  the British Empire can go on for another hundred years. With Obama, it's the same thing. We
[3:48:14.880 --> 3:48:20.280]  are too bankrupt. Our military is at the point of collapse, I would think. Uh, we're, we're
[3:48:20.280 --> 3:48:24.640]  isolated. We're hated. We can't attack anybody. We've got to play the enemy states one, one
[3:48:24.640 --> 3:48:29.040]  against another. And therefore we need a president who is structurally a weakling and
[3:48:29.040 --> 3:48:36.040]  an appeaser, but this hides the cunning, right? The whole, uh, dissembling deception, uh,
[3:48:36.040 --> 3:48:41.600]  strategic trickery, duping, brainwashing, hypnosis, all the stuff that Obama brings.
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:45.800]  That's how he, he operates. Now in terms of Russia, I think he bombed there. The first
[3:48:45.800 --> 3:48:51.280]  thing is the New York Times admits Obama's magic got him nowhere. The Russians were not
[3:48:51.280 --> 3:48:53.040]  impressed. That's off to the Russians.
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:48:56.480]  Medvedev was looking at him like he was some type of jackass.
[3:48:56.480 --> 3:49:02.160]  Well, and Medvedev, Medvedev is not the strongest. I mean, Putin is the one who really counts.
[3:49:02.160 --> 3:49:06.880]  But in terms of the, of the Russian masses, they couldn't care less about Obama. You didn't
[3:49:06.880 --> 3:49:13.160]  have 200,000 Russian lemmings for Obama. The way you had 200,000 German lemmings at
[3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:17.640]  the Brandenburg Gate last year for Obama. That didn't happen. Now the, the key one that
[3:49:17.640 --> 3:49:22.960]  I watched was the Obama-Putin meeting. This was this breakfast meeting yesterday. And you
[3:49:22.960 --> 3:49:27.360]  could see that this was a tense meeting. This was no love fest. And at the end, according
[3:49:27.360 --> 3:49:32.480]  to the RT correspondent, Russia Today, cable television, if you can get it or the internet,
[3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:39.240]  there was an argument. There was an altercation between Putin and Obama. Now the, the results
[3:49:39.240 --> 3:49:46.320]  of this are what? The U.S. now has the right to fly over Russia, to deliver military equipment
[3:49:46.320 --> 3:49:51.600]  to Afghanistan. And this is like saying, if you insist on going into the inferno, go
[3:49:51.600 --> 3:49:56.480]  ahead. Well, you know, be our guest. We know what you will find in Afghanistan. You will
[3:49:56.480 --> 3:50:01.840]  find defeat and death and destruction and the possible collapse of your own state. So
[3:50:01.840 --> 3:50:06.160]  they say, if you really want this, you know, go ahead and do it. So that's, that's the
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:11.920]  big result. The other one is Medvedev wanted a nuclear states conference kind of, you know,
[3:50:11.920 --> 3:50:18.320]  nuclear issues. The U.S. will, will accept that too. Funny, will the Israelis be invited?
[3:50:18.320 --> 3:50:22.560]  Are they a nuclear state? They sure are. But they never say they are. And then the third
[3:50:22.560 --> 3:50:30.040]  one is that if, if the Iranians give up a nuclear program, which they always say they
[3:50:30.040 --> 3:50:36.800]  don't have, if they give it up, then the U.S. will not build the missiles in Poland, right?
[3:50:36.800 --> 3:50:42.000]  Now today Medvedev even says, if they insist on building the missiles, we're going to put
[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:48.160]  these short range nukes into, into Kaliningrad, into this exclave of Russia, this East Prussia
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:53.200]  pretty much so we can blow them up within a few minutes. So I don't think, I think nobody was
[3:50:53.200 --> 3:50:57.600]  duped, not even Medvedev, Medvedev was duped. And for sure. I want to briefly talk to you in
[3:50:57.600 --> 3:51:04.320]  the final segment Webster about Iran. How's that going? More than 700 chemicals have been found
[3:51:04.320 --> 3:51:08.240]  in our drinking water. And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[3:51:08.240 --> 3:51:12.880]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled
[3:51:12.880 --> 3:51:17.920]  when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter
[3:51:17.920 --> 3:51:22.560]  works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury,
[3:51:22.560 --> 3:51:28.640]  and iron. And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower
[3:51:28.640 --> 3:51:33.920]  filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants,
[3:51:33.920 --> 3:51:38.880]  and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:51:38.880 --> 3:51:45.040]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99

[3:52:15.440 --> 3:52:20.800]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of
[3:52:20.800 --> 3:52:30.720]  the American people. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:52:30.720 --> 3:52:38.000]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.000 --> 3:52:43.680]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[3:52:43.680 --> 3:52:51.200]  works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[3:53:59.680 --> 3:54:09.040]  Webster, we know they've been spying on 9-11 Truth. They've had congressional hearings demonizing
[3:54:09.040 --> 3:54:14.800]  Richard Gage and others with a thermite and thermate. But a lot of other evidence of harassment
[3:54:14.800 --> 3:54:21.520]  of 9-11 Truthers. Some black ops setups where they come out of dark alleys with women in wheelchairs
[3:54:21.520 --> 3:54:26.400]  and ram you and say you attacked them and we had to fight that in court and that was exposed as a
[3:54:26.400 --> 3:54:31.200]  fraud. The New York Post had to retract. They've now done that again where they attack your car
[3:54:31.200 --> 3:54:35.360]  and then say you tried to run over them. That just happened to a 9-11 Truther where they now
[3:54:35.360 --> 3:54:40.880]  run out and jump on your car. They've got local police. It's coming out. A Q-section at NSA
[3:54:41.520 --> 3:54:47.040]  is now really concerned and spying on government people in the NSA and CIA concerning who know
[3:54:47.040 --> 3:54:53.200]  about 9-11 being an inside job. I mean, when do they run out of gas? I mean, sure, people know
[3:54:53.200 --> 3:54:58.560]  they're crooks and liars, but they don't seem to care. Do they run out of gas in places like Iran?
[3:54:58.560 --> 3:55:02.480]  Do they really think they could overthrow it staging that thing or was it just meant to
[3:55:02.480 --> 3:55:09.840]  demonize Iran ahead of Israeli military strikes? What do you see there? I think this was a semi-
[3:55:09.840 --> 3:55:15.520]  serious, halfway serious and maybe totally serious attempt to have a people power coup,
[3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:21.040]  color revolution, velvet revolution, post-modern coup, as I say in my book about Obama the post-modern
[3:55:21.040 --> 3:55:26.480]  coup. However, it's failed. Now, I think what you're going to see there is Ahmadinejad is
[3:55:26.480 --> 3:55:31.760]  something like a soldier or a secret police guy. He's like Putin in some ways, not as smart,
[3:55:31.760 --> 3:55:37.840]  but the big problem he's got is these moulas or an albatross. You know, there are albatross around
[3:55:37.840 --> 3:55:42.320]  his neck. The moulas are bad news. The moulas are the people who send out the morality police
[3:55:42.320 --> 3:55:46.320]  to harass women in the streets. I think now that a lot of the moulas have turned against
[3:55:46.320 --> 3:55:51.840]  Ahmadinejad, he might say, look, let's dump the moulas, let's go to a straight bureaucratic
[3:55:51.840 --> 3:55:58.880]  authoritarian state where we won't come and try to harass you for wearing headscarves or not,
[3:55:58.880 --> 3:56:03.200]  or whatever, you know, whatever other stuff they try to enforce with these morality police,
[3:56:03.200 --> 3:56:06.320]  and that he would get then a new kind of stability as well.
[3:56:06.320 --> 3:56:10.720]  Let me stop you quickly. We're almost out of time. Are you saying CIA clearly involved bringing
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:16.480]  idolatry? Yeah, sure. And now it's the moulas. In the last minute, the big thing is China,
[3:56:16.480 --> 3:56:21.280]  right? This thing in China, this is huge. China, that's a superpower. They have real nukes.
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:27.200]  This is all run from here in Washington. It's this woman, Rabiya Khadir, right? This is
[3:56:27.920 --> 3:56:34.880]  the World Weakure Congress of Rabiya Khadir. So that blow-up we just saw was staged or
[3:56:34.880 --> 3:56:40.400]  so. Absolutely staged. They get $550,000 from Project Democracy under Richard
[3:56:40.400 --> 3:56:46.400]  Gebhart. They did it a year ago with the Turkestan Islamic Party. They had bombings going on.
[3:56:46.400 --> 3:56:52.480]  That wouldn't fly because the head of it was this Commander Syef, and he was an ugly sort of
[3:56:52.480 --> 3:56:57.600]  al-Qaeda figure at some kind of a bin Laden. Now they have this Pasionaria, this woman,
[3:56:57.600 --> 3:57:04.880]  Rabiya Khadir, who staged, she called into the place, alerted her organization.
[3:57:04.880 --> 3:57:09.920]  They had a clash in the factory on the 26th of June, and then they blew it up on the 5th of
[3:57:09.920 --> 3:57:18.240]  July. Now, the cyber attacks on the U.S. and South Korea are the retaliation by China, saying
[3:57:18.240 --> 3:57:26.160]  you interfere in Finchang, in Chinese Turkestan. We have an even cheaper and more deniable way
[3:57:26.160 --> 3:57:31.280]  to come back at you, and that could get to be huge. In other words, if the U.S. doesn't back off
[3:57:31.280 --> 3:57:37.040]  and stop this constant meddling and interference, then the Chinese retaliation in the Internet
[3:57:37.040 --> 3:57:42.320]  could become very, very serious. I mean, I know the West is there, but you're saying
[3:57:42.320 --> 3:57:47.920]  while they're asking China to hold the T-bills and prop us up, they're busy staging. We know
[3:57:47.920 --> 3:57:53.920]  they didn't do that. Absolutely. It all comes from the U.S. It's this woman, and it's all
[3:57:53.920 --> 3:57:58.960]  documented. You can go to the Xinhua New China News Agency. They have a whole tape where they
[3:57:58.960 --> 3:58:03.360]  explain what it is. No, no, I know about it. I just didn't know this latest. It just never ends.
[3:58:03.360 --> 3:58:09.520]  Webster, amazing interview as usual. Both your books available on Obama at infowars.com. Suggest
