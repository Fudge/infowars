[00:00.000 --> 00:27.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, as we look out at the week before us, I cannot describe to you the
[00:27.720 --> 00:33.240]  amount of excitement I have in my heart. We are seeing the criminals that have hijacked
[00:33.240 --> 00:41.560]  this nation and that have been preying on the American people be exposed on a minute
[00:41.560 --> 00:51.000]  by minute basis. And as the curtain is pulled back, just be prepared for absolute nightmares
[00:51.000 --> 01:04.200]  to be discovered. The establishment are solace, Satanist, child molesters, sadist, mercenaries,
[01:04.200 --> 01:12.520]  scum, dishonorable trash, and zucker of CNN. He should be hauled up on criminal charges
[01:12.520 --> 01:20.200]  of sedition, racketeering, creating false narratives, remove an elected sitting president.
[01:20.200 --> 01:25.480]  It's called espionage. Espionage carried out at the behest of the multinational combines
[01:25.480 --> 01:32.280]  that are so ruthless, so ruthless in their ivory towers in London and Paris and New York
[01:32.280 --> 01:37.040]  and other areas like Los Angeles, they believe they're invincible. This is a big broadcast
[01:37.040 --> 01:41.640]  today coming up live with David Knight. And because the news is so huge, I was going to
[01:41.640 --> 01:45.200]  take a few days off of my children, really a stay case, going to take care of errands
[01:45.200 --> 01:49.320]  and things like that. I'm going to go ahead and still come in. Knight will host most of
[01:49.320 --> 01:53.480]  the broadcast, but I'm going to pop in and also take some special reports just because
[01:53.480 --> 01:58.040]  of the magnitude of the history we're all witnessing unfold right now.
[01:58.040 --> 02:04.280]  The CNN fake news coming out that's on infowars.com from O'Keeffe, catching them red-handed, admitting
[02:04.280 --> 02:09.160]  that they're engaged in fraud, lying to their viewers to start a war with Russia is just
[02:09.160 --> 02:14.440]  spectacular. We already know this, but just to see it coming out and then the other CNN
[02:14.440 --> 02:18.360]  fake news stories on Russia that they've had to pull back from last week where it's totally
[02:18.360 --> 02:24.160]  made up, the whole thing's disintegrating. Now that's the good news. The bad news is
[02:24.160 --> 02:27.480]  the globalists aren't going to give up and they're trying to get Trump to start a war
[02:27.480 --> 02:32.440]  in Syria right now. And I've been warning of it. Sy Hersh is warning of it. David Knight's
[02:32.440 --> 02:37.080]  about to break it all down. So here is that David Knight. And then I've got another tape
[02:37.080 --> 02:42.240]  report I did earlier this morning, but I wanted to pop in first to just point out that history
[02:42.240 --> 02:47.440]  is happening right now in front of our faces and where I'm confident and I'm very excited.
[02:47.440 --> 02:51.000]  So we have to understand the enemy's going to strike back. We should all be brainstorming.
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.120]  How is the enemy going to strike back? That is the big question for all infowars. But
[02:55.120 --> 03:00.200]  know this, ladies and gentlemen, look how far we've already come together. That's why
[03:00.200 --> 03:03.920]  they're coming after infowars because they're coming after you. That's why we need your
[03:03.920 --> 03:08.200]  prayers and support now more than ever because the enemy is striking back and trying to punish
[03:08.200 --> 03:14.640]  anyone that dare expose them. That's why this is a death battle. This is a no holds barred,
[03:14.640 --> 03:20.800]  toe-to-toe, no quarter given, none taken. It's the globalists even call it a death battle.
[03:20.800 --> 03:26.440]  This is a battle of ideologies. This is a battle of good and evil. Look at how they're
[03:26.440 --> 03:29.600]  allied with orthodox Islam. That's all you need to know about these globalists. Look
[03:29.600 --> 03:33.040]  at how they want to sexualize children. Look at everything they do. They are the scum of
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.200]  the earth. They are a cult of bullies and their system's coming down. All right, ladies
[03:37.200 --> 03:39.320]  and gentlemen, back to David Knight live in studio.
[03:39.320 --> 03:43.640]  All right. And that's Alex Jones. And he's going to be joining us with a further report
[03:43.640 --> 03:49.160]  after the break on this Tuesday, June 27th, 2017. I'm here in the studio and of course
[03:49.160 --> 03:54.840]  we have this breaking CNN story essentially leading us to the brink of war with Russia
[03:54.840 --> 04:00.000]  so that they can get higher ratings. Very cynical manipulation. We all know Operation
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.760]  Mockingbird while folks it is full on. And I think one of the most interesting things
[04:03.760 --> 04:08.360]  we're going to play James O'Keeffe's revelations and of course the last couple of days. We
[04:08.360 --> 04:13.620]  talked about this yesterday. This fake story that broke down with CNN. Now three people
[04:13.620 --> 04:20.520]  have been fired or have left depending on how you view this from CNN. It's had massive
[04:20.520 --> 04:27.120]  repercussions even within CNN itself. We've had Brian Stelter who was told by Jeff Zuckerberg
[04:27.120 --> 04:32.960]  that they basically stonewalled this. And now we have Jeff Zuckerberg of course saying
[04:32.960 --> 04:37.480]  viewers trust CNN more than ever. I guess that's a relative. I guess that's a relative
[04:37.480 --> 04:41.320]  thing. I never trusted them. You should never trust any news source. You should look at
[04:41.320 --> 04:46.600]  it. Think for yourself. And the amazing thing about all this is how silent the mainstream
[04:46.600 --> 04:50.880]  media is. Absolutely no news on it. But we're going to have that news so stay with us. Be
[04:50.880 --> 04:59.880]  right back.
[04:59.880 --> 05:05.080]  The struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues. You've had the current counsel for the plaintiffs
[05:05.080 --> 05:10.560]  request that the judge provide witness protection. That notion was rejected despite three mysterious
[05:10.560 --> 05:15.600]  deaths of potential witnesses in the case. Seth Rich, Sean Lucas and Barrington Wison
[05:15.600 --> 05:19.520]  and Junior. There are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this
[05:19.520 --> 05:25.040]  case dropped entirely. Despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has had over the
[05:25.040 --> 05:29.240]  course of the last two years. While the lawsuit represents Bernie Sanders supporters who feel
[05:29.240 --> 05:34.800]  they have been wronged by the DNC. Bernie Sanders has fallen silent on the issue. Donald
[05:34.800 --> 05:38.320]  Trump tweeted out this weekend Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in order
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.960]  to beat crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to collude? Unfair to Bernie. So now Donald
[05:42.960 --> 05:46.880]  Trump has done more to raise awareness for the DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie Sanders
[05:46.880 --> 05:51.560]  has who actually is the one that had the election stolen from him. Why is Bernie Sanders silent
[05:51.560 --> 05:57.080]  on the issue? Maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated by the FBI for bank fraud.
[05:57.080 --> 06:02.040]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer. We've taken thousands of years of known research
[06:02.040 --> 06:07.160]  and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best
[06:07.160 --> 06:11.360]  systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing
[06:11.360 --> 06:17.440]  Z Shield. Toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA. It's filled
[06:17.440 --> 06:21.840]  with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the
[06:21.840 --> 06:27.000]  body and it supports the Info War. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.640]  I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to
[06:31.640 --> 06:36.360]  perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You want to yourself,
[06:36.360 --> 06:40.200]  you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[06:40.200 --> 06:45.920]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need
[06:45.920 --> 06:50.800]  you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy
[06:50.800 --> 06:54.920]  and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing
[06:54.920 --> 06:59.520]  the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield at InfowarsLive.com.
[06:59.520 --> 07:04.400]  A new shipment of Biotrucelinium is now available at InfowarsLive.com. We've been sold out for
[07:04.400 --> 07:10.200]  months. Our one-of-a-kind Infowars Life Biotrucelinium formula is now back in stock at InfowarsLive.com.
[07:10.200 --> 07:13.840]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its
[07:13.840 --> 07:18.840]  core. Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium,
[07:18.840 --> 07:24.600]  but Biotrucelinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed. The effects of
[07:24.600 --> 07:28.920]  the essential trace mineral selenium are well known. From supporting the thyroid gland and
[07:28.920 --> 07:34.280]  immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrucelinium is also the perfect supercharger
[07:34.280 --> 07:38.960]  to survival shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other
[07:38.960 --> 07:44.080]  systems. Visit InfowarsLive.com to order your bottle of Biotrucelinium before we sell out
[07:44.080 --> 07:48.560]  again. That's InfowarsLive.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't
[07:48.560 --> 07:52.560]  only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist,
[07:52.560 --> 07:56.520]  A360WIN. We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight. This is the time to support
[07:56.520 --> 08:08.680]  Infowars. That's InfowarsLive.com. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex
[08:08.680 --> 08:20.480]  Jones. I know you're busy, but now here's a surprise. There's a lot to be thankful for right now. We've
[08:20.480 --> 08:27.040]  seen the Supreme Court nine to zero backup President Trump and override activist ninth and
[08:27.040 --> 08:34.680]  fourth circuit courts that engaged in judicial tyranny by the very definition just declaring
[08:34.680 --> 08:40.640]  the law no one void a law that five year olds could easily understand. The Constitution applies
[08:40.640 --> 08:47.040]  to U.S. citizens and the president has the right to block dangerous individuals from any nation he
[08:47.040 --> 08:55.360]  chooses. The law is cutting dry. That's a big victory because it reverses a tide of judicial
[08:55.360 --> 09:03.480]  tyranny of judicial activism of judicial berserking that has seen the ninth circuit and others rule
[09:03.480 --> 09:10.080]  that you can't wear American flags in public schools in California because they're hurtful to
[09:10.080 --> 09:16.800]  others. That is the level of judicial activism we're talking about. And that ties in with
[09:16.800 --> 09:24.920]  Eric Trump and I've been posted others with straight faces reporting on his short haircut
[09:24.920 --> 09:30.840]  short haircut on the sides kind of an aviator style haircut that you see soccer players and
[09:30.840 --> 09:38.360]  others with trying to tie it together with Hitler and other quote white nationalist. Now those of
[09:38.360 --> 09:43.640]  us that aren't completely mentally ill laugh at that. But you have to understand they're
[09:43.640 --> 09:50.880]  dumbing the political currency down with the public to the point where people aren't aware of
[09:50.880 --> 09:57.200]  major policies where people aren't aware of geopolitical systems. All they're aware of is
[09:57.200 --> 10:06.360]  surface issues. And this is the purest form of racism that we're talking about. And my racism,
[10:06.360 --> 10:14.440]  I mean tribalism. They are dumbing it down to the fact that he has blonde hair and the fact
[10:14.440 --> 10:18.760]  that he has straight hair and the fact that he has blue eyes and the fact that he is a wasp.
[10:18.760 --> 10:26.000]  It doesn't matter if the family marries into Orthodox Jews. It doesn't matter if Donald
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.480]  Trump got awards from the NAACP and Jesse Jackson for hiring record numbers of blacks and putting
[10:32.480 --> 10:37.240]  them in positions of authority when they did a good job. That's how it promotes anybody. None of
[10:37.240 --> 10:44.280]  that history matters. None of it means anything. Because in the final equation, it's about dumbing
[10:44.280 --> 10:50.440]  the debate down to the public. It's so down on the weeds obsessed over what color somebody is or
[10:50.440 --> 10:57.200]  or or racial code words. They don't care that big mega central banks for the last decade have
[10:57.200 --> 11:02.840]  shut down loaning the small businesses and the individuals. They don't then worry about the
[11:02.840 --> 11:09.200]  deindustrialization. They don't worry about Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs making jokes about how
[11:09.200 --> 11:13.760]  China has a better infrastructure than us while he sits there and uses the US military to project
[11:13.760 --> 11:23.040]  power globally. Now all of that said, Trump is in a prime position to make the Democrats a coastal
[11:23.040 --> 11:30.680]  sub-party that is basically after 240 plus years non-existent. There will be other parties that
[11:30.680 --> 11:38.720]  emerge like we've seen with UKIP in Europe and other areas of the world. But that said,
[11:38.720 --> 11:44.840]  the Republicans now are basically in control of most of the states, most of the legislatures,
[11:44.840 --> 11:52.920]  most of the governorships, the House, the Senate, the executive and the judicial. He has not just
[11:52.920 --> 12:00.440]  a trifecta over the three branches of government, but we have as a populist uprising a trifecta
[12:00.440 --> 12:05.360]  throughout the heartland and the rest of the producing nation. And we also see numbers and
[12:05.360 --> 12:10.200]  statistics coming in where, quote, minorities who are really the majority want the birthright of
[12:10.200 --> 12:14.480]  private property, prosperity and a second amendment. They know America's not perfect,
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.920]  it's had its problems, but they want to focus on the positive because of the internet and because
[12:19.920 --> 12:23.200]  of travel because of the military. A lot of people have been around the world and they
[12:23.200 --> 12:30.960]  realize America's got its problems, but it's the best house in a bad neighborhood because this
[12:30.960 --> 12:35.800]  planet is going into major crises and we need to come together and we've got any shot at the
[12:35.800 --> 12:40.880]  future. Come together around real policies, real prosperity, real ideas instead of social
[12:40.880 --> 12:47.880]  distortion, globalist think tank propaganda that's produced by the big foundations and then passed
[12:47.880 --> 12:56.320]  out through the CIA, through other agencies and through MSM. This is weaponized, it's declassified,
[12:56.320 --> 13:01.880]  it's a fact. I mean, people are saying that James O'Keeffe has now killed CNN and I agree,
[13:01.880 --> 13:06.560]  you can say this is one of the final nails in the coffin, O'Keeffe's amazing. I'm not taking away
[13:06.560 --> 13:11.560]  from O'Keeffe, but it's been all of us, that's you, the listeners, exposing CNN, exposing it as a
[13:11.560 --> 13:17.120]  terrorist organization, exposing it as a group that supports ISIS and Al Qaeda in the air of
[13:17.120 --> 13:23.920]  spring, that overall have really just exposed it as the anti-human, anti-American organization it
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.680]  is, but CNN more than anybody has killed themselves and they are the bellwether of the
[13:29.680 --> 13:35.000]  globalist sinking ship where the propaganda and the lies just don't work anymore. When people do
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.720]  watch it, it's almost like looking back at Sodom and Gomorrah, watch out, you might turn into a
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.880]  tower of salt, but the reason I raise that is the videos up on info wars dot com, it's on
[13:45.880 --> 13:53.080]  prisonplanet.com, it's obviously on dredgereport.com, it's all over Project Veritas' site and it's
[13:53.080 --> 13:58.480]  another Death Star level explosion of the globalist, another huge defeat where the producer,
[13:58.480 --> 14:05.880]  O'Keeffe's got more coming out soon, bragging on hidden video about how they lie to the public
[14:05.880 --> 14:09.600]  and how they scam the public and how they deceive and how they don't have proof of the Russian
[14:09.600 --> 14:14.120]  narrative and the fact that he doesn't even really think it's fair, but he's still there
[14:14.120 --> 14:18.080]  basically bragging about it because he's in that position of power and that's what these
[14:18.080 --> 14:22.560]  people get off on, is keeping you in their box, keeping you in their paradigm, not seeing your
[14:22.560 --> 14:32.200]  mind open up and accelerate past even their intellect. They want to suppress and control the
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.960]  narrative and basically run humanity in a ditch. They're the most selfish, greedy, hateful people
[14:37.960 --> 14:43.920]  you can imagine. I mean we have CNN's own reporters caught over and over again every few days
[14:43.920 --> 14:49.000]  putting out fake stories that are verifiable, you know like the reporters that sit there and say
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.800]  that Trump never went and saw his police in the hospital and stuff like that and then nobody
[14:53.800 --> 14:59.800]  even gets in trouble when they get caught lying over and over and over and over again in the
[14:59.800 --> 15:04.640]  headlines because they think you're not paying attention. I go back to Gruber, that's why they
[15:04.640 --> 15:09.920]  do that. Jonathan Gruber said thank god the public doesn't pay attention and I see them doing this
[15:09.920 --> 15:14.120]  to myself and others with these deceptive headlines where what you see in the headline is not
[15:14.120 --> 15:19.560]  actually in the article. And again I know I'm telling you things that you already know. The
[15:19.560 --> 15:27.000]  key to this is we are reaching the flashpoint critical tipping point moment and the globalists
[15:27.000 --> 15:35.040]  know this and so everybody has to be on their toes and focused because the globalists in these
[15:35.040 --> 15:41.120]  combines realize that their whole planetary program is going under because they themselves
[15:41.120 --> 15:46.080]  mismanaged it. They themselves set it up to consolidate wealth and make people poor and thought
[15:46.080 --> 15:50.120]  they could keep that in the dark. Well of course they can't keep it in the dark with the type of
[15:50.120 --> 15:56.880]  surveillance grids and systems that are two-way streets. So now we have to be in maximum vigilance
[15:56.880 --> 16:02.200]  mode and maximum activity mode in the animating contest of liberty which is exciting and invigorating
[16:02.200 --> 16:09.000]  and empowering and realize in this critical time the empire is going to strike back. They're going
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.800]  to strike back in a big way and we should all be conscious of it and now I get to the negative
[16:13.800 --> 16:19.320]  news but it's positive that we're here and able to cover it and to get ahead of it. I said last
[16:19.320 --> 16:24.800]  week the only way that the Trump-Americana agenda is going to get derailed is going to be from the
[16:24.800 --> 16:29.560]  inside. Again not saying something everybody doesn't already know. The Republican leadership now
[16:29.560 --> 16:36.080]  because of the doddering arrogant out of its mind Nancy Pelosi led Democratic Party the Republican
[16:36.080 --> 16:42.160]  establishment now is the main threat. They are the big final obstacle to be taken down. They've
[16:42.160 --> 16:46.480]  gone along with the fake Russian narrative. They've tried to start World War 3 with Russia. They've
[16:46.480 --> 16:54.200]  worked with CNN and other dinosaur media to sell the hoax that has led the war economy to the edge
[16:54.200 --> 17:00.680]  of World War 3. They are the people leading our planet to the precipice for ratings as the producer
[17:00.680 --> 17:08.160]  says. Think about that. Think about how these individuals think that none of this is ever
[17:08.160 --> 17:13.920]  going to blow back on them. They're so arrogant they openly bragged to people about how they're
[17:13.920 --> 17:18.760]  lying and deceiving the public not thinking that hey you might not want to talk about this type
[17:18.760 --> 17:23.720]  of criminal activity in front of people if you're actually doing it but again that's what makes
[17:23.720 --> 17:30.360]  them so dangerous and so now let's look at the Republican establishment. Nikki Haley is way in
[17:30.360 --> 17:45.400]  over her head. She comes off like a inward-looking nincompoop who is on some type of weird existential
[17:45.400 --> 17:51.920]  power trip and again it's this image just like with Obama of women who've never been in the
[17:51.920 --> 17:56.920]  military and never killed anybody or never even probably been in a fist fight throwing their
[17:56.920 --> 18:03.240]  weight around it's just an archetypal image that just speaks of destruction speaks of failed
[18:03.240 --> 18:11.080]  enterprises speaks of destruction of civilization and you've got her sending out this twisted
[18:11.080 --> 18:18.000]  tweet yesterday that we'll put up on screen where she tells the Russians if anything else happens
[18:18.000 --> 18:26.400]  in Syria it's going to be blamed on the Syrian government Assad Russia and or Iran that completely
[18:26.400 --> 18:33.080]  signals just as the British ambassador to Syria said on the BBC a few months ago to the rebels
[18:33.080 --> 18:37.920]  that are about to collapse the ISIS and al Qaeda forces that are militaries on a great job crushing
[18:37.920 --> 18:44.520]  now that Trump let them off the leash it sends a signal to them now is the time to stage another
[18:44.520 --> 18:49.360]  chemical attack they got caught four years ago doing it they got caught three years ago doing
[18:49.360 --> 18:54.360]  it they got caught a year ago doing it even our own government even our own military even the UN
[18:54.360 --> 18:58.680]  has come out and said his quote of the rebels launching this bill to bring the United States in
[18:58.680 --> 19:05.680]  and now the only way Trump can basically destroy himself and us is letting the globalist manipulate
[19:05.680 --> 19:11.560]  him through their final backup plan which is always war and you have Nikki Haley who
[19:11.560 --> 19:17.560]  meets with Ivanka Trump and meets with Pence yesterday and then puts out this tweet saying
[19:17.560 --> 19:22.120]  if anything happens it's your fault and we're going to hit you and this is after we've seen
[19:22.120 --> 19:29.920]  Russian aircraft flown by Syrians shot down we've seen armored columns bombed we've seen the airbase
[19:29.920 --> 19:34.640]  hit that's three strikes that the Russians have put up with now they're saying you fly into the
[19:34.640 --> 19:40.240]  airspace we're going to shoot you down so now we're in a game of brinksmanship with Russia that
[19:40.240 --> 19:46.280]  could trigger a larger war at any time and you've got the neocons and the John McCain's of the
[19:46.280 --> 19:55.800]  world in their cheerleading and pushing for Trump to launch a wider war and that's the way the
[19:55.800 --> 20:02.120]  globalist always try to get us back under control into their system so now is the time for everybody
[20:02.120 --> 20:05.760]  to be calm the White House everybody to be tweeting at the president everybody to be sending out
[20:05.760 --> 20:10.440]  info wars.com articles everybody to be sending this audio and this video out to the president because
[20:10.440 --> 20:15.360]  he does listen to the people and back about two months ago when they tried to launch that last
[20:15.360 --> 20:20.680]  big war Trump came out and said look we're not going to have boots on the ground we're not removing
[20:20.680 --> 20:26.280]  Assad but his own advisors like McMaster and others were on the news saying that they were
[20:26.280 --> 20:32.760]  going to remove Assad and the ISIS and Al Qaeda rebels so again Trump is one man trying to manage
[20:32.760 --> 20:38.320]  this giant system and he needs our support and he needs us to keep them honest as Stephen Bannon
[20:38.320 --> 20:45.000]  has said so that we raise the alarms as watchmen and women and modern Paul Revere's on the wall so
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.880]  again there's an article out by Cy Hurst today it's up on info wars.com where he points out that
[20:50.880 --> 20:56.560]  how Trump got manipulated across that red line with the chemical weapons a few months ago and
[20:56.560 --> 21:01.560]  clearly that was strategic to look strong get the neocons office back the Russians understood what
[21:01.560 --> 21:06.840]  that was but now there have been other aircraft shot down there have been armored columns blown up
[21:06.840 --> 21:12.560]  that are battling ISIS and clearly there are internal groups in our military it's infiltrated
[21:12.560 --> 21:18.280]  like everything else that are trying to start a wider war right now that's with Russia the very
[21:18.280 --> 21:22.200]  last country we want to get into fight with ladies and gentlemen they're not involved in our
[21:22.200 --> 21:26.520]  internal politics that's been proven I mean everybody's involved some but nothing compared
[21:26.520 --> 21:30.840]  to China and they're not the enemy they're a Christian nation that's rebuilding they've got
[21:30.840 --> 21:36.200]  massive resources we should be in business with Russia not having continual conflict with them
[21:36.200 --> 21:41.280]  because a bunch of neocons and a bunch of neo-libs want to play with the whole planet like it's a
[21:41.280 --> 21:47.160]  grand chessboard it's emblematic that as the tide of globalism goes out you see David Rockefeller
[21:47.160 --> 21:52.160]  dying this year you see Brazilian Brzezinski I think you're gonna see other top globalists die
[21:52.160 --> 21:56.480]  this year because it's all emblematic of the great turning and the great change that is taking
[21:56.480 --> 22:05.840]  place right now but understand this she 100% signaled another demon in a red dress to the
[22:05.840 --> 22:13.040]  world as the US ambassador to the UN she signaled just like Samantha Powers and others did a few
[22:13.040 --> 22:19.560]  years ago the exact same neocon policy but said even stronger language anything happens it's your
[22:19.560 --> 22:26.440]  fault that is belligerent that is out of control Syria as a sovereign nation Russia was invited
[22:26.440 --> 22:30.560]  in there our own military came to it since this five years ago and told Obama we're not gonna back
[22:30.560 --> 22:35.360]  al-Qaeda going into Syria in the civil war we're not gonna be their air force so then the media
[22:35.360 --> 22:40.560]  changed the name to ISIS to confuse the public but it didn't the public now understands it's the
[22:40.560 --> 22:46.080]  same people colonel Shaffer's exposed this on the broadcast he's brief Congress and secret on these
[22:46.080 --> 22:51.600]  issues and we broke all of this four plus years ago before anybody else had it and I'm only pointing
[22:51.600 --> 22:56.640]  out that's why they call us fake news is they are so angry the criminal elements the CIA and others
[22:56.640 --> 23:01.200]  and the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation and the and the board of governors of
[23:01.200 --> 23:07.120]  the FCC have all openly said they hate us because we're putting out narratives that are true remember
[23:07.120 --> 23:12.880]  that big Google contract a few months ago that they admit it was real millions of dollars for
[23:12.880 --> 23:19.440]  subcontractor companies to go in and delist info wars is real news and say it's fake and vote it
[23:19.440 --> 23:24.120]  down they didn't change their algorithm they artificially go out into the public to manipulate
[23:24.120 --> 23:28.040]  it from without cuz if they manipulate the algorithm it blinds Google so they didn't do
[23:28.040 --> 23:32.120]  that out of goodness they they did that out of keeping their algorithm real but they went and
[23:32.120 --> 23:35.600]  artificially manipulated the algorithm from the outside they don't take her with the central
[23:35.600 --> 23:41.320]  algorithm they just manipulate the algorithm from the outside and it's set in there remember it's
[23:41.320 --> 23:49.640]  set in there debt look he changed you know the course of the whole Syria thing he had Ron Paul on and
[23:49.640 --> 23:54.560]  he had these other people on and and and they're not credible to speak on this issue well the Ron
[23:54.560 --> 24:00.160]  Paul was quoting the UN that's what's crazy it was because it was credible and we were showing
[24:00.160 --> 24:04.600]  examples from four years ago and two years ago and three years ago when they got caught staging
[24:04.600 --> 24:11.960]  the chemical attacks when the rebels got caught so it was because of that that they put out a
[24:11.960 --> 24:17.080]  contract to delist us they don't put contracts out over quote fake news that's what CNN is they put
[24:17.080 --> 24:21.680]  out to make a Kelly contract on us and all these contracts out to try to discredit us and brand us
[24:21.680 --> 24:26.680]  as fraud because well they know we're real and we're building an effective opposition to the
[24:26.680 --> 24:32.520]  globalist that's based on moral free market Christian open society values I don't mean
[24:32.520 --> 24:36.800]  George Soros is open society everything with them again is a counterfeit real open free
[24:36.800 --> 24:42.440]  societies for folks that want to be an open real Renaissance free societies now David Knight is

[24:58.240 --> 25:03.680]  reaching out to these brainwashed liberals they mean well their whole identity is basically been
[25:03.680 --> 25:09.600]  put into a lie all of us have got to work harder and harder at not laughing at them and and not
[25:09.600 --> 25:13.080]  being as mean to them even though it's it's hard not to do when they're calling for our deaths
[25:13.080 --> 25:19.360]  because you have to understand these are cult victims that have to be somehow deprogrammed and
[25:19.360 --> 25:25.240]  this is serious business they've been under serious hardcore mind control to now where they see you
[25:25.240 --> 25:30.200]  know the same haircut that Beckham has the soccer player on on on Eric Trump they flip out I mean
[25:30.200 --> 25:34.920]  this is devastating mind control where they can't even see an American flag without crapping
[25:34.920 --> 25:38.840]  themselves and then the government the media they're catering to it feeding under the mental
[25:38.840 --> 25:44.840]  illness trying to normalize this this is all done by design globally back to David Knight info

[26:34.200 --> 26:37.840]  and that was Alex Jones breaking this down I'm David Knight here in the studio on this Tuesday
[26:37.840 --> 26:45.200]  June 27th 2017 Alex is breaking down how very important what is happening in Syria is right
[26:45.200 --> 26:49.760]  now we have to understand that the Trump White House is divided we have McMaster who came in
[26:49.760 --> 26:55.440]  and replaced Flynn and we have an interesting article again from circa they're the people who
[26:55.440 --> 27:02.000]  went in and took a look at the FISA court pointing out that the FBI had violated the law in terms
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.440]  of coming after individuals unmasking them using the NSA for these purposes now it goes a little
[27:07.440 --> 27:14.040]  bit deeper we find out that the FBI has retaliated apparently against Michael Flynn he had taken the
[27:14.040 --> 27:22.640]  side of somebody who had a sexual discrimination lawsuit against then number two FBI director
[27:22.640 --> 27:29.080]  Andrew McCabe who is now acting FBI director and it was two years after that that they came
[27:29.080 --> 27:33.480]  after Michael Flynn now what happened with that as Michael Flynn left and he was replaced by
[27:33.480 --> 27:40.080]  McMasters somebody who had worked closely with Petraeus somebody who was committed to regime
[27:40.080 --> 27:46.800]  change just like Nikki Haley that's when we had the attack and supposedly in response to a
[27:46.800 --> 27:51.880]  certain gas attack and of course the Seymour Seymour Hirsch article exposes how that is false
[27:51.880 --> 27:55.040]  we're going to take a look at that we're going to take a look at what Nikki Haley is doing we're
[27:55.040 --> 28:01.680]  also going to take a look of course at CNN this implosion that we're seeing here at CNN it was a
[28:01.680 --> 28:07.440]  couple of weeks ago that we had the Megan Kelly thing we saw the duplicity the lies the targeted
[28:07.440 --> 28:12.840]  destruction of the mainstream media targeted at Alex Jones and he exposed that with what he
[28:12.840 --> 28:18.600]  recorded in terms of the pre-interview discussions that they had now we have video that is surfaced
[28:18.600 --> 28:25.080]  from Project Veritas from James O'Keefe showing people inside CNN talking about how this is
[28:25.080 --> 28:30.960]  absolute BS that was his words he spelled it out for you I'm not going to do it on air pointing
[28:30.960 --> 28:36.520]  out how it is absolute BS he said there's no evidence here of any of this something that we
[28:36.520 --> 28:42.520]  all know but they're doing it for business purposes talking about how Zooker is saying okay great you
[28:42.520 --> 28:46.200]  guys reported on this climate change stuff but let's get back to Russia that's where the money is a
[28:46.200 --> 28:51.360]  very cynical effort to manipulate information and a key part of this I think when I was starting
[28:51.360 --> 28:57.640]  to look at this today as I surveyed the mainstream news sources I found it very interesting there
[28:57.640 --> 29:04.080]  was absolutely nothing about CNN's fake Russian news narrative or retractions or firings or the
[29:04.080 --> 29:10.680]  stonewalling even within CNN you have a reporter Brian Stelter who says what's going on and he
[29:10.680 --> 29:14.480]  gets shut down and of course they came back and said we're not going to have any more stories about
[29:14.480 --> 29:18.200]  Russia until he gets approved at the vice presidential level and then we had these firings that
[29:18.200 --> 29:22.840]  happened today but there was absolutely nothing about it on Reuters nothing about it on the
[29:22.840 --> 29:27.160]  Guardian nothing about it on the Wall Street Journal nothing about it of course on CNN except
[29:27.160 --> 29:32.160]  they had a feature where Don Lemon was scolding the media for not standing up to the White House
[29:32.160 --> 29:38.120]  Washington Post nothing at all about it they simply complained and whined about the fact
[29:38.120 --> 29:42.080]  that they didn't have cameras at the White House press briefing we're gonna talk about that as
[29:42.080 --> 29:48.840]  well the self-absorbed posturing media represented by Gemma Costa at the White House press conference
[29:48.840 --> 29:55.280]  they will be right back the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:55.280 --> 30:04.880]  the struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues you've had the current counsel for the plaintiffs
[30:04.880 --> 30:10.600]  request that the judge provide witness protection that notion was rejected despite three mysterious
[30:10.600 --> 30:16.160]  deaths of potential witnesses in the case Seth Rich Sean Lucas and Barrington Wison and Junior
[30:16.160 --> 30:20.760]  there are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this case dropped entirely
[30:20.760 --> 30:26.320]  despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has had over the course of the last two years
[30:26.320 --> 30:30.600]  while the lawsuit represents Bernie Sanders supporters who feel they have been wronged by
[30:30.600 --> 30:36.080]  the DNC Bernie Sanders has fallen silent on the issue Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend
[30:36.080 --> 30:40.360]  Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in order to beat crazy Bernie Sanders is she
[30:40.360 --> 30:44.760]  allowed to collude unfair to Bernie so now Donald Trump has done more to raise awareness for the
[30:44.760 --> 30:49.440]  DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie Sanders has who actually is the one that had the election stolen
[30:49.440 --> 30:55.120]  from him why is Bernie Sanders silent on the issue maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated
[30:55.120 --> 31:01.080]  by the FBI for bank fraud for info wars.com this is Owen shroyer it's not just our water we need

[33:25.880 --> 33:30.760]  internal admission that they caught on tape that they know that this is false they don't
[33:30.760 --> 33:34.960]  believe any of this stuff they're simply doing it because they think it's good business for them
[33:34.960 --> 33:39.960]  they're feeding people what they want to hear their confirmation bias and they're willing to
[33:39.960 --> 33:45.520]  lie to you about that of course this is nothing new but it is new to hear them say it on camera
[33:45.520 --> 33:51.120]  and this is all part of the implosion that began at the end of last week and we're going to talk
[33:51.120 --> 33:55.240]  about that we're gonna talk about what's going on in syria very serious there we also have
[33:55.240 --> 34:00.800]  articles about chef joe arpaio he had a trial began yesterday they're trying to essentially bring
[34:00.800 --> 34:06.640]  criminal charges against him for obeying the immigration law we had obama say we're not
[34:06.640 --> 34:11.440]  going to enforce immigration law we're not going to allow the border patrol to enforce immigration
[34:11.440 --> 34:17.360]  law you better not do that chef joe was detaining people and turning them over to federal agents

[34:21.520 --> 34:28.720]  i went to a meeting here in austin where the democrats were furious at the black sheriff
[34:28.720 --> 34:35.200]  that was there they were all over him saying how dare you turn over criminals to immigration
[34:35.200 --> 34:39.840]  control and of course he was voted out of office and they put in this lady who said i'm not going
[34:39.840 --> 34:46.400]  to turn anybody over except for three crimes and then one of those crimes was not a sexual assault
[34:46.400 --> 34:52.240]  or sexual crimes and she said okay four crimes four crimes is like uh money pythons uh spanish
[34:52.240 --> 34:56.000]  inquisition we're going to go for three no make that four make that five is that people started
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.560]  pointing out but you're letting violent criminals go and not turning them over but that's what's
[35:00.560 --> 35:05.760]  here if joe arpaio was doing and a judge then in addition to the president saying we're not going
[35:05.760 --> 35:10.320]  to enforce immigration laws we had a judge say you better not enforce immigration laws they
[35:10.320 --> 35:14.320]  continued to do that and now they're coming out to him for criminal charges and it's very
[35:14.320 --> 35:20.480]  interesting because the justice department under attorney general uh loretta lynch and we
[35:20.480 --> 35:25.120]  heard all of this stuff from james comey saying well let's just call this a matter because we
[35:25.120 --> 35:29.520]  don't want to interfere with an election and james comey said i did the things that i did because
[35:29.520 --> 35:34.640]  i didn't want to interfere with election but they went after joe sheriff joe arpaio because they
[35:34.640 --> 35:38.880]  wanted to interfere with the election and they did it in a way to interfere with the election but
[35:38.880 --> 35:45.360]  they're not content with that they want to put this 85 year old man in jail and he is asking for
[35:45.360 --> 35:49.520]  jeff sessions to testify he's asking for them to do things and quite frankly jeff sessions
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.320]  ought to just shut down this investigation if he had any integrity he would do that he should do that
[35:54.320 --> 36:00.880]  this is an outrage that the justice department would continue on with this show trial taking
[36:00.880 --> 36:06.000]  somebody who is in law enforcement and trying to put them in jail because they enforce the law
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.680]  that the president and a judge said we're not going to enforce the law we're going to act as
[36:09.680 --> 36:13.920]  tyrants the law is in my mouth i'm going to shut this down anybody tries to enforce this law
[36:13.920 --> 36:18.960]  we're going to come after you we also have uh coming up in the second hour we have uh john
[36:18.960 --> 36:24.240]  kiriyaku he is a cia whistleblower on torture he was the one who exposed exposed what was going
[36:24.240 --> 36:28.720]  on there he actually went to jail for that he has a book called the convenient terrace and quite
[36:28.720 --> 36:33.600]  frankly it does tells quite well with what we're seeing in terms of this false narrative
[36:33.600 --> 36:39.040]  coming out of syria where there are elements within the trump administration pushing for war
[36:39.040 --> 36:44.880]  nicky hailey mcmaster there are other people like mattis who wants to fight isis he says we're not
[36:44.880 --> 36:49.760]  there for regime change we're going to fight isis but there is within the national security council
[36:49.760 --> 36:56.160]  under mcmaster they are pushing very hard for everything that they can in order to create a
[36:56.160 --> 37:02.640]  very very dangerous war and we need to as trump supporters stand with donald trump and remind him
[37:02.640 --> 37:06.880]  because there is this division in his white house just as there was a division with the
[37:06.880 --> 37:11.040]  paris climate treaty there were those who said we need to stay in this there were those who said
[37:11.040 --> 37:15.520]  we need to get out of it and fortunately the people who were saying we need to get out of it
[37:15.520 --> 37:20.240]  they eventually won we need to stand with and behind donald trump to make sure that he does
[37:20.240 --> 37:26.160]  what is right what he campaigned for and that is not to get involved in regime change to create
[37:26.160 --> 37:32.640]  more chaos in the middle east and to bring us to the brink of war with russia very very incredibly
[37:32.640 --> 37:38.800]  dangerous and irresponsible what nicky hailey is doing as well as mcmaster before i get back to the
[37:38.800 --> 37:44.640]  news and before we play these clips from cnn and the project veritas just want to remind you that
[37:44.640 --> 37:50.240]  we have our fourth of july mega specials are now live at info wars store dot com this is how we fund
[37:50.240 --> 37:55.120]  our operation folks we don't get money from jp morgan they were the ones who said hey you're
[37:55.120 --> 38:00.000]  going to have an interview with alex jones we're going to pull our sponsorship can you imagine
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.680]  if we ever tried to get big pharma or the big banks to sponsor anything that we ever did no
[38:05.680 --> 38:12.240]  you standing with us standing behind us buying these products is what allows us to be an independent
[38:12.240 --> 38:19.760]  media we're independent of other outside financial sources and certainly we're not getting the sponsorship
[38:19.760 --> 38:24.640]  of big banks big pharma big chemical companies interestingly enough and i don't know if we'll
[38:24.640 --> 38:30.160]  have time to get to this today but now we've had more movements against monsanto they're not going
[38:30.160 --> 38:35.360]  to support us they're going to do everything they can to try to silence us but we have this special
[38:35.360 --> 38:41.280]  we have now put it live it is free shipping through the fourth of july weekend as well as massive
[38:41.280 --> 38:45.920]  discounts and a wide variety of products we have brain force plus now 30 percent off super

[38:51.680 --> 39:00.000]  percent off and info wars select storeable food 30 to 40 off retail very important when you look
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.720]  at natural disasters when you look at man-made disasters and even if you look at the volatility
[39:06.720 --> 39:12.400]  of our infrastructure our food supply things that can cause a massive spike or shortage make sure
[39:12.400 --> 39:19.360]  that you have that cushion for your family for yourself that is a storeable it is a high quality
[39:19.360 --> 39:25.360]  made in the usa non-gmo you always then have that backup that cushion against spikes that are going
[39:25.360 --> 39:31.920]  to hit the food supply also emricks essentials outdoor packs 40 off retail and living defense
[39:31.920 --> 39:38.080]  20 off while supplies last again free shipping as part of the fourth of july summer mega special
[39:38.080 --> 39:45.200]  at infowar store dot com all right now we've had more fallout today from the stories that began
[39:45.200 --> 39:52.160]  breaking last week the false news story the latest russian nonsense that was coming out of these
[39:52.160 --> 39:56.960]  people it was the russian investment fund with ties to trump officials that was a cnn story
[39:56.960 --> 40:06.080]  it cited a single anonymous source a single anonymous source where have we seen that before
[40:06.800 --> 40:11.680]  we've seen that before all the time from the washington post all the time from the washington
[40:11.680 --> 40:15.600]  post so it's not really any different from the washington post or maybe we should call it the
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.360]  amazon post and of course that's what donald trump said he says well what about all these other
[40:19.360 --> 40:24.320]  funny stories that they do uh and donald trump jr called this story the biggest fake news scandal
[40:24.320 --> 40:29.680]  in the network's history uh he said that uh donald trump said cnn is looking at big management
[40:29.680 --> 40:35.600]  changes now they got caught falsely pushing their russian stories absolutely and he later on
[40:35.600 --> 40:42.160]  tweeted out so they caught cnn cold but what about mbc cbs abc what about the failing new
[40:42.160 --> 40:48.240]  york times the washington post they're all fake news exactly they're running with anonymous sources
[40:48.240 --> 40:55.040]  it's not anonymous sources who are telling us mc phisa court who's telling us that the fbi
[40:55.760 --> 41:01.360]  violated the law that the nsa violated the law that they engaged in political activity
[41:01.360 --> 41:06.000]  to benefit the obama administration benefit hillary clinton we know that that is the big
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.320]  story folks that is coming but meanwhile let's take a look at these three journalists who are
[41:10.320 --> 41:16.240]  now leaving we reported yesterday that within cnn uh bryan stelter did not get any information
[41:16.240 --> 41:21.440]  they were stonewalling him even within his own organization we've had sean hennedy come out and
[41:21.440 --> 41:27.360]  say that uh cnn's jeff zucker needs to be fired uh he said it's very fake news we've had paul joseph
[41:27.360 --> 41:32.800]  watson say trump must now revoke cnn's white house press credentials tucker carlson says
[41:32.800 --> 41:40.560]  cnn is no longer a news organization absolutely true let's play this clip from project veritas
[41:40.560 --> 41:46.640]  because now in addition to all of this implosion of this story and the aftermath of that that's
[41:46.640 --> 41:53.920]  happened in the last several days at cnn we now have this internal exposure a cnn producer
[41:53.920 --> 42:00.800]  john bonafield who was caught on tape talking about the fact that they know that this is bs
[42:00.800 --> 42:15.360]  here's a clip from the uh project veritas exposure the my cnn constantly like rush at this rush of
[42:15.360 --> 42:22.960]  that this is ratings this ratings our ratings are incredible right now but honestly you think the whole
[42:22.960 --> 42:35.600]  rush is just like bull it's mostly right now like we don't have any big giant proof i just feel like
[42:35.600 --> 42:42.480]  they don't really have it but they they want to keep digging and so i think the president is probably
[42:42.480 --> 42:51.200]  right to say like look you are witch hunting me like you have no smoking gun you have no real
[42:51.200 --> 42:57.680]  proof didn't the ceo of cnn said in our internal meeting he said good job everybody covering the
[42:57.680 --> 43:05.840]  climate accord but we're done with that let's get back to russia wow hear that this is like
[43:05.840 --> 43:10.640]  there's no smoking gun there's no giant proof it's mostly just bs right now and he said we
[43:10.640 --> 43:16.800]  had this meeting and he said good job uh this was uh ceo jeff zucker again uh just to give you
[43:16.800 --> 43:19.920]  some context he said president trump pulled out of the climate accords and for a day and a half
[43:19.920 --> 43:25.920]  we covered the climate accords and the ceo of cnn said in our internal meetings he said good job
[43:25.920 --> 43:30.320]  everybody covering the climate accord but we're done with that let's just get back to russia
[43:30.320 --> 43:36.240]  let's play the next clip on here so you believe like the russia thing is a little crazy right
[43:39.200 --> 43:45.520]  even if russia was trying to swing an election i we try to swing their elections we're in rca
[43:45.520 --> 43:50.400]  and doing it all the time like we're out there trying to manipulate governments like you win
[43:50.400 --> 43:56.480]  because you know the you you know the game then you play it right she didn't play it right the
[43:56.480 --> 44:03.760]  more i cnn constantly like russia does russia that because it's ratings because ratings our
[44:03.760 --> 44:08.960]  ratings are incredible right now in the month of may cnn's ratings were significantly higher than
[44:08.960 --> 44:15.760]  they were the year before the russia story and trump have made cnn millions because of uh yeah i
[44:16.800 --> 44:22.400]  so my boss i shouldn't say this my boss a couple days yesterday we were having a discussion about
[44:22.400 --> 44:27.360]  this dental shoot he goes he's like i just want you to know what we're up against here and he goes
[44:27.360 --> 44:34.080]  just to give you some context president trump pulled out of the climate accords and for a day
[44:34.080 --> 44:39.520]  and a half we covered the climate court and the ceo of cnn said in our internal meeting he said
[44:39.520 --> 44:45.280]  good job everybody covering the climate accords but we're done with that let's get back to russia
[44:46.240 --> 44:55.600]  the ceo yeah oh my god so so even the climate accords he was like okay a day or so but we're
[44:55.600 --> 45:00.720]  we're moving back to russia it's not amazing you know i had an interview last night with a man who
[45:00.720 --> 45:06.640]  wrote a book called the plot to scapegoat russia and it was done from the perspective of like an
[45:06.640 --> 45:10.880]  oliver stone liberal as a matter of fact this guy is basically on the same page as oliver stone
[45:11.840 --> 45:17.120]  not a conservative but they understand they're they're understand what's going on with this
[45:17.120 --> 45:23.280]  phony narrative and we also have a glenn greenwald with the intercept pointing out how they have
[45:23.920 --> 45:29.520]  jumped the shark so many times completely lost their credibility but the man that i was talking
[45:29.520 --> 45:35.040]  to about the uh the the plot to scapegoat russia is not a warmonger he's not somebody who's pushing
[45:35.040 --> 45:40.720]  for war but we have to understand the cynical nature of this and the it's it's about business you're
[45:40.720 --> 45:47.760]  going to hear this in the next clip but it is also a very politicized operation this is not a news
[45:47.760 --> 45:55.200]  organization as i think it was shon kennedy said it's a campaign this is a politicized attack it is
[45:55.200 --> 46:01.360]  operation mockingbird and it is also not just as i point out many times it's not just an offensive
[46:01.360 --> 46:06.720]  attack against donald trump trying to stall his administration trying to entrap him in
[46:06.720 --> 46:13.520]  process crimes but they are also trying to come up with plausible deniability when it comes out
[46:13.520 --> 46:19.040]  that they are the ones who have been hacking into state boards of election it was j johnson at
[46:19.040 --> 46:23.440]  department of homeland security that has been stonewalling congressmen who have asked him
[46:23.440 --> 46:29.760]  about the actions of homeland security violating the law breaking into state boards of election
[46:29.760 --> 46:34.240]  and saying well we need to show that this is critical infrastructure trying to create essentially
[46:34.240 --> 46:39.680]  a panic situation so they can insert themselves into local elections but they are violating the law
[46:40.240 --> 46:46.800]  the fbi the nsa violated the law this is not an anonymous whistleblower this is the faiza court
[46:47.600 --> 46:52.640]  foreign intelligence surveillance act it was created in the wake of the church and the pike
[46:52.640 --> 46:57.920]  hearings from the 1970s because at that time guess what the cia and the nsa were listening to
[46:57.920 --> 47:03.120]  americans illegally that was not a part of what they were created to do they tried to reign them
[47:03.120 --> 47:09.200]  in with the faiza court and then they began using the faiza act as a means to do a dragnet
[47:09.200 --> 47:15.120]  surveillance of mr missus verizon so the court is very upset that these intelligence agencies
[47:15.120 --> 47:19.760]  have been basically operating as political operatives we have chuck grassley senator from
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.960]  iowa saying the same thing trying to get ahead but they're getting stonewalled at all these different
[47:24.960 --> 47:29.920]  operations that is the true story here folks that is the real key how they were used defensively yes
[47:29.920 --> 47:35.120]  they're trying to use uh this as a defensive mechanism they're trying to muddy the water
[47:35.120 --> 47:39.680]  they're trying to help the democrats but it goes beyond just trying to help the democrats
[47:39.680 --> 47:44.160]  after the election they were helping the democrats before the election they were using the intelligence
[47:44.160 --> 47:49.920]  and law enforcement communities in an illegal way and they're very intent on covering that up and
[47:49.920 --> 47:56.320]  so is cnn but then of course here's the obvious part folks it's about the money as well here's
[47:56.320 --> 48:01.440]  what he has to say in the next clip this looks i mean i understand it's all ratings right oh it's
[48:01.440 --> 48:10.880]  a big one it's a business people are like the media has like an ethical but all the nice cutesy
[48:10.880 --> 48:15.840]  little ethics that used to get talked about in journalism school you're just like that's adorable
[48:17.280 --> 48:18.320]  that's adorable
[48:22.400 --> 48:28.480]  especially cable news you know cable news isn't from new york times and it's not it's not even
[48:28.480 --> 48:35.520]  like nbc news it's it's i mean nbc news still it's 20 million viewers a night cable news is getting
[48:35.520 --> 48:45.760]  on billion so um like they gotta they gotta do what they gotta do to make their money i think
[48:47.120 --> 48:53.440]  and so i love that i love the news business but i i find it so i'm very cynical about it
[48:54.480 --> 48:56.400]  at the same time so are most of my colleagues
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.120]  and it's like not alone so he loves the news business and it's strictly about business it's
[49:05.120 --> 49:09.120]  strictly about eyeballs and they will tell anybody anything in order to get eyeballs that's what he's
[49:09.120 --> 49:16.320]  saying and that's true that's what we just saw with megan kelly and it's no different if you're at
[49:16.320 --> 49:22.080]  nbc than it is if you're at cnn or if you're at fox or whatever they will come after people
[49:22.800 --> 49:27.360]  tell lies about them edit this and that's the key thing you have to understand
[49:28.240 --> 49:31.600]  sean hannity came out and said show the entire tape we've got to stop with this
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.640]  uh character assassination with this editing of the uh interviews to get precisely what you want
[49:36.640 --> 49:42.000]  to do hours upon hours of interviews and then you can distill it down to say precisely what you want
[49:42.640 --> 49:48.560]  that is the attack journalism the operation mockingbird the control that has been exercised
[49:48.560 --> 49:55.760]  by the mainstream media and by that i mean nbc abc cbs they were the part of operation mockingbird
[49:55.760 --> 50:00.640]  working with the government working with the ci putting out the narratives the stories that the
[50:00.640 --> 50:06.800]  government wanted and anybody who questioned that was shut down as a conspiracy theorist beginning
[50:06.800 --> 50:12.480]  with the jfk assassination that's when they coined that term they didn't want anybody looking at the
[50:12.480 --> 50:17.920]  independent media it's amazing how when you go back and think about that there was one person
[50:17.920 --> 50:24.320]  with a film recorder that got some independent video and look at the trouble that caused the
[50:24.320 --> 50:31.040]  government with their pat story of about about a patsy with a bolt action rifle taking those three
[50:31.040 --> 50:36.480]  shots from one location behind that created a great deal of problem for them they have been fighting
[50:36.480 --> 50:43.360]  that for 60 years now and and they just can't get past that today we have everybody with cameras
[50:43.360 --> 50:47.760]  they can't win we can talk to each other we can transcend them stay with us we'll be right back

[54:16.080 --> 54:24.640]  june 27th 2017 when you get back to this last clip from the project veritas video i think it's
[54:24.640 --> 54:29.200]  very amazing what he has to say about the witch hunt before we do real quickly i want to remind

[55:13.440 --> 55:18.240]  as we see them and that's the key thing you had zucker come out and say you know people still trust
[55:18.240 --> 55:23.840]  cnn you should never trust a news source just because they say it yeah you can have an experience
[55:23.840 --> 55:27.840]  of people and say yeah okay i verified that that was real i verified that again that's real
[55:27.840 --> 55:33.520]  and then you start to begin to trust an organization but you should always verify every story anybody
[55:33.520 --> 55:39.520]  can make a mistake they can make an honest mistake or they can make dishonest reports as we see here
[55:39.520 --> 55:46.400]  with cnn let's play this last clip here what this guy has to say about president trump being witch
[55:46.400 --> 55:53.840]  hunted i think that there are a lot of like liberal cnn viewers who want to see trump really get
[55:53.840 --> 56:00.640]  scrutinized and i think if we would have behaved that way with president obama and scrutinized
[56:00.640 --> 56:06.880]  everything that he was doing with as much money as we have lied to donald trump i think our viewers
[56:06.880 --> 56:13.120]  would have been turned off i think they would have uh we think we were attacking him but um i think
[56:13.120 --> 56:17.120]  our view is right now and i'm not saying all of our viewers are like super liberals or i think
[56:17.120 --> 56:23.040]  there's just a lot of them and so so trump's good for business you're saying trump is good for
[56:23.040 --> 56:29.920]  business right now but honestly you think the whole rush is just like bullsh** could be bullsh**
[56:29.920 --> 56:39.040]  i mean it's mostly right now like we don't have any big giant proof but then they say well there's
[56:39.040 --> 56:45.040]  still an investigation going on and you're like yeah i don't know if you're finding something here
[56:45.040 --> 56:52.160]  would we know about it the way these leaks happen they'd leak it it leaked if there was something
[56:52.160 --> 57:00.640]  really good it would leak it would elate before uh voting i would say if anything was good out
[57:00.640 --> 57:05.200]  there what it came out already the leaks keep leaking and there's so many great leaks that it's
[57:05.200 --> 57:09.840]  amazing and i just refuse to believe that if they had something really good like that that would
[57:09.840 --> 57:14.000]  have leaked because we've been getting all these other leaks so i just feel like they don't really
[57:14.000 --> 57:21.440]  have it but they they want to keep digging and so i think the president is probably right to say
[57:21.440 --> 57:29.200]  like look you are witch hunting me like you have no smoking gun you have no real proof
[57:30.640 --> 57:34.800]  exactly and we've been saying that for a very long time here's this guy who's a cnn producer
[57:34.800 --> 57:40.160]  telling that to a hidden camera for project veritas uh james o' keith releasing that information
[57:40.160 --> 57:44.720]  we've had Oliver stone say that we had the guy that i interviewed yesterday the plot to scapegoat
[57:44.720 --> 57:49.440]  russia saying that we've been saying that we've said there's absolutely nothing here if there
[57:49.440 --> 57:53.760]  was anything they would have found it by now but there isn't and it's a very dangerous thing to
[57:53.760 --> 57:59.600]  continue to go down this road they're provoking war as assuredly as people like nicky hailey and
[57:59.600 --> 58:05.040]  McMaster are trying to provoke a world war and we have people like glenn greenwald as well talking
[58:05.040 --> 58:09.600]  about the absurdity of this russian narrative he wrote an article came out today cnn journalists
[58:09.600 --> 58:16.080]  resign the latest example of media recklessness in the russia threat and he says they're not alone
[58:16.080 --> 58:21.040]  he says uh quite frankly washington post and you heard this guy say well you know we're just
[58:21.040 --> 58:24.960]  uh we're just cnn there's a big guy's like the washington post in new york times yeah they've
[58:24.960 --> 58:30.480]  been caught doing this as well and we come back from the break i'm gonna read you uh one of the
[58:30.480 --> 58:36.560]  examples from this uh article from the intercept talking about the washington post the relentless
[58:36.560 --> 58:40.800]  pushing of false information even after it's exposed as being false stay with us we'll be right back
[58:40.800 --> 58:45.600]  to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[58:51.040 --> 58:57.520]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war
[58:57.520 --> 59:03.920]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago
[59:03.920 --> 59:10.320]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid
[59:10.320 --> 59:17.280]  sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food
[59:17.280 --> 59:23.600]  and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate
[59:23.600 --> 59:30.800]  our journey towards death i personally counter this onslaught with antroplex antroplex is designed
[59:30.800 --> 59:38.800]  with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[59:38.800 --> 59:43.840]  inside the human body discover why antroplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to
[59:43.840 --> 59:48.960]  take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at info warslife.com with antroplex
[59:48.960 --> 1:00:06.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:06.640 --> 1:00:29.920]  we're gonna be joined in the next segment by cia whistleblower who subsequently went to jail
[1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:35.600]  for exposing criminal actions isn't that the way it always is you expose criminal actions
[1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:39.040]  within the government and it's the whistleblower that goes to jail the people who committed the
[1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:44.080]  criminal actions do not go to jail his name is john kiriyaku he wrote a book with joseph hickman
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:51.840]  called the convenient terrorist and it's another case of a convenient narrative that is being sold
[1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:56.720]  by the mainstream media by the u.s government in order to get what they want essentially a pack of
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:01.440]  lies it'll be a very interesting interview i think it's a very interesting book i want to get to in
[1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:06.480]  this section right here as we're talking about the cnn story this story here from the intercept by
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:11.840]  glenn greenwald he said several factors here are compounding a cnn's embarrassment to begin with
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:16.960]  the story was first debunked by breitbart and by sputnik news they explained that the investment
[1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:22.000]  fund documented several factual inaccuracies in the report they said the fund is not even a part of
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:28.480]  the named russian bank venezia com brink which is under investigation breitbart cited numerous other
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:31.920]  factual inaccuracies so this whole thing started melting down the end of the week
[1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:35.680]  they pulled this thing back and now they have pulled back from russia but they said cnn is
[1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:39.680]  hardly alone and this is the key point folks it's hardly alone when it comes to embarrassing
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:44.720]  retractions regarding russia and then they talk about washington post remember the end of the year
[1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:51.120]  how we had all of this fear mongering about how vladimir putin was attempting to hack our electric
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:56.720]  grid that was a tweet from an msnbc journalist we have other democrat officials doing the same
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:02:02.800]  thing and of course we just had this last week j josen going before congress and saying i know
[1:02:02.800 --> 1:02:08.480]  that vladimir putin personally ordered the attempt hacks into our state boards of election you know
[1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:14.640]  because vladimir putin wants to get those voter rolls in georgia no i don't think so i think it's
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:20.400]  more far more likely that the dnc the people who really did hack the election against bernie sanders
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:25.680]  i think it's far more likely that they want to do it i think it's far more likely that bad actors
[1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:30.960]  in the state bureaucracy or to be able to insinuate themselves in the electronic voting
[1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:37.040]  machines to truly hack the votes to hack the the totals and they're using this they were
[1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:42.640]  they were the ones who were caught red handed trying to break into the georgia uh state election
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:48.560]  information and into the indiana state election we had state secretaries of state get together
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:53.920]  and asked donald trump to shut down homeland security they've asked j johnson for information
[1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:58.720]  about what had happened completely stonewalled them until he came out and had his dog and pony
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:02.480]  shown said it was putin who did it is putin who did it well what were they telling us back in
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:08.400]  december 30th they published this is a washington post published a blockbuster frightening scoop
[1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:13.200]  that immediately and predictably went viral and generated massive traffic remember when this
[1:03:13.200 --> 1:03:19.680]  happened russian hackers the paper claimed based on anonymous sources the favorite source of the
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:24.720]  washington post and the new york times anonymous sources had hacked into the u.s electricity grid
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:30.800]  through a vermont utility what was this in reality well they had not bothered to even contact the
[1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:35.520]  vermont utility when somebody did the vermont utility said well we found a little bit of
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:42.880]  malware on a laptop it was not connected to the vermont grid it was not connected to the u.s
[1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:47.600]  electric grid so then they come out and they double down on this as a washington poaching see
[1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:52.720]  the headline national security russian operation hacked a vermont utility showing risk to us
[1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:58.000]  electrical grid security officials say and then in small letters underneath it an editor's note
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.960]  an earlier version of the story incorrectly said the russian hackers had penetrated the
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:07.040]  us electric grid authorities say there's no indication of that so far so far the computer
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:15.280]  that was hacked was not attached to the grid this is so alarmist so over the top ridiculous
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:21.760]  and yet and he continues to go through this story showing how this story evolved and how
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:30.080]  they continued to try to reluctantly they little bit by little bit they'd let some detail go and
[1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:34.720]  then they would do another story and let another detail go that they had pushed forward falsely
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:40.800]  but still maintaining this fear this false narrative that by this time they well knew was
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:47.600]  not true this is the washington post this is jeff bezos political weapon that he bought for a pittance
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:52.640]  i mean 250 million dollars to jeff bezos that's that's a little that's less than a little stock
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:57.200]  blip on a particular day and that makes him a player in washington stay with us when we come
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:02.960]  back we're going to talk to john kiyaku cia whistleblower wow you're going to love the latest idea
[1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:08.160]  out of the e you scott keller a german member of the european parliament and of the green party
[1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:13.120]  said we should transplant entire villages from syria to germany and that would encourage more
[1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:19.040]  migrants to enter germany listen to these quotes the idea of syrian villages is only one possibility
[1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:24.080]  we can use for example if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees
[1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:29.600]  people would rather go where compatriots already live which makes integration and acceptance easier
[1:05:29.600 --> 1:05:34.720]  let's look at these three compatriots from paul joseph watson sweden migrants viciously beat disabled
[1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:39.360]  man while calling him racist three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's
[1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:43.280]  wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month the handicap man was
[1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:47.360]  kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on
[1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:52.720]  muslims and how all swedes were racist now how's that for acceptance you can read both articles
[1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:58.160]  now on info wars dot com roger reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news

[1:08:45.600 --> 1:08:51.840]  very important for us to come back and look at the official stories that we get from the government
[1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:59.120]  to fact check those stories to sanity check those stories that's why people push back against the
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:05.680]  jfk assassination and that's why the fbi in order to shut that down invented the term conspiracy
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:10.880]  theorists you don't believe that one guy with a bolt action rifle and they pick all those shots
[1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:15.920]  from the back you don't you believe some of those witnesses you believe there's a pruder film you

[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:24.880]  you don't believe the government's official story well let's take a look at the government's official
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:31.040]  story about this syrian chemical attack the latest one you know it's just saying before
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:34.880]  this information came out i was saying to my wife you know one of the things that meghan kelly
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:41.520]  uh asked me you know what is your uh what are the your the stories that you feel the best about
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:45.200]  that you've done here at info wars i said well you know the bundy ranch i think that was a very
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:50.720]  important time to see people standing with their neighbors standing up peacefully and saying we're
[1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:54.640]  not going to take this anymore we're not going to let you take away our property rights we're
[1:09:54.640 --> 1:10:00.720]  not going to let you abuse us illegally without any legal law enforcement authority under color of
[1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:05.600]  law and they did that peacefully and they stood up and said we're just not going to take that anymore
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:12.640]  because you know if you don't have any property rights you are the property you're a slave it's
[1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:19.280]  just that simple but i also told my wife i said you know i'm very proud of the fact that we stood
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:27.120]  up in 2013 when obama was trying to push us into a troops on the ground and becoming al-qaeda's
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:33.360]  air force in syria and we stood up and said i'm sorry uh we're not buying this sarin gas attack
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:39.600]  narrative it was phony and first russia came out and pushed back against it along with syria then
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:44.720]  we had un arms weapons inspectors pushed back against it and eventually we had people within the
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:49.440]  american defense establishment come out and say no that didn't happen and the whole thing got
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:55.440]  shut down this time around it went very quickly and i think the reason for that is because of
[1:10:55.440 --> 1:11:00.000]  being master and the timing of when he joined the administration but we're in a very dangerous
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.680]  situation where are we right now today we've got mbc reporting and we got tweets that are coming out
[1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:13.440]  from uh nicky hailey mbc reports white house warns syria against chemical attack preparations
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:19.120]  don't you even think about it anything goes wrong there we're going to take that as an excuse to attack
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:25.200]  russia to attack syria the united states has spotted quote potential preparations for another
[1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:30.880]  chemical weapons attack unquote by the syrian government said the white house late monday in
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:37.040]  a statement that took some defense and military officials by surprise yes the statement warned
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:42.720]  that syria would pay a heavy price if such an attack proceeds they gave no details of the
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:46.320]  purported preparations of course not of course there's not going to be any details there weren't
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:54.080]  any details that could be analyzed or debunked when they launched the attack those details
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:58.800]  eventually did surface and we did talk about that and we did have former weapons inspectors
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:03.680]  debunked that at the time but by then it was too late and hopefully we're not going to see this
[1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:09.840]  happen again we have to understand how incredibly dangerous these actions that are being taken
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:16.720]  by the us military right now in syria are we are not there folks to fight ices we have been
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:23.600]  arming ices we've been training ices we've been assisting ices and every time ices is about to lose
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:29.200]  to the syrian government we create some kind of a false flag attack to give us an excuse to go
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:38.320]  further in before we shot down the syrian jet without warning and again as a means to stop a
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:44.800]  knee jerk beginning to a war communications were established between the russian and the united
[1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:51.360]  states to prevent this to say that talk about where the jets were and what planned actions were
[1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:56.560]  going to happen that was completely ignored we took a very dangerous precipitous action in terms
[1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:01.600]  of shooting down that syrian jet prior to that on that sunday that was about 10 days ago prior to
[1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:07.760]  that the preceding thursday we had moved artillery very close to positions that the syrian government
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:16.960]  had we are defending so-called moderate rebels and we see how this works these people are constantly
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:22.000]  changing their names one week they're moderate rebels the next week they're al-qaeda their ices
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.440]  whatever they just you know we know exactly what's happening we have pointed this out again with john
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:33.680]  mccain time and time again how he goes into these areas this is simply about creating chaos and it's
[1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:38.640]  a very very dangerous game of war that they're playing with russians russians were invited by
[1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:45.840]  the syrian government which is not perfect see that's that's the issue here there's not any perfect
[1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:52.640]  country in that area of the world there's not necessarily a good guy but we have there is
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:59.200]  a stable government we have a government that is far less dangerous to the people in syria and to
[1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:04.800]  the rest of the world than ices is and will be and we have seen this played out before in syria
[1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:09.200]  and in libya we know exactly how this is going to go down and many people have pointed that out but
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:13.840]  let's take a look at now what nicky hailey is trying to do and the white house elements within
[1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:20.000]  the white house they gave no details of these supposed preparations but they said the activities
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.760]  are similar to preparations the regime made before it's april fourth 2017 chemical weapons attack
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:31.920]  so really what were they doing stealing incubators or something and we'll talk about that we'll look
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:36.640]  at seymour hersh when he talks about what kind of activities what kind of preparations what kind
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:43.920]  of notifications happened before that attack that was characterized as a seren gas attack that could
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:53.200]  only be done by syria unbelievable that we would take action on this which was the same type of
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:58.160]  attack which was exposed as a lie in 2013 the white house warned as we previously say the
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:03.760]  us in syria is in syria to eliminate the islamic state of iraq and syria and there are people
[1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:08.720]  in the white house who want to see that happen but there are also people who don't care if that
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:13.280]  happens there are people who simply want regime change and they will use ices they will empower
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:18.400]  ices they will put them in charge if they can get regime change and they have their own reasons
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:24.240]  for why they want to do that pipelines and other issues are involved in that if however mr
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:28.080]  Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons he and his military will pay a
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:34.320]  heavy price nicky hailey tweeted a similar warning to russia and iran a short time later
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:40.480]  saying any attack would be blamed not only on Assad but quote also on russia and iran who support him
[1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:44.160]  killing his own people in other words anybody we don't like we're going to just unilaterally
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:48.960]  blame them without any proof and we will take action and you better believe they will they
[1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:54.960]  shot down that syrian jet without provocation without warning and uh this is the woman basically
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:16:01.680]  folks nicky hailey her family's from india she doesn't know anything about american history
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:08.560]  doesn't know anything about the civil war but she's started this one woman pogrom to essentially
[1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:15.040]  erase american history that she knows nothing about she was a never trump neocon and why she was
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:20.240]  ever picked as um ambassador i cannot understand why she was ever put in the administration
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:25.040]  uh a syrian minister dismissed the white house statement saying that demascus has not and will
[1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:29.680]  not use such arms they don't need to they're winning they're winning they don't need to do this they
[1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:35.920]  don't have any motivation to do this we're the ones who want to have a motivation to attack them
[1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:42.720]  to stop them from wiping out our surrogates ices let's keep that clear what this is really about
[1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:48.320]  russian officials accuse the u.s of laying the groundwork for an attack on syrian forces exactly
[1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:53.680]  let's take a look at the seymour hersh story seymour hersh pointed out and this this came
[1:16:53.680 --> 1:17:00.560]  out last week it was in a german paper last time when he was talking about the syrian
[1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:06.160]  fault-slag attack he had to do that in a london paper he's a former pure surprise winner who
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:11.040]  used to work for the new york times but people like seymour hersh are no longer welcome in the
[1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:17.280]  united states if they do not push war if they push against it uh the new york times the washington
[1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:22.400]  post uh whether they want to portray themselves as left or right there's one thing they all agree on
[1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:26.800]  they want war they pointed out the lobbying of tomahawk missiles into syria based on the
[1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:32.480]  fairy tale that Assad launched a chemical weapon attack and trump's cozying up to the barbaric
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:38.560]  terrorist-supported leaders of saudi arabia have been very concerning aspects of his foreign policy
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:43.520]  and we're all very concerned about this and these are elements within the trump administration
[1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:48.000]  there are other elements that we need to support and we need to support donald trump's instincts
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:53.520]  his knowledge what he campaigned on we need to stand behind him to make sure that the right
[1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:59.280]  elements that the better angels of his nature prevail here that he's not lied to that he's
[1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:04.400]  not deceived by these people that he does the right thing now this is a report that seymour hersh
[1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:08.320]  did call trump's red line he asserts that president trump ignored important intelligence
[1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:13.280]  reports when he made the decision to attack syria after pictures emerged of dying children
[1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:19.520]  in the war-torn country and this is a zero head report on trump on uh seymour hersh's report
[1:18:19.520 --> 1:18:25.040]  uh they point out that hersh's account uh in his account trump was well aware of the fact that the
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:30.400]  u.s. had no solid intelligence linking the syrian government to a chemical weapons attack according
[1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:35.200]  to hersh's article it's doubtful that a chemical weapons attack occurred at all hersh said this
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:40.400]  he said the available available intelligence made clear that the syrians had targeted a jihadist
[1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:46.000]  meeting on april the fourth remember now this is nikki haley and elements within the trump white
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:50.800]  house are saying we're seeing the same kinds of preparations happening now in syria that happened
[1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:55.200]  before this chemical weapons attack well what was happening on april fourth well in april fourth
[1:18:55.200 --> 1:19:00.560]  there was a meeting using russian supplied guided bombs uh with conventional explosives the details
[1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:06.160]  of the attack including information on its so-called high value targets had been provided
[1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:12.000]  by the russians days in advance to american and allied military officials in doha whose mission
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:17.200]  is to coordinate all u.s. allied syrian and russian air force operations in the region
[1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:22.400]  that has now been shut down because of our precipitous attack on the syrian jet one officer
[1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:26.640]  said none of this makes any sense we know there was no chemical attack the russians are furious
[1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:32.400]  claiming we have real intel and we know the truth i guess it didn't matter they said russia had
[1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:36.400]  actually warned its american counterparts off the chance that there were any cia assets on the
[1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:42.480]  ground so basically they were playing the game right they said so why would this happen well
[1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:48.000]  they believe as zero hedge points out you look at the timing of this it's at the time that
[1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:56.240]  journal flinn was removed and McMaster came into the operation so was the willingness here the
[1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:01.120]  manipulations of McMaster we're going to take a look at the efforts to get flinn when we come back

[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:15.040]  welcome back to the alice jones show i'm david night we've been talking about this
[1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:20.080]  seymour hirsch story and this is very important that we get this right folks we do not want to have
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:26.880]  a war provoked in syria we want to shut down isis and of course it doesn't look like the
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:31.520]  u.s government wants to shut down their surrogate it looks like they would rather have a war with
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:35.840]  the russians let's take a look at what seymour hirsch was saying in terms of what happened
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:44.560]  just before this latest event in syria as we have nicky hayley saying that looks like they
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:52.240]  are starting to have preparations that look exactly like what happened in april fourth 2017
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:57.360]  before a chemical weapons attack was there a chemical weapons attack what were the preparations
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:01.600]  well according to seymour hirsch he said russia had actually warned its american counterparts
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:06.640]  off the chant on the off chance that there were cia assets on the ground he continues he said he
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:10.960]  had his sources told him that every operations officer in the region in the army the marine
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:16.960]  corps air force cia and nsa had to know there was something going on the russians gave the syrian
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:22.320]  air force a guided bomb and that was a rarity their skippy with their guided bombs they rarely
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:26.000]  share them with the syrian air force the syrians assigned their best pilot to the mission with
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.720]  the best wingman the advanced intelligence on the target as supplied by the russians was given
[1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:35.760]  the highest possible score inside the american community so what they were saying was they
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:42.080]  were hitting a terrorist warehouse now the interesting thing about this that the one push
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:48.160]  back against this is the fact that the russians gave different accounts of this incident and
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:53.040]  and honestly we have to point this out they said strangely if hirsch's reporting is accurate
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:57.600]  it's not clear why the russians didn't give the detailed account at the time why didn't the russians
[1:25:57.600 --> 1:26:02.720]  emphasize that they had shared information with us military in advance of the attack it also doesn't
[1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:09.440]  explain why vladimir putin appeared to endorse two competing theories behind the events we also had
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:16.160]  however we had reports from the doctors without borders the french organization msf they said
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:20.560]  that there were eight patients that showed symptoms that were consistent to exposure to neurotoxins
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:26.000]  like seren gas or similar things and they said they also visited other hospitals that received
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:31.520]  victims found the patients there smelled of bleach suggesting that they've been exposed to chlorine
[1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:36.800]  in other words evidence suggested there was more than one type of chemical responsible for these
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:43.840]  symptoms observed i think this is very key if it was seren gas you would not have seen the types
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:50.320]  of video that we saw with people operating without protective clothing you also would have had nobody
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:57.680]  moving these weapons around unless they had a full hazmat suit but the issue here and of course we
[1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:03.840]  also had the former weapons inspector who had done the report and we reported this in info wars
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:11.600]  as well showing a canister that was imploded from above in the crater if you'd look at the pictures
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:17.840]  that were put out by the pentagon you can actually see the canister a canister that was crushed from
[1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:26.080]  above did not explode from within as you would have with a weaponized chemical canister so it's
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:30.880]  clear that there's a lot of misinformation here but it is also clear that the u.s based on this
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:39.600]  actions with the syrian jet based on the information that we got from postal who was a former scientific
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:43.600]  advisor to the u.s military's chief of naval operations a guy who had been hired by the pentagon
[1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:49.360]  as a consultant and there's that article there showing the canister how it was imploded from
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:57.280]  top down and not exploded all of that information shows that this is not a chemical weapons strike
[1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:04.320]  but that was a fairy tale okay that is not the narrative that we were being told and they point
[1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:09.200]  out this and this is a zero-hedge article they say missing from hersha's account however is the fact
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:13.760]  that it was newly appointed national security advisor general hr McMaster who laid out the
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:20.080]  military strike proposals to the president at his resort april the sixth that is the key folks
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:25.600]  that is the key the fact that we had general flinn removed and now we have this article today
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:31.760]  from circa did the fbi retaliate against michael flinn by launching the rusher probe so there's
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:38.480]  a couple of things here that are really really concerning about the firing of michael flinn
[1:28:38.480 --> 1:28:44.240]  number one the fact that he was targeted illegally by the intelligence community that they
[1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:50.240]  unveiled information about him when he was not a suspect that is a violation of the law the f the
[1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:56.160]  fiza court has talked about that they have unsealed those records the fact that they would unseal
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:02.400]  those record is a violation of the law by the fiza court as well as the fbi the fiza court says
[1:29:02.400 --> 1:29:10.560]  the fbi is never allowed to collect intelligence on american citizens in america without a search
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:20.080]  warrant that's the constitution the fiza court says the foreign intelligence act and the intelligence
[1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:26.000]  communities are allowed only to get information on foreign citizens in foreign countries without
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:31.120]  having a search warrant what they did to general flinn was outrageous it was a violation of law
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:37.840]  it had severe consequences from a not just a political standpoint but the intelligence
[1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:45.760]  community by taking out flinn by putting in mic master they were able to do this false flag attack
[1:29:45.760 --> 1:29:49.920]  that they did with the uh sarin gas or talk about what they did with michael flinn when we come back
[1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:55.280]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:55.280 --> 1:30:04.880]  the struggle in the dnc fraud lawsuit continues you've had the current council for the plaintiffs
[1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:10.480]  request that the judge provide witness protection that notion was rejected despite three mysterious
[1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:16.320]  deaths of potential witnesses in the case seth riche shon lucas and barrenton wyzenant jr there
[1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:20.560]  are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this case dropped entirely
[1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:26.320]  despite the obvious glaring issues that the dnc has had over the course of the last two years
[1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:30.240]  while the lawsuit represents bernie sanders supporters who feel they have been wronged
[1:30:30.240 --> 1:30:35.920]  by the dnc bernie sanders has fallen silent on the issue donald trump tweeted out this weekend
[1:30:35.920 --> 1:30:40.400]  hillary clinton colluded with the democrat party in order to be crazy bernie sanders is she allowed
[1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:45.280]  to collude unfair to bernie so now donald trump has done more to raise awareness for the dnc fraud
[1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:50.000]  lawsuit than bernie sanders has who actually is the one that had the election stolen from him
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:55.200]  why is bernie sanders silent on the issue maybe i guess he's busy with being investigated by the

[1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:30.240]  about syria about michael flan uh the exposure by uh simore herse asking questions and of course now
[1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:36.400]  nikki haley and other neocons and the trump administration pushing the idea that there's
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:41.840]  some kind of new preparation for a new chemical weapons attack in syria and that's going to give
[1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:46.960]  them carte blanche to do whatever they wish in the area attack whoever they wish whether it's syria
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:52.160]  iran or russia we'll just have to wait and see who nikki haley and mcmaster point the finger at so
[1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:56.720]  they can start world war three we're going to talk about where this came from and the key part of this
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:03.600]  i think is the fbi retaliation against michael flan and that's precisely what this is this is a new
[1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:07.840]  story you haven't heard this before i want to get into this and then we're going to get back to what
[1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:14.240]  happened with cnn we've also got a story update on uh serif joe arpaio and the struggle that he's
[1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:23.760]  going through uh being being prosecuted for obeying the law when the president and a judge
[1:34:23.760 --> 1:34:31.360]  told him not to so the judge holds him in contempt of the judge's ruling when the judge is ruling
[1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:37.200]  and the president's orders are in contempt of the law so what are we supposed to obey here we got
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:43.120]  the nirnberg trials here i guess uh we're not supposed to follow uh the written law you're
[1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:49.280]  supposed to follow whatever the dictates of the president and the judge at a given time are shutting
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:53.520]  down the immigration law shutting down the borders that's why the border patrol union
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:59.760]  took the unprecedented move of supporting donald trump they were absolutely outraged that the
[1:34:59.760 --> 1:35:05.600]  president and his liberal judges would shut down the enforcement of law shut down the protection
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:09.760]  of our borders real quickly before we get back to the story we have our fourth of july summer

[1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:36.320]  that we have with the neocons nicky hailey uh with the fbi coming after michael flan getting him out
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:43.520]  and then immediately we have this knee jerk firing uh claiming that it is a sarin gas attack it
[1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:51.280]  looked exactly like what we had shut down in 2013 we told people this is an attempt by obama
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:56.320]  to make the united states the air force of al-qaeda we have dropped supplies to them we have trained
[1:36:56.320 --> 1:37:00.640]  them we've given them money we've given them support we've told everybody that they're
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:06.480]  moderate rebels because they come up with all these different aliases and now we want the
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:10.720]  government to act as their air force that was what was happening four years ago we had soldiers
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:15.040]  and sailors getting on social media holding up pictures saying we will not be al-qaeda's air
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:21.360]  force that was shut down we showed that that was a fault narrative this was a false narrative that
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:28.000]  happened on april the fourth it was april the sixth that mcmaster began uh working uh taking over the
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:33.760]  national security council and that was a result now how did they get flin out this story from circa
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:38.720]  that came out yesterday evening talks about how the fbi launched a criminal criminal probe
[1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:45.760]  against advisor michael flan two years after the retired army general roiled the bureau's
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:51.200]  leadership by intervening on the behalf of a decorated counterterrorism agency agent who
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:58.800]  accused now deputy fbi director andrew mccabe and other top officials of sexual discrimination
[1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:04.880]  this is according to documents and interviews that have now surfaced so understand andrew mccabe
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:09.680]  who is the uh fbi director acting fbi director he was the number two for comey
[1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:18.000]  he was the target uh he was accused of sexual discrimination michael flan got involved it
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:23.840]  was an unusual intervention they said it was on behalf of a supervisory special agent robin gritz
[1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:30.160]  a female it was highly unusual they said it included a letter in 2014 on his official pentagon
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:36.880]  stationary this is a public interview in 2015 where he supported gritz's case and he offered to
[1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:45.200]  testify on her behalf his offer put him in as a hostile witness and a case against andrew mccabe
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:51.120]  fbi uh director now acting director who was soaring through the bureau's leadership ranks the fbi
[1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:56.080]  sought to block flin support for the agent they asked a federal administrative law judge in may
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:04.000]  2014 to keep flin and others from getting involved and from being witnesses in her eoc case two years
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:10.560]  later the fbi opened its inquiry of flin the eoc case which is still pending has serious enough
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:16.480]  to require mccabe to submit to a sworn statement to investigators the deputy director's testimony
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:22.400]  provided some of the strongest evidence in the case of possible retaliation because listen to this
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:28.560]  he admitted the fbi opened an internal investigation into gritz's personal conduct
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:33.840]  after learning that she had filed and had intended to file a sex discrimination complaint against
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:40.080]  her supervisors so once they found out she was accusing them of sexual discrimination they went
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:47.120]  after her personally and then once general flin got involved because he had uh worked with her
[1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:53.600]  in terms of the security issues and and she was known to him once he said that he was going to
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:59.120]  file on her behalf and testify on behalf her behalf they came after him that's what it looks
[1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:04.240]  like now your employees who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution told circa
[1:40:04.240 --> 1:40:09.600]  they did not know the reason for mccabe's displeasure with flin but that it made them uncomfortable
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:15.200]  as the russian probe began to unfold and pressure began to uh bill to investigate flin one employee
[1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:22.000]  even consulted a private lawyer so these are people within the fbi saying this looks like this is
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:28.640]  retaliatory against general flin because he got involved on behalf of an employee who said she
[1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:35.440]  was sexually discriminated against by mccabe and others quote as far as the troops in the field
[1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:41.440]  the vast majority were disgusted with the russia decision but that was mccabe driving the result
[1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:46.800]  that eventually led former fbi director james comey to make the decision mccabe whose wife
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:53.280]  was running for office in virginia getting money from the clinton foundation they say the flin
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:59.600]  leaks were nothing short of political said one fbi employee the leaks appeared to be targeted
[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:05.680]  to take flin out documents and memos obtained by circa detail how flin and other top officials at
[1:41:05.680 --> 1:41:13.920]  other government agencies in 2014 and 15 came to intervene in the eo k c case of grits who rose over
[1:41:13.920 --> 1:41:20.800]  two decades to a supervisory special agent inside the fbi on strength of her counterterrorism work
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:25.520]  for nearly a decade she had worked with the intelligence community to help successfully
[1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:32.400]  track down global terrorists or to rescue western hostages this is how general flin knew her but then
[1:41:32.400 --> 1:41:38.240]  when she went to work under mccabe her career took a sudden downturn under his leadership
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:43.760]  team in 2012 resulting in her first negative rating after years of outstanding performance
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:50.400]  reviews she filed an eo c complaint inside the fbi against a handful of bureau executives in 2012
[1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:58.400]  alleging her career was being derailed by sexual discrimination so on her behalf general flin says
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:03.200]  i've you know i'm i'm going to testify on her behalf she's been an exemplary person she's had
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:09.520]  a great record here that got him involved with this case where we now know that andrew mccabe
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:15.280]  began investigating her personally to try to get dirt on her then from testimony of other fbi agents
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:22.080]  that looks like mccabe came after flin as well and this case is still not resolved but it certainly
[1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:28.720]  does help andrew mccabe to have sully the reputation of michael flinn so that's just one aspect of it
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:35.120]  there's a personal aspect there but i think an even more important aspect here is how the intelligence
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:42.640]  community took out people who were going to be opposed to their ever-widening conflict in syria
[1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:48.800]  opposed to their regime change these are the people the mcmasters the patreuses the nicky halies who
[1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:54.080]  have pushed for regime change pushed for chaos and created chaos in libya and elsewhere and
[1:42:54.080 --> 1:43:02.960]  they're trying to do that in syria to create isis to empower isis to attack the people who are trying
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:10.000]  to stop isis that is absolutely irresponsible and as trump supporters we need to speak out against
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:15.360]  that we need to shut down this reckless dangerous action that could lead to world war three now i
[1:43:15.360 --> 1:43:20.160]  want to talk about what's going on with sheriff joe because this is also something that that really
[1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:25.440]  needs to get some publicity we really need to contact trump and the department of justice
[1:43:26.640 --> 1:43:34.720]  yesterday we had a criminal trial that opened against former sheriff joe arpio to build his
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:40.000]  highly touted deportation force they point out trump is now reviving a long-standing program
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:45.280]  that deputizes local officers to enforce federal immigration law that was what sheriff joe
[1:43:45.280 --> 1:43:52.000]  was doing and now we've got an activist judge who is trying to send him to jail for criminal
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:57.760]  contempt of this judge's order not to enforce immigration law our piles lawyer said the former
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:03.120]  sheriff is charged with crime for cooperating with us immigration officials say under the
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:08.400]  obama administration it was a crime to cooperate with immigration officials it was a crime to
[1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:13.920]  patrol the border that's why the border patrol was so strong and outspoken in its support of
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:21.440]  donald trump but what happened is uh we had sheriff joe's officers they say targeted immigrants
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:27.120]  who used fraudulent ids to get jobs why would we want a sheriff to do that i mean we don't want to
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:31.360]  if somebody comes into this country and violates the law foreign citizen comes here and criminally
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:36.960]  trespasses and thumbs their nose at the law we shouldn't investigate that if they use fraudulent
[1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:42.720]  ids to get jobs we shouldn't investigate that either and if we have a sheriff who's going to
[1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:48.480]  enforce those kinds of laws that sheriff needs to go to jail so that's what the former department
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:53.040]  of justice and i put that in quotes air quotes department of justice that's what they said
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:57.680]  that's what the former president said and so the question is why does the current
[1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:02.720]  department of justice continue to say that why is the current department of justice trying to
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:08.960]  crucify sheriff joe for trying to obey the law for trying to follow policy that got donald trump
[1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:14.400]  elected saying that he would enforce immigration law his immigration powers were eventually stripped
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:19.280]  away by the courts and by the federal governments just as the border patrols was but i want you to
[1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:28.080]  look at how this is turning the latest development in this is that former attorney of sheriff joe
[1:45:28.080 --> 1:45:34.160]  is forced to testify against him in violation of client attorney privileges a lawyer who once
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:39.360]  representative former sheriff joe arpaio in a racial profiling case has testified that he
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:43.680]  had several meetings with arpaio to discuss a court order that barred traffic patrols targeting
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:49.120]  immigrants this is a under a criminal contempt of court charge for prolonging the parole's
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:56.560]  after a judge ordered them stopped and so they're penetrating this attorney client privilege here
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:04.240]  and uh they're even shutting down his ability to have a trial by jury this judge does not
[1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:11.280]  want a jury this judge wants to be the sole judge and jury of what's going on with sheriff arpaio
[1:46:12.160 --> 1:46:18.400]  this is a kangaroo court case and sheriff joe has subpoenaed tried to pina subpoenaed
[1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:26.880]  uh jeff sessions to testify uh in late august of 2013 16 the department of justice then under
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:32.560]  loretta lynch formally filed criminal contempt of court charges against sheriff joe and others
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:38.640]  just two weeks before the election they broke a long-standing tradition and protocol not to
[1:46:38.640 --> 1:46:44.880]  take action against sitting elected officials close to an election in order to avoid unduly
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:50.080]  influencing public opinion and interfering with an election isn't that just what we heard from
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:56.080]  james comey isn't that what loretta lynch said when she said we want to call this a matter because
[1:46:56.080 --> 1:47:02.080]  we don't want to interfere with the election of hillary clinton so they backed off but for
[1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:08.240]  sheriff joe they did exactly the opposite as a matter of fact they decided to charge sheriff joe
[1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:13.040]  with a different statute of contempt of court than they did for three others that had been named
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:17.840]  in the referral the other three defendants had their charges dropped because of statute of limitations
[1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:24.400]  had run its course but the special charge that they put on sheriff joe uh got around the statute
[1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:30.720]  of limitations so that they could do it while he was running for reelection sheriff joe was charged
[1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:36.480]  with a unique statute a longer statute of limitations in order to make those charges stick
[1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:41.520]  to make it happen through the election to do the most political damage to him as close to the
[1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:46.560]  election as possible even though the charges of the department of justice filed against arpaio
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:53.040]  demand a trial by jury the department of justice has vehemently fought in court to deny the sheriff
[1:47:53.040 --> 1:47:58.640]  his constitutional right to a trial by jury which means that as they've appealed this to the supreme
[1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:04.960]  court without the supreme court stepping in sheriff joe is going to face trial right now
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:12.800]  where he will be decided by one sitting federal judge this is amazing prosecutors in the department
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:19.040]  of justice have opposed the bid for attorney general sessions to testify in this case i i just
[1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:26.480]  cannot understand just as we're talking about with jerome coursey the fanny freddy theft
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:32.320]  one of the biggest bank robberies i guess you could say in history where obama went in and
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:39.360]  did a net asset sweep of private investigators uh private investors uh of institutional investors
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:44.320]  and this is the type of investment as i've said before that typically pension funds and people
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:48.640]  who are trying to save something for the retirement they would invest in fanny and freddy because hey
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:55.040]  it looks like it's safe right it's a mortgage not only that but it's a package of mortgages that are
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:58.960]  insured by the federal government so somebody that's trying to preserve their capital for the
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:03.600]  retirement trying to do the right thing they'll put their money there and what you don't realize
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:11.440]  what the public doesn't realize is that although fanny and freddy was got into a very difficult
[1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:16.560]  situation just like the rest of the junk mortgages there they collateralize a lot of junk stuff and
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:22.240]  there were a lot of people who made a lot of money doing that they got millions of dollars
[1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:27.520]  and bonuses and the investors were left holding the bag the federal government stepped in took
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:35.920]  that over and then it began to be profitable obama didn't have any way to fund his subsidies of obama
[1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:43.120]  care congress refused to do it a judge ruled in favor of congress and said they have to
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:47.920]  appropriate the money you can't do that obama you can't move that money from somewhere else so
[1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:51.520]  then what he did was he said we're going to do a net asset sweep we're just going to take it away
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:57.840]  from the fanny and freddy investors we're gonna do whatever we wish to do and the department of
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:04.320]  justice appealed that decision now attorney general sessions could stop the funding of obama care
[1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:09.520]  just by dropping that appeal it's just that simple that's all the trump administration has to do
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:14.320]  to point out the bankruptcy of this nonsense we have the congressional budget office coming out
[1:50:14.320 --> 1:50:18.160]  with these scoring operations saying we're going to look at the number of people that have their
[1:50:18.160 --> 1:50:22.080]  insurance and that's going to be the standard by which we're going to determine whether this is a
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:28.080]  good bill or not that is based on a lie these people who quote unquote have insurance is based
[1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:33.600]  on theft it is not anything that was done legally and so that could be stopped by attorney general
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:40.400]  sessions they could stop this persecution of arpaio but they don't and the question is why
[1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:47.920]  why won't attorney general sessions step up stop this appeal stop this persecution of sheriff
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:53.520]  joe you need to let them hear from you you need to point this out these are great injustices
[1:50:53.520 --> 1:51:01.920]  that are being done stay with us to be right back it's been said any society is only three

[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:08.080]  things like this cnn is fake news contest and to give you another sample of just how fake cnn is
[1:57:08.080 --> 1:57:11.520]  we've got a little bit of time left in this segment i want to play again the cnn producer
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:18.720]  caught by uh james o' keith and project veritas talking about how they know this is a witch hunt
[1:57:19.920 --> 1:57:26.320]  i think that there are a lot of like liberal cnn viewers who want to see trump really get
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:33.840]  scrutinized and i think if we would have behaved that way with president wama and scrutinized everything
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:39.440]  that he was doing with as much scrutiny as we have applied to donald trump i think our viewers
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:45.680]  would have been turned off i think they would have thought we were attacking him but um i think
[1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:49.920]  our viewers right now and i'm not saying all of our viewers are like super liberals i think there's
[1:57:49.920 --> 1:57:56.160]  just a lot of them and so so trump's good for business you're saying trump is good for business
[1:57:56.160 --> 1:58:00.000]  so they're going to tell their listeners what they want to hear whether it's true or not you
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:09.280]  understand could be more i mean it's mostly right now like we don't have any big giant proof
[1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:13.440]  but then they say well there's still an investigation going on and you're like
[1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:20.000]  yeah i don't know if you're finding something here would we know about it the way these leaks happen
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:26.720]  and leak it and leak that's the key point let's hold it right there you know that's the key point
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:30.560]  and i think that's another important point for all of us to understand as well you know when i
[1:58:30.560 --> 1:58:35.200]  talk about these situations with uh syria when i talk about what elements inside the trump

[2:00:25.680 --> 2:00:29.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night coming up in the next segment and really
[2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:34.400]  is coming up the next segment i announced it last hour but uh i was a little bit ahead of time we
[2:00:34.400 --> 2:00:41.920]  have the authors of the convenient terrorist and of course this is a whistleblower john kiriyaku a
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:48.480]  former cia officer the one who blew the whistle on the illegal torturing of people they called it
[2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:53.840]  intense interrogation but unfortunately the people who are actually doing the torturing the people
[2:00:53.840 --> 2:00:59.200]  who are actually breaking the law nothing happened to them as we typically see it's the whistleblower
[2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:04.400]  who goes to jail now he's written a book along with uh joseph hickman who's former us marine senior
[2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:10.320]  research fellow for the center for policy and research talking about a very high profile case
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:15.680]  i think you're going to find this to be very very interesting story and it all goes back to
[2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:22.800]  what is true what is real are we going to put out a narrative that feeds the government side here
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:29.120]  and we're going to continue down this story down this government narrative regardless of the facts
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  so that's the thing that we need when we heard that last clip and we heard the cnn guy say he has
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:40.880]  we wouldn't have done this with president obama it would have alienated our audience our audience
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:45.440]  supported obama their liberal audience and so we wouldn't have tagged him that way we're going to
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:50.800]  attack donald trump because that's the confirmation bias of our audience we need to make sure that we
[2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:57.520]  as conservatives do not fall into a confirmation bias there are higher principles involved we want
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:04.480]  the rule of law we want the bill of rights that we have as individuals that is so precious in this
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:09.520]  country and we do not want to throw that away for anybody i believe that with donald trump we have
[2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:15.680]  an opportunity as somebody who thinks independently and we have the ability to make these arguments
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:21.280]  with him if we disagree with him on policy we should never blindly follow anybody in the battle
[2:02:21.280 --> 2:02:28.160]  but and there's certain areas like we have seen with the climate accord with the actions in syria
[2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:34.160]  where there's a division within the trump administration we have the opportunity to weigh
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:40.240]  in on the side of candidate trump weigh in on the side of candidate trump with president trump
[2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:45.840]  remind him what he ran on remind him of the principles remind him of what he saw in syria
[2:02:45.840 --> 2:02:50.880]  four years ago when he called it out as being false remind him of the false intelligence that
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:57.120]  was used to get us involved in iraq and make sure that he doesn't listen to elements within the
[2:02:57.680 --> 2:03:02.480]  government that are trying to push him in that direction in syria now it's very important
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:07.200]  that we speak up and just not take a back seat and say we're going to let president trump do
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:12.080]  whatever he wants to do we're going to support him regardless of what he does that is what we've
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:18.640]  seen far too many people do on the left we don't want to fall into that kind of mindless support
[2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:23.520]  for any candidate we want to stay with our principles that's why it is so important for us to talk
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:30.880]  to people who are whistleblowers who will go to jail if necessary to get the truth out there now
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:35.200]  before we go to them i just want to play one more clip here because when we're talking about what's
[2:03:35.200 --> 2:03:40.160]  going on with cnn we're talking about this false narrative that they sell for money this false
[2:03:40.160 --> 2:03:46.560]  narrative that they sell for audience it's also about their self-absorption and i think nobody
[2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:55.040]  embodies that better than uh jama costa and his temper tantrums about the white house press corps
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:04:02.320]  not being televised just continually in this white house press release that they had i'm
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:08.560]  looking at the transcript here obsessing about the fact that there's no camera that he can get on
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:14.160]  to show his face there's no camera jim you have an obligation to put the camera on you know you are
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:19.040]  a public servant and you need to televised us i mean the information is getting out there
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:27.440]  this is simply about him posing for the cameras let's play a clip of him uh a costing uh spicer
[2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:32.000]  this is uh jama costa costing spicer at the white house press conference
[2:04:33.040 --> 2:04:39.280]  jen john can you answer whether the president still believes the question there's no camera on
[2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:44.320]  jim but maybe we should turn the cameras on why don't we turn the cameras on why don't we turn
[2:04:44.320 --> 2:04:48.160]  the cameras on put the cameras on i want to be on camera why not turn the cameras on shot
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:53.760]  they're in the room the lights are on have been a drastic shift starting for maybe the week before
[2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:58.080]  a president took his first trip abroad that now we see you on camera about once a week is that
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:03.360]  a new normal that we would expect we're just wow you're going to love the latest idea out of the
[2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:08.640]  eu scott keller a german member of the european parliament and of the green party said we should
[2:05:08.640 --> 2:05:14.000]  transplant entire villages from syria to germany and that would encourage more migrants to enter
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:19.920]  germany listen to these quotes the idea of syrian villages is only one possibility we can use for
[2:05:19.920 --> 2:05:24.400]  example if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees people would
[2:05:24.400 --> 2:05:29.680]  rather go where compatriots already live which makes integration and acceptance easier let's
[2:05:29.680 --> 2:05:34.640]  look at these three compatriots from paul joseph watson sweden migrants viciously beat disabled
[2:05:34.640 --> 2:05:39.280]  men while calling him racist three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's
[2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:43.440]  wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month the handicap man was kicked
[2:05:43.440 --> 2:05:47.280]  and punched and received a vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on
[2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:52.640]  muslims and how all suites were racist now how's that for acceptance you can read both articles

[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:21.600]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night and we have a very important interview here i
[2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:25.200]  think you're really gonna enjoy this get a couple of individuals here and i'm reading from the
[2:08:25.200 --> 2:08:31.760]  introduction to the book the convenient terrorist joseph hickman and john kiriyaku two whistleblowers
[2:08:31.760 --> 2:08:36.480]  who defied the awesome power the u.s. national security colossus to tell their fellow americans
[2:08:36.480 --> 2:08:42.720]  the truth about the endless war on terror as hickman and kiriyaku right here this war has
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:49.840]  plunged the country into a weird wonderland where truth is fiction where allies become enemies and
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:55.440]  vice versa and the greatest threats to america are often generated by those in charge of protecting
[2:08:55.440 --> 2:09:00.560]  us hickman a u.s. army and marine veteran who blew the whistle on the abuse of prisoners at
[2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:07.120]  guantanamo bay prison complex and kiriyaku a cia veteran who served time in prison for exposing
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:12.640]  the agency's use of torture that's right this is whistleblowers who go to jail not the people who
[2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:20.080]  break the law in the government they're uniquely qualified to tell the sordid epic of abu zubaida
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:26.160]  the convenient terrorist whom the u.s. exploited to justify their own reign of terror in the middle
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:32.400]  east a very timely story because of course this is as they just said this is endless and we now
[2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:37.440]  see it ramping up again in syria getting into a very dangerous territory thank you so much for
[2:09:37.440 --> 2:09:45.680]  joining us gentlemen thank you and we've got you on two different locations so this will be a now
[2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:50.400]  let me talk to john here first john i had the pleasure of interviewing you once before and
[2:09:50.400 --> 2:09:55.360]  just as an introduction to our audience from that interview i remember we talked about the fact that
[2:09:55.360 --> 2:09:59.520]  you had 10 exceptional performance awards you were the one who actually cared captured
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:06.720]  this individual that we're going to talk about you got a 2016 sam adams award again as you expose
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:10.800]  the bush air torture program you're the only person jailed not the torturers who violated the law you
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:16.640]  were jailed and you wrote a couple of books already the reluctant spy my secret life and the cia's
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:22.640]  war on terror and doing time like a spy how the cia taught me to survive and thrive in prison
[2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:28.640]  now this book the convenient terrorist let me ask you the first question and then we will get to
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:41.040]  mr. hickman why the focus on this particular individual by the u.s. government well we believe
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:49.360]  cia back in 2001 and early 2002 that i was a beta was the number three person in al-qaeda
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:53.760]  vice president dick cheney echoed that in the press he said that that i was a beta was the
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:10:59.760]  number three that i was a beta was one of the masterminds of the 9-11 attacks and so we we pulled
[2:10:59.760 --> 2:11:05.280]  out all the stops to to track him down it took us about six weeks but we found him in a in a safe
[2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:11.040]  house in philadelphia by pakistan and when all was said and done it turned out that he was not the
[2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:17.280]  number three in al-qaeda in fact he had never joined al-qaeda he had never pledged fealty to
[2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:24.000]  wasama bin laden so we had this uh with this guy in our custody uh he was certainly a bad guy he
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:31.360]  would he acted as a logistician for al-qaeda he uh ran the training camps for al-qaeda he ran the
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:36.960]  house of martyrs safe house in peshawar pakistan for al-qaeda but he was not an al-qaeda mastermind
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:41.280]  and certainly not an al-qaeda leader yeah that's the interesting thing i think and you pointed
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:47.040]  out in this book he said you know we want to try to say that you know some guys either an al-qaeda
[2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:52.080]  guy or he's an innocent lamb this guy was certainly not an innocent lamb i mean he became a guinea pig
[2:11:52.800 --> 2:11:57.840]  for the torture program of the cia but he was not an innocent lamb but he on the other hand
[2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:03.280]  was not the number three guy in al-qaeda and that was i think that the key part of what they were
[2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:09.360]  selling the narrative that they sold america was that hey we got the leadership why why didn't they
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:16.240]  get other leaders if they were able to get the number three guy oh you're you're exactly right
[2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:21.360]  you know in those early days after the 9-11 attacks we really believed that we were hot on the trail
[2:12:21.360 --> 2:12:26.720]  of wasama bin laden i'm in isawahidi we had learned about khaled shaykh muhammad and certainly we
[2:12:26.720 --> 2:12:32.080]  caught khaled shaykh muhammad in august of 2002 but you're right al-bazir beta was the first high
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:37.920]  level capture so why didn't that lead to any other high level captures it's because he just simply
[2:12:37.920 --> 2:12:43.360]  didn't have the information and david you make an important point here too and that is that
[2:12:43.360 --> 2:12:48.480]  that so many of us in government wanted to believe that everything was black and white
[2:12:48.480 --> 2:12:53.760]  that you're either a good guy or you're a bad guy and that's just simply not the case here
[2:12:54.480 --> 2:13:01.200]  i was a beta was somebody who meant us harm i was a beta with somebody who meant to um
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:06.640]  to recruit jihadis to fight against the united states but he was not one of the masterminds
[2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:11.840]  of uh 9 11 as the cia and the white house wanted us to believe while at the same time
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:18.080]  he was not the innocent naïve that his defense attorneys want us to believe let me let me talk
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:23.760]  to uh joseph hickman here because in the introduction to the uh book you were talking about when
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:29.360]  you looked at the senate intelligence committee's declassified report mr hickman
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:35.600]  and uh you said you were interested to see what they were going to say about abu zada zabada
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:40.720]  whether he was going to be mentioned and he was mentioned 1000 times in that report
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:47.280]  uh your comment on uh on what you what your thoughts were with that and and uh what you
[2:13:47.280 --> 2:13:55.040]  saw there as somebody who exposed uh the abuses at getmo well when i when i first heard that there
[2:13:55.040 --> 2:14:01.440]  was uh when they're you know he was in a thousand times and it was you know he was waterboarded 83
[2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:09.040]  times my my thoughts i actually went right to my friend john uh john karyaku i mean he's the one
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:17.920]  that really said it before anyone accepted it and uh i mean what his revelations were actually on
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:26.240]  paper then and uh it was uh when i realized i had to get ahold of john let's let's set the
[2:14:26.240 --> 2:14:35.840]  record straight on who's abeta is um it needs to be done because right now um you know still
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:40.480]  government officials are still claiming he was al-qaeda and it's just not true and you said
[2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:43.680]  that you you had learned everything in his biography you had analyzed his government
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:48.560]  died all the government documents about him you had interviewed him his family his uh
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:54.960]  friends and associates uh the you were absolutely certain that he was not the number three guy in
[2:14:54.960 --> 2:15:02.080]  al-qaeda absolutely not it's no way he uh it wasn't he was not affiliated with al-qaeda at all
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:08.640]  in a sense i mean he did uh he did al-qaeda terrorists did did go through his training camp
[2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:14.880]  al-qaeda members did go through there but it was not uh he was never a member of al-qaeda
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:21.600]  and that was a big problem too i think with the government uh right after 9 11 we were we were
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:30.240]  chasing these guys with the mentality of the american mafia looking for uh looking for al-qaeda
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:34.400]  operatives with that mentality and it just doesn't work in the middle east so this guy
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:38.080]  is safe to say would be kind of like a low-level fish and they tried to make him into a kingpin
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:42.320]  because they needed to win and would that be correct uh to take a look at it from that standpoint
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:49.040]  they needed to have a high-profile victory uh so they wanted to make this guy into a high-profile
[2:15:49.040 --> 2:15:54.320]  leader even though he was a low-level terrorist within uh the periphery of al-qaeda they wanted
[2:15:54.320 --> 2:16:00.000]  him to be a high-level kingpin so they could look good on paper and in order to make that
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:05.040]  happen uh they began the waterboarding is that would would that be safe to say is that correct
[2:16:07.920 --> 2:16:14.480]  yep that's absolutely true that's absolutely true and and and the that's the specific reason
[2:16:14.480 --> 2:16:20.160]  why the ci began its torture program you know the the the dirty little secret of that torture
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:27.360]  program is that the fbi in the form of former fbi agent ali sufan was actually making progress with
[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:33.600]  abu zubeda at this secret prison overseas he he was sitting across the table from abu zubeda
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:38.960]  treating him with respect he established a rapport they established a nascent relationship
[2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:45.280]  and abu zubeda began to open up to him and was actually giving us actionable information actionable
[2:16:45.280 --> 2:16:52.560]  intelligence that we were to use to try to dismantle uh the the al-qaeda network in germany
[2:16:52.560 --> 2:16:57.520]  but it takes time to establish that kind of relationship and the cia grew very frustrated
[2:16:57.520 --> 2:17:02.240]  they believed abu zubeda was holding back which we now know from the senate torture report and the
[2:17:02.240 --> 2:17:08.160]  cia inspector general's report was just simply not true i was not holding back and and so they
[2:17:08.160 --> 2:17:13.440]  started to uh to torture him and they tortured him mercilessly and to what end he never gave us
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:18.480]  anything else of any value once the torture began i remember when we had the previous interview
[2:17:18.480 --> 2:17:22.960]  and you were talking about about you were there when they captured this guy and he was shot
[2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:29.280]  fairly seriously uh wounded and you were there at his bedside when he came to and uh what did he
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:36.240]  say to you the first thing he said is that he asked me to kill him he asked me to smother him
[2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:41.600]  with the pillow um and i told him oh no nobody's going to kill you abu zubeda we've been looking
[2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:46.640]  for you for a long time and i told him i'm the nicest guy that you're going to meet in this
[2:17:46.640 --> 2:17:52.880]  experience my colleagues in the cia they're not as nice as i am so if i can give you one piece of
[2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:59.280]  advice it's that you have to cooperate and he said you seem like a nice man but you're the enemy
[2:17:59.280 --> 2:18:05.040]  and i'll never cooperate well as he calmed down a little bit we had longer and longer
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:09.920]  conversations and one of the things that he said that really that really struck me at the time
[2:18:10.880 --> 2:18:16.400]  was that he did not want to attack the united states on 9 11 he wanted to attack israel
[2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:22.880]  he's palestinian and he said all he ever wanted to do was to kill jews uh but he was overruled
[2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:27.680]  and the reason he was overruled is because he simply was not the number three in al-qaeda
[2:18:27.680 --> 2:18:34.320]  he just simply did not have that kind of authority or that kind of access to bin laden and zawahiri
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:39.520]  and khald shaykh muhammad you know i think it's interesting let's talk a little bit about
[2:18:39.520 --> 2:18:45.120]  and either one of you can address this uh let's talk a little bit about just the pragmatic aspect
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:51.040]  of torture uh in terms of getting what you want out of these people because there are legal issues
[2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:56.000]  there are ethical issues and i don't want to downplay those if we lose our ethical and legal
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:19:01.360]  foundations we don't exist as a society we become the monsters that we try to kill but let's just
[2:19:01.360 --> 2:19:06.400]  talk about the pragmatic aspect of this because a lot of people don't really care about law and
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:11.360]  ethics anymore in this country let's talk about getting what we want out of these people shutting
[2:19:11.360 --> 2:19:17.280]  them down stopping an attack and the the typical thing that you always see the ticking time bomb
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:23.520]  scenario that's from uh 24 that the media gave to us address those issues for us
[2:19:25.200 --> 2:19:30.640]  yeah do you mind if i jump in first sure go ahead i i love this ticking this ticking time bomb
[2:19:30.640 --> 2:19:36.000]  scenario because it's just such fantasy it only happens in the movies it just never happens in
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:42.640]  real life so you're right let's let's say ethics and legality and morality aside let's say we we
[2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:47.840]  start torturing someone because we want to extract the information you know hang on there john we
[2:19:47.840 --> 2:19:52.080]  got to take a quick break i've got a hard break here i went a little bit long on that intro to

[2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:15.440]  fairer i've never welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we're talking to a couple
[2:24:15.440 --> 2:24:20.880]  of very important whistleblowers two whistleblowers who blew the whistle on torture on terror on secret
[2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:26.080]  wars on the lies of the cia the book is called the convenient terrorist we're talking to joseph
[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:32.800]  hickman and to john kiriakou john actually went to jail because he blew the whistle on waterboarding
[2:24:32.800 --> 2:24:37.520]  but of course the people who actually violated the law calling it enhanced torture did not go
[2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:43.200]  to jail and so we ran out of time in the last segment i had just asked john about the pragmatic
[2:24:43.200 --> 2:24:50.000]  aspects of this we always see the dramatization and 24 and these other stories about the ticking
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:55.920]  time bomb we have no time left we've got to torture this guy to stop this terrorist act from
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:25:00.720]  happening your response to the real world somebody who's been there and actually done it john what's
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:06.640]  your response to the ticking time bomb scenario my my response is there really is no such thing
[2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:13.600]  what happens is you start torturing this guy and finally he tells you what he thinks you want to
[2:25:13.600 --> 2:25:20.000]  to hear so in addition he tells you a million other things and what you have to do is turn that
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:25.600]  information over to an analyst or to a team of analysts to pour over the information and figure
[2:25:25.600 --> 2:25:29.680]  out what makes sense and what doesn't make sense in the meantime six weeks have passed and the bomb
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:36.400]  has already gone off so it doesn't work um you know and i would tell people who who say that um
[2:25:37.280 --> 2:25:42.800]  that it does work that that's not the issue there are a lot of things that work uh rape works we
[2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:48.080]  don't rape prisoners at least we're not supposed to killing their children in front of them works
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:53.360]  but it's morally reprehensible we would never do such a thing so the issue isn't does it work the
[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:59.680]  issue is is it legal is it moral and is it ethical we're a nation of laws whether we like it or not
[2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:04.640]  we have to follow those laws and if we don't like the laws we have a mechanism to change them but you
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:09.200]  just can't start torturing people willy nilly and hope everything comes out well and i think that's
[2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:12.720]  the other t2 you know a lot of people will look at this and say well you know you're on your moral
[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:18.880]  high horse and uh you know we just don't have the time for ethics or for law or whatever we have to
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:26.560]  understand that if we allow our government to violate the law to terrorize people that is the
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:33.280]  worst possible scenario that can come out of this we do not want to turn our government agents into
[2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:39.280]  terrorists themselves once they do that there is nothing to protect us from them that is the most
[2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:44.800]  dangerous possible outcome is that we uh become criminals and terrorists and that i i think that's
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:49.680]  the the key part uh for me when i look at this i do not want to see just as we're looking at this
[2:26:49.680 --> 2:26:56.080]  election and as the fiza court has said that we have law enforcement and the nsa have violated
[2:26:56.080 --> 2:27:01.680]  the laws uh the fiza court made their ruling they uh declassified this so we could all see it
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:06.160]  the worst possible scenario is to have our intelligence community become this politicized
[2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:12.640]  east german or orwellian service that is now operating at the behest of politicians to attack
[2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:17.040]  other people and use the apparatus a full apparatus of the intelligence community and the same thing
[2:27:17.040 --> 2:27:24.480]  is true i think of torture and and other issues like that joseph uh hickman you were there at
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:29.520]  gitmo you blew the whistle on things that were happening there what can you tell us about other
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:35.680]  things that happened to prisoners other prisoners besides abu uh zabida who was tortured what about
[2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:41.440]  other prisoners who were tortured there and what happened well uh you know the cia had a secret
[2:27:41.440 --> 2:27:47.280]  black site there guantanamo uh we weren't really sure what they were doing there but they would
[2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:59.120]  transport detainees uh to that site uh a few times a month and actually uh when i was there in 2006
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:08.720]  and 2007 uh they were roughly they were doing roughly 200 interrogations uh a week and the
[2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:15.360]  cia i i'm not sure how many they were doing at their black site but one thing for sure happened
[2:28:15.360 --> 2:28:24.080]  when i was there three detainees were transported to that black site and one evening of june nine
[2:28:24.080 --> 2:28:32.640]  2006 and those three detainees came back from that site dead so i don't know exactly what
[2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:37.520]  happened in there how it happened but they were uh there was three detainees that were killed that
[2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:41.520]  night now we're talking about that being a black site i mean is is the uh legal fiction that we're
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:47.680]  operating under here is that uh because cia is doing it at uh guantanamo bay which is in cuba
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:53.280]  that that doesn't really fall in the jurisdiction of us laws or somehow is are they playing that game
[2:28:53.280 --> 2:29:00.400]  or uh well it's a it's a do d facility guantanamo uh camp america where all the detainees are held
[2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:06.000]  but right outside there was a cia facility that was not supposed to be there at all i said and it
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:11.280]  wasn't it wasn't uh wasn't supposed to be operational and that's something that we see all the time i
[2:29:11.280 --> 2:29:17.120]  mean just the idea of uh using the semantics of enhanced interrogation uh for things that had
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:22.880]  been recognized in the past waterboarding was uh prosecuted as a war crime by the american
[2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:27.200]  government at the end of world war two when the japanese did it but then when the cia does it they've
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:34.080]  got a slick lawyer who comes in and writes a book called company man and he rebrands it as enhanced
[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:38.960]  interrogation and when we come back we're going to talk to joseph hickman and john kiriyaku i want
[2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:44.960]  to get their feel for what they think in terms of the public uh perception of this and the public's
[2:29:44.960 --> 2:29:50.800]  support for torture even after they see the details we'll be right back we're on the march the empires
[2:29:50.800 --> 2:30:02.800]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network the struggle in the dnc fraud lawsuit continues
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:07.520]  you've had the current council for the plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness protection
[2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:13.040]  that notion was rejected despite three mysterious deaths of potential witnesses in the case seth
[2:30:13.040 --> 2:30:18.560]  riche shon lucas and baronton wyzenant jr there are also stalwarts in the justice system that
[2:30:18.560 --> 2:30:24.080]  are trying to have this case dropped entirely despite the obvious glaring issues that the dnc
[2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:28.720]  has had over the course of the last two years while the lawsuit represents bernie sanders supporters
[2:30:28.720 --> 2:30:34.640]  who feel they have been wronged by the dnc bernie sanders has fallen silent on the issue donald
[2:30:34.640 --> 2:30:38.480]  trump tweeted out this weekend hillary clinton colluded with the democrat party in order to be
[2:30:38.480 --> 2:30:43.360]  crazy bernie sanders is she allowed to collude unfair to bernie so now donald trump has done
[2:30:43.360 --> 2:30:48.080]  more to raise awareness for the dnc fraud lawsuit than bernie sanders has who actually is the one
[2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:53.200]  that had the election stolen from him why is bernie sanders silent on the issue maybe i guess he's
[2:30:53.200 --> 2:30:59.360]  busy with being investigated by the fbi for bank fraud for info wars dot com this is owens royer

[2:33:18.640 --> 2:33:24.720]  talking to joseph hickman john kiryako two whistleblowers about uh torture and terror
[2:33:24.720 --> 2:33:30.480]  and the secret wars and the lies of the cia the book is called the convenient terrorist
[2:33:31.200 --> 2:33:36.160]  and they focus on one individual who although he was a terrorist although he was involved
[2:33:36.160 --> 2:33:41.760]  with al-qaeda he they needed the government needed somebody who was a profile high profile
[2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:48.480]  individual so they built him up as the number three in al-qaeda which their book points out he
[2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:54.640]  clearly was not and in order to make that case he was subjected to quite a bit of torture how
[2:33:54.640 --> 2:34:00.640]  much torture was he subjected to uh john you know it was waterboarding it was merciless he was
[2:34:01.440 --> 2:34:08.080]  yeah he was waterboarded um uh 83 times but beyond the waterboarding we we did other things to him
[2:34:08.080 --> 2:34:12.640]  that that i always thought were worse than waterboarding we subjected him to what was called
[2:34:12.640 --> 2:34:17.360]  a cold cell where we we stripped him naked we chained him to an eyeballed in the ceiling so
[2:34:17.360 --> 2:34:23.600]  he couldn't sit or kneel or get comfortable in any way and uh and then we uh chilled the cell to
[2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:29.280]  50 degrees Fahrenheit and every hour threw a bucket of ice water on him we actually we actually
[2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:34.320]  killed prisoners using that method uh we also suggested subjected him to sleep deprivation
[2:34:34.320 --> 2:34:40.080]  for as long as seven days people begin losing their minds at day seven they begin dying at day
[2:34:40.080 --> 2:34:47.920]  nine he also had a terrible fear of insects and so we put him in a dog cage for for two weeks
[2:34:47.920 --> 2:34:53.200]  and then dumped a box of cockroaches on him just to make him crazy wow so there was a lot
[2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:57.840]  well that that is straight out of it went on for quite some time that that's straight out of george
[2:34:57.840 --> 2:35:03.280]  orwell's 1984 where they put the guy's head in a box in a cage and and release the rats on him i mean
[2:35:03.280 --> 2:35:07.680]  that that's absolutely it's just just diabolical that that we would be doing that for things so
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:12.160]  when you look at this and we get some of this information out to people and we still have
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:18.480]  a lot of americans supporting a torture program we see a lot of polls where they support that
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:22.160]  even though we talk about these details they say well we're fine with that i mean what is your
[2:35:22.160 --> 2:35:31.440]  response to that you're the one of you go ahead john you go ahead joe really well i uh
[2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:44.000]  go ahead please john go ahead go ahead john we'll let you go first okay thanks i'm always always
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:50.160]  disappointed in in these polls we see these polls come out with some regularity uh saying that that
[2:35:50.160 --> 2:35:56.560]  fully a majority of americans support a torture program and the only thing that i can conclude
[2:35:56.560 --> 2:36:03.440]  is that americans don't understand what torture entails and americans don't understand the law
[2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:10.480]  we have a federal torture act in this country that specifically prohibits exactly those techniques
[2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:16.160]  that we used against abuzebeta and other al-qaeda prisoners we are signatories to the united nations
[2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:21.520]  convention against torture which has the force of law here in the united states and people don't
[2:36:21.520 --> 2:36:26.960]  understand david that that very fact that you mentioned a few moments ago that in the aftermath
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:33.840]  of the second world war we executed japanese soldiers who uh who waterboarded american prisoners
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:40.720]  of war it's always been illegal it continues to be illegal and it shouldn't be done by americans
[2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:44.720]  yeah and let me let me put it from the standpoint of some of the people who were involved in it who
[2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:51.280]  now uh they actually do know what is involved with this the new york times uh uh just a few days ago
[2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:56.480]  had a story talking about a couple of individuals maybe you guys know their names john bruce jesson
[2:36:57.440 --> 2:37:02.480]  james mitchell these 15 years after they helped devise brutal interrogation techniques used on
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:09.120]  terrorism suspects and secret cia prisons uh jesson and mitchell jesson is a former military
[2:37:09.120 --> 2:37:14.080]  psychologist he expressed ambivalence about the program he described himself and fellow military
[2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:19.680]  psychologist mitchell as reluctant participants in using the techniques some of which are widely
[2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:24.240]  viewed as torture but also justify the practices as effective in getting resistance detainees to
[2:37:24.240 --> 2:37:29.600]  cooperate one of the things that he said in this though he goes back to this ticking time bomb
[2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:34.160]  scenario they said they were pressured by the military in order to do this they said this is
[2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:40.320]  this is urgent we've got to do this so uh we want you to and this gets to their ethical issues the
[2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:46.400]  hippocratic oath that uh doctors and psychologists have taken to violate that oath in order to do this
[2:37:47.040 --> 2:37:53.040]  they were played uh just as the american public has been played by films like you know series like
[2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:59.840]  like 24 and so forth and even when we look uh gentlemen at things like polls uh this last
[2:37:59.840 --> 2:38:06.640]  election was a reminder that polls can be twisted uh may not have any basis in reality they may be
[2:38:06.640 --> 2:38:13.680]  using and frequently do use polls to push an agenda or to push a candidate or to push an issue
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:19.520]  and they don't always honestly report the results in these polls so your comments about those those
[2:38:19.520 --> 2:38:29.920]  two things well i think i think it's true i think uh that we can't trust polls at all i i i do believe
[2:38:29.920 --> 2:38:35.200]  there's a lot of americans that still think it's it's okay uh to torture people but they they're
[2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:40.880]  just not educated on the subject and i don't think they'd want their sons or daughters to be torturers
[2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:46.320]  growing up and i mean these these these cases were brutal the things that they did as a beta was
[2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:54.400]  absolutely brutal if you have a technique called uh anal rehydration or anal feeding there's something
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:39:03.120]  wrong there yes it's it's it's not it's not a good thing so uh absolutely i mean the polls
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:07.520]  the polls i i just i don't believe but i still think there's people that need to be educated
[2:39:07.520 --> 2:39:13.520]  and know exactly what we're doing people out there well let's talk about you when we look
[2:39:13.520 --> 2:39:17.280]  at this when we talk about rendition and other things one the one of the things that really
[2:39:17.280 --> 2:39:23.600]  concerned a lot of us who are libertarians was the national defense authorization act of 2012
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:30.800]  where brock obama uh they they put the uh the clause in there saying that american citizens
[2:39:30.800 --> 2:39:35.600]  could be indefinitely detained and by the military for an indefinite amount of time okay
[2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:41.440]  and when we look at that i think the people who are going to buy into this on a pragmatic basis
[2:39:41.440 --> 2:39:45.920]  and say these are dangerous people and they are they need to be stopped and they absolutely need
[2:39:45.920 --> 2:39:51.520]  to be stopped but as i pointed out before what what do we do when our government starts adopting
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:57.520]  these types of practices will you be the next to booze abaya okay when this happens look at people
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:04.560]  like richard jewel who was falsely accused we had nbc news and cnn have to give him a
[2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:11.280]  undisclosed amount in terms of settlement for six months this guy was attacked in the press
[2:40:11.280 --> 2:40:16.400]  he was a hero basically in the olympic park bombing he was a security guard there in atlanta
[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:22.800]  but then he became falsely identified as the individual responsible for this and he was
[2:40:22.800 --> 2:40:28.800]  vilified in the press what if they'd had india at that point in time what if they'd had a more
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:34.240]  aggressive approach to that what if they had taken him and disappeared him so that he was not able
[2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:39.360]  to go through due process not able to confront his accusers not able to have a trial by jury
[2:40:39.360 --> 2:40:44.480]  all of these things that are so precious because throughout history and our own history our own
[2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:49.360]  western civilization we've had star chambers that come in and take people and remove them the dead
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:54.240]  of night and you never see see them again we do not want to allow that to happen in the united
[2:40:54.240 --> 2:40:58.400]  states this has happened throughout central and south america where the cia has been involved
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:02.640]  heavily we do not want to see this happening to our own citizens so i would say to people
[2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:08.000]  look at the case of richard jewel for example look at the ndaa and what what would the two of you
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:14.080]  say about that there was a slippery slope where it came to our civil liberties during the obama
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:19.040]  administration you know when you have the attorney general of the united states tell the sitting senator
[2:41:19.040 --> 2:41:23.920]  during a congressional hearing this is senator rand paul that the president reserves the right
[2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:33.360]  to to kill an american citizen on us soil because he believes him to be uh an imminent danger but
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:38.560]  without any due process without ever being accused of a crime without ever being afforded the right
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:44.560]  to face his accusers in a court of law then there's a real problem it is a slippery slope it's a
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:51.920]  slippery slope toward tyranny and um and i think that uh that for a very long time we saw this happen
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:58.960]  at the top most uh places in government that there was almost nobody to stand up and say stop
[2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:04.320]  this is wrong yeah yeah let's talk about uh what's happening to these prisoners right now
[2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:08.720]  who are still there because he this particular guy is still there isn't he in the system
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:15.520]  yes he's held uh he's held with uh out charge or any due process whatsoever
[2:42:16.080 --> 2:42:22.640]  still being held uh to your knowledge is he still being tortured no he's not being tortured
[2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:29.120]  okay what is the current official status i mean do we know if they if the cia has stopped these
[2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:35.360]  torture programs or they have they said they have is there any way to verify if they really have if
[2:42:35.360 --> 2:42:40.480]  they said that they have well there's there's almost no way to verify uh president obama
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:47.840]  did sign an executive order uh stopping the bush era torture program but what he did not sign was
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:53.200]  an order stopping extraordinary rendition which frankly is just about as bad an extraordinary
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:43:02.080]  rendition is let's say you are um uh an egyptian and i capture you in pakistan well instead of
[2:43:02.080 --> 2:43:09.520]  sending you back to egypt to face justice i send you to someplace like algeria or morocco or jordan
[2:43:10.640 --> 2:43:17.680]  or libya and i with a wink and a nod i i tell the intelligence service in that country hey please
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:22.560]  don't torture this guy but let us know everything that he says well the reason we sent him there in
[2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:28.080]  the first place was to torture him and to disappear him yes so it's you know without
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:33.360]  getting our hands too terribly dirty we still kind of push the same policy yeah we can pervericate
[2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:36.480]  around the bush and we can pretend that we're not the ones doing it although the we're the
[2:43:36.480 --> 2:43:40.960]  ones who are initiating it let me ask you about the situation that we have going on right now in
[2:43:40.960 --> 2:43:48.800]  syria because there's a lot of uh back and forth as to who these individuals are and as somebody
[2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:54.640]  who's been trying to track down terrorists and we see these people in syria where they're constantly
[2:43:54.640 --> 2:44:00.480]  evolving labels uh they're they're called moderate rebels or they change the name of their organization
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:05.360]  i mean what does your general take on what's going on there i mean are we from what you're
[2:44:05.360 --> 2:44:10.320]  looking at does it look to you as if it would be your assessment that we are uh arming and
[2:44:10.320 --> 2:44:18.720]  assisting isis as a tool to implement regime change there i think i mean we're we're obviously
[2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:25.680]  arming the free syrian army uh we're we're arming a lot of groups over there and maybe even elements
[2:44:25.680 --> 2:44:31.360]  of al-qaeda it's it's absolutely insane it's history repeating itself we did the same thing in
[2:44:31.360 --> 2:44:39.520]  afghanistan against the soviets and they ended up being our bitter enemies years later it's uh
[2:44:39.520 --> 2:44:49.280]  it's it's no way to uh really fight a war is to arm warlords i think uh and as you're pointing out
[2:44:49.280 --> 2:44:53.760]  that that we've seen that going all the way back to the early days of afghanistan once we have an
[2:44:53.760 --> 2:44:59.600]  objective once we have targeted an enemy whether it is russia whether it is syria whatever we will
[2:44:59.600 --> 2:45:05.200]  ally ourselves won't we with any elements no matter how bad they are in order to achieve that
[2:45:05.200 --> 2:45:12.640]  purpose wouldn't you say that's kind of been the way the cia is operated over the decades
[2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:19.040]  earlier today that there's an old saying at the cia that you can't you can't buy an afghan warlord
[2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:25.440]  but you can certainly rent one and and that's what the cia does it'll rent a warlord or or it'll
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:33.040]  rent a an opposition group or a rebel group and then when we lose the the uh the taste for that
[2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:41.040]  kind of uh war or insurgency we walk away and uh here we've we've armed and funded and radicalized
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:45.360]  people and then we just walk away well what do we think is going to happen eventually they're
[2:45:45.360 --> 2:45:49.680]  going to turn against us and we saw that in afghanistan i think we're seeing the early stages
[2:45:49.680 --> 2:45:54.640]  of that in syria right now yeah absolutely and when we look at the situation that we have um
[2:45:55.200 --> 2:46:00.560]  uh in syria now that they're starting to ramp up afghanistan again as well but
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:06.160]  i guess the key thing here that we see is the the conflict that we are are rapidly approaching
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:11.360]  when you look at the cia and you look at the intelligence communities i mean it seems like
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:15.680]  when we're looking at the trump administration uh there appear to be people like mattis who
[2:46:15.680 --> 2:46:20.800]  want to try to focus on isis but then there seem to be other individuals like big master
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:27.680]  who has lied in the past with patreus who are more focused on um on getting regime change getting
[2:46:27.680 --> 2:46:33.120]  Assad out of there and they don't really care who they ally with i mean it's uh you know what what
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:39.360]  what is your take on uh the situation that's going on there at at the moment i think regime
[2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:46.000]  change is a very dangerous policy and it's because we're simply not good at it we've never been good
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  at it we never seem to have a plan for what happens after the overthrow yeah i remember sitting in a
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:47:02.000]  in a classified video teleconference uh with this was in uh early 2003 uh just before days before
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:07.040]  the invasion of iraq and and the vice president was chairing the meeting and it was kondalisa rice
[2:47:07.040 --> 2:47:12.720]  and george tenon and high high level people the highest level and i remember one of the senior
[2:47:12.720 --> 2:47:19.120]  national security um officials on the on the conference said that uh when we crossed the
[2:47:19.120 --> 2:47:24.560]  border into iraq the iraqi people were going to throw flowers at us and i remember thinking
[2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:31.440]  have we learned nothing from history yeah nobody's gonna throw flowers on us if we invade their
[2:47:31.440 --> 2:47:36.640]  country well it's the same thing if we overthrow bashar al-assad and i'll add something about bashar
[2:47:36.640 --> 2:47:44.080]  al-assad too whether we like his politics or not bashar al-assad is the only thing standing between
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:51.200]  the christian community in syria and its annihilation yes only 12 percent of syrians are christians
[2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:59.200]  and they've had a long and successful run with the asad family uh if if a rebel group takes over
[2:47:59.200 --> 2:48:05.520]  whether it's the the nusratah front or the free syrian army or god forbid isis there's not going
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:11.120]  to be any love for the christian community and we've already seen that in afghanistan and we've
[2:48:11.120 --> 2:48:15.840]  and we've already seen that john in afghanistan in iraq elsewhere we've seen that the christian
[2:48:15.840 --> 2:48:23.200]  communities who had been there for centuries as a small minority essentially vanish once our warlords
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:28.720]  took place there i guess that's what they call a nation building but that hasn't worked the asymmetric
[2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:33.600]  warfare has not worked in these areas and yet we continue to do that we continue to not learn
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:38.240]  anything whatsoever from this and of course when we look at libya i think that's probably
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:44.560]  a worst-case scenario uh just recently that we had uh turning it into as ran paul said an arms
[2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:53.360]  bizarre for al-qaeda absolutely true we're just not not good at it look all over the region look
[2:48:53.360 --> 2:49:01.920]  look at syria and libya and egypt and iraq and afghanistan uh samalia yemen there have been even
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:06.960]  uprisings in bahrain where we have you know one of the largest naval bases in the entire region
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:12.400]  so we're just not good at this whole regime change nation building thing i think it's
[2:49:12.400 --> 2:49:16.960]  we shouldn't be in the business of doing it absolutely um i'm gonna we're gonna take a
[2:49:16.960 --> 2:49:22.800]  quick break uh but before we do i want to kind of give me a feel for what you would like the
[2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:29.920]  american public to learn from the the overarching uh uh takeaway that you would like them to learn
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:38.000]  from this book the convenient terrorist john uh joseph let's let me for me i just wanted to learn
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:43.040]  that you know everything we're told by our government is not necessarily true especially
[2:49:43.040 --> 2:49:50.000]  i mean that the last administration was obama's first uh i mean his first executive order was
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:57.440]  to close guantanamo me and nine soldiers went forward to his justice department to uh report
[2:49:57.440 --> 2:50:01.920]  abuses and deaths at guantanamo and he completely ignored it and we did that while we were in the
[2:50:01.920 --> 2:50:11.120]  military we took a huge risk um so i mean he was he his administration was so corrupt and he could
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:17.200]  have put an end to a lot of things that was going on but he and he said he would but in in the end
[2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:21.360]  he made it worse he made it worse for whistleblowers he came out and spoke about it yeah he went after
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:26.000]  whistleblowers and journalists worse than any president we've ever had he went after more than
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:32.160]  all the other presidents combined from the 1917 this ancient espionage act that he had and no matter
[2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:37.360]  what all these polls say people were sick of it and they wanted to blow the system up and that's
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:41.120]  what they did yeah yeah absolutely all right we've got one more segment stay with us we're
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:45.920]  gonna be right back uh the book is the convenient terrorist and we're talking to two whistleblowers

[2:54:16.320 --> 2:54:21.040]  john kiriyaku their book the convenient terrorist i want to get to john kiriyaku and ask him
[2:54:21.040 --> 2:54:28.000]  what his takeaway is we just got it from joseph hickman he said don't trust what the government
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:31.520]  is telling you he said look at what barack obama did he said he was going to shut down gitmo
[2:54:32.400 --> 2:54:37.920]  joseph hickman and other officers went there to talk to him to tell him the abuse that they
[2:54:37.920 --> 2:54:42.880]  were seeing there and of course he didn't do that he made it far worse than it had been before so

[2:55:38.320 --> 2:55:44.320]  back to uh john kiriyaku and i want to get that statement from you and then final comment from
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:49.600]  joseph hickman if you'd like to make a statement but what what is the key takeaway john that you
[2:55:49.600 --> 2:55:54.320]  would like for people to get from this book the convenient terrorist i think that the key takeaway
[2:55:54.320 --> 2:56:00.560]  is that the government is lying to us uh as a matter of course they lie to us because it's the
[2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:07.200]  only way that they can push their agenda um through public opinion and i think another thing
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:12.960]  david that that's very important is that as americans we need to demand accountability on
[2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:17.840]  capitol hill yes the congressional oversight committees are not really oversight committees
[2:56:17.840 --> 2:56:22.880]  they're cheerleading committees and we have to demand that they oversee the intelligence community
[2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:27.840]  like they were elected to do remember our congressional representatives work for us
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:34.080]  and if they don't like what we want them to do then we can throw them out as we should let me add
[2:56:34.080 --> 2:56:38.800]  to that too it may be absolutely furious when i watched the senate intelligence committee hearings
[2:56:38.800 --> 2:56:45.360]  and it was uh when they were talking to james comey absolutely glossed over all of their illegal
[2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:50.800]  involvement and already we had had the fiza court declassify information saying the nsa the fbi had
[2:56:50.800 --> 2:56:55.440]  violated the law had violated the constitution never going to hear that from the senate intelligence
[2:56:55.440 --> 2:57:01.360]  committee is always going to be uh politics and cheerleading for the intelligence community that's
[2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:05.920]  you're exactly right we cannot trust these people to act as overseers and that's the thing that's
[2:57:05.920 --> 2:57:11.600]  really scary about this when we look at the prol proliferation of intelligence community and the
[2:57:11.600 --> 2:57:16.720]  tools that they have the massive uh complicated tools that they have to essentially look to see
[2:57:16.720 --> 2:57:21.120]  if their lying narrative is working with us and then define tune it i think that's one of the big
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:27.600]  untold stories going on here any final comments uh joseph hickman no i just think i really hope
[2:57:27.600 --> 2:57:32.000]  people read the book and really get a better understanding of the deep state and how dangerous
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:38.480]  they really are and uh you know what what they're pulling over the american people's eyes well you
[2:57:38.480 --> 2:57:43.760]  know gentlemen you know as whistleblowers i have the utmost respect for you you uh told the truth
[2:57:43.760 --> 2:57:49.520]  you stood for the rule of law you stood for ethics and you did it at great personal risk and of
[2:57:49.520 --> 2:57:56.960]  course john you had to go to prison uh your book about how to do time like a spy i'm i hope that
[2:57:56.960 --> 2:58:00.560]  our audience doesn't need that but you know that's the sort of thing when i look at it
[2:58:00.560 --> 2:58:04.720]  when we have a government that is willing to break the law when we have a government that
[2:58:04.720 --> 2:58:08.160]  does not want to give people due process and we're seeing this on everything whether we're
[2:58:08.160 --> 2:58:12.320]  talking about civil asset forfeiture whether you're dealing with the irs or you're dealing with the
[2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:17.840]  f a a and you didn't get permission for your drone they don't give you due process anymore
[2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:24.640]  and uh that's that's the scary thing to think about how this can morph into a an area like
[2:58:24.640 --> 2:58:29.360]  we have seen foretold with the mdaa thank you so much gentlemen thank you for your service to

[3:00:22.960 --> 3:00:26.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and of course the breaking news that we've
[3:00:26.720 --> 3:00:33.920]  been covering in the beginning of the show as well is the continuing collapse of cnn it's it's
[3:00:33.920 --> 3:00:39.040]  gotten uh unprecedented levels the way they are collapsing and as president to trump pointed out
[3:00:39.040 --> 3:00:45.280]  cnn is not alone we've also had glenn greenwall point this out in the intercept that they're not
[3:00:45.280 --> 3:00:51.120]  alone giving a case study that you probably remember from just about six months ago where they were
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:58.320]  telling us putin has trying to hack our electric grid in reality all it was was one laptop that
[3:00:58.320 --> 3:01:03.360]  was an infected who knows how it got infected but one laptop infected with a single virus
[3:01:03.920 --> 3:01:08.640]  not connected to the grid in any way whatsoever not the local grid not the us national grid
[3:01:08.640 --> 3:01:16.480]  but they blew that into a story to try to create panic to try to push a russian narrative and cnn
[3:01:16.480 --> 3:01:22.720]  has now been caught at the end of last week with a deliberately fake story that was based
[3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:28.720]  simply on one single anonymous source how many times have we seen this from the washington post
[3:01:28.720 --> 3:01:35.040]  from the new york times by all of these jewel in the crown media that are supposed to be
[3:01:35.040 --> 3:01:39.680]  above reproach that we're supposed to be able to believe everything that they do and and we just
[3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:45.120]  saw this recently with the megan kelly and tom broke out they pulled him out of out of
[3:01:45.120 --> 3:01:52.080]  retirement to pontificate about how uh you know you just have to believe everything that mbc tells
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:59.440]  you well not exactly and we have a contest here from uh it's called uh cnn is fake news
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:06.240]  200 000 in cash prizes uh get on tv with a cnn is fake news sign or a t-shirt thousand
[3:02:06.240 --> 3:02:13.440]  dollar prize for anyone who's seen on tv with a sign legible or self-made t-shirt $2,500 prize
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:20.960]  if you're seen on television and also heard to say cnn is fake news info wars dot com is real so
[3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:25.680]  that's another contest that's been put out there this is what people need to understand they need
[3:02:25.680 --> 3:02:32.880]  to not be intimidated not be impressed by the brand name journalism because as we heard from
[3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:39.600]  james o' keith's undercover story today they know inside inside cnn they know that it is a witch hunt
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:45.760]  they know that it's not true and people like uh zucker who is running the organization it's telling
[3:02:45.760 --> 3:02:49.200]  them hey this is good for business let's uh forget these other stories let's get back on the russia
[3:02:49.200 --> 3:02:54.080]  thing this is starting to implode they have jumped the shark and we're going to talk a little bit
[3:02:54.080 --> 3:02:59.280]  more about that we're also going to take your calls and the number if you want to call in and
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:08.400]  talk about today's news let's see the number is 800 259 9231 that's 800 259 9231 here's some stories
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:12.640]  that are kind of off on the side but nevertheless important they're not on the main uh thrust of
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:20.800]  today's uh information a harvard study proves unvaccinated children pose no risk however vaccinated
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:27.440]  children do very interesting this is harvard study this is a woman who has a phd and immunology
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:31.280]  and she writes that do unvaccinated children pose a higher threat to the public than the
[3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:39.600]  vaccinated no they don't this is the uh herd immunity idea which is really just a herd mentality
[3:03:39.600 --> 3:03:48.560]  she said a person who is not vaccinated with ipv d t d tap uh hep b and hib vaccines due to reasons
[3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:55.040]  of conscience poses no extra danger to the public not a person who is no discrimination is warranted
[3:03:55.040 --> 3:04:00.000]  she points out and she goes on to say studies of mesal outbreaks in quebec canada and china
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:05.040]  attest to the outbreaks that outbreaks of measles still happen even when vaccination
[3:04:05.040 --> 3:04:11.920]  compliance is in the highest bracket that's 95 to 97 percent or even 99 percent and she gives
[3:04:11.920 --> 3:04:19.040]  sources she said this is because in high vaccine responders vaccine induced antibodies weighing
[3:04:19.040 --> 3:04:25.840]  over time because they're not the same as the antibodies you get when you have natural exposure
[3:04:25.840 --> 3:04:32.240]  in other words when you get measles as a child and i felt like i had measles again last week when i
[3:04:32.240 --> 3:04:37.280]  had a fever for about three half days i had a high fever that just wouldn't go away it was
[3:04:37.280 --> 3:04:42.400]  miserable and it reminded me when i had measles but that gave me lifetime immunity no matter
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:46.400]  how many vaccines i had i would not have that lifetime immunity and as a matter of fact she
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:52.880]  points out there's been several incidents where patient zero was somebody who was vaccinated
[3:04:53.600 --> 3:04:58.480]  incidents in quebec canada and in new york new york and we have caught covered these as well
[3:04:58.480 --> 3:05:04.000]  ourselves that's the truth of the matter stay with us we love the latest idea out of the e u
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:08.560]  scott keller a german member of the european parliament and of the green party so we should
[3:05:08.560 --> 3:05:13.920]  transplant entire villages from syria to germany and that would encourage more migrants to enter
[3:05:13.920 --> 3:05:19.840]  germany listen to these quotes the idea of syrian villages is only one possibility we can use for
[3:05:19.840 --> 3:05:24.320]  example if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees people would
[3:05:24.320 --> 3:05:29.760]  rather go where compatriots already live which makes integration and acceptance easier let's look
[3:05:29.760 --> 3:05:34.880]  at these three compatriots from paul joseph whatson sweden migrants viciously beat disabled man while
[3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:39.680]  calling him racist three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's wallet in
[3:05:39.680 --> 3:05:43.520]  a train station during an incident which took place last month the handicapped man was kicked and
[3:05:43.520 --> 3:05:47.600]  punched and received a vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on muslims
[3:05:47.600 --> 3:05:53.040]  and how all swedes were racist now how's that for acceptance you can read both articles now

[3:08:21.120 --> 3:08:25.040]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night and we're taking your phone calls we got several
[3:08:25.040 --> 3:08:31.440]  people who have lined up already the phone we got one slot left on the uh on the phone lines
[3:08:31.440 --> 3:08:36.160]  here i announced that in the last segment if you want to squeeze in there or jump in as people fall
[3:08:36.160 --> 3:08:44.160]  off the number is 800 259 9231 that's 800 259 9231 real quickly before i go to our phone calls
[3:08:44.880 --> 3:08:48.240]  rob do said to me the other day he says i'm surprised you haven't really covered this story
[3:08:48.240 --> 3:08:56.160]  because we've got this tragic collision at sea between a us military ship and a freighter
[3:08:56.880 --> 3:09:03.120]  and they were on autopilot at least the freighter was on autopilot the destroyer is supposed to have
[3:09:03.120 --> 3:09:10.560]  uh not only all of these redundant navigation radar systems and commercial radar systems but
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:17.200]  it's also supposed to have a human watch on the bridge at all time and yet here we have in the vast
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:24.320]  ocean we have two ships not passing in the night but bumping in the night uh we have seven sailors
[3:09:24.320 --> 3:09:30.720]  who died from this uh extensive damage to this very expensive ship and the thing that concerns
[3:09:30.720 --> 3:09:37.120]  people is the idea of military preparedness i mean are these military systems this is a military
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:42.720]  ship so it's obviously going to be a target of hostility a lot of people were kicking this back
[3:09:42.720 --> 3:09:47.280]  and forth on twitter as this story was starting to develop was this a terrorist attack did somebody
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:54.080]  take over uh the other ship and drive it into that one if they did why wasn't the u.s military
[3:09:54.080 --> 3:10:01.200]  ship able to detect that in time to do evasive maneuvers well what was going on with that so
[3:10:01.200 --> 3:10:04.720]  the people are passing this back and forth trying to figure out trying to make sense
[3:10:05.280 --> 3:10:09.600]  of this tragedy to make sure that this doesn't happen again because as I said the military ship
[3:10:09.600 --> 3:10:16.800]  it's going to be a target of people who are trying to attack it it isn't just a simple matter of
[3:10:16.800 --> 3:10:22.400]  having ships that are going to navigate on the ocean using autopilot but and and so I don't really
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:25.840]  understand all the different issues that are involved there again people are in the military
[3:10:25.840 --> 3:10:31.280]  people in the navy are talking about those issues I just look at it from the standpoint
[3:10:31.280 --> 3:10:37.600]  of an engineer who's concerned about self-driving cars for example if we can't have a couple of
[3:10:37.600 --> 3:10:45.680]  ships or even one ship uh if it's simply the fault of this freighter who's on autopilot and just
[3:10:45.680 --> 3:10:52.320]  t-bone this uh this military ship even if it was just the one and the other people were not able
[3:10:52.320 --> 3:10:57.920]  to detect it in time for whatever reason that's very troubling uh to not make evasive maneuvers
[3:10:58.720 --> 3:11:05.280]  isn't that doesn't that argue against us being able to effectively do that with big semi trailers
[3:11:05.280 --> 3:11:09.600]  we're told by Mercedes and other companies that hey in a year or two you know we've already done
[3:11:09.600 --> 3:11:16.000]  this we've traveled across country with our Mercedes auto truck or semi trailer and we don't
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:19.520]  need truck drivers anymore for long distance stuff we're going to be able to do that all with
[3:11:20.240 --> 3:11:26.880]  self-driving trucks when you look at the traffic density on our highways versus the ocean where
[3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:31.520]  you've got a couple of ships I talked to Eric Peters who does automobiles and he says you know
[3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:36.960]  they talk about this as being autopilot that's a a term they've lifted from airplanes that simply
[3:11:36.960 --> 3:11:43.040]  isn't the case when you've got automobiles I mean you've got airplanes they space the takeoff out
[3:11:43.040 --> 3:11:48.880]  they make sure that they're operating different levels of altitude so that they're not in conflict
[3:11:48.880 --> 3:11:53.440]  with each other you've got air traffic control that's monitoring it all the time and they they
[3:11:53.440 --> 3:11:58.000]  keep them vastly apart from each other as you would expect in the ocean and yet when you see
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:03.120]  something like this and the loss of life involved what are we setting ourselves up for and we've
[3:12:03.120 --> 3:12:09.280]  had a German company come out today saying you know Tesla's stock took a hit because they said
[3:12:09.280 --> 3:12:13.920]  this stuff is not trustworthy why are they pushing this they're pushing it because they
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:17.920]  have a different agenda and if we really want to know what this agenda is it's an agenda to
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:22.720]  take our freedom we've talked about this many times it is agenda 21 and when you look at what
[3:12:22.720 --> 3:12:27.520]  is happening in places like London for example we see these types of things coming in frequently
[3:12:27.520 --> 3:12:33.680]  they debut in the UK and London then they go to the next closest place which is California not
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:39.120]  geographically close but ideologically close and what they're doing right now is they're demonizing
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:45.440]  diesel we saw this being attempted by the EPA when I was the people that I was working with as I
[3:12:46.480 --> 3:12:52.560]  came here to info wars they were looking at Lisa Jackson who was then the head of the EPA
[3:12:52.560 --> 3:12:58.400]  talking to then congressman marky from massachusetts now senator and they were trying to put out the
[3:12:58.400 --> 3:13:04.000]  idea that millions of people were dying more people were dying from fine particulate matter
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:11.040]  that was coming out of diesel exhaust then we're dying from cancer a blatant lie that they were
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:14.800]  selling to the american people and yet at the same time they were saying that this was so deadly
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:19.200]  what were they doing right there in north carolina where I was living they were conducting
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:26.400]  experiments there with the EPA with the university there they were hooking people up to diesel exhaust
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:32.000]  they had run ads for people who had respiratory and heart disease they wanted to create an incident
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:38.800]  and they were exposing them to levels that were 72 times greater than what the EPA said were available
[3:13:38.800 --> 3:13:44.800]  why are they demonizing diesel why are they talking about taxing drivers by the mile we got the
[3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:51.280]  london mayor mayor con london drivers are facing britain's first paper mile road charge and a radical
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:58.080]  plan to cut car journeys by three million a day they do not want you moving around they do not
[3:13:58.080 --> 3:14:05.440]  want you having private transportation they want to capture you into their system that will be
[3:14:05.440 --> 3:14:12.080]  profited by a few well connected corporations and to get an idea of how this is going to break down
[3:14:12.080 --> 3:14:18.560]  another one from london a motorist 27 years old he was trying to get insurance for his car he lives
[3:14:18.560 --> 3:14:23.520]  in a poor area what we call public projects here in the united states a relative was going to sell
[3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:28.480]  him a car a Nissan for 250 pounds so I guess that's maybe what about 400 dollars here in the united
[3:14:28.480 --> 3:14:34.480]  states he could not get anybody to insure him he got two quotes one of them was for 16 000 pounds
[3:14:34.480 --> 3:14:41.680]  the other one was for 38 906 pounds and they're going to charge this guy like 45 000 a year
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:48.480]  insurance on a car that's worth maybe 400 a year so he can't drive that's the tool they will use to
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:56.480]  ban your ability to move yourself around and they're going to foist this autopilot technology
[3:14:56.480 --> 3:15:02.160]  that we've just seen here responsible for a collision at sea in the middle of the ocean
[3:15:02.160 --> 3:15:06.400]  you can't even get this stuff to reliably work that's the insanity that we're looking at here
[3:15:06.400 --> 3:15:10.960]  all right let's go to our callers here on hold let's go to steven and washington steven go
[3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:16.320]  ahead thank you for holding steven washington you there
[3:15:19.280 --> 3:15:22.960]  hello don't hear steven all right let's go to steven in florida

[3:15:37.920 --> 3:15:47.280]  pre interview what i called that uh debacle that you know meghan kelly had with alex on the phone
[3:15:48.080 --> 3:15:54.640]  and all anyone's gotta do is listen to that phone conversation and then watch what she put out there
[3:15:54.640 --> 3:16:01.680]  on nbc to see that she just blatantly lied through her teeth yes and so you know i was thinking about
[3:16:01.680 --> 3:16:06.960]  all that and i watched the uh you know alex with the shown the whole thing and you know there you
[3:16:06.960 --> 3:16:13.680]  guys commentary on that so i have a gift that i want to give alex in particular since he subjected
[3:16:13.680 --> 3:16:20.720]  himself to this for the sake of the truth but also to you guys with info wars as well as everything
[3:16:20.720 --> 3:16:26.560]  you're representing in this battle with these liars and it's what i call poetic justice the
[3:16:26.560 --> 3:16:32.160]  poem i wrote it's not real long and i hope you're listening to this and here's how it goes
[3:16:32.160 --> 3:16:39.760]  a criminal of old time is making a comeback machine gun kelly is on the loose and now on

[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:53.520]  a product right absolutely all right thanks for the point steven let's go to a brian in maryland
[3:17:53.520 --> 3:18:02.160]  go ahead a brian call yeah i'm calling about the whole whole situation with involving the uh
[3:18:02.880 --> 3:18:09.680]  the the uh the right they're about what happened for those who are more aware here we're about
[3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:16.880]  i think maybe like six six or so minutes no six days until that things happen i was like
[3:18:16.880 --> 3:18:22.560]  leave a comment on that the riots that are about to happen what are you i'm i'm not sure what i'm
[3:18:22.560 --> 3:18:31.680]  what you're talking about now somebody said that basically on um two divided second on sunday there
[3:18:31.680 --> 3:18:38.560]  was supposed to be the left is supposed to be holding some riot well you know we'll have to
[3:18:38.560 --> 3:18:44.240]  wait and see you know what a lot of times they've called for action and their call to action doesn't
[3:18:44.240 --> 3:18:49.920]  materialize you know occasionally they do get a a large turnout like they did the women against
[3:18:49.920 --> 3:18:56.640]  trump i think you know the day or so after the after the inauguration but most of them are
[3:18:56.640 --> 3:19:02.160]  basically non-entities they they don't have the kind of support that they would like for you to
[3:19:02.160 --> 3:19:08.480]  believe that they do so many times they've called for some kind of action and nobody turns up that's
[3:19:08.480 --> 3:19:13.360]  one of the key things about donald trump you know it's very rare to be able to turn out large crowds
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:19.200]  it's extremely rare i've covered politics all my life and it's it's very unusual for politicians
[3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:24.480]  running for a statewide office or even national office to be able to turn out crowds and it's
[3:19:24.480 --> 3:19:28.960]  unprecedented to see the kind of crowds that donald trump gets and so what you typically see happen is
[3:19:28.960 --> 3:19:34.960]  you see some uh hanger on some counter protesters they get a lot of attention from the mainstream
[3:19:34.960 --> 3:19:42.080]  media they move the cameras around in a way that gives them a larger appearance in terms of presence
[3:19:42.080 --> 3:19:46.800]  and then they get very violent and that's the thing that really makes their presence felt
[3:19:46.800 --> 3:19:58.000]  stay with us we'll be right back with more phone calls
[3:19:59.680 --> 3:20:04.880]  heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels

[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:30.880]  and meltdown of cnn their fake russian narrative we've also talked about nicky haley and mcmasters
[3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:38.080]  and other neocons inside the trump administration pushing a war with russia not just using it
[3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:43.360]  as a narrative to try to stymie the trump administration or to try to cover up the
[3:24:43.360 --> 3:24:48.080]  obama administration's illegal involvement using the intelligence community the law enforcement
[3:24:48.080 --> 3:24:53.760]  community as political part of their political campaign highly illegal that's the big story
[3:24:53.760 --> 3:24:58.880]  as rand paul and others have pointed out but even going beyond that nicky haley mcmasters others in
[3:24:58.880 --> 3:25:05.600]  the trump administration pushing regime change in syria not fighting isis and getting right
[3:25:05.600 --> 3:25:10.560]  to the brink of actual war with russia that's the danger that we're looking at here so if you
[3:25:10.560 --> 3:25:14.960]  want to call in and make some comments so we're taking phone calls here let's go to tucker in
[3:25:14.960 --> 3:25:22.800]  nebraska go ahead tucker yeah david how you doing doing good uh you know i was just thinking on that
[3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:28.480]  russia deal um you know with all the collusion and everything they've tried to uh prove against our
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:36.240]  president why do they not just go wholeheartedly after hillary and then let the real russian
[3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:41.760]  collusion unravel itself you know put one right against the other you know and watch them all
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:49.760]  squeal on one another i mean none of them have any any honor and if they could do that i believe
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:58.080]  that the real story will unravel itself through sources of news media such as yourselves and
[3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:03.120]  the people could get the real story what's going on and these people could finally be brought to
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:08.640]  justice because i think we're just all getting sick and tired of watching this story continue
[3:26:08.640 --> 3:26:15.280]  continue with this hope that these people are going to be brought to justice i mean these
[3:26:15.280 --> 3:26:23.520]  people try to bring down the united states of america that is treason yes yes well you know
[3:26:23.520 --> 3:26:28.400]  there actually may be a a case where they're going to be pitting one rat against the other
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:32.640]  because we've got uh james comey saying that loretta lynch told him to call it a matter
[3:26:32.640 --> 3:26:37.200]  tried to shut it down so basically what he did when his testimony was he called her out for
[3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:45.120]  uh trying to um uh obstruct justice and judge and pilot on a report on this a couple of days
[3:26:45.120 --> 3:26:49.680]  ago said that uh former attorney general lynch could face up to five years in prison we've had
[3:26:50.240 --> 3:26:55.440]  uh a couple of democrats come out i think it was uh adam schiff and i forget who the other one
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:26:58.880]  was was it nancy polosi the one they were interviewed they said well he actually makes
[3:26:58.880 --> 3:27:04.240]  this kind of queasy to see that i bet it does feinstein feinstein diane feinstein yeah made
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:11.520]  her queasy it made um adam schiff queasy and it should make them queasy because she broke the law
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:16.160]  now if they get the two of them going we've got comey who's testified multiple times he's he's a
[3:27:16.160 --> 3:27:23.120]  leaker he's testified uh contradicted himself under oath multiple times and uh so yeah they
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:27.840]  could start getting these people turned one against the other i i certainly hope that's going to be
[3:27:27.840 --> 3:27:33.520]  the case even hillary should still be in place she was never tried and found innocent we had
[3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:40.400]  somebody who is now uh been exposed as a political operative using his office as director of the
[3:27:40.400 --> 3:27:47.360]  fbi as a political operative that's the real story here we have the fiza court saying that the fbi
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:53.600]  and the nsa violated the law they released declassified their decisions so the american public would
[3:27:53.600 --> 3:27:57.920]  pay attention for the most part they're not we're reporting this but uh they're not getting any
[3:27:57.920 --> 3:28:02.400]  traction drudge reported it uh it was a circle report that went into detail as to what was
[3:28:02.400 --> 3:28:07.120]  released and drudge put that up we've talked about that multiple times and yet for the most
[3:28:07.120 --> 3:28:11.840]  part the mainstream media is not looking at the crimes of law enforcement and the intelligence
[3:28:11.840 --> 3:28:19.440]  community violating the law and using their powerful position as political operatives we've
[3:28:19.440 --> 3:28:24.160]  got senator grassley and others who are looking into this so this thing is not over yet yes people
[3:28:24.160 --> 3:28:29.680]  may be getting tired of it but i think it started to turn now we've got the democrats coming back
[3:28:29.680 --> 3:28:33.840]  and saying hey we're talking about this too much we've got cnn saying we're talking about this too
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:37.920]  much and we're telling lies and people are on to the lies that we're telling them so
[3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:43.200]  they're starting to back off this is the time we need to move ahead and we need to expose their
[3:28:43.200 --> 3:28:49.840]  criminal actions what do you think tucker yeah well i agree with you but you know um how do i
[3:28:49.840 --> 3:28:56.480]  as a private citizen um you know go about doing that what can i do i think a lot of us are just
[3:28:56.480 --> 3:29:03.840]  lost in uh in the realm of how do we put ourselves into this well let me tell you they they do they
[3:29:03.840 --> 3:29:08.480]  do follow what you do on social media when you pass this stuff around and you pass it to your
[3:29:08.480 --> 3:29:13.040]  friends or whatever whether twitter or facebook they're looking at that and it does make an effect
[3:29:13.040 --> 3:29:16.800]  with your with your friends as well but they're looking at that when they talk about the fact
[3:29:16.800 --> 3:29:21.360]  that they are not recording your conversations that they're more interested in the metadata
[3:29:21.360 --> 3:29:27.840]  they want to know what the hive mind is thinking is their narrative working or are they in trouble
[3:29:27.840 --> 3:29:33.760]  and if you put that out there that is a drop but it's a drop in a bucket that is filling up in a
[3:29:33.760 --> 3:29:38.480]  flood so it's very important for you to pass that information around pass those stories around
[3:29:38.480 --> 3:29:43.440]  help to wake people up that's an important thing that's why they follow the hive mind
[3:29:43.440 --> 3:29:47.520]  why they try to shut down social media so don't let them do that to you stay with us we'll be
[3:29:47.520 --> 3:29:54.320]  right back with more phone calls we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn
[3:29:54.320 --> 3:30:04.080]  radio network the struggle in the dnc fraud lawsuit continues you've had the current council for the
[3:30:04.080 --> 3:30:09.680]  plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness protection that notion was rejected despite three
[3:30:09.680 --> 3:30:15.520]  mysterious deaths of potential witnesses in the case seth riche shon lukas and barrenton wisenant
[3:30:15.520 --> 3:30:19.920]  junior there are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this case dropped
[3:30:19.920 --> 3:30:25.680]  entirely despite the obvious glaring issues that the dnc has had over the course of the last two
[3:30:25.680 --> 3:30:30.400]  years while the lawsuit represents bernie sanders supporters who feel they have been wronged by the
[3:30:30.400 --> 3:30:35.840]  dnc bernie sanders has fallen silent on the issue donald trump tweeted out this weekend
[3:30:35.840 --> 3:30:40.240]  hillary clinton colluded with the democrat party in order to be crazy bernie sanders is she allowed
[3:30:40.240 --> 3:30:45.120]  to collude unfair to bernie so now donald trump has done more to raise awareness for the dnc fraud
[3:30:45.120 --> 3:30:49.920]  lawsuit than bernie sanders has who actually is the one that had the election stolen from him
[3:30:49.920 --> 3:30:55.040]  why is bernie sanders silent on the issue maybe i guess he's busy with being investigated by the
[3:30:55.040 --> 3:31:00.800]  fbi for bank fraud for info wars dot com this is oan shroyer alex jones here to tell you about

[3:35:29.520 --> 3:35:34.400]  things i wanted to point out the first one i didn't know if you guys had covered was this last
[3:35:34.400 --> 3:35:43.120]  saturday the proud boys and we the people rising went to a maxine waters town hall event i didn't
[3:35:43.120 --> 3:35:49.520]  know if you guys had seen that at all no i didn't say what happened uh we showed up we protested
[3:35:49.520 --> 3:35:54.000]  the event and apparently scared her so bad that she stayed inside the building after the event
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:35:59.200]  afraid to come out for 20 minutes straight which was pretty hilarious to see her staff kept trying
[3:35:59.200 --> 3:36:04.720]  to juke us out bringing cars to each side of the building but we had every single exit surrounded
[3:36:04.720 --> 3:36:10.160]  waiting for raiding to confront her and when she finally came out she put a bag over the window she
[3:36:10.160 --> 3:36:14.320]  ran to the car put a bag over the window and then sped off as fast as she could it was beautiful to
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:20.560]  see uh you know that maxine is is quite a character um if we didn't have her we'd have to invent her
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:26.880]  wouldn't we i mean she's uh always good for a laugh maxine waters but uh there's a lot of people
[3:36:26.880 --> 3:36:32.400]  in the democrat party that take her seriously well thanks uh steven for doing that in and california
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:40.880]  let's go to um steven in arizona go ahead steven hey what's going on david hey i want to talk about
[3:36:41.440 --> 3:36:47.360]  i see where nikki haley said they're not going to stand by and let a a government spray chemicals
[3:36:47.360 --> 3:36:51.920]  on their people while i live in toon and they're spraying the hell out of me with their chemtrails
[3:36:51.920 --> 3:36:56.960]  down here that's right why don't they shut that down before they do anything else that's right
[3:36:56.960 --> 3:37:01.120]  yeah absolutely good good point good point yeah they're they're spraying the chemicals on they spray
[3:37:01.120 --> 3:37:05.520]  chemicals in our water too don't they but then they tell us oh it's good for us uh you know all
[3:37:05.520 --> 3:37:10.000]  that fluoride they put in there that that's great for us but you know uh that is that is i find that
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:14.960]  very concerning did you hear what we talked about earlier today the fact that you know of course uh
[3:37:14.960 --> 3:37:20.880]  when we look at uh seymour hersha's report about what happened it appears that it's a totally phony
[3:37:20.880 --> 3:37:25.600]  event just like it was four years ago we're disappointed to see that uh trump launched
[3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:30.240]  those missiles we talked about that a great deal at the time seymour hersha goes back and looks at it
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:36.560]  but as we look at that in context we see that that was right at the time we pointed it out
[3:37:36.560 --> 3:37:42.880]  that mic masters replaced flinn and the national security council and today we also learned that
[3:37:42.880 --> 3:37:50.880]  flinn was uh somebody who had gotten the ire of andrew mccabe the number two at the fbi at the
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:55.120]  time because he had sided with an individual who had worked in the intelligence community for quite
[3:37:55.120 --> 3:38:00.400]  some time went to work under andrew mccabe at the fbi and then started getting negative review she
[3:38:00.400 --> 3:38:06.560]  alleged that there was uh sexual harassment involved in that sexual discrimination and michael flinn
[3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:11.360]  took the unusual step of going to bat for her writing letters of recommendation for her getting
[3:38:11.360 --> 3:38:17.520]  the ire of andrew mccabe who began investigating her personally and then two years later began
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:23.280]  investigating in violation of the law because he had no search warrant uh investigating general
[3:38:23.280 --> 3:38:28.080]  flinn and getting him thrown out of office with allegations inside the trump administration of
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:33.920]  course that is a direct violation even of the powers that they presume to hold under the patriot
[3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:40.720]  act because they are prohibited from following a an american citizen on american soil they can
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:46.400]  only look at foreign citizens on foreign soil otherwise they need a search warrant
[3:38:46.400 --> 3:38:50.160]  and so they violated the law the fiza court has talked about that what do you think about
[3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:54.320]  everything that's happening with the syrian situation with nicky haley and others are you
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:39:00.000]  concerned about that oh yeah you know what we got with mccain head over there again are they
[3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:05.680]  launch another false flag for trump i'm sure he will you know the interesting thing i we didn't
[3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:11.600]  talk about today but there was a story that we didn't cover john mccain is basically having all
[3:39:11.600 --> 3:39:18.720]  the clinton foundation donors come over to his mccain foundation what a surprise you're there in
[3:39:18.720 --> 3:39:26.480]  arizona you're not surprised are you no yeah no that's very sad so yeah they better put he better
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:31.200]  go to sleep and say mccain needs to get down so we'll talk to you later david all right thank you
[3:39:31.200 --> 3:39:35.840]  so much steven in arizona let's go to uh johnny b in missouri go ahead johnny b
[3:39:37.520 --> 3:39:45.760]  hey afternoon david hey i'm on the uh torture subject yes you know how everybody shares the
[3:39:45.760 --> 3:39:54.240]  term flashback blowback blowback mm-hmm uh from the victims of the torture you know it's just
[3:39:54.240 --> 3:40:00.720]  a par for the course from an uh invading entity you're going to create enemies in the
[3:40:01.440 --> 3:40:07.840]  invading invading country that's right that's right you activate people who are not enemies
[3:40:07.840 --> 3:40:12.960]  before and you harden the resistance when you do this type of stuff that's one of the aspects
[3:40:12.960 --> 3:40:19.040]  yes that we we didn't really talk about that much go ahead he is missing and we really as
[3:40:19.040 --> 3:40:25.280]  americans we need to really start talking about this subject and i'm calling it uh over spray
[3:40:26.640 --> 3:40:35.040]  okay and what i'm talking about is where these uh these terror programs go out with any government
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:40.240]  government initiative you're going to create these cottage industries so we've got all this industry
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:48.000]  created behind torture unbelievable okay so now now that they've got the industry they've got to
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:54.240]  find customers so they bring it home domestically so we've got our law enforcement torturing the inmates
[3:40:55.200 --> 3:40:59.600]  by permission hey guys you know they're guilty they done something wrong or they wouldn't be in there
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:08.800]  that's right folks look up Schaefer Cox cox young man that come out back in 2009
[3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:20.240]  and very very charismatic christian-centered uh people gathering speaker uh justice department
[3:41:20.240 --> 3:41:26.160]  made him disappear he's 27 years he's got a daughter he only i don't think he's it well he
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:32.640]  might have got to see her in visitation but that's it so and that that's what i mean by over spray
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:37.760]  because we're creating this industry our our troops go out there and they're taught how to
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:42.560]  do it so they come home and well it'll work real good right here man let's let's torture this guy a
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:48.240]  little bit maybe we can find out where he got his drug from that's right you know we talk about uh
[3:41:48.960 --> 3:41:53.040]  when we talk about the military industrial complex of course what they have done is created a
[3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:59.120]  police state uh torture complex you know the the uh militarized police state that we have here
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:08.000]  that's a whole profit center for them and the only reason that this edifice to stupidity exist is
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:14.640]  because the american people are not in their proper position in this government overseeing our
[3:42:14.640 --> 3:42:24.480]  employees can i share a website david please sure go ahead tactical civics dot us it's so
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:30.720]  appropriate yeah and what does that cover we're covering american civics that hasn't been taught
[3:42:30.720 --> 3:42:35.920]  in this country in probably 180 years you know it's very important because when we look at what's
[3:42:35.920 --> 3:42:41.680]  happening in this country and we talk about the fact that uh we have the cia involved in illegal
[3:42:41.680 --> 3:42:48.400]  programs and they violate the law at will and that has spread its metastasized to our law
[3:42:48.400 --> 3:42:53.360]  enforcement we got the department of defense bringing in m-wraps remember all that that was the the
[3:42:53.360 --> 3:42:58.080]  the big rage talking about that how they were weaponizing the police departments how they're
[3:42:58.080 --> 3:43:03.760]  militarizing them how they were starting to operate as an occupying force and of course uh
[3:43:03.760 --> 3:43:08.560]  joe biggs and i went to one of the asymmetric warfare centers where they had built an american
[3:43:08.560 --> 3:43:13.920]  city where they could practice these types of tactics we have to understand that if they're
[3:43:13.920 --> 3:43:19.920]  going to militarize the police and do this largely because the military industrial complex needed
[3:43:19.920 --> 3:43:24.080]  another profit center and now of course they've also restarted the cold war so they get back
[3:43:24.080 --> 3:43:30.640]  their long range bombers their long range uh missiles that's a very big profit center uh
[3:43:30.640 --> 3:43:37.120]  they've got that going as well in addition to their entire terror industry that they're operating on
[3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:42.960]  but they're doing that in violation of our due process over and over again we don't have any
[3:43:42.960 --> 3:43:50.320]  rights when it comes to the massive amounts of law most of the law is set up as bureaucratic
[3:43:50.320 --> 3:43:56.240]  regulation and once they do it as bureaucratic regulation they can say that you're in violation
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:44:02.560]  of a civil law you get no presumption of innocence you get no trial by jury you don't get a trial
[3:44:02.560 --> 3:44:06.000]  at all as a matter of fact they don't even have to accuse you of anything we see this over and over
[3:44:06.000 --> 3:44:11.120]  again with civil asset forfeiture and the drug law they just take whatever they wish from you
[3:44:11.120 --> 3:44:15.600]  because no longer do we have the kinds of six amendment protections and they do that under
[3:44:15.600 --> 3:44:20.640]  the legal fiction of saying that these are not criminal laws they're civil laws and of course
[3:44:20.640 --> 3:44:24.320]  i'm sure that's probably something that you address at your site uh tactical civics
[3:44:26.880 --> 3:44:33.520]  we're we are doing our our level best to get the american people to realize that we've got an
[3:44:33.520 --> 3:44:42.640]  integral part to occupy a place to occupy in our government yes we haven't been there in like 180
[3:44:42.640 --> 3:44:47.280]  years guys come on but david you know there's one thing that you're missing there in your uh
[3:44:48.080 --> 3:44:54.240]  overlook of that situation is the version because now that we've got to this point where
[3:44:54.880 --> 3:45:00.960]  our federal services have stepped outside of any kind of oversight that's right they became a
[3:45:00.960 --> 3:45:08.000]  they become a global uh belligerent i mean they are totally belligerent globally yes i haven't
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:13.040]  seen any evidence with a friend they have anywhere on the field that's right yeah i agree well the
[3:45:13.040 --> 3:45:19.200]  only thing they need the only thing they need to do to keep this mechanism operating efficiently
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:27.520]  or semi efficiently is subversion yes like attacks uh well just one little piece of information
[3:45:27.520 --> 3:45:33.760]  and either not shared shared at the wrong time or fraudulent information begin with and that's
[3:45:33.760 --> 3:45:38.560]  all they got to do the system will take care of itself because so many people are ingrained
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:43.120]  well i gotta follow this rule man that's right and once you have some kind of a false flag attack
[3:45:43.120 --> 3:45:48.000]  or something that maybe is real and then they use that to panic the public and to say well now we
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:45:52.800]  need to uh implement these systems that we've already put in place absolutely great call thank
[3:45:52.800 --> 3:46:00.800]  you johnny let's go to joshua and ohio go ahead no i can you hear me david i hear you go ahead
[3:46:01.600 --> 3:46:08.000]  okay great uh basically i want to talk about uh getting out ahead of uh this next false flag uh
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:14.880]  we got the white house warning about how you know this is gonna happen and yes not amazing
[3:46:14.880 --> 3:46:19.680]  you know we should get out of this we got nicky hailey every time this woman opens her mouth it's
[3:46:19.680 --> 3:46:24.960]  an embarrassment uh maybe we could start some kind of campaign of fire hailey and higher
[3:46:24.960 --> 3:46:30.640]  custom i like tolsey gabbard that's actually been over there to syria yes talk to a side
[3:46:30.640 --> 3:46:36.960]  and uh knows the people on the ground and and has seen exactly how we're arming these radical
[3:46:36.960 --> 3:46:42.400]  suny g hotties and that's what i call them you can call them ices or al qaeda or al nurse or
[3:46:42.400 --> 3:46:48.640]  whatever you want to call them but they're suny g hotties that we should never uh be uh aligned
[3:46:48.640 --> 3:46:54.400]  with uh these should not be our allies and then our enemies are the ones that are fighting the
[3:46:54.400 --> 3:47:01.440]  radical suny g hotties and it's backwards and uh then i started looking into tillerson and uh the
[3:47:01.440 --> 3:47:08.960]  people who were uh involved in introducing him to trump after this last chemical attack or whatever
[3:47:08.960 --> 3:47:14.560]  it was and uh you got names popping up like condoleezza rice and uh steven hadley he's the director
[3:47:14.560 --> 3:47:23.680]  of rafion uh robert gates james baker and uh even more interesting uh rex tillerson's chief
[3:47:23.680 --> 3:47:29.600]  of staff is a lady by the name of margaret peterland uh now peterland for the last two years uh she
[3:47:29.600 --> 3:47:36.480]  worked at a uh company called xlp capital uh there with her employer matthew stack now these two
[3:47:36.480 --> 3:47:44.320]  individuals are uh involved in making the cyber warfare uh programs that were given to the
[3:47:44.320 --> 3:47:51.920]  cia to uh mimic foreign hackers to uh make it look like you know for their target that they came
[3:47:51.920 --> 3:47:58.160]  from oh you know say russia the type of stuff that we saw in bolt seven yeah right right yeah that
[3:47:58.160 --> 3:48:02.880]  came out in bolt seven and uh we got a lot of people behind the scenes that i think uh we really
[3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:08.560]  need to be beating the drum and exposing because you know how long is this neocon globalist agenda
[3:48:08.560 --> 3:48:14.320]  that's been going on for decades uh you know how long is this gonna last i agree you know and i was
[3:48:14.320 --> 3:48:19.760]  very concerned about rex tillerson in the beginning because i knew that he was for uh the uh the phony
[3:48:19.760 --> 3:48:26.000]  climate change stuff and he did fight for that but trump eventually shut him down and i think
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:30.480]  it's important that we realize that we can still have an effect on trump that's why i said before
[3:48:30.480 --> 3:48:34.880]  if you're a trump supporter need to remind president trump what candidate trump knew what
[3:48:34.880 --> 3:48:39.600]  candidate trump said what candidate trump had tweeted about three years you need to remind
[3:48:39.600 --> 3:48:46.720]  him about uh the the futility of these regime changes you need to remind him how uh the american
[3:48:46.720 --> 3:48:52.320]  government lied to us to get us involved in iraq and as you point out you know take a look at
[3:48:52.320 --> 3:48:59.280]  nikki haley uh perhaps she was there as an olive branch to uh some of the establishment republicans
[3:48:59.280 --> 3:49:06.000]  but we need to make sure that she is contained and i i think you do whatever you can talk on
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:10.560]  social media send stuff to donald trump i think that he is an honest for even when we disagree
[3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:15.840]  with him i think he is open to hearing these types of suggestions if he hears them in massive
[3:49:15.840 --> 3:49:20.560]  numbers from people i think he will listen uh he did do the right thing with climate change it took
[3:49:20.560 --> 3:49:23.920]  a while and i was concerned about it because the pressure that's being put on him by his daughter
[3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:29.200]  by rex tillerson but he did the right thing he got out of the paris accord and so the people
[3:49:29.200 --> 3:49:33.040]  who are in the trump administration who want to do the right thing and donald trump who knows
[3:49:33.040 --> 3:49:37.040]  what the right thing is but is getting pressured from the other people if we don't pressure him
[3:49:37.040 --> 3:49:41.760]  he's only going to get pressured from one side and that's going to possibly turn him around so
[3:49:41.760 --> 3:49:45.520]  it's very important for you to speak out i absolutely agree with what you had to say but i
[3:49:45.520 --> 3:49:50.560]  think we can all play a part in this thank you joshua let's go to russell and alaska go ahead russell
[3:49:50.560 --> 3:49:58.720]  yeah hi davin hi hello yes go ahead yeah hold on one second i'm sorry
[3:49:59.440 --> 3:50:07.040]  i uh okay we got you i'm talking about the da uh i know that there's a lot of important things
[3:50:07.040 --> 3:50:11.840]  going on right now with russia and you know north korea and all these other places but one of the
[3:50:11.840 --> 3:50:18.800]  things that we're not talking about is uh the veterans affairs and uh a article just came
[3:50:18.800 --> 3:50:27.360]  out on the 23rd at military times dot com talking about them wanting to redo the veterans disabilities
[3:50:27.360 --> 3:50:34.480]  and everything else like that and i don't know if i am i still here yes you are go ahead okay um
[3:50:34.480 --> 3:50:39.120]  and they're talking about rechanging the entire system well you know there are a lot of veterans
[3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:44.960]  that rely heavily on veterans affairs and everything that they get from the va and now
[3:50:44.960 --> 3:50:48.880]  we're talking about oh well it's unsustainable and the article talks about being unsustainable
[3:50:48.880 --> 3:50:52.080]  well that's great hang on we gotta take a quick break we're gonna hang on through the break we'll

[3:54:40.880 --> 3:54:47.040]  the fourth of july as part of our special and let's go back to russia and alaska russia you
[3:54:47.040 --> 3:54:51.680]  were talking about veteran affairs of course we've had a lot of problems with the va not serving
[3:54:51.680 --> 3:54:56.560]  veterans very well you said they've got major changes and the pipeline you're concerned that
[3:54:56.560 --> 3:55:02.240]  maybe there's too much that's changing is that your concern yeah but that is my concern and the
[3:55:02.240 --> 3:55:07.120]  name of the actual article is from the military times.com it's va chief time to rethink disability
[3:55:07.120 --> 3:55:12.000]  system the current setup not sustainable my problem is is that you can sustain ebt you can
[3:55:12.000 --> 3:55:18.640]  sustain welfare but you can't sustain a system for people that wrote a blank check for their country
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:24.480]  you understand yes wrong and it needs you need to stop looking at our veterans to keep taking hits
[3:55:24.480 --> 3:55:28.480]  i'm a veteran myself my wife's a veteran i'm actually sitting at the anchorage va right now
[3:55:28.480 --> 3:55:32.160]  because she's in an appointment but you have veterans that are literally a hundred percent
[3:55:32.160 --> 3:55:38.000]  disabled that cannot do anything anymore and you're talking about lowering what they get
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:43.440]  or making it more difficult for them to get to get things you know it's i think you're gonna
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:46.960]  i think you're gonna find that trump is very sympathetic to that i think you've got a big
[3:55:46.960 --> 3:55:51.520]  advocate of trump there may be some people inside the administration who are pushing other policies
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:55.680]  but like we saw with climate change even though we had secretary of state and his daughter pushing
[3:55:55.680 --> 3:56:00.640]  to stay in the paris agreement uh he ultimately did the right thing so i think he's going to be on
[3:56:00.640 --> 3:56:04.240]  on your side on that but that's again that's something that you're going to need to speak up
[3:56:04.240 --> 3:56:08.880]  and you're going to need to make sure that president trump uh sticks with candidate trump i think
[3:56:08.880 --> 3:56:12.720]  that's a very important point to make i only could some of the other people that are on hold
[3:56:12.720 --> 3:56:17.680]  thank you russell uh good luck with that let's talk to wake up 1442 go ahead wake up
[3:56:19.600 --> 3:56:25.680]  i i want to talk about uh the the fbi has become criminalized that the the cia has
[3:56:25.680 --> 3:56:32.240]  uh taught them their gladio techniques so and used them in in uh to affect the political
[3:56:32.240 --> 3:56:41.360]  elections that there's one uh one operative uh bill fulton who uh was a fbi undercover operative who
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:50.720]  got a job with uh joe miller's campaign in alaska and uh handcuffed a reporter to disgrace
[3:56:50.720 --> 3:56:56.560]  joe miller's campaign so we lost and that same uh bill fulton is the one who threatened to kill
[3:56:56.560 --> 3:57:06.560]  schaefer cox and uh that the um the uh the the prosecutor steve schrocky told the jury
[3:57:06.560 --> 3:57:10.960]  that there was no they could listen to hours and hours of pace and they would not find anywhere
[3:57:10.960 --> 3:57:18.720]  where um bill fulton threatened to kill schaefer cox but there's on the on the youtube there are
[3:57:18.720 --> 3:57:22.960]  several places where you can see there that that's uh bill fulton this threatening to kill
[3:57:22.960 --> 3:57:27.840]  schaefer cox and that that is why uh schaefer cox was arrested because he was trying to flee the
[3:57:27.840 --> 3:57:33.760]  country because he didn't know that bill fulton was an fbi undercover operator but he he knew that
[3:57:33.760 --> 3:57:40.800]  that bill fulton had told him that he would kill him if he showed up for his um um his his his uh
[3:57:40.800 --> 3:57:44.720]  trial well you know there's a lot of information that's coming out about the fbi not only do we
[3:57:44.720 --> 3:57:49.840]  see what komi did in terms of giving a pass to hillary clinton and the many other things acting
[3:57:49.840 --> 3:57:55.440]  as a leaker this is a guy who came to the fbi position from being on the board of hsbc an
[3:57:55.440 --> 3:58:00.240]  organization that was convicted multiple times even after they'd been put on probation and given a
[3:58:00.240 --> 3:58:04.880]  fine they did it again laundering money for drug cartels for terrorist organizations so they pick
[3:58:04.880 --> 3:58:08.640]  a guy from the board or directors of that organization become fbi director then we learned
[3:58:08.640 --> 3:58:15.200]  today that andrew mccabe appeared to have a personal vendetta against uh mike flinn and we know that
[3:58:15.200 --> 3:58:19.440]  the phisa court has said that the fbi violated the law in terms of exposing individuals so we
[3:58:19.440 --> 3:58:24.480]  know that they're operating in a political mode i would even suggest uh the situation with uh
[3:58:24.480 --> 3:58:29.840]  christopher steele and the dirty dossier james komi appears to have involvement in that and people
[3:58:29.840 --> 3:58:34.480]  in congress are taking a look at it thank you so much that's it for today's show join us again
[3:58:34.480 --> 3:58:39.120]  tomorrow alex jones will be back info wars nightly news tonight at 7 central 8 p.m. east
