[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.640]  It would take hours to go over all the evidence, which proves that the attack on September
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.200]  11th, 2001 was an inside job, and I suggest you look into it if you haven't already.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.900]  But to simplify the situation, all you need to do is look at Building 7.
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.260]  What some people still don't realize is that there were three buildings that fell into
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.420]  their own footprint that day.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.600]  Three buildings that fell at free fall speed, indistinguishable from controlled demolitions,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.740]  because that's exactly what they were.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.500]  As the towers came crashing down, we can see the signatures of a controlled demolition.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.540]  The official story is that Building 7, known as 7 World Trade Center, caught fire as a
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.140]  result of debris from the Twin Towers, which somehow caused a critical internal column
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.100]  to break, causing a cascading failure and collapse.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.300]  And if this nonsensical official narrative were true, it would make it the first and
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.700]  only steel skyscraper in the world to collapse from fires.
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.700]  The building's owner, Larry Silverstein, took control of the Twin Towers just weeks
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.440]  before 9-11, and had them insured to cover terrorist attacks.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.440]  After Building 7 collapsed, Silverstein told the media that the decision was made to pull
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.640]  it, suggesting that the building was collapsed on purpose.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:49.680]  This
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.360]  implies that they somehow rigged the explosives that afternoon, while the building was still
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.440]  burning, which is ridiculous.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.120]  And so the media dismissed his comments and changed their story.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.080]  There were several witnesses who reported hearing and feeling the type of explosions
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:28.360]  one would expect from a controlled demolition.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.360]  I think I know an explosion when I hear it.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.360]  Do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse?
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.680]  To me it sounded like an explosion.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:03:02.240]  The explosions were captured on video.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:31.640]  Most responders were told that the building was going to be blown up.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.200]  The BBC reported, live on air, that the building already collapsed before it did.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:59.080]  Television viewers could see it in the background, still standing.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.000]  And the investigation never even investigated for explosives.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.200]  The Republican White House then signed into law the Patriot Act, which allowed-
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.480]  I'm only interrupting this important Gregory's report because I urge you, I urge you to
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.760]  go to band.video, download it, share it, spread it as we are on the eve of the anniversary
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.760]  of 9-11.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.160]  Now certainly there's going to be more coverage of this and more flashbacks of what
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.680]  really went down that day.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.440]  But the reason why this is so important is more people are willing to question official
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.800]  narratives, government narratives, and are skeptical or outright distrusting of the government
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.160]  now more than ever before.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.760]  And so a lot of people that might have never believed or always believed what they
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.760]  told about 9-11 now, they might never believe it.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.920]  So now is the time, folks.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.480]  Share that video at band.video from the Reese report.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.480]  Very important.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.960]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.800]  really, really, really, really, really good news because it's a great product you
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.480]  love and people want it and it funds our operation at 360 Wind.

[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.600]  a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your neurological
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600]  system.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.600]  You name it.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.080]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.080]  God gave it to us.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.480]  And it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.020]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.480]  Most brands are 5% human.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.520]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.320]  This is the strongest anybody makes 95% for humanoid.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.920]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.560]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.040]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.

[00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:17.111]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups, you want to stop tyranny, well
[00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:28.150]  so does he, live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones and now your host Owen Troyer.
[00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:36.911]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a distinct honor and privilege to be here with you tonight on
[00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:45.231]  this Sunday, September 10th, 2023 live transmission from the info wars world headquarters in Austin,
[00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:46.231]  Texas.
[00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:53.010]  Such an honor, such a privilege, really I can't even put it into words, but the fact
[00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:59.671]  that we're still here is a victory in and of itself.
[00:06:59.671 --> 00:07:04.770]  Now I am going to be with you, the info wars audience for the next four hours, we'll be
[00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.851]  hosting the Alex Jones show, I'm going to tell you what I have coming up on the Alex
[00:07:08.851 --> 00:07:14.731]  Jones show, all the important news, all the important video clips.
[00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:19.251]  And then for Sunday night live, we're going to have a lot of important and special guests
[00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:24.411]  coming up, Christy Lee with a big report, Chris Emery with a big report, and then
[00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:32.091]  an individual that they call the Russian Alex Jones, oh the Russian Alex Jones, duh.
[00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.991]  So that's going to be coming up for you tonight.
[00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:43.131]  Four hours, live info wars transmissions, buckle up.
[00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:48.530]  Now let me lay out all the news that we're going to be covering in the two hours of
[00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.570]  the Alex Jones show.
[00:07:52.570 --> 00:08:04.650]  First off and foremost, you know there was one man who warned us all what was coming.
[00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:13.291]  And now today, the very cornerstones, the very foundations of the United States of America
[00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:21.570]  are being not just chipped away at, but I mean hacked away at, I mean demolished
[00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.570]  so that the entire country will fall.
[00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.551]  What am I talking about?
[00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:33.251]  I'm talking about the first amendment, and I'm talking about the second amendment.
[00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:40.651]  And the direct assault on these cornerstones of our republic could not be more clear
[00:08:40.651 --> 00:08:45.151]  and present than they are today.
[00:08:45.151 --> 00:08:51.731]  Now I'm not just talking about local issues that I can discuss later.
[00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:59.931]  I'm talking about even now, the Fifth Circuit Court, the Washington Post, Washington
[00:08:59.931 --> 00:09:10.131]  Post forced to admit that the Biden administration violated the first amendment.
[00:09:10.131 --> 00:09:12.290]  Think about that.
[00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.451]  Just take a second.
[00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:21.570]  The Washington Post forced to admit that the Biden administration violated the first
[00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.651]  amendment.
[00:09:23.651 --> 00:09:33.011]  Free speech, a cornerstone of our republic.
[00:09:33.011 --> 00:09:41.651]  That is equivalent to the Democrats, the Biden administration, the federal government
[00:09:41.651 --> 00:09:47.471]  putting a stick of dynamite, no, 10 million sticks of dynamite under the foundations,
[00:09:47.471 --> 00:09:58.011]  the cornerstones of this country and lighting them up.
[00:09:58.011 --> 00:09:59.810]  But that's not all.
[00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:05.851]  Of course, we know the Democrats are also after your second amendment.
[00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:14.591]  And the latest attack on the second amendment is so aggressive and so obscene that even
[00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:21.651]  some of the most far left radical Democrats like Ted Lieu and activists like David Hogg
[00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:26.570]  are even saying, whoa, this might be too far.
[00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:32.651]  David Hogg supporting the second amendment, Ted Lieu supporting the second amendment.
[00:10:32.651 --> 00:10:34.171]  What have the Democrats done?
[00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:36.611]  Well, I'll tell you.
[00:10:36.611 --> 00:10:41.531]  So first amendment under complete assault, second amendment under complete assault.
[00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:50.651]  Now that right there alone, I should spend four hours on that.
[00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:55.851]  Political activists from the left, political activists from the right, journalists, activists,
[00:10:55.851 --> 00:11:01.290]  everybody center, right, middle, up, down, left, sideways, cross-eyed, blue, black, green,
[00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.531]  yellow, red, polka dot, white, everything.
[00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:06.330]  This impacts all of us.
[00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.851]  This is, I mean, like red alert, red alert, red alert.
[00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:16.290]  The sirens are going off.
[00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.330]  The British are coming.
[00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.851]  The British are coming.
[00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:24.711]  But see, it's like we're so numb to it.
[00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:31.111]  We've been so sedated by the entertainment, by the culture, by the constant attacks.
[00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:35.871]  And now the chilling on free speech and just the chilling of any political activity
[00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:41.511]  that it's just like, oh, oh, did you hear, did you hear the Democrats are coming
[00:11:41.511 --> 00:11:42.511]  for the first amendment?
[00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:44.511]  Did you hear the Democrats coming for the second amendment?
[00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:51.790]  You got to like, oh, oh, really?
[00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.790]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:57.310]  It's kind of like, oh, Biden trying to start world war with Russia, kind of a big deal.
[00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.471]  Oh, but Elon Musk is the bad guy because he's trying to stop it.
[00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:04.391]  And we'll have that for you, by the way.
[00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:10.151]  And it all ties in because Elon Musk is confronting the Democrats on their attacks
[00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:13.351]  on free speech.
[00:12:13.351 --> 00:12:20.471]  And he has angered the military industrial complex because he's not, he's decided he's
[00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:27.951]  not going to be a part of increasing or escalating the war in Ukraine.
[00:12:27.951 --> 00:12:34.231]  Who knows how many lives were saved because of Elon Musk's decision not to expand the
[00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:42.790]  star link connections so that the Ukrainians could attack Russians and kill them.
[00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.631]  But see, our political class is so psychotic.
[00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:49.091]  Mitt Romney said it last week.
[00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:50.231]  We played the clips all week.
[00:12:50.231 --> 00:12:54.231]  He said, it's a good thing that people are dying in Ukraine.
[00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:55.231]  What?
[00:12:55.231 --> 00:12:58.431]  Well, first he said, oh, no one's dying in Ukraine.
[00:12:58.431 --> 00:13:00.231]  And he met no Americans.
[00:13:00.231 --> 00:13:04.351]  But then he said, it's a good thing Ukrainians and Russians are dying for our foreign policy.
[00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:09.031]  What a sick, psychotic person would think like that somebody completely disconnected
[00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:12.070]  from humanity and God.
[00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.911]  But let me just pause and tell you what else we got coming up.
[00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:16.611]  But it's like just right there.
[00:13:16.611 --> 00:13:19.911]  That's four hours of transmissions right there.
[00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:22.031]  First and second amendment under complete assault.
[00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:25.631]  Very foundations of our country, the cornerstones of our Republic.
[00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:31.151]  And then you've got the whacked out psychotic military industrial complex with all of its
[00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:35.731]  weapons contractors and all of its bought and paid for politicians pushing to start
[00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:40.191]  a war with Russia that could in the end, kill millions of people, a billion people
[00:13:40.191 --> 00:13:41.191]  who knows.
[00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:43.851]  I mean, what did Albert Einstein say?
[00:13:43.851 --> 00:13:46.271]  World War three would be fought with nuclear weapons.
[00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:49.351]  World War four would be fought with sticks and stones.
[00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:51.790]  That's how far this would set humanity back.
[00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.330]  But these politicians in DC, they love it.
[00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.591]  And the Democrats love it too.
[00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:59.451]  Oh, and it's so perfect.
[00:13:59.451 --> 00:14:00.451]  It's so perfect.
[00:14:00.451 --> 00:14:01.931]  We'll play this clip today.
[00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:11.351]  Woody Harrelson was asked about the war in Ukraine and his response was just perfect.
[00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.731]  So we'll play that for you today.
[00:14:12.731 --> 00:14:16.351]  But OK, because there's other news.
[00:14:16.351 --> 00:14:17.351]  Let's see.
[00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:26.771]  Joe Biden is saying we need to have a strong border, but not not the Mexico U.S. border.
[00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:30.391]  Joe Biden wants the border to be Texas.
[00:14:30.391 --> 00:14:34.151]  And now the Biden administration is proposing that every illegal immigrant comes in, has
[00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:38.271]  to stay in Texas, and they want to put ankle monitors on them to make sure they
[00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:39.271]  can't leave Texas.
[00:14:39.271 --> 00:14:44.191]  Well, gee, why would they want to do that?
[00:14:44.191 --> 00:14:47.310]  All these sanctuary cities that now say we can't handle the illegal immigrants.
[00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.151]  Oh, but Texas can.
[00:14:51.151 --> 00:14:53.271]  They're not trying to turn Texas blue, though.
[00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:54.271]  Of course not.
[00:14:54.271 --> 00:14:57.931]  No, they've done the political math, folks.
[00:14:57.931 --> 00:15:02.891]  If the Democrats turn Texas blue, they know that I mean, that's like if you're playing
[00:15:02.891 --> 00:15:07.671]  a game of basketball in the NBA and you and your team gets to start with 100 points
[00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:13.110]  before every game, I mean, the average NBA team probably scores like 101 points per
[00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.110]  game.
[00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.911]  Let's start with 100.
[00:15:15.911 --> 00:15:22.151]  Oh, we've got the Democrats starting a new holiday, Transgender History Month.
[00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:23.310]  Did you hear about that?

[00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:42.031]  And then just all kinds of news, all kinds of video clips.

[00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:01.491]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:03.451]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:17:03.451 --> 00:17:07.171]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated, but some of their operations
[00:17:07.171 --> 00:17:09.131]  are going to take decades to stop.
[00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:13.251]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:18.011]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with and you do it with

[00:17:53.331 --> 00:17:55.691]  us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:17:55.691 --> 00:18:00.131]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:18:00.131 --> 00:18:06.811]  Omega three fatty acids are needed for optimal strength and they can only be obtained
[00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:08.311]  through diet.
[00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:13.231]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:14.231]  it.
[00:18:14.231 --> 00:18:20.471]  They can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega threes, but the
[00:18:20.471 --> 00:18:25.031]  problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:06.931]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:31.570]  You know it's an interesting day on this Sunday because most of America is still in a trance.
[00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:36.969]  And the proof of this would be the fact that, and I'm sure I haven't seen the numbers, but
[00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:44.330]  I'm sure many Americans, probably millions of Americans, are innocently, ignorantly,
[00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.610]  in their trance, tuned in, watching football today.
[00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.330]  And who can blame them, it's fun, and they're in their trance, they don't know any better.
[00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:57.449]  But it's the allegory of the cave.
[00:20:57.449 --> 00:21:04.330]  As you're sitting here staring at the shadows being cast for you to be entranced by, you're
[00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:09.370]  getting ripped up, shredded, stabbed, and mutilated from behind.
[00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.649]  And that's what's going on today.
[00:21:13.649 --> 00:21:17.770]  Sure it's nice, football's back on the air, that's great.
[00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.129]  But did you know that your country's under attack?
[00:21:20.129 --> 00:21:24.810]  And there won't be any football anymore if they're successful.
[00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.169]  You understand?
[00:21:27.169 --> 00:21:28.169]  Remember the lockdowns?
[00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:32.729]  That'll be permanent.
[00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:39.449]  You know the very cornerstones of our republic are under assault today.
[00:21:39.449 --> 00:21:41.929]  And how about I do a little bookends here?
[00:21:41.929 --> 00:21:53.689]  Let me just read to you, in case anybody needed a reminder, this is the First Amendment.
[00:21:53.689 --> 00:21:59.570]  From the Constitution of the United States, the First Amendment, I read directly.
[00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:04.570]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:10.889]  thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people
[00:22:10.889 --> 00:22:19.850]  peacefully to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:26.330]  That is your First Amendment, your birthright, freedom of speech, number one cornerstone
[00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.330]  of our republic.
[00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.290]  How about the Second Amendment?
[00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:36.409]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:41.850]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, shall not be
[00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.209]  infringed.
[00:22:44.209 --> 00:22:49.889]  These are unalienable rights.
[00:22:49.889 --> 00:22:52.050]  Now does it seem like people take this seriously?
[00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.850]  Does it seem like our own government politicians take these seriously anymore?
[00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:01.250]  Well, let's review.
[00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.730]  This is all breaking right now.
[00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:15.929]  Now I have decided to give you first the Washington Post headline, Washington Post.
[00:23:15.929 --> 00:23:19.709]  Why do I decide to read the Washington Post first?
[00:23:19.709 --> 00:23:22.330]  Everybody knows this is a Democrat rag.
[00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:29.550]  Everybody knows this is a globalist rag, a propaganda outlet, and even they have to
[00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:36.350]  admit with their headline this morning, Fifth Circuit rules, Biden administration
[00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:43.870]  violated the First Amendment, Washington Post.
[00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.590]  The three judge panel found that contacts with tech companies by officials from the
[00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:55.550]  White House, the Surgeon General's Office, the CDC, and the FBI likely amounted to coercion.
[00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.550]  Likely.
[00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.310]  Yeah, they just demanded stories get censored.
[00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.230]  And they thought they could play this little game.
[00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.429]  And they'd say, oh, we're just going to have a portal.
[00:24:06.429 --> 00:24:11.750]  And we're going to submit stories and headlines and narratives to a portal.
[00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.469]  And that's just a suggestion, yeah.
[00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:19.189]  And then when Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and all the other mainstream social media
[00:24:19.189 --> 00:24:27.669]  companies acted on those, quote unquote, suggestions, that's just that's just their free speech.
[00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:29.389]  There's no coercion.
[00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:31.790]  Nobody's buying that.
[00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:36.590]  Now there's another element to this, which I think will be developed later.
[00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.550]  So then if it's true that the federal government and the Biden administration and
[00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:46.350]  the Democrats violated the First Amendment and censored speech on the Internet, well,
[00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:52.030]  then what happened when Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg and their lawyers and everybody
[00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:57.230]  else went under oath and said it never happened?
[00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.429]  They said under oath they never censored at behest of the U.S. government.
[00:25:01.429 --> 00:25:04.290]  That was a lie.
[00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.969]  When is that going to be re-litigated?
[00:25:05.969 --> 00:25:07.110]  But that's for the future.
[00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:12.469]  Now, Jamie White from Infowars has compiled a bunch of different headlines in regards
[00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:14.790]  to this story.
[00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:19.949]  From past to present, Biden officials likely violated First Amendment on social media,
[00:25:19.949 --> 00:25:24.709]  according to Fifth Circuit Court, and then he's compiled all the different headlines
[00:25:24.709 --> 00:25:27.790]  admitting this and then all the different headlines.
[00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:33.550]  From the past, with the emails and everything else that proved, nope, this is exactly
[00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.550]  what they did.
[00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.669]  Right there at Infowars.com.
[00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.989]  So there you go.
[00:25:39.989 --> 00:25:45.429]  That's your First Amendment.
[00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:48.750]  Under attack, a cornerstone of our republic by the Democrat Party.
[00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.709]  And then there's the Second Amendment.
[00:25:52.709 --> 00:25:55.989]  I guess first, let's go to the short clip.
[00:25:55.989 --> 00:25:57.750]  We do have the longer clip for context.
[00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.189]  We can play it later, but let's first go.
[00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.989]  This is Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham.
[00:26:02.989 --> 00:26:08.909]  And listen to what she thinks about the Second Amendment here and clip 17.
[00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:13.350]  If I can turn down the temperature, you know, it's not illegal for a young person
[00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:18.870]  to have an automatic weapon, just a handgun, I can't arrest that person.
[00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:25.590]  If we tell the bad actors and I realize it's a pinch and then some on responsible
[00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:26.590]  gun owners.
[00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.110]  I'm clear it is.
[00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:35.030]  It's a sacrifice that allows everyone else to get their arms around a growing significant
[00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.750]  problem.
[00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.550]  Well let's listen to the logic here.
[00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:44.949]  I'm just going to politely ask criminals to stop committing crimes and every law abiding
[00:26:44.949 --> 00:26:50.989]  citizen that suffers because of this, that's just the price to pay.
[00:26:50.989 --> 00:26:53.870]  Second Amendment be damned.
[00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.389]  Do you believe you have the right to self-defense?
[00:26:56.389 --> 00:27:00.909]  If somebody comes in your house to rob you, kill you, rape you, do you believe you have
[00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:05.149]  the right to defend yourself by whatever means possible?
[00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:06.149]  Democrats don't.
[00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:10.570]  Oh, maybe you can throw a ice cube at them.
[00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.030]  Maybe you've got some hot water on the stove made by some chance.
[00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.270]  Maybe you've got a fire extinguisher.
[00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.270]  That'll be fine.
[00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.989]  Eh, throw a pillow at them.
[00:27:17.989 --> 00:27:21.709]  Please criminals, stop committing crimes.
[00:27:21.709 --> 00:27:26.270]  New Mexico governor issues 30 day ban on carrying guns in public.
[00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:31.389]  New Mexico governor announces she's unilaterally suspending the right to carry firearms in
[00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:34.290]  Albuquerque.
[00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.790]  And this is such an egregious offense.
[00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:42.790]  This is so clear and present against the Second Amendment that even Democrats are saying,
[00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:46.429]  whoa, I mean, hey, we're not supposed to come out and say this.
[00:27:46.429 --> 00:27:49.929]  Like hey, we are trying to take their guns just like Hitler, just like Stalin, just
[00:27:49.929 --> 00:27:51.989]  like Pol Pot, just like Mao.
[00:27:51.989 --> 00:27:53.389]  But we don't tell them that.
[00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:57.310]  It's kind of like the Project Veritas videos with James O'Keefe and others where they have
[00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.909]  Democrats on record saying, yeah, we definitely want to end the Second Amendment, but we would
[00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:07.730]  never have that as a public policy, public statement because that's not very popular.
[00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:12.350]  New Mexico lawmakers call for governor's impeachment over 2A overreach.
[00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.350]  Far left radical David Hogg says she's gone too far.
[00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.030]  Far left Democrat Ted Lieu says she's gone too far.
[00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:23.370]  This isn't the only time, by the way, that this Democrat governor has been in the headlines
[00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:24.850]  for corruption.
[00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:29.969]  Flashback, New Mexico Governor Michelle Grisham caught using taxpayer money to pay for her
[00:28:29.969 --> 00:28:32.250]  groceries, her whiskey and her tequila.
[00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:36.570]  Well, was she drunk when she said that today?
[00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.770]  Maybe she was just drunk when she said we have to ban the Second Amendment and the
[00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.649]  law abiding citizens are just going to have to make a sacrifice.
[00:28:43.649 --> 00:28:44.969]  What kind of sacrifice, Governor?
[00:28:44.969 --> 00:28:48.529]  Are they going to have to sacrifice their lives?
[00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:52.409]  I always wonder for the liberals out there that want to take all the guns away, how
[00:28:52.449 --> 00:28:56.529]  many people have to die for you to accomplish your goal of disarming Americans?
[00:28:56.529 --> 00:28:58.489]  Have you ever asked yourselves that?

[00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:19.330]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:23.890]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:24.890]  This stuff up.
[00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.370]  Believe me, I wish we were.
[00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.370]  Believe me.
[00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.370]  Believe me.
[00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:29.370]  Believe it.
[00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.370]  But when I get this info, I'm going to tell you, no matter what happens, you can
[00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:33.370]  be guaranteed of that.
[00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:39.250]  No matter what happens, I will go 100%, period.
[00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.250]  And that's it.
[00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.250]  Excuse me.
[00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.570]  The reason I start yelling, folks, is this is life and death stuff, okay?
[00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:49.010]  And my adrenaline just goes crazy, because at a subconscious level, I realize this is
[00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:52.570]  combat, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:53.570]  This is not a joke.
[00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.570]  This is not a game.
[00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.570]  It's not good to serve evil.
[00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:02.410]  All these globalists look like reanimated corpses, and they all just get off on destruction
[00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:06.450]  and power, and their empire is collapsing, shucking America down with it.
[00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.450]  And they're not going to let it collapse without starting World War III.
[00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:11.450]  That's what all this is about.
[00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:16.450]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the
[00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:18.450]  truth about what's happening next.
[00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:23.450]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:29.450]  From you to the sound of the kings.
[00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:39.450]  So here's the deal.
[00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:44.450]  I'm not demonizing anybody that likes to watch football.
[00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:47.450]  I like to watch football.
[00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:52.450]  But you see, the day that Americans care more about their First Amendment, their Second
[00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:57.450]  Amendment, and the future of this country more than football, is the day we really
[00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.450]  start to turn the tide.
[00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:08.450]  And there was a meeting of these two phenomenons with Donald Trump in Iowa at the
[00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.450]  Iowa-Iowa State game.
[00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:17.450]  And, folks, the juxtaposition between Donald Trump with the people and Joe Biden
[00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:20.450]  with the people, it's stupid, okay?
[00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.450]  It's just stupid.
[00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:30.450]  It'd be like comparing Michael Jordan in his prime to, I mean, anybody.
[00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.450]  To you in the audience.
[00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.450]  It's ridiculous.
[00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.450]  Michael Jordan in his prime.
[00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.450]  Greatest ball player ever.
[00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:37.450]  You in the audience.
[00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:42.450]  You price stock.
[00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:51.450]  Trump has support from the people, the likes of which I don't think has ever
[00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:56.450]  been seen when it comes to a U.S. politician.
[00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:59.450]  And you might say, well, what about Barack Obama?
[00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:03.450]  I saw the support for Barack Obama in 2008.
[00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.450]  It was a lot of my friends.
[00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:06.450]  You know what?
[00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:12.450]  Most Barack Obama voters are Trump voters and now think Barack Obama is
[00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:19.450]  corrupt and the worst president they ever saw until Joe Biden.
[00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:26.450]  So we're going to do this juxtaposition from Donald Trump and his activities in
[00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:32.450]  public, or just any of his activities, to Joe Biden, who's traveling right now
[00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:39.450]  and, I mean, crumbling and falling apart right before our eyes.
[00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.450]  And it's so bad now.
[00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:47.450]  I mean, look, folks, we got more than a year left of Biden's presidency.
[00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:50.450]  I don't know how they're going to put this thing together.
[00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.450]  I mean, this thing is crumbling.
[00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:58.450]  And it's so bad now that they're cutting Joe Biden's mic mid-speech.
[00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.450]  And it's so bad now that Biden gets up there and he's like, you know what?
[00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:03.450]  I'm out of energy.
[00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.450]  I got to take a nap.
[00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:09.450]  It's crumbling so bad that Joe Biden admits when he's talking, yeah, I don't
[00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.450]  really control everything.
[00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.450]  They tell me what to do.
[00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:15.450]  What are they going to do?
[00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.450]  And then there's some other developments as far as the Democrat race is concerned
[00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:22.450]  with Gavin Newsom and RFK Jr.
[00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:24.450]  But we're going to get to that.
[00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:35.450]  I mean, and let me just start with this, because there's a popular show
[00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:40.450]  Saturday mornings, and it happened to just be a big deal because the University
[00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:45.450]  of Texas Longhorns football team was the game of the week versus Alabama.
[00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:49.450]  And so they have this huge scene outside of the stadium in Tuscaloosa
[00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:54.450]  before the game, and they pack it with thousands of people behind the
[00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:58.450]  broadcast booth, and they hold up signs and it's a whole fanfare thing
[00:37:58.450 --> 00:37:59.450]  and it's been going on for decades.
[00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:03.450]  Usually there aren't political statements made.
[00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.450]  Well, I don't know what ESPN is going to do.
[00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:09.450]  I'm surprised they even let Pat McAfee and AJ Hawk and these other guys
[00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:13.450]  on the air and Aaron Rodgers, because they bash the vaccine, they bash the mandates,
[00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:17.450]  and I don't know if they're conservatives, but they're damn for sure not liberals.
[00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.450]  And now it's the top-rated show on ESPN.
[00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:20.450]  Oh, what do you know?
[00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:27.450]  The guy who's not a complete lib-tard is the most popular show on ESPN.
[00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.450]  And there's all these signs behind them as they're live on college game day,
[00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.450]  and it's Trump hats.
[00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:38.450]  And then there's one sign specifically that says Fauci lied.
[00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:41.450]  And there's Trump hats and USA hats and Trump won signs.
[00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:44.450]  What is ESPN going to do about that?
[00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:46.450]  Are they going to cancel college game day?
[00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.450]  Are they going to say nobody can come in?
[00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:53.450]  Are they going to check your signs before you go behind the broadcast booth?
[00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:54.450]  Okay.
[00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.450]  But let's go to Trump's activity.
[00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:57.450]  You won't even believe this.
[00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:03.450]  In fact, guys, let's just roll it all back to back, and I'll just do some commentary over it.
[00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:07.450]  Let's roll clips two.
[00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:14.450]  Let's roll clips two to seven back to back to back.
[00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:18.450]  Trump goes to Ames, Iowa, big college football game, Iowa versus Iowa State,
[00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:22.450]  big rivalry, huge crowds, and just look at the reception from Donald Trump.
[00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.450]  And let me ask you this as you're watching it.
[00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:28.450]  What would happen if Joe Biden went to a college football game?
[00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:35.450]  What would happen if Joe Biden walked out in front of a crowd of 80,000 people
[00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:38.450]  and the announcer said, here's President Joe Biden?
[00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.450]  Do you think it'd be a positive response?
[00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.450]  Of course, we already know the answer is no.
[00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:46.450]  That's why Joe Biden doesn't do it.
[00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:49.450]  But Trump knows what happens when he goes in front of the crowd.
[00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:54.450]  And so, guys, go ahead and show the audience.
[00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:57.450]  So here's Trump walking through the mobs of people at the concourse,
[00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:02.450]  everybody wanting a handshake, an autograph, a picture, just going nuts.
[00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:12.450]  U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!
[00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.450]  Can barely even get through the mobs.
[00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:16.450]  It's just a sea of support.
[00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:17.450]  Oh, I love this.
[00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:18.450]  Now he's flipping burgers at a tailgate.
[00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:19.450]  I love that.
[00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.450]  He holds the burger up.
[00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:23.450]  He holds the burger up.
[00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:26.450]  The golden toad grilling burgers.
[00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:28.450]  Biden wants to cancel burgers.
[00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.450]  All night!
[00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:35.450]  Fuck our house!
[00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:37.450]  Fuck AU!
[00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:41.450]  Now here he is outside of a frat house.
[00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:44.450]  Again, thousands of people waiting for him to come out,
[00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.450]  Trump signs everywhere, the cheering, the applause,
[00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.450]  the love, the patriotism.
[00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:53.450]  Do you think Biden could do that?
[00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.450]  Do you think Biden could do this at all?
[00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.450]  Here he is walking into the frat house.
[00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.450]  He goes right up to these men and he says hello.
[00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.450]  What do you think would happen if Biden walked into the frat house?
[00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.450]  He'd say, these guys are too old for me.
[00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:15.450]  Here he is tossing footballs.
[00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.450]  He was signing footballs and tossing them to the crowd.
[00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:19.450]  Oh, look at that arm, too.
[00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.450]  Trump with the arm.
[00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.450]  Oh, that's a strike.
[00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.450]  And now here he walks out into the stadium.
[00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:30.450]  People notice he's there and start cheering him on.
[00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.450]  Oh, he's not the president, though.
[00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.450]  He's not the most popular president of all time.
[00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.450]  He did not win the 2020 election.
[00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:51.450]  It's criminal to say he did.
[00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.450]  Now, again.
[00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.450]  Yeah, guys, just keep this on the screen as we go to break.
[00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:05.450]  Dude, I mean, come on.
[00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:10.450]  We all know what would happen if Joe Biden showed up at a college football game.
[00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:14.450]  In fact, it's exactly what happened to Emmanuel Macron
[00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.450]  at the Rugby World Cup.
[00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:17.450]  We'll play that clip.
[00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:20.450]  He would get booed out of the building.
[00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:25.450]  You wouldn't even be able to hear yourself think the boos would be so loud.
[00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:32.450]  So ask yourself, why doesn't Joe Biden go to a college football game?
[00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.450]  Because everyone knows from Joe Biden to everybody in his cabinet,
[00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:39.450]  to everybody in his administration, to everybody on his staff knows
[00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:43.450]  A. Joe Biden couldn't even handle it, first of all.
[00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:46.450]  He's not healthy.
[00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:51.450]  But two, he would get booed out of the building.
[00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.450]  But OK, Joe Biden was busy this weekend,
[00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:57.450]  and we'll juxtapose Trump's activities with Joe's on the other side.
[00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:03.450]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news.
[00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:07.450]  Because it's a great product you love, and people want it,
[00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:09.450]  and it funds our operation of 360 Wind.
[00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:13.450]  Bodies, ultimate, turmeric formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere.
[00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:18.450]  Jam-packed, a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation,
[00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.450]  that empowers your neurological system, you name it.
[00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:24.450]  I mean, it's just so amazing, God gave it to us,
[00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:26.450]  and it's the strongest curcuminoid out there.
[00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.450]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.450]  Most brands are 5% curcumin.
[00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:34.450]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:39.450]  This is the strongest anybody makes, 95% curcuminoid.
[00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:41.450]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.450]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:46.450]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.

[00:44:08.959 --> 00:44:14.160]  One of the most incredible I have to say is DNA Force Plus and it's one of these supplements
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.120]  that you really don't know what the effect it's going to have on you is until you
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.120]  try it.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.160]  And it's different for everybody but it's always positive.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.120]  Essentially it helps in a variety of different ways and whatever way that your body needs
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.120]  it'll help in that way.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.000]  DNA Force Plus is the perfect formula to help you support optimal energy levels while adapting
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.640]  your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.220]  That's why DNA Force Plus has exactly what you need to provide yourselves with protection.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.399]  By taking something like DNA Force Plus you're just upping the game on all of your body's
[00:44:40.399 --> 00:44:43.640]  functions in a way that is holistic and complete and really incredible.

[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:05.480]  We finally have our original best selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.160]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy we could not
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:14.600]  get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:19.959]  But now we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab, we've got a limited shipment,

[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:14.200]  They are both clones of national best selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:19.359]  maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price
[00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:20.819]  you'll find in stores.
[00:46:20.819 --> 00:46:24.839]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:46:24.839 --> 00:46:31.000]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.960]  your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.960]  more inductive to pain.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.279]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:46:40.279 --> 00:46:47.399]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD exclusively
[00:46:47.439 --> 00:46:50.520]  at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.680]  Introducing them both, 25% off, you'll find them exclusively at Infowarsstore.com and
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.520]  they fund our operation.
[00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:07.210]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:31.660]  That's the reception of Emmanuel Macron at the Rugby World Cup.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:37.460]  Yeah, you're getting booed, bud.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:42.380]  And folks, there's all kinds of different videos from the crowd.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:47.020]  I mean, that one almost doesn't even do it justice.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:51.779]  The strength of the boos, the noise from the boos.
[00:47:51.779 --> 00:47:54.819]  But he heard it, he got the message loud and clear, similar to what would happen if
[00:47:54.819 --> 00:48:00.020]  Joe Biden went to a college football game, I'm sure.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.920]  And that's why he doesn't go.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.900]  But now we look at Joe Biden's activities from this weekend and understand there is
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.620]  a buildup to this.
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:16.980]  Joe Biden traveling this weekend and last week, he arrives in India to barely any ceremony.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.700]  Barely anything.
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:19.700]  They don't care.
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.279]  Modi isn't even there to greet him.
[00:48:22.279 --> 00:48:26.380]  And they have this little dance team there and that's all Joe Biden get.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:30.299]  No red carpet, no big ceremony, no big grand welcome.
[00:48:30.299 --> 00:48:31.420]  Modi wasn't even there.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.819]  It was just a little dance team and some staffer that said, Hey, Joe.
[00:48:34.819 --> 00:48:36.859]  And then he's confused walking around the tarmac.
[00:48:36.859 --> 00:48:37.900]  He's like, what's going on?
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.420]  He doesn't even know.
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.259]  So that was the build up to the G20.
[00:48:42.259 --> 00:48:49.180]  And then, okay, you give Joe Biden a microphone and you kind of regret it, don't you?
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:54.540]  I don't know if this has ever been done before, except maybe to Joe Biden.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:59.660]  They cut off his microphone, ladies and gentlemen, because they're afraid of what he
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.140]  might say.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.299]  This is the president of the United States.
[00:49:04.299 --> 00:49:05.940]  And he's having his mic cut off.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:06.940]  He's getting the hook.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.580]  Here it is in clip one.
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.580]  We talked about, we talked about at the conference overall, we talked about stability.
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:22.020]  We talked about making sure that the third world, excuse me, third world, the southern
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:25.700]  hemisphere had access to change, had access.
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.819]  It wasn't confrontational at all.
[00:49:28.819 --> 00:49:29.819]  Thank you everybody.
[00:49:29.819 --> 00:49:30.819]  This ends the press conference.
[00:49:30.819 --> 00:49:31.819]  Thanks everyone.
[00:49:31.819 --> 00:49:32.819]  Thank you.
[00:49:32.819 --> 00:49:36.620]  What is that?
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:46.660]  Mid speech, mid statement, they give Joe Biden the hook and now he starts screaming
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:51.339]  at every person I've met with.
[00:49:51.339 --> 00:49:52.339]  And now he won't take questions.
[00:49:52.339 --> 00:49:59.060]  Now he runs from the press as they play him off the stage.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:02.100]  Nap time for Joe.
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:07.660]  And actually he did, he did say, yeah, it's time for me to take a nap.
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:08.660]  Incredible stuff.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.220]  And so maybe this is part of the reason why they cut his mic off because they don't
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.580]  want him to say anything embarrassing or stupid.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:18.859]  He, he, he couldn't even pronounce the crown prince of Saudi Arabia's name.
[00:50:18.859 --> 00:50:25.100]  He became mush mouth marble mouth here in clip 12 and I particularly want to thank
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:29.339]  prime minister Modi and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin
[00:50:29.339 --> 00:50:30.339]  Salaam.
[00:50:30.339 --> 00:50:34.540]  So excuse me, Mohammed bin Salaam and the president of underline and the
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.420]  European commissions.
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:41.900]  And since it's, he's not speaking today, I wanted to, maybe he is speaking
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:42.900]  today.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:47.700]  I had a note he wasn't speaking, anyway, I'm going to stop there.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:50.140]  Yeah, you're going to stop there.
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.140]  You've embarrassed yourself.
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.700]  You've embarrassed the country enough.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:57.540]  And then he tells the ultimate truth here in clip
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.540]  20.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:59.540]  Let's see.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:00.540]  I'll just follow my orders here.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.540]  Confused Joe, flipping through notecards, following orders.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.540]  Staff, if anybody hasn't spoken.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.540]  I ain't calling on you.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.540]  I'm calling on you.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.540]  I said that.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.540]  I'm calling on you.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.540]  I'm calling on you.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.540]  I'm calling on you.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:09.540]  I'm calling on you.
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:10.540]  I'm calling on you.
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.540]  I'm calling on you.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:12.540]  I'm calling on you.
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:33.740]  Now, let's explain a little more what's happening here.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.740]  We've seen it before.
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:40.740]  Joe Biden has cue cards, notecards, faces, names, outlets that individuals are with
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.299]  because when he does have a press conference, or when he used to have press conferences,
[00:51:44.299 --> 00:51:47.220]  the whole thing was scripted.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.220]  And Joe would have a cue card, and it'd have the face of the reporter, the name
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:54.980]  of the reporter, the outlet the reporter is with, and the question he's going to ask,
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:57.259]  and the answer.
[00:51:57.259 --> 00:52:03.220]  And because there's cameras everywhere, we've actually seen the photo evidence of this.
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.140]  And so Joe Biden, though, has dead air.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.020]  He has dead air, he's confused, he doesn't even know what's going on.
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.980]  And so he's trying to fill the dead air and he just says, oh, I'm just supposed to take
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.220]  orders.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:18.560]  And oh, by the way, you know, every question and answer has already been scripted.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.940]  And so that's why I'm not calling on you.
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.940]  I'm calling on him.
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:28.620]  Why, why, why do you guys, why do liberals defend this man?
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.100]  What is wrong with you?
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.779]  Are you so committed to the lie?
[00:52:33.779 --> 00:52:38.380]  Are you so filled with hatred?
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:42.899]  Are you no shame?
[00:52:42.899 --> 00:52:46.819]  Just a little, just a little icing on the cake, because Joe Biden continues to tell
[00:52:46.819 --> 00:52:51.940]  this lie, and he told it to the people of Maui, oh, I can relate to you.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.259]  We had a house fire and it was so bad.
[00:52:55.259 --> 00:52:58.000]  So, so here's Joe Biden, and I'll tell you what really happened.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.620]  Here's Joe Biden lying about his house fire in clip 19.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:10.180]  I see the firemen standing out my side, outside my house in a pouring rain and a woman firefighter
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:14.980]  and a police officer, a woman police officer, giving my wife a coat to put around her,
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:20.500]  taking their coat off because she was in her bathrobe and it was soaking through.
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:25.899]  I can still see those guys in mask looking through the windows that I could hardly see
[00:53:25.899 --> 00:53:28.740]  into my home.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.180]  I see it when I see each of you.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:34.500]  Do you have any idea how bad this is?
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:40.540]  First of all, the fire he's talking about was a small fire that never even left his
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.580]  kitchen.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:47.060]  So it'd be like if you had a small grease fire on your oven or maybe something happened
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.460]  in your microwave caught on fire and the fire department came and put it out before
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:55.259]  it reached any other rooms.
[00:53:55.259 --> 00:54:01.500]  And as if that's not bad enough, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden was not even there.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.940]  He was not even present.
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:09.859]  And so that whole story he tells you, that whole story he tells the victims of Maui
[00:54:09.859 --> 00:54:14.100]  completely fabricated, completely made up.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:21.340]  And by the way, he's been fact checked on this for decades, for decades.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:26.460]  He's been caught in this lie for decades and he continues to tell it.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.460]  But why not?
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.319]  He lies about everything.
[00:54:29.319 --> 00:54:33.680]  What difference does this lie make to Joe Biden?
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.540]  What else is Joe Biden up to?
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:40.660]  Listen to this announcement from Kirby in clip 10.
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:46.620]  I had a chance to ask part of the president's traveling party if he was going to ask MBS
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:50.380]  or anybody else for help bringing gas prices down at home.
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:55.180]  Well, he'll have opportunities throughout the discussions here at the G20 to talk about
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.220]  a spate of economic developments around the world.
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:02.500]  He's focused on making sure that the prices continue to come down for the American consumer.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:06.819]  That's why he has taken steps to shore up global supply, even if that means coming
[00:55:06.819 --> 00:55:08.380]  into the strategic reserve.
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:13.299]  Oh, we're going to get back into the strategic oil reserves, are we?
[00:55:13.299 --> 00:55:15.880]  Which are already at record lows.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.859]  And it's likely that Joe Biden is being forced to do this by the Chinese communists that
[00:55:19.859 --> 00:55:25.859]  own he and his son's ass.
[00:55:25.859 --> 00:55:29.520]  But let's just look at the bottom line.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:35.220]  Gas prices are hitting record highs and they're only going to go up.
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:43.480]  So Joe Biden might drain these strategic petroleum reserves to either A, satisfy the Chinese
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:52.920]  demands or B, try to keep gas prices as low as he possibly can so that they don't reach
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:57.880]  five, six, seven dollars a gallon, which is where they're going to be.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:01.460]  And then there's another issue.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.279]  And it's complex, but let's make it simple.
[00:56:04.279 --> 00:56:10.200]  If there's three countries that consume oil, the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia,
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.720]  let's say those three countries consume oil.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.680]  And only two of the countries produce oil, Russia and Saudi Arabia.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:22.319]  Well, gee, who do you think is going to pay the most for oil?
[00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:24.560]  Who do you think is going to pay the most for oil?
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:29.399]  And let's say Russia and Saudi Arabia with the BRICS system decide that they're going
[00:56:29.399 --> 00:56:33.359]  to have a new foreign policy geopolitical strategy to hurt the United States economically.
[00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:35.120]  Well, gee, what are they going to do?
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.240]  They're going to jack up oil prices.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:41.819]  They're going to keep oil scarce in the world market.
[00:56:41.819 --> 00:56:45.779]  And if we want to get oil from them, they're going to make us pay a tremendous tax on that.
[00:56:45.779 --> 00:56:48.299]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[00:56:48.299 --> 00:56:52.460]  And then this lying administration with this lying press secretary tells you that gas
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.460]  prices are lower than they've ever been.
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.720]  It doesn't matter that you know, that's a lie.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.759]  It doesn't matter that you go to the pump and pay more than you've ever paid.
[00:56:59.759 --> 00:57:02.319]  The White House says it's not true.
[00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:03.359]  That's newspeak.
[00:57:03.359 --> 00:57:04.680]  That's 1984.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:05.859]  That's brave new world.
[00:57:05.859 --> 00:57:09.720]  That's corrupt politicians.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:19.140]  So you can only jack into the petroleum reserves so much, folks, until they're gone.
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:25.279]  And I would tell you right here, right now, that by next summer, because Russia and
[00:57:25.279 --> 00:57:28.000]  Saudi Arabia already said they're done, they're not putting any more oil into the
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000]  world market.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]  Why would they?
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.160]  Why would they?
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.880]  Joe Biden's trying to crush Russia.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.319]  So you know what's going to happen probably?
[00:57:38.319 --> 00:57:43.840]  They're going to start seeing four or five dollars a gallon average by next summer.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:46.319]  And the White House will still tell you they're cheaper than ever.
[00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:57.450]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through
[00:57:57.450 --> 00:58:03.930]  diet. They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it. And
[00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:11.090]  they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s. But the problem
[00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:17.690]  today is finding fish without a high mercury content. Your best option is our ultimate fish

[00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:57.850]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:22.750]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and now, your host,
[01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:23.750]  Owen Troyer.
[01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:27.070]  So, it's quite hilarious. The Democrats have to pay people to lie for them, like this
[01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:33.230]  one teenager that they pay to yell at a camera phone and upload it to social media. Try to
[01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.790]  make it through this in clip 15.
[01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:40.310]  A lot of people are surprised to learn how productive the Joe Biden presidency has actually
[01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:45.670]  been. Like, unemployment is at a 54-year low. He's created 13 million jobs. Inflation
[01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:49.690]  has gone down for, like, the 14th month in a row. He's invested more money than anyone
[01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:53.790]  in infrastructure in the last, like, three decades. Did you even know that? He passed
[01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:57.870]  the first meaningful gun reform in decades. He's invested more money in climate change
[01:00:57.870 --> 01:01:01.870]  than any president ever. Like, half a trillion dollars. There's a lot of misinformation
[01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:07.670]  about that one. New leases for oil drilling projects have decreased 97% under Biden compared
[01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:12.270]  to Trump. The list goes on and on and on and on. He's been inclusive. He invests
[01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:16.390]  tons of money in social healthcare. I mean, compare this to the other guy who's being
[01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:20.070]  indicted one, two, three, I don't know how many times on RICO charges. He's been
[01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:24.990]  impeached twice. He's got a second defamation lawsuit. He sexually assaults women. I mean,
[01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:26.990]  what are we doing? He's trying to keep himself out of jail.
[01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.990]  Defamation suit coming?
[01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:32.190]  I never hear about Joe Biden. It's like, Chris, Joe Biden is old. Joe Biden is old.
[01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:37.510]  I'm here to tell you right now, we don't care. We don't care. A lot of people
[01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:39.950]  are surprised to learn how productive the Joe Biden presidency has actually been.
[01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:48.150]  Is that the offspring of Patrick Bateman? Look, here's the funny thing. Look, it's
[01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:56.110]  a teenage boy. You know? Okay. I'm not going to swing low here, but what's funny is it's
[01:01:56.110 --> 01:02:01.190]  like these people can't even read the room. Here's this teenager that gets paid by the
[01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:07.190]  DNC. It's public information. In fact, when he tweets, when he puts up these videos
[01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:10.330]  on Twitter, there's a community note every time that says this individual is paid
[01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:17.910]  for by the DNC. And he's in his car. This teenage boy is in his car, which appears
[01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:26.990]  to be a brand new Audi SUV, probably at least a $60,000 car, probably more. And this is
[01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:31.910]  the guy telling you, Oh, I know all about the economy. I'm a teenage boy. I get paid
[01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:38.910]  by the DNC. I drive a fancy Audi. Oh, so relatable. So relatable. And you're telling
[01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:46.310]  the struggling American that struggling to even make a car payment, how great Joe Biden
[01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:51.990]  is, and you're a teenage boy that has no life experience and looks like the offspring
[01:02:51.990 --> 01:03:01.670]  of Patrick Bateman, how great things are. Wow. Nice. Really good stuff. And so here's
[01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:06.630]  how great Bidenomics is though, guys, just be roll clip 13. Now I've seen this coming
[01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:12.630]  a mile away because this organized retail crime is not going to stop at robbing stores
[01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:21.310]  to steal shoes or jewelry or clothes or watches. Eventually they're going to realize, well,
[01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:25.550]  gee, we can steal food too. And that's what you're seeing on the screen. Now, a woman
[01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:30.830]  loads up a grocery cart full of food and steals it. So get ready for this. You've
[01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:36.750]  seen the bum rush at the jewelry stores. You've seen the bum rush at the Nike stores.
[01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:46.550]  You've seen the bum rush at the targets at the Louis Vuitton. You've seen the bum rush
[01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:52.030]  and no punishment. So guess what? They're going to figure it out pretty soon. Well,
[01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:57.670]  gee, I can just steal my food too. And they just shut down a Nike store because it
[01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:02.150]  got so bad. Nike permanently closes factory store in Democrat run Portland due to ongoing
[01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:06.510]  theft and safety issues. These stories are across the country. So yeah, get ready for
[01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:12.190]  the food retail theft to begin. Now folks guarantee it. Now here's a statement from
[01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:17.390]  Donald Trump on the state of the nation in clip 16.
[01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:24.070]  So this battle that we're in is a battle for all of us. That is for history. This
[01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:28.290]  is historic. This is a big moment in our country because we're either going to go one
[01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:34.430]  way or the other. And if we go the other, we're not going to have a country left.
[01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:42.190]  We will fight together. We will win together. And then we will seek justice together. We're
[01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:50.970]  going to seek justice together. That's Donald Trump this weekend in South
[01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:56.230]  Dakota to a raucous, monstrous crowd. I dare Joe Biden to have one round. Let's
[01:04:56.230 --> 01:05:03.830]  see one Joe Biden rally info war store.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin
[01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:08.190]  shop. We want to have all the best brands. We want to have a bunch of different choices
[01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:13.029]  for you. So I get constant questions online in person. Hey, what's better knockout.
[01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:16.630]  What's better down and out. What's better. Why don't you sell two or three different
[01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:21.790]  sleep eggs? And the answer is different herbal formulas. Different compounds are better
[01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:26.630]  for different people. So one person might like this coffee or the person likes that
[01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:30.630]  coffee. That's how our bodies work. They're all very diverse, but we've been able to
[01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:35.390]  private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love
[01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:40.990]  and sell for lower price under the name info wars, MD, good night's sleep. This
[01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:46.910]  is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds, deeper, cleaner, restful sleep. And it's
[01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:53.110]  in stock available right now of 25% off out of the gates. So get your info Wars, MD. Good
[01:05:53.110 --> 01:06:08.510]  night's sleep today at four. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to
[01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:24.710]  you from the front lines of the info war. And now your host, Owen Troyer. All right,
[01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:29.750]  ladies and gentlemen, as I said in the first hour, I'm going to make a bit of a personal
[01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:39.550]  statement here. And I would like to preface this by saying that I never got into the
[01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:47.910]  news media or the media at all to talk about myself. I really don't like doing it.
[01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:53.670]  And it's just not what I got into media to do. I didn't want to be the story.
[01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:58.470]  I don't want to talk about myself, but it goes without saying that for about a week
[01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:08.230]  now I have been all over the news and I have been a story. And while I'm not going
[01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:20.029]  to be commenting on that story per se, there has been such an outreach of support. And
[01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:27.470]  I had a conversation with Alex earlier today. And so I want to let you know a little something
[01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:34.430]  that's going on and then, and then tell you how you can support me now, because of
[01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:41.550]  the situation we're in here at info Wars. Now I am due in court on Tuesday. This has
[01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:47.670]  been all over the news, the case, you can read all about it. And because of the situation
[01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:56.190]  we're in here at info Wars, there's basically no money for us to support anything that
[01:07:56.190 --> 01:08:06.029]  I do personally outside of hosting the war room from three to 6 PM central at band.video.
[01:08:06.029 --> 01:08:11.670]  And I'm eternally grateful for that. I'm extremely grateful that we're still able to
[01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:19.270]  do that, even though things are tight around here, but there's no money for travel. There's
[01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:25.230]  rarely even money for security or for us to do anything outside of these studios because
[01:08:25.230 --> 01:08:33.270]  of what goes on. And so I'm talking to Alex earlier today and he's asking me about
[01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:39.190]  travel and everything for me going to court on Tuesday. And I had to tell him, I was
[01:08:39.190 --> 01:08:42.910]  like, well, Alex, yeah, I mean, I don't have a crew. I don't have any security. I don't, I don't
[01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:49.070]  have the money. The company doesn't have the money. And so I never got into the news media
[01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:59.830]  to get rich or make money or be famous or talk about myself. But at this point, if I'm
[01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:08.710]  going to grow professionally, I will need support outside of info Wars. And so with Alex's blessing,
[01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:17.910]  we have decided to launch a fundraising account for my personal professional endeavors. And
[01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:24.790]  you can support that by going to defend Owen.com. We have just launched this. Now I want to be
[01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:34.710]  clear. This is for personal expenses. So that if I want to go cover a new story, I can pay for
[01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:42.790]  it. Or if I'm going to build a home studio to cover breaking news when it goes live, I can do
[01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:59.270]  that. But I have paid the expenses for my travel and my room and lodging for, I guess,
[01:09:59.350 --> 01:10:05.270]  about a year or so now. And when Alex said, Hey, what do you mean there's no crew going with you?
[01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:07.750]  What do you mean there's no security? What do you mean there's no, there was no camera crew?
[01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:12.830]  Nothing. I said, well, I don't have the money that the company doesn't have the money. So he
[01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:16.870]  said, well, look, you've got to do a fundraiser. I, he said, look, I know you don't, you
[01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:20.510]  never asked for raises. You never asked for money. You just want to just, you just want
[01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:24.590]  to fight tyrants and tell the truth and speak truth to power, but you got to do this.
[01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:30.990]  Or you, you're really just putting your career and your life in jeopardy. And so I took the
[01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:37.870]  sage advice from Alex and I started a give, send, go fundraiser. And there's been so many
[01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:41.910]  people asking how to support. And I just said, look, just, just pray for us, support info wars.
[01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:46.190]  And that's, that's, that's going to be enough. But the truth is I can't get the money for
[01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:51.150]  cruise. I can't get the money for security. I have to pay for all my travel and all my
[01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:57.990]  lodging. And so we've decided to launch this fundraiser and you can support it at defend
[01:10:57.990 --> 01:11:06.390]  Owen.com. And so I'm always going to be right here and loyal to info wars, just to be perfectly
[01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:11.150]  clear. If anybody's thinking this is some way, shape or form me taking a step out the door,
[01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:17.190]  or somehow this is info wars announcing that they're going to separate ties or shut things
[01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:24.470]  down. That is not what this is about. That is not what this is about. This is about Alex saying,
[01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:30.950]  look, if you're going to go professionally, if you're going to be able to cover things and do
[01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:35.590]  what you need to do as a journalist, then you've, you've just got to launch a fundraiser. And so
[01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:42.790]  we decided to do it, defend Owen.com. And again, this is going to go for, for personal
[01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:50.590]  expenses that I have to take up. Now, if I'm traveling or if there's a breaking news story,
[01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:56.030]  or because here's the thing, there's breaking news all the time. The crew here already works
[01:11:56.030 --> 01:12:03.590]  seven days a week, 10, 12 hours a day. So I don't like asking the crew at a minutes notice
[01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:07.790]  when there's breaking news, Hey, let's all go in the studio and get it set up. That usually
[01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:12.350]  takes at least three people and they are already working every day, 10, 12 hours a day. So it's
[01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:16.710]  a lot easier if I can build a professional home studio. And if there's breaking news,
[01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:21.630]  I can just go live right there, professional sound, professional video, and be able to break
[01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:27.230]  news and cover it live. And so if you want to support me in these professional endeavors,
[01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:36.470]  go to defend Owen.com. And so hopefully the result of this will mean, and people always
[01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:39.510]  ask, you know, why aren't you traveling anymore? Well, there's a couple reasons. One,
[01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:43.550]  I've been on probation for more than two years, and there's a very strict travel probation
[01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:51.790]  involved with that amongst other things. I'll talk more about that next week. And two,
[01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:55.910]  we are just at a point and it's, you know, Alex talks about the bankruptcy stuff
[01:12:55.910 --> 01:13:00.150]  here all the time. That's not my story to tell. And I'm sure he'll have some stuff
[01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:07.150]  about it next week. But because of that, I can't fund what we do here. So if I want
[01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:12.630]  to go cover a hurricane or I want to go cover an emergency or I want to go cover a big event,
[01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:17.030]  the funds here are just, they're not there. We're basically capped. We can do what we can
[01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:22.390]  do here. And we're trying to just maintain that. But if I'm going to get back out
[01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:25.870]  there and start covering things and getting on the road again, then I'm going to have
[01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:30.870]  to start funding that and doing that myself, which is fine. I'm okay with that. But
[01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:35.990]  again, I don't like sticking my hand out and saying, hey, let you know, help me
[01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:41.309]  out here doing personal, professional stuff. But after speaking with Alex for a couple
[01:13:41.309 --> 01:13:48.309]  of hours today, and with his grace, we've decided to go ahead and launch this fundraiser
[01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:55.710]  defendowen.com. So again, this is going to be going to helping me in my personal
[01:13:56.350 --> 01:14:02.110]  professional endeavors now so that I can expand professionally and continue the journalistic
[01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:09.150]  work that I've been doing for almost a decade now in politics. And I'll just say this in
[01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:16.150]  closing, obviously, there'll be coverage of my court case on Tuesday. And depending
[01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:25.190]  on how things go, I might be able to start traveling and covering big breaking events
[01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:31.430]  very soon. Now, unfortunately, depending on how things go, I might not be. And I'll
[01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:38.430]  just leave it at that. But regardless, your support at defendowen.com is going to become
[01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:45.910]  a key factor, if not the factor in supporting my personal professional work and helping
[01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:52.950]  me expand what I do as a journalist, outside of info wars, not that I'm separating from
[01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:57.950]  info wars, that's not what this is about. And I'll go around and I'll still give shout
[01:14:57.950 --> 01:15:02.230]  outs to info wars and report for info wars and all that stuff. That's that's great.
[01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:09.230]  I intend to do that. But we just can't fund it here anymore. And so that was the
[01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:14.510]  conversation that I had with Alex earlier today. And again, I don't like coming on
[01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:18.830]  here and saying, Oh, I have no money for this stuff, and everything else because I know
[01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:25.830]  you're struggling out there too. We're all struggling in Bidenomics. But the truth
[01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:31.590]  of the matter is, if I'm going to expand and become bigger in the media and have a bigger
[01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:37.430]  media footprint, then I've got to start doing this. And so defendowen.com is the website.
[01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:40.670]  This is not me separating from info wars. I'm always going to be here. I'm going to stay
[01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:43.750]  on this ship. I'm going to continue hosting The War Room, Sunday Night Live, working
[01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:48.309]  with Alex, filling in for him, all those things. But in order for me to expand professionally
[01:15:48.309 --> 01:15:52.030]  now, I'm going to have to fund it myself. And you can support that by going to
[01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:56.630]  defendowen.com. I thank you so much for your support. God bless you. I love you.
[01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:58.350]  And let's do the news on the other side.
[01:15:58.350 --> 01:16:02.590]  Hey, everybody. Rodney Outbound here. I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for

[01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:12.430]  diet. They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to
[01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:17.630]  ban it. And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of
[01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:23.590]  Omega-3s. But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:30.630]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at infowarsstore.com.
[01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:38.110]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems,
[01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:44.830]  our brain, and our heart. They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.
[01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:49.790]  Get your essential Omega-3 fatty acids from the best sources available.

[01:17:56.590 --> 01:18:01.230]  I didn't realize this was back this week. I thought it was next week. I come in this
[01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:06.550]  morning. It's back in the warehouse ready to roll. Body's ultimate turmeric formula.

[01:18:30.309 --> 01:18:38.950]  The other strongest brands are 75%. This is 95%. Super constant. It's like taking one pill. It's
[01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:45.350]  like taking 10 of the average pill. It's that powerful. Or more. So they're available at

[01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:07.510]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:22.960]  Wow. You know, I just got to say this, this audience is such a godsend. I can't even put
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:33.580]  it into words. And you know, when I decided to make the pivot professionally from sports
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:41.580]  to politics, I knew there was only one team I wanted to play for. And I knew there was only one
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:49.340]  organization where I could do what I wanted to do. And once again, the audience has proved that my
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:21:00.780]  instincts were right. And I'm right where I'm supposed to be right now. Yeah. Yeah. But again,
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:06.620]  you know, I didn't get into this business to talk about myself. I didn't get into this business to
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:14.700]  get rich or famous. And I just, I really, I feel so rich because the support of this audience,
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.980]  the support of my friends, the support of my family, the support of this crew,
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:23.500]  that's what makes me feel rich. And I could have $0 in my bank account and I still feel
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:28.700]  like the richest man on earth, thanks to this audience and this crew. I really mean that.
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:36.700]  So that's just, that's just God is what that is. And that's this audience being the best
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:45.500]  audience there is. Period. Now, let me get back to doing my job here and hosting the Alex Jones
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:50.780]  show. And I will be with you the rest of the night on Sunday Night Live as well with some
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:56.140]  big guests coming up, but let's get back to the news.
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:05.660]  And boy, I mean, I've got more on Joe Biden and maybe we should pick that up because
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:09.740]  there are some developments here inside the Democrat party ahead of 2024
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:16.460]  that they're going to have to deal with. And so I already played the juxtaposition
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:20.780]  of Donald Trump this weekend in South Dakota to massive crowds,
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:28.460]  Donald Trump in Ames, Iowa to massive support. And then Joe Biden on the road fumbling,
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:33.340]  bumbling, forgetting where he is, getting cut off by his own staff, getting no respect in India.
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:41.340]  But okay, let's get a little wonky here and let's talk about 2024.
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:55.740]  Well, let's look at the lack of support Joe Biden has. Joe Biden went live on Twitter and YouTube
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.700]  when he was giving his speech in Vietnam
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:07.100]  where they cut him off the mic and they played him out with the music and they gave
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.580]  him the hook. It's kind of like a bad comedian, you know, and it's like, hey,
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:13.020]  you got to give him the hook, get him off the stage. And that's Joe Biden, except it's not
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:28.540]  comedy. And his live broadcast on Twitter peaked at 1800 views. 1800. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:36.700]  I know a certain individual here, a big burly man who could fart into the wind
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:43.340]  and get more than that on the live stream. But he's not running for president. Donald Trump is.
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:50.380]  Donald Trump's videos get millions of views every time. Donald Trump has more people lined up
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:56.780]  outside of his speech in South Dakota 10 hours before the doors even open. Then Joe Biden gets
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:01.500]  on a live stream speaking as the president of the United States in a foreign country.
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:11.740]  So that's, let's not discount that as an indicating factor of where Joe Biden is
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:20.540]  at as far as popularity and political support is concerned. But believe me, there are panic
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:25.580]  buttons being pushed left and right inside the Democrat party. Senate Democrats are freaking out
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:38.060]  over Joe Biden's terrible poll numbers. In fact, in fact, two thirds of Democrat voters in a CNN
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:44.540]  poll would prefer anyone but Joe Biden. The option was Joe Biden or anyone else.
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:50.300]  67% said anyone else. So I mean, that can be the Hamburglar.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:56.780]  They would vote for a ham sandwich over Joe Biden.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:08.620]  Believe me, with the commentary and backlash that they're still getting from the 2020 election
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:17.740]  results and them seeing the popularity of Trump surging. Believe me, the low view counts on videos
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:24.700]  that is almost no support from Democrat voters is troubling for the Democrats. And they got one
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:30.780]  more problem, folks, because here's the thing. It's not that the Democrats don't have a viable
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:36.540]  candidate for president, they actually have a great candidate, and that's Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:41.500]  Solid candidate, but they don't want him. Why? Because he's anti-establishment.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:47.420]  Because he's anti Big Pharma. Because he's anti-military industrial complex. Because he's
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:51.100]  his own man that tells the truth as he sees it. The Democrats aren't interested in that.
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:56.540]  They'd rather have mush mouth, oatmeal brains, Joe Biden up there, fumbling, mumbling,
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:00.940]  bumbling around, and then they give him the hook on the stage. But what are they going to do?
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:09.100]  And so now Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made statements and announcements alluding
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:16.060]  that he might be making a third party run. Now I'd like to see RFK Jr. team up with
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:24.460]  Donald Trump. But let's just say that RFK Jr. decides to make a third party run.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:33.260]  Do you realize that that's game over for the Democrats? It's game over, folks. RFK Jr. will
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:41.180]  take so many votes away from Joe Biden that he has zero chance of winning. Believe me,
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:46.060]  the Democrats know that. So they've got a rock and a hard place that they find themselves in,
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:52.620]  don't they? Do they go with RFK Jr.? Well, of course not. They don't want him in there.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:56.860]  Do they go with Joe Biden? Well, gee, how can they go with Joe Biden? He's unpopular.
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:04.940]  So who's up? Well, Gavin Newsom was an option, but he's taking his name out of the hat.
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:10.060]  Gavin Newsom declares he will not run in 2024 and actually says Kamala Harris is the natural
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:17.660]  successor. Now, is that a joke? Is he trolling here? By the way, did you see Kamala Harris over
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:21.660]  the weekend? Guys, go ahead and B-roll me, clip 11 here. No, no, no, give me the audio too.
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:24.220]  Yeah, yeah, go ahead, go ahead. Hit it with the audio.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:27.340]  What is that?
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:41.180]  That's Kamala Harris gyrating and humping.
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:47.740]  And we're not even in Willie Brown's office. We're not even on the Montel Williams show.
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:51.100]  And Kamala Harris, the vice president, is gyrating and dry humping.
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:28:02.220]  Classy. That's the successor to Joe Biden, the magic school bus lady, the Venn diagram lady.
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.020]  The bus goes here, the bus goes there, because that's what buses do.
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:14.860]  What is that? Surely the Democrats aren't thinking about running her.
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.980]  So where are they going to go from here, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:27.900]  Is it going to be Michelle Obama? Are they really going to run Joe Biden again?
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:29.580]  What's that going to look like a year from now?
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:36.060]  Do not take this issue inside the Democrat party lightly, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:38.860]  Do not take it lightly.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:44.220]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to talk about the issue of the open borders and the...
[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:52.220]  Well, it's ironic, but it's unintentional irony of the Democrats not wanting any illegal
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.780]  immigrants in their cities, but only in Texas, they say now. That's amazing.
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:02.620]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported Infowars financially with word

[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:02.380]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high-quality
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:07.020]  coffee has not been available, and that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:11.740]  and the quality had gone down some. I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us,
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:18.540]  but now we have brought back the coffee, and it's even better from a national supplier

[01:32:57.750 --> 01:33:04.750]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:27.320]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer. Wow, we've
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:36.760]  got a developing act of defiance happening in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Just in case you're
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:47.080]  unaware of this, the New Mexico governor went full-on Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Lenin, Stalin,
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:52.080]  and said she wants to ban guns, issued a 30-day ban on carrying guns in public in Albuquerque,
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:58.000]  an open act of defiance happening right now in Albuquerque. Hundreds, hundreds of gun
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:05.040]  owners have showed up at a town square in Albuquerque with their guns, open carrying,
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:13.440]  in a public act of defiance against their tyrannical Democrat governor. It's women,
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:24.520]  it's children, mothers, fathers. So wow, I guess that sends a message loud and clear to the old,
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:30.640]  corrupt Democrat tyrant, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. And we'll be monitoring this,
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:37.000]  but as far as I can see, no law enforcement is making arrests. No law enforcement is harassing
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.920]  these people. And so perhaps the law enforcement in Albuquerque has decided they're not going to
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:46.720]  violate their oath, and they are not going to violate the Second Amendment. You'll love to
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:55.880]  see it. More of this please, peaceful, open defiance of tyrants that want to destroy the
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:00.560]  cornerstones of this country, the First and Second Amendment. You want to engage in an act
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:06.680]  of defiance right now, ladies and gentlemen? Go to infowarsstore.com and support these

[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:21.360]  Great way to start your day. Or if you've got kids at home and you don't want them
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.320]  drinking the high fructose corn syrup drinks or the loaded processed sugar drinks that are
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:31.840]  not healthy for them, fill a pitcher with purified water, put a couple scoops to whatever
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.360]  the best flavor you think is, two scoops, three scoops, four scoops, five scoops,
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:38.560]  whatever you think is the best, stir it up, put that pitcher in the fridge.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:42.560]  Your kids will love it, and they won't be drinking the toxic drinks that so many kids do,
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:48.960]  and they'll love it, by the way. And I've got to tell you about the
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:53.680]  flagship elite product, and that's DNA Force Plus. Again, I start every morning.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:59.680]  Actually, I start every morning with this. I chase DNA Force down with vitamin,
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:03.600]  mineral, fusion, and then I also like to take DNA Force Plus when I get home from a workout.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:08.640]  But this is the elite flagship supplement at infowarsstore.com. You want to talk about
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:13.280]  telomere support? You want to talk about longevity? You want to talk about cellular
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:20.000]  production? DNA Force Plus, ladies and gentlemen. Really? There's not much else,
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.760]  if anything else, on the market like it. Other products have tried to enter the market.
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:30.160]  They charge $500, $600, $700 a pop for products like this. Infowarsstore.com,
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:33.600]  you support yourself, you support the broadcast. All right.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:40.160]  We've got a wide open border. Now, the Democrats have done something incredible here.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:47.280]  I mean, it's hard to even wrap your head around this. The Democrats in Chicago and
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:52.480]  Seattle and Los Angeles and San Francisco and New York City and New Jersey, and the list goes
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:57.760]  on and on and on. They say, we're a sanctuary city. And this is all in response to Donald Trump
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:02.480]  trying to stop illegal immigration. And they say, we love illegal immigrants.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:08.640]  Bring them all here. It's a sanctuary city. We love illegal immigrants. Well, now there's
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:13.680]  so many illegal immigrants in these cities, it's overwhelming the cities. The Democrat voters
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:20.960]  there are ticked off, but they've got a problem. See, they always love to have their
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.520]  cake and eat it too. So now, Democrat mayors in these sanctuary cities are saying, we can't
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:31.200]  handle the illegal immigrants anymore. It's too much. It's Greg Abbott's fault. Even though it's
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.920]  obviously their fault. But they can't address the open border issue because that would go directly
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:40.080]  against Joe Biden. And that would go directly against the White House narrative that the
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:48.560]  border is secure. So instead, Biden regime mulling a plan to force migrants to remain in Texas
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:54.560]  using ankle bracelets. So all these Democrat mayors are calling the White House and they're
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:39:04.080]  saying, hey, our constituents are pissed. And if you want the Democrat party to stay in power in
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:08.560]  these cities and run them into the ground and steal all the money, well, you're going to have
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:13.280]  to do something about these illegal immigrants. But they can't openly attack the Biden open
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:20.800]  border because that would be bad for party policy. So instead, the Biden administration has
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:27.760]  cut a deal with these Democrat mayors and they've said, OK, we're going to make them stay in Texas.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:33.360]  And we're going to give them ankle bracelets in case they leave Texas. Are you kidding me?
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:38.400]  So you can come across the southern border illegally. But if you leave the state of Texas,
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:44.800]  now you're a criminal? This is Democrat Party politics. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:53.280]  This is Democrat Party criminality. This is Democrat Party insanity.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:59.040]  This isn't politics anymore. And we should stop referring it to we should stop referring it
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:05.440]  to being politics. It's not. It's criminality and it's insanity. That's what it is. This is
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:13.760]  not politics anymore. But oh, my gosh, can you imagine? Oh, but this isn't an agenda to turn
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:19.120]  Texas blue. Of course not. They're not trying to have all these immigrants show up.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.240]  And then the Democrats give them free money, free housing, free food, free clothes,
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:31.040]  free education, question free. But all you got to do is stay in Texas and vote Democrat.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:35.920]  That's not politics, folks. That's criminality. That's what that is.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.920]  And between all the money they give to illegal immigrants
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.280]  and all the money they give to Ukraine, where do you fall into this equation? Well, it's
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:56.640]  Bidenomics, Jack. And that's why more Americans today are living paycheck to paycheck than ever
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:02.320]  before. Even six figure earners living paycheck to paycheck. Your grocery bill is higher than
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.400]  it's ever been, unless you're an illegal immigrant, then it's free.
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:11.120]  Your taxes are higher than they've ever been. Your energy costs, your price at the pump. I
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:17.040]  mean, it just goes on and on and on and on and on. Unless you're an illegal immigrant, then
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:26.720]  everything is free. And now they're going to spend even more money to make sure they stay in
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:27.760]  Texas.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.760]  And so listen to what Curtis Sliwa is saying about this in clip 18.
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:46.720]  We're going to bring in the tractor trailers, trucks, cars, vans, wrecks. We're going to
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:53.760]  block the bridges. We're going to block the highways. This is a war for the soul of our
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:42:00.640]  country, our state and our city. We the people are fighting this because our politicians have
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:08.800]  forsaken us. I will use every measure available that is within the decency and means
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:16.320]  of non-violent civil disobedience. Be patient, men and women. We will win this battle.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:23.040]  Now, I want to explain the political significance of this because these are not just conservatives
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:26.400]  or Republican voters out in the streets complaining about this, folks. These are Democrats,
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:33.760]  big time, major Democrats, city council members, deputy assistant, everything. And they're all
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:37.280]  saying this is ludicrous, this illegal immigration problem. And they're out on the streets and you
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:41.840]  know who's leading the charge to stop it? Republican candidate for mayor Curtis Sliwa. And
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:46.640]  they're out there on the streets and they're seeing it. And a lot of them are now putting
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:51.360]  videos up and making statements saying, gee, I wish I would have voted for Sliwa. He might have
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.080]  done something about this problem. We're gonna have more about that on the other
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.320]  side and the latest out of Ukraine. Don't go anywhere.
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:25.920]  You name it. I mean, it's just so amazing. God gave it to us. And it's the strongest
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:31.760]  humanoid out there. Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid. Most brands are 5%
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:37.200]  cumulative. And that still does a great thing for you. This is the strongest anybody makes
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:44.640]  95% for humanoid. I am so glad this is back. I have been out of this myself for months.

[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:15.920]  companies and industry to use. One of the top pesticides used is atrazine. The allowable

[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:29.540]  All right, I want to go to the streets of New York City now, show you a little scene
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:34.940]  of what's going on there with the illegal immigrants and a breakdown from a Queens resident.
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:38.820]  And then we're going to get into the situation in Ukraine and Elon Musk.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:43.419]  But first, let's go to the streets of New York, a Queens resident breaking it down in Clip
[01:47:43.419 --> 01:47:44.419]  9.
[01:47:44.419 --> 01:47:45.419]  I drive by here every day.
[01:47:45.419 --> 01:47:46.419]  These guys party.
[01:47:46.419 --> 01:47:47.419]  They're not partying tonight because we're here.
[01:47:47.419 --> 01:47:48.419]  I mean, literally, they're partying, smoking weed, music.
[01:47:48.419 --> 01:47:49.419]  It's insane.
[01:47:49.419 --> 01:47:50.419]  He's talking about illegal immigrants.
[01:47:50.419 --> 01:47:51.419]  Media doesn't cover this for some reason.
[01:47:51.419 --> 01:47:52.419]  It's just they don't cover it.
[01:47:52.419 --> 01:47:53.419]  I'm like, are you...
[01:47:53.419 --> 01:47:54.419]  I feel like I'm in a bizarro world.
[01:47:54.419 --> 01:47:55.419]  They don't cover this.
[01:47:55.419 --> 01:47:56.419]  And I'm trying to stay alive.
[01:47:56.419 --> 01:47:57.419]  This is acceptable?
[01:47:57.419 --> 01:47:58.419]  You got to protect the Biden.
[01:47:58.419 --> 01:47:59.419]  You got to protect the Biden administration and the Democrats.
[01:47:59.419 --> 01:48:00.419]  This is the normal stuff right here.
[01:48:00.419 --> 01:48:01.419]  Screw this on the sidewalk.
[01:48:01.419 --> 01:48:02.419]  No, mind you, this is the school right here.
[01:48:02.419 --> 01:48:03.419]  This is just normal stuff.
[01:48:03.419 --> 01:48:04.419]  This is the safe stuff.
[01:48:04.419 --> 01:48:05.419]  There's other stuff.
[01:48:05.419 --> 01:48:06.419]  You would think a major news network would come here and cover this.
[01:48:06.419 --> 01:48:07.419]  Right across from the school, huh?
[01:48:07.419 --> 01:48:08.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:08.419 --> 01:48:09.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:09.419 --> 01:48:10.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:10.419 --> 01:48:11.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:11.419 --> 01:48:12.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:13.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:13.419 --> 01:48:14.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:14.419 --> 01:48:15.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:15.419 --> 01:48:16.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:16.419 --> 01:48:17.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:17.419 --> 01:48:18.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:18.419 --> 01:48:19.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:19.419 --> 01:48:20.419]  Yeah.
[01:48:21.419 --> 01:48:26.419]  They don't cover it.
[01:48:26.419 --> 01:48:28.419]  It doesn't happen.
[01:48:28.419 --> 01:48:30.419]  They don't cover it.
[01:48:30.419 --> 01:48:32.419]  Right out here where we are.
[01:48:32.419 --> 01:48:33.419]  What is that?
[01:48:33.419 --> 01:48:34.419]  And then the school behind that is...
[01:48:34.419 --> 01:48:37.419]  It's 6 27 in the morning on Wednesday.
[01:48:37.419 --> 01:48:39.419]  Look at all, look at this.
[01:48:39.419 --> 01:48:43.419]  The city put these bike racks just after they opened for the school.
[01:48:43.419 --> 01:48:46.419]  There's a number of bike racks, see?
[01:48:46.419 --> 01:48:47.419]  Look at this.
[01:48:47.419 --> 01:48:48.419]  Yay!
[01:48:48.419 --> 01:48:54.419]  now they're showing all the illegal immigrants hanging outside the school
[01:48:54.419 --> 01:48:59.599]  they get free bikes they give them bike racks to set up so they can make tent
[01:48:59.599 --> 01:49:07.679]  cities this is nice this looks like I mean you gotta be kidding me and we're
[01:49:07.679 --> 01:49:13.080]  right outside the elementary school this is this I mean come on this is
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:25.160]  right this is what is this this is what we live in now this is acceptable look
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:32.000]  at this this is this is wrong they should come out here clip also get rid
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:41.280]  of this stuff there's their tent cities they got set up right next to
[01:49:41.299 --> 01:49:50.839]  the school great work there by frontlines and so Rebecca Brannon on the scene and
[01:49:50.839 --> 01:49:55.160]  so there's two elements to this actually and you kind of get a taste of
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.440]  it there's the element of the illegal immigrants taking over these cities the
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:03.400]  illegal immigrants getting better treatment than the citizens that's one
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:09.599]  aspect but there's another less understood aspect that you start to see
[01:50:09.599 --> 01:50:15.040]  metastasizing in that video locals are saying they're scratching the heads are
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:23.200]  saying why isn't this on the news see and so now the realization hits for
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:29.440]  many it already has hit Trump was a big factor this the fake news it's not
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:43.120]  news it's not news I would look I'll tell you there's about 10% of local
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:48.719]  news that is actually good at their job and actually reports the real news
[01:50:48.719 --> 01:50:53.440]  and you probably don't even know their politics because they're they
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.240]  don't they're just reporting the news so they'll tell you about the illegal
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.639]  immigrants they'll tell you about 100 by and everything else they're just
[01:50:58.639 --> 01:51:02.799]  that's about that's about 10% of your local news your local Fox your local
[01:51:02.799 --> 01:51:06.839]  CBS your local NBC that's about 10% that are actually doing journalistic
[01:51:06.839 --> 01:51:14.519]  work 90% just spend three hours in makeup they just like the prestige
[01:51:14.519 --> 01:51:20.679]  the air of being on TV and being on the local Fox CBS NBC outlet yeah
[01:51:20.679 --> 01:51:24.480]  they're big tough stuff and they wear their hair up and they got their big
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.759]  fancy suits and studios and they just feel prestigious and they take their
[01:51:27.759 --> 01:51:31.440]  fancy cars to five-star restaurants every night and they get recognized and
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:36.679]  all they do is read a teleprompter brought to you by Pfizer that's all
[01:51:36.679 --> 01:51:42.679]  they do and that's 90% of your local news oh let's not even get started
[01:51:42.679 --> 01:51:50.480]  on the cable news but see and I mean how many in the audience have had
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:52.920]  this similar experience I remember having this experience it happened
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:57.400]  multiple times I remember going to Trump rallies in 2015 and 16 and the local
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:02.360]  news wouldn't even cover them or they'd say nobody attended them 30,000 people I
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:06.599]  remember being in Ferguson Missouri on the ground covering the Mike Brown
[01:52:06.599 --> 01:52:10.360]  riots and and and sitting there watching the media lie about the whole
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:15.799]  thing and you're just like what is going on and you realize it's all fake
[01:52:15.799 --> 01:52:21.240]  and most people in local news are just airheads that read off a teleprompter
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:25.559]  now again I want to be clear there are great journalists out there in local
[01:52:25.559 --> 01:52:32.400]  news there are but it's about 10% 90% are airhead teleprompter readers that
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:36.519]  are just in it for the prestige that's it they don't have a clue what's going
[01:52:36.519 --> 01:52:39.240]  on hell you you break the news to them that there's an illegal immigrant
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:46.799]  tent city they wouldn't even know now moving on Elon Musk sues California for
[01:52:46.799 --> 01:52:50.160]  censorship more wars for the First Amendment but let's get into the
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:56.959]  situation in Ukraine. Zelensky on Starlink gate Elon Musk committing evil
[01:52:56.959 --> 01:53:03.400]  and driven by big ego no the Ukrainian regime asked Elon Musk to
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:08.400]  expand his Starlink technology so that the Ukrainians could attack and kill
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:13.320]  Russians and Elon Musk said I'm not gonna be a part of that good for him
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:19.679]  good for him and then they lied about it and now they're mad at him
[01:53:19.679 --> 01:53:22.679]  because he didn't want to facilitate Ukrainians killing Russians and an
[01:53:22.679 --> 01:53:26.719]  escalation that might lead to World War three and in fact whether you believe
[01:53:26.719 --> 01:53:31.879]  the Russian military or not is up to you but the Russian military came out
[01:53:31.879 --> 01:53:35.400]  and said if Ukraine would have launched that attack we would have responded
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:39.920]  with a nuclear weapon now you can believe that or not but that's what
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:43.759]  they said so you could you could reasonably say Elon Musk might have
[01:53:43.759 --> 01:53:48.160]  presented prevented a nuclear war or even World War three and Zelensky's pissed
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:50.679]  about that well what does that tell you about Zelensky you know who else is
[01:53:50.679 --> 01:53:56.320]  pissed about that Jake Tapper from CNN Jake Tapper from CNN I like World War I
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:01.440]  like nuclear war I'm mad because because Elon Musk didn't let Ukraine
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:05.959]  kill Russians he didn't want more war he didn't want more dead he didn't
[01:54:05.959 --> 01:54:09.639]  want to expand this war and have a nuclear war then we all die I have a
[01:54:09.639 --> 01:54:14.240]  death wish I'm Jake Tapper sing it around does that pretty much do that does that
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:25.200]  cover that they want to get more money to Ukraine America last Biden regime to
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:29.519]  send over 1 billion dollars in new aid to Ukraine includes 520 million for
[01:54:29.519 --> 01:54:32.799]  green energy so that's just straight-up theft that's just stealing your money
[01:54:32.799 --> 01:54:38.040]  and an additional six hundred sixty five point five million so that's 66
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:42.559]  that's 666 million you know they're really telling you what they like for
[01:54:42.559 --> 01:54:47.040]  security assistance security assistance how about some security assistance for us
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:52.599]  no no no they're gonna take away your second amendment and Woody Harrelson the
[01:54:52.599 --> 01:54:57.440]  great American Woody Harrelson I don't know if there's been a better response
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:00.480]  because they tried to set him up but he's not gonna be like one of these
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:05.040]  punks in Hollywood so they try to set him up with the Ukraine question
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:13.440]  and his response if not perfect brilliant in clip eight yeah I'm the
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:19.679]  kind of guy who just thinks it's abominable when a superpower with all
[01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:29.920]  this military might with no provocation attacks a country that is you know like
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:47.959]  like you know Iraq I mean does that say it or what but you know why that cuts
[01:55:47.959 --> 01:55:54.400]  so deep is because it exposes the fraud of American liberalism and it
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:00.440]  exposes the fraud of Democrat Party foreign policy and it shows that what
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:05.040]  is the real Democrat Party foreign policy it's whatever it's it's whatever
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.440]  it needs to be at the time so if it's George Bush in office then Democrats
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:13.599]  are anti-war but if it's Barack Obama in office then they'll turn the
[01:56:13.599 --> 01:56:17.000]  other they'll turn this they'll turn their eye a blind eye and say what war
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.719]  I don't see any war there's no war here or now with the situation
[01:56:20.719 --> 01:56:24.759]  in Ukraine if George Bush was doing this and funding this and getting involved
[01:56:24.759 --> 01:56:28.480]  in this they'd all hate the war in Ukraine if it was Donald Trump they'd all hate
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:32.879]  the war in Ukraine but because it's a Democrat Party policy and a liberal
[01:56:32.879 --> 01:56:37.440]  war then they love it and they can't get enough of it and he never wants to
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.280]  see millions of people down I mean that's just brilliant from Woody
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:46.519]  Harrelson and it just cuts to the heart of faux American liberal foreign
[01:56:46.519 --> 01:56:51.160]  policy that's anti-war they're not anti-war they never were
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:55.719]  all right we're gonna be coming up with special guests and some big news
