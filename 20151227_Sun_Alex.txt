[00:00.000 --> 00:15.920]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:15.920 --> 00:33.360]  We're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33.360 --> 00:43.920]  Why Obama is working with ISIS to eradicate Christianity is the fact that ISIS is created
[00:43.920 --> 00:50.480]  and funded by the West, by the US, by Turkey, by Saudi Arabia, and yet the media and pretty
[00:50.480 --> 00:56.400]  much all of our people running for office are pretending that this is some kind of external
[00:56.400 --> 00:59.520]  boogeyman that we have absolutely nothing to do with.
[00:59.520 --> 01:03.440]  So we need to fear it, and we need to throw away the Constitution, all of our rights in
[01:03.440 --> 01:05.000]  order to deal with it.
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.160]  I think that is the biggest story, and so Alex is going to be breaking that down for
[01:08.160 --> 01:09.160]  us in the next segment.
[01:09.160 --> 01:14.000]  We're also going to be talking about the real gringes of Christmas, socialism, political
[01:14.000 --> 01:15.000]  correctness.
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.800]  We're going to talk about what's happened in Central America.
[01:17.800 --> 01:22.760]  Christmas is dead in the places that Bernie Sanders, and I call him Bernie Sanders Nista.
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.480]  He loves Nicaragua, the Sandinistas, all of these socialist revolutions that he and
[01:27.480 --> 01:29.840]  the Pope push out of Central America.
[01:29.840 --> 01:34.200]  The fruit of that has come down on people this year especially.
[01:34.200 --> 01:39.000]  So we're seeing a massive collapse of the left in Central and South America.
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.440]  We're also going to be talking about lawsuits coming up with the TSA.
[01:44.440 --> 01:48.480]  John Corbett is back to sue the TSA because now they're saying, well, we're going to force
[01:48.480 --> 01:55.800]  you through these ineffective machines that scan you that a lot of people believe have
[01:55.800 --> 01:56.800]  health issues.
[01:56.800 --> 02:01.560]  And of course, John Corbett has proved in the past that they are not effective.
[02:01.560 --> 02:04.320]  He's been able to go through a lawsuit with them.
[02:04.320 --> 02:08.680]  He made a very public video where he showed that he could go through these carrying a
[02:08.680 --> 02:12.840]  gun in certain places and they would not be detected.
[02:12.840 --> 02:18.720]  But again, this all comes down to the loss of freedoms, the death by 1,000 cuts, this
[02:18.720 --> 02:22.160]  incrementalism, the way they destroy and take our liberties.
[02:22.160 --> 02:27.040]  Another lawsuit that's being filed by gun owners of America, Larry Pratt and others, is tackling
[02:27.040 --> 02:33.400]  the idea that our government would not only create these secret lists that they do to
[02:33.400 --> 02:36.440]  put people on terror watch list to put us on no fly list.
[02:36.440 --> 02:40.520]  We never know we're on this list, but now they're going to attach punishments with it.
[02:40.520 --> 02:44.920]  Now, whether or not you agree with the Second Amendment, whether or not you agree that people
[02:44.920 --> 02:50.000]  should have the right of self-defense, possessing firearms, whether or not you agree with that,
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.520]  that's not the issue here. The issue here is that can the government, based on an anonymous
[02:55.520 --> 03:01.920]  accusation, put penalties against you, withdraw certain rights, do certain actions based on
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.400]  something where you have no due process, you're not allowed to know what the charges are,
[03:05.400 --> 03:09.240]  you don't even know you've been put on this list, you don't even know you've been charged
[03:09.240 --> 03:13.280]  with this, you have no way to clear your name in court, you don't even know that you are
[03:13.280 --> 03:17.000]  on these lists until you find out you can't fly, until you find out that you can't get
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.560]  a gun, until you find out that other penalties that they're going to establish if we allow
[03:21.560 --> 03:25.880]  this precedent to be set, this is not where it's going to stop.
[03:25.880 --> 03:29.960]  Understand that the RICO Statutes were originally targeted towards organized crime. They said,
[03:29.960 --> 03:33.400]  we can't get a conviction these guys have so much money they can hire the best lawyers,
[03:33.400 --> 03:37.520]  they can get off on technicalities and loopholes. So we need to have this RICO Statute where
[03:37.520 --> 03:42.800]  we can, if we think that this is a bad guy, we can suspend due process for them. We declare
[03:42.800 --> 03:47.520]  them as being a racketeer and then we can do whatever we want. It didn't take very long
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.200]  before that law was used against people who are protesting at abortion clinics. And now
[03:52.200 --> 03:56.640]  we've got people saying, well, I don't like people who own guns, so let's use the RICO
[03:56.640 --> 04:00.280]  Statutes to try to come after gun manufacturers.
[04:00.280 --> 04:05.880]  See, once you allow that principle, even though it may initially make sense, they always put
[04:05.880 --> 04:09.800]  it out there in a way that it will initially make sense, once you allow that principle,
[04:09.800 --> 04:13.480]  they will use that to destroy all of your rights. We're also going to be talking about
[04:13.480 --> 04:19.200]  a referendum that's coming up in Switzerland, a referendum that would basically stop fractional
[04:19.200 --> 04:25.480]  banking. And we don't have time to do a tutorial on fractional banking, but we will touch on
[04:25.480 --> 04:31.280]  that a little bit. We have a story about a brain dead son who was guarded by his armed
[04:31.280 --> 04:37.000]  father and lived to see another Christmas. We're going to be talking about many different
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.380]  issues, but when we come back, Alex Jones is going to be breaking down why Obama is
[04:41.380 --> 04:46.480]  working with ISIS to eradicate Christianity and also to eradicate America. We'll be right
[04:46.480 --> 04:47.480]  back.
[04:47.480 --> 05:03.320]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in. No one has put together a formula
[05:03.320 --> 05:21.640]  for this to work.
[05:21.640 --> 05:32.800]  That is the only theory the flicker in the internet needs.
[05:32.800 --> 05:36.200]  less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of brain force.
[05:36.200 --> 05:37.880]  There's always hidden additives in your food,
[05:37.880 --> 05:39.480]  even organic food has hidden additives.
[05:39.480 --> 05:41.400]  Staring at the computer all day working doing good,
[05:41.400 --> 05:42.920]  you're still damaging your brain.
[05:42.920 --> 05:44.920]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[05:44.920 --> 05:47.040]  It doesn't have stimulus, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[05:47.040 --> 05:49.080]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[05:49.080 --> 05:52.440]  You will find brain force and other game changing products
[05:52.440 --> 05:57.440]  at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[05:57.440 --> 06:05.440]  They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in the Santa Fe,
[06:06.440 --> 06:12.440]  lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[06:12.440 --> 06:16.440]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[06:16.440 --> 06:19.440]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that game.
[06:19.440 --> 06:24.440]  And Alex Jones here with a special report that we're filing over the weekend
[06:24.440 --> 06:28.440]  to discuss the growing terror threat, not just here in the United States,
[06:28.440 --> 06:31.440]  Europe, but also in China as well.
[06:31.440 --> 06:36.440]  And with the backdrop of mainstream media and major governments telling us
[06:36.440 --> 06:42.440]  brace for jihadist attacks, we're told that nothing should be done
[06:42.440 --> 06:46.440]  to actually screen who's coming into the country.
[06:46.440 --> 06:48.440]  Now in a few minutes I'm going to take you back into the newsroom
[06:48.440 --> 06:52.440]  and go over mainstream news articles and government press releases
[06:52.440 --> 06:58.440]  admitting that they are indeed loosening controls on people coming in
[06:58.440 --> 07:00.440]  from the Middle East and North Africa.
[07:00.440 --> 07:05.440]  In many cases not even screening the so-called refugees,
[07:05.440 --> 07:09.440]  many of which have already been found in the United States and Europe
[07:09.440 --> 07:14.440]  to be actual jihad fighters who traveled from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan
[07:14.440 --> 07:18.440]  and other nations into Syria to wage jihad.
[07:18.440 --> 07:22.440]  Now the Russians are defeating them there with the Syrian government
[07:22.440 --> 07:25.440]  and people they're flooding into Turkey.
[07:25.440 --> 07:29.440]  But with the heightened terror alert happening in the background,
[07:29.440 --> 07:34.440]  something else was announced the day before Christmas.
[07:34.440 --> 07:35.440]  That's right.
[07:35.440 --> 07:39.440]  The TSA had had opt-outs for naked body scanners,
[07:39.440 --> 07:42.440]  namely because it violates federal and state law
[07:42.440 --> 07:46.440]  on taking pornographic pictures on people under 18 years of age.
[07:46.440 --> 07:50.440]  That's why at courthouses around the country that have put the naked body scanners in,
[07:50.440 --> 07:53.440]  they exempt people under the age of 18.
[07:53.440 --> 07:59.440]  Well, now the TSA is announcing that they changed their policy, which trumps law.
[07:59.440 --> 08:04.440]  Kind of like Obama has a policy to shut down over a thousand of our coal-powered plants
[08:04.440 --> 08:07.440]  doubling electricity prices the last seven years.
[08:07.440 --> 08:12.440]  Congress said no to the law they tried to pass, but Obama has a policy.
[08:12.440 --> 08:17.440]  Well, the TSA, who now has checkpoints at train stations and on our streets
[08:17.440 --> 08:22.440]  and have even shown up at movie theaters and high school graduations to keep us safe,
[08:22.440 --> 08:27.440]  they're announcing that they're not going to let you opt out anymore.
[08:27.440 --> 08:29.440]  They're going to force you to go through the naked body scanners.
[08:29.440 --> 08:33.440]  And a lawsuit has been filed by the gentleman that proved a few years ago
[08:33.440 --> 08:36.440]  that you could sneak bombs through the TSA.
[08:36.440 --> 08:39.440]  They've never busted one terrorist with them.
[08:39.440 --> 08:42.440]  A real terrorist would put the bomb on a suitcase and sneak it in
[08:42.440 --> 08:47.440]  like the Russian airliner that got blown up flying out of Egypt a few months ago.
[08:47.440 --> 08:48.440]  That's been proven.
[08:48.440 --> 08:52.440]  A real terrorist like an Israel would go up to the checkpoint line
[08:52.440 --> 08:54.440]  and blow up the group of people.
[08:54.440 --> 08:59.440]  You cannot stop people carrying out these events at the point of attack.
[08:59.440 --> 09:02.440]  You stop them by profiling and tracking who they are
[09:02.440 --> 09:05.440]  and keeping them from coming inside your country.
[09:05.440 --> 09:07.440]  I'm going to go show you these articles in a moment.
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.440]  It came out in the news days after they tried to cover up the San Bernardino terror attack
[09:12.440 --> 09:16.440]  being terrorist that the FBI had been on them two years before
[09:16.440 --> 09:22.440]  specifically tracking them in and out of training camps in Pakistan, in Saudi Arabia,
[09:22.440 --> 09:23.440]  he and his wife.
[09:23.440 --> 09:26.440]  And they sent a Justice Department task force down
[09:26.440 --> 09:30.440]  and criminally investigated the FBI and other Homeland Security people
[09:30.440 --> 09:33.440]  who tried to stop the specific attacks.
[09:33.440 --> 09:34.440]  Why is that?
[09:34.440 --> 09:37.440]  Because when the attacks happen, they use it to set up more checkpoints,
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.440]  more TSA for citizens and people that aren't connected to terror
[09:41.440 --> 09:44.440]  while leaving the borders wide open.
[09:44.440 --> 09:47.440]  And then separately, it's all selectively enforced
[09:47.440 --> 09:50.440]  where mainstream media, pundits, political operatives
[09:50.440 --> 09:53.440]  can call for Donald Trump's death.
[09:53.440 --> 09:54.440]  And that's okay.
[09:54.440 --> 09:57.440]  But he comes out and says Hillary got schlonged,
[09:57.440 --> 10:00.440]  which I always meant beaten really bad or defeated.
[10:00.440 --> 10:02.440]  I mean, that's the first time I've heard schlonged.
[10:02.440 --> 10:05.440]  I was in Colorado as a kid and saw a skier flip.
[10:05.440 --> 10:09.440]  And he went, whoa, man, that course just swung to me.
[10:09.440 --> 10:10.440]  It's a Yiddish term.
[10:10.440 --> 10:14.440]  They're saying he's anti-Semitic now for using a Yiddish term.
[10:14.440 --> 10:19.440]  Folks, major universities are restricting ethnic food, Chinese, sushi,
[10:19.440 --> 10:22.440]  Mexican, because people are complaining it's racist
[10:22.440 --> 10:25.440]  to have selections on the menu different days.
[10:25.440 --> 10:27.440]  What's it going to be, gray gruel?
[10:27.440 --> 10:30.440]  So while we leave the borders open, we all get our genitals grubbed
[10:30.440 --> 10:33.440]  or put naked body scanners while the terrorists are brought in.
[10:33.440 --> 10:36.440]  And while they're banning what food you can have on menus
[10:36.440 --> 10:38.440]  and banning streaming of White Christmas,
[10:38.440 --> 10:40.440]  they're taking all of our basic freedoms.
[10:40.440 --> 10:43.440]  I mean, this is crazy, but it's really happening.
[10:43.440 --> 10:46.440]  So let's go inside the real terror threat
[10:46.440 --> 10:49.440]  and how it's being used to destroy our Bill of Rights
[10:49.440 --> 10:51.440]  and our Constitution.
[10:51.440 --> 10:53.440]  You know, George W. Bush famously said the terrorists attack us
[10:53.440 --> 10:55.440]  because they hate our freedom.
[10:55.440 --> 10:56.440]  That's actually true.
[10:56.440 --> 10:58.440]  The globalists that run our government,
[10:58.440 --> 11:00.440]  they run the terrorists, they're the real terrorists,
[11:00.440 --> 11:05.440]  and they're attacking us and letting ISIS and others constitute themselves
[11:05.440 --> 11:09.440]  and rebuild themselves because the globalists do hate our freedoms
[11:09.440 --> 11:11.440]  and they're going to use the threat they've helped create
[11:11.440 --> 11:13.440]  that they've protected to take our freedoms.
[11:13.440 --> 11:17.440]  Let's go in the newsroom and look at the articles for ourselves.
[11:17.440 --> 11:21.440]  Now to be clear, there is an alliance between socialist governments,
[11:21.440 --> 11:25.440]  mainstream media, and radical Islam all over the Western world
[11:25.440 --> 11:28.440]  to suppress the free speech of Christians,
[11:28.440 --> 11:30.440]  to cover up the fact that Christians are being persecuted,
[11:30.440 --> 11:33.440]  and to cover up the fact that real liberals,
[11:33.440 --> 11:36.440]  Thomas Jefferson types, true egalitarians,
[11:36.440 --> 11:41.440]  are being attacked in socialist countries and Muslim countries,
[11:41.440 --> 11:44.440]  and to truly sickening alliance.
[11:44.440 --> 11:46.440]  You have to ask yourself, why is this happening?
[11:46.440 --> 11:52.440]  Because true liberalism threatens the totalitarian left that's taking over
[11:52.440 --> 11:56.440]  and who is allied with the controlled right worldwide.
[11:56.440 --> 12:00.440]  This is a synthetic form of politics where both left and right are controlled,
[12:00.440 --> 12:04.440]  that they're using leftist politics to launch their takeovers.
[12:04.440 --> 12:06.440]  So here's some of the articles I talked about.
[12:06.440 --> 12:09.440]  Whistleblower, Fed shut down terror investigation
[12:09.440 --> 12:11.440]  that could have prevented San Bernardino attack.
[12:11.440 --> 12:13.440]  That's a daily caller article.
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.440]  It was also in the Sacramento Bee, goes over how the Justice Department
[12:17.440 --> 12:21.440]  investigated the investigators that tried to stop it,
[12:21.440 --> 12:24.440]  and investigated that they might have been, quote, racist, you see.
[12:24.440 --> 12:28.440]  Boom, the Atlantic, even the leftist Atlantic says it's crazy.
[12:28.440 --> 12:30.440]  A food fighter to Oberlin College,
[12:30.440 --> 12:34.440]  students complain that sushi and other ethnic food
[12:34.440 --> 12:39.440]  are culturally stolen, appropriation, and racist.
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.440]  So different selections, just a wide selection of food,
[12:42.440 --> 12:45.440]  Italian, Mexican, sushi, Chinese,
[12:45.440 --> 12:47.440]  I wish when I was in college they had all that,
[12:47.440 --> 12:50.440]  that's hateful appropriation when you eat pizza,
[12:50.440 --> 12:52.440]  because you hate Italians, let's continue.
[12:52.440 --> 12:53.440]  Or it's a theft of culture.
[12:53.440 --> 12:56.440]  Really, I thought true liberalism was about a melting pot.
[12:56.440 --> 13:00.440]  And then all of us being tolerant and taking what we like from each other's cultures
[13:00.440 --> 13:01.440]  and creating a better culture.
[13:01.440 --> 13:04.440]  No, they're at war with Renaissance.
[13:04.440 --> 13:06.440]  Let's continue.
[13:06.440 --> 13:07.440]  Kill Trump.
[13:07.440 --> 13:11.440]  Liberals react to Republican front-runners' comments on Muslim immigration.
[13:11.440 --> 13:13.440]  You can read all the Twitters in FullWars.com article,
[13:13.440 --> 13:15.440]  and the media defended it.
[13:15.440 --> 13:16.440]  Another story.
[13:16.440 --> 13:19.440]  Casey Co-Chair, you've got to take Trump out with a headshot.
[13:19.440 --> 13:22.440]  You can go watch the video and audio right here.
[13:22.440 --> 13:24.440]  So it's okay to call for killing Trump,
[13:24.440 --> 13:28.440]  but if you even criticize radical Islam,
[13:28.440 --> 13:30.440]  you must be horrible and should be shut down.
[13:30.440 --> 13:31.440]  Let's continue.
[13:31.440 --> 13:33.440]  Caliphate Cub Scouts.
[13:33.440 --> 13:36.440]  Now the groups are teaching children to torture and kill infidels,
[13:36.440 --> 13:38.440]  and there's videos of that.
[13:38.440 --> 13:41.440]  Oh, but that's all okay, and the left won't criticize it.
[13:41.440 --> 13:45.440]  Hundreds of ISIS jihadists already in Europe associated press.
[13:45.440 --> 13:48.440]  Of course, there's hundreds, probably thousands.
[13:48.440 --> 13:51.440]  And again, the government knows this.
[13:51.440 --> 13:52.440]  Big bombshell, though.
[13:52.440 --> 13:56.440]  Seymour Hirsch, U.S. military shared intelligence with Assad
[13:56.440 --> 13:58.440]  in defiance of Obama's CIA.
[13:58.440 --> 14:01.440]  That's now come out in the London Review of Books and his new book.
[14:01.440 --> 14:04.440]  And of course, we already told you this years ago,
[14:04.440 --> 14:06.440]  but here's the news.
[14:06.440 --> 14:08.440]  Now, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, Hirsch,
[14:08.440 --> 14:10.440]  has actually talked to the generals.
[14:10.440 --> 14:12.440]  Well, we've seen the generals go public and say,
[14:12.440 --> 14:14.440]  we've been ordered to release al-Qaeda.
[14:14.440 --> 14:16.440]  We've been ordered to protect ISIS.
[14:16.440 --> 14:19.440]  We've been ordered to let them into the West, and it's wrong.
[14:19.440 --> 14:21.440]  And we told you a few years ago that Dempsey and others,
[14:21.440 --> 14:23.440]  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs then,
[14:23.440 --> 14:25.440]  went to the White House and said,
[14:25.440 --> 14:28.440]  we're not going to take out Assad for al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia.
[14:28.440 --> 14:31.440]  So this was a historic moment, folks,
[14:31.440 --> 14:34.440]  almost as big as the general staff trying to take out Hitler,
[14:34.440 --> 14:36.440]  and you're not hearing about it in the news.
[14:36.440 --> 14:38.440]  You think about it when Seymour Hirsch puts it out to be in the news.
[14:38.440 --> 14:41.440]  Let's continue, because it's part of a larger alliance
[14:41.440 --> 14:44.440]  between the socialist and the radical Muslims,
[14:44.440 --> 14:47.440]  Christianity, and even the liberal.
[14:47.440 --> 14:50.440]  Archbishop of Canterbury has come out and said,
[14:50.440 --> 14:52.440]  Christians face Middle East elimination.
[14:52.440 --> 14:55.440]  The UN admits double the persecution of Christians
[14:55.440 --> 14:57.440]  the last seven years.
[14:57.440 --> 14:59.440]  Oh, who got in office seven years ago,
[14:59.440 --> 15:01.440]  and they're being exterminated worldwide.
[15:01.440 --> 15:04.440]  More persecution than Christians than all of the groups combined.
[15:04.440 --> 15:06.440]  White Christmas, PC Snow job,
[15:06.440 --> 15:09.440]  key report up on infowars.com.
[15:09.440 --> 15:12.440]  Yes, major colleges and even college radio stations
[15:12.440 --> 15:15.440]  are restricting it because white Christmas is hateful.
[15:15.440 --> 15:17.440]  The word white is bad.
[15:17.440 --> 15:19.440]  It deals with snow, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:19.440 --> 15:21.440]  You can go see that report.
[15:21.440 --> 15:24.440]  This is what's happening. This is what's unfolding.
[15:24.440 --> 15:32.440]  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
[15:32.440 --> 15:34.440]  Oops, sorry. I better cut that off.
[15:34.440 --> 15:35.440]  It's politically incorrect.
[15:35.440 --> 15:38.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're being culturally enslaved.
[15:38.440 --> 15:40.440]  Wake up and say no to it.
[15:40.440 --> 15:42.440]  Speak out like folks at Trump rallies
[15:42.440 --> 15:44.440]  with Hillary for prison shirts.
[15:44.440 --> 15:46.440]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off for infowars.com.

[17:50.440 --> 17:53.440]  And they're all available this Christmas season
[17:53.440 --> 17:56.440]  infowarslife.com.
[17:57.440 --> 18:00.440]  I love our kids. I love our kids.
[18:00.440 --> 18:03.440]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me
[18:03.440 --> 18:05.440]  to do the research to develop a true
[18:05.440 --> 18:08.440]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out
[18:08.440 --> 18:10.440]  and help children focus.
[18:10.440 --> 18:13.440]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[18:13.440 --> 18:16.440]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[18:16.440 --> 18:19.440]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[18:19.440 --> 18:22.440]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[18:22.440 --> 18:25.440]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[18:25.440 --> 18:28.440]  and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[18:28.440 --> 18:31.440]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula
[18:31.440 --> 18:33.440]  with the highest quality ingredients that children
[18:33.440 --> 18:34.440]  would actually like and take.
[18:34.440 --> 18:36.440]  We worked with the leading manufacturer
[18:36.440 --> 18:38.440]  to manufacture and nutritional supplements
[18:38.440 --> 18:40.440]  that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable
[18:40.440 --> 18:42.440]  and powerful calming formula out there.
[18:42.440 --> 18:45.440]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts
[18:45.440 --> 18:48.440]  like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients
[18:48.440 --> 18:50.440]  that taste great.

[18:53.440 --> 18:57.440]  That's Child Ease exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[18:57.440 --> 19:00.440]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[19:00.440 --> 19:03.440]  No one has put together a formula that focuses
[19:03.440 --> 19:06.440]  directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[19:06.440 --> 19:09.440]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[19:09.440 --> 19:12.440]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ,
[19:12.440 --> 19:14.440]  is backed by major clinical studies.

[19:30.440 --> 19:32.440]  to support the body's natural systems.
[19:32.440 --> 19:34.440]  Introducing the new infowarslife.com
[19:34.440 --> 19:36.440]  Oil of oregano formulation.

[19:38.440 --> 19:41.440]  and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[19:43.440 --> 19:45.440]  and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[19:45.440 --> 19:47.440]  You will no longer need to endure the burning
[19:47.440 --> 19:49.440]  of liquid oregano on the tongue.

[20:23.440 --> 20:26.440]  It's complex to be managed by self-rule.
[20:26.440 --> 20:29.440]  But government by an elite group is superior
[20:29.440 --> 20:35.440]  to government for, by and of the people.
[20:35.440 --> 20:37.440]  The Alex Jones Show
[20:37.440 --> 20:41.440]  because there is a war on for your mind.
[20:41.440 --> 20:44.440]  Hello me, meet the real me.
[20:44.440 --> 20:46.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:46.440 --> 20:51.440]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Sunday, December 27th, 2015.
[20:51.440 --> 20:53.440]  I just heard Ronald Reagan as he was campaigning
[20:53.440 --> 20:55.440]  to talk about how we can solve things
[20:55.440 --> 20:57.440]  on an individual basis.
[20:57.440 --> 20:59.440]  There was a story that I saw about Christmas
[20:59.440 --> 21:01.440]  and I hope you all had a merry Christmas.
[21:01.440 --> 21:03.440]  When I looked at this, I thought,
[21:03.440 --> 21:06.440]  this really gets to the heart of what
[21:06.440 --> 21:08.440]  Alexis de Tocqueville was talking about
[21:08.440 --> 21:10.440]  when he came to America in the early 1800s.
[21:10.440 --> 21:12.440]  He wrote a book, I hope you're familiar with it.
[21:12.440 --> 21:15.440]  It's called Democracy in America.
[21:15.440 --> 21:17.440]  He was a Frenchman and he came to America
[21:17.440 --> 21:20.440]  and he was curious as to why America worked so well.
[21:20.440 --> 21:23.440]  He was very oriented towards freedom,
[21:23.440 --> 21:25.440]  towards liberty, but he also had a pragmatic side to him.
[21:25.440 --> 21:27.440]  He looked at it and he said, you know,
[21:27.440 --> 21:29.440]  what sets Americans apart from Europeans
[21:29.440 --> 21:33.440]  is that they use voluntary associations
[21:33.440 --> 21:35.440]  to solve the problems of the community
[21:35.440 --> 21:39.440]  rather than having an upper class
[21:39.440 --> 21:42.440]  that they turn to a philanthropist
[21:42.440 --> 21:44.440]  or a socialist government
[21:44.440 --> 21:47.440]  as they were trying to enact in France.
[21:47.440 --> 21:49.440]  They would do things themselves.
[21:49.440 --> 21:51.440]  They would work together voluntarily
[21:51.440 --> 21:53.440]  to solve the problems in their community,
[21:53.440 --> 21:56.440]  not try to solve them from the most distant place
[21:56.440 --> 21:58.440]  they can find, either in Washington
[21:58.440 --> 22:00.440]  or some global governance.
[22:00.440 --> 22:02.440]  No, they tried to do it in their own community
[22:02.440 --> 22:05.440]  and that's one of the reasons why they were successful in it.
[22:05.440 --> 22:07.440]  Just talking about groups of ordinary people
[22:07.440 --> 22:09.440]  pooling their resources,
[22:09.440 --> 22:11.440]  helping their neighbors that they can see
[22:11.440 --> 22:13.440]  are truly in need.
[22:13.440 --> 22:15.440]  That always works best.
[22:15.440 --> 22:17.440]  I saw this story about what happened in Dallas.
[22:17.440 --> 22:20.440]  This is an America that is all but gone now,
[22:20.440 --> 22:22.440]  but it's always good for us to remember
[22:22.440 --> 22:24.440]  what we can do when we work together
[22:24.440 --> 22:27.440]  to help people on a one-to-one basis,
[22:27.440 --> 22:29.440]  just doing it as an association.
[22:29.440 --> 22:31.440]  So this is the Omni Hotel in Dallas.
[22:31.440 --> 22:33.440]  They opened their door to 500 homeless people on Christmas Eve
[22:33.440 --> 22:35.440]  as a way of giving back to the community.
[22:35.440 --> 22:37.440]  They said they come in here with smiles on their faces
[22:37.440 --> 22:39.440]  from ear to ear.
[22:39.440 --> 22:41.440]  Let's play a little bit of that clip.
[22:41.440 --> 22:44.440]  2011 was the first time Ed Natsammer
[22:44.440 --> 22:47.440]  invited the homeless to be guests at the Omni Dallas Hotel.
[22:47.440 --> 22:51.440]  They come in with the smiles on their face from ear to ear.
[22:51.440 --> 22:55.440]  The smiles were on the faces of 500 men, women and children,
[22:55.440 --> 22:57.440]  often overlooked.
[22:57.440 --> 23:00.440]  Homeless families were VIPs that Christmas Eve.
[23:00.440 --> 23:03.440]  Now in year five, the hotel GM wants one family
[23:03.440 --> 23:07.440]  to check out of his hotel and into their own home.
[23:07.440 --> 23:09.440]  We are going to sort of adopt a family.
[23:09.440 --> 23:11.440]  We're calling it a home for the holidays
[23:11.440 --> 23:13.440]  and we're going to try to find 2,500 people
[23:13.440 --> 23:15.440]  that can give $12.
[23:15.440 --> 23:17.440]  Aw, thank you, Grace. Thank you so much.
[23:17.440 --> 23:19.440]  Here, wait, get a sticker.
[23:19.440 --> 23:21.440]  Omni workers are rallying behind a home for the holidays
[23:21.440 --> 23:23.440]  and taking from their paychecks to health.
[23:23.440 --> 23:25.440]  I think that's great.
[23:25.440 --> 23:28.440]  I really do because I've been in situations in my life
[23:28.440 --> 23:32.440]  where I didn't know where I was going to eat or stay sometimes.
[23:32.440 --> 23:34.440]  The way I look at it is the Lord has blessed me
[23:34.440 --> 23:36.440]  beyond what I can even imagine,
[23:36.440 --> 23:38.440]  so why not go ahead and do what I'm supposed to do
[23:38.440 --> 23:40.440]  and give to others?
[23:40.440 --> 23:42.440]  It's good to be a part of something bigger than yourself.
[23:42.440 --> 23:45.440]  Netsammer's big ambition of a home for the holidays
[23:45.440 --> 23:47.440]  came Christmas Eve a year ago.
[23:47.440 --> 23:49.440]  The words at the Omni this time of year,
[23:49.440 --> 23:54.440]  hope, peace, joy inspired him as he greeted hundreds of homeless.
[23:54.440 --> 23:56.440]  Is it the bright light or are you a little teary-eyed
[23:56.440 --> 23:58.440]  when you talk about this?
[23:58.440 --> 24:00.440]  You know, last year I was able to bring my 12-year-old son.
[24:00.440 --> 24:02.440]  Yes, he was moved by his guests,
[24:02.440 --> 24:06.440]  but also what he saw in his 12-year-old son, Ryan, that day.
[24:06.440 --> 24:08.440]  I've got to tell you, 12-year-old kids,
[24:08.440 --> 24:10.440]  they're on video games all the time,
[24:10.440 --> 24:12.440]  and I've got to move them.
[24:12.440 --> 24:14.440]  And for my son to put down his video games
[24:14.440 --> 24:16.440]  and have an interest in something that was so important to me,
[24:16.440 --> 24:18.440]  was pretty special.
[24:18.440 --> 24:20.440]  One of the things he shows there is hope,
[24:20.440 --> 24:22.440]  and the kind of hope that he's offering people.
[24:22.440 --> 24:24.440]  He says, I said, my hope is that none of you
[24:24.440 --> 24:27.440]  will be back in the same shape next year.
[24:27.440 --> 24:29.440]  See, that's the difference.
[24:29.440 --> 24:31.440]  When you create a welfare state,
[24:31.440 --> 24:33.440]  and I know I've got a relative who,
[24:33.440 --> 24:35.440]  it works as part of the welfare state up in the Northeast,
[24:35.440 --> 24:39.440]  up in New York, and she talks about people as her clients.
[24:39.440 --> 24:43.440]  They understand that the bread line that they put people in
[24:43.440 --> 24:45.440]  is really their meal ticket.
[24:45.440 --> 24:47.440]  They have no incentive to get you off of that,
[24:47.440 --> 24:49.440]  and they hope that you're going to be here next year,
[24:49.440 --> 24:52.440]  because if you're not, that means that their job
[24:52.440 --> 24:54.440]  doesn't really have any purpose, any meaning.
[24:54.440 --> 24:56.440]  It's a very different perspective
[24:56.440 --> 24:59.440]  than when people come together to help each other individually.
[24:59.440 --> 25:00.440]  They know who needs the help,
[25:00.440 --> 25:02.440]  they know who is slacking off and doesn't need the help,
[25:02.440 --> 25:05.440]  who's basically shirking what they need to do.
[25:05.440 --> 25:08.440]  I remember when Hillary Clinton was pushing healthcare,
[25:08.440 --> 25:10.440]  was it 20-plus years ago?
[25:10.440 --> 25:12.440]  Right after Bill Clinton got elected, of course,
[25:12.440 --> 25:14.440]  Hillary Clinton was pushing Hillary care.
[25:14.440 --> 25:16.440]  She was going for the whole enchilada.
[25:16.440 --> 25:19.440]  She wasn't trying to do this incrementalism like Obamacare.
[25:19.440 --> 25:21.440]  She was going for single-payer system.
[25:21.440 --> 25:26.440]  They actually had the audacity to tell people with a straight face
[25:26.440 --> 25:29.440]  that a single-payer system was going to get rid
[25:29.440 --> 25:32.440]  of the cost inefficiencies of having competition.
[25:32.440 --> 25:34.440]  What utter nonsense?
[25:34.440 --> 25:36.440]  I mean, you all understand, don't you,
[25:36.440 --> 25:38.440]  but if you've got two people competing for services,
[25:38.440 --> 25:40.440]  yes, it is an inefficiency.
[25:40.440 --> 25:42.440]  That's what John D. Rockefeller said.
[25:42.440 --> 25:45.440]  He said, competition is a sin because it hurt his profits.
[25:45.440 --> 25:46.440]  And so she was actually,
[25:46.440 --> 25:48.440]  when she's talking about a single-payer system,
[25:48.440 --> 25:52.440]  she is actually shilling for the John D. Rockefeller's out there,
[25:52.440 --> 25:54.440]  the people who wrote Obamacare,
[25:54.440 --> 25:56.440]  the people who were trying to get Hillary care passed.
[25:56.440 --> 25:59.440]  No, competition may not be good for the people
[25:59.440 --> 26:00.440]  who were providing the stuff.
[26:00.440 --> 26:02.440]  It may cut back on their profits,
[26:02.440 --> 26:04.440]  but that's how you get the cost down.
[26:04.440 --> 26:07.440]  That's how you provide a better deal to people.
[26:07.440 --> 26:08.440]  So I went to one of these meetings,
[26:08.440 --> 26:11.440]  and of course, this was a Democrat Party meeting
[26:11.440 --> 26:13.440]  that was run by the local congressmen.
[26:13.440 --> 26:15.440]  It was supposed to get everybody into a raw, raw mood
[26:15.440 --> 26:17.440]  to push for Hillary care.
[26:17.440 --> 26:18.440]  I got up and I spoke,
[26:18.440 --> 26:20.440]  and I used the word charity when I was talking,
[26:20.440 --> 26:25.440]  and I got pissed and booed like I was Donald Trump.
[26:25.440 --> 26:27.440]  You would not believe the animosity.
[26:27.440 --> 26:29.440]  I was kind of taken back by it
[26:29.440 --> 26:33.440]  because I didn't realize that charity was such a dirty word
[26:33.440 --> 26:35.440]  to the socialists, but yes it is.
[26:35.440 --> 26:37.440]  That's what they really hate.
[26:37.440 --> 26:38.440]  They want to lie to you and tell you
[26:38.440 --> 26:39.440]  that a single payer system
[26:39.440 --> 26:41.440]  is going to provide things more efficiently,
[26:41.440 --> 26:42.440]  that it's going to work.
[26:42.440 --> 26:43.440]  It won't.
[26:43.440 --> 26:45.440]  And they want to vilify people
[26:45.440 --> 26:47.440]  who would help each other on a one-to-one basis.
[26:47.440 --> 26:48.440]  That's what charity is.
[26:48.440 --> 26:50.440]  Charity really means love, right?
[26:50.440 --> 26:53.440]  It's taken from the old word
[26:53.440 --> 26:55.440]  that was translated as love in the Bible.
[26:55.440 --> 26:58.440]  So it's really showing love one to another
[26:58.440 --> 27:00.440]  at a local level, but they hate that.
[27:00.440 --> 27:03.440]  They think that they are entitled to what you have.
[27:03.440 --> 27:05.440]  That's a very different dynamic, isn't it?
[27:05.440 --> 27:06.440]  And you know it doesn't work.
[27:06.440 --> 27:08.440]  As Margaret Thatcher said,
[27:08.440 --> 27:09.440]  what happens to socialism
[27:09.440 --> 27:11.440]  is you eventually run out of other people's money.
[27:11.440 --> 27:14.440]  Well, that's happened all throughout Central America.
[27:14.440 --> 27:17.440]  Somebody needs to tell Bernie Sanders this.
[27:17.440 --> 27:18.440]  Bernie Sanders needs to.
[27:18.440 --> 27:20.440]  You know the guy who loves socialism so much,
[27:20.440 --> 27:22.440]  and he still hasn't learned the lesson,
[27:22.440 --> 27:24.440]  and his supporters haven't learned the lesson.
[27:24.440 --> 27:26.440]  That's the saddest thing.
[27:26.440 --> 27:28.440]  But here we are, 30 years later,
[27:28.440 --> 27:30.440]  and he still hasn't learned the lesson
[27:30.440 --> 27:32.440]  of socialism, the failure of it.
[27:32.440 --> 27:33.440]  Look at Venezuela.
[27:33.440 --> 27:37.440]  Christmas is dead, and 2016 looks dim.
[27:37.440 --> 27:38.440]  This is from AFP.
[27:38.440 --> 27:40.440]  They say Christmas is dead.
[27:40.440 --> 27:42.440]  It says Elise Bellisario,
[27:42.440 --> 27:43.440]  who like many Venezuelans
[27:43.440 --> 27:45.440]  can't afford to hang decorations
[27:45.440 --> 27:48.440]  or make a traditional holiday meal this year.
[27:48.440 --> 27:49.440]  That's it.
[27:49.440 --> 27:51.440]  See, that's the real grinch.
[27:51.440 --> 27:54.440]  The real grinch of Christmas is socialism,
[27:54.440 --> 27:56.440]  and of course, political correctness,
[27:56.440 --> 27:59.440]  which is a tool of socialism,
[27:59.440 --> 28:01.440]  a tool of censorship,
[28:01.440 --> 28:05.440]  trying to shame people into towing the party line.
[28:05.440 --> 28:06.440]  Now, they go on to say,
[28:06.440 --> 28:07.440]  where Christmas has passed,
[28:07.440 --> 28:09.440]  brought exuberant decorations
[28:09.440 --> 28:12.440]  and balconies drenched in lights in Venezuela this year,
[28:12.440 --> 28:15.440]  the streets are drab and dark.
[28:15.440 --> 28:17.440]  Now, they go on to say in this article,
[28:17.440 --> 28:20.440]  well, that's all changed because oil prices have plunged.
[28:20.440 --> 28:21.440]  No, that's one of the issues,
[28:21.440 --> 28:23.440]  but the real issue is socialism.
[28:23.440 --> 28:25.440]  I'll tell you how this is something
[28:25.440 --> 28:28.440]  that is much larger than just the oil economies
[28:28.440 --> 28:29.440]  that are there.
[28:29.440 --> 28:31.440]  This stretches out throughout Central America.
[28:31.440 --> 28:33.440]  They say people are worried more about buying food
[28:33.440 --> 28:35.440]  than giving gifts this year.
[28:35.440 --> 28:37.440]  And of course, Venezuelans gave the opposition
[28:37.440 --> 28:40.440]  a landslide victory in legislative elections this year,
[28:40.440 --> 28:44.440]  ending the Chavez movement's 16-year monopoly on power.
[28:44.440 --> 28:46.440]  We're going to tell you what it looks like
[28:46.440 --> 28:48.440]  in the rest of Central America.
[28:48.440 --> 28:51.440]  We're also going to be back with information about lawsuits,
[28:51.440 --> 28:53.440]  trying to get some of our freedoms back
[28:53.440 --> 28:56.440]  and some of the approaches on it will be right back.
[29:23.440 --> 29:26.440]  You'll also find other specials like the deep cleanse pack

[33:13.440 --> 33:15.440]  Hello, this is Hank Hill
[33:15.440 --> 33:19.440]  and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[33:19.440 --> 33:21.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:21.440 --> 33:23.440]  infowarsteam.com, yeah.
[33:28.440 --> 33:32.440]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[33:32.440 --> 33:35.440]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:40.440 --> 33:41.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:41.440 --> 33:42.440]  I'm David Knight.
[33:42.440 --> 33:45.440]  We're going to go back to the Gretch who stole Christmas.
[33:45.440 --> 33:47.440]  Of course, the Gretch is green.
[33:47.440 --> 33:50.440]  That's what we're going to see with these green policies
[33:50.440 --> 33:51.440]  coming up in the new year.
[33:51.440 --> 33:53.440]  They're going to steal your way of life.
[33:53.440 --> 33:55.440]  They're going to put you in the kind of poverty
[33:55.440 --> 33:57.440]  that we're seeing in Venezuela where people
[33:57.440 --> 33:59.440]  are not worried about Christmas decorations.
[33:59.440 --> 34:01.440]  They're not able to get gifts.
[34:01.440 --> 34:03.440]  They're just worried about how they're going to afford food.
[34:03.440 --> 34:06.440]  And we're seeing this happen throughout all of Central
[34:06.440 --> 34:08.440]  and South America.
[34:08.440 --> 34:09.440]  We're going to go back to that.
[34:09.440 --> 34:11.440]  Before we do, I just want to let you know about
[34:11.440 --> 34:13.440]  some of the sales that we have at infowars.
[34:13.440 --> 34:16.440]  We have the six month prison planet TV
[34:16.440 --> 34:19.440]  for free when you get a one year subscription.
[34:19.440 --> 34:21.440]  That takes it down to just 10 cents a day.
[34:21.440 --> 34:24.440]  And of course, prison planet TV is where I usually hang out
[34:24.440 --> 34:28.440]  along with Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, Rob Do,
[34:28.440 --> 34:30.440]  Darren McBreen, and Joe Biggs.
[34:30.440 --> 34:33.440]  We all report there as well as many people behind the scenes.
[34:33.440 --> 34:36.440]  That's your way of supporting our operation
[34:36.440 --> 34:40.440]  and making sure you get it every day on HD as it is happening.
[34:40.440 --> 34:42.440]  Of course, you can stream that on Roku, on Boxy,
[34:42.440 --> 34:45.440]  as well as your computer, tablet, or cell phone.
[34:45.440 --> 34:47.440]  You can get that for just 10 cents a day.
[34:47.440 --> 34:50.440]  And you can get access to all of Alex Jones' documentaries.
[34:50.440 --> 34:53.440]  That is a key way to wake people up.
[34:53.440 --> 34:55.440]  We can always try to give as much background as we can
[34:55.440 --> 34:57.440]  whenever we cover a new story.
[34:57.440 --> 35:00.440]  But it's really the documentaries that will wake people up.
[35:00.440 --> 35:02.440]  So right now we've got a once a year special.
[35:02.440 --> 35:04.440]  We always do this around the beginning of the year.
[35:04.440 --> 35:07.440]  Six months for free when you get an annual subscription
[35:07.440 --> 35:10.440]  at prison planet TV, just 10 cents a day.
[35:10.440 --> 35:13.440]  Also, we have some specials at the infowars store.
[35:13.440 --> 35:16.440]  We've got 33% off an essentials pack of survival shield,
[35:16.440 --> 35:20.440]  X2 nascent iodine, supermail, vitality, and silver bullet.
[35:20.440 --> 35:24.440]  We have 15% off winter sun, vitamin D3,
[35:24.440 --> 35:26.440]  17% off of deep cleanse.
[35:26.440 --> 35:27.440]  There are a lot of specials.
[35:27.440 --> 35:29.440]  You'll see those at infowarsstore.com.
[35:29.440 --> 35:31.440]  It's a way to support your health,
[35:31.440 --> 35:35.440]  a way to support the infowars operation as well.
[35:35.440 --> 35:37.440]  Now going back to this, as I was just mentioning,
[35:37.440 --> 35:40.440]  of course, I've been as well there seeing a lot of hardship.
[35:40.440 --> 35:42.440]  Yes, it is because of oil prices,
[35:42.440 --> 35:44.440]  but also because of the failed policy
[35:44.440 --> 35:47.440]  and the crony capitalism of the socialists.
[35:47.440 --> 35:49.440]  When you listen to Bernie Sanders,
[35:49.440 --> 35:53.440]  you would think that you don't have any crony capitalism,
[35:53.440 --> 35:56.440]  any corruption in a socialist government.
[35:56.440 --> 35:58.440]  That is pure nonsense.
[35:58.440 --> 36:00.440]  It is only to the extent that you have
[36:00.440 --> 36:02.440]  government control of things
[36:02.440 --> 36:04.440]  that you can have that kind of corruption.
[36:04.440 --> 36:06.440]  The reason we have it here is because the government
[36:06.440 --> 36:09.440]  has too much power, because the government has too much reach.
[36:09.440 --> 36:11.440]  That is why elections are becoming increasingly
[36:11.440 --> 36:13.440]  and exponentially more expensive here.
[36:13.440 --> 36:15.440]  You're not going to stop the corruption
[36:15.440 --> 36:18.440]  and the buying of elections by passing legislation
[36:18.440 --> 36:20.440]  or by public financing a campaign.
[36:20.440 --> 36:22.440]  You're only going to stop it
[36:22.440 --> 36:25.440]  when you stop the black hole of corruption.
[36:25.440 --> 36:27.440]  That comes about because we have turned over
[36:27.440 --> 36:30.440]  so much money and so much power to Washington.
[36:30.440 --> 36:33.440]  When you've got that much money and power in one place,
[36:33.440 --> 36:36.440]  it's going to act like a black hole for corruption.
[36:36.440 --> 36:38.440]  Here's a good example.
[36:38.440 --> 36:40.440]  It's not just Venezuela, of course.
[36:40.440 --> 36:42.440]  That is changing things.
[36:42.440 --> 36:44.440]  Argentina is throwing out their socialists.
[36:44.440 --> 36:46.440]  Brazil is throwing out their socialists
[36:46.440 --> 36:48.440]  just in the last couple of months.
[36:48.440 --> 36:50.440]  Now, in Argentina, this is a pro-business mayor
[36:50.440 --> 36:52.440]  that was elected.
[36:52.440 --> 36:54.440]  He was formerly a mayor.
[36:54.440 --> 36:56.440]  Now he is the president of Argentina.
[36:56.440 --> 36:58.440]  In his first week on the job,
[36:58.440 --> 37:00.440]  he dismantled taxes on farm exports
[37:00.440 --> 37:02.440]  as well as currency controls
[37:02.440 --> 37:05.440]  that were blamed for a flourishing black market.
[37:05.440 --> 37:07.440]  Now, there's also a probe
[37:07.440 --> 37:09.440]  that is going on there.
[37:09.440 --> 37:11.440]  And, of course, that is against the backdrop,
[37:11.440 --> 37:13.440]  they say, of not only a shrinking economy,
[37:13.440 --> 37:15.440]  but also widening corruption scandal
[37:15.440 --> 37:18.440]  at the state-run oil company.
[37:18.440 --> 37:20.440]  Millions of dollars in payouts
[37:20.440 --> 37:23.440]  from the oil giant to close allies.
[37:23.440 --> 37:25.440]  How does that happen?
[37:25.440 --> 37:27.440]  Well, that happens when the government has that kind of power,
[37:27.440 --> 37:29.440]  when it has that kind of control.
[37:29.440 --> 37:31.440]  And so socialism is not a cure, Bernie,
[37:31.440 --> 37:33.440]  for that kind of crony capitalism.
[37:33.440 --> 37:37.440]  Socialism exacerbates that kind of crony capitalism.
[37:37.440 --> 37:39.440]  As a matter of fact, Bernie Sanders,
[37:39.440 --> 37:41.440]  good friend with the Sandernistas,
[37:41.440 --> 37:43.440]  when he was thrown out,
[37:43.440 --> 37:45.440]  he was thrown out by coalition,
[37:45.440 --> 37:47.440]  not only conservatives and libertarians,
[37:47.440 --> 37:49.440]  but also of communists,
[37:49.440 --> 37:52.440]  because he was nothing but a kleptocrat.
[37:52.440 --> 37:54.440]  And that's the way these guys always go down.
[37:54.440 --> 37:56.440]  They always turn into thieves.
[37:56.440 --> 37:59.440]  And, of course, he had taken private property
[37:59.440 --> 38:01.440]  from the big corporations.
[38:01.440 --> 38:04.440]  He had nationalized it, but it went into his pockets.
[38:04.440 --> 38:06.440]  And just before he was left office,
[38:06.440 --> 38:08.440]  after being voted out,
[38:08.440 --> 38:11.440]  he reprivatized those things that he had stolen.
[38:11.440 --> 38:14.440]  He put them back into his own pockets,
[38:14.440 --> 38:16.440]  in the pockets of his buddies there.
[38:16.440 --> 38:19.440]  Now, it's not just socialism,
[38:19.440 --> 38:21.440]  and it's not just the greenies
[38:21.440 --> 38:23.440]  that are the gritches that are coming up.
[38:23.440 --> 38:25.440]  It's also political correctness.
[38:25.440 --> 38:27.440]  And we can see this, especially in France.
[38:27.440 --> 38:30.440]  Political correctness and a kind of fear
[38:30.440 --> 38:34.440]  that is instilled by the Islamic radicals in France.
[38:34.440 --> 38:36.440]  They're talking about what's French for Scrooge.
[38:36.440 --> 38:39.440]  Well, Christmas spirit is sagging
[38:39.440 --> 38:41.440]  in the city of lights in Paris.
[38:41.440 --> 38:43.440]  They say only 37% of French respondents
[38:43.440 --> 38:45.440]  said that they were looking forward to Christmas this year.
[38:45.440 --> 38:48.440]  And they compare that to about three-quarters of the people
[38:48.440 --> 38:50.440]  in Denmark, Norway, Germany, the UK.
[38:50.440 --> 38:53.440]  They say that 76% of the French respondents
[38:53.440 --> 38:56.440]  said that they felt the real meaning of Christmas
[38:56.440 --> 38:59.440]  had been lost and had become too commercialized.
[38:59.440 --> 39:01.440]  But there's other issues as well.
[39:01.440 --> 39:03.440]  They talk about in the French markets
[39:03.440 --> 39:05.440]  all across France.
[39:05.440 --> 39:07.440]  Christmas preparations, they say,
[39:07.440 --> 39:09.440]  have assumed a more solemn tone this week
[39:09.440 --> 39:11.440]  after a driver rammed his car
[39:11.440 --> 39:13.440]  into the center of a Christmas market
[39:13.440 --> 39:16.440]  in the western part of the city of Nantes,
[39:16.440 --> 39:18.440]  killing one, injuring a dozen other.
[39:18.440 --> 39:21.440]  Two other seemingly random attacks elsewhere
[39:21.440 --> 39:24.440]  have added to the sense of unease and insecurity.
[39:24.440 --> 39:28.440]  So they've got people with fully automatic weapons
[39:28.440 --> 39:30.440]  guarding the different marketplaces.
[39:30.440 --> 39:32.440]  That kind of puts a damper on Christmas.
[39:32.440 --> 39:34.440]  It also puts a damper on Christmas
[39:34.440 --> 39:37.440]  that has become, when you put on Christmas lights in France,
[39:37.440 --> 39:40.440]  you paint a target on your back from these Islamists,
[39:40.440 --> 39:42.440]  even though they want to pretend
[39:42.440 --> 39:46.440]  that these are seemingly random acts of violence.
[39:46.440 --> 39:51.440]  If you want to see the real vitriol that's coming from Islam,
[39:51.440 --> 39:53.440]  take a look at what happened with Donald Trump
[39:53.440 --> 39:56.440]  when he simply put out a tweet that said,
[39:56.440 --> 39:58.440]  Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.
[39:58.440 --> 40:00.440]  Wow, that's pretty controversial, isn't it?
[40:00.440 --> 40:02.440]  Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.
[40:02.440 --> 40:06.440]  And instead, what he got back was an amazing,
[40:06.440 --> 40:08.440]  and of course, this is a story up on Infowars,
[40:08.440 --> 40:11.440]  an amazing series of tweets from people
[40:11.440 --> 40:14.440]  replying, Allah Akbar, hail Allah,
[40:14.440 --> 40:17.440]  I will bomb you, racist, et cetera,
[40:17.440 --> 40:20.440]  for saying Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.
[40:20.440 --> 40:22.440]  That's the kind of political correctness
[40:22.440 --> 40:24.440]  that is destroying America,
[40:24.440 --> 40:26.440]  destroying the freedoms that we live by.
[40:26.440 --> 40:29.440]  And of course, we have another article
[40:29.440 --> 40:31.440]  that's up on Infowars.com.
[40:31.440 --> 40:33.440]  I think he's the Archbishop,
[40:33.440 --> 40:35.440]  yeah, he is the Archbishop of Canterbury.
[40:35.440 --> 40:38.440]  Justin Welby said that Islamic extremists
[40:38.440 --> 40:42.440]  are trying to eliminate Christians in the Middle East.
[40:42.440 --> 40:45.440]  And of course, it's not only the Islamic extremists.
[40:45.440 --> 40:46.440]  We need to understand, too,
[40:46.440 --> 40:49.440]  that this is something that is intricately tied
[40:49.440 --> 40:51.440]  to American foreign policy.
[40:51.440 --> 40:54.440]  It is American foreign policy to go into all of these
[40:54.440 --> 40:56.440]  Middle Eastern countries to create chaos,
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.440]  to overthrow regimes.
[40:59.440 --> 41:01.440]  And that's what we've been doing throughout the Middle East.
[41:01.440 --> 41:04.440]  We did it in Benghazi and in Libya.
[41:04.440 --> 41:06.440]  We are doing it in Syria.
[41:06.440 --> 41:09.440]  We've done it in Afghanistan, Iraq, other places.
[41:09.440 --> 41:13.440]  Everywhere we go, Christianity is eradicated.
[41:13.440 --> 41:16.440]  Places where, yes, Christians lived as a minority
[41:16.440 --> 41:18.440]  and maybe they didn't have the kind of equality
[41:18.440 --> 41:20.440]  and the kind of treatment that we have here,
[41:20.440 --> 41:23.440]  but they were still able to exist no longer.
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.440]  Not after our foreign policy, not after we go there.
[41:26.440 --> 41:28.440]  So let's keep that in mind when we look at that
[41:28.440 --> 41:32.440]  and let's understand, too, when everybody gets afraid of ISIS
[41:32.440 --> 41:34.440]  and we should be concerned about ISIS.
[41:34.440 --> 41:38.440]  But understand that it isn't this magic boogeyman
[41:38.440 --> 41:40.440]  that just appears out of nowhere,
[41:40.440 --> 41:43.440]  this energizer bunny for the war on terror.
[41:43.440 --> 41:45.440]  This is something that is being constantly fed
[41:45.440 --> 41:48.440]  by the United States and by our allies.
[41:48.440 --> 41:50.440]  And we're going to break that down in a little bit.
[41:50.440 --> 41:52.440]  But first, what did the Archbishop of Canterbury say?
[41:52.440 --> 41:55.440]  He said, Christianity is facing elimination in the Middle East
[41:55.440 --> 41:59.440]  at the hands of the Islamic State, their apocalypse.
[41:59.440 --> 42:03.440]  He said that they are igniting a trail of fear, violence, hatred,
[42:03.440 --> 42:05.440]  and determined oppression.
[42:05.440 --> 42:08.440]  ISIS is confident that these are the last days.
[42:08.440 --> 42:11.440]  ISIS is using force and indescribable cruelty.
[42:11.440 --> 42:13.440]  They seem to welcome all opposition,
[42:13.440 --> 42:16.440]  certain that the warfare that they unleash confirms
[42:16.440 --> 42:19.440]  that this is indeed the end of the world for them.
[42:19.440 --> 42:22.440]  And I thought it was interesting that in this article,
[42:22.440 --> 42:25.440]  even a chief rabbi, Ephraim Mervis,
[42:25.440 --> 42:28.440]  said that he urged all faiths to unite
[42:28.440 --> 42:31.440]  in the face of attacks on the freedom to worship.
[42:31.440 --> 42:33.440]  He said, and this is a rabbi talking,
[42:33.440 --> 42:35.440]  he said it has been reported that persecution
[42:35.440 --> 42:38.440]  of Christians persists in over 100 countries
[42:38.440 --> 42:41.440]  more than for any other religion.
[42:41.440 --> 42:44.440]  Yes, that is the state of Christianity now.
[42:44.440 --> 42:47.440]  And of course, it is only being exacerbated
[42:47.440 --> 42:49.440]  by the foreign policies of our government.
[42:49.440 --> 42:51.440]  I would say that it is by design.
[42:51.440 --> 43:18.440]  Stay with us. We're going to be right back.
[43:18.440 --> 43:21.440]  It's insulting to people of color, perpetuates the idea
[43:21.440 --> 43:24.440]  that white is naturally good and that other colors are bad.
[43:24.440 --> 43:27.440]  And we feel that that's a microaggression.
[43:27.440 --> 43:29.440]  Here's a clue, boys and girls.
[43:29.440 --> 43:35.440]  It's about the government educational establishment
[43:35.440 --> 43:38.440]  is destroying any connection to existing culture
[43:38.440 --> 43:41.440]  so that they can create a new political culture,
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.440]  one of censorship and intolerance done in the name of tolerance.
[43:45.440 --> 43:48.440]  Fight back, give the gift of knowledge,
[43:48.440 --> 43:50.440]  send your friends to info wars,
[43:50.440 --> 43:52.440]  the cure for political correctness,

[46:58.040 --> 47:16.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:16.440 --> 47:33.720]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios it's
[47:33.720 --> 47:41.800]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight your host and
[47:41.800 --> 47:45.200]  I said at the beginning of the program I think the biggest story of 2015 of course
[47:45.200 --> 47:52.040]  is that ISIS is funded and created by the Western governments by NATO, by Turkey, by
[47:52.040 --> 47:55.920]  Saudi Arabia, but don't tell anybody. Don't tell anybody. We've got a story
[47:55.920 --> 48:00.160]  that's up on InfoWars from zero hedge. Confessions of an ISIS soldier. The
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.400]  training took place in Turkey. Yeah and of course we've had video that surfaced
[48:05.400 --> 48:13.280]  from Russia showing the massive, massive convoy of oil tankers snaking through
[48:13.280 --> 48:18.120]  these roads and then going into Turkey and then going beyond Turkey. And of
[48:18.120 --> 48:21.240]  course in this article they point out in zero hedge a senior Western official
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.160]  familiar with large cash of intelligence obtained this summer from a major raid
[48:25.160 --> 48:29.280]  on an ISIS safe house told the Guardian that direct dealings between Turkish
[48:29.280 --> 48:33.880]  officials and ranking ISIS members was now undeniable. The same official
[48:33.880 --> 48:38.160]  confirmed that Turkey a long-standing member of NATO is not just supporting
[48:38.160 --> 48:42.560]  ISIS but also other jihadist groups and of course as I'm talking you're seeing
[48:42.560 --> 48:46.520]  if you're watching this you're seeing the footage that Russia took of an oil
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.320]  convoy that they blew up and of course there's an incredible amount of oil
[48:51.320 --> 48:54.760]  tankers that are running through there. We've heard many estimates of it being
[48:54.760 --> 48:59.360]  something like four million dollars a day that they are channeling through
[48:59.360 --> 49:04.720]  Turkey and then funding ISIS. Now there was also a former ISIS communications
[49:04.720 --> 49:09.320]  technician that was a story that was reported this was in Newsweek about a
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.520]  year ago and that former ISIS fighter told Newsweek at the time that Turkey
[49:13.520 --> 49:17.720]  was allowing ISIS trucks to cross the border through Turkey then back to the
[49:17.720 --> 49:23.280]  border to attack Syrian Kurds in the city of Sarikhania I think is
[49:23.280 --> 49:26.880]  way pronounced that in northern Syria in February. ISIS militancy said would
[49:26.880 --> 49:30.160]  freely travel through Turkey and a convoy of trucks just as we see the
[49:30.160 --> 49:35.000]  convoy of trucks traveling back and forth into Turkey selling oil. So you've got
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.520]  oil tankers as well as convoys of fighters that are going back and forth
[49:39.520 --> 49:44.280]  in Turkey and he said ISIS commanders told us to fear nothing at all because
[49:44.280 --> 49:49.000]  there was full cooperation with the Turks. They even talk about how they had a
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.840]  training camp set up there they said the training took place in Turkey because
[49:53.840 --> 49:57.840]  ISIS command thought that it was safer there than in Syria. He says in the media
[49:57.840 --> 50:03.120]  they wrote that we were training in an FSA military camp but in fact all 60 of
[50:03.120 --> 50:08.840]  us were members of ISIS and of course he uses the word Daesh because they keep
[50:08.840 --> 50:13.800]  changing they want to call it ISIS, ISIL, Daesh, al-Qaeda it doesn't really matter.
[50:13.800 --> 50:18.000]  These are all jihadi surrogates we've talked about this earlier this week
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.560]  recently linked documents from the CIA report from Wayne Madsen pointed out
[50:23.560 --> 50:29.440]  this has been going on for 63 years. We were using 63 years ago CIA
[50:29.440 --> 50:35.680]  documents showing how we were using radical Islamic jihadis against the
[50:35.680 --> 50:38.920]  Russians at that time that was way before the war in Afghanistan we've been
[50:38.920 --> 50:42.280]  doing that for a very long time using Chechen terrorists and of course that's
[50:42.280 --> 50:46.680]  the way we're doing it here and it's not just against Russia it is about
[50:46.680 --> 50:52.320]  creating chaos that's what this is truly about and of course now bringing them
[50:52.320 --> 50:57.840]  into the West. We have the corporate media ignores the Hirsh story on top
[50:57.840 --> 51:02.360]  brass providing intel to Syria another story that's up on infowars.com this
[51:02.360 --> 51:06.640]  is from Kurt Nemo and in it he shows a tweet from a frequent guest of ours
[51:06.640 --> 51:10.400]  Steve Pacinac he says here's the Seymour Hirsh article that everybody is
[51:10.400 --> 51:14.840]  talking about well not everybody see them the mainstream media is not telling
[51:14.840 --> 51:18.560]  anybody about what's going on in this and of course that article just to
[51:18.560 --> 51:22.400]  briefly review for those of you who don't know anything about it understand
[51:22.400 --> 51:27.800]  that in 2013 we were telling everyone that this Seren gas attack was a real
[51:27.800 --> 51:33.280]  ruse a false flag to try to try to get the United States directly involved in
[51:33.280 --> 51:38.120]  Syria to provide a justification for that there were people and the joint chiefs
[51:38.120 --> 51:41.760]  of staff and other agencies within the Pentagon and of course Seymour Hirsh
[51:41.760 --> 51:46.040]  names those people and talks about it from his sources they were telling the
[51:46.040 --> 51:50.400]  Obama administration there that they had signals intelligence satellite
[51:50.400 --> 51:56.760]  intelligence human intelligence showing that we were arming al-Qaeda but of
[51:56.760 --> 52:01.040]  course Obama didn't want to hear it he wouldn't stop his policy and it wasn't
[52:01.040 --> 52:07.080]  we all know don't we it wasn't because he didn't believe them okay it was
[52:07.080 --> 52:11.080]  because he knew what he was doing he knew what he was doing but they knew
[52:11.080 --> 52:14.360]  that he wasn't going to stop this they didn't want to see this happening so
[52:14.360 --> 52:18.560]  what was the truly amazing and of course Seymour Hirsh lays us out in a very
[52:18.560 --> 52:24.000]  detailed article we have it linked on our site you can also you'll be able to
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  find it on info wars.com we linked to the article that he put up on the
[52:28.000 --> 52:34.160]  London review of books but in that article and with his sources he points
[52:34.160 --> 52:37.280]  out that what the people who were leaders within the military at the time
[52:37.280 --> 52:43.040]  did was they gave military intelligence to Germany to Israel to Russia and said
[52:43.040 --> 52:48.480]  here's what we know maybe you guys want to do something about it that truly is
[52:48.480 --> 52:53.000]  the backdrop of what is going on now with Putin and we still see that the US is
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  not and his allies are still arming ISIS and when they intervene in the area
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.720]  what they are doing is they're attacking the enemies of ISIS the people who are
[53:02.720 --> 53:08.640]  trying to destroy ISIS we are attacking them that truly is what is going on it
[53:08.640 --> 53:14.680]  truly is a fantasy a phantom menace if you put it that way put it in Star Wars
[53:14.680 --> 53:20.520]  terms and you know when I was listening to reading articles over Christmas and
[53:20.520 --> 53:23.100]  looking at the traditional things you know we always have every year we've
[53:23.100 --> 53:27.080]  got norad but it's telling everybody we're tracking Santa Claus around the
[53:27.080 --> 53:32.280]  world and I'm looking at that and I'm thinking you know this is just like the
[53:32.280 --> 53:36.600]  fantasy stuff they're giving us with ISIS and of course we were told that you
[53:36.600 --> 53:42.160]  know norad had no idea that anything was going on with 9-11 I remember Gorvid
[53:42.160 --> 53:48.480]  all whose dad set in place the norad system said that was the thing for him
[53:48.480 --> 53:54.120]  that let him know that this truly was allowed to happen that this was a false
[53:54.120 --> 53:58.320]  flag that this was a lie of some sort he said that could not have happened
[53:58.320 --> 54:01.560]  because we're constantly monitoring things so they'll tell people that
[54:01.560 --> 54:05.160]  they're tracking Santa Claus but that they can't fly and they can't find these
[54:05.160 --> 54:08.760]  rogue airplanes that's their story that's the government story and so they
[54:08.760 --> 54:12.120]  say in this in this long article from the Daily Mail they say the North
[54:12.120 --> 54:17.320]  American Aerospace Defense Command norad which follows Santa as he leaves his top
[54:17.320 --> 54:20.760]  secret toy factory in the North Pole they say international aircraft have been
[54:20.760 --> 54:24.680]  warned to steer clear of the North Pole as Santa Claus dashes around the world
[54:24.680 --> 54:29.240]  at almost the speed of light because you know he's been known to knock down steel
[54:29.240 --> 54:33.680]  skyscrapers when he flies by them at speed you know they just collapse right
[54:33.680 --> 54:37.800]  into their own footprint maybe that's what happened at 9-11 maybe it was Santa
[54:37.800 --> 54:42.760]  Claus doing an early trial run that makes as much sense as the official story
[54:42.760 --> 54:47.600]  that we give but of course they they do that that's the way that they game us
[54:47.600 --> 54:51.920]  we've got an article here that Nico gave me earlier came out of one of the TV
[54:51.920 --> 54:57.800]  stations here in Austin and here's a headline FBI wants Austin residents to
[54:57.800 --> 55:01.960]  be on high alert whoa wow they got some intel here oh what what have they got
[55:01.960 --> 55:05.840]  they say regional FBI agents want Austinites to be on alert as part of an
[55:05.840 --> 55:09.720]  effort to get every people everyone to report suspicious behavior that could
[55:09.720 --> 55:13.480]  potentially stop a terrorist attack or an act of violence before it happens
[55:13.480 --> 55:17.080]  well there are no credible threats they're going to say against Austin but
[55:17.080 --> 55:21.720]  the FBI says there could be a threat that it doesn't know about yet so worry
[55:21.720 --> 55:26.520]  about it worry about that see they want to keep you in a constant state of fear
[55:26.520 --> 55:31.560]  so the headline of this ought to really be the FBI says worry Christmas and
[55:31.560 --> 55:35.640]  happy new fear because that is what they're trying to promote with everybody
[55:35.640 --> 55:40.240]  we look at this TSA situation we look at the fact that now they're saying they're
[55:40.240 --> 55:43.760]  not going to give you the option to opt out of going through the body scanners
[55:43.760 --> 55:47.120]  you know you've even if you're concerned about the health effects of those x-rays
[55:47.120 --> 55:50.760]  if you're concerned about your privacy in that regard they're not going to let
[55:50.760 --> 55:57.360]  you opt out of that we need to remember that going back to October 17th 2013
[55:57.360 --> 56:02.640]  this article on info wars by a Don Salazar internal TSA documents say that
[56:02.640 --> 56:07.360]  body scanners and pat downs are not for terrorists and they pointed out that the
[56:07.360 --> 56:13.380]  TSA has quietly admitted that there is no actual threat assessing a threat
[56:13.380 --> 56:18.000]  addressing basis for employing these nude body scanners the way this came out
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.600]  was the same guy that you just heard Alex Jones at the beginning of the
[56:21.600 --> 56:26.080]  program talking about how Jonathan Corbett is now suing at the TSA because
[56:26.080 --> 56:29.960]  they have changed the rules and said no we're not going to give you the option
[56:29.960 --> 56:33.640]  to opt out of these body scanners we're going to force you through the body
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.640]  scanners if you want to fly he's now suing them he's an engineer who had
[56:38.640 --> 56:44.680]  exhibited in the past the failures of these body scanners he sued the TSA and
[56:44.680 --> 56:49.000]  as part of discovery he was able to go through documents and he was able to
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.320]  uncover amazing admissions from the TSA what they did was they posted the lawsuit
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.200]  on pacer.gov where all lawsuits get put they initially put up an unredacted
[57:00.200 --> 57:04.080]  version and then they put up the redacted version and so you can see what
[57:04.080 --> 57:08.520]  they don't want us to know what they do not want us to know is that at the time
[57:08.520 --> 57:12.440]  they pointed out there was abs it was totally ineffective and in addition to
[57:12.440 --> 57:16.880]  that they said there was no threat against airports or airplanes that was
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.800]  in 2011 when they were threatening to turn Texas into a no-fly zone because
[57:21.800 --> 57:25.720]  we had legislators here saying you're not going to put your hands on our
[57:25.720 --> 57:30.520]  children and so that was their basis to push back the whole thing has been a
[57:30.520 --> 57:34.960]  lie and now they're moving out their incremental terrorism to force you
[57:34.960 --> 57:39.880]  through these body scanners that are a payback to big business backers for them
[57:39.880 --> 57:43.040]  stay with us we'll be right back

[59:56.160 --> 1:00:05.880]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[1:00:05.880 --> 1:00:12.600]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:17.720]  welcome out to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host we've got a lot
[1:00:17.720 --> 1:00:22.480]  of articles we're going to cover in this hour also want to take some calls from
[1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:26.840]  our listeners I mentioned what I thought was a top story of 2015 I'd like to
[1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:31.840]  know what you think the top story of 2015 is also maybe what you would ask one
[1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:35.480]  of the presidential candidates you know they keep them very tightly confined in
[1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:39.680]  this little ghetto of allowed issues that they talk about every election cycle
[1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:43.840]  they have a series of little issues that they'll ask the Democrats when they
[1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:47.440]  have their few debates which are virtually non-existent this time around but
[1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:51.520]  also a few little issues of the last Republicans and I think that there's
[1:00:51.520 --> 1:00:55.200]  some really core issues that are never discussed so I'd like to know what you
[1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:58.760]  think should be asked what you would ask if you were able to ask the
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:02.840]  presidential candidates I was just talking about Norad and their tracking of
[1:01:02.840 --> 1:01:06.840]  Santa Claus the fantasy involved in that and how much that was like the
[1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:13.080]  fantasies they told us about 9-11 but what was the top thing on the wishlist
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:16.800]  for people this Christmas well it was guns and we got a special report from
[1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:21.200]  John Bowne to break that down it's that time of the year again the time of the
[1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:24.400]  year when the Department of Homeland Security and the Fear Factory in
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:29.640]  Washington DC doles out things like credible threats and a tweaking of the
[1:01:29.640 --> 1:01:34.240]  terror alert system most Americans are taking it very seriously this year as
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:38.080]  President Obama and the traders occupying the nation's capital have
[1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:42.560]  doubled down on the infusion of potential jihadi terrorists flowing into the
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:47.120]  United States and while Obama and his family vacation far away from the
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:52.120]  maddening crowd gun sales are soaring once again in the United States with
[1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:55.920]  shoppers taking advantage of the holiday season to allay their fears of
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:00.400]  terrorism and potential gun control measures figures for November show that
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:05.840]  the FBI carried out some 2.2 million background checks on potential sales of
[1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:11.160]  guns the figure constitutes a 24% increase on figures recorded this time
[1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:15.320]  last year and is the seventh consecutive month to see a record number of
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:20.200]  checks as we previously noted on Black Friday a record a hundred and eighty
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:24.440]  five thousand three hundred and forty five background checks were processed by
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:29.120]  the FBI in October the FBI carried out one million nine hundred and seventy
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:33.400]  six seven hundred and fifty nine instant background checks while the figures
[1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:37.200]  don't represent a one-to-one calculation for gun sales they are
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:42.240]  considered a reliable indicator of overall gun sales sales between private
[1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:47.080]  parties are not subject to background checks FBI stats also show that almost
[1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:52.120]  20 million firearm related checks have been carried out in 2015 with one
[1:02:52.120 --> 1:02:57.200]  month still to be calculated the overall figure should surpass 2013's record of
[1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:01.880]  21 million nine thousand two hundred and seventy three checks gun sales and
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:06.000]  concealed carry permit applications in the US have continued to spike in the
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.520]  days following the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino according to
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:15.640]  gunstore owners Eric Wallace manager of adventure outdoors in Smyrna Georgia told
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:20.240]  today ever since the Paris attacks we've got a lot of customers coming in buying
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:25.400]  you know first guns buying guns to protect their homes their families and
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:30.160]  themselves like any good husband asked for the list of Christmas items that
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:34.080]  you'd like to have and one of the items was a firearm in addition to the
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:38.440]  terrorist threat President Obama has not tried to hide the fact that he intends
[1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:43.200]  to introduce gun control legislation via executive fiat there could be no doubt
[1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:48.120]  that this is driving higher gun sales last week White House communications
[1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:52.600]  director Jen Psaki told Bloomberg that within a matter of weeks not months
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:57.480]  Obama will review recommendations for executive orders provided to him at the
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:02.120]  request by the Department of Justice I believe in people's lawful right to
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:08.600]  bear arms I will not take your shot gun away I will not take your rifle away I
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:13.640]  won't take your handgun away the DOJ continues to work on options to allow
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:18.160]  Obama to skirt around Congress on the issue and effectively counter lawsuits
[1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:23.000]  that pro-2nd Amendment rights groups have prepared according to Saki Obama is
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:26.960]  planning a range of steps that can be taken as it relates to the people who
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:32.000]  have access to guns and how people gain access to guns and that he will not be
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:37.120]  satisfied unless some kind of action is taken on firearms before the end of his
[1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:42.080]  term however Rand Paul has introduced legislation intended to block any effort
[1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:46.280]  by the incumbent president to enforce gun control by executive action
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:51.080]  relegating the president's potential action to an advisory position stock up

[1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:11.960]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to God it's Alex Jones you can run on for
[1:06:11.960 --> 1:06:15.320]  long welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host and of
[1:06:15.320 --> 1:06:19.400]  course we had that excellent report in the last segment from John bound guns
[1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:24.200]  are the top of Santa's list this year talking about the massive number of
[1:06:24.200 --> 1:06:28.200]  background checks that's one way that they can tell how many new guns are
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:31.920]  being sold into retail channels and of course it is going off exponentially I
[1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:36.440]  was in a store gun store and I heard a guy on the phone talking to somebody his
[1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:40.520]  family says we better get some guns now because Obama's gonna take him away in
[1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:44.440]  the next year and it's like no I wanted to tell him that ain't gonna happen it
[1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:48.480]  didn't gonna happen just isn't gonna happen we need to understand they're
[1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:51.960]  gonna try to do that but we need to understand that it isn't going to happen
[1:06:51.960 --> 1:06:55.040]  because we're gonna fight it I mean we're not gonna just say well he can't do
[1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:58.080]  that because he will if we don't fight him there's a lot of people who will
[1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:02.880]  challenge him my biggest concern is that although we will fight over this
[1:07:02.880 --> 1:07:08.160]  particular issue we don't fight over all the other cuts to our liberty that's
[1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:11.880]  what is so dangerous we need to understand the principal and we need to
[1:07:11.880 --> 1:07:15.960]  shut down this whole idea that we're going to rule by executive order I would
[1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:19.800]  like to see some of the presidential candidates talk about that about that
[1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:23.400]  have you heard any of them talk about how they don't shouldn't have things done
[1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:27.800]  by executive order only one I can think of is Rand Paul and of course he's got
[1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:32.320]  a bill to try to stop Obama from doing that with guns but I haven't heard any
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:35.760]  other presidential candidates talk about that I think all of them Republican
[1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:41.000]  or Democrat would just love to be the next dictator in chief where they can
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.320]  essentially dictate the laws to you ignore Congress and of course will
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:48.840]  Congress do anything about it very few in Congress really want to do anything to
[1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:54.760]  block their power from being usurped by not only the executive but also by the
[1:07:54.760 --> 1:07:59.240]  bureaucracies that operate as little kingdoms as little fiefdoms expanding
[1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:04.400]  their power we've seen the FAA go out and say well beginning December 21st if
[1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:10.600]  you don't register your drone of a half pound or more we will find you twenty
[1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:14.200]  seven thousand five hundred dollars just for not registering it and we won't make
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:18.040]  that a criminal charge we'll call it a civil action so that you don't get any
[1:08:18.040 --> 1:08:21.320]  due process in court of course if they want to come after you criminally they
[1:08:21.320 --> 1:08:25.720]  say they can find you a hundred thousand dollars and put you in jail for three
[1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:30.400]  years there they would have to have a trial but to me what is it isn't there
[1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:35.720]  something in the Constitution that I recall about excessive fines excessive
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:39.600]  bail things like that due process remember all that all those quaint ideas
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:43.000]  I want to take some of your calls I want to ask what you think the top story of
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:47.200]  2015 was what you would ask the presidential candidates if you had an
[1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:52.920]  opportunity let me give you that number it's different on Sundays it's 877-789-2539
[1:08:52.920 --> 1:09:00.160]  that's 877-789-Alex so call in and tell us what you think the top stories are
[1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:03.720]  what the top question would be if you had a chance to ask one of the
[1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:08.240]  presidential candidates before we go to any more articles or your calls just
[1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:10.640]  want to let you know some of the things that we have in infowars that would
[1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:14.480]  help you to prepare for this next year any kind of eventuality we have a lot
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:19.520]  of things battery backup and a very small package that we have available the
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:24.040]  infowars premium power pack will charge all of your electronic devices has the
[1:09:24.040 --> 1:09:28.560]  power to even jump start your vehicle it's got a lot of power but it's at a
[1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:33.640]  good price it's not what you would typically see be $150 or more for that
[1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:39.040]  the infowars premium power pack is available for only $119.95 another way
[1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:42.960]  that you can power things of course is with our infowars solar base station
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:49.600]  power supply and this is something has solar panels as well as a battery that
[1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:54.520]  will be charged by those solar cells and a power inverter that will allow you to
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:10:00.600]  run AC devices off of that it provides 1500 watts of continuous power 3,000
[1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:04.000]  watts of peak power for any emergency and of course if you are familiar with
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:10.080]  these types of systems solar solar panels have come down and cost and
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:13.240]  effectiveness they've gone up in effectiveness quite a bit in the last
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:17.240]  few years the thing that really sets them apart is the battery and this one
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:22.520]  has an excellent battery it's a lithium iron phosphate battery this is it will
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:26.240]  last up to eight times longer than your typical unit the battery is really what
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:30.480]  distinguishes these units so this has your solar collectors it's got a battery
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:34.560]  and it has power inverters with a lot of different types of outputs again you can
[1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:40.200]  find that at info wars store.com that's the info wars solar base station now as
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:43.720]  we're talking about guns of course a new movie that's going to be coming up I
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:48.600]  think it's it previews on New Year's Day this next Friday is the hateful eight
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:51.480]  Kurt Russell has been going around promoting that and as he went around
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:55.800]  promoting it he keeps getting asked these questions by liberals who want to
[1:10:55.800 --> 1:11:00.200]  push gun control and they keep hammering him on this and goes look guys as you
[1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:03.840]  can see if you're watching this it's a movie that is set in the Civil War it's
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:07.520]  also pretty much a fantasy movie because it's a Quentin Tarantino movie
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:13.440]  they're always over the top in terms of violence kind of a grinder type of
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:17.840]  film and so that's what you expect and as he keeps pointing out to people like
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:21.920]  this is a work of art it's like a painting or a song don't try to extrapolate
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:26.400]  this in the real world but they won't stop so he comes back after a little bit
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:30.480]  of this and and he really pushed back and told him what he thought about gun
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:33.440]  control and he's continued to talk because they continue to push him on this
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:36.440]  was the latest thing that he said in an interview was he said this is what people
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:42.520]  need to understand he said now is not a good time to lay down your weapons how
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:45.720]  will you protect yourself and of course they're they're saying hey we've had
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:50.600]  these these shootings in San Bernardino so we all need to give up our guns it's
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:57.000]  seriously you really think that these people can't get their guns on a black
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.080]  market that they wouldn't get their guns on a black market when they are
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:04.520]  plotting to do something as heinous as a mass shooting like that cold-blooded
[1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:08.080]  murder like that you don't think you think that would stop them you think
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:11.560]  they're gonna call up and say you know what Muhammad we're gonna have to postpone
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:18.440]  the attack because they're all out of AR-15s here at the the gun store so they
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:21.040]  say they're gonna have some in a couple of months so maybe we should reschedule
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:25.520]  the attack for them they can get these guns whenever and wherever they want
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:28.520]  there's a thing called the black market and you need to understand that if you
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:32.800]  haven't figured that out by watching the war on drugs if you didn't figure it out
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:37.440]  by watching alcohol prohibition that you know when you prohibit stuff it really
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:43.120]  doesn't stop it does it it just makes more virulent forms of it available you
[1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:47.600]  want to see some really virulent forms of firearms and act gun prohibition
[1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:52.320]  they're not gonna go away what you'll find is it's going to unleash the
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:57.520]  creativity of people on the firearms and just as it has in the war on drugs
[1:12:57.520 --> 1:13:01.360]  we've got things like meth which I don't think I think is a horrible thing but I
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:07.040]  don't think that meth would have existed without the war on drugs in the same way
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:10.880]  that during alcohol prohibition we had bathtub gin that was making people go
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:14.960]  blind that's what happens when you create prohibition of course it also
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:20.680]  corrupts law enforcement it also destroys our rights it also turns us into a war
[1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:24.520]  zone all of those things happen because of the war on drugs but again going back
[1:13:24.520 --> 1:13:27.960]  Kurt Russell he says now is not a good time to lay down your weapons how will
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:30.680]  you protect yourself and as he said in a previous interview he says what are you
[1:13:30.680 --> 1:13:33.760]  gonna do outlaw everything they can use a car they can use a bomb they can
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:37.760]  attack people however whenever they wish you need to have a way to protect
[1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:41.240]  yourself he says I'm a libertarian a hardcore one and of course I have guns
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:47.840]  I shoot things with them I hunt game and of course this last week we just saw
[1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:52.040]  the Virginia Attorney General and his last name is Herring his middle initial
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:57.680]  is R I speculated that maybe the middle name the R stands for red as in red
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:03.440]  herring because what he said he was going to do was not respect the concealed
[1:14:03.440 --> 1:14:08.680]  carry permits of 25 states he's going to revoke that and I had some people when
[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:12.000]  I covered that made some good comments something that didn't think about that
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:17.200]  was done in reaction to the speech by the president of Liberty University
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:21.640]  suggesting to his college students that they needed to learn how to use guns and
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:25.240]  carry concealed and of course their students are going to be traveling to
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:28.200]  that university from a lot of different states they'll be coming in with
[1:14:28.200 --> 1:14:32.320]  concealed carry permits so that's a way to push back and attack that I think
[1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:37.720]  that's a very I think that observation is spot-on and of course the governor of
[1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:42.360]  Virginia is none other than Terry McAuliffe a guy whose soul qualification is
[1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:46.880]  being a propagandist for the Clintons and they are trying to do everything they
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:51.600]  can to shut down carrying firearms now one more article here on firearms and
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:58.040]  I'll go to your calls there is a lawsuit that is being put out by gun owners of
[1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:01.360]  America and another organization called Shooters Committee on Political
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:04.400]  Education and what they're doing is they're pushing back against this idea
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:10.640]  that people who are on watch lists secret watch lists by the government that
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:16.040]  they should have their gun rights revoked think about that for a moment and
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:20.160]  I want you to also go back and look at the statistics that the people who are
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:23.640]  pushing for this and some of the people pushing for this are Fox News Fox News
[1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:28.480]  anchors are just absolutely incredulous that somebody that's on a terror watch
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:32.120]  list could actually buy a gun well you know what according to their own figures
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:37.200]  over a period of I think it was five years 91% of the people who were on a
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:41.160]  terror watch list were able to get guns because there wasn't anything in their
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:45.480]  background you need to understand that the terror watch list is a star chamber
[1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:48.280]  watch list people are put on it they don't even know why they put on it
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:52.720]  maybe because of an anonymous tip that is not how we need to be taking people's
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:56.320]  property and their rights stay with us we'll be right back

[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:28.040]  gonna go to your calls right now we're gonna go to brad bobby matthew frank and
[1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:31.920]  many others if you want to call in what we're taking are your comments about the
[1:20:31.920 --> 1:20:37.200]  top story of 2015 or what would you ask a presidential candidate if you had a
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:42.520]  chance to ask them something let's go to brad in Louisiana brad go ahead
[1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:49.160]  greetings to you my friend I'm calling on two counts one is the new house bill
[1:20:49.160 --> 1:20:55.560]  42 69 that's been introduced and signed by a number of representatives
[1:20:55.560 --> 1:21:01.400]  Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Napolitano, California, Georgia, North Carolina and
[1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:07.360]  it's the preamble of it is a bill to regulate assault weapons to ensure that
[1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:12.400]  the right to keep and bear arms is not unlimited and for other purposes
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:19.560]  secondly I would like to ask a candidate a candidate for president of the United
[1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:27.400]  States what is the logic and rationale whereby any country on this globe who is
[1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:34.720]  faced with the possible intrusion of terrorists is shipped firearms with the
[1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:41.160]  little regard to expense and trained at taxpayer expense when we as you the
[1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:46.160]  United States are also being intimidated by terrorists yet they want to
[1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:52.560]  take our guns away that we not be able to protect ourselves I'm sorry Dave but
[1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:58.280]  I just don't see the logic in it can oh yeah absolutely yeah Brad what you're
[1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:00.600]  talking about what you're saying essentially is that they want all kinds
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:04.520]  of background checks and limitations on us but they don't do any background
[1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:07.360]  checks on these people they're sending weapons to they don't want to do any
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:10.120]  background checks on the people they want to bring into this country from
[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:14.640]  areas that are at war with us that's the amazing thing about this and that bill
[1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:18.880]  that you're talking about is saying that the right to keep him bear arms to
[1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:21.760]  ensure that that would not be unlimited that would be a direct
[1:22:21.760 --> 1:22:26.640]  contradiction to the Second Amendment I mean the Second Amendment is saying
[1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:33.080]  proposed to the judiciary committee before it moves on but this is an actual
[1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:39.600]  it's called the gun legislation act of 2015 and I just finished reading it I've
[1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:45.080]  got a copy of it off of the website for the Congress well of course the way
[1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:48.680]  they have traditionally come after guns and it's the way I think they're going
[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:53.800]  to continue to do it is by a an incremental infringement that's what
[1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:57.160]  the founders knew they knew that it wasn't ever going to come a time when a
[1:22:57.160 --> 1:23:00.640]  government's going to come to a well-armed citizenry and say turn over
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:06.560]  your guns no they will do it by gradual incremental infringement that's why the
[1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:10.120]  Second Amendment says shall not be infringed they're going to come after you
[1:23:10.120 --> 1:23:14.480]  taking it away around the edges come after you by saying that it's not rights
[1:23:14.480 --> 1:23:18.160]  it's privileges that we grant and now we're going to set up the terms of those
[1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:22.400]  privileges that we grant to you there will be a lot of strong legal challenges
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:26.280]  to that and we just have to say that when it push comes to shove people will
[1:23:26.280 --> 1:23:30.680]  just not comply if the political system is so corrupt that they're going to
[1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:35.920]  allow the constitutional amendments to be taken down without an amendment
[1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:40.600]  process then we basically don't have a government anymore and I want to just
[1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:45.680]  add to what I was talking about in terms of the lawsuit that is being filed by
[1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:48.840]  gun owners of America and others this is what they had to say they said
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:54.360]  permanent deprivation of a fundamental civil right cannot and should not occur
[1:23:54.360 --> 1:24:00.480]  because something as small as an alleged anonymous tip an alleged anonymous tip
[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:05.800]  placed by an individual in a secret database managed by the Attorney General
[1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:10.640]  the FBI and or the TSE to which the individual has no right of access no
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:13.600]  method of recourse understand the basis of this when they say they're going to
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:18.440]  take away people's rights on the basis of you being put on some government list
[1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:22.680]  this is nothing other than a McCarthyism of the left you want to talk about
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:26.640]  secret lists you want to talk about black lists you want to talk about lists
[1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:30.560]  where you don't know that you're on them think about how this contradicts every
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:33.240]  aspect of the Sixth Amendment Sixth Amendment says you're gonna have a
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:36.840]  speedy and a public trial you're gonna be confronted with your accusers you're
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:40.200]  gonna be informed of the nature of the accusations you're gonna have a chance to
[1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:43.520]  confront those people who are accusing you they're not going to be anonymous
[1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:48.800]  people who supposedly called into some agency in secret and then they put you
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:52.720]  on a secret database that you're not allowed to know of no they're going you
[1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:56.880]  also going to have the capability to call witnesses to back up your case even
[1:24:56.880 --> 1:25:02.080]  an attorney a counsel for your defense all of those things are guaranteed in the
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:06.400]  Constitution they're throwing away each and every one of those procedures in
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:09.880]  order to come after the guns and I would say to the liberals who are so
[1:25:09.880 --> 1:25:14.600]  afraid of guns that you need to be more afraid of a government that will throw
[1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:19.560]  out every aspect of due process that has protected your rights over the centuries
[1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:22.840]  that's what you need to be afraid of that's the real threat to you a
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:26.680]  government that would destroy everything about due process and that's what
[1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:30.520]  they're doing when they call on the government to take people's rights
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:34.920]  because they are on some secret list that they've never they don't know why
[1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:38.040]  they're on it they have no chance to contest the fact that they're on it they
[1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:41.920]  have absolutely no due process thank you Brad let's move on to Bobby and
[1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:48.280]  Pennsylvania Bobby go ahead hey David Knight honor talk to you thank you for
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:55.600]  gone I guess my I don't have a specific story for 2015 I guess the the general
[1:25:55.600 --> 1:26:03.400]  part would just be how in our face it is on the news with the political
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:08.880]  correctness I even got sucked into watching the episode of Grey's
[1:26:08.880 --> 1:26:15.520]  anatomy because of my girlfriend and at the very end they threw in the pitch of
[1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:21.840]  white privilege yeah had to throw it in there and that's a that's a huge show
[1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:29.960]  that and and I guess my second part of that is just how unaware everyone seems
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:37.440]  to be about how it's all connected you know I I listened to you guys and I
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:41.920]  hear you know the stories I see it and it just clicks it makes sense and I say
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:45.600]  oh my god what are we gonna do well I tell you Bobby I think where people
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:48.640]  don't realize where this is coming from and it's really coming from not only the
[1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:53.520]  media the media is part of it but it is really really hammered into the kids in
[1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:58.920]  the government schools government schools have always been a tool of social
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:02.440]  engineering Plato talked about it and Plato's Republic he wanted to get rid of
[1:27:02.440 --> 1:27:07.040]  the family and he wanted the children to not even know who their parents were so
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:11.680]  what he did was he promoted a very hedonistic lifestyle with no marriage
[1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:15.640]  open sex going back and forth so they wouldn't know who their parents were so
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:19.880]  they would be raised by the government and every tyrant since the time of
[1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:24.720]  Plato and probably even before then he he said what everybody knew but since
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:27.800]  that time everybody has said and you've heard it many times give me a child at
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:31.600]  the age of fill in the blank and give them to me for a few years at a very
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:38.320]  young age and they will be mine for life that is why a taxpayer compulsory
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:43.440]  educational system was a plank of the Communist Party that is the way you
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:49.080]  engineer the next generation and that is something that has been going on that
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:54.080]  is the purpose of schools it's not to give kids the tools of learning it's not
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:27:57.680]  to make them independent thinkers no that was what a liberal education was
[1:27:57.680 --> 1:28:01.640]  that was what the goal of a liberal education was no the goal of a government
[1:28:01.640 --> 1:28:06.440]  education is to make you follow the prescriptions that they 30 on whether
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:11.880]  that is the myth of global warming or whether that is white privilege or
[1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:15.200]  whatever that is what they are pushing they're using it as social engineering
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:19.400]  that's why Common Core looks so idiotic they're deliberately dumbing down
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:23.600]  people as Charlotte Isherby and Phyllis Schlafly pointed out in their book 30
[1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:28.720]  years ago it's a policy of deliberate dumbing down it is a policy of control
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:32.200]  by the government and that's where this is all coming from stay with us we've
[1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:34.400]  got to go to break we're gonna come back with more of your calls thank you so
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:38.080]  much for Bobby and Pennsylvania we're gonna come back with Matthew and Frank
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:43.080]  Charles and Michelle and many others we'll be right back
[1:28:56.480 --> 1:29:01.920]  GOP presidential hopeful ran Paul as introduced legislation intended to block
[1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:06.400]  any effort by the incumbent president to enforce gun control by executive action
[1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:10.800]  Paul's legislation named the separation of powers restoration and Second
[1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:14.640]  Amendment Protection Act would render any action on gun legislation by the
[1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:19.640]  president which circumvents Congress as advisory only in nature Paul's bill would
[1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:24.000]  apply to any executive action on gun control that either infringes upon
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:28.040]  congressional authority or potentially violates the second amendment the bill
[1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:32.320]  then mandates that once an executive action has been classified as advisory
[1:29:32.320 --> 1:29:36.800]  only it would require Congress to pass it in order for it to take effect the bill
[1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:41.160]  also outlines that it is within their power for a state official member of
[1:29:41.160 --> 1:29:44.960]  Congress or a person affected by an executive action on gun control to
[1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:49.120]  launch a civil lawsuit the legislation will be fast tracked through the Senate
[1:29:49.120 --> 1:29:53.200]  and is expected to be made priority after the Christmas recess you can find

[1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:44.440]  on what would be the top story of 2015 that you think or what would you ask a
[1:33:44.440 --> 1:33:48.440]  presidential candidate if you had a chance to ask them a question before I
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:51.480]  go back to the calls I just want to point out a couple of articles about
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:56.800]  what's called self-driving cars of course they're actually robot cars that
[1:33:56.800 --> 1:34:00.280]  are controlled by the government that's where this is really going folks I have
[1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:05.240]  a self-driving car right now I drive myself that's what's meant by an auto
[1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:11.480]  mobile that means self-moving that means I have freedom to move around this
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:16.080]  country that was the great celebration of the mid 20th century remember see the
[1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:20.920]  USA in a Chevrolet I'm old enough to remember that jingle that was what they
[1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:24.320]  were selling people the freedom of movement to move around I remember going
[1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:29.200]  to a local city council meeting in Raleigh and at the time this is before
[1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:33.360]  the Soviet Union fell we had a a councilwoman who had gone gone to Moscow
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:39.480]  and she was just rhapsodic about how you could go anywhere in Moscow and pay a
[1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:42.760]  nickel for public transportation we needed that type of thing in the little
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:47.400]  town of Raleigh North Carolina and it's like well you know what lady it didn't
[1:34:47.400 --> 1:34:51.120]  cost them a nickel to move around it cost them all of their freedom because
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:55.000]  when you have the government controlling transportation when you have the
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:59.160]  government controlling private property and wealth you've lost everything but
[1:34:59.160 --> 1:35:04.880]  that's her idea of Nirvana okay that was what the government socialists always
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:08.520]  want they want to control everything in your life they want to control your
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:12.000]  transportation your movement and now they think they've got it with these
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:16.440]  self-driving cars now interestingly enough the California DMV is not going
[1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:21.800]  to be as liberal with driving permits in California and there's maybe a good
[1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:25.960]  reason for that these cars have had an accident rate that is five times that of
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:30.520]  conventional cars now Google will tell you that it's not their fault that it is
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:35.040]  always the fault of the human drivers not saying that it's the fault of their
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:39.600]  human programmers but of course if you have an accident rate that is five times
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:44.080]  rate of everybody else because people are running into you from behind I mean
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:47.560]  that's it tells people that you're doing something that is stupid
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:51.760]  unpredictable and that's what these cars are doing they point out that they're
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:55.720]  going to mandate that an autonomous vehicle be operated by licensed driver
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:59.320]  who could take over if necessary the driver would also be on the hook for
[1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:04.160]  any traffic violations well Google said they were gravely disappointed in that
[1:36:04.160 --> 1:36:07.560]  because that kind of puts a little crimp and where they want to go but of
[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:13.960]  course I've got this other article from a market watch and they're saying Henry
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:18.520]  Ford was a smart guy but he never did the math when he decided to put every
[1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:21.720]  American household on wheels it's a horrible thing they have this
[1:36:21.720 --> 1:36:26.440]  Malthusian vision that is a horrible thing that we all have cars they say
[1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:30.440]  we it's not just a lot of cars that we have it's an ocean of cars it's an
[1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:35.000]  inundation and yet policy makers and common folk alike have been powerless
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:41.800]  against the siren song of the automobile really really only in your little ivory
[1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:47.960]  tower of the media and the socialist government is that really considered to
[1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:52.840]  be a problem see we like the fact here here's I like the fact that I can move
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:56.240]  around that I don't have to inform the government as to where I'm going if you
[1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:59.720]  look at that article you can see their picture of the future where they have
[1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:02.880]  self-driving cars and you got the family sitting there they're all turned around
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:06.160]  nobody's driving they're playing a little board game because that's what you
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:09.640]  would do in the 50s you didn't have Facebook to hang out on is that really
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:13.560]  that valuable that we're going to give up our freedom so that we can spend more
[1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:17.920]  time on Facebook when we're in the cars when we're commuting I talked about
[1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:23.360]  Alex Lexus to Tocqueville and the fact that he came to America in 1835 he
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:27.680]  published democracy in America one of the things that he talked about was how
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:32.920]  slavery comes to us and listen to this this is almost 200 years ago but it
[1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:37.560]  really does apply especially when we talk about private car ownership as they
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:41.800]  talk about in this article on the road to becoming a rarity he says what good
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:46.440]  does it do me after all if an ever watchful authority keeps an eye out to
[1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:51.000]  ensure that my pleasures will be tranquil and races ahead of me to ward off all
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:54.480]  danger sparing me the need to even think about such things think about this in
[1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:59.360]  the context of this major infringement on your freedoms okay if that authority
[1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:05.320]  even as it removes the smallest thorns from my path is also an absolute master
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:10.840]  of my liberty and my life that is the Faustian bargain they're asking you to
[1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:15.760]  to do when you give up your freedom of movement if it monopolizes vitality and
[1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:19.280]  existence to such a degree that when it languishes everything around it must
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:23.160]  also languish when it sleeps everything must also sleep and when it dies
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:29.560]  everything must also perish that's the problem with consolidating all power to
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:34.160]  a few people in the central government that are going to control every aspect
[1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:37.280]  of your movement let's go back to your calls let's go to Charles and Georgia
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:43.080]  Charles go ahead are you doing mr. David it's good to speak with you again thank
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:49.480]  you for what I would what I would say to the president or to any anybody
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:52.920]  running for office I wouldn't say anything to because they should already
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:56.400]  know what the Constitution says they know what the founding fathers laid out to
[1:38:56.400 --> 1:39:03.120]  us and it's up to we the people to kick them out of office if they're not doing
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:06.720]  what the founding fathers instructed that they should be doing it should be
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:11.960]  mass riot they should be not riots but a protest all over America protest
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:16.400]  everybody should be out it should be massive protest movement about the
[1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:20.320]  preservation of the liberty for all of the people let me just read two quick
[1:39:20.320 --> 1:39:26.120]  quotes from Thomas Jefferson one was where he said quote a nation of well
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:33.160]  informed men who have been taught to know and tries the right which God has
[1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:39.600]  given them cannot be enslaved number two he said educate and inform the whole
[1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:44.920]  mass of the people they are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our
[1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:50.880]  liberty so it's up to us the people to prefer to preserve our liberty not
[1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:54.560]  government or not anybody running for office it's up to we the people they
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:58.000]  don't do with the founding fathers laid out to them we kick them out of plain
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:02.200]  itself I agree I agree let me ask you Charles what do you think about jury
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:10.040]  nullification well we should we should like I said again we should still go
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:14.720]  by the Constitution I mean everybody that is as far as the whole jury system
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:18.800]  goes we should all just just obey the Constitution everybody just obey the
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:22.640]  Constitution and just do with the founding fathers laid out to us again I
[1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:39.400]  agree with the whole gay marriage thing I think I think I think yeah let me
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:43.360]  tell you Charles you had a great quote there from Thomas Jefferson saying what
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:47.960]  is essential for us to not become slaves is to know what our rights are and I
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:52.720]  think it's very very important for us to know the purpose of not to not to know
[1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:57.160]  not only that we have a right to be confronted with the charges against us
[1:40:57.160 --> 1:41:00.080]  so that we don't have things taken away from us by being put on some super
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:04.440]  secret list and some star chamber proceedings accusations done
[1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:08.040]  anonymously no we need to stand up for that and we need to also understand the
[1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:12.480]  value the value of a jury and in order to do that we need to understand that
[1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:19.760]  juries can refuse to convict people even if they are guilty of the law being
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:24.240]  broken if that law is unjust if the penalties that come with breaking that
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:27.760]  law are out of bounds that's something I think that is very important I have a
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:33.480]  story here on my desk about a guy who held off the medical workers because
[1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:35.720]  they said they were going to turn off life support for his son who was in a
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:40.440]  coma coma rather sorry comma in a coma that was a year ago now they're
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:44.440]  celebrating Christmas now what happened in the interim was he believed that his
[1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:48.700]  son was not brain dead he saw signs of life and sounds very much like the
[1:41:48.700 --> 1:41:53.000]  Terry Shavo situation but he went in he had an arm standoff and just as a SWAT
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  team was getting there his son squeezed his hand the SWAT team came in they
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.440]  could see that he was making eye contact then they gave him a medical
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:05.440]  treatment and he survived the father however was sentenced to 10 months in
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:08.640]  prison now here's where jury nullification comes in with jury
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:13.080]  nullification would say this guy did not harm anybody he was protecting his
[1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:16.720]  son from doctor I mean the doctors are the ones I think who should have gone to
[1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:21.240]  jail for attempted murder or at least sued for malpractice nevertheless they
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:25.640]  sent him to jail for 10 months if I was on a jury I would refuse to send that
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:30.160]  man to jail yes he broke the law and his son said well a law was broken it was
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:34.320]  done for all the right reasons you have to look at the purpose of what was going
[1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:38.200]  on you have to look at the penalties involved and as a juror you have not on
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:41.840]  the right but the duty to shut that down that could be done at the local the
[1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:45.520]  state or the federal level when authority is abused stay with us we'll be

[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:06.120]  taking my call I think the biggest news story in of the year besides the one
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:13.840]  with Donald Trump coming on the air has got to be the one with when Matt
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:18.480]  George showed up oh yeah that was huge yeah absolutely absolutely that was that
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:22.920]  was a big thing because and it's very important because you know nobody is
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:27.880]  bigger in news than that George so when he shows up to your operation to lend you
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.240]  some support and to talk about his concerns about freedom of speech and
[1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:36.720]  the kind of rules and regulations that are being planned both in Europe as well
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:40.960]  as in America to cut down the freedom of the internet that was a huge story and
[1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:44.000]  Matt Drudge wanted to get that information out to everybody it's very
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:47.640]  very important that we understand where the attack is going to be coming for the
[1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:51.440]  next year I agree thank you so much a Brian let's go to David in California I
[1:49:51.440 --> 1:49:53.840]  want to try to run through these quickly to get everybody a chance go ahead
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:50:04.920]  David yeah you know August 1st 212 by the hero Doug Malar a lifetime training
[1:50:04.920 --> 1:50:10.240]  order from Michael Aquino you know who Michael Aquino yeah yeah he was a
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:14.440]  Satanist who was very high up in the NSA and basically was accused of
[1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:18.080]  pedophilia and some other things but got a pass because he's very well connected
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:22.480]  yeah I know exactly who he is yeah well I've got the phone number of this guy
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:27.880]  Doug Malar he was an excellent interview I made an excellent one David because
[1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:34.480]  Judge Don Solvon allowed him to expose Michael Aquino in court show but a dirt
[1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:39.800]  that Michael that we murdered all those children and yet didn't have him arrested
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:48.000]  he had to pay 365 dollars to the court this training order did you hear that
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:52.400]  I just kind of breaking up I didn't hear all of that but yeah I'm familiar with a
[1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:58.000]  the situation with Michael Aquino to some degree and a very amazing character
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  and of course it does show a lot of the dark levels of what's going on in our
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:07.400]  government and it's not any surprise to see the kind of criminality that we have
[1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:12.240]  our secret dark side of the government is engaged in we have individuals who are
[1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:17.480]  openly talking about you know setting up their satanic rituals and our cues the
[1:51:17.480 --> 1:51:21.440]  types of things that we saw alleged of that it's very very suspicious let's go
[1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:27.960]  to I agree let's go to Matthew in Oregon Matthew go ahead
[1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:34.280]  taking my call I've come across a number of Trump supporters that make the claim
[1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:38.280]  well he's made his own money he's not going to be under the influence of you
[1:51:38.280 --> 1:51:43.000]  know the corporate interest but if I'm not wrong he's declared bankruptcy a
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:47.280]  number of times in his career so plenty of people have gotten screwed on his way
[1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:53.640]  to amassing wealth and secondly he's admitted to buying influence among all
[1:51:53.640 --> 1:51:57.720]  the people in Washington so how can we trust it that this guy has an out-of-the-
[1:51:57.720 --> 1:52:02.520]  way of integrity or any character whatsoever he hasn't said what his
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:07.200]  agenda is you know throwing a bunch of fastballs out there that you know it's
[1:52:07.200 --> 1:52:10.960]  easy to knock into the upper deck with the rest of the criminals in their
[1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:16.720]  actions but what is the guy's agenda other than slick talk yeah I agree with
[1:52:16.720 --> 1:52:19.320]  what you're saying in terms of the bankruptcies and that sort of thing
[1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:22.880]  course he would say and has said that those are not his personal bankruptcies
[1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:26.080]  those were companies that he had a tangential involvement and I understand
[1:52:26.080 --> 1:52:30.560]  the veil of corporations and limited liabilities with that but it does I
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:34.400]  think bring up an interesting issue of integrity and of course one of the
[1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:36.960]  things that has concerned me from very beginning and I talked about it from the
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:42.160]  very beginning is his support of the use of imminent domain for private
[1:52:42.160 --> 1:52:48.160]  individuals like him to take your property not just for public use but
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:51.720]  for an individual private use and of course he supports that he supports the
[1:52:51.720 --> 1:52:55.760]  Kellow decision that the Supreme Court had I think that is very concerning
[1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:59.720]  course where his support has come from and I think the important things that
[1:52:59.720 --> 1:53:03.600]  he's brought to the race have been to talk about issues that the other
[1:53:03.600 --> 1:53:06.920]  presidential candidates won't talk about and to talk about them in a way that
[1:53:06.920 --> 1:53:11.760]  defies political correctness I don't think we can underestimate how important
[1:53:11.760 --> 1:53:16.720]  it is for us to push back against political correctness that is a very
[1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:25.160]  very subtle but insidious way to to censor people to shut up any
[1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:28.800]  kind of free speech in the name of tolerance and it is very intolerant and
[1:53:28.800 --> 1:53:35.160]  so it is great to see somebody who is going to in a very hand-fisted way in
[1:53:35.160 --> 1:53:38.800]  many cases but just to bluntly say hey you're not going to intimidate me you're
[1:53:38.800 --> 1:53:42.360]  not going to shame me with this I mean when Hillary Clinton is bringing in
[1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:46.680]  Bill Clinton he comes out and he says well you know he has a penchant for
[1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:50.280]  sexism I mean that is the most understated thing I've seen Donald Trump
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:56.120]  say that the sexual predator Bill Clinton has a penchant for sexism but
[1:53:56.120 --> 1:53:59.920]  of course everybody understands that what's behind that is the fact that
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:04.560]  Bill Clinton is somebody who's been a sexual predator of women and when
[1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:09.440]  Hillary Clinton wants to run as the Joan of Arc representing feminism that's
[1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:13.080]  really gonna kind of blow back against her so I think it's very important that
[1:54:13.080 --> 1:54:17.320]  we have this discussion about how our country is being remade in terms of open
[1:54:17.320 --> 1:54:21.480]  borders what's behind that I would like to see more of an understanding that
[1:54:21.480 --> 1:54:26.760]  that is largely happening because people are being brought in by policies of
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:31.960]  entitlements by policies of the drug war that's what's really pulling people in
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:37.920]  just as we try to understand that we're not going to have any control over the
[1:54:37.920 --> 1:54:41.560]  exponential growth and spending that's happening with presidential elections as
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:45.200]  long as we have the kind of money and power in Washington it's gonna suck
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:49.360]  criminals into that system well as long as we have the kind of policies of
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:52.520]  entitlement and the drug war that we have we're gonna have people coming
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:56.600]  through that wall regardless of any kind of wall that we put there so yeah I
[1:54:56.600 --> 1:55:00.840]  agree I think we need to look at this and I want to see where these candidates
[1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:04.400]  stand on issues of liberty that's what I would really like to know where they are
[1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:11.440]  let's go to Frank in North Carolina Frank yeah I'd like to ask the candidates
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:15.960]  if they believe that white genocide is legitimate concern of Europeans and
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:19.920]  people of European descent and do we have a right to work in the interest and
[1:55:19.920 --> 1:55:25.160]  preservation of our people and the way every other group is applauded for doing
[1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:30.800]  also I heard a review on NPR the other morning early in the morning the
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:34.160]  about the it was a review of the new Quentin Tarantino movie I forget the
[1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:39.800]  name of it but it's primary focus seems to be pushing the liberal white guilt
[1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:44.240]  agenda really American people would that be hateful eight was that the one that
[1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:50.440]  Kurt Russell was in okay it's all about pushing the liberal white guilt
[1:55:50.440 --> 1:55:54.000]  agenda white people are evil and all of that so I think that pretty much
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:57.960]  overwrites any concerns of you know the establishment will have on that and I
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:03.240]  think in contemporary times I I think if there's any privilege in America I
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:07.320]  think the concern should be over Jewish privilege because they're the ones that
[1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:11.160]  have all the power most of the power when you're when you're talking about I
[1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:14.400]  hadn't heard that about about that particular movie I know that the new
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:18.360]  Star Wars at JJ Abrams I heard an interview after I'd seen it we talked
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:22.840]  about how it was absolutely ridiculous how they were pushing this little girl
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:27.320]  as a superhero and to the extent that they pushed her in this movie and of
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:31.240]  course I heard the interview with JJ Abrams and he was very consciously doing
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:35.280]  that he was very consciously turning what is a guy's film into a feminist
[1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:39.800]  statement and I saw an article that was linked by drudge and it was a feminist
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:44.560]  saying you know what it's okay to have guy movies just like it's okay to have
[1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:48.880]  girl movies we can have both of these types of things we don't have to rub
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:52.400]  people's nose in it all the time but of course as we pointed out it coincides
[1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:56.720]  with the movement that they want to establish women in combat this is an
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:00.480]  agenda that the Pentagon wants to have but at the broader perspective here is
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:04.960]  to push the idea that women should be in charge of everything and when you talk
[1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:08.200]  about the fact that they constantly talk about white privilege but they don't
[1:57:08.200 --> 1:57:12.480]  talk about white genocide of course so I agree with you that that that white
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:16.320]  people Christians males they're the only ones who can't be proud of what they
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:20.360]  are of course they have to have their noses rubbed into the dirt well I'm sorry
[1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:24.840]  I can't get to the rest of the callers and where we're truly did get the the
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:28.320]  phone lines backed up but that's it for today we are out of time join us
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:33.520]  tomorrow Alex Jones will be back for the Alex Jones radio show at 11 central 12
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:55.000]  eastern tomorrow morning
