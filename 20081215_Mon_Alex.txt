[00:00:14.126 --> 00:00:18.227]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:57.714 --> 00:01:06.140]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.

[00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:05.780]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand the net.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:14.065]  The cross was a solution, but he rose again.
[00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:17.988]  Wise men follow him, but he rose again.
[00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:20.189]  Wise men follow
[00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:42.749]  What a bunch of heroes who renegade your mind
[00:04:57.867 --> 00:04:59.569]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.310]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.993]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:05:03.993 --> 00:05:09.118]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:05:09.118 --> 00:05:12.321]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:05:59.756 --> 00:06:02.198]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:02.198 --> 00:06:04.499]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.060]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.761]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:10.583]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:15.807]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, or even the CIA?
[00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:23.856]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:32.590]  An inside job?
[00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.011]  How dare you?
[00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:40.113]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:40.113 --> 00:06:42.995]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.

[00:07:53.789 --> 00:08:05.893]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:05.893 --> 00:08:08.854]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:15.970]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.035]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.318 --> 00:08:37.768]  From Wikipedia, General Hamid Gould served as Director General of Pakistan's Inner Service Intelligence, ISI, during 87-89, mainly in the time when Benazir Bhutto was Prime Minister of Pakistan.
[00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:43.472]  He was instrumental in the anti-Soviet support of the Mujahideen in the Afghan War, 79-89, a pivotal time during the Cold War.
[00:08:46.173 --> 00:08:47.413]  And it goes on.
[00:08:47.413 --> 00:08:48.954]  And we have him online with us.
[00:08:48.954 --> 00:08:53.835]  We, of course, yesterday played the CNN TV interview he did that was heavily edited.
[00:08:53.835 --> 00:08:56.475]  This is live and is not edited.
[00:08:56.475 --> 00:08:58.956]  Going back to him in Pakistan, we've tried three different lines.
[00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:00.556]  This is the best one we have.
[00:09:00.556 --> 00:09:01.377]  We apologize.
[00:09:01.377 --> 00:09:02.937]  Our audio is not loud to him.
[00:09:02.937 --> 00:09:04.537]  It's not very audible.
[00:09:04.537 --> 00:09:07.578]  And obviously his audio back to us is very, very broken up.
[00:09:08.058 --> 00:09:11.660]  But we nevertheless have him joining us, and we're very thankful.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:27.928]  Sir, continuing on the CNN program, at least what they edited you to say, you talked about 9-11, the evidence being that 9-11 was an inside job, and the attacks in Bombay, now Mumbai, a few weeks ago, that the evidence was it was an inside job.
[00:09:27.928 --> 00:09:35.752]  Can you go over the evidence that you believe that these are false flag events, sir, and why these false flag events are being staged?
[00:09:37.065 --> 00:09:37.953]  Are you talking about 9-11?
[00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:38.175]  Yes, sir.
[00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:42.088]  Well, I have my own reasons.
[00:09:42.088 --> 00:09:45.570]  You know, Rod Norland was the senior reporter here.
[00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.892]  I think he was based in Islamabad at that time.
[00:09:48.892 --> 00:09:52.534]  And he came to me immediately after 9-11.
[00:09:52.534 --> 00:10:00.338]  And his version that I put out, it was given to the Newsweek and unfortunately it was blocked.
[00:10:00.338 --> 00:10:05.001]  But it appeared on the internet, on the website of the Newsweek.
[00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:07.402]  And you can see it, I think it is dated 16th or 17th.
[00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:09.503]  We're good.
[00:10:39.284 --> 00:10:54.056]  Secondly, the Air Traffic Control, when they saw that four aircraft were changing direction, going from East Coast to West Coast where they were headed, they started traveling in different directions.
[00:10:54.056 --> 00:11:02.763]  And it is quite amazing that for a very long period of time, the Air Traffic Control did not report this, nor did the U.S.
[00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:05.566]  Air Force act in time.
[00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:08.108]  If one were to calculate,
[00:11:08.695 --> 00:11:25.943]  From the first flight, when it took off from Logan, till the first aircraft, and the solitary aircraft that took off, was an F-16, which took off from Langley, which is CIA's headquarters, instead of one of the operational bases.
[00:11:25.943 --> 00:11:28.804]  So many of them are available in that area.
[00:11:28.804 --> 00:11:36.968]  And then a single aircraft never takes off, because we have been told that whenever the aircraft scramble, they scramble in twos.
[00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:40.992]  And the time that it took was enormous.
[00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:43.573]  It was 112 minutes.
[00:11:43.573 --> 00:11:48.434]  So 112 minutes is a very long time in which to act.
[00:11:48.434 --> 00:11:49.214]  Was the U.S.
[00:11:49.214 --> 00:11:50.614]  Air Force sleeping?
[00:11:50.614 --> 00:11:52.975]  And if it was sleeping, which heads were rolled?
[00:11:52.975 --> 00:11:57.436]  Second, it was a huge intelligence failure.
[00:11:57.436 --> 00:11:59.197]  And no heads have been rolled.
[00:11:59.197 --> 00:12:01.397]  Nobody has been taken to task.
[00:12:01.397 --> 00:12:03.938]  Not a single person has resigned for this.
[00:12:05.194 --> 00:12:14.200]  Thirdly, the air traffic control should have been rehashed, they should have been turned inside out, but nothing of the sort happened.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:27.429]  And finally, how come this is a coincidence that four transponders did not work, and it is not possible, the direction is changed, and it is not noted.
[00:12:27.429 --> 00:12:29.490]  Secondly, the US Air Force
[00:12:30.972 --> 00:12:39.597]  Uh, has the ability, because in the past, whenever a plane has been hijacked, the record is that within seven minutes, the U.S.
[00:12:39.597 --> 00:12:43.459]  aircraft has been on the wing of the hijacked aircraft.
[00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:47.021]  In this case, it did not happen.
[00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:48.002]  The U.S.
[00:12:48.002 --> 00:12:59.749]  alert system is so high, and it is so sophisticated, that if a missile was to take off from Moscow, and was to head towards New York, it takes about 18 minutes.
[00:13:01.391 --> 00:13:02.152]  And the U.S.
[00:13:02.152 --> 00:13:08.859]  Air Force and the missile system is supposed to intercept it within nine minutes.
[00:13:08.859 --> 00:13:14.705]  That means on the Atlantic or on the Pacific, it must stop that missile from coming in.
[00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:19.971]  The system is in place, but it did not work, and nobody tried to question this.
[00:13:20.942 --> 00:13:26.066]  Lastly, no inquiry has so far been held formally into the incident.
[00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:28.528]  And the whole world has been turned upside down.
[00:13:28.528 --> 00:13:30.929]  So many people have been killed.
[00:13:30.929 --> 00:13:34.112]  American economy is going into a meltdown.
[00:13:34.112 --> 00:13:36.934]  And everything has gone wrong with the world.
[00:13:36.934 --> 00:13:40.316]  And yet, no formal inquiry has been ordered by the U.S.
[00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:41.317]  government.
[00:13:41.317 --> 00:13:42.938]  So I really don't know.
[00:13:42.938 --> 00:13:45.260]  There are so many questions which hang in the balance.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:56.784]  And then to top it all, they say that Ata Muhammad, who took training on a light aircraft in Miami for six months, he could have maneuvered a Jumbo 757
[00:14:01.255 --> 00:14:13.228]  Uh, from a height where it was traveling, uh, the height was 9,000 and it came within seconds to a height of 1,000 and then went straight into its target.
[00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:20.256]  Now, this is not possible for a person who has been trained on a light aircraft to be able to do this.
[00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:22.899]  There's no mention of the second aircraft.
[00:14:23.499 --> 00:14:26.762]  So there are a number of things which remain unanswered.
[00:14:26.762 --> 00:14:34.749]  Whenever the journalists come and visit me here and I ask them these questions, that why haven't you taken the answers about this?
[00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:40.895]  They say that patriotic act comes in the way and we are not supposed to ask such questions.
[00:14:41.395 --> 00:14:49.257]  General, we are talking to General Hamid Gul, the former head of Pakistani ISI during the key period fighting the Russians.
[00:14:49.257 --> 00:15:02.500]  He was also, before he was the head of ISI, one of the chiefs, according to our media, running operations against the Russians, and of course working with the United States closely, as well as the Saudi Arabians and the British.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.821]  And if that's incorrect, correct me.
[00:15:03.821 --> 00:15:05.061]  General Gul,
[00:15:06.182 --> 00:15:07.142]  What are the motives?
[00:15:07.142 --> 00:15:10.765]  We have PNAC with Dick Cheney saying they need a Pearl Harbor event.
[00:15:10.765 --> 00:15:12.467]  We have 44,000 U.S.
[00:15:12.467 --> 00:15:17.091]  troops massing in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the days before 9-11.
[00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:24.737]  We have Bush on September 10th, Newsweek reported, ordering the launch of attacks the next week.
[00:15:24.737 --> 00:15:30.061]  We have, of course, the buildings being blown up with explosives and all of the witnesses to that.
[00:15:30.061 --> 00:15:34.325]  Now the government admits that Building 7 did fall in free fall, was not hit.
[00:15:34.845 --> 00:15:40.930]  Well, I think after the Cold War, when Reaganomics, it was known as, the inflation was very high and domestic issues had to be addressed.
[00:15:58.527 --> 00:16:03.112]  But Bill Clinton's two tenures, they really amassed a lot of money.
[00:16:03.112 --> 00:16:06.736]  American economy went booming, and he left a lot of money.
[00:16:06.736 --> 00:16:13.844]  And the hard-boiled coal warriors, when they came in, they found that the situation was ready.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:23.984]  They had money and they had resources and they looked upon now the conquest of the world for which there was an opportunity window.
[00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:26.285]  The Muslim world was lying prostrate.
[00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:30.426]  Russia was not still picking up from its foreign position.
[00:16:30.426 --> 00:16:38.329]  China was not ready yet and therefore they looked upon it as an opportunity to go and do the following.
[00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:42.331]  And in this, I'm a soldier and I know that there has to be a single aim
[00:16:42.911 --> 00:16:45.793]  But they mixed up the aims and they have botched up everything.
[00:16:45.793 --> 00:16:51.658]  First, they said that they would go into such strategic areas where there was no U.S.
[00:16:51.658 --> 00:17:01.826]  presence before, such as Western Asia and South Asia, where there was no American physical presence and they wanted it there.
[00:17:01.826 --> 00:17:04.188]  They had to keep the Chinese off.
[00:17:04.804 --> 00:17:15.773]  From getting into the Middle East, they had to lay their hands on the energy tap of the world, which presently lies in the Middle East, but in future it will be in Central Asia.
[00:17:15.773 --> 00:17:19.036]  And so Afghanistan is the gateway to Central Asia.
[00:17:19.036 --> 00:17:22.359]  And finally, to suppress any resistance
[00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:26.442]  Particularly which could threaten the state of Israel.
[00:17:26.442 --> 00:17:33.766]  Now that is where they, instead of pursuing the American objective, they started pursuing the Israeli objective.
[00:17:33.766 --> 00:17:35.688]  And that is where they went wrong.
[00:17:35.688 --> 00:17:37.909]  You have to pick up a single aim.
[00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:40.271]  This is the first principle of war.
[00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:49.277]  And I don't know why the generals and the politicians of America, they could be so naive and so ignorant that they started mixing aims
[00:17:49.861 --> 00:18:01.225]  And they went into this war without wisdom, without particular preparation, and without the American support behind them.
[00:18:01.225 --> 00:18:08.547]  Because if they had gone to vote and asked for support from the American people, they would have never given this support.
[00:18:08.547 --> 00:18:12.428]  So they had to create a pretext, and this was the pretext that they created.
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.841]  General, we're going to break in a moment and come back with a final segment.
[00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:22.603]  Perhaps I can get you to stay a little bit longer because I want you to be able to speak unedited to the American people and the people of the world.
[00:18:22.603 --> 00:18:27.744]  I want to shift gears into Mumbai, what happened in India.
[00:18:27.744 --> 00:18:32.706]  Clearly the evidence of even the Indian intelligence chief, as you know,
[00:18:33.266 --> 00:18:38.007]  Was saying that the Indian government was staging terror attacks on the train.
[00:18:38.007 --> 00:18:40.707]  An army captain was caught doing that and arrested.
[00:18:40.707 --> 00:18:43.048]  The chief of anti-terror was threatened.
[00:18:43.048 --> 00:18:46.128]  He was killed that day when it started in Mumbai.
[00:18:46.128 --> 00:18:54.030]  Now they have caught an anti-terror police officer giving cell phones to the supposed terrorists that they're saying came from Pakistan.
[00:18:54.030 --> 00:19:00.991]  We know the West is deeply in bed with some of the blocks of the former Mujahideen.
[00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:01.791]  Can you speak to that?
[00:19:06.587 --> 00:19:07.708]  General?
[00:19:07.708 --> 00:19:08.829]  Can you hear me?
[00:19:08.829 --> 00:19:11.572]  I can't hear you properly, but can you hear me alright?
[00:19:11.572 --> 00:19:13.133]  Yes sir, I can hear you.
[00:19:13.133 --> 00:19:17.817]  When we come back, we will speak to what happened in India.
[00:19:17.817 --> 00:19:18.478]  Did you hear that?
[00:19:18.478 --> 00:19:19.859]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:20.379]  Good.
[00:19:20.379 --> 00:19:26.985]  Why they are staging terror attacks there, the evidence of false flag inside job in India.
[00:19:26.985 --> 00:19:31.589]  So when we return after this quick break with the former head of Pakistani intelligence,
[00:19:32.831 --> 00:19:36.654]  General Hameed Gul, joining us from Pakistan.
[00:19:36.654 --> 00:19:39.157]  I am coming to you from Austin, Texas.
[00:19:39.157 --> 00:19:40.618]  Hence, the phone troubles.
[00:19:40.618 --> 00:19:42.960]  We'll work on those, sir, during the break.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.861]  We will be right back.
[00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:49.467]  My websites, of course, are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:20:57.651 --> 00:21:04.416]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:04.416 --> 00:21:07.058]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.599]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:09.400]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.341]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:10.341 --> 00:21:11.782]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:11.782 --> 00:21:13.763]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:13.763 --> 00:21:20.909]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:21.409]  Some U.S.
[00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:27.034]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:27.734 --> 00:21:31.617]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:31.617 --> 00:21:41.723]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:41.723 --> 00:21:42.944]  Fabled enemies.

[00:21:50.629 --> 00:21:54.071]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:59.315 --> 00:22:00.777]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:06.823]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:06.823 --> 00:22:07.644]  That's right.
[00:22:07.644 --> 00:22:11.328]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:11.328 --> 00:22:17.435]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:17.975 --> 00:22:26.101]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:31.585]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:31.585 --> 00:22:37.409]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:37.409 --> 00:22:41.912]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:41.912 --> 00:22:42.192]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:42.192 --> 00:22:44.014]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:47.236 --> 00:22:47.536]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.536 --> 00:22:47.736]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:57.503 --> 00:23:01.227]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:23:01.227 --> 00:23:06.953]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:23:06.953 --> 00:23:11.298]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.

[00:24:06.923 --> 00:24:08.204]  We are back live.
[00:24:08.204 --> 00:24:09.765]  It is December 9th, 2008.
[00:24:09.765 --> 00:24:12.208]  General Hamid Ghul
[00:24:29.782 --> 00:24:44.325]  One of the most famous members and commanders of Pakistani intelligence who worked with the United States in the whole operation against the Russians, was the commander of those operations, is our guest with us graciously until 40 after.
[00:24:44.325 --> 00:24:47.085]  General, I'm not wasting any more time.
[00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:55.107]  I listed earlier the fact that Indian intelligence captains in the army have been caught in India staging bombings.
[00:24:55.107 --> 00:24:56.167]  That's Indian news.
[00:24:56.887 --> 00:25:22.439]  uh... that uh... indian intelligence and police have been caught giving cell phones to the supposed shooters the police stood down and only the anti-terror commanders that had said that india was staging terror they were killed in the initiation of the attacks in mumbai that's some of the evidence of mumbai being an inside job namely why do you believe mumbai is a staged event two weeks ago a and b what is the motive
[00:25:23.996 --> 00:25:36.042]  Well, the motive is very simple that Americans want India to come on board with them in their war against terror, especially when they've run out of troops in Afghanistan.
[00:25:36.042 --> 00:25:38.603]  The NATO allies are pulling out.
[00:25:38.603 --> 00:25:39.904]  They are dragging their feet.
[00:25:39.904 --> 00:25:41.605]  They're not prepared to fight there.
[00:25:41.605 --> 00:25:49.068]  But they want to make it an Indian call, and they want nearly 150,000 troops in Afghanistan.
[00:25:51.192 --> 00:25:54.773]  That is one reason where there is an American motive.
[00:25:54.773 --> 00:26:15.377]  There is an Israel motive which is similar that the Americans should not pull out of Afghanistan just because they are short of troops so they must have more troops there because if they go away without denuclearizing Pakistan, State of Israel will remain under perpetual danger.
[00:26:15.377 --> 00:26:17.518]  So they have an innate fear
[00:26:18.234 --> 00:26:21.916]  That Americans may lose heart and pull out of this region.
[00:26:21.916 --> 00:26:24.118]  They're already going out of Iraq.
[00:26:24.118 --> 00:26:34.624]  And if they were to go out of Afghanistan as well, this will be an unfinished agenda, and that Israel would be at the losing end.
[00:26:34.624 --> 00:26:44.810]  So, the neocons and the Zionists, they together want to hatch a conspiracy so that Obama gets trapped into a situation
[00:26:45.551 --> 00:26:50.498]  Where for next four years he'll keep on sorting out this imbroglio.
[00:26:50.498 --> 00:26:59.032]  As far as the ability is concerned, which is the other element, can you imagine that people traveling from Karachi in two rickety boats
[00:26:59.713 --> 00:27:11.219]  They can travel all the way to Bombay and then go into action immediately and fight a battle for 72 hours and there are just 10 of them and in each group there were two.
[00:27:11.219 --> 00:27:12.840]  This is impossible.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:18.003]  They were carrying so much of munitions with them and that munition lasted.
[00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:22.545]  They were fighting virtually the crack troops of the Indian Army for so long.
[00:27:22.545 --> 00:27:25.047]  And you know that in Narima House,
[00:27:25.607 --> 00:27:30.533]  The five Jewish hostages, they were killed by the Indian commandos.
[00:27:30.533 --> 00:27:32.175]  They were not killed by these people.
[00:27:32.175 --> 00:27:35.299]  So why would the Indian commandos kill them?
[00:27:35.299 --> 00:27:38.022]  And Israel suppressed this information.
[00:27:38.022 --> 00:27:44.510]  It initially came out in one of the Israeli dailies, but then it was suppressed.
[00:27:45.071 --> 00:28:03.981]  So, if you go by the record of the Indian accusations against Pakistan, in the past, in year 2001, on December 13, there was an attack on the Indian Lok Sabha, and they blamed Pakistan and Lashkar-e-Taiba for it, but it turned out that these were Indian Kashmiris themselves.
[00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:14.772]  And because India is committing so much of atrocities in Kashmir, therefore there is a good reason for them that they would carry out something like that.
[00:28:14.772 --> 00:28:22.801]  Then again in 2006 there was this Samjhauta Express case in which 68 passengers, mostly Pakistanis, were killed.
[00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:32.675]  And this train was stopped at an obscure railway station in Haryana, and then doors were locked and the train was set on fire.
[00:28:32.675 --> 00:28:41.418]  And again, this was claimed that it was Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba, and that they had done it because they wanted to derail the police forces.
[00:28:41.418 --> 00:28:51.962]  But now Colonel Sirikam Proth has been caught in it, and there are other Indian officers who are his accomplices, and he has a big network.
[00:28:52.546 --> 00:28:58.910]  They took the RDX from Deolali Depot, which is a military depot.
[00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:06.454]  So one can say that there is a deep penetration of the militant Hindus in military and intelligence organizations in India.
[00:29:06.454 --> 00:29:09.816]  So in this case, why would they not do that?
[00:29:09.816 --> 00:29:13.078]  Because they want to again derail this process.
[00:29:13.078 --> 00:29:20.223]  And when Obama says that he will mediate on Kashmir, and there is a Kashmiri political movement picking up momentum,
[00:29:21.023 --> 00:29:29.030]  And in this situation, he said that he would send Bill Clinton as the mediator.
[00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:34.555]  Obviously, the militants in India do not want this to happen, and they had to preempt it.
[00:29:34.555 --> 00:29:36.676]  So, Pakistan doesn't gain.
[00:29:36.676 --> 00:29:39.799]  The Pakistani ISI doesn't gain anything from it.
[00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:44.703]  The net beneficiary is either the militant Hindus... Stay there, sir.
[00:29:44.703 --> 00:29:45.464]  We have to break.
[00:29:45.464 --> 00:29:46.024]  We have to break.
[00:29:47.987 --> 00:29:49.389]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:51.912]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.912 --> 00:29:58.399]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.399 --> 00:29:59.541]  The headlines are clear.
[00:30:00.183 --> 00:30:03.105]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[00:30:03.105 --> 00:30:06.327]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[00:30:06.327 --> 00:30:08.088]  The Mark of the Beast is at hand.
[00:30:08.088 --> 00:30:11.291]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:14.153]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.

[00:33:06.542 --> 00:33:09.304]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.331 --> 00:33:22.252]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, a rare interview, extremely enlightening.
[00:33:22.252 --> 00:33:27.314]  We're talking to the former head of Pakistani intelligence, the ISI.
[00:33:27.314 --> 00:33:30.755]  I want to thank Paul Watson, who we've got on the line, who's going to pop in with a question or two.
[00:33:30.755 --> 00:33:43.099]  I want to thank Simon over in the UK for getting us this number, and I want to thank Aaron for staying up late last night to get the producing job done to get this interview right here on the GCN radio network.
[00:33:43.099 --> 00:33:44.740]  General, continuing with motive,
[00:33:45.934 --> 00:33:50.618]  I have the headline here, Pakistan asserts hoax war call was real.
[00:33:50.618 --> 00:33:57.783]  Press Minister fingers India High Commission as source of reports that threatening cell call was fake.
[00:33:57.783 --> 00:34:00.646]  As you know, this is in most of the major Pakistani papers.
[00:34:00.646 --> 00:34:07.251]  The government has the caller ID and the phone records that the threatening call saying that India was going to attack
[00:34:08.572 --> 00:34:28.564]  Within minutes of the terrorist attacks beginning in Mumbai a few weeks ago, this provocative call within minutes saying India was going to attack Pakistan, attempting to get Pakistan, I guess, to move troops to the border and have a conflict, and the media saying that a possible war between the two thermal nuclear powers was narrowly averted.
[00:34:28.564 --> 00:34:29.265]  Can you speak to that?
[00:34:31.508 --> 00:34:51.728]  Yes indeed, I think the Americans and the Indians both have been very responsible about it because Condoleezza Rice's statement in India when she went and visited Delhi, they were very threatening towards Pakistan and it was sort of a dictation that you have to satisfy India.
[00:34:51.728 --> 00:34:55.932]  Now this is amazing that Pakistan had to satisfy India
[00:34:56.554 --> 00:34:57.634]  On what score?
[00:34:57.634 --> 00:35:09.119]  Indians have still to come out with the evidence and as far as this one man that they have caught, who knows that this is not a bogey and that this man was loitering around somewhere.
[00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:19.723]  There are lots of Pakistanis who crossed the border illegally or legally and he could have been picked up and he's become the front man for singing all those stories.
[00:35:20.353 --> 00:35:21.533]  Well, one doesn't really know.
[00:35:21.533 --> 00:35:34.638]  It's too early to start threatening war against Pakistan because Pakistan is a nuclear country and if they brandish their power, conventional power, then I can assure you that as a soldier I will say that
[00:35:35.456 --> 00:35:42.399]  A conventional war, limited war within the nuclear environment is not possible in the subcontinent.
[00:35:42.399 --> 00:35:48.842]  And if it comes to an exchange of nuclear weapons, then this becomes a third world war.
[00:35:48.842 --> 00:35:51.883]  China cannot stay out, Russia will not stay out.
[00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:56.865]  Russia is already showing its belligerence towards America and Europe.
[00:35:57.605 --> 00:36:01.547]  And China, of course, is a very major economic power.
[00:36:01.547 --> 00:36:06.769]  They are a nuclear power, and if this thing happens in their backyard, they will not accept it.
[00:36:06.769 --> 00:36:09.650]  So this is a very dangerous situation.
[00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.251]  I think it's playing with the fire.
[00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:14.372]  So the whole thing is...
[00:36:16.164 --> 00:36:18.986]  Getting could get out of hand.
[00:36:18.986 --> 00:36:33.278]  It is again, as I told you, that the part of the unfinished agenda that neocons had in their mind, and they think that now Obama will carry it out even though the Americans want a change.
[00:36:33.278 --> 00:36:35.380]  But let's look at what change means.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:42.926]  Obama has not very clearly enunciated what change would be, but one can assume that change means
[00:36:43.638 --> 00:36:54.998]  Focusing on the domestic issues, there is an economic meltdown, the car industry is going sick, and many other things are happening inside America, the social welfare and the Medicare, etc.
[00:36:54.998 --> 00:36:56.842]  So in all these things,
[00:36:57.398 --> 00:37:05.821]  There is a need for the new administration to focus entirely on the domestic issues, and for that it will have to disengage externally.
[00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:18.145]  General, as you know, in the last three months before Obama was even elected, he said Pakistan and Afghanistan would be his main focus, the strikes inside Pakistan.
[00:37:18.145 --> 00:37:22.287]  It's clear that his change means, what Zbigniew Brzezinski wants, shifting
[00:37:23.287 --> 00:37:30.169]  What the Rand Corporation has said they want, shifting the war out of the Middle East into Central Asia.
[00:37:30.169 --> 00:37:33.350]  So I believe the change is going to be these provocations.
[00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:41.833]  Look at the neocons with Israeli and NATO-backed forces launching the sneak attack on the Russian-held South Ossetia on 888.
[00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:45.494]  So it appears that they are trying to launch
[00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:49.003]  A major, uh, larger than a theater war.
[00:37:49.003 --> 00:37:53.576]  Uh, as the Rand Corporation said a month ago, they want a major new war.
[00:37:55.089 --> 00:38:04.515]  Yes, indeed, you're right, because this is an old theory, which is a geostrategic theory, put out first by Mackinder and then by Mahan, who was an admiral in the U.S.
[00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:13.500]  Navy, that this is the Rimland, you have to first control the Rimland in Asia before you can strike in the heartland of Asia.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:24.447]  So, this heartland-Rimland thing, I think it fits into the story, it fits into the picture that if they have a conflict in the Rimland and they can control it,
[00:38:24.967 --> 00:38:30.029]  And then it becomes so much easier to go and penetrate into the heartland.
[00:38:30.029 --> 00:38:39.572]  But this is really asking too much at a state when America is not in a very healthy economic condition.
[00:38:39.572 --> 00:38:44.514]  So I think this is brinkmanship of the highest order.
[00:38:44.514 --> 00:38:48.395]  And if they enlarge the area of conflict in this war against terrorism,
[00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:55.659]  And if they prolong the period of conflict, then America will definitely lose.
[00:38:55.659 --> 00:39:17.033]  Because I know that when you are fighting the irregular fighters, when the area of conflict is enlarged, let's say it's extended into the tribal areas of Pakistan, or it is pushed into Kashmir as well, so that China can be monitored and watched quite easily, then the area will become larger, and the US simply does not have the troops.
[00:39:17.513 --> 00:39:23.296]  And there is not a moral cause strong enough for the American people to be mobilized behind it.
[00:39:23.296 --> 00:39:28.159]  So that's why they staged... I don't know, this is sheer madness to be thinking of such things at this time.
[00:39:28.159 --> 00:39:36.404]  So that's why they need proxies like India to destabilize the region for the encirclement of Russia and of course China blocking those pipelines.
[00:39:36.404 --> 00:39:45.829]  Now, sir, in the time we've got left, you worked with the United States and Saudi Arabia with Israel, or at least Pakistan did, fighting the Russian invasion.
[00:39:46.930 --> 00:40:00.182]  Of course, if these reports are incorrect, correct me, but you were one of the main commanders helping the Mujahideen, then you were the head of Pakistani intelligence right at the time that you finally had the victory against the Russians.
[00:40:00.182 --> 00:40:09.211]  It is reported here that Al-Qaeda was founded by the new Secretary of Defense Gates and Zbigniew Brzezinski, or that they were the Wahhabist fighting corps
[00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:19.353]  And that they are now being used to try to bring down the Pakistani government and to stage attacks inside India.
[00:40:19.353 --> 00:40:23.014]  So can you speak with your particular expertise to that?
[00:40:23.014 --> 00:40:27.055]  And then also the fact that they're trying to now list you as a terrorist.
[00:40:27.055 --> 00:40:31.236]  And then thirdly, did you ever meet Osama Bin Laden?
[00:40:31.236 --> 00:40:35.477]  Is Osama Bin Laden dead many years ago of kidney failure, as Benazir Bhutto said?
[00:40:36.593 --> 00:40:53.679]  Well, I was actually in charge of operations against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the Americans were providing the logistic support and the Saudis were sharing one half of the budget for this war and it was a cheap war because in all
[00:40:54.559 --> 00:40:57.620]  There was 10 years that we were fighting the Russians.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:02.901]  We spent not more than $5 billion out of the American exchequer.
[00:41:02.901 --> 00:41:13.843]  So it was a very cheap war for the Americans to have defeated the Russians and rid the whole of the West of this Red Menace that they used to call.
[00:41:13.843 --> 00:41:19.524]  So at that time, Osama bin Laden and his colleague,
[00:41:20.297 --> 00:41:26.142]  They were admired and they were romanticized by the CIA operators.
[00:41:26.142 --> 00:41:27.383]  I had never met him then.
[00:41:27.383 --> 00:41:29.305]  I had nothing to do with him.
[00:41:29.305 --> 00:41:32.367]  Because I was only busy training the Afghans.
[00:41:32.367 --> 00:41:33.488]  We had to win a war.
[00:41:33.488 --> 00:41:34.889]  We had a task on our hands.
[00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:36.911]  It was a very big task.
[00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:41.495]  And we were so occupied with training only the Afghans.
[00:41:41.495 --> 00:41:44.397]  No other national was trained by the ISI.
[00:41:44.397 --> 00:41:46.058]  I can vouch on that.
[00:41:46.058 --> 00:41:49.121]  Not a single person, not even a Pakistani, was trained by them.
[00:41:49.742 --> 00:41:58.358]  Osama bin Laden was, you know, I had never met him, but these people used to come and talk glowingly about him.
[00:41:59.276 --> 00:42:26.870]  I met Osama Bin Laden after my retirement from the army in 1993 December in Khartoum and then again in year 1994 November when I was there invited by Hassan Bin Torabi to an international conference and during that conference Osama invited us to a banquet and it was all in an open place and there were many other people present
[00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:36.176]  He struck to me as a very normal human being, not a bloodthirsty animal that is being presented by the CIA now.
[00:42:36.176 --> 00:42:40.800]  At that time, no conversation between him and me took place.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.621]  I don't know whether he's living or dead.
[00:42:43.306 --> 00:42:53.429]  But, uh, so far, uh, Eminem has been giving, uh, representing him in various interviews of Osama that have been put out.
[00:42:53.429 --> 00:43:02.031]  So one doesn't really know, but the last interview, which was a voice interview, uh, in that, the CIA and the other U.S.
[00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:06.472]  intelligence agencies authenticated that it was Osama's voice.
[00:43:06.972 --> 00:43:09.975]  So one doesn't really know whether he's living or dead.
[00:43:09.975 --> 00:43:13.317]  But even if he's not living, he's now a symbol.
[00:43:13.317 --> 00:43:15.119]  Al-Qaeda is a franchise.
[00:43:15.119 --> 00:43:23.845]  Whoever created that, and for whatever reason they created, I think it wasn't there until 1996 when he was lodged in Khartoum.
[00:43:23.845 --> 00:43:30.971]  Later on, he was invited by Burhanuddin Rabbani, who is now part of the Northern Alliance in Kabul.
[00:43:30.971 --> 00:43:35.855]  And he came over and he set up his headquarters in a place called Tora Bora near Jalalabad.
[00:43:36.741 --> 00:43:44.124]  But that's where one started hearing of Al-Qaeda and the activities of Osama Bin Laden.
[00:43:44.124 --> 00:44:04.031]  Also, of the fact that his commander was responsible for bringing the blackout on the terrorist operation in Mogadishu, where an American aircraft was brought down by a Stinger, which had probably been supplied in Afghanistan to Afghan Mujahideen.
[00:44:04.031 --> 00:44:04.691]  Okay, General?
[00:44:05.211 --> 00:44:12.093]  General, I need to, in the time we have left here, because we've only got a few minutes left with you here, maybe five minutes and we're going to break, and I don't want to keep you any longer.
[00:44:12.093 --> 00:44:14.153]  We can perhaps have you back up in the future.
[00:44:14.153 --> 00:44:18.315]  Specifically, though, we know his CIA control name was Tim Osman.
[00:44:18.315 --> 00:44:22.616]  We know he was the bag man for a lot of the Saudi money and the Israeli money going in.
[00:44:22.616 --> 00:44:28.677]  I know that was compartmentalized and separate from Pakistani intelligence, from what I've read, from different perspectives, and U.S.
[00:44:28.677 --> 00:44:29.258]  intelligence.
[00:44:29.258 --> 00:44:30.658]  So, I believe you there.
[00:44:31.238 --> 00:44:39.181]  My whole point here is, is that clearly Al-Qaeda, Al-C-I-A-D-A, didn't carry out the attacks of 9-11, as you yourself have said.
[00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:42.562]  And Bin Laden, in his first interview, said that he didn't do it.
[00:44:42.562 --> 00:44:47.263]  Then they produced these computer-morphed videos and fake audios that have been checked.
[00:44:47.263 --> 00:44:53.045]  And the Intel Center, headed up by Rumsfeld's former lieutenant, the private group, was caught
[00:44:53.725 --> 00:45:21.574]  Yes, there is no doubt about it, that this video which was put out in November by George Bush and said this was Osama Bin Laden, he was a high cheeked bone, like the mongoloid features, he wasn't as tall as Osama Bin Laden was, and one could clearly make out that
[00:45:22.054 --> 00:45:30.037]  This was doctored, this had been created on purpose just to justify the attack on Afghanistan.
[00:45:30.037 --> 00:45:38.200]  I think there are many things which are going wrong or being done on behest of the government by the CIA which are not correct.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.281]  The CIA used to be good when they were working with us.
[00:45:41.721 --> 00:45:43.402]  But I don't know what happened thereafter.
[00:45:43.402 --> 00:46:09.258]  I think it is their overarching ambition, or it is their fear that America would lose its clout, whatever the reason, or it is perhaps the Israeli fear that they are surrounded by a sea of hostile enemies who could, if the Americans don't now, at this point in time, they don't deliver a fatal blow to all their enemies, then Israel
[00:46:10.038 --> 00:46:11.379]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:46:11.379 --> 00:46:13.080]  It is Monday, the 15th day of December 2008.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:18.123]  We'll be here for the next 3 hours and 14 minutes, and we have a lot of very informative guests coming up and joining us today.
[00:46:35.507 --> 00:46:40.712]  I apologize for the fact that I'm about 45 minutes late getting on air.
[00:46:40.712 --> 00:46:55.306]  My guys have done a great job building the radio slash TV studio, but because Minnesota is a thousand miles away and we're hooked into satellites and our own internet backup, the backup system itself, because we have three different backup systems,
[00:46:56.187 --> 00:46:58.328]  This didn't happen in all the tests the last two weeks.
[00:46:58.328 --> 00:47:00.649]  It happened right before I went live today.
[00:47:00.649 --> 00:47:04.691]  And this always happens even with, you know, big mainline networks and folks.
[00:47:04.691 --> 00:47:08.473]  They do months of testing beforehand because they know the devil is in the details.
[00:47:08.473 --> 00:47:09.353]  So, no big deal.
[00:47:09.353 --> 00:47:15.356]  I didn't think I'd be back in this studio that we were going to dismantle this afternoon.
[00:47:15.356 --> 00:47:17.417]  I thought Friday would be my last show here.
[00:47:17.417 --> 00:47:18.517]  I'm kind of missing it.
[00:47:18.517 --> 00:47:22.539]  When you've been in a studio for three and a half years, you come to love it.
[00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:23.859]  It becomes like your little nest.
[00:47:23.859 --> 00:47:24.880]  You're very, very comfortable.
[00:47:25.914 --> 00:47:27.154]  In it.
[00:47:27.154 --> 00:47:35.456]  And, uh, so I was, you know, getting ready to do my show out of, uh, the new studio, but was happy to do it because it's really nice.
[00:47:35.456 --> 00:47:37.677]  And, uh, we had some, uh, problems with that.
[00:47:37.677 --> 00:47:44.239]  We did the Maiden TV transmission for an hour and 50 minutes, uh, last, uh, Friday.
[00:47:44.239 --> 00:47:46.639]  That was, uh, very successful.
[00:47:46.639 --> 00:47:53.821]  And I should be back in the studio tomorrow and doing the prison planet dot TV fourth hour from there tomorrow.
[00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:58.932]  And again, this is all part of the growing process.
[00:47:58.932 --> 00:48:03.016]  It's also the way the poor man does it.
[00:48:03.016 --> 00:48:09.581]  I couldn't afford to do what we're doing if I used, you know, big mainline companies and contractors and people like that.
[00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:13.084]  And then even then you have a lot of problems doing all this on the cheaps here.
[00:48:13.835 --> 00:48:16.315]  In an attempt to upgrade what we're doing.
[00:48:16.315 --> 00:48:25.577]  But think about it, streaming video, streaming audio, feeding satellites, feeding radio networks with a new system.
[00:48:25.577 --> 00:48:35.199]  We're doing some things at the Genesis Network and then on my own end down here that other people, most people haven't been doing or others are just now starting to attempt to do.
[00:48:35.199 --> 00:48:39.820]  It really is the cutting edge of the new media.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.180]  Who do we have for you today on the show?
[00:48:43.601 --> 00:48:49.527]  We have talked to the Marine Corps officer out in 29 Palms.
[00:48:49.527 --> 00:48:54.513]  They did tell the local media that they were going to be out with the police at DWI checkpoints assisting them.
[00:48:54.513 --> 00:49:05.884]  Then they told local media once there was pressure last week on local radio and TV that they were just going to be aiding people and they didn't know if it was illegal, but that
[00:49:06.983 --> 00:49:12.484]  They weren't sure whether they were going to be out at all the DWI checkpoints of the regular Marine Corps.
[00:49:12.484 --> 00:49:18.446]  Well, we talked to the Marine Corps this morning and they said, well, we'll come on your show tomorrow.
[00:49:18.446 --> 00:49:21.006]  That's the soonest they'll be on.
[00:49:21.006 --> 00:49:27.988]  And they said, we know who you are because I had Aaron say, and it's not a lie, but it's, it's, it's technical so that they don't get scared off from the show.
[00:49:27.988 --> 00:49:28.828]  He said, this is 590 AM.
[00:49:28.828 --> 00:49:31.109]  And he said, I know who you are.
[00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.869]  This is Aaron.
[00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:34.530]  And you work with Kurt Nemo and Alex Jones.
[00:49:36.497 --> 00:49:38.658]  And, uh, I don't know.
[00:49:38.658 --> 00:49:42.120]  I mean, every Marine we run into who's an officer knows who I am.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:51.166]  It seems, you know, they had the Marines out brainwashing children Friday here in Austin in full battle gear with their weapons.
[00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:58.290]  Uh, and, uh, we show up and, and, and, uh, well, a listener does and they walk up with the phone and the guy goes, Oh yeah, Alex Jones here.
[00:49:58.290 --> 00:49:59.590]  I'll talk to him.
[00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:05.634]  So they're fully aware over the years I've been to so many of their urban warfare training events that, uh, I guess I'm somewhat of a,
[00:50:06.676 --> 00:50:16.361]  folk creature and I'm sure that everything I've done has been exaggerated and twisted many times over so that's interesting.
[00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:27.548]  We do have a local radio talk show host, Gary Denault, joining us from KCDZ FM, the local FM talk station.
[00:50:27.548 --> 00:50:28.288]  He'll be joining us.
[00:50:28.288 --> 00:50:29.669]  He's talked to the Marines as well.
[00:50:30.538 --> 00:50:36.623]  We have people on TheInfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com stories about this saying it's not true.
[00:50:36.623 --> 00:50:39.746]  Or saying they want proof this is going on.
[00:50:39.746 --> 00:50:43.308]  Obama has announced, the military has announced, Bush announced.
[00:50:43.308 --> 00:50:45.830]  You're gonna see regular Army and Marines on the streets, okay?
[00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.993]  This is part of the takeover that's going on.
[00:50:48.993 --> 00:50:54.918]  We also have John Watkins, enough respect director, coming on, and Dr. Russell Blaylock, and a lot more key news.
[00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:55.939]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:50:57.839 --> 00:51:01.460]  Drought, crop failure, economic collapse, famine.
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.521]  Is this in America's future?
[00:51:03.521 --> 00:51:06.802]  Sadly, this is part of America's not-so-distant past.
[00:51:06.802 --> 00:51:14.325]  During the Great Depression, half of the American people grew much of their own food, but over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[00:51:14.685 --> 00:51:18.927]  Today it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans grow their own food.
[00:51:18.927 --> 00:51:22.529]  Plan for your family's future and don't leave anything to chance.
[00:51:22.529 --> 00:51:32.154]  Go to GetSeeds.net and give the gift of life this Christmas and help ensure that if history repeats itself, you and your loved ones will be prepared for crisis.

[00:51:57.173 --> 00:52:04.160]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.201]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:07.201 --> 00:52:08.742]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:08.742 --> 00:52:09.542]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:09.542 --> 00:52:10.383]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:10.383 --> 00:52:11.924]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:11.924 --> 00:52:13.904]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:13.904 --> 00:52:21.048]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:21.048 --> 00:52:21.528]  Some U.S.
[00:52:21.528 --> 00:52:27.171]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:27.871 --> 00:52:31.773]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:31.773 --> 00:52:41.857]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:41.857 --> 00:52:43.077]  Fabled enemies.
[00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:50.840]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.202]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:57.642 --> 00:53:01.085]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:53:01.085 --> 00:53:04.888]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:53:04.888 --> 00:53:11.193]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:53:11.193 --> 00:53:15.817]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:53:15.817 --> 00:53:21.842]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:53:21.842 --> 00:53:25.265]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:53:25.265 --> 00:53:25.946]  Run some pumps.
[00:53:26.306 --> 00:53:29.909]  Shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:53:29.909 --> 00:53:36.135]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:53:36.135 --> 00:53:41.120]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.443]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:53:45.443 --> 00:53:45.944]  That's my
[00:53:46.244 --> 00:53:53.908]  SolarBackup.com today or call 877-327-0365.
[00:53:53.908 --> 00:53:55.749]  877-327-0365.
[00:53:55.749 --> 00:53:56.430]  Don't wait.
[00:53:56.430 --> 00:54:03.073]  Call today.
[00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:05.474]  Just a broadcast note.
[00:54:05.474 --> 00:54:15.020]  Congressman Ron Paul will be on for the first 30 minutes at the start of the show Wednesday to talk about the banker hijacking of the entire economy.
[00:54:16.599 --> 00:54:23.992]  Obama's declaration that he will declare CO2 a toxic waste.
[00:54:23.992 --> 00:54:27.719]  That is the complete takeover of the economy and neo-serfdom feudalism.
[00:54:29.753 --> 00:54:31.174]  And a lot more.
[00:54:31.174 --> 00:54:33.115]  He's also on the inside track in Congress.
[00:54:33.115 --> 00:54:35.196]  What is the big surprise?
[00:54:35.196 --> 00:54:37.817]  Coming up on the 21st or 22nd.
[00:54:37.817 --> 00:54:43.420]  Now only a month away in January.
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:46.021]  So that is coming up Wednesday.
[00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:47.462]  That would be the 17th.
[00:54:47.462 --> 00:54:48.622]  This is the 15th.
[00:54:48.622 --> 00:54:50.183]  It is Monday.
[00:54:50.183 --> 00:54:51.324]  We are live.
[00:54:51.324 --> 00:54:53.625]  You heard some excerpts from the interview with General
[00:54:55.137 --> 00:54:56.538]  Hamid Gould.
[00:54:56.538 --> 00:55:12.251]  By the way, did you know the Times of India, Israeli newspapers, European newspapers, scores of newspapers, you can type his name into Google News, picked up that interview last week, and unanimously, none of them gave credit to the radio show.
[00:55:13.472 --> 00:55:27.620]  Even the World Socialist website picked it up and they said he gave a radio interview, he gave a media interview on Tuesday and then said all the amazing things that he reported here.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:33.483]  And look, it's not that I even care about getting the credit other than the fact that that brings us new listeners.
[00:55:33.483 --> 00:55:36.285]  It's that in normal journalism, normal media,
[00:55:37.054 --> 00:55:53.769]  We will tell you where we heard something, and we're telling you the Marines are announcing that starting on the 12th, and now three days ago, that they're with police at checkpoints in San Bernardino County, off base, off of 29 Palms, running checkpoints with the police.
[00:55:53.769 --> 00:55:56.552]  You know, we have multiple sources on that.
[00:55:57.481 --> 00:56:07.757]  And we plug the news blog, we plug the local news talk station that reported it, and we have the news talk station host joining us coming up in about 35 minutes.
[00:56:07.757 --> 00:56:10.081]  Because we want to give you the source.
[00:56:10.081 --> 00:56:12.485]  The Times of India is one of the biggest newspapers in the world.
[00:56:13.604 --> 00:56:18.946]  Why would it not give the source and just say Hamid Gul said this?
[00:56:18.946 --> 00:56:31.952]  So they're breaking with just the basic journalistic standards of not even sourcing because they don't want to give attention to this radio show that continues to make headlines worldwide.
[00:56:31.952 --> 00:56:42.516]  Speaking of censorship and the establishment trying to bury the growth curve of this radio broadcast and the work we do at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[00:56:44.562 --> 00:57:10.618]  The Wall Street Journal is reporting today, and Paul Watson's doing a big article on it that'll be up by tonight, announcing the two-tiered internet, where they're going to basically shut down the old web and force you onto the new, quote, high-speed web, but where the search engine rankings are controlled, Google decides what goes up, and alternative websites are basically shut down, and you won't be able to get to alternative websites, so it's a partitioning of the web.
[00:57:11.502 --> 00:57:16.989]  They grow, develop the web, get everybody on it, and then just basically incrementally shut down the old web.
[00:57:16.989 --> 00:57:21.696]  That is now in the Wall Street Journal today, what we told you four years ago.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:38.446]  When we really started first reporting, I guess five years ago, on Internet2, this consortium of private corporations, governments, and foundations, as well as universities, they announced that it's to shut off the alternative media.
[00:57:38.446 --> 00:57:41.147]  They announced it is to kill free speech.
[00:57:41.147 --> 00:57:44.008]  They announced it is to suppress radicals, as they've said.
[00:57:44.628 --> 00:57:52.791]  And that's what the mainstream media has to do, because the newspapers, the television, all of it is imploding, all of it is falling apart and has lost all credibility.
[00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:53.852]  Let me tell you something, guys.
[00:57:53.852 --> 00:57:54.872]  Too little, too late.
[00:57:54.872 --> 00:58:03.556]  People know you're a pack of spinning, twisting liars, and they're aware of your activities, so too little, too late.
[00:58:03.556 --> 00:58:07.437]  Cat's out of the bag, and we are going to invade the new internet, too, as well.
[00:58:07.437 --> 00:58:10.399]  We're going to boycott people attempting to bring it in.
[00:58:10.399 --> 00:58:11.319]  We are going to fight it.
[00:58:12.526 --> 00:58:15.368]  Okay, news glitch when we get back for the next 30 minutes.
[00:58:15.368 --> 00:58:22.614]  Big stack of important news here that we're going to be covering when we get back in just 70 seconds after the break.
[00:58:22.614 --> 00:58:33.483]  Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, there's two days left to be guaranteed that you get your UPS package of books and videos from InfoWars.com shopping cart before Christmas.
[00:58:33.483 --> 00:58:35.445]  So get your orders in now and spread the truth.
[00:58:39.551 --> 00:58:42.174]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:42.174 --> 00:58:48.160]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:55.127]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:57.190]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:58:57.190 --> 00:59:04.233]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:59:04.233 --> 00:59:13.136]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:59:13.136 --> 00:59:19.919]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:59:20.219 --> 00:59:23.401]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:59:23.401 --> 00:59:27.284]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was BOOM!
[00:59:27.284 --> 00:59:27.605]  BOOM!
[00:59:27.605 --> 00:59:27.925]  BOOM!
[00:59:27.925 --> 00:59:28.245]  BOOM!
[00:59:28.245 --> 00:59:29.166]  BOOM!
[00:59:29.166 --> 00:59:32.248]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:59:32.248 --> 00:59:38.293]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.TV and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:59:38.293 --> 00:59:41.235]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:59:41.235 --> 00:59:46.159]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:52.951]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:52.951 --> 00:59:59.876]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:59.876 --> 01:00:01.177]  Big Brother.
[01:00:01.177 --> 01:00:02.958]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:04.719]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:04.719 --> 01:00:06.281]  You want answers?
[01:00:06.281 --> 01:00:07.862]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:07.862 --> 01:00:12.045]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.045 --> 01:00:16.108]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.773 --> 01:00:33.079]  Well, the Marines, not just in California, but we're getting reports all over the nation, are out this holiday season, this Christmas, running checkpoints on highways with state police, like the CHIPS, California Highway Patrol.
[01:00:35.974 --> 01:00:42.056]  And we're going to go directly to one of the local news stations that's been reporting on this coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:44.277]  We did talk to the Marine Corps this morning.
[01:00:44.277 --> 01:00:46.517]  Aaron Dykes is going to be in studio with us.
[01:00:46.517 --> 01:00:51.159]  They did confirm that they are doing this, but they said it's just for training.
[01:00:52.406 --> 01:01:05.311]  It's always for training, but now the Army and the Marine Corps admits, officially, they are going to be engaging the American people against insurrection, rioting, and things of that nature.
[01:01:05.311 --> 01:01:12.014]  Doesn't matter if they admit it, doesn't matter how many videos I have, doesn't matter how many government documents I have, people are still in denial.
[01:01:12.853 --> 01:01:22.136]  Because 10-15 years ago, alternative media would talk about this, and people would laugh at them because the mainstream media said it wasn't being prepared, wasn't being set up.
[01:01:22.136 --> 01:01:34.179]  Then it all magically unfolds, right on time as we told you it would, and people still say it doesn't exist because they can't admit they were wrong about that because then they'd have to admit they were wrong about everything else.
[01:01:34.179 --> 01:01:40.901]  I remember a ne'er-do-well about a year ago called me up and was saying threatening things and
[01:01:41.877 --> 01:01:44.499]  You know, I pointed out the economy was going to be imploding.
[01:01:44.499 --> 01:01:48.422]  I pointed out that Ford and Chevy were on the verge of going under and he called me a conspiracy theorist.
[01:01:48.422 --> 01:01:51.124]  I was only going off all the data.
[01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:57.409]  All we do is cover the facts and the information here on this radio show.
[01:01:57.409 --> 01:02:03.034]  And the public out there sitting on the fence would do well to stop living in denial and at least check out the claims we're making.
[01:02:05.177 --> 01:02:10.682]  More power loss possible in ice-ravaged Northeast.
[01:02:10.682 --> 01:02:17.207]  Hundreds of thousands of people are without power in Massachusetts and other states up in Maine, New Hampshire.
[01:02:17.207 --> 01:02:22.871]  We're getting record cold temperatures right now in areas of Texas.
[01:02:22.871 --> 01:02:26.194]  But meanwhile, Al Gore came out in the Associated Press today.
[01:02:26.194 --> 01:02:28.916]  This is a quote.
[01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:31.458]  Obama left with little time to curb global warming.
[01:02:31.458 --> 01:02:34.701]  Cooling trends illustrates how fast the world is warming.
[01:02:35.478 --> 01:02:36.559]  That's right.
[01:02:36.559 --> 01:02:37.760]  Cold is the new hot.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:44.644]  Al Gore, in the article, says cooling trends illustrate how fast the world is warming.
[01:02:44.644 --> 01:02:45.645]  That's right.
[01:02:45.645 --> 01:02:54.691]  Colder weather in the solar system, on the moons of Uranus, Neptune, Jupiter, Saturn.
[01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:57.913]  The ice caps have been shrinking on Mars.
[01:02:57.913 --> 01:03:02.636]  They're now getting larger for the last year and a half because of the sun has cooled off.
[01:03:03.444 --> 01:03:06.187]  They've been measuring the sun for 300 years continually.
[01:03:06.187 --> 01:03:08.929]  It is the coolest it's ever been measured.
[01:03:08.929 --> 01:03:13.694]  So it was in a hot phase, kind of heated up like a light bulb that's about to burn out.
[01:03:13.694 --> 01:03:15.275]  You know, right before they burn out, they get brighter.
[01:03:15.275 --> 01:03:19.019]  Not saying the sun's about to burn out, but it heats up, it cools down.
[01:03:19.019 --> 01:03:23.143]  It heats up, it cools down in regular patterns.
[01:03:23.143 --> 01:03:26.366]  What is the answer of Robert Kennedy Jr.?
[01:03:26.366 --> 01:03:27.407]  I saw him on a video clip online.
[01:03:28.823 --> 01:03:34.847]  When he was confronted with this by We Are Change, he just said, no, there are no ice caps on Mars.
[01:03:34.847 --> 01:03:35.568]  What was, um...
[01:03:37.116 --> 01:03:44.818]  Rothschild's comment here a year ago, plus on the show, when I said, well, why are the ice caps getting smaller on Mars?
[01:03:44.818 --> 01:03:53.380]  Why are the moons of Saturn and Jupiter, like Titan for instance, having areas on them that had ice that has melted?
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.781]  And they have clear telescope photos of this.
[01:03:55.781 --> 01:03:59.362]  And he just said, no, those planets are closer to the sun.
[01:03:59.362 --> 01:04:01.022]  And I said, no, they're not.
[01:04:01.022 --> 01:04:04.783]  I said, Jupiter and Saturn are closer.
[01:04:07.096 --> 01:04:34.273]  to uh... deep space there the the earth is closer and he just said nope knowing that the general public isn't aware today revel in the fact that the public is ignorant and so now uh... al gore is saying that because everything is cooling down that that is global warming notice they don't say global warming anymore now they say climate change so they want to ban the seasons
[01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:39.671]  And the fact that the Earth is always heating up and cooling down.
[01:04:39.671 --> 01:04:41.452]  It's a total takeover of the economy.
[01:04:41.452 --> 01:04:47.814]  That's all this is, is a guilt-laden tax to totally micromanage society.
[01:04:47.814 --> 01:04:51.295]  It is just absolutely nightmarish in its full implications.
[01:04:51.295 --> 01:04:52.876]  We'll get more to that when we come back, and a lot more.
[01:04:52.876 --> 01:04:53.236]  Stay with me.

[01:05:19.244 --> 01:05:21.965]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[01:05:21.965 --> 01:05:24.106]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:05:24.106 --> 01:05:25.066]  this fall?
[01:05:25.066 --> 01:05:25.906]  Don't wait.

[01:05:50.356 --> 01:05:50.536]  Act now!
[01:05:56.021 --> 01:06:02.763]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:02.763 --> 01:06:05.403]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:05.403 --> 01:06:06.944]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:06.944 --> 01:06:07.744]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:07.744 --> 01:06:08.584]  This is his MO.
[01:06:08.584 --> 01:06:10.125]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:12.085]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.085 --> 01:06:18.827]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:19.247 --> 01:06:19.728]  Some U.S.
[01:06:19.728 --> 01:06:26.093]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:26.093 --> 01:06:29.575]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:29.575 --> 01:06:40.084]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:40.084 --> 01:06:41.305]  Fabled Enemies.
[01:06:41.305 --> 01:06:47.930]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:49.052 --> 01:06:52.405]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:02.304 --> 01:07:04.246]  The time clock is ticking.
[01:07:04.246 --> 01:07:05.547]  Laws could change.
[01:07:05.547 --> 01:07:08.310]  The New World Order is advancing rapidly.
[01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:10.773]  Health consciousness is fading away.
[01:07:10.773 --> 01:07:16.298]  Junk food, fast food, fat food is the New World Order's game.
[01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:18.220]  Don't play the game!
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:24.547]  Slim down, detox, and cleanse yourself from the chemical foods and processed food that we intake daily.
[01:07:24.747 --> 01:07:26.328]  And now for the holiday special.
[01:07:26.328 --> 01:07:29.831]  Buy one month of Super Tee and we'll throw in an extra two weeks.
[01:07:29.831 --> 01:07:30.752]  That's right.
[01:07:30.752 --> 01:07:33.874]  One month of Super Tee and we'll throw in an extra two weeks.
[01:07:33.874 --> 01:07:36.036]  It won't last long, so order now.

[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:42.060]  That's 928-308-0408.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:43.441]  Order now before you can't.
[01:07:56.144 --> 01:08:12.770]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:21.154]  We're live, coming up in about 25 minutes, we'll take you to California where the Marines are out running checkpoints with the state police to condition the public for complete martial law.
[01:08:22.907 --> 01:08:25.829]  Got a bunch of other news that goes along with that.
[01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:29.533]  A constitutional convention snuck up on us last week.
[01:08:29.533 --> 01:08:35.237]  They were only, the feds, only one state away from getting a constitutional convention and uh...
[01:08:36.482 --> 01:08:41.724]  That is being fought right now in several states by a razor's edge margin.
[01:08:41.724 --> 01:08:49.748]  Though Kurt Nemo Friday did a report, Globalist Constitutional Convention dealt a defeat in Ohio, but they're still trying to pass it there.
[01:08:49.748 --> 01:08:54.730]  And for those that don't know what that means, they could rewrite the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution very quickly.
[01:08:54.730 --> 01:09:04.254]  Finishing up with the global warming story, it's an article out of the Associated Press, Obama left with little time to curb global warming.
[01:09:04.989 --> 01:09:09.372]  And in here, there's a quote by Al Gore saying, Obama left a little time to curb global warming.
[01:09:09.372 --> 01:09:13.555]  Cooling trend illustrates how fast the world is warming.
[01:09:13.555 --> 01:09:16.877]  Now, the Earth is always heating up and cooling down.
[01:09:16.877 --> 01:09:18.339]  Most of it's based on the sun.
[01:09:18.339 --> 01:09:21.000]  The sun has cooled down, so now we're cooling down.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.081]  Who knows how long.
[01:09:22.081 --> 01:09:24.443]  They don't understand the sun.
[01:09:24.443 --> 01:09:26.444]  Completely.
[01:09:26.444 --> 01:09:27.745]  Or even that big of a grasp of it.
[01:09:27.745 --> 01:09:30.227]  They just know that that's the main heater of the planet.
[01:09:31.889 --> 01:09:35.491]  There's no debating that, but they're counting on the public being stupid.
[01:09:35.491 --> 01:09:42.856]  I watched about 15 minutes of TV this weekend and was flipping past some children's cartoons.
[01:09:42.856 --> 01:09:49.500]  I think the show was Charlie and Lola and I watched about a minute of it and it was about polar bears drowning and not being able to
[01:09:51.115 --> 01:09:57.797]  Not being able to make it back to the ice, as if polar bears can't swim, and that the glaciers are all melting.
[01:09:57.797 --> 01:10:19.325]  Glaciers flow, it's ice flowing, and the condensation, the rain, the snow, the sleet builds up, and then it pushes down through the valleys, through the fords, fjords, to the ocean, and they're always coming to the sea in the spring, breaking off into the ocean, but again, they know the public isn't aware of that, so they say, oh my god, look,
[01:10:19.938 --> 01:10:24.241]  The glaciers are all melting.
[01:10:24.241 --> 01:10:31.485]  Remember about six months ago, the United Nations and the media said for sure that part of Antarctica and the Arctic would break off.
[01:10:31.485 --> 01:10:33.307]  It was going to be a huge disaster.
[01:10:33.307 --> 01:10:36.929]  That the sea levels would rise this year and flood some cities.
[01:10:36.929 --> 01:10:41.672]  And they said that the North Pole would probably be completely melted this year.
[01:10:43.635 --> 01:11:01.738]  Well, actually, last time I checked, and this was reported by all the major weather outfits, the satellite photos, 33% increase in the size of the Arctic and 33% increase in the diameter of the ice of the Antarctic to the south.
[01:11:01.738 --> 01:11:04.179]  That doesn't matter.
[01:11:04.179 --> 01:11:09.440]  Because the public, and they've done studies, most of the public doesn't know what the Arctic is versus the Antarctic.
[01:11:10.202 --> 01:11:14.285]  They don't know that it expands and contracts every year.
[01:11:14.285 --> 01:11:20.030]  They don't know that, again, Mars has ice caps and that those were melting and now expanding again.
[01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:21.371]  They just don't know this.
[01:11:21.371 --> 01:11:29.078]  They don't know that their SUV isn't causing ice caps to melt on Mars.
[01:11:29.078 --> 01:11:36.484]  And they don't understand that the government of the world, the private banks that are openly announcing that they are the government of the world, want to tax and regulate
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:48.569]  Every facet of human life on this planet.
[01:11:48.569 --> 01:12:01.982]  So Obama, he's just gotta pass this greenhouse gases law to tax your cows, and tax your sheep, and tax your fowl, and tax your business, your home, anything that puts off carbon, including human breathing!
[01:12:01.982 --> 01:12:04.444]  That's been proposed by the United Nations.
[01:12:05.956 --> 01:12:11.920]  Also, Reuters is saying Obama's stimulus could reach $1 trillion to get the economy going.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.781]  What is that $1 trillion?
[01:12:12.781 --> 01:12:16.924]  It's going to be a payoff to cronies and friends of the establishment.
[01:12:16.924 --> 01:12:24.269]  The defense budget is over a trillion dollars for 2009 separately, but $8.5 trillion in the first seven weeks.
[01:12:24.269 --> 01:12:32.896]  We haven't gotten numbers in about a week and a half yet on how many more trillions they've stolen.
[01:12:32.896 --> 01:12:34.777]  It normally comes out each week how much they've stolen.
[01:12:35.638 --> 01:12:44.881]  It'd be 1 trillion, 2 trillion, 3 trillion, 4 trillion, about a trillion, 300 billion on average stolen by the offshore private banks per week.
[01:12:44.881 --> 01:12:47.341]  But now in the last week and a half, just no numbers coming out.
[01:12:47.341 --> 01:12:59.385]  They won't even... Congress isn't even saying... Of course, Congress and Bloomberg have been told, the media and the elected government have been told, the Federal Reserve is above the law and will no longer tell anyone anything.
[01:13:02.256 --> 01:13:06.278]  So, just words do not describe how tyrannical that is.
[01:13:06.278 --> 01:13:11.622]  Top banks admit huge losses in Wall Street pyramid fraud.
[01:13:11.622 --> 01:13:14.503]  And this report is from the French News Agency.
[01:13:14.503 --> 01:13:27.131]  Top world financial groups on Monday revealed massive potential losses, in the hundreds of billions, from an alleged scam run by Wall Street trader Bernard Madoff, admitting they were fooled by a classic pyramid investment fraud.
[01:13:27.131 --> 01:13:28.232]  What do you think derivatives are?
[01:13:28.232 --> 01:13:31.654]  That's where your pension funds went.
[01:13:33.846 --> 01:13:49.598]  British, French, Japanese, and Spanish banks and funds and investments totaling billions of dollars, euros, could be wiped off the balance sheets by the scandal that is set to affect some of the richest people in the world.
[01:13:49.598 --> 01:14:02.167]  The Royal Bank of Scotland alone is going to lose 400 million pounds, joining a growing list of banks and investors in Europe, Asia, and the United States struck by the scandal.
[01:14:02.167 --> 01:14:02.808]  Shares in
[01:14:04.975 --> 01:14:16.503]  Santander, the biggest bank in Spain and the second largest in Europe after HSBC, plunged after the lender said it had an exposure of more than three billion dollars to Madoff Investment Securities in New York.
[01:14:16.503 --> 01:14:20.165]  By the way, he's moved to Dubai.
[01:14:20.165 --> 01:14:25.309]  Non-extradition, just like Cheney and everybody else and Halliburton and Blackwater have all moved there.
[01:14:25.309 --> 01:14:27.670]  So they can laugh at us from afar.
[01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:29.332]  No extradition.
[01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:30.532]  Shares again plunged.
[01:14:33.277 --> 01:14:37.941]  Nannex's investment bank already brought low by subprime losses.
[01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:38.681]  See, that's all a lie.
[01:14:38.681 --> 01:14:39.942]  It's not subprime losses.
[01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:42.184]  It's that they sold derivatives on those.
[01:14:42.184 --> 01:14:49.130]  Put its maximum exposure at 450 million euros, or 606 million dollars.
[01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:54.775]  Retail banking giant BNP revealed potential losses, and it goes on and on from there.
[01:14:54.775 --> 01:14:58.157]  And that's just banks in the tens of billions.
[01:14:58.157 --> 01:14:59.759]  Investors are saying it's hundreds of billions.
[01:15:00.356 --> 01:15:01.957]  Just private investors.
[01:15:01.957 --> 01:15:04.879]  You know, the deal sounds like it's too good to be true.
[01:15:04.879 --> 01:15:07.141]  It is.
[01:15:07.141 --> 01:15:08.621]  It's that simple.
[01:15:08.621 --> 01:15:13.024]  And we're going to get Gerald Cilente back on the show this week, not just Ron Paul.
[01:15:13.024 --> 01:15:17.167]  Greece-style riots coming to the U.S., we've predicted that as well.
[01:15:17.167 --> 01:15:20.810]  Troops and mercenaries will be used to detain Americans in prison camps.
[01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:24.372]  Warren's a deadly accurate trends forecaster.
[01:15:24.372 --> 01:15:27.354]  By the way, I was flattered to find out, he's a long-time listener of the show.
[01:15:28.419 --> 01:15:47.584]  Frighteningly accurate trends forecaster Gerald Salenti says the American people and America will see riots similar to those currently ongoing in Greece and that this will cause, will be caused by hyperinflation and depression, leading to the inevitable use of troops and mercenaries to deal with the crisis as Americans are incarcerated in internment camps.
[01:15:47.584 --> 01:15:50.385]  Now, remember though, the banks engineered all of this.
[01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:57.434]  The Army and the Marines are all saying, oh, we just now started planning to be on the streets of America.
[01:15:57.434 --> 01:16:03.019]  We just now got the idea we have to do this, when for decades they've been quietly setting it up.
[01:16:04.929 --> 01:16:13.994]  And I'm seeing a lot of military people in military newspapers and websites and message boards laughing, saying, oh, well, we got our pensions from Uncle Sam, we'll be fine.
[01:16:13.994 --> 01:16:17.115]  Yeah, they're just going to devalue it and tax it and give you a pittance.
[01:16:17.115 --> 01:16:18.016]  So go ahead and laugh.
[01:16:18.016 --> 01:16:20.577]  I mean, you're engineered to laugh at the people.
[01:16:20.577 --> 01:16:22.338]  The police have been trained to be paramilitary.
[01:16:23.098 --> 01:16:25.219]  And again, a military fight's an enemy.
[01:16:25.219 --> 01:16:26.300]  So see, we're now the enemy.
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:29.401]  But see, what you didn't know is, you're the enemy of the New World Order too.
[01:16:29.401 --> 01:16:32.723]  What you didn't know was that you're not going to be winners either.
[01:16:32.723 --> 01:16:36.725]  What you didn't understand was, you're in the same boat with us.
[01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:45.169]  So they taught you to hate us, they taught you to despise us, they, you know, to call us civilians, and that you're paramilitary, and that it's an us-against-them mentality.
[01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:49.331]  Okay, go ahead and guard the bank robbers as they suck the country dry.
[01:16:49.331 --> 01:16:51.472]  But they're going to take your pension funds.
[01:16:52.324 --> 01:16:54.566]  Many of you will get nothing.
[01:16:54.566 --> 01:16:55.207]  Okay?
[01:16:55.207 --> 01:16:59.070]  And for feds out there, yours is going to be massively reduced.
[01:16:59.070 --> 01:17:01.132]  So keep on laughing.
[01:17:01.132 --> 01:17:05.876]  Keep on being evil, and see what happens to servants of evil.
[01:17:05.876 --> 01:17:07.537]  I'm not the one that's going to punish you.
[01:17:07.537 --> 01:17:09.219]  You're going to punish yourself.
[01:17:09.219 --> 01:17:11.341]  So cut off your nose to spite your face.
[01:17:11.341 --> 01:17:16.645]  I'm asking you not to, but hey, don't let me get in the way of what you're so dedicated to do.
[01:17:19.013 --> 01:17:21.875]  As we have highlighted before, Salente's accuracy is stunning.
[01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:30.440]  He predicted at any 7 the crash, the subprime mortgage crisis, and the panic of 08, and is routinely cited even by mainstream news networks as highly credible.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.122]  He's got about a 95% accuracy rate.
[01:17:32.122 --> 01:17:41.728]  The cause of the riots will be hyperinflationary depression, Salente told interviewer Lou Rockwell, causing Americans to revolt in similar circumstances than we have witnessed recently in Iceland and Greece.
[01:17:42.389 --> 01:17:48.591]  The trouble would be sparked up by Obama declaring a bank holiday, or by people who won't be able to withdraw their money.
[01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:51.873]  See, our media doesn't tell you unless you read deep into the articles.
[01:17:51.873 --> 01:17:59.756]  They're rioting and, you know, they're, oh, they're just young punks, they're just scum, they just, they're communists, they just hate freedom.
[01:17:59.756 --> 01:18:01.616]  No, the banks have been shutting down.
[01:18:01.616 --> 01:18:03.757]  The banks have been not giving them their money.
[01:18:03.757 --> 01:18:06.458]  The jobs are disappearing.
[01:18:06.458 --> 01:18:08.659]  And the police are out shooting people in the streets.
[01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:15.010]  The cause of the riots would be a hyperinflationary depression, Salente told an interviewer.
[01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:19.553]  What's going on in Greece with these riots has nothing to do with a 15-year-old boy being killed.
[01:18:19.553 --> 01:18:30.440]  That was only the spark that ignited the pent-up, really, the hatred and disdain people have for the scandals and corrupt government, and the same thing is going on in this country as well, said Salente.
[01:18:32.395 --> 01:18:36.299]  The military and the police better be asking, whose side are you going to be on?
[01:18:36.299 --> 01:18:37.240]  I don't want riots.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:38.201]  I don't want this to happen.
[01:18:38.201 --> 01:18:45.990]  It's in the IMF and World Bank plans, documents, that I put in my book seven years ago, 9-11 dissent and tyranny.
[01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:51.196]  In the book we talk about by 2007-2009, in there, that they were planning this because we had their documents.
[01:18:53.991 --> 01:18:57.893]  That the final phase is called the IMF riot.
[01:18:57.893 --> 01:19:00.034]  I mean, that's in their internal documents.
[01:19:00.034 --> 01:19:04.757]  They shut off liquidity, shut off the currency, let the nations implode.
[01:19:04.757 --> 01:19:06.718]  Then the public riots.
[01:19:06.718 --> 01:19:09.059]  The public will riot within three to four days.
[01:19:09.059 --> 01:19:13.161]  They've got Pentagon studies put out in the fifties on this.
[01:19:13.161 --> 01:19:16.723]  The American people will riot within three to four days.
[01:19:16.723 --> 01:19:19.204]  They will steal within three to four days.
[01:19:19.204 --> 01:19:22.126]  And every major study worldwide shows within ten to fifteen days
[01:19:23.314 --> 01:19:28.648]  Anyone, almost anyone, everyone will kill, will kill for food!
[01:19:31.255 --> 01:19:34.876]  Okay, now understand, this is... How are they gonna get us to accept martial law?
[01:19:34.876 --> 01:19:37.396]  How are they gonna sell us on accepting troops on the streets?
[01:19:37.396 --> 01:19:39.337]  They will implode the economy by design.
[01:19:39.337 --> 01:19:41.397]  How many years have I told you this?
[01:19:41.397 --> 01:19:47.539]  So then you beg for it, and then the troops come in to make sure that the depression continues.
[01:19:47.539 --> 01:19:49.959]  But they will believe they're actually trying to help.
[01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:52.019]  You understand how this is being orchestrated?
[01:19:52.019 --> 01:19:53.800]  Like a symphony orchestra of destruction?
[01:19:58.462 --> 01:20:02.544]  How would you like to save up to 90% on your phone bill?

[01:21:55.586 --> 01:21:57.227]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[01:21:57.227 --> 01:21:58.988]  December 15, 2008.
[01:21:58.988 --> 01:22:00.008]  Gold open this morning at $8.28.80.
[01:22:00.008 --> 01:22:04.430]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $8.53.54, $4.26.77 for the half ounce and $2.13.38 for a quarter ounce.
[01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.890]  That's $8.53.54, $4.26.77 and $2.13.38.
[01:22:12.734 --> 01:22:18.476]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[01:22:18.476 --> 01:22:22.818]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a Yan revolution.
[01:22:22.818 --> 01:22:30.941]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[01:22:30.941 --> 01:22:33.402]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[01:22:33.522 --> 01:22:37.404]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[01:22:37.404 --> 01:22:43.648]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[01:22:43.648 --> 01:22:47.070]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:50.172]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.

[01:23:44.299 --> 01:23:45.479]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:50.202]  By the way, we've called the California Highway Patrol and they admit that they are running checkpoints with the U.S.
[01:23:50.202 --> 01:23:51.322]  Marine Corps in California.
[01:24:10.410 --> 01:24:18.173]  Now the Marines, Friday, talked to the media, the blog and radio, and said, yeah, we are, but it's only for your safety.
[01:24:18.173 --> 01:24:22.694]  Now they're spinning it, saying, well, we're only looking for our own Marines at the checkpoints.
[01:24:22.694 --> 01:24:24.455]  And this is just training.
[01:24:24.455 --> 01:24:24.815]  Oh, really?
[01:24:24.815 --> 01:24:28.976]  That's what the Army Times says about the Army and the Marines to be used in America?
[01:24:28.976 --> 01:24:30.977]  And there's a new order out by...
[01:24:32.478 --> 01:24:38.701]  Secretary of Defense Gates and Barack Obama, saying it's going to be non-military, even non-police functions.
[01:24:38.701 --> 01:24:48.386]  It's going to be military, police, policing, and, quote, environmental issues and community issues, like helping at car wrecks, you see.
[01:24:48.386 --> 01:24:54.809]  Oh, we're here to give toys to the children, get used to us in our battle uniforms with our machine guns out.
[01:24:54.809 --> 01:24:58.431]  Oh, we're here to help at checkpoints and car wrecks.
[01:24:58.431 --> 01:25:00.212]  It's all part of the acclamation.
[01:25:02.677 --> 01:25:04.678]  But I want to state this clearly.
[01:25:04.678 --> 01:25:09.682]  We told the military, we told everybody this was being set up.
[01:25:09.682 --> 01:25:14.105]  The public laughed, the military said, yeah we know we're being trained for it, so what?
[01:25:14.105 --> 01:25:16.047]  Some individuals are against it.
[01:25:16.047 --> 01:25:17.348]  I would say the majority.
[01:25:17.348 --> 01:25:18.669]  But we have polls.
[01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:21.451]  But still they say they'll follow their orders.
[01:25:21.451 --> 01:25:24.333]  And the main training is to confiscate your guns.
[01:25:24.333 --> 01:25:26.154]  Once the rioting starts.
[01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:28.256]  Now again, they'll let the rioting go crazy.
[01:25:29.076 --> 01:25:34.639]  And then come in after the rioting's over and go door-to-door confiscating your guns, quote, securing the area.
[01:25:34.639 --> 01:25:43.083]  So those of you that stay in your houses or your farms or ranches, they're gonna come by a week later, a month later, six months later, and take your guns.
[01:25:43.083 --> 01:25:56.250]  And they'll make examples of a few farms and ranches and homes, they'll gun everybody down, burn the house down, like they did in New Orleans and other parts of the world, and then it'll be televised, and people will say, okay, I better show up and turn my gun in.
[01:25:57.569 --> 01:26:02.554]  But, uh, some people aren't going to go along with this and they will be called terrorists.
[01:26:02.554 --> 01:26:06.899]  Now, there's no debating that the military's been taken over by the foreign banks.
[01:26:06.899 --> 01:26:08.641]  There's no debating this is not our government.
[01:26:08.641 --> 01:26:15.468]  There's no debating that the banks have stolen 8.5 trillion and this is all completely illegitimate.
[01:26:15.468 --> 01:26:20.193]  There's no debating this is the ongoing march of the New World Order.
[01:26:21.918 --> 01:26:24.019]  And the government is completely illegitimate.
[01:26:24.019 --> 01:26:28.820]  Now remember, they're going to say, oh well we only put troops on the streets because of the rioting.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:31.461]  They spent decades secretly setting it up.
[01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:34.702]  And then in the last few years, not so secretly.
[01:26:34.702 --> 01:26:49.827]  But even when they admit they've built FEMA camps, even when they admit this is for the American people, even when it's admitted they've trained 26,000 preachers and 23,000 executives to be part of carrying out martial law and being spies, even when Obama says they're going to have a million man spy force,
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:55.923]  That Bill Clinton helped first set up and George Bush expanded and now Obama's making public.
[01:26:55.923 --> 01:27:03.307]  Even when they admit that, the people go on InfoWars.com and they say, you're a liar, none of this is true.
[01:27:03.307 --> 01:27:06.189]  They go on the media and they laugh at me and make fun of it.
[01:27:06.189 --> 01:27:14.114]  Even when hundreds of newspapers come out and say, yeah, it's world government, we're taking over, tyranny's good, freedom's bad, we want your guns.
[01:27:15.919 --> 01:27:17.741]  People say, it's not real.
[01:27:17.741 --> 01:27:18.101]  Not well.
[01:27:18.101 --> 01:27:19.162]  Let me tell you what's real.
[01:27:19.162 --> 01:27:22.345]  What's real is the 8.5 trillion they've stolen from your pension funds.
[01:27:22.345 --> 01:27:25.448]  That's why the average person's lost about 60% of their investments.
[01:27:27.452 --> 01:27:31.774]  And they told you your pension funds, your 401Ks were safe from a pack of criminals?
[01:27:31.774 --> 01:27:34.996]  I mean, they didn't set up all this martial law over the last couple of decades.
[01:27:34.996 --> 01:27:36.077]  They didn't gear all this up.
[01:27:36.077 --> 01:27:40.960]  They didn't stage terror attacks to scare you into accepting police state for nothing.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.761]  The police state is the means to the end.
[01:27:43.761 --> 01:27:46.363]  Total financial control.
[01:27:46.363 --> 01:27:48.124]  National ID cards.
[01:27:48.124 --> 01:27:50.245]  Showing ID cards to buy and sell.
[01:27:50.245 --> 01:27:51.906]  Face scans to buy and sell.
[01:27:51.906 --> 01:27:54.587]  And it's now all being announced.
[01:27:54.587 --> 01:27:55.448]  This is bondage.
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:02.346]  The Feds didn't start worldwide in every western country from New Zealand to the U.S.
[01:28:02.346 --> 01:28:11.315]  secretly taking blood 35 years ago, started the same year, 1973, taking blood secretly from every baby that was born.
[01:28:11.315 --> 01:28:15.119]  We told you about it 13 years ago, about 7 years ago we had a U.S.
[01:28:15.119 --> 01:28:18.443]  congressman on fighting it, now it's all over the news and they say, yeah,
[01:28:19.807 --> 01:28:27.113]  And they try to force mothers who know about it now to make them take the blood and sign a waiver because people are suing them over it.
[01:28:27.113 --> 01:28:30.115]  There's been a secret DNA database on you.
[01:28:30.115 --> 01:28:35.779]  That's how crooked and criminal the people are that have hijacked our government.
[01:28:35.779 --> 01:28:41.644]  And just because they hijacked the plane and put on the captain's outfit doesn't mean they're the captain.
[01:28:41.644 --> 01:28:46.828]  Be like if you came home and your wife wasn't there and there was some woman dressed up like her going, honey, it's me, it's me.
[01:28:48.559 --> 01:28:53.424]  And then most of the public just buy it and go, okay, well, I can't deal with the fact that my wife's gone.
[01:28:53.424 --> 01:28:57.468]  There's some woman here that looks a lot like her saying that she's my wife.
[01:28:57.468 --> 01:28:59.730]  I'll just go ahead and believe it's my wife.
[01:28:59.730 --> 01:29:01.773]  And your kids come home and say, that isn't mama.
[01:29:01.773 --> 01:29:04.415]  You say, shut up, you conspiracy theorist!
[01:29:04.415 --> 01:29:05.036]  Shut up!
[01:29:08.584 --> 01:29:11.605]  The denial has gotten us in this situation.
[01:29:11.605 --> 01:29:17.208]  A bristling military and paramilitary police force who are slitting their own throats.
[01:29:17.208 --> 01:29:21.830]  Who are there as a rearguard action to protect the system as they bring us down.
[01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:25.272]  Some of the other news, Google wants its own fast track on the web.
[01:29:25.272 --> 01:29:30.174]  That means Internet 2 shutting down the old web, Wall Street Journal.
[01:29:30.174 --> 01:29:32.655]  Police thwart Moscow rally, arrest 130 people for no reason.
[01:29:36.309 --> 01:29:37.110]  And a lot more.
[01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:40.936]  Dell launches U.S.-based voice contract services for a premium rate.
[01:29:40.936 --> 01:29:42.438]  You wanna talk to an American?
[01:29:42.438 --> 01:29:44.260]  You gotta pay $12.95x for a month.
[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:45.802]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:45.802 --> 01:29:47.184]  We're on the march.
[01:29:47.184 --> 01:29:49.728]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:49.728 --> 01:29:52.411]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.587 --> 01:29:58.348]  Hello, I'm Steve Shang.
[01:29:58.348 --> 01:30:05.312]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[01:30:05.312 --> 01:30:15.419]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing, and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[01:30:15.919 --> 01:30:16.880]  Well, snap out of it.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.361]  We now have a deadline.
[01:30:18.361 --> 01:30:20.402]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[01:30:20.402 --> 01:30:32.311]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[01:30:32.311 --> 01:30:37.976]  Well, I take the general at his word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[01:30:38.436 --> 01:30:43.884]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[01:30:43.884 --> 01:30:48.231]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[01:30:48.231 --> 01:30:49.433]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:55.919 --> 01:30:57.440]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:00.041]  The spirit of America is independence.
[01:31:00.041 --> 01:31:02.662]  The greatest gift of independence is food.
[01:31:02.662 --> 01:31:07.583]  Over one-third of Americans can't afford to buy food and pay their other expenses.
[01:31:07.583 --> 01:31:10.945]  Lines of credit and cards are often cut back or canceled.
[01:31:10.945 --> 01:31:17.467]  Last year, the eFoodsDirect Holiday Food Unit was a fun and exciting one-year supply with a great price.
[01:31:17.467 --> 01:31:24.530]  This year, to quickly complete our food supply preparations, eFoodsDirect has created a very serious holiday unit.
[01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:31.254]  This super food supply costs $300 less than the basic Liberty one-year supply and has more food.
[01:31:31.254 --> 01:31:35.177]  That's safe food for less than half the cost of last year's groceries.
[01:31:35.177 --> 01:31:39.640]  Gift certificates are available for shipments that will not arrive by Christmas.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:42.682]  Food is the gift of life and love this holiday season.
[01:31:42.682 --> 01:31:43.042]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:43.042 --> 01:31:44.383]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:44.383 --> 01:31:45.024]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:31:45.024 --> 01:31:45.304]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:31:55.651 --> 01:32:02.415]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:32:02.415 --> 01:32:05.057]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:32:05.057 --> 01:32:06.598]  But who is the enemy?
[01:32:06.598 --> 01:32:07.398]  Bin Laden.
[01:32:07.398 --> 01:32:08.339]  This is his MO.
[01:32:08.339 --> 01:32:09.780]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:11.741]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:32:11.741 --> 01:32:18.486]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:32:18.886 --> 01:32:19.387]  Some U.S.
[01:32:19.387 --> 01:32:25.732]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:32:25.732 --> 01:32:29.254]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:32:29.254 --> 01:32:39.723]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:32:39.723 --> 01:32:40.944]  Fabled Enemies.
[01:32:40.944 --> 01:32:47.569]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:48.690 --> 01:32:52.271]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:52.271 --> 01:32:57.493]  And San Bernardino County too.
[01:33:16.779 --> 01:33:25.146]  Alright, let me just preface this by saying, I woke up because I happened to stumble into Urban Warfare Drills in Texas.
[01:33:27.423 --> 01:33:33.587]  And then I traveled to Urban Warfare Drills in 96, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2001.
[01:33:33.587 --> 01:33:34.887]  I've been to more than 30.
[01:33:34.887 --> 01:33:38.670]  Listeners have sent me video from scores of other events.
[01:33:38.670 --> 01:33:41.291]  The Marines training to confiscate our guns.
[01:33:41.291 --> 01:33:43.252]  The Marines training to take over our cities.
[01:33:43.252 --> 01:33:44.773]  The Marines training.
[01:33:44.773 --> 01:33:52.518]  And then, in places like Swansboro, actually running checkpoints, helping police arrest people in Swansboro, North Carolina, on video!
[01:33:53.954 --> 01:34:00.319]  And I post these videos, I made films about it, and people thought I hired people and put them in fake uniforms.
[01:34:00.319 --> 01:34:11.507]  When I showed the Marines landing in San Diego, when I showed Marines landing in Oakland, California particularly, and practicing taking over the city, people thought it was fake!
[01:34:11.507 --> 01:34:19.933]  I mean, they thought I had the Coronado landing, and a Sea Cobra's landing, and a thousand Marines and foreign troops admitting it was for America.
[01:34:19.933 --> 01:34:21.395]  They couldn't believe it in Police State 2000.
[01:34:23.476 --> 01:34:29.340]  Friend, Rick Linklater, a director, laughed and said, man, that would cost 20 million bucks just to shoot one of those scenes.
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:31.962]  No, it was real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:31.962 --> 01:34:33.203]  Well, now it's all over the news.
[01:34:33.203 --> 01:34:37.106]  The Army Times says they want to put 20,000 combat troops on the streets of America.
[01:34:37.106 --> 01:34:39.687]  They've been quietly gearing up for this for a long time.
[01:34:39.687 --> 01:34:43.450]  They had Marines secretly dressed up in police uniforms in the late 80s.
[01:34:43.450 --> 01:34:45.431]  I have interviews with them.
[01:34:45.431 --> 01:34:47.793]  Busting down gun dealers' doors.
[01:34:47.793 --> 01:34:49.394]  That's in Road to Tyranny, the film I made in 2002.
[01:34:51.348 --> 01:34:57.953]  But now, all over the nation, we're getting reports of Marines at DUI checkpoints, aiding the police.
[01:34:57.953 --> 01:35:11.024]  And the big issue here is, they told KCDZ-FM in Joshua Tree, beautiful area of California, that the Highway Patrol said the Marines will not be there.
[01:35:11.024 --> 01:35:11.925]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:35:12.867 --> 01:35:15.169]  But people showed up and there were the Marines.
[01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:16.229]  We called the chips.
[01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:25.655]  They now admit that yes, the Marines are aiding them and observing them unless they're military personnel and then they're arresting them off base.
[01:35:25.655 --> 01:35:26.956]  So they're now spinning it.
[01:35:26.956 --> 01:35:29.778]  The Marines early on admitted they were doing this.
[01:35:29.778 --> 01:35:35.082]  Now they say, well, we're only observing and we have one of the Marine Corps spokesmen about this on tomorrow.
[01:35:35.902 --> 01:35:43.585]  The point is, this is to acclimate us, this is to condition us, and the bigger issue is the deceptiveness about all of this.
[01:35:43.585 --> 01:35:48.347]  The way this is being done, quietly to acclimate the public, but every time you confront them.
[01:35:48.347 --> 01:35:56.270]  I mean, I remember calling the Marines about Swansboro, and they just said, we weren't there, we didn't do that, that's not true.
[01:35:56.270 --> 01:36:03.973]  And it's the Marines, we have them training, and them being given orders, because some of the video was, well,
[01:36:04.815 --> 01:36:08.044]  Point is, let's go to our guest before we run out of time with him.
[01:36:08.044 --> 01:36:10.430]  He's Gary Dinew.
[01:36:12.401 --> 01:36:26.555]  And we appreciate Darien Dinho from KCDZ FM 1077 in Joshua Tree, California, who's been on top of this from day one.
[01:36:26.555 --> 01:36:34.142]  There's also been some great articles written on the local blogs, and of course, the curtain demo has also been a story at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:34.142 --> 01:36:35.844]  Gary, tell us exactly what's going on here.
[01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:58.415]  Well, what had happened is I'm the news director of a local radio station here in Joshua Tree, Alex, and we received a fax from the CHP last week on Wednesday announcing they were going to do a sobriety driver license checkpoint in the Yucca Valley area with the help of the United States Marine Corps, with the United States Military Police with them.
[01:36:59.085 --> 01:37:18.378]  Well, being somewhat familiar with Posse Comitatus, I contacted a constitutional lawyer out of Palm Springs who told me even the presence of marked military police units would give any civilian the reasonable expectation that the use of military force is imminent and violated the Posse Comitatus statutes, no question about it.
[01:37:18.378 --> 01:37:27.044]  So on Friday, the day of the checkpoint, we ran a very strong editorial questioning why military police are being used in a civilian enforcement action.
[01:37:27.617 --> 01:37:36.105]  Received another fax from the CHP at about 1130 that day which indicated the military had been pulled out of that checkpoint.
[01:37:36.105 --> 01:37:37.085]  But guess what?
[01:37:37.085 --> 01:37:51.778]  They had that checkpoint Friday night and marked military police units with uniformed marine military police were assisting in the checkpoint in the Yucca Valley Friday evening here in San Bernardino County.
[01:37:51.778 --> 01:37:52.499]  Were they armed?
[01:37:53.523 --> 01:37:54.444]  I do not know, sir.
[01:37:54.444 --> 01:37:56.125]  I was not there myself.
[01:37:56.125 --> 01:38:03.791]  However, two of my employees said they were uniformed Marines at the checkpoint, but they did not indicate to me whether they could tell they were armed or not.
[01:38:03.791 --> 01:38:07.694]  It's absolutely essential to find out if they were under arms, as you know.
[01:38:07.694 --> 01:38:18.002]  So being the news director there on KCDZFM website, KCDZFM.com, I would love it if you do another report with them.
[01:38:18.782 --> 01:38:23.386]  Perhaps with those employees as witnesses on air and then put it up on YouTube.
[01:38:23.386 --> 01:38:30.811]  Believe me, millions of people would want to hear that report because there's so much denial dealing with this.
[01:38:30.811 --> 01:38:33.392]  Well, the CHP did two things wrong, actually.
[01:38:33.392 --> 01:38:39.997]  In the initial sobriety driver's license checkpoint facts, they refused to indicate the location of the checkpoint.
[01:38:40.989 --> 01:38:49.898]  I know the Supreme Court has ruled on that as an entrapment operation, so we called them back and said, hey, you've got to tell us where this will be.
[01:38:49.898 --> 01:38:58.325]  They said, no, the law says we only have to tell you two hours ahead of time, so here's the phone number, call it at 7 p.m., and if you call at 7, it'll tell you where the checkpoint will be at night.
[01:38:58.325 --> 01:38:59.386]  Well, guess what?
[01:38:59.386 --> 01:39:04.331]  We called that number 10 times, between 7 and 830, and nobody ever answered.
[01:39:06.283 --> 01:39:14.505]  So not only did they bring the Marines in when they said they would not, but they did not indicate the location of their checkpoint, which they are supposed to do under the law.
[01:39:14.505 --> 01:39:17.606]  Okay, let's get this chain of events straight for everybody.
[01:39:17.606 --> 01:39:30.729]  They send out a press release, you report, your news talk station reports on the fact... It ran an editorial against using military force and civilian enforcement.
[01:39:30.729 --> 01:39:33.290]  Okay, and then they send out another release saying
[01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:35.672]  We're not doing that.
[01:39:35.672 --> 01:39:37.434]  Now, did they say we never said that?
[01:39:37.434 --> 01:39:39.276]  Or did they say now we're not doing that?
[01:39:39.276 --> 01:39:43.261]  Well, I have both faxes, so they can't say we never said that.
[01:39:43.261 --> 01:39:49.489]  The first press release said it was the CHP, the Sheriff's Department, and the United States Marine Corps Military Police.
[01:39:51.821 --> 01:39:56.564]  The second fact that they put out deletes the military police.
[01:39:56.564 --> 01:40:10.932]  It's the same facts, but they deleted the military police, leaving anyone reasonable to believe that the military police would not be involved, and perhaps they listened and paid attention to our editorial accusing them of violating posse comitatus.
[01:40:11.897 --> 01:40:13.619]  But as you say, it felt pretty sneaky.
[01:40:13.619 --> 01:40:17.763]  Not only were the Marines there also, but they never told us where it was going to be.
[01:40:17.763 --> 01:40:18.945]  Well, that's what the Marines do.
[01:40:18.945 --> 01:40:20.907]  Again, I'm not against the military culture.
[01:40:20.907 --> 01:40:25.131]  It's a necessary evil, and I will use that term throughout history.
[01:40:25.131 --> 01:40:26.693]  That's very, very dangerous.
[01:40:26.693 --> 01:40:27.134]  You know, people...
[01:40:28.416 --> 01:40:31.698]  Basically brainwashed, sleep deprivation, shaved heads.
[01:40:31.698 --> 01:40:34.719]  You know, you're now in an elite order.
[01:40:34.719 --> 01:40:38.521]  They have chants about, you know, killing commies for mommy.
[01:40:38.521 --> 01:40:41.083]  Now, they take them back from Iraq.
[01:40:41.083 --> 01:40:43.744]  They take the former military personnel.
[01:40:43.744 --> 01:40:44.965]  They put them into police units.
[01:40:45.585 --> 01:40:47.707]  Most of them have served two, three, four tours.
[01:40:47.707 --> 01:40:50.871]  They've got post-traumatic stress disorder.
[01:40:50.871 --> 01:40:54.875]  And then now, for decades, the police call us civilians.
[01:40:54.875 --> 01:40:57.157]  They teach them it's an us-against-them mentality.
[01:40:57.157 --> 01:41:04.144]  You don't use the military against the people because they are designed to fight enemies, kill people, and break things.
[01:41:05.305 --> 01:41:21.229]  Classic military terminology, classic military mindset, using deception, lying, not answering the phone, not following the law, not telling you where the checkpoint is, saying the Marines aren't going to be there, saying the Marines aren't going to be there.
[01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:25.229]  Again, military tactics against the American people, out of the gates.
[01:41:25.229 --> 01:41:31.811]  Anything else, sir, that your employees there at the talk station, news talk station, told you about what they saw at this checkpoint?
[01:41:32.091 --> 01:41:37.475]  Well, just that there's a very strong military presence there, because we had had a talk show Friday morning.
[01:41:37.475 --> 01:41:44.320]  I do a one-hour talk show at the radio station, and this is a military town, this, the 29 Palms Marine Corps Base.
[01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:47.540]  Is right next to where the radio station is located.
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:50.383]  There's 15,000 Marines out there, so it's very interesting.
[01:41:50.383 --> 01:42:02.292]  The talk show, most of the people agreed that, yeah, the Marines are concerned about their own with traffic laws, but on the other hand, they do not belong in a civilian enforcement operation.
[01:42:02.292 --> 01:42:13.822]  So even here in this military town, most of the listeners on the talk show agreed that this was an improper use of military force against the civilians in this area here in San Bernardino County.
[01:42:14.983 --> 01:42:42.428]  and of course it's all sold in the name of for everybody's safety uh... and well you're not for drunks are you did you see the army times report two months ago where they admitted first they said five thousand hours twenty thousand combat trips uh... from iraq and that they're gonna be doing p r not just dealing with insurgents and rioters for civil insurrection that's in the article sir it also states so so to pull up if you don't know it also states in there uh... that
[01:42:43.308 --> 01:42:49.076]  They're going to have the jaws of life out helping an auto accident, so that'll be the new PR.
[01:42:49.076 --> 01:42:53.181]  What, you're against the Army and Marines helping at car wrecks?
[01:42:53.181 --> 01:42:58.889]  Well, what we got from the CHP is that they were going to be there so if a military member was arrested,
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.802]  They could notify their command.
[01:43:01.802 --> 01:43:03.944]  Apparently, they don't know how to use telephones.
[01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:04.905]  That's their spin.
[01:43:04.905 --> 01:43:07.707]  I mean, that is... Look, sir, I've seen that a hundred times.
[01:43:07.707 --> 01:43:08.188]  Yeah.
[01:43:08.188 --> 01:43:12.992]  Whenever we've seen this other places, but it... But the news would never report on it for some reason.
[01:43:12.992 --> 01:43:14.973]  We would get video, our listeners would get video.
[01:43:14.973 --> 01:43:17.335]  They always say, oh, it was just a drill.
[01:43:17.335 --> 01:43:19.517]  Or we were just looking for some of our own people.
[01:43:19.517 --> 01:43:25.943]  We also questioned this with the military base, and a spokesman for the military base said they were just going along as observers.
[01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:31.753]  That they would not be involved in any hands-on arresting or hands-on with civilians.
[01:43:31.753 --> 01:43:37.836]  Again, my point being, even their presence constitutes a threat to civilian Americans.
[01:43:37.836 --> 01:43:42.098]  We don't need to see the military in our streets enforcing our laws.
[01:43:42.098 --> 01:43:52.883]  Bottom line, sir, though, you are aware that they've announced in CBS and the Washington Post that they are going to put regular troops on the streets of America?
[01:43:52.883 --> 01:43:54.424]  Yes, I have heard that report.
[01:43:55.450 --> 01:43:59.931]  I mean, my point is, I learned of this in 96 and no one wanted to believe me.
[01:43:59.931 --> 01:44:05.953]  And I'm telling you because you sound like you're an educated fellow and I certainly want you to educate yourself more and then warn the locals.
[01:44:05.953 --> 01:44:09.394]  Well, I mean, radio, Alex, I have to be educated.
[01:44:09.394 --> 01:44:11.175]  Absolutely, you gotta know all the news and the info.
[01:44:11.175 --> 01:44:11.755]  Well, you know what?
[01:44:11.755 --> 01:44:12.895]  You do stay on top of the news.
[01:44:12.895 --> 01:44:16.256]  I mean, I'm proud of people in news radio because you do have to stay up on it.
[01:44:16.256 --> 01:44:17.357]  We're a dying breed.
[01:44:17.357 --> 01:44:18.497]  There are a few of us out there.
[01:44:18.962 --> 01:44:20.883]  Well, all I can say is this.
[01:44:20.883 --> 01:44:38.829]  We commend you for standing up for the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the 1878 Posse Comitatus Law, and I would... Sir, can you, when we go to break and I let you go, can I give you our fax number, and can you fax me those two press releases from the CHIPS?
[01:44:39.614 --> 01:44:40.354]  I'll be happy to.
[01:44:40.354 --> 01:44:50.099]  I'll send you the first one when it says that the military police will be involved, and then the second one when they didn't mention the military police after we ran an editorial questioning their actions.
[01:44:50.745 --> 01:45:14.236]  Well, I hope my listeners, I know you guys are short-staffed and busy, I hope my listeners will tune in every morning when you're on to watch this as it unfolds, so that folks can then put that up on YouTube, the audio, so people all across the country can actually hear it for themselves, because there are people now, because some people are calling the Marines and the Chips, and the Marines and Chips are saying it never happened, and that we're basically crazy.
[01:45:14.236 --> 01:45:19.078]  Well, I'll be happy to send you a copy of the CHP press releases with their nice little logo on the top.
[01:45:20.788 --> 01:45:22.370]  Why do you think they're so deceptive?
[01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:28.595]  I mean, that's... I mean, it's not just creepy in Third World, you know, to have them announcing they're going to put troops on the streets.
[01:45:28.595 --> 01:45:32.058]  Well, I think they honestly believe they're doing it for the greater good.
[01:45:32.058 --> 01:45:35.361]  Up in our area, we do have a large marine base here.
[01:45:35.361 --> 01:45:36.803]  We do have a traffic problem.
[01:45:36.803 --> 01:45:40.066]  Marines and civilians are speeding and doing DUI.
[01:45:40.066 --> 01:45:46.592]  The general, the commanding general of this marine base just went to the Yucca Valley Town Council and used this quote, and I have this
[01:45:47.132 --> 01:45:48.813]  I have this tape if you'd like it.
[01:45:48.813 --> 01:45:52.254]  You take care of your idiots, and we'll take care of ours.
[01:45:52.254 --> 01:46:01.738]  And they're asking the civilian authorities to partner with the military authorities in keeping the speeds down, making the traffic more safe, making the highway more safe.
[01:46:01.738 --> 01:46:07.941]  So I believe the CHP thinks that they are cooperating with the local base by bringing the military into these civilian offices.
[01:46:07.941 --> 01:46:12.082]  But sir, there's always been problems with drunks in and off of bases and in any community.
[01:46:12.082 --> 01:46:13.163]  Why suddenly...
[01:46:13.863 --> 01:46:21.208]  I mean, what I'm telling you is there is a large, covert plan to merge the military and the police and use the military against the American people.
[01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:22.648]  It's now out in the open.
[01:46:22.648 --> 01:46:25.310]  And so, sure, the locals are being manipulated.
[01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:26.511]  I'm sure even the commander of the base.
[01:46:26.511 --> 01:46:34.716]  But do you remember in the mid-90s, the 29 Palms survey that got national attention in the Wall Street Journal and other places about would they fire on U.S.
[01:46:34.716 --> 01:46:35.396]  citizens?
[01:46:35.396 --> 01:46:36.477]  Would they confiscate guns?
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:39.862]  I am not familiar with that survey, sir.
[01:46:39.862 --> 01:46:41.143]  You can read it.
[01:46:41.143 --> 01:46:43.144]  29 Palms, Marine Corps study.
[01:46:43.144 --> 01:46:45.846]  Believe me, this is part of something bigger, my friend.
[01:46:45.846 --> 01:46:48.248]  I mean, why would they be deceptive about it?
[01:46:48.248 --> 01:46:56.194]  No, and that's what bothered me the most, because I have a very good relationship with the CHP, and they change their stories in the middle of the stream.
[01:46:56.194 --> 01:46:57.455]  I was quite surprised with that.
[01:46:57.455 --> 01:46:59.317]  Well, that's because they know it's a felony.
[01:46:59.317 --> 01:47:03.520]  Yeah, we're running another story today questioning those actions.
[01:47:04.474 --> 01:47:05.876]  We have not heard from them yet.
[01:47:05.876 --> 01:47:09.241]  What time is that going to be running so folks can tune in?
[01:47:09.241 --> 01:47:20.136]  Well, that'll run again at noon, 4, 5, and 6 in our local news, but if you can't pick up the radio station, we do have audio on the air at our website, and can I give that website?
[01:47:20.276 --> 01:47:32.125]  Yes, it's KCDZFM.com and there's also a transcript of the editorial we ran on Friday, the audio of the news we're running today questioning the CHP's actions.
[01:47:32.125 --> 01:47:35.707]  And that's in the news section of KCDZFM.com?
[01:47:35.707 --> 01:47:36.528]  That is correct, sir.
[01:47:38.991 --> 01:47:42.272]  And you guys are audio streaming, or are you just posting the reports?
[01:47:42.272 --> 01:47:43.232]  We are not audio streaming.
[01:47:43.232 --> 01:47:46.553]  We're audio streaming the news and posting transcripts.
[01:47:46.553 --> 01:47:48.854]  So we have both audio of the news and transcripts.
[01:47:48.854 --> 01:47:53.675]  We don't stream the station, but we do stream our news, because we own the copyright on that.
[01:47:53.675 --> 01:47:55.636]  No, no, that's good.
[01:47:55.636 --> 01:48:00.077]  I just want folks to be able to tune in and hear it for themselves, because they can.
[01:48:00.077 --> 01:48:01.057]  It's posted right now.
[01:48:01.277 --> 01:48:14.542]  Well, there's so much denial about this because people instinctively know it's third world, it's communist China, communist Russia, Nazi Germany, they have troops on the streets, and now it's happening and people just don't want to believe it.
[01:48:14.542 --> 01:48:19.144]  Right here in beautiful downtown Joshua Tree, California.
[01:48:19.144 --> 01:48:21.925]  What percentage of the people in your town are upset by this?
[01:48:21.925 --> 01:48:23.826]  I mean, how are the calls running?
[01:48:24.813 --> 01:48:42.522]  Well, calls were running about 80-20, 80% who were unhappy with it, were upset with it, and 20% because this is a military town, or just blind loyalty to anything the Marines do, and how dare you question anything the Marines want to do in this Marine town?
[01:48:42.522 --> 01:48:43.443]  Unbelievable.
[01:48:43.443 --> 01:48:47.325]  You know, I don't even have to move to Mexico now to live in a place like Mexico with troops on the streets.
[01:48:47.325 --> 01:48:48.566]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:48:48.566 --> 01:48:50.827]  They had troops on the streets at Yucca Valley Friday night.
[01:48:51.972 --> 01:48:54.855]  Now, they said they're doing this through the 12th through Christmas.
[01:48:54.855 --> 01:48:59.219]  Have they suspended it, or can people go out there and catch them any night of the week doing this now?
[01:48:59.219 --> 01:49:10.690]  Well, they told us they're doing the 12th through the 30th, but they have not announced any other locations, and that date of 12th through 30th is through the entire San Bernardino County, which is the largest county in the country.
[01:49:10.690 --> 01:49:13.153]  As a matter of fact, it is as big as three eastern states.
[01:49:13.883 --> 01:49:17.105]  So you're just driving through the desert and you run into Marines at a checkpoint with the police.
[01:49:17.105 --> 01:49:17.406]  Sir, can you
[01:49:35.262 --> 01:49:37.383]  I know you're busy as the news manager there.
[01:49:37.383 --> 01:49:44.848]  Can you go talk to those two employees so I can call you back and just find out, my writer, specifically if they had guns?
[01:49:44.848 --> 01:49:51.072]  Yeah, they will not arrive to work until late this afternoon, but I will call them and I will call your producer back.
[01:49:51.072 --> 01:49:53.753]  I will talk to them and call your producer back later on.
[01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:57.416]  Well, I tell you, if they had, and I wish somebody would have gotten footage of this.
[01:49:57.416 --> 01:49:59.097]  I mean, I've gotten footage over and over again.
[01:49:59.097 --> 01:50:00.438]  People still deny it, so...
[01:50:02.881 --> 01:50:07.925]  I mean, is that spooky, though, to know that there's been a long-term covert operation to do this?
[01:50:07.925 --> 01:50:08.966]  Uh, yes.
[01:50:08.966 --> 01:50:18.554]  Uh, this is the first I've heard there's a long-term covert operation, but I did indeed know that military were involved in the checkpoint Friday night in Yucca Valley.
[01:50:18.554 --> 01:50:20.495]  Where specifically was that checkpoint?
[01:50:20.495 --> 01:50:26.340]  Right in front of Home Depot on State Route 62, the main highway through the community.
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:32.405]  Well, we need our listeners all over California to go up there, even if you have to travel, and just, uh... In fact,
[01:50:34.590 --> 01:50:40.938]  $1,000 prize and this goes for your station whoever gets me video of that and gets it to me $1,000 prize for that.
[01:50:40.938 --> 01:50:41.939]  How's that?
[01:50:41.939 --> 01:50:43.260]  How's that sound Gary?
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:45.323]  Well, we'll see if anybody got any video of it Alex
[01:50:46.445 --> 01:50:48.346]  And it's Gary Dinio, correct sir?
[01:50:48.346 --> 01:50:49.407]  That is correct.
[01:50:49.407 --> 01:50:53.009]  Well, we really appreciate you joining us, and as this unfolds, perhaps we'll have you back on.
[01:50:53.009 --> 01:50:54.570]  No problem, sir.
[01:50:54.570 --> 01:50:54.950]  Thank you.
[01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:56.051]  I'm going to talk to you when we get a break.
[01:50:56.051 --> 01:51:01.014]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[01:51:01.014 --> 01:51:07.318]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free, and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.

[01:51:31.262 --> 01:51:39.147]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[01:51:39.147 --> 01:51:45.932]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[01:51:46.753 --> 01:51:48.134]  So don't delay.
[01:51:48.134 --> 01:51:48.834]  Call today.
[01:51:48.834 --> 01:51:55.458]  908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you.
[01:51:55.458 --> 01:51:58.199]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[01:51:58.199 --> 01:52:00.821]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:52:00.821 --> 01:52:02.962]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:52:02.962 --> 01:52:04.483]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:04.483 --> 01:52:06.204]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:06.204 --> 01:52:09.085]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:09.085 --> 01:52:13.848]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:52:13.848 --> 01:52:14.828]  Listen up.
[01:52:14.828 --> 01:52:15.228]  Shut up.
[01:52:17.808 --> 01:52:22.369]  It's the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:52:22.369 --> 01:52:28.250]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:31.031]  An inside job?
[01:52:31.031 --> 01:52:35.132]  How dare you?
[01:52:35.132 --> 01:52:38.712]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:38.712 --> 01:52:41.433]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:41.433 --> 01:52:46.654]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[01:52:46.934 --> 01:52:47.915]  Truth Rising.
[01:52:47.915 --> 01:52:50.737]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:52:50.737 --> 01:52:53.019]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:52:53.019 --> 01:52:55.981]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:52:55.981 --> 01:53:01.306]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[01:53:03.067 --> 01:53:16.173]  Ionic Zone Shock Treatment Ozone Generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of second-hand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[01:53:16.173 --> 01:53:19.715]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[01:53:19.715 --> 01:53:24.197]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[01:53:24.377 --> 01:53:24.537]  I think.
[01:53:39.514 --> 01:53:42.497]  Come, you masters of war Here to build the big guns
[01:54:09.812 --> 01:54:18.484]  Throughout history, it's always the military and police used to enforce tyranny.
[01:54:18.484 --> 01:54:20.627]  98% of the time, 99% of the time.
[01:54:20.627 --> 01:54:23.631]  They are tyrannical, they are abusive, they are evil.
[01:54:24.834 --> 01:54:32.660]  Throughout history, they're the ones that take the bank accounts, the farms, the ranches.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:38.664]  They're the ones that evil in government, that private corporate interests use to enslave the people.
[01:54:38.664 --> 01:54:44.388]  From Julius Caesar's time to Adolf Hitler's time.
[01:54:44.388 --> 01:54:46.650]  Look at Rome, a great republic.
[01:54:46.650 --> 01:54:50.332]  Greater in its time than the United States is today, per capita.
[01:54:50.332 --> 01:54:52.033]  And now you see what happened to them.
[01:54:54.468 --> 01:54:57.870]  Powerful interests say, hey, we've got control of the military.
[01:54:57.870 --> 01:55:03.994]  Let's use a pretext, terrorism, environmentalism, whatever the case may be, to take over.
[01:55:03.994 --> 01:55:07.276]  And they have a huge covert secret operation.
[01:55:07.276 --> 01:55:10.718]  Now it's not secret anymore and they will lie to you.
[01:55:10.718 --> 01:55:13.299]  They will say anything to you.
[01:55:13.299 --> 01:55:18.902]  You can call up the Highway Patrol and they'll say, no such thing is going on here.
[01:55:18.902 --> 01:55:21.304]  And you call another day and they go, well, they are helping.
[01:55:23.561 --> 01:55:28.524]  Then you call another day and they say, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:55:28.524 --> 01:55:30.365]  It's all about deception.
[01:55:30.365 --> 01:55:34.907]  I mean, take the police crime labs in New York and LA and Houston and Dallas.
[01:55:34.907 --> 01:55:42.151]  I mean, just type in crime lab caught in fraud, or crime lab caught framing, or crime lab shut down.
[01:55:42.151 --> 01:55:45.693]  And they don't just frame a few people, they frame whoever they want.
[01:55:46.792 --> 01:55:49.194]  And the federal courts are even worse.
[01:55:49.194 --> 01:55:52.597]  The country is completely bankrupt and run by criminals.
[01:55:52.597 --> 01:56:00.765]  With a bunch of do-gooders going, well, I think we need the Marines in America.
[01:56:00.765 --> 01:56:04.088]  I think we need to be like Baghdad with checkpoints.
[01:56:04.088 --> 01:56:09.573]  And then notice they magically start doing IED, improvised explosive device training.
[01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:18.964]  Notice they start in the last two years training every police department to prepare for bombs.
[01:56:18.964 --> 01:56:22.246]  To prepare for bombs on the side of the road and bombs at businesses.
[01:56:22.246 --> 01:56:25.288]  And then magically there's a bombing in Kansas.
[01:56:25.288 --> 01:56:34.634]  Magically there's a bombing Friday afternoon in Oregon killing two police.
[01:56:34.634 --> 01:56:40.978]  The bomb disposal technician and a police officer injuring the police chief.
[01:56:42.737 --> 01:56:50.882]  And there was one decoy bomb to train him to not handle the other one more carefully and then they went to the real bomb.
[01:56:50.882 --> 01:56:53.643]  Now that was a mind that came up with that.
[01:56:53.643 --> 01:56:56.805]  And I bet my bottom dollar that's a Fed.
[01:56:56.805 --> 01:57:03.409]  Or it was Feds supplying the bomb to some mental patient white supremacist.
[01:57:03.409 --> 01:57:10.673]  And you watch when they catch the white supremacist, they're going to be in former military who had been in a government psychiatric facility.
[01:57:12.881 --> 01:57:13.821]  What does Northwood say?
[01:57:13.821 --> 01:57:21.285]  It says we'll plant bombs in banks and businesses, we'll shoot people on the streets, and then we'll grab patsies.
[01:57:21.285 --> 01:57:28.608]  And then we learn the patsies are former military and mental institutions.
[01:57:28.608 --> 01:57:32.110]  As long as the person can't defend themselves, he's just a muttering idiot.
[01:57:32.110 --> 01:57:34.751]  He'll have swastikas all over him, shaved head.
[01:57:34.751 --> 01:57:36.472]  It'll come out that an FBI informant
[01:57:37.779 --> 01:57:47.102]  Went and found the guy, or an FBI agent went and found the guy, gave him the bomb, gave him everything, and then they called those cops in to kill him.
[01:57:47.102 --> 01:57:48.003]  And the cops won't care!
[01:57:48.003 --> 01:57:51.344]  They'll be like, well, at least we get to hate the American people.
[01:57:51.344 --> 01:57:53.765]  Eh, so the FBI bombed us.
[01:57:53.765 --> 01:57:57.286]  Doesn't matter, they had to do it to stop white supremacists.
[01:57:57.286 --> 01:58:03.368]  Then Obama can get up and talk about how there's all these racists out there, and we gotta, we gotta have spies spying on people.
[01:58:03.368 --> 01:58:04.949]  You're gonna see lots of bombings.
[01:58:05.976 --> 01:58:12.321]  Lots of bombings, and then the Feds have only got a stage 10, 15, 20 little bombings, and then copycats are going to pick up.
[01:58:12.321 --> 01:58:17.826]  See, the Feds are trying to trigger, and I've seen this a million times, folks, I know what I'm looking at.
[01:58:17.826 --> 01:58:24.712]  95% chance this is a government bombing, 100% chance it's provocateur.
[01:58:24.712 --> 01:58:26.894]  Or I'd say 99.
[01:58:26.894 --> 01:58:29.836]  Because of everything surrounding it.
[01:58:29.836 --> 01:58:33.199]  And then, see, they want to cause the public to really start fighting them.
[01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:40.570]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:40.570 --> 01:58:46.254]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:46.254 --> 01:58:49.476]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:58:49.476 --> 01:58:52.958]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:52.958 --> 01:58:55.599]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:55.599 --> 01:58:57.140]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:57.941]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:57.941 --> 01:58:58.761]  This is his ammo.
[01:58:58.761 --> 01:59:00.302]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:59:00.302 --> 01:59:01.863]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:02.283 --> 01:59:09.429]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:09.429 --> 01:59:09.929]  Some U.S.
[01:59:09.929 --> 01:59:16.274]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:16.274 --> 01:59:19.717]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:19.997 --> 01:59:30.245]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much much more.
[01:59:30.245 --> 01:59:31.486]  Fabled enemies.
[01:59:31.486 --> 01:59:39.232]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:39.232 --> 01:59:42.595]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:48.362 --> 01:59:50.765]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:50.765 --> 01:59:53.509]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:56.738 --> 02:00:01.583]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:01.583 --> 02:00:03.164]  You want answers?
[02:00:03.164 --> 02:00:04.726]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:04.726 --> 02:00:08.910]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:08.910 --> 02:00:12.994]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.089 --> 02:00:40.734]  We got one of the most prolific and successful online video directors joining us, enough respect.
[02:00:40.734 --> 02:00:44.156]  Had him on for about 15 minutes.
[02:00:44.156 --> 02:00:46.157]  John Watkins, his name, from Cardiff, England.
[02:00:46.997 --> 02:00:54.982]  And I want to have him up for most of an hour because I want to not just get into the censorship he's under or what Google or YouTube are announcing to censor.
[02:00:54.982 --> 02:00:59.906]  I wanted to get into overall the way they're going to shut down and kill the web.
[02:00:59.906 --> 02:01:04.509]  Now listen, everybody's emailing me right now saying, Alex, you were right again.
[02:01:04.509 --> 02:01:05.990]  How did you know?
[02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:08.351]  And people are saying he must be an agent.
[02:01:08.351 --> 02:01:11.253]  How does he always know how they're going to attack?
[02:01:11.253 --> 02:01:13.074]  What they're going to do?
[02:01:13.074 --> 02:01:13.875]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:01:14.901 --> 02:01:33.722]  It's like I say, if I read the TV Guide and it's Monday night, and it tells me Monday night football's coming on at this time and this station, and I tell my buddies, hey, let's go watch the game at the local bar, you know, hypothetically, they don't pat me on the back and say I'm a genius.
[02:01:33.722 --> 02:01:36.125]  That's what's so frustrating about all of this!
[02:01:37.818 --> 02:01:40.919]  They've announced they're shutting the web down.
[02:01:40.919 --> 02:01:43.320]  They've announced how they're going to do it.
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.581]  I told you five years ago when they announced it.
[02:01:45.581 --> 02:01:49.183]  They really announced it seven, eight years ago in 2000.
[02:01:49.183 --> 02:01:55.425]  I learned about it in 2002, 2003.
[02:01:55.425 --> 02:02:03.689]  I mean, I knew they had ways to censor, ways to filter, but I didn't know about InternetTube until about 2002.
[02:02:05.649 --> 02:02:23.116]  And then I sat there for hours reading their public statements and their plan with the governments of China, Japan, Europe, Russia, the United States, and they are going to shut the web down and they told us how they're going to do it!
[02:02:24.184 --> 02:02:25.625]  And they even wrote articles about it!
[02:02:25.625 --> 02:02:28.167]  It's even been in the news!
[02:02:28.167 --> 02:02:32.309]  And then I can't get the public to believe me.
[02:02:32.309 --> 02:02:49.440]  I do videos, I post the articles, I put it on the web, and I'll go look at the YouTube comments and you know there'll be a hundred thousand people, or two hundred or three hundred thousand in the case of Enough Respect video that have watched it, and half the comments are, he's a big liar, he's a government agent lying to us!
[02:02:50.785 --> 02:03:00.189]  Instead of, regardless of who I am, if you haven't noticed I'm a good guy, with the track record, why don't you at least address what I'm saying?
[02:03:00.189 --> 02:03:05.991]  It's like the last hour with the Marines lying about running checkpoints.
[02:03:05.991 --> 02:03:07.231]  We got one of them coming on tomorrow.
[02:03:07.231 --> 02:03:09.612]  They think they're going to acclimate the enemy.
[02:03:09.612 --> 02:03:15.414]  They think they're going to come on here and, you know, talk down to us slaves and it's going to fool us.
[02:03:15.414 --> 02:03:17.115]  We know you're here to win a victory.
[02:03:17.115 --> 02:03:18.315]  We understand that.
[02:03:18.315 --> 02:03:20.076]  We understand we've been designated the enemy.
[02:03:21.087 --> 02:03:25.289]  We're giving you a chance to come over and join the American people instead of being traitors.
[02:03:25.289 --> 02:03:27.249]  And I'm tired of your crap.
[02:03:27.249 --> 02:03:35.472]  I'm tired of them lying to my face when I know exactly what they're up to!
[02:03:35.472 --> 02:03:37.013]  I'm sick of it!
[02:03:37.013 --> 02:03:41.555]  They built FEMA camps, they're coming after your guns, they're gonna shut the web down!
[02:03:41.555 --> 02:03:44.736]  You got me?
[02:03:44.736 --> 02:03:50.818]  And if you just get angry, and if you just stop being children and living in denial about what's happening,
[02:03:52.529 --> 02:03:58.254]  We could turn this around, and they wouldn't be able to... Now, they've already stolen 60% of the pension funds.
[02:03:58.254 --> 02:04:00.896]  In a couple months, it's all gonna be gone, dumbasses.
[02:04:00.896 --> 02:04:01.537]  Excuse me.
[02:04:01.537 --> 02:04:02.638]  Excuse me, I'm sorry.
[02:04:02.638 --> 02:04:04.659]  I'm talking to those out there that don't believe me.
[02:04:04.659 --> 02:04:08.963]  It's all gonna be too late, you stupid freaks!
[02:04:08.963 --> 02:04:14.708]  It's not too late to take the government back and arrest these people and get our money back!
[02:04:14.708 --> 02:04:19.612]  The United States is being blown out financially, and they're gonna come in and suppress us militarily afterward.
[02:04:21.124 --> 02:04:24.067]  Now do you care about this?
[02:04:24.067 --> 02:04:26.109]  Do you want to try to stop this?
[02:04:26.109 --> 02:04:32.715]  Or do you want to continue to allow them to use military psychology on you, telling you this is not an assault, when it is an assault!
[02:04:34.972 --> 02:04:40.295]  I want to tell the troops and the government, anybody else involved in this takeover, you are treasonous traitors.
[02:04:40.295 --> 02:04:41.475]  There's no doubting it.
[02:04:41.475 --> 02:04:43.756]  Your bosses are openly stealing us blind.
[02:04:43.756 --> 02:04:44.997]  You're openly criminal.
[02:04:44.997 --> 02:04:46.618]  You openly push torture.
[02:04:46.618 --> 02:04:51.080]  You are a disgrace to this country and the American flag and you are enemies of this country!
[02:04:52.588 --> 02:04:56.451]  When you're out driving this holiday season, keep in mind you're being watched.
[02:04:56.451 --> 02:05:02.975]  Whether you know it or not, red light and speed cameras are everywhere ready to snap a photo of your license plate.
[02:05:02.975 --> 02:05:09.880]  One simple, harmless error could end up costing you over $500, quickly putting an end to your holiday cheer.
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:11.761]  Fight back with Photoblocker.
[02:05:11.761 --> 02:05:14.483]  Simply spray your plate once and you're done.
[02:05:14.483 --> 02:05:18.986]  Any photos of your license plate will appear overexposed, making them virtually unreadable.
[02:05:19.346 --> 02:05:23.709]  See the newscast showing just how Photoblocker works against traffic cameras.
[02:05:23.709 --> 02:05:33.036]  Christmas is here and the economy is in bad enough shape without spending hundreds of dollars in fees that can be avoided with one simple application of Photoblocker.

[02:05:48.107 --> 02:05:52.451]  Spray your plate, and when the cameras flash, you'll save some cash.
[02:05:52.451 --> 02:05:54.412]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:05:54.412 --> 02:05:58.035]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:05:58.035 --> 02:06:00.477]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:06:00.477 --> 02:06:03.519]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:06:03.519 --> 02:06:09.264]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:06:09.264 --> 02:06:13.187]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:07:52.591 --> 02:08:00.235]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:00.235 --> 02:08:06.578]  I briefly just want to make it clear.
[02:08:06.578 --> 02:08:15.362]  The foreign banks, in their own documents that we've posted and written about and had guests on covering, like the former Chief Economist of the World Bank,
[02:08:17.623 --> 02:08:20.710]  Come in and destroy economies by design.
[02:08:20.710 --> 02:08:26.484]  As things begin falling apart, they come in and tell the government, give us unlimited power if they didn't already have it.
[02:08:28.476 --> 02:08:30.896]  And we will fix the financial situation.
[02:08:30.896 --> 02:08:37.098]  They then completely destroy the nation, down to pennies on the dollar with the value of the stock market and savings.
[02:08:37.098 --> 02:08:39.358]  They steal all the pension funds.
[02:08:39.358 --> 02:08:50.540]  And then, the IMF and World Bank put in private intelligence groups, and sometimes use CIA and others, this is mainstream news now, to monitor the public.
[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:53.741]  The public won't riot over having their pension funds taken.
[02:08:55.095 --> 02:09:15.255]  uh... by then they've already privatized the water and the roads and they slap up toll roads overnight or they just shut roads they triple or quadruple the price of water and natural gas and then they sit back and watch the riots start and then once the riots start the people feel real good burning and stealing and attacking
[02:09:16.826 --> 02:09:26.009]  For a few weeks or even months, then everybody's demoralized, everything's destroyed, then they come in and even hammer the depression harder.
[02:09:26.009 --> 02:09:36.573]  And then put in a new puppet government who always blames the last government and says it's your fault for rioting, that you screwed everything up, and they call that the IMF riot.
[02:09:36.573 --> 02:09:39.634]  Now, I've been talking about this since 2002, since I learned about it.
[02:09:41.437 --> 02:09:46.921]  I learned in history, even in college, how the Marines would be sent into third world countries and the U.S.
[02:09:46.921 --> 02:09:52.564]  would do the same thing there that they've done in modern times.
[02:09:52.564 --> 02:09:56.467]  And then Smedley Butler talked about how he was a bag man for the bankers.
[02:09:56.467 --> 02:09:58.688]  You know, two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner.
[02:09:58.688 --> 02:10:02.971]  He was about to be Marine Corps Commandant, most highly decorated Marine.
[02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:12.632]  In Marine Corps history, I'm sure the Marines will urinate all over him and call him evil and call him a terrorist traitor because he isn't for destroying America now.
[02:10:12.632 --> 02:10:16.373]  Certainly the leadership and those that I've talked to, a lot of Marines are good and hate it.
[02:10:16.373 --> 02:10:17.214]  A lot of them love it.
[02:10:17.214 --> 02:10:18.554]  I mean, they love this evil.
[02:10:18.554 --> 02:10:27.197]  They're on the website with their own handles on InfoWars, link back to their MySpace, saying, I want to kick your teeth in, I can't wait to kill you.
[02:10:27.197 --> 02:10:30.178]  And you think it's a joke and you go to their MySpace and they're in their uniform.
[02:10:30.178 --> 02:10:31.399]  They want to kill Americans.
[02:10:32.199 --> 02:10:34.721]  They're just, it's just total evil has taken over them.
[02:10:34.721 --> 02:10:36.242]  I mean, they are total killers.
[02:10:36.242 --> 02:10:38.624]  Past the point of what they were 20, 30 years ago.
[02:10:38.624 --> 02:10:53.395]  Now, a lot of them are upset about what's happening, but to make a long story short here, Smedley Butler, uh, went along with all this and then they finally approached him and said, we're going to make you basically military dictator over the military.
[02:10:54.939 --> 02:10:58.082]  Under Prescott Bush and the Harrimans.
[02:10:58.082 --> 02:11:00.124]  And we want you to overthrow the United States.
[02:11:00.124 --> 02:11:04.627]  We've got a secret program with police chiefs that want to work with you and the Army.
[02:11:04.627 --> 02:11:10.932]  We want you to lead a group of 500,000 men with the Army.
[02:11:10.932 --> 02:11:13.094]  Most of them are police and former military.
[02:11:13.094 --> 02:11:14.395]  We've got a network.
[02:11:14.395 --> 02:11:15.596]  We're going to overthrow the U.S.
[02:11:15.596 --> 02:11:17.798]  and set up a fascist dictatorship.
[02:11:17.798 --> 02:11:21.721]  And you're going to be like Heinrich Himmler.
[02:11:21.721 --> 02:11:23.283]  And he said, oh yeah, I like that plan.
[02:11:24.076 --> 02:11:29.762]  And he went and went to their meetings and was given all the documents, then he went and blew the whistle and they got arrested.
[02:11:29.762 --> 02:11:30.263]  Some of them did.
[02:11:30.263 --> 02:11:33.206]  Some of them were too powerful to arrest, so they just couldn't bring it out in the media.
[02:11:33.206 --> 02:11:38.471]  And they had congressional hearings in the late 40s, early 50s, McCormick-Dickstein Committee.
[02:11:38.471 --> 02:11:40.433]  I have some of that in my film, Endgame.
[02:11:40.433 --> 02:11:43.316]  The point is, they always use the Marines.
[02:11:43.316 --> 02:11:44.417]  That's what the Marines do.
[02:11:44.417 --> 02:11:45.579]  They take over countries.
[02:11:46.824 --> 02:11:48.947]  And they take over third world nations.
[02:11:48.947 --> 02:11:50.469]  They're a pocket army.
[02:11:50.469 --> 02:11:54.033]  They're a rapid reaction shock troops.
[02:11:54.033 --> 02:11:54.914]  And that's their use.
[02:11:56.314 --> 02:11:59.495]  Now, I'm not attacking John Paul Jones and the Revolutionary Forefathers.
[02:11:59.495 --> 02:12:09.597]  I'm not attacking the Marine Corps and going down to Mexico and kicking the butt of, you know, their leadership down there, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.
[02:12:09.597 --> 02:12:17.058]  But there's no doubt, since the 30s, it has been total New World Order, and Smedley Butler wrote a book about it, War is a Racket.
[02:12:17.058 --> 02:12:23.860]  And so, they're going to implode the economy by design, as I've been telling you for a decade, and then bring in troops as the, quote, saviors.
[02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:25.340]  This is all a setup.
[02:12:26.431 --> 02:12:32.752]  And the troops are destroying their own futures.
[02:12:32.752 --> 02:12:41.454]  By the way, we've gotten the press release from the CHIPS in California, the Highway Patrol, that they are using Marines at checkpoints.
[02:12:41.454 --> 02:12:45.474]  And we have the later press release denying it.
[02:12:45.474 --> 02:12:48.695]  And then they lied and the Marines were on the streets.
[02:12:48.695 --> 02:12:54.476]  There's a $1,000 reward for footage of Marines at checkpoints anywhere in the United States.
[02:12:59.827 --> 02:13:06.213]  And then if I get a bunch of video from different people, the next best will get 500 and then the next five winners will get 500 apiece.
[02:13:06.213 --> 02:13:10.016]  I'd love to give you more, I just don't have the money.
[02:13:10.016 --> 02:13:15.121]  And even when we get the footage and even when we get local newscasts, the public will still say there's no Marines.
[02:13:15.121 --> 02:13:19.065]  As the Marines take their guns out of their homes, they will say there are no Marines.
[02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:25.801]  As their child dies of cancer from the GMO crops, they will say there is no GMO, there is no cancer.
[02:13:25.801 --> 02:13:30.443]  I mean, it's just a nation of jellyfish that have allowed this to happen.
[02:13:30.443 --> 02:13:32.743]  Alright, I've said enough on that front.
[02:13:32.743 --> 02:13:35.844]  Let's shift gears into internet censorship.
[02:13:35.844 --> 02:13:37.444]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal today.
[02:13:37.444 --> 02:13:40.145]  Google wants its own fast track on the web.
[02:13:40.145 --> 02:13:43.326]  Then you read the article and it admits that it's going to shut down the old web
[02:13:44.199 --> 02:13:48.741]  And it'll crawl, if it even works, no more net neutrality.
[02:13:48.741 --> 02:13:55.264]  The old web is being allowed to fall apart and die, as Internet2 said six years ago, the big international consortium.
[02:13:55.264 --> 02:14:06.409]  And then Google and a handful of other big IT giants, they will be the web of the future, with only a few thousand mainstream news websites and video sites.
[02:14:06.409 --> 02:14:09.370]  Then you say, well I'll just go on YouTube and Google and upload my stuff there.
[02:14:09.370 --> 02:14:10.050]  No.
[02:14:10.050 --> 02:14:13.332]  Google has now announced Friday, the register reported on it out of England,
[02:14:14.281 --> 02:14:24.805]  That they are going to censor whatever they want, whenever they want, and they are now going to hand-select who gets to be in the search rankings, and you're basically going to have to pay them to be in their search rankings.
[02:14:24.805 --> 02:14:29.667]  And I've suddenly noticed, because I'm always studying it, suddenly most of my stuff is gone.
[02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:45.243]  Most of my videos, most of the articles, articles I've written that we've published years ago, six months ago, before they'd be top of the web, top of Google, because whatever gets the most hits goes to the top under the fair system they had that made them number one.
[02:14:45.243 --> 02:14:46.083]  Not anymore.
[02:14:46.083 --> 02:14:48.104]  They've knocked us out everywhere.
[02:14:48.104 --> 02:14:52.004]  Now we're still growing despite that, but we're not reaching as many new people.
[02:14:52.004 --> 02:14:59.106]  That's why you've got to go to other websites, chat rooms, MySpace, YouTube, Google, and hundreds of others while you still can.
[02:15:00.666 --> 02:15:01.486]  It's now happening.
[02:15:01.486 --> 02:15:10.168]  The taxing of the web, the regulating cable companies not letting you visit most sites, Australia headline passing Chinese style internet censorship.
[02:15:10.168 --> 02:15:13.889]  It's all happening!
[02:15:13.889 --> 02:15:15.869]  And it's all in the Wall Street Journal today.
[02:15:15.869 --> 02:15:21.230]  They go on and admit this will shut down the web and this is Obama's upgrade of the web.
[02:15:21.230 --> 02:15:24.051]  As I told you a week ago when he announced it, I said that's internet too.
[02:15:26.078 --> 02:15:27.018]  And here it is.
[02:15:27.018 --> 02:15:28.539]  It is Internet 2.
[02:15:28.539 --> 02:15:29.660]  This is it.
[02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:31.521]  This is it, boys!
[02:15:31.521 --> 02:15:33.241]  So we better use it while we've got it.
[02:15:33.241 --> 02:15:40.144]  We need to fight for the web, fight for its freedom, fight for its openness now like we're going to lose it.
[02:15:40.144 --> 02:15:44.486]  But we need to fight like we're going to lose it, because we are going to lose it.
[02:15:44.486 --> 02:15:50.189]  If we raise enough hue and cry, if we expose what they're doing, we may be able to back them off.
[02:15:50.189 --> 02:15:54.211]  But living in denial about the fact that they're trying this is what's going to let them succeed.
[02:15:58.012 --> 02:16:06.743]  And we need to reach out to people with the basic information about the New World Order and how it really operates, as if they are going to be successful.
[02:16:06.743 --> 02:16:08.545]  So hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[02:16:08.545 --> 02:16:13.190]  Reach as many people as you can, like the web's not going to be there in six months, a year, maybe even sooner.
[02:16:13.190 --> 02:16:14.412]  The web as you know it.
[02:16:14.412 --> 02:16:17.516]  It'll just be a few thousand mainline sites, all heavily censored.
[02:16:18.729 --> 02:16:21.351]  It was a perfect storm coming together to do this.
[02:16:21.351 --> 02:16:32.459]  The newspapers are dying, the TV is imploding, people don't trust them anymore, the alternative blogs are blowing them out of the water, so they're panicking.
[02:16:32.459 --> 02:16:40.104]  Somebody like NuffRespect, that's his handle, he can make a video, you know, that five million people watch in a year.
[02:16:40.104 --> 02:16:42.226]  A five minute video that took him a few hours to make.
[02:16:43.504 --> 02:16:44.925]  John Watkins from Cardiff.
[02:16:44.925 --> 02:16:47.847]  John, thanks for holding while I went into that basic rant.
[02:16:47.847 --> 02:16:52.170]  It's just so much is going on, so much is unfolding right now.
[02:16:52.170 --> 02:16:53.330]  What's your battle plan?
[02:16:53.330 --> 02:16:58.714]  I mean, what's your ideas of ways to counter this?
[02:16:58.714 --> 02:17:00.275]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:17:00.275 --> 02:17:05.238]  Yeah, well, with this censorship, I mean, it's just getting beyond the joke now.
[02:17:05.238 --> 02:17:12.863]  I mean, I've spoken to so many people just in this last week who've told me so many different stories about how they're being censored, you know, all the different ways that
[02:17:13.382 --> 02:17:17.605]  You know, Google is now trying to restrict people's, you know, free speech.
[02:17:17.605 --> 02:17:29.533]  But, you know, one thing I think, you know, I encourage every YouTube user to take part in this boycott that we're organizing for this Friday, you know, so that we can send a clear message to YouTube.
[02:17:29.533 --> 02:17:35.697]  Because, you know, we have to accept that they are a company and, you know, they're obviously motivated by money.
[02:17:35.697 --> 02:17:40.280]  So, you know, there's only so much that we can do, but we can at least
[02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:49.898]  Get a message out to them, just to let them know that we're not happy about all these different changes that they're implementing on YouTube now.
[02:17:49.898 --> 02:17:59.708]  I'm not saying that this blackout this coming Friday is necessarily going to make Google change their minds about all these different new policies that they've brought in.
[02:18:00.936 --> 02:18:15.828]  I think that, at the very least, it'll get Google to seriously reconsider, you know, what they're doing at the moment and reconsider any... Well, it's the beginning of an idea and introduces to people that we better have an alternative to Google and YouTube.
[02:18:15.828 --> 02:18:21.913]  We educate people that they're censoring and restricting and cheating the hit counts to keep us off the front page.
[02:18:21.913 --> 02:18:22.213]  And, uh...
[02:18:23.655 --> 02:18:29.962]  I'm going to ask the Alex Jones Channel guy to have our channel go black for that day, shut our videos down for that day.
[02:18:29.962 --> 02:18:40.873]  You know, if you shut your videos down for that day, that is really... and if everybody else does that and doesn't visit YouTube Friday, that will send them a strong message.
[02:18:41.601 --> 02:18:42.302]  Well, that's right.
[02:18:42.302 --> 02:18:47.045]  You know, if enough of us do this, then obviously they won't be able to ignore it.
[02:18:47.045 --> 02:18:51.608]  You know, they obviously already know because there's so many people who've uploaded videos this week.
[02:18:51.608 --> 02:18:53.710]  But it's not so much about even letting them know.
[02:18:53.710 --> 02:18:56.412]  It's about everybody else wondering what we're talking about.
[02:18:56.412 --> 02:18:57.672]  I mean, it's a huge event.
[02:18:57.672 --> 02:18:58.333]  It's very important.
[02:18:59.216 --> 02:18:59.957]  Well, that's right.
[02:18:59.957 --> 02:19:01.638]  I mean, we've got to take action now.
[02:19:01.638 --> 02:19:10.966]  And as I say, the simplest form of action is simply just to boycott Google's products completely and, you know, obviously refrain from using YouTube for at least one day.
[02:19:10.966 --> 02:19:13.168]  And I think most people can manage that.
[02:19:13.168 --> 02:19:16.571]  You know, I personally won't be using YouTube for probably a week.
[02:19:16.571 --> 02:19:20.554]  You know, from the 19th of December, I probably won't use it again right up until the end of December.
[02:19:21.092 --> 02:19:29.615]  You know, and I've already stopped using Google products completely now because, you know, I'm just so annoyed by the fact that they're refusing to listen to us.
[02:19:29.615 --> 02:19:31.296]  And we need to start moving now.
[02:19:31.296 --> 02:19:37.118]  Well, they're about to give them a government monopoly over internet too, so that's, you know, don't be evil.
[02:19:37.118 --> 02:19:38.559]  They were set up by the CIA.
[02:19:38.559 --> 02:19:39.399]  We have the documents.
[02:19:39.399 --> 02:19:40.800]  It's always been a front.
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:46.222]  It's meant to make you think it's the alternative, but it's allowed to break all the rules on the web, do whatever it wants.
[02:19:46.222 --> 02:19:47.582]  They are the beast.
[02:19:47.582 --> 02:19:48.783]  They've moved in with NASA.
[02:19:49.383 --> 02:19:50.144]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:50.144 --> 02:19:50.664]  Stay there.
[02:19:50.664 --> 02:19:52.726]  We're talking enough respect.
[02:19:52.726 --> 02:19:54.327]  The holiday season is here again!
[02:19:54.327 --> 02:19:58.210]  A time to appreciate our friends and family and the many blessings we have.
[02:19:58.210 --> 02:20:01.313]  It's also time to find unique gift ideas for those we love.
[02:20:01.313 --> 02:20:04.476]  This year, why not give a gift that saves your loved ones money?
[02:20:04.476 --> 02:20:09.320]  A two-ounce bottle of fuel conditioner from Fuel Saver Technologies makes a great stocking stuffer.
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:11.622]  It's also an inexpensive and thoughtful present.
[02:20:11.622 --> 02:20:17.587]  A small squeeze of our product in the gas tank improves combustion, boosting fuel economy ten to twenty percent or more.
[02:20:17.807 --> 02:20:19.808]  It's completely safe for all engines.
[02:20:19.808 --> 02:20:25.771]  Our fuel additive also reduces emissions, maintenance costs, and reduces the friction of engine moving parts.
[02:20:25.771 --> 02:20:29.854]  Each little bottle treats 100 gallons of gasoline or 50 gallons of diesel.
[02:20:29.854 --> 02:20:34.016]  With a case of 16 or 32 bottles, you'll have plenty to give as gifts.
[02:20:34.016 --> 02:20:37.198]  And the cost is only $6 per bottle with free shipping!
[02:20:37.498 --> 02:20:40.142]  Call us toll free 866-768-7811 or go online at fuelsaverinc.com.
[02:20:40.142 --> 02:20:40.443]  That's 866-768-7811.
[02:20:40.443 --> 02:20:42.466]  A unique gift that saves everyone money!
[02:20:52.421 --> 02:20:54.063]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:20:54.063 --> 02:20:55.605]  December 15, 2008.
[02:20:55.605 --> 02:20:57.266]  Gold opened this morning at $828.80.
[02:20:57.266 --> 02:21:01.271]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $853.54, $426.77 for the half ounce, and $213.38 for a quarter ounce.
[02:21:01.271 --> 02:21:01.711]  That's $853.54, $426.77, and $213.38.
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:15.284]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[02:21:15.284 --> 02:21:19.646]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a yon revolution.
[02:21:19.646 --> 02:21:27.771]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:21:27.771 --> 02:21:30.213]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:21:30.353 --> 02:21:34.236]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:21:34.236 --> 02:21:40.482]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[02:21:40.482 --> 02:21:43.905]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:21:43.905 --> 02:21:46.987]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:21:46.987 --> 02:21:47.288]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:47.288 --> 02:21:47.468]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:52.592 --> 02:21:59.338]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:59.338 --> 02:22:01.980]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:03.541]  But who is the enemy?
[02:22:03.541 --> 02:22:04.322]  Bin Laden.
[02:22:04.322 --> 02:22:05.282]  This is his MO.
[02:22:05.282 --> 02:22:06.704]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:22:06.704 --> 02:22:08.685]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:22:08.685 --> 02:22:15.431]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:22:15.831 --> 02:22:16.311]  Some U.S.
[02:22:16.311 --> 02:22:22.673]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:22:22.673 --> 02:22:26.153]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:22:26.153 --> 02:22:36.636]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:22:36.636 --> 02:22:37.876]  Fabled Enemies.
[02:22:37.876 --> 02:22:44.478]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:45.639 --> 02:22:48.998]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:53.417 --> 02:22:57.098]  Santa, Christmas Eve, and you haven't left yet?
[02:22:57.098 --> 02:22:59.698]  Ho ho ho ho ho!
[02:22:59.698 --> 02:23:00.858]  No!
[02:23:00.858 --> 02:23:02.599]  I can't find my keys.
[02:23:02.599 --> 02:23:03.919]  Here's the perfect gift.
[02:23:03.919 --> 02:23:07.980]  Our patented Find One Find All Key Finder, or FOFA XT for short.
[02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:13.381]  Once a FOFA Key Finder is attached to each of those easy to lose things, it can find and be found by all the rest.
[02:23:13.381 --> 02:23:19.362]  Use your wallet to find your keys, your keys to find the remote control, or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[02:23:19.522 --> 02:23:25.524]  FOFA goes through walls, cushions and laundry baskets up to 30 feet and projects a loud 90 plus decibel beep.
[02:23:25.524 --> 02:23:28.826]  And new for Christmas, there's even a FOFA just for eyeglasses.
[02:23:28.826 --> 02:23:31.027]  Where did I put my glasses Mrs. Claus?
[02:23:32.082 --> 02:23:33.583]  Well, here they are!
[02:23:33.583 --> 02:23:37.365]  Luckily, Rudolph's nose isn't the only thing that flashes.
[02:23:37.365 --> 02:23:41.226]  Order your FOFA today with batteries included along with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

[02:23:41.567 --> 02:23:42.227]  That's 866-245-8670.

[02:23:43.608 --> 02:23:44.628]  Again, that's findonefindall.com.
[02:23:58.439 --> 02:24:01.060]  Denial is letting all of this happen.
[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:02.220]  Denial about the troops.
[02:24:02.220 --> 02:24:03.861]  Denial about the banks.
[02:24:03.861 --> 02:24:10.843]  Denial about the corrupt government that's on TV and radio and print telling us how good they are, how much they love us.
[02:24:10.843 --> 02:24:15.285]  They're a pack of criminals and dirtbag parasites.
[02:24:15.285 --> 02:24:20.687]  You need to get angry, folks, because once tyranny happens, it just takes everything.
[02:24:20.687 --> 02:24:22.127]  It just destroys everything.
[02:24:22.127 --> 02:24:23.588]  And now we're getting deep into it.
[02:24:24.628 --> 02:24:25.909]  Now we're getting down the line.
[02:24:25.909 --> 02:24:27.749]  The FEMA camps, the troops, all of it.
[02:24:27.749 --> 02:24:29.530]  And to do that, they've got to shut down the web.
[02:24:29.530 --> 02:24:33.471]  But they've got to have the cattle still think everything's okay.
[02:24:33.471 --> 02:24:38.213]  So they're going to advertise, oh, the evil, bad, dirty web that wasn't safe for your kids.
[02:24:38.213 --> 02:24:40.174]  It's now been shut down.
[02:24:40.174 --> 02:24:43.455]  And if you try to get on it, maybe you can if you're a techie expert.
[02:24:43.455 --> 02:24:45.956]  But for everybody else, there's the new Google.
[02:24:45.956 --> 02:24:48.797]  The Google that runs the whole backbone.
[02:24:48.797 --> 02:24:53.139]  And so it's important to start using some of the other search engines that are out there.
[02:24:54.734 --> 02:25:04.559]  It's important to start using, I've kicked Google Ads off of Infowars and Prison Planet and then one of my people, I saw Google back up there and they go, oh it must have been an old template.
[02:25:04.559 --> 02:25:08.901]  Anybody in my office, this is the message right now, if I see Google Ads back up, you're fired.
[02:25:08.901 --> 02:25:11.923]  Okay, just get that part straight right there.
[02:25:11.923 --> 02:25:14.464]  I'm having nothing to do with them.
[02:25:14.464 --> 02:25:15.885]  Okay?
[02:25:15.885 --> 02:25:17.846]  I have to do that now or people don't listen to me.
[02:25:17.846 --> 02:25:21.488]  Okay, going back to John Watkins.
[02:25:21.488 --> 02:25:21.748]  John,
[02:25:23.131 --> 02:25:24.452]  This is a short segment.
[02:25:24.452 --> 02:25:27.776]  Again, you run the channel EnoughRespect on YouTube with tens of millions of views.
[02:25:27.776 --> 02:25:32.540]  They've been censoring you in a cocktail of different ways.
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:35.604]  Where do you see all this going in this fight?
[02:25:35.604 --> 02:25:40.829]  Well, it's pretty worrying really because, you know, if this carries on the way it's going, I can imagine
[02:25:41.773 --> 02:25:48.458]  Within only a couple of years, I can imagine that Google will own just about every service available on the net, because that seems to be the way it's going.
[02:25:48.458 --> 02:25:59.987]  You know, Google seems to be trying to monopolize just about every internet service available, including, you know, videos, email, search engines, web browsers... And they're being allowed to!
[02:26:00.859 --> 02:26:01.460]  That's right.
[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:04.284]  You know, no one seems to be really that bothered about it.
[02:26:04.284 --> 02:26:05.265]  That's the key.
[02:26:05.265 --> 02:26:12.735]  I mean, they'll shut down some small business and say that it's a trust when it's not, but then Google truly is setting one up.
[02:26:14.096 --> 02:26:14.957]  Well, this is it.
[02:26:14.957 --> 02:26:29.071]  And, you know, what tends to happen is, well, the pattern might be is that whenever Google has a competitor that is extremely popular, like YouTube was, Google will simply just buy it out, just like they're doing with Yahoo now.
[02:26:29.071 --> 02:26:33.075]  I heard the other day that they're trying to buy out Yahoo.
[02:26:33.075 --> 02:26:35.318]  So it seems like they're basically
[02:26:36.341 --> 02:26:44.287]  You know, restricting our freedom of choice as well as, you know, censoring... And the key is the working with the government to restrict and shut people down.
[02:26:44.287 --> 02:26:49.231]  And again, I'll just tell everybody right now, this is a big deal because that's how we reach a lot of new people.
[02:26:49.231 --> 02:26:51.853]  You don't find my stuff in the search engines like you did before.
[02:26:52.393 --> 02:26:54.094]  They're going in and removing it.
[02:26:54.094 --> 02:27:11.202]  I can put in whole headlines, whole headlines of articles we've written, John, that got, you know, I mean, back when the British bombed themselves, the British government on 7-7, if you typed in London bombing, it was number one on the search engine.
[02:27:11.202 --> 02:27:14.484]  But now we put in our headlines, it's not there.
[02:27:14.484 --> 02:27:16.905]  It's not that it's moved down the rankings, it's gone.
[02:27:17.679 --> 02:27:36.057]  Well this is it, and I can actually remember that, because when the London bombings occurred, you know, just like many other people, I went on the internet and I was searching for information about it, and you know, when you typed, you know, London bombings into Google, it was the whole search results on that first page, with all Prison Planet and InfoWars links,
[02:27:36.898 --> 02:27:40.882]  Then, after a while, what they did was get rid of the descriptions underneath those links.
[02:27:40.882 --> 02:27:43.784]  All you had was just the link itself and no description underneath it.
[02:27:43.784 --> 02:27:48.348]  And now I see that a lot of those links are disappearing completely now.
[02:27:48.348 --> 02:27:54.234]  So, you know, obviously there is an agenda in place to restrict this information, you know.
[02:27:54.234 --> 02:27:59.799]  And, you know, they're restricting our ability to get information out there to people.
[02:27:59.799 --> 02:28:01.881]  And, you know, it's quite worrying, really.
[02:28:02.742 --> 02:28:10.448]  Well, I put in the exact headline from the Bay Fest in Alabama where they had troops searching three-year-old children, training them how to be slaves.
[02:28:10.448 --> 02:28:14.912]  And I put in the exact headline, it wouldn't come up, but then I went to my site and found it.
[02:28:14.912 --> 02:28:19.355]  I mean, they are literally censoring exact headlines now.
[02:28:19.355 --> 02:28:23.438]  For those who don't know how search engines work, that means they have been de-indexing.
[02:28:23.438 --> 02:28:25.140]  They have been removing us on purpose.
[02:28:25.956 --> 02:28:27.097]  Well, that's right, yeah.
[02:28:27.097 --> 02:28:28.759]  I mean, that's right.
[02:28:28.759 --> 02:28:29.760]  So we've got to make a stand.
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:34.685]  We've got to let Google know that we're not happy with the way that they're operating.
[02:28:34.685 --> 02:28:37.087]  If we do nothing, it's only going to get worse.
[02:28:37.087 --> 02:28:39.189]  So we've got to protest in some way about it.
[02:28:39.189 --> 02:28:41.952]  And boycotting is one thing that we can do.
[02:28:41.952 --> 02:28:47.077]  And I'm sure it will have some effect, although Google will obviously make out that it's not bothering them at all.
[02:28:47.958 --> 02:28:54.740]  You know, I mean, there's just so many different ways that they're stopping certain videos, for instance, going viral on YouTube now.
[02:28:54.740 --> 02:28:56.681]  You know, just a host of different ways.
[02:28:56.681 --> 02:29:10.006]  Fiddling the view counters, removing honours from videos, removing honours from people's channels, like they did with my channel last week, and a few other people they've done this to, and removing pages full of comments.
[02:29:10.006 --> 02:29:16.988]  And this is another way they keep videos out of the most discussed lists, is to remove lots of comments so that it keeps it low on those lists.
[02:29:17.686 --> 02:29:25.111]  And, you know... That's right, when it's a video with a girl in a bikini, they keep all the comments, but then they remove them from ours.
[02:29:25.111 --> 02:29:27.613]  You'll just go in and there'll be, say, 2,000 comments.
[02:29:27.613 --> 02:29:32.217]  They'll just remove them and start it over to knock you off the main pages.
[02:29:32.217 --> 02:29:36.119]  And again, the worst part of this is they pose like they're open and free.
[02:29:36.119 --> 02:29:40.262]  It's just, it's just absolutely disgusting.
[02:29:40.262 --> 02:29:40.863]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:42.645 --> 02:29:45.647]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:45.647 --> 02:29:49.250]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:52.759 --> 02:29:56.300]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[02:29:56.300 --> 02:29:58.760]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?
[02:29:58.760 --> 02:29:59.820]  Guaranteed!
[02:29:59.820 --> 02:30:06.742]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com has helped tens of thousands out of debt since 1993 and will free you from the debt trap.
[02:30:06.742 --> 02:30:14.703]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com legally guarantees to put an end to wage garnishment, bank levies and liens and you won't pay one dime to creditors.
[02:30:14.703 --> 02:30:18.404]  With Debt Crisis Solutions program you'll also restore your credit history
[02:30:18.524 --> 02:30:18.784]  I think so.
[02:30:40.526 --> 02:30:44.048]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[02:30:44.048 --> 02:30:45.169]  And we knew what to do.
[02:30:45.169 --> 02:30:46.850]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:30:46.850 --> 02:30:53.233]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:31:10.629 --> 02:31:17.831]  The EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:31:17.831 --> 02:31:24.933]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:31:24.933 --> 02:31:27.994]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:31:27.994 --> 02:31:33.195]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:31:33.875 --> 02:31:36.957]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:31:36.957 --> 02:31:43.001]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:31:43.001 --> 02:31:45.923]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:31:45.923 --> 02:31:50.866]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:31:52.318 --> 02:31:58.162]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:31:58.162 --> 02:32:03.586]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:32:03.586 --> 02:32:08.970]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:32:08.970 --> 02:32:14.875]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:32:14.875 --> 02:32:19.138]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[02:32:19.338 --> 02:32:21.079]  Most people are overly acidic.
[02:32:21.079 --> 02:32:24.860]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:29.683]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:32:29.683 --> 02:32:30.743]  Do your part.
[02:32:30.743 --> 02:32:33.364]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[02:32:33.364 --> 02:32:39.467]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[02:32:39.787 --> 02:32:42.572]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.

[02:32:49.042 --> 02:32:51.025]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[02:32:58.931 --> 02:33:02.832]  Look, you don't think the bankers are going to gut you for tens of trillions of dollars.
[02:33:02.832 --> 02:33:03.833]  You've already got 8.5 trillion.
[02:33:03.833 --> 02:33:10.175]  You don't think they're just going to put troops on the streets to crack your heads and teach you how to lick boots.
[02:33:10.175 --> 02:33:24.500]  No, they're going to shut the web down, but for all the cowardly pig people out there, they're still going to have their NFL websites, they're still going to have their Dancing with the Stars websites, they're still going to have the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
[02:33:25.768 --> 02:33:28.091]  We're still going to have CNN and Fox News.
[02:33:28.091 --> 02:33:31.355]  They can't play on a level playing field.
[02:33:31.355 --> 02:33:34.058]  We're kicking their butts.
[02:33:34.058 --> 02:33:38.784]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, bigger than most major newspaper websites.
[02:33:38.784 --> 02:33:43.150]  They're scared of that and thousands of other prolific sites out there, so they're shutting them down.
[02:33:44.246 --> 02:33:49.608]  And so, ladies and gentlemen, that's why we stay on shortwave and stay on AM and FM dial, because that's all precious.
[02:33:49.608 --> 02:33:53.049]  But they're moving in with the digital to shut down the mom and pop stations.
[02:33:53.049 --> 02:33:57.331]  They're hitting us from every side as we go into this darkness.
[02:33:57.331 --> 02:34:03.153]  That's why it's important to have hard copies of all my books and videos and materials.
[02:34:03.153 --> 02:34:08.475]  Low-tech info war, because as things get worse and worse, that information will be more and more precious.
[02:34:09.534 --> 02:34:14.676]  That's why if you don't have the full library of DVDs and films at InfoWars.com, you need to get them.
[02:34:14.676 --> 02:34:18.678]  Or call toll free to get them.
[02:34:18.678 --> 02:34:19.158]  888-253-3139.
[02:34:19.158 --> 02:34:26.481]  And long term, they admit, they plan within about five years, your computer will have nothing on it.
[02:34:26.481 --> 02:34:28.722]  You won't be able to buy one that doesn't.
[02:34:28.722 --> 02:34:31.043]  It will all be about the servers.
[02:34:31.043 --> 02:34:35.945]  And it'll be their servers and everything you have will be on their servers, their system.
[02:34:36.846 --> 02:34:45.588]  And so you'll just have a terminal or a handheld device that dials into them and then see they are re-engineering the architecture so there's no freedom.
[02:34:45.588 --> 02:34:48.829]  When video sharing sites got big, they just bought them up.
[02:34:48.829 --> 02:34:51.230]  So don't leave Google and YouTube.
[02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:54.290]  Keep fighting there in MySpace.
[02:34:54.290 --> 02:35:00.152]  But clone everything you do to lesser sub-sites and try to promote those and make them big.
[02:35:01.711 --> 02:35:03.172]  Use alternative search engines.
[02:35:03.172 --> 02:35:10.136]  We're going to do a big story about this and fight for this issue because they're going to incrementally hack the web down to nothing.
[02:35:10.136 --> 02:35:21.723]  Going back to John Wodkin's NuffRespect YouTube channel, NuffRespect, you're going to be able Friday, right, to basically turn your side off for a day or what are you planning to do?
[02:35:21.723 --> 02:35:29.928]  Well, what I'm planning to do, as you mentioned earlier about uploading a video that just contains noise and black
[02:35:30.703 --> 02:35:30.903]  I don't
[02:35:52.699 --> 02:36:00.301]  Because, you know, some of my videos do get quite a lot of views, so I'm sure that, you know, YouTube should notice that.
[02:36:00.301 --> 02:36:01.302]  I'm sure they would notice that.
[02:36:01.302 --> 02:36:06.503]  Well, they're going to notice the big buzz of all these sites being turned off, including the Alex Jones Channel.
[02:36:06.503 --> 02:36:10.885]  I'm going to get the guy that runs that to shut it down.
[02:36:10.885 --> 02:36:15.866]  And again, because we need to show people what it's going to be like if they win.
[02:36:15.866 --> 02:36:16.667]  Well, that's right.
[02:36:16.667 --> 02:36:21.048]  We've got to protest about this now, because if we do nothing, it'll just continue.
[02:36:21.835 --> 02:36:26.117]  And, you know, it's frightening, really, when you consider, you know, what they're doing right now.
[02:36:26.117 --> 02:36:30.779]  It really makes you worry about where it's all going to end up, really, you know.
[02:36:30.779 --> 02:36:41.003]  I mean, Google has just taken over just about every service available on the Internet, and if that carries on, it's just going to be one big monopoly that Google owns.
[02:36:41.912 --> 02:37:04.262]  And, you know, that's just the tip of the iceberg, really, because when you look into Internet 2, the way they're chopping up the web, it's just, I mean, obviously, you know, we know the reason why they're doing it, because in order for them to, you know, for the elite to, in order for them to continue with their globalist agenda, they need to restrict the web, and that's exactly what they're doing right now.
[02:37:04.904 --> 02:37:11.205]  And this new policy on YouTube now where they're algorithmically promoting videos
[02:37:12.432 --> 02:37:14.493]  That just doesn't sound right to me.
[02:37:14.493 --> 02:37:18.194]  It just doesn't sound fair or democratic in any way at all.
[02:37:18.194 --> 02:37:27.136]  Yeah, they claim, well, we have a magic machine that shows that it's no longer your videos will be on top of the number of hits, which is obviously the most democratic system.
[02:37:27.136 --> 02:37:33.638]  It's just like Dig got big being open and free, voting up stories, and then they rigged it and admitted that they'd rigged it.
[02:37:33.638 --> 02:37:39.680]  As soon as something gets big, they have to rig it because the patriots, the liberty lovers, the anti-war people,
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:43.001]  Those that love freedom take it over, but I want to explain to everybody.
[02:37:43.001 --> 02:37:57.747]  The Wall Street Journal is reporting today, Google wants its own fast track on the web, and it says, uh, the celebrated openness of the internet, network providers are not supposed to give preferential treatment to any traffic.
[02:37:58.522 --> 02:38:00.884]  It's quietly losing powerful defenders.
[02:38:00.884 --> 02:38:05.767]  Well, see, the media made the people that defended net neutrality were really operatives.
[02:38:05.767 --> 02:38:07.928]  And now at the key point, they're flipping.
[02:38:07.928 --> 02:38:11.210]  And it's in the article going, yeah, let's shut down the old web.
[02:38:11.210 --> 02:38:13.631]  Yeah, I mean, it actually says it in this article.
[02:38:13.631 --> 02:38:17.414]  Yeah, you'll only be able to go to the places we want you to.
[02:38:17.414 --> 02:38:18.555]  That's a good thing.
[02:38:18.555 --> 02:38:19.415]  I mean, this is it.
[02:38:19.415 --> 02:38:20.436]  So it's not just Google.
[02:38:21.096 --> 02:38:28.923]  That's that censoring themselves and censoring their search engines while lying to the public and holding out that they're free and open and the best.
[02:38:28.923 --> 02:38:39.773]  It's that they want to be the backbone for the censorship of the web and they want to be the nexus point deciding on whose website gets through and who doesn't.
[02:38:40.353 --> 02:38:43.454]  So, and that's why they moved in with NASA two years ago.
[02:38:43.454 --> 02:38:52.936]  We have a CIA agent, Mr. Steelon, mentioning the head doctor in this technology who really runs Google for the CIA.
[02:38:52.936 --> 02:38:56.837]  They have these young yuppies as their fronts.
[02:38:56.837 --> 02:38:59.058]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:59.058 --> 02:39:02.619]  Well, you know, it's just disgusting really.
[02:39:02.619 --> 02:39:04.600]  I mean, it really is.
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:06.220]  Everything you've just said, it's just
[02:39:06.989 --> 02:39:07.790]  It worries me.
[02:39:07.790 --> 02:39:16.275]  It worries me big time because this is our free speech and anyone who really values this free speech should make a protest about this and do something now.
[02:39:16.275 --> 02:39:22.099]  Let Google know that we're not happy because this is our own free speech we're talking about.
[02:39:22.099 --> 02:39:27.863]  And I can't see it getting any better under Obama because a lot of the things I've heard about what he's doing
[02:39:28.796 --> 02:39:33.560]  You know, I can't see the Internet getting any better with him in power.
[02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:34.661]  But that's how they spin it!
[02:39:34.661 --> 02:39:35.482]  We're upgrading it!
[02:39:35.482 --> 02:39:36.623]  We're making it better!
[02:39:36.623 --> 02:39:38.345]  By the way, none of you will have websites!
[02:39:38.345 --> 02:39:40.346]  Ha ha ha!
[02:39:40.346 --> 02:39:41.207]  Well, this is it.
[02:39:41.207 --> 02:39:50.255]  I mean, with Obama, for instance, I mean, the way he came to power, I know he's not in the White House yet, but you know, there's another month to go, but
[02:39:51.108 --> 02:39:56.850]  Everything about the way he came to power reminds me exactly of how Blair came to power in the UK back in 97.
[02:39:56.850 --> 02:40:01.352]  Because, you know, at that time we had a deeply unpopular conservative government.
[02:40:01.352 --> 02:40:02.232]  John Major!
[02:40:02.232 --> 02:40:06.234]  Yeah, it was associated with sleaze and corruption.
[02:40:06.234 --> 02:40:10.455]  Pretty much like the Republican administration.
[02:40:10.455 --> 02:40:12.656]  And, you know, they'd just been in power for too long.
[02:40:12.656 --> 02:40:14.277]  People wanted change.
[02:40:14.277 --> 02:40:19.839]  And, you know, they wanted a government that was for the people, free of any sleaze or incompetence and corruption.
[02:40:20.755 --> 02:40:21.376]  I think so.
[02:40:38.755 --> 02:40:47.282]  I was fooled into it and I fell for it hook line and sinker so it shows how easily people can be fooled, you know?
[02:40:47.282 --> 02:40:59.612]  Oh they're running around saying censor us because we say Obama's bad and they say we need youth brigades, we need troops on the streets, Obama will fix it and then Obama just signed an order saying they will use troops and even non-law enforcement.
[02:40:59.612 --> 02:41:01.853]  They're going to be involved in every facet of our lives.
[02:41:01.853 --> 02:41:05.897]  I mean we're hurtling into tyranny and it was the same thing with Tony Blair.
[02:41:06.497 --> 02:41:12.401]  Uh, you know, they bring in Tony Blair as the liberal savior, and just like you said, look at what he turned England into.
[02:41:12.401 --> 02:41:15.924]  As soon as he got elected, he declared war on the Magna Carta.
[02:41:15.924 --> 02:41:16.844]  That's right.
[02:41:16.844 --> 02:41:31.955]  They say one thing to get into power, and then as soon as they're in power, they do the exact opposite, and I've seen this pattern over and over again, and I'm surprised that people haven't woken up to it by now, you know, en masse, because, you know, it's just become so obvious now that
[02:41:32.685 --> 02:41:41.570]  You know, I mean, by the time Blair had been in about two years, it was already becoming pretty clear that this guy was a phony in every sense of the word.
[02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:46.033]  And, you know, it just shows how easy it is for people to be fooled by these puppets.
[02:41:46.033 --> 02:41:47.233]  And that's all they are.
[02:41:47.233 --> 02:41:48.754]  They're just puppets.
[02:41:48.754 --> 02:41:57.259]  And, you know, from what I've seen, it's actually a very rare thing to have a president or prime minister who isn't in the pockets of the elite.
[02:41:57.950 --> 02:42:17.959]  And even Margaret Thatcher, she even admitted that there's a shadow government in place, and she even praised it, saying that the official government is just too slow at getting things done, and, you know, they've got to go through all the bureaucracy and red tape, and the only way they can fast-track things through is through the shadow government.
[02:42:17.959 --> 02:42:22.261]  So, you know, they're even telling us, they're not even hiding it.
[02:42:23.362 --> 02:42:31.530]  You know, from what I know about Obama, there's nothing to indicate to me that he's any different from the likes of Clinton or Bush or Blair or any of the other puppets.
[02:42:31.530 --> 02:42:36.215]  Well, I mean, out of the gates, he is taking everything Bush did and putting it on steroids, but, you know...
[02:42:37.459 --> 02:42:48.025]  And by the way, listeners, we haven't talked about the shoe incident because it's a diversion and a distraction, and while it's funny to watch that weasel dodge those shoes, it doesn't matter.
[02:42:48.025 --> 02:42:50.066]  We have trillions that are being stolen a week.
[02:42:50.066 --> 02:42:51.107]  We're imploding.
[02:42:51.107 --> 02:42:52.447]  We're going into martial law.
[02:42:52.447 --> 02:42:54.288]  They're shutting down the web in front of us.
[02:42:54.288 --> 02:43:00.592]  Let me read for the listeners out there, and then get your response to this, John Watkins, because
[02:43:02.095 --> 02:43:06.885]  Now again, this is Internet 2, but when you read the Internet 2 documents, they come right out and say it.
[02:43:06.885 --> 02:43:10.513]  This is Wall Street Journal introducing this to the public.
[02:43:10.513 --> 02:43:12.577]  Google wants its own fast track on the web.
[02:43:13.666 --> 02:43:21.329]  It says one major cable operator in talks with Google says it has been reluctant so far to strike a deal to have preferential treatment with Google.
[02:43:21.329 --> 02:43:26.631]  Of concern it might violate Federal Communications Commission guidelines on network neutrality.
[02:43:26.631 --> 02:43:33.834]  But then it goes on to say the government though is saying go ahead because you see Google is the special little puppy.
[02:43:33.834 --> 02:43:38.156]  It's allowed to do what none of the other big companies are allowed to do because they are there.
[02:43:38.156 --> 02:43:39.357]  It's really a government front.
[02:43:39.357 --> 02:43:39.797]  Continuing.
[02:43:40.831 --> 02:43:50.578]  If we did this, Washington would be on fire, says one executive at the cable company, who is familiar with the talks, referring to a likely reaction of regulators and lawmakers.
[02:43:50.578 --> 02:43:52.219]  But see, Obama's behind doing it.
[02:43:52.219 --> 02:43:53.640]  Separately, Microsoft Corp.
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:54.801]  and Yahoo, Inc.
[02:43:54.801 --> 02:44:00.765]  have withdrawn quietly from a coalition formed two years ago to protect a network neutrality.
[02:44:00.765 --> 02:44:03.907]  They only did that to co-op the people that were involved in the movement, I would add.
[02:44:05.197 --> 02:44:09.222]  Each company has forged relationships with phone and cable companies.
[02:44:09.222 --> 02:44:17.411]  In addition, prominent Internet scholars, some of whom have advised President-elect Barack Obama on technology issues, have softened their views on the subject.
[02:44:17.411 --> 02:44:23.357]  The consensus issue has wide ramifications for the Internet as a platform for new businesses.
[02:44:23.357 --> 02:44:26.521]  If companies like Google succeed in negotiating preferential treatment,
[02:44:28.959 --> 02:44:34.885]  The internet could become a place where wealthy companies get faster and easier access to the web than less affluent ones.
[02:44:34.885 --> 02:44:38.289]  Folks, the internet too says they're shutting all of us down.
[02:44:38.289 --> 02:44:39.850]  It doesn't say it like that.
[02:44:39.850 --> 02:44:42.353]  It says they're shutting us down.
[02:44:42.353 --> 02:44:46.657]  Introducing this to the public, it's, oh, well, they go to the head of the line.
[02:44:46.657 --> 02:44:49.260]  Sure, go ahead, then I'm going to finish the article.
[02:44:49.987 --> 02:44:57.535]  Well, they are seriously restricting our free speech and Google is obviously in the pockets of the establishment.
[02:44:57.535 --> 02:45:05.563]  There's no doubt about that because we know that they're sharing information about our searches, about what we search for using Google.
[02:45:05.563 --> 02:45:11.008]  Google goes into China and runs the IT censorship forum, so does Yahoo!
[02:45:11.909 --> 02:45:15.672]  So to say that they don't know how to do this is, they're already doing it, absolutely.
[02:45:15.672 --> 02:45:17.253]  They're turning up the ambient background.
[02:45:17.253 --> 02:45:19.134]  Let me finish this and I'm going to get your take on it.
[02:45:19.134 --> 02:45:26.700]  For computer users, it could mean that websites by companies not able to strike a fast lane deal, see, they're being deceptive.
[02:45:26.700 --> 02:45:29.302]  It's a whole new internet that we ain't on.
[02:45:29.302 --> 02:45:37.248]  But see, for computer users, it could mean that websites by companies not able to strike fast lane deals will respond more slowly than those by companies able to pay.
[02:45:37.868 --> 02:45:46.915]  In the worst case scenario, the internet could become a medium where large companies such as Comcast Corp and cable television would control both distribution and content.
[02:45:46.915 --> 02:45:48.577]  Well, they've already announced they're doing that.
[02:45:48.577 --> 02:45:51.899]  And much of what users can access, according to neutrality advocates.
[02:45:51.899 --> 02:45:53.681]  They've already tried it in Canada and Texas!
[02:45:54.321 --> 02:45:58.325]  And then it goes on to say, the shifting position concerns some purists.
[02:45:58.325 --> 02:46:00.687]  Oh, like we're purists because we want to web.
[02:46:00.687 --> 02:46:08.215]  What we're talking about is selling you the right to skip ahead of the line, says Ben Scott, policy director of Free Press, a Washington-based advocacy group.
[02:46:08.215 --> 02:46:13.440]  It would mean the first part of the business plan would be a deal with AT&T to get their super tier.
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:16.441]  This is anathema to a culture of innovation.
[02:46:16.441 --> 02:46:19.161]  Don't even the quote, advocates get it?
[02:46:19.161 --> 02:46:23.683]  Don't they go read Internet 2 and government reports from 6 years ago enough respect?
[02:46:23.683 --> 02:46:28.964]  I mean, don't they understand that they said they're going to shut... What did I tell you 6 years ago, folks?
[02:46:28.964 --> 02:46:31.645]  What did the articles Paul wrote 5 years ago, 4 years ago say?
[02:46:32.225 --> 02:46:41.252]  They're gonna shut down and not upgrade the old web, let it die, and then force you on internet too, where you have no rights and have like 2,000 choices.
[02:46:41.252 --> 02:46:43.314]  Do you under- instead of a billion.
[02:46:43.314 --> 02:46:44.535]  This is it!
[02:46:44.535 --> 02:46:46.136]  It's happening, go ahead.
[02:46:46.136 --> 02:46:56.925]  Well this is it, and they try and present these things as if they're doing us a favor, as if they're making the web better for us, and you know, it's exactly the same as what YouTube's doing now, saying that
[02:46:57.325 --> 02:47:02.690]  You know, they want to make it a better place for their users, but they've made it a lot worse in so many different ways.
[02:47:02.690 --> 02:47:11.879]  You know, they're offering free broadband and all these other kinds of deals to get people interested in it, and this is how they're trying to sell these things to us.
[02:47:11.879 --> 02:47:21.708]  Exactly, they're taking our tax money and giving us quote free bandwidth, but already in England, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are banning most of the government wireless systems.
[02:47:22.489 --> 02:47:31.960]  Well this is it, and also lots of libraries throughout the UK, lots of different places in the UK where you can't access certain sites anymore.
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:36.205]  You know, they're obviously actively censoring lots of different sites.
[02:47:37.346 --> 02:47:42.507]  You want to spread the word about Enough Respect YouTube channel, John Watkins, because they're censoring it.
[02:47:42.507 --> 02:47:46.588]  You want to spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:47:46.588 --> 02:47:51.269]  You want to fight back against their attempt to shut us off for the rest of the population.
[02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:53.450]  Verbally tell people about the site.
[02:47:53.450 --> 02:47:55.890]  Verbally tell them about links to the films.
[02:47:55.890 --> 02:47:57.831]  Don't tell your email list.
[02:47:57.831 --> 02:48:00.731]  Put out flyers on hundreds of cars.
[02:48:00.731 --> 02:48:02.352]  Spray paint it on the side of your house.
[02:48:03.032 --> 02:48:04.614]  Don't do it on a government building.
[02:48:04.614 --> 02:48:07.116]  We don't want to fight back like the Founding Fathers.
[02:48:07.116 --> 02:48:08.998]  So don't do anything illegal.
[02:48:08.998 --> 02:48:11.300]  Just get the word out and get aggressive.
[02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:19.428]  Now explain to people, John Watkins, explain to people what we're doing coming up this Friday.
[02:48:20.362 --> 02:48:25.784]  Well, what we're going to do is basically boycott YouTube this Friday for at least one day.
[02:48:25.784 --> 02:48:29.846]  I'm going to boycott it for at least a week.
[02:48:29.846 --> 02:48:33.808]  Some people are just going to boycott it for the weekend, but I'm going to do it for the whole week.
[02:48:33.808 --> 02:48:39.090]  Just don't use YouTube at all for at least one day.
[02:48:39.090 --> 02:48:39.871]  Don't log in.
[02:48:39.871 --> 02:48:45.033]  Don't watch any YouTube videos, even if they're embedded on another site.
[02:48:45.713 --> 02:48:48.575]  Just don't use YouTube at all for at least that one day.
[02:48:48.575 --> 02:48:53.137]  And, you know, there's so many other things we could be doing over, you know, this Christmas period anyway.
[02:48:53.137 --> 02:48:58.860]  So, you know, I can't see it being much of a problem for people just to boycott YouTube just for one day.
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:08.625]  So if we can get involved in that, you know, I encourage everybody who's a YouTube user to get involved and to upload videos to inform other people about what we're doing and to
[02:49:09.486 --> 02:49:15.915]  And to raise awareness about this issue, to raise awareness about all these changes that Google have made to YouTube.
[02:49:16.383 --> 02:49:29.488]  You know, and what they're doing, all these changes that they're doing to YouTube seem to be geared around restricting our ability to network with other users and to share information with large groups of people.
[02:49:29.488 --> 02:49:33.510]  For example, they've now removed the bulletin system from our channels.
[02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:38.372]  You know, before, just a few months ago, you could fire out a bulletin to all your friends.
[02:49:38.372 --> 02:49:43.354]  So if you had 5,000 friends, you could just send one message and it would go out to all of them in one go.
[02:49:43.354 --> 02:49:44.214]  Now you can't do that.
[02:49:45.018 --> 02:49:57.065]  They've also stopped people from sending videos to more than one friend at a time, and that's just ridiculous, because before you could send a video to every single one of your friends, even if you had 5,000 friends.
[02:49:57.065 --> 02:50:03.829]  Now you've got to do it one at a time, which becomes impossible if you've got, you know, even if you've got 100 friends, it's impossible to...
[02:50:04.469 --> 02:50:05.690]  You know, to do it one at a time.
[02:50:05.690 --> 02:50:14.773]  So, obviously they don't want us networking, they don't want us forming large groups of people where we can share information with large groups of people.
[02:50:14.773 --> 02:50:24.157]  So, this is not making YouTube any better, and yet they're putting it out to us, they're selling it to us as if it is making YouTube better, when clearly it's not.
[02:50:28.872 --> 02:50:35.198]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come right back and continue our discussion along these lines.
[02:50:35.198 --> 02:50:37.160]  And folks, I'm angry today.
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:40.303]  I mean, I'm not enjoying doing this radio show.
[02:50:40.303 --> 02:50:41.685]  This isn't fun!
[02:50:41.685 --> 02:50:51.875]  We have criminal, dirtbag, scum, destroying the internet, shutting it down all around us, stealing it, robbing it right in front of us, while they gang-rape us in the economy as well.
[02:50:52.588 --> 02:51:01.874]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[02:51:01.874 --> 02:51:10.039]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[02:51:10.039 --> 02:51:14.642]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[02:51:14.642 --> 02:51:17.404]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[02:51:17.404 --> 02:51:21.367]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol.
[02:51:21.567 --> 02:51:28.951]  Naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[02:51:28.951 --> 02:51:35.375]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[02:51:35.375 --> 02:51:43.299]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[02:51:50.702 --> 02:51:59.605]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:51:59.605 --> 02:52:02.246]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:52:02.246 --> 02:52:03.806]  But who is the enemy?
[02:52:03.806 --> 02:52:04.606]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:04.606 --> 02:52:05.367]  This is his ammo.
[02:52:05.367 --> 02:52:06.507]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:07.793 --> 02:52:08.073]  Some U.S.
[02:52:08.073 --> 02:52:11.358]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:22.933 --> 02:52:26.455]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:26.455 --> 02:52:36.920]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:38.141]  Fabled enemies.
[02:52:38.141 --> 02:52:45.905]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:45.905 --> 02:52:49.267]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:52:52.913 --> 02:52:56.354]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:52:56.354 --> 02:53:00.595]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:53:00.595 --> 02:53:12.259]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:53:12.259 --> 02:53:12.859]  Because our...
[02:53:30.501 --> 02:53:33.124]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:33.124 --> 02:53:35.226]  You know, we can beat these people.
[02:53:35.226 --> 02:53:42.753]  It doesn't have to be frustrating to watch these crooks having their way with us, destroying our society, putting trips on the streets.
[02:53:42.753 --> 02:53:44.255]  All of it.
[02:53:44.255 --> 02:53:48.859]  I want all the listeners to just go to Kinko's and make 500 copies of, uh...
[02:53:52.363 --> 02:53:52.823]  It's cheap.
[02:53:52.823 --> 02:54:03.171]  Let's say Infowars.com, powerful information, or Google Terror Storm, or put on there some other system, some other search engine name.
[02:54:03.171 --> 02:54:05.693]  I'm researching that all right now.
[02:54:05.693 --> 02:54:10.316]  And tell people to visit the sites now while we still can.
[02:54:10.316 --> 02:54:15.460]  Because you understand, they want to shut down free speech so they can have our way with us.
[02:54:15.460 --> 02:54:17.542]  This isn't just a boss hog, corrupt government.
[02:54:17.542 --> 02:54:21.865]  This is a murdering, criminal, New World Order, eugenicist group.
[02:54:22.779 --> 02:54:27.822]  Going back to the man over there with enough respect, YouTube channel.
[02:54:27.822 --> 02:54:30.183]  Going back to him.
[02:54:30.183 --> 02:54:37.307]  John Watkins, you know, my emotional salve is that I'm able to counter these people, expose these people, show them to be liars.
[02:54:37.307 --> 02:54:46.692]  And it just enrages me and horrifies me to know it's going to go back to when I first started out on 1FM talk station, and you know, for a year didn't even have a website.
[02:54:47.432 --> 02:54:51.453]  Where, you know, it was so rare to have somebody fighting them.
[02:54:51.453 --> 02:54:54.754]  And instead of so many of us standing up.
[02:54:54.754 --> 02:54:57.815]  But, you know, the good news is they're doing this because we're kicking their butt.
[02:54:57.815 --> 02:55:02.757]  Before they wanted to ignore us and laugh at us, they're trying to shut us off right now because we are hurting them.
[02:55:02.757 --> 02:55:08.198]  And I just love it that we're going to go on hurting them and go on exposing their lies.
[02:55:08.198 --> 02:55:10.599]  And that one day we're going to bring these Nazis to justice.
[02:55:11.903 --> 02:55:13.666]  Oh, that's right, and it shows that we're winning.
[02:55:13.666 --> 02:55:24.080]  We're winning the Info War, definitely, and that's why they're pulling out all these measures now to try and restrict us in every way they possibly can, because they know that they're losing and we're winning, so...
[02:55:25.387 --> 02:55:32.450]  I mean, you talk about the older technologies, the AM radio and that kind of thing.
[02:55:32.450 --> 02:55:34.770]  We can't let go of these kind of technologies.
[02:55:34.770 --> 02:55:36.071]  We've still got to use them.
[02:55:36.071 --> 02:55:45.074]  And also, even when it comes to YouTube, we can't simply walk away and go somewhere else and never use YouTube again, because obviously it is the most popular video sharing site.
[02:55:45.074 --> 02:55:49.856]  And it achieved that popularity long before Google took it over.
[02:55:50.556 --> 02:55:53.658]  And, you know, it is still the most popular video.
[02:55:53.658 --> 02:55:59.623]  Because it was democratic, because what was most popular went to the main page, but now they're ruining that.
[02:55:59.623 --> 02:56:09.770]  So we need to basically stay on YouTube, but only to attack them, only to expose the fact that they're engaging in false advertising and working with the man.
[02:56:09.770 --> 02:56:14.493]  I mean, even when mainstream news was showing the Marines killing the puppy, YouTube pulls that down.
[02:56:15.013 --> 02:56:20.377]  I mean, when it comes to videos of troops killing Iraqi children, they won't show it even when the news does.
[02:56:20.377 --> 02:56:23.179]  I mean, they're run by the Feds, man.
[02:56:23.179 --> 02:56:25.221]  Oh, there's no doubt about it at all.
[02:56:25.221 --> 02:56:30.525]  And, you know, there's so many different aspects to this whole New World Order agenda.
[02:56:30.525 --> 02:56:33.067]  So many different subjects that are involved.
[02:56:33.067 --> 02:56:37.230]  And each of these subjects, I've noticed it so many times where YouTube is now
[02:56:38.650 --> 02:56:43.172]  Restricting it in so many different ways, restricting the videos that we put out there.
[02:56:43.172 --> 02:56:53.596]  I mean, for instance, the fluoride issue with the Question Your Reality video that I posted on YouTube earlier this year.
[02:56:53.596 --> 02:57:01.080]  I mean, I'd already done a fair bit of research into fluoride and, you know, and how it affects the body.
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:03.601]  And I was just appalled by what I learned.
[02:57:04.950 --> 02:57:11.800]  You know, for example, we know that fluoride is a toxic waste product from the aluminium industry.
[02:57:13.178 --> 02:57:22.282]  You know, when I learned all this stuff, you know, the first thing I wanted to do was just get a video out there to inform people, to wake people up, and I saw your video on fluoride, and I thought, well, this is perfect.
[02:57:22.282 --> 02:57:25.724]  You expressed my thoughts exactly on that subject.
[02:57:25.724 --> 02:57:27.785]  You know, it was almost as if you'd read my mind.
[02:57:27.785 --> 02:57:36.769]  So I thought, well, I'm going to condense this video down into ten minutes, bang it up on YouTube, which I did, and it achieved quite a lot of views, but then all of a sudden, bang!
[02:57:36.769 --> 02:57:42.752]  You could tell that, you know, that they were censoring it heavily, you know, tiddling the view counters.
[02:57:43.527 --> 02:57:52.150]  And, I mean, when it comes to, um, the statistics on YouTube, you just simply, you cannot trust those statistics at all.
[02:57:52.150 --> 02:57:53.351]  Especially the view counter.
[02:57:53.351 --> 02:58:00.973]  That's why they freeze the view counter, because that gives them the opportunity to fiddle those numbers before we get to be able to see them.
[02:58:00.973 --> 02:58:02.314]  Yeah, well I've got a plan.
[02:58:02.314 --> 02:58:07.696]  Stay there, do a few more minutes with us, and then we've got Dr. Russell Blaylock, uh, joining us.
[02:58:07.696 --> 02:58:08.116]  Stay with us.
[02:58:11.240 --> 02:58:14.341]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:58:14.341 --> 02:58:19.862]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:58:19.862 --> 02:58:25.583]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:58:25.583 --> 02:58:27.064]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:27.064 --> 02:58:36.066]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:58:36.366 --> 02:58:38.208]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[02:58:38.208 --> 02:58:42.433]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[02:59:11.087 --> 02:59:17.849]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:59:17.849 --> 02:59:20.490]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:59:20.490 --> 02:59:22.051]  But who is the enemy?
[02:59:22.051 --> 02:59:22.831]  Bin Laden.
[02:59:22.831 --> 02:59:23.752]  This is his ammo.
[02:59:23.752 --> 02:59:25.172]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:59:25.172 --> 02:59:27.173]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:59:27.173 --> 02:59:34.356]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:59:34.356 --> 02:59:34.816]  Some U.S.
[02:59:34.816 --> 02:59:40.458]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:59:41.178 --> 02:59:44.660]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:59:44.660 --> 02:59:47.481]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:00:11.826 --> 03:00:14.987]  Do you take nutritional supplements but don't notice any benefit?
[03:00:14.987 --> 03:00:26.131]  The problem is, today's supplements contain things like DL-alpha-tocopherol, a synthetic form of vitamin E derived from petroleum, or ferrous fumerate, an inorganic form of iron that can actually damage your body.
[03:00:26.131 --> 03:00:30.272]  Many of today's vitamin and mineral supplements are actually stressing your liver and kidneys.
[03:00:30.272 --> 03:00:32.553]  Hi, my name is Steven Heuer, nutritionist.
[03:00:32.933 --> 03:00:41.437]  After 30 years of research and nutritional counseling, I've learned how the body works and how to work with it to bring about its healing and herculean health.
[03:00:41.437 --> 03:00:45.419]  Supplements can be a big waste of money if you're taking ineffective ones.
[03:00:45.419 --> 03:00:54.803]  So if you suffer from addictions, allergies, fatigue, depression, digestive problems, poor sleep, low libido, cancer, or any affliction, I can help.
[03:00:54.803 --> 03:00:57.905]  With my programs, people get positive results in 30 days or less.
[03:00:58.405 --> 03:01:02.967]  Call me for a free mini consultation at 888-988-3325.
[03:01:02.967 --> 03:01:06.968]  That's a free mini consultation at 888-988-3325.
[03:01:06.968 --> 03:01:14.851]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:01:14.851 --> 03:01:17.653]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:01:33.525 --> 03:01:46.810]  We've got certified neurosurgeon, author and lecturer, Dr. Blaylock, Russell L. Blaylock, M.D., to speak about their discoveries of what aspartame does to the brain.
[03:01:47.671 --> 03:01:52.532]  He trained under the eminent neurosurgeon Dr. Ludwig Kempe and many others.
[03:01:52.532 --> 03:01:53.892]  So he's got a long bio.
[03:01:53.892 --> 03:01:54.693]  We'll go over that.
[03:01:54.693 --> 03:01:58.753]  It's russelblaylockmd.com is the website.
[03:01:58.753 --> 03:02:03.715]  But Google and YouTube, they don't want you to hear that melamine is at 90% of the baby formula.
[03:02:03.715 --> 03:02:09.576]  They don't want you to hear that GMO crops are sterilizing and killing the rats and mice that are fed it.
[03:02:10.427 --> 03:02:12.207]  In some cases, 90% of them.
[03:02:12.207 --> 03:02:16.468]  They don't want you to hear that Aspartame is attacking your entire body.
[03:02:16.468 --> 03:02:18.809]  They don't want you to hear that.
[03:02:18.809 --> 03:02:23.810]  They want to shut down the web, and in closing, I want to thank you for your great work, John Watkins.
[03:02:23.810 --> 03:02:36.713]  You know, I've told people, especially with my videos being edited and censored at YouTube and Google and places, you have to create a new account under a new name, preferably even from another IP address,
[03:02:38.263 --> 03:02:46.510]  My name cannot be in the description, or the tags, or any other anti-globalist, anti-New World Order stuff.
[03:02:46.510 --> 03:02:55.238]  It needs to be like Janet Jameson, or Jenna Jameson, or whatever her name is, and you know, pop culture, stuff like that.
[03:02:55.238 --> 03:02:58.741]  And then you have to restrict the comments.
[03:02:58.741 --> 03:03:04.967]  Because the commenters will say my name, and then the algorithm will pick that up and censor it.
[03:03:06.581 --> 03:03:12.446]  And we've had MySpace and YouTube and Google administrators send us emails, we've posted them, written articles.
[03:03:12.446 --> 03:03:14.408]  They admit they censor us.
[03:03:14.408 --> 03:03:20.433]  My bulletins are blocked on MySpace, but we still stay there, even though they censor us as an outpost.
[03:03:20.433 --> 03:03:23.355]  We know internally we've got a couple hundred thousand friends.
[03:03:23.355 --> 03:03:26.258]  They froze it at 55,000 friends.
[03:03:26.258 --> 03:03:28.840]  I mean, you can't believe the stuff they do.
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:32.083]  Because culturally, we are what the people want.
[03:03:32.743 --> 03:03:41.065]  Culturally, we're mainstream, but they have to keep acting like we're the kooks, we're the weirdos, and, you know, have the media say we're grassy, gnoll crazies.
[03:03:41.065 --> 03:03:45.106]  Doesn't matter if 92% of Americans know the government killed Kennedy.
[03:03:45.106 --> 03:03:54.049]  It's that 8% still tell us we're crazy, and they've got to control the media to keep the illusion up so the mass of us never wake up and realize that we're really the majority.
[03:03:55.885 --> 03:04:01.788]  So, uh, I would tell everybody create clones of the videos and audios that you put the video of what I do.
[03:04:01.788 --> 03:04:04.530]  I know a lot of you do that and I commend you.
[03:04:04.530 --> 03:04:05.510]  Create clones.
[03:04:05.510 --> 03:04:10.073]  Upload it with the regular tags, but create doppelgangers.
[03:04:10.073 --> 03:04:11.453]  And not just YouTube and Google.
[03:04:11.453 --> 03:04:12.454]  Hit them everywhere.
[03:04:14.164 --> 03:04:17.525]  You know, that's why we stream our own videos at PrisonPlanet.tv for the members.
[03:04:17.525 --> 03:04:22.266]  But we can't pay for the bandwidth ourselves, so we say, you get high-quality video for 15 cents a day.
[03:04:22.266 --> 03:04:24.467]  Please use this as a factory of resistance.
[03:04:24.467 --> 03:04:25.147]  Burn them to death.
[03:04:25.147 --> 03:04:26.527]  Give them to people.
[03:04:26.527 --> 03:04:30.108]  Got five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:30.108 --> 03:04:34.229]  But with Internet, too, they're gonna shut that down where it's very hard for you to get to us.
[03:04:34.229 --> 03:04:36.430]  But I'm gonna do stuff like file lawsuits and stuff on them.
[03:04:36.430 --> 03:04:37.530]  Other people are.
[03:04:37.530 --> 03:04:43.232]  I mean, they're coming now to shut down our ability to fight them because we are kicking their criminal butts.
[03:04:44.838 --> 03:04:55.586]  There's a lot of other ideas, and again, by everybody shutting down their YouTube site for a day or two this Friday, it won't just be that YouTube and Google notice, their government fronts, you know, they expect it.
[03:04:55.586 --> 03:04:59.269]  It's to get everybody else paying attention, and call the media, too.
[03:04:59.269 --> 03:05:04.553]  You know, this anonymous thing going after Scientology, that's fine and dandy, and I'm all for it.
[03:05:04.553 --> 03:05:10.918]  The point is, the media gave that attention because that wasn't establishment, that was some rival to the system.
[03:05:12.338 --> 03:05:16.701]  Let's try to force the media to report that people are protesting and boycotting Google and YouTube.
[03:05:16.701 --> 03:05:25.067]  Let's get articles out on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com about this boycott and why we're boycotting, and then let's try to make the mainstream media pick it up.
[03:05:25.067 --> 03:05:38.176]  Okay, that said, I want to go to Dr. Blaylock, but in closing, John Watkins, I've been jumping all over you today, but, you know, it's because I'm so passionate and emotional about this because I know it's here, it's happening, but in closing, anything else you want to add?
[03:05:39.091 --> 03:05:49.121]  Well, um, one thing I wanted to say was just repeat what you said about uploading videos to other video sites, like LiveVideo and BlipTV, and there are countless others out there.
[03:05:49.799 --> 03:05:59.283]  And we can use this opportunity this weekend, when we're not using YouTube, we can check out some of these other sites and start uploading videos to those sites as well.
[03:05:59.283 --> 03:06:05.546]  Because obviously Google is not providing us with a fair level playing field to get information out there.
[03:06:05.546 --> 03:06:10.828]  So we're going to have to now concentrate on getting our information out to other video sites.
[03:06:10.828 --> 03:06:13.429]  And one thing, another thing I just wanted to add was that
[03:06:13.985 --> 03:06:15.767]  I'm on my channel on YouTube.
[03:06:15.767 --> 03:06:36.147]  I'm going to try and focus on doing some videos to show other people how to create the kind of videos that I do, you know, to try and present information in such a way that you can wake people up basically, you know, and to try and educate people on how to use certain kinds of video software to
[03:06:36.917 --> 03:06:41.219]  We need lots of videos as well, that's a great idea.
[03:06:41.219 --> 03:06:51.963]  We need lots of videos exposing the fact that they are censoring, and then encourage others to make videos showing that and to show how they're censoring.
[03:06:51.963 --> 03:06:53.284]  But exactly.
[03:06:54.381 --> 03:06:55.902]  We fight for YouTube and Google.
[03:06:55.902 --> 03:07:03.785]  We fight to keep them from becoming totally tyrannical, knowing they still are, though, because they are becoming the government, they are becoming Internet, too.
[03:07:03.785 --> 03:07:05.366]  That's in the Wall Street Journal today.
[03:07:05.366 --> 03:07:09.188]  But while we fight a rearguard action to wake up as many as we can, because that's where the people are,
[03:07:09.528 --> 03:07:14.933]  We drive them to the other alternative sites and say, hey, this place is no longer free.
[03:07:14.933 --> 03:07:16.274]  Come check this out.
[03:07:16.274 --> 03:07:20.819]  Well, I only commend you and I thank you for including me in your wonderful videos.
[03:07:20.819 --> 03:07:27.685]  And I want to have you back up in the near future, John Watkins, as we track the internet censorship that's taking place.
[03:07:27.685 --> 03:07:33.170]  Just Google YouTube Nuff Respect or Google Alex Jones in some of the top videos.
[03:07:34.151 --> 03:07:49.976]  Are enough respects videos he's reached what more than 20 30 million people from just the video hits that Google and YouTube show I'm sure it's a lot more than that another testament to the individual standing up and fighting back when there's a level playing field that's why they're tipping the tables on us good to have you on John
[03:07:50.756 --> 03:07:51.757]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:07:51.757 --> 03:07:53.439]  It's an absolute pleasure to be on the show.
[03:07:53.439 --> 03:07:55.180]  Thanks for having me on, my friend.
[03:07:55.180 --> 03:07:55.621]  Thank you.
[03:07:55.621 --> 03:07:56.582]  It's good to have you here.
[03:07:56.582 --> 03:08:07.271]  And folks, again, if I sound desperate today, if I sound upset, I mean, the Marines get caught running secret checkpoints and then lie about it, and then we have the local news reporters on that caught them lying about it.
[03:08:07.271 --> 03:08:10.254]  I mean, they have troops running around with the police running checkpoints now.
[03:08:10.254 --> 03:08:14.738]  I mean, it's... Foreign banks have stolen $8.5 trillion.
[03:08:17.296 --> 03:08:18.880]  In seven weeks and counting.
[03:08:18.880 --> 03:08:21.787]  I mean, and the Congress isn't allowed to know where the money went.
[03:08:21.787 --> 03:08:23.993]  I mean, what's coming next?
[03:08:23.993 --> 03:08:25.978]  We need the internet to fight these people.
[03:08:26.832 --> 03:08:28.293]  Or they'll be even bigger outrages.
[03:08:28.293 --> 03:08:31.154]  Okay, I apologize for getting him on about ten minutes late.
[03:08:31.154 --> 03:08:36.497]  We got the other guest on late as well today because I wasn't on for the first 45 minutes today.
[03:08:36.497 --> 03:08:40.459]  Russell L. Blaylock, MD, surgeon, author, lecturer, educator.
[03:08:40.459 --> 03:08:42.961]  It's russellblaylockmd.com.
[03:08:42.961 --> 03:08:46.303]  Blaylock is B-L-A-Y-L-O-C-K.
[03:08:46.303 --> 03:08:47.463]  And again, md.com.
[03:08:47.463 --> 03:08:49.804]  We have links to that up on infowars.com.
[03:08:49.804 --> 03:08:53.146]  Who knows how long he'll be able to get to his site though on the internet too.
[03:08:53.146 --> 03:08:54.167]  Sir, thank you for coming on.
[03:08:54.167 --> 03:08:55.568]  It's been many years.
[03:08:55.568 --> 03:08:56.048]  Well, thank you.
[03:08:57.083 --> 03:09:05.826]  Just out of the gate, tell us about yourself, how you woke up to Aspartame as a neurosurgeon, and what we're facing.
[03:09:05.826 --> 03:09:15.909]  Well, as a neurosurgeon, of course, most of the things I deal with are brain trauma and strokes and ruptured aneurysms, things like this, brain tumors.
[03:09:16.861 --> 03:09:32.008]  And it led into the field of excitotoxicity, which is a process that's central to virtually anything that happens to the brain, particularly brain trauma, strokes, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
[03:09:32.008 --> 03:09:42.033]  And as I discovered, the neurotransmitter responsible for most of these diseases is the glutamate transmitter.
[03:09:42.033 --> 03:09:44.234]  It's a very complex set of transmitters.
[03:09:44.855 --> 03:09:47.996]  And it's the most abundant one in the brain.
[03:09:47.996 --> 03:09:50.416]  But glutamate is very toxic to the brain.
[03:09:50.416 --> 03:09:58.438]  And so the brain has this enormously complex system to keep the levels outside of neurons very, very low.
[03:09:58.438 --> 03:10:08.140]  Well, as I got into this, I found out that, in fact, monostodium glutamate raises brain glutamate levels significantly.
[03:10:08.140 --> 03:10:12.861]  And that virtually all processed foods have some form of glutamate in it.
[03:10:13.559 --> 03:10:17.962]  And that Americans are consuming massive amounts of this.
[03:10:17.962 --> 03:10:25.408]  I wrote a book on it called Excitotoxins, The Taste That Kills, that goes into the research in quite some depth back in 1994.
[03:10:25.408 --> 03:10:34.555]  At the time, if you looked on the internet, you wouldn't find a single reference to excitotoxicity.
[03:10:34.555 --> 03:10:38.438]  Now it's virtually tens of thousands of pages.
[03:10:38.438 --> 03:10:43.202]  And if you look in the neuroscience literature, it's one of the most commonly
[03:10:47.056 --> 03:11:03.223]  Well, the interesting thing is that here's two major additives to food, the aspartame and monosodium glutamate type derivatives that are the most abundant additives in food.
[03:11:03.223 --> 03:11:08.646]  And Americans and a lot of Western countries are consuming absolutely massive amounts of it.
[03:11:10.145 --> 03:11:25.788]  Now that I've put a lot out there in the world of the science of excitotoxicity, more for the layman as well as for the scientific audience, it's woken a lot of people up.
[03:11:25.788 --> 03:11:30.069]  They realize this is not a minor problem, this is a major problem.
[03:11:30.069 --> 03:11:34.690]  Because glutamate also plays a major role in brain formation.
[03:11:34.690 --> 03:11:38.591]  So your future and the future of your children
[03:11:39.275 --> 03:11:42.076]  ...is dependent on how the brain forms.
[03:11:42.076 --> 03:11:56.121]  And we know that if you elevate glutamate levels early in development, particularly in a pregnant woman, and early in life, during that first two years after birth, you can cause significant abnormalities in brain formation.
[03:11:56.121 --> 03:11:57.781]  And that's exactly what we're seeing.
[03:11:57.781 --> 03:12:08.865]  If you compare the experimental results of this excitotoxic research with these additives, it's just what we're seeing on a massive rise in society.
[03:12:09.697 --> 03:12:13.659]  Uh, for instance, uh, the ADHD, the autism.
[03:12:13.659 --> 03:12:20.523]  Uh, we're seeing all sorts of neurodevelopmental problems, language problems, behavior problems, anxiety, depression.
[03:12:20.523 --> 03:12:25.446]  And that's MSG and a larger family of these, uh, chemicals.
[03:12:25.446 --> 03:12:33.971]  Yeah, that what the, uh, food industry has done because of this enormous amount of research pointing out this toxicity, uh, the, uh,
[03:12:34.970 --> 03:12:37.373]  FDA has allowed them to use disguised names.
[03:12:37.373 --> 03:12:44.502]  They call it hydrolyzed protein, soy protein extract, isolate, caseinate, all sorts of disguised names.
[03:12:44.502 --> 03:12:49.027]  So it's difficult for people to keep up with that list because it's never changing.
[03:12:49.027 --> 03:12:53.513]  And soon people won't be able to hear the show anymore because of YouTube and Google and Internet too.
[03:12:54.594 --> 03:12:56.996]  Only on the few AM and FM's we're on in shortwave.
[03:12:56.996 --> 03:13:00.299]  I mean, these people are destroying themselves.
[03:13:00.299 --> 03:13:00.799]  Don't worry.
[03:13:00.799 --> 03:13:07.525]  Hey, Google employees, buy your kids a big bag of Dorito Nacho Cheese MSG and just fry their brains.
[03:13:07.525 --> 03:13:08.746]  Dr. Blaylock, stay with us.
[03:13:08.746 --> 03:13:09.647]  Appreciate you joining us.
[03:13:11.485 --> 03:13:17.253]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[03:13:17.253 --> 03:13:19.537]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[03:13:19.537 --> 03:13:21.680]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[03:13:21.680 --> 03:13:25.685]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[03:13:25.685 --> 03:13:26.046]  You need
[03:13:28.183 --> 03:13:28.623]  I think so.

[03:14:10.982 --> 03:14:13.123]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:14:13.123 --> 03:14:15.544]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:14:15.544 --> 03:14:17.825]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:14:17.825 --> 03:14:19.365]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:14:19.365 --> 03:14:21.086]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:14:21.086 --> 03:14:23.787]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[03:14:23.787 --> 03:14:30.230]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFO of our country.
[03:14:34.331 --> 03:14:43.415]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:14:43.415 --> 03:14:45.916]  An inside job?
[03:14:45.916 --> 03:14:50.037]  How dare you?
[03:14:50.037 --> 03:14:53.619]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:14:53.619 --> 03:14:56.140]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:15:00.723 --> 03:15:02.805]  Truth Rising.

[03:15:07.909 --> 03:15:10.831]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:15:10.831 --> 03:15:12.252]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[03:15:12.472 --> 03:15:14.014]  December 15, 2008.
[03:15:14.014 --> 03:15:15.236]  Gold opened this morning at $828.80.
[03:15:15.236 --> 03:15:19.681]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $853.54, $426.77 for the half ounce, and $213.38 for a quarter ounce.
[03:15:19.681 --> 03:15:20.122]  That's $853.54, $426.77, and $213.38.
[03:15:27.972 --> 03:15:33.716]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[03:15:33.716 --> 03:15:38.039]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a Yan revolution.
[03:15:38.039 --> 03:15:46.164]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[03:15:46.164 --> 03:15:48.626]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[03:15:48.746 --> 03:15:52.627]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[03:15:52.627 --> 03:15:58.890]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[03:15:58.890 --> 03:16:02.291]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[03:16:02.291 --> 03:16:05.392]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[03:16:05.392 --> 03:16:05.692]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:16:05.692 --> 03:16:05.872]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:16:11.235 --> 03:16:14.516]  So you've finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[03:16:14.516 --> 03:16:17.098]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[03:16:17.098 --> 03:16:18.518]  Why settle for less?

[03:17:21.571 --> 03:17:22.351]  Hi, Dr. Blaylock.
[03:17:22.351 --> 03:17:23.412]  Long segment coming up.
[03:17:23.412 --> 03:17:24.152]  This one's short.
[03:17:24.152 --> 03:17:25.092]  Let's get into it.
[03:17:25.092 --> 03:17:31.935]  So you started discovering, as a neurosurgeon, researching the brain, what excitotoxins were and what they were doing.
[03:17:31.935 --> 03:17:33.936]  I mean, a lot of people can't eat MSG.
[03:17:33.936 --> 03:17:36.116]  They swell up red, get headaches.
[03:17:36.116 --> 03:17:39.918]  If I eat just a little bit of it, I mean, I know right away I'll get a headache.
[03:17:41.119 --> 03:17:46.644]  Well, you know, the people who react as you're describing are the lucky ones because they're not going to eat food that contains MSG.
[03:18:04.033 --> 03:18:08.195]  What happens to the majority of the people is they don't have any outward symptoms at all.
[03:18:08.195 --> 03:18:15.379]  But the destruction of neurons in the brain and the connection, the synapses and the dendrites, is an ongoing process.
[03:18:15.379 --> 03:18:19.801]  The more they eat, the higher the brain levels of the glutamate, the more destruction.
[03:18:19.801 --> 03:18:23.203]  And certain areas of the brain are more sensitive than others.
[03:18:23.203 --> 03:18:32.948]  One of the reactions that I'm working on now that's a growing area of research interest is that MSG activates the brain's immune cell called the microglia.
[03:18:33.573 --> 03:18:44.099]  And that if we look at all the neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's disease, it's this chronic activation of microglia that seems to be the central feature.
[03:18:44.099 --> 03:18:49.963]  Well, MSG readily activates this microglia style and does so for a very long period of time.
[03:18:49.963 --> 03:18:54.786]  It also produces enormous free radical generation in the brain and the entire body.
[03:18:55.718 --> 03:19:00.180]  And this is strongly correlated to these neurodegenerative diseases.
[03:19:00.180 --> 03:19:03.861]  And in childhood, as I said, it alters the development of the brain.
[03:19:03.861 --> 03:19:06.682]  So you have children who have behavioral problems.
[03:19:06.682 --> 03:19:10.524]  They become depressed, suicidal, homicidal.
[03:19:10.524 --> 03:19:15.326]  I cover this on a DVD I did called Nutrition and Behavior, which you can get off my website.
[03:19:15.326 --> 03:19:16.346]  Absolutely.
[03:19:16.346 --> 03:19:24.229]  That goes into a lot of detail of exactly how all of this works, how much we know about it, what to do about it, how to neutralize some of these effects.
[03:19:24.918 --> 03:19:31.299]  But the real shocking thing is, you know, the book Excitotoxins covers mostly what happens to the brain.
[03:19:31.299 --> 03:19:39.061]  But recently they've discovered that these glutamate receptors exist in virtually every organ and tissue in the entire body.
[03:19:39.061 --> 03:19:48.762]  And that one of the shocking things was that when you raise the glutamate levels in the blood, cancers start to grow very rapidly and become highly invasive.
[03:19:48.762 --> 03:19:52.263]  And this covers a lot of cancers, things like breast cancer,
[03:19:52.805 --> 03:20:05.530]  Lung cancer, prostate cancer, all of these cancers will grow much faster, become infinitely more deadly and invasive in the presence of high blood levels of glutamate.
[03:20:05.530 --> 03:20:13.474]  Well, humans, out of all the animal species, have the highest level of blood glutamate when you feed them glutamate.
[03:20:13.474 --> 03:20:16.755]  It's five times higher than any known animal species.
[03:20:16.755 --> 03:20:18.976]  So we are the most sensitive of anything.
[03:20:20.590 --> 03:20:39.476]  And so, when you load the food up like it's been loaded, and the investigations by the government itself showed that the blood levels in humans rise as much as 40 to 50 fold with eating foods that people commonly eat, processed foods.
[03:20:39.476 --> 03:20:46.018]  So we're getting enormous blood levels, sufficient to cause the brain lesions as well as to promote cancer growth.
[03:20:46.553 --> 03:20:49.074]  Well, then they looked at, well, what is it doing in the heart?
[03:20:49.074 --> 03:21:03.200]  Well, the heart also has an enormous number of these glutamate receptors, and factor out its entire electrical system, as well as the cardiocyte itself, the heart muscle cell.
[03:21:03.200 --> 03:21:09.482]  And that there's a strong correlation between people having sudden cardiac death, which is on the increase,
[03:21:10.354 --> 03:21:19.917]  These young people dropping dead of a heart attack, people eating a meal and soon after dropping dead of a heart attack, and unable to resuscitate them in the emergency room.
[03:21:19.917 --> 03:21:33.882]  And what they find is that if their magnesium level is low, which is very common in American society, and you feed them MSG, the heart goes into arrhythmia because of stimulating these heart glutamate receptors.
[03:21:33.882 --> 03:21:36.143]  And it's very difficult to resuscitate that person.
[03:21:37.337 --> 03:21:50.463]  Uh, and so what we're seeing is a lot of death, a lot of growth of cancer and invasion of cancer, as well as all sorts of medical problems, based on the fact our food is absolutely loaded with monosodium glutamate.
[03:21:50.463 --> 03:21:54.444]  Yeah, they're only adding more of it now, along with aspartame and other things.
[03:21:54.444 --> 03:22:00.407]  Uh, and there's a lot of medical research on this, thanks to you and others now, and I guess the system, they just don't care.
[03:22:00.407 --> 03:22:03.608]  I guess the owners of these companies shovel it in their own children's mouths.
[03:22:04.278 --> 03:22:05.900]  Well, not only that.
[03:22:05.900 --> 03:22:11.025]  I think what they do is they protect themselves and their children because they know that this is toxic.
[03:22:11.025 --> 03:22:14.308]  I mean, the literature is overwhelming.
[03:22:14.308 --> 03:22:16.950]  And so there's no question of the toxicity.
[03:22:16.950 --> 03:22:19.053]  There's no question of what I've been telling you.
[03:22:19.053 --> 03:22:22.856]  The research is enormous in this area.
[03:22:22.856 --> 03:22:23.457]  So they know.
[03:22:24.093 --> 03:22:35.460]  What they've done, they've formed the Glutamate Technical Association, which is a conglomeration of the major producers of Aspartame and MSG, which is the Dinamoto company.
[03:22:36.332 --> 03:22:38.054]  And they are a hit squad.
[03:22:38.054 --> 03:22:47.622]  Anybody who says anything about them, they bring all the forces of their corporation and their money and researchers that they buy to say that it's not true.
[03:22:47.622 --> 03:22:54.568]  And they buy a lot of advertisements and magazines and newspapers so that it'll never enter a... Alright, stay there.
[03:22:54.568 --> 03:22:55.870]  Stay there, Doctor.
[03:22:55.870 --> 03:22:59.032]  We'll come back and talk about a lot more.
[03:22:59.032 --> 03:22:59.433]  Stay with us.
[03:23:01.226 --> 03:23:05.150]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:23:05.150 --> 03:23:11.776]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:23:11.776 --> 03:23:26.650]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods, in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration, and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash, Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.

[03:24:10.694 --> 03:24:17.460]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:24:17.460 --> 03:24:20.102]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:24:20.102 --> 03:24:21.643]  But who is the enemy?
[03:24:21.643 --> 03:24:22.444]  Bin Laden.
[03:24:22.444 --> 03:24:23.385]  This is his M.O.s.
[03:24:23.385 --> 03:24:24.826]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:24:24.826 --> 03:24:26.808]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:24:26.808 --> 03:24:33.534]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:24:33.934 --> 03:24:34.414]  Some U.S.
[03:24:34.414 --> 03:24:40.776]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:24:40.776 --> 03:24:44.657]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:24:44.657 --> 03:24:54.759]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:24:54.759 --> 03:24:55.979]  Fabled enemies.

[03:25:03.762 --> 03:25:07.098]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:25:10.871 --> 03:25:19.795]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:25:19.795 --> 03:25:24.938]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:25:24.938 --> 03:25:36.063]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:25:36.463 --> 03:25:42.226]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[03:25:42.226 --> 03:25:48.490]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[03:25:48.490 --> 03:25:49.530]  What about you?

[03:26:15.189 --> 03:26:21.274]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's no doubt that Aspartame and these other excitotoxins like MSG
[03:26:23.200 --> 03:26:24.120]  It's just everywhere.
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:29.781]  And then when people get upset about it and stop buying it, they just change the name.
[03:26:29.781 --> 03:26:36.403]  You know, you can say they do this so they can sell you bad-tasting food and cover it up, but it's more than that.
[03:26:36.403 --> 03:26:40.043]  Dr. Blaylock, I mean, you're an accomplished neurosurgeon.
[03:26:40.043 --> 03:26:44.084]  You've done a lot of your own studies.
[03:26:44.084 --> 03:26:49.325]  I mean, I'm going back to the original studies with aspartame when they approved it back in the 80s, you know, killing the monkeys, as you know.
[03:26:50.635 --> 03:26:55.737]  And they know GMO food that's had the genes altered is hurting the lab animals as well.
[03:26:55.737 --> 03:26:57.058]  They just don't care.
[03:26:57.058 --> 03:27:01.279]  Where does this attitude come from and why are they doing this?
[03:27:01.279 --> 03:27:12.264]  Well, the more you look at this, you know, I've looked into this probably a lot deeper than a lot of people that are interested in food and technology and things.
[03:27:12.264 --> 03:27:15.765]  It goes back to the Rockefeller Foundation back in the 1910-1920 era.
[03:27:19.168 --> 03:27:24.052]  Uh, where they, you know, Rockefeller was obsessed with medical care.
[03:27:24.052 --> 03:27:29.897]  He was the, uh, person who was the primary financial source for the Flexner Report.
[03:27:29.897 --> 03:27:34.560]  And what the Flexner Report essentially did is took over all medical care in the United States.
[03:27:34.560 --> 03:27:38.043]  It closed down half of the medical schools in the United States.
[03:27:38.043 --> 03:27:45.509]  It, uh, appointed most of the, uh, uh, presidents of the medical universities that were allowed to subsist.
[03:27:46.341 --> 03:27:53.064]  And the foundation, the Rockefeller Ford Foundation, Carnegie Foundation, set the curriculum.
[03:27:53.064 --> 03:27:56.365]  Now, at the time, Rockefeller owned a lot of pharmaceutical companies.
[03:27:56.365 --> 03:28:07.010]  In fact, most of the major pharmaceutical companies in the world, including some foreign pharmaceutical companies like Merck, which was a German company.
[03:28:07.010 --> 03:28:15.133]  So he had a vested interest in making the curriculum in medical schools pointed mainly towards pharmaceutical solutions.
[03:28:16.680 --> 03:28:19.441]  Well, that's persisted into the present day.
[03:28:19.441 --> 03:28:33.385]  It's that we've created a medical educational curriculum throughout most of the schools that preaches certain things are considered so-called orthodox medicine.
[03:28:33.385 --> 03:28:36.926]  Everything outside of that is charlatan.
[03:28:36.926 --> 03:28:43.028]  Well, I spend an inordinate amount of time researching and looking through and reading literally thousands of
[03:28:43.635 --> 03:28:50.598]  Studies from all over the world, all reported in high quality research journals and medical journals.
[03:28:50.598 --> 03:28:55.100]  What's amazing is most of this is never seen by a practicing physician.
[03:28:55.100 --> 03:28:57.921]  They don't even know this research exists.
[03:28:57.921 --> 03:29:06.405]  When I ask my neurosurgical colleagues at meetings and such about excitotoxicity, most look at me like a deer in a headlight.
[03:29:06.405 --> 03:29:08.306]  They have no idea what I'm talking about.
[03:29:08.306 --> 03:29:12.548]  They haven't even been exposed to the word excitotoxicity.
[03:29:13.802 --> 03:29:25.829]  Now they're beginning to hear it, but they still don't understand that they're feeding their patients tons of this stuff in their diet, and it's making their neurological conditions much worse.
[03:29:25.829 --> 03:29:31.552]  And so the patients can't recover, they have seizures, all sorts of problems.
[03:29:31.552 --> 03:29:41.678]  When you look at the impact of this on American society and other societies in the world, it's absolutely enormous because it affects how the brain functions.
[03:29:42.276 --> 03:29:43.797]  Particularly it's higher function.
[03:29:43.797 --> 03:29:46.159]  That is, of drug addiction.
[03:29:46.159 --> 03:29:53.345]  We know that the centers of the brain that controls addiction are regulated by glutamate.
[03:29:53.345 --> 03:30:01.773]  And that when you stimulate these centers with glutamate, it increases your craving for all sorts of addictive impulses.
[03:30:01.773 --> 03:30:06.817]  And that if you block these glutamate receptors, people lose their addiction.
[03:30:06.817 --> 03:30:09.379]  So addiction is very strongly correlated.
[03:30:09.379 --> 03:30:10.240]  We know depression
[03:30:11.219 --> 03:30:21.786]  Now the psychiatric profession is moving into the idea that depression is primarily an excess glutamate in the brain.
[03:30:21.786 --> 03:30:36.836]  Well, here we're feeding tons and tons of glutamate to people, but we're increasing depression, anxiety, suicide, homicide, based on this psychological effect of high glutamate levels in the brain.
[03:30:36.836 --> 03:30:38.697]  This is a very hot area of research.
[03:30:39.432 --> 03:30:47.098]  And most of the drugs that seem to do the most good in combating depression have to do with blocking glutamate receptors.
[03:30:47.098 --> 03:30:49.159]  I covered this in one of my recent newsletters.
[03:30:49.159 --> 03:30:52.322]  I have a newsletter that goes into a lot of these things.
[03:30:52.322 --> 03:30:58.326]  In fact, let's stop there, Doctor, because time is, you know, running out here in the hour, and I want to have you back up for two hours in the near future.
[03:30:58.326 --> 03:31:01.088]  It's been too long, and you've got so much knowledge.
[03:31:01.088 --> 03:31:05.872]  Tell folks about the film, the books, the materials, the newsletter, and how folks can get those.
[03:31:06.929 --> 03:31:13.153]  Well, everything you can get through my website, www.russellblaylockmd.com.
[03:31:13.153 --> 03:31:36.228]  But I have a DVD on nutrition and behavior, which goes in-depth about what effect sugar has on your brain, the glutamate, how sugar produces hypoglycemia and that produces disruption of the brain, children that are bouncing off the wall, anxiety problems, school, learning difficulties, all this is connected.
[03:31:36.798 --> 03:31:43.988]  And then I go into how to correct that, what to do to combat that and improve your child's brain function and behavior.
[03:31:48.675 --> 03:31:52.737]  Which goes into a lot of different health things.
[03:31:52.737 --> 03:31:54.497]  It goes into diabetes.
[03:31:54.497 --> 03:31:58.299]  It goes into pharmaceutical effects.
[03:31:58.299 --> 03:32:00.459]  Depletion of minerals.
[03:32:00.459 --> 03:32:06.242]  It goes into ways to protect your brain against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and the effects of obesity.
[03:32:06.242 --> 03:32:10.363]  And one of the things that I made a newsletter out of was MSG.
[03:32:10.363 --> 03:32:13.644]  And of particular concern was the obesity epidemic.
[03:32:13.644 --> 03:32:17.886]  One of the earliest findings of MSG and aspartame feeding
[03:32:18.547 --> 03:32:24.191]  Of course it produces gross obesity in animals, in virtually every species.
[03:32:24.191 --> 03:32:28.554]  If you feed it early in life, that animal for the rest of its life will be obese.
[03:32:28.554 --> 03:32:30.976]  And we know the same thing happens in humans.
[03:32:30.976 --> 03:32:32.397]  And that's now happening, yeah.
[03:32:32.397 --> 03:32:40.383]  I mean, we have this obesity epidemic, though I've read the studies that Americans really are eating more than we ate 30-40 years ago, except we've got all these toxins.
[03:32:40.383 --> 03:32:46.928]  And doesn't the MSG and aspartame block the chemicals in the brain that let us know we're full?
[03:32:48.413 --> 03:32:55.798]  Well, what it primarily does, it damages an area of the hypothalamus called the archaic nucleus, where leptin operates.
[03:32:55.798 --> 03:33:00.661]  Leptin is what helps you burn off fat and it helps control your appetite.
[03:33:00.661 --> 03:33:09.947]  So when you destroy that center of your brain in the hypothalamus, you begin to gain weight, even eating a very low-calorie diet.
[03:33:09.947 --> 03:33:12.008]  It's almost impossible to control your weight.
[03:33:13.417 --> 03:33:13.938]  I think so.
[03:33:31.345 --> 03:33:41.469]  Well, there are 45 million Americans who now have metabolic syndrome, one of the most rapidly accelerating diseases in Western society.
[03:33:41.469 --> 03:33:48.232]  And we can directly link it to this massive consumption of glutamate and aspartame.
[03:33:48.232 --> 03:33:51.914]  It will produce the exact syndrome in animals.
[03:33:51.914 --> 03:33:54.875]  The obesity, the hypertension.
[03:33:54.875 --> 03:33:56.576]  How do you know that area is destroyed?
[03:33:56.576 --> 03:33:58.717]  I mean, I had a lot of MSG growing up as a child.
[03:33:58.717 --> 03:33:59.117]  What do I do?
[03:34:00.413 --> 03:34:03.534]  Well, it depends on your antioxidants.
[03:34:03.534 --> 03:34:08.336]  It depends on your diet, which will help protect you to some degree.
[03:34:08.336 --> 03:34:11.597]  But there's a lot of things you can do nutritionally to help repair these things.
[03:34:11.597 --> 03:34:21.361]  Because one of the primary events of excitotoxicity is, rather than just killing cells, is it destroys a lot of the synaptic connections, which you can repair.
[03:34:22.499 --> 03:34:24.581]  By changing your diet, getting the MSG out.
[03:34:24.581 --> 03:34:26.983]  Because the brain's always trying to rewire, right?
[03:34:26.983 --> 03:34:28.404]  Yeah, it's called plasticity.
[03:34:28.404 --> 03:34:33.647]  We have brain plasticity from conception all the way up to the age of 100.
[03:34:33.647 --> 03:34:38.931]  They did a study on people in their 100 and found the same plasticity was taking place.
[03:34:38.931 --> 03:34:41.814]  This massive repair of damage.
[03:34:41.814 --> 03:34:47.698]  The problem is, as you pointed out, is we're inundated with so many toxins and bad diet
[03:34:48.303 --> 03:34:50.144]  That we can't repair it.
[03:34:50.144 --> 03:34:53.326]  We're just constantly damaging it over and over and over.
[03:34:53.326 --> 03:34:59.090]  Doctor, haven't they also found that these excitotoxins are addictive?
[03:34:59.090 --> 03:34:59.590]  Absolutely.
[03:34:59.590 --> 03:35:05.634]  As I said, it seems to operate the part of the brain that has to do with addiction.
[03:35:05.634 --> 03:35:11.438]  So that when you raise glutamate levels in the brain, it's much easier to produce addiction.
[03:35:11.438 --> 03:35:13.299]  And it's very difficult to overcome addiction.
[03:35:14.268 --> 03:35:20.392]  So, you know, and the drugs we know that help fight addiction are the ones that reduce brain glutamate.
[03:35:20.392 --> 03:35:24.695]  But I was going to go on to say, but it's the glutamates themselves that are addictive too, correct?
[03:35:25.856 --> 03:35:29.178]  Well, because the glutamate is the neurotransmitter in the brain that's doing it.
[03:35:29.178 --> 03:35:33.861]  When you take MSG, it's the glutamate part of it, not the monosodium.
[03:35:33.861 --> 03:35:38.985]  It's the glutamate that is in the brain stimulating these receptors that produce the problem.
[03:35:56.436 --> 03:36:14.908]  Or foundation money to just take over industries and I mean I was blown away by the 40s how many hospitals were directly owned through fake charities by the Rockefellers and all this and of course you know they're eugenicists they're in the population reduction they were the big eugenicists that funded it all here in the United States.
[03:36:14.908 --> 03:36:20.292]  Dr. Broilock from your research I mean is this is this being done on purpose cold-bloodedly?
[03:36:21.525 --> 03:36:24.727]  Oh, absolutely, and there's several good books written about it.
[03:36:24.727 --> 03:36:42.897]  One is a history of molecular biology in the United States, which says that the Rockefeller's purpose for funding medical care and for funding research in molecular biology was because they wanted to find a way for social control.
[03:36:42.897 --> 03:36:46.639]  They first tried eugenics, as you said, in the early 20s.
[03:36:46.639 --> 03:36:50.321]  They were the major funders of eugenics in the United States.
[03:36:51.673 --> 03:36:58.096]  And if you have such bad publicity, they dropped it, and then they got together with their scientists that there was a better way.
[03:36:58.096 --> 03:37:06.200]  Maybe altering genes and regulating, changing the regulators of cell function and brain function, and then we can initiate social control.
[03:37:06.200 --> 03:37:14.783]  So this history of molecular biology tech goes into great detail, says that was their motivation was social control.
[03:37:14.783 --> 03:37:18.405]  Well, that is controlling the peasant.
[03:37:18.405 --> 03:37:20.326]  So they'll do what you tell them to do.
[03:37:21.147 --> 03:37:23.928]  And of course it's all collectivism, as you said.
[03:37:23.928 --> 03:37:32.090]  And that is, you have private giant megacorporations who are in link with government to control all of society.
[03:37:32.090 --> 03:37:36.571]  And the idea of collectivism is to produce the United States as one giant corporation.
[03:37:40.689 --> 03:37:48.414]  Attack people's brains, their reproductive centers, everything, and then just devastate us, and just cold-bloodedly doing it.
[03:37:48.414 --> 03:37:58.059]  Well, if you read the history of the Rockefellers, you see they started wars, they did all sorts of things to gain oil contraction and to get to Saudi Arabia.
[03:37:58.059 --> 03:38:08.225]  You know, they were the ones that made the deal with the Soviets to get to Saudi Arabia and oil fields, and they were funding communism to the tune of billions.
[03:38:08.823 --> 03:38:30.276]  Building their military, it was all carefully documented in the Anthony Sutton series of books, showing that they funded the entire communist military and the communist operations purely to get deals to get the Caucasian oil fields and the Saudi Arabian oil fields, as well as the Chinese oil fields.
[03:38:30.276 --> 03:38:35.579]  You know, Rockefeller was the primary funder of the Institute for Pacific Relations, which was the
[03:38:36.442 --> 03:38:38.206]  Uh, propaganda network.
[03:38:38.206 --> 03:38:40.330]  It worked through our government back in the 1930s and 40s.
[03:38:42.686 --> 03:38:49.471]  Uh, to engineer the fall of China, uh, to the Chinese Communists, so that Rockefeller could get the oil fields.
[03:38:49.471 --> 03:38:51.592]  And by the way, that's now declassified.
[03:38:51.592 --> 03:38:53.053]  It's even on History Channel.
[03:38:53.053 --> 03:38:54.194]  I mean, this is so sick.
[03:38:54.194 --> 03:38:56.316]  Well, that's what Quigley wrote, as you know.
[03:38:56.316 --> 03:39:02.220]  But, you know, he bragged at Georgetown that they fund the fascists and the communists, and now they're doing it here.
[03:39:02.220 --> 03:39:06.623]  They are just so ruthless, and the public has no idea how much attack they're under.
[03:39:07.475 --> 03:39:14.001]  Well, they had no compassion for the millions of people who died in both World Wars.
[03:39:14.001 --> 03:39:16.744]  No compassion for the people dying in Korea.
[03:39:16.744 --> 03:39:28.274]  People don't know that during the entire Korean War, the Rockefeller family was supplying all the oil used for the jets in North Korea to kill our soldiers.
[03:39:28.274 --> 03:39:31.718]  You know, this has been going on since the 1910s.
[03:39:34.294 --> 03:39:38.582]  Uh, so they have been major funders of the enemies of the United States.
[03:39:38.582 --> 03:39:43.011]  They have taken over our government through the Council on Foreign Relations Trilateral Commission.
[03:39:43.957 --> 03:39:52.020]  Uh, and a lot of this is linked to what I'm talking about with these food additives and drugs is because that's also how to control the population.
[03:39:52.020 --> 03:39:56.541]  Oh, the public, it's not just that they're ignorant, they really are brain damaged.
[03:39:56.541 --> 03:39:57.001]  Sure.
[03:39:57.001 --> 03:40:08.385]  And there's no critical thinking, uh, it's just, and folks, if you've still got your brains, you know, intact, or if you can even hazily understand what I'm saying here, you can heal yourself and get your brain back.
[03:40:09.025 --> 03:40:10.526]  Well, I only eat foods that are fresh.
[03:40:10.526 --> 03:40:11.527]  I don't eat any processed food.
[03:40:25.966 --> 03:40:31.087]  Avoid all of these gravies and sauces that they make commercially.
[03:40:31.087 --> 03:40:34.968]  I don't eat any Doritos or any of this junk food.
[03:40:34.968 --> 03:40:37.749]  It's all fresh food, freshly made.
[03:40:37.749 --> 03:40:41.290]  A lot of vegetables, fruits that are fresh.
[03:40:41.290 --> 03:40:45.391]  Try to stay away from anything that's GMO.
[03:40:45.391 --> 03:40:51.572]  So, you know, you can do it and what you find out is you correct your diet, your thinking clears up.
[03:40:52.225 --> 03:41:06.490]  You can think with a very clear mind, your language function improves, your memory improves, and then you can use some supplements to even stimulate repair of some of this damage to the brain and the rest of the body.
[03:41:06.490 --> 03:41:11.572]  So now they're moving in wanting to radiate all the meat, even radiate all the vegetables.
[03:41:11.572 --> 03:41:12.952]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:41:12.952 --> 03:41:18.034]  Well, the other arm of it is not only that, but then they want to take away the supplement.
[03:41:18.034 --> 03:41:20.375]  They want to outlaw the entire supplement industry.
[03:41:21.315 --> 03:41:23.237]  They have absolute control of it.
[03:41:23.237 --> 03:41:39.449]  I keep telling the people in the alternative medicine field, you know, what's going to happen is they're going to turn these major producers of the supplements over to the major pharmaceutical companies, and only doctors can prescribe supplements.
[03:41:39.449 --> 03:41:44.953]  Because they know that these supplements aren't exceeding anything that medicine has to offer.
[03:41:44.953 --> 03:41:45.574]  They know that.
[03:41:46.152 --> 03:41:52.715]  What they know now is that they can't make these prescription drugs, so they can't control the price.
[03:41:52.715 --> 03:41:59.277]  But if government says only physicians can prescribe them, then they become pharmaceutical drugs.
[03:41:59.944 --> 03:42:07.246]  And that the price of them will increase astronomically, and suddenly you'll see a shift in what these people say.
[03:42:07.246 --> 03:42:13.989]  Instead of attacking the natural supplements, they'll say that it's the greatest find that medicine has ever made.
[03:42:13.989 --> 03:42:19.931]  But they don't want us to be healthy, and the doctors are ignorant and compartmentalized.
[03:42:19.931 --> 03:42:24.172]  Well, the doctors won't know how to prescribe it, because doctors don't know anything about any of it.
[03:42:25.140 --> 03:42:30.464]  You know, most of the doctors know absolutely nothing about any of what I've told you.
[03:42:30.464 --> 03:42:32.366]  They know almost nothing about diet.
[03:42:32.366 --> 03:42:35.388]  They know almost nothing about any supplement.
[03:42:35.388 --> 03:42:44.495]  They're so heavily and badly brain-damaged themselves, and so propagandized by it, they just don't understand.
[03:42:44.495 --> 03:42:45.536]  They refuse to read it.
[03:42:45.536 --> 03:42:48.378]  They refuse to look at it.
[03:42:48.378 --> 03:42:54.763]  And, you know, as we move into full socialized medicine, it will be against the law for them
[03:42:57.385 --> 03:42:59.448]  That's what I was about to say.
[03:42:59.448 --> 03:43:06.478]  All this socialized medicine means they'll control every aspect of what a doctor can do and have total control over you.
[03:43:06.478 --> 03:43:11.365]  Doctor, we're out of time because there's a short segment at the end and I'm going to cover some final news.
[03:43:12.026 --> 03:43:16.948]  You know, I really appreciate you spending time with us and I forgot how important all your information is.
[03:43:16.948 --> 03:43:18.389]  Do you have your book in front of you?
[03:43:18.389 --> 03:43:29.934]  Is there any way I can hear on air, set you up for like an hour and a half, two hours, maybe early next week before Christmas or after Christmas the next week?
[03:43:29.934 --> 03:43:31.535]  Probably best after Christmas.
[03:43:32.930 --> 03:43:33.591]  Fantastic.
[03:43:33.591 --> 03:43:41.836]  Well, what we'll do is then, how about January 3rd or 4th, 5th, something like that, have you on for a couple hours and then we can take calls.
[03:43:41.836 --> 03:43:46.420]  Because your knowledge and breadth of knowledge is so wide, Dr. Blaylock, I really want to pick your brain.
[03:43:46.420 --> 03:43:49.062]  Yeah, January 5th, I'll look at it.
[03:43:49.062 --> 03:43:53.044]  Just have your person contact me and we'll firm that up.
[03:43:54.255 --> 03:43:54.836]  Well, thank you.
[03:43:54.836 --> 03:44:00.622]  Folks can check out your fine research and materials at RussellBlaylockMD.com.
[03:44:00.622 --> 03:44:01.944]  Is there a number we should give out, too?
[03:44:01.944 --> 03:44:03.706]  Uh, no.
[03:44:03.706 --> 03:44:05.728]  Okay, thank you so much for the time.
[03:44:05.728 --> 03:44:06.970]  Let me say bye to you here off-air.
[03:44:12.026 --> 03:44:14.326]  Hello, I'm Steve Schenck.
[03:44:14.326 --> 03:44:17.807]  We're entering a holiday season never before seen in America.
[03:44:17.807 --> 03:44:26.649]  We're thankful for the warning given by members of Mr. Obama's campaign team of the coming international incident which will force unpopular decisions.
[03:44:26.649 --> 03:44:36.830]  Without this warning, many of us who still have money available would have unknowingly wasted it on Christmas gifts that will be useless when the only food available is in a government breadline.
[03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:40.571]  When the President is faced with the expected national security incident,
[03:44:41.011 --> 03:44:45.672]  The in-place Patriot legislation will control transport and distribution of food.
[03:44:45.672 --> 03:44:50.014]  Those of us who are able to take care of ourselves must put in supplies of food.
[03:44:50.014 --> 03:44:56.136]  This will free up the relief organizations to give food to those unable or not smart enough to prepare.
[03:44:56.136 --> 03:44:59.297]  The greatest gift this Christmas is life itself.
[03:44:59.297 --> 03:45:01.637]  Food for these unknown times.
[03:45:01.637 --> 03:45:01.938]  Call 800-409-5633.
[03:45:01.938 --> 03:45:03.038]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.

[03:45:17.640 --> 03:45:19.541]  The truth story of the Bilderberg Group.
[03:45:19.541 --> 03:45:21.042]  The late great USA.
[03:45:21.042 --> 03:45:22.803]  America, freedom to fascism.
[03:45:22.803 --> 03:45:29.828]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[03:46:56.088 --> 03:46:56.409]  I think.
[03:47:23.039 --> 03:47:27.282]  Alright, it is the final segment here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:47:36.647 --> 03:47:39.668]  And there's a lot of news I got to, a lot of news I didn't cover.
[03:47:39.668 --> 03:47:43.910]  That radio station's tried to fax us a few times, the Marine Corps press release.
[03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:46.891]  Of course our fax machine was broken.
[03:47:46.891 --> 03:47:54.314]  So we're trying to do an e-fax, that'll be up in a story Kurt Nemo's already written about the Marines.
[03:47:54.314 --> 03:48:01.097]  So we'll have that available soon up at... up at... Oh, we did just get the fax?
[03:48:01.097 --> 03:48:02.438]  Okay, we did just get it.
[03:48:02.438 --> 03:48:04.919]  So Aaron, will you get that posted Nemo story he wrote about it?
[03:48:05.737 --> 03:48:06.277]  Great job.
[03:48:06.277 --> 03:48:07.777]  Thank you, my friend.
[03:48:07.777 --> 03:48:12.718]  Yeah, here it is, the Marines saying the Marines would be involved.
[03:48:12.718 --> 03:48:13.359]  U.S.
[03:48:13.359 --> 03:48:16.899]  Marine Corps involved at the checkpoints, and now they've tried to back off of this.
[03:48:16.899 --> 03:48:19.620]  And then they lied and said they weren't there, and then it turned out they were there.
[03:48:19.620 --> 03:48:23.401]  So, that's coming up, by the way, in the rebroadcast.
[03:48:23.401 --> 03:48:28.482]  In the last three or four minutes I've got, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[03:48:28.482 --> 03:48:29.142]  Ted Anderson.
[03:48:31.034 --> 03:48:36.698]  Uh, bought gold, I don't know, two and a half, three weeks ago, a whole bunch of it, when gold was at $740.
[03:48:38.755 --> 03:48:43.676]  It's now at above $8.30 today and rising.
[03:48:43.676 --> 03:48:48.997]  And we've got all these pundits and experts on TV saying $1,500 to $2,000 in the next few months.
[03:48:48.997 --> 03:48:50.637]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[03:48:50.637 --> 03:48:52.878]  I just know gold is way undervalued.
[03:48:52.878 --> 03:48:59.979]  And again, Ted got so much gold that this is the very tail end of it.
[03:48:59.979 --> 03:49:04.120]  Ted, you said of gold at that price, all you have left is British sovereigns and what else?
[03:49:04.591 --> 03:49:07.152]  Well, I got the British Sovereign and I have the Frank.
[03:49:07.152 --> 03:49:10.194]  The $10 Indians, the $10 Liberties are sold out.
[03:49:10.194 --> 03:49:14.296]  The $5 gold pieces that I had hidden in here, they're sold out as well.
[03:49:14.296 --> 03:49:24.080]  I do have the British Sovereigns, I have the Franks, and I came into something that is really interesting that I haven't seen in a long time, and that's the Vienna Philharmonic, the one ounce coins there.
[03:49:24.080 --> 03:49:25.801]  I only have 80 of them, total, 80.
[03:49:27.682 --> 03:49:29.564]  Did you sell out of those Buffaloes?
[03:49:29.564 --> 03:49:30.866]  The Buffaloes did go.
[03:49:30.866 --> 03:49:31.827]  They're gone.
[03:49:31.827 --> 03:49:36.652]  But the Vienna Philharmonic is a coin just like that that's in total demand.
[03:49:36.652 --> 03:49:40.817]  And the Buffaloes were over a thousand bucks a piece, where these Philharmonics are only $9.67.
[03:49:42.659 --> 03:49:43.259]  That's a great deal.
[03:49:43.259 --> 03:49:44.079]  So let's explain.
[03:49:44.079 --> 03:49:45.500]  Everywhere else gold's at a premium.
[03:49:45.500 --> 03:49:46.660]  You can't even find it.
[03:49:46.660 --> 03:49:50.141]  There's a 30-40% premium on it, above spot price.
[03:49:50.141 --> 03:49:53.062]  Ted bought gold at $740 an ounce.
[03:49:53.062 --> 03:49:55.562]  That's the price that's priced into these coins.
[03:49:55.562 --> 03:50:00.744]  And on the Sovereigns, on the Franks, the best coins you can buy, he still has it at the $740 level.
[03:50:01.784 --> 03:50:04.186]  Now, you have 80 of the Philharmonics left.
[03:50:04.186 --> 03:50:07.148]  How many of the Franks and the Sovereigns do you have?
[03:50:07.148 --> 03:50:09.951]  Because, you know, when you first did that buy, you had like 10, 15 coins.
[03:50:09.951 --> 03:50:11.832]  You're down to, what, 3 coins now.
[03:50:11.832 --> 03:50:12.433]  3 different offers.
[03:50:12.433 --> 03:50:13.414]  What do you have left, Ted?
[03:50:13.414 --> 03:50:15.635]  Yeah, what I have left are the British Sovereigns.
[03:50:15.635 --> 03:50:16.756]  They're currently right now at 242.
[03:50:16.756 --> 03:50:17.957]  My new gold hit a high today of 848.
[03:50:17.957 --> 03:50:18.177]  Oh, okay.
[03:50:18.177 --> 03:50:18.518]  I'm sorry.
[03:50:18.518 --> 03:50:18.538]  848.
[03:50:18.538 --> 03:50:19.158]  So we're talking $108.
[03:50:19.158 --> 03:50:20.299]  You're selling this for $108.
[03:50:20.299 --> 03:50:22.661]  I mean, you bought this at $108 under what it is right now.
[03:50:31.368 --> 03:50:32.288]  Yep, that's right.
[03:50:32.288 --> 03:50:36.370]  And then you've got the Franks, they're at $195, they're at that same price level.
[03:50:36.370 --> 03:50:49.375]  And in addition to this, those gold Philharmonics are almost $100 less than the Buffalos, and they're equally as scarce, equally as rare, and certainly as much desired as far as a coin is concerned.
[03:50:49.375 --> 03:50:53.336]  So basically you're getting a beautiful collector coin at basically bullion prices.
[03:50:53.536 --> 03:50:54.777]  Well, that's what's going on here.
[03:50:54.777 --> 03:51:02.340]  You're getting the coins right at the melt value, or at or near that, especially those... Look, look, look, here at the end of the show, I just want to tell the listeners something.
[03:51:02.340 --> 03:51:03.281]  This is a great deal.
[03:51:03.281 --> 03:51:05.261]  For those of you that don't know the gold business, check it out.
[03:51:05.261 --> 03:51:05.782]  It's a great deal.
[03:51:05.782 --> 03:51:08.443]  For those that do, you know how good a deal this is.
[03:51:08.443 --> 03:51:09.844]  How long can you offer this, Ted?
[03:51:09.844 --> 03:51:14.626]  Well, the British Sovereigns... I'm sorry, the Philharmonics will be sold out after 80 coins.
[03:51:14.626 --> 03:51:16.146]  I can't do 81.
[03:51:16.146 --> 03:51:19.228]  The British Sovereigns and the Franks will hold that right through midnight.
[03:51:19.528 --> 03:51:20.809]  Alright, here's the number.
[03:51:20.809 --> 03:51:23.591]  800-686-2237.
[03:51:23.591 --> 03:51:26.933]  800-686-2237.
[03:51:26.933 --> 03:51:28.194]  Please give the brokers a call.
[03:51:28.194 --> 03:51:30.235]  They'll be there till midnight tonight.
[03:51:30.235 --> 03:51:32.096]  First come, first serve on the Philharmonics.
[03:51:32.096 --> 03:51:32.536]  800-686-2237.
[03:51:32.536 --> 03:51:32.576]  800-686-2237.
[03:51:38.380 --> 03:51:39.781]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:51:39.781 --> 03:51:40.562]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:52:01.325 --> 03:52:08.067]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:52:08.067 --> 03:52:10.707]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:52:10.707 --> 03:52:12.268]  But who is the enemy?
[03:52:12.268 --> 03:52:13.048]  Bin Laden.
[03:52:13.048 --> 03:52:14.008]  This is his ammo.
[03:52:14.008 --> 03:52:15.429]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:52:15.429 --> 03:52:17.409]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:52:17.409 --> 03:52:24.151]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:52:24.551 --> 03:52:25.052]  Some U.S.
[03:52:25.052 --> 03:52:31.397]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:52:31.397 --> 03:52:34.899]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:52:34.899 --> 03:52:45.388]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:52:45.388 --> 03:52:46.609]  Fabled enemies.
