[07:58.700 --> 08:04.700]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[08:04.700 --> 08:11.700]  it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:11.700 --> 08:18.700]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[08:18.700 --> 08:22.700]  Alex Jones
[08:22.700 --> 08:34.700]  leading from Wikipedia General Hamid Gould served as director general Pakistan's inner service intelligence ISI during 87-89 mainly in the time when
[08:34.700 --> 08:41.700]  minister Budo was prime minister of Pakistan he was instrumental in the anti-Soviet support of the Mujahideen and the Afghan war
[08:41.700 --> 08:50.700]  79-89 a pivotal time during the Cold War and the step and it goes on and we have him online with us we of course yesterday played the CNN
[08:50.700 --> 08:58.700]  TV interview he did it was heavily edited this is live and is not edited going back to him in Pakistan we've tried three different lines
[08:58.700 --> 09:06.700]  this is the best one we have we apologize our audio was not loud to him is not very audible and obviously his audio back to us is very
[09:06.700 --> 09:10.700]  very broken up but we nevertheless have him joining us we're very thankful
[09:10.700 --> 09:20.700]  sir continuing on the CNN program at least what they edited you to say you talked about 9-11 the evidence being that 9-11 was an inside job
[09:20.700 --> 09:30.700]  and the attacks in Bombay now Mumbai a few weeks ago that the evidence was it was an inside job can you go over the evidence that you believe that
[09:30.700 --> 09:35.700]  these are false flag events sir and why these false flag events are being staged
[09:35.700 --> 09:44.700]  are you talking about 9-11 yes sir well I have my own reason you know Rod Norland was the senior reporter here
[09:44.700 --> 09:55.700]  I think he was based in Islam was at that time and he came to me immediately after 9-11 and his version that that I put out
[09:55.700 --> 10:04.700]  it was given to the Newsweek and unfortunately it was blocked but it appeared on the internet on the website of the Newsweek
[10:04.700 --> 10:13.700]  and you can see it I think it is dated 16th or 17th of September 2001 and in that I had said the same thing
[10:13.700 --> 10:25.700]  and I still maintain that that's my position I have following reasons for it a that 9-11 took place on the American soil
[10:25.700 --> 10:35.700]  not a single person has been caught inside America even though for doing such a job I think a huge amount of logistic support is required in the area
[10:35.700 --> 10:46.700]  where such operation is carried out secondly the air traffic control when they saw that 4 air transports were changing direction
[10:46.700 --> 10:53.700]  going from east coast to west coast where they were headed they started traveling in different directions
[10:53.700 --> 11:01.700]  and it is quite amazing that for a very long period of time the air traffic control did not report this
[11:01.700 --> 11:11.700]  nor did the US Air Force act in time if one were to calculate from the first flight when it took off from Logan
[11:11.700 --> 11:25.700]  until the first aircraft and the solitary aircraft that took off was an F-16 which took off from Langley which is CIO's headquarter instead of one of the operational bases
[11:25.700 --> 11:35.700]  so many of them are available in that area and then a single aircraft never takes off because we have been told that whenever the aircraft trembled
[11:35.700 --> 11:47.700]  they trembled in two and the time that it took was enormous it was 112 minutes so 112 minutes is a very long time in which to act
[11:47.700 --> 11:53.700]  was the US Air Force sleeping and if it was sleeping which heads were rolled
[11:53.700 --> 12:04.700]  second it was a huge intelligence failure and no heads have been rolled nobody has been taken to task not a single person has resigned for this
[12:04.700 --> 12:13.700]  thirdly the air traffic control should have been rehashed they should have been turned inside out but nothing of the sort happened
[12:13.700 --> 12:26.700]  and finally how come this is a coincidence that four transponders did not work and it is not possible the direction is changed and it is not noted
[12:26.700 --> 12:35.700]  secondly the US Air Force has the ability because in the past whenever a plane has been hijacked
[12:35.700 --> 12:46.700]  the record is that within seven minutes the US aircraft has been on the wing of the hijacked aircraft in this case it did not happen
[12:46.700 --> 12:58.700]  the US alert system is so high and it is so sophisticated that if a missile was to take off from Moscow and was to head towards New York
[12:58.700 --> 13:08.700]  it takes about 18 minutes and the US Air Force and the missile system is supposed to intercept it within nine minutes
[13:08.700 --> 13:14.700]  that means on the Atlantic or on the Pacific it must stop that missile from coming in
[13:14.700 --> 13:20.700]  the system is in place but it did not work and nobody tried to question this
[13:20.700 --> 13:30.700]  lastly no inquiry has so far been held formally into the incident and the whole world has been turned upside down so many people have been killed
[13:30.700 --> 13:40.700]  American economy is going into a meltdown and everything has gone wrong with the world and yet no formal inquiry has been ordered by the US government
[13:40.700 --> 13:45.700]  so I really don't know there are so many questions which hang in the balance
[13:45.700 --> 13:54.700]  and then to stop it all they say that Adam Muhammad who took training on a light aircraft in Miami for six months
[13:54.700 --> 14:04.700]  he could have maneuvered a jumbo 74757 from a height where it was travelling
[14:04.700 --> 14:12.700]  the height was 9000 and it came within seconds to a height of 1000 and then went straight into its target
[14:12.700 --> 14:20.700]  now this is not possible for a person who has been trained on a light aircraft to be able to do this
[14:20.700 --> 14:26.700]  and there is no mention of the second aircraft so there are number of things which remain unanswered
[14:26.700 --> 14:34.700]  yes whenever the journalists come and visit me here and I ask them these questions that why haven't you taken the answers about this
[14:34.700 --> 14:40.700]  they say that patriotic act comes in the way and we are not supposed to ask such questions
[14:40.700 --> 14:48.700]  general we are talking to general Hamed Gould the former head of Pakistani ISI during the key period fighting the Russians
[14:48.700 --> 14:56.700]  he was also before he was the head of ISI one of the chiefs according to our media running operations against the Russians
[14:56.700 --> 15:01.700]  and of course working with the United States closely as well as the Saudi Arabians and the British
[15:01.700 --> 15:10.700]  and that's incorrect correct me general Gould what are the motives we have PNAC with Dick Cheney saying they need a Pearl Harbor event
[15:10.700 --> 15:19.700]  we have 44,000 US troops massing into Jikistan and Uzbekistan in the days before 9-11 we have Bush on September 10th
[15:19.700 --> 15:27.700]  Newsweek reported ordering the launch of attacks the next week we have of course the buildings being blown up with explosives
[15:27.700 --> 15:35.700]  and all of the witnesses to that now the government admits that building 7 did fall in free fall was not hit by a plane
[15:35.700 --> 15:41.700]  specifically sir motives why would the military industrial complex controlling the United States
[15:41.700 --> 15:45.700]  why would they stage a 9-11 attack
[15:45.700 --> 15:57.700]  well I think after the Cold War when the economic was known as the inflation was very high and the domestic issues had to be addressed
[15:57.700 --> 16:06.700]  but Bill Clinton 2-10 years they really amassed a lot of money American economy went booming and he left a lot of money
[16:06.700 --> 16:13.700]  and the hard-boiled Cold Warriors when they came in they found that the situation was ready
[16:13.700 --> 16:23.700]  they had money and they had resources and they looked upon now the conquest of the world for which there was an opportunity window
[16:23.700 --> 16:30.700]  the Muslim world was lying cross-state Russia was not still picking up from its foreign position
[16:30.700 --> 16:37.700]  China was not ready yet and therefore they looked upon it as an opportunity to go and do the following
[16:37.700 --> 16:45.700]  and in this I am a soldier and I know that there has to be a single aim but they mixed up the aims and they have bought up everything
[16:45.700 --> 16:56.700]  first they said that they would go into such strategic areas where there was no US presence before such as the western Asia and south Asia
[16:56.700 --> 17:01.700]  where there was no American physical presence and they wanted it there
[17:01.700 --> 17:06.700]  they had to keep the Chinese off from getting into the Middle East
[17:06.700 --> 17:12.700]  they had to lay their hand on the energy tap of the world which presently lies in the Middle East
[17:12.700 --> 17:18.700]  but in future it will be in Central Asia and so Afghanistan is the gateway to Central Asia
[17:18.700 --> 17:25.700]  and finally to suppress any resistance particularly which could threaten the state of Israel
[17:25.700 --> 17:32.700]  now that is where they instead of pursuing the American objective they started pursuing the Israeli objective
[17:32.700 --> 17:39.700]  and that is where they went wrong you have to pick up a single aim this is the first principle of war
[17:39.700 --> 17:46.700]  and I don't know why the generals and the politicians of America they could be so naive and so ignorant
[17:46.700 --> 17:57.700]  that they started mixing aims and they went into this war without wisdom, without particular preparation
[17:57.700 --> 18:05.700]  and without the American support behind them because if they had gone to vote and asked for support from the American people
[18:05.700 --> 18:12.700]  they would have never given this support so they had to create a pretext and this was the pretext that they created
[18:12.700 --> 18:17.700]  General we are going to break in a moment and come back with a final segment perhaps I can get you to stay a little bit longer
[18:17.700 --> 18:22.700]  because I want you to be able to speak unedited to the American people and the people of the world
[18:22.700 --> 18:26.700]  I want to shift gears into Mumbai what happened in India
[18:26.700 --> 18:37.700]  clearly the evidence of even the Indian intelligence chief as you know was saying that the Indian government was staging terror attacks on the train
[18:37.700 --> 18:45.700]  an army captain was caught doing that and arrested the chief of anti-terror was threatened he was killed that day when it started in Mumbai
[18:45.700 --> 18:53.700]  now they have caught a anti-terror police officer giving cell phones to the supposed terrorists that they are saying came from Pakistan
[18:53.700 --> 19:00.700]  we know the west is deeply in bed with some of the blocks of the former Mujahideen
[19:00.700 --> 19:02.700]  can you speak to that?
[19:06.700 --> 19:07.700]  General?
[19:07.700 --> 19:11.700]  Can you hear me? I can't hear you properly but can you hear me alright?
[19:11.700 --> 19:18.700]  Yes sir I can hear you when we come back we will speak to what happened in India did you hear that?
[19:18.700 --> 19:19.700]  Yes yes yes yes
[19:19.700 --> 19:26.700]  good why they are staging terror attacks there the evidence of false flag inside job in India
[19:26.700 --> 19:31.700]  so when we return after this quick break with the former head of Pakistani intelligence
[19:31.700 --> 19:41.700]  General Hamid Ghul joining us from Pakistan I am coming to you from Austin, Texas hence the phone troubles will work on those sir

[21:07.700 --> 21:12.700]  bin Laden we have to look to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden

[21:20.700 --> 21:26.700]  some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[21:26.700 --> 21:30.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[21:30.700 --> 21:36.700]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection

[24:46.700 --> 24:54.700]  I listed earlier the fact that Indian intelligence captains in the army have been caught in India staging bombings
[24:54.700 --> 25:04.700]  that's Indian news that Indian intelligence and police have been caught giving cell phones to the supposed shooters the police stood down
[25:04.700 --> 25:12.700]  and only the anti-terror commanders that had said that India was staging terror they were killed in the initiation of the attacks in Mumbai
[25:12.700 --> 25:21.700]  that's some of the evidence of Mumbai being an inside job namely why do you believe Mumbai is a staged event two weeks ago a and b
[25:21.700 --> 25:23.700]  what is the motive
[25:23.700 --> 25:34.700]  well the motive is very simple that Americans want Indians to come on board with them in their war against terror especially when they run out of troops
[25:34.700 --> 25:44.700]  in Afghanistan the NATO allies are pulling out they are dragging their feet they are not prepared to fight there but they want to make it an Indian call
[25:44.700 --> 25:56.700]  and they want nearly 150,000 troops in Afghanistan that is one reason where there is an American motive there is an Israel motive
[25:56.700 --> 26:06.700]  which is similar that the Americans should not pull out of Afghanistan just because they are sort of troops so they must have more troops there
[26:06.700 --> 26:17.700]  because if they go away without denuclearizing Pakistan state of Israel will remain in under perpetual danger so they have an innate fear
[26:17.700 --> 26:27.700]  that Americans may lose heart and pull out of this region they are already going out of Iraq and if they were to go out of Afghanistan as well
[26:27.700 --> 26:33.700]  this will be an unfinished agenda and that Israel would be at the losing end
[26:33.700 --> 26:48.700]  so the Neocons and the Zionists they together want to have a conspiracy so that Obama gets trapped into a situation where for next four years he will keep on sorting out this
[26:48.700 --> 27:04.700]  embryo as far as the ability is concerned which is the other element can you imagine that people traveling from Karachi in two rickety boats they can travel all the way to Bombay and then go into action immediately
[27:04.700 --> 27:15.700]  and fight a battle for 72 hours and they are just 10 of them and in each group there were two this is impossible they were carrying so much of munitions with them
[27:15.700 --> 27:30.700]  and that munitions lasted they were fighting virtually the crack troops of the Indian army for so long and you know that in Narima house the five Jewish hostages they were killed by the Indian commandos
[27:30.700 --> 27:37.700]  they were not killed by these people so why would the Indian commandos kill them and Israeli suppressed this information
[27:37.700 --> 27:49.700]  it initially came out in one of the Indian Israeli delis but then it was suppressed so if you go by the record of the Indian acquisitions against Pakistan
[27:49.700 --> 27:59.700]  in the past in year 2001 on December 13 there was an attack on the Indian Lok Sabha and they blamed Pakistan and Lashkere Taiba for it
[27:59.700 --> 28:14.700]  but it turned out that these were Indian Kashmiris themselves and because India is committing so much of atrocities in Kashmir therefore there is a good reason for them that they would carry out something like that
[28:14.700 --> 28:32.700]  when they again in 2006 there was this Punjab express case in which 68 passengers mostly Pakistanis were killed and this train was stopped at an obscure railway station in Haryana and then those were locked and the train was set on fire
[28:32.700 --> 28:45.700]  and again this was the claim that it was Pakistani Lashkere Taiba and that they had done it because they wanted to derail the peace process but now three countries has been caught in it
[28:45.700 --> 28:58.700]  and there are other Indian officers who are his accomplices and he has a big network they took the RDX from Diolali depot which is a military depot
[28:58.700 --> 29:06.700]  so one can say that there is a deep penetration of the militant Hindus in military and intelligence organization in India
[29:06.700 --> 29:16.700]  so in this case why would they not do that because they want to again derail this process and when Obama says that he will mediate on Kashmir
[29:16.700 --> 29:34.700]  and there is a Kashmiri political movement picking up momentum and in this situation he said that he would send Bill Clinton as the mediator obviously the militants in India do not want this to happen and they had to preempt it
[29:34.700 --> 29:46.700]  so Pakistan doesn't gain, the Pakistani ISI doesn't gain anything from it, the net beneficiary is either the militant Hindus...
[29:46.700 --> 29:54.700]  we are on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:03.700 --> 33:18.700]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[33:18.700 --> 33:34.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, a rare interview, extremely enlightening, we're talking to the former head of Pakistani intelligence, the ISI, I want to thank Paul Watson who we've got on the line who's going to pop in with a question or two, I want to thank Simon over in the UK for getting us this number
[33:34.700 --> 33:42.700]  and I want to thank Aaron for staying up late last night to get the producing job done to get this interview right here on the GCN radio network.
[33:42.700 --> 33:58.700]  General, continuing with motive, I have the headline here, Pakistan asserts hoax war call was real, Press Minister fingers India High Commission as sorts of reports that threatening cell call was fake, as you know this is in most of the
[33:58.700 --> 34:12.700]  major Pakistani papers, the government has the caller ID and the phone records that the threatening call saying that India was going to attack within minutes of the terrorist attacks beginning in Mumbai a few weeks ago.
[34:12.700 --> 34:30.700]  This provocative call within minutes saying India was going to attack Pakistan, attempting to get Pakistan I guess to move troops to the border and have a conflict and the media saying that a possible war between the two thermal nuclear powers was narrowly averted, can you speak to that?
[34:30.700 --> 34:50.700]  Yes indeed I think the Americans and the Indians both have been very responsible about it because Condoleezza writes his statement in India when he went and visited Delhi, they were very threatening towards Pakistan and it was sort of a dictation that you have to satisfy India.
[34:50.700 --> 35:08.700]  Now this is amazing that Pakistan had to satisfy India on what score Indians are still to come out with the evidence and as far as this one man that they have caught, who knows that this is not a bogey and that this man was loitering around somewhere.
[35:08.700 --> 35:26.700]  There are lots of Pakistanis who crossed the border illegally or legally and he could have been picked up and he has become the front man for singing all those stories. So one doesn't really know, it's too early to start threatening war against Pakistan because Pakistan is a nuclear country
[35:26.700 --> 35:48.700]  and if they brandish their power, conventional power then I can assure you that as a soldier I will say that a conventional war, limited war within the nuclear environment is not possible in the subcontinent and if it comes to exchange of nuclear weapons then this becomes a third world war.
[35:48.700 --> 36:06.700]  China cannot stay out, Russia will not stay out, Russia is already showing its diligence towards America and Europe and China of course is a very major economic power, they are a nuclear power and if this thing happens in their backyards they will not accept it.
[36:06.700 --> 36:32.700]  So this is a very dangerous situation, I think it's playing with the file. So the whole thing is getting could get out of hand. It is again as I told you that the part of the unfinished agenda that new cons had in their mind and they think that now Obama will carry it out even though the Americans want to change.
[36:32.700 --> 36:54.700]  But let's look at what change means. Obama has not very clearly enunciated what change would be but one can assume that change means focusing on the domestic issues, there is an economic meltdown, the car industry is going sick and many other things are happening inside America, the social welfare and the Medicare etc.
[36:54.700 --> 37:05.700]  So in all these things there is a need for the new administration to focus entirely on the domestic issues and for that it will have to disengage externally.
[37:05.700 --> 37:29.700]  General, as you know in the last three months before Obama was even elected he said Pakistan and Afghanistan would be his main focus, the strikes inside Pakistan, it's clear that his change means what Zbigniew Brzezinski wants, shifting what the Rand Corporation has said they want, shifting the war out of the Middle East into Central Asia.
[37:29.700 --> 37:41.700]  So I believe the change is going to be these provocations. Look at the neo-cons with Israeli and NATO back forces launching the sneak attack on the Russian held South Ossetia on 888.
[37:41.700 --> 37:54.700]  So it appears that they are trying to launch a major larger than a theater war as the Rand Corporation said a month ago they want a major new war.
[37:54.700 --> 38:13.700]  Yes indeed you are right because this is old theory which is your strategic theory put out first by Mekinder and then by Mahan who was an admiral in the US Navy that this is the rim land you have to first control the rim land in Asia before you can strike in the heartland of Asia.
[38:13.700 --> 38:29.700]  So this heartland rim landing I think it fits into the story, it fits into the picture that if they have a conflict in the rim land and they can control it and then it becomes so much easier to go and penetrate into the heartland.
[38:29.700 --> 38:54.700]  But this is really asking too much at a state when America is not in a very healthy economic condition. So I think this is the brinkmanship of the highest order and if they enlarge the area of conflict in this war against terrorism and if they prolong the period of conflict then America will definitely lose.
[38:54.700 --> 39:11.700]  Because I know that when you are fighting the irregular fighters when area of conflict is enlarged let's say it is extended into the tribal areas of Pakistan or it is pushed into Kashmir as well so that China can be monitored and watched quite easily.
[39:11.700 --> 39:22.700]  Then the area will become larger and the US does simply does not have the troops and there is not a moral cause strong enough for the American people to be mobilized behind it.
[39:22.700 --> 39:27.700]  So this is here madness to be thinking of fighting at this time.
[39:27.700 --> 39:35.700]  So that's why they need proxies like India to destabilize the region for the encirclement of Russia and of course China blocking those pipelines.
[39:35.700 --> 39:45.700]  Now sir in the time we've got left you worked with the United States and Saudi Arabia with Israel or at least Pakistan did fighting the Russian invasion.
[39:45.700 --> 39:52.700]  Of course if these reports are incorrect correct me but you were one of the main commanders helping the Mujahideen.
[39:52.700 --> 39:59.700]  Then you were the head of Pakistani intelligence right at the time that you finally had the victory against the Russians.
[39:59.700 --> 40:14.700]  It is reported here that Al Qaeda was founded by the new Secretary of Defense Gates and Zbigniew Brzezinski that they were the Wahhabist fighting corps and that they are now being used to try to bring down the Pakistani government
[40:14.700 --> 40:18.700]  and to stage attacks inside India.
[40:18.700 --> 40:26.700]  So can you speak with your particular expertise to that and then also the fact that they're trying to now list you as a terrorist.
[40:26.700 --> 40:30.700]  And then thirdly did you ever meet Osama bin Laden?
[40:30.700 --> 40:33.700]  Is Osama bin Laden dead many years ago of kidney failure?
[40:33.700 --> 40:35.700]  Has been as Arbuto said.
[40:35.700 --> 40:45.700]  Well I was actually in charge of operations against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the Americans were providing the logistics support
[40:45.700 --> 40:56.700]  and the Saudis were sharing one half of the budget for this war and it was a cheap war because in all those 10 years that we were fighting the Russians
[40:56.700 --> 41:07.700]  we spent not more than 5 billion dollars out of the American expectation so it was a very cheap war for the Americans to have defeated the Russians
[41:07.700 --> 41:13.700]  and rid the whole of the west of this red man that they used to call.
[41:13.700 --> 41:25.700]  So at that time Osama bin Laden and his colleague they were admired and they were romanticized by the CIA operators.
[41:25.700 --> 41:31.700]  I had never met him then I had nothing to do with him because I was only busy training the Afans.
[41:31.700 --> 41:40.700]  We had to win a war, we had a task on our hand, it was a very big task and we were so occupied with the training only the Afans.
[41:40.700 --> 41:43.700]  No other national was trained by the ISI.
[41:43.700 --> 41:48.700]  I can vouch on that, not a single person, not even a Pakistani was trained by them.
[41:48.700 --> 41:58.700]  Osama bin Laden was, you know, I had never met him but these people used to come and talk blithely about him.
[41:58.700 --> 42:09.700]  I met Osama bin Laden after my retirement from the army in 1993 December in Khakum and then again in year 1994 November
[42:09.700 --> 42:18.700]  when I was there invited by Osama bin Taurabi to an international conference and during that conference
[42:18.700 --> 42:26.700]  Osama invited us to a banquet and it was all in an open place and where there were many other people present
[42:26.700 --> 42:34.700]  he struck to me as a very normal human being not a blood thirsty animal that is being presented by the CIA now.
[42:34.700 --> 42:39.700]  At that time there was no conversation between him and me, it took place.
[42:39.700 --> 42:52.700]  I don't know whether he is living or dead but so far Amanal Zowary has been giving, representing him in various interviews of Osama that have been put out.
[42:52.700 --> 43:06.700]  So one doesn't really know but the last interview which was a voice interview in that to the CIA and the other US intelligence agencies authenticated that it was Osama's voice.
[43:06.700 --> 43:12.700]  So one doesn't really know whether he is living or dead but even if he is not living he is now a symbol.
[43:12.700 --> 43:20.700]  Al Qaeda is a franchise, whoever created that and for whatever reason they created I think it wasn't there until 1996
[43:20.700 --> 43:29.700]  when he was lodged in Khartoum later on he was invited by Burhanuddin Rabani who is now part of the Northern Alliance in Kabul
[43:29.700 --> 43:35.700]  and he came over and he set up his headquarters in a place called Torabora near Jalalabad
[43:35.700 --> 43:43.700]  but that's where one started hearing of Al Qaeda and the activities of Osama bin Laden.
[43:43.700 --> 43:52.700]  And also of the fact that his commander was responsible for bringing the Black Hawk down the first operation in Mogadishu
[43:52.700 --> 44:03.700]  where an American aircraft was brought down by a stinger which had probably been supplied in Afghanistan to Afghan Mujahideen.
[44:03.700 --> 44:13.700]  General, I need to, in the time we have left here because we've only got a few minutes left with you here, maybe five minutes and we're going to break it.
[44:13.700 --> 44:21.700]  Specifically though, we know his CIA control name was Tim Osman. We know he was the bag man for a lot of the Saudi money and the Israeli money going in.
[44:21.700 --> 44:28.700]  I know that was compartmentalized and separate from Pakistani intelligence from what I've read from different perspectives and US intelligence.
[44:28.700 --> 44:38.700]  So I believe you there. My whole point here is that clearly Al Qaeda, Al Ciaida didn't carry out the attacks of 9-11 as you yourself have said.
[44:38.700 --> 44:46.700]  And bin Laden in his first interview said that he didn't do it. Then they produced these computer morphed videos and fake audios that have been checked
[44:46.700 --> 44:57.700]  and the Intel Center headed up by Rumsfeld's former lieutenant, the private group was caught putting the same video layer in with the original video.
[44:57.700 --> 45:03.700]  So it's been proven that they're creating these fake videos.
[45:03.700 --> 45:11.700]  Yes, there is no doubt about it that this video which was put out in November by George Bush and said this was Osama bin Laden.
[45:11.700 --> 45:18.700]  He was a high cheek bone like the Mangala had features. He wasn't as tall as Osama bin Laden was.
[45:18.700 --> 45:29.700]  And one could make clearly make out that this was doctor had been created on purpose just to justify the attack on Afghanistan.
[45:29.700 --> 45:38.700]  I think there are many things which are going wrong or being done on the best of the government by the CIA, which are not correct.
[45:38.700 --> 45:43.700]  The CIA used to be good when they were working with us, but I don't know what happened thereafter.
[45:43.700 --> 45:52.700]  I think it is their overarching ambition or it is their fear that America would lose its clout, whatever the reason.
[45:52.700 --> 45:59.700]  Or it is perhaps the Israeli fear that they are surrounded by a sea of hostile enemies.
[45:59.700 --> 46:08.700]  Who could, if the Americans don't know at this point in time, they don't deliver a fatal blow to all their enemies.
[46:08.700 --> 46:18.700]  Israel, people who have a short shelf life, otherwise also because it is an artificial state that they would probably not exist.
[46:18.700 --> 46:25.700]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live. It is Monday, the 15th day of December, 2008.
[46:25.700 --> 46:29.700]  We'll be here for the next three hours and 14 minutes.
[46:29.700 --> 46:34.700]  And we have a lot of very informative guests coming up and joining us today.
[46:34.700 --> 46:39.700]  I apologize for the fact that I'm about 45 minutes late getting on air.
[46:39.700 --> 46:50.700]  My guys have done a great job building the radio slash TV studio, but because Minnesota is a thousand miles away and we're hooked into satellites and our own internet backup,
[46:50.700 --> 46:55.700]  the backup system itself, because we have three different backup systems.
[46:55.700 --> 47:00.700]  This didn't happen in all the tests the last two weeks. It happened right before I went live today.
[47:00.700 --> 47:08.700]  And this always happens even with big mainline networks and folks they do months of testing beforehand because they know the devil is in the details.
[47:08.700 --> 47:15.700]  So no big deal. I didn't think I'd be back in this studio that we were going to dismantle this afternoon.
[47:15.700 --> 47:18.700]  I thought Friday would be my last show here. I'm kind of missing it.
[47:18.700 --> 47:22.700]  When you've been in a studio for three and a half years, you come to love it.
[47:22.700 --> 47:26.700]  It becomes like your little nest. You're very, very comfortable in it.
[47:26.700 --> 47:34.700]  And so I was, you know, getting ready to do my show out of the new studio, but was happy to do it because it's really nice.
[47:34.700 --> 47:37.700]  And we had some problems with that.
[47:37.700 --> 47:43.700]  We did the maiden TV transmission for an hour and 50 minutes last Friday.
[47:43.700 --> 47:45.700]  That was very successful.
[47:45.700 --> 47:54.700]  And I should be back in the studio tomorrow and doing the prison planet dot TV fourth hour from there tomorrow.
[47:54.700 --> 47:58.700]  And again, this is all part of the growing process.
[47:58.700 --> 48:02.700]  It's also the way the poor man does it.
[48:02.700 --> 48:08.700]  I couldn't afford to do what we're doing if I used, you know, big mainline companies and contractors and people like that.
[48:08.700 --> 48:10.700]  And then even then you have a lot of problems.
[48:10.700 --> 48:15.700]  We're doing all this on the cheap here in an attempt to upgrade what we're doing.
[48:15.700 --> 48:23.700]  But think about it, streaming video, streaming audio, feeding satellites, feeding radio networks with a new system.
[48:23.700 --> 48:27.700]  That is, you know, we're doing some things at the Genesis network.
[48:27.700 --> 48:35.700]  And then on my own end down here that other other people, most people haven't been doing or others are just now starting to attempt to do it.
[48:35.700 --> 48:39.700]  Really is the cutting edge of the new media.
[48:39.700 --> 48:42.700]  Who do we have for you today on the show?
[48:42.700 --> 48:48.700]  We have talked to the Marine Corps officer out in 29 Palms.
[48:48.700 --> 48:53.700]  They did tell the local media that they were going to be out with the police at DWI checkpoints assisting them.
[48:53.700 --> 49:04.700]  Then they told local media once there was pressure last week on local radio and TV that they were just, you know, going to be aiding people and they didn't know if it was illegal.
[49:04.700 --> 49:11.700]  But that they weren't sure whether they were going to be out at all the DWI checkpoints of the regular Marine Corps.
[49:11.700 --> 49:17.700]  Well, we talked to the Marine Corps this morning and they said, well, we'll come on your show tomorrow.
[49:17.700 --> 49:20.700]  That's the soonest they'll be on.
[49:20.700 --> 49:27.700]  And they said, we know who you are because I had Aaron say it's not a lie, but it's it's technical so that they don't get scared off from the show.
[49:27.700 --> 49:29.700]  He said, this is 590 a.m.
[49:29.700 --> 49:30.700]  He said, I know who you are.
[49:30.700 --> 49:35.700]  This is Aaron and you work with Curt Nimmo and Alex Jones.
[49:35.700 --> 49:38.700]  And I don't know.
[49:38.700 --> 49:41.700]  I mean, every Marine we run into who's an officer knows who I am.
[49:41.700 --> 49:50.700]  It seems, you know, they had the Marines out brainwashing children Friday here in Austin in full battle gear with their weapons.
[49:50.700 --> 49:57.700]  And we show up and well, a listener does they walk up with the phone and the guy goes, oh, yeah, Alex Jones here.
[49:57.700 --> 49:58.700]  I'll talk to him.
[49:58.700 --> 50:00.700]  So they're fully aware over the years.
[50:00.700 --> 50:08.700]  I've been to so many of their urban warfare training events that I guess I'm somewhat of a folk creature.
[50:08.700 --> 50:14.700]  And I'm sure that the everything I've done has been exaggerated and twisted many times over.
[50:14.700 --> 50:15.700]  So that's interesting.
[50:15.700 --> 50:26.700]  We do have a local radio talk show host Gary Denault joining us from KCDZ FM, the local FM talk station.
[50:26.700 --> 50:27.700]  He'll be joining us.
[50:27.700 --> 50:29.700]  He's talked to the Marines as well.
[50:29.700 --> 50:38.700]  We have people on the info wars dot com and prison planning dot com stories about this saying it's not true or saying they they want proof.
[50:38.700 --> 50:39.700]  It's just going on.
[50:39.700 --> 50:45.700]  Obama has announced the military has announced Bush announced you're going to see regular army and Marines on the streets.
[50:45.700 --> 50:48.700]  Okay, this is part of the takeover that's going on.
[50:48.700 --> 50:55.700]  We also have John Watkins, enough respect director coming on and Dr. Russell Blalock and a lot more key news straight ahead.
[50:55.700 --> 50:57.700]  Stay with us.
[50:57.700 --> 51:01.700]  Drought, crop failure, economic collapse, famine.
[51:01.700 --> 51:03.700]  Is this an America's future?
[51:03.700 --> 51:06.700]  Sadly, this is part of America's not so distant past.
[51:06.700 --> 51:14.700]  During the Great Depression, half of the American people grew much of their own food, but over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[51:14.700 --> 51:22.700]  Today, it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans grow their own food plan for your family's future and don't leave anything to chance.
[51:22.700 --> 51:31.700]  Go to getseeds.net and give the gift of life this Christmas and help ensure that if history repeats itself, you and your loved ones will be prepared for crisis.

[51:57.700 --> 52:04.700]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:04.700 --> 52:08.700]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[52:08.700 --> 52:09.700]  Bin Laden.
[52:09.700 --> 52:10.700]  This is his MO.
[52:10.700 --> 52:13.700]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[52:13.700 --> 52:20.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:20.700 --> 52:27.700]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:27.700 --> 52:31.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:31.700 --> 52:41.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[52:41.700 --> 52:50.700]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:50.700 --> 53:15.700]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[53:15.700 --> 53:21.700]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[53:21.700 --> 53:24.700]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[53:24.700 --> 53:29.700]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[53:29.700 --> 53:35.700]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[53:35.700 --> 53:40.700]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[53:40.700 --> 53:47.700]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today. That's MySolarBackup.com today.
[53:47.700 --> 54:02.700]  Or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[54:02.700 --> 54:11.700]  Just a broadcast note, Congressman Ron Paul will be on for the first 30 minutes to start of the show Wednesday.
[54:11.700 --> 54:16.700]  We'll talk about the banker hijacking of the entire economy.
[54:16.700 --> 54:23.700]  Obama's declaration that he will declare CO2 a toxic waste.
[54:23.700 --> 54:29.700]  That is the complete takeover of the economy and neo-serfdom feudalism.
[54:29.700 --> 54:32.700]  And a lot more. He's also on the inside track in Congress.
[54:32.700 --> 54:37.700]  What is the big surprise coming up on the 21st or 22nd?
[54:37.700 --> 54:42.700]  Now only a month away in January.
[54:42.700 --> 54:49.700]  So that is coming up Wednesday. That would be the 17th. This is the 15th. It is Monday.
[54:49.700 --> 54:55.700]  We are live. You heard some excerpts from the interview with General Hamid Ghul.
[54:55.700 --> 55:02.700]  By the way, did you know the Times of India, Israeli newspapers, European newspapers, scores of newspapers?
[55:02.700 --> 55:05.700]  You can type his name into Google News.
[55:05.700 --> 55:12.700]  Picked up that interview last week and unanimously none of them gave credit to the radio show.
[55:12.700 --> 55:21.700]  Even the World Socialist Website picked it up and they said he gave a radio interview, he gave a media interview on Tuesday
[55:21.700 --> 55:26.700]  and then said all the amazing things that he reported here.
[55:26.700 --> 55:32.700]  And look, it's not that I even care about getting the credit other than the fact that that brings us new listeners.
[55:32.700 --> 55:38.700]  It's that in normal journalism, normal media, we will tell you where we heard something.
[55:38.700 --> 55:43.700]  If we're telling you the Marines are announcing that starting on the 12th and now three days ago,
[55:43.700 --> 55:53.700]  they're with police at checkpoints in San Bernardino County, off base, off of 29 Palms, running checkpoints with the police.
[55:53.700 --> 56:02.700]  We have multiple sources on that and we plug the news blog, we plug the local news talk station that reported it
[56:02.700 --> 56:09.700]  and we have the news talk station host joining us coming up in about 35 minutes because we want to give you the source.
[56:09.700 --> 56:13.700]  The Times of India is one of the biggest newspapers in the world.
[56:13.700 --> 56:18.700]  Why would it not give the source and just say Hamid Ghul said this?
[56:18.700 --> 56:24.700]  So they're breaking with just the basic journalistic standards of not even sourcing
[56:24.700 --> 56:31.700]  because they don't want to give attention to this radio show that continues to make headlines worldwide.
[56:31.700 --> 56:39.700]  Speaking of censorship and the establishment trying to bury the growth curve of this radio broadcast and the work we do
[56:39.700 --> 56:46.700]  at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, the Wall Street Journal is reporting today
[56:46.700 --> 56:51.700]  and Paul Watson is doing a big article on it that will be up by tonight
[56:51.700 --> 56:55.700]  announcing the two-tiered internet where they're going to basically shut down the old web
[56:55.700 --> 57:01.700]  and force you onto the new quote high-speed web but where the search engine rankings are controlled,
[57:01.700 --> 57:05.700]  Google decides what goes up and alternative websites are basically shut down
[57:05.700 --> 57:10.700]  and you won't be able to get to alternative websites so it's a partitioning of the web.
[57:10.700 --> 57:16.700]  They grow, develop the web, get everybody on it and then just basically incrementally shut down the old web.
[57:16.700 --> 57:18.700]  That is now in the Wall Street Journal.
[57:18.700 --> 57:25.700]  Today what we told you four years ago, when we really started first reporting,
[57:25.700 --> 57:31.700]  I guess five years ago on internet too, this consortium of private corporations, governments and foundations
[57:31.700 --> 57:37.700]  as well as universities, they announced that it's to shut off the alternative media.
[57:37.700 --> 57:40.700]  They announced it is to kill free speech.
[57:40.700 --> 57:43.700]  They announced it is to suppress radicals as they've said.
[57:43.700 --> 57:49.700]  And that's what the mainstream media has to do because the newspapers, the television, all of it is imploding,
[57:49.700 --> 57:52.700]  all of it is falling apart and has lost all credibility.
[57:52.700 --> 57:54.700]  Let me tell you something guys, too little, too late.
[57:54.700 --> 58:00.700]  People know you're a pack of spinning, twisting liars and they're aware of your activities
[58:00.700 --> 58:06.700]  so too little, too late, cats out of the bag and we are going to invade the new internet too as well.
[58:06.700 --> 58:09.700]  We're going to boycott people attempting to bring it in.
[58:09.700 --> 58:11.700]  We are going to fight it.
[58:11.700 --> 58:16.700]  Okay, news blitz when we get back for the next 30 minutes, big stack of important news here
[58:16.700 --> 58:21.700]  that we're going to be covering when we get back in just 70 seconds after the break.
[58:21.700 --> 58:26.700]  Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, there's two days left to be guaranteed
[58:26.700 --> 58:32.700]  that you get your UPS package of books and videos from infowars.com shopping cart before Christmas.
[58:32.700 --> 58:35.700]  So get your orders in now and spread the truth.
[58:35.700 --> 58:41.700]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:41.700 --> 58:45.700]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:47.700 --> 58:53.700]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grounds here
[58:53.700 --> 58:56.700]  and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did.
[58:56.700 --> 59:03.700]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[59:03.700 --> 59:12.700]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[59:12.700 --> 59:19.700]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[59:19.700 --> 59:22.700]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[59:22.700 --> 59:28.700]  He takes his hand off and you hear it three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[59:28.700 --> 59:35.700]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[59:35.700 --> 59:40.700]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:40.700 --> 59:58.700]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:18.700]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.700 --> 1:00:26.700]  Well, the Marines, not just in California, but we're getting reports all over the nation are out this holiday season, this Christmas,
[1:00:26.700 --> 1:00:35.700]  running checkpoints on highways with state police like the Chips, California Highway Patrol.
[1:00:35.700 --> 1:00:41.700]  And we're going to go directly to one of the local news stations that's been reporting on this coming up in 30 minutes.
[1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:44.700]  We did talk to the Marine Corps this morning.
[1:00:44.700 --> 1:00:51.700]  Aaron Dyches is going to be in studio with us. They did confirm that they are doing this, but they said it's just for training.
[1:00:51.700 --> 1:00:59.700]  It's always for training, but now the Army and the Marine Corps admits officially they are going to be engaging the American people
[1:00:59.700 --> 1:01:04.700]  against insurrection, rioting, and things of that nature.
[1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:09.700]  Does it matter if they admit it? Does it matter how many videos I have? Does it matter how many government documents I have?
[1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:21.700]  People are still in denial because 10, 15 years ago alternative media would talk about this and people would laugh at them because the mainstream media said it wasn't being prepared, wasn't being set up.
[1:01:21.700 --> 1:01:25.700]  Then it all magically unfolds right on time as we told you it would.
[1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:35.700]  And people still say it doesn't exist because they can't admit they were wrong about that because then they'd have to admit they were wrong about everything else.
[1:01:35.700 --> 1:01:43.700]  Remember, a near do well about a year ago called me up and was saying threatening things and I pointed out the economy was going to be imploding.
[1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:50.700]  I pointed out that Ford and Chevy were on the verge of going under and he called me a conspiracy theorist. I was only going off all the data.
[1:01:50.700 --> 1:01:56.700]  All we do is cover the facts and the information here on this radio show.
[1:01:56.700 --> 1:02:04.700]  And the public out there sitting on the fence would do well to stop living in denial and at least check out the claims we're making.
[1:02:04.700 --> 1:02:09.700]  More power lost possible in ice ravaged northeast.
[1:02:09.700 --> 1:02:16.700]  Hundreds of thousands of people are without power in Massachusetts and other states up in Maine, New Hampshire.
[1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:22.700]  We're getting record cold temperatures right now in areas of Texas.
[1:02:22.700 --> 1:02:27.700]  But meanwhile, Al Gore came out in the Associated Press today.
[1:02:27.700 --> 1:02:31.700]  This is a quote, Obama left with little time to curb global warming.
[1:02:31.700 --> 1:02:35.700]  Cooling trends illustrates how fast the world is warming.
[1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:44.700]  That's right. Cold is the new hot. Al Gore in the article says cooling trends illustrate how fast the world is warming.
[1:02:44.700 --> 1:02:54.700]  That's right. Colder weather in the solar system on the moons of Uranus, Neptune, Jupiter, Saturn.
[1:02:54.700 --> 1:03:03.700]  The ice caps had been shrinking on Mars. They're now getting larger for the last year and a half because of the sun has cooled off.
[1:03:03.700 --> 1:03:08.700]  They've been measuring the sun for 300 years continually. It is the coolest it's ever been measured.
[1:03:08.700 --> 1:03:14.700]  So it was in a hot phase, kind of heated up like a light bulb that's about to burn out, you know, right before they burn out, they get brighter.
[1:03:14.700 --> 1:03:22.700]  Not saying the sun's about to burn out, but it heats up, it cools down, it heats up, it cools down in regular patterns.
[1:03:22.700 --> 1:03:30.700]  What is the answer of Robert Kennedy, Jr.? I saw him on a video clip online when he was confronted with this by We Are Change.
[1:03:30.700 --> 1:03:34.700]  He just said, no, there are no ice caps on Mars.
[1:03:34.700 --> 1:03:44.700]  What was Rothschild's comment here a year ago, plus on the show, when I said, well, why are the ice caps getting smaller on Mars?
[1:03:44.700 --> 1:03:55.700]  Why are the moons of Saturn and Jupiter like Titan, for instance, having areas on them that had ice that has melted, and they have clear telescope photos of this?
[1:03:55.700 --> 1:04:11.700]  And he just said, no, those planets are closer to the sun. And I said, no, they're not. I said, Jupiter and Saturn are closer to deep space, the Earth is closer.
[1:04:11.700 --> 1:04:19.700]  And he just said, no, knowing that the general public isn't aware. See, they revel in the fact that the public is ignorant.
[1:04:19.700 --> 1:04:28.700]  And so now Al Gore is saying that because everything is cooling down, that that is global warming.
[1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:39.700]  Notice they don't see global warming anymore. Now they say climate change. So they want to ban the seasons and the fact that the Earth is always heating up and cooling down.
[1:04:39.700 --> 1:04:47.700]  It's a total takeover of the economy. That's all this is, is a guilt-laden tax to totally micromanage society.
[1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:53.700]  It is just absolutely nightmarish in its full implications. We'll get more into that when we come back and a lot more stay with me.
[1:05:18.700 --> 1:05:24.700]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe. Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S. this fall?

[1:05:55.700 --> 1:06:02.700]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:02.700 --> 1:06:06.700]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:06:06.700 --> 1:06:08.700]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:06:08.700 --> 1:06:11.700]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:06:11.700 --> 1:06:18.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:18.700 --> 1:06:25.700]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.

[1:07:55.700 --> 1:08:12.700]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:12.700 --> 1:08:22.700]  We're live coming up to about 25 minutes to take you to California where the Marines are out running checkpoints with the state police to condition the public for complete martial law.
[1:08:22.700 --> 1:08:25.700]  And a bunch of other news that goes along with that.
[1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:34.700]  A constitutional convention snuck up on us last week. They were only the feds, only one state away from getting a constitutional convention.
[1:08:34.700 --> 1:08:43.700]  And that is being fought right now in several states by a razor's edge margin.
[1:08:43.700 --> 1:08:49.700]  Globalist Constitutional Convention dealt a defeat in Ohio, but they're still trying to pass it there.
[1:08:49.700 --> 1:08:54.700]  And for those that don't know what that means, they could rewrite the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution very quickly.
[1:08:54.700 --> 1:09:04.700]  We're finishing up with the global warming story. It's an article out of the Associated Press. Obama left with little time to curb global warming.
[1:09:04.700 --> 1:09:09.700]  And in here, there's a quote by Al Gore saying Obama left with little time to curb global warming.
[1:09:09.700 --> 1:09:13.700]  Cooling trend illustrates how fast the world is warming.
[1:09:13.700 --> 1:09:20.700]  Now, the earth is always heating up and cooling down. Most of it's based on the sun. The sun is cooled down, so now we're cooling down.
[1:09:20.700 --> 1:09:25.700]  Who knows how long they don't understand the sun completely?
[1:09:25.700 --> 1:09:31.700]  Or even that big of a grasp of it, they just know that that's the main heater of the planet.
[1:09:31.700 --> 1:09:35.700]  And there's no debating that, but they're counting on the public being stupid.
[1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:42.700]  I watched about 15 minutes of TV this weekend and was flipping past some children's cartoons.
[1:09:42.700 --> 1:09:53.700]  I think the show was Charlie and Lola, and I watched about a minute of it, and it was about polar bears drowning and not being able to make it back to the ice,
[1:09:53.700 --> 1:09:57.700]  as if polar bears can't swim and that the glaciers are all melting.
[1:09:57.700 --> 1:10:04.700]  Glaciers flow. It's ice flowing, and the condensation, the rain, the snow, the sleet builds up,
[1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:13.700]  and then it pushes down through the valleys, through the fjords, to the ocean, and they're always coming to the sea in the spring,
[1:10:13.700 --> 1:10:23.700]  breaking off into the ocean. But again, they know the public isn't aware of that, so they say, oh my God, look, the glaciers are all melting.
[1:10:23.700 --> 1:10:31.700]  Remember about six months ago, the United Nations and the media said for sure that part of Antarctica and the Arctic would break off.
[1:10:31.700 --> 1:10:36.700]  There's going to be a huge disaster, but the sea levels would rise this year and flood some cities,
[1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:43.700]  and they said that the North Pole would probably be completely melted this year.
[1:10:43.700 --> 1:10:51.700]  Well, actually, last time I checked, and this was reported by all the major weather outfits, the satellite photos,
[1:10:51.700 --> 1:11:01.700]  33% increase in the size of the Arctic and 33% increase in the diameter of the ice of the Antarctic to the south.
[1:11:01.700 --> 1:11:09.700]  That doesn't matter, because the public, they've done studies, most of the public doesn't know what the Arctic is versus the Antarctic.
[1:11:09.700 --> 1:11:13.700]  They don't know that it expands and contracts every year.
[1:11:13.700 --> 1:11:19.700]  They don't know that, again, Mars has ice caps and that those were melting and now expanding again.
[1:11:19.700 --> 1:11:28.700]  They just don't know this, that they don't know that their SUV isn't causing ice caps to melt on Mars.
[1:11:28.700 --> 1:11:34.700]  And they don't understand that the government of the world, the private banks that are openly announcing that they are the government of the world,
[1:11:34.700 --> 1:11:48.700]  want to tax and regulate every facet of human life on this planet.
[1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:57.700]  So Obama, he's just got to pass this greenhouse gases law to tax your cows and tax your sheep and tax your fowl and tax your business,
[1:11:57.700 --> 1:12:05.700]  your home, anything that puts off carbon, including human breathing, that's been proposed by the United Nations.
[1:12:05.700 --> 1:12:11.700]  Also, Reuters is saying Obama's stimulus could reach $1 trillion to get the economy going.
[1:12:11.700 --> 1:12:12.700]  What is that $1 trillion?
[1:12:12.700 --> 1:12:20.700]  It's going to be a payoff to cronies and friends of the establishment, the defense budgets over $1 trillion for 2009 separately,
[1:12:20.700 --> 1:12:23.700]  but $8.5 trillion in the first seven weeks.
[1:12:23.700 --> 1:12:32.700]  We haven't gotten numbers in about a week and a half yet on how many more trillions they've stolen.
[1:12:32.700 --> 1:12:34.700]  It normally comes out each week how much they've stolen.
[1:12:34.700 --> 1:12:44.700]  It'd be $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $3 trillion, $4 trillion, about a trillion, $300 billion on average stolen by the offshore private banks per week.
[1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:47.700]  But now in the last week and a half, just no numbers coming out.
[1:12:47.700 --> 1:12:56.700]  Congress isn't even saying, of course, Congress and Bloomberg have been told, the media and the elected government have been told,
[1:12:56.700 --> 1:13:05.700]  the Federal Reserve is above the law will no longer tell anyone anything.
[1:13:05.700 --> 1:13:14.700]  Top banks admit huge losses in Wall Street pyramid fraud, and this report is from the French news agency.
[1:13:14.700 --> 1:13:19.700]  Top world financial groups on Monday revealed massive potential losses, it's in the hundreds of billions,
[1:13:19.700 --> 1:13:26.700]  led scam run by Wall Street trader Bernard Maddoff admitting they were fooled by a classic pyramid investment fraud.
[1:13:26.700 --> 1:13:28.700]  What do you think derivatives are?
[1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:33.700]  That's where your pension funds went.
[1:13:33.700 --> 1:13:38.700]  British, French, Japanese and Spanish banks and funds said investments totaling billions of dollars,
[1:13:38.700 --> 1:13:48.700]  euros could be wiped off the balance sheets by the scandal that is set to affect some of the richest people in the world.
[1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:54.700]  The Royal Bank of Scotland alone is going to lose 400 million pounds,
[1:13:54.700 --> 1:14:01.700]  joining a growing list of banks and investors in Europe, Asia and the United States struck by the scandal.
[1:14:01.700 --> 1:14:08.700]  Shares in Sanatanda, the biggest bank in Spain and the second largest in Europe after HSBC,
[1:14:08.700 --> 1:14:16.700]  plunged after the lender said it had an exposure of more than $3 billion to Maddoff investment securities in New York.
[1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:25.700]  That's the way he's moved to Dubai, non-extradition just like Cheney and everybody else and Halliburton and Blackwater have all moved there.
[1:14:25.700 --> 1:14:29.700]  So they can laugh at us from afar, no extradition.
[1:14:29.700 --> 1:14:37.700]  Shares again plunged after France's Nenexes investment bank already brought low by subprime losses.
[1:14:37.700 --> 1:14:42.700]  See, that's all a lie, it's not subprime losses, it's that they sold derivatives on those.
[1:14:42.700 --> 1:14:54.700]  Maximum exposure at 450 million euros or $606 million, retail banking giant BNP revealed potential losses and it goes on and on from there.
[1:14:54.700 --> 1:15:01.700]  And that's just banks in the tens of billions, investors are saying it's hundreds of billions, just private investors.
[1:15:01.700 --> 1:15:06.700]  You know, the deal sounds like it's too good to be true, it is.
[1:15:06.700 --> 1:15:08.700]  It's that simple.
[1:15:08.700 --> 1:15:12.700]  Now we're going to get Gerald Salente back on the show this week, not just Ron Paul.
[1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:16.700]  Grease-style riots come into the US, we've predicted that as well.
[1:15:16.700 --> 1:15:23.700]  Troops and mercenaries will be used to detain Americans in prison camps, warns deadly accurate trends forecaster.
[1:15:23.700 --> 1:15:27.700]  By the way, I was flattered to find out, it's a long time listener of the show.
[1:15:27.700 --> 1:15:39.700]  Frighteningly accurate trends forecaster Gerald Salente says the American people in America will see riots similar to those currently ongoing in Greece and that this will cause, will be caused by hyperinflation, depression,
[1:15:39.700 --> 1:15:46.700]  leading to the inevitable use of troops and mercenaries to deal with the crisis as Americans are incarcerated in internment camps.
[1:15:46.700 --> 1:15:50.700]  Now, remember though, the banks engineered all of this.
[1:15:50.700 --> 1:15:57.700]  The Army and the Marines are all saying, oh, we just now started planning to be on the streets of America.
[1:15:57.700 --> 1:16:03.700]  We just now got the idea we have to do this when for decades they've been quietly setting it up.
[1:16:03.700 --> 1:16:13.700]  And I'm seeing a lot of military people in military newspapers and websites and message boards laughing saying, oh, well, we got our pensions from Uncle Sam, we'll be fine.
[1:16:13.700 --> 1:16:16.700]  Yeah, they're just going to devalue it and tax it and give you a pittance.
[1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:24.700]  So go ahead and laugh. I mean, you're engineered to laugh at the people, the police have been trained to be paramilitary, and again, a military fights an enemy.
[1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:29.700]  So see, we're now the enemy, but see what you didn't know is you're the enemy of the New World War II.
[1:16:29.700 --> 1:16:32.700]  What you didn't know was that you're not going to be winners either.
[1:16:32.700 --> 1:16:36.700]  What you didn't understand was you're in the same boat with us.
[1:16:36.700 --> 1:16:44.700]  So they taught you to hate us, they taught you to despise us, they, you know, to call us civilians and that you're paramilitary and that it's an us against them mentality.
[1:16:44.700 --> 1:16:48.700]  Okay, go ahead and guard the bank robbers as they suck the country dry.
[1:16:48.700 --> 1:16:53.700]  But they're going to take your pension funds. Many of you will get nothing.
[1:16:53.700 --> 1:16:58.700]  Okay, and for feds out there, yours is going to be massively reduced.
[1:16:58.700 --> 1:17:04.700]  So keep on laughing. Keep on being evil and see what happens to servants of evil.
[1:17:04.700 --> 1:17:08.700]  I'm not the one that's going to punish you. You're going to punish yourself.
[1:17:08.700 --> 1:17:18.700]  So cut off your nose, despite your face. I'm asking you not to, but hey, don't let me get in the way of what you're so dedicated to do.
[1:17:18.700 --> 1:17:21.700]  As we have highlighted before, Salante's accuracy is stunning.
[1:17:21.700 --> 1:17:29.700]  He predicted in any seven, the crash, the subprime mortgage crisis and the panic of 08 and is routinely cited even by mainstream news networks is highly credible.
[1:17:29.700 --> 1:17:33.700]  You got about a 95% accuracy rate. The cause of the riots will be hyperinflationary depression.
[1:17:33.700 --> 1:17:41.700]  Salante told interviewer Lou Rockwell, causing Americans to revolt in similar circumstances than we have witnessed recently in Iceland and Greece.
[1:17:41.700 --> 1:17:47.700]  The trouble would be sparked up by Obama declaring a bank holiday whereby people will be, won't be able to withdraw their money.
[1:17:47.700 --> 1:17:53.700]  See, our media doesn't tell you unless you read deep into the articles. They're rioting and, you know, they're, oh, they're just young punks.
[1:17:53.700 --> 1:17:58.700]  They're just scum. They just are communists. They just hate freedom.
[1:17:58.700 --> 1:18:05.700]  No, the banks have been shutting down. The banks have been not giving them their money. The jobs are, are disappearing.
[1:18:05.700 --> 1:18:10.700]  And the police are out shooting people in the streets.
[1:18:10.700 --> 1:18:18.700]  The cause of the riots would be a hyperinflationary depression. Salante told interviewer, what's going on in Greece with these riots has nothing to do with a 15 year old boy being killed.
[1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:26.700]  That was only the spark that ignited the pent up really the hatred and disdain people have for the scandals and corrupt government.
[1:18:26.700 --> 1:18:31.700]  And the same thing is going on in this country as well said Salante.
[1:18:31.700 --> 1:18:35.700]  The military and the police better be asking, whose side are you going to be on?
[1:18:35.700 --> 1:18:45.700]  I don't want riots. I don't want this to happen. It's in the IMF and World Bank plans, documents, that I put in my book seven years ago, 9-11, to set the tyranny.
[1:18:45.700 --> 1:18:53.700]  In the book we talk about by 2007, 2009, in there that they were planning this because we had their documents,
[1:18:53.700 --> 1:18:59.700]  that the final phase is called the IMF riot. I mean, that's in their internal documents.
[1:18:59.700 --> 1:19:04.700]  They shut off liquidity, shut off the currency, let the nations implode.
[1:19:04.700 --> 1:19:12.700]  Then the public riots. The public will riot within three to four days. They've got Pentagon studies put out in the fifties on this.
[1:19:12.700 --> 1:19:16.700]  The American people will riot within three to four days.
[1:19:16.700 --> 1:19:30.700]  They will steal within three to four days. And every major study worldwide shows within 10 to 15 days, anyone, almost anyone, everyone will kill, will kill for food.
[1:19:30.700 --> 1:19:34.700]  Okay, now understand this is how are they going to get us to accept martial law?
[1:19:34.700 --> 1:19:40.700]  How are they going to sell us on accepting troops on the streets? They will implode the economy by design. How many years have I told you this?
[1:19:40.700 --> 1:19:49.700]  So then you beg for it, and then the troops come in to make sure that the depression continues. But they will believe they're actually trying to help.
[1:19:49.700 --> 1:19:54.700]  You understand how this is being orchestrated? Like a symphony orchestra of destruction?
[1:19:57.700 --> 1:20:01.700]  How would you like to save up to 90% on your phone bill?

[1:22:12.700 --> 1:22:18.700]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S. treasuries,
[1:22:18.700 --> 1:22:22.700]  responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[1:22:22.700 --> 1:22:29.700]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike,
[1:22:29.700 --> 1:22:32.700]  hammering the U.S. housing market, and throwing the economy into a recession.
[1:22:32.700 --> 1:22:36.700]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[1:22:36.700 --> 1:22:43.700]  Economist Ambrose Evans-Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[1:23:55.700 --> 1:24:08.700]  By the way, we've called the California Highway Patrol and they admit that they are running checkpoints with the U.S. Marine Corps in California.
[1:24:08.700 --> 1:24:16.700]  Now the Marines, Friday, talked to the media, blog and radio and said, yeah, we are, but it's only for your safety.
[1:24:16.700 --> 1:24:23.700]  Now they're spinning and saying, well, we're only looking for our own Marines at the checkpoints. And this is just training.
[1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:28.700]  Oh, really? That's what the Army Times says about the Army and the Marines to be used in America.
[1:24:28.700 --> 1:24:38.700]  And there's a new order out by Secretary of Defense Gates and Barack Obama saying it's going to be non-military, even non-police functions.
[1:24:38.700 --> 1:24:47.700]  It's going to be military policing and, quote, environmental issues and community issues like helping at car wrecks.
[1:24:47.700 --> 1:24:54.700]  You see, oh, we're here to give toys to the children that used to us in our battle uniforms with our machine guns out.
[1:24:54.700 --> 1:25:02.700]  Oh, we're here to help at checkpoints and car wrecks. It's all part of the acclamation.
[1:25:02.700 --> 1:25:09.700]  And I want to state this clearly. We told the military, we told everybody this was being set up.
[1:25:09.700 --> 1:25:15.700]  The public laughed. The military said, yeah, we know we're being trained for it. So what? Some individuals are against it.
[1:25:15.700 --> 1:25:20.700]  I would say the majority. We have polls, but still they say they'll follow their orders.
[1:25:20.700 --> 1:25:25.700]  And the main training is to confiscate your guns once the rioting starts.
[1:25:25.700 --> 1:25:34.700]  Now, again, they'll let the rioting go crazy and then come in after the rioting's over and go door to door confiscating your guns, quote, securing the area.
[1:25:34.700 --> 1:25:42.700]  So those of you that stay in your houses or your farms or ranches, they're going to come by a week later, a month later, six months later, and take your guns.
[1:25:42.700 --> 1:25:51.700]  And they'll make examples of a few farms and ranches and homes. They'll gun everybody down, burn the house down like they did in New Orleans and other parts of the world.
[1:25:51.700 --> 1:25:56.700]  And then it'll be televised and people will say, okay, I better show up and turn my gun in.
[1:25:56.700 --> 1:26:01.700]  But some people aren't going to go along with this and they will be called terrorists.
[1:26:01.700 --> 1:26:06.700]  Now, there's no debating that the military's been taken over by the foreign banks.
[1:26:06.700 --> 1:26:14.700]  There's no debating. This is not our government. There's no debating that the banks have stolen 8.5 trillion. This is all completely illegitimate.
[1:26:14.700 --> 1:26:21.700]  There's no debating. This is the ongoing march of the New World Order.
[1:26:21.700 --> 1:26:28.700]  And the government is completely illegitimate. Now, remember, they're going to say, oh, well, we only put troops on the streets because of the rioting.
[1:26:28.700 --> 1:26:34.700]  They spent decades secretly setting it up. And then in the last few years, not so secretly.
[1:26:34.700 --> 1:26:39.700]  But even when they admit they've built FEMA camps, even when they admit this is for the American people,
[1:26:39.700 --> 1:26:46.700]  even when it's admitted they've trained 26,000 preachers and 23,000 executives to be part of carrying out martial law and being spies,
[1:26:46.700 --> 1:26:55.700]  even when Obama says they're going to have a million-man spy force, that Bill Clinton helped first set up and George Bush expanded, and now Obama's making public.
[1:26:55.700 --> 1:27:02.700]  Even when they admit that, the people go on infowars.com and they say, you're a liar, none of this is true.
[1:27:02.700 --> 1:27:05.700]  They go on the media and they laugh at me and make fun of it.
[1:27:05.700 --> 1:27:15.700]  Even when hundreds of newspapers come out and say, yeah, it's world government, we're taking over, tyranny's good, freedom's bad, we want your guns.
[1:27:15.700 --> 1:27:18.700]  People say it's not real. Not well. Let me tell you what's real.
[1:27:18.700 --> 1:27:21.700]  What's real is the 8.5 trillion they've stolen from your pension funds.
[1:27:21.700 --> 1:27:26.700]  That's why the average person's lost about 60% of their investments.
[1:27:26.700 --> 1:27:34.700]  And they told you your pension funds, your 401Ks, were safe from a pack of criminals. I mean, they didn't set up all this martial law of the last couple of decades.
[1:27:34.700 --> 1:27:40.700]  They didn't gear all this, they didn't stage terror attacks to scare you into accepting police state for nothing.
[1:27:40.700 --> 1:27:45.700]  The police state is the means to the end, total financial control.
[1:27:45.700 --> 1:27:53.700]  National ID cards, showing ID cards to buy and sell, face skins to buy and sell, and it's now all being announced.
[1:27:53.700 --> 1:28:01.700]  This is bondage. The feds didn't start worldwide in every western country from New Zealand to the U.S.
[1:28:01.700 --> 1:28:10.700]  Secretly taking blood 35 years ago, started the same year, 1973, taking blood secretly from every baby that was born.
[1:28:10.700 --> 1:28:15.700]  We told you about it 13 years ago, about seven years ago, we had a U.S. congressman on fighting it.
[1:28:15.700 --> 1:28:26.700]  Now it's all over the news, and they say, yeah. And they try to force mothers who know about it now to make them take the blood and sign a waiver, because people are suing them over it.
[1:28:26.700 --> 1:28:34.700]  There's been a secret DNA database on you. That's how crooked and criminal the people are that have hijacked our government.
[1:28:34.700 --> 1:28:40.700]  And just because they hijacked the plane and put on the captain's outfit, doesn't mean they're the captain.
[1:28:40.700 --> 1:28:47.700]  Be like, if you came home and your wife wasn't there and there was some woman dressed up like her, going, honey, it's me, it's me.
[1:28:47.700 --> 1:28:53.700]  And then most of the public just buy it and go, okay, well, I can't deal with the fact that my wife's gone.
[1:28:53.700 --> 1:28:59.700]  There's some woman here that looks a lot like her, saying that she's my wife. I'll just go ahead and believe it's my wife.
[1:28:59.700 --> 1:29:07.700]  And your kids come home and say that in mama. You say, shut up, you conspiracy theorist. Shut up!
[1:29:07.700 --> 1:29:16.700]  The denial has gotten us in this situation. A bristling military and paramilitary police force who are slitting their own throats,
[1:29:16.700 --> 1:29:20.700]  who are there as a rearguard action to protect the system as they bring us down.
[1:29:20.700 --> 1:29:25.700]  Some of the other news, Google wants its own fast track on the web.
[1:29:25.700 --> 1:29:29.700]  That means Internet 2 shutting down the old web, Wall Street Journal.
[1:29:29.700 --> 1:29:37.700]  Police thwart Moscow rally. Arrest 130 people for no reason. And a lot more.
[1:29:37.700 --> 1:29:42.700]  Dell launches U.S.-based voice contract services for a premium rate. You want to talk to an American?
[1:29:42.700 --> 1:29:45.700]  You got to pay $12.95 extra a month. We'll be right back.
[1:29:45.700 --> 1:29:55.700]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:55.700 --> 1:30:04.700]  Hello, I'm Steve Scheng. For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[1:30:04.700 --> 1:30:15.700]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[1:30:15.700 --> 1:30:19.700]  Well, snap out of it. We now have a deadline. Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[1:30:19.700 --> 1:30:31.700]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22 as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[1:30:31.700 --> 1:30:37.700]  While I take the general at his word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[1:30:37.700 --> 1:30:43.700]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[1:30:43.700 --> 1:30:55.700]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late? Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:30:55.700 --> 1:31:02.700]  Hi, this is Steve Scheng. The spirit of America is independence. The greatest gift of independence is food.
[1:31:02.700 --> 1:31:07.700]  Over one-third of Americans can't afford to buy food and pay their other expenses.
[1:31:07.700 --> 1:31:17.700]  The lines of credit and cards are often cut back or cancelled. Last year the eFoodsDirect holiday food unit was a fun and exciting one-year supply with a great price.
[1:31:17.700 --> 1:31:24.700]  This year to quickly complete our food supply preparations, eFoodsDirect has created a very serious holiday unit.
[1:31:24.700 --> 1:31:31.700]  This super food supply costs $300 less than the basic Liberty one-year supply and has more food.
[1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:39.700]  This holiday food for less than half the cost of last year's groceries. Gift certificates are available for shipments that will not arrive by Christmas.
[1:31:39.700 --> 1:31:48.700]  Food is the gift of life and love this holiday season. Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:31:48.700 --> 1:31:55.700]  That's 800-409-5633. That's 800-409-5633.
[1:31:55.700 --> 1:32:02.700]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:32:02.700 --> 1:32:06.700]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:32:06.700 --> 1:32:08.700]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:32:08.700 --> 1:32:11.700]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:32:11.700 --> 1:32:18.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:32:18.700 --> 1:32:25.700]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:32:25.700 --> 1:32:29.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:32:29.700 --> 1:32:36.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:32:36.700 --> 1:32:40.700]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.
[1:32:40.700 --> 1:32:47.700]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:32:47.700 --> 1:32:52.700]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:33:18.700 --> 1:33:25.700]  Preface this by saying, I woke up because I happen to stumble into urban warfare drills in Texas.
[1:33:25.700 --> 1:33:32.700]  And then I traveled urban warfare drills in 96, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2001.
[1:33:32.700 --> 1:33:37.700]  I've been to more than 30 listeners have sent me video from scores of other events.
[1:33:37.700 --> 1:33:43.700]  The Marines training to confiscate our guns, the Marines training to take over our cities, the Marines training,
[1:33:43.700 --> 1:33:52.700]  and then in places like Swansboro, actually running checkpoints, helping police arrest people in Swansboro, North Carolina on video.
[1:33:52.700 --> 1:33:59.700]  And I post these videos. I made films about it and people thought I hired people and put them in fake uniforms.
[1:33:59.700 --> 1:34:06.700]  When I showed the Marines landing in San Diego, when I showed Marines landing in Oakland, California particularly,
[1:34:06.700 --> 1:34:10.700]  and practicing taking over the city, people thought it was fake.
[1:34:10.700 --> 1:34:19.700]  I mean, they thought I had the Coronado landing and Sea Cobras landing and a thousand Marines and foreign troops admitting it was for America.
[1:34:19.700 --> 1:34:21.700]  They couldn't believe it in police day 2000.
[1:34:21.700 --> 1:34:28.700]  And my friend, Rick Linklater, a director laughed and said, man, that would cost 20 million bucks just to shoot one of those scenes.
[1:34:28.700 --> 1:34:31.700]  No, it was real, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:34:31.700 --> 1:34:36.700]  Well, now it's all over the news. The Army Times says they want to put 20,000 combat troops on the streets of America.
[1:34:36.700 --> 1:34:42.700]  They've been quietly gearing up for this for a long time. They had Marines secretly dressed up in police uniforms in the late 80s.
[1:34:42.700 --> 1:34:50.700]  I have interviews with them, busting down gun dealers' doors. That's in road to tyranny, the film I made in 2002.
[1:34:50.700 --> 1:34:57.700]  But now all over the nation, we're getting reports of Marines at DUI checkpoints aiding the police.
[1:34:57.700 --> 1:35:10.700]  And the big issue here is they told KCDZ FM and Joshua Tree, beautiful area of California, that the Highway Patrol said the Marines will not be there.
[1:35:10.700 --> 1:35:14.700]  It's a conspiracy theory. But people showed up and there were the Marines.
[1:35:14.700 --> 1:35:24.700]  We called the chips. They now admit that, yes, the Marines are aiding them and observing them unless they're a military personnel and then they're arresting them off base.
[1:35:24.700 --> 1:35:28.700]  So they're now spinning it. The Marines early on admitted they were doing this.
[1:35:28.700 --> 1:35:34.700]  Now they say, well, we're only observing and we have one of the Marine Corps spokesmen about this on tomorrow.
[1:35:34.700 --> 1:35:42.700]  The point is, this is to acclimate us. This is to condition us. And the bigger issue is the deceptiveness about all of this.
[1:35:42.700 --> 1:35:50.700]  The way this is being done, quietly to acclimate the public. But every time you confront them, I mean, I remember calling the Marines about Swansboro.
[1:35:50.700 --> 1:35:55.700]  And they just said, we weren't there. We didn't do that. That's not true.
[1:35:55.700 --> 1:36:01.700]  And it's the Marines. We have them training and then being given orders.
[1:36:01.700 --> 1:36:07.700]  Because some of the video was, well, point is, let's go to our guest before we run out of time with him.
[1:36:07.700 --> 1:36:26.700]  He's Gary Dinyou and we appreciate Derry coming on, or Derry Dinyou, excuse me, from KCDZ FM 1077 in Joshua Tree, California, who's been on top of this from day one.
[1:36:26.700 --> 1:36:33.700]  There's also been some great articles written on the local blogs. And of course, the Kurt Nemo's also been a story at infowars.com.
[1:36:33.700 --> 1:36:37.700]  Gary, tell us exactly what's going on here.
[1:36:37.700 --> 1:36:47.700]  Well, what happened is I'm a news director of a local radio station here in Joshua Tree, Alex. And we received a fact from the CHP last week on Wednesday,
[1:36:47.700 --> 1:36:56.700]  announcing they were going to do a sobriety driver license checkpoint in the Yucca Valley area with the help of the United States Marine Corps,
[1:36:56.700 --> 1:37:05.700]  its military police with them. Well, being somewhat familiar with Posse Comitatus, I contacted a constitutional lawyer out of Palm Springs who told me
[1:37:05.700 --> 1:37:13.700]  even the presence of marked military police units would give any civilian the reasonable expectation that the use of military forces imminent
[1:37:13.700 --> 1:37:17.700]  and violated the Posse Comitatus statutes. No question about it.
[1:37:17.700 --> 1:37:26.700]  So on Friday, the day of the checkpoint, we ran a very strong editorial questioning why military police are being used in a civilian enforcement action.
[1:37:26.700 --> 1:37:35.700]  Received another fact from the CHP at about 11.30 that day, which indicated the military had been pulled out of that checkpoint.
[1:37:35.700 --> 1:37:47.700]  But guess what? They had that checkpoint Friday night and marked military police units with uniformed Marine military police were assisting in the checkpoint
[1:37:47.700 --> 1:37:51.700]  in the Yucca Valley Friday evening here in San Bernardino County.
[1:37:51.700 --> 1:37:52.700]  Were they armed?
[1:37:52.700 --> 1:38:00.700]  I do not know, sir. I was not there myself. However, two of my employees said they were uniformed Marines at the checkpoint,
[1:38:00.700 --> 1:38:03.700]  but they did not indicate to me whether they could tell they were armed or not.
[1:38:03.700 --> 1:38:07.700]  It's absolutely essential to find out if they were under arms, as you know.
[1:38:07.700 --> 1:38:18.700]  So being the news director there on KCDZFM, websites KCDZFM.com, I would love it if you do another report with them,
[1:38:18.700 --> 1:38:23.700]  perhaps with those employees as witnesses on air and then put it up on YouTube.
[1:38:23.700 --> 1:38:30.700]  Believe me, millions of people would want to hear that report because there's so much denial dealing with this.
[1:38:30.700 --> 1:38:36.700]  Whether the CDC did two things wrong, actually, in the initial sobriety driver's license checkpoint facts.
[1:38:36.700 --> 1:38:40.700]  They refused to indicate the location of the checkpoint.
[1:38:40.700 --> 1:38:45.700]  And I know the Supreme Court has ruled on that as an entrapment operation.
[1:38:45.700 --> 1:38:49.700]  So we called them back and said, hey, you've got to tell us where this will be.
[1:38:49.700 --> 1:38:52.700]  They said, no, the law says we only have to tell you two hours ahead of time.
[1:38:52.700 --> 1:38:55.700]  So here's the phone number. Call it at 7 p.m.
[1:38:55.700 --> 1:38:58.700]  And if you call it 7, it'll tell you where the checkpoint will be at 9.
[1:38:58.700 --> 1:39:05.700]  But we called that number 10 times between 7 and 8.30 and nobody ever answered.
[1:39:05.700 --> 1:39:09.700]  So not only did they bring the Marines in when they said they would not,
[1:39:09.700 --> 1:39:14.700]  but they did not indicate the location of the checkpoint, which they are supposed to do under the law.
[1:39:14.700 --> 1:39:17.700]  Okay, let's get this chain of events straight for everybody.
[1:39:17.700 --> 1:39:20.700]  They send out a press release.
[1:39:20.700 --> 1:39:25.700]  You report your news talk station, reports on the fact.
[1:39:25.700 --> 1:39:30.700]  They ran an editorial against using military force and civilian enforcement.
[1:39:30.700 --> 1:39:35.700]  Okay, and then they send out another release saying, we're not doing that.
[1:39:35.700 --> 1:39:39.700]  Now, did they say we never said that or did they say now we're not doing that?
[1:39:39.700 --> 1:39:42.700]  Well, I have both facts. So they can't say we never said that.
[1:39:42.700 --> 1:39:47.700]  The first press release said there was the CHP, the Sheriff's Department,
[1:39:47.700 --> 1:39:51.700]  and the United States Marine Corps Military Police.
[1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:56.700]  The second fact that they put out deletes the military police.
[1:39:56.700 --> 1:39:59.700]  It's the same facts, but they deleted the military police,
[1:39:59.700 --> 1:40:04.700]  leading anyone reasonable to believe that the military police would not be involved.
[1:40:04.700 --> 1:40:11.700]  And perhaps they listened and paid attention to our editorial accusing them of violating Posse Comitatis.
[1:40:11.700 --> 1:40:13.700]  But as you say, it's all pretty sneaky.
[1:40:13.700 --> 1:40:17.700]  Not only were the Marines there also, but they never told us where it was going to be.
[1:40:17.700 --> 1:40:21.700]  Well, that's what the Marines do. Again, I'm not against the military culture.
[1:40:21.700 --> 1:40:25.700]  It's a necessary evil, and I will use that term throughout history.
[1:40:25.700 --> 1:40:31.700]  That's very, very dangerous. You know, people basically brainwashed, sleep deprivation, shaved heads.
[1:40:31.700 --> 1:40:34.700]  You know, you're now in an elite order.
[1:40:34.700 --> 1:40:37.700]  They have chance about killing commies for mommy.
[1:40:37.700 --> 1:40:41.700]  And now they take them back from Iraq.
[1:40:41.700 --> 1:40:45.700]  They take the former military personnel. They put them into police units.
[1:40:45.700 --> 1:40:47.700]  Most of them have served two, three, four tours.
[1:40:47.700 --> 1:40:50.700]  They've got post-traumatic stress disorder.
[1:40:50.700 --> 1:40:54.700]  And then now they, for decades, the police call us civilians.
[1:40:54.700 --> 1:40:56.700]  They teach them it's an us against the mentality.
[1:40:56.700 --> 1:41:04.700]  You don't use the military against the people because they are designed to fight enemies, kill people, and break things.
[1:41:04.700 --> 1:41:12.700]  And classic military terminology, classic military mindset, using deception, lying, not answering the phone,
[1:41:12.700 --> 1:41:18.700]  not following the law, not telling you where the checkpoint is, saying the Marines aren't going to be there,
[1:41:18.700 --> 1:41:20.700]  saying the Marines aren't going to be there.
[1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:24.700]  Again, military tactics against the American people out of the gates.
[1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:31.700]  Anything else, sir, that your employees there at the talk station, new talk station, told you about what they saw at this checkpoint?
[1:41:31.700 --> 1:41:37.700]  Well, just that there's very strong military presence there because we had had a talk show Friday morning.
[1:41:37.700 --> 1:41:42.700]  We had a one-hour talk show at the radio station. And this is a military town.
[1:41:42.700 --> 1:41:47.700]  The 29 Palm Marine Corps base is right next to where the radio station is located.
[1:41:47.700 --> 1:41:49.700]  And there's 15,000 Marines out there.
[1:41:49.700 --> 1:41:51.700]  So it's very interesting the talk show.
[1:41:51.700 --> 1:41:57.700]  Most of the people agreed that, yeah, the Marines are concerned about their own with traffic laws,
[1:41:57.700 --> 1:42:02.700]  but on the other hand, they do not belong in a civilian enforcement operation.
[1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:09.700]  And here in this military town, most of the listeners on the talk show agreed that this was an improper use of military force
[1:42:09.700 --> 1:42:14.700]  against the civilians in this area here in San Bernardino County.
[1:42:14.700 --> 1:42:18.700]  And of course, it's all sold in the name of for everybody's safety.
[1:42:18.700 --> 1:42:20.700]  And, well, you're not for drunks, are you?
[1:42:20.700 --> 1:42:28.700]  Did you see the Army Times report two months ago where they admitted, first they said 5,000, now it's 20,000 combat troops from Iraq
[1:42:28.700 --> 1:42:34.700]  and that they're going to be doing PR, not just dealing with insurgents and rioters for civil insurrection.
[1:42:34.700 --> 1:42:39.700]  And that's in the article, sir. It also states, so to pull it up if you don't know,
[1:42:39.700 --> 1:42:46.700]  it also states in there that they're going to have the jaws of life out helping an auto accident.
[1:42:46.700 --> 1:42:48.700]  So that'll be the new PR.
[1:42:48.700 --> 1:42:52.700]  What, you're against the Army and Marines helping at car wrecks?
[1:42:52.700 --> 1:42:58.700]  Well, what we got from the CHP is that they were going to be there, so if a military member was arrested,
[1:42:58.700 --> 1:43:03.700]  they could notify their command. Apparently, they don't know how to use telephones.
[1:43:03.700 --> 1:43:07.700]  That's their spin. I mean, that is, look, sir, I've seen that a hundred times.
[1:43:07.700 --> 1:43:12.700]  Whenever we've seen this other places, but the news would never report on it for some reason,
[1:43:12.700 --> 1:43:14.700]  we would get video or listeners would get video.
[1:43:14.700 --> 1:43:18.700]  They always say, oh, it was just a drill, or we were just looking for some of our own people.
[1:43:18.700 --> 1:43:22.700]  We also questioned this with the military base, and they spokesman for the military base,
[1:43:22.700 --> 1:43:30.700]  that they were just going along as observers, that they would not be involved in any hands-on arresting or hands-on with civilians.
[1:43:30.700 --> 1:43:36.700]  Again, my point being, even their presence constitutes a threat to civilian Americans.
[1:43:36.700 --> 1:43:41.700]  We don't need to see the military in our streets enforcing our laws.
[1:43:41.700 --> 1:43:47.700]  Bottom line, sir, though, you are aware that they've announced in CBS
[1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:52.700]  and the Washington Post that they are going to put regular troops on the streets of America?
[1:43:52.700 --> 1:43:54.700]  Yes, I have heard that report.
[1:43:54.700 --> 1:43:58.700]  I mean, my point is, I learned of this in 96, and no one wanted to believe me,
[1:43:58.700 --> 1:44:01.700]  and I'm telling you because you sound like you're an educated fellow,
[1:44:01.700 --> 1:44:05.700]  and I certainly want you to educate yourself more and then warn the locals.
[1:44:05.700 --> 1:44:08.700]  Well, I'm in radio, Alex. I have to be educated.
[1:44:08.700 --> 1:44:10.700]  Absolutely. You've got to know all the news and the info.
[1:44:10.700 --> 1:44:12.700]  Well, you know what? You do stay on top of the news.
[1:44:12.700 --> 1:44:15.700]  I mean, I'm proud of people in news radio because you do have to stay up on it.
[1:44:15.700 --> 1:44:18.700]  We're a dying breed. There are a few of us out there.
[1:44:18.700 --> 1:44:20.700]  Well, all I could say is this.
[1:44:20.700 --> 1:44:26.700]  We commend you for standing up for the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the 1878 Posse-Combin-Tottis law,
[1:44:26.700 --> 1:44:30.700]  and I would, sir, can you, when we go to break and I'll let you go,
[1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:38.700]  can I give you our fax number, and can you fax me those two press releases from the chips?
[1:44:38.700 --> 1:44:42.700]  I'll be happy to. I'll send you the first one that said that the military police will be involved,
[1:44:42.700 --> 1:44:46.700]  and then the second one, when they didn't mention the military police,
[1:44:46.700 --> 1:44:50.700]  after we ran an editorial questioning their actions.
[1:44:50.700 --> 1:44:53.700]  Well, I hope my listeners, I know you guys are short-staffed and busy.
[1:44:53.700 --> 1:44:58.700]  I hope my listeners will tune in every morning when you're on to watch this as it unfolds
[1:44:58.700 --> 1:45:04.700]  so that folks can then put that up on YouTube, the audio, so people all across the country can actually hear it for themselves,
[1:45:04.700 --> 1:45:09.700]  because there are people now, because some people are calling the Marines and the chips,
[1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:13.700]  and the Marines and chips are saying it never happened, and that we're basically crazy.
[1:45:13.700 --> 1:45:19.700]  Well, I'll be happy to send you a copy of the CHP press releases with a nice little logo on the top.
[1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:25.700]  Why do you think they're so deceptive? I mean, it's not just creepy in Third World
[1:45:25.700 --> 1:45:28.700]  to have them announcing they're going to put troops on the streets.
[1:45:28.700 --> 1:45:31.700]  Well, I think they honestly believe they're doing it for the greater good.
[1:45:31.700 --> 1:45:36.700]  Up in our area, we do have a large Marine base here. We do have a traffic problem.
[1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:39.700]  Marines and civilians are speeding and doing DUI.
[1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:44.700]  The general, the commanding general of this Marine base just went to the Yucca Valley Town Council
[1:45:44.700 --> 1:45:48.700]  and used this quote, and I have this tape if you'd like it.
[1:45:48.700 --> 1:45:51.700]  You take care of your idiots, and we'll take care of ours.
[1:45:51.700 --> 1:45:56.700]  And they're asking these civilian authorities to partner with the military authorities
[1:45:56.700 --> 1:46:01.700]  in keeping the speeds down, making traffic more safe, making the highway more safe.
[1:46:01.700 --> 1:46:07.700]  So I believe the CHP thinks that they are cooperating with the local base by bringing the military into these...
[1:46:07.700 --> 1:46:11.700]  But, sir, there's always been problems with drunks in and off of bases in any community.
[1:46:11.700 --> 1:46:16.700]  Why suddenly? I mean, what I'm telling you is there is a large covert plan
[1:46:16.700 --> 1:46:20.700]  to merge the military and the police and use the military against the American people.
[1:46:20.700 --> 1:46:24.700]  It's now out in the open, and so, sure, the locals are being manipulated.
[1:46:24.700 --> 1:46:27.700]  I'm sure even the commander of the base, but do you remember in the mid-90s,
[1:46:27.700 --> 1:46:32.700]  the 29 Palms survey that got national attention in the Wall Street Journal
[1:46:32.700 --> 1:46:36.700]  and other places about would they fire on U.S. citizens? Would they confiscate guns?
[1:46:36.700 --> 1:46:39.700]  I am not familiar with that survey, sir.
[1:46:39.700 --> 1:46:43.700]  You can read it. 29 Palms Marine Corps study, believe me.
[1:46:43.700 --> 1:46:45.700]  This is part of something bigger, my friend.
[1:46:45.700 --> 1:46:47.700]  I mean, why would they be deceptive about it?
[1:46:47.700 --> 1:46:51.700]  No, and that's what bothered me the most, because I have a very good relationship with the CHP
[1:46:51.700 --> 1:46:55.700]  and they changed their stories in the middle of the stream.
[1:46:55.700 --> 1:46:57.700]  I was quite surprised with that.
[1:46:57.700 --> 1:46:59.700]  Let's because they know it's a felony.
[1:46:59.700 --> 1:47:03.700]  Yeah, and we're running another story today questioning those actions.
[1:47:03.700 --> 1:47:05.700]  We have not heard from them yet.
[1:47:05.700 --> 1:47:08.700]  What time is that going to be running so folks can tune in and...
[1:47:08.700 --> 1:47:13.700]  Well, that'll run again at noon for five and six in our local news,
[1:47:13.700 --> 1:47:18.700]  but if you can't pick up the radio station, we do have audio on the air at our website,
[1:47:18.700 --> 1:47:20.700]  and can I give that website?
[1:47:20.700 --> 1:47:23.700]  Yes, it's KCDZFM.com.
[1:47:23.700 --> 1:47:27.700]  There's also a transcript of the editorial ran on Friday,
[1:47:27.700 --> 1:47:31.700]  then audio of the news are running today questioning the CHP's actions.
[1:47:31.700 --> 1:47:34.700]  And that's in the news section of KCDZFM.com?
[1:47:34.700 --> 1:47:36.700]  That is correct, sir.
[1:47:36.700 --> 1:47:41.700]  Okay, and you guys are audio streaming or are you just posting the reports?
[1:47:41.700 --> 1:47:45.700]  We are not audio streaming the news and posting transcripts,
[1:47:45.700 --> 1:47:48.700]  so we have both audio of the news and transcripts.
[1:47:48.700 --> 1:47:51.700]  We don't stream the station, but we do stream our news,
[1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:53.700]  because we own the copyright on that.
[1:47:53.700 --> 1:47:54.700]  No, that's good.
[1:47:54.700 --> 1:47:58.700]  I just want folks to be able to tune in and hear it for themselves,
[1:47:58.700 --> 1:48:00.700]  because they can, it's posted right now.
[1:48:00.700 --> 1:48:04.700]  Well, there's so much denial about this, because people instinctively know
[1:48:04.700 --> 1:48:10.700]  it's Third World, it's Communist China, Communist Russia, Nazi Germany to have troops on the streets,
[1:48:10.700 --> 1:48:13.700]  and now it's happening and people just don't want to believe it.
[1:48:13.700 --> 1:48:17.700]  Right here in beautiful downtown Joshua Tree, California.
[1:48:17.700 --> 1:48:21.700]  What percentage of the people in your town are upset by this?
[1:48:21.700 --> 1:48:23.700]  I mean, how are the calls running?
[1:48:23.700 --> 1:48:30.700]  Well, the calls are running about 80, 20, 80% who were unhappy with it or upset with it,
[1:48:30.700 --> 1:48:35.700]  and 20% because this is a military town or just blind loyalty to anything the Marines do,
[1:48:35.700 --> 1:48:41.700]  and how dare you question anything the Marines want to do in this Marine town?
[1:48:41.700 --> 1:48:42.700]  Unbelievable.
[1:48:42.700 --> 1:48:46.700]  You know, I don't even have to move to Mexico now to live in a place like Mexico with troops on the streets.
[1:48:46.700 --> 1:48:47.700]  I mean, this is insane.
[1:48:47.700 --> 1:48:50.700]  They had troops on the streets in Yucca Valley Friday night.
[1:48:50.700 --> 1:48:53.700]  Now, they said they're doing this through the 12th through Christmas.
[1:48:53.700 --> 1:48:58.700]  Have they suspended it or can people go out there and catch them any night of the week doing this now?
[1:48:58.700 --> 1:49:03.700]  Well, they told us they're doing the 12th through the 30th, but they have not announced any other locations,
[1:49:03.700 --> 1:49:07.700]  and that date of 12th through 30th is through the entire San Bernardino County,
[1:49:07.700 --> 1:49:09.700]  which is the largest county in the country.
[1:49:09.700 --> 1:49:12.700]  As a matter of fact, it is as big as three Eastern states.
[1:49:12.700 --> 1:49:17.700]  So they will be doing these checkpoints at various places throughout the county.
[1:49:17.700 --> 1:49:19.700]  The one in Yucca Valley was Friday night.
[1:49:19.700 --> 1:49:23.700]  So they have not announced to us where they would be conducting other checkpoints.
[1:49:23.700 --> 1:49:32.700]  So you're just driving through the desert and you run into Marines at a checkpoint with the police.
[1:49:32.700 --> 1:49:34.700]  Sir, can you...
[1:49:34.700 --> 1:49:36.700]  I know you're busy as the news manager there.
[1:49:36.700 --> 1:49:41.700]  Can you go talk to those two employees so I can call you back and just find out my writer?
[1:49:41.700 --> 1:49:43.700]  Specifically, if they had guns?
[1:49:43.700 --> 1:49:50.700]  Yeah, they will not arrive to work till late this afternoon, but I will call them and I will call your producer back.
[1:49:50.700 --> 1:49:52.700]  I will talk to them and call your producer back later on.
[1:49:52.700 --> 1:49:54.700]  Well, I tell you, if they had...
[1:49:54.700 --> 1:49:56.700]  And I wish somebody would have gotten footage of this.
[1:49:56.700 --> 1:49:58.700]  I mean, I've gotten footage over and over again.
[1:49:58.700 --> 1:50:00.700]  People still deny it, so...
[1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:06.700]  I mean, is that spooky, though, to know that there's been a long-term covert operation to do this?
[1:50:06.700 --> 1:50:17.700]  Yes, this is the first I've heard of a long-term covert operation, but I did indeed know that military were involved in the checkpoint Friday night in Yucca Valley.
[1:50:17.700 --> 1:50:19.700]  Where specifically was that checkpoint?
[1:50:19.700 --> 1:50:25.700]  Right in front of Home Depot on State Route 62, the main highway through the community.
[1:50:25.700 --> 1:50:31.700]  Well, we need our listeners all over California to go up there, even if you have to travel, and just...
[1:50:31.700 --> 1:50:38.700]  In fact, $1,000 prize, and this goes for your station. Whoever gets me video of that and gets it to me.
[1:50:38.700 --> 1:50:42.700]  A $1,000 prize for that. How's that sound, Gary?
[1:50:42.700 --> 1:50:45.700]  Well, we'll see if anybody got any video of it, Alex.
[1:50:45.700 --> 1:50:47.700]  And it's Gary Dignio, correct, sir?
[1:50:47.700 --> 1:50:48.700]  That is correct.
[1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:52.700]  Well, we really appreciate you joining us, and as this unfolds, perhaps we'll have you back on.
[1:50:52.700 --> 1:50:53.700]  No problem.
[1:50:53.700 --> 1:50:55.700]  Thank you. I'm going to talk to you when we go to break.
[1:50:55.700 --> 1:51:04.700]  It won't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls. Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free,
[1:51:04.700 --> 1:51:07.700]  and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:16.700]  By calling 908-6912608, or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[1:51:16.700 --> 1:51:24.700]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[1:51:24.700 --> 1:51:30.700]  Call 908-6912608, or visit hempusa.org today.
[1:51:30.700 --> 1:51:38.700]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future, and food will be your greatest asset.
[1:51:38.700 --> 1:51:46.700]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[1:51:46.700 --> 1:51:55.700]  So don't delay. Call today. 908-6912608, and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you.
[1:51:55.700 --> 1:52:03.700]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:52:03.700 --> 1:52:06.700]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:52:06.700 --> 1:52:11.700]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage, was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:52:11.700 --> 1:52:21.700]  a latter commission at CFR. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just patissim to grow at our own door.
[1:52:21.700 --> 1:52:27.700]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:27.700 --> 1:52:34.700]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:52:34.700 --> 1:52:38.700]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:38.700 --> 1:52:41.700]  What the hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue?
[1:52:41.700 --> 1:53:09.700]  The government has not told the truth. In five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:19.700]  What else can 3 oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone do?
[1:53:19.700 --> 1:53:24.700]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[1:53:24.700 --> 1:53:29.700]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy? Ionic zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[1:53:29.700 --> 1:53:36.700]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[1:53:36.700 --> 1:53:46.700]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic zone ozone generators by going to IonicZone.com or calling 800-549-9535.
[1:53:46.700 --> 1:53:55.700]  That's I-O-N-I-C-Zone.com or toll-free 800-549-9535 Ionic Zone.
[1:53:55.700 --> 1:54:09.700]  Come, you masters of war, here to build the big guns, here to build the death planes.
[1:54:09.700 --> 1:54:15.700]  Throughout history, it's always the military and police used to enforce tyranny.
[1:54:15.700 --> 1:54:23.700]  98% of the time, 99% of the time, they are tyrannical, they are abusive, they are evil.
[1:54:23.700 --> 1:54:31.700]  Throughout history, they are the ones that take the bank accounts, the farms, the ranches.
[1:54:31.700 --> 1:54:42.700]  They are the ones that evil in government, that private corporate interests use to enslave the people from Julius Caesar's time to Adolf Hitler's time.
[1:54:42.700 --> 1:54:49.700]  Look at Rome, a great republic, greater in its time than the United States is today per capita.
[1:54:49.700 --> 1:54:53.700]  And now you see what happened to them.
[1:54:53.700 --> 1:54:57.700]  Powerful interests say, hey, we've got control of the military.
[1:54:57.700 --> 1:55:03.700]  Let's use a pretext, terrorism, environmentalism, whatever the case may be, to take over.
[1:55:03.700 --> 1:55:06.700]  And they have a huge covert secret operation.
[1:55:06.700 --> 1:55:12.700]  Now it's not secret anymore and they will lie to you, they will say anything to you.
[1:55:12.700 --> 1:55:18.700]  You can call up the Highway Patrol and they'll say, no such thing is going on here.
[1:55:18.700 --> 1:55:22.700]  Then you call another day and they go, well, they are helping.
[1:55:22.700 --> 1:55:27.700]  Then you call another day and they say, I don't know what you're talking about.
[1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:29.700]  It's all about deception.
[1:55:29.700 --> 1:55:34.700]  I mean, take the police crime labs in New York and LA and Houston and Dallas.
[1:55:34.700 --> 1:55:42.700]  I mean, just type in crime lab caught in fraud or crime lab caught framing or crime lab shut down.
[1:55:42.700 --> 1:55:48.700]  And they don't just frame a few people, they frame whoever they want and the federal courts are even worse.
[1:55:48.700 --> 1:56:00.700]  The country is completely bankrupt and run by criminals with a bunch of do-gooders going, well, I think we need the Marines in America.
[1:56:00.700 --> 1:56:03.700]  I think we need to be like Baghdad with checkpoints.
[1:56:03.700 --> 1:56:11.700]  And then notice they magically start doing IED, improvised explosive device training.
[1:56:11.700 --> 1:56:21.700]  Notice they start in the last two years training every police department to prepare for bombs, to prepare for bombs on the side of the road and bombs at businesses.
[1:56:21.700 --> 1:56:24.700]  And then magically there's a bombing in Kansas.
[1:56:24.700 --> 1:56:40.700]  Magically there's a bombing Friday afternoon in Oregon killing two police, the bomb disposal technician and a police officer injuring the police chief.
[1:56:40.700 --> 1:56:49.700]  And they went and there was one decoy bomb to train him to not handle the other one more carefully and then they went to the real bomb.
[1:56:49.700 --> 1:56:52.700]  Now that was a mind that came up with that.
[1:56:52.700 --> 1:57:02.700]  And I bet my bottom dollar that's a Fed or it was feds supplying the bomb to some mental patient white supremacist.
[1:57:02.700 --> 1:57:12.700]  And you watch when they catch the white supremacist they're going to be in former military who had been in a government psychiatric facility.
[1:57:12.700 --> 1:57:13.700]  What does Northwood say?
[1:57:13.700 --> 1:57:20.700]  It says we'll plant bombs in banks and businesses, we'll shoot people on the streets and then we'll grab patsies.
[1:57:20.700 --> 1:57:27.700]  And then we learn the patsies are former military in mental institutions.
[1:57:27.700 --> 1:57:34.700]  As long as the person can't defend themselves in just a muttering idiot, he'll have swastikas all over him, shaved head.
[1:57:34.700 --> 1:57:46.700]  It'll come out that an FBI informant went and found the guy or an FBI agent went and found the guy, gave him the bomb, gave him everything, and then they called those cops in to kill him.
[1:57:46.700 --> 1:57:48.700]  And the cops won't care.
[1:57:48.700 --> 1:57:50.700]  They'll be like, well, at least we get to hate the American people.
[1:57:50.700 --> 1:57:57.700]  So the FBI bombed us, doesn't matter they had to do it to stop white supremacist.
[1:57:57.700 --> 1:58:03.700]  Then Obama can get up and talk about how there's all these racists out there and we got to have spies spying on people.
[1:58:03.700 --> 1:58:12.700]  You're going to see lots of bombings, lots of bombings, and then the feds have only got a stage 10, 15, 20 little bombings, and then copycats are going to pick up.
[1:58:12.700 --> 1:58:15.700]  See, the feds are trying to trigger.
[1:58:15.700 --> 1:58:24.700]  And I've seen this a million times, folks, I know what I'm looking at. 95% chance this is a government bombing, 100% chance it's provocateur.
[1:58:24.700 --> 1:58:26.700]  Or I'd say 99.
[1:58:26.700 --> 1:58:29.700]  Because of everything surrounding it.
[1:58:29.700 --> 1:58:45.700]  And then see, they want to cause the public to really start fighting them.
[1:58:45.700 --> 1:58:52.700]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:52.700 --> 1:58:54.700]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:58:54.700 --> 1:58:56.700]  But who is the enemy?
[1:58:56.700 --> 1:58:57.700]  Bin Laden.
[1:58:57.700 --> 1:58:59.700]  This is his ammo.
[1:58:59.700 --> 1:59:01.700]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:59:01.700 --> 1:59:08.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:08.700 --> 1:59:15.700]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:59:15.700 --> 1:59:19.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:19.700 --> 1:59:29.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:59:29.700 --> 1:59:30.700]  Fabled Enemies.
[1:59:30.700 --> 1:59:38.700]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:38.700 --> 1:59:47.700]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:59:47.700 --> 1:59:54.700]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:54.700 --> 1:59:57.700]  Big Brother.
[1:59:57.700 --> 1:59:59.700]  Mainstream media.
[1:59:59.700 --> 2:00:01.700]  Government cover-ups.
[2:00:01.700 --> 2:00:02.700]  You want answers?
[2:00:02.700 --> 2:00:04.700]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:04.700 --> 2:00:08.700]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:08.700 --> 2:00:31.700]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:31.700 --> 2:00:40.700]  We got one of the most prolific and successful online video of directors joining us in respect.
[2:00:40.700 --> 2:00:43.700]  I'm on for about 15 minutes.
[2:00:43.700 --> 2:00:46.700]  John Watkins is named from Cardiff, England.
[2:00:46.700 --> 2:00:50.700]  And I want to have him up for most of an hour because I want to not just get into the censorship.
[2:00:50.700 --> 2:00:54.700]  He's under what Google or YouTube are announcing, the censor.
[2:00:54.700 --> 2:00:59.700]  I wanted to get into overall the way they're going to shut down and kill the web.
[2:00:59.700 --> 2:01:04.700]  Now listen, everybody's emailing me right now saying, Alex, you were right again.
[2:01:04.700 --> 2:01:05.700]  How did you know?
[2:01:05.700 --> 2:01:07.700]  And people are saying he must be an agent.
[2:01:07.700 --> 2:01:12.700]  How does he always know how they're going to attack, what they're going to do?
[2:01:12.700 --> 2:01:18.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's like I say, if I read the TV guide and it's Monday night,
[2:01:18.700 --> 2:01:22.700]  and it tells me Monday night football is coming on at this time in this station,
[2:01:22.700 --> 2:01:29.700]  I tell my buddies, hey, let's go watch the game at the local bar, you know, hypothetically,
[2:01:29.700 --> 2:01:33.700]  they don't pat me on the back and say I'm a genius.
[2:01:33.700 --> 2:01:37.700]  That's what's so frustrating about all of this.
[2:01:37.700 --> 2:01:40.700]  They've announced they're shutting the web down.
[2:01:40.700 --> 2:01:42.700]  They've announced how they're going to do it.
[2:01:42.700 --> 2:01:48.700]  I told you five years ago when they announced it, they really announced it seven, eight years ago in 2000.
[2:01:48.700 --> 2:01:54.700]  I learned about it in 2002, 2003.
[2:01:54.700 --> 2:02:04.700]  I mean, I knew they had ways to censor ways to filter, but I didn't know about Internet Tube until about 2002.
[2:02:04.700 --> 2:02:13.700]  And then I sat there for hours reading their public statements and their plan with the governments of China,
[2:02:13.700 --> 2:02:21.700]  Japan, Europe, Russia, the United States, and they are going to shut the web down,
[2:02:21.700 --> 2:02:23.700]  and they told us how they're going to do it.
[2:02:23.700 --> 2:02:25.700]  And they even wrote articles about it.
[2:02:25.700 --> 2:02:27.700]  It's even been in the news.
[2:02:27.700 --> 2:02:31.700]  All, and then I can't get the public to believe me.
[2:02:31.700 --> 2:02:37.700]  I do videos, I post the articles, I put it on the web, and I'll go look at the YouTube comments,
[2:02:37.700 --> 2:02:43.700]  and you know, there'll be 100,000 people that are 200,000 to 300,000 in the case of an up-respect video that have watched it,
[2:02:43.700 --> 2:02:49.700]  and have the comments, oh, he's a big liar, he's a government agent lying to us.
[2:02:49.700 --> 2:02:56.700]  Instead of, regardless of who I am, if you haven't been noticed, I'm a good guy, with the track record,
[2:02:56.700 --> 2:02:59.700]  why don't you at least address what I'm saying?
[2:02:59.700 --> 2:03:05.700]  It's like the last hour with the Marines lying about running checkpoints.
[2:03:05.700 --> 2:03:07.700]  We got one of them coming on tomorrow.
[2:03:07.700 --> 2:03:10.700]  They think they're going to acclimate the enemy.
[2:03:10.700 --> 2:03:14.700]  They think they're going to come on here and, you know, talk down to us slaves, and it's going to fool us.
[2:03:14.700 --> 2:03:16.700]  We know you're here to win a victory.
[2:03:16.700 --> 2:03:17.700]  We understand that.
[2:03:17.700 --> 2:03:20.700]  We understand we've been designated the enemy.
[2:03:20.700 --> 2:03:24.700]  We're giving you a chance to come over and join the American people, instead of being traitors.
[2:03:24.700 --> 2:03:26.700]  And I'm tired of your crap.
[2:03:26.700 --> 2:03:34.700]  I'm tired of them lying to my face when I know exactly what they're up to.
[2:03:34.700 --> 2:03:36.700]  I'm sick of it.
[2:03:36.700 --> 2:03:37.700]  They've built FEMA camps.
[2:03:37.700 --> 2:03:39.700]  They're coming after your guns.
[2:03:39.700 --> 2:03:41.700]  They're going to shut the web down.
[2:03:41.700 --> 2:03:43.700]  You got me?
[2:03:43.700 --> 2:03:51.700]  And if you just get angry, and if you just stop being children and living in denial about what's happening,
[2:03:51.700 --> 2:03:54.700]  we could turn this around and they wouldn't be able to.
[2:03:54.700 --> 2:03:57.700]  Now, they've already stolen 60% of the pension funds.
[2:03:57.700 --> 2:04:00.700]  In a couple months, it's all going to be gone dumbasses.
[2:04:00.700 --> 2:04:01.700]  Excuse me.
[2:04:01.700 --> 2:04:02.700]  Excuse me.
[2:04:02.700 --> 2:04:03.700]  I'm sorry.
[2:04:03.700 --> 2:04:04.700]  Don't believe me.
[2:04:04.700 --> 2:04:06.700]  It's all going to be too late.
[2:04:06.700 --> 2:04:08.700]  You stupid freaks.
[2:04:08.700 --> 2:04:14.700]  It's not too late to take the government back and arrest these people and get our money back.
[2:04:14.700 --> 2:04:17.700]  The United States is being blown out financially.
[2:04:17.700 --> 2:04:20.700]  They're going to come in and suppress us militarily afterward.
[2:04:20.700 --> 2:04:23.700]  Now, do you care about this?
[2:04:23.700 --> 2:04:25.700]  Do you want to try to stop this?
[2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:29.700]  Or do you want to continue to allow them to use military psychology on you,
[2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:34.700]  telling you this is not an assault when it is an assault?
[2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:38.700]  I want to tell the troops and the government, anybody else involved in this takeover,
[2:04:38.700 --> 2:04:40.700]  you are treasonous traitors.
[2:04:40.700 --> 2:04:41.700]  There's no doubting it.
[2:04:41.700 --> 2:04:43.700]  Your bosses are openly stealing us blind.
[2:04:43.700 --> 2:04:44.700]  You're openly criminal.
[2:04:44.700 --> 2:04:46.700]  You openly push torture.
[2:04:46.700 --> 2:04:52.700]  You are disgraced to this country and the American flag and your enemies of this country.
[2:04:52.700 --> 2:04:56.700]  When you're out driving this holiday season, keep in mind you're being watched.
[2:04:56.700 --> 2:05:02.700]  Whether you know it or not, red light and speed cameras are everywhere ready to snap a photo of your license plate.
[2:05:02.700 --> 2:05:09.700]  One simple harmless error could end up costing you over $500 quickly putting an end to your holiday cheer.
[2:05:09.700 --> 2:05:11.700]  Fight back with Photo Blocker.
[2:05:11.700 --> 2:05:14.700]  Simply spray your plate once and you're done.
[2:05:14.700 --> 2:05:19.700]  Any photos of your license plate will appear overexposed, making them virtually unreadable.
[2:05:19.700 --> 2:05:23.700]  See the newscast showing just how Photo Blocker works against traffic cameras.
[2:05:23.700 --> 2:05:28.700]  Christmas is here and the economy isn't bad enough shaped without spending hundreds of dollars in fees
[2:05:28.700 --> 2:05:32.700]  that can be avoided with one simple application of Photo Blocker.
[2:05:32.700 --> 2:05:34.700]  Go to sprayyourplate.com.

[2:05:45.700 --> 2:05:47.700]  Don't give your money to the state.
[2:05:47.700 --> 2:05:51.700]  Spray your plate and when the cameras flash, you'll save some cash.
[2:05:51.700 --> 2:05:53.700]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:05:53.700 --> 2:05:57.700]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[2:05:57.700 --> 2:05:59.700]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[2:05:59.700 --> 2:06:02.700]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:06:02.700 --> 2:06:08.700]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:06:08.700 --> 2:06:12.700]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[2:07:52.700 --> 2:07:57.700]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show
[2:07:57.700 --> 2:08:03.700]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:08:03.700 --> 2:08:06.700]  I briefly just want to make it clear.
[2:08:06.700 --> 2:08:13.700]  Foreign banks in their own documents that we've posted and written about and had guests on covering,
[2:08:13.700 --> 2:08:17.700]  like the former chief economist of the World Bank,
[2:08:17.700 --> 2:08:20.700]  come in and destroy economies by design.
[2:08:20.700 --> 2:08:23.700]  As things begin falling apart, they come in and tell the government,
[2:08:23.700 --> 2:08:28.700]  give us unlimited power if they didn't already have it.
[2:08:28.700 --> 2:08:30.700]  And we will fix the financial situation.
[2:08:30.700 --> 2:08:35.700]  They then completely destroy the nation down to pennies on the dollar
[2:08:35.700 --> 2:08:38.700]  and they steal all the pension funds.
[2:08:38.700 --> 2:08:43.700]  And then the IMF and World Bank put in private intelligence groups
[2:08:43.700 --> 2:08:46.700]  and sometimes use CIA and others.
[2:08:46.700 --> 2:08:50.700]  This is mainstream news now to monitor the public.
[2:08:50.700 --> 2:08:54.700]  The public won't riot over having their pension funds taken.
[2:08:54.700 --> 2:08:58.700]  By then they've already privatized the water and the roads
[2:08:58.700 --> 2:09:02.700]  and they slap up toll roads overnight or they just shut roads.
[2:09:02.700 --> 2:09:06.700]  They triple or quadruple the price of water and natural gas
[2:09:06.700 --> 2:09:10.700]  and then they sit back and watch the riots start.
[2:09:10.700 --> 2:09:14.700]  And then once the riots start, the people feel real good burning and stealing
[2:09:14.700 --> 2:09:18.700]  and attacking for a few weeks or even months.
[2:09:18.700 --> 2:09:21.700]  Then everybody's demoralized, everything's destroyed,
[2:09:21.700 --> 2:09:25.700]  then they come in and even hammer the depression harder
[2:09:25.700 --> 2:09:29.700]  and then put in a new puppet government who always blames the last government
[2:09:29.700 --> 2:09:33.700]  and says it's your fault for rioting that you screwed everything up
[2:09:33.700 --> 2:09:35.700]  and they call that the IMF riot.
[2:09:35.700 --> 2:09:39.700]  Now, I've been talking about this since 2002, since I learned about it.
[2:09:39.700 --> 2:09:42.700]  I mean, I learned in history, even in college,
[2:09:42.700 --> 2:09:45.700]  how the Marines would be sent into third world countries
[2:09:45.700 --> 2:09:51.700]  and the U.S. would do the same thing there that they've done in modern times.
[2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:55.700]  And then Smedley Butler talked about how he was a bag man for the bankers.
[2:09:55.700 --> 2:09:58.700]  You know, two times Congressional Medal of Honor winner.
[2:09:58.700 --> 2:10:00.700]  He was about to be Marine Corps Commandant,
[2:10:00.700 --> 2:10:04.700]  the most highly decorated Marine in Marine Corps history.
[2:10:04.700 --> 2:10:07.700]  I'm sure the Marines will urinate all over him and call him evil
[2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:10.700]  and call him a terrorist trader because he isn't for destroying America now
[2:10:10.700 --> 2:10:13.700]  because they're a bunch, you know, certainly the leadership
[2:10:13.700 --> 2:10:16.700]  and those that I've talked to, a lot of Marines are good and hate it.
[2:10:16.700 --> 2:10:18.700]  A lot of them love it. I mean, they love this evil.
[2:10:18.700 --> 2:10:21.700]  They're on the website with their own handles on Info Wars,
[2:10:21.700 --> 2:10:23.700]  link back to their Myspace, you know, saying,
[2:10:23.700 --> 2:10:26.700]  I want to kick your teeth in, I can't wait to kill you.
[2:10:26.700 --> 2:10:28.700]  And you think it's a joke and you go to their Myspace
[2:10:28.700 --> 2:10:31.700]  and they're in their uniform. They want to kill Americans.
[2:10:31.700 --> 2:10:34.700]  I mean, they're just, it's just total evil is taking over them.
[2:10:34.700 --> 2:10:38.700]  I mean, they're total killers past the point of what they were 20, 30 years ago.
[2:10:38.700 --> 2:10:40.700]  Now, a lot of them are upset about what's happening.
[2:10:40.700 --> 2:10:42.700]  But to make a long story short here,
[2:10:42.700 --> 2:10:47.700]  Smedley Butler went along with all this
[2:10:47.700 --> 2:10:50.700]  and then they finally approached him and said,
[2:10:50.700 --> 2:10:54.700]  we're going to make you basically military dictator over the military
[2:10:54.700 --> 2:10:57.700]  under Prescott Bush in the Haramans.
[2:10:57.700 --> 2:10:59.700]  And we want you to overthrow the United States.
[2:10:59.700 --> 2:11:02.700]  We've got a secret program with police chiefs that want to work with you
[2:11:02.700 --> 2:11:10.700]  and the army. We want you to lead a group of 500,000 men with the army.
[2:11:10.700 --> 2:11:12.700]  Most of them are police and former military.
[2:11:12.700 --> 2:11:13.700]  We've got a network.
[2:11:13.700 --> 2:11:17.700]  We're going to overthrow the U.S. and set up a fascist dictatorship.
[2:11:17.700 --> 2:11:21.700]  And you're going to be like Heinrich Himmler.
[2:11:21.700 --> 2:11:23.700]  And he said, oh, yeah, I like that plan.
[2:11:23.700 --> 2:11:26.700]  And he went and went to their meetings and was given all the documents.
[2:11:26.700 --> 2:11:29.700]  And then he went and blew the whistle and they got arrested.
[2:11:29.700 --> 2:11:30.700]  Some of them did.
[2:11:30.700 --> 2:11:31.700]  Some of them were too powerful to arrest.
[2:11:31.700 --> 2:11:33.700]  So they just couldn't bring it out in the media.
[2:11:33.700 --> 2:11:37.700]  And they congressional hearings in the late 40s, early 50s, McCormick-Dickstein committee.
[2:11:37.700 --> 2:11:39.700]  I have some of that in my film in-game.
[2:11:39.700 --> 2:11:42.700]  The point is they always use the Marines.
[2:11:42.700 --> 2:11:43.700]  That's what the Marines do.
[2:11:43.700 --> 2:11:48.700]  They take over countries and they take over third world nations.
[2:11:48.700 --> 2:11:49.700]  They're a pocket army.
[2:11:49.700 --> 2:11:55.700]  They're a rapid reaction, shop trips, and that's their use.
[2:11:55.700 --> 2:11:58.700]  Now, I'm not attacking John Paul Jones and the revolutionary forefathers.
[2:11:58.700 --> 2:12:03.700]  I'm not attacking the Marine Corps and going down to Mexico and kicking the butt of, you know,
[2:12:03.700 --> 2:12:08.700]  their leadership down there from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.
[2:12:08.700 --> 2:12:13.700]  But there's no doubt since the 30s, it has been total new world order.
[2:12:13.700 --> 2:12:16.700]  And Smedley Butler wrote a book about it war as a racket.
[2:12:16.700 --> 2:12:20.700]  And so they're going to implode the economy by design, as I've been telling you for a decade,
[2:12:20.700 --> 2:12:23.700]  and then bring in troops as the quote saviors.
[2:12:23.700 --> 2:12:25.700]  This is all a setup.
[2:12:25.700 --> 2:12:32.700]  And the troops are destroying their own futures.
[2:12:32.700 --> 2:12:38.700]  By the way, we've gotten the press release from the chips in California, the Highway Patrol,
[2:12:38.700 --> 2:12:40.700]  that they are using Marines at checkpoints.
[2:12:40.700 --> 2:12:44.700]  And we have the later press release denying it.
[2:12:44.700 --> 2:12:47.700]  And then they lied and the Marines were on the streets.
[2:12:47.700 --> 2:12:59.700]  There's a thousand dollar reward for footage of Marines at checkpoints anywhere in the United States.
[2:12:59.700 --> 2:13:03.700]  And then if I get a bunch of video from different people, the next best will get 500
[2:13:03.700 --> 2:13:05.700]  and then the next five winners will get 500 apiece.
[2:13:05.700 --> 2:13:06.700]  I'd love to give you more.
[2:13:06.700 --> 2:13:09.700]  I just don't have the money.
[2:13:09.700 --> 2:13:14.700]  And even when we get the footage and even when we get local newscasts, the public will still say there's no Marines.
[2:13:14.700 --> 2:13:19.700]  As the Marines take their guns out of their homes, they will say there are no Marines.
[2:13:19.700 --> 2:13:25.700]  As their child dies of cancer from the GMO crops, they will say there is no GMO, there is no cancer.
[2:13:25.700 --> 2:13:30.700]  I mean, it's just a nation of jellyfish that have allowed this to happen.
[2:13:30.700 --> 2:13:32.700]  All right, I've said enough on that front.
[2:13:32.700 --> 2:13:35.700]  Let's shift gears into internet censorship.
[2:13:35.700 --> 2:13:37.700]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal today.
[2:13:37.700 --> 2:13:39.700]  Google wants its own fast track on the web.
[2:13:39.700 --> 2:13:46.700]  Then you read the article and admits that it's going to shut down the old web and it'll crawl if it even works.
[2:13:46.700 --> 2:13:48.700]  No more net neutrality.
[2:13:48.700 --> 2:13:54.700]  The old web is being allowed to fall apart and die, as Internet2 said six years ago, the big international consortium.
[2:13:54.700 --> 2:14:05.700]  And then Google and a handful of other big IT giants, they will be the web of the future with only a few thousand mainstream news websites and video sites.
[2:14:05.700 --> 2:14:08.700]  Then you say, well, I'll just go on YouTube and Google and upload my stuff there.
[2:14:08.700 --> 2:14:16.700]  No, Google has now announced Friday, the register reported on it out of England, that they are going to censor whatever they want, whenever they want.
[2:14:16.700 --> 2:14:20.700]  And they are now going to hand select who gets to be in the search rankings.
[2:14:20.700 --> 2:14:24.700]  And you're basically going to have to pay them to be in their search rankings.
[2:14:24.700 --> 2:14:29.700]  And I've suddenly noticed, because I'm always studying it, suddenly most of my stuff is gone.
[2:14:29.700 --> 2:14:39.700]  Most of my videos, most of the articles, articles I've written that we've published years ago, six months ago, before they'd be top of the web, top of Google,
[2:14:39.700 --> 2:14:44.700]  because whatever gets the most hits goes to the top under the fair system they had that made them number one.
[2:14:44.700 --> 2:14:45.700]  Not anymore.
[2:14:45.700 --> 2:14:47.700]  They've knocked us out everywhere.
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:51.700]  Now we're still growing despite that, but we're not reaching as many new people.
[2:14:51.700 --> 2:14:58.700]  That's why you've got to go to other websites, chat rooms, MySpace, YouTube, Google, and hundreds of others while you still can.
[2:14:58.700 --> 2:15:00.700]  It's now happening.
[2:15:00.700 --> 2:15:13.700]  The taxing of the web, the regulating cable companies not letting you visit most sites, Australia headline, passing Chinese style internet censorship, it's all happening.
[2:15:13.700 --> 2:15:15.700]  And it's all in the Wall Street Journal today.
[2:15:15.700 --> 2:15:20.700]  They go on and admit this will shut down the web and this is Obama's upgrade of the web.
[2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:25.700]  As I told you a week ago when he announced it, I said, that's internet too.
[2:15:25.700 --> 2:15:29.700]  And here it is, it is internet too. This is it.
[2:15:29.700 --> 2:15:31.700]  This is it boys.
[2:15:31.700 --> 2:15:33.700]  So we better use it while we've got it.
[2:15:33.700 --> 2:15:39.700]  We need to fight for the web, fight for its freedom, fight for its openness now like we're going to lose it.
[2:15:39.700 --> 2:15:44.700]  But we need to fight like we're going to lose it because we are going to lose it.
[2:15:44.700 --> 2:15:49.700]  If we raise enough hue and cry, if we expose what they're doing, we may be able to back them off.
[2:15:49.700 --> 2:15:57.700]  But living in denial about the fact that they're trying this is what's going to let them succeed.
[2:15:57.700 --> 2:16:06.700]  And we need to reach out to people with the basic information about the New World Order and how it really operates as if they are going to be successful.
[2:16:06.700 --> 2:16:08.700]  So hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[2:16:08.700 --> 2:16:12.700]  Reach as many people as you can like the web is not going to be there in six months a year, maybe even sooner.
[2:16:12.700 --> 2:16:14.700]  The web as you know it.
[2:16:14.700 --> 2:16:18.700]  It'll just be a few thousand mainline sites, all heavily censored.
[2:16:18.700 --> 2:16:20.700]  It was a perfect storm coming together to do this.
[2:16:20.700 --> 2:16:23.700]  The newspapers are dying, the TV is imploding.
[2:16:23.700 --> 2:16:25.700]  People don't trust them anymore.
[2:16:25.700 --> 2:16:30.700]  The alternative blogs are blowing them out of the water.
[2:16:30.700 --> 2:16:32.700]  So they're panicking.
[2:16:32.700 --> 2:16:35.700]  Somebody like Nuff Respect, that's his handle.
[2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:39.700]  He can make a video that five million people watch in a year.
[2:16:39.700 --> 2:16:42.700]  A five minute video that took him a few hours to make.
[2:16:42.700 --> 2:16:44.700]  John Watkins from Cardiff.
[2:16:44.700 --> 2:16:49.700]  John, thanks for holding on. I went into that basic rant. It's just so much is going on.
[2:16:49.700 --> 2:16:51.700]  So much is unfolding right now.
[2:16:51.700 --> 2:16:53.700]  What's your battle plan?
[2:16:53.700 --> 2:16:57.700]  I mean, what's your ideas of ways to counter this?
[2:16:57.700 --> 2:16:59.700]  Hi, hi, Alex. Thanks for having me on.
[2:16:59.700 --> 2:17:04.700]  Yeah, well, with this censorship, I mean, it's just 70 on the joke now.
[2:17:04.700 --> 2:17:11.700]  I mean, I've spoken to so many people just in this last week who told me so many different stories about how they've been censored.
[2:17:11.700 --> 2:17:17.700]  You know, all the different ways that, you know, Google is now trying to restrict people, you know, free speech.
[2:17:17.700 --> 2:17:26.700]  But, you know, one of the things I think, you know, I encourage every YouTube user to take part in this boycott that we're organizing for this Friday,
[2:17:26.700 --> 2:17:29.700]  you know, so that we can send a clear message to YouTube.
[2:17:29.700 --> 2:17:35.700]  Because, you know, we have to accept that they are a company and, you know, they're obviously motivated by money.
[2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:48.700]  So, you know, there's only so much that we can do, but we can at least get a message out to them, you know, just to let them know that we're not happy about all these different changes that they're implementing on YouTube now.
[2:17:48.700 --> 2:17:59.700]  And, you know, I'm not saying that this blackout on this coming Friday is necessarily going to, you know, make Google change their minds about all these different new policies that they brought in.
[2:17:59.700 --> 2:18:09.700]  But I think that at the very least it will get Google to seriously reconsider, you know, what they're doing at the moment and reconsider any...
[2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:15.700]  Well, it's the beginning of an idea and introduces to people that we better have an alternative to Google on YouTube.
[2:18:15.700 --> 2:18:21.700]  We educate people that they're censoring and restricting and cheating the hit counts to keep us off the front page.
[2:18:21.700 --> 2:18:30.700]  And I'm going to ask the Alex Jones channel guy to have our channel go black for that day, shut our videos down for that day.
[2:18:30.700 --> 2:18:35.700]  You know, if you shut your videos down for that day, that is really...
[2:18:35.700 --> 2:18:41.700]  And if everybody else does that and doesn't visit YouTube Friday, that will send them a strong message.
[2:18:41.700 --> 2:18:51.700]  Well, that's right. You know, if enough of us do this, then obviously they won't be able to ignore it. You know, they obviously already know because there's so many people who've uploaded videos this week.
[2:18:51.700 --> 2:18:56.700]  But it's not so much about even letting them know. It's about everybody else wondering what we're talking about.
[2:18:56.700 --> 2:18:58.700]  I mean, it's a huge event. It's very important.
[2:18:58.700 --> 2:19:01.700]  Well, that's right. I mean, we've got to take action now.
[2:19:01.700 --> 2:19:11.700]  And as I say, the simplest form of action is simply just to boycott Google's products completely and, you know, obviously refrain from using YouTube for at least one day.
[2:19:11.700 --> 2:19:16.700]  And I think most people can manage that. You know, I personally won't be using YouTube for probably a week.
[2:19:16.700 --> 2:19:20.700]  You know, from the 19th of December, I probably won't use it again right up until the end of December.
[2:19:20.700 --> 2:19:29.700]  You know, and I've already stopped using Google products completely now because, you know, I'm just so annoyed by the fact that they're refusing to listen to us.
[2:19:29.700 --> 2:19:34.700]  We need to start moving now. Well, they're about to be given a government monopoly over Internet too.
[2:19:34.700 --> 2:19:40.700]  So that's, you know, don't be evil. They were set up by the CIA. We have the documents. It's always been a front.
[2:19:40.700 --> 2:19:45.700]  It's meant to make you think it's the alternative, but it's allowed to break all the rules on the web, do whatever it wants.
[2:19:45.700 --> 2:19:51.700]  They are the beast. They've moved in with NASA. We'll be right back. Stay there. We're talking enough respect.
[2:19:51.700 --> 2:19:57.700]  The holiday season is here again. A time to appreciate our friends and family and the many blessings we have.
[2:19:57.700 --> 2:20:00.700]  It's also time to find unique gift ideas for those we love.
[2:20:00.700 --> 2:20:03.700]  This year, why not give a gift that saves your loved ones money?
[2:20:03.700 --> 2:20:08.700]  A two ounce bottle of fuel conditioner from FuelSaver Technologies makes a great stocking stuffer.
[2:20:08.700 --> 2:20:10.700]  It's also an inexpensive and thoughtful present.
[2:20:10.700 --> 2:20:17.700]  A small squeeze of our product in the gas tank improves combustion, boosting fuel economy 10 to 20% or more.
[2:20:17.700 --> 2:20:25.700]  Completely safe for all engines. Our fuel additive also reduces emissions, maintenance costs, and reduces the friction of engine moving parts.
[2:20:25.700 --> 2:20:29.700]  Each little bottle treats 100 gallons of gasoline or 50 gallons of diesel.
[2:20:29.700 --> 2:20:37.700]  With a case of 16 or 32 bottles, you'll have plenty to give as gifts and the cost is only $6 per bottle with free shipping.
[2:20:37.700 --> 2:20:45.700]  Call us toll free 866-768-7811 or go online at FuelSaverINC.com.
[2:20:45.700 --> 2:20:51.700]  That's 866-768-7811, a unique gift that saves everyone money.
[2:20:51.700 --> 2:20:57.700]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, December 15, 2008. Gold opened this morning at $828.80.
[2:20:57.700 --> 2:21:04.700]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $853.54, $426.77 for the half ounce, and $213.38 for quarter ounce.
[2:21:04.700 --> 2:21:09.700]  That's $853.54, $426.77, and $213.38.
[2:21:09.700 --> 2:21:12.700]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S.
[2:21:12.700 --> 2:21:15.700]  hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S. Treasuries,
[2:21:15.700 --> 2:21:19.700]  responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[2:21:19.700 --> 2:21:23.700]  The Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves
[2:21:23.700 --> 2:21:28.700]  as a political weapon causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S. housing market
[2:21:28.700 --> 2:21:30.700]  and throwing the economy into a recession.
[2:21:30.700 --> 2:21:34.700]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[2:21:34.700 --> 2:21:37.700]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report,
[2:21:37.700 --> 2:21:40.700]  China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[2:21:40.700 --> 2:21:43.700]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[2:21:43.700 --> 2:21:46.700]  The value of your hard earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[2:21:46.700 --> 2:21:51.700]  Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[2:21:51.700 --> 2:21:55.700]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[2:21:55.700 --> 2:21:58.700]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:21:58.700 --> 2:22:01.700]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:22:01.700 --> 2:22:02.700]  But who is the enemy?
[2:22:02.700 --> 2:22:03.700]  Bin Laden.
[2:22:03.700 --> 2:22:04.700]  This is his MO.
[2:22:04.700 --> 2:22:07.700]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:22:07.700 --> 2:22:15.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:22:15.700 --> 2:22:21.700]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[2:22:21.700 --> 2:22:25.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:22:25.700 --> 2:22:29.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[2:22:29.700 --> 2:22:32.700]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:22:32.700 --> 2:22:35.700]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:22:35.700 --> 2:22:39.700]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:22:39.700 --> 2:22:44.700]  Forsee it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:22:44.700 --> 2:22:48.700]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:22:52.700 --> 2:22:56.700]  Santa. Christmas Eve and you haven't left yet?
[2:22:56.700 --> 2:23:01.700]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. No. I can't find my keys.
[2:23:01.700 --> 2:23:07.700]  Here's the perfect gift. Our patented Find One, Find All keyfinder, or FOFA XD for short.
[2:23:07.700 --> 2:23:10.700]  Once a FOFA keyfinder is attached to each of those easy to lose things,
[2:23:10.700 --> 2:23:14.700]  it can find and be found by all the rest. Use your wallet to find your keys,
[2:23:14.700 --> 2:23:18.700]  your keys to find the remote control, or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[2:23:18.700 --> 2:23:22.700]  FOFA goes through walls, cushions and laundry baskets up to 30 feet,
[2:23:22.700 --> 2:23:28.700]  and projects a loud 90 plus decibel beep. And new for Christmas, there's even a FOFA just for eyeglasses.
[2:23:28.700 --> 2:23:32.700]  Where did I put my glasses, Mrs. Claus? Oh, here they are.
[2:23:32.700 --> 2:23:36.700]  Luckily, Rudolph's nose isn't the only thing that flashes.
[2:23:36.700 --> 2:23:40.700]  Order your FOFA today with batteries included along with a 30-day money-back guarantee.
[2:23:40.700 --> 2:23:45.700]  Call 866-245-8670. That's 866-245-8670.
[2:23:45.700 --> 2:23:50.700]  Or buy online at FindOneFindAll.com. Again, that's FindOneFindAll.com.
[2:23:57.700 --> 2:24:03.700]  Denial is letting all of this happen. Denial about the troops, denial about the banks,
[2:24:03.700 --> 2:24:08.700]  denial about the corrupt government. It's on TV and radio and print telling us how good they are,
[2:24:08.700 --> 2:24:14.700]  how much they love us, and their pack of criminals and dirtbag parasites.
[2:24:14.700 --> 2:24:20.700]  You need to get angry, folks, because once tyranny happens, it just takes everything.
[2:24:20.700 --> 2:24:23.700]  It just destroys everything. And now we're getting deep into it.
[2:24:23.700 --> 2:24:27.700]  Now we're getting down the line, the FEMA camps, the troops, all of it.
[2:24:27.700 --> 2:24:32.700]  And to do that, they've got to shut down the web, but they've got to have the cattle still think everything's okay.
[2:24:32.700 --> 2:24:37.700]  So they're going to advertise, oh, the evil, bad, dirty web that wasn't safe for your kids.
[2:24:37.700 --> 2:24:42.700]  It's now been shut down. And if you try to get on it, maybe you can if you're a techie expert.
[2:24:42.700 --> 2:24:47.700]  But for everybody else, there's the new Google, the Google that runs the whole backbone.
[2:24:47.700 --> 2:24:53.700]  And so it's important to start using some of the other search engines that are out there.
[2:24:53.700 --> 2:24:59.700]  It's important to start using... I've kicked Google ads off of Info Wars and Prison Planet,
[2:24:59.700 --> 2:25:03.700]  and then one of my people, I saw Google back up there, and they go, oh, it must have been an old template.
[2:25:03.700 --> 2:25:08.700]  Anybody in my office, this is the message right now, if I see Google ads back up, you're fired.
[2:25:08.700 --> 2:25:13.700]  Okay, just get that part straight right there. I'm having nothing to do with them.
[2:25:13.700 --> 2:25:17.700]  Okay, I have to do that now. People don't listen to me.
[2:25:17.700 --> 2:25:23.700]  Okay, going back to John Watkins. John, this is a short segment.
[2:25:23.700 --> 2:25:27.700]  Again, you run the channel, and I respect on YouTube with tens of millions of views.
[2:25:27.700 --> 2:25:31.700]  They've been censoring you in a cocktail of different ways.
[2:25:31.700 --> 2:25:35.700]  Where do you see all this going in this fight?
[2:25:35.700 --> 2:25:39.700]  Well, it's pretty worrying, really, because if this carries on the way it's going,
[2:25:39.700 --> 2:25:46.700]  within only a couple of years, I can imagine that Google will own just about every service available on the net,
[2:25:46.700 --> 2:25:48.700]  because that seems to be the way it's going.
[2:25:48.700 --> 2:25:54.700]  Google seems to be trying to monopolize just about every internet service available,
[2:25:54.700 --> 2:25:58.700]  including videos, emails, search engines, web browsers.
[2:25:58.700 --> 2:26:00.700]  And they're being allowed to.
[2:26:00.700 --> 2:26:03.700]  That's right. No one seems to be really that bothered about it.
[2:26:03.700 --> 2:26:10.700]  That's the key. I mean, they'll shut down some small business and say that it's a trust when it's not,
[2:26:10.700 --> 2:26:13.700]  but then Google truly is setting one up.
[2:26:13.700 --> 2:26:16.700]  Well, this is it.
[2:26:16.700 --> 2:26:23.700]  Well, what tends to happen is the pattern I see is that whenever Google has a competitor that is extremely popular like YouTube was,
[2:26:23.700 --> 2:26:28.700]  Google will simply just buy it out, just like they're doing with Yahoo now.
[2:26:28.700 --> 2:26:32.700]  I heard the other day that they're trying to buy out Yahoo.
[2:26:32.700 --> 2:26:39.700]  So it seems like they're basically restricting our freedom of choice, as well as censoring our freedom.
[2:26:39.700 --> 2:26:43.700]  And the key is they're working with the government to restrict and shut people down.
[2:26:43.700 --> 2:26:48.700]  And again, I'll just tell everybody right now, this is a big deal, because that's how we reach a lot of new people.
[2:26:48.700 --> 2:26:51.700]  You don't find my stuff in the search engines like you did before.
[2:26:51.700 --> 2:26:53.700]  They're going in and removing it.
[2:26:53.700 --> 2:27:02.700]  I can put in whole headlines, whole headlines of articles we've written, John, that got, you know, I mean, back when the British bomb themselves,
[2:27:02.700 --> 2:27:09.700]  the British government on 777, if you typed in London bombing, it was number one on the search engine.
[2:27:09.700 --> 2:27:13.700]  But now we put in our headlines, it's not there.
[2:27:13.700 --> 2:27:16.700]  It's not that it's moved down the rankings, it's gone.
[2:27:16.700 --> 2:27:24.700]  Well, this is it, and I can actually remember that, because when the London bombings occurred, you know, just like many other people,
[2:27:24.700 --> 2:27:30.700]  I went on the Internet and I was searching for information about it, and when you typed London bombings into Google,
[2:27:30.700 --> 2:27:36.700]  it was the whole search result on that first page with all prison, planets, and info wars links.
[2:27:36.700 --> 2:27:40.700]  Then after a while, what they did was get rid of the descriptions underneath those links.
[2:27:40.700 --> 2:27:43.700]  All you had was just the link itself and no description underneath it.
[2:27:43.700 --> 2:27:47.700]  And now I see that a lot of those links are disappearing completely now.
[2:27:47.700 --> 2:27:59.700]  So, you know, obviously there is an agenda in place to restrict this information, you know, and, you know, they're restricting our ability to get information out there to people.
[2:27:59.700 --> 2:28:02.700]  And, you know, it's quite worrying, really.
[2:28:02.700 --> 2:28:09.700]  Well, I put in the exact headline from the Bay Fest in Alabama where they had troops searching three-year-old children training them how to be slaves.
[2:28:09.700 --> 2:28:13.700]  And I put in the exact headline that wouldn't come up, but then I went to my site and found it.
[2:28:13.700 --> 2:28:18.700]  I mean, they are literally censoring exact headlines now.
[2:28:18.700 --> 2:28:22.700]  For those that don't know how search engines work, that means they have been de-indexing.
[2:28:22.700 --> 2:28:25.700]  They have been removing us on purpose.
[2:28:25.700 --> 2:28:27.700]  Well, that's right, yeah. I mean, that's right.
[2:28:27.700 --> 2:28:29.700]  You know, so we've got to make a stand.
[2:28:29.700 --> 2:28:32.700]  We've got to let Google know that we're not happy with the way that they're operating.
[2:28:32.700 --> 2:28:36.700]  You know, if we do nothing, it's only going to get worse.
[2:28:36.700 --> 2:28:41.700]  So we've got a protest in some way about it, and boycotting is one thing that we can do.
[2:28:41.700 --> 2:28:46.700]  And I'm sure it will have some effect, although Google will obviously make out that it's not bothering them at all.
[2:28:46.700 --> 2:28:54.700]  But, you know, I mean, there's just so many different ways that they stop in certain videos, for instance, going viral on YouTube now.
[2:28:54.700 --> 2:28:56.700]  You know, just a host of different ways.
[2:28:56.700 --> 2:29:03.700]  Fiddling the view counters, removing honors from videos, removing honors from people's channels like they did with my channel last week.
[2:29:03.700 --> 2:29:09.700]  And a few other people, they've done this, too, and removing pages full of comments.
[2:29:09.700 --> 2:29:16.700]  And this is another way they keep videos out of the most discussed list, is to remove lots of comments so that it keeps it low on those lists.
[2:29:16.700 --> 2:29:18.700]  And, you know...
[2:29:18.700 --> 2:29:24.700]  That's right. When it's a video with a girl and a bikini, they keep all the comments, but then they remove them from ours.
[2:29:24.700 --> 2:29:27.700]  You'll just go in and they'll be, say, 2,000 comments.
[2:29:27.700 --> 2:29:31.700]  They'll just remove them and start it over to knock you off the main pages.
[2:29:31.700 --> 2:29:35.700]  And again, the worst part of this is they pose like they're open and free.
[2:29:35.700 --> 2:29:39.700]  It's just, it's just absolutely disgusting.
[2:29:39.700 --> 2:30:02.700]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:09.700 --> 2:30:14.700]  Put an end to wage garnishment, bank levies and liens, and you won't pay one dime to creditors.

[2:30:52.700 --> 2:31:00.700]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[2:31:00.700 --> 2:31:02.700]  At least we thought we did.
[2:31:02.700 --> 2:31:08.700]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:31:08.700 --> 2:31:17.700]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:31:17.700 --> 2:31:24.700]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:31:24.700 --> 2:31:33.700]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:31:33.700 --> 2:31:42.700]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[2:31:42.700 --> 2:31:51.700]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:31:51.700 --> 2:31:57.700]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[2:31:57.700 --> 2:32:03.700]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[2:32:03.700 --> 2:32:08.700]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[2:32:08.700 --> 2:32:14.700]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[2:32:14.700 --> 2:32:20.700]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[2:32:20.700 --> 2:32:24.700]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[2:32:24.700 --> 2:32:29.700]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[2:32:29.700 --> 2:32:32.700]  Do your part. Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[2:32:32.700 --> 2:32:41.700]  Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[2:32:41.700 --> 2:32:51.700]  Order your bottle of Alcovision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com. Again, that's alcovision.com.
[2:33:11.700 --> 2:33:17.700]  For all the cowardly pig people out there, they're still going to have their NFL websites.
[2:33:17.700 --> 2:33:21.700]  They're still going to have their Dancing With The Stars websites.
[2:33:21.700 --> 2:33:24.700]  They're still going to have the Wall Street Journal in the New York Times.
[2:33:24.700 --> 2:33:27.700]  They're still going to have CNN and Fox News.
[2:33:27.700 --> 2:33:30.700]  They can't play on a level playing field.
[2:33:30.700 --> 2:33:32.700]  We're kicking their butts.
[2:33:32.700 --> 2:33:37.700]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, bigger than most major newspaper websites.
[2:33:37.700 --> 2:33:41.700]  They're scared of that and thousands of other prolific sites out there.
[2:33:41.700 --> 2:33:43.700]  So they're shutting them down.
[2:33:43.700 --> 2:33:47.700]  And so, ladies and gentlemen, that's why we stay on shortwave and stay on AM and FM dial.
[2:33:47.700 --> 2:33:52.700]  Because that's all precious, but they're moving in with the digital to shut down the mom and pop stations.
[2:33:52.700 --> 2:33:56.700]  They are hitting us from every side as we go into this darkness.
[2:33:56.700 --> 2:34:01.700]  That's why it's important to have hard copies of all my books and videos and materials.
[2:34:01.700 --> 2:34:08.700]  Low-tech Infowars, because as things get worse and worse, that information will be more and more precious.
[2:34:08.700 --> 2:34:13.700]  That's why if you don't have the full library of DVDs and films at infowars.com, you need to get them.
[2:34:13.700 --> 2:34:19.700]  Or call toll-free to get them, 888-253-3139.
[2:34:19.700 --> 2:34:25.700]  And long-term, they admit, they plan within about five years, your computer will have nothing on it.
[2:34:25.700 --> 2:34:27.700]  You won't be able to buy one that doesn't.
[2:34:27.700 --> 2:34:35.700]  It will all be about the servers and it'll be their servers and everything you have will be on their servers, their system.
[2:34:35.700 --> 2:34:44.700]  And so you'll just have a terminal or a handheld device that dials into them and then see they are re-engineering the architecture so there's no freedom.
[2:34:44.700 --> 2:34:47.700]  When video sharing sites got big, they just bought them up.
[2:34:47.700 --> 2:34:53.700]  So don't leave Google and YouTube, keep fighting there in my space.
[2:34:53.700 --> 2:35:00.700]  But clone everything you do to lesser subsites and try to promote those and make them big.
[2:35:00.700 --> 2:35:02.700]  Use alternative search engines.
[2:35:02.700 --> 2:35:09.700]  We're going to do a big story about this and fight for this issue because they're going to incrementally hack the web down to nothing.
[2:35:09.700 --> 2:35:13.700]  Going back to John Watkins, NuffRespect YouTube channel.
[2:35:13.700 --> 2:35:20.700]  NuffRespect, you're going to be able Friday right to basically turn your side off for a day or what are you planning to do?
[2:35:20.700 --> 2:35:32.700]  Well, what I'm planning to do, as you mentioned earlier about uploading a video that just contains just a black screen basically, just nothing.
[2:35:32.700 --> 2:35:36.700]  Just as a little protest to say, you know, I'm not happy with this.
[2:35:36.700 --> 2:35:47.700]  And also what I'm going to do, I'll upload that before Friday and then what I'm going to do is from Friday for a good couple of days I'm just going to switch all videos to private.
[2:35:47.700 --> 2:35:50.700]  So the only friends can view those videos.
[2:35:50.700 --> 2:35:55.700]  And you know, some of my videos do get quite a lot of views.
[2:35:55.700 --> 2:36:00.700]  So I'm sure that YouTube should notice that.
[2:36:00.700 --> 2:36:01.700]  I'm sure they would notice that.
[2:36:01.700 --> 2:36:06.700]  Well, they're going to notice is the big buzz of all these sites being turned off, including the Alex Jones channel.
[2:36:06.700 --> 2:36:10.700]  I'm going to get the guy that runs that to shut it down.
[2:36:10.700 --> 2:36:15.700]  And again, because we need to show people what it's going to be like if they win.
[2:36:15.700 --> 2:36:21.700]  Well, that's right. We've got a protest about this now because if we do nothing, it'll just continue.
[2:36:21.700 --> 2:36:26.700]  And, you know, it's frightening really when you consider, you know, what they're doing right now.
[2:36:26.700 --> 2:36:31.700]  It really makes you worry about where it's all going to end up really, you know.
[2:36:31.700 --> 2:36:35.700]  I mean, Google is just taking over just about every service available on the Internet.
[2:36:35.700 --> 2:36:41.700]  And if that carries on there, it's just going to be one big monopoly that Google owns.
[2:36:41.700 --> 2:36:47.700]  And, you know, that's just the tip of the iceberg, really, because when you look into Internet too,
[2:36:47.700 --> 2:36:53.700]  the way they're chopping up the web, it's just, I mean, obviously, you know, we know the reason why they're doing it.
[2:36:53.700 --> 2:37:00.700]  Because in order for them to, you know, for the elite to, in order for them to continue with their globalist agenda,
[2:37:00.700 --> 2:37:04.700]  they need to restrict the web. And that's exactly what they're doing right now.
[2:37:04.700 --> 2:37:11.700]  And this new policy on YouTube now where they're algorithmically demoting videos,
[2:37:11.700 --> 2:37:17.700]  that just, it just doesn't sound right to me. It just doesn't sound fair or democratic in any way at all.
[2:37:17.700 --> 2:37:24.700]  Yeah, they claim, well, we have a magic machine that shows that it's no longer your videos will be on top of the number of hits,
[2:37:24.700 --> 2:37:30.700]  which is obviously the most democratic system. It's just like Dig got big being open and free voting up stories,
[2:37:30.700 --> 2:37:35.700]  and then they rigged it and admitted that they'd rigged it. As soon as something gets big, they have to rig it
[2:37:35.700 --> 2:37:40.700]  because the patriots, the liberty lovers, the anti-war people, those that love freedom take it over.
[2:37:40.700 --> 2:37:48.700]  But I want to explain to everybody, the Wall Street Journal is reporting today, Google wants its own fast track on the web,
[2:37:48.700 --> 2:37:57.700]  and it says, the celebrated openness of the Internet, network providers are not supposed to give preferential treatment to any traffic.
[2:37:57.700 --> 2:38:05.700]  It's quietly losing powerful defenders. We'll see the media made the people that defended net neutrality were really operatives.
[2:38:05.700 --> 2:38:10.700]  And now at the key point, they're flipping, and it's in the article going, yeah, let's shut down the old web.
[2:38:10.700 --> 2:38:16.700]  Yeah, I mean, actually says it in this article, yeah, you'll only be able to go to the places we want you to.
[2:38:16.700 --> 2:38:24.700]  That's a good thing. I mean, this is it. So it's not just Google that's censoring themselves and censoring their search engines
[2:38:24.700 --> 2:38:28.700]  while lying to the public and holding out that they're free and open and the best.
[2:38:28.700 --> 2:38:34.700]  It's that they want to be the backbone for the censorship of the web,
[2:38:34.700 --> 2:38:39.700]  and they want to be the nexus point deciding on whose website gets through and who doesn't.
[2:38:39.700 --> 2:38:42.700]  And that's why they moved in with NASA two years ago.
[2:38:42.700 --> 2:38:52.700]  We have the CIA agent, Mr. Steeleon, mentioning the head doctor in this technology who really runs Google for the CIA.
[2:38:52.700 --> 2:38:58.700]  They have these young yuppies as their fronts. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[2:38:58.700 --> 2:39:07.700]  Well, you know, it's just disgusting, really. I mean, it really is. Everything you've just said, it worries me.
[2:39:07.700 --> 2:39:14.700]  It worries me big time because this is our free speech and anyone who really values this free speech should make a protest about this
[2:39:14.700 --> 2:39:21.700]  and do something now. Let Google know that we're not happy because this is our own free speech we're talking about.
[2:39:21.700 --> 2:39:27.700]  And I can't see it getting any better under Obama because, you know, a lot of the things I've heard about what he's doing,
[2:39:27.700 --> 2:39:32.700]  you know, I can't see the internet getting any better with him in power.
[2:39:32.700 --> 2:39:38.700]  But that's how they spin it. We're upgrading it. We're making it better. By the way, none of you will have websites.
[2:39:38.700 --> 2:39:45.700]  Well, this is it. I mean, with Obama, for instance, I mean, the way he came to power,
[2:39:45.700 --> 2:39:52.700]  I know he's not in the White House yet, but it was another month to go, but everything about the way he came to power
[2:39:52.700 --> 2:40:00.700]  reminds me exactly of how Blair came to power in the UK back in 97 because, you know, at that time we had a deeply unpopular conservative government.
[2:40:00.700 --> 2:40:01.700]  John Major.
[2:40:01.700 --> 2:40:09.700]  Yeah, it was associated with sleaze and corruption, pretty much like the Republican administration.
[2:40:09.700 --> 2:40:16.700]  And, you know, they've just been in power for too long. People want to change. And, you know, they wanted a government that was for the people
[2:40:16.700 --> 2:40:24.700]  free of any sleaze or incompetence and corruption. And, you know, Tony Blair, he seemed to tick all the right boxes for so many people.
[2:40:24.700 --> 2:40:28.700]  And, you know, I was one of those many people who were fooled into believing that Blair was the good guy.
[2:40:28.700 --> 2:40:32.700]  I thought that he was the one to make, you know, this country great again.
[2:40:32.700 --> 2:40:39.700]  I thought he was the one to make things fairer for everybody. But, you know, I mean, I was fooled into it.
[2:40:39.700 --> 2:40:46.700]  And I fell for a hook-line and thinker. So, you know, it shows how easily people can be fooled, you know.
[2:40:46.700 --> 2:40:52.700]  Oh, they're running around saying censor us because we say Obama's bad and they say we need youth brigades.
[2:40:52.700 --> 2:40:59.700]  We need troops on the streets. Obama will fix it. And then Obama just signed an order saying they will use troops and even non-law enforcement.
[2:40:59.700 --> 2:41:03.700]  They're going to be involved in every facet of our lives. I mean, we're hurtling into tyranny.
[2:41:03.700 --> 2:41:08.700]  And it was the same thing with Tony Blair. You know, they bring in Tony Blair as the liberal savior.
[2:41:08.700 --> 2:41:15.700]  And just like you said, look at what he turned England into. As soon as he got elected, he declared war on the Magna Carta.
[2:41:15.700 --> 2:41:21.700]  That's right. They say one thing to get into power. And then as soon as they're in power, they do the exact opposite.
[2:41:21.700 --> 2:41:28.700]  And I've seen this pattern over and over again. And I'm surprised that people haven't woken up to it by now, you know, on mass.
[2:41:28.700 --> 2:41:35.700]  Because, you know, it's just become so obvious now that, you know, I mean, by the time Blair had been in about two years,
[2:41:35.700 --> 2:41:40.700]  it was already becoming pretty clear that this guy was a phony in every sense of the word.
[2:41:40.700 --> 2:41:45.700]  And, you know, it just shows how easy it is for people to be fooled by these puppets.
[2:41:45.700 --> 2:41:54.700]  And that's all they are. They're just puppets. And, you know, from what I've seen, it's actually a very rare thing to have a president or prime minister
[2:41:54.700 --> 2:42:04.700]  who isn't in the pockets of the elite. And even Margaret Thatcher, she even admitted that there's a shadow government in place.
[2:42:04.700 --> 2:42:10.700]  And she even praised it, saying that the official government is just too slow at getting things done.
[2:42:10.700 --> 2:42:13.700]  And, you know, they've got to go through all the bureaucracy and red tape.
[2:42:13.700 --> 2:42:17.700]  And the only way they can fast-track things through is through the shadow government.
[2:42:17.700 --> 2:42:24.700]  So, you know, they're even telling us they're not even hiding it. So, you know, from what I know about Obama,
[2:42:24.700 --> 2:42:31.700]  there's nothing to indicate to me that he's any different from the likes of Clinton or Bush or Blair or any of the other puppets.
[2:42:31.700 --> 2:42:35.700]  Well, I mean, out of the gates, he is taking everything Bush did and putting it on steroids.
[2:42:35.700 --> 2:42:41.700]  But, you know, and by the way, listeners, we haven't talked about the shoe incident because it's a diversion and a distraction.
[2:42:41.700 --> 2:42:47.700]  And while it's funny to watch that weasel dodge those shoes, it doesn't matter.
[2:42:47.700 --> 2:42:51.700]  We have trillions that are being stolen a week. We're imploding. We're going into martial law.
[2:42:51.700 --> 2:42:53.700]  They're shutting down the web in front of us.
[2:42:53.700 --> 2:43:02.700]  Let me read for the listeners out there and then get your response to this, John Watkins, because now, again, this is Internet 2.
[2:43:02.700 --> 2:43:06.700]  But when you read the Internet 2 documents, they come right out and say it.
[2:43:06.700 --> 2:43:09.700]  This is Wall Street Journal introducing this to the public.
[2:43:09.700 --> 2:43:12.700]  Google wants its own fast track on the web.
[2:43:12.700 --> 2:43:20.700]  This is one major cable operator and talks with Google, says it has been reluctant so far to strike a deal to have preferential treatment with Google.
[2:43:20.700 --> 2:43:25.700]  Of concern, it might violate Federal Communications Commission guidelines on network neutrality.
[2:43:25.700 --> 2:43:33.700]  But then it goes on to say the government, though, is saying go ahead because you see Google is the special little puppy.
[2:43:33.700 --> 2:43:40.700]  It's allowed to do what none of the other big companies are allowed to do because they are there. It's really a government front continuing.
[2:43:40.700 --> 2:43:50.700]  If we did this, Washington would be on fire, says one executive at the cable company who is familiar with the talks referring to a likely reaction of regulators and lawmakers.
[2:43:50.700 --> 2:43:52.700]  But see, Obama's behind doing it.
[2:43:52.700 --> 2:44:00.700]  Separately, Microsoft Core and Yahoo Inc. have withdrawn quietly from a coalition formed two years ago to protect a network neutrality.
[2:44:00.700 --> 2:44:04.700]  They only did that to co-op the people that were involved in the movement, I would add.
[2:44:04.700 --> 2:44:08.700]  Each company has forged relationships with phone and cable companies.
[2:44:08.700 --> 2:44:16.700]  In addition, prominent Internet scholars, some of whom have advised President-elect Barack Obama on technology issues, have softened their views on the subject.
[2:44:16.700 --> 2:44:22.700]  The consensus issue has wide ramifications for the Internet as a platform for new businesses.
[2:44:22.700 --> 2:44:28.700]  If companies like Google succeed in negotiating preferential treatment,
[2:44:28.700 --> 2:44:34.700]  the Internet could become a place where wealthy companies get faster and easier access to the web than less affluent ones.
[2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:39.700]  Folks, if Internet 2 says they're shutting all of us down, it doesn't say it like that.
[2:44:39.700 --> 2:44:41.700]  It says they're shutting us down.
[2:44:41.700 --> 2:44:45.700]  But see, introducing this to the public, it's, oh, well, they go to the head of the line.
[2:44:45.700 --> 2:44:49.700]  According to Advocate, go ahead and I'm going to finish the article.
[2:44:49.700 --> 2:44:53.700]  Well, they are seriously restricting our free speech.
[2:44:53.700 --> 2:44:58.700]  Google is obviously in the pockets of the establishment. There's no doubt about that,
[2:44:58.700 --> 2:45:05.700]  because we know that they're sharing information about our searches, about what we search for using Google.
[2:45:05.700 --> 2:45:11.700]  Google goes into China and runs the IT censorship forum, so does Yahoo.
[2:45:11.700 --> 2:45:15.700]  So to say that they don't know how to do this, they're already doing it, absolutely.
[2:45:15.700 --> 2:45:18.700]  They're turning up the ambient background. Let me finish this and I'm going to get your take on it.
[2:45:18.700 --> 2:45:24.700]  For computer users, it could mean that websites by companies not able to strike a fast lane deal,
[2:45:24.700 --> 2:45:28.700]  see, they're being deceptive. It's a whole new Internet that we ain't on.
[2:45:28.700 --> 2:45:34.700]  But see, for computer users, it could mean that websites by companies not able to strike fast lane deals
[2:45:34.700 --> 2:45:37.700]  will respond more slowly than those by companies able to pay.
[2:45:37.700 --> 2:45:40.700]  In the worst case scenario, the Internet could become a medium where large companies,
[2:45:40.700 --> 2:45:46.700]  such as Comcast Core and Cable Television, would control both distribution and content.
[2:45:46.700 --> 2:45:51.700]  Well, they've already announced they're doing that, and much of what users can access according to neutrality advocates.
[2:45:51.700 --> 2:45:53.700]  They've already tried it in Canada and Texas.
[2:45:53.700 --> 2:45:57.700]  And then it goes on to say, the shifting position concerns some purist.
[2:45:57.700 --> 2:45:59.700]  Oh, like we're purists because we want a web.
[2:45:59.700 --> 2:46:04.700]  What we're talking about is selling you the right to skip ahead of the line, says Ben Scott,
[2:46:04.700 --> 2:46:07.700]  Policy Director of Free Press, a Washington-based advocacy group.
[2:46:07.700 --> 2:46:13.700]  It would mean the first part of the business plan would be a deal with AT&T to get their super tier.
[2:46:13.700 --> 2:46:15.700]  This is anathema to a culture of innovation.
[2:46:15.700 --> 2:46:18.700]  Don't even the quote advocates get it.
[2:46:18.700 --> 2:46:22.700]  Don't they go read Internet2 and government reports from six years ago, in that respect?
[2:46:22.700 --> 2:46:26.700]  I mean, don't they understand that they said they're going to...
[2:46:26.700 --> 2:46:28.700]  What did I tell you six years ago, folks?
[2:46:28.700 --> 2:46:31.700]  What did the articles Paul wrote five years ago, four years ago say?
[2:46:31.700 --> 2:46:35.700]  They're going to shut down and not upgrade the old web, let it die,
[2:46:35.700 --> 2:46:40.700]  and then force you on Internet2 where you have no rights and have like 2,000 choices.
[2:46:40.700 --> 2:46:41.700]  Do you wonder?
[2:46:41.700 --> 2:46:42.700]  It's out of a billion.
[2:46:42.700 --> 2:46:45.700]  This is it. It's happening. Go ahead.
[2:46:45.700 --> 2:46:50.700]  Well, this is it, and they try and present these things as if they're doing us a favor,
[2:46:50.700 --> 2:46:52.700]  as if they're making the web better for us.
[2:46:52.700 --> 2:46:59.700]  It's exactly the same as what YouTube's doing now, saying that they want to make it a better place for their users,
[2:46:59.700 --> 2:47:02.700]  but they've made it a lot worse in so many different ways.
[2:47:02.700 --> 2:47:08.700]  They're offering free broadband and all these other kind of deals to get people interested in it,
[2:47:08.700 --> 2:47:11.700]  and this is how they're trying to sell these things to us.
[2:47:11.700 --> 2:47:14.700]  Exactly. They're taking our tax money and giving us quote-free bandwidth
[2:47:14.700 --> 2:47:21.700]  that already in England, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com are banned in most of the government wireless systems.
[2:47:21.700 --> 2:47:26.700]  Well, this is it, and also lots of libraries throughout the UK.
[2:47:26.700 --> 2:47:31.700]  Lots of different places in the UK where you can't access certain sites anymore.
[2:47:31.700 --> 2:47:35.700]  They are obviously actively censoring lots of different...
[2:47:35.700 --> 2:47:36.700]  Well, what does that tell listeners?
[2:47:36.700 --> 2:47:41.700]  You want to spread the word about enough respect to YouTube channel John Watkins because they're censoring it.
[2:47:41.700 --> 2:47:45.700]  You want to spread the word about infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:47:45.700 --> 2:47:50.700]  You want to fight back against their attempt to shut us off to the rest of the population.
[2:47:50.700 --> 2:47:55.700]  Verbally tell people about the site. Verbally tell them about links to the films.
[2:47:55.700 --> 2:47:59.700]  Don't tell your email list. Put out flyers on hundreds of cars.
[2:47:59.700 --> 2:48:04.700]  Spray paint it on the side of your house, or don't do it on a government building.
[2:48:04.700 --> 2:48:08.700]  You don't want to fight back like the founding fathers, so don't do anything illegal.
[2:48:08.700 --> 2:48:14.700]  Just get the word out and get aggressive and now explain to people, John Watkins,
[2:48:14.700 --> 2:48:19.700]  explain to people what we're doing coming up this Friday.
[2:48:19.700 --> 2:48:25.700]  Well, what we're going to do is basically boycott YouTube this Friday for at least one day.
[2:48:25.700 --> 2:48:28.700]  I'm going to boycott it for at least a week.
[2:48:28.700 --> 2:48:33.700]  Some people are just going to boycott it for the weekend, but I'm going to do it for the whole week.
[2:48:33.700 --> 2:48:38.700]  Just don't use YouTube at all for at least one day.
[2:48:38.700 --> 2:48:44.700]  Don't log in. Don't watch any YouTube videos, even if they're embedded on another site.
[2:48:44.700 --> 2:48:48.700]  Just don't use YouTube at all for at least that one day.
[2:48:48.700 --> 2:48:52.700]  There's so many other things we could be doing over this Christmas period anyway.
[2:48:52.700 --> 2:48:58.700]  I can't see it being much of a problem for people just to boycott YouTube just for one day.
[2:48:58.700 --> 2:49:03.700]  If we can get involved in that, I encourage everybody who's a YouTube user to get involved
[2:49:03.700 --> 2:49:07.700]  and to upload videos to inform other people about what we're doing
[2:49:07.700 --> 2:49:13.700]  and to raise awareness about this issue, to raise awareness about all these changes
[2:49:13.700 --> 2:49:17.700]  that Google have made to YouTube and what they're doing.
[2:49:17.700 --> 2:49:21.700]  All these changes that they're doing to YouTube seem to be geared around
[2:49:21.700 --> 2:49:29.700]  restricting our ability to network with other users and to share information with large groups of people.
[2:49:29.700 --> 2:49:33.700]  For example, they've now removed the bulletin system from our channels.
[2:49:33.700 --> 2:49:38.700]  Just a few months ago, you could fire out a bulletin to all your friends.
[2:49:38.700 --> 2:49:43.700]  If you had 5,000 friends, you could just send one message and it would go out to all of them in one go.
[2:49:43.700 --> 2:49:49.700]  Now you can't do that. They've also stopped people from sending videos to more than one friend at a time.
[2:49:49.700 --> 2:49:54.700]  It's ridiculous because before you could send a video to every single one of your friends,
[2:49:54.700 --> 2:49:58.700]  even if you had 5,000 friends, now you've got to do it one at a time,
[2:49:58.700 --> 2:50:02.700]  which becomes impossible even if you've got 100 friends.
[2:50:02.700 --> 2:50:05.700]  It's impossible to do it one at a time.
[2:50:05.700 --> 2:50:08.700]  Obviously, they don't want us networking.
[2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:14.700]  They don't want us forming large groups of people where we can share information with large groups of people.
[2:50:14.700 --> 2:50:19.700]  So this is not making YouTube any better and yet they're putting it out to us.
[2:50:19.700 --> 2:50:45.700]  They're selling it to us because it is making YouTube better when clearly it's not.
[2:50:50.700 --> 2:50:54.700]  Did you know that it's a documented fact?
[2:50:54.700 --> 2:51:01.700]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites at parasitic infection?
[2:51:01.700 --> 2:51:07.700]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites
[2:51:07.700 --> 2:51:09.700]  and your doctor would never know it.
[2:51:09.700 --> 2:51:14.700]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[2:51:14.700 --> 2:51:16.700]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[2:51:16.700 --> 2:51:22.700]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol, naturally and safely.

[2:51:51.700 --> 2:51:58.700]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:51:58.700 --> 2:52:02.700]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:52:02.700 --> 2:52:04.700]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:52:04.700 --> 2:52:07.700]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:52:07.700 --> 2:52:14.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:52:14.700 --> 2:52:21.700]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[2:52:21.700 --> 2:52:25.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:25.700 --> 2:52:32.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network,
[2:52:32.700 --> 2:52:37.700]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.
[2:52:37.700 --> 2:52:45.700]  Get the DVD at infowars.com. Forsee it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:45.700 --> 2:53:13.700]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:53:15.700 --> 2:53:33.700]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:53:33.700 --> 2:53:41.700]  You know, we can meet these people. It doesn't have to be frustrating to watch these crooks having their way with us, destroying our society, putting trips on the streets.
[2:53:41.700 --> 2:53:55.700]  All of it. I want all the listeners to just go to Kinko's and make 500 copies of cheap, let's say, infowars.com, powerful information,
[2:53:55.700 --> 2:54:04.700]  or Google Terror Storm, or put on there some other system, some other search engine name. I'm researching that all right now.
[2:54:04.700 --> 2:54:14.700]  And tell people, you know, to visit the sites now while we still can, because you understand, they want to shut down free speech so they can have our way with us.
[2:54:14.700 --> 2:54:22.700]  This isn't just a boss-hog corrupt government. This is a murdering, criminal, New World Order eugenicist group.
[2:54:22.700 --> 2:54:31.700]  Going back to the man over there with enough respect, YouTube channel. Going back to him, John Watkins, you know,
[2:54:31.700 --> 2:54:36.700]  my emotional sav is that I'm able to counter these people, expose these people, shown to be liars.
[2:54:36.700 --> 2:54:43.700]  And it just enrages me and horrifies me to know it's going to go back to when I first started out on one FM talk station,
[2:54:43.700 --> 2:54:50.700]  and, you know, for a year didn't even have a website where, you know, it was so rare to have somebody fighting them.
[2:54:50.700 --> 2:54:57.700]  And instead of so many of us standing up. But, you know, the good news is they're doing this because we're kicking their butt.
[2:54:57.700 --> 2:55:02.700]  Before they wanted to ignore us and laugh at us, they're trying to shut us off right now because we are hurting them.
[2:55:02.700 --> 2:55:11.700]  And I just love it that we're going to go on hurting them and go on exposing their lies, and that one day we're going to bring these Nazis to justice.
[2:55:11.700 --> 2:55:15.700]  Oh, that's right. And it shows that we're winning. We're winning the Info War, definitely.
[2:55:15.700 --> 2:55:23.700]  And that's why they're pulling all these measures now to try and restrict us in every way they possibly can, because they know that they're losing and we're winning.
[2:55:23.700 --> 2:55:32.700]  So, I mean, you talk about the older technologies, the, you know, AM radio and that kind of thing.
[2:55:32.700 --> 2:55:35.700]  We can't let go of these kind of technologies. We've still got to use them.
[2:55:35.700 --> 2:55:41.700]  And also, even when it comes to YouTube, we can't simply walk away and go somewhere else and never use YouTube again,
[2:55:41.700 --> 2:55:49.700]  because obviously it is the most popular video sharing site, and it achieved that popularity long before Google took it over.
[2:55:49.700 --> 2:55:53.700]  And, you know, it is still the most popular video.
[2:55:53.700 --> 2:55:59.700]  Because it was Democratic, because what was most popular went to the main page, but now they're ruining that.
[2:55:59.700 --> 2:56:09.700]  So we need to basically stay on YouTube, but only to attack them, only to expose the fact that they're engaging in false advertising and working with the man.
[2:56:09.700 --> 2:56:14.700]  I mean, even when mainstream news was showing the Marines killing the puppy, YouTube pulls that down.
[2:56:14.700 --> 2:56:19.700]  I mean, when videos of troops killing Iraqi children, they won't show it even when the news does.
[2:56:19.700 --> 2:56:22.700]  I mean, they're run by the feds, man.
[2:56:22.700 --> 2:56:24.700]  Oh, there's no doubt about it at all.
[2:56:24.700 --> 2:56:29.700]  And, you know, there's so many different aspects to this whole New World Order agenda.
[2:56:29.700 --> 2:56:32.700]  So many different subjects that it involves.
[2:56:32.700 --> 2:56:40.700]  And each of these subjects, I've noticed it so many times where YouTube is now restricting it in so many different ways,
[2:56:40.700 --> 2:56:45.700]  restricting the videos that we put out there. I mean, for instance, the fluoride issue,
[2:56:45.700 --> 2:56:52.700]  the question your reality video that I posted on YouTube earlier this year.
[2:56:52.700 --> 2:57:00.700]  I mean, I'd already done a fair bit of research into fluoride and, you know, and how it affects the body.
[2:57:00.700 --> 2:57:03.700]  And I was just appalled by what I learned.
[2:57:03.700 --> 2:57:11.700]  And, you know, for example, we know that fluoride, you know, is a toxic waste product from the aluminium industry.
[2:57:11.700 --> 2:57:16.700]  And, you know, when I learned all this stuff, you know, the first thing I wanted to do was just get a video out there
[2:57:16.700 --> 2:57:18.700]  to inform people, to wake people up.
[2:57:18.700 --> 2:57:21.700]  And I saw your video on fluoride and I thought, well, this is perfect.
[2:57:21.700 --> 2:57:24.700]  You expressed my thoughts exactly on that subject.
[2:57:24.700 --> 2:57:27.700]  You know, it was almost as if you'd read my mind.
[2:57:27.700 --> 2:57:32.700]  So I thought, well, I'm going to condense this video down into 10 minutes, bang it up on YouTube, which I did.
[2:57:32.700 --> 2:57:34.700]  And it achieved quite a lot of views.
[2:57:34.700 --> 2:57:42.700]  But then all of a sudden, bang, you could tell that, you know, that they were censoring it heavily, you know, fiddling the view counters.
[2:57:42.700 --> 2:57:51.700]  And I mean, when it comes to the statistics on YouTube, you just simply, you cannot trust those statistics at all,
[2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:53.700]  especially the view counter.
[2:57:53.700 --> 2:58:00.700]  That's why they freeze the view counter, because that gives them the opportunity to fiddle those numbers before we get to be able to see them.
[2:58:00.700 --> 2:58:07.700]  Yeah, well, I've got a plan. Stay there, do a few more minutes, and then we've got Dr. Russell Blalock joining us.
[2:58:07.700 --> 2:58:36.700]  Stay with us.
[2:58:37.700 --> 2:58:41.700]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[2:58:41.700 --> 2:58:46.700]  They're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[2:58:46.700 --> 2:58:50.700]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[2:58:50.700 --> 2:58:51.700]  Keep it natural.

[2:59:10.700 --> 2:59:17.700]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:59:17.700 --> 2:59:21.700]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:59:21.700 --> 2:59:22.700]  Bin Laden.
[2:59:22.700 --> 2:59:23.700]  This is his MO.
[2:59:23.700 --> 2:59:26.700]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to his home of Bin Laden.
[2:59:26.700 --> 2:59:33.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:59:33.700 --> 2:59:40.700]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:59:40.700 --> 2:59:44.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:59:44.700 --> 2:59:51.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:59:51.700 --> 2:59:54.700]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:59:54.700 --> 2:59:55.700]  Fabled Enemies.
[2:59:55.700 --> 3:00:03.700]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:00:03.700 --> 3:00:10.700]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:00:10.700 --> 3:00:14.700]  Do you take nutritional supplements but don't notice any benefit?
[3:00:14.700 --> 3:00:18.700]  The problem is, today's supplements contain things like DL-alpha-tocopherol,
[3:00:18.700 --> 3:00:21.700]  a synthetic form of vitamin E derived from petroleum,
[3:00:21.700 --> 3:00:25.700]  DL-alpha-tocopherol, an inorganic form of iron that can actually damage your body.
[3:00:25.700 --> 3:00:29.700]  Many of today's vitamin and mineral supplements are actually stressing your liver and kidneys.
[3:00:29.700 --> 3:00:32.700]  Hi, my name is Stephen Hewer, nutritionist.
[3:00:32.700 --> 3:00:35.700]  After 30 years of research and nutritional counseling,
[3:00:35.700 --> 3:00:40.700]  I've learned how the body works and how to work with it to bring about its healing and herculean health.
[3:00:40.700 --> 3:00:44.700]  Supplements can be a big waste of money if you're taking ineffective ones.
[3:00:44.700 --> 3:00:47.700]  So if you suffer from addictions, allergies,
[3:00:47.700 --> 3:00:54.700]  fatigue, depression, digestive problems, poor sleep, low libido cancer, or any affliction, I can help.
[3:00:54.700 --> 3:00:57.700]  With my programs, people get positive results in 30 days or less.
[3:00:57.700 --> 3:01:03.700]  Call me for a free mini consultation at 888-988-3325.
[3:01:03.700 --> 3:01:18.700]  That's a free mini consultation at 888-988-3325.
[3:01:33.700 --> 3:01:40.700]  We've got certified neurosurgeon, author and lecturer, Dr. Blalock.
[3:01:40.700 --> 3:01:47.700]  Russell L. Blalock, MD, speak about their discoveries of what aspartame does to the brain.
[3:01:47.700 --> 3:01:52.700]  He trained into the imminent neurosurgeon, Dr. Ludwig Kempie, and many others.
[3:01:52.700 --> 3:01:57.700]  He's got a long bio. We'll go over that. It's russellblalockmd.com.
[3:01:57.700 --> 3:02:03.700]  It's the website. But Google and YouTube, they don't want you to hear that Bellamines and 90% of the baby formula.
[3:02:03.700 --> 3:02:09.700]  They don't want you to hear that GMO crops are sterilizing and killing the rats and mice that are fetid.
[3:02:09.700 --> 3:02:15.700]  In some cases, 90% of them. They don't want you to hear that aspartame is attacking your entire body.
[3:02:15.700 --> 3:02:19.700]  They don't want you to hear that. They want to shut down the web.
[3:02:19.700 --> 3:02:23.700]  And in closing, I want to thank you for your great work, John Watkins.
[3:02:23.700 --> 3:02:30.700]  You know, I've told people, especially with my videos being edited and censored at YouTube and Google and places,
[3:02:30.700 --> 3:02:37.700]  you have to create a new account under a new name, preferably even from another IP address.
[3:02:37.700 --> 3:02:45.700]  My name cannot be in the description or the tags or any other anti-globalist, anti-New World Order stuff.
[3:02:45.700 --> 3:02:54.700]  It needs to be like Janet Jamison or Jenna Jamison or whatever her name is in the pop culture, stuff like that.
[3:02:54.700 --> 3:03:05.700]  And then you have to restrict the comments because the commenters will say my name and then the algorithm will pick that up and censor it.
[3:03:05.700 --> 3:03:11.700]  And we've had MySpace and YouTube and Google administrators send us emails. We've posted and written articles.
[3:03:11.700 --> 3:03:19.700]  They admit they censor us. My bulletins are blocked on MySpace, but we still stay there even though they censor us as an outpost.
[3:03:19.700 --> 3:03:25.700]  We know internally we've got a couple hundred thousand friends. They froze it at 55,000 friends.
[3:03:25.700 --> 3:03:31.700]  I mean, you can't believe the stuff they do because culturally, we are what the people want.
[3:03:31.700 --> 3:03:37.700]  Culturally, we're mainstream, but they have to keep acting like we're the kooks, we're the weirdos,
[3:03:37.700 --> 3:03:44.700]  and have the media say we're grassing old crazies. Doesn't matter if 92% of Americans know the government killed Kennedy.
[3:03:44.700 --> 3:03:51.700]  It's that 8% still tell us we're crazy, and they've got to control the media to keep the illusion up so the mass of us never wake up
[3:03:51.700 --> 3:03:55.700]  and realize that we're really the majority.
[3:03:55.700 --> 3:04:01.700]  So I would tell everybody, create clones of the videos and audios that you put to video of what I do.
[3:04:01.700 --> 3:04:09.700]  I know a lot of you do that and I commend you. Create clones. Upload it with the regular tags, but create doppelgangers.
[3:04:09.700 --> 3:04:13.700]  And not just YouTube and Google. Hit them everywhere.
[3:04:13.700 --> 3:04:17.700]  You know, that's why we stream our own videos at PrismPlanet.tv for the members.
[3:04:17.700 --> 3:04:21.700]  But we can't pay for the bandwidth ourselves, so we say you get a high quality video for 15 cents a day.
[3:04:21.700 --> 3:04:25.700]  Please use this as a factory of resistance. Burn them to death. Give them to people.
[3:04:25.700 --> 3:04:29.700]  Got five months free right now at PrismPlanet.tv.
[3:04:29.700 --> 3:04:33.700]  But with internet, too, they're going to shut that downwards very hard for you to get to us.
[3:04:33.700 --> 3:04:37.700]  But I'm going to do stuff like file lawsuits and stuff on them. Other people are.
[3:04:37.700 --> 3:04:43.700]  I mean, they're coming now to shut down our ability to fight them because we are kicking their criminal butts.
[3:04:43.700 --> 3:04:49.700]  There's a lot of other ideas, and again, by everybody shutting down their YouTube site for a day or two this Friday,
[3:04:49.700 --> 3:04:55.700]  it won't just be that YouTube and Google notice, their government fronts, you know, they expect it.
[3:04:55.700 --> 3:04:59.700]  They want us to get everybody else paying attention and call the media, too.
[3:04:59.700 --> 3:05:03.700]  You know, this anonymous thing going after Scientology. That's fine and dandy, and I'm all for it.
[3:05:03.700 --> 3:05:11.700]  The point is, the media gave that attention because that was an establishment. That was some rival to the system.
[3:05:11.700 --> 3:05:15.700]  Let's try to force the media to report that people are protesting and boycotting Google and YouTube.
[3:05:15.700 --> 3:05:21.700]  Let's get articles out on infowars.com or prismplanet.com about this boycott and why we're boycotting.
[3:05:21.700 --> 3:05:26.700]  And then let's try to make the mainstream media pick it up. Okay, that said, I want to go to Dr. Blalock.
[3:05:26.700 --> 3:05:33.700]  But in closing, John Watkins, I've been jumping all over you today, but you know, it's because I'm so passionate and emotional about this
[3:05:33.700 --> 3:05:38.700]  because I know it's here. It's happening. But in closing, anything else you want to add?
[3:05:38.700 --> 3:05:44.700]  Well, one thing I wanted to say was just repeat what you said about uploading videos to other videos.
[3:05:44.700 --> 3:05:51.700]  Like live video and blipTV and there are countless others out there. We can use this opportunity this weekend.
[3:05:51.700 --> 3:05:58.700]  When we're not using YouTube, we can check out some of these other sites and start uploading videos to those sites as well
[3:05:58.700 --> 3:06:04.700]  because obviously Google is not providing us with a fair level playing field to get information out there.
[3:06:04.700 --> 3:06:10.700]  So we're going to have to now concentrate on getting our information out to other video sites.
[3:06:10.700 --> 3:06:15.700]  And one thing I just wanted to add was that on my channel on YouTube,
[3:06:15.700 --> 3:06:22.700]  I'm going to try and focus on doing some videos to show other people how to create the kind of videos that I do
[3:06:22.700 --> 3:06:29.700]  to try and present information in such a way that you can wake people up basically
[3:06:29.700 --> 3:06:38.700]  and educate people on how to use certain kinds of video software to edit videos.
[3:06:38.700 --> 3:06:45.700]  And we need lots of videos as well. That's a great idea. We need lots of videos exposing the fact that they are censoring
[3:06:45.700 --> 3:06:51.700]  and then encourage others to make videos showing that and to show how they're censoring.
[3:06:51.700 --> 3:06:58.700]  But exactly, we fight for YouTube and Google. We fight to keep them from becoming totally tyrannical,
[3:06:58.700 --> 3:07:03.700]  knowing they still are though because they are becoming a government. They are becoming internet too.
[3:07:03.700 --> 3:07:08.700]  That's in the Wall Street Journal today. But while we fight a rearguard action to wake up as many as we can
[3:07:08.700 --> 3:07:12.700]  because that's what the people are, we drive them to the other alternative sites and say,
[3:07:12.700 --> 3:07:15.700]  hey, this place is no longer free. Come check this out.
[3:07:15.700 --> 3:07:20.700]  Well, I only commend you and I thank you for including me in your wonderful videos.
[3:07:20.700 --> 3:07:26.700]  And I want to have you back up in the near future, John Watkins, as we track the internet censorship that's taking place.
[3:07:26.700 --> 3:07:34.700]  Just Google YouTube, enough respect, or Google Alex Jones and some of the top videos are enough respects videos.
[3:07:34.700 --> 3:07:40.700]  He's reached, what, more than 20, 30 million people from just the video hits that Google and YouTube show.
[3:07:40.700 --> 3:07:46.700]  I'm sure it's a lot more than that. And another testament to the individual standing up and fighting back when there's a level playing field.
[3:07:46.700 --> 3:07:49.700]  That's why they're tipping the tables on us. Good to have you on, John.
[3:07:49.700 --> 3:07:54.700]  Thank you, Alex. It's an absolute pleasure to be on the show. Thanks for having me on, my friend.
[3:07:54.700 --> 3:07:59.700]  Thank you. It's good to have you here. And folks, again, if I sound desperate today, if I sound upset,
[3:07:59.700 --> 3:08:03.700]  I mean, the Marines get caught running secret checkpoints and then lie about it.
[3:08:03.700 --> 3:08:06.700]  And then we have the local news reporters on that caught them lying about it.
[3:08:06.700 --> 3:08:10.700]  I mean, they have troops running around with the police running checkpoints now.
[3:08:10.700 --> 3:08:18.700]  Foreign banks have stolen 8.5 trillion in seven weeks and counting.
[3:08:18.700 --> 3:08:21.700]  And the Congress isn't allowed to know where the money went.
[3:08:21.700 --> 3:08:26.700]  I mean, what's coming next? We need the internet to fight these people.
[3:08:26.700 --> 3:08:30.700]  Or they'll be even bigger outrageous. Okay, I apologize for getting him on about 10 minutes late.
[3:08:30.700 --> 3:08:35.700]  We got the other guest on late as well today because I wasn't on for the first 45 minutes today.
[3:08:35.700 --> 3:08:42.700]  Russell L. Blalock, MD, Surgeon, Author, Lecturer, Educator. It's Russell Blalock, md.com.
[3:08:42.700 --> 3:08:49.700]  Blalock is B-L-A-Y-L-O-C-K. And again, md.com. We have links to that up on infowars.com.
[3:08:49.700 --> 3:08:52.700]  Who knows how long you'll be able to get to a site though on our internet too.
[3:08:52.700 --> 3:08:55.700]  Sir, thank you for coming on. It's been many years.
[3:08:55.700 --> 3:08:56.700]  Well, thank you.
[3:08:56.700 --> 3:09:05.700]  Just out of the gauge, tell us about yourself, how you woke up to aspartame as a neurosurgeon and what we're facing.
[3:09:05.700 --> 3:09:16.700]  Well, as a neurosurgeon, of course, most of the things I deal with are brain trauma and strokes and ruptured aneurysms, things like this, brain tumors.
[3:09:16.700 --> 3:09:31.700]  And it led into the field of excitotoxicity, which is a process that central to virtually anything that happens to the brain, particularly brain trauma, strokes, and neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
[3:09:31.700 --> 3:09:41.700]  And as I discovered, the neurotransmitter responsible for most of these diseases is the glutamate transmitter.
[3:09:41.700 --> 3:09:47.700]  It's a very complex set of transmitters, and it's the most abundant one in the brain.
[3:09:47.700 --> 3:09:57.700]  But glutamate is very toxic to the brain, and so the brain has this enormously complex system to keep the levels outside of neurons very, very low.
[3:09:57.700 --> 3:10:16.700]  Well, as I got into this, I found out that, in fact, monosodium glutamate raises brain glutamate levels significantly, and that virtually all processed foods have some form of glutamate in it, and that Americans are consuming massive amounts of this.
[3:10:16.700 --> 3:10:27.700]  I wrote a book on it called Excitotoxins, The Taste That Kills, that goes into the research in quite some depth back in 1994.
[3:10:27.700 --> 3:10:34.700]  At the time, if you looked on the Internet, you wouldn't find a single reference to excitotoxicity.
[3:10:34.700 --> 3:10:37.700]  Now it's virtually tens of thousands of pages.
[3:10:37.700 --> 3:10:46.700]  And if you look in the neuroscience literature, it's one of the most commonly discussed topics to the excitotoxicity.
[3:10:46.700 --> 3:11:02.700]  Well, the interesting thing is that here's two major additives to foods, the aspartame and monosodium glutamate type derivatives, that are the most abundant additives in food.
[3:11:02.700 --> 3:11:09.700]  And Americans in a lot of Western countries are consuming absolutely massive amounts of it.
[3:11:09.700 --> 3:11:25.700]  Now that I've put a lot out there in the world of the science of excitotoxicity, more for the laymen as well as for the scientific audience, it's woken a lot of people up.
[3:11:25.700 --> 3:11:27.700]  They realize this is not a minor problem.
[3:11:27.700 --> 3:11:33.700]  This is a major problem because glutamate also plays a major role in brain formation.
[3:11:33.700 --> 3:11:41.700]  So your future and the future of your children is dependent on how the brain forms.
[3:11:41.700 --> 3:11:55.700]  And we know that if you elevate glutamate levels early in development, particularly in the pregnant woman and in early in life, during that first two years after birth, you can cause significant abnormalities in brain formation.
[3:11:55.700 --> 3:11:57.700]  And that's exactly what we're seeing.
[3:11:57.700 --> 3:12:08.700]  If you compare the experimental results of this excitotoxic research with these additives, it's just what we're seeing on a massive rise in the society.
[3:12:08.700 --> 3:12:19.700]  For instance, the ADHD, the autism, we're seeing all sorts of neurodevelopmental problems, language problems, behavior problems, anxiety, depression.
[3:12:19.700 --> 3:12:24.700]  And that's MSG and a larger family of these chemicals.
[3:12:24.700 --> 3:12:36.700]  Yeah, what the food industry has done, because of this enormous amount of research pointing out this toxicity, the FDA has allowed them to use this guy's name.
[3:12:36.700 --> 3:12:43.700]  They call it hydrolyzed protein, soy protein, extract, isolate, KCNA, all sorts of this guy's name.
[3:12:43.700 --> 3:12:48.700]  So it's difficult for people to keep up with that list because it's ever changing.
[3:12:48.700 --> 3:12:54.700]  And soon people won't be able to hear the show anymore because of YouTube and Google and Internet too.
[3:12:54.700 --> 3:12:57.700]  Only on the few M&Fs that were on in shortwave.
[3:12:57.700 --> 3:12:59.700]  I mean, these people are destroying themselves.
[3:12:59.700 --> 3:13:07.700]  Don't worry, hey, Google employees, buy your kids a big bag of burrito nacho cheese MSG and just fry their brains.
[3:13:07.700 --> 3:13:10.700]  Dr. Blaylock, stay with us. Appreciate you joining us.

[3:14:10.700 --> 3:14:17.700]  May I have everyone's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:14:17.700 --> 3:14:20.700]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:14:20.700 --> 3:14:27.700]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF?
[3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:36.700]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:14:36.700 --> 3:14:42.700]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:14:42.700 --> 3:14:46.700]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:14:46.700 --> 3:14:52.700]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:14:52.700 --> 3:14:55.700]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:14:55.700 --> 3:15:20.700]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[3:15:20.700 --> 3:15:31.700]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S.
[3:15:31.700 --> 3:15:38.700]  hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S. treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[3:15:38.700 --> 3:15:48.700]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S. housing market, and throwing the economy into a recession.
[3:15:48.700 --> 3:15:52.700]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[3:15:52.700 --> 3:15:58.700]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[3:17:21.700 --> 3:17:31.700]  Dr. Blaylock, long segment coming up. This one's short. Let's get into it. So you started discovering, as a neurosurgeon, researching the brain, what excitotoxins were and what they were doing.
[3:17:31.700 --> 3:17:41.700]  I mean, a lot of people can't eat MSG. They swell up, red, get headaches. If I eat just a little bit of it, I mean, I know right away I'll get a headache.
[3:17:41.700 --> 3:17:51.700]  And I know they make it out of petrochemicals and things. And again, what's wrong with the food industry? What's wrong with the system? And then from that, you learned about aspartame.
[3:17:51.700 --> 3:17:55.700]  So continue with telling us what we're facing.
[3:17:55.700 --> 3:18:15.700]  Well, you know, the people who react as you're describing are the lucky ones because they're not going to eat food that contains MSG. What happens to the majority of the people is they don't have any outward symptoms at all. But the destruction of neurons in the brain and the connection that synapses with the dendroids is an ongoing process.
[3:18:15.700 --> 3:18:33.700]  The more they eat, the higher the brain levels of agglutamate, the more destruction. And certain areas of the brain are more sensitive than others. One of the reactions that I'm working on now that's a growing research interest is that MSG activates the brain's immune cell called the microglia.
[3:18:33.700 --> 3:18:44.700]  And that if we look at all the neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's disease, it's this chronic activation of microglia that seems to be the central feature.
[3:18:44.700 --> 3:18:59.700]  MSG readily activates this microglia style and does so for a very long period of time. It also produces enormous pre-radical generation in the brain and the entire body. And this is strongly correlated to these neurodegenerative diseases.
[3:18:59.700 --> 3:19:09.700]  And in childhood, as I said, it alters the development of the brain. So you have children who have behavioral problems, they become depressed, suicidal, homicidal.
[3:19:09.700 --> 3:19:14.700]  I cover this on a DVD I did called Nutrition and Behavior, which you can get off my website.
[3:19:14.700 --> 3:19:15.700]  Absolutely.
[3:19:15.700 --> 3:19:24.700]  That goes into a lot of detail of exactly how all of this works, how much we know about it, what to do about it, how to neutralize some of these effects.
[3:19:24.700 --> 3:19:30.700]  But the real shocking thing is, you know, the book Excited Toxins covers mostly what happens to the brain.
[3:19:30.700 --> 3:19:43.700]  And recently they've discovered that these glutamate receptors exist in virtually every organ and tissue in the entire body. And that one of the shocking thing was that when you raise the glutamate levels in the blood,
[3:19:43.700 --> 3:19:54.700]  cancers start to grow very rapidly and become highly invasive. And this covers a lot of cancer, things like breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer.
[3:19:54.700 --> 3:20:04.700]  All of these cancers will grow much faster, become infinitely more deadly and invasive in the presence of high blood levels of glutamate.
[3:20:04.700 --> 3:20:12.700]  Well, humans out of all the animal species have the highest level of blood glutamate when you feed them glutamate.
[3:20:12.700 --> 3:20:19.700]  It's five times higher than any known animal species. So we are the most sensitive of anything.
[3:20:19.700 --> 3:20:38.700]  And so when you load the food up like it's been loaded, and the investigations by the government itself showed that the blood levels in humans rise as much as 40 to 50 fold with eating food that people commonly eat, processed food.
[3:20:38.700 --> 3:20:45.700]  So we're getting enormous blood levels sufficient to cause the brain lesions as well as to promote cancer growth.
[3:20:45.700 --> 3:20:52.700]  Well, then they looked at, well, what is it doing in the heart? Well, the heart also has an enormous number of these glutamate receptors.
[3:20:52.700 --> 3:21:02.700]  In fact, throughout its entire electrical system, as well as the cardiocyte itself, the heart muscle cell.
[3:21:02.700 --> 3:21:09.700]  And that there's a strong correlation between people having sudden cardiac death, which is on the increase.
[3:21:09.700 --> 3:21:19.700]  These young people dropping dead of a heart attack, people eating a meal and soon after dropping dead of heart attack and unable to resuscitate them in the emergency room.
[3:21:19.700 --> 3:21:33.700]  And what they find is that if their magnesium level is low, which is very common in American society, and you feed them MSG, the heart goes into arrhythmia because it's stimulating these heart glutamate receptors.
[3:21:33.700 --> 3:21:50.700]  And it's very difficult to resuscitate that person. And so what we're seeing is a lot of death, a lot of growth of cancer and invasion of cancer, as well as all sorts of medical problems based on the fact our food is absolutely loaded with monosodium glutamate.
[3:21:50.700 --> 3:21:55.700]  Yeah, they're only adding more of it now along with aspartame and other things.
[3:21:55.700 --> 3:22:03.700]  And there's a lot of medical research on this, thanks to you and others now. And I guess the system that they just don't care. I guess the owners of these companies shovel it in their own children's mouths.
[3:22:03.700 --> 3:22:13.700]  Well, not only that, I think what they do is they protect theirself and their children because they know that this is toxic. I mean, the literature is overwhelming.
[3:22:13.700 --> 3:22:22.700]  And so there's no question of the toxicity. There's no question of what I've been telling you. The research is enormous in this area.
[3:22:22.700 --> 3:22:35.700]  So they know what they've done. They formed the Glutamate Technical Association, which is a conglomeration of the major producer of aspartame and MSG, which is the Dinamoto Company.
[3:22:35.700 --> 3:22:47.700]  And they are a hit squad. Anybody who says anything about them, they bring all the forces of their corporation and their money and researchers that they buy to say that it's not true.
[3:22:47.700 --> 3:22:53.700]  They buy a lot of advertisements and magazines and newspapers so that it'll never enter a...
[3:22:53.700 --> 3:23:00.700]  All right, stay there. Stay there, Doctor. We'll come back and talk about a lot more. Stay with us.
[3:23:00.700 --> 3:23:10.700]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:23:10.700 --> 3:23:23.700]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your families survive the global economic crash,

[3:24:10.700 --> 3:24:17.700]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:24:17.700 --> 3:24:21.700]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the enemy?
[3:24:21.700 --> 3:24:26.700]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:24:26.700 --> 3:24:33.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:24:33.700 --> 3:24:40.700]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:24:40.700 --> 3:24:44.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:24:44.700 --> 3:24:54.700]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[3:24:54.700 --> 3:25:03.700]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:25:03.700 --> 3:25:10.700]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[3:25:10.700 --> 3:25:19.700]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:25:19.700 --> 3:25:24.700]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:25:24.700 --> 3:25:35.700]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[3:25:35.700 --> 3:25:41.700]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[3:25:41.700 --> 3:25:47.700]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[3:25:47.700 --> 3:25:55.700]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[3:26:25.700 --> 3:26:30.700]  If you're not buying it, they just changed the name.
[3:26:30.700 --> 3:26:36.700]  And you can say they do this so they can sell you bad tasting food and cover it up, but it's more than that.
[3:26:36.700 --> 3:26:41.700]  Dr. Blalock, I mean, you're an accomplished neurosurgeon.
[3:26:41.700 --> 3:26:44.700]  You've done a lot of your own studies.
[3:26:44.700 --> 3:26:50.700]  I mean, I've gone back to the original studies with Aspartame when they approved it back in the 80s, you know, killing the monkeys, as you know.
[3:26:50.700 --> 3:26:55.700]  And they know GMO food that's had the genes altered, is hurting the lab animals as well.
[3:26:55.700 --> 3:27:00.700]  They just don't care. Where does this attitude come from and why are they doing this?
[3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:11.700]  Well, the more you look at this, you know, I've looked into this probably a lot deeper than a lot of people that are interested in food and technology and things.
[3:27:11.700 --> 3:27:23.700]  It goes back to the Rockefeller Foundation back in the 1910-1920 era, where Rockefeller was obsessed with medical care.
[3:27:23.700 --> 3:27:29.700]  He was the person who was the primary financial source for the Flexional Report.
[3:27:29.700 --> 3:27:34.700]  And what the Flexional Report essentially did is took over all medical care in the United States.
[3:27:34.700 --> 3:27:45.700]  It closed down half of the medical schools in the United States. It appointed most of the presidents of the medical universities that were allowed to subsist.
[3:27:45.700 --> 3:27:52.700]  And the foundation, the Rockefeller Ford Foundation, Carnegie Foundation, set the curriculum.
[3:27:52.700 --> 3:27:56.700]  Now, at the time, Rockefeller owned a lot of pharmaceutical companies.
[3:27:56.700 --> 3:28:03.700]  In fact, most of the major pharmaceutical companies in the world, including some foreign pharmaceutical companies like Merck.
[3:28:03.700 --> 3:28:06.700]  It was a German company.
[3:28:06.700 --> 3:28:16.700]  So he had a vested interest in making the curriculum in medical schools pointed mainly towards pharmaceutical solutions to disease.
[3:28:16.700 --> 3:28:29.700]  Well, that's persisted into the present day, is that we've created a medical educational curriculum throughout most of the schools that preaches certain things
[3:28:29.700 --> 3:28:35.700]  that are considered so-called orthodox medicine. Everything outside of that is to be chunted.
[3:28:35.700 --> 3:28:45.700]  Well, I spend an inordinate amount of time researching and looking through and reading literally thousands of studies from all over the world,
[3:28:45.700 --> 3:28:50.700]  all reported in high quality research journals and medical journals.
[3:28:50.700 --> 3:28:55.700]  What's amazing is most of this is never seen by a practicing physician.
[3:28:55.700 --> 3:28:58.700]  They don't even know this research exists.
[3:28:58.700 --> 3:29:03.700]  I know a neurosurgical colleague at meetings and such about excitable toxicity.
[3:29:03.700 --> 3:29:08.700]  Most look at me like a deer in a headlight. I have no idea what I'm talking about.
[3:29:08.700 --> 3:29:13.700]  They haven't even been exposed to the word excitable toxicity.
[3:29:13.700 --> 3:29:21.700]  Now they're beginning to hear it, but they still don't understand that they're feeding their patients tons of this stuff in their diet
[3:29:21.700 --> 3:29:25.700]  and it's making their neurological conditions much worse.
[3:29:25.700 --> 3:29:30.700]  And so the patients can't recover, they have seizures, all sorts of problems.
[3:29:30.700 --> 3:29:37.700]  When you look at the impact of this on American society and other societies in the world,
[3:29:37.700 --> 3:29:43.700]  it's absolutely enormous because it affects how the brain functions, particularly its higher functions.
[3:29:43.700 --> 3:29:52.700]  That is, a drug addiction. We know that the centers of the brain that controls addiction are regulated by glutamate
[3:29:52.700 --> 3:30:00.700]  and that when you stimulate these centers with glutamate, it increases your craving for all sorts of addictive impulses.
[3:30:00.700 --> 3:30:05.700]  And that if you block these glutamate receptors, people lose their addiction.
[3:30:05.700 --> 3:30:10.700]  So addiction is a very strongly correlated. We know depression.
[3:30:10.700 --> 3:30:20.700]  Now the psychiatric profession is moving into the idea that depression is primarily an excess glutamate in the brain.
[3:30:20.700 --> 3:30:25.700]  Well, here we're feeding tons and tons of glutamate people.
[3:30:25.700 --> 3:30:35.700]  So we're increasing depression, anxiety, suicide, homicides based on this psychological effect of high glutamate levels in the brain.
[3:30:35.700 --> 3:30:38.700]  This is a very hot area of research.
[3:30:38.700 --> 3:30:46.700]  And most of the drugs that seem to do the most good in combating depression have to do with blocking glutamate receptors.
[3:30:46.700 --> 3:30:52.700]  I covered this in one of my recent newsletters. I have a newsletter that goes into a lot of these things.
[3:30:52.700 --> 3:30:58.700]  Let's stop there, doctor, because time is running out here in the hour and I want to have you back up for two hours in the near future.
[3:30:58.700 --> 3:31:06.700]  It's been too long. You've got so much knowledge. Tell folks about the film, the books, the materials, the newsletter, and how folks can get those.
[3:31:06.700 --> 3:31:21.700]  Well, everything you can get through my website, www.russellblaylockmd.com. But I have a DVD on nutrition and behavior, which goes in depth about what a fat sugar has on your brain.
[3:31:21.700 --> 3:31:29.700]  The glutamate, how sugar produces hypoglycema, and that produces disruption of the brain.
[3:31:29.700 --> 3:31:36.700]  Children that are bouncing off the wall, anxiety problems, school learning difficulties, all this is connected.
[3:31:36.700 --> 3:31:44.700]  And then I go into how to correct that, what to do to combat that and improve your child's brain function and behavior.
[3:31:44.700 --> 3:31:52.700]  I have a newsletter, which is published by Newsmax, which goes into a lot of different health things.
[3:31:52.700 --> 3:31:59.700]  It goes into diabetes. It goes into pharmaceutical effects, depletion of minerals.
[3:31:59.700 --> 3:32:05.700]  It goes into ways to protect your brain against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and the effects of obesity.
[3:32:05.700 --> 3:32:12.700]  And one of the things that I've made a newsletter out of was MSG. And a particular concern was the obesity epidemic.
[3:32:12.700 --> 3:32:23.700]  One of the earliest findings of MSG and aspartame feeding was that it produces gross obesity in animals and virtually every species.
[3:32:23.700 --> 3:32:30.700]  If you feed it early in life, that animal for the rest of your life will be obese. And we know the same thing happens in humans.
[3:32:30.700 --> 3:32:37.700]  And that's now happening. I mean, we have this obesity epidemic, though I've heard the studies that Americans really are eating more than we ate 30, 40 years ago.
[3:32:37.700 --> 3:32:47.700]  It's that we've got all these toxins. And doesn't the MSG and aspartame block the chemicals in the brain that let us know we're full?
[3:32:47.700 --> 3:32:59.700]  Well, what it primarily does, it damages an area the hypothalamus called the archaeate nucleus is where leptin and upright leptin is what helps you burn off fat and it helps control your appetite.
[3:32:59.700 --> 3:33:08.700]  So when you destroy that center of your brain in the hypothalamus, you begin to gain weight, even eating a very low calorie diet.
[3:33:08.700 --> 3:33:15.700]  It's almost impossible to control your weight, which is what was discovered with MSG exposed animals.
[3:33:15.700 --> 3:33:22.700]  You can't exercise it all very easily. You can't diet all very easily. It's a very resistant obesity.
[3:33:22.700 --> 3:33:30.700]  The really frightening thing was that it produces in animals and humans probably metabolic syndrome.
[3:33:30.700 --> 3:33:40.700]  Well, there are 45 million Americans who now have metabolic syndrome, one of the most rapidly accelerating diseases in Western society.
[3:33:40.700 --> 3:33:47.700]  And we can directly link it to this massive consumption of glutamate and aspartame.
[3:33:47.700 --> 3:33:54.700]  It will produce the exact syndrome in animals, the obesity, the hypertension.
[3:33:54.700 --> 3:33:59.700]  How do you know that area is destroyed? I mean, I had a lot of MSG growing up as a child. What do I do?
[3:33:59.700 --> 3:34:07.700]  Well, it depends on your antioxidant. It depends on your diet, which will help protect you to some degree.
[3:34:07.700 --> 3:34:11.700]  But there's a lot of things you can do nutritionally to help repair these things.
[3:34:11.700 --> 3:34:20.700]  One of the primary events of excitotoxicity is rather than just killing cells, it destroys a lot of the synaptic connections,
[3:34:20.700 --> 3:34:24.700]  which you can repair by changing your diet, getting the MSG out.
[3:34:24.700 --> 3:34:26.700]  The brain's always trying to rewire, right?
[3:34:26.700 --> 3:34:33.700]  Yeah, it's called plasticity. We have brain plasticity from conception all the way up to age 100.
[3:34:33.700 --> 3:34:41.700]  They did a study on people in their hundreds and found the same plasticity was taking place, this massive repair of damage.
[3:34:41.700 --> 3:34:49.700]  The problem is, as you pointed out, is we're inundated with so many toxins and bad diet that we can't repair it.
[3:34:49.700 --> 3:34:52.700]  We're just constantly damaging it over and over and over.
[3:34:52.700 --> 3:34:57.700]  Doctor, haven't they also found that these excitotoxins are addictive?
[3:34:57.700 --> 3:35:04.700]  Absolutely. As I said, it seems to operate the part of the brain that has to do with addiction.
[3:35:04.700 --> 3:35:10.700]  When you raise glutamate levels in the brain, it's much easier to produce addiction.
[3:35:10.700 --> 3:35:13.700]  It's very difficult to overcome addiction.
[3:35:13.700 --> 3:35:19.700]  The drugs we know that help fight addiction are the ones that reduce brain glutamate.
[3:35:19.700 --> 3:35:24.700]  I was going to go on to say that glutamates themselves are addictive too, correct?
[3:35:24.700 --> 3:35:28.700]  Well, because the glutamate is the neurotransmitter in the brain that's doing it.
[3:35:28.700 --> 3:35:33.700]  When you take MSG, it's the glutamate part of it, not the sodium.
[3:35:33.700 --> 3:35:38.700]  It's the glutamate that is in the brain stimulating these receptors that produce problems.
[3:35:38.700 --> 3:35:43.700]  Sure. Going back to the Rockefellers, I mean, I've studied mainline history, and it's true.
[3:35:43.700 --> 3:35:51.700]  They just took over the whole, quote, industry just like groups are taking over the internet now and just making it theirs through government.
[3:35:51.700 --> 3:35:58.700]  That's where the real fortunes are made is by using government or foundation money to just take over industries.
[3:35:58.700 --> 3:36:06.700]  I mean, I was blown away by the 40s how many hospitals were directly owned through fake charities by the Rockefellers.
[3:36:06.700 --> 3:36:10.700]  And of course, you know they're eugenicists. They're in the population reduction.
[3:36:10.700 --> 3:36:14.700]  They were the big eugenicists that funded it all here in the United States.
[3:36:14.700 --> 3:36:20.700]  Dr. Boylock, from your research, I mean, is this being done on purpose, cold-bloodedly?
[3:36:20.700 --> 3:36:24.700]  Oh, absolutely. And there's several good books written about it.
[3:36:24.700 --> 3:36:42.700]  One is a history of molecular biology in the United States, which says that the Rockefellers' purpose for funding medical care and for funding research in molecular biology was because they wanted to find a way for social control.
[3:36:42.700 --> 3:36:50.700]  They first tried eugenics, as you said, in the early 20s. They were the major funders of eugenics in the United States.
[3:36:50.700 --> 3:36:57.700]  And if you had such bad publicity, they dropped it, and then they got together with their scientists that they were a better way.
[3:36:57.700 --> 3:37:05.700]  They'd be altering genes and regulating, changing the regulators of cell function and brain function, and then we can initiate social control.
[3:37:05.700 --> 3:37:14.700]  So this history of molecular biology tech goes into great detail, says that their motivation was social control.
[3:37:14.700 --> 3:37:20.700]  Well, that is controlling the peasants, so they'll do what you tell them to do.
[3:37:20.700 --> 3:37:31.700]  And of course, it's all collectivism, as you said, and that is you have private giant mega-corporations who are in link with government to control all the society.
[3:37:31.700 --> 3:37:36.700]  And the idea of collectivism is to produce the United States as one giant corporation.
[3:37:36.700 --> 3:37:47.700]  And it's so cold-blooded to knowingly attack people's brains, their reproductive centers, everything, and then just gather status, and just cold-bloodily doing it.
[3:37:47.700 --> 3:37:57.700]  Well, if you read the history of the Rockefellers, you see they started wars, they did all sorts of things to gain all contraction and to get to Saudi Arabia.
[3:37:57.700 --> 3:38:08.700]  You know, they were the ones that made the deal with the Soviets to get to Saudi Arabian oil fields, and they were funding communism to the tune of billions.
[3:38:08.700 --> 3:38:20.700]  Building their military, you know, it's all carefully documented in Anthony Sutton's series of books, showing that they funded the entire communist military in a communist operation,
[3:38:20.700 --> 3:38:29.700]  purely to get deals, to get the Caucasus oil fields, and the Saudi Arabian oil fields, as well as the Chinese oil fields.
[3:38:29.700 --> 3:38:41.700]  You know, the Rockefellers primary funder of the Institute of Pacific Relations, which was the propaganda network that worked through our government back in the 1930s and 40s
[3:38:41.700 --> 3:38:48.700]  to engineer the fall of China to the Chinese communists so that Rockefeller could get the oil fields.
[3:38:48.700 --> 3:38:52.700]  And by the way, that's now declassified, it's even on History Channel.
[3:38:52.700 --> 3:39:00.700]  I mean, this is so sick, well, that's what Quigley wrote, as you know, but he bragged it, Georgetown, that they fund the fascists and the communists,
[3:39:00.700 --> 3:39:06.700]  and now they're doing it here, they are just so ruthless, and the public has no idea how much attack they're under.
[3:39:06.700 --> 3:39:15.700]  Well, they had no compassion for the millions of people who died in both world wars, no compassion for the people dying in Korea,
[3:39:15.700 --> 3:39:26.700]  and people don't know that during the entire Korean War, the Rockefeller family was supplying all the oil used for the jets of North Korea to kill ourselves.
[3:39:26.700 --> 3:39:37.700]  You know, this has been going on since the 1910, so they have been major funders of the enemies of the United States.
[3:39:37.700 --> 3:39:48.700]  They have taken over our government through the Council of Foreign Relations Collateral Commission, and a lot of this is linked to what I'm talking about with these food attitudes and drugs,
[3:39:48.700 --> 3:39:51.700]  because that's also how to control the population.
[3:39:51.700 --> 3:39:55.700]  Oh, the public, it's not just that they're ignorant, they really are brain damaged.
[3:39:55.700 --> 3:39:56.700]  Sure.
[3:39:56.700 --> 3:40:05.700]  And there's no critical thinking, and folks, if you've still got your brains intact, or if you can even hazily understand what I'm saying here,
[3:40:05.700 --> 3:40:13.700]  you can heal yourself and get your brain back, and it's easier said than done, and it's so hard for me to even try to stay healthy as much as I'm working,
[3:40:13.700 --> 3:40:15.700]  but I know as a doctor, how do you do it?
[3:40:15.700 --> 3:40:18.700]  How do you keep all this stuff out of your diet?
[3:40:18.700 --> 3:40:22.700]  Well, I only eat foods that are fresh.
[3:40:22.700 --> 3:40:24.700]  I don't eat any processed food.
[3:40:24.700 --> 3:40:30.700]  I avoid all of these gravies and sauces that they make commercially.
[3:40:30.700 --> 3:40:34.700]  I don't eat any Doritos or any of these junk foods.
[3:40:34.700 --> 3:40:40.700]  It's all fresh food, freshly made, a lot of vegetables, fruits that are fresh.
[3:40:40.700 --> 3:40:47.700]  Try to stay away from anything that's GMO, so you can do it.
[3:40:47.700 --> 3:40:51.700]  And what you find out is that you correct your diet, your thinking clears up.
[3:40:51.700 --> 3:40:58.700]  You can think with a very clear mind, your language function improves, your memory improves,
[3:40:58.700 --> 3:41:06.700]  and then you can use some supplements, even stimulate repair of some of this damage to the brain and to the rest of the body.
[3:41:06.700 --> 3:41:10.700]  So now they're moving in, wanting to radiate all the meat, even radiate all the vegetables.
[3:41:10.700 --> 3:41:12.700]  It's just unbelievable.
[3:41:12.700 --> 3:41:17.700]  Well, the other arm of it is not only that, but then they want to take away the supplement.
[3:41:17.700 --> 3:41:20.700]  They want to outlaw the entire supplement.
[3:41:20.700 --> 3:41:28.700]  So they have absolute control over it, and I keep telling the people in the alternative medicine field,
[3:41:28.700 --> 3:41:36.700]  what's going to happen is they're going to turn these major producers of the supplements over to the major pharmaceutical companies,
[3:41:36.700 --> 3:41:44.700]  and only doctors can prescribe supplements, because they know that these supplements are exceeding anything that medicine has to offer.
[3:41:44.700 --> 3:41:45.700]  They know that.
[3:41:45.700 --> 3:41:52.700]  What they know now is that they can't make these prescription drugs, so they can't control the price.
[3:41:52.700 --> 3:41:59.700]  But if government says only physicians can prescribe them, then they become pharmaceutical drugs,
[3:41:59.700 --> 3:42:06.700]  and that the price of them will increase astronomically, and suddenly you'll see a shift in what these people say,
[3:42:06.700 --> 3:42:13.700]  instead of attacking the natural supplements, they'll say that the greatest fine that medicine has ever made.
[3:42:13.700 --> 3:42:19.700]  But they don't want us to be healthy, and I know the doctors are ignorant and compartmentalized.
[3:42:19.700 --> 3:42:24.700]  Well, the doctors won't know how to prescribe it, because doctors don't know anything about any of it.
[3:42:24.700 --> 3:42:29.700]  Most of the doctors know absolutely nothing about any of what I've told you.
[3:42:29.700 --> 3:42:31.700]  They know almost nothing about diet.
[3:42:31.700 --> 3:42:34.700]  They know almost nothing about any supplement.
[3:42:34.700 --> 3:42:42.700]  They're so heavily and badly brain damaged themselves, and so propagandized by it.
[3:42:42.700 --> 3:42:44.700]  They just don't understand.
[3:42:44.700 --> 3:42:45.700]  They refuse to read it.
[3:42:45.700 --> 3:42:47.700]  They refuse to look at it.
[3:42:47.700 --> 3:42:58.700]  And as we move into full socialized medicine, it will be against the law for them to even suggest to a patient that they take a supplement.
[3:42:58.700 --> 3:42:59.700]  That's what I was about to say.
[3:42:59.700 --> 3:43:06.700]  All this socialized medicine means they'll control every aspect of what a doctor can do and have total control over you.
[3:43:06.700 --> 3:43:11.700]  Doctor, we're out of time, because there's a short segment at the end, and I'm going to cover some final news.
[3:43:11.700 --> 3:43:16.700]  I really appreciate you spending time with us, and I forgot how important all your information is.
[3:43:16.700 --> 3:43:18.700]  Do you have your book in front of you?
[3:43:18.700 --> 3:43:22.700]  Is there any way I can hear on air, set you up for like an hour and a half, two hours?
[3:43:22.700 --> 3:43:28.700]  Maybe early next week before Christmas or after Christmas the next week?
[3:43:28.700 --> 3:43:32.700]  Probably best after Christmas.
[3:43:32.700 --> 3:43:33.700]  Fantastic.
[3:43:33.700 --> 3:43:38.700]  Well, what we'll do is then, how about January 3rd or 4th, 5th, something like that?

[3:43:46.700 --> 3:43:53.700]  Yeah, January 5th, I'll look at it, just have your person contact me and we'll affirm that up.

[3:44:02.700 --> 3:44:04.700]  Okay, thank you so much for the time.
[3:44:04.700 --> 3:44:11.700]  Let me say bye to you here off air.

[3:47:29.700 --> 3:47:37.700]  All right, it is the final segment here, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:47:37.700 --> 3:47:39.700]  And there's a lot of news I got to, a lot of news I didn't cover.
[3:47:39.700 --> 3:47:44.700]  That radio station's tried to fax us a few times, the Marine Corps pressed release.
[3:47:44.700 --> 3:47:46.700]  Of course, our fax machine was broken.
[3:47:46.700 --> 3:47:48.700]  So we're trying to do an eFax.
[3:47:48.700 --> 3:47:54.700]  That'll be up in a story Kurt Nemo's already written about the Marines.
[3:47:54.700 --> 3:48:00.700]  We'll have that available soon up at, oh, we did just get the fax.
[3:48:00.700 --> 3:48:02.700]  Okay, we did just get it.
[3:48:02.700 --> 3:48:05.700]  So, Aaron, will you get that posted in Nemo's story he wrote about it?
[3:48:05.700 --> 3:48:06.700]  Great job.
[3:48:06.700 --> 3:48:07.700]  Thank you, my friend.
[3:48:07.700 --> 3:48:12.700]  Yeah, here it is, the Marines, saying the Marines would be involved.
[3:48:12.700 --> 3:48:16.700]  US Marine Corps involved the checkpoints and then now they've tried to back off of this.
[3:48:16.700 --> 3:48:19.700]  And then they lied and said they weren't there and then it turned out they were there.
[3:48:19.700 --> 3:48:23.700]  So that's coming up, by the way, in the rebroadcast.
[3:48:23.700 --> 3:48:28.700]  The last three or four minutes I've got, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[3:48:28.700 --> 3:48:38.700]  Ted Anderson bought gold, I don't know, two and a half, three weeks ago, a whole bunch of it, when gold was at 740.
[3:48:38.700 --> 3:48:43.700]  It's now at above 830 today and rising.
[3:48:43.700 --> 3:48:48.700]  And we've got all these pundits and experts on TV saying 1500 to 2000 in the next few months.
[3:48:48.700 --> 3:48:50.700]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[3:48:50.700 --> 3:48:53.700]  I just know gold is way undervalued.
[3:48:53.700 --> 3:48:59.700]  And again, Ted got so much gold that this is the very tail end of it.
[3:48:59.700 --> 3:49:04.700]  Ted, you said of gold at that price, all you have left is British sovereigns and what else?
[3:49:04.700 --> 3:49:07.700]  Well, I got the British sovereign and I have the Frank.
[3:49:07.700 --> 3:49:10.700]  The $10 Indians, the $10 liberties are sold out.
[3:49:10.700 --> 3:49:14.700]  The $5 gold pieces that I had in here, they're sold out as well.
[3:49:14.700 --> 3:49:15.700]  I do have the British sovereigns.
[3:49:15.700 --> 3:49:19.700]  I have the Franks and I came into something that is really interesting that I haven't seen in a long time.
[3:49:19.700 --> 3:49:24.700]  And that's the Vienna Philharmonic, the one ounce coins there.
[3:49:24.700 --> 3:49:27.700]  I only have 80 of them, total, 80.
[3:49:27.700 --> 3:49:29.700]  Did you sell out of those buffaloes?
[3:49:29.700 --> 3:49:31.700]  The buffaloes did go, they're gone.
[3:49:31.700 --> 3:49:36.700]  But the Vienna Philharmonic is a coin just like that, that's in total demand.
[3:49:36.700 --> 3:49:42.700]  And the buffaloes were over a thousand bucks apiece where these Philharmonics are only 967.
[3:49:42.700 --> 3:49:43.700]  That's a great deal.
[3:49:43.700 --> 3:49:44.700]  So let's explain.
[3:49:44.700 --> 3:49:45.700]  Everywhere else, gold's at a premium.
[3:49:45.700 --> 3:49:46.700]  You can't even find it.
[3:49:46.700 --> 3:49:49.700]  There's a 30, 40% premium on it above spot price.
[3:49:49.700 --> 3:49:52.700]  Ted bought gold at $740 an ounce.
[3:49:52.700 --> 3:49:54.700]  That's the price that's priced into these coins.
[3:49:54.700 --> 3:50:01.700]  And on the sovereigns, on the Franks, the best coins you can buy, he still has it at the $740 level.
[3:50:01.700 --> 3:50:03.700]  Now you have 80 of the Philharmonics left.
[3:50:03.700 --> 3:50:06.700]  How many of the Franks and the sovereigns do you have?
[3:50:06.700 --> 3:50:09.700]  Because when you first did that buy, you had like 10, 15 coins.
[3:50:09.700 --> 3:50:11.700]  You're down to, what, three coins now?
[3:50:11.700 --> 3:50:12.700]  Three different offers.
[3:50:12.700 --> 3:50:13.700]  What do you have left, Ted?
[3:50:13.700 --> 3:50:17.700]  What I have left are the British sovereigns, they're currently right now at $242.
[3:50:17.700 --> 3:50:20.700]  Mind you, gold hit a high today of $848.
[3:50:20.700 --> 3:50:21.700]  Oh, okay.
[3:50:21.700 --> 3:50:22.700]  I'm sorry, $848.
[3:50:22.700 --> 3:50:24.700]  So we're talking $108.
[3:50:24.700 --> 3:50:27.700]  You're selling this for $108.
[3:50:27.700 --> 3:50:31.700]  I mean, you bought this at $108 under what it is right now.
[3:50:31.700 --> 3:50:32.700]  Yep, that's right.
[3:50:32.700 --> 3:50:34.700]  And then you've got the Franks, they're at $195.
[3:50:34.700 --> 3:50:36.700]  They're at that same price level.
[3:50:36.700 --> 3:50:42.700]  And in addition to this, those gold Philharmonics are almost $100 less than the buffaloes.
[3:50:42.700 --> 3:50:48.700]  And they're equally as scarce, equally as rare, and certainly as much desired as far as a coin.
[3:50:48.700 --> 3:50:52.700]  So basically, you're getting a beautiful collector coin at basically bullion prices.
[3:50:52.700 --> 3:50:54.700]  Well, that's what's going on here.
[3:50:54.700 --> 3:50:58.700]  You're getting the coins right at the melt value or at or near that, especially those.
[3:50:58.700 --> 3:51:01.700]  Look, here at the end of the show, I just want to tell you something.
[3:51:01.700 --> 3:51:02.700]  This is a great deal.
[3:51:02.700 --> 3:51:04.700]  For those of you that don't know the gold business, check it out.
[3:51:04.700 --> 3:51:05.700]  It's a great deal.
[3:51:05.700 --> 3:51:07.700]  For those that do, you know how good a deal this is.
[3:51:07.700 --> 3:51:09.700]  How long can you offer this, Ted?
[3:51:09.700 --> 3:51:14.700]  Well, the British sovereigns, I'm sorry, the Philharmonics will be sold out after 80 coins.
[3:51:14.700 --> 3:51:15.700]  I can't do 81.
[3:51:15.700 --> 3:51:18.700]  The British sovereigns and the Franks will hold that right through midnight.
[3:51:18.700 --> 3:51:19.700]  All right, here's the number.
[3:51:19.700 --> 3:51:26.700]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[3:51:26.700 --> 3:51:27.700]  Please give the brokers a call.
[3:51:27.700 --> 3:51:29.700]  They'll be there till midnight tonight.
[3:51:29.700 --> 3:51:31.700]  First come, first serve on the Philharmonics.
[3:51:31.700 --> 3:51:38.700]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[3:51:38.700 --> 3:51:39.700]  Don't wait.
[3:51:39.700 --> 3:51:44.700]  Protect yourselves from the raping bankers and Google that covers up for them.
[3:51:44.700 --> 3:51:47.700]  Please get the coins, 800-686-2237.
[3:51:47.700 --> 3:51:50.700]  Re-transmission starts now at infowars.com.

[3:51:54.700 --> 3:52:00.700]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:52:00.700 --> 3:52:07.700]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:52:07.700 --> 3:52:10.700]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:52:10.700 --> 3:52:11.700]  Who is the enemy?
[3:52:11.700 --> 3:52:12.700]  bin Laden.
[3:52:12.700 --> 3:52:13.700]  This is his ammo.
[3:52:13.700 --> 3:52:14.700]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:52:14.700 --> 3:52:16.700]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:52:16.700 --> 3:52:23.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:52:23.700 --> 3:52:30.700]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:52:30.700 --> 3:52:34.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:52:34.700 --> 3:52:41.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:52:41.700 --> 3:52:44.700]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[3:52:44.700 --> 3:52:45.700]  Fabled Enemies.
