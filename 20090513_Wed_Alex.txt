[01:05.940 --> 01:11.580]  released from a lab and I mean every day now I'm seeing top virologists and
[01:11.580 --> 01:17.500]  scientists say this is manufactured as we reported day one when they described
[01:17.500 --> 01:22.460]  the makeup of the virus I'm no virologist I'm no genetic engineer but
[01:22.460 --> 01:27.060]  I've interviewed enough of them to know that you don't have a completely new
[01:27.060 --> 01:34.100]  genetic line with no history no pedigree that'd be like if somebody started
[01:34.100 --> 01:41.060]  showing glow-in-the-dark pink poodles that had three heads you would say that
[01:41.060 --> 01:46.180]  was engineered ladies and gentlemen there's no pedigree there's no natural
[01:46.180 --> 01:51.220]  breeding there's no history of this of this animal by the way I'm not joking
[01:51.220 --> 01:54.220]  they can genetically engineer three-headed glow-in-the-dark pink
[01:54.220 --> 01:59.100]  poodles they do have glow-in-the-dark pink poodles I've seen that in the news for
[01:59.100 --> 02:03.220]  at least 12 years the big genetic engineering firms haven't some little

[02:09.460 --> 02:14.420]  you can actually walk into shops like the movie Blade Runner made in the mid-80s
[02:14.420 --> 02:21.660]  by the mid 90s you could walk into shops just like Blade Runner and buy
[02:21.660 --> 02:26.140]  whatever you want it but you tell the yuppies that they say look that doesn't
[02:26.140 --> 02:30.540]  exist only American Idol exists they can do a search in about five seconds and

[02:48.740 --> 02:53.100]  they've engineered it and the stuff we know about is off the chart crazy can

[08:07.660 --> 08:10.100]  mind
[08:11.100 --> 08:19.380]  I have a million different important things spinning around in my mind and I
[08:19.380 --> 08:26.260]  tend to go from one to the next and not flesh out any one aspect I've been
[08:26.260 --> 08:32.740]  listening to my show as it rebroadcast at night and I know with all of these
[08:32.740 --> 08:37.860]  earthshaking events happening I mean they've got bills introduced openly to
[08:37.860 --> 08:40.980]  implement with the White House chief of staff said where they put you on a list
[08:40.980 --> 08:44.580]  no judge no jury they don't even tell you been put on the list you just find
[08:44.580 --> 08:48.580]  out when you can't buy a firearm we've already documented going back to Bill
[08:48.580 --> 08:54.900]  Clinton and throughout Bush's time all these veterans and people I know try to
[08:54.900 --> 08:59.140]  go buy a gun or when they get a divorce they go ahead and put them on the
[08:59.140 --> 09:04.620]  federal list during the divorce they do or a lot of times when somebody's having
[09:04.620 --> 09:08.620]  a divorce the lawyers tell the woman go ahead and get a restraining order
[09:08.620 --> 09:13.700]  because that lets you take the house while the divorce is happening and it
[09:13.700 --> 09:17.780]  looks good in court and then suddenly you can't buy a gun or they're now
[09:17.780 --> 09:22.380]  digitizing all the psychological files so when you were in high school and you
[09:22.380 --> 09:25.900]  were depressed because you had zits or your girlfriend broke up with you your
[09:25.900 --> 09:32.220]  boyfriend dead you suddenly can't buy a firearm 20 years later it's all
[09:32.220 --> 09:40.300]  happening we've known this was going on and it did come out in 2000 that 86,000
[09:40.300 --> 09:45.020]  veterans that was one of the headlines in the news 86,000 veterans suddenly
[09:45.020 --> 09:48.980]  couldn't own guns because they'd been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress
[09:48.980 --> 09:56.580]  disorder in Korea, Vietnam or Desert Storm 1 and that's just it they just say
[09:56.580 --> 10:01.980]  sorry you can't get off the list under the NICS FBI instant access background
[10:01.980 --> 10:06.260]  check which is really a registration and what type of gun you're getting handgun
[10:06.260 --> 10:11.300]  rifle shotgun but now they just admit that and say yeah we're digitizing all
[10:11.300 --> 10:15.540]  the juvenile files you have a juvenile record no second amendment this is all
[10:15.540 --> 10:23.780]  being announced you had a divorce or you had a domestic disturbance and thank
[10:23.780 --> 10:26.860]  God I don't have one of these but most people I know do I mean neighbors now
[10:26.860 --> 10:31.180]  call the police on you if they hear shouting next door oh my gosh I better
[10:31.180 --> 10:35.300]  get involved in their business and you know call the police the police get
[10:35.300 --> 10:38.860]  federal grants to take somebody to jail so they show up and they've been told
[10:38.860 --> 10:42.300]  by their big city departments you arrest somebody even if nobody's hit the
[10:42.300 --> 10:46.380]  other person even if nothing's broken you go ahead and do it it's all about
[10:46.380 --> 10:50.740]  getting you in the system so they've got the bill introduced where without even
[10:50.740 --> 10:57.020]  having a misdemeanor without even having a psychological designation and I was
[10:57.020 --> 11:00.300]  looking at numbers in some high schools over a third but the average is about
[11:00.300 --> 11:04.220]  20% but in some high schools over a third you know they say oh go to your
[11:04.220 --> 11:07.260]  monthly visit with the counselor the counselor's like are you depressed they
[11:07.260 --> 11:12.180]  have a checklist are you depressed are you angry are you be having anxiety and
[11:12.180 --> 11:16.820]  they go well you you follow any two of these ten things on the checklist you
[11:16.820 --> 11:20.700]  are mentally ill I'm gonna send you to a psychologist I'm recommending and
[11:20.700 --> 11:24.580]  insurance is gonna pay for it and your parents have got insurance and then you
[11:24.580 --> 11:29.620]  get your psychological designation and the sitcoms and dramas on TV you know
[11:29.620 --> 11:35.300]  stylize it like it's cool and you know it's a status you have it's it's it's
[11:35.300 --> 11:39.300]  like you've won a Congressional Medal of Honor you know that you've got a mental
[11:39.300 --> 11:43.820]  illness that they've made up and you know because you're 13 years old you're
[11:43.820 --> 11:47.460]  supposed to be depressed or upset or have all these all this energy and you
[11:47.460 --> 11:50.660]  know to be figuring things out socially and you're supposed to be getting in
[11:50.660 --> 11:55.100]  fistfights and having anxiety about you know the big bully is gonna be waiting
[11:55.100 --> 11:58.740]  for you after school in the walk home you're supposed to go ahead and not
[11:58.740 --> 12:02.220]  cower and beat the daylights out of the bully but instead you hide and get
[12:02.220 --> 12:07.740]  fearful and have anxiety attacks they put you on Prozac or Riddler or both so
[12:07.740 --> 12:12.340]  see I just said that I always want to go to your calls and then I just start
[12:12.340 --> 12:16.340]  thinking about all the hypocrisy and all the out of control corruption and the
[12:16.340 --> 12:21.540]  mind control that's going on in society it makes the headspin every day or two I
[12:21.540 --> 12:26.420]  see an article about police called out for five six seven eight nine ten year
[12:26.420 --> 12:33.620]  olds playing with pink or orange or blue rubber dart guns you know that you
[12:33.620 --> 12:38.700]  did that they buy at 711 that we all begged for his children and the police
[12:38.700 --> 12:42.380]  come and arrest them or the police come and shoot them and it's always the
[12:42.380 --> 12:46.020]  neighbor you know well the gun was bright yellow but I still thought it was
[12:46.020 --> 12:51.740]  probably illegal I mean we're living in a hellish situation I look at the
[12:51.740 --> 12:59.300]  statistics government is a cancer and the public is the problem the public has
[12:59.300 --> 13:03.660]  been raised by this thing generation after generation and now we haven't even
[13:03.660 --> 13:09.300]  begun to go downhill yet this was just the vanguard or the cutting edge of it
[13:09.300 --> 13:16.820]  this was the prelude of the hors d'oeuvre and so I have a bunch of news on
[13:16.820 --> 13:24.940]  that front massive attacks on free speech we're under attack all over the
[13:24.940 --> 13:30.260]  place by the media CNN MSNBC Google YouTube banning our videos shutting them
[13:30.260 --> 13:34.180]  down announcing no bar Google videos period as we told you they were gearing
[13:34.180 --> 13:38.700]  up for now it's been announced people still don't care it's happening they're
[13:38.700 --> 13:43.060]  closing the doors they're locking it down they're moving ahead it's really
[13:43.060 --> 13:52.020]  going on it's really happening in the United States so coming up in an hour
[13:52.020 --> 13:55.980]  and 15 minutes from now we have Paul Joseph Watson coming on to talk about
[13:55.980 --> 14:04.340]  this headline story he wrote and you can link through it all the mainstream news
[14:04.340 --> 14:06.860]  articles that he has linked and the government's own announcements in their
[14:06.860 --> 14:11.820]  own posters and it shows a neighbor with a boat in the yard on a big poster and
[14:11.820 --> 14:15.860]  it says go ahead and report your neighbor if you don't think they have
[14:15.860 --> 14:21.100]  enough money to have a boat or or to dress nice or to smoke cigars so see
[14:21.100 --> 14:28.780]  first the Stasi system is tattle on your Muslim neighbor are they suspicious are
[14:28.780 --> 14:32.500]  they a terrorist and then it's oh by the way tattle on your neighbor did you
[14:32.500 --> 14:36.260]  hear him say something a racial term did you think you said it even if you
[14:36.260 --> 14:39.980]  think you might have heard it over the fence call the police and we'll start
[14:39.980 --> 14:43.860]  surveilling them and we'll pay you we'll give you recording devices to sit there
[14:43.860 --> 14:51.060]  and and record them this is in the news and then by the way we want you to be
[14:51.060 --> 14:55.100]  neighborhood volunteers to dig through your neighbor's rubbish and make sure
[14:55.100 --> 14:58.980]  they're recycling properly all over Europe and in in England now it's being
[14:58.980 --> 15:02.660]  implemented here everything in Europe is about two three years ahead of us
[15:02.660 --> 15:08.100]  well this time police encourage citizens to report people who drive nice cars
[15:08.100 --> 15:13.380]  prisonplanet.com and there's images of the UK police commissioners and others
[15:13.380 --> 15:20.140]  up there and it says too much bling and it shows a guy in a suit with a cigar
[15:20.140 --> 15:27.340]  and it says too much bling give us a ring now they have big posters up all over
[15:27.340 --> 15:33.580]  England that show an all-seeing eye and it says you were all safe under the
[15:33.580 --> 15:42.300]  watchful eye I mean they are coming right out and saying all over US British
[15:42.300 --> 15:46.740]  European news that big brother is now good they're now saying the term big
[15:46.740 --> 15:51.020]  brother's helping that you can search it in the term big brother helping and
[15:51.020 --> 15:54.060]  you'll get tens of thousands of news articles because that's a talking point
[15:54.060 --> 16:01.460]  about big brother helping big brother big brother I mean it is everywhere
[16:03.620 --> 16:08.980]  police encourage citizens to report people who drive nice cars and they
[16:08.980 --> 16:12.420]  know it's asinine they've got the Scotland Yard police commissioner up
[16:12.420 --> 16:17.140]  there smiling like it's a big joke and they're saying if you criticize immigrants
[16:17.140 --> 16:21.420]  arrested if you criticize immigrants outside of England you can't come to
[16:21.420 --> 16:27.500]  England but when nobody's pointing out except Paul Watson in any article I've

[26:12.860 --> 26:16.380]  ago and thousands of years ago that there was a symbol of being a free man
[26:16.380 --> 26:19.980]  that's what the state and nobility was all about is you had the right to have
[26:19.980 --> 26:24.340]  arms and to use force that's why the UN says that the state is the only
[26:24.340 --> 26:29.140]  legitimate holder of any type of small arms no citizens are allowed to own
[26:29.140 --> 26:32.740]  guns that's public UN policy and the United States are signatories to the
[26:32.740 --> 26:36.300]  UNESCO treaty and the Unidire Treaty and they're now trying to ratify it

[28:09.940 --> 28:13.780]  Dr. Corsi writing about it but then I got in the mail because I have employees
[28:13.780 --> 28:16.820]  and it said the Texas Workforce Commission is no longer under the
[28:16.820 --> 28:21.140]  Department of Labor with the feds states totally federalized you now report all
[28:21.140 --> 28:26.940]  this tax data and workers comp data to the North American Union and it gave me

[34:08.780 --> 34:14.300]  our military dumb animals to be used by the New World Order and I don't think
[34:14.300 --> 34:20.660]  you're dumb animals but I mean it is kind of he is making a point that he can
[34:20.660 --> 34:26.340]  write that and he knows you're not gonna read it or even if you do your mind
[34:26.340 --> 34:32.260]  control is so strong you're still gonna follow the globalist orders even though
[34:32.260 --> 34:41.660]  they're calling you dumb animals to be used so we just talked to Jim Tucker he
[34:41.660 --> 34:48.060]  was mobbed by reporters he just he flew out yesterday evening after his
[34:48.060 --> 34:54.380]  connecting flights he just got into Greece a few hours ago he is mobbed by
[34:54.380 --> 34:59.020]  reporters we called his room we were scheduled to check in with him at 11
[34:59.020 --> 35:02.940]  he wasn't the room we call the front desk we go we need mr. Tucker and the
[35:02.940 --> 35:07.220]  lady said oh he's him he's mobbed so there's a mob mob scene of international
[35:07.220 --> 35:11.260]  media now imagine 30 years ago 34 years ago they would say that didn't exist he
[35:11.260 --> 35:15.620]  was insane 20 years ago they'd say it 10 years ago now he's mobbed by
[35:15.620 --> 35:22.580]  international TV radio and print just he said it's a mob scene he'll be joining
[35:22.580 --> 35:27.420]  us tomorrow at the start of the second hour for just 10 15 minutes and then
[35:27.420 --> 35:31.420]  again on Friday with a report and then when he gets back next week we'll have a
[35:31.420 --> 35:34.820]  detailed 30 minute report with Jim Tucker and in all ways again the key
[35:34.820 --> 35:38.700]  news gets broken right here there'll be reports at info wars.com and prison
[35:38.700 --> 35:41.900]  planet.com because Daniel Estalon has great contacts inside
[35:41.900 --> 35:46.860]  Bilderberg but Jim Tucker really has the strong contacts and he's gonna be on
[35:46.860 --> 35:56.180]  with us. Estalon's been out of the loop lately because his wife's mother was
[35:56.180 --> 36:00.980]  dying of cancer and then he just had twins so but I think he reportedly may
[36:00.980 --> 36:07.660]  be going to Bilderberg this year I don't know but Tucker is on the job ladies
[36:07.660 --> 36:13.140]  and gentlemen no doubt with a carton of cigarettes under each arm so what what
[36:13.140 --> 36:19.220]  what a character and you can always sit you're watching warrant by what he has
[36:19.220 --> 36:23.100]  to say never any embellishment never any I mean this is directly from
[36:23.100 --> 36:27.700]  Bilderberg and I should have gone over to Greece it's gonna be a three-ring
[36:27.700 --> 36:34.500]  circus I tell you and then what we find out out of these meetings always comes
[36:34.500 --> 36:38.820]  true you know we can come on air I kept hyperventilating over Lindsay
[36:38.820 --> 36:42.180]  Williams and he's a great guy but you know he did work for one of the big
[36:42.180 --> 36:46.020]  oil companies he has broken insider knowledge before he has exposed that
[36:46.020 --> 36:53.660]  peak oil is a fraud and Lindsay Williams comes out month and a half after we
[36:53.660 --> 37:02.540]  broke it here and says they're gonna drop the price of oil by at least half he
[37:02.540 --> 37:06.780]  said below 50 we said by half and where did that come from Jim Tucker and
[37:06.780 --> 37:11.020]  Bilderberg contacts at Chantilly, Virginia where I was with him last year
[37:11.020 --> 37:15.740]  and then I forget we broke that and all those predictions came through man I
[37:15.740 --> 37:21.260]  need Paul Watson Kurt Nemo Aaron Dykes or maybe our volunteers maybe listeners
[37:21.260 --> 37:25.660]  because the media and the public pay attention to this we don't ever really
[37:25.660 --> 37:35.860]  toot our horns properly I need the listeners to go back through the March
[37:35.860 --> 37:41.340]  5th show where I broke down and said they're gonna launch some type of bird
[37:41.340 --> 37:44.540]  or swine flu genetically engineered attack this will probably just be a
[37:44.540 --> 37:49.460]  drill to infect people and scare people for a future attack I'm telling you I
[37:49.460 --> 37:54.820]  see they're pre-programming they're gonna launch some type of flu I mean I
[37:54.820 --> 38:00.900]  laid it out and then directly from Bilderberg that they were gonna slash oil
[38:00.900 --> 38:10.780]  prices to bankrupt Venezuela Iran Saudi Arabia Russia and others off the 150
[38:10.780 --> 38:14.580]  dollars a barrel they were getting for crude oil and then it's a big
[38:14.580 --> 38:18.940]  international sensation that Lindsay Williams predicts it and then Jim was
[38:18.940 --> 38:25.500]  Jim Tucker and he didn't predict it it came directly from Bilderberg and I
[38:25.500 --> 38:29.740]  told Paul Watson last week when listeners pointed this out that we had
[38:29.740 --> 38:34.500]  predicted it I told him to do a story about it tooting our horn he didn't do
[38:34.500 --> 38:39.820]  it and I'm telling you it's important we do that because folks need to know what
[38:39.820 --> 38:43.340]  you hear on this show is what the globalist agenda is we eat drink and
[38:43.340 --> 38:48.340]  sleep this we crawl around in ditches we get arrested we get detained we get
[38:48.340 --> 38:53.780]  death-threaded we get sued we fight hard to bring you this information and I
[38:53.780 --> 38:59.020]  sure hope it's appreciated and I sure hope our track record is appreciated and
[38:59.020 --> 39:03.940]  and again not in an ego way in a this is key information people better pay
[39:03.940 --> 39:09.780]  attention to I mean I told you they were gonna blow up the world trade centers
[39:09.780 --> 39:15.140]  and blaming on Osama bin Laden months and months before 9-11 I mean I was
[39:15.140 --> 39:19.020]  saying that for six months before 9-11 I've got to dig out all those old TV
[39:19.020 --> 39:22.540]  shows the one that ended up getting put on the web was Eli 25th and that was
[39:22.540 --> 39:25.940]  when I came out and said
[39:28.660 --> 39:33.340]  call the White House tell them don't stage the attacks but for months and
[39:33.340 --> 39:36.820]  months before that and I'm gonna dig that out I got storage buildings full of
[39:36.820 --> 39:39.620]  three-quarter inch tapes and stuff before they all rot they're probably
[39:39.620 --> 39:44.820]  already rotten I need to get that out because it's important to show we've
[39:44.820 --> 39:49.140]  been right all along it's important to show we know what we're talking about
[39:49.140 --> 39:53.380]  this is important information and people are beginning to heat it they aren't
[39:53.380 --> 39:57.380]  beginning to add to it and do their own research and we are beginning to have a
[39:57.380 --> 40:01.060]  big effect on the globalist I mean they have violent radicalization act
[40:01.060 --> 40:04.020]  hearings in Congress saying they've got to restrict the web and they've got to
[40:04.020 --> 40:07.020]  go up to 9-11 truth because we're hurting them and they have high-level
[40:07.020 --> 40:11.900]  members the 9-11 Commission come out and say they did a deal with the Pentagon
[40:11.900 --> 40:19.140]  tell to lie about the Pentagon standing down on that day and then we write a
[40:19.140 --> 40:29.020]  story about it at prisonplanet.com and nobody else picks it up I mean I we are
[40:29.020 --> 40:34.020]  so busy fighting the new world order and firing down range that we don't even
[40:34.020 --> 40:36.580]  have time to report to you the type of damage we're doing to the new world
[40:36.580 --> 40:39.820]  order you're like why is it important to report that because it proves we're
[40:39.820 --> 40:43.980]  shooting down range in the right angle in the right direction we're having an
[40:43.980 --> 40:47.820]  effect we need more of you to belly up next to us and open fire on the enemy
[40:47.820 --> 40:53.780]  these are criminals openly hijacking the nation stealing 14.8 trillion in seven
[40:53.780 --> 41:00.540]  months they're going for broke there's no time to suck thumbs and play games we
[41:00.540 --> 41:03.700]  got to get into there the breach where they blown holes in our wall where the
[41:03.700 --> 41:09.460]  enemy's coming in like a flood here this is the coup in motion right now the new
[41:09.460 --> 41:14.660]  world order corporate private fraudulent takeover is illegitimate in rogue and we
[41:14.660 --> 41:20.620]  got to blow the trumpet and pointed out to people and government everywhere is
[41:20.620 --> 41:23.700]  getting more corrupt by the minute because the words gone out go wild have
[41:23.700 --> 41:26.580]  an orgy of corruption do it everyone okay I'm going to your calls Robin
[41:26.580 --> 41:30.700]  Canada finish up your point yeah I just wanted to that these people really can
[41:30.700 --> 41:38.580]  be toppled and those of in David Ike's 9-11 book he gives an example of a
[41:38.580 --> 41:43.700]  play and at the end of the play all the members of the on the stage they create
[41:43.700 --> 41:49.100]  a pyramid and the guy at the bottom he has to sneeze and the guy at the top
[41:49.100 --> 41:54.380]  topples and ends up in the second row and that's exactly what this is all of
[41:54.380 --> 41:57.940]  us at the bottom we're holding those people up at the top and they can
[41:57.940 --> 42:02.180]  topple that's right you're the turtle yeah I appreciate your call in fact I

[42:24.700 --> 42:29.620]  saw Obama talking about the new health care reform thing and he's talking about
[42:29.620 --> 42:33.860]  how the doctors and hospitals and everybody else had picked a bad business
[42:33.860 --> 42:38.140]  plan but not the pharmaceutical companies and the outrageous prices they
[42:38.140 --> 42:42.860]  charge for their product yeah they have they have corporatized health care and
[42:42.860 --> 42:46.620]  socialize it for the public to conduit all the profits to themselves it's
[42:46.620 --> 42:51.420]  eugenics death care and now they're going to expand that model and they are
[42:51.420 --> 42:54.900]  putting in the computer systems nationwide under federal law telling
[42:54.900 --> 43:02.020]  dentists doctors nurses what they can do a pre set up system to the national
[43:02.020 --> 43:05.820]  health care will be an aspirin for a heart attack it'll be a band-aid for a
[43:05.820 --> 43:10.940]  severed leg and and that's their system and they admit I've got Tony Blair on
[43:10.940 --> 43:15.700]  tape 18 months for terminal brain cancer that's operable but you got to have it
[43:15.700 --> 43:19.740]  in a month they say die Tom Daschle wrote the book and he was gonna be the
[43:19.740 --> 43:23.860]  head of health care saying you should you need to just die it is your carbon

[44:41.020 --> 44:44.820]  thought this is for everybody out there you know listening right now you know
[44:44.820 --> 44:48.500]  people always say why does somebody need 20 guns in their house why does
[44:48.500 --> 44:54.780]  somebody need 50 guns in their house to hand out 49 that's why to hand out 49
[44:54.780 --> 44:59.260]  hey I hear you and I promise go ahead you with that I just want to leave you
[44:59.260 --> 45:03.340]  with that and tell you just before ink before I go in case they shut all this
[45:03.340 --> 45:07.980]  down before I talk to you next time brother I love you right my heart I
[45:07.980 --> 45:13.460]  think about you every day I'm spreading as much as I can within my social
[45:13.460 --> 45:17.180]  circle and I pray that two five years down the road we can still have these
[45:17.180 --> 45:21.020]  conversations God bless you oh yeah that's definitely in peril that is
[45:21.020 --> 45:28.500]  definitely you know definitely something we got to think about I love all you
[45:28.500 --> 45:33.540]  guys to you know I can feel your prayers I can feel your love and it's it's it
[45:33.540 --> 45:39.220]  overshadows and dominates the hate I feel I can feel that to a disturbance in
[45:39.220 --> 45:43.940]  the force the last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master let's go
[45:43.940 --> 45:47.820]  ahead and talk to oh just briefly on the subject of the second member I wanted to
[45:47.820 --> 45:52.380]  add that point but I'm gonna interrupt him to always interrupt folks and I'm
[45:52.380 --> 45:54.740]  getting a little bit better because I want to make a point I think of and then
[45:54.740 --> 45:59.620]  I forget about it a minute later but I'm getting better about waiting yeah no
[45:59.620 --> 46:04.780]  the reason to have 49 guns is because it's your right that's why I mean you
[46:04.780 --> 46:08.740]  know one gun two guns ten guns they're now all over the nation every couple
[46:08.740 --> 46:13.660]  days in fact I just saw an article about that right now it says police see
[46:13.660 --> 46:18.140]  semi-automatic weapons as hazard they can kill for more than four football fields
[46:18.140 --> 46:30.820]  away shred police officers vest fire up to 75 bullets at a time and they're
[46:30.820 --> 46:34.180]  increasingly showing up in criminal hands so there's the demonization
[46:34.180 --> 46:39.460]  headline out of the news Sentinel last year Fort Wayne police see 31 semi-automatic
[46:39.460 --> 46:44.460]  rifles compared to just two in 2003 last year of the federal solubents ban that
[46:44.460 --> 46:48.140]  limited to sell the rifles the seizure increases and more reports of criminals
[46:48.140 --> 46:52.540]  using the rifles concerns Fort Wayne police chief rusty York see how that
[46:52.540 --> 46:58.420]  article is written deceptively to imply they're illegal you know they say oh
[46:58.420 --> 47:01.420]  these were banned until this point but the police are seizing them because
[47:01.420 --> 47:06.940]  they're so deadly and so it's just like the billboards with an image of a gun and
[47:06.940 --> 47:12.540]  it says report illegal firearms and it's an it's a revolver only illegal in
[47:12.540 --> 47:19.300]  Chicago DC and New York and then you see the dramas and sitcoms where they say
[47:19.300 --> 47:24.140]  oh he's got a handgun call the police I mean how many sitcoms are there where
[47:24.140 --> 47:26.780]  somebody walks in a house and the good-looking girl you know likes the
[47:26.780 --> 47:31.220]  guy he's finally got a great date with this you know number 10 Fox and he takes
[47:31.220 --> 47:34.700]  her into his apartment and she sees a gun case she goes I'm leaving I'm not
[47:34.700 --> 47:39.100]  white guns but then she goes out and loves a cop who's got a gun and that's
[47:39.100 --> 47:42.940]  meant for weak-minded males who haven't gotten a mate yet and feeling
[47:42.940 --> 47:47.340]  adequate that they watch that and go God guns aren't cool and then weak-minded
[47:47.340 --> 47:52.100]  women think ooh the Foxy cool chick I want to be she's anti-gun I mean do you
[47:52.100 --> 47:58.220]  like being programmed like that that is an insult to your intelligence it's so
[47:58.220 --> 48:04.540]  base my wife watches TV maybe once every couple days and she says every show she
[48:04.540 --> 48:09.340]  tries to watch it doesn't matter it's anti-homeschool anti-gun pro-abortion
[48:09.340 --> 48:14.860]  pro eugenics pro euthanasia it's everything all it is his brainwashing
[48:14.860 --> 48:20.580]  with social engineering using peer pressure in imaginary fictitious
[48:20.580 --> 48:24.900]  situations to to to make you feel inadequate and bad and like you'll be
[48:24.900 --> 48:29.780]  uncool but I'll tell you it didn't work on a lot of people their propaganda is
[48:29.780 --> 48:36.380]  working less and less now I've probably bought 50 guns over the years since I
[48:36.380 --> 48:41.540]  turned 18 started buying guns one time I had a bunch in a farmhouse at family
[48:41.540 --> 48:45.020]  owned it got struck by lightning and like I think 12 guns burned up they're
[48:45.020 --> 48:50.420]  pretty weird-looking all melted but I probably got 30 40 guns and I see news
[48:50.420 --> 48:54.860]  all the time where the neighbors saw him in his garage cleaning guns and thought
[48:54.860 --> 49:00.580]  it was threatening police went ahead and arrested the veteran and he had 24 guns
[49:00.580 --> 49:03.820]  and over a thousand rounds of ammo and they'll have people in the news going it
[49:03.820 --> 49:08.300]  was scary at firearms and it'll be a I'll check that states laws where it
[49:08.300 --> 49:12.220]  happened and then it's not illegal and it's like he's arrested and they're
[49:12.220 --> 49:16.700]  like yes we're charging him I mean ladies and charging him with what that's
[49:16.700 --> 49:24.020]  what I mean it's crazy by the way guns are some of the best investments out
[49:24.020 --> 49:33.460]  there I mean I bought rifles I bought a mini 14 for like 250 bucks it had to be
[49:33.460 --> 49:42.620]  on 1992 1993 and that sucker that model is worth about $600 a day
[49:42.620 --> 49:52.100]  Ruger range rifle I mean I've got every gun I've got is is is valuable you know

[54:16.740 --> 54:23.540]  articles London Guardian with a ridiculous headline our man at
[54:23.540 --> 54:28.820]  Bilderberg in pursuit of the world's most powerful cabal once a year it is
[54:28.820 --> 54:34.620]  rumored the global elite gathered a luxury hotel it is rumored I mean it's
[54:34.620 --> 54:39.180]  been in the BBC everywhere that the Bilderberg groups now released some of
[54:39.180 --> 54:43.620]  their founding documents bragging they set up the European Union by stealth so
[54:43.620 --> 54:52.380]  this group openly admits they exist now London Guardian says it's rumored I
[54:52.380 --> 54:58.100]  remember up until five years ago Limbaugh was still saying the CFR didn't exist
[54:58.100 --> 55:04.620]  and that's his job gotta keep your friends close your enemies closer and
[55:04.620 --> 55:08.140]  the new world order hates real conservatives hates constitutionalists
[55:08.140 --> 55:12.420]  and nationalists so they're gonna have a bunch of fake conservatives up there to
[55:12.420 --> 55:16.500]  sell people much of other news articles on that front let's go back to your
[55:16.500 --> 55:22.980]  calls here Paul in Florida welcome hi Alex just as you say as you're in your
[55:22.980 --> 55:27.660]  opening remarks it's very easy today for anyone to lose their second amendment
[55:27.660 --> 55:32.660]  rights it was it's been done to what people we know a group of people who
[55:32.660 --> 55:35.780]  got hold of my yes soon to be hundred-year-old father did it to me a
[55:35.780 --> 55:40.260]  few years ago they didn't prevail they made up they used lies they walked in a
[55:40.260 --> 55:44.580]  court tearfully saying I did previously injured my dad now the reason they did
[55:44.580 --> 55:49.420]  this is because we didn't know it but apparently my dad's a wealthy man and
[55:49.420 --> 55:54.300]  they stole millions from him and when we got wind of it that annoyed them and so
[55:54.300 --> 55:59.420]  they did just what senator Lautenberg and all his fellow gun haters and tyranny
[55:59.420 --> 56:04.340]  lovers want to do they use lies to disarm law-abiding citizens unfortunately
[56:04.340 --> 56:08.980]  they pushed it too far they spread some money around to try and make it stick it
[56:08.980 --> 56:14.300]  did not and now the legal consequences are going to return for them because yes
[56:14.300 --> 56:18.340]  America there are still many fine good cops and law enforcement people in this
[56:18.340 --> 56:21.220]  country and they don't like liars and they don't like gun haters and they
[56:21.220 --> 56:25.420]  don't like punks the deputies around here be the first ones to tell you they
[56:25.420 --> 56:29.020]  hate it when somebody's gun rights are violated this brings me to another point
[56:29.020 --> 56:36.020]  you mentioned in your opening remarks that odd May December romance of David
[56:36.020 --> 56:40.220]  Rockefeller and Hank Kissinger and there's a little drama going on in
[56:40.220 --> 56:45.820]  New York City and it has very big ramifications there's a fellow named
[56:45.820 --> 56:51.100]  Philip Marshall he's eighty four years old so far only seen this in the New York
[56:51.100 --> 56:57.420]  Post and the New York Daily News Mr. Marshall is the son of Mrs. Astor of
[56:57.420 --> 57:01.220]  the Astor as you know who drowned on the Titanic and all that and she gave away
[57:01.220 --> 57:05.140]  hundreds of millions he locked her up and won't even give her clothes I remember
[57:05.140 --> 57:09.740]  seeing it well this is what happened here is that that's how the charities so
[57:09.740 --> 57:13.660]  called now these aren't charities that feed you're saying that's made up and
[57:13.660 --> 57:16.740]  you have it's in the New York Times probably is a lot he's prevailed they
[57:16.740 --> 57:21.540]  tried so in the estate and they lost he prevailed these aren't charities you
[57:21.540 --> 57:24.980]  know that that feed hungry people or shelter starving you know shelter
[57:24.980 --> 57:29.180]  kittens or anything like that this is like the Hank Kissinger of Rockefeller
[57:29.180 --> 57:33.980]  this well set the ones who live very very big off and this is my dad's a
[57:33.980 --> 57:37.780]  dentist so he has a lot of patience and more and more well-to-do people are
[57:37.780 --> 57:42.860]  saying the state elder care is seizing their eighty five ninety year old
[57:42.860 --> 57:46.580]  parents every time they have money and then you're trying to trying to sign it
[57:46.580 --> 57:50.460]  over to themselves and that's all over the news that elder care people in the
[57:50.460 --> 57:56.020]  UK and the US and Canada are now moving into their houses yes and in addition to

[1:00:56.020 --> 1:01:01.260]  for that but going back to Paul in Florida so Paul yeah I mean I remember
[1:01:01.260 --> 1:01:06.020]  reading the articles about Lady Astor and how the charities with David Rocken
[1:01:06.020 --> 1:01:10.140]  Feller and Kissinger wanted to make sure the billions went to the charities and
[1:01:10.140 --> 1:01:16.100]  not the evil son and then I saw that a year or two ago in the news how did all
[1:01:16.100 --> 1:01:23.580]  this end up what happened what happened was that Mr. Marshall Mrs. Astor's son
[1:01:23.580 --> 1:01:27.340]  prevailed in these people civilly from the sound of it because Mrs. Astor's
[1:01:27.340 --> 1:01:32.700]  still gave plenty to charity but and Mr. Astor Mr. Marshall rather her son
[1:01:32.700 --> 1:01:37.380]  received a good inheritance but the charities and again these are not
[1:01:37.380 --> 1:01:42.180]  charities that feed starving people that shelter injured animals these are
[1:01:42.180 --> 1:01:46.440]  people that buy buy million-dollar pictures for ten million dollars and
[1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:50.140]  heaven knows where the money goes there's a lot of skull-duggery here these
[1:01:50.140 --> 1:01:54.060]  charities lived very large off Mrs. Astor and they want to continue doing it
[1:01:54.060 --> 1:01:57.540]  they apparently didn't prevail if the what if they contested the will they
[1:01:57.540 --> 1:02:02.180]  didn't prevail so what they did Henry Kissinger and and from the looks of it
[1:02:02.180 --> 1:02:05.500]  Rockefeller got together with their friends in the New York DA's office and
[1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:10.300]  filed criminal charges of grand theft among other among other serious charges
[1:02:10.300 --> 1:02:16.500]  against Mr. Marshall who's 84 claiming that he abused his mother and tricked her
[1:02:16.500 --> 1:02:20.500]  in her in her diminished state to was signing a more and more money over to
[1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:24.340]  him now this is exactly what criminals do as any cop will tell you they
[1:02:24.340 --> 1:02:28.540]  immediately spin things all around they make it the cops fault if you catch a
[1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:31.740]  criminal doing a bad thing they immediately say oh no it was Alex's
[1:02:31.740 --> 1:02:35.860]  fault it was Paul's fault that's what criminals do they spun this right around
[1:02:35.860 --> 1:02:39.500]  on Marshall the trial is still going on in New York and the truck and the New
[1:02:39.500 --> 1:02:43.220]  York Post and Daily News are still covering this regularly a lot of
[1:02:43.220 --> 1:02:47.220]  bloggers are posting in the truth on this in the comments section one thing
[1:02:47.220 --> 1:02:54.220]  they zeroed in on is that one person who got herself appointed over Guardian
[1:02:54.220 --> 1:03:00.460]  over Mrs. Astor claims that Mrs. here's her logic Mrs. Astor handed her a
[1:03:00.460 --> 1:03:05.260]  necklace worth it probably a hundred thousand dollars and when Mrs. Astor
[1:03:05.260 --> 1:03:09.300]  did that she was in her right mind and that was her absolute right to do it
[1:03:09.300 --> 1:03:13.500]  because she didn't want that evil bad son of hers and his greedy wife to get
[1:03:13.500 --> 1:03:19.660]  her money but when the son received something according to this witness for
[1:03:19.660 --> 1:03:23.780]  the prosecution all well then he was bad that's when Mrs. Astor was not in her
[1:03:23.780 --> 1:03:28.740]  right mind you see how clever they play it the problem is too clever by half
[1:03:28.740 --> 1:03:33.140]  doesn't play with the American citizens who can tell shine over from its cheap
[1:03:33.140 --> 1:03:38.220]  substitute and and we've been see the problem here so he's one in court as I
[1:03:38.220 --> 1:03:42.060]  haven't followed it since I saw it was so far all the evidence against him
[1:03:42.060 --> 1:03:47.460]  Alex in court is just it's hearsay it's triple hearsay it's people who have who
[1:03:47.460 --> 1:03:52.740]  are who are laymen giving their diagnoses of Mr. at Mrs. Astor's
[1:03:52.740 --> 1:03:57.060]  mental stable that's fine and Danny but it doesn't count for anything because
[1:03:57.060 --> 1:04:00.500]  they're laymen they have no test results they have no degrees or they never
[1:04:00.500 --> 1:04:05.780]  examined her it's it's fallacious well Mr. Astor saw this coming a few years
[1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:11.500]  ago and he himself asked in a Forbes magazine interview in 2006 excuse me
[1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:17.220]  mr. Marshall this was asked your son Anthony Marshall he asked who is giving
[1:04:17.220 --> 1:04:21.220]  the orders I mean he was that specific now this man is being portrayed as a
[1:04:21.220 --> 1:04:25.740]  ne'er to well in a slouch this man was a diplomat he's a Broadway producer he's
[1:04:25.740 --> 1:04:30.620]  a wealthy successful man in his own right but remember these charities the
[1:04:30.620 --> 1:04:35.940]  elites the globalists want every penny from mr. mr. a Marshall they want to
[1:04:35.940 --> 1:04:39.660]  strip him of his liberty and throw him in a prison cell to bury both him and
[1:04:39.660 --> 1:04:44.220]  his side of the story and as mr. Marshall said in the Forbes article and he
[1:04:44.220 --> 1:04:47.500]  asked who's behind this he said it's kissing you're giving the orders is
[1:04:47.500 --> 1:04:52.300]  Rockefeller behind this attack on him he said this does not bode well for
[1:04:52.300 --> 1:04:56.740]  anybody because that was actually in the news that was actually in the news that
[1:04:56.740 --> 1:05:02.620]  Rockefeller and Kissinger helping her Alex Jones here with a question what
[1:05:02.620 --> 1:05:07.060]  does humidity mean to you most people think of hot and sticky summer days but
[1:05:07.060 --> 1:05:10.740]  many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of

[1:07:09.980 --> 1:07:14.700]  depression over 18 million people suffered from starvation and as America
[1:07:14.700 --> 1:07:18.740]  continues down its current path for many the reality of another depression is a

[1:08:06.220 --> 1:08:13.820]  radio network more and more across the world of the 50% inheritance taxes
[1:08:13.820 --> 1:08:19.380]  enough for the state they have sent the state and they have they seized the old
[1:08:19.380 --> 1:08:23.820]  folks taken hold of the facility so they sign everything over the state and it's
[1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:28.340]  so corrupt the bureaucrats then actually take the jewelry the homes for themselves
[1:08:28.340 --> 1:08:33.740]  publicly I mean that's how evil the government is and so yes I was aware
[1:08:33.740 --> 1:08:37.020]  now that we've gotten not sidetracked because that's what I love about calls
[1:08:37.020 --> 1:08:39.420]  they take us in all different directions we're gonna finish up with Paul then go
[1:08:39.420 --> 1:08:42.940]  to Annie JD Gavin Sam and many others then I'm gonna tell you about the big
[1:08:42.940 --> 1:08:48.100]  news stories they're coming up today and the three guests we've got coming on we
[1:08:48.100 --> 1:08:54.100]  got some financial news coming up in a moment as well but Paul you call in and
[1:08:54.100 --> 1:09:00.020]  talk about how the group of people tried to take your father's wealth and tried
[1:09:00.020 --> 1:09:04.220]  to go after you and tried to get your second amendment revoked claiming you
[1:09:04.220 --> 1:09:08.100]  were a threat they always do this to this so they can then go into court and
[1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:12.540]  say he's had a restraining order podium as well because I feel threatened but you
[1:09:12.540 --> 1:09:17.140]  were finishing up with Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller helping you know
[1:09:17.140 --> 1:09:21.460]  make sure that that's that all the money of Lady Astor goes to you know
[1:09:21.460 --> 1:09:25.620]  basically their charities which are tax-free foundations and like you said
[1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:29.900]  they it's been documented they use art sales you know ten million dollars for a
[1:09:29.900 --> 1:09:33.660]  painting worth ten dollars that they then buy from their friends is all part of
[1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:36.780]  the money laundering operation but I finish up the statements you were
[1:09:36.780 --> 1:09:41.300]  making the most important thing that Anthony Marshall said about this is what
[1:09:41.300 --> 1:09:45.500]  it portends for us now this is a wealthy man but it doesn't matter how much we
[1:09:45.500 --> 1:09:49.060]  have ten million dollars or a box of corn flakes mr. Marshall said if these
[1:09:49.060 --> 1:09:54.980]  people prevail by using the state force against him to take every last penny he
[1:09:54.980 --> 1:09:58.620]  has and put him in prison for doing nothing other than being the son of a
[1:09:58.620 --> 1:10:03.460]  wealthy lady said they can do this to you to me to everybody in other words it
[1:10:03.460 --> 1:10:09.020]  means the day is not far off when state goons and the greedy guts who instigate
[1:10:09.020 --> 1:10:13.340]  them can march into our homes and look around at our possessions accuse us of
[1:10:13.340 --> 1:10:17.380]  having taken those possessions by force or trick from our relatives our
[1:10:17.380 --> 1:10:23.500]  families and appropriate them and then put us through the courts of railroad
[1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:27.180]  us through into criminal courts and then you know privatized prisons because
[1:10:27.180 --> 1:10:31.820]  after all we stole from our poor dear parents meanwhile these people walk off
[1:10:31.820 --> 1:10:35.620]  with everything we have and we lose our liberty and the ability to tell our
[1:10:35.620 --> 1:10:40.740]  story I guess they thought we would just sit back Alex and let that happen why
[1:10:40.740 --> 1:10:44.380]  are they but with what do they do with these elites they do they breathe the
[1:10:44.380 --> 1:10:48.700]  brains out or something well you're saying I'm right I was talking to you
[1:10:48.700 --> 1:10:52.260]  during the break that's a great idea for me to have Anthony Marshall on the show
[1:10:52.260 --> 1:10:57.340]  son of the lady asked her heir to that fortune I'm on one of the sub-airs is
[1:10:57.340 --> 1:11:03.700]  CIA agent it messes an agent Anderson Cooper up there on CNN but specifically
[1:11:03.700 --> 1:11:07.180]  with you you were saying it's a playbook and you're right all these scams are
[1:11:07.180 --> 1:11:11.380]  literal playbooks they've they've even found you know little playbooks that
[1:11:11.380 --> 1:11:14.900]  different crime syndicates use how did they go after you trying to steal your
[1:11:14.900 --> 1:11:21.340]  dad's money about 30 they started years ago very slowly and slyly you know as
[1:11:21.340 --> 1:11:24.900]  fathers and sons live in different places when you grow up and move out and
[1:11:24.900 --> 1:11:29.620]  when the when I wasn't around they would call him they would move in on them
[1:11:29.620 --> 1:11:33.820]  they'd come to visit now they wouldn't give anything these people with them the
[1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:37.420]  meter only flows in one direction to them and away from the person they
[1:11:37.420 --> 1:11:41.700]  targeted when you get someone elderly especially as they become but let's say
[1:11:41.700 --> 1:11:45.540]  in their 70s 80s they can become suggestible they can become fearful and
[1:11:45.540 --> 1:11:49.860]  if you have like mr. Rockefeller and and mr. Kissinger here in this trial if
[1:11:49.860 --> 1:11:55.500]  you have a nice protector who'll protect you what they do and this is I talked
[1:11:55.500 --> 1:11:58.900]  to the state police major about this about a while back and he said oh this
[1:11:58.900 --> 1:12:03.380]  is the old story they always get the elderly people to turn against their
[1:12:03.380 --> 1:12:08.860]  sons and daughters and welcome in all these obvious criminals and he said it
[1:12:08.860 --> 1:12:13.180]  can go on for years sometimes they can prevail the only hope is if the sons and
[1:12:13.180 --> 1:12:17.300]  daughters catch them and dig in and fight and you cover yourself you know
[1:12:17.300 --> 1:12:21.660]  you keep track of where you are so that if they make a false accusation against
[1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:25.580]  you it'll be just that you can always account for your whereabouts let me just
[1:12:25.580 --> 1:12:29.700]  tell you this I happen to know a lot of old folks in fact I don't want to embarrass
[1:12:29.700 --> 1:12:36.820]  family but let's just say family I have yeah I'll just say an uncle's I have an
[1:12:36.820 --> 1:12:42.140]  uncle whose wife's mother had like a half million dollars you know that she'd
[1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:45.860]  saved up middle-class married to a general in the military you know family
[1:12:45.860 --> 1:12:49.540]  and the Republican Party she gave a little bit of money the Republican Party
[1:12:49.540 --> 1:12:54.900]  they called her hounded her visited her until they sucked every dime out of her
[1:12:54.900 --> 1:12:58.780]  bank account and that's what they do I mean it's even they even do it with these
[1:12:58.780 --> 1:13:03.100]  telemarketers out you're right on the money they want every last penny they
[1:13:03.100 --> 1:13:07.020]  don't want 40 percent or even 85 percent they want a hundred and eighty percent of
[1:13:07.020 --> 1:13:11.740]  everything and then your liberty to make sure you don't talk well I mean it's a
[1:13:11.740 --> 1:13:14.700]  lot smart themselves and there's only one way to do it the way they did to me
[1:13:14.700 --> 1:13:18.820]  they there it's still going on but they they may well be facing some legal
[1:13:18.820 --> 1:13:22.180]  consequences in the future it's out of our hands at this point it's as
[1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:25.540]  somebody has taken an interest in it thank goodness but they do it the same
[1:13:25.540 --> 1:13:29.980]  way they turn up they turn at the elderly parents against their legitimate
[1:13:29.980 --> 1:13:33.500]  offspring their sons and daughters this is what criminals do and that's what they
[1:13:33.500 --> 1:13:34.140]  do
[1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:38.020]  there's a great website stop guardianship abuse dot com which has a lot of
[1:13:38.020 --> 1:13:42.940]  information on this their initials are n-a-s-g-a naska and there's many other
[1:13:42.940 --> 1:13:47.020]  many sites is a lot of information on the net it's like baseball there's only one
[1:13:47.020 --> 1:13:50.420]  way they can do it doesn't matter whether they're after a box of cornflakes or ten
[1:13:50.420 --> 1:13:54.260]  million bucks or somebody has a nice old car in the garage and they want that
[1:13:54.260 --> 1:13:58.060]  is only one way to play baseball and once you see the moves if you're in a if
[1:13:58.060 --> 1:14:02.820]  you're an adult in your forty fifty sixties if you see these moves if you
[1:14:02.820 --> 1:14:07.220]  sense people getting around your parents it's time to go to these people i mean
[1:14:07.220 --> 1:14:08.420]  there are
[1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:11.940]  they'll just do it to old folks though there's all sorts of
[1:14:11.940 --> 1:14:15.700]  uh... you know neighbors and and other people i'm telling you folks
[1:14:15.700 --> 1:14:20.580]  there are so many parasites and most liberals aren't really liberals i mean
[1:14:20.580 --> 1:14:24.060]  if you go out to dinner with them they'll never give a tip they'll never help try
[1:14:24.060 --> 1:14:27.660]  to buy dinner they'll and they'll get them they'll also resent you though
[1:14:27.660 --> 1:14:31.780]  because you're a you know a nice person they are parasites that's what big
[1:14:31.780 --> 1:14:36.620]  governments about is the parasites all getting together robbing those of us that
[1:14:36.620 --> 1:14:38.980]  produce i really appreciate your call it's great
[1:14:38.980 --> 1:14:41.700]  uh... hearing from you know and i had you on for twenty minutes
[1:14:41.700 --> 1:14:44.540]  uh... paul in florida's everything you said wrong true
[1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:50.180]  anna jd gavin sam dave work your calls are coming up in a moment
[1:14:50.180 --> 1:14:53.900]  but speaking of class warfare this is how it works
[1:14:53.900 --> 1:14:58.060]  the ultra elite the ultra rich and this is in carol quickly's book that with the
[1:14:58.060 --> 1:15:00.020]  cia commission for him to write
[1:15:00.020 --> 1:15:02.300]  so there'd be an official history
[1:15:02.300 --> 1:15:03.660]  for government operatives
[1:15:03.660 --> 1:15:07.100]  took you know really know all how the world works
[1:15:07.100 --> 1:15:10.180]  and this is in many other documents and government reports and think tank
[1:15:10.180 --> 1:15:11.220]  reports
[1:15:11.220 --> 1:15:12.740]  the elite
[1:15:12.740 --> 1:15:14.940]  socialize in the first phase
[1:15:14.940 --> 1:15:18.300]  break up the families you can have a man in the house
[1:15:18.300 --> 1:15:20.260]  uh...
[1:15:20.260 --> 1:15:23.300]  you can have welfare but you can have a man in the house knowing
[1:15:23.300 --> 1:15:26.620]  your three or four times more likely if your kids to be on drugs are not present
[1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:29.140]  breaking down society then there's more crime
[1:15:29.140 --> 1:15:31.260]  in the middle class wants more cops
[1:15:31.260 --> 1:15:32.420]  more control
[1:15:32.420 --> 1:15:35.260]  uh... more gun control because there's all these criminals running around
[1:15:35.260 --> 1:15:36.260]  shooting people
[1:15:36.260 --> 1:15:40.100]  you know it again they create the crisis and always offer the next solution
[1:15:40.100 --> 1:15:42.460]  then they create another even bigger crisis in
[1:15:42.460 --> 1:15:45.620]  then you get deeper into the news deeper into the quick stand and they've got
[1:15:45.620 --> 1:15:48.460]  another solution
[1:15:48.460 --> 1:15:51.860]  and exactly you learn all the little scams and there's hundreds of them but
[1:15:51.860 --> 1:15:54.180]  there's only a hundred or so of the scams they run
[1:15:54.180 --> 1:15:55.820]  different permutations of them
[1:15:55.820 --> 1:15:58.660]  then you know their whole game plan you know what they're going to do next
[1:15:58.660 --> 1:16:00.580]  and it's so frustrating to the public
[1:16:00.580 --> 1:16:03.180]  completely blind all of this but
[1:16:03.180 --> 1:16:04.420]  i was digressing
[1:16:04.420 --> 1:16:07.100]  they're now playing class warfare the elite
[1:16:07.100 --> 1:16:12.420]  breed up this giant dumb down mass of poor people with no futures or no jobs
[1:16:12.420 --> 1:16:15.220]  and they then point them at the middle class
[1:16:15.220 --> 1:16:18.580]  i mean folks blue collar people think if you're living in a two hundred thousand
[1:16:18.580 --> 1:16:20.860]  dollar house and drive a thirty thousand dollar car
[1:16:20.860 --> 1:16:22.820]  they call you rich
[1:16:22.820 --> 1:16:25.780]  i mean if if if you've got nicer rims
[1:16:25.780 --> 1:16:28.660]  then your neighbor in a blue collar neighborhood
[1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:31.140]  they think you're rich and they envy you
[1:16:31.140 --> 1:16:33.980]  i never was brought up like this i never knew this
[1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:36.180]  you know living in blue collar neighborhoods
[1:16:36.180 --> 1:16:40.340]  uh... and i would have a car a little nicer than neighbors and they would
[1:16:40.340 --> 1:16:42.180]  actually be jealous of it
[1:16:42.180 --> 1:16:44.220]  i mean again it's mental illness
[1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:47.460]  and they have ingrained this in the public
[1:16:47.460 --> 1:16:51.380]  now and they're telling them look we're going to take the rich people's money
[1:16:51.380 --> 1:16:52.940]  and who are the rich people
[1:16:52.940 --> 1:16:55.020]  anybody who has won
[1:16:55.020 --> 1:16:56.060]  nickel
[1:16:56.060 --> 1:16:57.020]  more
[1:16:57.020 --> 1:16:59.500]  than them is rich
[1:16:59.500 --> 1:17:00.660]  and so now
[1:17:00.660 --> 1:17:04.620]  they call the public school children and we have the police training videos of
[1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:05.480]  this
[1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:08.220]  footage in austin of them doing this that school children
[1:17:08.220 --> 1:17:11.260]  and they say here is your debit card with your name
[1:17:11.260 --> 1:17:14.740]  and they thumb print you to enroll you in it as a criminal
[1:17:14.740 --> 1:17:20.100]  and they say you get two hundred dollars to turn in somebody with guns
[1:17:20.100 --> 1:17:21.100]  and they send a
[1:17:21.100 --> 1:17:22.740]  flyer home with parents saying

[1:22:01.140 --> 1:22:06.460]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:22:06.460 --> 1:22:12.460]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:22:12.460 --> 1:22:14.540]  just as well funded.
[1:22:14.540 --> 1:22:19.700]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:22:19.700 --> 1:22:21.200]  of the American people.
[1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:25.580]  Now Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one of this election.

[1:22:30.660 --> 1:22:37.220]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:22:37.220 --> 1:22:40.780]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[1:22:40.780 --> 1:22:47.700]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:24:42.620 --> 1:24:51.020]  I'm not back and down, you hear our war drums against your tyranny, we see your army, we
[1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:55.340]  know what it is, your mind control doesn't work on us.
[1:24:55.340 --> 1:25:01.060]  Now I'm here beating my chest, getting fired up, all right, your phone call's coming up
[1:25:01.060 --> 1:25:06.540]  the next segment, bunch of gas coming to break down, H1N1 virus manufactured, all these top
[1:25:06.540 --> 1:25:13.620]  scientists are now coming out, we told you, I owe a weapon as a dry run test, man, how
[1:25:13.620 --> 1:25:17.660]  do I get it so accurate, how do I do it, I tell you, it's amazing what hard work and
[1:25:17.660 --> 1:25:23.100]  research does, and when you commit, but let's go to Ted Anderson for four short minutes
[1:25:23.100 --> 1:25:29.460]  of the segment time we've got left, because ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe in
[1:25:29.460 --> 1:25:35.300]  this, I buy silver and gold, and when I started buying it, it was $300 an ounce or less, and
[1:25:35.300 --> 1:25:41.380]  now it is, and when I started buying silver, it was $5 an ounce, it's now, what, triple
[1:25:41.380 --> 1:25:46.820]  that, so ladies and gentlemen, Ted Anderson's got gold and silver, from when silver was
[1:25:46.820 --> 1:25:52.620]  a couple bucks less than ounce, and when gold was 50 something bucks under what it is right
[1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:59.700]  now, and he's still selling it with that cost factored in, so you're, look, this is why
[1:25:59.700 --> 1:26:04.340]  modest resources is growing so fast, because Ted is doing this, other gold brokerage firms,
[1:26:04.340 --> 1:26:09.460]  they sell it for whatever the market is, Ted doesn't do that, he takes a big risk, hordes
[1:26:09.460 --> 1:26:16.260]  up a bunch of it, and he keeps in bank vaults, and then he sells it to you at the lower price,
[1:26:16.260 --> 1:26:20.060]  that's how he smashes competition, it's a smart move, and gold has gone up another six
[1:26:20.060 --> 1:26:25.220]  bucks today, it's going up every day, silver is, and he's got the Lakota rounds, these
[1:26:25.220 --> 1:26:28.900]  gorgeous silver coins that everybody else has sold out of, he's got gold and silver,
[1:26:28.900 --> 1:26:33.380]  he's got it right now, Ted Anderson, I love hurting the New World Order, they're like
[1:26:33.380 --> 1:26:37.540]  smog the dragon, they hoard and sit on gold and silver and platinum, but then they tell
[1:26:37.540 --> 1:26:42.060]  the public don't buy it, where we're like little baby smogs, we're smart, we're sitting
[1:26:42.060 --> 1:26:45.940]  with our little bellies on top of the gold and silver, and we think people should also
[1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:50.180]  create their own little dragon's nest, shouldn't they?
[1:26:50.180 --> 1:26:53.940]  They sure should, I mean I don't know why it would make any sense to stay with a fiat
[1:26:53.940 --> 1:26:58.580]  currency, I just looked at the foreclosure numbers that just came out today, and my
[1:26:58.580 --> 1:27:07.460]  god it's up 36% from last month home foreclosures, I mean the 1.3 million people Alex have lost
[1:27:07.460 --> 1:27:12.380]  their homes to foreclosures since August of last year, I mean every time I look at the
[1:27:12.380 --> 1:27:20.300]  economic news I just get more depressed, you know this is this planned you know movement
[1:27:20.300 --> 1:27:27.340]  toward world currency, and the United States people are just getting hammered, and you
[1:27:27.340 --> 1:27:28.340]  know there's no one.
[1:27:28.340 --> 1:27:32.820]  Ted, world government has been announced in thousands of articles, hundreds of weeks,
[1:27:32.820 --> 1:27:36.500]  I haven't counted them all up, it's hundreds of weeks, it's got to be four or five thousand
[1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:41.180]  last six months since the order went out, go ahead admit we're setting up world government
[1:27:41.180 --> 1:27:45.500]  that you're going to pay taxes to private banks, and the London Guardian has this headline
[1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:50.900]  about the Bilderberg group might exist, we're going to see if the conspiracy theory is real,
[1:27:50.900 --> 1:27:57.420]  when the Bilderberg group is now admitting they exist, I mean Ted this is insane.
[1:27:57.420 --> 1:28:01.460]  It's beyond insane Alex, and yeah you're right, gold is up another ten bucks today.
[1:28:01.460 --> 1:28:04.260]  Oh I'm sorry it went up four bucks as I talked to you an hour ago.
[1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:09.180]  Yep, and so you know here you're sitting on, we're talking about gold that I accumulated
[1:28:09.180 --> 1:28:16.060]  at 880 dollars an ounce, and so now we're up another ten dollars, I mean anybody with
[1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:20.180]  any sense in their head would say why don't you just go the easy route, sell the gold
[1:28:20.180 --> 1:28:24.580]  that you bought at this 880 into the marketplace, I can pick up eight percent right now, but
[1:28:24.580 --> 1:28:26.460]  I think it's better to give it to the customers.
[1:28:26.460 --> 1:28:30.300]  And by the way Ted, you said customers can call you back, you'll buy from them won't
[1:28:30.300 --> 1:28:31.300]  you?
[1:28:31.300 --> 1:28:35.740]  Absolutely, that's what I buy all the time, I mean the challenge right now in the marketplace
[1:28:35.740 --> 1:28:40.380]  is not to sell this stuff and find customers that want it, the challenge is to try to find
[1:28:40.380 --> 1:28:44.220]  the material so I can actually have it for sale, and every now and then I get a little
[1:28:44.220 --> 1:28:49.060]  break because the market gets soft, it dips down, less people are interested, so I'm
[1:28:49.060 --> 1:28:52.620]  able to do things like accumulate these sovereigns and fringes.
[1:28:52.620 --> 1:28:56.780]  By the way folks, we try to pitch gold and silver at you because we believe in it, win
[1:28:56.780 --> 1:28:58.820]  the markets down and you don't listen.
[1:28:58.820 --> 1:29:02.980]  So we do the best thing to that, well I guess it's just as good, we sell it to you at that
[1:29:02.980 --> 1:29:09.340]  original low price when it's up, I mean folks you can't beat this, Ted tell them, tell them
[1:29:09.340 --> 1:29:12.620]  that you are running out of the gold though, I was talking this morning, you're running
[1:29:12.620 --> 1:29:17.180]  out of sovereigns and the Franks at that 880 price with it up above 930 right now aren't
[1:29:17.180 --> 1:29:18.180]  you?
[1:29:18.180 --> 1:29:23.100]  Yeah, well of course because people are buying it up like crazy, I mean the Franks at 214
[1:29:23.100 --> 1:29:27.900]  and the sovereigns at 267 is like getting an 8 percent to 10 percent discount right
[1:29:27.900 --> 1:29:28.900]  off the top.
[1:29:28.900 --> 1:29:34.940]  Well like you said, silver is up 30 plus percent in the last few months, folks what other investments
[1:29:34.940 --> 1:29:40.300]  doing that and are we saying it's bullet proof, no but it's like an armored Abrams
[1:29:40.300 --> 1:29:46.460]  M1A1 compared to wearing a silk shirt for armor, I mean it's the best thing out there
[1:29:46.460 --> 1:29:49.620]  folks and I'll stay there until we give them the number on the other side, then Paul Watson
[1:29:49.620 --> 1:30:01.300]  curtain him on a lot more.
[1:30:01.300 --> 1:30:05.980]  Attention Gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self reliance update, GCN has just discovered
[1:30:05.980 --> 1:30:10.340]  a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs, it's called ProtoGrow and
[1:30:10.340 --> 1:30:14.020]  it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants
[1:30:14.020 --> 1:30:18.300]  to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions, now here's the best
[1:30:18.300 --> 1:30:22.100]  part for our listeners who garden for self reliance, ProtoGrow's unique blend of sea
[1:30:22.100 --> 1:30:26.940]  nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant
[1:30:26.940 --> 1:30:30.980]  growth in minimum time, ProtoGrow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity
[1:30:30.980 --> 1:30:35.140]  to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants, ProtoGrow's full spectrum
[1:30:35.140 --> 1:30:38.660]  plant fertility needs fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times
[1:30:38.660 --> 1:30:42.500]  the nutritional value and if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass
[1:30:42.500 --> 1:30:47.020]  you can, if you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non hybrids it's now easy,
[1:30:47.020 --> 1:30:50.620]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt sheep superfoods should visit the ProtoGrow website
[1:30:50.620 --> 1:31:01.740]  at growlightcrazy.com, that's www.growlightcrazy.com or call 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365.
[1:31:01.740 --> 1:31:07.860]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:31:07.860 --> 1:31:12.380]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:31:12.380 --> 1:31:13.660]  us would like to see.
[1:31:13.660 --> 1:31:18.820]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:31:18.820 --> 1:31:19.820]  of the American people.
[1:31:19.820 --> 1:31:24.580]  Well Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:31:24.580 --> 1:31:29.700]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:37.820]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:31:37.820 --> 1:31:41.380]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government.
[1:31:41.380 --> 1:31:48.300]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:32:01.180 --> 1:32:06.820]  Today we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country, the economy, job layoffs,
[1:32:06.820 --> 1:32:12.700]  mass foreclosures, and now we are all at risk of being exposed to this new flu pandemic.
[1:32:12.700 --> 1:32:16.740]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United
[1:32:16.740 --> 1:32:17.740]  States.
[1:32:17.740 --> 1:32:19.220]  What can you do to prepare yourself?

[1:33:25.580 --> 1:33:33.300]  Let it on the road my friend, it's going to keep you free and clean.
[1:33:33.300 --> 1:33:41.540]  Now you wear your skin like a heart, and your breath as hard as kerosene, and weren't
[1:33:41.540 --> 1:33:49.180]  your mama's only boy, but her favorite one it seemed.
[1:33:49.180 --> 1:33:55.220]  She began to cry when you said goodbye.
[1:33:55.220 --> 1:33:56.220]  Second to your dreams.
[1:33:56.220 --> 1:33:57.220]  Second to your dreams.
[1:33:57.220 --> 1:33:58.220]  Second to your dreams.
[1:33:58.220 --> 1:33:59.220]  Second to your dreams.
[1:33:59.220 --> 1:34:00.220]  Second to your dreams.
[1:34:00.220 --> 1:34:01.220]  All right, let's go back to Ted real quick.
[1:34:01.220 --> 1:34:02.220]  We've got Kurt Demo coming on.
[1:34:02.220 --> 1:34:05.220]  Paul and Kurt have written separate articles.
[1:34:05.220 --> 1:34:09.100]  There's a whole bunch of top phrologists and scientists coming on saying, yeah, this had
[1:34:09.100 --> 1:34:10.100]  to be engineered.
[1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:12.980]  Do you think I came on the air?
[1:34:12.980 --> 1:34:16.100]  Was that two, three weeks ago and said it was engineered just because I wanted to say
[1:34:16.100 --> 1:34:17.100]  that?
[1:34:17.100 --> 1:34:20.020]  I did major research.
[1:34:20.020 --> 1:34:22.660]  It's clearly engineered.
[1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:27.460]  Just like they sell in South Korea glowing rhesus monkeys that are part jellyfish, if
[1:34:27.460 --> 1:34:32.180]  I'm walking down the streets of Seoul, South Korea, and I see them selling glowing monkeys,
[1:34:32.180 --> 1:34:36.620]  I know it's genetically engineered.
[1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:37.620]  It's real simple.
[1:34:37.620 --> 1:34:39.740]  And then we'll get into this tattletail squads.
[1:34:39.740 --> 1:34:43.060]  I mean, now they're saying, oh, guess what, the whole anti-terrorist situation?
[1:34:43.060 --> 1:34:44.500]  It's about class warfare.
[1:34:44.500 --> 1:34:46.100]  Does your neighbor smoke cigars?
[1:34:46.100 --> 1:34:49.660]  They're probably stealing and have an underground economy.
[1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:53.900]  I told you the whole police state is about shutting down, selling watermelons and eggs
[1:34:53.900 --> 1:34:55.060]  on the side of the road.
[1:34:55.060 --> 1:34:57.400]  It's about getting cash for mowing lawns.
[1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:01.180]  The National ID cards they've stated will be used to track and trace everything you
[1:35:01.180 --> 1:35:02.700]  do in buying and selling.
[1:35:02.700 --> 1:35:05.260]  And it's all being announced.
[1:35:05.260 --> 1:35:07.860]  It's all being announced.
[1:35:07.860 --> 1:35:11.540]  Going back to Ted Anderson, Ted, we've got to fight to stay on the cash economy.
[1:35:11.540 --> 1:35:14.500]  We got to fight to stay out of the casual society control grid.
[1:35:14.500 --> 1:35:17.380]  We've got to get self-sufficient and gold and silver is the way to do it.
[1:35:17.380 --> 1:35:21.940]  Briefly again, tell folks, how long are you going to have the Franks and the sovereigns
[1:35:21.940 --> 1:35:23.780]  left at $50?
[1:35:23.780 --> 1:35:28.580]  You bought them at when the market was $50 under that discount is factored in per ounce,
[1:35:28.580 --> 1:35:30.740]  $50 discount per ounce.
[1:35:30.740 --> 1:35:34.820]  Again, you continue to offer these types of deals when you can.
[1:35:34.820 --> 1:35:36.500]  This is one of those rare opportunities, Ted.
[1:35:36.500 --> 1:35:43.660]  Well, I can tell you right now, Alex, $600,000 worth of gold and silver will go pretty quick.
[1:35:43.660 --> 1:35:47.020]  I will guarantee these prices till midnight tonight.
[1:35:47.020 --> 1:35:50.460]  I hope to be able to offer this throughout the weekend.
[1:35:50.460 --> 1:35:51.460]  But I don't know.
[1:35:51.460 --> 1:35:55.260]  I mean, it depends upon how many people respond and how many people buy.
[1:35:55.260 --> 1:36:03.020]  But if you have anything sitting in the bank, if you're in the stock market, if you're sitting
[1:36:03.020 --> 1:36:10.660]  on IRAs that are denominated in paper notes of any type, I mean, all this stuff is affected
[1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:12.860]  by the United States dollar.
[1:36:12.860 --> 1:36:17.540]  And people are silly enough to think that Barack Obama is going to solve this problem
[1:36:17.540 --> 1:36:22.140]  with the Federal Reserve system bailing it out, turning on the printing press.
[1:36:22.140 --> 1:36:25.500]  I mean, it just does not work out that way.
[1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:30.940]  Thank God we have the campaign for liberty, pushing and educating people to let them know
[1:36:30.940 --> 1:36:33.340]  that this just is not the right answer.
[1:36:33.340 --> 1:36:35.260]  But you're right about that, Alex.
[1:36:35.260 --> 1:36:40.700]  People need to get themselves off the fiat currency and onto gold and silver and become
[1:36:40.700 --> 1:36:42.500]  self-sufficient.
[1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:46.940]  And the way to do that is by picking up small pieces of gold and silver, like the British
[1:36:46.940 --> 1:36:51.100]  Sovereign and the Frank that I'm talking about now, or even probably one of the best buys
[1:36:51.100 --> 1:36:57.180]  that I have on the market right now are the Franklin halves are at $8.69, which is the
[1:36:57.180 --> 1:36:58.180]  same price.
[1:36:58.180 --> 1:36:59.500]  The Lakota's have gone up.
[1:36:59.500 --> 1:37:05.260]  The Lakota's were $17.71, now $19.66.
[1:37:05.260 --> 1:37:09.780]  I'm not saying they're not a good buy at that price because they're between $25 and $30
[1:37:09.780 --> 1:37:12.780]  bucks if you go look on eBay, that they're a wonderful buy.
[1:37:12.780 --> 1:37:16.740]  But you can pick up things that have not moved yet that have been able to hold inventory
[1:37:16.740 --> 1:37:21.100]  on and take advantage of some of the lower prices.
[1:37:21.100 --> 1:37:23.340]  But now is the time to move.
[1:37:23.340 --> 1:37:25.980]  There's just way too much trouble out there.
[1:37:25.980 --> 1:37:30.500]  Just Google foreclosures right now and take a look at what those numbers look like.
[1:37:30.500 --> 1:37:33.460]  I mean, there are people being forced out of their homes.
[1:37:33.460 --> 1:37:37.060]  You had that nice lady on air just yesterday.
[1:37:37.060 --> 1:37:40.500]  You were talking about that gal that just got foreclosed on by the sheriff.
[1:37:40.500 --> 1:37:44.700]  What do you think is going to happen to you and your neighbors around you?
[1:37:44.700 --> 1:37:47.940]  I mean, the people are losing their jobs right and left.
[1:37:47.940 --> 1:37:53.060]  There's an economic implosion coming in Geithner himself admits to the fact that when
[1:37:53.060 --> 1:37:58.100]  all this falls apart, he's looking at turning the currency over to the hands of a world
[1:37:58.100 --> 1:37:59.100]  bank.
[1:37:59.100 --> 1:38:04.220]  I mean, do you want to be the United States Constitution is being shredded as we speak
[1:38:04.220 --> 1:38:08.140]  and I had that's how the scam works is they're the con artists.
[1:38:08.140 --> 1:38:13.780]  They create the crisis and the public like children being led by Jeffrey Dahmer into
[1:38:13.780 --> 1:38:19.740]  a death pit, take their hand and then the, you know, believing the solution is world
[1:38:19.740 --> 1:38:21.580]  government and more of the same.
[1:38:21.580 --> 1:38:23.020]  And then things get deeper and darker.
[1:38:23.020 --> 1:38:27.780]  They clutch the leg of the very monsters that are instituting all this folks.
[1:38:27.780 --> 1:38:37.660]  Here's the number, the Midas resources, 800-686-2237-800-686-2237 and the brokers will be there until
[1:38:37.660 --> 1:38:39.460]  midnight tonight.
[1:38:39.460 --> 1:38:44.460]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, give them a call 800-686-2237.
[1:38:44.460 --> 1:38:47.480]  Take advantage of this today, whether it's one coin or a hundred.
[1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:53.820]  This is the smart move in my book, 800-686-2237 Ted, thanks.
[1:38:53.820 --> 1:38:54.820]  Yeah.
[1:38:54.820 --> 1:38:56.220]  Thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[1:38:56.220 --> 1:38:57.220]  You bet.
[1:38:57.220 --> 1:38:58.220]  Thank you, Anderson.
[1:38:58.220 --> 1:39:00.980]  Now, Paul Watts is coming up in about five minutes and I'm going to have them both on
[1:39:00.980 --> 1:39:07.140]  together because they're both reporting separately on some of the same scientists, but then on
[1:39:07.140 --> 1:39:12.620]  other scientists, there's British, Australian, US, Canadian top virologist, I mean, tops
[1:39:12.620 --> 1:39:16.700]  of their field saying, oh, clearly this is a manufactured virus.
[1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:21.620]  Well, they know that other scientists are now looking at the virus saying the same thing.
[1:39:21.620 --> 1:39:27.180]  So it's the top guys we can trust from the establishment are saying, oh, it probably
[1:39:27.180 --> 1:39:31.140]  escaped accidentally out of a vaccine lab.
[1:39:31.140 --> 1:39:42.940]  Yes, that's how in the wrong season, in the wrong hemisphere, it appears in Mexico.
[1:39:42.940 --> 1:39:46.540]  Now, if you believe that, I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[1:39:46.540 --> 1:39:53.260]  See, they're now admitting it's a manufactured virus, even though I got attacked by Newsweek
[1:39:53.260 --> 1:39:54.860]  and CNN for saying that.
[1:39:54.860 --> 1:40:00.860]  Oh, prisonplot.com and the nutcase Alex Jones, you know, believes it's manufactured.
[1:40:00.860 --> 1:40:06.660]  Never linking to all the documents we posted because, I mean, again, I've interviewed enough
[1:40:06.660 --> 1:40:12.780]  virologist to know it didn't have the pedigree of something that mutated each year into this.
[1:40:12.780 --> 1:40:19.100]  It was four different viruses, pig, human and bird, all mixed together.
[1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:22.220]  And it had no history, no pedigree, no mutation history.
[1:40:22.220 --> 1:40:28.140]  It had to come out of a lab, it had all the markers as some type of beta test or tracker.
[1:40:28.140 --> 1:40:31.020]  And they're now saying, I said, now, folks, this may not be the big one, even though they're
[1:40:31.020 --> 1:40:36.380]  saying it, but they may say it's going to be a mutation to combine with something new in
[1:40:36.380 --> 1:40:37.380]  the fall.
[1:40:37.380 --> 1:40:40.580]  Then they came out and said that I know the enemy.
[1:40:40.580 --> 1:40:42.340]  I know the enemy.
[1:40:42.340 --> 1:40:49.140]  Now, the new spin is, okay, it's manufactured, but it accidentally got out of a lab and showed
[1:40:49.140 --> 1:40:54.700]  up all over the place in Mexico and the world and went viral in the wrong hemisphere, wrong
[1:40:54.700 --> 1:40:55.700]  time of year.
[1:40:55.700 --> 1:40:57.820]  This is absolute bull.
[1:40:57.820 --> 1:41:03.340]  Okay, so they're now going, okay, it's manufactured, because we know independent scientists and
[1:41:03.340 --> 1:41:06.500]  virologists are going to look at it under electron microscopes.
[1:41:06.500 --> 1:41:10.180]  Okay, it's manufactured, it's got our serial numbers on it.
[1:41:10.180 --> 1:41:11.180]  No big deal.
[1:41:11.180 --> 1:41:14.180]  It's like Blade Runner.
[1:41:14.180 --> 1:41:16.020]  Who made this?
[1:41:16.020 --> 1:41:17.020]  Who made this scale?
[1:41:17.020 --> 1:41:18.020]  Is it fish?
[1:41:18.020 --> 1:41:28.820]  Oh, Mr. Decker, this snake, highest quality chung pao laboratories, ah.
[1:41:28.820 --> 1:41:32.060]  Same deal.
[1:41:32.060 --> 1:41:34.020]  Same deal here.
[1:41:34.020 --> 1:41:35.220]  And I just know the enemy.
[1:41:35.220 --> 1:41:36.220]  Let's go to Curt and M.O.
[1:41:36.220 --> 1:41:40.340]  Curt, you've written articles, Paul Watson's written articles, break this down for us.
[1:41:40.340 --> 1:41:46.900]  Well, Bloomberg's reporting this scientist in Australia, his name's Adrian Kib, who incidentally
[1:41:46.900 --> 1:41:55.100]  collaborated on TEMFLU research, is saying that the H1N1 was accidentally created in
[1:41:55.100 --> 1:42:02.500]  a laboratory, you know, while they were manufacturing or developing a vaccine, and that it escaped
[1:42:02.500 --> 1:42:03.500]  the laboratory.
[1:42:03.500 --> 1:42:08.180]  The comments read, you hear all the time about these viruses, they just incidentally escaped.
[1:42:08.180 --> 1:42:15.220]  He also said that it's possible that it's naturally occurring, which is total bunk,
[1:42:15.220 --> 1:42:16.220]  we know that.
[1:42:16.220 --> 1:42:18.940]  But there are other scientists in England and others, I mean, you guys wrote stories
[1:42:18.940 --> 1:42:23.660]  a week ago with other scientists saying it's clearly manufactured.
[1:42:23.660 --> 1:42:26.940]  So why are they, do you think, coming out and doing this?
[1:42:26.940 --> 1:42:31.140]  Because they know that other scientists who aren't part of the New World Order are going
[1:42:31.140 --> 1:42:34.420]  to bring this info out, so they want to bring it out first, put their spin on it?
[1:42:34.420 --> 1:42:36.620]  Yeah, I think this is a cover story.
[1:42:36.620 --> 1:42:41.620]  Because, you know, for instance, as Wayne Madsen reported when the so-called swine flu
[1:42:41.620 --> 1:42:49.420]  thing was going big, that a top scientist at the United Nations said that he was a researcher
[1:42:49.420 --> 1:42:56.820]  on the outbreak of Ebola in Africa and AIDS, that this was a manufactured pathogen, not
[1:42:56.820 --> 1:42:57.820]  naturally occurring.
[1:42:57.820 --> 1:43:05.740]  So it's all over the media, people are saying that this is a bioengineered weapon, and so
[1:43:05.740 --> 1:43:08.620]  this is a cover story, so they can cover their butts, you know?
[1:43:08.620 --> 1:43:14.420]  But I don't think we're going to see an MSNBC retraction when they attacked us and said
[1:43:14.420 --> 1:43:19.020]  that we said it was manufactured and that meant we were racist.
[1:43:19.020 --> 1:43:26.900]  And they didn't even, when the MSNBC or CNN describe how it's racist to say it's bio-weapon.
[1:43:26.900 --> 1:43:31.980]  I mean, you'll say, hey, I don't like cloudy rainy days, and they say, oh, you don't like
[1:43:31.980 --> 1:43:32.980]  black people.
[1:43:32.980 --> 1:43:37.460]  Well, the point is that a lot of people aren't getting their news from an MSNBC and a corporate
[1:43:37.460 --> 1:43:41.260]  media, they're going to the internet, they're going to infoawards.com and prison plan to
[1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:42.260]  get their information.
[1:43:42.260 --> 1:43:47.180]  So these guys realize, of course, that a large number of people are, you know, reading the
[1:43:47.180 --> 1:43:49.860]  truth, so they got to devise a cover story for this.
[1:43:49.860 --> 1:43:50.860]  Yeah, that's right.
[1:43:50.860 --> 1:43:55.940]  The Alex Jones channel that a volunteer had up under full authorization from us had over
[1:43:55.940 --> 1:43:59.700]  two million hits that week, but it was getting about a million views a week before that,
[1:43:59.700 --> 1:44:03.340]  really starting to become one of the biggest channels out there, no doubt one of the biggest
[1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:05.260]  political.
[1:44:05.260 --> 1:44:12.740]  And just on that channel, there was 220,000 views, 150,000 views, 80,000 views, just dozens
[1:44:12.740 --> 1:44:16.980]  and dozens of videos over 100,000 views, and it was all about the bird flu.
[1:44:16.980 --> 1:44:23.140]  And if you went to all the different video aggregating sites, we were the top everywhere
[1:44:23.140 --> 1:44:26.660]  with what I had to say about this and how it was manufactured.
[1:44:26.660 --> 1:44:32.300]  And I've noticed all the sites that are shutting down, it's sites that have posted my videos
[1:44:32.300 --> 1:44:33.660]  about the bird flu.
[1:44:33.660 --> 1:44:39.820]  So we said something in those rants, Kurt, that really freaked the establishment out.
[1:44:39.820 --> 1:44:43.660]  And now we're finding out we hit the nail directly on the head, Kurt.
[1:44:43.660 --> 1:44:44.660]  Absolutely.
[1:44:44.660 --> 1:44:45.660]  Absolutely.
[1:44:45.660 --> 1:44:49.740]  So I think they're coming up with this cover story to, you know, down the road, say, well,
[1:44:49.740 --> 1:44:53.220]  this was, you know, another mutation that escaped from the laboratory, another Frankenstein
[1:44:53.220 --> 1:44:56.780]  type scenario, but it's not going to wash, it's just not going to work.
[1:44:56.780 --> 1:44:58.540]  Okay, well, let's just believe that.
[1:44:58.540 --> 1:45:02.900]  They accidentally released foot and mouth weaponized and it showed up in over 40 locations.
[1:45:02.900 --> 1:45:05.460]  It was even more than that was 60 something locations.
[1:45:05.460 --> 1:45:10.860]  We can pull up the articles in 2001, weaponized, magically pops up everywhere at once, had
[1:45:10.860 --> 1:45:15.900]  to be planted, weaponized, we say it's weaponized, later they say, oh yeah, it accidentally got
[1:45:15.900 --> 1:45:21.120]  released from our lab, but we're now going to take total control of the country.
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:27.500]  And then they accidentally released the horse flu that can also kill humans in Australia
[1:45:27.500 --> 1:45:30.340]  last year, and they always accidentally release it.
[1:45:30.340 --> 1:45:32.300]  Okay, let's say they're accidentally doing this.
[1:45:32.300 --> 1:45:36.860]  They're a bunch of knuckle dragging buffoons at level three and level four bioweapons labs
[1:45:36.860 --> 1:45:42.460]  that just magically accidentally spread this everywhere, even out of season, it's spreading.
[1:45:42.460 --> 1:45:48.280]  And then why are we allowing these people to be toilet attendants, much less run bioweapons
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:50.980]  labs or bioweapons treatment labs?
[1:45:50.980 --> 1:45:54.660]  And the, you know, the larger issue here is obviously they're staging it, obviously that's
[1:45:54.660 --> 1:45:55.660]  not the case.
[1:45:55.660 --> 1:46:00.580]  And they're building 36 level four bioweapons lab, moving them from the desert and the Atlantic
[1:46:00.580 --> 1:46:06.540]  ocean, Plum Island, to places like San Antonio, Texas, and Galveston, Texas.
[1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:10.900]  And then you go Google the names of the scientists that are running these new labs, and they all
[1:46:10.900 --> 1:46:16.100]  just so happen to be 12 monkeys type eugenicists who write white papers about how they want
[1:46:16.100 --> 1:46:17.100]  to kill us.
[1:46:17.100 --> 1:46:19.300]  I mean, can we put two and two together here, Kurt?
[1:46:19.300 --> 1:46:20.300]  Yeah.
[1:46:20.300 --> 1:46:25.500]  You know, as well, part of this Bloomberg article was a, they floated the suggestion that there
[1:46:25.500 --> 1:46:31.300]  should be some kind of international regulatory commission or something or agency that, that
[1:46:31.300 --> 1:46:35.380]  oversees these, these, uh, these, uh, you know, these biomedical labs.
[1:46:35.380 --> 1:46:40.020]  Incidentally, you know, during the whole thing with the so-called swine flu, there
[1:46:40.020 --> 1:46:44.020]  was a report about virus samples that went missing at Fort Dietrich.
[1:46:44.020 --> 1:46:48.700]  Uh, that, that thing was on a radar screen for about a nanosecond and then disappeared.
[1:46:48.700 --> 1:46:53.300]  So, you know, they're losing this stuff right and left, losing is, you know, in quotation
[1:46:53.300 --> 1:46:54.300]  marks.
[1:46:54.300 --> 1:46:59.100]  Kind of like they lost the weaponized anthrax, they mailed out to all their enemies that
[1:46:59.100 --> 1:47:01.500]  was an accident and fell into the letters.
[1:47:01.500 --> 1:47:02.500]  Uh, like, right, right.
[1:47:02.500 --> 1:47:07.340]  That was the Bruce, uh, uh, Edwards, Irons case in the microbiologist who just happened
[1:47:07.340 --> 1:47:12.140]  to die after that, you know, the department of justice and the FBI kind of pointed a finger
[1:47:12.140 --> 1:47:13.140]  at him.
[1:47:13.140 --> 1:47:14.140]  And it was buried in the news.
[1:47:14.140 --> 1:47:19.220]  You had to read literally scores of articles to find they, he said, the government's setting
[1:47:19.220 --> 1:47:20.220]  me up.
[1:47:20.220 --> 1:47:21.220]  They said, you're mentally ill.
[1:47:21.220 --> 1:47:22.220]  Right.
[1:47:22.220 --> 1:47:30.340]  And then in a locked up cell, he ate a bunch of Tylenol, uh, prescription Tylenol and died.
[1:47:30.340 --> 1:47:32.420]  And then they hid that in the news.
[1:47:32.420 --> 1:47:33.420]  Right.
[1:47:33.420 --> 1:47:37.580]  By the way, I saw a story yesterday where the guy supposedly killed his family, shot
[1:47:37.580 --> 1:47:39.740]  himself and then buried himself.
[1:47:39.740 --> 1:47:43.380]  And the police with a straight face, Kurt, are saying he buried himself.
[1:47:43.380 --> 1:47:49.180]  He wrote a wonderful, I mean, pretty soon they, I mean, they might guillotine me on
[1:47:49.180 --> 1:47:52.460]  national TV and say, I did it.
[1:47:52.460 --> 1:47:53.460]  Yeah.
[1:47:53.460 --> 1:47:55.860]  I mean, that's the level of, go ahead.
[1:47:55.860 --> 1:48:00.180]  I was going to say it's interesting that, um, you know, another story you don't hear
[1:48:00.180 --> 1:48:05.100]  a whole lot about, uh, is all these microbiologists that are just, you know, disappearing.
[1:48:05.100 --> 1:48:09.300]  That is well figures into this whole scheme.
[1:48:09.300 --> 1:48:17.580]  Well, Kurt, when you realize that you Genesis run all the Western governments that the human
[1:48:17.580 --> 1:48:22.660]  genome project is publicly run at the eugenics center at Cold Springs, Harvard with IBM,
[1:48:22.660 --> 1:48:28.260]  Thomas Watson, the top Nazi who pledged his fortune, uh, to carry out eugenics when he
[1:48:28.260 --> 1:48:29.620]  died in the fifties.
[1:48:29.620 --> 1:48:34.020]  And then you find out Google gives almost all its money to eugenics, uh, quote, helping
[1:48:34.020 --> 1:48:38.100]  the black people in Africa is, is, is, is the, you know, headline.
[1:48:38.100 --> 1:48:43.060]  You find out that Microsoft gives all its money to this and you find out Warren Buffett
[1:48:43.060 --> 1:48:46.220]  gives all, I mean, like 98% of his money to this.
[1:48:46.220 --> 1:48:48.220]  I mean, this is a devil cult.
[1:48:48.220 --> 1:48:49.540]  These people mean business.
[1:48:49.540 --> 1:48:53.140]  This is 12 monkeys, folks, and they're getting ready to move.
[1:48:53.140 --> 1:48:56.300]  And I'm sorry they're going to murder most of us unless we stop them.
[1:48:56.300 --> 1:48:59.620]  And that means you out there cops and military and everybody else.
[1:48:59.620 --> 1:49:03.180]  Let's bring Paul Watson up because he's also written about all these different top scientists
[1:49:03.180 --> 1:49:05.460]  coming out and saying this was clearly manufactured.
[1:49:05.460 --> 1:49:07.580]  Paul Watson joining us from prisonplanted.com.
[1:49:07.580 --> 1:49:09.580]  Hello, Alex.
[1:49:09.580 --> 1:49:18.020]  Yeah, what's interesting about the, uh, the swine flu is that the people who got caught
[1:49:18.020 --> 1:49:25.700]  released in the live avian flu virus to 18 different labs in Europe, Baxter International,
[1:49:25.700 --> 1:49:30.020]  were not punished or investigated for their accident.
[1:49:30.020 --> 1:49:36.460]  They were rewarded with the multimillion dollar contract to create the vaccine for swine flu.
[1:49:36.460 --> 1:49:40.380]  So it's just like with 9 11, you know, they say, well, it was an accident.
[1:49:40.380 --> 1:49:41.380]  We were incompetent.
[1:49:41.380 --> 1:49:47.500]  And then it's an accident again, where this live avian flu gets released and yet they're
[1:49:47.500 --> 1:49:55.940]  not punished or regulated, they're rewarded with contracts to create the next vaccine.
[1:49:55.940 --> 1:50:00.580]  And then they always call for more regulation when there's already a global system to the
[1:50:00.580 --> 1:50:07.540]  EU and NATO to divvy out these vaccines, there already is a global government.
[1:50:07.540 --> 1:50:12.580]  They then say, oh, the very companies that are always involved accidentally in quotes
[1:50:12.580 --> 1:50:18.940]  releasing all this, they'll be the ones that run the police system, uh, protecting us
[1:50:18.940 --> 1:50:22.060]  from this so they can then carry it out and cover it up.
[1:50:22.060 --> 1:50:23.060]  Right.
[1:50:23.060 --> 1:50:29.740]  And this gives scientists who's been in this field for four decades, according to that
[1:50:29.740 --> 1:50:36.180]  Bloomberg report, he more specifically said that it was possible that it was released
[1:50:36.180 --> 1:50:39.860]  from a lab and that it probably was a vaccine production lab.
[1:50:39.860 --> 1:50:43.260]  So again, it's directly related to vaccines.
[1:50:43.260 --> 1:50:48.180]  Meanwhile, there's trials that are very secretive going on all over Europe with masses of people
[1:50:48.180 --> 1:50:55.340]  dying after they take bird flu vaccine when the media will never say what pharmaceutical
[1:50:55.340 --> 1:50:56.580]  company is doing it.
[1:50:56.580 --> 1:51:01.340]  And by the way, they're lying to the public telling him it's a regular flu shot.
[1:51:01.340 --> 1:51:04.820]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices
[1:51:04.820 --> 1:51:06.900]  and cut back on our expenses.
[1:51:06.900 --> 1:51:09.860]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on though is our health.
[1:51:09.860 --> 1:51:14.460]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, weak immune health, or just feel tired, you

[1:52:01.380 --> 1:52:07.260]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:07.260 --> 1:52:13.460]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,

[1:52:14.780 --> 1:52:19.940]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest

[1:52:20.940 --> 1:52:25.820]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:25.820 --> 1:52:30.940]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:52:30.940 --> 1:52:37.460]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:52:37.460 --> 1:52:41.020]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:52:41.020 --> 1:52:47.900]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:53:00.700 --> 1:53:03.100]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.

[2:00:16.780 --> 2:00:21.780]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:28.780 --> 2:00:30.780]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv now,
[2:00:30.780 --> 2:00:35.780]  now, some casting for the final two hours of this four hour transmission.
[2:00:35.780 --> 2:00:39.780]  I am here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[2:00:39.780 --> 2:00:42.780]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern.
[2:00:42.780 --> 2:00:48.780]  And we appreciate everybody joining us. I'm finishing up with the editor and writer at infowars.com.
[2:00:48.780 --> 2:00:53.780]  Kurt Nemo, great political mind and researcher.
[2:00:53.780 --> 2:00:56.780]  Believe me, we've looked for folks that can work in our operation.
[2:00:56.780 --> 2:00:58.780]  There are few and far between. Kurt's one of them.
[2:00:58.780 --> 2:01:03.780]  Other folks seem to always have flaws or blind spots when it comes to researching the new world order.
[2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:07.780]  I'm sad to say I wish our numbers were greater of those that have a really deep understanding.
[2:01:07.780 --> 2:01:12.780]  And, of course, another person I found out there who I, for years, watched and researched
[2:01:12.780 --> 2:01:14.780]  and decided to be a member of the team.
[2:01:14.780 --> 2:01:16.780]  And we're honored to have him. Paul Watson now for six years.
[2:01:16.780 --> 2:01:20.780]  And he runs PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv with his brother Steve Watson.
[2:01:20.780 --> 2:01:22.780]  That also does a fine job.
[2:01:22.780 --> 2:01:25.780]  Finishing up in this segment and the next, and I got another guest coming on.
[2:01:25.780 --> 2:01:28.780]  I appreciate your time, gentlemen. Paul Watson.
[2:01:28.780 --> 2:01:33.780]  I want to shift gears now into, because if we just cover this by itself,
[2:01:33.780 --> 2:01:37.780]  it doesn't bring the full import of what we're facing.
[2:01:37.780 --> 2:01:40.780]  They are creating class warfare and envy.
[2:01:40.780 --> 2:01:43.780]  And in the U.S., in England, they have similar programs.
[2:01:43.780 --> 2:01:45.780]  They say, does your neighbor look like they have more money than they should?
[2:01:45.780 --> 2:01:49.780]  Find out what job they've got. Ask them what their salary is and call police.
[2:01:49.780 --> 2:01:55.780]  You'll get a percentage of anything seized from black market business, garage sale money,
[2:01:55.780 --> 2:01:59.780]  coin collections they've sold, drugs, you know.
[2:01:59.780 --> 2:02:03.780]  And this is all under Homeland Security here and in England.
[2:02:03.780 --> 2:02:07.780]  They're taking the anti-terror system they've set up and the spy networks.
[2:02:07.780 --> 2:02:11.780]  They sell the public on, we're going to have spies, we need citizens tattling,
[2:02:11.780 --> 2:02:14.780]  we're listening to your phones without warrants, but it's to fight al-Qaeda.
[2:02:14.780 --> 2:02:17.780]  You don't want al-Qaeda to attack you. You saw 777, you saw 9-11.
[2:02:17.780 --> 2:02:21.780]  Now they just admit here in the U.S. and overseas, spy on your neighbor,
[2:02:21.780 --> 2:02:23.780]  spy on gun owners.
[2:02:23.780 --> 2:02:25.780]  If your neighbor has a gun, call the police on them.
[2:02:25.780 --> 2:02:27.780]  The billboards say when the guns aren't illegal.
[2:02:27.780 --> 2:02:32.780]  I mean, it's getting bad and guys, pull this up on screen for folks
[2:02:32.780 --> 2:02:34.780]  that are watching at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:02:34.780 --> 2:02:38.780]  It says a police encourage citizens to report people who drive nice cars.
[2:02:38.780 --> 2:02:43.780]  I want them to see the picture of the police chiefs and people smiling like criminals
[2:02:43.780 --> 2:02:46.780]  and they know this is asinine. It's a big joke to them.
[2:02:46.780 --> 2:02:49.780]  If you criticize open borders, you'll be arrested.
[2:02:49.780 --> 2:02:54.780]  You know, it shows on here a poster of a guy in a suit saying,
[2:02:54.780 --> 2:02:57.780]  too much bling, give us a ring.
[2:02:57.780 --> 2:02:59.780]  And it says bling.
[2:02:59.780 --> 2:03:02.780]  Call the police immediately if your neighbor has a boat or a nice car.
[2:03:02.780 --> 2:03:05.780]  It says in this recession, you're not supposed to have money.
[2:03:05.780 --> 2:03:08.780]  Paul Watson, this is creating class warfare.
[2:03:08.780 --> 2:03:10.780]  This is communism. This is what the Reds did.
[2:03:10.780 --> 2:03:12.780]  They said arrest your neighbor. He's rich. Get him.
[2:03:12.780 --> 2:03:16.780]  I mean, Paul, it's happening. I can't even believe this.
[2:03:16.780 --> 2:03:23.780]  Well, top political scientists are now just saying that the U.K. is a totalitarian state.
[2:03:23.780 --> 2:03:25.780]  There's no doubt about it anymore.
[2:03:25.780 --> 2:03:29.780]  And this is a campaign by Gloucestershire police force
[2:03:29.780 --> 2:03:35.780]  who incidentally were the same police force who arrested Robin Page
[2:03:35.780 --> 2:03:39.780]  for saying that farming groups should have the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[2:03:39.780 --> 2:03:44.780]  They're also the same police force that set up Operation Natkin,
[2:03:44.780 --> 2:03:48.780]  which is where they sent out police officers to sit in curry houses
[2:03:48.780 --> 2:03:56.780]  and spy on people's conversations to check if they had, if they said any racial terms and arrests were made.
[2:03:56.780 --> 2:04:03.780]  Who is this demon in the middle? I mean, he looks like the epitome of a thug of a jackboot.
[2:04:03.780 --> 2:04:08.780]  I mean, that guy would be, if I was a big filmmaker making a new 1984,
[2:04:08.780 --> 2:04:10.780]  he would be an interparty official.
[2:04:10.780 --> 2:04:17.780]  I mean, I would come to him and say, we want to cast you as a piece of absolute degenerate parasitical trash.
[2:04:17.780 --> 2:04:21.780]  It looks like the chief constable to me, but I'm not sure.
[2:04:21.780 --> 2:04:25.780]  But yeah, it's a campaign put out by the police,
[2:04:25.780 --> 2:04:32.780]  which encourages people to report on other citizens who drive nice cars or buy expensive items.
[2:04:32.780 --> 2:04:34.780]  This has just meant to get everybody taddling on everybody.
[2:04:34.780 --> 2:04:35.780]  Stay there, Paul. One more segment.
[2:04:35.780 --> 2:04:37.780]  We want to get Kurt Nemo's take on this.
[2:04:37.780 --> 2:04:39.780]  And they're doing the same stuff here.
[2:04:39.780 --> 2:04:43.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, they are moving on everybody full force.
[2:04:43.780 --> 2:04:47.780]  They're not just saying Michael Savage will be arrested if he comes to England.
[2:04:47.780 --> 2:04:51.780]  I mean, they're going after me. They're shutting me off everywhere.
[2:04:51.780 --> 2:04:55.780]  I mean, we're under attack because these people mean to make us their slaves
[2:04:55.780 --> 2:04:58.780]  and they know that some of us aren't going along with them.
[2:04:58.780 --> 2:05:00.780]  Little punk.
[2:05:00.780 --> 2:05:07.780]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[2:05:07.780 --> 2:05:12.780]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[2:05:12.780 --> 2:05:17.780]  Alcovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[2:05:17.780 --> 2:05:25.780]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[2:05:25.780 --> 2:05:30.780]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[2:05:30.780 --> 2:05:36.780]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[2:05:36.780 --> 2:05:42.780]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[2:05:42.780 --> 2:05:48.780]  Order your bottle of Alcovision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to alcovision.com.
[2:05:48.780 --> 2:05:51.780]  That's alkavision.com.

[2:06:00.780 --> 2:06:06.780]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:06:06.780 --> 2:06:14.780]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[2:06:14.780 --> 2:06:20.780]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[2:06:20.780 --> 2:06:25.780]  Well Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:06:25.780 --> 2:06:36.780]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:06:36.780 --> 2:06:40.780]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:06:40.780 --> 2:06:47.780]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[2:06:47.780 --> 2:07:00.780]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[2:07:00.780 --> 2:07:03.780]  You worry, if you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[2:07:03.780 --> 2:07:06.780]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[2:07:06.780 --> 2:07:11.780]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember there's a learning curve.
[2:07:11.780 --> 2:07:13.780]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[2:07:13.780 --> 2:07:18.780]  To speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it. Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[2:07:18.780 --> 2:07:21.780]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[2:07:21.780 --> 2:07:25.780]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[2:07:25.780 --> 2:07:29.780]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[2:07:29.780 --> 2:07:33.780]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[2:07:33.780 --> 2:07:40.780]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[2:07:40.780 --> 2:07:44.780]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal. She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[2:07:44.780 --> 2:07:49.780]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51eatfree.
[2:07:49.780 --> 2:07:51.780]  Start now. Knowledge is power.
[2:07:51.780 --> 2:07:54.780]  Better take action. I think a storm's coming.
[2:07:54.780 --> 2:08:00.780]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:08:00.780 --> 2:08:03.780]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:08:03.780 --> 2:08:07.780]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:07.780 --> 2:08:12.780]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:12.780 --> 2:08:14.780]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:08:14.780 --> 2:08:17.780]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:08:17.780 --> 2:08:21.780]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:21.780 --> 2:08:29.780]  There goes. Bego Mortensen and a lot of other folks are in the film, and is reclaiming the blade.
[2:08:29.780 --> 2:08:37.780]  And we are going to have Daniel McNichol, the filmmaker, on to talk about it.
[2:08:37.780 --> 2:08:42.780]  Because it gets into how the general public was disarmed.
[2:08:42.780 --> 2:08:45.780]  It gets into how the right to keep their arms.
[2:08:45.780 --> 2:08:50.780]  Very important and how swordplay is, coming back into the culture.
[2:08:50.780 --> 2:08:55.180]  And by the way, you know, there's a joke, they could disarm us, but if we had knives,
[2:08:55.180 --> 2:09:00.700]  which everybody does, you could, you know, get a weapon, get a firearm very, very quickly.
[2:09:00.700 --> 2:09:06.160]  So it is good to know how to use a knife or a sword and it's a lot of fun.
[2:09:06.160 --> 2:09:08.660]  So I'm interested a little bit in it.
[2:09:08.660 --> 2:09:13.420]  And so we're going to be, we're going to be going over that.
[2:09:13.420 --> 2:09:16.280]  Can somebody email me and tell me how to get rid of fruit flies?
[2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:17.280]  There's no food.
[2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:18.280]  There's no water.
[2:09:18.280 --> 2:09:19.860]  There's nothing open around the office.
[2:09:19.860 --> 2:09:21.220]  And it just gets worse and worse.
[2:09:21.220 --> 2:09:24.660]  Earlier I was running and raving in the first hour and one flew in my mouth and into my,
[2:09:24.660 --> 2:09:28.540]  you know, you've ever been riding a bicycle, almost little gnats going your throat.
[2:09:28.540 --> 2:09:30.860]  You open the front door out there and there's just millions of them.
[2:09:30.860 --> 2:09:33.060]  You know, they're flying around in swarms.
[2:09:33.060 --> 2:09:37.100]  They got in the office and I don't know if you can see them flying by.
[2:09:37.100 --> 2:09:38.500]  It's like, me there went one.
[2:09:38.500 --> 2:09:42.340]  I mean, yeah, I can barely keep my focus.
[2:09:42.340 --> 2:09:44.860]  They're landing on my nose.
[2:09:44.860 --> 2:09:45.860]  Battle continues though.
[2:09:45.860 --> 2:09:47.940]  We're, we're, we're in here defeating them.
[2:09:47.940 --> 2:09:48.940]  Hopefully.
[2:09:48.940 --> 2:09:49.940]  There's no doubt about that.
[2:09:49.940 --> 2:09:52.300]  Uh, Kurt Nemo, you hear what Paul Watson is talking about.
[2:09:52.300 --> 2:09:55.300]  We're going to go back to him in a moment, but this is happening everywhere.
[2:09:55.300 --> 2:09:58.060]  This is to get everybody to tattle on everybody.
[2:09:58.060 --> 2:10:01.420]  You read all these federal reports here in the U S. They're identical to the ones in
[2:10:01.420 --> 2:10:03.580]  England and Canada and Germany and Europe.
[2:10:03.580 --> 2:10:05.180]  It's does your neighbor have a cell phone?
[2:10:05.180 --> 2:10:06.340]  Are they nice to police?
[2:10:06.340 --> 2:10:08.820]  Do they want to be involved in community stuff?
[2:10:08.820 --> 2:10:14.180]  They're probably a secret right wing terrorist and you're, and then now they're announcing
[2:10:14.180 --> 2:10:18.740]  restrictions on free speech and anybody in the DHS reports listed as extremists won't
[2:10:18.740 --> 2:10:20.460]  be able to own guns.
[2:10:20.460 --> 2:10:24.540]  Exactly what White House chief of staff said in speeches and still the public can't believe
[2:10:24.540 --> 2:10:25.540]  it.
[2:10:25.540 --> 2:10:26.540]  I can't believe it.
[2:10:26.540 --> 2:10:29.900]  I mean, we knew they were going to set this up, but to have them coming right out and
[2:10:29.900 --> 2:10:32.180]  going, yeah, we're going to take your free speech and take your guns.
[2:10:32.180 --> 2:10:37.580]  I mean, without a judge or jury, what's, and then now in England report your neighbor if
[2:10:37.580 --> 2:10:40.260]  they smoke cigars or wear a suit and tie.
[2:10:40.260 --> 2:10:43.500]  It says they shouldn't have that much money in this recession.
[2:10:43.500 --> 2:10:46.660]  Get money from the government to start spying on your neighbor.
[2:10:46.660 --> 2:10:48.460]  Ask your neighbor's questions.
[2:10:48.460 --> 2:10:51.460]  We're going to go to Paul Watson in a moment and that the 20 after we got our next guest
[2:10:51.460 --> 2:10:52.460]  coming up.
[2:10:52.460 --> 2:10:53.940]  But, but Kurt Nemo, your take on this.
[2:10:53.940 --> 2:11:00.220]  Well, this is kind of, you know, it reminds me of Orwell of 1984, the junior spies who
[2:11:00.220 --> 2:11:03.260]  were spying on Winston Smith, you know, it's the same thing.
[2:11:03.260 --> 2:11:09.180]  It's a classic attribute of totalitarianism happened in red China with, it happened with
[2:11:09.180 --> 2:11:10.700]  the Hitler Ugen in Germany.
[2:11:10.700 --> 2:11:16.140]  Um, it, you know, it's a, it's a, a, uh, it's a standard procedure and that's precisely
[2:11:16.140 --> 2:11:17.140]  what they're doing.
[2:11:17.140 --> 2:11:19.500]  Class warfare warfare works wonderfully.
[2:11:19.500 --> 2:11:24.820]  Well, they also, you know, aren't even denying any of this anymore.
[2:11:24.820 --> 2:11:28.180]  I mean, we were brought up that China restricted free speech and it was a police state.
[2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:31.260]  We were brought up that Russia did that.
[2:11:31.260 --> 2:11:39.900]  Uh, we were brought up that all of this was going on and happening and then Chinese style
[2:11:39.900 --> 2:11:45.380]  net censorship where they block things, block IPs, have firewalls where they have government
[2:11:45.380 --> 2:11:46.380]  gatekeepers.
[2:11:46.380 --> 2:11:49.660]  The New York times comes out and says, we need a kindler, gentler internet that doesn't
[2:11:49.660 --> 2:11:53.820]  let the general public blog without licenses and you'll get felony charges if you hurt
[2:11:53.820 --> 2:11:57.580]  someone's feelings and you'll have to have a sub domain on a bigger domain.
[2:11:57.580 --> 2:12:01.820]  So you have no rights and they say we're going to gate keep and take your free speech for
[2:12:01.820 --> 2:12:07.060]  your own interest and they're openly phasing in Chinese net style censorship where they're
[2:12:07.060 --> 2:12:11.860]  purging all the Alex Jones videos and the media just goes, so what?
[2:12:11.860 --> 2:12:18.020]  Because the old media has to kill us, they can't put up with a level playing field because
[2:12:18.020 --> 2:12:19.700]  we're telling the truth and they're not.
[2:12:19.700 --> 2:12:20.700]  Yeah.
[2:12:20.700 --> 2:12:25.380]  And as well, the corporate structure can't, you know, cotton, the fact that Alex Jones
[2:12:25.380 --> 2:12:29.140]  is on there talking the truth, you know, I mean, take a look at what's happening to
[2:12:29.140 --> 2:12:30.140]  YouTube.
[2:12:30.140 --> 2:12:33.700]  It's being, you know, turning into the next Hulu, you know, it's turning into a corporate
[2:12:33.700 --> 2:12:38.140]  base for, for their commercials and their, and their, you know, their cartoons and their
[2:12:38.140 --> 2:12:39.140]  TV shows.
[2:12:39.140 --> 2:12:44.500]  Yeah, well, we told people that we've seen this with other web systems and we know the
[2:12:44.500 --> 2:12:49.380]  globalist tactics of phasing things in and I went, would go in and we write articles
[2:12:49.380 --> 2:12:53.620]  where Google three years ago put out corporate reports about the model they were going to
[2:12:53.620 --> 2:12:58.220]  phase in the next few years and how they were going to get rid of, you know, most of the
[2:12:58.220 --> 2:13:02.020]  user videos and only have selected people they choose.
[2:13:02.020 --> 2:13:05.700]  They're going to use a very high standard of micromanaging and, you know, the contractions
[2:13:05.700 --> 2:13:11.380]  sign digitally to, to be on there where they can suspend you for no reason.
[2:13:11.380 --> 2:13:13.260]  And that's now happening.
[2:13:13.260 --> 2:13:16.380]  And we told people they were phasing out two years ago, we said they're starting to phase
[2:13:16.380 --> 2:13:17.960]  out Google video.
[2:13:17.960 --> 2:13:21.180]  Now they've completely phased it out, no more uploading to it.
[2:13:21.180 --> 2:13:26.260]  They're now doing the same phase out the same way they did it, restricting views, knocking
[2:13:26.260 --> 2:13:32.100]  channels off, killing or locking down videos when they hit, you know, the top videos and
[2:13:32.100 --> 2:13:35.540]  then turning them back on later when they're out of the top 100, getting rid of the top
[2:13:35.540 --> 2:13:41.300]  100 or most viewed in the front page, making it popular, just what they want to push, relegating
[2:13:41.300 --> 2:13:43.740]  user videos to sub pages.
[2:13:43.740 --> 2:13:48.340]  The innocuous peddlum stays on there, the volleyball girls and all that stuff remains.
[2:13:48.340 --> 2:13:49.940]  Well, exactly.
[2:13:49.940 --> 2:13:52.660]  But I mean, the issue is they really are killing YouTube right now.
[2:13:52.660 --> 2:13:54.340]  I mean, they really are shutting it down.
[2:13:54.340 --> 2:13:58.940]  They are phasing it out, but they know through domestication tactics of mind control.
[2:13:58.940 --> 2:14:01.820]  Same way you domesticate a horse or a cow or pig or a dog.
[2:14:01.820 --> 2:14:08.500]  They are easing us into this and I tell people, look, you know, Google admittedly is run by
[2:14:08.500 --> 2:14:12.940]  NASA and the NSA and here's the CIA agent and the founding documents and they give
[2:14:12.940 --> 2:14:16.660]  all their money to eugenics and, you know, here's their own, you know, charitable giving
[2:14:16.660 --> 2:14:20.820]  billions a year and people just say, no, it's not, it's not happening, Alex.
[2:14:20.820 --> 2:14:21.820]  Don't fear monger.
[2:14:21.820 --> 2:14:22.820]  Paul Watson.
[2:14:22.820 --> 2:14:27.140]  I want to get back into this whole Stasi thing, but before we forget, get into this Google
[2:14:27.140 --> 2:14:28.140]  situation.
[2:14:28.140 --> 2:14:35.500]  Well, that's right, the other day Google officially suspended all video uploads.
[2:14:35.500 --> 2:14:39.820]  They said they were going to do that up to a year ago, I remember them saying that and
[2:14:39.820 --> 2:14:41.380]  they went ahead and did it.
[2:14:41.380 --> 2:14:49.340]  The thing with YouTube is that they now on their news and politics page, for example,
[2:14:49.340 --> 2:14:53.620]  they don't put the videos on there that are watched by the most amount of people.
[2:14:53.620 --> 2:14:59.020]  They select the videos and the videos in news and politics and aren't very much different
[2:14:59.020 --> 2:15:03.660]  from the ones on the front page, you know, it's like it is drunk football as staggering
[2:15:03.660 --> 2:15:04.660]  around.
[2:15:04.660 --> 2:15:05.660]  That's right.
[2:15:05.660 --> 2:15:11.980]  Every, every day they post the amazing atheists and it'll have like 20 views.
[2:15:11.980 --> 2:15:14.940]  They post him and by the end of the day he's got 100,000 views.
[2:15:14.940 --> 2:15:19.820]  Meanwhile, we'll have videos that get 300,000 views in a day never on the front page.
[2:15:19.820 --> 2:15:24.700]  I mean, they admit that they are phasing it all out folks, it's happening.
[2:15:24.700 --> 2:15:32.340]  I mean, it's because it's an unsustainable business model, YouTube, a deep in the red.
[2:15:32.340 --> 2:15:37.020]  But unlike what would normally happen and that you would take advertising, they're
[2:15:37.020 --> 2:15:42.220]  just going to hand over the control of their entire content to these big Hollywood production
[2:15:42.220 --> 2:15:43.220]  studios.
[2:15:43.220 --> 2:15:47.660]  And when that happens, there's no place on there for the Alex Jones channel, the info
[2:15:47.660 --> 2:15:48.660]  warrior.
[2:15:48.660 --> 2:15:52.580]  What they do is they, they know the model and I've talked to a lot of CEOs and media
[2:15:52.580 --> 2:15:56.060]  people, they go, Alex, we know you'd be the biggest thing in the country or anybody else
[2:15:56.060 --> 2:15:57.060]  like you.
[2:15:57.060 --> 2:16:00.180]  We know this Patriot anti-New World Order stuff is the hottest thing.
[2:16:00.180 --> 2:16:02.260]  We know the whole world's in rebellion.
[2:16:02.260 --> 2:16:07.940]  And so what they do is they give the people a platform for a time to get us addicted and
[2:16:07.940 --> 2:16:09.300]  then they just take it away.
[2:16:09.300 --> 2:16:13.540]  They, they, they want to dominate market share and YouTube is bigger than all other video
[2:16:13.540 --> 2:16:15.580]  sharing sites combined.
[2:16:15.580 --> 2:16:20.020]  You can look at the graphs and statistics and so they've dominated the market with freedom
[2:16:20.020 --> 2:16:22.580]  of speech and now they're getting rid of it.
[2:16:22.580 --> 2:16:27.780]  And because they're moving in with internet too to shut down the other sites, they couldn't
[2:16:27.780 --> 2:16:31.780]  do that till they were ready to shut down the others or everybody would just leave.
[2:16:31.780 --> 2:16:35.660]  That's my point is they're moving in with what Jay Rockefeller said shutting down the
[2:16:35.660 --> 2:16:36.660]  web.
[2:16:36.660 --> 2:16:37.660]  Go ahead, Paul.
[2:16:37.660 --> 2:16:38.660]  That's right.
[2:16:38.660 --> 2:16:44.980]  I mean, Rupert Murdoch said it a few days ago that the internet and its current form
[2:16:44.980 --> 2:16:52.460]  cannot go on, that it's going to end because they've lost a huge amount of their audience.
[2:16:52.460 --> 2:16:59.620]  I'm talking about people like News Corporation with Fox News and New York Post and new papers
[2:16:59.620 --> 2:17:00.620]  like that.
[2:17:00.620 --> 2:17:02.980]  And again, these people mean business.
[2:17:02.980 --> 2:17:06.660]  They do everything they say they're going to do or they try it and they, and they never
[2:17:06.660 --> 2:17:07.660]  quit.
[2:17:07.660 --> 2:17:08.660]  They come back again and again.
[2:17:08.660 --> 2:17:12.500]  They're saying everywhere for seven years at internet two conferences in Austin, Texas
[2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:14.940]  and London and Tokyo, read the minutes.
[2:17:14.940 --> 2:17:17.420]  They are going to kill the web and how they do it.
[2:17:17.420 --> 2:17:19.180]  And I told you how they do it.
[2:17:19.180 --> 2:17:20.860]  People all shut up, Alex.
[2:17:20.860 --> 2:17:23.580]  That it, look, it's happening, folks.
[2:17:23.580 --> 2:17:24.780]  I'm sorry, Paul, to interrupt you.
[2:17:24.780 --> 2:17:26.740]  I'm just so angry about this.
[2:17:26.740 --> 2:17:33.720]  No, I mean, we, we said it all in early 2006, right when MySpace was taken off.
[2:17:33.720 --> 2:17:36.340]  We wrote an article saying it's a Trojan horse.
[2:17:36.340 --> 2:17:42.340]  It's designed to centralize power on the internet, get everybody to use MySpace as their
[2:17:42.340 --> 2:17:43.340]  little blog.
[2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:48.100]  And so, you know, when MySpace says that you can't have this political opinion or that
[2:17:48.100 --> 2:17:51.060]  political opinion, that's it, your account suspended.
[2:17:51.060 --> 2:17:54.300]  And we have their own internal documents and they've admitted I am banned.
[2:17:54.300 --> 2:17:56.760]  They don't let me send our bulletins or videos.
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:17:58.060]  They let us have the page.
[2:17:58.060 --> 2:17:59.900]  We know we really have hundreds of thousands of members.
[2:17:59.900 --> 2:18:02.860]  They've frozen us at 55,000 and they admit they do it.
[2:18:02.860 --> 2:18:05.380]  We have their own moderators going, yeah, you're banned.
[2:18:05.380 --> 2:18:08.100]  Prison, planet and info wars are not allowed to be shared on MySpace.
[2:18:08.100 --> 2:18:11.860]  It's all, but then they lie to the public though and say they're not doing it.
[2:18:11.860 --> 2:18:13.940]  Meanwhile, in England, Paul, you were trying to finish up.
[2:18:13.940 --> 2:18:16.220]  I'm going to hold you guys over again, move the guest back.
[2:18:16.220 --> 2:18:17.220]  I apologize to the guest.
[2:18:17.220 --> 2:18:19.220]  We're going to really love the movie and we're going to plug it.
[2:18:19.220 --> 2:18:21.860]  Just I've got to finish up with five more minutes with you guys.
[2:18:21.860 --> 2:18:24.380]  Meanwhile, we've got to fight this.
[2:18:24.380 --> 2:18:27.860]  And I try to tell them the listeners, use YouTube, you can't use Google.
[2:18:27.860 --> 2:18:31.340]  I kept saying use Google before they shut down Google video gone.
[2:18:31.340 --> 2:18:32.340]  Use YouTube.
[2:18:32.340 --> 2:18:35.820]  I'd say we're six months out from complete control unless we fight it.
[2:18:35.820 --> 2:18:40.780]  There's enough of a rebellion they may back off and doppelgang copy all our videos to
[2:18:40.780 --> 2:18:43.500]  every other major video site, blip TV, you name it.
[2:18:43.500 --> 2:18:45.940]  But folks, we got to do this now.
[2:18:45.940 --> 2:18:48.900]  Who are they censoring me because we're effective, Kurt Nemo?
[2:18:48.900 --> 2:18:53.460]  Well, they don't have the resources as well to stop people from uploading unless they
[2:18:53.460 --> 2:18:56.900]  ban uploading altogether like Google plans to do.
[2:18:56.900 --> 2:19:01.780]  You know, so people can go in there and post your videos and it's kind of like whack a
[2:19:01.780 --> 2:19:02.780]  mole to them.
[2:19:02.780 --> 2:19:05.540]  You know, they're going to have to keep trying to get rid of them and it's going to be hard
[2:19:05.540 --> 2:19:10.660]  to do until they totally ban, you know, like Google has any kind of upload.
[2:19:10.660 --> 2:19:11.660]  Exactly.
[2:19:11.660 --> 2:19:13.740]  Well, my point is we are now here.
[2:19:13.740 --> 2:19:17.980]  They're now announcing that they've got bills introduced that will say you'll be a felony
[2:19:17.980 --> 2:19:20.940]  arrested if you criticize someone and they say they hurt their feelings.
[2:19:20.940 --> 2:19:23.300]  They sign up at David saying my feelings are hurt.
[2:19:23.300 --> 2:19:27.020]  Five years in prison, $200,000 fine, federal prison, mainstream.
[2:19:27.020 --> 2:19:29.340]  They got bills to ban guns, mainstream.
[2:19:29.340 --> 2:19:32.740]  The Attorney General saying if I don't like you, you won't own a gun and you'll never
[2:19:32.740 --> 2:19:34.260]  be able to get off the list.
[2:19:34.260 --> 2:19:35.260]  Mainstream.
[2:19:35.260 --> 2:19:40.500]  I mean, you know, 14 plus trillion stolen in seven months, mainstream, FEMA camps being
[2:19:40.500 --> 2:19:41.500]  built.
[2:19:41.500 --> 2:19:42.500]  Mainstream.
[2:19:42.500 --> 2:19:49.340]  I mean, it's all, they're taking over now and they're going to kill the web as you
[2:19:49.340 --> 2:19:50.340]  know it.
[2:19:50.340 --> 2:19:54.220]  That's why we're on AM and FM, short way, but they're saying they're going to censor
[2:19:54.220 --> 2:19:59.700]  with fairness doctrine that that's why we got DVDs, you know, but I may get arrested
[2:19:59.700 --> 2:20:00.700]  folks.
[2:20:00.700 --> 2:20:01.700]  I mean.
[2:20:01.700 --> 2:20:05.260]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins
[2:20:05.260 --> 2:20:06.260]  or herbal supplements?
[2:20:06.260 --> 2:20:10.620]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos and toothpaste contain chemical
[2:20:10.620 --> 2:20:15.180]  additives such as sodium, laurel, sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[2:20:15.180 --> 2:20:18.740]  Did you know that many moldy vitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[2:20:18.740 --> 2:20:22.020]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[2:20:22.020 --> 2:20:24.620]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[2:21:01.100 --> 2:21:05.300]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[2:21:05.300 --> 2:21:07.780]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[2:21:07.780 --> 2:21:12.860]  Unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[2:21:12.860 --> 2:21:15.900]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:21:15.900 --> 2:21:20.180]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[2:21:20.180 --> 2:21:24.100]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[2:21:24.100 --> 2:21:27.860]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[2:21:27.860 --> 2:21:29.100]  from Jekyll Island.
[2:21:29.100 --> 2:21:33.300]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[2:21:33.300 --> 2:21:38.260]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[2:21:38.260 --> 2:21:42.740]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who

[2:22:07.180 --> 2:22:11.700]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[2:22:11.700 --> 2:22:13.020]  us would like to see.
[2:22:13.020 --> 2:22:18.180]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:22:18.180 --> 2:22:19.540]  of the American people.
[2:22:19.540 --> 2:22:23.900]  Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one of this election.
[2:22:23.900 --> 2:22:29.020]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:22:29.020 --> 2:22:37.140]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[2:22:37.140 --> 2:22:40.700]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:22:40.700 --> 2:22:47.620]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:22:55.820 --> 2:23:01.140]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[2:23:01.140 --> 2:23:04.860]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[2:23:04.860 --> 2:23:08.980]  problems facing the U.S. and the world, and for the first time in their lives, they are
[2:23:08.980 --> 2:23:11.100]  feeling the need for preparedness.
[2:23:11.100 --> 2:23:15.580]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated
[2:23:15.580 --> 2:23:17.580]  foods for almost 40 years.
[2:23:17.580 --> 2:23:22.260]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[2:23:22.260 --> 2:23:27.060]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish, with doubly-nameled cans and nitrogen
[2:23:27.060 --> 2:23:28.060]  packaging.
[2:23:28.060 --> 2:23:32.500]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[2:23:32.500 --> 2:23:36.220]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve
[2:23:36.220 --> 2:23:38.340]  ships within five business days.
[2:23:38.340 --> 2:23:42.260]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog, we will be more than happy to send a catalog
[2:23:42.260 --> 2:23:52.860]  to you, free of charge, dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.

[2:23:58.860 --> 2:24:13.140]  At the end of the show today, I'm going to announce two new films, that's a little surprise,
[2:24:13.140 --> 2:24:19.140]  two new films that we made in the last month here, very quietly.
[2:24:19.140 --> 2:24:24.620]  So that's coming up at the end of the show today, the next segment reclaiming the blade,
[2:24:24.620 --> 2:24:26.620]  amazing film.
[2:24:26.620 --> 2:24:32.820]  This sucker just can't put it down, and no, we're not selling it, but we ought to.
[2:24:32.820 --> 2:24:37.260]  So that's coming up, then your calls continually in the last hour, just blitzing your phone
[2:24:37.260 --> 2:24:39.260]  calls.
[2:24:39.260 --> 2:24:45.900]  Here's one of the new films, oh, I'm going to be showing that to folks later at the end
[2:24:45.900 --> 2:24:50.700]  of the show, so wait for that surprise, very proud of my crew and what they've done everybody
[2:24:50.700 --> 2:24:51.700]  here together.
[2:24:51.700 --> 2:24:56.060]  Okay, in closing, I'm obnoxious and I'm not letting Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson talk, because
[2:24:56.060 --> 2:25:00.580]  everything they say freaks me out, makes me want to expose more stuff I'm thinking of,
[2:25:00.580 --> 2:25:04.380]  because it's so incredible that we're actually going into real tyranny.
[2:25:04.380 --> 2:25:09.420]  Paul Watson closing comments on the censorship, the attack on free speech, England saying,
[2:25:09.420 --> 2:25:13.020]  spy on your neighbors if they're wearing nice jewelry, they show a picture of a guy with
[2:25:13.020 --> 2:25:17.460]  a boat in his yard and say, call the cops if your neighbor has things that are nice, ask
[2:25:17.460 --> 2:25:22.220]  them questions about what they make, I mean, they've done the bait and switch from, this
[2:25:22.220 --> 2:25:26.460]  is for terrorism to, this is for a tax collection, this is getting bad.
[2:25:26.460 --> 2:25:32.620]  They're basically trying to get the population all suspicious of each other and so, you know,
[2:25:32.620 --> 2:25:36.740]  it creates a kind of self-regulation of the Starzy police state.
[2:25:36.740 --> 2:25:42.860]  The previous poster campaigns put out by the London Metropolitan Police say that the people
[2:25:42.860 --> 2:25:47.420]  who look at CCTV cameras are suspicious.
[2:25:47.420 --> 2:25:53.820]  People that own mobile phones, computers, white vans, and people who live in apartments
[2:25:53.820 --> 2:25:56.900]  are suspicious and potentially terrorists.
[2:25:56.900 --> 2:26:03.100]  People who return items bought at a store and get a refund on their credit card are potential
[2:26:03.100 --> 2:26:07.660]  terrorists and the list goes on and on, we've got a link to those previous articles.
[2:26:07.660 --> 2:26:12.540]  So basically, they're just classifying the whole population as potential terrorists,
[2:26:12.540 --> 2:26:17.780]  so that everybody watches and informs on each other and creates this Starzy state that
[2:26:17.780 --> 2:26:18.780]  they want.
[2:26:18.780 --> 2:26:26.660]  Well, that was certainly well said and again, this isn't close to classical hardcore tyranny.
[2:26:26.660 --> 2:26:29.180]  This is overblown.
[2:26:29.180 --> 2:26:31.540]  I mean, this is the real McCoy.
[2:26:31.540 --> 2:26:32.540]  This was wrestling.
[2:26:32.540 --> 2:26:33.540]  This is the rock.
[2:26:33.540 --> 2:26:35.740]  This is Hulk Hogan.
[2:26:35.740 --> 2:26:38.300]  This is, you know, Andre the Giant.
[2:26:38.300 --> 2:26:43.100]  I mean, this is, I mean, this is Hitler level.
[2:26:43.100 --> 2:26:44.420]  This is Stalin level.
[2:26:44.420 --> 2:26:46.700]  This is Mal level what they're attempting.
[2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:47.700]  There's no doubt.
[2:26:47.700 --> 2:26:48.700]  Okay.
[2:26:48.700 --> 2:26:53.020]  Folks, I'm not just saying that, and we didn't just say this was an engineered flu virus.
[2:26:53.020 --> 2:26:54.020]  It's now come out.
[2:26:54.020 --> 2:26:55.020]  It clearly was.
[2:26:55.020 --> 2:26:56.020]  Kurt Nemo.
[2:26:56.020 --> 2:27:01.900]  And as well, this whole paranoia, this social paranoia there and gendering, and how complements
[2:27:01.900 --> 2:27:05.300]  their electronic police state that they're putting in, you know, where everything you
[2:27:05.300 --> 2:27:10.140]  do, every website you go to, every credit card transaction you make, every cell phone
[2:27:10.140 --> 2:27:12.620]  call you make is put into a database.
[2:27:12.620 --> 2:27:17.420]  So, you know, this complements that as well, and you know, it's just, it's just the next
[2:27:17.420 --> 2:27:18.420]  level up there.
[2:27:18.420 --> 2:27:19.420]  They're ratcheting up.
[2:27:19.420 --> 2:27:22.020]  And what's going on in England is going to end up coming here sooner or later.
[2:27:22.020 --> 2:27:23.020]  No, it's already here.
[2:27:23.020 --> 2:27:27.260]  Remember a year ago when they announced huge cash bonuses for tattling on your neighbors
[2:27:27.260 --> 2:27:32.540]  and spies to spy for the IRS and that the IRS no longer has to have warrants and that
[2:27:32.540 --> 2:27:37.900]  was going to increase its enforcers, but only on blue collar and middle class, none, literally
[2:27:37.900 --> 2:27:39.860]  almost none for the rich.
[2:27:39.860 --> 2:27:42.140]  It's really, it's really in your face over there.
[2:27:42.140 --> 2:27:45.540]  They've got posters and stuff, you know, what I'm telling you to spy on your neighbors.
[2:27:45.540 --> 2:27:46.540]  No, I know.
[2:27:46.540 --> 2:27:47.540]  I agree with you, Kurt.
[2:27:47.540 --> 2:27:48.540]  I agree.
[2:27:48.540 --> 2:27:50.700]  I mean, England's about three, four years ahead of us watching.
[2:27:50.700 --> 2:27:52.580]  You got to get out of there as bad as the U.S. is.
[2:27:52.580 --> 2:27:53.740]  You got to get over here, bro.
[2:27:53.740 --> 2:27:57.460]  I mean, I mean, that place, they're now announcing they're going to arrest everybody.
[2:27:57.460 --> 2:27:59.020]  This is out of the Wisconsin news.
[2:27:59.020 --> 2:28:03.940]  Secret rules, secret GPS tracking without a warrant is now legal and they say no more
[2:28:03.940 --> 2:28:06.980]  warrants for cops to stick GPS on your car.
[2:28:06.980 --> 2:28:11.100]  On top of that, England has announced what we said not only will satellite tracker boxes
[2:28:11.100 --> 2:28:14.700]  being all your cars taxing you by the mile up to a pound a mile.
[2:28:14.700 --> 2:28:17.860]  That's two dollars a mile basically or almost two dollars.
[2:28:17.860 --> 2:28:22.380]  They're now announcing it will regulate and control your car speed with automatic shutoff
[2:28:22.380 --> 2:28:23.580]  for the police.
[2:28:23.580 --> 2:28:24.580]  That's BBC.
[2:28:24.580 --> 2:28:27.020]  I mean, and they're now announcing it here.
[2:28:27.020 --> 2:28:32.060]  I mean, my God, the government remote controlling your car is big brother, folks.
[2:28:32.060 --> 2:28:33.060]  Cameras in school bathrooms.
[2:28:33.060 --> 2:28:35.540]  I mean, that's why I'm Paul Watson.
[2:28:35.540 --> 2:28:40.460]  Well, the good news is, Alex, the harder they push, the more people see what's happening
[2:28:40.460 --> 2:28:41.460]  around them.
[2:28:41.460 --> 2:28:48.820]  Case in point regarding the Internet again, lycos.com, top 50 searches.
[2:28:48.820 --> 2:28:53.380]  You've got Facebook, Wikipedia, Drudge Report, Twitter.
[2:28:53.380 --> 2:28:55.020]  Who else is on there?
[2:28:55.020 --> 2:29:05.020]  Alex Jones, Infowars, GCN Live, Steve Quayle, so in the top 50 searches with Facebook, Twitter,
[2:29:05.020 --> 2:29:06.020]  Wikipedia.
[2:29:06.020 --> 2:29:07.020]  Wait a minute.
[2:29:07.020 --> 2:29:08.580]  We don't even toot our own horns.
[2:29:08.580 --> 2:29:12.060]  You're telling me that we're in the top 50 searches now?
[2:29:12.060 --> 2:29:15.580]  It's not Janet Jackson or Anna Nicole Smith.
[2:29:15.580 --> 2:29:16.580]  It's us.
[2:29:16.580 --> 2:29:17.580]  Exactly.
[2:29:17.580 --> 2:29:18.580]  On lycos.com.
[2:29:18.580 --> 2:29:20.580]  I've got the screenshots.
[2:29:20.580 --> 2:29:23.780]  Hey, I like that.
[2:29:23.780 --> 2:29:26.820]  No wonder the enemy is becoming obsessed with imperialism.
[2:29:26.820 --> 2:29:34.620]  We have a new enemy, Defeat Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, and Obi-Wan Alex Jones immediately.
[2:29:34.620 --> 2:29:40.660]  Hey, guys, look, regardless, we're going up against hardcore thugs and tyrants.
[2:29:40.660 --> 2:29:41.660]  It's one hell of a fight.
[2:29:41.660 --> 2:29:43.260]  Isn't life exciting, though, man?
[2:29:43.260 --> 2:29:44.860]  Is life not exciting, man?
[2:29:44.860 --> 2:29:45.860]  Yeah.
[2:29:45.860 --> 2:29:51.900]  Let me hear a war growl, both of you.
[2:29:51.900 --> 2:29:59.260]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:59.260 --> 2:30:01.980]  Hello, friends.
[2:30:01.980 --> 2:30:02.980]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:30:02.980 --> 2:30:06.780]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[2:30:06.780 --> 2:30:07.780]  important than ever.
[2:30:07.780 --> 2:30:10.740]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[2:30:10.740 --> 2:30:13.580]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[2:30:13.580 --> 2:30:17.540]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[2:30:17.540 --> 2:30:21.500]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[2:30:21.500 --> 2:30:23.100]  the final equation, but you.
[2:30:23.100 --> 2:30:27.460]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[2:30:27.460 --> 2:30:31.140]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[2:30:31.140 --> 2:30:33.380]  cost of last year's grocery prices.

[2:30:57.220 --> 2:31:01.820]  The first step is getting storable food.
[2:31:01.820 --> 2:31:07.700]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:31:07.700 --> 2:31:13.580]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:31:13.580 --> 2:31:15.220]  just as well funded.
[2:31:15.220 --> 2:31:20.380]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[2:31:20.380 --> 2:31:21.380]  of the American people.
[2:31:21.380 --> 2:31:26.300]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:31:26.300 --> 2:31:31.380]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:31:31.380 --> 2:31:37.900]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:31:37.900 --> 2:31:39.580]  It's not about left or right.
[2:31:39.580 --> 2:31:41.460]  It's about a one-world government.
[2:31:41.460 --> 2:31:48.380]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[2:31:48.380 --> 2:31:53.860]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in Super

[2:32:06.260 --> 2:32:10.260]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make
[2:32:10.260 --> 2:32:12.060]  it to your dinner table?

[2:33:08.380 --> 2:33:19.780]  Now watching this here at the office, it is on Discovery or History Channel or Nova Quality,
[2:33:19.780 --> 2:33:20.780]  and it's got all these huge actors, a lot of the folks from Lord of the Rings.
[2:33:20.780 --> 2:33:22.500]  I remember watching the making of Lord of the Rings, they had this sword master saying
[2:33:22.500 --> 2:33:28.260]  that Vigo was the best swordsman you've ever seen for an actor, and he trained hundreds,
[2:33:28.260 --> 2:33:29.940]  he was listing all the things he'd done.
[2:33:29.940 --> 2:33:33.220]  I think that guy's in here, I think I recognized him when I was watching at your office a few
[2:33:33.220 --> 2:33:38.340]  weeks ago when it came, and it turns out the maker of this is also a listener of the show,
[2:33:38.340 --> 2:33:43.460]  and so we appreciate Daniel McNichol for coming on, and it's just very, very exciting, and
[2:33:43.460 --> 2:33:47.220]  this thing is not out yet, so when it comes out we'll have him back on, maybe we'll even
[2:33:47.220 --> 2:33:52.580]  carry it, but I would hope this would be in theaters or on TV, I'm flattered that we've
[2:33:52.580 --> 2:33:56.060]  kind of gotten this first kind of a sneak peek here, I think I've been so busy I never
[2:33:56.060 --> 2:33:59.900]  even asked if we could play a clip or something, but whatever, it doesn't matter, maybe on
[2:33:59.900 --> 2:34:06.340]  the second time he comes on, but Daniel McNichol, thank you for coming on today, sir.
[2:34:06.340 --> 2:34:11.420]  It's my pleasure, Alex, and let me say it is a pleasure to be on your show, and you're
[2:34:11.420 --> 2:34:13.300]  a very good man, and keep up the great work.
[2:34:13.300 --> 2:34:18.780]  Well, I try, you're a great guy, because I always make the point, reading up on history,
[2:34:18.780 --> 2:34:25.020]  that going back to Rome, going back to the Samurai 500 years ago, 1000 years ago in Japan,
[2:34:25.020 --> 2:34:30.140]  going back to the Sun Kings in France, going back to the Tudors, the commoners, the slaves,
[2:34:30.140 --> 2:34:34.940]  couldn't own hunting dogs, couldn't have knives over a certain length with pointed ends, and
[2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:38.820]  of course, you cover that, that's what I love, is this is something with big stars, and a
[2:34:38.820 --> 2:34:44.780]  lot of folks that actually explained that having a blade was a thing of nobility, and
[2:34:44.780 --> 2:34:49.580]  that that's what nobility is, is force, and the ability to carry out force, you know.
[2:34:49.580 --> 2:34:55.140]  So your film is really pro self-defense as well, but that's only one facet of it, so
[2:34:55.140 --> 2:34:59.580]  it's great to have you here, and I'll tell you who's also a big fan, is our producer
[2:34:59.580 --> 2:35:03.380]  here, Rob Dew, because when he came to me at first, he said, I said, it's a show about
[2:35:03.380 --> 2:35:07.900]  swords, I go, I have sword fights with my kids, and you know, I fenced it about a third
[2:35:07.900 --> 2:35:14.420]  grade level, my dad was real good at fencing in college, and yeah, but so I know a little
[2:35:14.420 --> 2:35:18.900]  bit about it, but he said, no, no, watch the film, and I did, so it's great to have you
[2:35:18.900 --> 2:35:24.460]  here, the film is Reclaiming the Blade, why don't you say Reclaiming the Blade?
[2:35:24.460 --> 2:35:27.740]  Reclaiming the Blade is a movie, actually, I must say that it is, even though it won't
[2:35:27.740 --> 2:35:32.820]  be in stores, which is Bonzo Noble, and Target, and Best Buy, and Blockbuster, and all that
[2:35:32.820 --> 2:35:38.340]  type of stuff, that happens July 7th, but it actually is, we're being a bit sneaky,
[2:35:38.340 --> 2:35:41.700]  and we're going to go ahead, we've already gone ahead, and we're releasing it directly
[2:35:41.700 --> 2:35:46.900]  from Galatia Films Home Entertainment, which is our shingle production company that put
[2:35:46.900 --> 2:35:47.900]  this film out.
[2:35:47.900 --> 2:35:50.900]  Okay, how do folks get it then, how do folks get it right now then?
[2:35:50.900 --> 2:35:55.140]  SwordMovie.com, ReclaimingTheBlade.com, you can actually order the film, and it actually
[2:35:55.140 --> 2:35:59.700]  is a two disc set, so the second disc has a lot of great bonus features, there's like
[2:35:59.700 --> 2:36:05.060]  four hours of extra interviews with Vigo Mortisson, and some great stuff from what a workshop,
[2:36:05.060 --> 2:36:06.060]  because we went down to New Zealand, and it was a lot of fun.
[2:36:06.060 --> 2:36:10.500]  How did you get Vigo in this, I guess he's just a sword fanatics, what I've heard.
[2:36:10.500 --> 2:36:16.940]  Vigo is a great guy, and you know, I can't say enough good things about him, he really
[2:36:16.940 --> 2:36:22.820]  will do something, not based on money, but based on whether or not he thinks it's a
[2:36:22.820 --> 2:36:25.340]  passion project, you know what I mean?
[2:36:25.340 --> 2:36:29.220]  So that's what's great about him, he's not one of these Hollywood actors that's driven
[2:36:29.220 --> 2:36:30.900]  by dollars, you know?
[2:36:30.900 --> 2:36:36.340]  So he just, you know, felt like it was the right thing to do, and obviously one thing
[2:36:36.340 --> 2:36:40.700]  that attracted him was our tribute to Bob Anderson.
[2:36:40.700 --> 2:36:45.500]  So we did an exclusive with Bob, who was Darth Vader, he was actually in Darth Vader's
[2:36:45.500 --> 2:36:49.660]  costume, training Mark Hamill, doing all the lightsaber duels with him in the first
[2:36:49.660 --> 2:36:55.100]  early films, he's trained Johnny Dapp, who's also a big fan as well, and you know, he's
[2:36:55.100 --> 2:37:00.300]  worked with everyone from Arrow Flynn to, you know, to Vigo Morrison, he's just a legend
[2:37:00.300 --> 2:37:03.260]  in the industry when it comes to fight choreography.
[2:37:03.260 --> 2:37:09.500]  But the interesting thing about the film, when I was writing it, I really wanted to
[2:37:09.500 --> 2:37:19.220]  get into the script, some verbology, if you will, just some text in there that John Rhys
[2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:22.580]  Davies would read, because John Rhys Davies actually is a good friend of mine, he narrated
[2:37:22.580 --> 2:37:29.500]  the film, and I was fascinated with this idea of the kings, and basically the kings of England
[2:37:29.500 --> 2:37:32.620]  had two choices when they were looking at an army.
[2:37:32.620 --> 2:37:40.380]  They had a choice A, which was hire your own military, that is, pay for your nights, pay
[2:37:40.380 --> 2:37:47.260]  them money, you know, it's a financed army, so that's option A. Option B is let your
[2:37:47.260 --> 2:37:54.100]  whole country and your all of your nation and all of your boys 13 ages and up, you know,
[2:37:54.100 --> 2:37:58.620]  study the longbow, study the sword, and be capable with arms.
[2:37:58.620 --> 2:38:04.460]  Yeah, that was the Dutch and the Swiss model and others, was to raise your army as the
[2:38:04.460 --> 2:38:08.460]  militia, and those always turned out to be the countries that didn't get invaded, but
[2:38:08.460 --> 2:38:11.580]  if you had oppressive nobles, they didn't like to arm their people.
[2:38:11.580 --> 2:38:16.620]  So we think 1776 is where this keep and bear arms thing all began, no, it was a free man
[2:38:16.620 --> 2:38:17.620]  thing.
[2:38:17.620 --> 2:38:20.820]  People had arms in England, that's what the Magna Carta was all about.
[2:38:20.820 --> 2:38:24.580]  And that's what's so great about your film is that I think it's a great defense of the
[2:38:24.580 --> 2:38:25.580]  Second Amendment.
[2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:26.580]  Absolutely.
[2:38:26.580 --> 2:38:32.820]  And I'll just go ahead and say on record, John Rhys Davies is the, the Charlton Heston
[2:38:32.820 --> 2:38:33.820]  of today.
[2:38:33.820 --> 2:38:36.500]  I mean, he is a great defender of the Second Amendment.
[2:38:36.500 --> 2:38:39.540]  I don't really speak for any of the other actors, you know, they're great guys.
[2:38:39.540 --> 2:38:44.580]  I know Vigo's obviously a supporter of Dennis Kucinch, you know, and, and, yeah, for the
[2:38:44.580 --> 2:38:50.580]  anti-war thing, I know Vigo's act of the point is your film's message shows how fundamental
[2:38:50.580 --> 2:38:55.460]  people think we want swords or we want guns because we pet them and kiss them and it's
[2:38:55.460 --> 2:38:57.220]  our extension of our manhood.
[2:38:57.220 --> 2:38:59.420]  No, we know it is handed down.
[2:38:59.420 --> 2:39:02.140]  It is a sacred obligation that a free man is armed.
[2:39:02.140 --> 2:39:05.220]  A slave doesn't have access to weapons.
[2:39:05.220 --> 2:39:06.220]  Absolutely.
[2:39:06.220 --> 2:39:11.860]  And if you look at the greatest periods of English history, they weren't the dark ages
[2:39:11.860 --> 2:39:15.940]  where, you know, the knights, you know, were paid by the king.
[2:39:15.940 --> 2:39:21.300]  They were, they were in age where the king and, and, and as we know, English history
[2:39:21.300 --> 2:39:25.380]  is, is when you study English history, you look at the history of the monarchies, you
[2:39:25.380 --> 2:39:28.620]  know, which king was in power at any given time.
[2:39:28.620 --> 2:39:33.540]  And the kings that gave the power to the people, they, they were taking a risk in a way because
[2:39:33.540 --> 2:39:38.060]  if the people didn't like what the king was doing, they wouldn't support him.
[2:39:38.060 --> 2:39:40.860]  They'd say, I don't think so, you know.
[2:39:40.860 --> 2:39:44.900]  And so, but, but, so the king was, was beholden to the people and the people had a checks
[2:39:44.900 --> 2:39:47.700]  and balance that existed in the sword.
[2:39:47.700 --> 2:39:48.700]  Oh, exactly.
[2:39:48.700 --> 2:39:51.340]  So the sword is really a checks and balance, you know.
[2:39:51.340 --> 2:39:52.340]  That's it.
[2:39:52.340 --> 2:39:55.860]  You say it so simply instead of me sputtering and babbling it, it is a check and balance.
[2:39:55.860 --> 2:39:57.620]  It is a canary in the coal mine.
[2:39:57.620 --> 2:40:00.460]  It is a, a, a great equalizer.
[2:40:00.460 --> 2:40:06.020]  As the UN says, civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of
[2:40:06.020 --> 2:40:07.020]  the state.
[2:40:07.020 --> 2:40:10.700]  Well, we believe a power monopoly of the state is illegitimate, but that's why this film
[2:40:10.700 --> 2:40:11.700]  is so important.
[2:40:11.700 --> 2:40:12.980]  And I didn't know it was available today.
[2:40:12.980 --> 2:40:15.500]  I guess you just started offering it.
[2:40:15.500 --> 2:40:19.020]  So folks, tell folks, tell folks how they get it again.
[2:40:19.020 --> 2:40:23.140]  We might get in trouble for this, but you know, let it be.
[2:40:23.140 --> 2:40:25.940]  It's actually available at sortmovie.com and reclaim the blade.
[2:40:25.940 --> 2:40:30.220]  It'll be in stores, Target, Barnes and Noble, et cetera, July 7th.
[2:40:30.220 --> 2:40:33.260]  And that's when we're really going to, you know, hit with the publicity.
[2:40:33.260 --> 2:40:35.260]  And I'd love to have John Rhys Davies on your show.
[2:40:35.260 --> 2:40:36.260]  Let's do it.
[2:40:36.260 --> 2:40:37.260]  Again, baby.
[2:40:37.260 --> 2:40:38.260]  We'll get that date.
[2:40:38.260 --> 2:40:39.980]  And I promise I won't get you on late again.
[2:40:39.980 --> 2:40:42.980]  I just got into a rant and, and, and, and then you were okay with it.
[2:40:42.980 --> 2:40:47.140]  And if you, if you, if you would, if, if I could, I would love to send you guys some
[2:40:47.140 --> 2:40:48.140]  lightsabers.
[2:40:48.140 --> 2:40:49.140]  I'll send you a couple.
[2:40:49.140 --> 2:40:51.460]  They're a lot of fun.
[2:40:51.460 --> 2:40:52.940]  The new force effects lightsabers.
[2:40:52.940 --> 2:40:57.020]  I don't know if you've seen them, but Hasbro makes, but they're, they're metal and plastic
[2:40:57.020 --> 2:40:58.540]  handles that are really heavy.
[2:40:58.540 --> 2:41:01.740]  So they got the good feel and a weight of a, of a sword.
[2:41:01.740 --> 2:41:04.380]  And then they have all the sights and sounds of like a real lightsaber.
[2:41:04.380 --> 2:41:08.700]  No, no, I know, I've got, I've got, this is kind of, I've got five of them.
[2:41:08.700 --> 2:41:13.300]  I think I've got the little, well, I've got Yoda ones for my kids, little green ones because
[2:41:13.300 --> 2:41:17.100]  no, I mean, my, my bigger daughter and my son, because the baby obviously can't have
[2:41:17.100 --> 2:41:18.100]  sword fights.
[2:41:18.100 --> 2:41:21.860]  They attack me and it's got a point where you're beating me and then, and then I'll
[2:41:21.860 --> 2:41:25.020]  be fighting my son alone and he's beating me some of the time.
[2:41:25.020 --> 2:41:28.300]  So, you know, we have absolute knockdown drag outs and the neighbors are looking out their
[2:41:28.300 --> 2:41:30.700]  windows in the backyard of that work.
[2:41:30.700 --> 2:41:33.180]  You know, it's just total warfare, but no, I want some of those.
[2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:34.180]  I want some more.
[2:41:34.180 --> 2:41:38.100]  I'll send some more and I'll tell you what, look, I don't, I don't mean to get into the
[2:41:38.100 --> 2:41:40.780]  whole movie thing, but that's the great thing about movies.
[2:41:40.780 --> 2:41:45.540]  When you look at Robin Hood, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, 300
[2:41:45.540 --> 2:41:51.340]  Gladiator, all of these movies have the same message and that is essentially at the core,
[2:41:51.340 --> 2:41:53.540]  you have a rebel army against an empire.
[2:41:53.540 --> 2:41:58.220]  I mean, you look at Robin Hood, you've got Robin Hood, he robs from the rich, he gives
[2:41:58.220 --> 2:42:00.100]  to the poor, he protects the poor.
[2:42:00.100 --> 2:42:05.900]  King Richard is off on a crusade and King John is this corrupt tyrant that has taken
[2:42:05.900 --> 2:42:06.900]  over England.
[2:42:06.900 --> 2:42:09.940]  And here's Robin Hood, you know, he's a rebel.
[2:42:09.940 --> 2:42:11.860]  Same thing with Star Wars, same exact thing.
[2:42:11.860 --> 2:42:16.740]  You have the Rebel Alliance, you have Order 66, which will execute all the rebels.
[2:42:16.740 --> 2:42:21.580]  You look at Pirates of the Caribbean, you have free sailors, free pirates, and you have
[2:42:21.580 --> 2:42:25.660]  this corrupt, tyrannical British empire at the time.
[2:42:25.660 --> 2:42:30.020]  You know, obviously a lot of these stories are based in fiction and history, but you
[2:42:30.020 --> 2:42:33.380]  know, Pirates of the Caribbean, you know, whether you're big on pirates or not.
[2:42:33.380 --> 2:42:40.580]  I mean, at the core of the story, it's about three men fighting against injustice taxes,
[2:42:40.580 --> 2:42:44.860]  no representation, and so they were thugs out, you know, doing what they could, you
[2:42:44.860 --> 2:42:45.860]  know.
[2:42:45.860 --> 2:42:46.860]  Same thing with 300.
[2:42:46.860 --> 2:42:52.300]  300 is a very good example because you have obviously 300 Spartans, you know, and then
[2:42:52.300 --> 2:42:53.300]  Gladiator, same thing.
[2:42:53.300 --> 2:42:58.660]  And by the way, for folks that don't know, 300 is a true story.
[2:42:58.660 --> 2:43:02.660]  Now the movie, the comic book version, they add some ridiculous goblins and things.
[2:43:02.660 --> 2:43:08.740]  But I mean, that story is true for those that don't know.
[2:43:08.740 --> 2:43:15.620]  It's fun to delve into the movies and that was something.
[2:43:15.620 --> 2:43:17.140]  We just lost his phone line.
[2:43:17.140 --> 2:43:18.820]  Let's call him back and get him back on.
[2:43:18.820 --> 2:43:20.380]  That happens occasionally.
[2:43:20.380 --> 2:43:23.140]  Genesis phone system didn't go down to it.
[2:43:23.140 --> 2:43:25.180]  All right, calling back.
[2:43:25.180 --> 2:43:26.180]  That was his phone then.
[2:43:26.180 --> 2:43:27.180]  Okay.
[2:43:27.180 --> 2:43:28.180]  You know what?
[2:43:28.180 --> 2:43:32.020]  Let's bring Rob do in on this because, again, I wouldn't just have somebody on about a movie
[2:43:32.020 --> 2:43:33.340]  about swords.
[2:43:33.340 --> 2:43:36.820]  This is about the history of it and how it's a check and balance.
[2:43:36.820 --> 2:43:39.460]  And now people fought to have the right to be armed.
[2:43:39.460 --> 2:43:43.340]  And absolutely, it was also a right to have social mobility.
[2:43:43.340 --> 2:43:47.540]  The first things that got liberalized because, frankly, the Kings wanted to have larger, stronger
[2:43:47.540 --> 2:43:50.700]  armies to take over other nations so they allowed limited freedom.
[2:43:50.700 --> 2:43:55.380]  But the arming of the people did allow then the overthrow of some of the corrupt regimes
[2:43:55.380 --> 2:43:59.500]  that led into the Renaissance more than even the Black Plague did.
[2:43:59.500 --> 2:44:02.260]  And then out of that, you had upward mobility.
[2:44:02.260 --> 2:44:08.740]  Now, somebody who wasn't born into nobility, they could become a knight.
[2:44:08.740 --> 2:44:13.380]  They could become and then that created, that's why the old fable of King Arthur that has
[2:44:13.380 --> 2:44:18.100]  its roots in reality, it was the commoner pulling the sword out of the stone, but of
[2:44:18.100 --> 2:44:19.900]  course he wasn't really a commoner.
[2:44:19.900 --> 2:44:20.900]  So this is a big deal.
[2:44:20.900 --> 2:44:25.940]  This is about getting out of a caste system and we first see the caste system being overthrown
[2:44:25.940 --> 2:44:30.020]  to a certain extent with the free people becoming armed.
[2:44:30.020 --> 2:44:36.180]  Going back to our guest, Daniel McNichol, and the new film, Reclaiming the Blade, available
[2:44:36.180 --> 2:44:40.940]  here for the first time today at their website, reclaimingtheblade.com, okay, continue, you
[2:44:40.940 --> 2:44:41.940]  got cut off.
[2:44:41.940 --> 2:44:42.940]  Yeah.
[2:44:42.940 --> 2:44:43.940]  Yeah.
[2:44:43.940 --> 2:44:50.460]  You know, technical difficulty there, but you know, at the heart of these stories is
[2:44:50.460 --> 2:44:54.580]  a message that I think, and hey, that's why they sell tickets for these type of movies,
[2:44:54.580 --> 2:44:58.700]  because it's something that resonates with people, you know, and that's the bottom line.
[2:44:58.700 --> 2:45:01.980]  If it didn't resonate and it didn't sell tickets, they wouldn't make those.
[2:45:01.980 --> 2:45:07.380]  It's an archetypal ancestral memory, whatever you want to call it.
[2:45:07.380 --> 2:45:08.380]  Sure.
[2:45:08.380 --> 2:45:09.700]  I mean, it's simple.
[2:45:09.700 --> 2:45:12.860]  Humans defending themselves from saber-toothed tigers with a club.
[2:45:12.860 --> 2:45:15.300]  I mean, you know, you're supposed to have weapons.
[2:45:15.300 --> 2:45:17.860]  It's that simple and the weapons aren't bad.
[2:45:17.860 --> 2:45:21.300]  It's the people that wield them sometimes in a bad way.
[2:45:21.300 --> 2:45:25.540]  What are your points about the film and then the extra disc that comes along with it?
[2:45:25.540 --> 2:45:26.540]  Sure.
[2:45:26.540 --> 2:45:27.540]  Sure.
[2:45:27.540 --> 2:45:32.140]  You know, there's a lot of extra interviews with Bega Mortison and Carla Urban, who's
[2:45:32.140 --> 2:45:36.620]  in the New Star Trek movie, who was also in Lord of the Rings and has done a lot of
[2:45:36.620 --> 2:45:44.420]  sword wielding on a number of films, and then also Ken Sparling from Skywalker's Bound
[2:45:44.420 --> 2:45:51.180]  did the 5.1 surround mix, so if you're at all interested in just some good...
[2:45:51.180 --> 2:45:56.020]  We tried to make the documentary less informative and, well, informative but entertaining at
[2:45:56.020 --> 2:45:59.420]  the same time, and I hope we did that, because it's a bit...
[2:45:59.420 --> 2:46:03.620]  I wanted to add some epicness to it and make sure records put out our soundtrack, and there's
[2:46:03.620 --> 2:46:07.540]  a lot of great artists, the doves, Julianne Hatfield, the word driver.
[2:46:07.540 --> 2:46:08.540]  I actually...
[2:46:08.540 --> 2:46:13.180]  You've also got Gimli in it, the Dwarf from Lord of the Rings, who's also one of the stars
[2:46:13.180 --> 2:46:14.580]  and stuff like Raiders from the Lost Ark.
[2:46:14.580 --> 2:46:15.580]  I love that actor.
[2:46:15.580 --> 2:46:16.580]  Tell us about him.
[2:46:16.580 --> 2:46:17.580]  Yeah.
[2:46:17.580 --> 2:46:22.820]  John Rhys Davies is a great guy, I mean, he's a wonderful actor, he's very talented, he
[2:46:22.820 --> 2:46:23.820]  narrated the film, and...
[2:46:23.820 --> 2:46:28.940]  And you were talking about him earlier, he's the guy that is a patriot for sure.
[2:46:28.940 --> 2:46:29.940]  Absolutely.
[2:46:29.940 --> 2:46:30.940]  Absolutely.
[2:46:30.940 --> 2:46:31.940]  I mean, no questions asked.
[2:46:31.940 --> 2:46:32.940]  I mean, John is...
[2:46:32.940 --> 2:46:39.700]  He's a lover of history, he understands history, he understands where we're at today, and as
[2:46:39.700 --> 2:46:46.300]  I said, I think we should definitely get him on the show to talk, and so he's a great
[2:46:46.300 --> 2:46:47.300]  guy.
[2:46:47.300 --> 2:46:52.100]  I wrote the narration for him, but he's so intelligent and bright that he actually added
[2:46:52.100 --> 2:46:55.900]  his own personality to it.
[2:46:55.900 --> 2:47:00.980]  I'm not the greatest writer in the world, so he was able to work with me on that, and
[2:47:00.980 --> 2:47:05.180]  we were able to really get a great message in there.
[2:47:05.180 --> 2:47:10.780]  But I knew from the start when I started developing the film that he'd be a great voice for it.
[2:47:10.780 --> 2:47:16.100]  Tell us about this Swordmaster that did all the Star Wars stuff and the rest of it, because
[2:47:16.100 --> 2:47:18.660]  I think I've seen him in the documentaries about Lord of the Rings, that's the guy that
[2:47:18.660 --> 2:47:20.340]  trained Vigo, right?
[2:47:20.340 --> 2:47:21.340]  Sure.
[2:47:21.340 --> 2:47:28.940]  Yeah, Bob Anderson, he's trained Arrow Flynn, he's 80 plus years old, so I feel fortunate
[2:47:28.940 --> 2:47:32.340]  that we were able to sit down with him and have this interview.
[2:47:32.340 --> 2:47:37.300]  He's very spry for 80, and he's an amazing person.
[2:47:37.300 --> 2:47:43.100]  He trained Johnny Dab, Vigo Mortensen, he's a very well-known...
[2:47:43.100 --> 2:47:46.540]  He looks like he's about 68 years old, and you're saying he's 80.
[2:47:46.540 --> 2:47:51.380]  Yeah, he looks good, you know, and that's part of what I would like to see is exercise
[2:47:51.380 --> 2:47:56.300]  with the sword, because it's something that attaches you, it's not just running in a,
[2:47:56.300 --> 2:48:01.180]  you know, you're not just running on a treadmill, you know, you're exercising with a sword,
[2:48:01.180 --> 2:48:05.660]  there's some thought behind it, there's some passion and fear behind it, so it's a lot
[2:48:05.660 --> 2:48:06.660]  of fun.
[2:48:06.660 --> 2:48:11.100]  I hope, and I like to think, and you know, I romanticize things about things sometimes
[2:48:11.100 --> 2:48:15.380]  of it too much, but I'd like to think the sword is kept him alive for a while, but he's
[2:48:15.380 --> 2:48:21.260]  a really, really passionate person in the film, and we have a lot of, he's a big part
[2:48:21.260 --> 2:48:22.260]  of it.
[2:48:22.260 --> 2:48:25.980]  And then also, another part of the film is the academics, and we went to Oxford and
[2:48:25.980 --> 2:48:31.060]  we talked to a lot of really good martial arts experts, and we talk a lot about, you
[2:48:31.060 --> 2:48:39.260]  know, historical European martial arts and how the gun basically kind of changed, you
[2:48:39.260 --> 2:48:46.500]  know, warfare and how the sword evolved more into a sport and also into, you know, a symbol
[2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:48.740]  as opposed to just being a weapon.
[2:48:48.740 --> 2:48:53.380]  But getting back to the English history of it, when you look at the English longbow,
[2:48:53.380 --> 2:49:00.420]  which is a really amazing tool and a weapon, the accuracy they had with the English longbow,
[2:49:00.420 --> 2:49:06.980]  which every, you know, as I say, able-bodied male was to train with the longbow.
[2:49:06.980 --> 2:49:12.220]  And the accuracy was so good, they could hit a target further away than you could with
[2:49:12.220 --> 2:49:13.220]  a gun.
[2:49:13.220 --> 2:49:16.580]  I mean, you know, just, I mean, they could really hit a target well.
[2:49:16.580 --> 2:49:17.580]  I mean, obviously with scopes and-
[2:49:17.580 --> 2:49:21.180]  No, the compound bow, and I'm no big master man with the bow, but I've done some deer
[2:49:21.180 --> 2:49:22.180]  hunting with them.
[2:49:22.180 --> 2:49:25.620]  I could shoot like a sapling in 150 yards that big around, and you know, I'll say,
[2:49:25.620 --> 2:49:30.220]  I'm going to shoot that black knot on that tree with a target arrow and actually hit
[2:49:30.220 --> 2:49:31.220]  it.
[2:49:31.220 --> 2:49:32.900]  I mean, that's the thing is they try to destroy the Second Amendment.
[2:49:32.900 --> 2:49:36.960]  We need to try to keep it, but also get good with bows, get good with swords.
[2:49:36.960 --> 2:49:41.180]  And plus it's a lot of fun and fencing is exhausting, is it not?
[2:49:41.180 --> 2:49:48.780]  Well, you know, I have to confess, I'm a filmmaker first and a martial artist on the side.
[2:49:48.780 --> 2:49:53.740]  I love doing the martial arts too, but you know, I'm not that great at it, you know,
[2:49:53.740 --> 2:49:54.740]  I leave that.
[2:49:54.740 --> 2:49:57.620]  But let me tell you about another project that could be really cool that we're working
[2:49:57.620 --> 2:49:58.620]  on.
[2:49:58.620 --> 2:50:03.180]  I don't know if you've seen Batman or Batman Begins or Dark Knight, but a lot of the fight
[2:50:03.180 --> 2:50:08.380]  choreography in that movie, I've been talking to some of the developers of that fight choreography
[2:50:08.380 --> 2:50:15.980]  and I'd like to do another reclaiming the blade type movie with Husto and another guy.
[2:50:15.980 --> 2:50:19.460]  He's, well, he worked with Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale.
[2:50:19.460 --> 2:50:24.900]  He trained Heath Ledger actually for Dark Knight and Liam Neeson as well.
[2:50:24.900 --> 2:50:29.940]  But there's some really cool martial arts of just hand-to-hand combat.
[2:50:29.940 --> 2:50:33.140]  And you know, a lot of your listeners may not know this, but they've actually seen
[2:50:33.140 --> 2:50:39.420]  the fighting style called Casey's Fighting Method, KFM, which was used in the Dark Knight
[2:50:39.420 --> 2:50:48.540]  and also used in the other film, Batman Begins, but it's just another interesting project.
[2:50:48.540 --> 2:50:52.300]  Well, let's talk more about the film that just now is coming out.
[2:50:52.300 --> 2:50:56.100]  We come back and Rob, dude, my producer's got some comments, I've been running on here.
[2:50:56.100 --> 2:51:01.740]  We really appreciate our guest, Daniel McNichol, joining us, I'm Alex Jones.
[2:51:01.740 --> 2:51:05.020]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[2:51:05.020 --> 2:51:08.660]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[2:51:08.660 --> 2:51:09.660]  world.
[2:51:09.660 --> 2:51:14.580]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver who
[2:51:14.580 --> 2:51:19.540]  offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates
[2:51:19.540 --> 2:51:21.100]  or saline solutions.
[2:51:21.100 --> 2:51:25.660]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized
[2:51:25.660 --> 2:51:30.340]  at the cellular level and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day
[2:51:30.340 --> 2:51:31.340]  antibiotics.
[2:51:31.340 --> 2:51:35.740]  Thanks, Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver,
[2:51:35.740 --> 2:51:39.900]  gold and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[2:51:39.900 --> 2:51:44.180]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[2:51:44.180 --> 2:51:48.060]  would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[2:53:59.380 --> 2:54:09.460]  Now, we're going to try to hold down McNichol five minutes of the next hour.
[2:54:09.460 --> 2:54:15.220]  Burma's has huge breaking news on the swine flu genetically engineered bio weapon story.
[2:54:15.220 --> 2:54:19.340]  This is huge and it's mainstream hidden in plain view and I'd forgotten about this when
[2:54:19.340 --> 2:54:21.300]  he pointed it out to me.
[2:54:21.300 --> 2:54:23.620]  So we have all these big scientists saying it was clearly engineered.
[2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:24.780]  We told you so.
[2:54:24.780 --> 2:54:28.340]  Big new developments coming up after I take a gamma to calls, opening the phones up again
[2:54:28.340 --> 2:54:34.420]  for those that were holding that we had to let go earlier, 1-800-259-9231.
[2:54:34.420 --> 2:54:37.860]  And a big news, lots of stuff I haven't covered coming up, but Rob, dude, I know you're a
[2:54:37.860 --> 2:54:39.300]  huge fan of this film as well.
[2:54:39.300 --> 2:54:42.380]  I mean, I hope this ends up being on TV.
[2:54:42.380 --> 2:54:46.700]  That's my next question, but but any comments you've got about the new film out now reclaiming
[2:54:46.700 --> 2:54:47.700]  the blade?
[2:54:47.700 --> 2:54:49.420]  Well, there's a there's a couple things I like about it.
[2:54:49.420 --> 2:54:54.820]  The intro is really amazing and that'll really draw you in and it gives you a historical
[2:54:54.820 --> 2:54:59.420]  overview plus a pop culture overview and how they kind of merge together.
[2:54:59.420 --> 2:55:04.620]  And then, you know, that it's a what these guys are practicing is sort of a lost art
[2:55:04.620 --> 2:55:08.500]  and people are trying to bring it back in because it is another form to defend yourself.
[2:55:08.500 --> 2:55:10.140]  And that's another great thing about it.
[2:55:10.140 --> 2:55:15.220]  You with your sword could go out and defend yourself, defend your family, defend your
[2:55:15.220 --> 2:55:16.500]  belongings.
[2:55:16.500 --> 2:55:19.940]  And that's how you you proved your worth, you know, is with the sword.
[2:55:19.940 --> 2:55:23.700]  And then it goes into, you know, we've had this in Western cultures.
[2:55:23.700 --> 2:55:27.020]  We had this in Asian cultures, you know, with their fighting style.
[2:55:27.020 --> 2:55:31.300]  And it seems like, you know, the common thing that ground them all together was that blade
[2:55:31.300 --> 2:55:35.500]  that they were able to use and defend themselves and defend against tyranny.
[2:55:35.500 --> 2:55:38.260]  And that's what that's what I really liked about absolutely.
[2:55:38.260 --> 2:55:41.060]  And is this going to end up being on TV?
[2:55:41.060 --> 2:55:42.060]  Absolutely.
[2:55:42.060 --> 2:55:43.060]  Yeah.
[2:55:43.060 --> 2:55:47.740]  We actually have a wonderful failed agent, at least a real man off, she's doing a very
[2:55:47.740 --> 2:55:48.740]  good job.
[2:55:48.740 --> 2:55:55.100]  We, we are going to be airing it on the history channel, likely PBS and A&E and there's some
[2:55:55.100 --> 2:55:58.340]  other contenders, which would be Discover Chow and Chow, so absolutely, we're going
[2:55:58.340 --> 2:56:01.380]  to definitely have some airtime for this on TV.
[2:56:01.380 --> 2:56:03.540]  No, no question about that.
[2:56:03.540 --> 2:56:08.980]  And then, even though it has a pro arms message, wow.
[2:56:08.980 --> 2:56:09.980]  Yeah.
[2:56:09.980 --> 2:56:10.980]  Yeah.
[2:56:10.980 --> 2:56:11.980]  Yeah.
[2:56:11.980 --> 2:56:16.620]  Well, you know, I mean, I think, you know, the buyers are basically looking at dollars
[2:56:16.620 --> 2:56:21.980]  and they're basically looking at filling slots and they're looking at looking for content.
[2:56:21.980 --> 2:56:28.180]  You know, I mean, the job of any buyer, whether it's a retail buyer or a buyer who's finding
[2:56:28.180 --> 2:56:32.820]  content for TV, I mean, they're just, they're looking to fill slots and they're looking
[2:56:32.820 --> 2:56:37.540]  for content that's going to, you know, to be appealing to their audience.
[2:56:37.540 --> 2:56:42.540]  And so, yeah, I think for sure, we should, we should have some commercial TV.
[2:56:42.540 --> 2:56:48.740]  Actually Mark Cuban wants to show it on HD net, so I mean, but that's another, you know,
[2:56:48.740 --> 2:56:49.740]  place.
[2:56:49.740 --> 2:56:55.260]  Well, we'll definitely do TV, you know, TV is, is something, it comes down to one, typically
[2:56:55.260 --> 2:56:58.460]  with filmmaking, you know, you kind of do the theatrical thing, then you do home video
[2:56:58.460 --> 2:57:02.660]  and then TV is kind of later down the line and that's how we've approached it.
[2:57:02.660 --> 2:57:07.900]  However, I think for us, in our marketing, it might, it might do us better to hit the
[2:57:07.900 --> 2:57:13.980]  TV a little earlier, so I would say this fall, look forward on, on one of these channels
[2:57:13.980 --> 2:57:18.820]  or a couple of these channels and we'll definitely try to get it out there.
[2:57:18.820 --> 2:57:22.380]  Tell us about some of the other things you've done, because this is a pretty big undertaking
[2:57:22.380 --> 2:57:24.460]  to get all these folks together and do such a great job.
[2:57:24.460 --> 2:57:27.180]  What other things have you worked on?
[2:57:27.180 --> 2:57:33.980]  Well, if I could speak for a moment on filmmaking in general and, you know, I wanted to say
[2:57:33.980 --> 2:57:38.500]  this to your audience today, it was something that was kind of weighing on me before you
[2:57:38.500 --> 2:57:39.500]  called.
[2:57:39.500 --> 2:57:43.740]  I thought, you know, I just felt, you know, that this was important.
[2:57:43.740 --> 2:57:51.340]  And that is filmmakers, independent filmmakers, that, that you love need to be supported.
[2:57:51.340 --> 2:57:56.780]  You know, I want to just, you know, say you produce some great films and folks need to
[2:57:56.780 --> 2:58:02.180]  understand that you have to support the films that you love.
[2:58:02.180 --> 2:58:06.580]  You know, I mean, you know, instead of buying a ticket to maybe a big Hollywood blockbuster
[2:58:06.580 --> 2:58:11.060]  this summer, why not, you know, grab a copy of something from an independent filmmaker
[2:58:11.060 --> 2:58:15.900]  that you love and appreciate, you know, such as some of the titles that you have and, and
[2:58:15.900 --> 2:58:16.900]  some of these other films.
[2:58:16.900 --> 2:58:18.220]  But, you know, I think that's important.
[2:58:18.220 --> 2:58:20.780]  The audience is a part of the process.
[2:58:20.780 --> 2:58:21.780]  Absolutely.
[2:58:21.780 --> 2:58:23.980]  Final five-minute segment coming up with Daniel McNichol.
[2:58:23.980 --> 2:58:29.140]  Of course, he is the writer and director of just an amazing film with all these huge stars
[2:58:29.140 --> 2:58:30.140]  in history.
[2:58:30.140 --> 2:58:34.380]  My favorite type of a documentary, Reclaiming the Blade, we'll tell you how you can get
[2:58:34.380 --> 2:58:36.220]  a copy of it first.
[2:58:36.220 --> 2:58:37.220]  You'll be first.
[2:58:37.220 --> 2:58:38.220]  We're honored.
[2:58:38.220 --> 2:58:43.100]  Let me come back in 70 seconds.

[2:58:51.220 --> 2:58:55.340]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no
[2:58:55.340 --> 2:59:00.060]  longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[2:59:00.060 --> 2:59:06.460]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[2:59:06.460 --> 2:59:11.900]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[2:59:54.060 --> 3:00:03.620]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:03.620 --> 3:00:10.300]  We're reclaiming the blade.
[3:00:10.300 --> 3:00:13.380]  We have the writer and director on with us right now.
[3:00:13.380 --> 3:00:19.180]  We have a lot of big names, a lot of the top people in sword training.
[3:00:19.180 --> 3:00:25.940]  Just an amazing film, two-disc set, just two, is the making of the film, exclusive additional
[3:00:25.940 --> 3:00:29.060]  footage and interviews over an hour of sword training videos.
[3:00:29.060 --> 3:00:33.180]  I'm going to enjoy watching that because I got to learn how to beat my six-year-old and
[3:00:33.180 --> 3:00:34.180]  four-year-old.
[3:00:34.180 --> 3:00:37.660]  It's going to be kind of too powerful for me.
[3:00:37.660 --> 3:00:40.620]  Oh, my goodness.
[3:00:40.620 --> 3:00:48.620]  And it's presented in widescreen with optional commentary with director Daniel McNichol and
[3:00:48.620 --> 3:00:50.300]  John Davies.
[3:00:50.300 --> 3:00:56.540]  Okay, going back to our guest last five minutes, I've got a lot of questions I could ask, but
[3:00:56.540 --> 3:01:01.300]  I just want to tell folks, again, the websites they can go to get these, not in stores yet,
[3:01:01.300 --> 3:01:02.300]  not on TV yet.
[3:01:02.300 --> 3:01:05.700]  I'm honored you're doing this because, I mean, this is a great people to see something
[3:01:05.700 --> 3:01:06.700]  first.
[3:01:06.700 --> 3:01:09.500]  Tell folks the best websites to go to again to order this today.
[3:01:09.500 --> 3:01:16.860]  Absolutely, it really technically isn't out until July 7th, but we're saying what the
[3:01:16.860 --> 3:01:22.420]  heck, we're getting out there, Glacier Films Home Entertainment, which is the label that
[3:01:22.420 --> 3:01:23.420]  we're putting it out on.
[3:01:23.420 --> 3:01:27.740]  It's swordmovie.com and reclaimingtheblade.com, which are our sites, and you can actually
[3:01:27.740 --> 3:01:31.180]  order it directly from there and we'll ship it to you.
[3:01:31.180 --> 3:01:40.780]  And it will be in stores and retail box stores July 7th on iTunes, Apple iTunes for download
[3:01:40.780 --> 3:01:42.260]  and all that good stuff.
[3:01:42.260 --> 3:01:46.380]  And hopefully this fall, well, definitely this fall, we're going to see it on TV.
[3:01:46.380 --> 3:01:50.940]  So, Diego Mortison, Carl Urban, who's in the new Star Trek, Weta Workshop, we went down
[3:01:50.940 --> 3:01:56.460]  to Weta who did all the sword for the Lord of the Rings and did a very in-depth exclusive
[3:01:56.460 --> 3:01:57.460]  with them.
[3:01:57.460 --> 3:02:02.460]  Taylor is the director there, John Rhys Davies is the narrator, the Royal Armouries in Britain
[3:02:02.460 --> 3:02:09.140]  actually was a partner of this film, which is awesome, Lakeshore Records put up Soundtrack,
[3:02:09.140 --> 3:02:10.620]  Ken Sparling at Skywalker Sound.
[3:02:10.620 --> 3:02:15.860]  It's just, it's a phenomenal group of people coming together for a really good cause, which
[3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:22.260]  in my mind is a tribute to people like Bob Anderson and to people that have worked for
[3:02:22.260 --> 3:02:27.140]  years in the industry, but also a tribute to the martial artist and the symbol of the
[3:02:27.140 --> 3:02:31.540]  sword because really the sword is a symbol, you know, it's not, it's not necessarily just
[3:02:31.540 --> 3:02:37.420]  the sword, the sword represents so much more, it represents the Second Amendment, it represents,
[3:02:37.420 --> 3:02:41.460]  you know, whatever the weapons are of today, it represents all of these things.
[3:02:41.460 --> 3:02:44.860]  So, it's not just a martial weapon, but it's also a symbol.
[3:02:44.860 --> 3:02:48.980]  Well, I want to get John Rhys Davies and you back on right before it comes out.
[3:02:48.980 --> 3:02:49.980]  Sure.
[3:02:49.980 --> 3:02:52.820]  Here on the radio and at PrismPlanet.tv.
[3:02:52.820 --> 3:02:55.580]  And you know, I'm not a big collector of things, so I don't have time or money to do
[3:02:55.580 --> 3:03:00.020]  it, but I actually have bought a few collector swords, I mean, because there were so many
[3:03:00.020 --> 3:03:04.220]  millions made over the years, you get like a 300, 400-year-old sword, you know, for super
[3:03:04.220 --> 3:03:05.860]  cheap and they're just really...
[3:03:05.860 --> 3:03:08.940]  Yeah, my publicist will kill me if I don't mention this.
[3:03:08.940 --> 3:03:15.620]  We are actually giving away some, you know, $900 plus real swords that are made by like
[3:03:15.620 --> 3:03:16.620]  Master Sword Smith.
[3:03:16.620 --> 3:03:20.340]  So, if you even just find up on our mailing list, if you don't want to spend the bucks
[3:03:20.340 --> 3:03:25.020]  to get a disc, just find up on our mailing list and you're entered to win one of like
[3:03:25.020 --> 3:03:26.020]  nine swords.
[3:03:26.020 --> 3:03:27.020]  We're giving away...
[3:03:27.020 --> 3:03:30.060]  We're giving away four such like Sabers from Hasbro, so there's a lot of free stuff we're
[3:03:30.060 --> 3:03:31.060]  giving away as well.
[3:03:31.060 --> 3:03:35.020]  And we'll be at the conventions, you know, Comic-Con and DragonCon and all those types.
[3:03:35.020 --> 3:03:37.820]  Hey, what Star Wars Sabers are you giving out?
[3:03:37.820 --> 3:03:38.820]  More Yodas?
[3:03:38.820 --> 3:03:44.260]  Well, you know, the Yodas are great for kids, but we're definitely going to be doing some
[3:03:44.260 --> 3:03:48.100]  Darth Maul and some of the Anakin Skywalker's and my favorite, which is...
[3:03:48.100 --> 3:03:49.100]  I've got a green one here.
[3:03:49.100 --> 3:03:50.100]  I mean, I'm blue.
[3:03:50.100 --> 3:03:53.100]  The Anakin's blue, right?
[3:03:53.100 --> 3:03:59.060]  The Anakin is blue and then with the dark side, you've got the red Saber as well.
[3:03:59.060 --> 3:04:01.860]  I think the Darth Vader Saber, obviously, is red.
[3:04:01.860 --> 3:04:02.860]  I have that.
[3:04:02.860 --> 3:04:07.580]  But yeah, we're giving those away and as I said before, I definitely want to send some
[3:04:07.580 --> 3:04:12.300]  to you and just, you know, it would make me happy to think that you guys were running
[3:04:12.300 --> 3:04:15.180]  around your studios, you know, having some sword fights every night.
[3:04:15.180 --> 3:04:21.580]  Hey, I was sent by the Darkon folks, the filmmaker, some Darkon swords, so no, I want
[3:04:21.580 --> 3:04:23.180]  more lightsabers.
[3:04:23.180 --> 3:04:24.180]  Bring them.
[3:04:24.180 --> 3:04:25.180]  If I got to feed you, Rob do.
[3:04:25.180 --> 3:04:26.180]  Look at Rob do.
[3:04:26.180 --> 3:04:27.180]  I'm going to crush him.
[3:04:27.180 --> 3:04:29.820]  I'm going to destroy you as soon as these swords come in.
[3:04:29.820 --> 3:04:36.460]  Hey, listen, it was great having the writer and director of reclaiming the blade on with
[3:04:36.460 --> 3:04:38.380]  us, Daniel McNichol.
[3:04:38.380 --> 3:04:39.580]  Thank you so much for coming on.

[3:06:01.980 --> 3:06:07.300]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:06:07.300 --> 3:06:13.500]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:06:13.500 --> 3:06:15.380]  just as well funded.
[3:06:15.380 --> 3:06:20.540]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:06:20.540 --> 3:06:22.020]  of the American people.
[3:06:22.020 --> 3:06:26.420]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:06:26.420 --> 3:06:31.540]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:06:31.540 --> 3:06:38.060]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:06:38.060 --> 3:06:41.620]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:06:41.620 --> 3:06:48.500]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:06:56.700 --> 3:07:01.340]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:07:01.340 --> 3:07:04.860]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[3:07:04.860 --> 3:07:06.780]  Now going green can save money.
[3:07:06.780 --> 3:07:10.860]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with

[3:07:20.340 --> 3:07:26.060]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates
[3:07:26.060 --> 3:07:31.260]  the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[3:07:31.260 --> 3:07:33.540]  and maintaining cell integrity.
[3:07:33.540 --> 3:07:36.940]  Renaissance charge offers a full line of products made in the USA for all types and
[3:07:36.940 --> 3:07:38.540]  sizes of batteries.
[3:07:38.540 --> 3:07:42.820]  Do not why our customers tell us the renaissance charger is the only battery charger they will
[3:07:42.820 --> 3:07:43.820]  ever use.

[3:08:02.980 --> 3:08:09.540]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:09.540 --> 3:08:12.620]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:12.620 --> 3:08:23.100]  Okay, I'm going to take call after call at 1-800-2599-231, 1-800-2599-231 for five minutes,
[3:08:23.100 --> 3:08:31.300]  huge new breaking swine flu news that is in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[3:08:31.300 --> 3:08:36.380]  It's from decades ago, a key piece of the puzzle coming up and I'm going to do a news
[3:08:36.380 --> 3:08:45.060]  blitz and announce at the end of the show two new films being released today, two new
[3:08:45.060 --> 3:08:53.060]  films being released today that I've made, that we've made here in this office, two,
[3:08:53.060 --> 3:08:57.580]  not one, not two, but saying one, but it's really two, so big surprise coming up in the
[3:08:57.580 --> 3:08:58.580]  show.
[3:08:58.580 --> 3:08:59.580]  Let's go right now to Sam and Mass.
[3:08:59.580 --> 3:09:04.580]  Sam, thanks for holding it on the air.
[3:09:04.580 --> 3:09:05.580]  Hello, Sam.
[3:09:05.580 --> 3:09:06.580]  Hello.
[3:09:06.580 --> 3:09:07.580]  Can you hear me?
[3:09:07.580 --> 3:09:08.580]  Yes, I can.
[3:09:08.580 --> 3:09:09.580]  All right.
[3:09:09.580 --> 3:09:10.580]  Hey, Alex.
[3:09:10.580 --> 3:09:16.020]  I wanted to touch on the purpose of the GPS census workers, as we all aware, 140,000 census
[3:09:16.020 --> 3:09:19.900]  workers have been sent to every door in America to tag position stop points.
[3:09:19.900 --> 3:09:21.740]  Now, we already have a GPS.
[3:09:21.740 --> 3:09:22.740]  That's phase one.
[3:09:22.740 --> 3:09:23.740]  They admit they don't ask you questions.
[3:09:23.740 --> 3:09:28.140]  It's for the phase two, but it's for SWAT teams and others for the feds to know where
[3:09:28.140 --> 3:09:29.140]  you're at.
[3:09:29.140 --> 3:09:30.140]  It's for Homeland Security.
[3:09:30.140 --> 3:09:31.140]  That's admitted.
[3:09:31.140 --> 3:09:32.140]  Go ahead.
[3:09:32.140 --> 3:09:33.140]  Okay.
[3:09:33.140 --> 3:09:34.140]  Well, I have my own theory.
[3:09:34.140 --> 3:09:40.620]  So, there really is no need to pay 140,000 workers to redo a job that's already cataloged.
[3:09:40.620 --> 3:09:44.380]  Simply put, they have this information already, except they have to do step A and B to get
[3:09:44.380 --> 3:09:49.340]  the C. They want C in a single database, your location, your neighbor's location, the track
[3:09:49.340 --> 3:09:50.940]  away point system.
[3:09:50.940 --> 3:09:54.900]  The only reason they would need this is for a computer system or a computer program.
[3:09:54.900 --> 3:09:59.460]  When the swine flu breaks out this winter because people choose to get the virus with
[3:09:59.460 --> 3:10:04.900]  their yearly flu vaccine trading liberty for death, I believe this winter, they've learned
[3:10:04.900 --> 3:10:05.900]  from the Holocaust.
[3:10:05.900 --> 3:10:09.140]  They will not be coming to your house forcing you from your home, putting you in jeeps with
[3:10:09.140 --> 3:10:14.580]  men and guns saying, how, like, MTV likes to show the public, it can happen today.
[3:10:14.580 --> 3:10:15.580]  No.
[3:10:15.580 --> 3:10:19.060]  Alex, they'll come to your house and unmanned vehicles and every day playing soothing noises
[3:10:19.060 --> 3:10:20.260]  like an ice cream truck.
[3:10:20.260 --> 3:10:24.180]  They will circle the neighborhoods of America and over loud speaker announced medical attention
[3:10:24.180 --> 3:10:28.700]  to food, water, and safety if people board the truck and take them to FEMA camps.
[3:10:28.700 --> 3:10:32.700]  They cannot enforce the new world order without this virus, without this pandemic.
[3:10:32.700 --> 3:10:33.900]  They don't need to take our guns.
[3:10:33.900 --> 3:10:37.820]  They will let their worries rot in the streets and take their worries, you, to government
[3:10:37.820 --> 3:10:41.740]  facilities where obviously you can't bring your guns with you.
[3:10:41.740 --> 3:10:46.140]  Sir, well said, and you should write an article about that.
[3:10:46.140 --> 3:10:47.580]  It sounds like you did write one.
[3:10:47.580 --> 3:10:48.580]  Send that to us.
[3:10:48.580 --> 3:10:52.580]  We'll post it because that is one of the things in their fists.
[3:10:52.580 --> 3:10:56.180]  They have a fist with 10 cards or so in it.
[3:10:56.180 --> 3:11:01.460]  And as I said back on March 5th, a month plus before the, you know, the, it got released,
[3:11:01.460 --> 3:11:08.500]  I said nukes war with Pakistan or Iran, stage, you know, more stage terror attacks like 911,
[3:11:08.500 --> 3:11:13.380]  a staged flu outbreak or the real or just hype that, that that was in their fist of
[3:11:13.380 --> 3:11:15.380]  things that they could do.
[3:11:15.380 --> 3:11:18.740]  And I said it was a manufactured virus when it broke out and now they've had to admit
[3:11:18.740 --> 3:11:19.740]  that.
[3:11:19.740 --> 3:11:23.420]  And then I predicted they would then say, Oh, it will mutate later and be deadly.
[3:11:23.420 --> 3:11:24.740]  Take your shots.
[3:11:24.740 --> 3:11:28.220]  And now they're saying that I just know the enemy.
[3:11:28.220 --> 3:11:32.100]  And if they think we're going to be sold on this and we'll go along with this, they are
[3:11:32.100 --> 3:11:33.460]  going to go ahead with it.
[3:11:33.460 --> 3:11:38.020]  But the number one video is on YouTube, Google and all the other top video sites everywhere.
[3:11:38.020 --> 3:11:41.660]  You heard Watson earlier on the big search engines, you know, where they list the top
[3:11:41.660 --> 3:11:42.660]  searches.
[3:11:42.660 --> 3:11:43.660]  It's info wars.com.
[3:11:43.660 --> 3:11:44.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:11:44.660 --> 3:11:50.100]  You know, we're in the top 50 now of things being searched on the web.
[3:11:50.100 --> 3:11:54.220]  When you look at that, you understand we were actually countering them.
[3:11:54.220 --> 3:11:58.660]  And that's why they went through YouTube and just blasted every video where I was talking
[3:11:58.660 --> 3:12:03.660]  about swine flu because they, because I was exposing that and I appreciate your call,
[3:12:03.660 --> 3:12:05.300]  which shows we've got a chance.
[3:12:05.300 --> 3:12:10.820]  They wouldn't be erasing what I do if it wasn't hurting them and I'm nobody.
[3:12:10.820 --> 3:12:14.300]  I'm just some aggressive person that's got a half decent brain that didn't put up with
[3:12:14.300 --> 3:12:15.300]  slavery.
[3:12:15.300 --> 3:12:19.940]  Now there's a folks a lot smarter and better looking and tougher than I am and got more
[3:12:19.940 --> 3:12:20.940]  money than I do.
[3:12:20.940 --> 3:12:22.540]  What are you doing sitting on your fat butt?
[3:12:22.540 --> 3:12:25.460]  Well, you decided it's not your job to fight tyranny.
[3:12:25.460 --> 3:12:29.020]  You decided you're not going to be involved in that folks.
[3:12:29.020 --> 3:12:30.020]  We have no future.
[3:12:30.020 --> 3:12:34.420]  If you don't see yourself in that role as a freedom fighter against tyranny.
[3:12:34.420 --> 3:12:37.780]  Let's go and take another call here, Joshua in Michigan.
[3:12:37.780 --> 3:12:38.780]  You're on the air.
[3:12:38.780 --> 3:12:39.780]  Joshua, go ahead.
[3:12:39.780 --> 3:12:42.700]  Oh, thanks so much Alex for taking the call.
[3:12:42.700 --> 3:12:47.260]  You know, I've been a big fan for a long time through the work that you did and Jason Bermas.
[3:12:47.260 --> 3:12:48.860]  You guys really woke me up a few years ago.
[3:12:48.860 --> 3:12:54.340]  I started doing my homework and I really want to empathize with them taking down your two
[3:12:54.340 --> 3:12:59.940]  YouTube channels or the one that with the Alex Jones channel and three channels run
[3:12:59.940 --> 3:13:00.940]  by other people.
[3:13:00.940 --> 3:13:03.380]  I call Nate Evans up and go, you have a director account.
[3:13:03.380 --> 3:13:04.380]  Can we use it?
[3:13:04.380 --> 3:13:06.660]  And he says, oh, I loaded your videos up.
[3:13:06.660 --> 3:13:10.460]  They suspended my director account and didn't even say copyright infringement.
[3:13:10.460 --> 3:13:11.860]  No, me too.
[3:13:11.860 --> 3:13:17.140]  You know, I had a YouTube channel by the name of anonymous patriot USA.
[3:13:17.140 --> 3:13:18.940]  I put together a chemtrails documentary.
[3:13:18.940 --> 3:13:19.940]  I remember that.
[3:13:19.940 --> 3:13:21.660]  I remember your channel.
[3:13:21.660 --> 3:13:22.660]  Thank you so much.
[3:13:22.660 --> 3:13:23.660]  I appreciate that.
[3:13:23.660 --> 3:13:29.180]  I put together the ultimate chem truth documentary that is up on your info wars.dk site is part
[3:13:29.180 --> 3:13:34.300]  of the four top chemtrails documentary and I feel so flattered that you guys recognize
[3:13:34.300 --> 3:13:40.580]  the contribution that I made and I just tried to compile all of the mainstream news footage
[3:13:40.580 --> 3:13:45.460]  I could find on chemtrails and the links to Margiela and the rent interview because in
[3:13:45.460 --> 3:13:52.780]  December of 2007, I started noticing it and videotaping it and becoming a big proponent
[3:13:52.780 --> 3:13:57.740]  of getting the truth out there and putting the dots together.
[3:13:57.740 --> 3:14:03.140]  And I've got a new one that's called Chemekill, the movie, and it's got even more extended
[3:14:03.140 --> 3:14:10.940]  news coverage and chemekill, C H E M A space K I L L.
[3:14:10.940 --> 3:14:16.020]  Well, you know, I'm making a chemtrail film slash eugenics film as well.
[3:14:16.020 --> 3:14:18.940]  That's the next thing I'm doing after this next Obama deal we're working on.
[3:14:18.940 --> 3:14:22.620]  So please collaborate with us or anything you think we could use.
[3:14:22.620 --> 3:14:23.620]  Get it to us.
[3:14:23.620 --> 3:14:24.620]  Everybody to help me.
[3:14:24.620 --> 3:14:25.620]  God bless you.
[3:14:25.620 --> 3:14:27.540]  And I appreciate your call Joshua and talk to all these college for 10 hours, but I'm
[3:14:27.540 --> 3:14:28.540]  actually going to get to you.
[3:14:28.540 --> 3:14:30.780]  I got to move Jason in Wisconsin.
[3:14:30.780 --> 3:14:31.780]  You're on the air.
[3:14:31.780 --> 3:14:32.780]  Go ahead.
[3:14:32.780 --> 3:14:33.780]  Yes.
[3:14:33.780 --> 3:14:34.780]  Yes.
[3:14:34.780 --> 3:14:35.780]  Thank you.
[3:14:35.780 --> 3:14:41.620]  Hey, I was wondering, uh, what was talking earlier about the white vans being labeled
[3:14:41.620 --> 3:14:42.620]  as terrorists?
[3:14:42.620 --> 3:14:45.980]  And I thought that was kind of funny because I would think that would be something they'd
[3:14:45.980 --> 3:14:48.780]  want to look for considering 9 11.
[3:14:48.780 --> 3:14:52.660]  That was exactly what the terrorists were using from Israel that I documented so well
[3:14:52.660 --> 3:14:54.780]  in the film, missing links.
[3:14:54.780 --> 3:15:00.380]  Well, certainly there was an Israeli company that was there in white vans and I had the
[3:15:00.380 --> 3:15:05.540]  police chief on, uh, from Bergen County, uh, they have police chiefs in the county.
[3:15:05.540 --> 3:15:08.660]  It was like five, six years ago that that interview is out there on the web.
[3:15:08.660 --> 3:15:12.780]  And I had him on about how he said everybody should be forced to take a microchip and somebody
[3:15:12.780 --> 3:15:17.620]  called in the network said, that's the same police chief that arrested the Israelis jumping
[3:15:17.620 --> 3:15:18.620]  up and down.
[3:15:18.620 --> 3:15:19.620]  They left New York.
[3:15:19.620 --> 3:15:21.740]  There was an APB out and he got them.
[3:15:21.740 --> 3:15:25.860]  And then he said, yeah, no, no, it's true, but I'm not going to talk about it.
[3:15:25.860 --> 3:15:31.300]  Uh, so absolutely, you know, that's what, uh, uh, fabled enemies, uh, Jason's film gets
[3:15:31.300 --> 3:15:32.300]  into that as well.
[3:15:32.300 --> 3:15:33.300]  Okay.
[3:15:33.300 --> 3:15:34.300]  Thank you, uh, Jason.
[3:15:34.300 --> 3:15:35.300]  Anything else from Wisconsin?
[3:15:35.300 --> 3:15:36.300]  Well, that's it.
[3:15:36.300 --> 3:15:37.300]  Thank you.
[3:15:37.300 --> 3:15:38.300]  Okay.
[3:15:38.300 --> 3:15:42.260]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Greg in Florida.
[3:15:42.260 --> 3:15:44.140]  Greg, you're on the air.
[3:15:44.140 --> 3:15:45.140]  Go ahead.
[3:15:45.140 --> 3:15:46.140]  How you doing, Alex?
[3:15:46.140 --> 3:15:47.140]  Good.
[3:15:47.140 --> 3:15:48.140]  Yeah.
[3:15:48.140 --> 3:15:50.340]  I wanted to let you know, I called Congressman Rooney's office.
[3:15:50.340 --> 3:15:54.020]  He's my local, uh, Senator Congress and whatever.
[3:15:54.020 --> 3:15:58.980]  And I asked him about the Mayak report, because I'm a former military veteran myself and I
[3:15:58.980 --> 3:16:03.460]  told him he kind of scared me that this was coming out and he told me to, uh, take it
[3:16:03.460 --> 3:16:08.420]  with a green assault that, uh, not to take anything too seriously coming out of this
[3:16:08.420 --> 3:16:09.420]  administration.
[3:16:09.420 --> 3:16:14.620]  Well, this is kind of a country that live in, I can't really take it with a green assault
[3:16:14.620 --> 3:16:15.620]  man.
[3:16:15.620 --> 3:16:20.180]  Well, that's what they tell you, oh, oh, you know, we're passing laws to where if you're
[3:16:20.180 --> 3:16:22.860]  a conservative, you're not going to be allowed down guns anymore.
[3:16:22.860 --> 3:16:25.420]  I mean, they have the bill introduced with it.
[3:16:25.420 --> 3:16:30.100]  Why don't you have a staff on tape saying, if we list you as an extremist, you are not
[3:16:30.100 --> 3:16:31.100]  allowed to own guns anymore.
[3:16:31.100 --> 3:16:33.300]  We're going to have a national list.
[3:16:33.300 --> 3:16:34.580]  It's now happening.
[3:16:34.580 --> 3:16:39.580]  They got a million, 100,000 innocent Americans on the, uh, fly list.
[3:16:39.580 --> 3:16:42.180]  Now they've got the four million on the crime list.
[3:16:42.180 --> 3:16:45.500]  This is the model I've been telling you for years that we're going to use and it's happening.
[3:16:45.500 --> 3:16:51.180]  And they say, so there's a couple bills moving through Congress fast, look like they may pass
[3:16:51.180 --> 3:16:55.700]  to arrest you if somebody says you hurt their feelings on the internet with a federal felony.
[3:16:55.700 --> 3:16:56.700]  It's okay.
[3:16:56.700 --> 3:16:57.700]  Go into prison.
[3:16:57.700 --> 3:16:58.700]  It's not a big deal.
[3:16:58.700 --> 3:17:00.900]  They haven't no free speeches, freedom.
[3:17:00.900 --> 3:17:05.980]  And yeah, we're trying to pass laws to have fairness doctrine in and yeah, we're trying
[3:17:05.980 --> 3:17:09.100]  to pass bills where the attorney general can ban any guns he wants.
[3:17:09.100 --> 3:17:13.980]  We have the bill number and the national media goes, these crazy people like Alex Jones
[3:17:13.980 --> 3:17:16.700]  says that Obama wants your guns.
[3:17:16.700 --> 3:17:21.340]  You'll see the, they use psych warfare as they're trying to take them, they say, we're
[3:17:21.340 --> 3:17:22.340]  not taking your guns.
[3:17:22.340 --> 3:17:25.140]  Now hand them over and you're like, what do you talk?
[3:17:25.140 --> 3:17:26.900]  What's the mind game here, Mack?
[3:17:26.900 --> 3:17:32.540]  They go, just give us the gun, please give us the gun anything else?
[3:17:32.540 --> 3:17:39.340]  Uh, one more just kid that I, uh, I'll tell you it's been, uh, six years since I've been
[3:17:39.340 --> 3:17:44.700]  out of the military and they used to line us up and give us shots all the time.
[3:17:44.700 --> 3:17:48.060]  They never even told us what it was that they were shooting this way and it was illegal
[3:17:48.060 --> 3:17:52.340]  for them to give you smallpox and anthrax shots because people, so we were in the military,
[3:17:52.340 --> 3:17:53.340]  you have no rights.
[3:17:53.340 --> 3:17:57.940]  No, if it's an experimental unapprehensive vaccine, they by law have to get your consent,
[3:17:57.940 --> 3:18:00.060]  but they force troops to take it.
[3:18:00.060 --> 3:18:03.380]  And that's why the troops have such a higher cancer level than any other group of people.
[3:18:03.380 --> 3:18:04.380]  All right.
[3:18:04.380 --> 3:18:09.100]  Well, that's why I tell troops it's important to answer the questionnaires that you will
[3:18:09.100 --> 3:18:14.780]  fire on us citizens because we've talked to army doctors and others that if you say no,
[3:18:14.780 --> 3:18:19.820]  I won't fire American citizens, you get sent overseas and you get put on a roster.
[3:18:19.820 --> 3:18:25.620]  I'm not kidding to be given the vaccines that have the cancer viruses to soft kill you.
[3:18:25.620 --> 3:18:30.140]  So the troops that say they'll be Patriots 75 plus percent in the average study, you're
[3:18:30.140 --> 3:18:33.500]  given an injection that will kill you 20 years down the road.
[3:18:33.500 --> 3:18:34.500]  I'm not kidding.
[3:18:34.500 --> 3:18:40.580]  Well, I was going to say, I haven't been sick since I got out, it's been six years since
[3:18:40.580 --> 3:18:46.660]  I had a cold, the flu, anything, I haven't even had a sore throat and it's been a long
[3:18:46.660 --> 3:18:47.660]  time.
[3:18:47.660 --> 3:18:49.820]  Did you call in when I was on?
[3:18:49.820 --> 3:18:54.620]  Did you call in when I was on coast to coast and last no, sir?
[3:18:54.620 --> 3:18:58.220]  Yeah, there was another guy called in and said that since he hadn't been taking the
[3:18:58.220 --> 3:18:59.780]  vaccines, you never get sick anymore.
[3:18:59.780 --> 3:19:02.020]  Good, good to hear from him when I was on that show.
[3:19:02.020 --> 3:19:03.020]  He said that.
[3:19:03.020 --> 3:19:04.020]  Let's go to another one here.
[3:19:04.020 --> 3:19:10.140]  Well, no, I don't want to, I don't want to cheat this caller coming up, so we'll come
[3:19:10.140 --> 3:19:15.900]  back and go to Thomas, John, oh, John disagrees.
[3:19:15.900 --> 3:19:16.900]  I didn't see that.
[3:19:16.900 --> 3:19:17.900]  We'll go to him first.
[3:19:17.900 --> 3:19:20.820]  Stephen, Texas, Charles in New York.
[3:19:20.820 --> 3:19:27.620]  And by the way, the last two swine flu, 76 in 1918, popped up on U.S. military bases.
[3:19:27.620 --> 3:19:33.460]  Guess what we found from the 1970 wait till Jason Mermas is in studio with us 33 after
[3:19:33.460 --> 3:19:39.180]  coming up for a quick five minutes and then I'm going to announce two new films, ladies
[3:19:39.180 --> 3:19:47.540]  and gentlemen, two new films that are being released today, two little salvos, extra torpedoes
[3:19:47.540 --> 3:19:50.020]  were firing with no promotion.
[3:19:50.020 --> 3:19:55.100]  I'm just dropping these with no warning and I will announce that at the end of the show.
[3:19:55.100 --> 3:19:57.620]  Here's a little tidbit hint.
[3:19:57.620 --> 3:19:59.700]  I didn't tell Aaron so he jumped the gun.
[3:19:59.700 --> 3:20:06.780]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system new from hemp USA.org.
[3:20:06.780 --> 3:20:11.460]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source rendering chemicals
[3:20:11.460 --> 3:20:15.780]  harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[3:20:15.780 --> 3:20:20.380]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system in brain.
[3:20:20.380 --> 3:20:24.860]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere making it our number one new
[3:20:24.860 --> 3:20:27.460]  product from hemp USA.org.
[3:20:27.460 --> 3:20:32.180]  This water system will descale all piping hot water heaters and appliances due to heavy
[3:20:32.180 --> 3:20:37.180]  buildup of hard minerals detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering
[3:20:37.180 --> 3:20:42.340]  the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins with extreme positive
[3:20:42.340 --> 3:20:46.900]  effects on plants, vegetables and fruits and proved taste, color, size and yield with
[3:20:46.900 --> 3:20:49.740]  approximately 30% less water usage.
[3:20:49.740 --> 3:20:53.660]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[3:20:53.660 --> 3:21:01.420]  At hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 that's 908-691-2608.
[3:21:01.420 --> 3:21:05.620]  On the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[3:21:05.620 --> 3:21:08.060]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[3:21:08.060 --> 3:21:13.180]  Unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[3:21:13.180 --> 3:21:16.220]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:21:16.220 --> 3:21:20.500]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing
[3:21:20.500 --> 3:21:24.420]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:21:24.420 --> 3:21:28.160]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book The Creature
[3:21:28.160 --> 3:21:29.500]  from Jekyll Island.
[3:21:29.500 --> 3:21:33.580]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[3:21:33.580 --> 3:21:34.580]  power.
[3:21:34.580 --> 3:21:38.420]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[3:21:38.420 --> 3:21:39.980]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:21:39.980 --> 3:21:44.700]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[3:21:44.700 --> 3:21:49.540]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[3:21:49.540 --> 3:21:52.660]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[3:21:52.660 --> 3:22:01.420]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237 that's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:22:01.420 --> 3:22:07.540]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:22:07.540 --> 3:22:12.020]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:22:12.020 --> 3:22:13.340]  us would like to see.
[3:22:13.340 --> 3:22:18.500]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:22:18.500 --> 3:22:19.860]  of the American people.
[3:22:19.860 --> 3:22:24.220]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:22:24.220 --> 3:22:29.340]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:22:29.340 --> 3:22:37.460]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:22:37.460 --> 3:22:41.020]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:22:41.020 --> 3:22:47.940]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:22:47.940 --> 3:22:56.140]  Find your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[3:22:56.140 --> 3:23:00.900]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:23:00.900 --> 3:23:04.380]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:23:04.380 --> 3:23:08.260]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[3:23:08.260 --> 3:23:09.860]  than when drinking the water?
[3:23:09.860 --> 3:23:13.660]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[3:23:13.660 --> 3:23:14.660]  into the skin.
[3:23:14.660 --> 3:23:19.340]  The KDF dual-media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[3:23:19.340 --> 3:23:22.180]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[3:23:22.180 --> 3:23:25.900]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[3:23:25.900 --> 3:23:30.780]  The KDF dual-media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever
[3:23:30.780 --> 3:23:31.780]  comes first.
[3:23:31.780 --> 3:23:35.940]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:23:35.940 --> 3:23:37.980]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[3:23:37.980 --> 3:23:38.980]  What about you?
[3:23:38.980 --> 3:23:44.340]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free
[3:23:44.340 --> 3:23:45.340]  shipping.
[3:23:45.340 --> 3:23:54.060]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653, that's 1-877-886-3653, or order

[3:24:16.020 --> 3:24:22.220]  Breaking news, breaking news coming up in a moment, big news blitz, and I will play
[3:24:22.220 --> 3:24:27.340]  the trailer for the new film I am releasing today, that is, I'm starting pre-orders for
[3:24:27.340 --> 3:24:38.420]  it today, and it will be released at PrisonPlanet.tv June 3rd, and the DVDs are now in, so it'll
[3:24:38.420 --> 3:24:41.660]  be shipping out, we'll have them all boxed up and ready to be shipped out, so you'll
[3:24:41.660 --> 3:24:48.380]  get them very, very quickly after the June 3rd date that is just a few weeks away, what
[3:24:48.380 --> 3:24:52.900]  about two weeks away or so, so a lot of stuff coming up at the end of the show, I'm going
[3:24:52.900 --> 3:24:53.900]  to be announcing.
[3:24:53.900 --> 3:24:59.620]  I got a caller that disagrees with me, John in Washington disagrees, so go ahead John.
[3:24:59.620 --> 3:25:07.460]  Hello Alex, I just wanted to say that I finally signed up for PrisonPlanet and I just love
[3:25:07.460 --> 3:25:08.980]  it.
[3:25:08.980 --> 3:25:17.340]  The part that I disagree about with this GPS mapping modeling effort that's being conducted
[3:25:17.340 --> 3:25:21.460]  right now is in the origins of the mandate.
[3:25:21.460 --> 3:25:26.660]  This actually came from, and it took me many hours to find it, this came from the Department
[3:25:26.660 --> 3:25:36.420]  of Economic and Social Affairs Statistics Division, a statistical paper, series M, number 67,
[3:25:36.420 --> 3:25:44.260]  revision two, entitled, Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Census, this is
[3:25:44.260 --> 3:25:50.620]  the United Nations mandate that came out in November of 2008, and-
[3:25:50.620 --> 3:25:57.060]  No, no, no, wait a minute, we actually covered that on the show, so we did mention that,
[3:25:57.060 --> 3:26:03.580]  but yes, look, the census everything, how our National ID cards work is a 2000 treaty,
[3:26:03.580 --> 3:26:09.540]  you're absolutely right, this is United Nations worldwide, under global governance, wants
[3:26:09.540 --> 3:26:14.860]  to know where everything is placed, your name, with your home, where you're at.
[3:26:14.860 --> 3:26:16.620]  On a worldwide basis.
[3:26:16.620 --> 3:26:21.500]  No, I know, and you know what, you know what, we showed that UN document on screen, I spent
[3:26:21.500 --> 3:26:25.420]  like two minutes on it a week ago, we should do an article about it, here's the problem,
[3:26:25.420 --> 3:26:30.740]  I don't have the writers, write an article about it, send it to Aaronininfowars.com,
[3:26:30.740 --> 3:26:35.660]  send it to Rob D, send it to Kurt, and one of them will be sure to post it, send it
[3:26:35.660 --> 3:26:38.780]  to everybody to make sure and say post it, and so put that together.
[3:26:38.780 --> 3:26:41.220]  I mean, I need writers to volunteer, I can't-
[3:26:41.220 --> 3:26:45.900]  I'll be glad to do that, because I did it on my, I do, I do a newsletter that I send
[3:26:45.900 --> 3:26:50.180]  out to a group that I have in this part of the country, but you know, here's the interesting
[3:26:50.180 --> 3:26:55.940]  thing, very odd about this document, is that when it gives on the very first pages, it
[3:26:55.940 --> 3:27:02.420]  tells to whom this document applies, and it gives the various regions, every region of
[3:27:02.420 --> 3:27:08.660]  the world is covered under this document, and the only one they left out is North America.
[3:27:08.660 --> 3:27:19.180]  So, apparently, Obama has signed on to this United Nations global mandate without asking
[3:27:19.180 --> 3:27:20.180]  the United Nations.
[3:27:20.180 --> 3:27:25.460]  Now, the United States signed on to it, and it was brought up in 1998, and the UN document
[3:27:25.460 --> 3:27:30.100]  we read and posted that's running this, and then the federal agencies signed the treaties.
[3:27:30.100 --> 3:27:37.820]  When Bush signed on to UNESCO in 2004, Reagan had taken us off in 82, he put us back on it,
[3:27:37.820 --> 3:27:45.020]  that's why you see the statistic bureau under the census say in 2004, from the document
[3:27:45.020 --> 3:27:48.020]  we saw, that we're now under this through UN mandate.
[3:27:48.020 --> 3:27:52.700]  So you know, everything's UN order, sir, I, I, I report on my employees to the North
[3:27:52.700 --> 3:27:57.380]  American Union, and you show it to a yuppie, and they say, I don't see that, I'll hand
[3:27:57.380 --> 3:28:02.340]  my weapons in if the government tells me, I love government, I, I love being a slave,
[3:28:02.340 --> 3:28:07.860]  oh god, I can lift a finger and stop all this, but I'm not going to, let me ask you, did
[3:28:07.860 --> 3:28:14.180]  you, did you show the 2008 revision to, um, on the show, because I certainly missed it,
[3:28:14.180 --> 3:28:15.700]  and I try to watch every day.
[3:28:15.700 --> 3:28:22.020]  Now, I saw in 2004 and in 1998, well, I've got the 2008, so I'll send it over as soon
[3:28:22.020 --> 3:28:26.980]  as I get off the phone here, and it'll be, uh, under the, uh, the title line will be
[3:28:26.980 --> 3:28:27.980]  shout.
[3:28:27.980 --> 3:28:32.180]  Good, good, thank you so much, listen, I appreciate your call, title line will be shout,
[3:28:32.180 --> 3:28:33.180]  we'll get that up.
[3:28:33.180 --> 3:28:36.580]  Better yet, write an article, because everything you said I know is accurate, so do it, I,
[3:28:36.580 --> 3:28:40.700]  I can't do it, I'm being hit from too many sides, I've been asking Paul Watson and Curt
[3:28:40.700 --> 3:28:44.340]  Nemo, Curt wrote one last Saturday, I've been asking Paul Watson for four days, I said,
[3:28:44.340 --> 3:28:48.660]  write an article about the gun grabbing that ties it in with the White House Chief of Staff
[3:28:48.660 --> 3:28:52.300]  saying, we'll all be on list, no judge, no jury, guilty and the proven innocent, no
[3:28:52.300 --> 3:28:55.580]  owning firearms, tie it in with the bill, and that hadn't happened, but they're working,
[3:28:55.580 --> 3:28:58.820]  they're, Paul's writing two, three articles a day, Steve's writing one or two a day,
[3:28:58.820 --> 3:29:02.660]  Curt's writing articles a day, updating the sites, I may have the money to hire some
[3:29:02.660 --> 3:29:06.460]  more webmasters and writers, but I'm scared to hire people, and by scared, I'm scared
[3:29:06.460 --> 3:29:10.860]  not completing my mission, I mean, there are infiltrators, ladies and gentlemen, there
[3:29:10.860 --> 3:29:17.100]  are a lot of infiltrators, and, uh, you know, it's not pretty, I mean, the feds will get
[3:29:17.100 --> 3:29:20.380]  in your office and they'll come in here and commit crimes and then say, I did it, and
[3:29:20.380 --> 3:29:24.220]  they could come out in court, that they even did it on their own, and it didn't matter,
[3:29:24.220 --> 3:29:29.940]  the judge will say, it doesn't matter, we set you up, and it's, I know that's their
[3:29:29.940 --> 3:29:33.700]  fault and they're evil, but that'll shut down what I'm doing, I mean, this isn't a
[3:29:33.700 --> 3:29:39.660]  game, folks, this is real, this is as hardcore as it gets, and I get all gutted up and fired
[3:29:39.660 --> 3:29:43.600]  up to do what I do every day, but this is real, Jason Burmers for the quick five minute
[3:29:43.600 --> 3:29:48.700]  breaking news report, straight ahead, more of your phone calls and a lot more, I'm Alex
[3:29:48.700 --> 3:29:51.860]  Jones, stay with us, big announcements coming up.
[3:29:51.860 --> 3:29:58.940]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:58.940 --> 3:30:05.300]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[3:30:05.300 --> 3:30:09.580]  self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever, we need to be independent and food
[3:30:09.580 --> 3:30:13.540]  and water is the key, you'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own
[3:30:13.540 --> 3:30:17.220]  bread, you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your
[3:30:17.220 --> 3:30:21.660]  family, in any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family
[3:30:21.660 --> 3:30:23.340]  in the final equation with you.

[3:30:27.660 --> 3:30:32.020]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost of
[3:30:32.020 --> 3:30:33.580]  last year's grocery prices.

[3:30:56.460 --> 3:31:02.060]  Take action today, the first step is getting storable food.
[3:31:02.060 --> 3:31:07.620]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:31:07.620 --> 3:31:13.900]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:31:13.900 --> 3:31:15.460]  just as well funded.
[3:31:15.460 --> 3:31:20.620]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:31:20.620 --> 3:31:21.620]  of the American people.
[3:31:21.620 --> 3:31:26.220]  Well Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:31:26.220 --> 3:31:31.620]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:31:31.620 --> 3:31:38.140]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:31:38.140 --> 3:31:41.700]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[3:31:41.700 --> 3:31:48.620]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:31:48.620 --> 3:31:54.260]  A short copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or downloaded in super high
[3:31:54.260 --> 3:31:56.820]  quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:31:56.820 --> 3:32:01.620]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:32:01.620 --> 3:32:05.940]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and
[3:32:05.940 --> 3:32:10.620]  China have now penetrated our power grid, even as energy experts are reporting that
[3:32:10.620 --> 3:32:14.820]  each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid.
[3:32:14.820 --> 3:32:20.140]  Some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge,
[3:32:20.140 --> 3:32:24.860]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[3:32:24.860 --> 3:32:30.300]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or government created blackouts?
[3:32:30.300 --> 3:32:34.860]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private
[3:32:34.860 --> 3:32:36.740]  supply of electrical power?
[3:32:36.740 --> 3:32:40.900]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[3:32:40.900 --> 3:32:43.340]  Solar powered generators are finally available.
[3:32:43.340 --> 3:32:49.020]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break, and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[3:32:49.020 --> 3:32:56.460]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[3:32:56.460 --> 3:33:16.580]  Check out mysolarbackup.com before you lose your power.
[3:33:16.580 --> 3:33:28.860]  I'm gonna chase the sky forever, with the warm on and the stallion and the wind, and
[3:33:28.860 --> 3:33:39.500]  the sun is gonna burn into a cinder, before we ever pass this way again.
[3:33:39.500 --> 3:33:46.420]  And we're gonna rise, and we're gonna rise, we're gonna rise, we're gonna rise, we're
[3:33:46.420 --> 3:33:54.300]  gonna rise, we're gonna rise, ride like the one eye, ride like the one eye, jack of time,
[3:33:54.300 --> 3:33:57.300]  with the devil close behind.
[3:33:57.300 --> 3:34:00.300]  All right, more of your calls coming up.
[3:34:00.300 --> 3:34:06.100]  I'm from Thomas, Steve, Charles, Tony, and John.
[3:34:06.100 --> 3:34:08.740]  That'll probably be all we can get to.
[3:34:08.740 --> 3:34:11.140]  Jason Burmese, can we have that fly swatter please?
[3:34:11.140 --> 3:34:12.140]  We got it.
[3:34:12.140 --> 3:34:15.980]  You know, we have hundreds of emails pouring in telling us how to get rid of fruit flies.
[3:34:15.980 --> 3:34:19.660]  No one knows where they're coming from, and they're just everywhere in here, landing on
[3:34:19.660 --> 3:34:25.540]  my face, and we got flypaper, and they don't like the flypaper.
[3:34:25.540 --> 3:34:28.060]  They don't care about the flypaper.
[3:34:28.060 --> 3:34:32.140]  They, people are like, well, spray a bunch of poison, I don't want to breathe a bunch
[3:34:32.140 --> 3:34:34.220]  of poison, I'm not using it in here.
[3:34:34.220 --> 3:34:36.380]  You can keep your cancer for yourselves out there.
[3:34:36.380 --> 3:34:40.380]  You know, I was over at my parents' when we could stand there, and I came in the house
[3:34:40.380 --> 3:34:44.500]  about midnight, a couple of roaches running around, big ones, you know, got around here,
[3:34:44.500 --> 3:34:48.940]  there's been rain a lot, they come in the house, and I just, I killed them with a kitchen
[3:34:48.940 --> 3:34:49.940]  rag, popping them.
[3:34:49.940 --> 3:34:53.820]  I could have gone and got poisoned out from under the counter, but no, I don't feel like
[3:34:53.820 --> 3:34:56.700]  killing them and killing myself, killing myself to live.
[3:34:56.700 --> 3:34:59.860]  Okay, now I'm going into ancient exterminating tactics.
[3:34:59.860 --> 3:35:08.380]  That's how they used to kill locusts, was like these big, big switches, get in the fields,
[3:35:08.380 --> 3:35:09.380]  hand-killing the insects.
[3:35:09.380 --> 3:35:10.660]  Okay, let's get serious.
[3:35:10.660 --> 3:35:14.020]  Let me reset here, Christian Momocus, I want to get to this with Burmese and then get to
[3:35:14.020 --> 3:35:15.020]  your calls.
[3:35:15.020 --> 3:35:21.620]  It has come out with top virologist in England, the United States, Canada, Australia, we got
[3:35:21.620 --> 3:35:25.540]  two articles, one up at infowars.com, one at prisonplanet.com, just recapping this in
[3:35:25.540 --> 3:35:27.460]  the new breaking news in a moment.
[3:35:27.460 --> 3:35:40.900]  It has come out, it has come out that Tamiflu developers' swine flu may have been released
[3:35:40.900 --> 3:35:47.220]  from a lab and then there's another article dealing with that and so the point is H1N1
[3:35:47.220 --> 3:35:51.300]  virus manufactured or result of human error, they're saying clearly it has the markers,
[3:35:51.300 --> 3:35:56.060]  it has no pedigree, it wasn't mutated naturally because they can track these viruses.
[3:35:56.060 --> 3:36:01.420]  It just came out of the blue, wrong flu season, wrong hemisphere, which is also why I say
[3:36:01.420 --> 3:36:04.340]  it didn't escape from some lab, this thing had to be spread.
[3:36:04.340 --> 3:36:08.380]  So this is only a whitewash one level, but we're proving right again, will we see retractions
[3:36:08.380 --> 3:36:13.100]  from CNN and others of the tactics, no, but now we know why they're mainly taking down
[3:36:13.100 --> 3:36:18.580]  the swine flu videos I did that are on YouTube, suspending the accounts of the videos everywhere.
[3:36:18.580 --> 3:36:22.340]  It's me, I'm allowed to get on TV and talk, I'm telling people they can post it but YouTube
[3:36:22.340 --> 3:36:23.340]  says no.
[3:36:23.340 --> 3:36:26.660]  They don't even do copyright infringements now, they just take your channel down.
[3:36:26.660 --> 3:36:31.460]  Happen to Nate Evans, happen to all the people I know, this is a badge of honor I think and
[3:36:31.460 --> 3:36:34.100]  Mirmus, you kept saying they were going to get rid of Google videos, we'll talk about
[3:36:34.100 --> 3:36:35.100]  that in a moment.
[3:36:35.100 --> 3:36:42.580]  And now briefly, I remember this in the extras of Oliver Stone's JFK because a new director's
[3:36:42.580 --> 3:36:46.140]  edition came out a few years ago and I watched it on the treadmill.
[3:36:46.140 --> 3:36:49.140]  That's how I watch movies is, you know, in like a two-part series, you know, an hour
[3:36:49.140 --> 3:36:52.180]  on the treadmill and then another hour on the treadmill the next day.
[3:36:52.180 --> 3:36:59.300]  And I remember them talking about how Castro, how a type of flu, a type of fever, a swine
[3:36:59.300 --> 3:37:05.340]  fever had been released in Cuba and then it came out years later in the mainstream news
[3:37:05.340 --> 3:37:06.340]  and that's declassified.
[3:37:06.340 --> 3:37:10.580]  I'd forgotten, you got an email, got a tip, pulled up the San Francisco Chronicle article,
[3:37:10.580 --> 3:37:11.580]  it's confirmed.
[3:37:11.580 --> 3:37:17.220]  So, 76 it pops up on a military base, 1918 it comes out of a U.S. military base.
[3:37:17.220 --> 3:37:20.660]  This new one created in the lab, no doubt about that now.
[3:37:20.660 --> 3:37:27.020]  And who's used this stuff before, the CIA and against Latin America, these guys never
[3:37:27.020 --> 3:37:28.020]  stop.
[3:37:28.020 --> 3:37:32.180]  Every time there's a terror attack, we don't just say it's the government or our government
[3:37:32.180 --> 3:37:36.060]  or some other western government, we go look at the history.
[3:37:36.060 --> 3:37:37.460]  We go look at who's done it before.
[3:37:37.460 --> 3:37:42.900]  It's like if some guy robs a bank and does it a certain way and the files show that a
[3:37:42.900 --> 3:37:47.740]  bank robber was released a year ago in the same area who robs banks, you know, 20 years
[3:37:47.740 --> 3:37:52.340]  before the same way, I'm going to go looking for him.
[3:37:52.340 --> 3:37:56.100]  I mean, and they have the motive and they have the know-how, Burma's give us the latest
[3:37:56.100 --> 3:37:57.100]  development.
[3:37:57.100 --> 3:38:04.200]  So, in 1971, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officials, operatives linked to anti-castro
[3:38:04.200 --> 3:38:09.780]  terrorists introduced African swine fever virus into Cuba and they had a slaughter
[3:38:09.780 --> 3:38:10.780]  of 500,000 pigs.
[3:38:10.780 --> 3:38:14.820]  Now, the only difference between this and the swine flu is that it cannot be transmitted
[3:38:14.820 --> 3:38:15.820]  to humans.
[3:38:15.820 --> 3:38:18.900]  But this was actually broken by a news day, which is a big paper out in New York.
[3:38:18.900 --> 3:38:19.900]  I use it all the time.
[3:38:19.900 --> 3:38:24.020]  A lot of those hard articles in my film Fable Enemies are cut directly out of there.
[3:38:24.020 --> 3:38:27.020]  And I just, this was a bio attack on the farming industry.
[3:38:27.020 --> 3:38:28.220]  This was an economic attack.
[3:38:28.220 --> 3:38:29.220]  Yeah.
[3:38:29.220 --> 3:38:33.820]  And a big part of declassified warfare with the Russians and the U.S., basically remember
[3:38:33.820 --> 3:38:40.980]  the same people now we discover in the past, is crops, is insects, is engineered insects
[3:38:40.980 --> 3:38:44.500]  that they drop insects out of a plane that don't just eat your crops and they've done
[3:38:44.500 --> 3:38:48.100]  this before, but carry a virus or bacteria that kills your crops.
[3:38:48.100 --> 3:38:49.100]  Yeah.
[3:38:49.100 --> 3:38:51.180]  And affects the wildlife around them as well.
[3:38:51.180 --> 3:38:55.300]  What's really interesting is there's four different CIA officials speaking on record
[3:38:55.300 --> 3:39:00.220]  here, they won't give their names, but it runs through places like Fort Gullick, an
[3:39:00.220 --> 3:39:02.620]  army base near Panama Canal Zone.
[3:39:02.620 --> 3:39:07.940]  Of course, the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo was used to traffic this.
[3:39:07.940 --> 3:39:12.020]  And then the final place, I think it was right here, the source of the traveler who had been
[3:39:12.020 --> 3:39:16.620]  trained by the CIA and carried out previous missions for the agency said he saw no CIA
[3:39:16.620 --> 3:39:20.100]  officials aboard the boat that delivered the virus to the trawler in Panama, but added
[3:39:20.100 --> 3:39:25.780]  we were well paid for this and Cuban exile groups don't have that kind of money.
[3:39:25.780 --> 3:39:30.500]  His account was confirmed by another intelligence source in Miami.
[3:39:30.500 --> 3:39:37.140]  It goes on to talk about Venezuela, but basically again, 1971 Jones, almost 40 years ago, they're
[3:39:37.140 --> 3:39:41.740]  releasing a similar bio weapon in a third world nation they're having problems with.
[3:39:41.740 --> 3:39:44.380]  And then we have this swine flu just totally emerged.
[3:39:44.380 --> 3:39:48.700]  First they blame Mexico, then they don't have any pigs that have it in Mexico.
[3:39:48.700 --> 3:39:52.580]  Then they, then it was two weeks ago now, they said, oh, we finally found the first
[3:39:52.580 --> 3:39:55.060]  pig with swine flu and it was in Canada.
[3:39:55.060 --> 3:39:58.820]  And then you have this, uh, this witch for the CFR who did that, uh, swine flu, the
[3:39:58.820 --> 3:40:00.460]  fear and flu article right there.
[3:40:00.460 --> 3:40:03.620]  And she's saying it's right over there, Jones, uh, if you're looking for it, it's right
[3:40:03.620 --> 3:40:05.780]  under that, uh, top magazine right there.
[3:40:05.780 --> 3:40:06.780]  You see it?
[3:40:06.780 --> 3:40:07.780]  The black one.
[3:40:07.780 --> 3:40:08.780]  Yeah.
[3:40:08.780 --> 3:40:09.780]  Yeah.
[3:40:09.780 --> 3:40:10.780]  The little piggy snout favorite photo.
[3:40:10.780 --> 3:40:11.780]  Yeah.
[3:40:11.780 --> 3:40:12.780]  Absolutely.
[3:40:12.780 --> 3:40:14.300]  And she's saying that the swine flu wasn't made in the lab.
[3:40:14.300 --> 3:40:17.220]  And if you believe that, by the way, Jones, you're, you're a conspiracy theorist and a
[3:40:17.220 --> 3:40:18.220]  bad person.
[3:40:18.220 --> 3:40:21.460]  She was founded in America and then she attacks Lou Dobbs.
[3:40:21.460 --> 3:40:24.780]  There hasn't been a single case of swine flu in a pig in America.
[3:40:24.780 --> 3:40:29.260]  And that woman who died, that 33 year old woman, the, the, uh, Texas health officials
[3:40:29.260 --> 3:40:30.820]  admit she didn't die from swine flu.
[3:40:30.820 --> 3:40:32.860]  That child who died, he had chronic illnesses.
[3:40:32.860 --> 3:40:33.860]  He was a premium.
[3:40:33.860 --> 3:40:34.860]  No, she was sick.
[3:40:34.860 --> 3:40:35.860]  She was already dying.
[3:40:35.860 --> 3:40:36.860]  Yeah.
[3:40:36.860 --> 3:40:37.860]  All right.
[3:40:37.860 --> 3:40:38.860]  Key information.
[3:40:38.860 --> 3:40:42.700]  Let's get a blurb by Curt Nimmo or, uh, Paul Watson or Steve Watson or you or somebody.
[3:40:42.700 --> 3:40:46.500]  The info warrior.com, uh, you'll go ahead and just get that posted at least the old San
[3:40:46.500 --> 3:40:49.580]  Francisco Chronicle article, Jason, thanks for coming in to talk to us.
[3:40:49.580 --> 3:40:50.580]  Thank you.
[3:40:50.580 --> 3:40:51.580]  You bet.
[3:40:51.580 --> 3:40:52.580]  All right.
[3:40:52.580 --> 3:40:53.580]  I coming up in about five, six, seven minutes.
[3:40:53.580 --> 3:40:58.460]  I'm going to have, uh, Rob do in here to be as he worked on one of these new presentations,
[3:40:58.460 --> 3:41:00.380]  these new films we're going to be releasing today.
[3:41:00.380 --> 3:41:03.220]  Uh, so I'll be announcing that coming up here in a few minutes.
[3:41:03.220 --> 3:41:07.820]  We are now three hours, 41 minutes into the transmission.
[3:41:07.820 --> 3:41:10.860]  I want to thank a few of the sponsors we've got that have made this show possible.
[3:41:10.860 --> 3:41:12.460]  Then I'm going to go to your calls.
[3:41:12.460 --> 3:41:14.260]  One of them's home game.
[3:41:14.260 --> 3:41:15.260]  Wonderful folks.
[3:41:15.260 --> 3:41:24.420]  They have a street view system, uh, for helping sell your home or finding out its value.
[3:41:24.420 --> 3:41:28.460]  They have a system where you can enter in, uh, your, uh, homes address and it will tell
[3:41:28.460 --> 3:41:32.140]  you instantly, uh, what the value of your home is.
[3:41:32.140 --> 3:41:35.380]  They have a home cell maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most
[3:41:35.380 --> 3:41:36.580]  increase your home's value.
[3:41:36.580 --> 3:41:40.500]  Uh, before you put it on the market for 10 years, these folks have been helping home

[3:44:21.620 --> 3:44:23.100]  final segment.
[3:44:23.100 --> 3:44:25.540]  Let's talk to Thomas in California.
[3:44:25.540 --> 3:44:27.660]  Thomas here on the year.
[3:44:27.660 --> 3:44:28.660]  Welcome.
[3:44:28.660 --> 3:44:29.660]  Hi Alex.
[3:44:29.660 --> 3:44:32.700]  Greetings from the sunny central California coast.
[3:44:32.700 --> 3:44:33.700]  Greetings.
[3:44:33.700 --> 3:44:34.700]  Uh, yeah.
[3:44:34.700 --> 3:44:38.780]  I just wanted to say like, uh, you know, you hear a lot of people talking about, well,
[3:44:38.780 --> 3:44:42.260]  you know, no one's out there doing anything knowing that no one's out there fighting
[3:44:42.260 --> 3:44:48.020]  and, uh, you know, we, we should just either, either give up or we should go and shoot everybody
[3:44:48.020 --> 3:44:50.220]  because we're not having any victories.
[3:44:50.220 --> 3:44:54.500]  And it seems to me that, you know, you may not see it on the news media because that's
[3:44:54.500 --> 3:44:55.500]  the last thing you're going to see.
[3:44:55.500 --> 3:44:56.500]  You stole my thunder.
[3:44:56.500 --> 3:44:58.740]  They never tell you have any chance to beat them.
[3:44:58.740 --> 3:45:01.820]  They want to destroy our morals and come out and go, yeah, we're criminals.
[3:45:01.820 --> 3:45:02.820]  Yeah.
[3:45:02.820 --> 3:45:03.820]  We stole 14 trillion.
[3:45:03.820 --> 3:45:05.780]  I won't tell you where it is.
[3:45:05.780 --> 3:45:11.340]  They want to make you capitulate as soon as you find an issue and you decide to enter
[3:45:11.340 --> 3:45:16.060]  that fight, you will find people coming out of the woodworks trying to help you.
[3:45:16.060 --> 3:45:21.100]  You will find so many groups on that issue, all fighting it, all having so many victories
[3:45:21.100 --> 3:45:24.660]  here, so many victories there in their own little ways.
[3:45:24.660 --> 3:45:28.460]  But of course the news doesn't cover it and of course, and, uh, yeah, I mean, look, look
[3:45:28.460 --> 3:45:31.820]  at where we'd be if, if, if after the Iraq war, people didn't take to the streets by
[3:45:31.820 --> 3:45:32.820]  the millions.
[3:45:32.820 --> 3:45:36.580]  We already would have invaded Iran, we would have already invaded Syria.
[3:45:36.580 --> 3:45:37.580]  Exactly.
[3:45:37.580 --> 3:45:41.860]  Look, look, Tokyo rose would tell the GIs, even when Japan was defeated, they'd broadcast
[3:45:41.860 --> 3:45:45.540]  on the radio, America's defeated, you've lost, you can't win.
[3:45:45.540 --> 3:45:46.540]  It's all over for you.
[3:45:46.540 --> 3:45:50.940]  And some GIs, even though they knew that Japan was blown to bits and about to be physically
[3:45:50.940 --> 3:45:51.940]  invaded.
[3:45:51.940 --> 3:45:56.780]  You know, this is weeks before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some GIs actually believed it.
[3:45:56.780 --> 3:45:57.780]  It's the same thing.
[3:45:57.780 --> 3:45:58.780]  They tell you, there's no hope.
[3:45:58.780 --> 3:45:59.780]  There's no way to beat it.
[3:45:59.780 --> 3:46:00.780]  There's nothing you can do.
[3:46:00.780 --> 3:46:02.860]  I appreciate your call.
[3:46:02.860 --> 3:46:06.540]  I'm even going to overdrive today because I want to get to Steve, Charles, Tony, John
[3:46:06.540 --> 3:46:08.060]  others and we'll try to cram you in.
[3:46:08.060 --> 3:46:11.980]  I got two trailers to play and I'm almost out of time to do this.
[3:46:11.980 --> 3:46:15.420]  Number one, because this is a bigger announcement because we're going to have one of these every
[3:46:15.420 --> 3:46:18.980]  month, but the next announcement is even bigger individually.
[3:46:18.980 --> 3:46:25.140]  Uh, it is the Alex Jones show, another weapon in the fight for freedom DVD arsenal.
[3:46:25.140 --> 3:46:31.420]  The Alex Jones show volume one January, 2009, every week or two, a new one up to catching
[3:46:31.420 --> 3:46:36.220]  up to six months in will be out and by the end of the year, we're going to have 12 of
[3:46:36.220 --> 3:46:40.580]  these and you can get them all together, 1495.
[3:46:40.580 --> 3:46:42.620]  It's up on info wars.com.
[3:46:42.620 --> 3:46:47.780]  This is featuring David, Joe Rogan, Alan Watts, Gerald Salente, Arte Cervado, and these videos
[3:46:47.780 --> 3:46:50.060]  are all in super high quality.
[3:46:50.060 --> 3:46:51.700]  That's these are printed DVDs.
[3:46:51.700 --> 3:46:55.340]  These have documents extras, you know, stuff added.
[3:46:55.340 --> 3:46:58.700]  This is for people that don't just want to see it in prison planet.tv because I upload
[3:46:58.700 --> 3:47:02.540]  my film in super high quality, but the live stream so people can stream it live and pick
[3:47:02.540 --> 3:47:03.540]  it up.
[3:47:03.540 --> 3:47:04.540]  It's only medium quality.
[3:47:04.540 --> 3:47:07.220]  This is high quality seeing it as a difference between night and day.
[3:47:07.220 --> 3:47:11.300]  It's great to give people folks kept asking for these.
[3:47:11.300 --> 3:47:12.540]  This is now manufactured.
[3:47:12.540 --> 3:47:16.620]  This came in earlier in the week, what came in Monday.
[3:47:16.620 --> 3:47:21.620]  And so we have these in the next film is going to be in here in a week, but it won't
[3:47:21.620 --> 3:47:25.100]  ship till June 3rd.
[3:47:25.100 --> 3:47:27.100]  And that's a totally separate film.
[3:47:27.100 --> 3:47:32.820]  So now, now, now again, this is really a presentation, the film I'll tell you about in the next segment.
[3:47:32.820 --> 3:47:34.540]  But this is a big announcement.
[3:47:34.540 --> 3:47:35.540]  Great way.
[3:47:35.540 --> 3:47:36.540]  You see David Ike there on the cover.
[3:47:36.540 --> 3:47:41.700]  This is the first month and it's the David Ike, Joe Rogan, Alan Watts, Gerald Salente,
[3:47:41.700 --> 3:47:42.700]  Arte Cervado.
[3:47:42.700 --> 3:47:44.100]  That's the Austin police chief.
[3:47:44.100 --> 3:47:50.020]  This is really power packed Rob, do and Jason Douglas have been working on these tell folks
[3:47:50.020 --> 3:47:52.220]  about the new DVD arsenal.
[3:47:52.220 --> 3:47:54.060]  This has been really a treat.
[3:47:54.060 --> 3:47:57.580]  And basically when you hired me, you said, look, I need you to spearhead this project
[3:47:57.580 --> 3:47:59.340]  and me and Jason really took it on.
[3:47:59.340 --> 3:48:04.380]  And, you know, we've been pouring over these, all these interviews that you do trying to
[3:48:04.380 --> 3:48:06.620]  find the best parts of each interview.
[3:48:06.620 --> 3:48:11.100]  We look at a calendar to see who you had that month and we really find the best ones.
[3:48:11.100 --> 3:48:14.460]  And we take out, you know, a lot of the fluff in the article.
[3:48:14.460 --> 3:48:18.300]  It gets down to the nitty gritty, you know, the real good information that people can
[3:48:18.300 --> 3:48:19.300]  do.
[3:48:19.300 --> 3:48:20.540]  They just hack this stuff out.
[3:48:20.540 --> 3:48:24.620]  It's all edited, condensed, it's kind of like a video reader's digest.
[3:48:24.620 --> 3:48:25.620]  It really is.
[3:48:25.620 --> 3:48:26.620]  It really is.
[3:48:26.620 --> 3:48:28.580]  And it's, it's really something you could take and say, wow, this is kind of what was
[3:48:28.580 --> 3:48:30.260]  going on this month.
[3:48:30.260 --> 3:48:35.100]  You know, that month, it was a lot about expanding your mind and how, you know, how to break yourself
[3:48:35.100 --> 3:48:36.540]  out of that mental prison.
[3:48:36.540 --> 3:48:41.900]  Next month is all about like February is all about personal freedom and state sovereignty.
[3:48:41.900 --> 3:48:45.900]  Yeah, we've got Russell means and next month is just a print out because the DVDs aren't
[3:48:45.900 --> 3:48:46.900]  here yet.
[3:48:46.900 --> 3:48:47.900]  So this isn't on sale yet.
[3:48:47.900 --> 3:48:48.900]  These are, and you can buy this right now.
[3:48:48.900 --> 3:48:51.300]  I just went up minutes ago.
[3:48:51.300 --> 3:48:58.340]  This is a, this has got Russell means, Lindsay Williams, Edwin Vieira, Sean Castinger, Craig
[3:48:58.340 --> 3:49:00.900]  proudly and state sovereignty special.
[3:49:00.900 --> 3:49:01.900]  Yeah.
[3:49:01.900 --> 3:49:02.900]  A whole bunch of state reps on this one.
[3:49:02.900 --> 3:49:04.700]  He's about five state reps.
[3:49:04.700 --> 3:49:09.700]  The best of those interviews put together and it really gives you a good history into,
[3:49:09.700 --> 3:49:12.980]  you know, the state sovereignty movement, where it's going and we're already working
[3:49:12.980 --> 3:49:13.980]  on March.
[3:49:13.980 --> 3:49:14.980]  March is almost done.
[3:49:14.980 --> 3:49:15.980]  Here's Chuck Norris.
[3:49:15.980 --> 3:49:16.980]  Yeah.
[3:49:16.980 --> 3:49:21.900]  It's Chuck Norris, Webster, Tarbley, John McManus, judge, the Palatona professor, George
[3:49:21.900 --> 3:49:22.900]  Grayson.
[3:49:22.900 --> 3:49:23.900]  Yep.
[3:49:23.900 --> 3:49:24.900]  Just amazing work.
[3:49:24.900 --> 3:49:29.260]  So we've really been, you know, working hard on these and what's what I think is really
[3:49:29.260 --> 3:49:31.180]  cool is the beginning of each one.
[3:49:31.180 --> 3:49:36.180]  We specially produced a little segment that you're really not going to see anywhere else.
[3:49:36.180 --> 3:49:42.620]  The first one we took a, a speech that Alex gave at a 9 11 truth.
[3:49:42.620 --> 3:49:43.620]  Yeah.
[3:49:43.620 --> 3:49:44.620]  Go ahead and roll this.
[3:49:44.620 --> 3:49:45.620]  This is from the January edition intro.
[3:49:45.620 --> 3:49:47.620]  I think it will go out to break with this.
[3:49:47.620 --> 3:49:52.620]  The men, they seem proud to be in a better field.
[3:49:52.620 --> 3:50:05.740]  A lot of people before us sacrificed and died in the defense of liberty and the fight against
[3:50:05.740 --> 3:50:06.740]  tyranny.
[3:50:06.740 --> 3:50:07.740]  A lot of people died.
[3:50:07.740 --> 3:50:14.740]  So we have a little bit of freedoms we've got their precious they were paid for in blood.
[3:50:14.740 --> 3:50:21.740]  I want you to take action because they can kill us individually, but they cannot kill
[3:50:21.740 --> 3:50:24.740]  ideas.
[3:50:24.740 --> 3:50:28.740]  Ideas are eternal.
[3:50:28.740 --> 3:50:34.740]  Ideas when they're the truth are invincible and ideas are bulletproof.
[3:50:34.740 --> 3:50:41.740]  And I'm here to tell you, I don't need you to thank me and tell me I've done a good job.
[3:50:41.740 --> 3:50:44.740]  I've done nothing but my duty.
[3:50:44.740 --> 3:50:49.740]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people and I've been
[3:50:49.740 --> 3:50:57.740]  fighting them for 13 years and I'll never stop while I'm drawing real.
[3:50:57.740 --> 3:50:58.740]  We'll be right back.
[3:50:58.740 --> 3:51:01.740]  Stay with us.

[3:52:00.300 --> 3:52:07.020]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the
[3:52:07.020 --> 3:52:08.020]  spear.
[3:52:08.020 --> 3:52:12.660]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all
[3:52:12.660 --> 3:52:14.100]  of us would like to see.
[3:52:14.100 --> 3:52:19.260]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:19.260 --> 3:52:20.500]  of the American people.
[3:52:20.500 --> 3:52:25.020]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:25.020 --> 3:52:30.140]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:30.140 --> 3:52:36.020]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[3:52:36.020 --> 3:52:41.820]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.820 --> 3:52:48.700]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:52:54.220 --> 3:52:56.900]  High Quality at PrismPlanet.tv.
[3:52:56.900 --> 3:53:00.300]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:53:00.300 --> 3:53:02.700]  Ah, springtime.
[3:53:02.700 --> 3:53:06.300]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using
[3:53:06.300 --> 3:53:08.300]  toxic chemicals and poisons?
[3:53:08.300 --> 3:53:12.940]  The answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[3:53:12.940 --> 3:53:17.500]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP
[3:53:17.500 --> 3:53:18.820]  to kill parasites.
[3:53:18.820 --> 3:53:23.580]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant
[3:53:23.580 --> 3:53:27.380]  to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[3:53:27.380 --> 3:53:30.420]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[3:53:30.420 --> 3:53:34.820]  More natural insecticides work in the home, on plants and in your garden, killing pests
[3:53:34.820 --> 3:53:39.580]  mechanically not with poisons, so pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your
[3:53:39.580 --> 3:53:41.300]  children or pets.
[3:53:41.300 --> 3:53:46.900]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas, roaches, crickets and more,
[3:53:46.900 --> 3:53:51.180]  and safe enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.

[3:54:13.060 --> 3:54:18.780]  and everybody requested it, you know, Aaron Russo told me, I may not make it with this
[3:54:18.780 --> 3:54:23.260]  cancer and I want you to come interview me, it's his idea.
[3:54:23.260 --> 3:54:27.780]  As we talked about Nick Rockefeller on the air and stuff, it was important, he was down
[3:54:27.780 --> 3:54:32.460]  in Houston, he had cancer four years, had scores of surgeries, he could hardly walk
[3:54:32.460 --> 3:54:33.460]  when I got there.
[3:54:33.460 --> 3:54:36.060]  He couldn't do it the first day, he was supposed to, we had to wait a day and we did it the
[3:54:36.060 --> 3:54:37.060]  next day.
[3:54:37.060 --> 3:54:39.940]  He wouldn't talk about that on air, I mean he could hardly walk, he's in pain during
[3:54:39.940 --> 3:54:43.860]  the interview and it's the last videotape interview with Aaron Russo and we released
[3:54:43.860 --> 3:54:47.780]  large parts of it to PrismPlanet.tv and then on the web there's millions of views of it,
[3:54:47.780 --> 3:54:52.100]  I mean it's all over the place, millions, one will have a million views, 1,600,000 views,
[3:54:52.100 --> 3:54:56.020]  1,300,000 views, you know, the versions of it, but there was a lot of the interview that
[3:54:56.020 --> 3:55:02.380]  we didn't release and there was, you know, even stuff with us arguing behind the scenes
[3:55:02.380 --> 3:55:06.140]  a little bit about this point or that point and also we interviewed him when we went to
[3:55:06.140 --> 3:55:10.940]  dinner with him and that's in there and it's 90 minutes and I did little two minute updates
[3:55:10.940 --> 3:55:14.980]  four or five times, six times in the film where I tie in what he said then two years
[3:55:14.980 --> 3:55:17.580]  ago with what's now happening today.
[3:55:17.580 --> 3:55:24.940]  So it is a 91 minute film and let's go ahead and punch it up, it is a legacy of freedom
[3:55:24.940 --> 3:55:29.180]  that will live on, you can pre-order that but it ships June 3rd and these come in next
[3:55:29.180 --> 3:55:31.940]  week so we'll be packing them up and you'll get them very, very quickly, it will also
[3:55:31.940 --> 3:55:38.700]  be at PrismPlanet.tv and you can order right now the DVD Arsenal Part 1, this bad boy right
[3:55:38.700 --> 3:55:44.740]  here with David Eich on the front, David Eich, Alan Watt, Gerald Salente, Joe Rogan and
[3:55:44.740 --> 3:55:51.860]  Art Acevedo and myself of course but this, we spent a month or so, you know, taking
[3:55:51.860 --> 3:55:57.260]  the old interview on the tape since it's in high quality, you know, it's shot in high
[3:55:57.260 --> 3:56:02.540]  def, of course then it's condensed to a regular DVD but it has that high def look, it's got
[3:56:02.540 --> 3:56:07.660]  all this new documentation video put over Aaron and it talks about in the Fed and how
[3:56:07.660 --> 3:56:12.780]  we got rid of the bankers and a call to action, very important film, people kept requesting
[3:56:12.780 --> 3:56:17.060]  this for the last two years, hey, put that on DVD and I said hey, it's free on the internet.
[3:56:17.060 --> 3:56:25.020]  Well we did what you wanted, you can pre-order the film Reflections and Warnings, a legacy
[3:56:25.020 --> 3:56:28.660]  of freedom that will live on with Aaron Russo, with all the key info about the women's live
[3:56:28.660 --> 3:56:34.940]  movement being CIA, let's go ahead and play that trailer right now, here is the trailer,
[3:56:34.940 --> 3:56:38.380]  it's actually on that shopping cart page, here it is, we've got it up on YouTube, let's
[3:56:38.380 --> 3:56:42.820]  have this go viral before they delete it, who knows, maybe I'm not allowed to show my
[3:56:42.820 --> 3:56:46.180]  interview with Aaron Russo, anyways back it up, back it up, let's start it over here
[3:56:46.180 --> 3:56:50.620]  because I was talking, again, here it is, while it's on YouTube, see it while you can,
[3:56:50.620 --> 3:56:57.660]  here's the trailer, here it is, Aaron Russo, the founder of a nationwide movement to end
[3:56:57.660 --> 3:57:01.780]  the private Federal Reserve, they have all the money they want, they can make all the
[3:57:01.780 --> 3:57:07.460]  money they want, they have a machine, they can make all the money, it's not about money,
[3:57:07.460 --> 3:57:11.060]  it's about control, it's about their vision of how they want to see the world, this was
[3:57:11.060 --> 3:57:16.780]  Aaron Russo's final videotaped interview, the whole agenda is to create a one-world
[3:57:16.780 --> 3:57:24.740]  government where everybody has an RFID chip implanted in them, all money is to be in those
[3:57:24.740 --> 3:57:28.260]  chips, and this is getting me straight from Rockefeller himself, this is what they want
[3:57:28.260 --> 3:57:32.580]  to accomplish, we've never before seen sections of the historic interview, Faro's
[3:57:32.580 --> 3:57:37.140]  area is poison to our country, and what do you think women's liberation was about?
[3:57:37.140 --> 3:57:41.820]  We the Rockefellers funded that, we funded women's liberation, they do whatever they
[3:57:41.820 --> 3:57:47.100]  want to do, what we want doesn't matter anymore, it's their agenda, it's their plans
[3:57:47.100 --> 3:57:53.900]  that matter, released in full for the first time, what happened in 9-11 is a phony, you
[3:57:53.900 --> 3:57:58.220]  know, and we've never learned the truth about 9-11, you hear George Bush saying democracy
[3:57:58.220 --> 3:58:04.060]  means freedom, no, democracy equals new world order, I believe God put me on this earth
[3:58:04.060 --> 3:58:07.340]  to be the best person I could be, and put everybody on this earth to be the best they
[3:58:07.340 --> 3:58:08.340]  could be.
[3:58:08.340 --> 3:58:14.180]  You have to stand up for what's right in life, unless you do that, you're nothing.
[3:58:14.180 --> 3:58:19.780]  Reflections and warnings, an interview with Aaron Russo, coming to the Info War, June
[3:58:19.780 --> 3:58:24.780]  3rd, 2009.
[3:58:24.780 --> 3:58:28.900]  Alright, I'm not going to do overdrive, I promise to Charles, and Tony, and John, and
[3:58:28.900 --> 3:58:33.060]  Steve, and everybody, call me tomorrow, you'll go ahead of the line, great job Rob, dude,
[3:58:33.060 --> 3:58:36.020]  hey, what do you think of the new, you see the new Aaron Russo film?
[3:58:36.020 --> 3:58:40.220]  I came in one morning and watched the whole thing, I mean it was awesome, there's nobody
[3:58:40.220 --> 3:58:42.660]  here in the office, and I just sat down and watched it, it was great.
[3:58:42.660 --> 3:58:51.940]  God bless you all, get it on DDD, Transmission continues, InfoWars.com get it.
[3:58:51.940 --> 3:58:56.420]  Human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides
[3:58:56.420 --> 3:59:00.500]  plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment, studies have
[3:59:00.500 --> 3:59:06.660]  shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[3:59:06.660 --> 3:59:12.180]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.
