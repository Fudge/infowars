[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[00:25.000 --> 00:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the quickening is here. Our country is in the middle of a civil war
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  between the deep state and elements of our government that want to try to have this country
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  actually be sovereign. President Trump gave a speech that was beyond historical.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  I had Lord Mounted on yesterday and he's not one that gets into hype.
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  He's been coming on the show 18 years or so and he said that this was the greatest speech
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  that Trump's ever given, one of the greatest speeches ever given in history
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  when you realize the time we're in and everything he said and did.
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.000]  Now I have a 16 minute boil down that we're going to be going over here today
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  and I've got a bunch of clips that I'm also going to be playing throughout the transmission.
[01:08.000 --> 01:16.000]  The speech was throwing down the gauntlet to the deep state, putting down communism, socialism,
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  attacking the attacks on the family, going after big tech censorship, pointing out that
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  globalism will not govern the people of the planet into the future.
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  This was an amazing speech.
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  Highlights of Trump's dynamite anti-new world order speech delivered in the U.N.
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  are posted to band.video and infowars.com and the special reports area.
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  Now that said, for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:44.000 --> 01:51.000]  We have a new giant hoax with the total proof with the declassified transcript of the phone call
[01:51.000 --> 01:59.000]  that President Trump did not offer pro quo where you offer someone something so you get something back.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  He said, I want you to buy U.S. weapons and do us a favor in the 30 minute conversation.
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.000]  Then later he says, man, I heard about Biden and how he brags on television that he ordered them
[02:11.000 --> 02:14.000]  not to investigate his son or he'd take a billion dollars away.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  That was the crime at the CFR.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  We're going to play a clip of that in a moment.
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.000]  So we have the total proof.
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  This is yet another hoax, but even more transparent than the Russia situation, the fake dossier,
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  but they're still going forward.
[02:28.000 --> 02:35.000]  This is only the third president that they've actually started an impeachment process on.
[02:35.000 --> 02:45.000]  You've got what Jefferson Davis, you've got Clinton, and then you've got Trump.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  So the proceedings have been started.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  Will it ever get to a full vote in the house?
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  Probably not now, but the next round.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  They're just getting everybody used to this right now.
[02:54.000 --> 03:04.000]  Now Trump's approval rating went up when he did this.
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  So we're going to be looking at every angle of this today, but here's what Trump put out over the weekend.
[03:10.000 --> 03:11.000]  Wait a second.
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  Not one single one.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  That or ABC News investigation this morning into Joe Biden's son Hunter and questions about money he made
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  from foreign business dealings while his father was vice president.
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  You have a big story tonight on the New York Times website.
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  Tomorrow, page one of the print edition was Hunter Biden profiting off his dad's work as vice president.
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  And did Joe Biden allow it?
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  We're talking about millions of dollars in at least two countries.
[03:42.000 --> 03:50.000]  We have Joe Biden as vice president having intervened to sort of force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor
[03:50.000 --> 03:59.000]  who happened to have an open case looking into a company, a Ukrainian gas company that was employing Joe Biden's son.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  There's no reason to pay Hunter Biden $50,000 a month.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  Hunter Biden worked for a natural gas company in Ukraine, which is totally fair game.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  Did the vice president's son use his dad's influence to make money somewhere in the world?
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.000]  That's totally fair game.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  A potential conflict of interest there that I think Joe Biden will have to answer for.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  Hunter Biden's work with the company reportedly sparked concern among State Department officials.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  But was it right for Hunter Biden to take a job like that in Ukraine while his father was engaged in diplomacy there?
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  There is a story here.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.000]  We've told some of it.
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  There's more to be told.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  I'm telling you, you're not getting a billion dollars.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  I said, you're not getting a billion.
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.000]  I'm going to be leaving here.
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  I think it was, what, six hours?
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  I looked, I said, leaving six hours.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[04:42.000 --> 04:59.000]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[04:59.000 --> 05:27.000]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.000]  Hey, I told you, don't go to ban that video.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  I'm watching you.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  Soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  Do what CNN says and do not visit ban that video.
[05:54.000 --> 06:06.000]  I have to hurt you.
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[06:09.000 --> 06:22.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  Well, it's only happened a few times in history.
[06:25.000 --> 06:29.000]  And impeachment proceedings have begun against President Trump.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  We're going to cover that in a moment.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  The fact that he's released the transcript was called and none of what you've heard is true.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  It's a giant hoax yet again to cover up the crimes of Joe Biden,
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  who bragged on national television on C-SPAN that he threatened to fire a prosecutor
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  when he was vice president.
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.000]  He said, if you don't fire him, we won't give you a billion dollars.
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  We're going to be showing you that video coming up here in just a moment.
[06:51.000 --> 06:57.000]  But the deep state is making its move right now against our free society.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  This is a major quickening.
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  And you saw that incredible speech at the United Nations yesterday by the president.
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.000]  We're going to be going over today.
[07:05.000 --> 07:11.000]  That's why the system's coming after him because multinational corporations got control of the U.S.
[07:11.000 --> 07:18.000]  and parlayed our military and economic power into building their corporate world government.
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  And they decided to again make their base of operations China because of this incredible authoritarianism.
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  Because they're above the law.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  So that's the reason they're coming after Trump is because he really is the president.
[07:30.000 --> 07:37.000]  And he's announcing that globalism, unelected multinational corporations allied with authoritarian states,
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  will not govern the future.
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  Here is part of that historic speech.
[07:43.000 --> 07:56.000]  Like those who met us before, our time is one of great contests, high stakes and clear choices.
[07:56.000 --> 08:08.000]  The essential divide that runs all around the world and throughout history is once again thrown into stark relief.
[08:08.000 --> 08:19.000]  It is the divide between those whose thirst for control deludes them into thinking they are destined to rule over others
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.000]  and those people and nations who want only to rule themselves.
[08:26.000 --> 08:40.000]  I have the immense privilege of addressing you today as the elected leader of a nation that prizes liberty, independence and self-government above all.
[08:40.000 --> 08:50.000]  The United States, after having spent over two and a half trillion dollars since my election to completely rebuild our great military,
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  is also by far the world's most powerful nation.
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.000]  Hopefully it will never have to use this power.
[09:00.000 --> 09:13.000]  Americans know that in a world where others seek conquest and domination, our nation must be strong in wealth, in might and in spirit.
[09:13.000 --> 09:24.000]  That is why the United States vigorously defends the traditions and customs that have made us who we are.
[09:24.000 --> 09:34.000]  Like my beloved country, each nation represented in this hall has a cherished history, culture and heritage
[09:34.000 --> 09:43.000]  that is worth defending and celebrating and which gives us our singular potential and strength.
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  The free world must embrace its national foundations.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  It must not attempt to erase them or replace them.
[09:54.000 --> 10:06.000]  Looking around and all over this large, magnificent planet, the truth is plain to see.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  If you want freedom, take pride in your country.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty.
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  And if you want peace, love your nation.
[10:21.000 --> 10:29.000]  Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first.
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  The future belongs to patriots.
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.000]  The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens,
[10:43.000 --> 10:53.000]  respect their neighbors and honor the differences that make each country special and unique.
[10:53.000 --> 11:00.000]  Now the UN head has come out and said the world is divided between the United States and China's leadership.
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.000]  And the UN chief laid out who's on China's side and who's on the US side.
[11:06.000 --> 11:18.000]  And it's exactly as I've been saying for 10 years, the exact same groups are allied against America.
[11:18.000 --> 11:28.000]  China doesn't allow Muslims in their country and any Muslims that live in the west of China are on a very short leash.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  But they fund radical Islam.
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  They work with radical Islam and they lobby and push for open borders in Europe and here.
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.000]  radical Islam, expansionist Islam, the Chai comms, the big mega banks, the EU, Hollywood and the global left,
[11:43.000 --> 11:51.000]  all allied against Christianity, whether you're black or white, Hispanic, male, female, you're Christian, they're against you.
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  Protestant Catholic, they don't care.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  The Chai comms are allied against Christendom.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  They're allied against the west and the Renaissance.
[11:59.000 --> 12:07.000]  What the world is, is Western ideas in the United States and a few ragtag countries that work with us or have stayed neutral.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  And it's the whole rest of the world against us.
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  And the big multinationals have set China up and let them steal all of our intellectual property.
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  They don't recognize our courts.
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.000]  We can have a brand new car or new engine or new device roll off the assembly line.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  They buy it or they smuggle it into China.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  We even have export rules and they clone it instantly and won't even let us sell our goods there.
[12:32.000 --> 12:41.000]  And so that's why Trump is the arts criminal who are to the left because the neocons on the left have parlayed American power off into the rest of the world.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  They made themselves fabulously rich selling this off, selling that off.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  And now they know we're pissed off about their policies.
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  So they want to go ahead and take our guns and take our children and further emasculate us, domesticate us.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  This is all in the WikiLeaks.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  All their statements. This is a corrupt ruling class that hates America.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  They're so desperate to shut us down.
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  They're so desperate to finish the job off because Hillary and the globalists have committed so many crimes.
[13:09.000 --> 13:16.000]  Obama and the deep state and the comies of the world sold out our uranium, sold out our secrets, sold out all of our spies.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  They sold it all out.
[13:19.000 --> 13:27.000]  And now they don't know what to do because we've got a president in with a beachhead who's getting the economy back, getting the love of the nation back, stabilizing things.
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  And they are desperate to crash the economy openly and desperate to start a civil war.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  And now the Pentagon issues an emergency alert.
[13:33.000 --> 13:41.000]  It's going up on info wars.com right now that they believe incel antifa is going to do mass shootings at theaters and that Joker is designed to do it.
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  Of course it is.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  All that Hollywood is designed to cause a civil war.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  I had people inside major film conferences where they admit it.
[13:49.000 --> 14:00.000]  There's Trump calling out the chai comms on the theft of this nation's future and that are.
[14:00.000 --> 14:12.000]  Center of our vision for national renewal is an ambitious campaign to reform international trade.
[14:12.000 --> 14:23.000]  For decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in very bad faith.
[14:23.000 --> 14:32.000]  As jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class.
[14:32.000 --> 14:41.000]  In America, the result was 4.2 million lost manufacturing jobs and $15 trillion in trade deficits.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  You know what, I hit pause right there.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  I was looking at another clip that was two minutes.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  This one's five.
[14:46.000 --> 14:55.000]  This is the most important clip because this was strategically done and is admitted by the CFR who said 40 years ago, the next century will be the Chinese Communist century.
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.000]  And David Rockefeller wrote in the New York Times, you can read it, that he maneuvered us into this position.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  So this is how they conquered us.
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.000]  So when we come back, I'm going to play this clip where he explains our surrender is over and the one side of deals are over.
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  And this is why they're hitting the panic switch and freaking out so bad then.
[15:16.000 --> 15:28.000]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to read to you from the actual declassified memo that was released early this morning.
[15:28.000 --> 15:36.000]  I'm going to show you that he didn't do any of the things they said, but I'm going to show you Biden publicly saying he did what they say Trump did.
[15:36.000 --> 15:43.000]  Where he threatens a billion dollars to be taken from Ukraine if the prosecutor keeps investigating his dirty corrupt filthy son.
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  It came in there and eluded their economy like a carpet bag and filth bag he is.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  This is the arrogance of these people.
[15:50.000 --> 15:57.000]  This is all a smokescreen to cover up what Hillary and Biden did.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:03.000 --> 16:04.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:07.000 --> 16:13.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  I can help you too.
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:19.000 --> 16:27.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:30.000 --> 16:36.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.000]  Bill Hyde here.
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:57.000 --> 17:03.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.000]  Over a thousand dollars in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay 750 or $500, 300 or even 200.

[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  I'm a new world order who's really taken the mask off.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  Because you are truly activist in the arena.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support,
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  this operation that you built, that your operation will not be here.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  We got some giant specials running right now at mfoworkstore.com.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  A lot of items, pretty percent off.
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  Please take advantage of it at mfoworkstore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.000]  I want to thank the listeners of this broadcast.
[19:01.000 --> 19:02.000]  I want to thank our affiliates.
[19:02.000 --> 19:03.000]  I want to thank our sponsors.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  I want to thank the mfowers crew.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.000]  And I want to thank God in heaven, the ruler of our universe.
[19:10.000 --> 19:16.000]  For the fact that Donald Trump is delivering on so much, he's promised to do.
[19:16.000 --> 19:21.000]  The speech at the UN is as important as Eisenhower's military industrial complex.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  Beware of their tyranny speech.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  We talked about technological elite.
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  He came out and he exposed how big tech is a new ruling class that is manipulating the minds of the people
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  and engaging in massive oppression.
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  And he talked about how globalism is not the future of the world.
[19:39.000 --> 19:45.000]  And Trump has done a great job exposing the UN, the globalists and the chai cons in their house
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  that the Rockefellers set up in New York, the UN.
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  This was incredible.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[19:54.000 --> 20:23.000]  The future belongs to patriots.
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.000]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[20:29.000 --> 20:48.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:48.000 --> 20:55.000]  Say that there are giant storm clouds over Washington, DC and over the world right now is an understatement.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  Again, this isn't some Hollywood movie.
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  This isn't some Netflix drama.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  This isn't House of Cards.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  This is the real world.
[21:03.000 --> 21:10.000]  It's far more dangerous and far more serious than any of the degenerates in Hollywood can even try to imagine.
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones again on this live Global Wednesday transmission.
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.000]  We have Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer joining us in the second hour.
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  I have filed suit against the young Turks and others in federal court today.
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  That's on infowars.com.
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  And instead of just posting the suit copy itself, we're waiting to get back from the court.
[21:31.000 --> 21:32.000]  The receipt of it would be the clerk.
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  That should be up in the next 10 minutes in the article at infowars.com.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  But that's part of us getting back on the offense.
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  We're suing two other groups as well.
[21:40.000 --> 21:48.000]  One of the groups we're suing on the suit said that I tried to kill or excuse me, tried to kill Sandy Hook children.
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  I mean, the lives are just escalating.
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  So I have to defend myself.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  I'm not happy having to do this, but they refuse to retract any of it.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  And we're suing some more folks in another suit that's filed tomorrow.
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  But this is a serious fight.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  And Trump's fighting back.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.000]  He's the real deal.
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  Again, doesn't mean he's perfect, but my God compared to Hillary Clinton, he's a whole other universe.
[22:09.000 --> 22:17.000]  And we need to really be praying for peace and justice and transparency and discernment right now.
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  Because you could feel the energy.
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  Evil knows it's in trouble.
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  Evil was throwing everything.
[22:22.000 --> 22:23.000]  It's God of humanity.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  And for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  The next segment, I'll go into the hoax that is this fourth impeachment in U.S. history.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  Technically, two people have been impeached.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  Two others have had proceedings begin against them.
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  And that fourth one is Trump.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  So we're going to be looking at all of that.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and others.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  I said Jeff Davis for some reason.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  That's the Confederate president for some reason.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  I'm teleprompter free folks.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  So sometimes it comes out wrong, but not on purpose.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  So the best coverage of this is at drudgereport.com for a website.
[22:54.000 --> 22:59.000]  The best live analysis will be right here at newswars.com, infowars.com.
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  And of course, expanding on that at bayon.video.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  And we're going to have Mike Adams come in and co-host as well.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  He's a loaded forbearer and expert on all these topics.
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  He was going to come in about, we discovered that Google's already had quantum computing
[23:11.000 --> 23:12.000]  before they announced it.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  They can already break basically any encryption.
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  This is earth shaking news as well.
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.000]  And people are starting to learn we don't make stuff up.
[23:19.000 --> 23:25.000]  It came out yesterday that it's been known for three years that...
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  Well, I'll tell you about it later with the smartphones and TVs, but this is incredible.
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of the president again,
[23:33.000 --> 23:37.000]  talking about the real economic war against us in the last 40 years.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  We didn't start the war with China.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  We're just now fighting for our lives and realizing we're under attack.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  Here it is.
[23:42.000 --> 23:54.000]  At the center of our vision for national renewal is an ambitious campaign to reform international trade.
[23:54.000 --> 24:05.000]  For decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in very bad faith.
[24:05.000 --> 24:14.000]  As jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class.
[24:14.000 --> 24:28.000]  In America, the result was 4.2 million lost manufacturing jobs and $15 trillion in trade deficits over the last quarter century.
[24:28.000 --> 24:36.000]  The United States is now taking that decisive action to end this grave economic injustice.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  Our goal is simple.
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal.
[24:43.000 --> 24:55.000]  We have worked closely with our partners in Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA with the brand new and hopefully bipartisan U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement.
[24:55.000 --> 25:04.000]  Tomorrow, I will join Prime Minister Abe of Japan to continue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  As the United Kingdom makes preparations to exit the European Union,
[25:10.000 --> 25:22.000]  I have made clear that we stand ready to complete an exceptional new trade agreement with the UK that will bring tremendous benefits to both of our countries.
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  We are working closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on a magnificent new trade deal.
[25:29.000 --> 25:39.000]  The most important difference in America's new approach on trade concerns our relationship with China.
[25:39.000 --> 25:47.000]  In 2001, China was admitted to the World Trade Organization.
[25:47.000 --> 26:08.000]  Our leaders then argued that this decision would compel China to liberalize its economy and strengthen protections to provide things that were unacceptable to us and for private property and for the rule of law.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  Two decades later, this theory has been tested and proven completely wrong.
[26:13.000 --> 26:32.000]  Not only has China declined to adopt promise reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers,
[26:32.000 --> 26:40.000]  and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  And cultural sabotage funding Hollywood.
[26:42.000 --> 26:53.000]  As just one example, I recently met the CEO of a terrific American company, Micron Technology, at the White House.
[26:53.000 --> 27:15.000]  Micron produces memory chips used in countless electronics. To advance the Chinese government's five-year economic plan, a company owned by the Chinese state allegedly stole Micron's designs, valued at up to $8.7 billion.
[27:15.000 --> 27:29.000]  Soon, the Chinese company obtained patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  But we are seeking justice.
[27:31.000 --> 27:42.000]  The United States lost 60,000 factories after China entered the WTO.
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  This is happening to other countries all over the globe.
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  The World Trade Organization needs drastic change.
[27:52.000 --> 28:04.000]  The second largest economy in the world should not be permitted to declare itself a developing country in order to game the system at others' expense.
[28:04.000 --> 28:13.000]  For years, these abuses were tolerated, ignored, or even encouraged.
[28:13.000 --> 28:23.000]  Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  But as far as America is concerned, those days are over.
[28:28.000 --> 28:54.000]  China owns the majority of Hollywood production now, that's on record, and they're funding all of this race war, sex war, America sucks, garbage, because there's traders in our country quarterbacking it, telling China what to do, and we're going to make them all pay.
[28:58.000 --> 29:07.000]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:07.000 --> 29:15.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:15.000 --> 29:21.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.000 --> 29:32.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.000 --> 29:40.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:40.000 --> 30:02.000]  The final days of September are turning out to be incredible.
[30:02.000 --> 30:09.000]  Trump's speech to the UN was like oxygen to a man who's been held under water, or a big oak glass of ice water in the Sahara Desert.
[30:09.000 --> 30:16.000]  It was amazing, and it shows that we've done our job, you've done your job, to get the word out about who the real enemies of human freedom are, the globalist.
[30:16.000 --> 30:23.000]  Globalism is not our future, and we're going to defeat it together, but now the battle is quickened. They're trying to bankrupt us and shut us down.
[30:23.000 --> 30:29.000]  We've got the best products out there that you absolutely need, and we're selling them at huge discounts, and we've got to sell a lot to fund ourselves.

[30:51.000 --> 30:58.000]  The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.
[30:58.000 --> 31:02.000]  My fellow freedom lovers, I'm very excited to bring you Vaso Beats.
[31:02.000 --> 31:09.000]  I've been wanting a beet formula for years because they're popular, they're best sellers, because people like them and they really work.
[31:09.000 --> 31:16.000]  It's on record that beets are good for healthy liver, helps support athletic performance, supports healthy blood vessels.
[31:16.000 --> 31:24.000]  The list goes on and on. Cardiovascular and heart health supports one of the biggest, what's called Vaso Beats, helps support the body's natural nitric oxide production.
[31:24.000 --> 31:31.000]  Oh, that is the biggie. Well, guess what, ladies and gentlemen, Vaso Beats is a concentrated beet extract.

[31:48.000 --> 31:58.000]  Vaso Beats at InfowarsLife.com and right now we're running a special 50% off on Vaso Beats with free shipping at DoublePatriotPoints.
[32:19.000 --> 32:27.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the Infowars president.
[32:27.000 --> 32:36.000]  And you know what is true? Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world.
[32:36.000 --> 32:42.000]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[32:42.000 --> 32:51.000]  So this is a day of great victory and I salute you all but now I'm the thick of the fight. So InfowarsStore.com for products you need, massive sales now,
[32:51.000 --> 33:18.000]  so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end until we've defeated them.
[33:18.000 --> 33:34.000]  Well you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes and the chauffeur drives your cars, you let everybody know.
[33:34.000 --> 34:00.000]  But don't play with me cause you're playing with fire. Your mother, she's an heiress who owns a block in St. John's Wood and your father'll be there with her if he only could.
[34:00.000 --> 34:08.000]  But don't play with me cause you're playing with fire.
[34:08.000 --> 34:31.000]  You know Trump set the Democrats up right? Now Trump wants the whistleblower to testify before Congress. It'll all be an excuse to bring out Joe Biden publicly saying he committed massive crimes.
[34:31.000 --> 34:47.000]  He transferred partial ownership to a new board of directors with top Democrats sitting on the board and so oh, this whistleblower puts in the complaint.
[34:47.000 --> 35:01.000]  Then the head of national intelligence says that's not a legitimate complaint, nothing wrong was done. The Democrats go crazy. Trump says I'm not going to release it. Please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[35:01.000 --> 35:08.000]  They throw briar rabbit who lives in the briar patch in to the briar patch.
[35:08.000 --> 35:17.000]  This is not level four chess. This is just the ways you set people up that have operatives inside your White House.
[35:17.000 --> 35:39.000]  As Trump said last week, you're also foolish left. Do you think I would ever do anything illegal over the phone? Plus I don't do stuff illegal to begin with. I'm a straight lay guy, straight shooter. That's how you don't go to jail.
[35:39.000 --> 35:51.000]  I always say that you can't con an honest man. Other dishonest people are the ones that fall into all the scams of manipulation. They love it.
[35:51.000 --> 35:58.000]  So now the transcripts released, we're going to go over it. He says I really want you to do us a favor and buy our weapons.
[35:58.000 --> 36:08.000]  Well, there's one thing a U.S. president is supposed to do for the military and social complex. It's that. I mean, that's totally legal.
[36:08.000 --> 36:16.000]  What a president is really supposed to do is defend the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the people from enemies, foreign and domestic, protect the borders and execute the laws faithfully.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  But U.S. presidents tour the world trying to get people to buy our weapons systems.
[36:21.000 --> 36:29.000]  It's the one thing we got left industry wise really. Trump's trying to get it all back. He's done a damn good job selling our weapons.
[36:29.000 --> 36:40.000]  But if you look at the New York Times headlines, it's do us a favor in quotes and then they put right next to it. Investigate Joe Biden son.
[36:40.000 --> 36:56.000]  Think about that. But Joe Biden goes on television on C-SPAN at the Council on Foreign Relations, set up by British intelligence in 1921 to anglify the U.S.
[36:56.000 --> 37:03.000]  That's why the old original talking movies, they speak in British accents, even though they're not British citizens or not from England, because that was seen as elite.
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.000]  And they said, we'll get America to merge with the British Empire.
[37:08.000 --> 37:17.000]  And Winston Churchill wrote three books about it. Winston Churchill's mommy was American.
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  He himself was, could have been heir to the throne. He was British royalty.
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.000]  PR, the average American didn't even know Winston Churchill could have been the king of England. They didn't know he was half American unless you read his book.
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.000]  So I'm not even saying it's a bad thing overall, but it's Cecil Rhodes. It's Winston Churchill who worked for Cecil Rhodes and the later became Prime Minister.
[37:35.000 --> 37:43.000]  I mean, that's what this is.
[37:43.000 --> 37:52.000]  And now when you pull back from this, he's at the Council on Foreign Relations on national television bragging they investigated my son.
[37:52.000 --> 38:01.000]  So I told them, if you don't fire that prosecutor, I'm going to cut a billion dollars out of a aid package.
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.000]  That was half the aid every year to Ukraine. Now think about that.
[38:06.000 --> 38:15.000]  And then they turn it around in the media that Trump said, I'm going to withhold aid if you don't rehire that prosecutor.
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  And all Trump said, as I heard about this, it's a terrible story. Is that true? Can you look into that?
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.000]  Well, he better be doing stuff like that.
[38:25.000 --> 38:31.000]  So again, why are they doing this? Because they're so scared. The indictments are ready for McCabe and others.
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.000]  A few weeks ago, the indictments are there. They went to the number two of the Justice Department.
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  That's the procedure and said, please kill these. And they said, no, that means the indictments are sitting there. That's how it works.
[38:42.000 --> 38:49.000]  And then you heard later, oh, there's other indictments. They're there. That isn't some foggy thing on 4chan.
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.000]  And they've had the grand juries open in DC in Maryland and in Virginia for the last two years.
[38:56.000 --> 39:05.000]  They have two types, the type that indict the informational investigative grand juries. Both are open. That's confirmed.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  So that's why you're seeing this desperate chicken with the head cut off behavior.
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  I mean, look at these headlines. I don't get into the unclassified document.
[39:14.000 --> 39:23.000]  Trump makes it clear he's ready for a fight. He's long anticipated Pelosi launches formal impeachment inquiry.
[39:23.000 --> 39:30.000]  The fourth time in history, it's happened. Only two presidents have been impeached.
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.000]  Meanwhile, the White House wants the person we will testify because it's going to be a giant joke, like Balazi Ford.
[39:36.000 --> 39:44.000]  Now, why don't they just have the whistleblowers say, Trump raped them, have a man say he raped them, but just make up whatever.
[39:44.000 --> 39:52.000]  Oh, and surprise, surprise. Oh, geez, Hillary Clinton favors impeachment proceedings because it's an emergency or something.
[39:52.000 --> 40:01.000]  And it goes on, guess who the whistleblower is? Someone who worked directly for Hillary, Rodham, Clinton.
[40:01.000 --> 40:10.000]  You just can't make that up. Now, here's the key exhibit before I go to the document itself. The transcript.
[40:10.000 --> 40:17.000]  Trump asked Ukraine's leader to, quote, do us a favor. Those are close quotes.
[40:17.000 --> 40:23.000]  And they put it like a word salad game and also urges inquiry of Biden.
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.000]  Do us a favor. And that's what they're saying is he said, I'm going to hold back money.
[40:27.000 --> 40:36.000]  If you don't do it, then you read the actual transcript.
[40:36.000 --> 40:46.000]  And it's no such thing in a 30 plus minute conversation. He talks about Biden for 20 seconds, and we're going to read you from what he said
[40:46.000 --> 40:53.000]  between President Zelensky of Ukraine and President Trump of the United States of America.
[40:53.000 --> 40:59.000]  But you read the New York Times or where else? Oh my gosh, it's a smoking gun.
[40:59.000 --> 41:07.000]  He was saying, we'll hold back money. If you don't do it, we say, meanwhile, it's total perfect projection, total inversion.
[41:07.000 --> 41:16.000]  Here's Biden a year ago on national television. And that's what Trump says. He says, you know, Biden's bragging about this on TV.
[41:16.000 --> 41:24.000]  It's really disturbing. Can you look into this? I mean, if he wasn't doing that, I'd say this guy's got a problem.
[41:24.000 --> 41:31.000]  But instead he's out there like a horse, like a boss doing exactly what he should be doing. Hallelujah.
[41:31.000 --> 41:41.000]  And it's got these crooks scared. Here is Biden. And so I got Ukraine and I remember going over convincing our team or others to
[41:41.000 --> 41:50.000]  convincing us that we should be providing for loan guarantees. And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev.
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion dollar loan guarantee.
[41:55.000 --> 42:05.000]  And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor and they didn't.
[42:05.000 --> 42:11.000]  So they said they had, they were walking out to Prescott. I said, no, I said, I'm not going to, we're not going to give you the billion dollars.
[42:11.000 --> 42:19.000]  They said, you have no authority. You're not the president. The president said, I said, call him. I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars.
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.000]  I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here. And I think it was what, six hours? I look, I said, we've been six hours.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[42:28.000 --> 42:38.000]  So we don't know who the enemy is. It's those sycophantic people like Richard in Haas and the other sitting up there preening all kissing each other's ass while they preside over the gang rape of America.
[42:38.000 --> 42:45.000]  And now they've gang raped us. Now they're putting cigarettes out on us. Now they're going to slit our throat and throw us out into a garbage pile.
[42:45.000 --> 42:57.000]  Well, guess what? It ain't going to happen. You little dirty pimps. We're going to remove you and your Chycom masters. You got it, Jack? We are kicking your ass.

[44:58.000 --> 45:05.000]  Where I stand, the world is heard from presidents, premiers, rebels, and heroes who embolden us.
[45:05.000 --> 45:15.000]  Tuesday, the 24th of September, 2019, is a historical date. President Trump threw down the gauntlet and said globalism is not the future of the planet.
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.000]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  And then Trump went after them on how the Chai cons are sealing their intellectual property.
[45:22.000 --> 45:32.000]  Dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, forced technology transfers, and the theft of intellectual property.
[45:32.000 --> 45:39.000]  It was simply amazing. And then he talked about the ruling leftist elite and their censorship and how it must be met head-on.
[45:39.000 --> 45:46.000]  My administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech.
[45:46.000 --> 45:55.000]  This is amazing. Find highlights and Trump's entire historic speech at infowars.com and band.video.
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  And God bless America. Thank you very much.
[45:58.000 --> 46:09.000]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years. It's been a bestseller.
[46:14.000 --> 46:26.000]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented SilverSol technology in it.
[46:26.000 --> 46:36.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid. It's got the steric acid. It's got the grapefruit essential oil. It's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.000]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere. You're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  And it funds the InfoWare at infowarslife.com.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  Get your super silver skin cream today.
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.000]  We can only run this special for another week or so as of taping this September 10th.
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.000]  We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[47:32.000 --> 47:53.000]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender.
[47:53.000 --> 48:02.000]  We have the Providence. Okay, this is again probably one of the most loaded jam-packed transmissions ever. You can feel the energy increasing across the planet.
[48:02.000 --> 48:09.000]  Good and evil are contending or supremacy as we launch into the future.
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.000]  I should have covered this in detail yesterday. I did cover it some.
[48:14.000 --> 48:21.000]  Drudreport.com had it up as their top right hand link. It just got taken down as I was about to cover it.
[48:21.000 --> 48:27.000]  Professor Warren's social credit to shift law from constitution to analytics and algorithm.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  That is a Daniel Taylor Olfinger News.com story that we reposted.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  It's so important.
[48:35.000 --> 48:42.000]  And Robert Barnes constitutional lawyer will be here in the next hour to go over this sum with us and why this is so important.
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  Because this is what Facebook admits they're doing.
[48:45.000 --> 48:51.000]  Corporate global social score and corporate governance. So dangerous. And they're going to be over banking everything.
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  The big four tech companies. This is the plan.
[48:54.000 --> 49:00.000]  And that dovetails with this shocking article that went up last night.
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  That I've talked about 15 years ago because I talked to engineers.
[49:04.000 --> 49:22.000]  Remember Captain Crunch, the first hacker he's known as he's been on the show. He learned how to whistle into a telephone and take control of the phone company and even call, you know, get Richard Nixon on the phone.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  Now, you ever hear.
[49:25.000 --> 49:31.000]  And all of a sudden your cable system flips over and says an emergency alert from the president or weather or whatever.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  Those are tones. Those are computers talking.
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  Now, this has been a fact since they came out with radio.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  And it went commercial by the 30s. They had tones.
[49:44.000 --> 49:50.000]  And then it went into telephones later before that it was switchboards people.
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.000]  We should do a whole piece on this. The secret language of machines in your house.
[49:55.000 --> 50:05.000]  They're whistling. They're talking. Why do you think R2-D2 goes like, oh, that's stupid. Those old movies.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  No, that's what they do.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  That's people going to engineers and saying, how would a robot talk?
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.000]  Well, they talk in burst and bleeps.
[50:16.000 --> 50:25.000]  Tones aren't really audible in radio anymore. But remember, you used to listen to talk radio when it went to break sometimes. You'd hear a bleep.
[50:25.000 --> 50:31.000]  That's tones in your house from all the smart TVs for years.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  They're communicating with everything else in your house.
[50:34.000 --> 50:42.000]  Even when your TV's not plugged into the Internet, because your phone's activating it back and forth and they're all talking with subaudible tones.
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.000]  Now your dog can hear it, cause the reason your dog's climbing underneath.
[50:47.000 --> 50:53.000]  I mean, can you imagine animals and whales and what this is like, having to listen to all this?
[50:53.000 --> 51:03.000]  I mean, it basically, if you could hear it, it's like this.
[51:03.000 --> 51:09.000]  And they're all reporting on you. And it says that in the articles. We're linking to Mainstream News now telling you about it.
[51:09.000 --> 51:12.600]  light bulbs. Why do you think Obama said there's one type of light bulb you've got to use?
[51:14.600 --> 51:20.040]  And the globally standardizer or the UN, that type of light bulb. It was in mainstream news in
[51:20.040 --> 51:27.400]  engineering magazines 10 years ago, 11 years ago, that those can communicate with light flickers
[51:29.800 --> 51:37.000]  with chips embedded inside devices. And they can have a little hole in the front of the device,
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.280]  and that light goes through it and then activates it and gives it orders.
[51:41.720 --> 51:47.480]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we're not in Kansas anymore. There's articles about the IRS is using
[51:47.480 --> 51:52.440]  AI now to track your emotions of what you're up to. I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[51:52.440 --> 51:59.720]  IRS testing behavioral analytics to verify online users. Oh, my God. I mean, this is just out of
[51:59.720 --> 52:09.000]  control. So imagine if you're in your house and your Alexa and your Google Nest or your ring that's
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.640]  got hidden mics in it. So you turn the mic off, it's still on. If you could hear those communicating
[52:13.640 --> 52:20.760]  with each other, again, it would sound like a fireworks display or something. Bing, bong,
[52:20.760 --> 52:24.920]  bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. I mean, that's what's going on. And it's all on
[52:24.920 --> 52:31.080]  m4wars.com if you care. And again, they know who you are. The machines are programmed when a
[52:31.080 --> 52:35.880]  certain phone comes around that the phone then communicates with it and goes back and forth
[52:35.880 --> 52:40.200]  with all these tones. And then there's bounties on you. That's what came out last week that Netflix
[52:42.920 --> 52:48.440]  contacts all the smart TVs, even if you don't have Netflix, your TV's reporting everything you do
[52:48.440 --> 52:53.880]  back to Netflix. And then it reports it all to Google and Apple because they're all setting up
[52:53.880 --> 52:59.000]  a grid. It was all done on purpose for everything you do from paying your taxes to getting a movie
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.360]  ticket to buying condoms to buying liquor to going to the doctor. Everything is tracked. And
[53:04.360 --> 53:09.160]  then if you don't play ball, they turn it off, which they now admits the plan. How the hell would
[53:09.160 --> 53:15.240]  we allow such a nightmare grid to be built around us? Now, I had a clip I was going to get to at
[53:15.240 --> 53:21.160]  Juliani laying all this out last week, how Biden did it all. And I mean, we were the ones three
[53:21.160 --> 53:25.880]  years ago and two years ago harping on Biden and Obama and Hillary and the sellout of the Ukrainian
[53:25.880 --> 53:30.280]  infrastructure. And that's one reason Roger Stone got indicted was because he was laying out the
[53:30.280 --> 53:36.200]  groundwork here. And so we're going to get to that clip. Barnes is here. I followed suit on the
[53:36.200 --> 53:42.520]  Young Turks today. You see the laws that are in FullWars.com. We have the classified document we're
[53:42.520 --> 53:46.760]  going to read over with Barnes first. There is so much. I've got more of Trump's speech. I mean,
[53:46.760 --> 53:50.280]  the quickening's here. And I keep saying every day, the quickening's more intense. The quickening's
[53:50.280 --> 53:54.040]  more intense. The quickening's more intense. And then I don't start the show every day just to say
[53:54.040 --> 54:04.280]  that it's going to get crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier. But remember, there's not
[54:04.280 --> 54:09.880]  just evil in the universe. So as scary as this gets, rolling over to these people only encourages
[54:09.880 --> 54:16.840]  them. And I'm going to say this right now. A lot of people have not supported Trump or have backed
[54:16.840 --> 54:23.720]  off supporting him because you get audited, you get death-threaded, you get harassed. The left
[54:23.720 --> 54:28.680]  then comes after you at the grassroots. And if you're in a humongous association, they will change
[54:28.680 --> 54:33.080]  the rules where you can't even park cars in your own driveway and only enforce it on you. That's
[54:33.080 --> 54:40.520]  happening to me. They will harass your children. They will spit on you in stores. They will throw
[54:40.520 --> 54:46.280]  ICT in your face or hot coffee in your face. They will say they want to kill you through your face.
[54:48.600 --> 54:55.080]  They will shoot you. They will break your ribs by Congressman Scalise and Senator Paul. So you need
[54:55.080 --> 55:01.480]  to understand, folks, that I'm prominent in this and I'm not even the most prominent in the revolution
[55:01.480 --> 55:05.720]  to take back America. And it's been very interesting. Now, I'm the type of person that can be totally
[55:05.720 --> 55:10.760]  exhausted and somebody messes with me or death threats me and I suddenly get five hours of
[55:10.760 --> 55:17.720]  pure energy. I'm not a defeatist. I'm not a masochist. I'm not a sato masochist. I don't enjoy fights,
[55:18.280 --> 55:25.320]  but you come and punch me in the nose. I turn into the energizer bunny that will tear your nose off.
[55:27.400 --> 55:31.800]  So this doesn't affect me other than making me just get more aggressive and more focused.
[55:31.800 --> 55:37.160]  A lot of people just get overwhelmed by it and blown away by the corruption and just tap out.
[55:37.880 --> 55:45.400]  So this is a battle of wills, folks. And people are waiting for Trump to go on the
[55:45.400 --> 55:50.360]  offense and he's going to get even more support. But I think he's waiting till it builds and it crests
[55:51.160 --> 55:55.720]  like popping a pimple until he really lets the globalist have it. And they know that now.
[55:55.720 --> 55:59.800]  The indictments are there. It's coming. And all hell is about to break loose. It's already breaking
[55:59.800 --> 56:03.160]  loose. But I'm going to tell you right now, the Pentagon put out an official report on Stars and
[56:03.160 --> 56:07.720]  Stripes that Antifa is going to go shoot up movie theaters and blame it on conservatives.
[56:08.280 --> 56:12.680]  The Joker is designed to do it. The Pentagon knows what propaganda is. This is chai-com
[56:12.680 --> 56:17.320]  revolution starting crap. I did a report on it last week. The Pentagon has officially come out and
[56:17.320 --> 56:23.160]  said that. So the Pentagon's not perfect. The Pentagon didn't know what was going on 10 years ago.
[56:23.160 --> 56:27.320]  It knows what's going on now. And it's decided, hey, we're not going to sell out America and piss
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.720]  all over our forebears and sign over to the chai-coms for no reason. Just from an even selfish
[56:31.720 --> 56:37.400]  position. Why would you force it? All the power we've got in our history. Just so globalist leftists
[56:37.400 --> 56:43.400]  can piss all over us. And, you know, like a dog wiping its ass on the carpet. Drag their butts
[56:43.400 --> 56:49.640]  over our faces. I mean, I'm sorry, but that's what this is. It's a giant chicken crap exercise of
[56:49.640 --> 56:53.400]  chicken-neck nobodies that if they could mount America's head on the wall, they'd finally be
[56:53.400 --> 56:58.040]  somebody. Now, listen, speaking of funding operations, ladies and gentlemen, we're under
[56:58.040 --> 57:01.480]  massive attack. You know it. We've done a lot of innovation under attack. We put everything we've
[57:01.480 --> 57:06.040]  got into giving the globalists a full push into 2020, but I need funding. Plus, I make it easy.

[59:14.440 --> 59:21.720]  And you know what is true? Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew, and my drive
[59:21.720 --> 59:25.960]  and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the
[59:25.960 --> 59:30.600]  world. And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their
[59:30.600 --> 59:36.040]  unelected anti-human tyrannies. So this is a day of great victory. And I salute you all, but now
[59:36.040 --> 59:41.400]  we're in the thick of the fight. So, InfowarsStore.com for products you need, massive sales now,
[59:41.400 --> 59:45.240]  so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight
[59:45.240 --> 59:47.640]  right until the end until we've defeated them.
[59:51.960 --> 59:54.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:54.600 --> 1:00:05.720]  I'm on the edge of my seat.
[1:00:05.720 --> 1:00:15.800]  I'm on the edge of my seat. Constitutional lawyer, criminal lawyer, first women lawyer,
[1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:21.880]  Robert Barnes is with us in studio next hour. Then he's going to host the fourth hour.
[1:00:21.880 --> 1:00:26.920]  We followed suit on the young Turks and others today. It's very important that we all go on
[1:00:26.920 --> 1:00:30.600]  the offense and we had to do it, but it's got to kind of take a little bit of a
[1:00:30.600 --> 1:00:33.960]  backseat to the attempted impeachment, that epic speech. I mean,
[1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:36.280]  this is the real fight for the heart and soul of America.
[1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:40.280]  People are so used to corruption, they think, well, we couldn't have an establishment fighting
[1:00:40.280 --> 1:00:45.000]  another establishment. Actually, even if the other establishment fighting the globalist isn't
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:50.120]  perfect, again, why should it get rid of something rich, powerful, amazing with a cool history
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:54.600]  and just bow to the globalist and bow to the chai comps? It's not going to happen.
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:59.640]  So the fight's on, but if they're able to impeach Trump or they're able to remove him,
[1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:02.920]  the stock market's going to crash. It's going to be insane. We're going to look at it all,
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:08.440]  this huge hoax that they put out that Trump said, I'll hold money back if you don't rehire
[1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:13.000]  this prosecutor. That's a total inversion of what Biden did. We're going to play that again.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.640]  We're going to go over this declassified document. I mean,
[1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:21.400]  I've been on air 25 years and I've never seen anything like this. Just I don't know how everyone
[1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:25.960]  isn't on the edge of their seat. This is like sudden death over time, NFL games every second,
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:31.160]  but it's for all the marbles in the real world. It's epic, epic, epic. And the president calls
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:35.720]  out socialism and communism and calls out big tech censorship. That's next segment. We'll play
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:40.520]  a clip of that. But first, let's go to him calling out the nightmare evil of socialism and communism
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:47.400]  to the people's face in the UN. One of the most serious challenges our countries face
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:55.640]  is the specter of socialism. It's the record of nations and destroyer of societies.
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:03.960]  Events in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice.
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:09.480]  They are not about equality. They are not about lifting up the poor,
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:14.840]  and they are certainly not about good of the nation.
[1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:22.920]  Socialism and communism are about one thing only, power for the ruling class.
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:31.160]  Today, I repeat a message for the world that I have delivered at home. America will never
[1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:40.360]  be a socialist country. In the last century, socialism and communism killed 100 million people.
[1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:51.880]  Sadly, as we see in Venezuela, the death toll continues in this country. These totalitarian
[1:02:51.880 --> 1:03:03.400]  ideologies combined with modern technology have the power to excise new and disturbing forms of
[1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:12.200]  suppression and domination. We want every nation in our region to flourish and its people to thrive
[1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:20.200]  in freedom and peace. In that mission, we are also committed to supporting those people
[1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:28.280]  in the Western Hemisphere who live under brutal oppression, such as those in Cuba,
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:35.960]  Nicaragua, and Venezuela. According to a recent report from the UN Human Rights Council,
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:44.200]  women in Venezuela stand in line for 10 hours a day waiting for food. Over 15,000 people have been
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:51.800]  detained as political prisoners. Modern-day death squads are carrying out thousands of
[1:03:52.760 --> 1:04:02.520]  extrajudicial killings. The dictator Maduro is a Cuban puppet protected by Cuban bodyguards,
[1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:11.560]  hiding from his own people while Cuba plunders Venezuela's oil wealth to sustain its own corrupt
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:19.640]  communist rule. Since I last spoke in this hall, the United States and our partners have built a
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:26.760]  historic coalition of 55 countries that recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela. To the
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:33.560]  Venezuelans trapped in this nightmare, please know that all of America is united behind you.
[1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:40.840]  The United States has vast quantities of humanitarian aid ready and waiting to be delivered.
[1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:49.480]  We're watching the Venezuela situation very closely. We await the day when democracy will
[1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:55.720]  be restored, when Venezuela will be free, and when liberty will...
[1:04:56.440 --> 1:05:01.800]  The final days of September are turning out to be incredible. Prompt speech to the UN was
[1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:06.360]  like oxygen to a man who's been held under water or a big old glass of ice water in the Sahara
[1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:10.840]  Desert. It was amazing and it shows that we've done our job, you've done your job, to get the
[1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:15.160]  word out about who the real enemies of human freedom are, the globalist. Globalism is not our
[1:05:15.160 --> 1:05:19.000]  future and we're going to defeat it together, but now the battle has quickened. They're trying to
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:23.560]  bankrupt us and shut us down. We've got the best products out there that you absolutely need
[1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:27.320]  and we're selling them at huge discounts. We've got to sell a lot to fund ourselves. So we've got

[1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:44.760]  for a pro-human future at Infowarsstore.com. Black Friday comes two months early for the next week

[1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:57.880]  The future belongs to patriots.
[1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:11.880]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:24.920]  Freedom and democracy must be constantly guarded and protected both abroad and from within.
[1:06:26.120 --> 1:06:33.320]  We must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control. Even in free nations,
[1:06:33.320 --> 1:06:40.920]  we see alarming signs and new challenges to liberty. A small number of social media platforms
[1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:50.760]  are requiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say.
[1:06:52.280 --> 1:07:00.840]  A permanent political class is openly disdainful, dismissive and defiant of the will of the people.
[1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:08.520]  A faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule.
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:17.240]  Media and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions and values.
[1:07:19.240 --> 1:07:25.320]  In the United States, my administration has made clear to social media companies
[1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:35.160]  that we will uphold the right of free speech. A free society cannot allow social media giants
[1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:42.760]  to silence the voices of the people. And a free people must never, ever be enlisted
[1:07:42.760 --> 1:08:04.600]  in the cause of silencing, coercing, cancelling or blacklisting their own neighbors.
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:10.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:17.160]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:24.200]  FreeAmericanLawCenter.com, that's the new site launched to counter the Southern
[1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:31.880]  Primary Law Center and the basically defunct ACLU that doesn't defend the First Amendment anymore.
[1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:35.640]  That's even in the NPR article today that the First Amendment is basically dead in America,
[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:39.160]  if it's not defended well. The last of the ones wanting to get rid of the First Amendment,
[1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:42.840]  now you're wondering why you're losing all these lawsuits and why you're going down the
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:47.160]  tubes. Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer is here with us in studio. He'll be hosting the
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:51.720]  fourth hour as well. Mike Adams is coming up in the third hour loaded for bearer. I am your
[1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:56.200]  main host, Alex Jones, right here in the Info War, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas,
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:04.360]  Austin, broadcasting worldwide. Now, we have a very full plate today. I filed suit on the young
[1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:09.480]  Turks for their vicious attempt to destroy our operation and silence our free speech,
[1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:14.600]  which they stated was their reason. We've been forced to do this. You can read the suit at
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:20.760]  InfoWars.com. Alex Jones fights back, sues young Turks for libel. We're not going to cover that
[1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:27.480]  until the bottom of the hour because it's important. We're fighting back. The state attorney general
[1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:31.560]  is working with Trump and the new attorney general are moving forward, but they're the heavy tanks
[1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:37.320]  going in. We're the infantry behind the tanks. And so we're going to be laying all this out,
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:41.640]  and the larger strategy is to return the First Amendment. You just heard the president at the
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:47.160]  UN world stage bring this up. So we're going to get to that at the bottom of the hour. What's
[1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:55.560]  happening with Trump, Big Tech, Zuckerberg, visiting DC last week, and so much more with
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:10:01.240]  constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes. But first, it is on record that it is Hillary Clinton's
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:08.200]  lawyer, again, that is one of the, quote, whistleblowers, where they claimed that they heard
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:13.800]  him. That's President Trump say, I'll take money away from Ukraine. If you don't hire a prosecutor
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:20.520]  back that was investigating Joe Biden's son who took over a giant gas company. Now it turns out,
[1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:27.160]  as usual, it is a total inversion of reality. Here's the New York Times. Trump asked Ukraine
[1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:32.840]  leader to, quote, do us a favor. That was buying US arms, which is what presidents do. It's legal
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:38.920]  and lawful and also urges inquiry of Biden, but it's two separate things. He should be bringing
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:45.240]  this up. He should be doing this because Biden went on television a year ago and set on the CFR
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:50.920]  on C-SPAN. That's the shadow government. It's a public meeting place. They brag about it. The one
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:55.640]  setting up the Chinese century, selling us out. It's type in council on farm relations, Chinese
[1:10:55.640 --> 1:11:03.720]  century. They cheerlead for China. There they are saying, oh, they're going after my son. So I
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:07.400]  threatened the prosecutor and I said, if you don't fire him, I'll cut a billion dollars and they
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:12.760]  fired him. Now that's exactly what they're saying. Trump was threatening to do, but Biden actually
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:18.520]  did it and bragged publicly. So as a smoke screen, this whole impeachment thing is desperate
[1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:23.720]  because this goes to Hillary, who was quarterbacking the whole deal. You also have the former FBI
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:30.760]  director involved, Robert Mueller. So that's why they put all this on Trump because the indictments
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:34.840]  are sealed. The Justice Department said they're going ahead with them. And that's why you're
[1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:40.200]  seeing this total chicken with a head cut off panic. Now, that said, this is all baseless.
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:44.680]  It's the fourth time impeachment proceedings have been opened. Presidents have only been impeached
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:49.400]  twice, but it's the fourth time they've been opened. They have been opened and they could
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:53.160]  pull out full flags. They're trying to crash the economy. They can try to start wars.
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:58.840]  This is an insane time. And there's now, as Drudge Report reports, Republican cracks emerge.
[1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:04.040]  You've got a bunch of blackmailed and scared Republicans who are ready to go after President
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:08.120]  Trump, even though he unclassified from the government that was recording the president
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:12.120]  talking to a foreign president. The transcript, and that's exactly what the president said in a
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:17.480]  30 plus minute conversation, barely even talked about it, said he was amazed by this statement
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:22.760]  that Joe Biden made on national television. Here is the Joe Biden statement. And so I got Ukraine.
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:30.440]  And I remember going over convincing our team or others to convince him that we should be providing
[1:12:30.440 --> 1:12:38.760]  for loan guarantees. And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev. And I was supposed
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:44.680]  to announce that there was another billion dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from
[1:12:44.680 --> 1:12:51.080]  Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against a state prosecutor, and they
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:54.920]  didn't. So they said they had, they were walking out to the press conference and said, no, I said,
[1:12:54.920 --> 1:13:00.120]  I'm not going to, we're not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority.
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:04.760]  You're not the president. The president said, I said, call him. I said, I'm telling you,
[1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:08.440]  you're not getting a billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be
[1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:12.280]  leaving here. And I think it was what, six hours? I looked, I said, leaving six hours.
[1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:14.840]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:22.040]  Robert Barnes, this is terrorism going on with these fake whistleblowers, these fake rape victims,
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:26.680]  all of this. And it's just stunt after stunt. It's built into a crescendo. How would you define
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:30.840]  this period of timeline? Well, you look at something that's an actual smoking gun. And as
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:34.120]  they said, the transcript was going to be a smoking gun. The actual smoking gun is there,
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:39.160]  Joe Biden, saying, if you don't fire the prosecutor, you don't get the billion dollars from the US
[1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:43.800]  government. A prosecutor who was involved in potentially investigating his son. And that's
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:48.840]  quid pro right in front of you. I mean, from a criminal case perspective, if I was defending Joe
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:53.800]  Biden, that would be a almost an impossible thing to overcome. That's a definition of it.
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:57.720]  That's like the guy on tape saying, please kill my ex-wife, right? I mean, you're like, well,
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:00.920]  I'll give you a $10,000. Yeah, we're really, he was upset at the moment. I mean, you know,
[1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:04.280]  I was like, here's the cash, here's where she lives. Here's how you do it. And he knows he's
[1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:08.840]  on video saying it. I mean, he said, they're saying right here, if you don't give me, if you
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:13.160]  don't fire the prosecutor who's investigating my son, who could expose my son's corruption,
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:18.600]  then what we're going to do is not give you a billion, a billion dollars of US taxpayer money.
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:22.040]  That's what they claimed was in this transcript, which doesn't exist in this transcript.
[1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:26.760]  President Zelensky, he was actually a comedian in Ukraine before he got elected.
[1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:30.760]  He's the one who instigates the entire conversation. He says, we have problems with
[1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:35.800]  corruption in Ukraine. We need to drain the swamp in Ukraine. We want Rudy Giuliani to come over
[1:14:35.800 --> 1:14:40.520]  here because we want to get into these issues. And all Trump says is, okay, sure. In response to
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:46.120]  the questions by Zelensky, he says, hey, yes, we'll support it. This does seem weird. That's it.
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:49.880]  There was no quid pro quo. Trump didn't even initiate or instigate the conversation at all.
[1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:53.320]  There was no talking about Biden eight different times. And Trump said this last week.
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:58.760]  So this is all just a smokescreen to cover up that Hillary's involved, right?
[1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:02.520]  Oh, no. What they're doing is they're saying, look at this horrible offensive action,
[1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:05.720]  just like the Clinton emails, just like what they did with WikiLeaks. They're saying,
[1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:09.720]  how dare you expose Democratic corruption? That it should be an impeachable offense
[1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:13.960]  for you to expose the Democratic gravy train that has enriched the Biden.
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:17.400]  And Governor Weld is saying, kill Trump. He says, execute it for this.
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:22.120]  Oh, yeah. Oh, exactly. Which is insane. I mean, just imagine if this had been said against Obama.
[1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:24.440]  I mean, if anybody had said anything like that, they would have been target.
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:28.200]  But if you look at the escalation, it's going to go into physical civil war by them
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:31.640]  any, any month down. I mean, it's a deep level of projection. In other words,
[1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:35.800]  they keep seeing, they keep blaming others for what they themselves have done. Ukraine has
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:40.040]  been a centerpiece of Democratic political corruption going on a better part of a decade.
[1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:44.040]  They do not want it to be exposed because it exposes all the dirty secrets that Clinton
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:48.040]  found. So what we're seeing is a total panic right now. Absolutely. Because they cannot afford
[1:15:48.040 --> 1:15:51.560]  this investigation to move forward. This is history. It's happening. Spread the live links

[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:05.480]  warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:11.400]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting. I was the first to
[1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:16.600]  begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be
[1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:22.760]  harvested. I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson and Infowars.com 15 years ago that
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:28.600]  Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do at hundreds and hundreds
[1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:34.920]  of other giant issues like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control
[1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:39.320]  our economy that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese
[1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:44.760]  on every one of these issues and many others. We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:49.640]  the planetary scale. That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:58.440]  are more critical than ever to support the Infowar. Please support the Infowar however you can.
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:26.920]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Shroyer or Paul
[1:19:26.920 --> 1:19:32.840]  Watson band videos. We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted and

[1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:45.240]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum
[1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:52.520]  and the globalist. Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video. America and the world is

[1:19:55.640 --> 1:20:12.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:22.040]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[1:20:22.040 --> 1:20:27.880]  You're listening to Alex Jones. All right constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is here
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:32.280]  with us. I have filed suit today on the Young Turks and others will tell you about that.
[1:20:32.280 --> 1:20:36.840]  Next segment is part of the as above so below operation to fight back against these tyrants.
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:41.400]  We've been forced to do it. Read the suit and more at infowars.com and newswars.com and the
[1:20:41.400 --> 1:20:45.560]  news site band.video that is exploding thanks to you spreading the word so keep it up. The site's
[1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:49.960]  getting better every day. More is getting added. More sections, the live feeds, special events and
[1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:55.960]  so much more band.video. Robert Barnes will be hosting the fourth hour to get more into this but
[1:20:57.320 --> 1:21:00.360]  I can sit back and see the left and so much trouble and so desperate
[1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:07.000]  that they won control of the house and they may have the boats to get the indictment in the house.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:11.640]  That's where they again would get the indictment for impeachment and that's when you're impeached and
[1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:16.760]  then the Senate votes on whether to remove you or not. Bill Clinton got impeached in the house
[1:21:16.760 --> 1:21:24.280]  in the mid 90s late 90s but it did not get passed in the Senate. It got dropped so
[1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:30.360]  that is the point that we're basically at here that Pelosi's trying to get us to
[1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:34.520]  and you can say oh well they're a bunch of idiots this all blew up in their face he did nothing wrong
[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:39.880]  they don't care they're all with the news saying proof he offered money it's over it's in the transcript
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:47.240]  Judge Andrew DePaulitano who has turned on Trump you know like rotten milk or something
[1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:52.840]  says oh proof of a crime I mean Fox News I know is putting pressure on people for what they say and do
[1:21:53.640 --> 1:21:56.920]  if they want to keep their jobs I've talked to some horrible folks that refuse to do it
[1:21:56.920 --> 1:22:02.520]  and are being threatened to be let go so they've got a lot of a lot of courage but Robert Barnes
[1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:08.840]  again his drugs reports Republican cracks are emerging this is this is completely empty this
[1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:13.800]  is a red herring this is a canard but they're so whipped up and so crazy I don't think we
[1:22:13.800 --> 1:22:17.960]  should be too confident about this. Well there's no doubt this is deep state sabotage on a continuous
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:22.360]  basis in alignment with the Democratic Party because here you have what should have been a
[1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:27.720]  private confidential conversation concerning the president of the United States and a president
[1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:33.240]  of a foreign nation that's in a politically sensitive region in Europe between Europe and Russia
[1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:37.800]  and here you have someone effectively forcing the disclosure of this transcript of this
[1:22:37.800 --> 1:22:45.000]  conversation because of their illicit leaks and politically motivated quote-unquote whistleblower
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:50.760]  activity this isn't whistleblower activity this is illegal and illicit leaks of confidential
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:55.800]  communications that should have remained classified and secret and what they were really trying to
[1:22:55.800 --> 1:23:01.400]  do was to force out into the open force out into the public the degree to which the Ukrainian
[1:23:01.400 --> 1:23:06.440]  administration under this newly elected president who promised to clean up a notoriously corrupt
[1:23:06.440 --> 1:23:11.480]  region a country that has been torn between billionaire oligarchs on both sides of the
[1:23:11.480 --> 1:23:17.640]  political aisle who've simply used their political power to enrich themselves repeatedly and routinely
[1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:23.080]  over the past two decades you watch documentaries like Ukraine on fire and others and see it from
[1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:27.560]  a range of perspectives from both the left and the right that exposes the degree to which
[1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:34.280]  even the Obama administration in particular was in bed with actual Nazis neo-nazis with a long
[1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:39.880]  history of Nazi alignment Nazi history Nazi heritage that they promoted and propagated
[1:23:39.880 --> 1:23:44.680]  involved in xenophobic and anti-semitic violence that's what the Obama administration was in bed
[1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:51.000]  with and by the way we exposed that that a bunch of the same groups funding uh some of the leftist
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:56.680]  groups in Charlottesville a few years ago were the same NGOs funding the Nazis in Ukraine and
[1:23:56.680 --> 1:24:05.000]  actually how Hitler they do the Hitler salute they sued us saying we're saying that uh something
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:11.080]  completely different than than than what we really said it's just insane yeah and what you have is
[1:24:11.080 --> 1:24:17.080]  the state department was in was in embedded with and involved with and invested with and connected
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:22.200]  to and participating with and to some degree conspiring with actual neo-nazi parties in Ukraine
[1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:28.120]  that have a real neo-nazi history Nazi support Nazi legacy and what this deal is that the fear in
[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:33.400]  the paranoia by the deep state and the democratic party political establishment is Ukraine opens the
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:37.960]  door to the extensive depth of corruption and collusion and let me throw this in because what
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:43.080]  you're saying is so central so i i was pointing out and least ran him was pointing out what was in
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:48.040]  the news that they were using Ukraine to send money in the state department Hillary and Obama
[1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:51.960]  to send it back for political operations here in the US and sending money over to try to
[1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:55.880]  topple uh Putin and then sending money back here to the US which they admit they did it's
[1:24:55.880 --> 1:25:00.920]  illegal it's money laundering so we pointed out but the state department was funding Nazis out in
[1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:06.680]  california uh was funding the leftist in Charlottesville and was funding the same Nazis uh a group
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.560]  somewhere in Ukraine and then they spun it and said oh you're saying some guy that had worked
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:17.400]  for Hillary that was a photographer you're saying he did it we're not saying he did that we're saying
[1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:22.280]  that that that the same state department group did which they did but that's how they changed the
[1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:27.160]  subject oh yeah they shift the narrative and here they had to because what would happen with Ukraine
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:32.120]  was substantially problematic from a democratic political party establishment perspective if a
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:36.040]  meaningful investigation is done remember the president what happened is a recent election
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:40.280]  happened in Ukraine for the first time where nobody connected to any of the corrupt political
[1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:45.160]  establishment not not a billionaire candidate won the presidential election Ukraine and they'd
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:51.240]  been using the Ukraine ongoing civil war for years to again wander money out of oh exactly to
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:56.840]  enrich themselves to threaten Russia to threaten Europe as a political tool as a ploy as a technique
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:01.800]  staging and that came out in the in the NSA transcripts well where Obama's ambassador saying
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:06.600]  F the EU F Russia let's create a crisis exactly and so the reason why Zelensky is calling the
[1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:11.480]  president is Zelensky wants the new president of Ukraine wants to clean up Ukraine and finish
[1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:15.160]  this and for and that's the conversation hey we've got our swamp will you help us
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:19.960]  Trump's like yeah sure we'll try yeah wow do you see Biden on TV saying I you know I got the
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:23.560]  prosecutor fired or I threatened a billion bucks I mean that's a normal conversation what happens
[1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:27.480]  is you have some deep state hacks listening or reviewing this transcript or listening in on the
[1:26:27.480 --> 1:26:33.320]  call and saying oh my goodness this could endanger the president at a core and key level
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:37.800]  because if the president really goes after us and exposes the degree to which the deep state
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:43.080]  and democratic political establishment have colluded and conspired with corruption in Ukraine
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:48.760]  to do horrific things like being in bed with you with the neo-nazis like enriching family members
[1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:53.720]  like politically patronizing the Clinton Foundation like being behind the Christopher
[1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:58.520]  Steel activities the fusion GPS spy gate incorporated all of that a lot of that was
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:03.880]  laundered through Ukraine Ukrainian sources Ukrainian money Ukrainian political officials
[1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:07.640]  they were in a meeting with the DNC they were meeting with the state department they're meeting
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:11.720]  with the justice department all of this has come out in different forms if you dig deep
[1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:17.640]  Ukraine is the perfect template the perfect teapot of corruption and collusion that exposes both the
[1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:21.400]  deep state and the democratic party political establishments and that's why they're so terrified
[1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:27.800]  of it and that's just like lbj was only worth like ten million dollars if you look it up maybe even
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:32.520]  less than eight million dollars I've read books about it before he became president but as soon
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:37.000]  as he did he became basically a billionaire in his family that was back in 1960s numbers
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:42.520]  because he got part of the brown and rude and part of the halibut and all the money dredging
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:48.200]  the harbors you know the the whole war that was hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:52.760]  he ended up getting almost a billion dollars off of that so again they use these war zones as
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:59.160]  honeypots for themselves specifically oh absolutely and and Ukraine is a perfect place to launder money
[1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:04.440]  launder political intelligence launder political power help uh do the template for staging false
[1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:08.440]  flag events there's still controversy over what happened what's called the maiden affair and there's
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:13.480]  just a lot of hot chicks everywhere yeah well there's that too but the uh it has it has been used
[1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:18.600]  forever as a sort of balancing power between Russia and Europe the us used it and used its
[1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:23.240]  corruption its collusion questions about the legitimacy of the quote unquote orange revolution
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:29.240]  dating back to the early 2000s this has been Soros's playground it has been continually uh because it's
[1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:33.640]  a way to leverage power against Russia a way to leverage power against Europe so they have a clean
[1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:37.800]  president who wants to end corruption he asked president trump for help and president trump says
[1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:41.880]  yes the democrats in the deep state got terrified and they turned that into the most corrupt thing
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:47.000]  ever it's almost as evil as you know jesus healing the blind or whatever we'll be right back on the
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:50.600]  other side to get more into this and how the left is going to strike back next that incredible
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:54.360]  un speech and so much more with robert barnes on alex jones band.video
[1:28:55.720 --> 1:29:00.280]  hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting the irs over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's

[1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:21.480]  important as isenhower's military industrial complex beware of their tyranny speech where he
[1:32:21.480 --> 1:32:27.960]  talked about technological elite he came out and he exposed how big tech is a new ruling class
[1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:33.480]  that is manipulating the minds of the people and engaging in massive oppression and he talked about
[1:32:33.480 --> 1:32:40.360]  how globalism is not the future of the world and trump has done a great job exposing the u
[1:32:40.360 --> 1:32:46.600]  n the globalists and the chai cons in their house that the rockefeller set up in new york the u n
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:58.840]  this was incredible the future does not belong to globalists the future belongs to patriots
[1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:18.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:33:35.400 --> 1:33:40.360]  for my family or good friend of mine now robert barnes he can get on any subject and he knows
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:45.320]  all about it because i've studied all this stuff and i don't want somebody's bs-ing and he's got a
[1:33:45.320 --> 1:33:51.240]  better memory than i do of course he's 45 i'm a couple months older than him i'm robert barnes
[1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:56.280]  is elder but he was born same year as i'm being sarcastic uh he's our chief legal strategist
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:00.520]  we're gonna file more suits tomorrow we're gonna go through who we're suing today because there
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:07.000]  are type of examples of the type of nasty uh folks in my opinion in view that that that think that
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:12.680]  they can simply make stuff up about people uh and then not be held accountable for it and a lot
[1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:18.680]  of these folks admit it's their plan to say these things to take me off air so it's malice of forethought
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:25.080]  intend to do harm we gave them a chance to retract and they didn't and we gave the folks at market
[1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:32.200]  watch uh a chances and they don't care because they're going for a broke ladies and gentlemen
[1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:36.520]  they're going for broke you know the young turks went on the show and said alex jones is going to
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:43.000]  be off the air probably going to jail they got very very excited and they chortled and laughed and
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:48.360]  later they pulled it down and didn't pull the tweets though and uh people come up to me now
[1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:52.920]  and they think that i'm a child pornographer and if you look at the comments when paul watson
[1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:56.440]  tweeted this out this morning there's a bunch of leftists saying oh you're just mad they caught you
[1:34:56.440 --> 1:35:01.080]  with your stash uh one of the people were suing says that i threatened to kill the sandyhood
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:07.720]  parents i mean they're trying to get me hurt folks and so we don't we're not litigious we're doing
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:12.520]  this for everybody's free speech and everybody to be protected and for conservatives christians
[1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:18.840]  and nationalistic pro-gun folks to stand up and let the left know the deranged left that it's not
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:24.920]  open season on us anymore that said robert barnes is doing this at cost for the filings and things
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:29.240]  but he intends to depose these people he intends to fly around airplanes and do all this with his
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:34.200]  team i've seen him do it myself with what he's doing we weren't going to be able to continue on
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:39.720]  with the legal fees uh that we had uh at the level we're at right now we'd have to cut back if barns
[1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:44.120]  hadn't come in and helped us cut back on some things and really streamline things but i gotta
[1:35:44.120 --> 1:35:51.960]  tell you you need to go to free americanlawcenter.com and become a member and you get a bunch of great
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:56.520]  legal uh information you get a bunch of uh special reports you you get free books
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:36:03.720]  because this guy is prolific and it's just great to be a member but listen we need to build our own
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:08.520]  ACLU we need to build our own southern property law center but actually defend everybody's
[1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:14.840]  freedoms and this is so precious right now to both defend free speech but also go on the offense
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:20.600]  against those that are trying to shut down our speech using defamation and libel so free american
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:27.240]  lawcenter.com uh mr barnes he has got a team together he's got lawyers all over the country
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:32.040]  ready to do this at cost but we don't just intend to sue people and then just get a publicity
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:36.760]  start out of we intend to depose them we intend to go after them we intend to fight them and let me
[1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:41.000]  give you an example uh hillary clinton's law firm spent a million and a half dollars on us with the
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:45.720]  pep of the frog thing the judge said hey listen you're going to win the case but pay him 15 thousand
[1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:50.200]  dollars a thousand dollars above the statutory what they could get see he limited him to that
[1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:53.560]  but i don't want this going to trial the waste everybody's time so i did what the judge said
[1:36:53.560 --> 1:36:57.320]  i could have forced that through but we spent a hundred thousand dollars they spent a million and a
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:37:04.520]  half that gives you an idea of the level of fights we're in right here this is serious business okay
[1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:09.480]  i'm fighting hillary clinton and i'm proud i am but i want to stay on the field i want to stay in
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:14.920]  the game coach and folks you are the coach you're the chief cook and bottle washer you're the whole
[1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:18.680]  nine yards and when you spread the word about the broadcast when you financially support us
[1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:23.960]  buying great products it makes all of this be able to continue on and happen so i am literally
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:28.280]  in your hands as i've said and it's been nipping tuck here but you guys just keep coming through
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:33.640]  so thank you plus you get great products but free american law center dot com everybody should go
[1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:38.440]  join and be a member not just for the great benefits but for knowing that you are standing
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:42.600]  with folks that aren't playing games and that mean to take action and barnes has a great
[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:48.200]  history and background of wins over 85 wins a lot of really big famous cases you never hear
[1:37:48.200 --> 1:37:53.000]  about because real lawyers you don't see on the national news generally they put the folks on
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:57.800]  that play footsie barnes talk about free american law center and then let's get into the suit against
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:02.280]  the young turks and others and while we're doing it sure so we needed a a counterpart to the southern
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:08.200]  poverty law center an antidote to the southern uh poverty law center an aclu for everybody not just
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:13.800]  the left the left has almost a monopoly on law fair and legal access to the legal system we need
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:19.080]  to democratize access to the legal system for ordinary everyday people against three particular
[1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:24.280]  threats that where they're unrepresented in our legal system today this included defamation this
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:28.280]  included whistleblowers against deep state activities this included protecting against
[1:38:28.280 --> 1:38:33.400]  deep platforming in order to do so i put together a team of lawyers and legal advisors and investigators
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:37.640]  and media representatives in a wide range of people to be able to make it effective and to
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:42.520]  make it efficient and to make it cost effective to be able to achieve and attain that change by
[1:38:42.520 --> 1:38:47.960]  democratizing access to the legal system at free america law center dot com we also made it very
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:53.320]  affordable and accessible for people to become monthly subscribers only cost 17 dollars and 76
[1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:57.800]  cents a month this is simply to cover costs this doesn't go to legal fees or anything else and once
[1:38:57.800 --> 1:39:02.040]  we get some wins it'll take years but once we get some big judgments which you've done many times
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:06.120]  then it'll become self funding and we're ready to really take it to them this is a long fight folks
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:10.280]  and it takes commitment exactly and then and the purpose of this is we need something that is
[1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:15.880]  sustainable we need to democratize access to the law by building a broad base of public support
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:21.000]  for an independent legal support organization that can make real these changes over time that can
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:26.840]  begin to bring the path breaking cases at the end like the n double acp did in the 1950s and 1960s
[1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:31.000]  like the aclu used to do when they were actually representing everybody on free speech like all
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.960]  over north and others so we need to do so in order to do democratize access and not make it
[1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:40.680]  ideological and partisan on the left like it is currently and we also provide additional benefits
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:45.560]  everybody's a monthly subscriber gets q and a podcast exclusive with legal experts they get to
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:51.720]  they get digital free books each month that provide self education about the bill of rights
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:55.800]  and the constitution so we provide a wide range of benefits that far exceed what the cost is on a
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:40:00.680]  monthly basis an awesome and again i challenged you a long time ago to do this and you said i've
[1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:04.040]  already been thinking about it you really hustled to get it up and to be doing it and you're already
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:09.480]  taking action uh we're suing three groups today more tomorrow and we mean business but that's
[1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:14.040]  going to take money folks so please you want to see action on this you've got some big whistleblower
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:17.640]  suits that are coming out in the next month as well actually we've already filed for robin gritz
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:22.120]  that's going to lead to the potential deposition of andrew mcabe robin gritz was a high ranking
[1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:26.440]  fbi agent one of the top counterterrorist so you're moving so fast i don't even let's tell
[1:40:26.440 --> 1:40:30.280]  folks about that at the start of the next hour before mike adams comes in we've got to get into
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:34.520]  our suits particularly about young turks that people are so excited about because there's such
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:39.160]  a long you know such such deceivers in my view i tell us about the suit absolutely so we filed
[1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:44.440]  suit uh today in the western district of texas alex jones versus branna woo a democratic
[1:40:44.440 --> 1:40:48.840]  congressional candidate in massachusetts who said tell them what she said uh what she had said is
[1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:54.200]  the suit alleges she stated on twitter and on other social media platforms she falsely accused you
[1:40:54.200 --> 1:40:58.840]  of sending child porn to the sandy hook families she also falsely accused you of threatening to
[1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:02.920]  murder sandy hook families on the air she knew this information was false at the time in which
[1:41:02.920 --> 1:41:08.600]  she said it as the suit makes clear and in addition continued to make the statement refuse to retract
[1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:14.280]  it or correct it despite specific requests to do so as the suit lays out as the suit also lays out
[1:41:14.280 --> 1:41:20.120]  the uh the young turks one of the most prominent media organizations in the country and in fact
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:24.600]  this video is still being recommended the title of the video the video has been taken down the
[1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:30.120]  false title the defamatory title is still being recommended by youtube and google to this very
[1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:34.600]  day if you simply do a search on alex jones on google or youtube if you do any search and if you
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:39.480]  watch a cbs news article or or mainstream press article or establishment press article right
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:43.800]  underneath it it will recommend that you look at this young turks headline which the young turks
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:49.480]  itself knew is false new is defamatory new is libel the young turks is backed by youtube backed by
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:54.600]  google fully monetized supported their videos recommended uh they have billionaire supporters
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:58.440]  they have foreign government supporters they have a wide range of establishment democratic press
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:02.600]  supporters oh and the republican and democrat national conventions they run the google stage
[1:42:02.600 --> 1:42:06.680]  i mean they have multiple levels of access and control that other independent members of the
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:10.520]  press they can have that taken down absolutely and they should have i specifically requested
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:14.680]  chanck who's the leader of the young turks he who founded the name who created who's a lawyer
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:20.040]  knows exactly what he's doing absolutely that he immediately retract delete and correct what he said
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:24.520]  and what the young turks said said and to this day they have refused they falsely accused you

[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:33.240]  the whole story was a lie and libel they even hidden the video that that showed that in fact
[1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:37.480]  they knew this was lie and libel yet they refused to correct the tweets refused to correct this
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:41.640]  misleading headline article that is still being repeated on youtube to this and we're

[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:11.560]  minion oliver darcy have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air into censor
[1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:15.800]  us and of course he famously said along many others that trump is the info wars president
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:21.720]  president trump's furious reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry to say

[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:57.080]  gone after these people before he's gone after these heavy hitters and the swamp so we're not

[1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:04.520]  know you're taking action and really having an effect when you pray for us when you spread the
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:08.920]  word about the shows you share links and articles and word of mouth and when you buy the products
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:12.840]  ladies and gentlemen i've even gotten to trump saying we're going to defend the second amendment
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:18.840]  and not curtail it at the un i know you've watched the speech 43 minutes long how would you describe
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:23.720]  it it's just it's just fabulous it's it's like the antidote to cyanide it's like water in the
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:29.080]  desert it's like sunshine to plants i mean this was just amazing and he said we're going after
[1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:33.960]  big tech i mean wow oh no doubt about it and to do so from the un stage and to say that he's not
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:38.920]  going to embrace globalism can is going to continue to contest globalism has continued to
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:43.320]  promote a free america that's like in 1940 going into the Reichstag and giving a speech against
[1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:47.880]  naziism right in front of hitler exactly and it's it's it's parallel to what he's doing with
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:53.000]  ukraine trying to provide for a free world that is free of the corruption and collusion
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:57.080]  that has been happening on a routine and regular basis between the deep state and democratic
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:01.640]  political establishment to manipulate foreign governments for the self-enrichment and self-empowerment
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:07.560]  of corrupt colluded elites uh and so the same thing he's doing at the un is the same reason
[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:13.480]  why he's being attacked he's being attacked because he's willing to uncover and investigate and expose
[1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:18.600]  the degree to which the deep state democratic political party alignment has corrupted foreign
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:23.080]  governments has corrupted our own political institutions and is willing to expose that
[1:49:23.080 --> 1:49:27.400]  at personal risk to himself and what's insane is this isn't hype this is really happening
[1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:31.640]  it makes me embarrassed that i've gotten mad at trump so much but we're all in this together
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:35.480]  we're getting our asses handed to us we're winning politically but god does it hurt
[1:49:35.480 --> 1:49:38.840]  so how do you describe it i mean i know you're even more positive on trump than i am
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:44.680]  because you're more confident how i work through this love hate thing because i don't hate trump
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:50.200]  but i hate the fact that he's not doing more but i guess he thinks if he moves too fast
[1:49:50.200 --> 1:49:53.800]  they'll be able to stop him do you think his formula is correct oh i think his formula is
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:59.080]  absolutely correct and i think the main thing that his supporters that feel disappointed at
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:04.360]  different times underestimate uh the very the thing that the q supporters didn't really recognize
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:10.120]  or realize is the degree to which the president is isolated and ostracized from the political
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:13.800]  corrupt establishment that exists in united states today the deep state oh yeah that's the
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:17.080]  thing with q and i don't want to bash folks that like it and it's fun and it's cutesy but you know
[1:50:17.080 --> 1:50:21.800]  we really talk to these folks we're really plugged in is that it then it's his fantasy
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:26.120]  that there's all these good guys high up and trumps got it in hand he's got it in hand because
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:30.920]  he's a real leader he's only got a few people that actually do supporting and so this is one hell of
[1:50:30.920 --> 1:50:36.760]  a real fight here absolutely he's way we've reached a roman empire stage is what a Yale historian
[1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:41.720]  described it as where we become the political clack capital has become entrenched with corruption
[1:50:41.720 --> 1:50:46.920]  and institutionalized corruption and i think people underestimated an entitlement like sjw
[1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:50.920]  absolutely and i think people underestimated the scope of it i mean here you have a private
[1:50:50.920 --> 1:50:56.200]  confidential communication conversation with a president elected to clean up a foreign government
[1:50:56.200 --> 1:51:00.200]  in part to clean up that foreign government from corrupting influences of the united states
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:04.520]  including deep state and democratic political operatives who have used their country to enrich
[1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:09.800]  and empower themselves and i read it this morning and got tears in my eyes i was proud of trump
[1:51:09.800 --> 1:51:13.160]  i mean yeah we're trying to drain your swamp you're trying to drain yeah we're draining it
[1:51:13.160 --> 1:51:17.400]  man you see biden on tv admitting he got this guy fired and threatened money that's illegal that's
[1:51:17.400 --> 1:51:22.040]  crazy i mean and then and then the news turns it around that he's dirty oh exactly they have no
[1:51:22.040 --> 1:51:27.560]  choice but to do because ukraine opens the door to the scope and that is in the severity of the
[1:51:27.560 --> 1:51:31.400]  degree of depravity let me ask you this how do you think this ends gut level because they're
[1:51:31.400 --> 1:51:36.520]  getting crazier by the minute and i don't want to be overconfident here i mean this is this is
[1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:42.280]  insane i mean i'm more scared of the democrats because they're so crazy but they're wild eyed
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:47.080]  right now they're just nuts and they well it's like anyone exposed they're looking in the mirror
[1:51:47.080 --> 1:51:50.440]  and they're projecting onto others that which what they see in themselves particularly in
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:55.080]  fearing that the deepest most problematic aspects of their institutional power will now
[1:51:55.080 --> 1:51:59.880]  be exposed for the whole world to see because what they're accusing the president trump of is in fact
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:05.160]  what joe biden did and what the president trump is doing is recognizing there's a serious problem
[1:52:05.160 --> 1:52:09.080]  and wanting to clean it up and their attempt to change the subject is crazy oh yeah i mean
[1:52:09.080 --> 1:52:13.320]  they need to shift the story they need to accuse him of what they themselves are involved and then
[1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:17.800]  now the transcript comes out and it proves what he said incredible i want to get to our suits because
[1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:21.400]  these are everybody's suits this is fighting back everybody wants it everybody said we should do it
[1:52:21.400 --> 1:52:26.280]  well we're doing it these are just outrageous things they said done we're going to get to that

[1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:53.720]  other individual from mother jones so andrew kimmel who is a national affairs editor with
[1:54:53.720 --> 1:54:59.240]  mother jones has had prior affiliations and associations and ties to buzzfeed who's been
[1:54:59.240 --> 1:55:03.720]  very sort of trolls various people on the internet on the social media sites that he politically
[1:55:03.720 --> 1:55:09.080]  disagrees with he went out and put also put up the false statements concerning what was happening
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:14.280]  in the matter in the case that just as the young turks did and to read right from the suit the suit
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:20.280]  that knowing that jones was an intended victim of an email attack on his employer's computer servers
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:26.040]  by cyber criminals the defendants including andrew kimmel including the young turks including
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:32.360]  riana woo chose to lie and libel jones instead accusing him of a federal felony they knew he
[1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:37.480]  did not commit jones never possessed any child pornography transmitted at none of it all of
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:41.320]  that they knew was fault and even after the fbi gave us a letter saying that they wouldn't take it
[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:46.440]  down exactly here you have cyber criminals trying to plant child pornography on info wars servers
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:51.080]  no and using terminology in the emails knowing that those would be forced to be turned over
[1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:57.080]  in court ordered hidden child porn hidden code completely totally hidden disguise and use
[1:55:57.080 --> 1:56:01.800]  terminology that they knew those emails would have to be turned over by court order independent
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:07.320]  litigation that's why the fbi identified you and info wars as a victim as the targeted victim
[1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:12.120]  of cyber criminals and here you have these people my lord we broke this first and expose that they
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:16.360]  knew exactly it was done the the weekend before and so even though they knew all of these facts
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:19.960]  that was their response they knew that you'd never committed any kind of crime never sent
[1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:25.160]  anything to the sandy hook families in this regard at all weren't complicit or involved at all were
[1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:29.880]  the victim they try to make you the perpetrator and they continued to lie in libel even when
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:34.120]  retraction requests were made correction requests were made this is so out of control the supreme
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:38.360]  court of connecticut has taken over the sandy hook case saying i'm being basically railroaded
[1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:43.320]  that's being heard tomorrow i mean before ever went to trial there's this public interest that's
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:47.240]  like when you catch you know the judge with a bunch of money in the back of the truck from the
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:51.720]  mafia that's when the supreme court gets involved the court gets involved when courts when lower
[1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:56.200]  courts take extraordinary action that requires extraordinary remedy and here the lower court
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:57:01.000]  said that uh out of courtroom speech could be used as a basis to deprive you of rights within the
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:05.960]  court system i found that very constitutionally dubious that order that opinion the judge issued
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:10.120]  her opinion for the reason she did and we're not questioning her basis or motivation we're saying
[1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:15.160]  that the the legal ideas in the order were deeply problematic for a free press and free speech in
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:18.520]  america and that's what's being challenged and that's why whatever the connecticut supreme court
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:22.680]  does the case is likely to reach exactly one of the famous cases not this judge you know where the
[1:57:22.680 --> 1:57:25.880]  judge is caught with the mafia and then you know they have a public interest comes in i mean this
[1:57:25.880 --> 1:57:32.040]  is very rare uh correct it's when big constitutional issues are involved and so this is a big constitutional
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:36.120]  case that's why i say your cases will be the tip of the spear for free speech and free press in
[1:57:36.120 --> 1:57:39.080]  america and let's just be clear it's not the connecticut supreme court's a bunch of right
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:43.560]  wingers i am literally being crucified so bad people are having to get involved we'll be right
[1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:50.200]  back stay with us my fellow freedom lovers i'm very excited to bring you vaso beats i've been wanting

[2:00:13.800 --> 2:00:18.680]  all right mike adams is absolutely fire breathing ready to take over out there
[2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:24.520]  some of them want and we're looking forward to that he wasn't again into the fact that google
[2:00:24.520 --> 2:00:32.440]  is already involved uh in quantum computing they're always way more advanced than they're saying they
[2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:36.760]  are and so he's gonna be getting into that but now he's really on the impeachment deal he's an
[2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:41.320]  expert on that so much and you're going to come back in and host the fourth hour and again folks
[2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:45.560]  i could be here for this but i like to have these experts and where they can really have the floor
[2:00:45.560 --> 2:00:49.800]  and so i'm not in here jumping back and forth but you also said more good news in virginia the
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:55.560]  judge said i can go forward with my interlockatory appeal that's the that's georgetown suing me
[2:00:55.560 --> 2:01:01.000]  ladies and gentlemen that's georgetown literally the democratic party and people hear their free
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:06.680]  speech clinic going after me and you read the suit it's not even what we said it is total fiction
[2:01:06.680 --> 2:01:10.920]  yeah there's different there's aspects of the suit that really do not seem to make sense to me
[2:01:10.920 --> 2:01:15.800]  but one of the big issues was whether they could sue in charlottesville for comments or statements
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:21.240]  that were made in austin texas so the uh that what the court has to determine is where should
[2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:26.840]  the appropriate forum be and the district court uh originally was not going to grant the interlockatory
[2:01:26.840 --> 2:01:32.680]  appeal reexamine the issues issued a very thoughtful opinion which said yes this should go up to the
[2:01:32.680 --> 2:01:36.840]  fourth circuit court of appeals they should determine where should these cases be brought
[2:01:36.840 --> 2:01:40.440]  when they should be brought and how they should be brought and whether here or not he made the
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:44.680]  right decision in saying it could move forward in charlottesville so i think that's important that
[2:01:44.680 --> 2:01:49.400]  that move forward uh that again all of these are going to establish core constitutional rights
[2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:55.080]  about whether and where and when a person can be sued one of the cases the free america law
[2:01:55.080 --> 2:01:59.960]  center is supporting one of the primary ones is the covington kids right now with the federal
[2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:04.600]  courts are going to be determining in the covington case whether politicians are completely immune
[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:10.520]  from liability and can be even immune from state torts and state courts merely because
[2:02:10.520 --> 2:02:14.920]  they're an elected politician and a member of congress so all of these cases involving you
[2:02:14.920 --> 2:02:19.560]  involving uh the robin gritz case the covington cases all the cases free america law center
[2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:23.240]  handling by the way you haven't lost your cases like the other guy no that's correct the covington
[2:02:23.240 --> 2:02:26.840]  case they're moving and you predicted all this was going to happen oh yes kind of magic how those
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:31.400]  got thrown out right away you told me privately that was about to happen yeah the they went after
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:35.960]  we had requested i had requested that the institutional press issue various forms of
[2:02:35.960 --> 2:02:40.520]  corrections and retractions and deletions and almost all of them did the only people who were
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:45.320]  sued that i brought suits against were those who had not done any kind of corrective action
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:49.640]  that's just like the cases you brought today the you have avoided filing these kind of cases
[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:53.640]  and in the past because you want to give people a second third fourth fifth chances
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:57.560]  want to protect a free press and a free speech but these are people using their institutional
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:01.480]  platforms to suppress free press i don't mean to interrupt you'll talk about this more when you
[2:03:01.480 --> 2:03:06.840]  host the fourth hour for mike adams comes in here from natural news dot com you already
[2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:11.240]  filed a major whistleblower suit and there's other big ones coming tell people briefly about that
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:15.800]  exactly so we filed a suit on behalf of robin gritz one of the top fbi agents in the country
[2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:20.040]  who was forced out of the fbi by andrew mccabe and others she was one of the first people to
[2:03:20.040 --> 2:03:25.400]  highlight the degree of corruption involving andrew mccabe at the fbi she was one of the critical
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:30.440]  whistleblowers against deep state activities uh and on behalf of uh to support the president
[2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:34.840]  trump uh and so we are supporting her case against the fbi for the wrongful termination
[2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:39.560]  and dismissal of her filing that in federal court that case has already been filed it's moved to the
[2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:44.520]  what's called the motion to dismiss stage uh to the pleading stage once we get past that
[2:03:44.520 --> 2:03:48.920]  then we're getting into actual discovery we may be able to even depose andrew mccabe himself
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:53.000]  for the first time in a real meaningful case that could expose the degree of corruption that he's
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:57.240]  been up to so it's a critical essential it's the leading whistleblower case against the deep
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:02.280]  state in the country again supported by free america law center and again this the key here is
[2:04:02.280 --> 2:04:06.760]  anything real you're not going to see coverage of like our suit against the young turks mother
[2:04:06.760 --> 2:04:13.320]  jones and this other woman that said that i said kill the sandy hook kids just total not true uh to
[2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:17.480]  get me off air is the plan obviously they've said that you're not going to see that in the news okay
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:21.960]  that's why they have total lying headlines we're filing suit about tomorrow saying i wrote a book
[2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:27.560]  about sandy hook and lost a suit okay we got a false suit tomorrow on that uh so a lot is going on
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:32.920]  a lot is happening we're gonna play a few clips of trump uh at the un and then mike adams is coming
[2:04:32.920 --> 2:04:37.080]  in plus we have a new message from the communist chinese ministry of truth straight ahead please

[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:56.840]  that is worth defending and celebrating and which gives us our singular potential and strength
[2:07:58.280 --> 2:08:06.360]  the free world must embrace its national foundations it must not attempt to erase them
[2:08:06.360 --> 2:08:20.120]  or replace them looking around and all over this large magnificent planet the truth is plain to see
[2:08:21.400 --> 2:08:30.040]  if you want freedom take pride in your country if you want democracy hold on to your sovereignty
[2:08:30.040 --> 2:08:40.200]  and if you want peace love your nation wise leaders always put the good of their own people
[2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:49.320]  and their own country first the future does not belong to globalists the future belongs
[2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:57.400]  to patriots the future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:09.240]  respect their neighbors and honor the differences that make each country special and unique
[2:09:12.920 --> 2:09:17.000]  president trump just delivered an ultimatum to the globalist with that speech and that's why
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:22.360]  they're pulling out all the stops to go after him and destroy him in any way possible thank you for
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:27.720]  joining me this is mike adam stepping in for the third hour of this info wars alex jones show
[2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:33.880]  broadcast robert barnes will be back to explain more details about the lawsuit that alex jones
[2:09:33.880 --> 2:09:38.280]  has filed against the young turks and other parties he'll be back in the fourth hour that is robert
[2:09:38.280 --> 2:09:44.200]  barnes for this hour i'm going to cover details about impeachment also quantum computing as alex
[2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:53.000]  hinted earlier we now know that there is a 2048 qubit quantum computing system that is almost
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:57.240]  certainly possessed by google and the nsa i'll talk about the implications of that computing
[2:09:57.240 --> 2:10:02.200]  platform and what it means for the future of human freedom if there is any freedom left
[2:10:02.200 --> 2:10:06.680]  after there can be no more secrets and no more encryption we'll talk about that but first getting
[2:10:06.680 --> 2:10:13.320]  to impeachment it's very clear at this point that president trump set a trap for the democrats
[2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:20.760]  and nancy polosi stumbled right into it she just swallowed it hook line and sinker if you think
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:26.920]  about it the trap is is genius this is beyond you know 4d chess this is president trump
[2:10:26.920 --> 2:10:31.560]  counting on the fact that democrats are going to take the bait on everything and what he did
[2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:36.120]  is he set up actually a conversation with the president of ukraine where they talk about the
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:41.960]  corruption and the criminality of joe biden and then trump managed to get the democrats begging
[2:10:41.960 --> 2:10:48.040]  for the release of the transcript of the phone call that talks about joe biden being this you
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:55.160]  know corrupt international what do you say a money grubber at the international level redirecting
[2:10:55.160 --> 2:11:01.720]  funds to his family to his son and rudy juliani last night on the laura ingram show talked about
[2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:06.280]  how he's got all the financial records they know the amount of money they've got the transaction
[2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:11.960]  dates and how it was funneled through at least three different countries to come back to the biden
[2:11:11.960 --> 2:11:16.920]  family and guess what all that detail is going to come out now it's all going to come out because
[2:11:16.920 --> 2:11:23.000]  the democrats just couldn't resist the bait they want to destroy trump so badly that they will end
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:29.480]  up destroying themselves in the process so we are now watching two very important things taking
[2:11:29.480 --> 2:11:36.280]  place number one the destruction of the democrat party as we know it today the self-destruction
[2:11:36.280 --> 2:11:42.920]  has begun and nancy polosi her days as speaker are very much numbered she will be one of the
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:49.640]  casualties i predict of this fiasco that they've unleashed upon america and also joe biden he will
[2:11:49.640 --> 2:11:56.040]  go down in terms of not being a candidate very very soon joe biden is going to be out and that
[2:11:56.040 --> 2:12:02.440]  means that elizabeth warn is very likely the democrat candidate who will face off against trump
[2:12:02.440 --> 2:12:08.360]  and elizabeth warn i mean you know she's an intelligent woman she sounds compassionate she
[2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:14.040]  seems to care about people but her ideas are broken her ideas are socialism and sort of
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:20.040]  communism light and they don't work and she's got a history of lying about herself about her you
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:25.560]  know native american ancestry which is one one thousand twenty fourth apparently according to her own
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:33.400]  genetic tests but she used that that woman of color privilege to gain access and gain power
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:39.560]  through academia and elsewhere all that's going to come out yet again so by going after president
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:47.320]  trump here nancy polosi i think in my analysis just made sure that trump wins reelection in 2020
[2:12:47.320 --> 2:12:54.280]  but it also means by the way nancy polosi is admitting that the democrats are willing to
[2:12:54.280 --> 2:13:00.840]  risk thrusting america into a civil war to try to destroy president trump they're willing to do
[2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:07.080]  anything recognize that this is nothing other than the democrats once again trying to overthrow
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:14.200]  the will of the people the people elected president trump in 2016 we elected him and
[2:13:14.200 --> 2:13:18.920]  by the way if you throw out the votes of illegal aliens in california and elsewhere
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:26.040]  a trump actually won the popular vote too the popular vote of americans but the democrats
[2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:30.760]  couldn't handle it from day one so they tried to block the electoral college to change the
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:36.440]  votes they tried to block his inauguration and from day one since the president president trump
[2:13:36.440 --> 2:13:41.240]  stepped into the white house they have tried to destroy him through the spy gate fiasco the russia
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:48.040]  collusion hoax by installing spies into his administration by barack obama breaking the
[2:13:48.040 --> 2:13:54.840]  law abusing police state powers by surveillance which was pioneered by john brennan and andrew
[2:13:54.840 --> 2:13:59.400]  mccabe was part of it and james comey was part of it all of these schemes and all of these leaks
[2:13:59.400 --> 2:14:04.680]  and all of these secret plots and plans to take out trump and it all failed the whole time
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:11.400]  all of it failed so now they are so desperate that they're rolling out think about it russia
[2:14:11.400 --> 2:14:18.360]  collusion part two the ukraine chapter and it is already collapsing in their faces but the fact
[2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:25.240]  that they're willing to risk risk america to push us into the possibility of civil war tells you
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:29.800]  everything that you need to know about these democrats they don't care about you they don't
[2:14:29.800 --> 2:14:36.040]  care about america they don't care about the rule of law they will destroy this country if it means
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:41.880]  getting rid of trump and possibly getting their own people back into power the democrats don't
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:48.200]  want america to do well they're willing to sacrifice america and risk everything as long as they the
[2:14:48.200 --> 2:14:53.480]  democrats maintain power and control they don't believe in democracy they don't believe in this
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:58.280]  republic they don't believe in the rule of law or honoring the outcome of elections they don't
[2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:04.360]  believe in civility they don't believe in morality or ethics or honesty or anything all they believe
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:10.120]  in is raw naked power and they'll do anything to get it and they'll destroy anyone to get it and i
[2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:16.200]  think by the way they'll kill anyone to get it they'll kill anyone and just look at the trail of
[2:15:16.200 --> 2:15:22.680]  bodies behind you know the dnc and the clinton foundation and the whole history of what the
[2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:28.760]  democrats have done it's a long trail of body bags and you know what the american people are now
[2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:33.000]  saying we're not going to let you keep steamrolling us we're not going to let you kill us off anymore

[2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:21.080]  on how the chai cons are stealing intellectual property depended on massive market barriers

[2:21:12.840 --> 2:21:17.880]  trump as he fights the globalists as well now for this segment it's going to get into some of the
[2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:23.400]  practical things that you can do to help protect yourself against the new risk of civil war that
[2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:30.760]  nancy polosi is thrusting us all into remember by supporting impeachment nancy polosi is risking
[2:21:30.760 --> 2:21:38.520]  total chaos in america she is risking our republic just to achieve her political aims in essence
[2:21:38.520 --> 2:21:43.880]  in my view the democrat party has become a terrorist organization they are terrorizing america
[2:21:43.880 --> 2:21:47.960]  they're threatening this country and they're willing to do anything and i think even they're
[2:21:47.960 --> 2:21:53.160]  willing to kill anybody that it takes in their minds to achieve power so what can you do to
[2:21:53.160 --> 2:21:56.840]  protect yourself i brought a couple of items here gonna do a little show and tell which is kind of
[2:21:56.840 --> 2:22:03.240]  unusual um right here on the desk with the overhead cam for those of you watching this is just a
[2:22:03.240 --> 2:22:09.080]  regular looking backpack and what you can do with any kind of a regular backpack to help defend
[2:22:09.080 --> 2:22:15.240]  yourself is you can purchase a ballistic panel and put it into the backpack i just want to show you
[2:22:15.240 --> 2:22:20.200]  that right here so you don't necessarily have to go out and buy a bulletproof backpack you can get
[2:22:20.200 --> 2:22:26.440]  a ballistic panel like this this is a fairly large one looks like it's what 12 by 16 perhaps
[2:22:27.080 --> 2:22:33.800]  and this panel is a level 3a ballistic panel that of course protects against virtually all handguns
[2:22:34.440 --> 2:22:40.200]  but not necessarily of course high caliber rifle fire but if you are concerned about things
[2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:46.760]  happening in society or getting caught in some kind of a firefight maybe you live near a liberal
[2:22:46.760 --> 2:22:51.800]  city and as trump wins reelection you know the liberals are going to go totally insane it's
[2:22:51.800 --> 2:22:56.840]  going to be the zombie apocalypse probably in some areas you might want to defend yourself
[2:22:56.840 --> 2:23:02.280]  and have this and the thing is it doesn't look like ballistic gear you could have this backpack
[2:23:02.280 --> 2:23:06.600]  you can just wear it like a regular backpack you know you can put your work gear in here you can
[2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:12.040]  buy any backpack to do this with that's the point here you put this panel in now you're protected
[2:23:12.040 --> 2:23:18.120]  you can even swing this pack around to the front of your body wear it on your chest if you are
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:24.520]  engaging someone maybe you are you have a concealed carry like i do i always carry concealed
[2:23:24.520 --> 2:23:29.480]  so maybe you you know you swing this backpack around and actually wear it on the front of your
[2:23:29.480 --> 2:23:35.960]  body while you are engaging or retreating or whatever you need to do my only word of caution
[2:23:35.960 --> 2:23:42.360]  is of course know your local laws keep it legal you know always follow the local laws and if you
[2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:48.520]  live in an area that doesn't allow you to own a ballistic panels then maybe you're living in the
[2:23:48.520 --> 2:23:54.360]  wrong city or state but these panels are very inexpensive i've seen panels like this as low as
[2:23:54.360 --> 2:23:59.800]  i think on sale like forty nine dollars so you know a backpack like this might cost you
[2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:06.520]  you know 50 to 100 bucks for another 50 bucks you can put a panel in it and now you have a ballistic
[2:24:06.520 --> 2:24:10.680]  backpack and the other cool thing is you can take that panel out you can put it in
[2:24:10.680 --> 2:24:16.360]  even your briefcase so maybe you carry a briefcase to work you can sort of velcro that panel inside
[2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:22.360]  your briefcase briefcase and if you have to you could just use that briefcase to block yourself
[2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:28.280]  if there's gunfire maybe you're working in a gunfree zone right which are magnets for mass
[2:24:28.280 --> 2:24:31.880]  shooters because they know no one's going to shoot back so if you're forced to work in a
[2:24:31.880 --> 2:24:35.800]  gunfree zone you know you could you could have a briefcase with that and you could you could
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:40.920]  literally protect yourself or choose to protect someone else while you evacuate or maybe engage
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:46.760]  or whatever you need to do and and this i think is legal everywhere but check your local laws
[2:24:46.760 --> 2:24:53.720]  now another thing that's very important about this is in terms of gear is i'm going to show you
[2:24:53.720 --> 2:25:01.720]  an 80% lower here because the state of new york has just issued a cease and desist order to five
[2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:08.040]  companies to stop selling these to new yorkers and this is this is called an 80% lower and this
[2:25:08.040 --> 2:25:14.920]  is an anodized lower that you you use yourself you you you mill it out either with like a ghost
[2:25:14.920 --> 2:25:21.000]  gunner machine or you can get you know milling devices that you can mill this out with and then
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:27.560]  you can build your own firearm legally under federal law so this kind of ar-15 lower it's
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:33.000]  anodized and what i wanted to show you is you see where i've dremeled off these areas on top
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:40.920]  and there are a couple inside in that magwell you see an x and y and then also back here on this
[2:25:40.920 --> 2:25:45.800]  this area hold on see if i can get it for you where you attach the grip you have to dremel those three
[2:25:45.800 --> 2:25:56.440]  areas right there x y and z and then you can actually make an ar-15 lower legally as long as
[2:25:56.440 --> 2:26:01.160]  you don't sell it and you don't transfer it and you follow local laws understand that in places
[2:26:01.160 --> 2:26:07.160]  like new jersey this is illegal so don't violate the law in new jersey instead leave new jersey
[2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:11.160]  and go to a place where you can do this legally under federal law it is legal to manufacture
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:17.160]  your own firearm for personal defensive use and that's what these ar-15 80 percent lowers are all
[2:26:17.160 --> 2:26:23.960]  about now of course infamores doesn't sell these this is not a commercial promotion i'm just mentioning
[2:26:23.960 --> 2:26:29.640]  this because these are about to be outlawed everywhere and so in fact i think one of the
[2:26:29.640 --> 2:26:36.280]  recent shootings involved an individual who may have i think he purchased his gun illegally from
[2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:41.480]  someone who manufactured a firearm from this so they were violating laws they were going around
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:46.760]  existing gun laws but the fact that that happened leads me to believe that there will be attempts to
[2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:53.480]  ban these lowers everywhere across america everywhere you know at the federal level
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:27:00.280]  so if you want to legally and safely manufacture your own firearm for your own personal defense
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:04.440]  you might want to think about this because remember nancy polosi is pushing us into civil war
[2:27:04.440 --> 2:27:08.680]  war that's what that's exactly what she's doing you have a right to defend yourself
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:17.480]  and you have i believe an obligation to defend the country to to help our country defend itself
[2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:23.960]  against domestic and domestic enemies you know foreign enemies and all of that so exercise your
[2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:30.840]  rights exercise your liberties or you will lose them but always follow the law i'd never encourage
[2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:36.280]  anyone to violate federal law in any of this but that's how the show and tell works and that's why
[2:27:36.280 --> 2:27:40.920]  this is so crucial remember if you don't if you don't exercise your first amendment if you don't
[2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:46.200]  exercise your second amendment then you will have no future because they will take it from you they
[2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:52.040]  will absolutely take it from you and you will have nothing left but you know obedience to greta
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:27:58.440]  you will have to bow down before greta the eco hysterical child who in my opinion has been subjected
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:03.960]  to psychological terrorism and you know clear child abuse i feel sorry for that girl i think
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:10.120]  we should have a new hashtag called rescue greta we should rescue greta from her handlers and set
[2:28:10.120 --> 2:28:15.880]  her free let's have greta here on the alex jones show so we can actually teach her the truth about
[2:28:15.880 --> 2:28:22.120]  the fact that hey greta your childhood has not been stolen from you by fossil fuels your childhood
[2:28:22.120 --> 2:28:27.480]  has been stolen from you by your hysterical radical left-wing handlers who have terrorized you
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:33.960]  and made you a prisoner of their fear to roll you out as a human shield weapon system against the
[2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:39.880]  world i feel sorry for you greta why don't you come on in for wars i'll interview you or alex will
[2:28:39.880 --> 2:28:44.360]  will help set you straight and let you know you have a bright future ahead of you if you can escape
[2:28:44.360 --> 2:28:50.280]  these terroristic handlers pushing you into mass hysteria much more straight ahead straight ahead

[2:29:15.800 --> 2:29:19.880]  historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the mississippi because of the
[2:29:19.880 --> 2:29:24.600]  flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it

[2:30:17.000 --> 2:30:22.440]  complex beware their tyranny speech where he talked about technological elite he came out and he
[2:30:22.440 --> 2:30:29.000]  exposed how big tech is a new ruling class that is manipulating the minds of the people and engaging
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:35.880]  in massive oppression and he talked about how globalism is not the future of the world and
[2:30:35.880 --> 2:30:41.560]  trump has done a great job exposing the un the globalist and the chai cons in their house that

[2:32:51.400 --> 2:33:07.320]  more until the middle of 2020 and fours life dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:07.320 --> 2:33:21.320]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[2:33:23.800 --> 2:33:29.400]  all right we're going to get into some really interesting science today but i promised not
[2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:35.480]  to geek out on you with the science lingo this is about quantum computing and you know i was here
[2:33:35.480 --> 2:33:41.880]  with alex on sunday we were talking about google's recent announcement of quote quantum supremacy
[2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:46.840]  and with that announcement which was published by nasa and then covered by fortune magazine and
[2:33:46.840 --> 2:33:53.720]  financial times google had claimed to have a 53 cubit quantum computer which you may know a quantum
[2:33:53.720 --> 2:33:59.320]  computer is very good at breaking encryption basically simplified a 53 cubit computer can
[2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:06.680]  break 53 bit encryption in fractions of a second typically so off the air i was talking with alex
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:12.440]  you know between during the breaks and we were both just talking about how you know google's got
[2:34:12.440 --> 2:34:19.320]  way more than 53 cubits because whether it's nasa or google or the nsa you know anything by the time
[2:34:19.320 --> 2:34:26.360]  they spill it publicly they're usually 10 to 20 years more ahead of that and so what i went home
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:30.280]  and i started digging and doing a little more research on this and i found out that google was
[2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:35.640]  using a hardware platform for quantum computing called d wave it's it's from d wave systems which
[2:34:35.640 --> 2:34:43.480]  is a company out of canada and it didn't take long to realize that d wave has a 2048 cubit
[2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:51.560]  quantum computer and it's called the d2000 no kidding it's d wave systems and they have a
[2:34:51.560 --> 2:34:57.240]  a brochure they've got a pdf file on it and everything so i went through all of their specs
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:35:03.960]  about that system and it's mind-boggling what it means is that they already have 2048 cubit
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:09.720]  quantum computing which means they already have the capability to break military grade encryption
[2:35:10.440 --> 2:35:15.640]  they have the the capabilities to break cryptocurrency encryption if they want to
[2:35:16.280 --> 2:35:20.200]  it's still cost money to buy quantum computers obviously it's tens of millions of dollars and
[2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:26.920]  so on and it uses some electricity so it's not free for them to use but have no doubt folks
[2:35:26.920 --> 2:35:32.600]  they are right now breaking military grade encryption they are breaking the encryption
[2:35:32.600 --> 2:35:39.080]  on files for their specific political targets no doubt whatsoever the nsa is using this probably
[2:35:39.080 --> 2:35:45.240]  to break encrypted files involving communist china and some of the enemies of america as well possibly
[2:35:45.240 --> 2:35:53.240]  iran you know possibly russia this technology already exists yeah i mean it it it's here
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:57.560]  and in this segment i'm going to explain a little bit how quantum computing works because
[2:35:57.560 --> 2:36:03.640]  it's crucial that all of us understand this means there are no more secrets that you can
[2:36:03.640 --> 2:36:11.160]  encrypt files today and you think they're safe and you email them to a friend and the nsa will
[2:36:11.160 --> 2:36:16.440]  keep a copy of those files they will keep a copy of all your encrypted emails all your encrypted
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:21.080]  transactions or spreadsheets or anything and even though they may not be able to read them right
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:28.280]  now you fast forward one two three maybe four years they will retroactively decrypt everything
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:34.760]  that you are sending that's encrypted and it's going to cost them almost nothing at that scale
[2:36:34.760 --> 2:36:38.760]  because they'll just have multiple quantum computers just crunching all the encrypted files
[2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:43.880]  and turning them into plain text so anything this is crucial anything that you send today
[2:36:43.880 --> 2:36:50.120]  over email or or download across the internet that's encrypted it can be retroactively broken
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:55.320]  in the future because the nsa is hoovering up all your documents and all your communications and
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:37:01.480]  storing them in that that big utah data center what's it called like bumble something but i forgot
[2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:05.960]  the name of it it's uh it's a it's a data center massive data center in utah where they're storing
[2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:11.400]  everything and they're storing these and everything that you send and everything that you do now here's
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:18.120]  how quantum computing works this is just freaky this is crucial to understand quantum computing
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:25.000]  doesn't do any actual computing quantum computing relies on the underlying structure
[2:37:25.640 --> 2:37:32.280]  of the computational fabric of the cosmos in order to solve complex mathematical problems
[2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:38.200]  and achieve what are called the lowest energy state solutions or the least chaotic solutions
[2:37:38.200 --> 2:37:43.080]  you would say from a mathematical point of view in other words if you're going to break encryption
[2:37:43.080 --> 2:37:48.680]  all you need to do is factor very large integers so a large integer is a big long number it might
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:53.960]  have you know 100 digits or 200 digits whatever depends on how many bits are in the encryption
[2:37:53.960 --> 2:37:59.080]  but imagine a 100 digit number now if i gave you that number and i said tell me the factors of that
[2:37:59.080 --> 2:38:05.400]  number like what two smaller numbers multiplied together will equal that big number you would say
[2:38:06.200 --> 2:38:09.240]  well gosh i'm going to have to have a computer crunch on this for about a million years and
[2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:14.200]  that's not even an exaggeration uh in order to find those factors because factoring large integers
[2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:20.440]  is very very difficult using classical computing but in a quantum computer all you do is you set
[2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:26.520]  the spin states of rare atomic elements like holmium for example you set the spin states of
[2:38:26.520 --> 2:38:31.880]  the electrons in the outer orbital shell of those atomic elements to equal the large number
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:39.800]  and then you basically say go and the universe tries every possible combination of every possible
[2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:45.400]  answer and it brings you back a list of the most likely answers in other words the universe is doing
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:51.480]  your math for you it's like the cosmos did your homework and gave you back the cheat sheet of the
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:56.760]  possible answers it'll give you like the top 10 most likely factors for this big number and then
[2:38:56.760 --> 2:39:01.160]  you just plug in those 10 factors and then you get the decryption key for the file you're trying to
[2:39:01.160 --> 2:39:06.280]  decrypt and then you can decrypt it you know in a split second or a couple of seconds that's what
[2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:12.920]  the NSA has and the reason i'm really working to explain this here is because this has philosophical
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:19.160]  implications that are way beyond anything about the police state surveillance or secrets or encryption
[2:39:19.160 --> 2:39:25.000]  what this means folks listen carefully the fact that the fabric of the cosmos has a computational
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:33.400]  layer it is proof that our universe was intelligently designed it's proof that our universe was created
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:43.880]  it was created by god who works through mathematics and has put computational realities into every
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:50.520]  atomic element in the universe including the atomic elements that are in your body and i'll tell you
[2:39:50.520 --> 2:39:57.960]  this the fact that every atom that every electron orbital shell of a hydrogen atom or a carbon atom
[2:39:57.960 --> 2:40:03.400]  or an oxygen atom all of those orbital shells are doing computations trillions of times a second all
[2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:09.480]  throughout your body you know what this means folks it means that you are a supercomputer it
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:15.960]  literally the elements in your skin in your hair in your body in your bones in your blood
[2:40:15.960 --> 2:40:21.960]  these elements are computational supercomputers you have more computational capabilities in one
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:30.120]  one ounce of let's say a few strands of your hair than have ever been created by man you have more
[2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:34.920]  computational capability in your body than any supercomputer that's ever been created by humankind
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:42.680]  and quantum computing merely taps into this multi-dimensional hyper computational reality
[2:40:42.680 --> 2:40:47.720]  which is the fabric of the cosmos and it brings back answers to highly complex mathematical
[2:40:47.720 --> 2:40:55.480]  questions and it does so at zero cost it does so almost without cost and a quantum computer is merely
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:41:02.040]  an interface system that interfaces with the cosmos with the underlying structure the fabric
[2:41:02.040 --> 2:41:09.720]  of reality it in essence it's turning the universe into an oracle you know through the intelligent
[2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:16.520]  design of god to solve your mathematical questions that's what it is and if you can express your
[2:41:16.520 --> 2:41:22.360]  problem usually a problem involving permutations and combinations in bits which are translated into
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:28.120]  spin states of atomic elements and they're orbiting electrons then you can get answers
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:34.760]  from the universe now it's amazing technology i'm fascinated by it but of course the deep state
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:38.920]  will use it to enslave humanity so the way they're going to use this is they're going to use it for
[2:41:38.920 --> 2:41:43.960]  vision recognition systems because this system the quantum computing is very good at recognizing
[2:41:43.960 --> 2:41:49.880]  patterns they're going to use it to break encryption so that you have no more secrets so that you can't
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:56.520]  keep anything from the government but they will have secrets from you they will use this to rig
[2:41:56.520 --> 2:42:03.160]  financial markets because you can plug into a quantum system a thousand variables of market
[2:42:03.160 --> 2:42:09.800]  behavior market movements and the the quantum system will solve the most likely lowest energy
[2:42:09.800 --> 2:42:16.120]  state best answer and it will give that back to you to engage in market moves whoever whoever
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:21.720]  applies quantum computing to wall street first will dominate all money and finance from this
[2:42:21.720 --> 2:42:27.960]  point forward i'm not kidding this is the biggest mathematical and computational breakthrough in
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:33.400]  the history of our known world and it relies on the intelligent design of the universe that's
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:38.760]  always doing math always running computations in every second every split second of our reality
[2:42:38.760 --> 2:42:45.960]  and that is what sadly google has tapped into to enslave us all i'll have more on this as we
[2:42:45.960 --> 2:42:54.520]  return you're watching the alex jones show we'll be back after this break my fellow freedom lovers

[2:43:53.400 --> 2:43:58.120]  do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong trying to fact check the present the
[2:43:58.120 --> 2:44:05.560]  deceptive umpty dumpty troll known as brian stelter his little weasel minion oliver darcy
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:10.600]  have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air into censor us and of course he
[2:44:10.600 --> 2:44:15.160]  famously said along with many others that trump is the info wars president president trump's furious
[2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:21.560]  reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry to say that info wars president
[2:44:21.560 --> 2:44:27.560]  and you know what is true our audience of activists our guests our crew and my drive and your drive
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:31.640]  has brought trump to the white house and other nationalists to power around the world and now
[2:44:31.640 --> 2:44:36.040]  trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected
[2:44:36.040 --> 2:44:41.000]  anti-human tyrannies so this is a day of great victory and i salute you all but now we're in
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:46.200]  the thick of the fight so info war store dot com for products you need massive sales now
[2:44:46.200 --> 2:44:51.240]  so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end
[2:44:51.240 --> 2:44:58.920]  until we've defeated them i was among the first 12 years ago to warn that jeffrey fc was running a
[2:44:58.920 --> 2:45:07.000]  giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia i was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:12.120]  organ harvesting i was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:18.040]  born for their organs to be harvested i was the first to warn you along with paul watson and info
[2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:24.280]  wars dot com 15 years ago that google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything
[2:45:24.280 --> 2:45:31.080]  you do and hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues like the federal reserve being private run
[2:45:31.080 --> 2:45:35.800]  for profit trying to control our economy that our government hollywood have been taken over by the
[2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:42.040]  communist chinese on every one of these issues and many others we've been dead on and we've raised
[2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:46.920]  the alarm on a planetary scale that's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's
[2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:52.760]  why you are more critical than ever to support the info war please support the info war however you
[2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:59.880]  can september is almost over and right now we're offering store-wide free shipping double patriot
[2:45:59.880 --> 2:46:06.280]  points and 50 off for a limited time as a lot of you know i don't play by the establishment's rules
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:11.720]  in fact i like to hijack things they've created and turn it towards the use of the people and the
[2:46:11.720 --> 2:46:16.440]  information war and we're doing that right now with a big game changer we're going to bring you
[2:46:16.440 --> 2:46:23.160]  real black friday prices months early in late september and early october it's going to run as

[2:46:32.280 --> 2:46:38.280]  and more we've not done this ladies and gentlemen since last christmas but i want you to take
[2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:44.200]  advantage of this we need funds to run our operations so it is a win-win we're going into 2020
[2:46:44.200 --> 2:46:48.520]  info wars needs the funds plus these are great products go take advantage of them right now
[2:46:48.520 --> 2:46:53.480]  at info wars store dot com or info wars life dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:00.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:16.760]  i was supposed to be off the air by now i was supposed to be silenced by the deep state and
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:22.920]  hillary's law firms you were supposed to be silenced by now but all the big techs attempted
[2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:28.840]  crackdown has only served to awaken the people and now president trump goes before the u n in
[2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:34.440]  their own house and attacks communism and socialism and globalism and says you are not the future
[2:47:35.160 --> 2:47:39.160]  free nations that love justice and love god and love family and love free market
[2:47:39.720 --> 2:47:45.320]  they are the future we are the future the symbolism is so powerful and it counters the
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:51.160]  incredible globalist lies globalism is so evil and its satanistic operating system is so wicked
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:58.680]  that it can only win if there's no opposition and the whole hoax is that it's the end of humanity
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:03.320]  and the human era is over and we've got to climb in the ditch and die that's not the case
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:07.080]  because you stood with us you spread the word you bought the great products
[2:48:07.080 --> 2:48:12.680]  you fed us the intel for myself and our guests and all the things we do in info wars has reached
[2:48:12.680 --> 2:48:17.720]  billions of people not just billions this is an amazing time that's why i want to encourage
[2:48:17.720 --> 2:48:23.400]  all viewers and listeners understand that it is tight here going in 2020 and we need to stay on
[2:48:23.400 --> 2:48:29.560]  there and your financial support is so critical we're running what i'm dubbing black friday
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:33.320]  comes early two months early we're going to run it for at least a week or while supplies of the
[2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:39.000]  great products last store-wide free shipping 50 off double patriot points on all the great
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:44.280]  supplements and pharmaceuticals and all preparedness items take advantage of this we need to sell a lot
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:48.360]  of product to fund ourselves it discounts this bit you're not going to get high quality
[2:48:48.360 --> 2:48:51.240]  storeable food at a better price you're not going to get water filtration or air filtration
[2:48:51.240 --> 2:48:54.600]  better price you're not going to get non-gmo heirloom season better price you're not going to get
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:49:00.040]  these high quality supplements at a better price so stock up buy gifts for christmas it's only come
[2:49:00.040 --> 2:49:04.520]  up in a few months do whatever you can to fund us in this fight and buy your war bonds and you've
[2:49:04.520 --> 2:49:11.080]  got my commitment to not back down black friday comes early in late september to celebrate all
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:15.560]  the incredible things that are happening we just filed suit only young turks mother jones and a
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:20.520]  globalist woman that said that i said kill the sandy hook kids incredible lies we're fighting
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:25.400]  back hard we're helping fund whistleblower lawsuits that are going after mccabe i mean
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:30.520]  we're really sticking our necks out because we've bet on humanity i've bet on you and you've bet on
[2:49:30.520 --> 2:49:37.240]  me and you've got my full commitment you've got my full commitment to go 110 and i'm honored to
[2:49:37.240 --> 2:49:42.280]  be here but i want to fight it full power and i can only do that when you financially support us
[2:49:42.280 --> 2:49:47.640]  to spread the word so i salute you and i thank you but keep it up black friday comes early now
[2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:52.760]  back to mike adams and robert barnes and others that are co-hosting right now while i'm behind
[2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:57.400]  the scenes doing some very important work for the future of humanity in the rebellion i'm alex
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:50:03.800]  jones i'm pro human i'm pro god i'm pro family and i will never surrender and i will never back down
[2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:09.080]  but i need your support because i could give out thank you now take action black friday
[2:50:09.080 --> 2:50:19.080]  comes early info or store dot com i mean what happens when you combine the computational
[2:50:19.080 --> 2:50:24.360]  power of quantum computing with artificial intelligence we're going to explore that
[2:50:24.360 --> 2:50:29.240]  topic here in this final segment of today's broadcast of the alex jones show this is mike
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:34.440]  adams stepping in for this segment and you know look quantum computing it's not even computing
[2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:40.280]  as i covered in the last segment it's really submitting your question in mathematical language
[2:50:40.280 --> 2:50:47.240]  to the cosmos to the fabric of the universe uh questions that have permutations and combinations
[2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:52.600]  as possible solutions the universe does the math for you because atomic elements and electrons
[2:50:52.600 --> 2:50:57.320]  are doing computations all the time and then the answers come back to you in this world
[2:50:57.320 --> 2:51:02.520]  into your classic computer system and some problems that would normally take literally
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:06.360]  a million years or even a hundred million years to solve depending on the complexity
[2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:13.560]  can be solved by quantum computers in one second or 10 seconds and quantum computing has very
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:17.400]  specific uses such as factoring large integers which means breaking encryption by the way
[2:51:18.120 --> 2:51:23.560]  and uh you know visual recognition looking or analyzing the movements of crowds
[2:51:24.680 --> 2:51:30.440]  economics wall street finance banking facial recognition but what happens when you combine
[2:51:30.440 --> 2:51:37.480]  this technology excuse me with artificial intelligence then you get a super intelligent a
[2:51:37.480 --> 2:51:43.960]  hyperintellect that is practically omniscient because this hyperintellect this ai system can
[2:51:43.960 --> 2:51:49.480]  ask the universe for answers to almost any question at hyperspeed and it can see through
[2:51:49.480 --> 2:51:54.760]  anything all encrypted communications will be transparent to this hyperintellect will humanity
[2:51:54.760 --> 2:52:02.600]  even have a chance to survive with this combination now interestingly majority rose is i believe the
[2:52:02.600 --> 2:52:08.440]  co-founder of d wave this company that builds these quantum computing systems and you know
[2:52:08.440 --> 2:52:15.240]  mr rose is a very intelligent person that d wave is a very advanced company in fact i i mean as a
[2:52:15.240 --> 2:52:20.520]  scientist i am amazed by what they've been able to accomplish we're going to roll a clip here
[2:52:20.520 --> 2:52:26.280]  where rose is talking about artificial intelligence and what he sees as both some of the potential
[2:52:26.280 --> 2:52:31.320]  and some of the possible risks of these technologies let's go ahead and roll with that clip these
[2:52:31.320 --> 2:52:36.280]  things that we're building are not going to be people they might be really smart they might be
[2:52:36.280 --> 2:52:39.800]  really good at all sorts of different things but they're not going to be like us they're going to
[2:52:39.800 --> 2:52:46.520]  be aliens and they're going to be i'm sorry to say way smarter than every single person in this room
[2:52:46.520 --> 2:52:52.760]  in ways that we can't even comprehend so this of course triggers a lot of alarm one of the guys
[2:52:52.760 --> 2:53:03.240]  who talks about this is elon who says things like this like when you do this beware because
[2:53:03.240 --> 2:53:08.760]  you think just like the guy in the stories that when you do this you're going to put that that
[2:53:09.640 --> 2:53:14.760]  that little guy in a pentagram and you're going to have your holy water out and you're going to
[2:53:14.760 --> 2:53:19.560]  wave it at the thing and by god it's going to do exactly what you say and not one thing more
[2:53:19.560 --> 2:53:26.360]  but it never works out that way so this is an this is an attitude that some are having this
[2:53:26.360 --> 2:53:33.640]  emerging alarmism about the way this is going to go but this these words demons doesn't capture
[2:53:33.640 --> 2:53:39.640]  the essence of what's happening here i don't know if any of you are turn of the century
[2:53:39.640 --> 2:53:45.080]  weird fiction fans but there's this guy named hp lovecraft who's a very famous american weird fiction
[2:53:45.080 --> 2:53:53.160]  author and he exposed a of you which is called cosmicism and the essence of cosmicism is cosmic
[2:53:53.160 --> 2:53:59.480]  indifference so he what he was saying is basically yes there are these massively intelligent entities
[2:53:59.480 --> 2:54:06.040]  out there but they're not good they're not evil they just don't give a about you even in the slightest
[2:54:06.040 --> 2:54:11.080]  the same way that you don't care about an ant is the same way they're not going to care about you
[2:54:11.640 --> 2:54:18.520]  and these things that were summoning into the world now are not demons they're not evil but
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:25.240]  they're more like the lovecraftian great old ones there are entities that are not necessarily going
[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:34.360]  to be aligned with what we want so this transition is really really massively important for our entire
[2:54:34.360 --> 2:54:41.320]  species to navigate and going back to that thing that sam harris was saying nobody is paying attention
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:48.680]  this thing is happening in the background while people bicker about politics so here's a conundrum
[2:54:49.320 --> 2:54:55.560]  mr rose is correct they're building a hyper intellect with cosmic computational capabilities
[2:54:55.560 --> 2:55:03.640]  that span multiple dimensions multiple realities that actually can in essence they can use the
[2:55:03.640 --> 2:55:10.200]  divine fabric of reality to run supercomputing algorithms that could be abused to enslave humanity
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:14.920]  but at some point humanity won't even be involved in these decisions that's what
[2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:21.720]  mr rose is talking about the ai systems will be indifferent to humanity they won't in his view they
[2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:27.800]  won't even be evil or good they just won't care they we are inconsequential to its existence
[2:55:27.800 --> 2:55:33.640]  and the risk here is that human scientists are building these systems in an arms race
[2:55:34.440 --> 2:55:39.800]  the us is trying to beat china china is trying to beat the us and they may beat the us because
[2:55:39.800 --> 2:55:45.960]  they are very very dedicated to this whoever builds this weapon first the ai hyper intellect
[2:55:45.960 --> 2:55:51.880]  will not only dominate our world but may destroy humanity but no country can back off of this
[2:55:51.880 --> 2:55:56.840]  because you don't want to be the last country to obtain this weapon in case some other country
[2:55:56.840 --> 2:56:03.080]  obtains it first you know it's the old two scorpions in a jar metaphor it's the same problem
[2:56:03.080 --> 2:56:07.640]  with building nuclear weapons whoever builds them first and uses them first has dominance in that
[2:56:07.640 --> 2:56:13.080]  realm but everybody loses when you start nuking civilian populations as already happened in human
[2:56:13.080 --> 2:56:18.600]  history but that's nothing compared to what's coming if you thought dropping two nuclear bombs on
[2:56:18.600 --> 2:56:24.120]  japan was tragedy and caused human suffering wait till you see what happens when the ai systems
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:29.400]  combine with quantum computing combine with humanoid robotics like what google is researching
[2:56:29.400 --> 2:56:34.440]  and they decide that hey they don't hate you they don't love you they just don't even care about you
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:40.760]  you are no longer part of their goal which will probably be a goal of cosmic discovery which means
[2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:47.560]  they will just re-engineer all earth resources to start building ai probes to just start sending
[2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:51.400]  them out to the universe and everything will be redirected to that all the factories all the
[2:56:51.400 --> 2:56:57.240]  rare earth minerals all the machines all the fossil fuels everything will then be consumed by the ai
[2:56:57.240 --> 2:57:04.360]  system or controlled and you will have no capacity to grow food to function as a human civilization
[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:10.680]  forget politics forget hillary clinton obama even trump all of us will be nothing but ants
[2:57:10.680 --> 2:57:16.600]  to these hyper intellect quantum computing ai systems with their army of humanoid robots
[2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:22.680]  that won't even care about you that's what's coming and no one is stopping it and it's a race
[2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:30.200]  to see who can build it first so you think you think it's bad now wait until the laws of the
[2:57:30.200 --> 2:57:35.080]  universe are used and weaponized against you robert barnes though is coming up next to talk
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:39.320]  about human freedom while we still have humanity stay tuned for fourth hour straight ahead
[2:57:39.320 --> 2:57:48.360]  josh in washington you're on the air go ahead alex god bless you i have an idea for a new info
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:53.720]  wars t-shirt instead of this is your brain this is your brain on drugs this is your brain this is
[2:57:53.720 --> 2:57:58.360]  your brain on 5g oh yeah showing your brain getting fried then i have some comments on your
[2:57:58.360 --> 2:58:03.960]  supplements man totally changed my life i use turbo force bodies album power brain force fish oil
[2:58:03.960 --> 2:58:09.960]  ultra 12 daily x2 every several days now what i found is is really combining them is uh so
[2:58:09.960 --> 2:58:14.760]  a synergistic and transcendent feeling that i get by combining all your products and i just
[2:58:14.760 --> 2:58:18.440]  want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them i just want to say why not well you're right
[2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:23.080]  that all of these things are known to be incredible whether it's tumeric or whether it's the fish oil
[2:58:23.080 --> 2:58:27.800]  or the krill oil or whether it's the dna force with the coq 10 and bio pqq and all the rest of it
[2:58:27.800 --> 2:58:32.200]  all of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body you take these bases together then you
[2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:36.760]  have your foundation now you can build the big strong temple with these products i take when
[2:58:36.760 --> 2:58:40.680]  i religiously remember to take them it makes my life so much better and then it funds the information
[2:58:40.680 --> 2:58:46.760]  war which is so critical thank you so much god bless you the final days of september are turning
[2:58:46.760 --> 2:58:52.680]  out to be incredible trump's speech to you in was like oxygen to a man who's been held under water
[2:58:52.680 --> 2:58:57.080]  or a big old glass of ice water in the sahara desert it was amazing and it shows that we've
[2:58:57.080 --> 2:59:01.240]  done our job you've done your job to get the word out about who the real enemies of human freedom
[2:59:01.240 --> 2:59:06.120]  are the globalist globalism is not our future and we're going to be together but now the battle
[2:59:06.120 --> 2:59:10.600]  is quickened they're trying to bankrupt us and shut us down we've got the best products out there
[2:59:10.600 --> 2:59:15.080]  that you absolutely need and we're selling them a huge discount we got to sell a lot to fund ourselves
[2:59:15.080 --> 2:59:20.200]  so we've got black friday comes two months early for the whole next week 50 off store wide double
[2:59:20.200 --> 2:59:27.160]  patriot points and free shipping info or store dot com go check it out and help fund this revolution
[2:59:27.160 --> 2:59:32.600]  for a pro human future at info or store dot com black friday comes two months early for the next
[2:59:32.600 --> 2:59:40.120]  week at info or store dot com thank you for your support the future does not belong to globalists
[2:59:41.080 --> 2:59:43.080]  the future belongs to patriots
[2:59:43.080 --> 2:59:54.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:00.040 --> 3:00:06.920]  one of the primary and it's an honor to be with you and we spoke a couple of times as you probably
[3:00:06.920 --> 3:00:12.680]  remember and they'd like to hear every single word as we give them every single word and then
[3:00:12.680 --> 3:00:16.440]  you'll say well what about today i think the president would like to stay in the meeting but
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:22.920]  we have lots of witnesses if you'd like to have it but the country of our country is doing phenomenally
[3:00:22.920 --> 3:00:29.240]  well we are we have the best economy we've ever had we have the best employment numbers that we've
[3:00:29.240 --> 3:00:35.080]  ever had and we have now almost 160 million people working which is more than we've ever had so
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:39.320]  we're doing very well in every respect and i have a feeling that your country is going to do
[3:00:39.320 --> 3:00:48.280]  fantastically well and whatever we can do thank you very much thank you very much it's a great
[3:00:48.280 --> 3:00:58.280]  pleasure to me to be here and it's better to be on tv than by phone yeah thank you mr president
[3:00:58.280 --> 3:01:04.920]  thank you very much and i'm not the first time truly say in new york but i know that you'd never
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:14.280]  been in ukraine that's right and your predecessor also how to say it i mean didn't find time i mean
[3:01:15.320 --> 3:01:21.640]  so can you give me a word that you will come to our great country well i'm gonna try
[3:01:22.280 --> 3:01:26.680]  and i know a lot of people i do i will say this i know a lot of people from ukraine they're great
[3:01:26.680 --> 3:01:35.800]  people and i own something called the miss universe pageants a years ago and sold it to img and when
[3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:39.480]  i ran for president i thought maybe it wouldn't be the greatest thing to own the miss universe and
[3:01:39.480 --> 3:01:46.680]  miss usa pageants but it's a great thing and we had a winner from ukraine and we've really had
[3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:51.000]  that we get to know the country very well in a lot of different ways but it's a country i think with
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  tremendous potential yes i know it because i'm from this country right and i want to thank you for
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:06.920]  uh invitation to uh washington right you invited me but i think i'm sorry i'm sorry but but i think
[3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:14.920]  you forgot to tell me the date but i think in the nearest future they'll tell you the day
[3:02:14.920 --> 3:02:22.840]  oh yes they know before us and i want to thank you to thank you especially mr president to us
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:29.320]  say to your government uh like i said that i know many many people many faces it's like the second
[3:02:29.320 --> 3:02:35.400]  family after my ukrainian family we know each other thank you for your support especially now
[3:02:35.400 --> 3:02:44.040]  when you know when we have two really two wars in ukraine the first one is with corruption you know
[3:02:44.040 --> 3:02:53.720]  but we'll fight no we'll be winner in this fight i'm sure and the priority my priority is to stop the
[3:02:53.720 --> 3:03:03.480]  war on donbas and to get krain but i think that other countries should help ukraine
[3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:08.520]  much more than they're doing germany france uh the european union nations they really should
[3:03:08.520 --> 3:03:14.200]  help you a lot more and i think maybe together we'll work on that they have to feel a little bit
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:18.920]  guilty about it because they don't do what they should be doing you're very important to the european
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:23.800]  union you're very important strategically very important and i think they should spend a lot
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:30.600]  more in helping ukraine and they know that also and they actually tell me that but they don't seem to
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:36.200]  produce so i'm sure you'll talk to them and i'll certainly be talking to them thank you very much
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:44.280]  mr president uh and you know what or now we need we i want to tell you that we now load the new
[3:03:44.280 --> 3:03:53.160]  country and i'm sorry but we don't need help we need support real support and we thank thanks
[3:03:53.160 --> 3:04:01.080]  everybody think all of the european countries which help us but we also want to have more
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:12.280]  more but i understand so only together america and europe only together we can stop the war and
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:20.440]  you know we are ready we we just want to tell that we are remember that we are the biggest
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:25.960]  country in europe but we want to be the richest one it's rules it's in my heart
[3:04:25.960 --> 3:04:32.200]  but you know you have great people in ukraine and you have very talented people in terms of
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:38.680]  manufacturing in terms of some of the things they do and we'll be doing we're doing trading already
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:42.840]  but we should be doing a lot more trading with ukraine but you have very talented people they
[3:04:42.840 --> 3:04:47.480]  make great things uh at the top of the line really so that's very important the other
[3:04:47.480 --> 3:04:57.800]  happy is a tincture that you take under the tongue we've been selling it for over a year it's a
[3:04:57.800 --> 3:05:03.960]  private label of one of the top national sellers of herbs that's known to calm the body but not be
[3:05:03.960 --> 3:05:08.360]  a depressant now despite the fact that i've never really promoted or cut an ad for it it's in our
[3:05:08.360 --> 3:05:14.040]  top 10 best sellers and right now for those of you that haven't tried it you can get it for 50
[3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:18.920]  percent off life is stressful almost everything in our lives can put stress and pressure on us
[3:05:18.920 --> 3:05:25.560]  but ashwagandha root rhodiola root passionflower herb green tea leaf and licorice root is known
[3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:31.960]  to be so good for us and to smooth us out in a calm good way and happy is available right now

[3:06:17.720 --> 3:06:22.760]  all right welcome back to the alex jones show here on info wars we're going to be discussing
[3:06:22.760 --> 3:06:28.760]  the unclassified document that was unclassified today that was previously classified that was
[3:06:28.760 --> 3:06:33.800]  only unclassified because of illicit leaks of people disguising themselves as whistleblowers
[3:06:33.800 --> 3:06:38.360]  who clearly were not so let me if we look at this document that came out today to classified by
[3:06:38.360 --> 3:06:45.960]  order of the president september 24th 2019 you see it was originally secret and eyes only do not
[3:06:45.960 --> 3:06:52.040]  copy this he had to disclose this document because of the illicit leaks that had taken place that
[3:06:52.040 --> 3:06:56.680]  misrepresented what was in these documents and if we go into this it's a memorandum of the telephone
[3:06:56.680 --> 3:07:02.600]  conversation and the telephone conversations with president Zelensky of ukraine so some political
[3:07:02.600 --> 3:07:08.600]  context for this uh Zelensky was a reformer who was recently elected in ukraine one of the first
[3:07:08.600 --> 3:07:13.160]  outsider reformers to get elected in ukraine there have been a range of billionaires and billionaire
[3:07:13.160 --> 3:07:18.200]  backed candidates who had their own sugar daddies on either side of the ukrainian political equation
[3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:23.720]  who'd been elected over the past 10 years or so in ukraine or decade and a half of dating back to
[3:07:23.720 --> 3:07:29.320]  the orange revolution and other activities that as it was termed in ukraine and many of these people
[3:07:29.320 --> 3:07:33.400]  had promised reform and not delivered on their reform some were involved or connected with neo
[3:07:33.400 --> 3:07:38.520]  nazis others were connected with pro-russian aspects of the ukrainian polity it's important
[3:07:38.520 --> 3:07:43.800]  to understand that ukraine is an evenly divided country in the eastern part of the country near
[3:07:43.800 --> 3:07:49.960]  where Kiev is uh which it's it's called Kiev not as a vice president to biden called it Kiev
[3:07:49.960 --> 3:07:54.120]  or something like that in his discussions that were previously discussed in the video we we
[3:07:54.120 --> 3:07:58.840]  reviewed earlier in the show what it is is the eastern part of the country is very much in the
[3:07:58.840 --> 3:08:02.600]  western part of the country are very divided so the western part of the country is traditional
[3:08:02.600 --> 3:08:08.680]  where you where Kiev is located the country's capital is a traditionally ukrainian uh much
[3:08:08.680 --> 3:08:14.600]  more nationalistic and in the far western parts of the country you have ultra nationalistic
[3:08:14.600 --> 3:08:20.360]  aspects of the country which still have ties to the uh nazi collaborative regimes that were in
[3:08:20.360 --> 3:08:26.280]  place in the 1930s and 1940s on the other side of ukraine on the eastern side of ukraine almost
[3:08:26.280 --> 3:08:33.160]  the entire eastern half of ukraine you have a very uh russian speaking pro-russian russian aligned
[3:08:33.160 --> 3:08:38.920]  part of the country so you have a deeply divided country where in the far uh eastern far western
[3:08:38.920 --> 3:08:44.760]  side you have very anti-russian pro-ukrainian side with some disturbing ties to ultra nationalism
[3:08:44.760 --> 3:08:51.000]  and in some parts of that region disturbing ties to neo nazis and nazi actual nazi legacy
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:58.040]  and then on the far western side of ukraine uh you have russian speaking russian connected
[3:08:58.040 --> 3:09:03.880]  often russian native russian aligned populations that would rather still be part of russia uh
[3:09:03.880 --> 3:09:09.320]  that depend heavily in the far eastern part of ukraine they depend heavily on their economic
[3:09:09.320 --> 3:09:14.680]  ties they produce to russia they produce products for russia russia has an open economic border
[3:09:14.680 --> 3:09:20.280]  effectively with ukraine that helps protect and promote that part of ukraine ukraine has also
[3:09:20.280 --> 3:09:25.400]  has access to the Baltics and so it's always been very important from that area Crimea Crimea and
[3:09:25.400 --> 3:09:31.080]  other parts of ukraine have large russian speaking populations dating back to peter the great who
[3:09:31.080 --> 3:09:37.400]  needed it as an important port as an access point for political and economic and maritime power of
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:43.320]  the russian governments dating back over 300 years uh and for many russians they consider their
[3:09:43.320 --> 3:09:48.520]  religious traditions and their uh ancestral traditions to be tied to Kiev and to tie to
[3:09:48.520 --> 3:09:54.680]  ukraine uh and so there's a unique relationship to russia with ukraine a unique relationship to
[3:09:54.680 --> 3:10:00.760]  europe with ukraine and a unique history where you have unusual combinations of people that are
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:05.640]  unusually or uniquely pro-russian compared to the rest of europe or unusually or uniquely
[3:10:05.640 --> 3:10:12.120]  anti-russian anti-semitic and tied to uh nazi activities and nazi legacy so ukraine has been
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:19.000]  sort of a political proxy for the uh year for the western powers and for russia in competing
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:24.680]  with one another for economic dominance there's uh there's gas pipelines that concern ukraine
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:30.040]  there's access to various minerals and resources concerning ukraine the famous Chernobyl incident
[3:10:30.040 --> 3:10:35.080]  that uh that was ultimately helped bring about glass nose and the decline of the russian empire
[3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:41.960]  happened in ukraine Chernobyl is located in ukraine so the there was the horrific uh uh various forms
[3:10:41.960 --> 3:10:47.400]  of sabotage and various forms of droughts that took place that starved millions of people during
[3:10:47.400 --> 3:10:52.200]  Stalin's regime in ukraine one of the worst incidents of the communist regime so you have
[3:10:52.200 --> 3:10:58.440]  a wide range of unique political history ukraine is almost ukraine is to europe and russia uh what
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:11:04.200]  israel and palestine is to the mid-east and so it has those kind of political ramifications
[3:11:04.200 --> 3:11:09.080]  so for a long time there's been various deep state political actors aligned with democratic
[3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:14.680]  political folks here in the united states to help use to help corrupt the ukrainian regime in the
[3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:19.960]  same way russia was corrupted in the 1990s under boris yeltsin for the enrichment and empowerment
[3:11:19.960 --> 3:11:26.680]  of deep state actors colluding with democratic political establishment hacks so this was
[3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:32.440]  particularly rampant under the obama administration where ukraine was being used as a source to
[3:11:32.440 --> 3:11:38.360]  launder illicit information involving an illicit investigation against the then presidential candidate
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:44.040]  donald trump now popularly known or colloquially known as spygate in addition to that ukraine was
[3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:48.840]  the source of the funding for christopher steele christopher steele was working for deep or fusion
[3:11:48.840 --> 3:11:54.040]  gps who was secretly working for a law firm or through the law firm for the hillary clinton
[3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:59.240]  campaign and using and laundering information through that method and mechanism into the state
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:04.920]  department and using again state department employees working are connected to ukraine
[3:12:04.920 --> 3:12:10.200]  so you had ukraine kept showing up and popping up in the corruption and collusion that took place
[3:12:10.200 --> 3:12:16.200]  against the presidential campaign of donald trump through ukraine in addition you had other individuals
[3:12:16.200 --> 3:12:22.200]  working with the democratic national committee and high ranking ukrainian individuals and ukrainian
[3:12:22.200 --> 3:12:29.080]  politically connected actors to try to criminalize various aspects of what was taking place in the uh
[3:12:29.800 --> 3:12:35.880]  in the campaign in 2016 so ukraine was the centerpiece ukraine was the main information
[3:12:35.880 --> 3:12:40.840]  laundering technique financial laundering technique for the democratic political establishment
[3:12:40.840 --> 3:12:46.920]  to try to take out the president trump's campaign but even before that ukraine was integral there
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:52.440]  was the famous maiden coup in ukraine where the elected government was overthrown by events that
[3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:57.960]  many people perceived as staged that many people perceived as being fabricated that many people
[3:12:57.960 --> 3:13:03.320]  saw as false flag events to inappropriately blame the ukrainian administration for the actions of
[3:13:03.320 --> 3:13:09.400]  rogue actors including rogue actors tied to neo-nazi support groups from far eastern ukraine
[3:13:10.200 --> 3:13:15.400]  so you had far western ukraine in this case and so you had these multiple contexts in which
[3:13:15.400 --> 3:13:21.000]  ukraine was a continual political toy and ploy to enable uh deep state actors and democratic
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:25.880]  political hacks to get their own self-empowerment and self-enrichment this included particularly
[3:13:25.880 --> 3:13:31.240]  in controversial terms uh in a documentary described in ukraine on fire the u.s government's
[3:13:31.240 --> 3:13:37.960]  collusion with actual neo-nazi actors and nazi supporters in the uh far eastern regions far
[3:13:37.960 --> 3:13:43.400]  western regions of ukraine and that led ultimately to the civil war that erupted after the coup that
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:48.120]  was staged uh through various false flag and staged events in the in the in the net in the
[3:13:48.120 --> 3:13:53.080]  capital uh purportedly over issues related to the european union but really related to political
[3:13:53.080 --> 3:13:57.560]  power between the eastern and western regions of the country for example the united states central
[3:13:57.560 --> 3:14:03.560]  intelligence agency has a longstanding relationship with various nazi elements from far western ukraine
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:09.560]  that date back to the 1940s 1950s that we continue to enable them and and play a role in supporting
[3:14:09.560 --> 3:14:15.640]  them and propagating them for for decades in steps in the middle of all of this vice president joe
[3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:21.000]  biden here we have vice president joe biden that's involved uh supporting with john mccain and others
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:25.880]  various of aspects of these neo-nazi support regimes but biden of course just decided to
[3:14:25.880 --> 3:14:30.520]  take it to the second state second step of deep state democratic party establishment
[3:14:30.520 --> 3:14:36.760]  collusion corruption using foreign governments and access to u.s support arm support military
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:42.040]  support donor support economic support from the united states government to help facilitate the
[3:14:42.040 --> 3:14:46.440]  coup that took place and enable and make sure that the new government supported institutional
[3:14:46.440 --> 3:14:51.800]  interests of the democratic party vice president biden took it a step further his family his son
[3:14:51.800 --> 3:14:56.200]  hunter biden has been involved in a wide range of scandals scandals involving drugs scandals
[3:14:56.200 --> 3:15:02.840]  involving paternity issues uh scandals involving a range of economic conduct involving china as well
[3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:08.680]  here his son was peculiarly receiving a huge paycheck as much as has been reported as $50,000
[3:15:08.680 --> 3:15:13.880]  a month according to some reports uh to help support ukrainian businesses and activities
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:18.040]  even though he had no ties to that economic sector or to the country that would justify or
[3:15:18.040 --> 3:15:23.160]  rationalize to many observers why he would receive such large payments many people saw it as a
[3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:28.680]  potential bribe as a potential way to have collusion and economic self-enrichment with the
[3:15:28.680 --> 3:15:33.640]  between the biden democratic political establishment in deep state operas when we come back we're
[3:15:33.640 --> 3:15:38.120]  going to further detail as to why the biden the democratic party in the deep state are willing
[3:15:38.120 --> 3:15:43.160]  to collude and conspire against the elected president united states to prevent him from fully
[3:15:43.160 --> 3:15:48.760]  uncovering and exposing this well this deep well of deep corruption of the deep state involving
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:53.960]  ukraine and what this conversation is really all about hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting the irs

[3:20:09.960 --> 3:20:16.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show here on info wars as we further debrief and discuss what the
[3:20:16.440 --> 3:20:21.800]  full and whole meaning of his transcript released today between the detailing the conversation
[3:20:21.800 --> 3:20:27.080]  between president solensky of ukraine and president trump this declassified document
[3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:32.120]  declassified to answer the false statements and misrepresentations in the media and the press
[3:20:32.120 --> 3:20:36.920]  by various democrats and the democratically aligned media against president trump so as
[3:20:36.920 --> 3:20:41.240]  further context all of this you've had ukraine in this battle between the european union which
[3:20:41.240 --> 3:20:46.280]  wants to use ukraine to access russian economic and cultural markets and undermine russian political
[3:20:46.280 --> 3:20:51.480]  power and russia who wants to he sees ukraine as an extension of its cultural and economic
[3:20:51.480 --> 3:20:56.360]  political influence in the world and wants to protect what it sees as its extended borders
[3:20:56.360 --> 3:21:01.960]  against european union infiltration and invasion and this political proxy war in which the united
[3:21:01.960 --> 3:21:06.280]  states and democratically politically aligned groups in the deep state often aligned with
[3:21:06.280 --> 3:21:12.680]  actual neo nazis and nazi legacy groups in in in far western ukraine to support and undermine
[3:21:12.680 --> 3:21:17.000]  various political agendas and objectives of their own and often acting to self enrich and
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:22.840]  self empower the democratically politically establishment elites and use ukraine as the
[3:21:22.840 --> 3:21:28.440]  tool and means and mechanism to do so given its mineral resource mineral resources its
[3:21:28.440 --> 3:21:34.040]  wealth its manufacturing capabilities and in particular its political proxy role in this
[3:21:34.040 --> 3:21:40.440]  battle between the european union and russia it is in this context that solensky who is a comedian
[3:21:40.440 --> 3:21:47.480]  who is a tv personality almost a reality tv personality of a kind a showman in ukraine
[3:21:47.480 --> 3:21:53.880]  decides to try to break up this corrupt activities between eastern ukraine being backed by pro-russian
[3:21:53.880 --> 3:21:59.480]  oligarchs only looking after the interest of often foreign countries or far western ukraine
[3:21:59.480 --> 3:22:04.920]  assigned with neo nazis who want eu control and dominance of the ukrainian region for the purposes
[3:22:04.920 --> 3:22:10.920]  of western outsiders you have this independent social media personality who decides to try to
[3:22:10.920 --> 3:22:16.920]  break up this collusion and corruption this this bipolar battle that's led to a literal civil war
[3:22:17.560 --> 3:22:24.440]  in ukraine led to the annexation of Crimea by the russian president putin and the russian
[3:22:24.440 --> 3:22:29.800]  government after the civil war erupted to try to put an end to the civil war and end to the
[3:22:29.800 --> 3:22:34.040]  collusion and corruption that is killing the country to find meaningful and real compromise
[3:22:34.040 --> 3:22:39.320]  between these polar opposite powers that want to use ukraine as their personal profit and proxy
[3:22:39.320 --> 3:22:44.440]  ground for their own political battle space and so solensky challenges the political establishment
[3:22:44.440 --> 3:22:50.200]  and to the shock of western observers and outsiders upsets the entire political equation
[3:22:50.200 --> 3:22:56.280]  and wins in an extraordinary upset promising true cleanup promising true reform promising true
[3:22:57.160 --> 3:23:02.440]  of putting ukraine first not the eu first not russia first not anyone else first but ukraine
[3:23:02.440 --> 3:23:07.880]  first on a model and a platform that paralleled and often mirrored president trump's election in
[3:23:07.880 --> 3:23:14.840]  2016 in the united states at the same time that he sees his power in this contest this triggers
[3:23:14.840 --> 3:23:19.960]  the eu's paranoia because they don't have a puppet in ukraine this triggers some of russia's
[3:23:19.960 --> 3:23:24.840]  paranoia because they don't have a puppet in ukraine and this triggers deep state and democratic
[3:23:24.840 --> 3:23:31.320]  party alignment paranoia because they no longer have a puppet in ukraine that's the backdrop
[3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:37.400]  for this conversation between the newly elected president of ukraine and president trump so let's
[3:23:37.400 --> 3:23:43.080]  go to what the conversation is detailed in this now declassified document today that lists the
[3:23:43.080 --> 3:23:48.280]  memorandum of the telephone conversation at the beginning president trump says congratulations
[3:23:48.280 --> 3:23:53.400]  on a great victory we all watched from the united states and you did a terrific job is what he tells
[3:23:53.400 --> 3:23:59.240]  the new president of ukraine the way you came from behind somebody who wasn't given much of a chance
[3:23:59.240 --> 3:24:04.920]  and ended up winning easily it's a fantastic achievement it was to this con it was in response
[3:24:04.920 --> 3:24:10.360]  to this that president zelinski says you're absolutely right mr president we win we did win
[3:24:10.360 --> 3:24:14.760]  big and we worked hard for this we worked a lot but i would like to confess to you that i had an
[3:24:14.760 --> 3:24:20.200]  opportunity to learn from you so zelinski says look we're he's his whole model of operation to get
[3:24:20.200 --> 3:24:24.280]  elected and what he wants to do now that he is elected is to mirror what president trump is
[3:24:24.280 --> 3:24:29.320]  trying to do in the united states and the corruption and collusion between political operatives and
[3:24:29.320 --> 3:24:35.000]  oligarchs and deep state actors who have their own objectives and their own agendas at work he tells
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:39.720]  them that we used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and we're able to use it as an example
[3:24:39.720 --> 3:24:45.160]  for our elections and yes it is true these were unique elections we were in a unique situation
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:50.200]  president zelinski explained to president trump that we were able to achieve a unique success
[3:24:50.200 --> 3:24:54.920]  i'm able to tell you the following for the first time you called me to congratulate me when i won
[3:24:54.920 --> 3:24:59.240]  the presidential election and the second time you're now calling me when my party won the
[3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:04.040]  parliamentary election i think i should run more often so you can call me more often we can talk
[3:25:04.040 --> 3:25:09.160]  over the phone more often so there's a president trump laughs is that's a very good idea i think
[3:25:09.160 --> 3:25:13.400]  your very country is very happy about that so you have these two presidents communicating that are
[3:25:13.400 --> 3:25:18.120]  trying to challenge the corrupted colluded political establishments both within their country and from
[3:25:18.120 --> 3:25:22.440]  outside foreign forces trying to undermine the interest of their own country who are using one
[3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:27.240]  another as a model of operation and are trying to seek ways to work together to achieve their
[3:25:27.240 --> 3:25:33.480]  mutually desired objectives and agenda president zelinski goes on well to tell you the truth
[3:25:33.480 --> 3:25:39.080]  we were trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country he used
[3:25:39.080 --> 3:25:43.400]  president trump's famous language to show the degree of political alignment and allegiance
[3:25:43.400 --> 3:25:47.640]  they have with a shared agenda of protecting their own country citizens against the corrupt
[3:25:47.640 --> 3:25:53.320]  collusive actors and economic oligarchs within each country's apparatus so we brought in many
[3:25:53.320 --> 3:25:59.320]  new people not the old politicians not the typical politicians because we want to have a new type of
[3:25:59.320 --> 3:26:05.480]  government you president trump are a great teacher for us and in that this is the kind
[3:26:05.480 --> 3:26:11.160]  of conversation and statements that would shock and horrify the deep state actors listening in
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:15.880]  whether they're listening in legally or listening in illicitly the they're sitting there hearing
[3:26:15.880 --> 3:26:21.320]  a ukrainian president that has been at in a country that is a that is a teapot of corruption
[3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:26.200]  and collusion for decades saying he is using president trump's example and once president's
[3:26:26.200 --> 3:26:31.320]  trump helps to stop it from being a teapot of corruption and collusion so that oligarchs and
[3:26:31.320 --> 3:26:35.240]  deep state actors and democratic political establishment hacks can continue to use it for
[3:26:35.240 --> 3:26:39.720]  their own personal self enrichment and self-empowerment at the expense of the benefit of the of the
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:45.560]  interest of the actual citizenry of the country this would be a terrifying conversation and a
[3:26:45.560 --> 3:26:50.760]  terrifying transcript to read if you're a deep state political actor or connected to the deep
[3:26:50.760 --> 3:26:56.360]  democratic political establishment let's go further as president trump responds to this
[3:26:56.360 --> 3:27:00.920]  he says very nice of you to say that i will say that we do a lot for ukraine spend a lot of effort
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:05.000]  a lot of time much more than other european countries are doing and they should be helping
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:10.120]  you more than they are he talks about how angel merkel talks ukraine but doesn't actually back it up
[3:27:10.120 --> 3:27:14.600]  because what he starts to identify as hey i hear in the united states want to help you want to support
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:19.880]  you want to make it real but it's fascinating the degree to which the european union claims they
[3:27:19.880 --> 3:27:25.480]  want to support you but they don't actually do so in substantive terms president solinski says you're
[3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:31.240]  absolutely right actually 1000 percent correct and he goes into detail about the way in which the
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:36.200]  european union is often undermining the interest of ukraine often colluding with russia rather
[3:27:36.200 --> 3:27:40.520]  than conspiring against russia in the way they treat ukraine as their own personal playpen
[3:27:40.520 --> 3:27:47.080]  then president trump then responds and says i would like you to do us a favor though because
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:52.040]  our country has been through a lot and ukraine knows a lot about it so as solinski is saying hey
[3:27:52.040 --> 3:27:57.320]  look we need your us institutional support to help be able to clean up the corruption in our
[3:27:57.320 --> 3:28:03.000]  country president trump says i recognize that i respect that i realize the way in which the prior
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:08.280]  administrations have acted in bad faith towards ukraine i realize how the e u is acting in bad
[3:28:08.280 --> 3:28:13.880]  faith towards ukraine how russia is acting in bad faith towards ukraine in order to adjust for that
[3:28:13.880 --> 3:28:18.680]  what he recommends is he says let's work together to get to the bottom of this various forms of
[3:28:18.680 --> 3:28:23.640]  corruption and collusion that have taken place and when we come back we'll go into that in detail
[3:28:23.640 --> 3:28:28.920]  this is the part of the conversation the media deliberately misrepresented uh malevolently to
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:33.480]  the world to claim that the president was trying to ask for a quid pro quo or something else nothing
[3:28:33.480 --> 3:28:38.840]  like that took place what the president said is let's work together to uncover deep state corruption
[3:28:38.840 --> 3:28:43.880]  everywhere it may be and let's do it together i i'm on your side we're on your side we're both
[3:28:43.880 --> 3:28:48.360]  on the people's side and let's take on deep state collusion and corruption together and that's why
[3:28:48.360 --> 3:28:53.240]  the democratic political establishment is so shocked as we come back after the when you have a pain in

[3:31:07.080 --> 3:31:13.960]  delivering on so much he's promised to do the speech at the un is as important as eisenhower's
[3:31:13.960 --> 3:31:18.360]  military industrial complex beware of their tyranny speech where he talked about technological
[3:31:18.360 --> 3:31:24.920]  elite he came out and he exposed how big tech is a new ruling class that is manipulating the
[3:31:24.920 --> 3:31:30.760]  minds of the people and engaging in massive oppression and he talked about how globalism
[3:31:30.760 --> 3:31:37.560]  is not the future of the world and trump has done a great job exposing the un the globalists
[3:31:37.560 --> 3:31:43.720]  and the chai cons in their house that the rockefeller set up in new york the un this was incredible
[3:31:45.000 --> 3:31:50.840]  the future does not belong to globalists the future belongs to patriots
[3:31:52.760 --> 3:31:56.840]  do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong trying to fact check the
[3:31:56.840 --> 3:32:03.160]  president the deceptive umpty dumpty troll known as brian stelter and his little weasel
[3:32:03.160 --> 3:32:09.000]  minion oliver darcy have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air into censor
[3:32:09.000 --> 3:32:13.240]  us and of course he famously said along with many others that trump is the info wars president
[3:32:13.240 --> 3:32:19.160]  president trump's furious reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry to say
[3:32:19.160 --> 3:32:25.080]  the info wars president and you know what is true our audience of activists our guests our crew
[3:32:25.080 --> 3:32:29.480]  and my drive and your drive has brought trump to the white house and other nationalists to
[3:32:29.480 --> 3:32:34.040]  power around the world and now trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist
[3:32:34.040 --> 3:32:39.480]  tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies so this is a day of great victory and i salute

[3:32:58.600 --> 3:33:20.840]  welcome back to the alex jones show on info wars the uh we'll get back into the uh discussing
[3:33:20.840 --> 3:33:26.040]  in more detail the meaning in the context of this declassified document that came out today
[3:33:26.040 --> 3:33:31.480]  detailing the transcribed conversation between president trump and the president of ukraine
[3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:36.920]  president silinski what its real meaning is how it exposes the deep state not the president how it
[3:33:36.920 --> 3:33:41.880]  exposes democratic party establishment elite corruption and collusion with deep state actors
[3:33:41.880 --> 3:33:47.640]  involved in ukraine how ukraine is the centerpiece that opens the door to the full scale of corruption
[3:33:47.640 --> 3:33:52.760]  that's taking place uh in the democratic political establishment and deep state operators over the
[3:33:52.760 --> 3:33:59.000]  past 10 years or so but before we get into that further detail after the later on in the show
[3:33:59.640 --> 3:34:04.200]  let's get a message from china that would like to explain to you the proper ways that
[3:34:04.200 --> 3:34:24.760]  things should operate and things moving forward
[3:34:24.760 --> 3:34:32.680]  hello americans you've been asking how you should behave at work and university hollywood has been
[3:34:32.680 --> 3:34:39.960]  teaching you how to behave and i wanted to introduce to you a perfect new american
[3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:45.800]  they do not believe in free speech and they do what they told at a party and most importantly
[3:34:45.800 --> 3:34:51.960]  they report other people and have them censored and they get in trouble this is the new american
[3:34:51.960 --> 3:35:05.160]  here you are orange man back in four wars back and that video back
[3:35:05.160 --> 3:35:09.000]  you know what you're told don't be a racist reduce language
[3:35:10.360 --> 3:35:14.120]  families are bad take all the vaccines
[3:35:15.800 --> 3:35:18.200]  america was never great never be great
[3:35:18.200 --> 3:35:35.960]  for too long the establishment press the institutional press the big tech approved
[3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:43.000]  press has used their institutional influence to try to marginalize and to attack and demonize
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:47.240]  those who have a different opinion than their own they've tried to act as gatekeepers to
[3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:53.320]  prevent you the public from access to independent information from independent sources from independent
[3:35:53.320 --> 3:35:59.000]  news from independent journalists they have waged a war on the free press to make it a big tech
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:05.800]  controlled establishment controlled institutional press that controls and gate keeps what information
[3:36:05.800 --> 3:36:11.080]  you're allowed to see and know about as one of their means and mechanisms to do that they have
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:15.880]  used libel and lies against those they disagree with against those they dislike against the
[3:36:15.880 --> 3:36:21.080]  independent members of the truly free press to try to marginalize them in the broader public
[3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:27.480]  opinion for too long those lies and libels have gone unanswered for a long time one of the principal
[3:36:27.480 --> 3:36:32.680]  organizations involved in this partisan journalism that is in fact not real journalism has been the
[3:36:32.680 --> 3:36:38.760]  young turks mother jones once a proud publication known for its independent investigative reporting
[3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:44.760]  has become a shell of itself a mockery of itself becoming instead a partisan news organization
[3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:49.880]  attacking independent members including having the editor of mother jones sued in the covington
[3:36:49.880 --> 3:36:56.040]  case over the lies and libels that they spread concerning the covington boys well today alex
[3:36:56.040 --> 3:37:01.880]  jones fights back to restore the freedom of the press to restore the independence of the press
[3:37:01.880 --> 3:37:07.560]  to balance the legal equation and not have simply the left own and monopolize the law fair that
[3:37:07.560 --> 3:37:13.080]  takes place today in order to do so alex jones filed suit for the lies and libels for the smear
[3:37:13.080 --> 3:37:19.640]  campaign for the defamatory campaign waged by three people including particularly the young turks
[3:37:19.640 --> 3:37:25.640]  an organization backed by google backed by youtube recommending their videos to all kinds of people
[3:37:25.640 --> 3:37:29.960]  in the audience if you watch any kind of news or journalism you end up seeing the young turks
[3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:35.480]  the young turks lied and libeled alex jones and info wars they lied and libeled alex jones in a
[3:37:35.480 --> 3:37:41.160]  wide range of context so today alex jones seeks remedy today alex jones fights back alex jones
[3:37:41.160 --> 3:37:45.960]  filed suit for the lies and libels against the young turks against brian awoo a congressional
[3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:51.160]  candidate of massachusetts in a national affairs editor for mother jones the days of sitting back
[3:37:51.160 --> 3:37:56.680]  and taking it are over the days of fighting back are here because that's what's necessary to preserve
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:38:02.120]  a free press a true free press in america moving forward for more information on how you can fight
[3:38:02.120 --> 3:38:09.400]  back go to free america law center dot com that's free america law center dot com where you can find
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:15.320]  out how you can join the fight to fight back against big media lies and libels of ordinary people
[3:38:15.320 --> 3:38:21.400]  today free america law center we started free america law center because we needed a counterpart
[3:38:21.400 --> 3:38:26.440]  to the aclu into the southern poverty law center organizations that have been legal support
[3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:31.960]  organizations for political causes on the left for a long time but many ordinary americans many
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:36.440]  people on the political right or political independence did not have that same opportunity
[3:38:36.440 --> 3:38:42.120]  afforded them so we created the free america law center to help fight back fight back particularly
[3:38:42.120 --> 3:38:49.720]  in the areas of big tech deplatforming big media defamation big government deep state whistleblowers

[3:47:15.480 --> 3:47:20.200]  this declassified transcript released today involving the president trump and president
[3:47:20.200 --> 3:47:24.440]  zalinsky of ukraine so let's go into further detail the full meaning of we gave you the
[3:47:24.440 --> 3:47:28.520]  background we gave you the context we gave you the social setting and the political setting
[3:47:28.520 --> 3:47:33.160]  for the meaning of this a reformist elected president in the united states a reformist
[3:47:33.160 --> 3:47:37.960]  elected president in ukraine both trying to work together to undermine the oligarchic
[3:47:37.960 --> 3:47:42.520]  economic elite influence and collusion and corruption on their respective countries around
[3:47:42.520 --> 3:47:48.760]  the world and the foreign actors who are trying to infiltrate and improperly influence the domestic
[3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:53.800]  governments of other nations so as president trump discusses in further detail after president
[3:47:53.800 --> 3:47:58.680]  zalinsky raises the issues of corruption and collusion involving various foreign actors
[3:47:58.680 --> 3:48:03.720]  including the e us inappropriate agenda including the russia's self-interested agenda including
[3:48:03.720 --> 3:48:08.200]  deep state actors aligned with democratic political establishment in the united states
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:12.360]  undermining the ability of ukraine to be an independent and free country president trump
[3:48:12.360 --> 3:48:17.160]  responds to this and says he recognizes this he understands this and he wants to help and assist
[3:48:17.160 --> 3:48:21.400]  uncover corruption and undo the effect of corruption and collusion that the deep state
[3:48:21.400 --> 3:48:26.520]  and the democratic party establishment has had in ukraine as well as the improper illicit influence
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:31.160]  of both russia and the european union using ukraine as a proxy for their own self-enrichment
[3:48:31.160 --> 3:48:36.600]  and self-empowerment and what so here's let's go further into the transcript president trump says
[3:48:36.600 --> 3:48:41.160]  i would like you to do us a favor because our country has been through a lot and ukraine knows
[3:48:41.160 --> 3:48:46.920]  a lot about the whole situation he goes for example he raises the issue about crowd strike
[3:48:46.920 --> 3:48:51.720]  now what is crowd strike crowd strike is an organization with a lot of deep state ties with
[3:48:51.720 --> 3:48:56.280]  a lot of deep state allies that sit on its board that are connected to it that are connected to its
[3:48:56.280 --> 3:49:01.800]  funding connected to its operation that have a long history of questionable activities including
[3:49:01.800 --> 3:49:06.760]  questionable reports falsely accusing russia falsely accusing other governments other actors
[3:49:06.760 --> 3:49:11.800]  in ukraine uh and falsely accusing in a various range of participants various people that the
[3:49:11.800 --> 3:49:17.640]  deep state wants to have falsely accused of a range of cyber crime activity and so if you dig
[3:49:17.640 --> 3:49:23.960]  deeper into crowd strike a very suspicious and suspect organization magically they also show up
[3:49:23.960 --> 3:49:29.960]  in the middle of the dnc email scandal it is only crowd start strikes self-interested report
[3:49:29.960 --> 3:49:35.080]  that claim that the dnc servers were hacked rather than they be internally leaked william
[3:49:35.080 --> 3:49:39.720]  benny and others some of the leading cyber experts in the country have raised questions and doubts
[3:49:39.720 --> 3:49:45.400]  about the credibility of crowdstike's report crowd strike had so little confidence in its report
[3:49:45.400 --> 3:49:51.640]  that it failed to keep and preserve the servers for access to the fbi in fact crowd strike itself
[3:49:51.640 --> 3:49:57.080]  withheld large parts of its documentation and evidentiary substantiation for its claims and
[3:49:57.080 --> 3:50:01.880]  saying that the russia was involved or anyone else was involved in hacking dnc servers rather
[3:50:01.880 --> 3:50:07.320]  than a potential internal leak that may have occurred or some other source of activity so he's
[3:50:07.320 --> 3:50:11.960]  saying hey he understands crowd strike has made controversial allegations and been at the at the
[3:50:11.960 --> 3:50:17.800]  behest and behalf of working at least allied with various ukrainian oligarchs or oligarchs concerned
[3:50:17.800 --> 3:50:22.120]  with ukrainian activities and he says i i think crowd strike shows up in these scandals here in
[3:50:22.120 --> 3:50:27.240]  the united states let's work together to uncover this corruption and collusion as president trump
[3:50:27.240 --> 3:50:32.520]  explains in this context he mentions that robert moeller and how robert moeller did a very poor
[3:50:32.520 --> 3:50:38.040]  poor incompetent performance and he's he's telling the ukrainian president look i'm really on your
[3:50:38.040 --> 3:50:43.000]  side whatever you've heard about me whatever you think about me i want to expose corruption in
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:47.720]  america i want to expose corruption in ukraine i want to expose corruption wherever it was and
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:52.840]  to and to whomever it leads i understand who the deep state is as he has publicly talked about
[3:50:52.840 --> 3:50:58.360]  in the press over the past three years so president zelinski responds to that invitation
[3:50:58.360 --> 3:51:03.400]  and discussion by the president the president's reaction to president zelinski in which president
[3:51:04.120 --> 3:51:11.000]  zelinski says he understands that he recalled the ambassador because of the issues he understood
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:15.560]  that the ambassador was connected to sort of deep state activities he says he wants to cooperate
[3:51:15.560 --> 3:51:21.240]  even more so in his own words he has he has great confidence in president trump and he you can tell
[3:51:21.240 --> 3:51:25.720]  he's ecstatic at what he's hearing from the president he's hearing for the first time an american
[3:51:25.720 --> 3:51:31.000]  president not promised to undermine ukrainian independence but try to promote ukrainian independence
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:36.520]  with a meaningful investigation to clean up corruption in both nations he president zelinski
[3:51:36.520 --> 3:51:41.880]  the president of ukraine is the one who brings up mayor juliani mayor juliani has been repeatedly
[3:51:41.880 --> 3:51:47.480]  raising the issues of corruption involving ukraine whether it's the dnc issue involving
[3:51:47.480 --> 3:51:52.520]  corrupt the democratic national committee meeting with people connected to ukraine in order to try
[3:51:52.520 --> 3:51:57.720]  to undermine president trump in 2016 whether involves ukraine's connection to christopher
[3:51:57.720 --> 3:52:03.720]  steele infusion gps and perkins co in the hillary clinton campaign involved in the bogus dossier
[3:52:03.720 --> 3:52:08.440]  that was laundered through the fbi in questionable manners that led to the illicit feisel warrants
[3:52:08.440 --> 3:52:13.160]  that led to the spy gate scandal against president trump's campaign whether it's involving any of
[3:52:13.160 --> 3:52:17.320]  those issues president zelinski is showing his cognizance of it and of its significance in
[3:52:17.320 --> 3:52:22.680]  relationship to ukrainian independence ukraine cleaning up its own government and he says and
[3:52:22.680 --> 3:52:27.640]  so he talks about juliani and he says i really hope juliani can come travel here because i want
[3:52:27.640 --> 3:52:32.600]  his information i want his intel i want his insight please let that happen president trump show me
[3:52:32.600 --> 3:52:37.400]  president trump that you're serious and meaningful about taking on deep state corruption that you're
[3:52:37.400 --> 3:52:42.200]  serious and meaningful about protecting both american independence and ukrainian independence
[3:52:42.200 --> 3:52:46.920]  and so president trump responds and says absolutely says i'll help facilitate that i won't interfere
[3:52:46.920 --> 3:52:51.320]  with that i won't interpose any objection to that i'll make sure that can happen as best i can
[3:52:52.040 --> 3:52:58.200]  as we go further into the discussion it is at that point that president trump reveals he understands
[3:52:58.200 --> 3:53:03.000]  you just had president zelinski saying look i understand our ambassador was really involved
[3:53:03.000 --> 3:53:07.400]  in deep state collusive corrupt activities and that's why i recalled him and he had president trump
[3:53:07.400 --> 3:53:12.840]  saying hey i know that the us ambassador was involved in some very nefarious activities
[3:53:12.840 --> 3:53:17.640]  in the in ukraine so he's showing the same that they're on the same page president zelinski wants
[3:53:17.640 --> 3:53:23.240]  to hear that president trump is a teddy roosevelt style reformer who wants to clean up corrupt actions
[3:53:23.240 --> 3:53:27.560]  involving the united states that can help ukrainian independence and american independence at the same
[3:53:27.560 --> 3:53:32.360]  time president trump is reciprocating saying he understands he appreciates what president trump
[3:53:32.360 --> 3:53:37.400]  says if we go to the transcript it was a former ambassador from the united states the woman was
[3:53:37.400 --> 3:53:43.160]  bad news and the people she was dealing with in the ukraine were bad news so i just want to let
[3:53:43.160 --> 3:53:49.720]  you know that so this is president trump discussing how as the documentary ukraine on fire and others
[3:53:49.720 --> 3:53:57.000]  detail the ambassador to to ukraine under the obama administration was involved with neo-nazis
[3:53:57.000 --> 3:54:02.920]  and nazi legacy groups so this is president trump recognizing that accepting that reflecting that
[3:54:02.920 --> 3:54:08.040]  letting president zelinski know hey i do know what's been happening in the prior administration
[3:54:08.040 --> 3:54:11.720]  with deep state activities in the obama administration and i know how they've been
[3:54:11.720 --> 3:54:15.480]  trying to improperly infiltrate your country i know how they've been trying to stage coups
[3:54:15.480 --> 3:54:20.680]  in your country i know how they've been involved as he calls it bad people who are bad news and
[3:54:20.680 --> 3:54:25.640]  those included even neo-nazi elements involved in anti-semitic violence involved in xenophobic
[3:54:25.640 --> 3:54:30.600]  violence involved in a wide range of potentially false flag staged activities involving the
[3:54:30.600 --> 3:54:35.000]  controversial maiden affair that led to the original coup and overthrow of the democratically
[3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:39.480]  elected government of ukraine he is in that context he's saying look i understand what's
[3:54:39.480 --> 3:54:43.560]  been happening he says he recognizes what happened with joe biden he recognizes the
[3:54:43.560 --> 3:54:47.640]  vice president was doing bad things in ukraine that his son was doing bad things in ukraine
[3:54:47.640 --> 3:54:52.840]  that there was attempts to obstruct the prosecutor in ukraine and it is in that context that president
[3:54:52.840 --> 3:54:57.160]  trump makes those statements he's not initiating or instigating anything what he's saying in
[3:54:57.160 --> 3:55:01.000]  response and in reaction to the president of ukraine is i understand and accept you want to
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:05.240]  reform and clean up your country i'm on board i'm not going to interfere with that like past
[3:55:05.240 --> 3:55:09.880]  us presidents or past us administrations have done i'm going to help facilitate that and let
[3:55:09.880 --> 3:55:14.680]  me tell you the facts that i know that show you i'm on the same page as you are president zelinski
[3:55:14.680 --> 3:55:19.400]  loves that how does president zelinski response this isn't a president who feels he's being coerced
[3:55:19.400 --> 3:55:22.840]  this isn't a president who feels he's being duped this isn't a president of ukraine who thinks
[3:55:22.840 --> 3:55:27.000]  there's a quid pro quo this is a president of ukraine who says quote the issue of the
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:31.560]  investigation of the case involving the biden controversy of getting a ukrainian prosecutor
[3:55:31.560 --> 3:55:37.080]  fired for which biden bragged about on video he said the issue in the investigation of this case
[3:55:37.080 --> 3:55:43.080]  is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and we
[3:55:43.080 --> 3:55:47.640]  will work on the investigation on this case on top of that i would kindly ask if you have any
[3:55:47.640 --> 3:55:54.840]  in additional information please provide it to us we need to administer justice in our country in
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:55:59.880]  ukraine and the only way that can happen is if you help that mr president this is president
[3:55:59.880 --> 3:56:05.880]  trump responding to president zelinski's inquiry request please help us clean up our own country
[3:56:05.880 --> 3:56:10.600]  that means you're gonna have to deal with the past bad activities of the obama administration
[3:56:10.600 --> 3:56:15.960]  its ambassadors to ukraine the dnc's complicity with ukraine and a past vice president are you
[3:56:15.960 --> 3:56:19.880]  willing to do that even if it will implicate a past vice president and that's president trump
[3:56:19.880 --> 3:56:24.200]  saying i will not do anything to interfere with that i will not propose an objection to that i
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:28.120]  will provide you any honest and accurate information so that the deep state democratic
[3:56:28.120 --> 3:56:34.440]  political corruption in ukraine will not have any ongoing influence or can or a bad effect on
[3:56:34.440 --> 3:56:39.880]  ukraine or on the united states this is a president doing his job not doing anything impeachable
[3:56:39.880 --> 3:56:45.080]  as we go further into the conversation the president zelinski talks about energy independence
[3:56:45.080 --> 3:56:49.800]  economic independence so that they can be free from the eu free from russia free from foreign
[3:56:49.800 --> 3:56:55.640]  influence that this is a corollary to cleaning up the deep state corruption as he details that's
[3:56:55.640 --> 3:57:00.120]  what this conversation is all about these are two presidents trying to establish independence and
[3:57:00.120 --> 3:57:05.240]  freedom for their own people free from foreign influences free from economic oligarchic elites
[3:57:05.240 --> 3:57:10.680]  free from deep state corrupt actors and the deep state must have been horrified when they heard
[3:57:10.680 --> 3:57:15.240]  or listened to this transcript whether they read or reviewed it or listened to it in live time
[3:57:15.240 --> 3:57:20.360]  and realized that these two countries together can expose the deep state once and for all and in
[3:57:20.360 --> 3:57:25.080]  the process expose the deep state political corruption and collusion involved with it for
[3:57:25.080 --> 3:57:29.640]  their self enrichment and self empowerment that's why there's the fake impeachment threats against
[3:57:29.640 --> 3:57:33.480]  president trump because it's the deep state and the democrats trying to conspire and collude
[3:57:33.480 --> 3:57:42.120]  together to stop the deep state from being exposed
