[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.900]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.900 --> 00:26.040]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today although alex is
[00:26.040 --> 00:30.880]  going to be joining us right after the news and we have a lot of news charlie
[00:30.880 --> 00:35.880]  sheen was here he would say winning because we're winning across the board
[00:35.880 --> 00:39.280]  course we already knew that hillary clinton was a liar she proved that
[00:39.280 --> 00:43.880]  yesterday she got caught in the lie just before she went to the united nation's
[00:43.880 --> 00:48.560]  security council and talked about how she was using her private email server in
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.920]  her home out of convenience and how she was using it to email bill clinton the
[00:54.920 --> 00:59.320]  clinton spokesman had said just a couple of hours before that that bill
[00:59.320 --> 01:03.800]  clinton did two emails his entire life and specifically said when those two
[01:03.800 --> 01:10.160]  emails were so she got caught in her lie the atf got caught in a power grab
[01:10.160 --> 01:14.480]  that's a big win the second amendment activists have forced the atf to shelve
[01:14.480 --> 01:19.760]  the obama ammo ban 80,000 americans bombard government with complaints as a
[01:19.760 --> 01:25.680]  story up on info wars.com we also have a big victory in the health fronts of
[01:25.680 --> 01:29.280]  course we learned last week that mcdonnell said they were going to back
[01:29.280 --> 01:35.240]  off and no longer do antibiotics and chicken and that has a huge ramifications
[01:35.240 --> 01:38.120]  because the reason that they give antibiotics so much to chickens is
[01:38.120 --> 01:42.040]  because of the way that they're raised you're not going to be able to raise the
[01:42.040 --> 01:47.720]  chickens under these kind of horrible factory conditions and I say horrible not
[01:47.720 --> 01:51.080]  only for the chickens but for the people who eat the chickens you're not going to
[01:51.080 --> 01:54.280]  be able to raise the chickens and those kind of conditions if you don't pump
[01:54.280 --> 01:59.320]  them up with antibiotics they have modified them genetically or through
[01:59.320 --> 02:03.880]  selective breeding to have incredibly large breasts to grow very rapidly they
[02:03.880 --> 02:06.880]  can't even stand on their own so they're laying down on the ground but it's not
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.800]  just the ground it's a deep level of waste and excrement from the previous
[02:12.800 --> 02:15.680]  generation of chickens and so they get these infections that it rubs the
[02:15.680 --> 02:19.200]  feathers off of them they get infections that's why they pump them up with
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.640]  antibiotics but now this week we have a story up on info wars.com mcdonnell's
[02:23.640 --> 02:29.400]  is talking about putting kale into their stores mc kale what are they going to do
[02:29.400 --> 02:32.520]  with this are they going to put it in salads are they going to make it into
[02:32.520 --> 02:36.520]  smoothies who knows it's gonna be very difficult for mcdonnell to do this type
[02:36.520 --> 02:40.640]  of thing the reason that these fast food companies have been loading up their
[02:40.640 --> 02:45.480]  products with things that are used to make rubber mats for example or just
[02:45.480 --> 02:49.320]  chemicals that are preservatives the reason they do that is to give them
[02:49.320 --> 02:55.400]  longer shelf life to make the logistics easier it's very difficult to to handle
[02:55.400 --> 02:58.840]  fresh produce you have a lot of loss with that that's why it's so expensive to
[02:58.840 --> 03:02.520]  buy it in the grocery store that's why it's so cheap to go eat at mcdonnell's
[03:02.520 --> 03:06.680]  that's why the poor people are so obese is because they feel like they can't
[03:06.680 --> 03:11.960]  afford in many cases to eat fresh vegetables let alone organic vegetables
[03:11.960 --> 03:15.320]  so it's going to be a real challenge for mcdonnell's but it's a victory because
[03:15.320 --> 03:18.840]  they're not doing this as the New York Times pointed out because people's tastes
[03:18.840 --> 03:22.960]  have changed they're doing it because people have been educated they
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.440]  understand what the health implications of this are and so that's why they're
[03:27.440 --> 03:31.360]  changing that's why when they announced that they were going to restructure
[03:31.360 --> 03:34.240]  their menu the first thing they said was going to move antibiotics there's no
[03:34.240 --> 03:38.240]  taste to the antibiotics it's because of people's health concerns that they're
[03:38.240 --> 03:43.440]  doing that another huge victory again in fluoridation this one a story from
[03:43.440 --> 03:48.840]  Newsweek we just had a story last week from the from the telegraph in the UK
[03:48.840 --> 03:53.880]  talking about how they had looked at the health effects on the thyroid in the
[03:53.880 --> 03:57.000]  UK looking at areas where there was no fluoridation or where there was light
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.920]  fluoridation versus areas where there was heavy fluoridation they could see a
[03:59.920 --> 04:04.520]  distinct problem coming on with the thyroid making people obese making them
[04:04.520 --> 04:08.480]  depressed now of course there's been other studies pointing to brain damage
[04:08.480 --> 04:13.160]  now this new study that has been done in the United States is showing that there
[04:13.160 --> 04:20.880]  is a correlation to fluoridation and much higher ADHD rates much much higher
[04:20.880 --> 04:24.440]  they even go through and we'll talk about this after the break in detail they
[04:24.440 --> 04:29.360]  even go through and quantize this in a model saying if you add 1%
[04:29.360 --> 04:33.440]  fluoridation every 1% increase rather in the portion of the US population
[04:33.440 --> 04:40.840]  drinking fluoride is going to correspond to 67,000 cases by of ADHD 11 years
[04:40.840 --> 04:45.640]  later and it continued to increase as they took the time frame out to 131
[04:45.640 --> 04:50.480]  cases by 2011 so we're going to talk about that in detail and we're going to
[04:50.480 --> 04:54.640]  talk about even though we're winning we still have to continue to fight New
[04:54.640 --> 04:58.360]  York wants to start paying people to snitch on idling motors stay with us
[04:58.360 --> 05:01.160]  and be right back the government's Department of Homeland Security is

[08:06.720 --> 08:13.400]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:16.040 --> 08:20.560]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I am David Knight on this Wednesday March 11th
[08:20.560 --> 08:25.960]  2015 I'll be hosting the show but Alex Jones is going to be joining us in just
[08:25.960 --> 08:29.160]  a few minutes after the news in this segment we're also going to play a
[08:29.160 --> 08:34.440]  report from Rob do that ran last night on the nightly news talking about how
[08:34.440 --> 08:41.280]  aborted fetuses are being used as a commodity let me explain to you that we
[08:41.280 --> 08:46.480]  all see children as human resources of some type we can respect them as
[08:46.480 --> 08:51.840]  persons or we can use them as commodities Rob do did this story last night and
[08:51.840 --> 08:56.480]  then today we saw this story about Iran they're going to ban vasectomies they're
[08:56.480 --> 09:00.520]  going to curb abortion and contraceptives because they want more
[09:00.520 --> 09:05.200]  people they want to get their population from 77 million to 200 million but of
[09:05.200 --> 09:10.520]  course we have governments in the West and corporations in the West who see
[09:10.520 --> 09:16.000]  children as a different kind of resource they want to harvest aborted feces
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.160]  organs and use them commercially so that's the report we're going to have
[09:19.160 --> 09:23.760]  from Rob do in just a couple of minutes but first this breaking news of course
[09:23.760 --> 09:27.720]  we had a major victory yesterday we've had several victories I was just talking
[09:27.720 --> 09:32.120]  about that in the last segment we have beaten back the ATF for now they wanted
[09:32.120 --> 09:38.880]  to begin a framework that was going to ban all ammunition piece by piece but
[09:38.880 --> 09:41.480]  they've been turned back for right now we've got an article up on info wars
[09:41.480 --> 09:46.640]  comm second amendment activists force the ATF to shelve Obama ammo ban 80,000
[09:46.640 --> 09:51.320]  Americans bombard the government with complaints they said surprisingly you
[09:51.320 --> 09:57.120]  know most this is what the ATF said most view the proposed regulation negatively
[09:57.120 --> 10:00.760]  yeah that's an understatement they said the vast majority of comments received
[10:00.760 --> 10:06.880]  a date are critical of the framework and so this deserves further study the
[10:06.880 --> 10:12.400]  ATF accordingly will not at this time seek to issue a final framework let
[10:12.400 --> 10:17.000]  me explain to you what their framework is what they're calling a framework is
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.200]  merely the idea that they've come up with a rationale for banning ammunition
[10:22.200 --> 10:28.960]  and just like playing the game of hangman they're going to add one piece at
[10:28.960 --> 10:33.000]  a time until they have completely destroyed your God-given rights
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.960]  respected by the Constitution that the government agents have to swear to uphold
[10:37.960 --> 10:42.200]  to become government agents that's what they appeal to for their authority and
[10:42.200 --> 10:46.080]  they want to destroy that they ignore it and they want to remove it because that
[10:46.080 --> 10:50.400]  removes their obvious criminal liability but that's what the second
[10:50.400 --> 10:53.960]  amendment said would happen they said it would be a gradual process of
[10:53.960 --> 10:58.280]  infringement putting one piece in at a time just like you're playing the game
[10:58.280 --> 11:01.520]  of hangman they said of course they're going to go back and they're going to
[11:01.520 --> 11:05.840]  look at this again there's going to be additional open and transparent processes
[11:05.840 --> 11:10.760]  yeah right okay well at least they were more transparent and more responsive
[11:10.760 --> 11:14.760]  than the FCC who came out and said we're going to take over the internet we're
[11:14.760 --> 11:19.240]  not going to tell you how we're going to do it we're only going to tell you why
[11:19.240 --> 11:23.400]  it's to protect net neutrality we're going to fix the internet because you
[11:23.400 --> 11:28.240]  know what the internet is broken no it's not and they still haven't after a
[11:28.240 --> 11:32.640]  week shown us what the proposed regulations were going to be the FCC is
[11:32.640 --> 11:37.120]  starting to control the internet and they're worse than the ATF already who's
[11:37.120 --> 11:40.400]  been going after the second amendment they pass regulation they don't let
[11:40.400 --> 11:44.840]  anybody look at it including our elected representatives and then they have this
[11:44.840 --> 11:49.080]  regulation passed for over a week and we still haven't seen it not the public
[11:49.080 --> 11:52.920]  not our elected representatives gun owners of America had this comment they
[11:52.920 --> 11:56.360]  said this was supposed to these regulations had been put out for public
[11:56.360 --> 12:02.360]  comment up until March 16th for the ATF now they have backed that down five days
[12:02.360 --> 12:06.720]  early that is a major victory and not only were there 80,000 people sending a
[12:06.720 --> 12:12.400]  comment to them but they also got comments from over 200 congressmen there
[12:12.400 --> 12:15.680]  you go but they say that they've tried to make a good faith interpretation of
[12:15.680 --> 12:18.960]  law this is what the ATF said we try to make a good faith interpretation of law
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.360]  and of course this deserves further study no it doesn't but they're going to
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.160]  come back but we beat them this time and we can beat them again and I think one
[12:27.160 --> 12:32.200]  of the things we need to do is go on the offense against these empire building
[12:32.200 --> 12:37.120]  bureaucracies that never stop and the ATF is one example of many examples of
[12:37.120 --> 12:41.040]  that now we're not going to have time to get in this before we play Rob's report
[12:41.040 --> 12:45.320]  but there's another victory today this one on water fluoridation the studies
[12:45.320 --> 12:50.080]  are coming out almost on a weekly basis it was just in February the 23rd that we
[12:50.080 --> 12:55.120]  saw study from the British paper the Telegraph looking at the effects on
[12:55.120 --> 12:59.600]  the thyroid in Britain in areas where there was heavy fluoridation versus
[12:59.600 --> 13:02.560]  areas where there was light fluoridation where there was no fluoridation
[13:02.560 --> 13:06.840]  because fortunately for the British they have a lot of areas where there is no
[13:06.840 --> 13:11.560]  fluoridation in America it's simply a question of how much fluoride are they
[13:11.560 --> 13:14.920]  dumping in the water based on different areas and so what they did was they did
[13:14.920 --> 13:19.280]  a study here in the United States this is a study that's been published in the
[13:19.280 --> 13:22.400]  journal environmental health that found that states with higher portion of
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.000]  artificially fluoridated water had a higher prevalence of ADHD they said
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.680]  this relationship held up across six different years that they looked at to
[13:32.680 --> 13:35.520]  sum it up they said states in which a greater proportion of people received
[13:35.520 --> 13:39.680]  artificially fluoridated water in 1992 tended to have a greater proportion of
[13:39.680 --> 13:44.440]  children and adolescents who received ADHD diagnoses after controlling for
[13:44.440 --> 13:49.760]  socioeconomic status in other words they looked at Delaware for example and Iowa
[13:49.760 --> 13:53.380]  both states have relatively low poverty rates but they have heavily
[13:53.380 --> 13:59.840]  fluoridated water and have heavy levels of ADHD now they even quantized this with
[13:59.840 --> 14:03.760]  a model the scientists produced a predictive model they calculated that
[14:03.760 --> 14:08.360]  every 1% increase in the portion of the US population drinking fluoridated water
[14:08.360 --> 14:17.080]  in 1992 was associated with 60,000 67,000 sorry additional cases of ADHD 11
[14:17.080 --> 14:24.200]  years later and an additional 131 cases by 2011 after controlling for
[14:24.200 --> 14:28.600]  socioeconomic status in other words about 20 years later so they even they
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.560]  even quantized it but we'll come back to this later on in the broadcast and I
[14:33.560 --> 14:36.440]  want to get your comments on this but let's go to this report from Rob do
[14:36.440 --> 14:43.320]  about how some corporations view human resources of children
[14:49.920 --> 14:57.360]  how old are you in real time 28 I'm wondering if you had as much time as I
[14:57.360 --> 15:03.480]  have what would you do with it if I had all that time I sure as hell wouldn't
[15:03.480 --> 15:08.960]  waste it the movie in time seems to be a perfect metaphor for what's going on in
[15:08.960 --> 15:12.600]  our daily lives now we don't seem to ever have enough time even though with all
[15:12.600 --> 15:16.040]  this great technology and all these advances we're still always running
[15:16.040 --> 15:29.560]  behind trying to catch up never getting enough done well Google may have a
[15:29.560 --> 15:32.760]  solution for that as they do for everything else in fact there's a
[15:32.760 --> 15:37.120]  Google executive that thinks we can live to be up to 500 years old Bloomberg
[15:37.120 --> 15:41.440]  business reported that Google Ventures CEO is in the search for immortality
[15:41.440 --> 15:45.760]  that's right Bill Maris has up to 425 million dollars a year that he could
[15:45.760 --> 15:48.960]  spend on venture projects out there and he's looking for companies that will
[15:48.960 --> 15:52.920]  slow aging reverse disease and extend life Google Ventures has close to 2
[15:52.920 --> 15:57.800]  billion in assets under management with stakes in more than 280 startups they
[15:57.800 --> 16:03.640]  fund things like Google Glass driverless cars SpaceX and Google X is working on a
[16:03.640 --> 16:07.520]  pill that would insert nanoparticles into our bloodstream to detect disease and
[16:07.520 --> 16:12.560]  cancer mutations but how will we pay for this immortality and what will be the
[16:12.560 --> 16:16.760]  cost to you and I will it be through Xeno transplantation where they take
[16:16.760 --> 16:20.800]  actual organs from aborted babies and grow them inside rats and other animals
[16:20.800 --> 16:24.880]  and then implant them into you do you want to be responsible for the death of
[16:24.880 --> 16:28.840]  another human being so you could live longer well there's a biotech company
[16:28.840 --> 16:33.320]  in Redwood City California which is doing just that the California company
[16:33.320 --> 16:37.760]  Ganogen removes the organs from aborted babies transplants them into a rat or
[16:37.760 --> 16:41.280]  pig and allows them to grow so they could be transplanted into a human work
[16:41.280 --> 16:45.520]  has initially been done on kidneys WorldNet Daily seems to be one of the
[16:45.520 --> 16:48.840]  only publications talking about this they have a couple articles one
[16:48.840 --> 16:53.360]  scientists grow kidneys of aborted babies and animals an aborted baby organ
[16:53.360 --> 16:58.480]  program called Franken science this is one way we're turning our children into
[16:58.480 --> 17:02.440]  commodities and they're not even being born yet now after they're born we have
[17:02.440 --> 17:06.520]  the CPS that goes around and traffics children in fact Los Angeles Department
[17:06.520 --> 17:10.000]  of Children and Family Services is under state investigation the LA Department
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.800]  of Children and Family Services has been under fire in recent years with
[17:12.800 --> 17:15.560]  official commissions investigating high-profile deaths of children who've
[17:15.560 --> 17:18.840]  come in contact with the foster care system investigators are looking into
[17:18.840 --> 17:23.200]  allegations that officials in Los Angeles DCFS office engaged in a series of
[17:23.200 --> 17:27.360]  baby trafficking activities and cover up extending back 15 years involving
[17:27.360 --> 17:31.920]  possibly large numbers of babies and these kids had a high price tag they
[17:31.920 --> 17:36.680]  estimate the 21,000 kids that went through the system they were getting 25,000 a
[17:36.680 --> 17:40.320]  piece for them at taking them out of the system and transferring them to families
[17:40.320 --> 17:45.120]  with these large fees and so the supervisors are getting kickbacks the
[17:45.120 --> 17:48.600]  employees are getting kicked back so what they need is more kids so they go
[17:48.600 --> 17:51.880]  after your family oh you don't want vaccines for your kids maybe we're gonna
[17:51.880 --> 17:56.560]  call CPS oh you don't want to treat your kid for eczema using the steroid cream
[17:56.560 --> 17:59.920]  like the CPS recommends well we're gonna take your kids and that's what happened
[17:59.920 --> 18:03.680]  to a family in Washington state recently they had a home birth of twins and they
[18:03.680 --> 18:06.320]  didn't want to bring them to the doctor because they felt their kids immune
[18:06.320 --> 18:09.640]  system hasn't been developed yet well due to pressure from their family they
[18:09.640 --> 18:12.640]  called the paramedics to come check on their kids the paramedics said the kids
[18:12.640 --> 18:15.520]  are fine but they recommend they bring them to a doctor and I said no we're
[18:15.520 --> 18:19.160]  gonna wait till they their immune systems get better well the next day CPS
[18:19.160 --> 18:22.800]  shows up and goes hey your kid has eczema we recommend this steroid cream
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.240]  they go well we're treating it with natural antibiotics and creams like
[18:27.240 --> 18:30.120]  coconut oil and they said no if you're not using the steroid cream we're gonna
[18:30.120 --> 18:33.280]  take your kids so they took their kids for a while then they got them back but
[18:33.280 --> 18:36.520]  now they're under investigation they're under the heel of the CPS and if they
[18:36.520 --> 18:40.160]  don't march and cross every T and died every eye they're gonna come and take
[18:40.160 --> 18:43.880]  their kids and because of that oppression they decided to flee the state
[18:43.880 --> 18:47.720]  well then they got busted down in California and before being arrested the
[18:47.720 --> 18:51.680]  mother Carrie Ringo actually told a cameraman send a message to America for
[18:51.680 --> 18:54.800]  me children don't belong to the government the government belongs to the
[18:54.800 --> 19:00.000]  people when our children become commodities it lessens their value you
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.280]  can't put a value on human life you really can't although they're trying to
[19:04.280 --> 19:07.800]  do that with this health care system where they're gonna have to budget health
[19:07.800 --> 19:11.120]  care for you and and we may have to create death panels they're trying to put
[19:11.120 --> 19:15.040]  a price tag on human life they're trying to say some lives aren't worth as much
[19:15.040 --> 19:19.640]  as others and pretty soon hey like will I am said rolling stone
[19:19.640 --> 19:25.120]  eventually 3d printing will print people fact here's his quote you can print in
[19:25.120 --> 19:28.960]  freaking protein you can make freaking meat you can print leather you can print
[19:28.960 --> 19:32.920]  a liver so if you can print a liver or a kidney god dang it you're going to be
[19:32.920 --> 19:37.960]  able to print a whole freaking person and that's scary yeah that is scary we
[19:37.960 --> 19:41.920]  may split into that human species that subservient class in that master class a
[19:41.920 --> 19:46.440]  lot earlier than HD Wells ever predicted so try to remember that when you see
[19:46.440 --> 19:50.120]  headlines like Google exec says we can live to be 500 or forever or we're
[19:50.120 --> 19:54.800]  gonna merge with machines look at the human cost now and ask yourself is it

[24:40.000 --> 24:43.500]  subscription that helps to support our operation that produces research like you
[24:43.500 --> 24:51.160]  just heard from Rob do if we don't understand how the people are viewing us
[24:51.160 --> 24:56.480]  how they're viewing us not as persons they're viewing us simply as commodities
[24:56.480 --> 25:01.440]  commodities to be used for their purposes organs to be harvested as he
[25:01.440 --> 25:08.000]  pointed out and we just see this kind of genetic suicide that's going on in the
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.840]  United States it's just unbelievable to see how the elites are pushing this one
[25:12.840 --> 25:15.120]  of the areas that they're pushing it that I was talking about just before the
[25:15.120 --> 25:19.320]  break was water fluoridation we know that it is a very expensive for local
[25:19.320 --> 25:23.760]  communities to put this in the US is by far and away the most heavily
[25:23.760 --> 25:27.880]  fluoridated country in the world many areas they don't fluoridate at all when
[25:27.880 --> 25:31.840]  I was in Denmark in Copenhagen we're looking at the bill reporting on the
[25:31.840 --> 25:36.320]  Bilderberg meeting people came up to me and they said that one guy in particular
[25:36.320 --> 25:41.160]  said my friends thank you guys are lunatics because you're talking about
[25:41.160 --> 25:44.720]  how the government is fluoridating the water they can't believe that the
[25:44.720 --> 25:48.920]  government in America would put fluoride in the water well we've had another
[25:48.920 --> 25:53.800]  study this one as I was pointing out from Newsweek actually quantifying the
[25:53.800 --> 25:59.400]  effect terms of adding fluoridation the number of ADHD cases that we get and
[25:59.400 --> 26:01.880]  of course the mechanism that they're talking about here this is Newsweek
[26:01.880 --> 26:05.760]  magazine reporting this so I guess you can believe it you won't believe it when
[26:05.760 --> 26:09.120]  we tell you when we point to other studies this is a study done within the
[26:09.120 --> 26:13.240]  United States held up over six years this trend they were looking at the
[26:13.240 --> 26:16.360]  different levels of fluoridation because it's pretty hard to find areas in
[26:16.360 --> 26:20.600]  America where there isn't fluoridation to compare it against places that are
[26:20.600 --> 26:24.520]  heavily fluoridated so they looked at how heavily fluoridated it was and this
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.320]  is a scientist the University of Massachusetts Hamhurst who studies
[26:28.320 --> 26:32.600]  endocrine disruptors those are chemicals in and free with the body's hormones
[26:32.600 --> 26:36.080]  and of course that's something they say that fluoride has been shown to do they
[26:36.080 --> 26:40.320]  say since 1992 the percentage of the US population drinks fluoridated water has
[26:40.320 --> 26:48.080]  increased from 56% to 67% and during that time they've seen ADHD increase
[26:48.080 --> 26:54.160]  from 7% to 11% they actually quantified it they said for every 1% of the
[26:54.160 --> 26:59.640]  population that you fluoridate the water you wind up with 67,000 additional
[26:59.640 --> 27:03.960]  cases over about a 10-year period and over a 20-year period you wound up with
[27:03.960 --> 27:08.840]  131,000 additional cases so it accumulates we had a study that came
[27:08.840 --> 27:12.320]  out just February 23rd in Britain where they were talking about thyroid damage
[27:12.320 --> 27:17.240]  they quantified it as well in a different way they said we see thyroid
[27:17.240 --> 27:22.080]  damage that creates obesity and depression in people we see that
[27:22.080 --> 27:27.320]  happening at the level of 0.3 parts per million well what are the levels that
[27:27.320 --> 27:32.840]  are allowed for water fluoridation in the United States 0.7 to 1.2 in
[27:32.840 --> 27:38.440]  other words 2 to 4 times the level that they saw thyroid damage in the UK the
[27:38.440 --> 27:43.760]  EPA allows 4 parts per million that's more than 10 times the level that they
[27:43.760 --> 27:51.960]  saw damage to the thyroid no problem why would they push back against us when
[27:51.960 --> 27:55.120]  we've been talking about this there's been ample studies we've had studies in
[27:55.120 --> 28:01.400]  China talking about the influence on intellectual activity on IQ the drop
[28:01.400 --> 28:05.120]  in IQ based on high levels of fluoridation the question is when you
[28:05.120 --> 28:08.920]  look at this you say well they're they're allowing two to four times the
[28:08.920 --> 28:12.600]  level and fluoridation the EPA says they're going to allow 10 times the
[28:12.600 --> 28:17.400]  level that causes damage according to this study in the UK the question is how
[28:17.400 --> 28:21.600]  do you even know what level you're getting in the United States how do you
[28:21.600 --> 28:26.800]  control the dosage when you just dump it into the water if I believed that
[28:26.800 --> 28:32.320]  fluoridation artificial fluoridation was healthy if I believed that it was
[28:32.320 --> 28:37.000]  something that I needed for my teeth I would put it on my teeth I wouldn't
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.840]  drink it but I certainly wouldn't drink it out of the water I would take it out
[28:40.840 --> 28:45.880]  of the water so I could control the dosage that I get we should always ask
[28:45.880 --> 28:51.200]  why is the government continuing to add this with all of these questions of
[28:51.200 --> 28:54.280]  course the scientists pushed back they said well this is just one study it's
[28:54.280 --> 28:57.960]  not just one study there's been multiple studies on multiple effects and they
[28:57.960 --> 29:02.680]  continue to dump it in the water where they can't control the dosage that tells
[29:02.680 --> 29:08.080]  us there's an even more sinister agenda here than just making money for the
[29:08.080 --> 29:12.160]  companies industries that want to get rid of their toxic waste not have to pay
[29:12.160 --> 29:17.360]  to dispose of it the aluminum industry the nuclear processing industry these
[29:17.360 --> 29:20.040]  were the industries that pushed for fluoridation they're the ones who
[29:20.040 --> 29:24.600]  benefit from it because they don't have to pay for it to be disposed of as a
[29:24.600 --> 29:29.080]  toxic waste they can actually sell it to municipalities and dump it in our
[29:29.080 --> 29:34.560]  water and of course it makes us dumber it makes us fatter it gives us ADHD it
[29:34.560 --> 29:40.640]  gives us depression all side benefits and it makes us poor stay with us right
[29:40.640 --> 29:44.640]  after the break Alex Jones is gonna be joining us with more news stay with us

[33:56.840 --> 34:00.760]  spring break down here on the rainy coast my son and daughters love to go
[34:00.760 --> 34:04.640]  fishing and deep-sea fishing so they're off with the grandparents doing that
[34:04.640 --> 34:10.120]  right now while we're here working from the hotel room again Alex Jones coming
[34:10.120 --> 34:16.480]  to you from the Texas coastline. Yesterday we had a pretty powerful three-hour
[34:16.480 --> 34:21.240]  broadcast and when David and I are both in there jousting to get as much info
[34:21.240 --> 34:28.080]  out it's not competition but it creates a energetic synergy that is extremely
[34:28.080 --> 34:32.920]  listenable and mixed in with all the facts and factoids and important info
[34:32.920 --> 34:38.320]  but last night as I was going to bed at about 10 o'clock I was just laying
[34:38.320 --> 34:44.880]  there thinking about how historical a time we're in and how epic a time we're
[34:44.880 --> 34:51.480]  in again to use that word and how the public really is in a trance and just
[34:51.480 --> 34:57.720]  sitting there contemplating I prayed to to to God that these are the times you
[34:57.720 --> 35:01.400]  pray there are no atheists and foxholes it's been said I forget who said that we
[35:01.400 --> 35:06.600]  should look up that quote and I was thinking yes it's good that I ran
[35:06.600 --> 35:10.320]  and rave and scream and yell and hyperventilate that's real I'm like a
[35:10.320 --> 35:13.320]  caged animal desperately trying to get out I mean I know the globalists are
[35:13.320 --> 35:16.800]  closing in on us I know they're hurting us there's so many good people on this
[35:16.800 --> 35:20.520]  planet I want to protect because I want to be protected as well it's it's it's
[35:20.520 --> 35:24.640]  mutual aid and it's good that I get excited some that's what's brought the
[35:24.640 --> 35:29.920]  big crowds of people because the world is under a trance under a conditioned
[35:29.920 --> 35:36.720]  incremental trance to have learned helplessness and to basically
[35:36.720 --> 35:44.640]  have a normalcy bias to where you're an ashtek a thousand years ago and you
[35:44.640 --> 35:47.960]  think it's normal to have your children hauled off to have their hearts cut out
[35:47.960 --> 35:53.000]  for the sun god for the snake god or you're living in Nazi Germany and you
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.240]  think it's normal that 15 million Germans have died and there's still a
[35:56.240 --> 36:00.720]  year left of the war and you're working 20 hours a day and down the road
[36:00.720 --> 36:05.480]  there's a forced labor camp and your your cousin just got disappeared because
[36:05.480 --> 36:10.640]  he said Hitler was evil or it's normal two hundred years ago he lived in
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.680]  England to basically be you know 12 years old playing in your front yard and
[36:17.680 --> 36:22.120]  men pull up in a carriage knock you on the back of the head tie you up and an
[36:22.120 --> 36:27.200]  hour later you're thrown on a ship that takes off on a three-year tour to the
[36:27.200 --> 36:32.560]  Pacific Ocean and you are literally a slave on board that ship press games
[36:32.560 --> 36:37.720]  legal and lawful until they were abolished and as that was being abolished
[36:37.720 --> 36:43.600]  England then abolished slavery itself but that's just an example of how evils
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.400]  can seem completely normal and the first people that stand up to it and say
[36:48.400 --> 36:52.640]  it's wrong can be laughed at and ridiculed but then overnight folks can
[36:52.640 --> 36:59.200]  turn against it airships like the Hindenburg up until the early 30s were
[36:59.200 --> 37:02.720]  in all the major skies of Europe in the United States people were traveling on
[37:02.720 --> 37:07.120]  them across the country thousands were being built hundreds were in service
[37:07.120 --> 37:12.880]  large ones when the Hindenburg struck that pole and static electricity and
[37:12.880 --> 37:18.480]  exploded because it was using hydrogen not helium and burned you say well why
[37:18.480 --> 37:24.840]  does that matter overnight blimps fell out of airships
[37:24.840 --> 37:32.320]  derogables fell out of favor just like GMO was the biggest thing 20 years ago
[37:32.320 --> 37:35.480]  now it's falling out of favor they're taking it out of foods across the board
[37:35.480 --> 37:39.800]  McDonald's is buckling saying they're gonna take it out huge victories are
[37:39.800 --> 37:44.680]  happening on a daily basis so what you understand as dark as it is things can
[37:44.680 --> 37:49.240]  flip very quickly we flipped into tourney now they admit that there's hidden
[37:49.240 --> 37:52.680]  tech basically and everything spying listening to us we can turn against that
[37:52.680 --> 37:57.920]  start demanding it be removed start lawsuits it can be removed but we first
[37:57.920 --> 38:03.240]  had to admit it was going on and be called crazy people 20 years ago listen
[38:03.240 --> 38:06.360]  there was spy tech in the cable boxes and phones 20 years ago it's wholly
[38:06.360 --> 38:10.600]  classified there were babies being grown in Cal
[38:10.600 --> 38:17.040]  universes 20 years ago and I would read mainstream scientific papers on air but
[38:17.040 --> 38:21.440]  people didn't general public just just listening to me on the radio said you're
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.000]  crazy it doesn't exist just like 20 years ago we talk about spider goats I
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.440]  use as examples everybody knows about spider goats now part spider part go
[38:29.440 --> 38:33.800]  produce body armor and their milk I was called to cook for at least a decade
[38:33.800 --> 38:39.040]  talking about spider guts but I knew that as it became mainline people would
[38:39.040 --> 38:44.880]  then remember and go oh that guy wasn't a cook so that's the bottom line so I
[38:44.880 --> 38:51.400]  prayed last night I said God what is the most important thing we can do and
[38:51.400 --> 38:55.160]  when I woke up this morning I mean it was laid heavily upon me and I don't
[38:55.160 --> 38:57.880]  usually get like this but I privately pray I don't talk a lot about my
[38:57.880 --> 39:02.440]  private relationship with Christ a lot but it's a very real and God said I
[39:02.440 --> 39:08.040]  already told you and you said it yesterday it's break the trance and you do
[39:08.040 --> 39:12.280]  that by praying that God give us all guidance and open up our hearts and
[39:12.280 --> 39:16.680]  minds you have free will the people have chosen to believe the lie and they've
[39:16.680 --> 39:22.200]  gone along the lies so much abortion the NSA the tyranny but obviously it's just
[39:22.200 --> 39:27.880]  thousands of data points coming down they need to be challenged to say okay
[39:27.880 --> 39:31.120]  you want to be slaves it's all here you've had your choice now it's gonna get
[39:31.120 --> 39:35.840]  much worse and and and that's what the message is about God laid on my heart
[39:35.840 --> 39:41.000]  is people all know the truth they've just chosen to not believe it a lot of
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.040]  people are choosing to now investigate for themselves and discover that it's
[39:44.040 --> 39:47.840]  much worse than I've said because you cannot tell somebody about the matrix
[39:47.840 --> 39:53.520]  you got to see it you got to see it for yourself and that's what it comes down
[39:53.520 --> 39:56.840]  to is we need to really figure out how to break people out of their trance and
[39:56.840 --> 40:02.800]  the biggest way to do that is is is to cry out to God and then God will begin
[40:02.800 --> 40:10.560]  to basically give you by increments discernment and the more you act on
[40:10.560 --> 40:15.080]  that discernment the more discernment God will give you but people choose to be
[40:15.080 --> 40:19.640]  ignorant they choose to not understand they'd say to Christ why do you speak in
[40:19.640 --> 40:23.240]  parables and he wasn't speaking in parables really just the they just
[40:23.240 --> 40:28.080]  couldn't understand it because they were the profane they had chosen lies so
[40:28.080 --> 40:33.000]  much throughout their lives that that that that that it was their universe so
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.160]  it so to hear the truth was a lie to them because it would destroy the
[40:38.160 --> 40:43.840]  fraudulent world they lived in and we can't be mad at these people that are
[40:43.840 --> 40:48.800]  in willful denial and under mind control these are very sad victims that are the
[40:48.800 --> 40:53.760]  equivalent of little baby elephants that have been attacked by a pack of wild
[40:53.760 --> 40:57.160]  hyenas being drug away with their little snouts being torn off I mean
[40:57.160 --> 41:01.040]  spiritually they're just being torn apart by a bunch of sharks they have this
[41:01.040 --> 41:05.600]  smile of mind control in their eyes enjoying their destruction enjoying their
[41:05.600 --> 41:12.960]  failure but as we press with our will that God's given us as we press on them
[41:12.960 --> 41:18.000]  and as all this evil begins to manifest that was right below the surface and as
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.880]  the evil intensifies we're going to be attacked and that is an incredible
[41:21.880 --> 41:27.720]  blessing that is a sign of incredible victory now I want to get into just
[41:27.720 --> 41:31.960]  because Rob do did a report on it it's back in the news now that Google is
[41:31.960 --> 41:39.480]  growing a boarded baby parts they've harvest them little darlings and then
[41:39.480 --> 41:45.160]  they grow them in in rats in pigs and cows now this is what Google is telling
[41:45.160 --> 41:47.440]  the public today and I have the mainstream news articles about it how
[41:47.440 --> 41:50.680]  great it is they just report on it like it's no big deal like the president was
[41:50.680 --> 41:54.440]  barbecuing children on the front lawn now that'd be the biggest scandal ever but
[41:54.440 --> 41:58.600]  but see oh it's just dead babies so it's no big deal humans turned into a total
[41:58.600 --> 42:03.720]  commodity five years ago people couldn't believe that Pepsi used baby parts for
[42:03.720 --> 42:08.360]  their flavor testing but of course now it's all over the news and oh no big
[42:08.360 --> 42:14.520]  deal what's wrong with baby parts same thing you know here I want to explain
[42:14.520 --> 42:20.080]  something to you it was in scientific papers that the BBC mentioned in 1996
[42:20.080 --> 42:23.880]  that I read and they were talking about how great it was about how in government
[42:23.880 --> 42:35.080]  labs they were growing fetuses that they had basically caused conflicts caused
[42:35.080 --> 42:39.680]  inception in a test tube and then they were planting them in cows and growing
[42:39.680 --> 42:46.800]  them up in utero to larger than baby size especially engineered to have larger
[42:46.800 --> 42:53.160]  organs see if you understand as you hear about all this human cloning when they
[42:53.160 --> 42:58.480]  admitted it was going on in 1997 they declassified in England that the
[42:58.480 --> 43:03.320]  government had been cloning embryos for at least 25 years before that so now
[43:03.320 --> 43:09.000]  we're back into the 70s and then of course you learn it was going on even
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.320]  before that back into the 50s and now they're declassifying Nuremberg documents
[43:13.320 --> 43:17.480]  you can look these up where they were already cloning rabbits in the 40s in
[43:17.480 --> 43:23.880]  Nazi Germany so see the reason the elite are so arrogant is folks everything
[43:23.880 --> 43:29.400]  you've heard from me is what we can prove and folks can handle it let me tell
[43:29.400 --> 43:32.400]  you I can extrapolate out where all this goes and see the predictive
[43:32.400 --> 43:41.000]  programming we are in deep trouble we are beyond a science fiction movie it's
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.400]  real and if you're in a trance you don't understand that but if you're
[43:45.400 --> 43:50.680]  conscious it's incredible what's going on
[43:51.480 --> 43:56.000]  and God let it on me I want the crew to work with me on this but I need to be
[43:56.000 --> 44:01.600]  speak more I need to get angry sometimes but I need to be more poignant and I need
[44:01.600 --> 44:06.960]  to talk slower and I need to really give people time for this to sink in to
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.360]  break the trance we've already woken up the people that weren't really in a
[44:11.360 --> 44:14.400]  trance knew something was wrong and heard some guy yelling and came and
[44:14.400 --> 44:18.160]  listened and they already knew the truths that I was speaking that were
[44:18.160 --> 44:21.200]  already in their heart I didn't tell you anything we need to reach out to
[44:21.200 --> 44:26.880]  people that are in the trance and not be manipulative not do a fake version of
[44:26.880 --> 44:31.040]  it but a real version of it of the way you speak to a child when they won't
[44:31.040 --> 44:35.360]  listen and keep going in the street you get him out of the army go listen I saw
[44:35.360 --> 44:40.040]  a little boy run over once and he was smashed all over the road like that
[44:40.040 --> 44:44.360]  dead deer and if you go back out in the street you might end up getting run over
[44:44.360 --> 44:49.880]  and your guts are gonna be all over the street old guy named Mr. Brunner who
[44:49.880 --> 44:53.360]  actually sold my parents the house that we had there on San Fernando way in
[44:53.360 --> 44:57.360]  Dallas I was about five years old my mom was asleep inside on a Saturday and
[44:57.360 --> 45:01.240]  almost got hit by a car and he told me before get out of street he came over
[45:01.240 --> 45:04.240]  and he grabbed by the arm and he reached down and he told me just exactly that
[45:04.240 --> 45:07.560]  he didn't say it hatefully but he had a little bit of menace in its voice
[45:07.560 --> 45:11.080]  because the cars are a menace
[45:11.080 --> 45:16.680]  kind of like don't stick your hand down that rattlesnake oh boy and that's how
[45:16.680 --> 45:21.520]  we need to speak to people at least some of the time to break them out of their
[45:21.520 --> 45:26.760]  trance do you understand that the British government and the US government
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.080]  and the Harvard and all of them admit the fluorides making us depressed and fat
[45:31.080 --> 45:36.200]  and suicidal and making our thyroids and pancreas just go out they know it they
[45:36.200 --> 45:46.680]  did it on purpose now deal with it think about that think about Google think
[45:46.680 --> 45:52.480]  about Google openly coming out eight years ago and saying we're gonna use
[45:52.480 --> 45:55.400]  microphones and cameras to watch and listen to you but don't worry as
[45:55.400 --> 46:01.240]  computers key logging everything you say now it's all out of the open being done
[46:01.240 --> 46:08.440]  think about their arrogance think about what they haven't announced yet now I
[46:08.440 --> 46:11.880]  have some second amendment news coming up in the next hour they claim the ATF is
[46:11.880 --> 46:15.480]  backed off I read their statement this is a
[46:15.480 --> 46:19.360]  fit this is where you act like you're going one way in a sword fight but you're
[46:19.360 --> 46:22.760]  really going the other way or when you act like you're gonna pass the ball and
[46:22.760 --> 46:26.080]  it's really a handoff or you act like you handed it off to somebody and you
[46:26.080 --> 46:28.640]  really handed off to somebody else it's a trick as
[46:28.640 --> 46:32.680]  guaranteed the headlines are that they've been defeated they've backed off you
[46:32.680 --> 46:37.280]  read what they say they say we're shelving it for now no they're not the
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.760]  attack pattern well I'll get into the attack pattern I'll cover that in the
[46:42.760 --> 46:48.240]  next hour but it's very easy to understand the enemy's playbook they
[46:48.240 --> 46:51.080]  have a big operation to run that's one of their weaknesses is that they have
[46:51.080 --> 46:56.160]  playbooks because they've got legions of operatives so they run plays just like a
[46:56.160 --> 46:59.360]  football coach okay and if you just study their plays we've got their stink
[46:59.360 --> 47:03.400]  and playbooks they've all written books to command their forces
[47:03.400 --> 47:08.080]  eco science there's hundreds of them I've read close to a hundred of their
[47:08.080 --> 47:12.440]  manuals it's unbelievably sickening you can go read their manuals you can read
[47:12.440 --> 47:16.600]  their playbooks if you decide there's a war going on there's a game for your
[47:16.600 --> 47:20.520]  destiny going on it is going on whether you admit it or not and then we've got
[47:20.520 --> 47:24.160]  the enemy playbooks I mean these are the enemy generals the the feraled
[47:24.160 --> 47:30.040]  marshals the witch kings of the New World Order we have their operational
[47:30.040 --> 47:35.800]  manuals we know you've just got to have the strength to admit it and get past
[47:35.800 --> 47:40.800]  the spiritual deception that won't let you even see it the trance but the
[47:40.800 --> 47:48.800]  magicians have put us under but all I'm offering is the truth nothing more you
[47:48.800 --> 47:56.280]  take the blue pill you go back never remember any of this again take the
[47:56.280 --> 48:03.120]  red pill you go down the rabbit hole and I'll show you how far it goes but
[48:03.120 --> 48:10.640]  warning all God is offering all of us is the truth nothing more but you have to
[48:10.640 --> 48:19.200]  decide now that said I want to get into the humanization of the babies and look
[48:19.200 --> 48:23.280]  women that are into abortion and it's your sacrament I understand at least you
[48:23.280 --> 48:29.680]  should know that babies are being harvested for upwards of $50,000
[48:29.680 --> 48:35.000]  especially if they have certain genetic types now a lot of the places are just
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.200]  you know butcher shops but a lot of the fancy ones that you hoity-twenty women
[48:38.200 --> 48:43.920]  go to you should at least get a little cash that's a way to shut this down is
[48:43.920 --> 48:48.880]  to actually let folks know how valuable the market is in the next generation as
[48:48.880 --> 48:53.000]  if there'll be any future generations when the elite have been able to sell
[48:53.000 --> 49:00.080]  something like this so that's coming up there's so much of this now happening
[49:00.080 --> 49:06.240]  that I can't even watch it all or cover it all listeners continue to tell us
[49:06.240 --> 49:12.640]  about on a daily basis everything from The Simpsons to Comedy Central to
[49:12.640 --> 49:21.280]  major Hollywood movies like Prisoners to new stuff every week a new movie by
[49:21.280 --> 49:27.000]  David Cross has a Ku Klux Klan basic leader who says he learned it all from
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.720]  Alex Jones on the radio and starts screaming the n-word I mean and people
[49:31.720 --> 49:34.960]  that don't know me you're just gonna go into movie theaters and it's like I love
[49:34.960 --> 49:41.560]  Alex Jones you know how Hitler kill all the Jews in word in word I mean this is
[49:41.560 --> 49:46.280]  the guy from Mr. Show and all the rest of it who by the way I mean I like Mr.
[49:46.280 --> 49:53.280]  Show Portland landia you name it but I mean these are sick people anyone who
[49:53.280 --> 49:57.760]  who and they're showing and I'll bet money like Armstrong Williams that caught
[49:57.760 --> 50:03.520]  being paid a quarter mil to lion say he was for no child left behind to get
[50:03.520 --> 50:08.120]  conservatives on board for federalization of education
[50:08.560 --> 50:13.720]  Montell Williams came out and said that I am a cokehead who wants to blow things
[50:13.720 --> 50:18.200]  up and I mean you can read the quotes I mean it is unbelievable Montell Williams

[50:21.720 --> 50:27.040]  that he's Montell Williams except now I know he is Judas Iscariot I mean this
[50:27.040 --> 50:30.640]  guy would sell his mother out in my opinion for a stick of bubblegum I mean
[50:30.640 --> 50:35.480]  the stuff he says about me hands down I could win a libel suit I could win a
[50:35.480 --> 50:41.800]  defamation suit just hands down I mean done but MSNBC says that I'm behind the
[50:41.800 --> 50:45.880]  Boston bombing we could play that clip no proof when they say that and you know

[54:16.600 --> 54:21.120]  technique courses they take courses on and you wonder why you tune into MPR
[54:21.120 --> 54:25.680]  and everybody talks with this voice like this because that's a soothing voice
[54:25.680 --> 54:28.920]  that will put people if you listen for just a few minutes into a very calm
[54:28.920 --> 54:32.760]  state you take a public already watching television you know five or ten
[54:32.760 --> 54:36.280]  hours a day in a trance state with lowered brain waves that's in all the
[54:36.280 --> 54:40.560]  big studies you're speaking to someone in in a trance if you try to talk to
[54:40.560 --> 54:43.600]  somebody loud while they're asleep they'll wake up that's what we've done
[54:43.600 --> 54:47.760]  but if you talk to them when they're asleep very softly you can sometimes get
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.480]  people to actually sleepwalk well that's just an example so it's good to yell at
[54:52.480 --> 54:55.760]  folks and get them out of a burning house if they won't wake up or throw a
[54:55.760 --> 55:01.480]  cold bucket of water on them but the tactic of also slowing down calming down
[55:01.480 --> 55:07.480]  I'm telling myself this right now and really saying is it normal to take the
[55:07.480 --> 55:12.000]  dead babies harvest their organs while they're still alive implant them in
[55:12.000 --> 55:17.520]  other animals to grow them up larger genetically engineered cows that are
[55:17.520 --> 55:23.120]  part human so that they don't reject the babies I forgot that part or just
[55:23.120 --> 55:27.520]  growing babies up in test tubes and implanting them in cows and pigs and
[55:27.520 --> 55:35.040]  dogs and sheep and rats and and growing them up and see before you go oh that's
[55:35.040 --> 55:39.000]  crazy I've got mainstream news here I'm gonna cover next hour we just played a
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.600]  report this is Google's life extension program they're just rolling it out as a
[55:43.600 --> 55:47.760]  platform for all these under-the-surface government developments

[57:42.680 --> 57:46.920]  people that are dead inside like you have got a problem with people like me
[57:46.920 --> 57:52.880]  and you think it's a joke the spirit I got me started this country it started
[57:52.880 --> 57:58.160]  Texas and I just can't believe that people like you were so dead inside that
[57:58.160 --> 58:03.040]  you look at somebody like me and call me a con artist because that's all you got
[58:03.040 --> 58:07.160]  you don't have any facts you don't bring anything we tweet out somebody else's

[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:35.320]  now national Hollywood level and TV level platforms go the talking point that
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:42.040]  we're lying racist drug heads here at info wars.com and you know Joe Biggs
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:46.680]  could sue Montell Williams for claiming that he and I are on cocaine I know Joe
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.200]  he doesn't use drugs he does drink beer I've had a few with him he does eat
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.440]  steaks he's been over to my house and had steak you know with me and my family
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:57.640]  but you know that's that's Montell Williams attacking a veteran a combat
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.480]  veteran like Joe Biggs because he tweeted out Mattel Thalen on one of our
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:06.520]  team members who just simply put out the Montell Williams the angle on this is
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:13.680]  Montell Williams tries to cover up people attacking veterans I mean it's
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.720]  sick it's sick and if you just joined us Montell Williams came out and with just
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.480]  defamation slander just just just incredible lies I'd like to invite
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:30.240]  Montell Williams to come on the show and to you know show some proof here of all
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.880]  these horrible things he has to say about me but again why is this happening
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.040]  well you tune in we're battling for the second amendment we're battling for
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.640]  family rights we're battling that babies not be kept alive when you think
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.920]  they're aborted and they're using medical experiments I mean that's in the
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:49.640]  news or that babies be cut up and then their body parts live after they've
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:54.360]  been harvested implanted in different mammals that have been hybridized with
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.400]  humans that they've they've now got a herd last time I checked to more than
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:04.520]  10,000 cows in China that aren't for implanting humans they've got those as
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.120]  well China's the main base of this Costa Rica strangely enough does as well but
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.640]  they actually implant the the human genetics into the udders so human
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.040]  breast milk comes out those cows are part human like the spider goats are part
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:23.680]  arachnid I mean we're here covering the epic craziness not liberal not
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:30.800]  conservative free will that that you're allowed to control your own destiny all
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.600]  races of people are one race coming together and love and liberty and we
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.040]  are attacked like no one else by the Nazis because most of them are government
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.880]  finance let me go to any Nazi website there are more attacks on us than
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.640]  Benjamin Netanyahu and then we're also attacked by the hardcore leftist Jewish
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.200]  lobby because we love everyone we're not here for division we're not here to
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:55.520]  manage different gangs or crime groups we're here to really try to go to the
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.200]  stars and that's why when we come back from break we have a new attack by
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.440]  David Cross an amazing comedian it's so hurtful for me being a David Cross man
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.040]  watching him on Mr. Show in Portland Indian things over the years that I've
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:17.080]  you know watched and it is so painful absolutely painful to see him the
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:21.160]  director and the writer of this film that we're gonna be talking about when we
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:28.040]  come back on the other side to have the star of the film be a crazy person that
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.440]  goes crazy on the internet because of me and runs around screaming the n-word and
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.040]  worshiping Hitler basically and they says I did all this because of Alex Jones
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:41.760]  the talk show host I mean that is pure brazen lies purely unattentive there's no
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:47.520]  way a jury wouldn't rule for me guaranteed no lawsuit I mean just
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:52.880]  unbelievable David Knight this signifies that we are now over the main enemy
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.800]  target in the info war praise God and pass the ammunition in the info war
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.880]  David Knight yeah Alex they don't have anything to argue with with the facts
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.520]  they're losing on that so they resort to ad hominem attacks they attack the
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.920]  messenger they will literally kill the messenger just like they did with Gary
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:15.360]  Webb but if it comes down to that but they go after you as a person because
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.800]  they don't want to talk about the facts I was just tweeted last night somebody
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:22.360]  sent me a new National Geographic article that was attacking fluoride and
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:28.080]  comparing it to non-scientific attitudes and actually had a graph talking
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:33.040]  about the flat earth but before they got to that Alex they had a quote from Dr.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.000]  Strangelove where they went through this whole thing talking about the
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.920]  fluoride conspiracy and making fun of it but then today I walk in and there's a
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:45.600]  major report from Newsweek linking to yet another study that proves the effect
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.760]  of fluoride we're winning on the facts and they can't speak because there's a
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.320]  battle yeah and everybody in the system is not evil there's a real moment of
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.280]  conscience that we come to stay with us
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:02.640]  the government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo at

[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:32.600]  earlier than I'll get into this latest attack and this show is not idiosyncratic
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:37.760]  it's not all based on us it's just that we're a sensor a probe like a
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.560]  thermometer stuck in a turkey we're at the very tip of the spear just like the
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.040]  military will put out frontline reconnaissance trips knowing some of
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.560]  them are expendable they're like nerve endings to go out and identify the main
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.880]  enemy force so you don't lose your main force and so we have volunteered
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.040]  organically it's not just I'm not under attack the entire operation is because
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.400]  we're out front you know exposing the gun grab exposing the world government
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:05.040]  conspiracy exposing the planetary tyranny exposing the medical tyranny
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:11.360]  exposing the entire spectrum we're out front as a probe basically taking the
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:19.200]  main fire and every day comedy central fox entertainment new movies different
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.200]  celebrities say talking points alex jones is on cocaine alex jones where is
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:31.320]  a tenfold hat alex jones is racist alex jones hates black people alex jones
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:37.280]  hates jews blah blah blah alex jones the con artist alex jones is insane it is
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:44.840]  it is in newspapers I mean the guardian last week every day without looking they
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.960]  are attacking us and a talking point has gone out in fact I predict I predict
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.800]  that if we were able to get the information if I was if I was to sue
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.760]  david cross one of the most famous comedians in the US today I've been a
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:01.520]  fan I think his comedy is very very funny a lot of its eyebrow I predict that
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.600]  his film hits was actually paid product placement money that's how you fund most
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:11.680]  these films you know with Doritos or Bud Bud Bud Light ads but it came out years
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.720]  after I reported on in the Wall Street Journal what they call behavior placement
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.880]  I always called it for 15 20 years this is about 18 19 years now I always say 15
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:24.200]  or 20 but on there 20 so it's about about 18 years I coined the term
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:31.000]  propaganda placement and they call it behavior placement when they declassified
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.320]  it about five years ago but by declassification government admitted they
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.080]  were doing it but corporations do it even more they will pay to have someone
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.960]  attack the second amendment they will pay you to have someone say something
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.720]  negative about the founding fathers that's why you watch any TV show or any
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:54.840]  movie or any drama they are running down freedom they are attacking liberty they
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.960]  are attacking men every show you see almost every show the father is a fat
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:07.120]  lazy slob this isn't all out attack well now on a daily basis in just the last
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:14.680]  two days we've learned after mckelthalyn tweeted out a mainstream news article
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:22.240]  out of the major publication was this the Pittsburgh star the Indianapolis star
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:28.600]  fire VA manager who sent email mocking vet suicides that's them we have the
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.480]  email we know they're making fun of the dead vets we know they're on debt death
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:36.120]  list we've had VA whistleblowers on from the east coast I'll leave it at that one
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.720]  of the biggest hospitals where they openly make fun of them and and openly
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:44.120]  put them on death list before that ever broke in the news last year we had that
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:47.320]  not bragging this is why we're under attack I mean we really are reporting
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.760]  on stuff we're really standing up for human dignity we're really standing up
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.800]  for the veterans and and old people and and babies because what you do to the
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:00.360]  least of me you do to me what they do to the week they will end up doing to the
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:05.080]  strong and the basic instinct is defend the week or defend your veterans and
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.880]  matter of some of the wars they were in were evil you defend the people that had
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.100]  the will to go and believe they were fighting for the people but the
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:15.600]  globalists absolutely hate them and they hate us ladies and gentlemen because
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.960]  we are veterans of the info war and veterans are going up against this
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.360]  scum that is trying to cause a civil war and racial division and a war with the
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.880]  police that everybody seen with George Soros involved it's all the same usual
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.880]  suspects George Soros and the internet grab and the FCC George Soros and the
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.320]  open border grab George Soros and the attack the police garbage which they'll
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.160]  just militarize them more and turn them against the people which the globalists
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.640]  are trying they want us against each other so we just joined this Montel
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:51.640]  Williams came out yesterday the articles on info wars.com and he said
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:58.600]  Alex Jones inspires people to quote blow things up for us daring to send out a
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:07.480]  tweet with the Indianapolis star that's nothing other media outlets don't send
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:11.160]  out someone else's news article it's only about them we send everybody stuff
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:16.360]  out mainstream alternative we don't we just want to defeat the tyranny it just
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.200]  shows how twisted these people are and he goes on to say we're coke heads and
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:24.160]  everything else with no proof again because I have energy I must be on drugs
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:29.080]  you think I can have this much energy for 20 years and beyond drugs yeah I have
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:33.880]  two cups of coffee a day I drink some tea occasionally iced tea I drink some
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:40.480]  beer I don't even use nicotine products nothing nothing and you have the nerve
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.160]  to sit there and call me a drug addict because you're not man enough to stand
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.320]  up for humanity that is shameful Montel Williams now I can't believe both these
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:52.880]  people I like them of all those obnoxious talk show hosts Montel Williams
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.280]  seemed like he wanted to cover some good subjects I haven't watched the show but
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.840]  maybe 20 times over the last 30 years that's still a lot now somebody I did
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.000]  like was David Cross very funny comedian top 10 comedian in the US in the
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.160]  top 10 he put out a movie that's now making the rounds that we just learned
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:20.760]  of called hits and it's directed by him and I bet my bottom dollar I'm not
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:26.440]  accusing him of this like he just makes them about me it's a movie you know
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:31.400]  basically demonizing grassroots organizations protesters and it's got
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.160]  all these protesters the city hall protesting all the hippies supporting
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.240]  this guy that's leading them who's just kind of a regular you know guy who's
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.160]  kind of falling down and then he goes into and I'll you know and and it's the
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:48.080]  Jews and blah blah blah and the n-word Alex Jones told me all this I learned
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.680]  this from Alex Jones now folks that's the opposite of what he would have
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:57.080]  learned from Alex Jones so someone smart like David Cross shows what an
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:04.440]  incredibly slimy nasty person he is because I bet money he was paid again
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:14.080]  I'm not saying this that I know it but I know how media works I bet I bet him
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:20.560]  $5,000 that if he can show me his funding sheet and show me the documents
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.400]  because they'll be an official sheet you know that shows who would product
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.480]  placements I bet it's even in the credits may not say what they paid for
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.320]  we need to look at the credits of this film I bet money he was paid or they
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.800]  told him we'll distribute your film but attack the Liberty Movement because
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:39.320]  that's what the whole film basically is about and so that's where all this is
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:43.240]  going imagine someone that's ever heard I mean the movie prisoners comes out and
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:48.160]  the child molester kidnapper is named Alex Jones and people are noticing that
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.840]  bad guys are named Alex Jones now all over the place just a month ago there
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.640]  was some other TV show I'll pop my head in a minute where the bad guys named
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.880]  Alex Jones or where they make fake websites that look exactly like my site
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:03.320]  talking about crazy stuff and they implant it subliminally on Comedy Central
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.000]  I mean there's so much of this we can't even keep track of it and again it's
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.680]  happening because we will hold up the vaccine insert where it says for MMR it
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.120]  can give you epilepsy or diabetes or pancreatitis or kill you I mean they
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:20.120]  just can't have that I don't debate them on their fake level I just bypassed
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:24.560]  their fake debates and go right to the documentation and if and if the way we
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.960]  do things just straight shooting people start spreading folks it's over for
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:33.160]  them now let's go to this clip we've bleeped out the n-word but everything
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.400]  else is edited because they would go on the news and say that I'm saying the
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.480]  n-word that's how deceptive this gun is and listen they assassinate your
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.720]  character before they kill you okay and I have to be honest I'm not being
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.000]  dramatic an attack of this level on a daily basis across media spectrums

[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.840]  because I know that I'm standing up for the unborn and the innocence and
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.040]  everybody else and not because I'm a hero because I'm a regular guy we're gonna
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.200]  skip this network breaks we have plenty of time to play this club but this this
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:30.160]  is praise the Lord folks this is this is thank God because I've prayed to God

[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.360]  your children and their children and their children we are all together we
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:55.080]  are all one we are all one together and I you know what I forgive you Montel
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:59.320]  Williams you must really need money and I mean this sincerely from my heart not
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:03.240]  to look like the better man and the same thing for David Cross you're a
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:09.240]  talented good person and it's so sad to see you fall so low and to slander and
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:15.660]  to debase and to def try to defame someone like myself you have defamed
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:23.520]  yourself and it's bad luck man you know lying about somebody that's trying to
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.760]  be good lying about somebody who's been persecuted trying to lie to people out
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.040]  there to turn them away from the truth to turn them away from trying to heal
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:37.520]  our land you really have joined with evil and I think God's gonna punish you
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:43.040]  for it if you don't repent so we need to pray for Montel Williams and David
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:49.240]  Cross that God humbled them and that God show them his true power and bring
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:56.840]  them to their knees because this whole army of sellouts that would that would
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:00.840]  not just join with the system but that would premeditatively try to make
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:05.880]  people think that I don't like black people when all I try to do is save the
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:12.840]  unborn I don't care whether they're black or white to lie about me when you
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:17.280]  know I'm trying to bring people together you don't hurt me with your fake
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.960]  political correctness you hurt yourself and I pray that every weapon formed
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.120]  against us will not prosper and I know that will be true I mean I'm not stupid
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.640]  if they physically kill me it will only make everything I've done a hundred
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:38.760]  times stronger that's why they haven't done it the Lord works in mysterious
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:46.880]  ways and I want everybody to pray pray with me that men who are talented and
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.920]  smart and who we can't judge we don't know their hearts we don't know their
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:56.640]  evil but have been deceived or twisted or manipulated into lying about good
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.240]  people and trying to hurt innocence that might find the truth I just pray that
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:07.680]  their hearts be changed and I pray that God show them his incredible power and I
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:15.880]  pray it happens I pray it happens today pray with me pray women these men like
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:25.400]  Saul on the road to Damascus be humbled you sign on to destroy what we're trying
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:32.320]  to do you've signed on to the greatest evils the world has ever seen you serve
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.800]  the New World Order with your heart and your will and your mind you have turned
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:43.840]  yourself over directly to Satan you are riding in the car with the devil and
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:48.080]  because the things I talk about challenge your whole world view that's
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.160]  why you attack me and lie about me and lie about everything we do at M4 Wars
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:59.000]  because you know deep down it's true you're smart men you're just two
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.160]  examples of the latest where you're attempting to inoculate the public the
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.600]  poison and lies against the name Alex Jones and I've explained this to the
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:14.440]  listeners a hundred times they want to bring me down not because I'm the
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:19.040]  greatest guy or I'm the hero but because I'm somebody willing to step across the
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.760]  line first against the enemy and if others follow it's over for them I'm
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:28.760]  sincere the enemy has assessed me years ago and they know I'm real and that
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:35.360]  spirit is what threatens them the flesh and the simple person I am and the
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.960]  simple person you are are failed and are wicked but the spirit in us that God
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:47.520]  made when it points towards God like a flower opening the Sun is unstoppable you
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:51.640]  have to realize how epic this battle is this great test you're only alive once

[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.640]  piece let me set it up for radio listeners our radio listeners go to

[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.000]  can come listen to us and find out the truth and find out why they were
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.040]  probably paid to do this government spends hundreds of billions of dollars
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:50.080]  in the last decade with fake news and paying people to put out fake information
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:54.800]  and demonization campaigns there's no way that every day major media is
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.040]  attacking us with the same lies out of the clear blue sky this is a talking
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:02.920]  point I watch media matters put out lies against us overtly run by the White
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:08.400]  House and then within hours I see it mimicked everywhere what does it mean
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.040]  that the White House has their guns swung around on us it means they're weak
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:20.160]  means they're evil it means we're right it means they're pathetic if if we this

[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:55.280]  scientists together organized you know how hard that is send letters saying
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.240]  remove hydrofluorosalic acid it gives you cancer and brain damages and attacks
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:04.920]  of thyroid can you imagine the time bomb they're sitting on after they put this
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.720]  in the water and killed tens of millions with it but the cancer is alone in the
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:16.240]  bone cancer alone tens of millions can you up since the 40s can you imagine see

[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:25.520]  right now ladies and gentlemen the spirit of awakening is here and we're
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:32.000]  only a tiny detonator I'm like a little bitty cap on the back of a huge shell

[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:44.120]  just a detonator I'm little you're little but together we chain reaction

[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.760]  to once we admit it's scary it's not scary anymore because now we're not
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.480]  subconsciously oppressed and afraid with the messages of the new order
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.440]  menacing us the inside the subliminals are we're gonna kill you where the new
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.040]  order do we say where's no new world order on the surface so that we stay

[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:25.200]  go to that clip of the demonization from the head got Portlandia mr. show you
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:29.800]  name and he's behind it now put not movies that end with the fact that Alex
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.960]  Jones is causing a rebellion Alex Jones is really a closet racist fooling the
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.840]  hippies the hippies are all cheering the Alex Jones character until he admits
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.760]  he's really a racist here it is well guess who's feeling ridiculous now
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:50.920]  miss concerta cuz cuz I have the whole town and TV and the entire internet
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:26:03.720]  and I'm trying to see redress from his elected officials I am trying to write
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:09.600]  a wrong time thank you miss you know I have more to say that is all the time
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.600]  you have no you will let me speak
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:24.600]  we're in the U.S. Constitution doesn't say that people only get three minutes to speak
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:28.600]  ask your lawyer that, ask your lawyer that
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:33.600]  and I will have the rest of you thrown out for public disturbance
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.600]  and it's because of those Jews who run that stupid ACLU and they won't return my letters
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:43.600]  cuz they're too busy defending all the scum of the earth like gays and Muslims
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:48.600]  that is wide enough and it's cuz you are taking marching orders from Barack Obama
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:54.600]  that socialist b***h in the White House yes you are you are being bullied by him
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:02.100]  and I don't even support him officially Barack is a Jewish word and it means
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:09.360]  lightning in the Bible Luke supporting came down as lightning Satan will come
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:16.640]  down as lightning that's in the Bible I wanted a record I wanted a record day
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:22.120]  new and all the liberal all the liberal Jew run media and their neighbors they
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:26.280]  are authorizing a court for the lead in this game don't make it I heard that on
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:33.280]  Alex Jones so it's true I heard it on Alex Jones so I know it's true you're the father
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.280]  of Mr. Turner you would go global warming and global warming is such a problem
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:43.280]  how come my street had snow all over it for an entire winter how come
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:48.280]  okay I am talking now the police dragging out so let's just stop right there
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.280]  we're gonna do a whole article on this tomorrow and we'll put my response and video in here
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.280]  so people understand what we're dealing with but this is criminal propaganda
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:01.280]  there is no doubt that a jury would not award me damages when I took him to trial
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:06.280]  and they got to subpoena me I subpoena them depositions and we could show that
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.280]  I never said any of this and then he literally tried to defame me and hurt me
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:14.280]  there but you know what David Cross I'm not gonna do that you have defamed
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:21.280]  yourself you are a liar and you have basically already given me satisfaction
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.280]  I don't need to take you out the street politically and flog you
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:32.280]  but I'm really sad for you you know why they did this probably paid product placement
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:38.280]  propaganda placement they did this because I'm addressing the fact that the
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:42.280]  so-called liberal establishment are a bunch of warmongering NSA loving power
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:47.280]  grabbing insurance company criminals with a with Obamacare and the rest of it
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:51.280]  that that the Democratic leadership fascistically works with the Republican
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.280]  leadership to screw this country over by the very same bankers looting Greece
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:00.280]  and Portugal and Brazil and Nigeria and Ireland and everywhere else and we're
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:04.280]  coming together globally with solidarity for real freedom and true liberalism
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.280]  like Thomas Jefferson promoted the liberalism of teaching women how to use guns
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:11.280]  and protect themselves the liberalism of let you keep more of your money
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.280]  the liberalism of having sovereignty and honoring and loving humanity
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:22.280]  not loving all this tyranny you are a bunch of fashionable fops a bunch of fake
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:26.280]  trendy liberals who aren't liberals at all you're a bunch of totalitarians
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:30.280]  promoting anti-speech laws and every other form of garbage you want to run
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:35.280]  everybody's lives and bully everyone you're having to resort to lying about
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:40.280]  people like me that are real liberals compared to propagandists like you
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:47.280]  you have now discredited yourselves you are now jokes to apologize this is shame

[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:14.280]  Jones show because there's a war on for your mind five the Democratic Party
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.280]  and the Republicans are hardly corrupt as well come out of the same group the
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:21.280]  Democratic Party though was the party of the Klan they were the party of racial
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:25.280]  division when the demographics change in Eisenhower and the Republicans passed
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:29.280]  the civil rights act they were going to be doomed because the minorities were
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.280]  voting 90% back then I mean Martin Luther King back at that point was voting
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:38.280]  Republican on record so they had big big problems so they completely flipped
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:41.280]  and said oh we love the minorities we're going to give you freebies we're going
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:46.280]  to give you welfare and that was when basically they checked the Republicans
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:52.280]  so the Republicans went with the southern strategy and flipped in the south
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:55.280]  because there was already some Republicans didn't like what Eisenhower was doing
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.280]  in the north and they did kind of become you know a little bit racist party so
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.280]  so that's true they were trying to then flip sides and act like the Democrats
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:08.280]  but the real roots the Democratic Party folks Margaret Sanger David Rockefeller
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:11.280]  they said we've got to be fake liberals we've got to lead the blacks we can kill
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:16.280]  these weeds now those are quotes God awards from Hitler gave awards from Hitler
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:22.280]  I'm talking about Rockefeller's daddy I'm talking about Thomas Watson I'm
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:26.280]  talking about Margaret Sanger I mean Thomas Watson got the highest Nazi
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:34.280]  award ever given the highest Nazi award ever given created by Adolf Hitler
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:41.280]  the iron cross first class with four Eagles he basically gave him all his money
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:45.280]  the death camps everything the computers and the numbers that now they run the
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:51.280]  death list for the veterans cannot make that up the computers called Thomas cannot
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.280]  how about the symbol be an iron cross with four Eagles on it so this is why
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.280]  they hate my guts we pioneered before it was in the London Guardian before it
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:04.280]  was in the New York Times that Brown Brother Harriman funded the Nazis we
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.280]  pioneered the documents with Anthony Sutton before he died that came out in
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.280]  Congress secretly in the 70s and then we covered it all in the 90s and in
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.280]  mainline what later all came out and Oliver Stones made documentaries about
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:24.280]  we pioneered it in films like martial law 2004 I'm not bragging but I mean we
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:29.280]  pioneered exposing Nazis we pioneered exposing eugenics and how it's under
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:34.280]  the surface we pioneered showing off 52% of black people are never born I mean if
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:38.280]  I was a racist I'd be oh I'm liberal oh yeah black people I love you you have
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:43.280]  your right to abortion sweetie I'd be oh Gardis feels good for the Mexican girls
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:50.280]  take your shots but I don't need to defend myself that I'm not a racist they
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.280]  beat you over the head and say three meals a day you're racist don't vote for
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.280]  Obama your racist don't turn your guns in your racist it's all their attempt at
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:02.280]  bullying I want to get into the second amendment news and a little bit more
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:06.280]  here and then I'm gonna throw the baton to there's what's the point of going a
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.280]  couple days vacation if you don't take the kids to the beach and they want to
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.280]  go see some of the military bases and stuff around here that are open so a
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:18.280]  lot of cool aircraft and things flying around down here but my son's off DC
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:24.280]  fishing with my dad right now but gosh it's just so desperate and so
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:29.280]  disreputable and so dirty I mean it's just when you catch people out in the
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:36.280]  open I say catch them just just absolutely you know lying that were racist
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:44.280]  cocads they want to blow up buildings and hate black people and Jews and then
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:49.280]  you go to the all the Nazi websites I mean go to any of the biggest ones and I
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:54.280]  am the number one enemy and it's because at the top folks those places are a
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.280]  hundred percent government run I mean if you won't if you want to create
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:04.280]  opposition to control it you got to have it be unsavory and hateful so that
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:08.280]  anybody that ever criticizes Israel's manipulation of US politics looks like
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:12.280]  a total idiot that's what's going on because I have real criticisms of Israel
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:15.280]  but it's not because you know there's Jews in Israel it's because governments
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:20.280]  get corrupted out of control but I don't hate Israel and see people know that
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:26.280]  I don't hate white people black people Hispanics mixed race anybody I hate
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.280]  tyrants and criminals and bullies and there are gangs and bullies everywhere
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.280]  I like police departments that are upstanding follow the Constitution
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:37.280]  I don't like departments that are bully thug run I like black people I don't
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.280]  like five black guys walking by if I'm walking by myself and saying what are
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:45.280]  you doing cracker want to get your ass handed to you go ahead and do
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.280]  something and I grew up in Dallas Texas folks I mean I have been racially
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:53.280]  harassed I guarantee you you watch these movies with black people back in the
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.280]  south in the 50s and 60s getting beat up and attacked that's just what racist
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:01.280]  gangs do to each other folks there were always huge majorities of Christian
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:03.280]  whites that weren't involved in any of that and hated and fought it you'd
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.280]  believe watching political correctness today that every white person out there
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:13.280]  was involved in all that it doesn't matter that my grandfather ran as a
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:18.280]  Republican and when everybody else were Democrats in one office in East Texas
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:24.280]  and fought for you know civil rights doesn't matter I am a racist because
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.280]  David Cross said so and I don't like Jews either doesn't matter both my
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:34.280]  grandfather's almost died in World War two fighting Hitler David Cross says
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:38.280]  I don't like Jews and David Cross is a little simpering funny know-it-all guy
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:42.280]  that wears little sweaters and gets to go so he gets to lie about people he
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:48.280]  gets to defame people he gets to prey on people prey on his viewers
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:56.280]  and they've now got comic teams around the country that go around and make
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.280]  fun of myself and Jesse Ventura and say things we didn't say that are
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:03.280]  involved it turned out we just looked it up on his payroll see we're going to
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.280]  follow this and find the money and how are people going to feel if we find if
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:12.280]  we find bears crapping in the woods if we find fish in the sea that this was
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:20.280]  financed by an agency or a Ford Foundation a George Soros what's going to
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:26.280]  happen when we find that everybody's going to know you're a little
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:29.280]  government operative you like a little secret agent meetings you go to a
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:34.280]  little infra-guard meetings feel pretty powerful Southern Parvy Law Center got
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:37.280]  you some funding oh I wonder what we're going to find when we crawl into that
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:42.280]  rock down there with you we're going to find that Democratic Party right back
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:47.280]  to Margaret Sanger oh I know and the Nazis calling for my death all the time
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:52.280]  those let's go to David Knight David Knight a few minutes here and I'm going
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:55.280]  to throw the baton to you what is your take on this attack I mean it's just
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:00.280]  daily now I tell you it makes the hair shampoo back in my neck that's kind of
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:03.280]  an exciting feeling David but I can really feel the eyes Soran's looking
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:08.280]  right at us yeah Alex when I look at what happened with Montel Williams
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:13.280]  yesterday he's gone in the past and he's defended the veteran Tamerusi who went
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.280]  over the the line there Mexico and was being treated fairly there but when it
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.280]  comes to the way our government treats people here he has no problem with it
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:27.280]  and on a day when we've got a stream article about how they're making fun of
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.280]  veterans dying I mean why are we bad to do that I just why would he pick that
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.280]  I'm sorry go ahead yeah exactly if he's concerned as a veteran he's a veteran
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:39.280]  if he's concerned about the welfare veterans why wouldn't he notice that
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.280]  they're being mistreated severely mistreated by the veterans administration
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:48.280]  that we've had people at the VA come in repeatedly and say you know showing that
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:53.280]  they have contempt for these people and on a day when Hillary Clinton is caught
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:59.280]  in ridiculous ludicrous lies about emailing Bill about how she set up a
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:03.280]  private email server because it was more convenient to set up an entire server
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.280]  in her house she did that because of convenience she said that she was using
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:11.280]  it to email Bill and two hours Alex before she made this pronouncement at
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:15.280]  the United Nations Security Council Wall Street Journal had interviewed
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:20.280]  somebody who was a spokesperson for Bill Clinton and he said he's done two emails
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:25.280]  his entire life she didn't have time to incorporate that lie into her speech so
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:29.280]  she got caught red-handed but of course Montell Williams had nothing to say about
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.280]  that yesterday instead of the jack with this argument.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.280]  McHale failing tweet at real Alex Jones saying hey look mainstream news
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.280]  reporting on what we reported on that the veterans gonna make it fun of them when
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:43.280]  they die and then he comes out and attacks us I mean what type of sickness is
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:47.280]  that yeah by the way Montell Williams doesn't he have some neurological disorder
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.280]  I bet he got that from all the vaccines he was given.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:55.280]  I don't know about Montell Williams when I saw this Twitter fight he has multiple
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:01.280]  screws I asked I asked my son I said yeah I'm sorry I saw this Twitter fight
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:06.280]  my son said who is Montell Williams I said I barely know it was somebody that
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:09.280]  was around 20 years and they're in their 20s they're mid 20s I mean nobody even
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:14.280]  knows who this guy is. The point is why point is it's part of the larger pattern
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:19.280]  why would David Cross with the movie with his HBO shows and everything else
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.280]  I mean we're seeing this this attack where they where they have villains say
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.280]  I follow Alex Jones like trying to just classically at a Pavlovian level
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.280]  shock someone whenever they hear my name I mean it is a very primitive but
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.280]  systematic attack and it's clearly being directed David.
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.280]  Oh yeah and you saw a very directed orchestrated attack against Gary Webb
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:44.280]  and a lot of people I'd encourage people to go see the movie Shoot the Messenger
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.280]  at first he was going to get a Pulitzer prize he was worthy of it and he did
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.280]  all this research and then the mainstream media came back and started
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.280]  attacking him on a personal level and then after a number of years I believe
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:59.280]  and as you do that you talk to him just before he died he was not committing
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:01.280]  suicide he was suicided.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:05.280]  I probably just want to pull it sir maybe they pulled it back or maybe I know
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:09.280]  he won a bunch of awards but I mean I know he was he was going to present on
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:14.280]  our website all his documents that he was putting in the new book and he was
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:17.280]  so excited and then a month later he's dead and I talked to his friends he goes
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:21.280]  yeah he had to move they're breaking in his house they're stealing his stuff
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:25.280]  they stole his motorcycle and they did that I mean folks he was being
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:29.280]  harassed and threatened I mean you go see the movie I saw the movie I was
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:33.280]  nauseated because it was like a documentary it was like it was so accurate
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:36.280]  I thank you so much David you're going to be taken over in the next segment we're
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.280]  going to be throwing it to a report here in a moment from John Bowne on the

[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:14.280]  piece in the next segment but you heard all the you saw the articles last week
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:19.280]  BBC London Telegraph Associated Press Time Magazine has a new one out today
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.280]  or is it Newsweek it's here in my stack oh I have the bullet story I need to hit
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.280]  all of that's going on and they're saying life of states if you have life of
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.280]  state in the water which is in almost all U.S. water something like 95% five
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:36.280]  fold increase in kidney failure it will kill your kidneys really weed killer's
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:41.280]  not good for my kidneys you mean my kidneys can't process weed killer you
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:47.280]  mean my kidneys can't process antifreeze either while maybe Montel Williams
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:51.280]  will attack me because I'm telling you that and yeah I like to sell things on
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:55.280]  the truth win-win I drink nothing but high quality filter water you can't
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:59.280]  trust most of the bottle of water propure G2 cuts out almost all the fluoride
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:02.280]  almost nothing out there cuts a hundred percent out but it cuts out we've got
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.280]  the tests all listed from where we had them tested on info wars store.com
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:10.280]  it's like 99 point something and you just see hundreds of chemicals and things
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:19.280]  99.9 99.7 99.99 100 I mean yeah it just reduces it almost down to nothing
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:24.280]  with this gravity-fed systems and we've got a whole other line of clearly
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:29.280]  filters you know it only cuts out like 98 97 depending on which filter you get
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.280]  reverse osmosis only gets out 99% but cuts out all the good minerals and stuff
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:38.280]  you need and I still use that for cooking so I do a mix of things I do some
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:42.280]  high quality bottled water that's hadn't even from Arkansas I know it's done
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:45.280]  nothing's been done to to get minerals the point is do a mix in my view I've
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:50.280]  done research with doctors and others it is so important to get the filters

[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:43.280]  didn't break them they understood it was a long-term fight towards Washington
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:47.280]  hardly ever won a battle but fought for seven years one they're just letting

[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:14.360]  In 1814 we took a little trip along the Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi. We took
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:18.520]  a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:22.240]  New Orleans. We fired our guns and the British kept becoming.
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:27.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here in the InfoWars News Studio in
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:31.840]  Austin. We're going to go to John Bounds Report. If you go to our website, you'll see a graphic
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:36.440]  up there with a quote from Hillary Clinton. We are losing, it says, and there's a picture
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.560]  of Hillary Clinton with a photoshopped Pinocchio nose. I'm sure if she had a real Pinocchio
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:44.800]  nose she would say, it's not a Pinocchio nose. I'm not lying, it's just rehearsing for the
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:50.000]  role of Cyrano de Bergerac. But she is losing. She knows that they're losing and one of the
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.480]  biggest losses yesterday happened as she's giving her long speech at the UN defending
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:04.160]  her practices of having a private email server located in her home because it was more convenient.
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.360]  Yeah, more convenient to escape scrutiny. Now while she was talking about that and she
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:13.960]  goes on to say, yeah, and you know I get all these emails from Bill all the time, just
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:20.000]  before that happened, just before she said it. The Wall Street Journal was talking to
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.760]  his spokesperson and the spokesperson said this. The former President, Bill Clinton,
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:31.960]  who does regularly use Twitter has sent a grand total of two emails during his entire life.
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:37.760]  Both of those as president, said his spokesman, Matt McKenna. After leaving office, Mr. Clinton
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:42.920]  established his own domain that staff use, he said. But Mr. Clinton still doesn't use
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:47.880]  email himself. It was very interesting. I saw that right away on Fox News when they
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:52.440]  came back after broadcasting her speech and the reporter who was on the beat said that,
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:55.840]  pointed that out right away. And of course, Shepard Smith was in the studio and he said,
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:01.400]  yeah, but you know, well, he's trying to defend Hillary Clinton. Shepard Smith, he says, well,
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:05.080]  maybe Bill Clinton doesn't send any emails, but maybe he was getting all these emails
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:09.200]  from Hillary Clinton. He's like, Bologna, you either use email or you don't use email.
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:13.920]  You don't need to try to defend the Clintons. But it just illustrates, as they always say,
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:19.280]  what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive. There you go. That's Hillary Clinton.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:24.240]  Let's go to John Bounds report on that. She's trying to flush her past down the memory hole.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:47.520]  Work. Here's John Bounds report. Hillary Rodham Clinton, mystery woman, first, first lady to
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:53.200]  be under criminal investigation inundated by scandals from Little Rock, Arkansas to Washington,
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:58.240]  D.C. The Clintons squeaked by Kenneth Starr's lengthy investigation into what is now known
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:04.160]  as the Whitewater scandal, a shady real estate deal the Clintons were never prosecuted for,
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:09.200]  although their associates were convicted of federal fraud and conspiracy charges.
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:13.760]  During the first year of Bill Clinton's tenure in the White House, they fired seven employees
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:19.280]  with the White House travel office in order to reward their friends with jobs. Travelgate
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:24.480]  erupted, and the Clinton's personal lawyer and deputy White House counsel, a man Hillary
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:31.440]  regularly abused, supposedly committed suicide, over having to testify, knowing full well
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:36.320]  all of Hillary's devious secret pathways to power. Hillary lied under oath to the office
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:42.080]  of independent counsel, claiming the last time she spoke with Foster was before Father's Day,
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:47.920]  when in fact Vince Foster's assistant had seen her with Foster four times after that date.
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:54.880]  Patrick Knowlton and eyewitness saw men in red vests fleeing the area before Foster's body was
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:58:00.400]  discovered. Fast forward to today, Hillary's private emails were all transmitted on a private
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:06.640]  server registered to her home in Chippaqua, New York, while she was acting as a secretary of state
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:11.920]  that oversaw the overthrow of Gaddafi, the Syrian civil war, the turmoil in Egypt and
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:17.360]  the Benghazi scandal. Ironically President Obama signed a law last November that requires
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:21.920]  government officials to direct their official correspondence through private email to a
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:27.600]  government account. Earlier today, Hillary gave a speech about women's rights at the United Nations.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:32.720]  Hillary addressed her globalist new world order cohorts from a room in the United States where
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.800]  press freedom is heavily restricted. Okay, that's all the time we've got for that now, but you can
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:47.600]  see that on top of the page at info-worse.com. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN Live.com today.

[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:34.000]  the bottom of the hour as well. And of course, as Alex Jones pointed out in the last half hour
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:41.360]  when he was with us, when the ATF walked away from this framework to start banning ammunition.
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:46.800]  And that's what they're trying to do. They're trying to come up. The framework is a rationalization to
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:51.840]  ban particular types of ammunition. And once they create this quote unquote framework,
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:57.840]  they're going to come after every kind of ammunition one by one. But they backed off.
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:02.640]  This particular time, the opposition was overwhelming. So they backed off early. They
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:07.200]  had till the 16th to take comments. And they've already shut this thing down and said,
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:10.400]  we're going to go back. We're going to take another look at this and we'll come back with
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:14.160]  something that's more responsible. But we're listening to you. They want to try to placate
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:17.920]  people, as Alex Jones said. But of course, they are going to be back. And we need to get even
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:22.880]  tougher with them next time. The price of liberty is eternal vigilance. And this time,
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:28.160]  everybody was vigilant. Everybody responded en masse. And we can back down the government
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:32.160]  if we do that consistently. But understand the government is also going to come back.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:35.520]  And of course, in the last segment, we were just playing John Bowns report,
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:40.160]  which you can see at the top of infowars.com, as well as on our YouTube channel.
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:46.720]  Talking about Hillary Clinton trying to run from her past. She's trying to flush these emails down
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:54.800]  the memory hole. Very, very amusing to watch her get caught red-handed in a lie. Just as one story
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.680]  is coming out from the Wall Street Journal saying that Bill Clinton has never, ever used emails.
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:05.200]  He's done twice and they named the two times said only within his presidency. She's saying that she
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:10.240]  needs this private server to communicate with Bill Clinton. It's like, yeah, right. And of course,
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:14.560]  you've got people like Montell Williams who can't be bothered to look at that. Instead,
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:18.960]  he's going to go after Alex Jones. But there's a lot of commentary about this. Of course, one of
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:24.480]  the things that happened as she was feeling questions from people, she refused to answer
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:29.840]  really the toughest questions. This is an article on WorldNet Daily talking about Matt Drudge and
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:35.680]  what he tweeted out. He said, Hillary totally effed it up. Yeah, she did. She got caught red-handed
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:39.760]  yesterday. But she refused to answer the three toughest questions. Here's the questions that
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:45.520]  she would not answer. Number one, would she have an independent arbiter look at her private email
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:51.920]  server? No, she's just going to send these things out and tell us that she disclosed everything.
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:56.560]  We'll just have to take her word for it. Number two, what links would she go to to prove that
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:01.760]  she did not delete emails? Again, we'll just have to take her word on it because she's so
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:06.880]  trustworthy. We got caught red-handed in a lie yesterday. Number three, did she clear the
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:12.240]  server with the State Department security officials or with anyone for that matter?
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:16.960]  And of course, the answer to that is no. Everybody knows what this woman is about.
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:22.240]  Saturday Night Live also commented on it. Not only Matt Drudge, but Saturday Night Live had
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:26.960]  something on Hillary Clinton and the email controversy. This was up on CNN. We're not
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:31.360]  going to play the video for you. But this is what they said. They had somebody impersonating Hillary
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:37.600]  Clinton and the actor said, those emails are as clean as a whistle. This is not how Hillary
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:42.720]  Clinton goes down. And it was an actress named McKinnon. And they said her wild-eyed Clinton
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:49.600]  said, laughing at the idea that the emails would be her undoing. Yeah, exactly. This
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:55.360]  is the candidate of the big bankers. This is the candidate of the military industrial complex.
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:04:00.000]  This is the woman who is saying that she is standing up for women's rights, giving a speech
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.360]  at the United Nations yesterday about women's rights while she's taking massive amounts of money
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:11.360]  from the most oppressive regimes against all human rights, but particularly against women.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:15.360]  Singling out women, these oppressive Islamic regimes that attack women,
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:22.080]  unbelievable what they do to women. And of course, she takes massive amounts of money from them.
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:28.240]  She's going to be in their pocket. An election is an advanced auction of stolen goods. She's
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:32.160]  going to be stealing those goods from you. And she's going to be handing them to Saudi Arabia,
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:36.960]  to Bahrain, to these other people that she's taking massive amounts of money to. She's also
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:43.280]  going to be handing it to the bankers. And when we come back, I'm going to give you proof that the
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:50.000]  bankers are starting war. So we're going to talk about Obama's executive order declaring Venezuela
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.840]  a security threat to the United States and what's behind that. The bankers stay with us. We'll be
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:54.240]  right back.

[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:11.680]  probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:18.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Niles in studio March 11th, 2015. Of course,
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:23.600]  we've been talking in the last hour to Alex Jones who is on the road. He came in and hosted the last
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:30.720]  hour. We have had a victory and I'll call it a victory when the ATF backs down five days early
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:36.400]  from their proposed ammunition ban. It's just a victory in a battle. It's not a victory in the
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:42.000]  war. The war is not over. The war against the Second Amendment, against all of our God-given
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.360]  rights that are guaranteed in the Constitution, that war will continue. We can't rest on our
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:53.520]  laurels. The price of liberty, of course, is eternal vigilance. Look at the way this kind of unfolded
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:58.240]  too. There's a good article we cover. We have an article up on infowars.com. Steve Watson,
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:03.120]  there's also an article I talked about earlier from gun owners of America. They said, of course,
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:10.000]  gun owners had until March 16th to send comments to the ATF about the banning of AR-15 ammunition.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.720]  But of course, they learned that it had already been banned when we saw the regulations there
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:20.720]  because they had removed the exemption of that ammunition. Back in 1986, they passed a law saying
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:25.280]  they were going to protect the police. That was a justification for it. But it was basically a gun
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:29.040]  control measure, an incremental gun control measure. That's the way they do all these things.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:33.840]  And they said, the following things are banned, but we're going to exclude and then they specifically
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:37.440]  excluded things. That's the way our government operates, of course. That's why you don't have
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:41.920]  rights, but you have privileges that are granted to you by the government. That's the way they
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:48.080]  maintain it. They say that everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted. And so what they did
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:53.840]  was I said, well, everything is prohibited, but we're going to expressly permit. And then they
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:59.840]  had AR-15 ammunition. Well, they removed that from their new regulations. When people noticed
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:03.280]  that and pointed it out, they'd say, hey, you've got a comment period that's not supposed to end
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:07.840]  until March 16th, but you've published regulations that have already removed that exemption. You've
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:15.920]  already banned it. And they said, oh, that was just a publishing error. The error was in putting,
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.240]  not in publishing it, but the error was in telling people what they were going to do ahead of time.
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:24.640]  And there might have been a publishing error. Maybe the people, the printers, didn't get the
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:28.720]  notice that they were supposed to hold that for a little bit longer before they put it out.
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:33.680]  It's that kind of deception that they're going to come back with. And so the war is not over,
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:37.520]  but we have won a battle and we should celebrate that victory. And we should learn from that,
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:42.080]  that if we speak up en masse, we can shut these people down just as we were talking about it
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:46.720]  yesterday. That's what happened at the Bundy Ranch. And that was just one incident. And again,
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:52.080]  they come back again. It's not going to stop it, but it's the way we push this thing back. Now,
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:57.040]  I said, as we were talking about Hillary Clinton and about the lie that she caught caught in
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:02.000]  yesterday, of course, she is the candidate that the big money is lining up behind them,
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.800]  the Democrat side. And of course, on the Republican side, the big money is lining up behind Jeb Bush.
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:11.040]  It's an election as an advanced auction of stolen goods, as H. L. Meakin said.
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:13.440]  They're going to steal the money from you. They're going to hand it to the bankers.
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:16.400]  They're going to hand it to the military industrial complex. That's why they're pushing for
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:24.880]  wars. We had a report yesterday on infowars.com. Kurt Nemo, Obama signs executive order declaring
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:32.000]  that Venezuela is a national security threat. How is Venezuela a national security threat,
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.600]  you might ask? Do they have intercontinental ballistic missiles? No. Do they have a massive
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:42.480]  air force? No. Do they have a massive army or navy that they could invade us with? No.
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:48.960]  No. Can they feed their people? No. They can't even feed their people. They don't even have water.
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:53.680]  They have to go across the border to get food and water. That was a report from about a year ago
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:59.600]  from Bloomberg saying, even though they're having severe shortages of food and water and medicine
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:06.240]  in Venezuela, we can count on them to make good on their bonds. They've been a real good investment
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:11.680]  for Wall Street. We've gotten nearly 700% return on investment. That was what Bloomberg was saying
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:18.080]  a year ago. So when I looked at this, I thought Obama says that Venezuela is a national security
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:25.760]  threat. How are they a national security threat? Maybe there's something about that 700% return
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:31.520]  on investment that isn't working out so good right now. I hadn't really been following what was going
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:36.800]  on with the Venezuelan bonds and maybe you haven't been following it either. But here's what I found.
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:45.040]  In February 12th, Reuters had this headline, pit hard in Venezuela, U.S. bond funds keep their
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:51.280]  nerve. And they say that what's happened is these U.S. Wall Street firms that have invested
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:56.160]  in Venezuela bonds because, of course, they've been a really good investment making 700% return
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:02.480]  from these communist leaders who are oppressing their people, not even capable of giving them
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:07.200]  food, water or medicine, but they're giving a 700% return to the bankers on Wall Street.
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:15.120]  Those funds that invested heavily into that had seen a 30% decline in their bonds value.
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:20.480]  So that was affecting their portfolio. They've always paid, but now these things are down 30%.
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:28.320]  Moody had downgraded Venezuela bonds in January. And the buzz on Wall Street is that they expect
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:34.160]  Venezuela to default on their bonds sometime this year. That would be about the time that
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:38.080]  I'm sure that Obama would come up with some justification to invade Venezuela
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:45.040]  so he can collect on the debt for the bankers on Wall Street. Now, there's another element to this
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:52.640]  as well. China is coming in. China has given $45 billion in loans and bonds to the Venezuelan
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:59.360]  government over the last 10 years. Why? Because China needs oil and Venezuela has lots of it.
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:04.480]  That's all they've got. So that's going on. That's one dimension of it. But the other dimension of
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:09.760]  it is the bankers. And, of course, the bankers don't want to get shoved out by Chinese investors.
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:16.400]  They want to get that oil because that's the only thing that they can get from Venezuela to pay off
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:22.880]  these bonds that they've given them. So what does Obama do? For the bankers, he declares that
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:29.360]  Venezuela is a national security threat. And I don't hear anybody in the mainstream laughing
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:34.080]  about that. And, you know, it's really not funny. I mean, it's absurd on the face of it,
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:39.760]  but that's the way we get into wars. We fight the wars for the bankers, for the military industrial
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:44.880]  complex, and that's why you've got hundreds of billions of dollars going to the Clintons,
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:50.000]  to Hillary Clinton and to Jeb Bush to run for president. They're protecting their investment.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.760]  It's an advanced auction of stolen goods, and they're not just stealing goods. They're going
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:59.680]  to steal your sons and your daughters' lives and their futures. That's what they're going to steal.
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:06.640]  Now, we've talked a lot about the surveillance state, and there's a lawsuit that has just come
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:11.680]  out from the ACLU, as well as Wikipedia, as well as someone else who talked to you. The
[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:17.280]  Rutherford Institute has been a frequent guest here on the Alex Jones show, suing the NSA.
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:20.720]  And again, the Department of Justice, because you know, the Department of Justice seems to always
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:26.880]  be involved in these criminal actions. It's always the DOJ. Even when we got Hillary Clinton with
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:33.360]  the email, we got Eric Holder. He also used email aliases. I don't think we can count on
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:38.960]  Eric Holder prosecuting Hillary Clinton because usually the Department of Justice are partners
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:42.320]  in these crimes. That's why nobody's getting prosecuted. That's why nobody's going to jail
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:48.000]  for breaking the law, because the Department of Justice is partnering with this criminal
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.920]  activity, with these lawsuits. And we've got another story that illustrates that as well.
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:57.840]  But in this particular one, we've got now Wikipedia, ACLU, and others suing the NSA,
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:01.840]  saying that the NSA's dragnet surveillance violates our First Amendment. Well, yes,
[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:06.240]  it does. It also violates our Fourth Amendment, prying into our person places without a search
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:11.360]  warrant. To me, that's the more obvious connection. This is what Wikipedia said. They said privacy
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:17.040]  is a bedrock of individual freedom. Principles that enable inquiry, dialogue, creation are
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:22.080]  central to Wikipedia's vision of empowering everyone to share in the sum of all human knowledge.
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:27.280]  In other words, what they're setting up is the basis for damages so that they can sue against this.
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:32.320]  Now, interestingly enough, this article from The New American points out the ACLU had attempted
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:39.280]  a lawsuit in 2013 against the NSA's warrantless wiretapping program. Look at this. But the Supreme
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:45.200]  Court rejected the case. Why? Because the plaintiffs couldn't provide sufficient proof they'd been
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:51.760]  spied on. How are you supposed to supply proof that you've been spied on when you can't get
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:55.920]  anything with a FOIA request? And if they send you something, everything is redacted. How do you
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:01.840]  prove that the East German police state has spied on you when the East German police state won't
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:08.240]  tell you what they've collected on you? I mean, this is absolute Kafka-esque. Oh, you know what?
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:14.320]  Look that up on Wikipedia while Wikipedia is still up. Find out about Kafka. Find out about the trial.
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:22.320]  Look that up on Wikipedia while Wikipedia sues the ACLU and the ACLU are suing the NSA. They're
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:27.040]  not going to be able to roll that back, I'm afraid. But I hope they do. I mean, they have violated not
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:31.920]  only our First Amendment, but they violated our Fourth Amendment. And one of the ways that they
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:37.760]  do it, of course, is with the Stingray program, where they set up these fake cell phone towers.
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:42.640]  This is one of the other things that I guess maybe the Montell Williams of the world want to scoff at
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:46.880]  about infowars. They say, hey, they got all these fake cell phone towers. We've been reporting on
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:51.840]  this for a couple of years, at least since I've been here, talking about the Stingray program.
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:56.640]  That is something that is a device that we've documented this. We've had different police
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:02.000]  departments be caught with FOIA requests, being caught in admissions that they are illegally
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:07.520]  spying in a dragnet manner on everybody with a cell phone. And of course, we've even had situations
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:12.400]  where the police, in order to prosecute somebody, wanted to use evidence that they had collected
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:19.360]  without a search warrant. And we have to maintain due process, even when we're going after criminals,
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:24.080]  or the government becomes criminal, and you have a much more dangerous situation than just
[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:29.600]  individual freelance criminals out there. When they organize as criminals, you've got organized crime
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:36.160]  as a government. So we have to keep them to the due process. Without a search warrant,
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:41.600]  they had gotten this information through the Stingray program. They wanted to admit it into court.
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:48.000]  The defense lawyer protested against that, and they wanted to see what this device was that
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.480]  they had. And the police department refused to give it to the judge saying, we have a non-disclosure
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:58.000]  agreement. And he says, you don't have a non-disclosure agreement with me. And so what they did was
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  they let the criminal walk free because they would not show the information that they had
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.160]  collected because they had a non-disclosure agreement with Harris, saying they couldn't
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:12.160]  talk about the program. Now we learn from the Wall Street Journal. This is not us. This is
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:16.960]  the Wall Street Journal. This is mainstream news. Montell, you can count on this, okay? This is for
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:21.120]  you, Montell. Wall Street Journal source now. We've been talking about this for several years.
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:26.560]  Now they found that the source of all of these Stingray programs, and they don't mention Stingray
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:31.760]  in the Wall Street Journal program, but Stingray is the name of the program, the name of the devices
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:38.320]  that are produced by Harris Semiconductor. If it's not that, then it works exactly that. Now we
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:45.200]  find out that the CIA has been behind this. And guess who they're working with? The U.S.
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:49.920]  Martial Service, a division of the Department of Justice. We're going to talk about that as we
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:54.480]  come back. Now we've got the CIA and the Department of Justice violating the Constitution, violating
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:57.040]  your laws, spying on people, dragnet. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:04.480]  It's happening again. The feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor. In January,

[02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:19.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, March 11th, 2015. I'm David Knight.
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:22.640]  I'll be hosting the rest of this hour. I'm going to take your calls in the next segment
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:27.200]  after I go over a couple of more news articles I'd like to talk about and we can talk about
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:32.640]  those news articles. You can talk about the ammo ban, the lawsuit by the ACLU and Wikipedia
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:42.080]  against the NSA. That number will be 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231. If you want to comment on the news
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:45.840]  of the day, going back to the news, what I was just talking about before we went to commercial
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:52.720]  break, was now we see a CIA connection to the Stingray program. That is the cell phone towers
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:58.800]  that, well, the devices that mimic cell towers so they can scan data on your cell phones.
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:03.040]  They don't mention the term Stingray. This is a Wall Street Journal article. That's for you,
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:07.680]  Montell. This was on the Drudge Report. And although they don't describe Stingray,
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:11.920]  they describe the functions of Stingray that we've been reporting on for a couple of years now,
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:17.280]  that they would not turn over information in court to judges who questioned them on
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:21.920]  how they collected this information without a search warrant. They would just drop the charges
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:26.400]  rather than expose the program because they had an on disclosure agreement with a corporation.
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:31.760]  And of course, corporations trump courts. They trump our government. They control our government.
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:38.000]  In this article, they say the CIA aided a program to spy on U.S. cell phones. So it's not just the
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:44.240]  NSA, it's the CIA. Remember, the CIA was only supposed to be operating abroad, protecting us
[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:49.840]  from these monsters that are stalking us abroad. No, the CIA is the monster that has taken over
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:55.680]  our government domestically and is focusing, it's one of the many agencies that are focusing on
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:26:01.360]  people here domestically. This is what they did. Of course, this article exposes a secret
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:06.560]  high-tech alliance between the spy agency, the CIA, and domestic law enforcement. Who
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:13.280]  in domestic law enforcement are they making an alliance with secretly? The U.S. Marshals
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:21.200]  under the Justice Department. Now, of course, this is a digital drag net. And as people have
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:24.880]  been talking about with the NSA spying, this is something different. This is not spying on you
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:29.760]  on the Internet. This is spying on your cell phones and collecting data from your cell phones
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:35.280]  as you're driving around with these fake antennas that they have up spoofing a cell phone tower so
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:41.520]  they can grab your information. And of course, the CIA is prohibited from acting domestically,
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:46.320]  unless they're trying to get a foreign spy that happens to be domestically.
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:50.960]  But this is drag net surveillance of all Americans being done by the CIA
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:56.560]  and the Justice Department. So don't expect anybody to go to jail because our government
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:02.880]  is the organized criminals here. Don't expect them to tell us the truth either when they deny that
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.840]  they've been doing certain aspects of this any more than you got the truth from James Clapper.
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:14.480]  When Ron Wyden knew what he was doing, asked him pointedly and you see him look down and rub
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:19.360]  his eyebrows because he can't even look Ron Wyden or the staff in the eye because he knows
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:23.120]  they all know the truth. And he knows that the truth is going to come out and that was right
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:27.520]  before the Snowden leak. They said the Justice Department, which oversees a martial service,
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:30.880]  would neither confirm nor deny the existence of such technology.
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:34.960]  What a surprise. The Wall Street Journal goes on to say to civil libertarians,
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:42.000]  the close involvement of America's premier international spy agency, the CIA, with domestic
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:46.800]  law enforcement arms shows how military and espionage techniques are now being used on
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:50.560]  U.S. citizens. Well, that's kind of a milk toast way to put it.
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:56.720]  Nevertheless, they break down the chronology around 2004 when they started doing this,
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:04.000]  doing it with just certain carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile at first. The CIA and the
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:10.880]  martial service received more than one of the devices at no cost, even though it cost $300,000
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:16.080]  normally to sell. They're just kind of seeding them with it. Harris Semiconductor, the companies
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:21.440]  that supply this military industrial complex. Here, have one on us. And if you like the way
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:26.080]  this works, we can sell you a lot more of these. That's the way they do it. They seed it that way.
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:30.960]  Then in 2008, the CIA arranged for the martial service to receive without charge one of the
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:36.720]  new devices, now enhanced to get more carriers besides just AT&T and T-Mobile. That would pick
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:44.160]  up Verizon, Sprint, Nexthel, all of them. That one is now going for $500,000. See what I said?
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:49.840]  Our freedoms are up for sale to the highest bidder. That's the way it's happening.
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:54.080]  Look at what's going on, of course, in New York. We have an article up on Infowars.com.
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:59.040]  A New York City bill would let residents earn money by recording idling cars. Guys,
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:04.880]  pull this up and take a look at this picture of this woman, this councilwoman, Helen Rosenthal.
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:11.440]  Put that up there. Blow that up. This woman looks like she stepped right out of Saturday Night Live.
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:16.400]  Unbelievable, the way this woman is dressed, the way she looks. I mean, this is like a comedy
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:22.320]  stand-up routine that Saturday Night Live would look at. But this woman thinks it's a great idea
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:28.160]  for people to send videos of people who have their cars stopped but the engine is still running,
[02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:32.640]  send those pictures to her and the people of New York City, and they'll write up tickets and
[02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:38.160]  give you a commission. Hey, maybe they can solve the homeless problem. They can give them a career
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:42.880]  spying on motorists. Turn everybody into snitches. I'm going to talk about the way they push back
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:47.760]  on this. Someone has come back at the congressional level to push back against these kind of abuses.
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:30:09.360]  Stay with us.
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:24.000]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:31.200]  by the body. Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12,
[02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:36.320]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most
[02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:41.120]  bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process. Secret 12 is taken by mouth,
[02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:45.760]  right on the tongue, and then swallowed. No needles, no injections. Don't take my word for it.
[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:51.680]  Try it for yourself. Discover the secret. Secret 12. Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[02:33:08.240 --> 02:33:11.360]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:20.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host in this last half hour. We're
[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:25.600]  going to take your calls and we're going to continue with this story. There's some more aspects of this
[02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:31.120]  idling bill that's in New York City that's going to come up. I guess we could say
[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:37.840]  idling cars are the devil's handwork. That certainly is the opinion. And let's go back to this picture
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:44.080]  of this little socialist nerd, councilwoman Helen Rosenthal. I hate to pick on people's
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:49.760]  appearance, but I'm sorry. She looks exactly like somebody who's been raised all of her life
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:56.240]  by the nanny state and now has become that spokesperson. I mean, this is like some character,
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:00.640]  like I said before, out of Saturday Night Live. We're going to talk about that before we go to
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:08.800]  that. Of course, we have also pointed out earlier in the show that Newsweek is now talking about yet
[02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:14.560]  another aspect of the problems with fluoridation. It's not the first time this has been discovered.
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:19.520]  It is a new study and the new study is very important, very strong in terms of its data.
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:24.800]  The only thing that the people who support fluoridation can talk about is the fact that,
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:30.400]  well, this is just one study. And I'm sure they will find a study that will find something else.
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:37.600]  You know, when they found the massive tumors on the rats in France after they fed them GMO for
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:44.160]  a couple of months, the industry funded its own study and fed the rats the GMO and didn't see
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:49.120]  the tumors because they stopped the study after a few weeks. It was much, much shorter than that.
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:53.520]  I don't remember whether it was months versus weeks or whether, but it was a much, much
[02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:58.160]  shorter truncated study so they didn't see the tumors grow. That's what they'll do. They'll
[02:34:58.160 --> 02:35:02.560]  create a study to come back and try to push against this fluoridation because we've been seeing
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:07.920]  these types of things popping up almost weekly. One from the UK a couple of weeks ago talking
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:14.240]  about the damage to the thyroid. This one talking about, again, another mental effect,
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:21.920]  not a drop in IQ, but creating ADHD in people. That's why we sell things at the info wars store
[02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:27.920]  like water filters. We're not selling you some snake oil water filter and trying to create a
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:32.560]  need for it by talking about fluoridation. We understand and have understood for a long time
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:40.080]  as many of you have fluoridation, hurt your brain, it hurts your thyroid, it has measurable
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:45.520]  deleterious effects. There's no reason we should be mass medicating the public with anything where
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:51.120]  you can't control the dosage by dumping it into the water supply. So get that out. We understand
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:57.760]  that's a problem. We want to help you help yourself because you can't get the city council to stop
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:02.400]  charging you to dump toxins into the water supply. Get your filter and take it out yourself.
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:06.320]  Protect yourself, protect your family. So we came up with some great water filters to sell.
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:11.920]  That's a win-win situation. It lets you take control of your life and it helps us be independent
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.640]  of the kind of pharmaceutical companies that run the mainstream media. That's why we have
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:22.800]  these things up there. Now also at infowarslife.com we've got a 30% off unprecedented discount on
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:27.120]  DNA force. Our competitors are already two to three times the price. Some are charging up to
[02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:34.640]  $600 for similar formulas. Right now you can get DNA force 30% off. That's under $100 for the first
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:41.680]  time ever and that's at infowarslife.com. Now I want to talk a little bit more about this story
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.640]  before we go to your calls. We've already got some people that have called in. This New York
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:53.680]  City bill here that is going to turn people into snitches for profit by taking video of people who
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:59.040]  have their cars stopped and are idling and therefore they're using too much fuel. That's the rationale
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:03.920]  behind it. But of course they want to earn money. That's what the police are there for. They also
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:10.480]  want to shut down your cars. To them nothing is more dangerous than a running car. So they have
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:15.680]  to be stopped by all means. Now this is not something that is new actually. Going back for a
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:20.720]  number of years car companies have been starting to put these auto start-stop systems on their cars.
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:26.960]  I'm not ever going to buy one of these things but they expect to see these on 60% of new vehicles
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:32.960]  by 2020. According to one article here and this is from the Daily Tech and they point out that these
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:37.680]  start-stop systems basically when you stop your car to stop light it'll turn off your engine and
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:42.720]  then when you get ready to go again it'll turn the engine back on. That sounds like a losing idea
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:47.840]  from the very beginning for me because I understand as you should as well that most of the wear and
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:54.160]  tear starts on your car as you're starting up the engine. It's also a massive drain on the battery
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:59.200]  and other issues but of course you can get that for a $300 option and you can be a good little
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:06.560]  green person. 65% of the people in Europe now have these idiotic systems on their cars. 7% in the US
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:13.680]  they expect that to increase to 60% in the US by 2020. Now going back to 2011 the truth about cars
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:18.640]  pointed out in a very detailed analysis and I'm not going to go into here the shocking truth
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:24.720]  about start-stop systems and they point out that the current generation in terms of the fuel economy
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:28.880]  they find out is not really there and it gets even worse. The current generation they said
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:35.840]  in 2011 of start-stop systems lose half of their benefits after just two weeks. Which means that
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:40.640]  they're great for juicing up the scores on Europe's urban efficiency test but they're as good as
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:48.080]  useless for the vast majority of life as we live it in our vehicles. Now what is behind all this
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:54.240]  of course is raising money. That's what our local governments especially New York City does all the
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:38:59.520]  time and here's a bombshell piece of legislation that's coming this is reported by the Freethought
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:05.120]  Project. This has been introduced by US Congressman from Missouri Emmanuel Cleaver. On Monday he
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:10.800]  introduced something he calls the Fair Justice Act and he says the Fair Justice Act would make it a
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:17.360]  criminal rights violation to enforce criminal or traffic laws for the purpose of raising revenue.
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:23.600]  Wow that would pretty much put them out of business wouldn't it? He says petty drug offenses,
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:28.000]  idiotic traffic laws, this is a Freethought Project talking about this and other such
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:31.840]  victimless crimes could be brought to a halt with the passage of this bill but we've already seen
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:38.160]  those kinds of things brought to a halt in New York City in protest of de Blasio the mayor
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:45.200]  not backing up the police when they were harassing Eric Garner and eventually killed him over a petty
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:50.800]  tax over tobacco. That's how that all started. They said well you're not going to enforce us
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:56.000]  when we're out there strong arming people to collect revenue for you we're just going to stop
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:03.280]  making as they put it this is a police union talking unnecessary arrests unnecessary tickets.
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:09.280]  Yeah let's stop them from doing things that aren't necessary. Let's stop them from killing people
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:14.320]  over a tobacco tax and of course the Freethought Project goes on to say since there's no money
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:18.160]  in solving murders or preventing rapes police departments in America focus their duties on
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:25.360]  traffic citations and the drug war. If you go back to New York City as they protested
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:32.400]  city halls not standing behind them de Blasio criticizing them for going over the top and
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:37.200]  killing Eric Garner over this tobacco tax. They got angry so they stopped doing that.
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:42.800]  They dropped the number of tickets that they were writing by 95% costing the city I think it was
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:48.240]  like 10 million dollars a week and they went through New Year's Eve. New Year's Eve they didn't arrest
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:55.520]  anybody for drunkenness and Times Square they just left people alone and focused only on violent
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:01.120]  crimes and they kept that up for a while. Now it's interesting to go back a few years there was a
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:08.160]  famous whistleblower within the police in New York City the NYPD Adrian Schoolcraft who over a period
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:13.040]  of years this guy was a legitimate cop he really wanted to protect people he wanted to interact
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:19.280]  with people on the beat and he started he refused to write these annoyance tickets to collect revenue
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:23.520]  and so as punishment they put him on the beat and he was very happy about that because he got to
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:28.800]  know the people in the community and he wasn't harassing them but they were not happy with him
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:32.960]  and when they found out that he had been recording their meetings where they were putting pressure
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:39.280]  on the police to write these tickets they came to his apartment and the number two guy in the
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:46.000]  New York police department threatened him to turn said turn over these things or we're going to
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  commit you for your own safety they actually kidnapped him put him into an insane asylum
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:56.640]  where his dad couldn't find him his dad was a cop as well his dad couldn't find him for about a week
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:01.280]  and then did find him they lied to everybody and they said we don't have any ticket quotas and then
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:05.200]  they proved that they did have ticket quotas when they shut everything down this last winter
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:10.480]  but they would take a whistleblowing cop an honest cop who wants to protect the public
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:18.000]  and they would put him in an insane asylum that's the insanity of this let's go to your calls right
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:22.320]  now let's let's let's go to the first caller there on that you got flashing right there sorry what's
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:30.800]  his name yeah JJ in Indiana go ahead oh hi David I was just wondering if you think they actually
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:35.680]  enforce this ammo ban what do you think we're facing after that what do I think will come
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:40.800]  if they're successful in doing the ammo ban yeah like what do you think is going to come out of that
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:46.320]  well what they talked about was they want to create a framework and in the letter that the 52 senators
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:53.200]  sent to the ATF because it's not just 80,000 people angry at comments but it was also 52 senators
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:43:02.000]  they said that they did not want to they said that the ATF had essentially created a pseudo
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:07.520]  objective standard they said you pretend to have an objective standard but you don't really have an
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:12.960]  objective standard and and what they want to do is I want to say well we can say that the objective
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:20.240]  standard is if it kills a cop we can ban it the senator said you're creating a framework to go after
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:25.600]  all ammunition because all ammunition could arguably be that and unfortunately the way that they
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:32.400]  wrote that these the senator said you know these are used for sporting purposes and we have to
[02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:35.760]  understand that we're not going to be able to defend the second amendment by saying we need
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:42.000]  it for sporting purposes that is a path to disaster that was a path that the NRA took
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:47.680]  for many decades under Wayne LaPierre they have taken a more constitutional approach but we cannot
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:53.840]  take the approach that they're going to let us have the guns if we use them only for target
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:58.000]  practice and for hunting that's not what the second amendment is about that's a legitimate use of
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:04.320]  firearms but that's not the main point of the citizens right to keep and bear arms so they're
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:09.120]  going to come back and I don't know how they're going to tweak this framework but that's what
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:12.400]  they're talking about they're going to basically try to create some kind of a structure that will
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:19.360]  let them incrementally ban ammunition thanks let's go to sherry and texas sherry thank you
[02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:25.520]  thank you david i wanted to say something about hillary i've been really concerned about this for
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:30.880]  a long time and here's what i think she's facing can you hear me on yes yes go ahead thank you i've
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:36.560]  had my audio cut in the past and i never know okay so here's the deal the military industrial
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:45.280]  complex i think wants to blame her for Benghazi and and not the CIA or secret agents that were
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:51.280]  working for profit under the radar so that no other ca agents knew about it and the reason
[02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:57.280]  i say this is because um there was a show on the radio on a late night show many of us know and love
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:06.480]  it was on november 3 2013 on a sunday and uh i was too tired to stay up this whistleblower
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:15.200]  named robert nicknamed posh to ush plumlee was on the last two hours of the show and so i i just
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:20.240]  went ahead and went to sleep and yeah we've had him on a alex's interview him multiple times talking
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:27.200]  about Benghazi yes go ahead posh pumbly times but in that i was so taken by what he said this is
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:36.080]  november 3 2013 sunday um and and i think well anyway i i turned on the light and started making
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:42.960]  notes and what i what has stuck with me from that interview and others is this something about an
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:48.640]  interdiction program he was i don't know what that is but after that he said reagan could have been
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:55.680]  impeached we set up ca operatives and the irs busted him that gun running was in violation of
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:46:02.080]  the boland amendment and all that stuff i don't understand either but he was a pilot who was
[02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:07.440]  running stuff for the cia so he was he knew about the weapons the secret weapons transfers that were
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:14.960]  in violation of the law he knew about the uh transference of cocaine from central america
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:21.200]  that gary webb exposed in dark alliance they use that the cia used that to create the crack cocaine
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:27.360]  epidemic with freeway ricky ross so yeah we have uh we've had tosh plumlee on several times and had
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:33.920]  freeway ricky ross uh in here talking about how that had gone down shortly after the movie came out
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:39.920]  about gary webb um dark let's see what was it called shoot the messenger his book was called
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:44.960]  dark alliance absolutely the cia was involved we've had steve pacinic on who's talking about the
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:50.160]  cia involvement steve pacinic was saying that what happened in bigazi was uh two different
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:55.920]  branches of the intelligence service of the cia the military and the civilian size of it
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:00.640]  essentially at war with each other because they were disagreeing about how and who they
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:06.480]  were going to arm out of the uh insurgents over there and of course we know that we are arming
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:14.160]  the people in libya it's become a shopping mall for isis for the syrian rebels we know that the cia
[02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:19.440]  and the military industrial complex is arming and training these people that's how they're trying to
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:25.360]  permit these wars and certainly uh hillary clinton is just one part of it but uh certainly sherry you
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:30.400]  understand that hillary clinton is very much involved in the cover-up of ben gazi don't you
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:35.280]  did she have a choice i think the military industrial complex she doesn't have to lie
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:40.800]  yes for ben gazi we'll see the next day i thought if if if reagan could have been impeached he would
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:46.240]  have had to know something about it and but then of course his plumlee went on to explain
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:51.920]  that uh week we we he said we can't report some things like that because they have to
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:56.880]  protect the legacy of past presidents well that was reagan they don't want to protect her pregnant
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:02.000]  her presidency i don't think she's going to run because of this i never did if she does she's
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:06.960]  going to be sure to lose because i think the complex wants to blame hillary they want to
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:13.600]  blame ben gazi on hillary and not the cia operatives or secret agents and i noticed that hillary quit
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:20.480]  that morning that that show was on on on 2013 if i'm not mistaken that monday because it was on a
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:27.200]  sunday i just have to say that you know hillary clinton is is not an innocent bystander in any
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:32.560]  of this see you know hillary if you want to get hillary clinton on uh lying on money under the
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:39.680]  table on people being suicided and uh in uh arkansas going back to uh her her record as being
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:47.040]  probably one of the most successful commodities uh investors ever uh getting like a thousand percent
[02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:52.880]  return on her investment uh and then getting out of it after you know i guess she hit the bank
[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:58.160]  roll on it once and then and then got out of it look that was a blatant payback hillary clinton
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:03.440]  has such a long rap list to go to our website and look at the report that john bounds got there
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:07.120]  he's got a lot of hillary's pastor she's not going to be able to escape her past and if you
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:12.320]  want to talk about hillary clinton's criminal past it's a target rich environment it goes way
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:17.680]  way beyond Benghazi and you can take a look at the money that she's getting i think there's a
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:21.760]  very good chance unfortunately that she could become president i think there's a very good
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:27.760]  chance that it will be her or bush jeb bush and i think that's a very sad situation for our country
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:36.880]  let's go to uh jeff and tennessee jeff uh hey david i could talk to you today um just on the ammo
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:41.600]  ban uh you know one of the things that really concerned me the first time i started seeing
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:50.480]  green tip 223 stuff come out was wide why is that on the market um there's no other green tip ammo
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:59.680]  for a 308 or 300 magnum with rdl sticks it's just 223 um now i'm for all ammo being available
[02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:09.600]  but it's almost yes go ahead hello hello i think we lost him uh can you hear me jeff i think we've
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:14.240]  lost him um i'd like to know what he thought was up behind that but you know the bottom line is is
[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:20.000]  that he pointed out he's i'm for all ammo being available the right to keep him bare arms is not
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:25.200]  just about firearms it's not just about rifles it's about pistols it's about the ammunition
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:29.120]  that you put in those because then you wind up with a club if you don't have any ammunition for
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:33.920]  your gun and that's the important thing we have to understand the right to keep him bare arms is

[02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:23.840]  your do stock market tip is buying stock and aftermarket car starters exactly yeah i heard this
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:28.480]  morning i didn't hear i saw on the news scroll this morning i didn't believe with abc but it
[02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:34.080]  mentioned uh and i hadn't heard the name montel wayans in a long time until alex said it and but
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:39.440]  then i saw this this morning it's like two times in one day this is like phenomenal it said that he
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:47.440]  uh promotes or endorses some company that uh has been found to charge up to a thousand percent
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:53.920]  interest wow so i think we we can find out this from that you know that obviously he is some type
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:59.760]  of a whore i hate to use that word yeah yeah on a brighter side i guess hillary clinton back in
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:07.680]  it was a watergate commission and she was put on a commission yes as a bright and upcoming
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:12.720]  college student or whatever she was at the time but the guy that was the head of the commission said
[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:18.160]  she lies about stuff that doesn't deserve to be lied to just simple things she she lied about
[02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:23.200]  everything exactly she's just pathological like that and so is actually so yeah they're
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:28.640]  good match in my respect i think her the big misunderstanding i think her mother's name was
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:37.680]  sir edmund hillary yeah it's pretty amazing yeah it's just amazing to see when uh we have montel
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:43.200]  williams who ignores the big stories you know we got some really serious stories going on
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:47.680]  even the story about hillary clinton i mean that's pretty amazing when she she goes up she's got a
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:53.600]  prepared speech about how you know she needs this server because her own personal server in her home
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:57.520]  because it makes everything so much simpler and convenient and oh by the way i use it to email
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:04.000]  bill and at the same time an interview is breaking at the wall street journal where his assistant
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  says he never does email he's done two emails his entire life that was classic but of course montel
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:15.280]  chooses to come after us when we show yet another story because there's been many of these that have
[02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:20.480]  come to light most of them exposed by local news outlets like this particular one was about the
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:27.600]  va's attitude towards veterans absolutely amazing thanks dave let's go to a veteran uh roger in
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:34.400]  missouri roger you said you're a disabled vet you just got a letter from the va uh yes uh they're
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:40.720]  trying to sneak another one in on us uh i would advise all veterans not to fill this out and send
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:51.360]  it then it's called the million veteran program and it uh it's very uh nosy oh yeah it's a survey
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:57.920]  yeah the statute program will say you have genes lifestyle and military exposures affect
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:06.560]  health and illness and then once you come in and give a blood sample and uh it says you'll be anonymous
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:11.200]  i don't know and they'll track you i guess for the rest of your life oh yeah my policy is not to
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:15.680]  go to the doctor unless i get something that's broken and i don't give information to the government
[02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:20.000]  unless they hold a gun to my head and i think you ought to follow that advice any of the va any of
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:24.400]  the vets who get that letter from the va follow that same advice thank you roger let's go to uh
[02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:30.560]  jeff in missouri jeff hey david how's it going but i know i'm short on time just want to say
