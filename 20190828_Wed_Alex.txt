[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live August 28th, 2019.
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.000]  We're basically already in full-bore war with China.
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.000]  That's all coming up.
[00:10.000 --> 00:13.000]  But first, what do the elite know that we don't know?
[00:13.000 --> 00:15.000]  No matter how useful these damn things are,
[00:15.000 --> 00:17.000]  because technology is fine, but it's what they jack it with.
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.000]  I've got to get rid of it.
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.000]  I've got to at least start having weekends free,
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.000]  no cell phones, go back to land lines.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.000]  We're doing it.
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.000]  They're all going away.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  They're all getting locked up.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  Every day when I get home, I'm done with them.
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  And a lot of smart folks like Matt Drugs years ago,
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  you'll refuse to have them, because they're a little portable,
[00:31.000 --> 00:34.000]  super high-tech computer with more tech in this
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  than 30 years ago could be in a 10-story building.
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.000]  And it knows your heartbeat.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.000]  It already knows everything.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  It's listening to you all the time.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  This is your little digital minder.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  It might as well be a chip in your brain.
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.000]  It's already frying your brain.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  It's already giving you cancer.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.000]  And so I always say I'm a hypocrite.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  I admit things are bad, then I still do them.
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  But if you're a radio listener and you're not seeing this,
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  mind control by cell phone scientific American.
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  I mean, this is not my opinion.
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  People keep saying, why is it all coming out?
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  Why are you right about everything?
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  Because it was all in the medical and scientific literature
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  50 years ago on average.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  They're about 45-50 years ahead from the research and development
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  to when they deploy it to us.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  And when they deploy it, it's always bad.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  It's always the worst possible thing.
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  It doesn't just destroy your attention span.
[01:21.000 --> 01:22.000]  It doesn't just study.
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.000]  It's making we don't have friends and family.
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.000]  It doesn't just make you depressed.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  It doesn't just surveil on you.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  It doesn't just kill you and give you cancer.
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  It manipulates all of us and knows our dreams
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  so they can always be ahead of us with trends.
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  It's our warden.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.000]  It's our jail guard.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  It's our slave master.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  It's our king.
[01:39.000 --> 01:40.000]  It's our God.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  It's our mommy and our daddy.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  We spend more time with it than we do with our newborn babies.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  And so this week, and last week,
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  I was talking about the heat coming off the thing.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  So I got another one.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  This bastard did it, was it today or yesterday?
[01:57.000 --> 01:58.000]  Again.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  Because I know heat when I feel it.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  You're like, whoa, that's, it's beaming.
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  It's got some pulse power where it's got like a real microwave,
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  like you're inside a microwave.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  I mean, that takes power to go, whoa.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.000]  That's what they've always said.
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.000]  They can remotely kill people.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  They don't like, I guess, with these.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  So I think at an instinctive level,
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  I have to just get rid of them completely
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  because it's slow killing us.
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  So they want to, and there's been reports on this.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  They can kill you quickly with 5G particularly.
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  So from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s,
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  we've been developing microwave weapons right up to today.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  And they are incredibly sophisticated today.
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  So if any government says that microwaves have no effect on you,
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  the question is, why have you been spending billions
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  upon billions of dollars with the military
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  for the last 60 years improving them?
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  Everybody's habituated.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Now they tell you, oh, 5G smartphones caused cancer.
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  Big wireless doesn't want you to know.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  Wired magazine last year.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  The inconvenient truth about cancer and mobile phones.
[03:11.000 --> 03:12.000]  The Guardian.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  So they're telling you.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  Big report about how it's all embedded.
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  California Bands 5G cell tower overclaims it causes cancer.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  At a school where 20% of the kids got cancer.
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  I mean, you didn't used to get one kid with cancer
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  out of a million in the 1950s, folks.
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  Now you can't swing a stick and not, you know,
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.000]  hit a kid that's got it.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  5G smartphones caused cancer.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  Other headline.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  These are all just boom, boom, boom.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  Now, here's where you'll stop them.
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  Because once somebody's habituated to something,
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  whether it's cigarettes or whether it's liquor,
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  whether it's being abused, whether it's significant other,
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  they tend to put up with it. We adapt to being in our environment.
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  They have these zones all over the world.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  Now we're discovering, and this is one of the cutting edge things
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  that I've been working on, where they're building communities
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  that don't allow radio transmitters, shell phones, anything.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  And they always excuses, oh, we're studying birds and bees here
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.000]  to see if electromagnetic's hurting them.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  They know it's killing them.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  Or, oh, we've got a SETI government NASA program here,
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  and so it jams it if there's any electromagnetic radiation.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  And if you look at it, the land values and everything
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  are skyrocketing those areas, and they're getting some
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  of the highest per capita people moving in,
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  and there's shell corporations buying it up,
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  and there's heavy earth equipment and things going in,
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  and they're building underground bunkers in West Virginia
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  in the tens of thousands of square mile area
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  where the government has laws that you can have
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  no transmission systems of any type.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words,
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  to merge with AI gods.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  is our bodies.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  for the forestlife.com, I couldn't do it.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  that was incredibly high quality medical bottle man
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  It is amazing.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  Experience pure medical bottle man B12 for yourself
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  and fund the second American Revolution
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com,
[05:54.000 --> 06:10.000]  infowarslife.com, or triple A 253-3139.
[06:10.000 --> 06:16.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:16.000 --> 06:27.000]  Well, we definitely had a policy of truth here.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, live on this August 28th,
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  2019, Wednesday edition in defiance of the globalist,
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  in defiance of their tyranny, in defiance of their attempt
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  to create a post-human era, the only way that dictators,
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  psychopaths, and control freaks could ever win
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  against humanity is to exterminate us.
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.000]  And remember, I started the broadcast off yesterday
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  with NBC News cover story, their top story,
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  saying that the age of humans is over
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  and that we will soon be extincted perhaps in our lifetimes.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  Because if the globalist can exterminate 99%
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  of the population, they truly will not
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  have the competition anymore.
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  And there it is, not long after that,
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  homo sapiens could vanish from Earth entirely
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  in our own lifetimes.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  Now, if Hitler wrote that, you'd say it was even more
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  of a madman, but when it's James Lovelock,
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  the transhumanist environmentalist,
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  it's so sexy.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  And where does James Lovelock go?
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  I looked it up.
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  James Lovelock has gone spoken to the Albert Einstein Institute.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  And who was the omnibudsman of that for the last 20 years?
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  Jeffrey, come on down, Epstein.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  But when it started to come out,
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.000]  he was running a eugenics transhumanist operation.
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  They didn't know what to do.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  He said, oh, he's a kooky transhumanist.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  The kooks are into that.
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  Really.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  Well, almost everybody in Hollywood,
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  almost everybody in the highest levels of governments
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  of the Democratic Party, are all obsessed
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  with having their heads and genitals chopped off at death
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  and frozen.
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  There's dozens of these facilities around the world
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  so they can be reanimated.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  They've got systems they're trying to develop to download
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  their souls to do what the ancient pharaohs tried and failed.
[08:46.000 --> 08:52.000]  And that, of course, is cheat death.
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.000]  And those that try to cheat death will find eternal death.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  Those that embrace life and don't fear death
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  because they know the Creator already
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  know that there's eternal life with God.
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  But with the death cult,
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  if you energetically radiate to that,
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  all you're going to find is eternal death.
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  Now, I said yesterday that I was going to come in today
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  with all these exhibits and do most of the show
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  on the bottom of the rabbit hole,
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  where the globalists are taking us.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  It's not the top of a pyramid.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  It's really the bottom of the rat hole.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  And I'm going to do some of that today.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  But really, I need to do more preparation
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  because this is so important to really lay out their quotes,
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  their statements, and to really get to the bottom of this.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  So I mean, they're going to do that tomorrow.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  I'll do it on Friday. I'm not complaining.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  But today has been law enforcement day.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  I had the feds call me this morning
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  when I was trying to get ready for the show on another issue,
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  which was not a problem.
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  And then we had somebody steal a backpack here,
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  and our head of security wasn't even here at the time.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  He drove down from North Austin,
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  looked at all the convenience stores around here,
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  and within 30 minutes found the guys.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  Citizens arrested them.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  That's still in the books. You find horse thieves.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  You can bring them into the magistrate,
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.000]  and the police wouldn't arrest them.
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.000]  So I was dealing with that.
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.000]  I'm not complaining.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  There was just a bunch of other hell that broke loose this morning.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  I mean, a lot more than that,
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  I'm not going to get into on air.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  But when it rains, it pours.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  And so I got a little distracted,
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  a little distracted from we sitting an hour in my office
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  and focusing and writing some more notes
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  on what I want to get to,
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  because let me explain something,
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  and I know you know this already,
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  but there isn't anything bigger except God
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  than the globalist desire to kill humanity.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  And they've been given a big delusion on why they're doing that.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  And you look at the pathetic, arrogant slaves
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  of Satan like Jeffrey Epstein,
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  and maybe you guys can find the footage.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.000]  I should have told you.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  It's the one where the Prince Andrew,
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  type in Prince Andrew at Epstein's New York mansion,
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  and you see the door open to the dark,
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  and he's making this weird little vampire bat smile
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  and a young lady or girl is going out.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  Epstein's wearing like three big peacocking coats,
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  and you look at the satisfied look in his eyes
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  and how powerful he thinks he is
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  and how he's strutting around,
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  and it really picks up the essence.
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  You can't find it.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  We'll add it in post later when we post it.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  TemphillWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  It's just type in Prince Andrew, click images.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  Prince Andrew, Epstein, it's everywhere.
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  And you see in that little clip of video
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  and all the other film clips and photos he's in,
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  just how he's in love with himself.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  He's drunk in the eyes with, he's a superman,
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  and he's going to live forever,
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  and he's got to be able to impregnate
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  thousands of women to share
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  his incredible, unstoppable genetics.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  And he's got all these secret breeding facilities
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  and occult facilities.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  And you're like, that's really freaky.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  That's really crazy.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  But it's not freaky.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  It's not crazy for them.
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  That's standard default position.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  Again, if you just go,
[12:42.000 --> 12:43.000]  watch my film for free online,
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  in-game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  If you simply research what's in that
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  two and a half hour film,
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  and look it up for yourself,
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  then you understand everything.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  Because that's their religion,
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  that's their system.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  They're told by their God,
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  the earth is bad, humans are bad.
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  You're going to be God.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  You're going to overwrite it.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  The survival of the fittest.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  You're going to conquer all life,
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  and new life forms will rise out of that,
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  and then you will conquer the universe
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  and be a God.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  Well, that's what the devil said to Eve
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  in the Garden of Eden.
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.000]  They had knowledge of good and evil,
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  as we would think of it,
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  but the knowledge of good
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  is the knowledge of how to run
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  good systems to be honorable.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  The knowledge of evil is the infection
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  and the code and the system
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  to carry out parasitic systems
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  against humanity
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  that would end in humanity's destruction.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  Knowledge of evil is knowledge
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  of how to set up evil systems.
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  It's not the awareness that bad exists.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  It is the downloading into your psyche
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  the spirit of the devil,
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  the spirit of rebellion
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  against God's perfect order.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  And so, yes, when I had a sargon
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  of a cod here in studio,
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  and I said, well, you know,
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  Bill Gates, Warren Buffett,
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  they all went and hung out with Epstein
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  at the scientific institutes
[14:14.000 --> 14:15.000]  they had in New York
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  and the Albert Einstein Institute.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  They're like, well, I didn't know that, Alex.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  I'll have to see if that's true.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  Well, we just put The Wall Street Journal
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  in The New York Times, The Washington Post,
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  ABC News.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  We can put all those on screen for you.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  They've been going there for years.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  That's why Bill Gates won't say
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  why he went and met with Epstein.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  We already know why.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  It is a transhumanist cult.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  And to transcend humanity,
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  their God has told them that,
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  oh, yeah, go back to that last one
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  because there's also video of this.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  There's video that run on the news.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  I'll find it in the break.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  No big deal.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  But just go back to the other photo, please.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  No, the other way.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  One more over.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  That's it. Stay there.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  Look at the smug look on Epstein's face.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  And everyone's just going around
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  acting like they're powerful,
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  acting like they're enlightened.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  But he ended up in a puddle of his own piss
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  with his neck broken by two gorillas.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  That's where he is now.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  That's what all his supposed power
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  and his globalist acumen
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  and all of it signified
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  was that he was a nobody.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  But you get in and around these meetings
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  and you read the minutes of these meetings
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  that have leaked.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  They all just worship each other
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  and call themselves supreme beings and gods.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  And they're trying to build the technology
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  that we've developed,
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  the systems they can pretend to do that.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  But all they are is perverts.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  All they are is devil worshipers
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  always doing more and more heinous things
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  in the name of their supremacy
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  that they have a right to do it.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:03.000 --> 16:04.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  I beat the IRS then
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  they thought might never be solved.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  I can help you too.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay,
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  don't wait another day.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency
[16:32.000 --> 16:33.000]  solar survival backup system
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  this will be the most important message
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  you'll ever hear.
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.000]  Bill Hyde here.
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale
[16:41.000 --> 16:42.000]  with historically low prices
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  on our PPX microgrid system
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  that's going to let you produce
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[16:48.000 --> 16:49.000]  The clearance price is a result
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  of the historic flooding we're having here
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  Because of the flooding,
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.000]  to a temporary location
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  we thought we'd offer the system
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  at a price that might seem unbelievable
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  at myownpowergrid.com.

[17:16.000 --> 17:17.000]  and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.000]  And the best part?
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.

[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  the excitement and tradition of slingbow.

[17:59.000 --> 18:00.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[18:00.000 --> 18:01.000]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[18:01.000 --> 18:02.000]  Thanks for holding.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  Hey, I just wanted to say,
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  your show's a breath of fresh air.
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  and one thing I can tell you is that
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  to get Trump to go to a war
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  because they know that that's the only way
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  approaching 2020.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this,
[18:23.000 --> 18:24.000]  it'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated
[18:26.000 --> 18:27.000]  other than assassinating him.
[18:27.000 --> 18:28.000]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.000]  I agree entirely.
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  I'm trying to shut you down,
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  But if they do shut you down,
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  You've won a lot of battles.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  And there are a lot of people like myself
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  and many others who are going to continue.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  fired up for liberty.
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  I'm not sure if we're calling.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  And we aren't going to back down.
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  is the world that want to intimidate people
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  And the human spirit lives at infowars.com
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  and newswars.com.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do,
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  spread those links because we are the light,
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  the dark of the night.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  We are the resistance.
[19:51.000 --> 19:58.000]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  The face of these people.
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  Finally, nothing moves.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  High news.
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  Black down the rolling below the asphalt.
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  Dry, dry.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  A concrete fascination.
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  Screaming for the edge of nothing.
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  Lips, lips, lips.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  Money through Friday,
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  ladies and gentlemen, we're here live
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.640]  live from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central and of course right after the transmission
[20:53.640 --> 20:57.720]  there's the war room with Owen shroyer the rest of his great crew and of course
[20:57.720 --> 21:02.680]  David Knight starts it all off weekday mornings at 8 a.m. Central with the
[21:02.680 --> 21:07.040]  David Knight transmission okay so here's what I intend to do to shake the
[21:07.040 --> 21:13.120]  transmission up I want to open the phones up early in the show specifically on
[21:13.120 --> 21:19.800]  treason and there's nothing but treason going on by the Democratic Party by the
[21:19.800 --> 21:24.960]  multinational corporations that are still based in this country that have set up
[21:24.960 --> 21:29.360]  shop in China in the last 40 years and who were trying to complete their
[21:29.360 --> 21:37.680]  economic and cultural conquest and usurpation of what's left of the West
[21:37.680 --> 21:42.640]  and particularly the jewel in the crown of the United States remember this
[21:42.640 --> 21:52.400]  headline last week she's choice destroy Trump or save him and weaken America she
[21:52.400 --> 21:59.080]  the dictator of China or the hundred-plus dead million under the
[21:59.080 --> 22:06.320]  party's belt save us from the tyrannous the tyrant king the elected
[22:06.320 --> 22:12.200]  president Trump you read the article it reads like something that the Communist
[22:12.200 --> 22:18.640]  Party put out last night stories up on info wars.com my Steve Watson communist
[22:18.640 --> 22:28.120]  Chinese quote Taylor Swift in attack on President Trump isn't that just darling
[22:28.120 --> 22:32.480]  and then it's got her quoted in here saying I'll reach the quote how dare
[22:32.480 --> 22:36.600]  Trump do what he's doing with the economy in China and I'm so ashamed I
[22:36.600 --> 22:41.560]  didn't campaign for Hillary it's just terrible and the Communist Party quote
[22:41.560 --> 22:48.360]  sir and says see Americans see what you've done so we have the Washington
[22:48.360 --> 22:56.920]  Post openly siding with Communist China over America when they have a zero
[22:56.920 --> 23:01.520]  corporate tax we have a 15 meaning all our jobs still go there Trump lowered it
[23:01.520 --> 23:06.280]  from 40 to 15 thinking we get some corporations to come back and so Biden's
[23:06.280 --> 23:12.520]  trying to raise it back to 40 or 39.9 to make it prohibitive to be here's like
[23:12.520 --> 23:17.640]  oh no some companies are coming back America was never great America will
[23:17.640 --> 23:24.640]  never be great shit the governor of New York meanwhile Trump tweeted our country
[23:24.640 --> 23:29.360]  has lost stupidly trillions of dollars with China over many years they have
[23:29.360 --> 23:32.600]  stolen intellectual property at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars a
[23:32.600 --> 23:38.000]  year and they want to continue I won't let that happen we don't need China and
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.560]  frankly we far better off without them and that's the truth the vast amounts of
[23:43.560 --> 23:48.120]  money made by stolen by China from United States year after year and the
[23:48.120 --> 23:53.760]  decades will and must stop our great American companies are hereby ordered to
[23:53.760 --> 23:59.160]  mainly start looking for alternative to China including bringing factories back
[23:59.160 --> 24:07.520]  to United States Trump said that a week ago he said it but last Friday almost a
[24:07.520 --> 24:11.840]  week ago and they began to freak out everywhere that he's an idiot he's a
[24:11.840 --> 24:18.720]  moron meanwhile again China has nine hundred billion dollars in trade
[24:18.720 --> 24:21.640]  deficit and stolen assets and intellectual property every year
[24:21.640 --> 24:27.240]  conservatively nine hundred billion for stuff that I won't even buy toys for
[24:27.240 --> 24:30.680]  my children anymore unless they're like made in the u.s. or Europe the old-fashioned
[24:30.680 --> 24:35.280]  toys literally Chinese toys break half the time when you get them out of the
[24:35.280 --> 24:39.520]  box the other half the time where you play with them like an hour they break I
[24:39.520 --> 24:46.080]  will not buy made in Chinese you know toys made in China toys and then you've
[24:46.080 --> 24:49.400]  got China involved in our politics you've got a manipulating our currency
[24:49.400 --> 24:53.200]  because they own our currency now the biggest piece of it buying up our media
[24:53.200 --> 24:59.120]  I know I harp on this a lot but it's really really a big deal that as a
[24:59.120 --> 25:04.440]  society we've gotten to this point and that so many Americans believe it's
[25:04.440 --> 25:09.640]  okay to openly root against America for China when China doesn't have welfare
[25:09.640 --> 25:12.960]  environmental standards their rivers catch on fire they have no scrubbers on
[25:12.960 --> 25:18.000]  their coal power plants their daycare system is chaining children up to polls
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.400]  for most people hundreds of millions of children living you know near death
[25:23.400 --> 25:27.840]  level environments and then we're supposed to compete with that and the
[25:27.840 --> 25:32.240]  left tells us all day how we can't have any industry here even what's clean this
[25:32.240 --> 25:35.920]  was all designed to conquer she wonder how America would get conquered dish
[25:35.920 --> 25:43.520]  was the plan so yes Trump does some things like give lip service to red
[25:43.520 --> 25:47.440]  flag laws it's really bad you notice he shelved that we've got you know
[25:47.440 --> 25:50.440]  congressmen the Republicans still pushing it we'll talk about mr. Crenshaw
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.000]  bottom the next hour with Caitlyn Bennett he really sent her some nasty
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.520]  messages and yes Trump's got some issues he hasn't come out to stop the
[25:58.520 --> 26:04.360]  censorship the epic times it's been around decades owned by Falun Gong first
[26:04.360 --> 26:07.920]  straight newspaper original reporting said the whole Russia gate was fake
[26:07.920 --> 26:12.840]  showed all the proof put out those big maps that showed how the deep state did
[26:12.840 --> 26:18.160]  it just invaluable reporting something the New York Times never did something
[26:18.160 --> 26:22.320]  the Washington Post wish they did they've been banned on Facebook now they've
[26:22.320 --> 26:27.640]  got ABC News hit pieces against them now groups are coming after them all because
[26:27.640 --> 26:33.160]  the communist Chinese like we're a sock puppet are working through the corporate
[26:33.160 --> 26:36.720]  media through their current party to go right down the line and shut down every
[26:36.720 --> 26:43.000]  one of their enemies and now they take away and block Mitch McConnell's Twitter's
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.280]  and then they take away Michelle Malkin's and then they they're taking
[26:47.280 --> 26:52.520]  everybody's communication systems away and the leader of the Senate won't even
[26:52.520 --> 26:59.400]  act when he's being silenced because ladies and gentlemen the Democrats still
[26:59.400 --> 27:04.600]  control these central systems the Democrats still control the major
[27:04.600 --> 27:09.720]  apparatus inside big tech which was set up by our government and the Clinton
[27:09.720 --> 27:13.640]  and Obama people and the Bush people are still in place in government and
[27:13.640 --> 27:17.400]  Trump's only scratched the service removing them and putting good people in
[27:17.400 --> 27:22.560]  and he's got to boldly go after him or they're going to steal the election I
[27:22.560 --> 27:26.960]  want to open the phones up I want to get your take on the treason of our media
[27:26.960 --> 27:31.160]  and our systems openly rooting for China and how outrageous it is that so many
[27:31.160 --> 27:35.520]  Americans are siding against their own interest and common sense with the
[27:35.520 --> 27:40.120]  heavyweight champion mass murderers of all history and you see the Hong Kong
[27:40.120 --> 27:44.080]  folks standing up and fighting back in our own media demonizing them the toll
[27:44.080 --> 27:49.240]  free numbers 877789 Alex 877789 first-time callers today or callers that
[27:49.240 --> 27:55.560]  called him it didn't get through 877789 Alex 877789 2539 we're gonna go to break
[27:55.560 --> 27:59.840]  in a moment but here's Taylor Swift shooting her mouth off about Trump
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.360]  wishing she'd worked harder to get Hillary in so I guess you know Hillary
[28:04.360 --> 28:10.680]  was obviously a chai-com operative so here is Taylor Swift Taylor Swift winning
[28:10.680 --> 28:15.840]  her second video of the year Moonman for her equality anthem you need to calm
[28:15.840 --> 28:20.920]  down but Swift was pretty fired up about why the Trump White House has not
[28:20.920 --> 28:26.520]  acknowledged her equality act petition for LGBTQ rights which was launched with
[28:26.520 --> 28:32.320]  that signal single the Chinese execute there was a petition and there still is
[28:32.320 --> 28:39.840]  a petition for the equality act which basically just says we all deserve equal
[28:39.840 --> 28:48.880]  rights under the law now has half a million signatures which which is five
[28:48.880 --> 28:54.200]  times the amount that it needs to work think about the irony China executes
[28:54.200 --> 29:00.960]  gays but she's rooting for China heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries

[31:10.360 --> 31:14.000]  end up saving the nation and today the Communist Chinese have banned all US
[31:14.000 --> 31:19.400]  farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for
[31:19.400 --> 31:23.960]  the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put pressure on

[33:16.480 --> 33:25.000]  I won't be much when you get through with me he never gives up he's Alex Jones
[33:25.000 --> 33:31.480]  broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas
[33:34.480 --> 33:44.080]  you know they're saying Joe Rogan is the most trusted man in America and I know he's probably one of the most popular talk show hosts in the
[33:44.080 --> 33:47.760]  country that's actually trusted because he has a lot of reviews and ideas on
[33:47.760 --> 33:53.080]  that's a good thing and I think it's emblematic of the fall of the corporate
[33:53.080 --> 33:58.080]  establishment media that somebody my old friend of 20 plus years Joe Rogan would
[33:58.080 --> 34:01.880]  be in that position I think that's a fair statement you know I just want to be
[34:01.880 --> 34:10.040]  known as the Sam Adams of America because he was in news as well financing
[34:10.040 --> 34:13.920]  pamphlets across the country to awaken folks to King George but I got to tell
[34:13.920 --> 34:18.480]  you something all of you if you choose this mission to take action and those of
[34:18.480 --> 34:25.960]  you that have spread the word you're not just Sam Adams who you really are is
[34:25.960 --> 34:30.960]  Paul Rovere you could be black you could be white you could be Hispanic you can
[34:30.960 --> 34:35.040]  be Asian you can be old you can be young you could be an immigrant that came
[34:35.040 --> 34:38.120]  here and once be part of this country and came here legally and if you care
[34:38.120 --> 34:41.000]  about freedom and the unborn you care about justice and you know there's good
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.240]  and evil in the world and you choose God then you are the light in the universe
[34:46.240 --> 34:51.280]  that that God has brought forth to expose the darkness you are the salt of
[34:51.280 --> 34:57.440]  the earth and I salute you you are the Paul Rovere's and it's only through you
[34:57.440 --> 35:06.480]  and you're precious incredibly powerful word of mouth that we're overriding the
[35:06.480 --> 35:10.080]  system right now and they're getting madder they're getting more angry they're
[35:10.080 --> 35:15.080]  getting more out of control but I hardly ever I say that more and more I do it
[35:15.080 --> 35:20.280]  play a clip twice in the same show but I'm gonna air the Taylor Swift again
[35:20.280 --> 35:24.360]  because some of you probably just joined us and I didn't have time to really
[35:24.360 --> 35:29.120]  finish commenting on it not only is she quoted in the official communist China
[35:29.120 --> 35:35.040]  newspapers and in others against President Trump and saying oh China's
[35:35.040 --> 35:39.040]  trying to save the American people by saving us from Trump these are actual
[35:39.040 --> 35:43.360]  quotes by the communist Chinese government and by the Washington Post
[35:43.360 --> 35:50.400]  parroting word for word what they're saying they don't tell you that it's
[35:50.400 --> 35:59.240]  actual Communist Party Communist Party talking points from them you see it
[35:59.240 --> 36:03.720]  from them when they officially put it out but then you see it repeated by the
[36:03.720 --> 36:09.600]  Washington Post and others that is beyond insane but that's the point we've
[36:09.600 --> 36:16.440]  gotten to when even one of my oldest crew members been here 18 years his
[36:16.440 --> 36:21.720]  sister will not talk to his mother and will not let them see the grandchildren
[36:21.720 --> 36:26.600]  and barely talks to him and just says I just hope China can be Trump they're so
[36:26.600 --> 36:33.360]  good I wish we had a leader like Xi and my friend says to her that's crazy honey
[36:33.360 --> 36:40.360]  he's a mass murders you'll shut up that's pro-trump propaganda they can teach
[36:40.360 --> 36:46.120]  them to love a literal mass murder and they we showed this last week they put
[36:46.120 --> 36:50.120]  huge hammer and sickles all around the neighborhood where we're at and saying
[36:50.120 --> 36:56.880]  Antifa rise up crush the state well the state in America is we the people our
[36:56.880 --> 37:01.720]  Constitution our bill of rights our due process it's not perfect but it's the
[37:01.720 --> 37:06.920]  opposite of communist China if you've got two pole stars America looking for
[37:06.920 --> 37:11.760]  liberty not perfect but trying to get there and a much better history China is
[37:11.760 --> 37:17.800]  the all-time greatest oppressor not in 6,000 years of recorded human history
[37:17.800 --> 37:22.960]  have we seen anything that comes close nothing Hitler Stalin nothing comes
[37:22.960 --> 37:29.760]  close pull pot nothing comes close then to the communist Chinese and so I harp
[37:29.760 --> 37:34.400]  on this and I harp on this because it's all you got to know I mean every day
[37:34.400 --> 37:38.920]  they're eclipsing Trump is worse than Hitler Trump needs to be killed they
[37:38.920 --> 37:46.520]  say it just gets crazier and crazier and more out of control by the minute I
[37:46.520 --> 37:50.160]  mean we played this clip a few days ago we're gonna play it in a few minutes
[37:50.160 --> 37:55.320]  after we play Taylor Swift again and they go to your calls where they have
[37:55.320 --> 38:00.480]  Washington Post columnist saying we've got a burned down conservatives
[38:00.480 --> 38:10.040]  facilities literally they're not even saying figuratively anymore because
[38:10.040 --> 38:16.120]  they're gearing up realizing they're not going to win at the ballot box and they
[38:16.120 --> 38:20.200]  say we've got to eradicate their culture it always grows back it's too
[38:20.200 --> 38:28.040]  powerful yeah being pro family pro god pro private property pro gun pro self
[38:28.040 --> 38:34.080]  defense what person doesn't know that just because some antifa crazy person
[38:34.080 --> 38:37.080]  goes and kills a bunch of folks that we should turn our guns in that's why we
[38:37.080 --> 38:41.160]  have our guns just like when some Islamic runs over a couple hundred people in
[38:41.160 --> 38:45.640]  France including dozens little kids and kills them we don't ban 18 wheelers
[38:45.640 --> 38:51.360]  because some psycho stole one I was to walk up and smash this coffee cup
[38:51.360 --> 38:59.280]  across somebody's face they wouldn't ban coffee cups I could probably kill
[38:59.280 --> 39:04.480]  somebody with this coffee cup ramming it into their temple are you gonna blame
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.680]  the coffee cup you're gonna blame me so here's Taylor Swift quoted she should
[39:09.680 --> 39:12.720]  have voted for Hillary Trump screwing everything up in the Communist Party
[39:12.720 --> 39:20.280]  China meanwhile she's at a Taylor Swift event with a bunch of obese men dressed
[39:20.280 --> 39:25.200]  up like babies that's the kid club movement that's the whole simulated
[39:25.200 --> 39:32.080]  pedophilia thing which they now admit and she's there saying oh my gosh
[39:32.080 --> 39:37.720]  Trump you didn't pass my quality bill or whatever that means brainwashing of
[39:37.720 --> 39:41.840]  kids paying for sex changes I mean people to get your testicles cut off go
[39:41.840 --> 39:45.080]  ahead just I'm not paying for it like you would have your nose cut off you want
[39:45.080 --> 39:48.560]  body modification want to cut your ears off put horns on your head great I'm
[39:48.560 --> 39:53.120]  not paying for your breast implants I'm not paying for your abortion I'm not
[39:53.120 --> 39:58.080]  paying to get your tallywhacker cut off this is all common-sense stuff you're
[39:58.080 --> 40:01.840]  mentally you don't want to cut your Johnson off I'm not paying for it and
[40:01.840 --> 40:08.480]  so in China someone be arrested promoting this the gays get executed but
[40:08.480 --> 40:12.920]  none of that's lost on her she's rooting against Trump they know that that
[40:12.920 --> 40:17.160]  type of lifestyle when it gets all of the craziness destroys cultures does
[40:17.160 --> 40:22.200]  every time in cycles and so they'll put you in jail for it but she doesn't say
[40:22.200 --> 40:26.240]  a word about them it's all about how Trump's bad here it is
[40:26.240 --> 40:31.360]  Taylor Swift winning her second video of the year Moonman for her equality
[40:31.360 --> 40:37.040]  anthem you need to calm down but Swift was pretty fired up about why the Trump
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.200]  White House has not acknowledged her Equality Act petition for LGBTQ rights
[40:42.200 --> 40:46.040]  which was launched with that signal single
[40:46.040 --> 40:52.920]  at the end of this video there was a petition and there still is a petition
[40:52.920 --> 40:57.240]  for the Equality Act which basically just says we all deserve equal rights
[40:57.240 --> 41:03.720]  under the law it now has half a million signatures which
[41:03.720 --> 41:10.600]  so again it's all empty it's all hollow it's all a division it's all a fraud and
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.520]  it's all about promoting an agenda to depopulate the nation and weaken it I
[41:14.520 --> 41:18.400]  don't hate people individually for their sexual proclivities I'm saying the
[41:18.400 --> 41:22.480]  pushing of all this is to sabotage the nation China openly funds it here but
[41:22.480 --> 41:26.820]  outlaws it there put that in your pipe and smoke it now I spoke about this we
[41:26.820 --> 41:33.080]  played the full clip a couple days ago but again ladies and gentlemen this is
[41:33.080 --> 41:38.400]  critical to understand the Washington Post columnist goes on TV and says it's
[41:38.400 --> 41:42.000]  time to burn down conservatives with no survivors close quote here it is
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.280]  yes it's burned down the Republican Party we have to level them because if
[41:47.280 --> 41:52.040]  there are survivors if there are people who weather this storm they will do it
[41:52.040 --> 41:56.200]  again they will take this as confirmation that hey it just pays to ride the
[41:56.200 --> 42:01.040]  waves look at me I've made it through and so up and down the ticket federal
[42:01.040 --> 42:05.520]  state local offices the country has to repudiate this it is not a normal
[42:05.520 --> 42:09.480]  administration and when these people say oh you can't criticize us it will deter
[42:09.480 --> 42:15.520]  public service it will deter people who are liars who are enablers who are
[42:15.520 --> 42:19.520]  really bad people and they should be deterred all right back that up five
[42:19.520 --> 42:23.120]  seconds and just hit pause for TV viewers if you want to know what traders
[42:23.120 --> 42:27.360]  look like if you want to know what sandbags look like what astro turf looks
[42:27.360 --> 42:35.920]  like if you ever wanted in your life to see the problem in culture and the
[42:35.920 --> 42:40.440]  problem in society then that's it can we just put the video or just play it
[42:40.440 --> 42:45.680]  again if we can do that that'd be great that's what people to see the folks that
[42:45.680 --> 42:48.720]  I'm talking about right there look at the looks in their eyes look at the
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.480]  arrogance look at the hate look at the weirdness crush us burn us down bully us
[42:53.480 --> 42:59.720]  intimidate us these people are authoritarians one half of the incredible

[44:06.520 --> 44:09.600]  all the censorship of the tax and fake lawsuits the rest of it I would talk
[44:09.600 --> 44:12.640]  about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were
[44:12.640 --> 44:15.480]  and I have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and
[44:15.480 --> 44:18.760]  instead the last few years I'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[44:18.760 --> 44:21.320]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy a supplements because they
[44:21.320 --> 44:23.920]  know how great they are and how wonderful they were and the left always has
[44:23.920 --> 44:28.400]  headlines everywhere Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims
[44:28.400 --> 44:33.880]  or supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement
[44:33.880 --> 44:36.960]  has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction it won't look at
[44:36.960 --> 44:40.360]  it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs
[44:40.360 --> 44:43.880]  are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and
[44:43.880 --> 44:46.960]  do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not
[44:46.960 --> 44:50.160]  with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's

[45:11.440 --> 45:15.720]  nation and today the communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week
[45:15.720 --> 45:21.200]  ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what

[50:26.760 --> 50:32.720]  since they said 80 something cents in each glass bottle of this I'm not going
[50:32.720 --> 50:36.120]  to get into what these expensive enzymes do they don't just help you break down
[50:36.120 --> 50:41.480]  fat or break down protein in the gut it does it in the intestines and if you
[50:41.480 --> 50:48.960]  want to get flushed out this is beyond probiotics just like our anti mold and

[51:39.280 --> 51:49.000]  that cost us almost $18 nobody puts $18 in a meat enzyme pill this is I wanted
[51:49.000 --> 51:53.920]  the best I did it most brands out there have $2 in them and it still works this

[52:39.280 --> 52:42.400]  people think and I agree this it depends on your physiology this is better
[52:42.400 --> 52:47.000]  because it's cold press it's less of the herbs but they're cold pressed they

[54:52.720 --> 54:57.640]  you're listening to an AM or FM station or you're watching us on a local TV
[54:57.640 --> 55:03.360]  station call the local UHF VHA or cable thank them call their sponsors and

[55:28.520 --> 55:33.000]  like Tennessee or you name it is doing a lot more for the Lord's work and fighting
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.760]  for the unborn and though they're already born than any of these so-called
[55:36.760 --> 55:40.880]  churches there's some good churches but not many they all want to hide out do
[55:40.880 --> 55:44.480]  whatever they don't say no word about the antichrist the market the bees the
[55:44.480 --> 55:48.440]  microchipping it's all here and so if you think supporting this show is
[55:48.440 --> 55:53.280]  important it is just listen to me please because you're the wind in our sales
[55:53.280 --> 55:56.440]  you're everything it is just as important to support your local TV and
[55:56.440 --> 56:01.360]  radio stations as it is to support the mothership broadcast so I'm thanking you
[56:01.360 --> 56:06.760]  for the support but I'm asking you humbly please reach out and support those
[56:06.760 --> 56:10.840]  local stations it's absolutely critical if you call a station they go well we
[56:10.840 --> 56:16.520]  don't really take donations say okay then have a coffee mug that's $50 that
[56:16.520 --> 56:21.560]  you mug club like Crowder does where you buy the mug for 50 bucks and you do it
[56:21.560 --> 56:28.160]  each year because NPR gets billions in taxpayer money and then they get all
[56:28.160 --> 56:31.680]  this foundation money that's tax-free and they beg for money every month
[56:31.680 --> 56:35.200]  meanwhile conservative talk radio is under attack they're shutting it down all
[56:35.200 --> 56:39.560]  over the place because they don't want you to have a voice don't let them get
[56:39.560 --> 56:43.400]  away with it you heard that lady earlier let's go out to break with her
[56:43.400 --> 56:48.120]  saying shut us down don't let us weather the storm no we're gonna all weather
[56:48.120 --> 56:51.240]  the storm together we're gonna hang together hang separate as Benjamin
[56:51.240 --> 56:55.760]  Franklin said here it is it's not only that Trump has to lose but that all his
[56:55.760 --> 57:00.320]  enablers have to lose they have to we have to collectively in essence burn
[57:00.320 --> 57:04.760]  down the Republican Party we have to level them because if there are
[57:04.760 --> 57:09.640]  survivors if there are people who weather this storm they will do it again they
[57:09.640 --> 57:13.960]  will take this as confirmation that hey it just pays to ride the waves look at
[57:13.960 --> 57:18.920]  me I've made it through and so up and down the ticket federal state local
[57:18.920 --> 57:23.320]  offices the country has to repudiate this it is not a normal administration and
[57:23.320 --> 57:26.960]  when these people say oh you can't criticize us it will deter public
[57:26.960 --> 57:33.080]  service it will deter people who are liars who are enablers who are really
[57:33.080 --> 57:36.320]  bad people and they should listen which you're a really bad person you're an
[57:36.320 --> 57:41.040]  authoritarian dirtbag bully I've heard your challenge I accept it and so does
[57:41.040 --> 57:56.240]  my audience of activists it's just heavy heavy heavy make no mistake it's we're

[58:07.480 --> 58:12.160]  seen division like this in America since Vietnam it's a form of fascism the
[58:12.160 --> 58:16.520]  High Court will examine free speech rights and social media multiple online

[59:52.280 --> 59:56.000]  to the Alex Jones show
[59:56.000 --> 01:00:15.760]  we patiently await the Democrats to narrow down their field of presidential
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.920]  hopefuls we can analyze the differences between the Democrats leading
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:24.200]  candidate former vice president Joe Biden who maintains a double-digit lead
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:28.080]  over the rest of the Democratic field and our current president Donald J.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.680]  Trump they both made recent speeches in the key granite state of New Hampshire
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.760]  which is always the first to vote in the primaries I saw some fake polls put out
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:53.160]  by the fake news media and I said that I'm tied I'm tied with three of the other
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:01:03.360]  candidates the Democrats I'm tied in New Hampshire I don't think so consider it a
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.800]  preview of what's to come if Joe Biden manages not to grope anyone or gaff
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:14.600]  himself into oblivion and makes it to the 2020 presidential debate stage you
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:21.040]  know that well I love you too and I love this town the danger might come back so
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.120]  often I may not leave this is God's country man what a beautiful town we're
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:30.400]  actually here today to officially launch our campaign to win the great state of
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:38.320]  New Hampshire in 2020 the first detail is blatantly obvious crowd size we know
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.680]  Biden's crowd is small regardless of the illusion of television but Trump's
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.680]  crowd well even a five-year-old or possibly even CNN could see the massive
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.400]  difference the president is returning to an old-favorite obsession the size of
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:58.080]  the crowds at his rallies I think they said 17,000 people outside that couldn't
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.680]  get in the fire marshals close it at a certain level the arena announced I don't
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:10.080]  know the people at the arena that I broke Elton John's record the thing is
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:15.120]  pretty much everybody reported that the president had a big crowd in New Hampshire
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.280]  though there was a viral tweet that showed some empty seats and we know how
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.160]  seriously the president takes his Twitter so maybe that had something to do
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.480]  with it but CNN confirmed today that President Trump broke the attendance
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:33.120]  record at his rally last week even beating Elton John secondly rhetoric
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:38.040]  Biden is somewhere between a moderate broken record and an undecided liberal
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:43.680]  socialist Democrat we the people in order to form a more perfect union it's
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:53.760]  unique in history no nation no tyrant can take us down only America can rip
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:59.200]  itself apart and Biden apparently has no idea that the more he exaggerates the
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.280]  truth of what was spoken by a sitting president the more he angers anyone with
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.640]  half a brain that knows which way the wind blows and you know can you think
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:14.560]  of any president who when you saw what happened in Charlottesville said they're
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:21.360]  good people on both sides and third Biden's foreign policy is backwards
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:25.240]  claiming that he would stand up to China is laughable in the face of hunter
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.400]  Biden's billion dollar pay-to-play deal known as bow high harvest which has
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:34.240]  still managed to avoid the scrutiny it deserves while Trump is waging a trade
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.480]  war with a communist country that has dug its claws deep into the heart of
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.760]  America for decades and as part of my trade deal with China it's been very
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:49.560]  important and president she said he's going to do it so far he has not done
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:57.800]  it but I said you have to stop sending us fentanyl have to and you have to
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:05.600]  criminalize in China the making of fentanyl and so far he has not come
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.800]  through but I think he will and of course with Biden the gaffes never stop
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.760]  this time around he thought he was in Vermont rather than New Hampshire
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.240]  according to an exchange he had with a reporter anyone interested in the future
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:23.920]  of this country can plainly see that Trump is going to tear into Biden like
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.040]  Mike Tyson in his prime president Trump is only getting started and a lot of
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:33.600]  Americans want to see what is around the corner but Joe Biden is as stale as
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.720]  his day-old bread John bound reporting that's right Trump's brain is stuck on
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.680]  winning Biden is emblematic of the rotting emphasis that is the traders
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:49.200]  that has sold us out our surrender is over the surrender is over the spirit
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:56.440]  of liberty is loose it is rising nothing will stand in its way

[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:14.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:21.200]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.840]  so the Democratic Party is openly siding with China the Washington Post New
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:30.240]  York Times have headlines like this he's choice destroy Trump or save him and
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.600]  weaken America Chinese government puts out those exact same statements all
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:38.320]  Americans we need you to bring down Trump are going to save you will your
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.320]  friends yes that's why it's a death penalty of your film of fentanyl in
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.840]  China they allow its mass production a legal shipping to the US there's a
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:52.960]  massive bust every day of it tons of it being shipped in hundreds of thousands
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.960]  of Chinese chai-kong gun parts illegally being shipped into the US that's gun
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.440]  control I support because it's a communist regime circumventing our laws
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.800]  and shipping weapons to the gangs they control I first learned about that back
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:10.440]  in 1997 back on the LA Times was still somewhat of a reputable newspaper but
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.800]  right now let's go to your calls what do you make of the treason how brazen how
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:22.120]  naked how insane the open-rooting by the left now as as G as seen as this
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.480]  bulwark against Trump I mean I knew two and a half years ago at Debo's they
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:30.240]  bragged that Z would stop Trump him and Yunker made statements like that about
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:37.160]  how oh we'll crush America in a trade war we're actually winning right now and
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:51.080]  you can hear the screams and the peeling of the people Hillary totally on their
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:55.440]  payroll they're the ones that hate America then they tell us oh Trump's a
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:59.080]  Russian he's an outsider that's why he's trying to save the country these people
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:04.120]  are sick but coming up at for calls Taylor Bennett joins us she's mad at
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:08.760]  her about red flag laws I was mad too but I was told and it was true that he
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.680]  was ropa-doping them to get them to ask for total gun confiscation and they get
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.880]  nothing you'll get nothing and like it judge smells tell spaulding well it's
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.000]  the same thing I still don't like playing that game but that's what Trump's
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  doing is jerking their chain I agree he shouldn't even do that he should attack
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.440]  big pharma and the mass murder pills he's already pissed at drugs period it
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:34.720]  killed his brother alcohol he's a teetotaler and you get him on the
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.920]  Prozac route of those hundreds of type drugs and he learns what those are doing
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:44.160]  they're done they'll shut up about guns all day because 99% of crazy shooters
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.640]  are on those but instead of bitching about Trump and red flag loss he was
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:52.600]  never gonna do it folks for my intel go after him and say go after the mass
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:57.120]  murder suicide pills like I told Pierce Morgan okay we're gonna go to George
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.800]  we're gonna go to Duke we're gonna go to John we're gonna everybody you're on
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.000]  the air George thanks for holding from New Mexico sir hey Alex thanks for
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.760]  taking my call yeah absolutely China definitely the biggest threat you know
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.760]  to our Constitution our sovereignty and the tentacles that they planted in so
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:19.600]  deep into into our society is just insidious but you know let's face it I
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:25.040]  mean President Trump is by far the greatest president that we've ever got
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.200]  to experience in our modern day time we know that for a fact and thank God for
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.960]  him because of because of him he's been able to kind of basically you know
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:38.720]  halted the complete takeover of the globalist agenda and we're grateful for
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.360]  that and isn't it incredible that we're actually living and seeing it and then
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.880]  more people aren't more thankful on the right that at least look let's keep him
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.120]  honest let's stay on his ass light fires under his butt but let's at least
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.960]  thank God that we've come this far let's appreciate something well the swamp
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.720]  runs deep man you know and it's infiltrated both sides and we're in a
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:04.240]  great battle right now but the truth is is you know Trump has been able to to
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.800]  kind of keep us alive you know my biggest fear Alex though is what's gonna
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.520]  happen when Trump is not around because we know Trump's gonna win in a landslide
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.440]  he's waking up a lot of people and a lot of things are happening because of him
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:20.360]  but my biggest fear Alex is what's gonna happen when when we don't have you
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.560]  know our commander-in-chief you know and and and what's gonna happen after
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.720]  Trump comes in that's my biggest fear I totally agree with you that's my biggest
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.560]  concern and we better start making preparations for them to steal 2020
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.400]  because it he knows their fake polls he's done internal polling we've done it
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.880]  as well they had 15 points more Democrats on the average polls so that
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:44.480]  that's how they cook at day one they also only target people via email and
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.120]  phone call but they already know our Democrats a certain skew that's how
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.920]  they do it again I mean members CNN was having bulls were Hillary wins by 68%
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.240]  New York Times 98% chance Hillary wins scientific algorithm that means they
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.640]  pull it out of their their their globalist rear end you know in the
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.360]  Chinese government in there but in between breaks of you know them them
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:09.360]  them raping the country they in in engaged in that activity and so we
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.280]  should have a whole show where we open the phones up and ask the question what
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.000]  do we do when Trump's gone because that's a great point till Scousers made
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.480]  that if we don't basically finish the Democratic Party like they're trying to
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:25.200]  finish us the pro-Americans the populist they're gonna eradicate
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.600]  everything they've I just played it last hour that's their battle cry
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.480]  eradication shut it down in the free country and so these are globalists
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.560]  working with outside powers we've got to try them they've got to get arrested
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.400]  they're the ones working for foreign powers they're the ones saying they
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.920]  want to kill us they want to arrest us they want to bully us well we have to
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.160]  stop playing games politically and really call them out for what they are
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.640]  and that's happening right now they're losing I believe if we can keep America
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.440]  awake and realizing how serious the fight is and not going to sleep because
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.840]  Trump's there we will win if we don't we're screwed thank you for the call
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.840]  great points sir let's go ahead and take another call it was an excellent point
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:09.000]  he made Duke in Maine you're on the air Duke are you doing Alex good brother I
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.720]  just wanted to make this point that I haven't heard anybody talk about I heard
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:21.480]  you talk about it back in 2012 about how Obama allowed Chinese generals to tour
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:27.520]  our military bases and I have not heard anybody talk about that since you and I
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.880]  just wanted to hear your thoughts on that and I'll take your answer off the
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.880]  air thank you sir well they just eat they I remember it was even in the
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.200]  defense publications it didn't make a lot on the national news but they did
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.000]  detailed tours and they even had exchange programs with communist Chinese
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.120]  in secure areas and we know that it was Obama that gave them the operations
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:54.120]  manuals it was a Obama that gave them the office of personal management hack
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:00.840]  21 million names I mean basically Obama totally sold us out to China because
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.560]  again they're all invested in China and China is supposed to take over in this
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.880]  century and so I do remember that that would be well worth revisiting remember
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:15.600]  back in 1996 97 Bill Clinton had Chinese generals in the White House more than
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:20.360]  what was it more than 30 times with briefcases big square briefcases the
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.640]  big ones like you carry a typewriter in full of hundred dollar bills and that
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.800]  was confirmed they went all executive privilege he can take money from foreign
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:34.480]  powers if Trump had Russians in the White House giving him suitcases of cash
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.760]  I'd say try his ass for treason and hang him up by his toenails but that
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.440]  didn't happen it was again hair Clinton thank you for calling thank you for
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:47.440]  holding sir really was excellent questions let's go ahead now and take
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.440]  another call here let's talk to Daniel and Arizona thanks for holding her on

[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.720]  big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence social
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.280]  economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades and
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.640]  because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.840]  independent free press that care about this the ordinary members of the public
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.960]  in the audience that care about this has to bring real social political
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:21.400]  economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.720]  and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.360]  the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:31.480]  into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression the
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.880]  informers audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty across
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.000]  the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.720]  original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.680]  media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.640]  try to shake people's thoughts and then the Whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:55.120]  it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.680]  even it is what what you just saw
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:05.080]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:17.400]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show websites that they hope you don't share
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:22.560]  are news wars.com and info wars.com so whatever you do don't tell people on
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.600]  your text messages or on your email about word of mouth hey info wars.com is
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:30.040]  demonized because it's exposing the traders in our government and
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:34.120]  corporations merged with the Chinese communists and basically defeated this
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:38.520]  country till America woke up and elected Trump whatever you do don't visit
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.920]  info wars.com and news wars.com whatever you do don't share the videos and the
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:47.000]  articles to submit to Hillary and the globalist of course I'm being
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.400]  sarcastic I got a lot of their news I want to hit we're continuing with your
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:56.840]  phone calls right now on the treason of China that is the treason of people
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.600]  working with China in our government in our corporations in our media and
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:04.720]  openly coming out in the Washington Post CNN you name it and saying geez good
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:09.640]  Trump's bad thank God he's standing up to that monster Trump when all they have
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.920]  is these internal tariffs and systems against us and are absolutely
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:21.240]  shillacking us up one side and down the other so going back to Daniel I've even
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.680]  seen some right-wing or fake libertarian pushback in the comments on info wars
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:28.920]  oh you know you've got all your reporters over there supporting a war
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:34.360]  supporting strife in Hong Kong no that's where the free people in China ran
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:37.560]  that's what we saved him from the Japanese in World War two and now the
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.760]  communists came in and chased him into there and they have a right to want to
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:44.760]  be independent and not under an unelected system that secretly arrest
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:48.040]  people and kills them I mean I can't help but support them that's a real
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:52.440]  independence movement that's not like funding the Arab Spring and overthrowing
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.800]  governments that are you know leaving Christians alone and putting ISIS in I
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:01.600]  did not support those regime changes so to me it's a no-brainer and yeah the
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.920]  Brexit's a great example Putin's a great example of nationalism against the
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:10.440]  globalist Trump's the biggest example now you've got the president down in
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:16.280]  Brazil it's incredible what's happening it's an amazing time to be alive ladies
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.280]  and gentlemen and we're all part of it but we're seeing the globalists try to
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:22.080]  bully us back in the submission some other points you wanted to add about
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.920]  Trump being a great example Daniel why do you support the folks they don't want
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.520]  independence they just want to not be secretly arrested not have face-scanning
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:33.360]  cameras and not have a Chinese Communist social score where if they don't support
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.160]  the party they suddenly can't get on a train or an airplane I mean we better be
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.040]  doing what the folks in Hong Kong are doing right now there's the same systems
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:45.960]  coming in here yeah they just want to live a peaceful life with loving it you
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:50.920]  know I've got a couple things to say here the bravado of Trump is
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:57.840]  freaking awesome just I know he's typing everything out but bring on the
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:04.280]  freaking storm Trump you know and all the Dems they're just sharding in their
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:10.080]  pants right now they are just infuriated that Trump is there and he's not
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:16.000]  playing that whole game anymore it's just incredible you know I cheer up
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.800]  listening to Trump and what he's saying sometimes oh he's definitely look they've
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.480]  been trying to demoralize us Hollywood the chai comms this is a
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:27.280]  demoralization tactic of a foreign military we are under foreign globalist
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:30.680]  attack that's what it is cut and dry that's what they're saying you shouldn't
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:34.120]  even have a nation we shouldn't have borders why Trump's saying we should love
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:39.720]  our country's white supremacist this this is literal foreign military garbage
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:44.920]  thank you for the call and it just outrageous me that more Democrats don't
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.920]  wake up and say no to this but see once they get them hating Trump they will
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:54.160]  then hate everything once they take that poison pill it's like it's like
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:58.880]  putting a cyanide tablet in a big chunk of beef and giving it to a dog the dogs
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:03.160]  gonna slurp it down and die and once the Democrats decide to believe whatever
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:08.280]  they're told by the media they actually believe we're Russian agents they
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:13.600]  actually believe that Trump's a Nazi and they're siding with the chai cops I
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:19.560]  mean that's mind-control all right who's been holding longest now that would
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:25.360]  be that would be John and Georgia John thanks for holding her on the air
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.960]  hey Alex how you doing it's an honor to be on here with you honor to talk to you
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:35.840]  sir yeah just want to tell you that I have been the suspect of bomber number
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:40.000]  two in Oklahoma building like to talk to you about that other day too as well but
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.560]  I want to show you an experience I did you have your phones breaking up a
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:49.680]  little just talk right in the receiver okay I've gotten Lyme disease from a
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:56.040]  tick I took the Claudio silver I doubled up on the doses and totally cleared up
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:59.200]  the Lyme disease I wanted to share that with you wow that's incredible because
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.960]  antibiotics can hardly knock it out well I took the antibiotics for a long time
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:09.040]  and pain went from my knees all the way into my back and elbows but the Claudio
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.360]  silver completely wiped it out I hadn't had an episode that well that's
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.800]  beautiful brother my question to you is is that you know we know that the chai
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:25.080]  comms are in every facet of our society they're in the media they're in our
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.960]  telecommunications they're in the government was Nancy Pelosi had her
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:36.080]  driver house it was it was dying fine side but but but they all as part of
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.960]  getting the chai comm money through u.s. companies you put an agent in your
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:44.120]  office and that's why Obama literally gave them the office of personnel
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:48.800]  management hack I mean so you're absolutely right so knowing that they're
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:55.160]  in all these areas and passes how can we even hope to think that we can fight
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:59.320]  the Chinese off the continent if we can't even take care of it in the
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:03.320]  column well that's why getting Trump in as a beachhead he's literally like a
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.640]  king surrounding a lion surrounded by hyenas and so he's able with the
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.520]  executive power under the Constitution to give those orders and that's why
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:16.320]  they're so upset and fighting him so hard is because a lot of their people
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:21.320]  are still staying behind now as the chai comm money gets cut off they're
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:25.480]  starting to panic even more trying to get the chai comms back in power and it's
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.760]  not just the chai comms it's the globalist that parlayed us power to the
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.640]  chai comms and then basically collapsed a lot of our power in the last few years
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.000]  of Obama and then since they saw Trump got in they tried to even finish that
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.600]  but it hasn't worked so we've really grabbed victory from the jaws of defeat
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.280]  on this but we're not out of the woods yet but you're right it is listen
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:51.160]  George Washington I'm not saying to this but George Washington when he was
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:54.720]  president they would just go arrest these people and then they would have
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.920]  trials and you know what they would do but foreign agents would would also just
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:03.960]  be grabbed and would be given trials and then they'd be executed and that's
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.320]  really what you do I mean in China or anywhere else if I mean they've caught
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.280]  us spies and they executed them with the office of personnel management hack
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:15.920]  Obama said listen I'm really for you I really hate America here's all of our
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.920]  agents worldwide here's all their social security numbers here's all the
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:23.240]  government employees numbers here's the keys to everything and they gave China
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:27.200]  that and then Google and Apple move there gave them all the code keys to all
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:33.000]  your devices and China basically is now interfaced with YouTube and Google not
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.360]  just Southern Poverty Law Center and they're the ones in your accounts I mean
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:43.640]  this is all admitted so yeah Trump really needs to just declare an actual
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:46.600]  emergency and seize control the telecommunications because the Chinese
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:50.520]  have already seized it with with the globalist and so only a response like
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:54.360]  that will fix it and that's why they're so scared that any minute he might
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:58.600]  actually make the default proper move now I respect the president if he thinks
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.880]  he can remove this face sucker by cutting the money off the chai comms and
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:06.840]  making them negotiate and stop their attempt to take over that's probably
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:12.200]  better the problem is they haven't showed any inclination of stopping they
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.960]  have a real disrespect for us that they were able to buy off most of the public
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.720]  universities that they were able to get the Washington Post to say side with
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.800]  China against Trump they have a real disrespect for us and see us as weak and
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:28.320]  decadent and a large part of us are a large part of us aren't and so they've
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.920]  really misread America like Hitler and and and the Japanese and others did
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:38.680]  before and so great points anything else John yeah one of my main concerns is
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:43.920]  too is that there's so much Chinese tech floating around in America we knew that
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.520]  in desert storms I mean the hold on I'm gonna have you finish I apologize this

[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:05.400]  $180 so far this year and I feel like I'm stealing from you I buy so much in
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.840]  the store because I mean I don't want to give that money to Walmart I don't want
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:10.680]  to give that money to people are gonna donate it to causes I don't believe in
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.560]  so I rather give that money to you and then getting quality products the
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.680]  products that I do receive have changed my life I mean the X2 has really done a
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.880]  lot for me I've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better I think my
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:24.880]  kids they use the toothpaste my son used to get these little sore throat and he
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:28.000]  puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.840]  let me break this down for you I want high quality stuff in there I want a good
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:35.600]  price but I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:39.440]  it's 50% off I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off and so it's the same
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.960]  thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:46.720]  the plugs but listen when people get the Patriot points a lot of times it makes
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:50.120]  things a loss later because if you're already getting 10% off as you're on
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:54.040]  auto ship then we're doing 50% off and then you do something like that we have
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.080]  Patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support the
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:01.960]  globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators they are technocrats
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:05.840]  they are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:09.320]  live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:13.880]  destiny to merge with AI gods now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace we're
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:16.880]  fighting them hard right here in the third dimension but one of the biggest
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.600]  places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:24.800]  our lives is our bodies if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:29.880]  from fourslife.com I couldn't do it that's why we decided to take our

[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.720]  in fourslife.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:04.600]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:15.600]  you
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:38.400]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:42.520]  as the caller John was saying we're gonna finish up with him they go to Caitlin Bennett
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:48.240]  and more your calls as John was saying my segment be even back during Desert
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:56.200]  Shield Desert Storm in 1990 1991 it came out that I'm going for memory like 25
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:01.840]  percent of the defense chips and missiles and avionics and other systems
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:05.640]  were chai-com made and had back doors for them built in where they could get
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:11.280]  into them well now that's all admitted and when you realize that something like
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:16.640]  90% of our drugs I saw this number a few years ago and couldn't believe it but
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:22.560]  it's it's upwards of 90% of the drugs in this country are made in China then they
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:28.880]  make the illegal fentanyl and ship it in in mass and it's something like a hundred
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:34.760]  times stronger per dose than heroin they just received massive tonnage of it last
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:45.200]  week coming in through the land corridor into Mexico into the US and it's just
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:48.600]  it's just huge when you start thinking about the level of treason the
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:53.640]  Confucian institutes that took over all the major universities with hundreds of
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:57.760]  millions of dollars per school in some cases like UT over a hundred million
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:03.040]  dollars the last 10 years or so was given to UT and I was told about this by
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:08.800]  the feds and people I know five years ago this year they shut down the funding
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:13.360]  to UT saying was run by a Chinese general they caught SMU being run by it I
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:17.440]  mean this is just in Texas in my local newspapers so when we talk about this
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:23.080]  folks we're not just hyping this when they say Russia is involved that is a
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:31.040]  joke the chai-coms are dominating and the callers are rightfully saying why
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.160]  doesn't Trump just arrest him or whatever what it'll do to the stock market
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:41.480]  what it'll do it's it'll be a disaster but not as big as a disaster as if we
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.720]  let them keep doing this so Trump has totally taken the gloves off he's
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:50.160]  ordered the US government to tell US companies to move out of China as fast
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:55.800]  as they can and you bet it's a disruption more than 70% of the stuff
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:05.040]  made in the world's made in China now it's a joke of consumer goods and that's
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.080]  the position the globalists put us in and they've totally abused us and they
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:13.680]  have nothing but arrogance towards us so that's the position we're in I just
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:18.600]  marvel all these people still betting against America with China it's it's
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:22.880]  going to be a big deal but the biggest is Apple giving the code keys early last
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:27.640]  year and Reuters to all of the Apple IDs and and Apple said well when you
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:33.240]  headquarter in China that's what you do the Chinese government is in control of
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:36.760]  all Apple products they can get right into your phone anytime they want
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.840]  Google's over there with them and finally Marco Rubio is talking about it so
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:44.920]  when Marco Rubio I talked to him last year he made fun of me said get out of
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.520]  my face when I politely brought it up well now what went when when the
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:53.840]  Feringhey ambassador is finally talking about something then you know it's
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:58.000]  about to hit so we're in a full war Trump's being calm and polite about it
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.760]  but we are in a war not just a trade war finishing up with John in Georgia you
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:09.120]  had some other points to make about that yeah exactly what you just say and my
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:15.840]  main concern is that this kind of soul in depth in control of a lot of tech in
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:19.680]  the United States you'd even mentioned on a few shows ago about the Batman
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:24.120]  scenario where they could actually back out and see things through the
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:30.560]  telecom so now that China has Apple and Huawei we you know we've caught them in
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:36.120]  every fast they've been caught they haven't given us my concern is is the
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:43.320]  awesome power that they now have to be able to listen to our phone map out
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:49.960]  things and get any information they were at any time military bases just
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:54.960]  think of soldiers that have these phones on military bases are in secret places
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:58.480]  the thing you just said I should have led the show with that if they're banning
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:02.760]  Huawei phones a couple years ago and now Huawei 5g because they notice the
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:07.000]  chai comms are putting in for those that don't know at cost in rural communities
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.320]  but then the Pentagon two years ago went wait a minute they're putting them in
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.200]  only in rural communities right by military bases particularly up in Iowa
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:21.000]  at the sack base and other areas like that so absolutely and so Trump has to
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.680]  block it he has to arrest the head of the company and we've got to take the
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:30.000]  gloves off and Trump's doing it and they and they need to take control of Apple
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.720]  and all these well that was my next point is and I forgot to make it thank
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.840]  you for reminding me Apple's a bigger threat than Huawei Apple's doing exactly
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:43.600]  what Huawei is Apple has merged with the chai comms great point yeah that's
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.360]  that's all I have I appreciate it I interrupted you go ahead and make your
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:50.440]  point you're just you just be so excited to like you just there's so many points
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.560]  we know and I can't even lay them all out you're just reminding me it's insane
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.560]  we could sit here for 10 days talking about Chinese infiltration right when
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:03.040]  you put them all together though just think of the awesome power that they
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:09.600]  now control you have Google you have Facebook all these companies are aligned
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:15.920]  with China Apple not only that not only the small tech that we don't even talk
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:20.960]  about the computers chips and the technologies and refrigerators car
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:28.320]  everything everything we have trauma at some point has a piece of it and just
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:33.000]  think of the awesome power when you take all that technology and put it to
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.360]  together and you want information you're going to get it absolutely God bless
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:43.000]  you well that's why Google announced it two years ago we're not working with a
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.520]  Pentagon of the US government anymore we are moving to China to work on their
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:52.360]  deep mind and we're going to give them all the AI China has been chosen because
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:56.400]  they'll have clones they'll have killing of Christians killing a Buddhist they
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:00.240]  are totally evil and the globalists are totally evil so it is a match made in
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:03.960]  hell now we're going to go to break and for 15 minutes to the next hour Caitlyn
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.480]  Bennett is going to join us and we'll continue with calls as well there's
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:14.320]  also a central Texas gun shop owner and gun trainer a good friend of mine Michael
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.480]  Cargill has been on the show many times over the years he's all over the news
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.760]  now because right by where his really nice offices are in South Austin there
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.600]  are homeless camps set up there's homeless camps set up around where we're
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:30.720]  at in our area of Austin and so you know about San Francisco or you want to know
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:38.520]  about all these places the mayor admits that they are trying to collapse the
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:42.080]  society so that we quote take care of the poor now they're just advertising
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:49.840]  drug addicts and others coming into the cities coming into the areas and just
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:52.920]  lounging around the video they were about to show we'll get to later is
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:58.440]  almost got shooting up heroin on his company's porch and then pooping and
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:01.760]  that's what they do they shoot the heroin they pass out they crap all over
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:05.360]  the place and when you go on skid row you see people everywhere just covered
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.640]  the feces covered in flies having sex it's it's it's it's quite a sight I'm
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.360]  trying to be gross here folks but you think you've seen Hellraiser you think
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:17.960]  you've seen horror movies it's nothing on skid row imagine trannies having sex
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.440]  in piles of feces with flies all over them yes I've seen it I've smelled it
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:29.400]  ladies and gentlemen and I began reading the vomit and we started walking fast
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:33.960]  and we ended up running with Katie Hopkins running I've never run from a
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:39.920]  fight but I did run from the shriveled trannies with appeared well I'm not
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:44.800]  gonna give you more descriptions but it was about a hundred degrees and it was
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:50.120]  hell on earth and I must stop there we're gonna break them back sorry I'm
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:55.040]  going back to that horrible nightmare place Caitlyn Bennett of course is the
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:58.760]  Penn State gun girl she's gotten famous the last two years she just goes out and
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:02.920]  does good sweet interviews that are smart and they threaten to rape her they
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:05.840]  threaten to kill her they threaten to attack her they do attack her the left
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:11.520]  guys but who would ever know that Dan Crenshaw also known as the gay pirate
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:14.920]  but other than against the fact that he's a gay pirate that's the nickname the
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:21.560]  girls have for him here in the office no no Dan Crenshaw the Navy seal who is
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:27.080]  for gun control and who basically you know Texans he lost his primary at first
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.680]  thought that he was a Democrat the stuff he checked off on but the left's
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:34.200]  attacked even we don't agree with the left saying they want to kill him so
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.720]  I think the young Turks are trying to prop him up though but old Dan Crenshaw
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:42.120]  doesn't just talk about red flag laws he still wants them and by golly he believes
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:46.760]  without any judicial stuff or even any threats your guns should be taken he
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:50.800]  sent some really mean messages to Caitlyn Bennett we'll talk more about that not
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.720]  just that we come back stay with us we're not gonna just dwell on the gay pirate
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:05.280]  it's just heavy heavy heavy make no mistake it's we're not in Kansas anymore
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:09.080]  we're not in Kansas anymore
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:15.480]  if you have a corrupt media you don't have a democracy I don't think we've
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:20.160]  seen division like this in America since Vietnam it's a form of fascism the
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:24.480]  High Court will examine free speech rights and social media multiple online

[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:59.880]  calls I see some on red flag laws as well a lot of listeners actually got mad
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:04.200]  at me when I came out and I said listen Trump's not gonna actually do the red
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:07.400]  flag laws this is a tactic to get the left to come out and say they want total
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:12.680]  gun bans then they get nothing but I said Trump's still playing with fire and I
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:20.000]  don't like it because it gives lip service to the lie that extra judicial
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.960]  confiscation of guns without due process without somebody breaking the law is
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:28.840]  exactly what they've done in Europe and everywhere else and it will lead to
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:32.840]  total confiscation well Dan Crenshaw went further and he put out his red flag
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:36.720]  ideas he said well we're just talking about a family member that's concerned
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:41.320]  or a police officer you mean a police officer that swears out a report that
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:44.680]  you threaten to kill somebody yeah then take them until we find out what you're
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:52.600]  planning to do that's already on the books 42 times the craze shooter last
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:57.760]  February last year in Florida Parkland said he was gonna kill people he's
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:01.600]  known as a school shooter he'd been kicked out of school under a leftist law
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.080]  they passed that minorities can commit crimes four times and not go to jail for
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:11.320]  it many cases mr. Cruz was allowed to do that he also threatened the FBI twice
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:14.280]  when they came to see him said I'll kill you he walked around saying I'm gonna
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:18.640]  kill you why did he have guns he wasn't even legal for him to have him and every
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:21.800]  other time it's the same you have this anti-fascist shooter in Ohio this other
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:25.800]  guy in Texas was they just changed his social media so Dan Crenshaw hey great
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:29.160]  you went over and fought in the Middle East wonderful lost your eyeball I don't
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.880]  agree with the young Turks Hassan pecker or picker whatever his name is saying you
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.880]  want you know that you deserve to be dire whatever but we don't need to
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:41.040]  compromise on the Second Amendment the Democrats say it's not about sensible
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:45.400]  gun laws it's about taking our guns and that's how the Revolutionary War
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:50.280]  started 1776 they didn't say oh at Bunker Hill well some crazy guy might get a
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:54.240]  gun someday hurt somebody so you got to turn yours in they said we're coming to
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:58.320]  conquer you were taking your guns so Danny boy you ought to go join the
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:02.000]  Democratic Party and be honest about what you're doing now I don't want to
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.120]  spend time on him because he's not that important you know I know Sarah not live
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.800]  attacked him and that's what made him popular and he probably would have got
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:13.000]  elected one for that sometimes I think the lefts making these statements against
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:18.120]  him to prop him up because it made him get elected when he was losing and it's
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:21.280]  the same thing with the young Turks saying they want to you know kill him or
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.920]  whatever and then that makes him popular I think we got a Trojan horse here on
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:29.600]  our hands a lot of Texans think that too but that doesn't matter the guy is now
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:33.720]  a pirate that wants to board us and take our guns now people said well that
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:36.840]  aren't you mad at Trump well you know it's Trump shelved it Crenshaw still
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:39.720]  pushing it and I don't want to be enemies with Crenshaw maybe he's a good guy
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:45.720]  okay but other than the I patch mistake you know we've got a problem here I
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.440]  don't want to spend all the time I want to get into your concerns about red
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:51.700]  flag laws and Trump Caitlyn because that's really who's important as
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:56.400]  president Trump but obviously you did a video about this it's on your web page
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.400]  we'll put on screen a Liberty Hangout tell folks that URL and you did a nice
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:04.280]  20 minute video that breaks it down but specifically he ridiculed you he used
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:08.600]  psychological warfare tactics to tell you you were small and nobody and never
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:14.080]  responded to your very very nice lengthy messages when he first contacted you so
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:18.280]  he thinks clearly he's smarter than everybody else yeah you think he's some
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:23.880]  intellectual genius over here what he failed to really do is sit there and
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:27.920]  tell me I will protect your rights I'll make sure no one is able to hurt you and
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:32.000]  you're able to defend yourself you could tell him that he was so bothered by a
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.360]  little girl going out there and making a meme about him I all he wanted to do was
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:41.160]  criticize my activism the way I do my reporting and that's fine that doesn't
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:45.960]  bother me I don't Dan Crenshaw isn't gonna hurt my feelings but what even if
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:50.400]  I were like the worst person in the world that has nothing to do with his
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:54.960]  position in power to be able to take my rights away from me and all I was looking
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:52:00.920]  for was to convince him that his ideas of Republican red flag laws are no
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.960]  different than the last I was like saying that democratic socialism is the
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:09.200]  same or different than socialism forget we don't have time to go through it all
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:12.880]  I want you to give people your URL and also the name of the video that's gone
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:17.040]  viral because I mean you show it you read the whole thing his messages to you
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:20.840]  private messages on Twitter he says oh we saw the bad thing you did at the
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:25.520]  burning event you go in politely sit there and they throw you out and he
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:29.300]  makes fun of you and goes oh look you're a victim your first amendment this guy
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:34.680]  sounds like a punk ass yeah so he just wanted to insult me and the title of the
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:38.180]  video is just Dan Crenshaw messaged me and that's at Liberty Hangout on our
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:42.120]  YouTube and I break it all down I go through and I wasn't going to release
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:45.800]  the messages at first because I wanted to be respectful even though he wasn't
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:49.440]  respectful towards me but the more I read it I was like what the heck people
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:53.660]  deserve to know what he's doing so he kept trying to beat me into being rude
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:56.840]  to him he kept trying to beat me into insulting him or making fun of him
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:00.760]  because when he first messaged me I just wanted to be like okay like you're
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:05.920]  stupid you're a grown man like not only is he a Congress member he's a grown man
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:11.360]  upset at a little girl tweeting about him so he's kind of a soy boy if I'm
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:15.440]  being honest and Texans aren't going to reelect him so I'm not too worried about
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:20.480]  his position and power because he barely won but he lost his primary barely won
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:25.360]  when they did a runoff election so I don't think that he's gonna get
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:29.480]  reelected and if I have anything to do with that I'll take that with a badge
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:32.960]  of honor well folks to go to libertyhangout.org and find all your
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:36.200]  powerful videos they should bookmark it they should share it I watch it this
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:40.040]  weekend but for memories we can put it up on screen what's the name of your
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:45.360]  Dan Crenshaw videos so folks can find it this is Dan Crenshaw message me that's
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:48.760]  right it's on info wars.com and news wars.com Dan Crenshaw message
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:52.360]  conservative put that back up for me real quick guys I'd really appreciate
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:56.080]  that the info wars story thank you Dan Crenshaw message conservative reporter
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:00.960]  what the congressman reached out to info wars Caitlyn Bennett and again it took
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.280]  you 20 minutes to read all the messages back and forth but people really ought
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:09.200]  to go hear it because it sounds like some frat boy or something and I don't
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:13.720]  mean a cool frat guy I mean like the bad guy in the frat because he can tell
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:19.080]  he's using psychological warfare on you but it's very amateurish it's it's very
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:23.520]  very trying to ridicule you trying to make fun of you and that's why would he
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:28.840]  even spend his time doing that this is weird well what I say in what I told him
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:32.440]  and people will see that if they watch the whole 20 minute video is that the
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:37.960]  fact that he felt the need to message me shows that he's bothered enough to know
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:42.680]  that what he's doing is wrong and I feel like he's so deep into the rabbit hole of
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:46.640]  supporting red flag laws that when he gets called out he has to try to insult
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:51.920]  somebody to like maybe I guess silence them I don't know if he was trying to
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.520]  silence me or if he was just trying to make me feel bad for calling him a
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:59.680]  rhino I don't know but what he doesn't understand is I've been through so much
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:03.800]  I get ridiculed so much from the right it doesn't bother me anymore I know who I
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:08.440]  am exactly continue with you in the next hour and then we'll let you make these
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:11.840]  points to take some calls on red flag laws but listen you're an eloquent smart
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.600]  great lady we're so honored to have you working with info wars you've gone
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:17.920]  through so much deep you know deep platforming harassment and you've
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:23.560]  stood the test of time so we wish he as a baby seal big strong you know tough guy
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:28.520]  we wish he'd come here and defend that most precious of amendments the second
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:32.360]  amendment and not ridicule you for your first and side with Bernie Sanders I
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.160]  think that's the big bombshell but let me say this as we go to break and come
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:38.520]  back with you I don't know why he's called the gay pirate online it's okay
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:42.280]  if he's gay I think he's got a family and he's from Houston a multi-generational
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:45.840]  Texan that's great but you know he's known as the gay pirate he's known as
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:51.240]  the you know the gun confiscator of the anti-gun pirate but really the name that
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:56.800]  sticks with me that he's been called is McCain 2.0 he needs to come out say he's
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:02.040]  wrong come out for the second amendment McCain 2.0 we do not need Dan

[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:51.480]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our Republic was in
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:55.080]  trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:58.480]  to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:02.680]  nation and today the Communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:08.200]  ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:12.640]  he's doing in this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers that's
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:17.200]  beautiful Americans aren't gonna be bullied and we aren't gonna back down so
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:20.720]  to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want to

[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:08.640]  all right after Caitlin Bennett leaves us I promise we'll get to Rex and Adam
[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:15.320]  and Josh and Ben and Robert and Chad you can't hold I understand it's great we
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:18.720]  have 20 some phone lines social bags already took like 10 calls but I want
[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:22.240]  to continue with your calls but we've got Caitlin Bennett on us right now we've
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:25.360]  got Mr. Cargill popping in as well talk about the homeless problem and now the
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:29.920]  Democrats do about design and we've got Mark as a police officer wants to talk
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:33.360]  about red flag laws and we'll do that with Caitlin Bennett the next segment
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:36.880]  but Caitlin again I don't like attacking Dan Crenshaw we're barely keeping
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:42.680]  Texas red but what's the use of having Republicans if they act like Democrats
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:47.520]  and so a lot of people got pissed at me when I didn't attack Crenshaw a few
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:51.200]  weeks ago when he was out there you know playing kissy face with all the
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:57.000]  Democrats being praised all over CNN MSNBC because I knew Trump was
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  manipulating him I still don't like playing politics I don't like it but I
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.040]  told you Trump would shelve it I know you're still mightily angry at Trump you
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:05.800]  have that right and I think was people being mad that made you know Trump at
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:10.320]  the final equation back off even quicker but Crenshaw still out there flogging
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:15.800]  this dead horse and so that tells me he's pretty bad nose well what I didn't
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:19.560]  know before I made this video when I did some research about him and I found out
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:23.200]  all these things he actually met with mom's demand action which is a gun
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:27.800]  control group back in February and he told me I think one of the most damning
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:31.840]  things about the messages was that he told me that he's been thinking about
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:35.600]  this for years he's been thinking about red flag laws and gun control and
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:41.960]  implementing them for years so what's the use like you said you make oh my
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.560]  gosh I'm only interrupting is it so key when you read all the transcripts of
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:49.640]  you guys went back and forth like ten times or whatever he said oh I've been
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.520]  supporting this for years this is my policy but then he told everybody he
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:58.360]  wasn't for it during the campaign so he's a damn liar oh yeah I think he's
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.360]  probably a carpet bagger I don't think he's been here six generations we'll find
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:07.920]  out yeah well he was actually born I think in Sweden I think but he had
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:11.480]  born to American parents so I don't really know the whole story with that
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:17.040]  but it's just really really upsetting seeing how the Democrats are so
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:21.120]  passionate about gun control and confiscating firearms and taking them
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:25.560]  from us we need someone on the right that's just as passionate about the
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:30.320]  opposite about keeping firearms in the hands of people so I think as right
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:34.160]  wingers as conservatives as Trump supporters we have to call it out and
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:38.080]  I'm not attacking Dan Crenshaw I'm not doing that and that's why I kept it
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:43.520]  very polite in my messages I wanted to go you know my usual aggressive self and
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:48.600]  just tell him that he's ridiculous he's a soy boy he's acting like a child but I
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:53.800]  kept it cool and I was hoping to change his mind and I didn't one thing that the
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:58.480]  Democrats have is that when they get backlash for something they might
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:04.520]  apologize or just ignore it entirely he's not doing anything he is doubling
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:09.080]  down he is attacking people who he needs on his side he even said it in the
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:13.280]  messages if you go to the video and watch it and I really encourage everybody
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:17.680]  to do that's 20 minutes but seriously go and watch it he tells me he attacks me
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:22.000]  for not supporting him and he even says I reached out to a lot of influencers on
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:27.120]  social media because he knows we're mad at him we don't support this so he has to
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:31.440]  try to alienate us make us feel bad so that we change your mind so that we
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:35.720]  don't get attacked by Dan Crenshaw he's not that scared he's not that scary he
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:39.840]  doesn't scare me he doesn't intimidate me I know what I believe in and shame on
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:46.920]  him honestly for trying to attack my my personality instead of my ideas well
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:50.040]  you're right I mean I've read the big transcript it's in your video it's
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:54.000]  posted under the article people need to really see it at libertyhangout.org
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.480]  and like Matt Drudge said he was here in studio almost four years ago
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:03.480]  everybody has to build their own sites again we have to surf the web again we
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:07.720]  have to build our own internal systems our own audio our own video info wars
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:10.840]  has done that we're gonna start having more contributors that are able to access
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:14.680]  our systems to back up their videos we can't have it open to the public or
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:18.600]  they'll go post child porn or whatever to try to shut us down but we are gonna
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:23.360]  have contributors they're able to double down unlike Crenshaw for the second
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:27.640]  amendment and post audio and video to our site for people that are members
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:31.840]  we're gonna announce this soon so that people have a home where they know what
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:35.480]  they put up will not be erased or removed we're gonna take some calls on
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:39.160]  the subject with Taitlin Bennett straight ahead you gotta go watch your
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:43.280]  video it's long but she reads through it all she devastates every argument and
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:47.160]  she shows that Dan Crenshaw will show you the photos of video there to show
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:52.120]  them literally at gun control conferences I mean this guy is working for
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:57.800]  the other side of course it's not only that you have a unique voice in the
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:01.000]  public arena in the public square the other thing that's unique about info
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.040]  wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:08.760]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:12.040]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government it is completely
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:16.960]  independent of all that it is an old-school American 1776 style experiment
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:20.480]  in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:23.600]  the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:27.280]  tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:30.240]  this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:34.000]  era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.640]  daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the
[02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:41.520]  person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:45.800]  broken through that the they are the bridge from the founding to the modern
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:48.800]  age ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:52.960]  unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:06:07.560]  libel targeting you the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas
[02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:15.160]  broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones well we need every pro-second amendment
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:19.720]  congressman we've got this fight to restore the republic first amendments
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:25.000]  under attack second minutes under attack and I sat on the fence but I wasn't too
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.680]  loud about it when Trump came out and said okay I don't like mentally ill
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:32.320]  people getting guns we've got to stop them getting it maybe some of these red
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:35.960]  flag laws would be good well then he learned what was in the red flag laws
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:40.720]  now in popular it was and Trump shelved it and said we're not gonna do that he
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:44.560]  said because it wouldn't do anything all these people said they're gonna kill
[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:47.920]  people most of them get the guns illegally I've already gone over that
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:53.280]  40 plus times that the lunatic kook that shot all those people in Parkland
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:57.120]  Florida last year 40 plus times the police were called saying he's gonna
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:00.920]  kill people he'd walk around saying I'm coming to school to kill you he committed
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:04.280]  all these crimes and was let go by a liberal law they passed where you can
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:08.280]  commit all these crimes and not go to jail if you're a quota minority Cruz wasn't
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:12.800]  even Hispanic but he was adopted by Hispanics who both had died recently it's
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:18.640]  a very suspicious story the point is is that this wouldn't protect us but people
[02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:23.560]  got mad at Trump and rightfully so but he's backed off on that or the few chinks
[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:29.320]  and Trump's armor but Dan Crenshaw is still doubling down putting on all the
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:35.440]  sale he can to get that boat going as fast as he can and the last straw for me
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:40.120]  was watching Caitlyn Bennett's piece on info wars.com this weekend where he
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:44.320]  sends her a mean message she goes back and forth he tries to belittle her and
[02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:49.280]  then we learn he's hanging out with gun control groups and once no due process
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:53.520]  your guns are taken Caitlyn marks a police officer in Texas he wants to
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:56.520]  comment on this but but other points you haven't had a chance to make before I
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:08:02.080]  go to him. I would just say please watch the video share the links everything
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:05.040]  like that yeah let's go to the police officer I'm really interested to hear
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:08.800]  what he has to say. Well listen Caitlyn do this tell people your Twitter retweet
[02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:12.040]  it right after you're off in a few minutes so people can find it easier
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:15.480]  there we'll also repost it because we're not trying to hurt Crenshaw he's hurting
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:22.560]  us he's coming for the rights that our veterans going back to 1776 fought for
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:26.720]  and when he does that any good work he's ever done for this country he
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:30.640]  betrays Benedict Arnold was one of our greatest generals of course he'd been a
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:33.160]  double agent the last three years of the war because he thought the British
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:36.920]  were gonna win we almost lost the war because of him so now he's the worst of
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:41.480]  traitors and we have to stop going along with us let these rhinos know oh by the
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:44.960]  way briefly tell folks we'll go to the police officer what originally triggered
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:51.140]  him it was a photo of him with a plastic rhino. Yeah so I was in Boston in Quincy
[02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:55.480]  Market and I took a photo with a fake rhino that's decorated with you know
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:59.240]  stars of stripes and I was like look I'm with Dan Crenshaw I only got like a
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:03.240]  thousand likes but he was so bothered by it that he had to start messaging me
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:07.880]  saying oh you don't care about me you don't care about the right you you just
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:12.120]  want to alienate people and I'm like if that's what you get out of that then fine
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:18.960]  I'm trying to criticize your actions and your policies but he just but hurts. Well
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:24.480]  it shows that he's really afraid again the last straw for me will go the call
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:28.800]  is. In fact you have the transcript there but he said oh look at you at the
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:32.760]  Bernie thing oh you poor little victim you weren't a victim you went in there to
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:36.200]  cover what he was doing they threw you out the police said it was wrong it was a
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.880]  public venue it was a school auditorium and then Crenshaw is making fun of your
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:45.440]  first amendment so I mean this guy's got a real problem. I mean he has a serious
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:50.560]  problem with trying to go after people who are trying to criticize ideas. What
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:54.400]  is really funny about him mentioning me about the Bernie Sanders thing is that
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:58.680]  he's trying to say I had a victimhood mentality during that when I did it and
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:01.840]  if he would have answered my first message when I asked him to share the
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:05.440]  video he would have seen it and he would have actually talked to me about it but
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:09.400]  he's calling me a victim saying that I'm playing the victim card that video was
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:13.640]  months ago and that's what he chooses to try and come after me for so I think
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:16.720]  there's a lot of insults and belittlement that he's trying to get
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:21.160]  thrown at me and trying I think he was trying to bait me into being mean to him
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:25.280]  so maybe he was trying to demoralize you like the Chicoms are trying to do to
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.200]  America but it's not gonna work. Let's go to Mark in Texas a police officer wants
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:32.800]  to comment on red flag laws. The police officers I've talked to say it's
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:36.240]  unconstitutional plus it wouldn't have ever saved anybody with these mass
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:39.520]  shootings people are always getting warned the laws are on the books you're
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:42.680]  saying you're gonna kill somebody we can have your guns taken if it's a credible
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:46.920]  threat but what about what this will do to police turning you guys into an army
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:52.560]  of gun confiscating Gestapo that doesn't sound like a very safe profession.
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:58.560]  Well God bless them for worse. We have a Facebook page Town Hall for Crenshaw as
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:01.480]  Town Hall for Crenshaw. We are bringing them back to the district
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:06.680]  September the 7th at 9 a.m. at Crosby Church so he can come explain his tax
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:11.400]  act and red flag laws. We're not happy in the district we're volunteers we work
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:17.640]  really hard for him and we want some answers here. Well please tell us tell
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:23.720]  us how you work for him and why you're upset. Well as a matter of fact my buddy
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:28.360]  and my and myself we got a fundraiser together for him brought in a lot of
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:33.000]  money we've worked the polls we walk the neighborhood talked to people and we
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:37.680]  did a lot of good work for him and a lot of hard work for him and now we're
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:41.920]  getting slapped with this. We love our country we love our Constitution we love
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:46.320]  our second amendment and we're not going to tolerate that. I would also like to
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:52.600]  say to Taitlin that I saw the video and I appreciate your style of activism very
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:12:00.320]  much. Thank you. Continue the mission and stay strong out there. Alex has
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:08.320]  changed my life y'all rock and also before y'all let me go I have body armor
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.120]  for your reporters so you could send me back to a screener and I'll be happy to
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:15.240]  give it to y'all if you would like to have it. Well you're very nice to say
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:17.920]  that sir but I don't want to I don't want to put you through any expense I
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:20.800]  mean in fact the reporters want body armor we should probably buy it for them
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:23.400]  it's kind of got to that point but but we'll do that but you sound like a
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:27.160]  pretty level-headed smart police officer why are you against red flag laws
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:30.120]  just because they're unconstitutional plus look at all the cases there's
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:34.240]  almost never been a case where extra judicial taking guns would in almost
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:37.240]  every case these guys are telling everyone I'm gonna kill everybody I
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:42.600]  love Satan I'm gonna go kill people and then they're not being arrested. Right
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:47.320]  well we do find I find it unconstitutional and this tax act is a
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:53.800]  grant to have a local law enforcement do what the feds want. These people are
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:58.760]  our friends and neighbors I don't want to go collect their guns and I'm a
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:04.360]  police officer I'm not a psychiatrist what are they thinking? And expand on how
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:09.240]  his particular red flag law from what I've seen is one of the worst about how
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:13.920]  it federalizes you explain that because you're an expert on that. Well it is a
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:18.360]  grant and I do work in an area where there are grants. Grants are driven by
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:23.920]  stats. Want that grant money? You better produce. Very dangerous especially when
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:27.960]  you start talking about our constitutional rights. So you're saying as
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:32.760]  they're putting a bounty on gun confiscation extra judicially where
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:37.680]  just because a crazy neighbor or I mean or leftist or ever says oh I saw his
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:41.120]  guns they scare me I see that all the time in California Bloomberg reported
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:44.960]  last year that's their model if someone's uncomfortable I see the case all
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:48.600]  the time we're an old guy's cleaning guns in his garage and the neighbor
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:53.080]  thinks they're illegal and calls the SWAT team. Well Alex I've been reading the
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.400]  bill and for me the scariest part of the bill is that it's so vague it's
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:02.920]  simply creating the framework for a new entity that's going to do this but it
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:07.320]  doesn't say what they're looking for how it's going to operate it's just showing
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:11.720]  that the director of Homeland Security or Secretary of Homeland Security is
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:16.080]  going to be in charge of this. Now can you imagine if Janet Napolitano was our
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:22.240]  our director of Homeland Security again you know Islam was not our big threat
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:26.320]  those are veterans returning home so maybe if these if this past best pass
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:30.600]  under President Trump we may be okay for a while but who knows if we ever get
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:35.000]  president Warren or president Sanders where's this beast gonna go. You're
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.420]  absolutely right and I'll say this I will not support President Trump if he
[02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:43.320]  actually gets behind any of these bills I mean if he says oh we need to have
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:46.960]  stronger enforcement of the background check or something like that where all
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:50.320]  the time the people have been in mental institutions like the Texas shooter at
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:53.600]  the church last year he'd been in a mental institution he'd been adjudicated
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:58.800]  not be able to own guns had a disorderly discharge or a bad discharge from the
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:02.520]  military dishonorables the word and he shouldn't have been able to own guns and
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:07.200]  and that the Pentagon the Air Force never put his name in the database so if
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:11.040]  Trump had some funding to have a better database or something to stop mentally
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:15.520]  ill people that'd be fine with me but not psychiatrists psychologists just
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:19.360]  random people wave a magic wand they're the same one saying Trump's crazy
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:25.120]  God bless you Mark great points. Caitlin we're out of time thank you so much

[02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:59.480]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people but I've decided
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:02.440]  that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:05.960]  six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:08.960]  of it I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:12.160]  and why they were and I'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:15.480]  good and instead the last few years I'm like hey we need to really support us
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:18.200]  or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:20.600]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the left
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:25.080]  always has headlines everywhere. Jones sells unapproved supplements that he
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:30.360]  claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:33.520]  supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction it
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:36.720]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:40.120]  and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:43.240]  manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:46.800]  side effects not with mother nature but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing

[02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:29.120]  stay on hold callers I love you to death. I'll get to you in the segment after
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:33.480]  that in the segment after that. Tomorrow in the fourth hour we're going to have
[02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:39.040]  reporters who were embedded with the Hong Kong resistance who just got back they
[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:43.520]  are going to be hosting the fourth hour Savannah Hernandez and of course Greg
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:47.880]  Reese and others so look for that tomorrow in the fourth hour a lot of
[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:52.240]  other surprise guests and things that are coming up here throughout the week.
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:57.880]  Now Michael Cargill is a veteran he's a entrepreneur he's got a very successful
[02:20:57.880 --> 02:21:04.040]  gun shop and firearms training Institute and he's who I got my concealed
[02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:07.800]  carry-through as well and he's a frequent guest I mean he's probably in
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:11.120]  the last seven eight years been in here a hundred times he's always welcome he
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:14.440]  just tells us when he wants to come on he comes on but I called him today and he
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:18.880]  came right over not just because he keeps exposing the homeless crisis that
[02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:22.120]  the mayor admits they're making worse to quote get more funding which then brings
[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:25.640]  more homeless which then gets more funding literal heroin heads everywhere
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:29.480]  crapping all over the street he video taped it so I'll tell you when to turn
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:33.240]  away that's coming up next segment but I wanted to get him on about the red flag
[02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:38.640]  laws and a focus on how dangerous they are and how bad they are what Trump was
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:42.480]  being told is it's just more funding for people that we know are mentally ill to
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:45.000]  be able to take guns when they're threatened to kill people well Trump's
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.560]  like we already have that on the books that's why he said and shelved it last
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:52.840]  week still it's frightening he would look at that I agree but but but Dan
[02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:57.640]  Crenshaw he's been pushing the worst forms of it and won't stop so I'm
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:02.320]  really upset to learn that we've got a Democrat in Republican clothing I don't
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:06.040]  want to go off on a jag against him but what is your take on the red flag fiasco
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:09.600]  we you know Alex we already have laws on the books right now you know and you
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:14.200]  really can't legislate crazy you know so we can't create new laws that are going
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:18.640]  to you know stop someone from doing something really want to do this guy you
[02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:23.920]  know that we're talking about drove from what Dallas Texas to El Paso you know
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:28.800]  10 hours to actually kill random people so you have someone that's dead set on
[02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:32.080]  doing something like this there's there no new laws that we can come up with what
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:36.160]  you can do is say hey you know if you the mother the father who was a
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:39.240]  counselor noticed something was wrong with their son they should have got him
[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:44.120]  some help you know but it's not up up to us you know to actually do something
[02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:47.120]  about that before you move your microphone a little bit cut now sure you're
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:50.800]  making great points well look at Ohio the guy was a devil worshipping Antifa and
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:54.960]  the guy in Texas was an Antifa they just erased his pages and put up that he was a
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:58.360]  right winger I'm really worried that Antifa is staging these events to get
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:04.040]  our guns I mean the guy in Ohio admitted it yeah and very dangerous people what
[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:07.360]  we need to do is I suggest everyone you know you go out there you train up you
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:11.280]  arm yourself you get yourself prepared and get yourself ready because there
[02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:15.080]  are people that are dead set and Tifa wherever they are dead set on committing
[02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:18.960]  just carnage around this nation and it's really up to us to make sure that
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:21.400]  we're prepared to handle that we could take care of our families we can take
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:25.760]  care of ourselves and that we stay trained and stay armed Michael Cargill of
[02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:30.320]  central texasgunworks.com a veteran an entrepreneur and a person teaching the
[02:23:30.320 --> 02:23:34.280]  Second Amendment you know the left tries to indoctrinate our children the way to
[02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:38.800]  defend the Second Amendment I believe is to exercise it properly inform others
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:42.480]  and train others and really bring them out of the slavery of not being able to
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:46.080]  defend yourself absolutely you know it and I try to do that for my you know my
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:49.640]  students I try to release the change from their risk and from their ankles and
[02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:52.720]  free them and say hey you know here's the knowledge here's the power go out
[02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:57.400]  there and do great things and and be great citizens of this country let's
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:24:00.920]  talk about friendship because everybody was calling me including a lot of
[02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:03.200]  military people that I'm friends with saying go after friendship after
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:08.720]  Crenshaw and I wasn't really paying attention then I saw that he's been
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:11.200]  supporting all sorts of stuff and I don't want to make him a target
[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:17.240]  politically I just want him to get back with you know the law and and find
[02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:23.040]  Jesus basically yeah you know then Crenshaw he's gone off the path right
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:27.200]  now I don't know what's going on with him you know where he's getting off on
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:31.520]  you know talking about red flag laws and and all this this little tangent that
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:35.280]  he's on but he needs to remember his base remember that the people that sent
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:41.040]  him to DC send him there for a reason and that is you know Texans want to be
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:45.840]  we love our firearms we love our second amendment we love you know praising the
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:50.440]  Lord and past the ammunition we do not need a US congressman telling us you
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:53.640]  know that you're gonna walk into our homes and take our guns because that's
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:56.840]  not gonna happen here in Texas that's not gonna stand in the United States
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:00.960]  we're just not gonna put up for any of that stuff and it's because people know
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:04.360]  guns they know their rights and they're dug in if we knew all our other rights
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:07.520]  and we're dug in the system would never be able to take our other rights
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:10.840]  absolutely and it's important that you you know educate yourself on all the
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:14.320]  different laws they understand our Constitution understand how we got to
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:18.440]  where we are today learn history and all that stuff works and Alex you know all
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:21.800]  this stuff you know because like in Austin we're talking about like the
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:26.840]  homeless and all that stuff I mean they literally someone it started way back in
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:31.080]  like the 50s where they went into the asylums and actually shut them down and
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:34.760]  now we have people that are just living amongst us that are just you know crazy
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:39.440]  and just losing it I think that's about half of it and the rest is they'll give
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:43.680]  them a city check and a federal check and come out with vans and cater to them
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:46.840]  a couple times a week giving them free goodies they put it all into heroin all
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:50.360]  into meth all into alcohol and all around my office all around your office
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:53.840]  these be nice areas they're just people lounging around an easy chair shooting
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:57.280]  heroin up you'll drive by they're just crapping right in the street in front of
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:01.480]  you your kids are like daddy what's that and they're just like monstrous you
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:05.960]  mean gross drug addicts and and and I don't want to come off as someone that's
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:09.480]  you know being heartless and and picking on the homeless you know but
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:13.560]  we're talking lawlessness you know it's it yeah the person has a right to you
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:17.880]  should have a right to live you know and and not be responsible person if you
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:22.120]  don't want to but take care of yourself that that's all fine I mean I mean like
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:25.800]  you said half of a mentally ill but but the rest are just absolutely out of
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:29.680]  control drug addicts lawlessness just complete lawlessness and we're just it's
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:33.000]  gonna have to take some tough love because we have people that are you know
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:37.240]  being sent here from other states they bust them here yes from other cities and
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:39.640]  they're saying hey you know what we don't want them and the mayor knows that I'm
[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:43.200]  sure did you hear the mayor when he was on the Calvary jail about a month ago
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:46.640]  and he said I'm making the law where they can camp in your front yard that's
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:50.600]  the law except for the city council I'm not joking about hypocrisy so that we
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:53.480]  get more money and fix the problem that's just gonna bring more of them
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:57.400]  here absolutely there and they're coming yeah we're seeing this every single
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:01.160]  day you go down to the bus station they're rolling in and no one's doing
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:05.200]  anything we've got to reverse what the city of Austin has done because as goes
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:10.240]  the city of Austin will every other city in this state and every other city and
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:14.760]  state in this nation and again folks they can on the sidewalk in front of your
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:18.600]  house because before the cops would stop them in neighborhoods well now they
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:21.760]  want to be in your neighborhood folks when we come back we'll show the video
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:25.640]  this is your nice facility they're out there we're gonna show the video yet
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:29.960]  describe what you just catch on a daily basis that's it's sad this is you know I
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:33.440]  have you know customers coming in customers leaving and they're you know
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:36.840]  witnessing this stuff and it's just really sad it's something that we really
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:40.360]  shouldn't have to put up with but this is where we are you know this is the the
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:44.440]  place that we made this is the state of Texas that we're you're turning into we

[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:33.360]  we've got the myco zx that goes in and knocks out the candida the mold the
[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:36.640]  yeast and the gut normal probiotics are great
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:39.360]  they're good bacteria that displace the bad ones that's only part of the
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:42.800]  equation they've got the mold the yeast and all the rest of it that's so bad
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:46.160]  nowadays that knocks it out then you add something
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:50.080]  like the carnivore that's got this really powerful
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:53.680]  enzyme in it that helps dissolve the protein and the fat in your stomach in
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:57.200]  your guts and it is the trifecta together it's a great product there's
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:01.680]  17 plus dollars of product in the carnivore bottle
[02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:04.960]  so this is almost a loss leader with 50 off dna force plus
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:09.200]  in fact they may have just said 25 off this because maybe it loses money
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:12.320]  because i mean i i told them what to do a couple days ago and last night in the
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:15.840]  meetings about our new pitch and i saw this maybe we'll keep it at that i don't
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:17.520]  know maybe maybe it's losing money because this
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:20.640]  costs us like almost eight dollars for the carnivore 30 this
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:24.800]  costs us 17 80 something for the carnivore 90
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:28.080]  this is a great product and i want you to see how amazing it is so i'm giving you
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:32.400]  a free bottle of it because of all the probiotic type stuff out there
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:35.760]  this isn't just the best it's an area that most people
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:39.760]  don't supplement in and it's one of the most dramatic so take advantage
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:44.240]  of those huge sales at m4store.com for a very limited time
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:48.640]  because we only have a couple thousand bottles of each to be part of this sale
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:52.240]  we've got to keep the rest back because a lot of this isn't coming in for 10 weeks
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:54.960]  done talking about that now we're going to just roll this video in the
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:58.080]  background while you speak about it it's gross so a lot of folks won't want to
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:01.440]  watch it but we're documenting what's going on for radio listeners
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:05.280]  subscribe just just just daily a couple years ago i bought a
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:07.840]  lot of guns at your place or you know been over there taking
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:11.200]  classes from you never saw homeless now whether you're in north austin whether
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:14.480]  you're in west lake whether you're in south austin
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:17.760]  nice areas bad areas they're just homeless encampments everywhere
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:23.600]  encroaching now even at the businesses yeah and and i'm not trying to you know
[02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:26.880]  talk bad about the homeless itself i'm you know really you know focus on the
[02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:30.240]  lawlessness that we're seeing here and you're absolutely correct you know
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:33.760]  uh we're we're seeing this everywhere and it was not like this over a year ago
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:38.080]  you know but now it's it's just terrible we have
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:42.160]  you know i walk outside my door and literally i'm standing here i'm looking
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:45.760]  at this guy this guy is he's
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:51.280]  he's doing the number two and he's shooting up at the same time
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:54.880]  literally right by my front door where my customers are coming in and going out
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:59.840]  and this is a very busy area we have uh there's a transit station a bus station
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:03.280]  right next door to us there's the you know we have people that are
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:06.480]  going in to get acupuncture done we have people going in to get physical
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:09.200]  therapy a lot of stuff is going on it's a very
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:12.880]  heavy traffic area there's a restaurant yeah a restaurant there
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:16.800]  as well and that's what you see when you're walking across the parking lot
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:20.240]  you see someone who's defecating and shooting up
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:23.680]  all at the same time right in front of your face in broad
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:27.440]  daylight and let's be clear that summer mentally ill we should take care of them
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:30.800]  you know the churches the system used to do that there's a lot more mental
[02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:33.280]  illness now though because of all the corruption in drugs that's causing
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:36.000]  mental illness weaponized marijuana is causing massive
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.400]  schizophrenia increases but a lot of them are just
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:44.480]  piratical rude like the drag rats are a gang of mainly white kids that have
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:47.040]  around at least 20 years that beat up and rob people
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:50.000]  down on the ut drag and the police aren't able to do anything about it
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:53.200]  so so all these are violent gangs as well you know what's funny about it is
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:56.800]  the university of texas pushing back you have the ut police chief just
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:00.080]  released a statement today he's saying hey you know something needs to be done
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:02.800]  this is actually pretty funny because you have the progressives
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:06.400]  democrats that are pushing against the correct progressive democrats
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:09.760]  you know that's incredible yeah the university of texas they're saying hey
[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:13.040]  it's too much for them and they're the ones that say you know bring us your
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:15.920]  poor bring us everything you know we can handle it we're very
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:19.840]  we're the progressive liberals here and it's too much for the university of
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:22.800]  texas well it even made the newspapers you know we put
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:26.640]  it up on screen earlier when the mayor went on local talk radio and said
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:31.120]  i did this to show you the homeless problem so that we get more funding but
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:33.200]  he's inviting him here from all over the country
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:36.560]  the end game is the city services all this the city gets money
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:40.880]  to take care of the homeless and then city council members family members and
[02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:43.760]  folks run the groups that skim money off the top
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:46.960]  the drug dealer selling the drugs i mean they know exactly what they're doing
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:51.280]  yeah you you have ladies that are being raped on on the weekly basis in this
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:54.160]  town sexual assault is happening in our
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:58.240]  crimes exploding yes in our parks and and they're just you know
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:01.040]  encampments are growing in the parks and that's the place that it wasn't
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:04.080]  supposed to be he said you're not going to be able to do this
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:06.960]  on at city hall property you're not going to be able to do this
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:10.320]  also in the parks but that's not what's happening we're seeing this happening
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:13.760]  right now law enforcement is not doing anything about it and
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:16.640]  you have kids that are scared you have the little girls little boys that are
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:21.360]  scared to go to school to walk to school it's just not safe for them anymore
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:24.640]  well i went to seattle last year early last year
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:28.480]  and we were standing at a four-star hotel
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:32.480]  not a nice area town there were crack pipes and needles right outside when
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:37.040]  you walked out with my children and then when i would try to go places
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:39.280]  there was feces all over the place and homeless
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:43.600]  encampments everywhere and they're on heroin that the chikoms are shipping in
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:46.880]  and that's really what it is is an heroin epidemic
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:50.880]  and it's i don't even know what to say to that that's just that's sad you know
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:55.040]  because you're talking needles you have to bypass my goodness that is not
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:57.520]  something that's supposed to happen and we've got democrats
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:01.760]  leaving california and origan and places to come here but
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:06.080]  they bring their culture with them yes yes exactly and
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:09.360]  we don't want that in texas this is texas the lone star state we don't want
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:13.280]  that you know don't we don't want to be alone poop state
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:17.600]  why do you think every blue city is infested with rats feces and needles
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:20.720]  and getting worse it's the leadership the leadership that uh people are
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:24.560]  voting into those cities you have is happening in dallas in el paso san
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:28.320]  antonio uh that leadership has allowed this type of behavior to happen and
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:31.520]  let's be clear almost every city in texas is blue now
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:35.920]  yeah almost every major city your large cities
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:39.200]  except your you know out in west texas east texas your smaller towns
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:42.320]  they're remaining red and strong and they don't have these issues and once the
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:45.520]  democrats get control of a city you never go
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:49.280]  red again because they engage in election fraud absolutely they take charge and
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:52.880]  then and we've lost it forever you know they're very close by the next
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:56.880]  election a lot after that winning texas and all these good old boys won't go out
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:58.640]  and warn people won't rally them to vote
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:03.680]  that'll never happen texas california was as right wing as we were 30 years ago
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:07.360]  you need to wake up and wake up now to smell the coffee because if you don't
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:09.600]  you know we're going to lose you're going to lose the second amendment you're
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:13.040]  going to have red flag laws in the state of texas you know and i never thought
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:17.200]  in a million years i would be talking about uh having a red flag law talking
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:20.720]  about universal background checks but that's all you're hearing now i'm
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:24.000]  hearing this coming from the governor's office i'm hearing this coming from
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:27.440]  uh some of our you know so-called republican
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:31.600]  elected officials that that are in dc and they're saying hey we need to you
[02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:34.640]  know let's do universal background checks i'm like what are you what are you
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:38.000]  talking about universal background checks for uh and i want people to
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:41.200]  understand what does that really mean when you say universal background
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:45.040]  checks you're saying that let's say you did something 20 30 years ago
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:48.800]  and you've been an outstanding citizen you paid your debt to society
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:52.480]  that means that you're never going to be forgiven for that crime
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:56.960]  why send someone to jail why make them pay for that debt to society
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:41:59.840]  if they're not going to get their rights back i was about to say it's worse
[02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:04.640]  than that um the the democrats are saying just
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:07.840]  extra judicially if somebody thinks you're scary you'd even make a threat
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:11.520]  you lose your guns and then it gets even worse than that
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:16.160]  uh they're talking about these red flag laws uh well take the universal
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:18.800]  background or the or the or the gun show loophole
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:22.480]  that means that a father can't give his son a shotgun
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.400]  that is correct that's correct you can't pass it down to your father the son
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:30.160]  or you know to an uncle or a brother or anything like that you're gonna have to
[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:33.520]  walk into a gun store and do a background check first just to give

[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:02.160]  so far this year and i feel like i'm stealing from you
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:04.880]  i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want to get that money to
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:07.440]  walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:10.560]  causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:14.240]  quality products the products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:17.840]  x2 has really done a lot for me i've lost weight my brain works a whole lot
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:21.440]  better i think my kids they use the toothpaste my son used to get these
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:24.960]  little sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:28.000]  his sore throat well let me break this down for you i want
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.440]  high quality stuff in there i want a good price but i've kind of obituated
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:35.280]  everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off i'm making two dollars on
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:38.320]  the toothpaste 50% off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:41.680]  or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen
[02:46:41.680 --> 02:46:45.360]  when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss later
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:48.800]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship then we're
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:51.520]  doing 50% off and then you do something like that
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:56.240]  we have patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:02.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:34.800]  i want to write to your phone calls with the troopers that have been holding
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:38.960]  since last hour's topic that's so critical
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:43.200]  communist china is down control of apple it's control of the iphone's all the
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:46.320]  devices have been given the code keys publicly uh
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:50.480]  Huawei is admittedly spying on us trump said no they're holding hong kong
[02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:54.160]  hostage threatening to invade declare martial law they've infiltrated the
[02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:57.280]  colleges the government that they have backdoors and the chips
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:01.920]  and the media is siding with china the washington post is siding with china
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:06.320]  this is a big deal what do you think about that let's see who's been holding
[02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:10.640]  the longest here chad in washington thank you so much for holding
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:13.840]  i'm gonna go to josh adam and others go ahead chad
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:18.160]  yeah a couple points a lot of me here uh first uh what i just want to ask you
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:21.360]  what do you think of uh you know the fox con factory
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:24.720]  uh that's about to open here in the u.s i i remember you years ago i was talking
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:26.960]  about those factories and the suicide net and
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:31.200]  kind of sounds like returning to china slowly and then i would like to make us
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:34.320]  another point about the second amendment and
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:39.440]  donald trump and crincia uh you know everyone is in lockstep right now for
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:42.560]  gun control there's not really a politician out there
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:46.720]  against gun control particularly when we're talking red flag laws
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:49.840]  and remember crincia isn't just talking to rhetoric
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:53.760]  he's a co-author of the taps act he helped write that
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:56.640]  and uh this is what they're going to be pushing when they go back in the
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:48:59.600]  session in september uh congress that is
[02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:03.360]  and uh i think when it comes to the second amendment trump is a complete
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:07.360]  failure he's done more damage than obama that's now history now
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:11.520]  uh and uh sadly truth is stranger than fiction that's really all i'm out with
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:15.120]  it and i don't think i'm voting at all in 2020
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:18.240]  you know i hear you trumps big failing is that he's never been a gun guy his
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:22.080]  sons told him he's wrong nobody used the bump stocks they're pieces of junk so
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:25.840]  they're like oh let him do that but it creates the idea that taking guns
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:29.360]  means we're going to be safer when that's a a fraud
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:32.880]  and it's one of trump's biggest failings he's doing a good job and a lot of
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:35.840]  other things i'm glad it's not hillary but but you're absolutely right
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:40.080]  why should we try to appease the violence policy center and million moms for
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:43.120]  gun confiscation why did crincia like you say
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:47.440]  co-author of the really draconian bill that they support
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:51.120]  you're right and then separately we have regulations and things for
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:56.560]  safer factories in china foxconn is coming here under pressure from trump
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:00.000]  but they're only giving us one out of i forget how they got a whole bunch of
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.880]  factories something like a hundred or something in china and so they're only
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:06.720]  bringing one to wisconsin uh and so i don't see
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:10.400]  that as us becoming china i see that as the pressure to bring a lot of jobs
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:13.920]  back to the us but you bring up really really good points thank you for the call
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:18.560]  you know again listeners have been really angry about the uh red flag stuff
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:22.000]  and i told you if they pass it or try to pass it i'll get really mad
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:25.840]  i've been told by nr a board members not one but two that have met with trump
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:30.560]  that he said watch i'll tell him because it's all emotional
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:34.000]  that okay we'll do something and then they'll ask for everything and won't get
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:37.360]  it but i just don't think you should play politics like that
[02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:40.720]  and i was right he took he took it down from pressure i mean maybe you're
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:43.360]  right maybe the pressure made trump pull it maybe he really wants to take our
[02:50:43.360 --> 02:50:47.040]  guns that's just insane
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:50.480]  and people are not gonna accept it the first amendment the second amendment
[02:50:50.480 --> 02:50:53.680]  are more important than trump and remember he wrote in
[02:50:53.680 --> 02:50:58.240]  he surfed in on a wave of nationalism and populism
[02:50:58.240 --> 02:51:02.960]  okay let's go ahead and go choose who's the holding longest now
[02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:08.080]  that would be ben in canada ben you're on the air welcome
[02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:12.560]  how's it going today good brother a couple things i want to talk to you
[02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:15.920]  about i want to give you a canadian perspective
[02:51:15.920 --> 02:51:20.000]  of the stuff you're talking about everything you talk about is happening
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:24.160]  in canada as far as the guns being taken away
[02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:29.760]  the drug problem if you've ever seen hasty street in vancouver bc terrible
[02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:33.600]  one of the worst streets in north america
[02:51:34.240 --> 02:51:38.320]  and on the topic of trump as far as alberta goes
[02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:46.720]  canada has done a survey on trump and alberta leads canada in trump's support
[02:51:46.720 --> 02:51:50.960]  they just want to let you know that and um first china goes
[02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:57.440]  um i support trump myself on the china situation however
[02:51:57.440 --> 02:52:02.800]  truto um we've dealt with china quite a bit in our trade and as you know where
[02:52:02.800 --> 02:52:08.400]  your your farming community uh is uh suffering slowly because of china cutting
[02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:11.600]  your farming off and they're doing the same thing in canada
[02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:14.720]  but the first oh you're right we're in a war brother so people are gonna get hurt
[02:52:14.720 --> 02:52:18.640]  go ahead oh we're we're in a war we're in a war
[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:23.600]  and um as far as uh as far as canada goes
[02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:27.600]  the first chance truto gets to start dealing with china again regardless of
[02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:30.640]  what trump does and let me say again i support trump more than
[02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:35.360]  any truto which is sad but um i'm not that i hate trump i just
[02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:39.120]  i hate truto but uh the first chance truto
[02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:45.680]  gets to deal with china again he will just for his own um you know political
[02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:49.760]  gains you know just so he can stay in power he doesn't really give a crap
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:53.040]  um i think that's an understatement on trudeau ben you're
[02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:56.000]  awesome thanks for holding and thanks for calling for the beautiful country of
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:00.080]  canada okay let's go ahead and go next to california

[02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:09.280]  alex this is adam with no more news dot org i've been one of your biggest fans
[02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:13.280]  for 10 years and perfect topic today to talk about treason
[02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:16.960]  in china because ever since the rise of trump i really
[02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:21.840]  studied it deep and realized that all the accusations and rumors about you
[02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:25.360]  being a zionist apologist propagandists are all
[02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:30.720]  right and trump is a completely a zionist agent owned by adelson apac
[02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:35.360]  zo a bailed out by the ross child in the early 90s for billions of dollars
[02:53:35.360 --> 02:53:38.480]  with wilbur ross who's now our commerce secretary
[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:44.480]  he got the top zionist award in 1983 from the jnf the jewish national fund
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:48.640]  founded by theodore herzolt he's totally controlled by net and yahu and
[02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:52.160]  kushner trump donates to kushner who is habad he
[02:53:52.160 --> 02:53:56.240]  donates to habad they consider christianity idolatry
[02:53:56.240 --> 02:54:00.720]  that's who that's who trump supports and you blaming everything on china
[02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:04.080]  deflecting from who really is controlling and
[02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:08.160]  conquered this country is treason george washington would
[02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:12.080]  accuse you of being a traitor and you should be ashamed of yourself
[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:17.600]  for covering up for who really can okay can i can i talk now adam
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:21.120]  uh i barely think about israel
[02:54:21.120 --> 02:54:24.720]  and i've seen the mental illness of people out there that say that i work
[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:27.760]  for israel or i get talking points from israel
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:31.840]  uh israel is again a diverse group of people different parties just like the
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:34.800]  us just like russia i've been accused of working for
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:39.040]  putin i've been accused of worship for the vatican israel
[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:42.240]  i'm an american i'm a texan that believes the bill of rights and constitution
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:46.800]  i'm trying to create a big tent to bring everybody around americana
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:49.760]  and stop all the racial and cultural division
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:53.280]  that the left is using and i've seen the the extreme left
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:57.280]  like the four horsemen uh you know talib and
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:02.640]  uh aoc and you know all those folks uh peanut head from samalia whatever name
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:07.200]  is all that literally constantly saying the
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:09.760]  same thing that israel needs to be overthrown that
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:13.840]  israel runs america and so what you're saying is
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:18.720]  i'm the bad guy and aoc and talib and omar
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:23.600]  and other folks and presley they're the good guys that's what you're saying
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:26.960]  people have been saying this about dying isn't about stop it stop it for a
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:30.400]  minute i answer my question okay because i support
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:33.760]  the bill of rights the constitution the second amendment i want to protect the
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:37.920]  unborn i'm a christian and i have experienced the
[02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:43.280]  lies and the fetish the fetish that the people that obsess on israel
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:46.480]  uh people obsess on masons and all this stuff
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:52.000]  it's crazy i'm trying to create unity around the bill of
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:55.520]  rights and constitution and making our sovereignty great and believing on our
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:58.960]  country again and and i mean china does own
[02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:02.800]  their our debt the biggest part of it china has bought up the big production
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:06.560]  companies chicon propagandas everywhere the washington post is saying we hope
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:09.360]  g crushes trump i mean that happened at davos they
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:13.120]  said g will crush trump i mean these are real things i mean you're
[02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:17.760]  telling me that the chai comes that the cfr doesn't
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:21.040]  say that the chinese century is here and that america's done
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:23.840]  and the economist owned by the roth child's you won't talk about jews all
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:28.560]  day i mean do you understand like the the roth child's
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:33.120]  tried to unseat netanyahu you understand that that that the jury
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:36.800]  worldwide is not one block i mean you've actually read real history books right
[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:42.400]  not just nazi books see you're talking about red flag laws and you say anybody
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:46.560]  that criticizes israel is mentally ill and you call them well uh well that's
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:49.600]  not a hold on that's not a real i don't believe
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:52.560]  if someone says they think you're mentally ill that you should have your
[02:56:52.560 --> 02:56:57.280]  guns taken now now that is that is a ad hominem attack
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:00.880]  uh that is twisted that is a fraud you know now
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:03.680]  i do not believe anybody should have their guns taken unless they're saying
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:06.080]  i'm gonna go kill these innocent people then that's a
[02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:08.800]  terrorist threat they should be arrested taken in for mental
[02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:13.600]  evaluation i'm saying people that fetishize the vatican
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:16.320]  running everything people that fetishize jews running everything people that
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:20.400]  fetishize this or that group running everything uh i'm gonna hold you over
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:22.720]  so you can finish up and i gotta be fair to
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:26.640]  justin and josh and and rex because we got mike adams coming up
[02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:30.400]  this is divide and conquer if you've got apax supporting
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:34.480]  uncontroll i've come out against apac when some of the people supported it
[02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:37.840]  i go off issues here do i not like some of the israel lobby
[02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:41.280]  manipulate the u.s. absolute i don't want the chinese lobby either but you
[02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:44.720]  think the chinese aren't powerful spearcraft
[02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:48.960]  what you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:56.400]  in the western world history this is a digital a i enforced gag order
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:05.680]  not to say the name alex jones are in full wars dot com
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:09.760]  this is not see germany level this is racketeering this is cartels

[03:00:04.640 --> 03:00:08.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:08.240 --> 03:00:12.880]  all right i'm gonna jam in a few final calls here and my cat is just taking over
[03:00:12.880 --> 03:00:17.280]  but sometimes i go into youtube and i type in alex jones
[03:00:17.280 --> 03:00:20.560]  just to see what videos they're allowing on is it's only the negative
[03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:23.760]  predominantly and i'm not allowed to respond to attacks
[03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:27.360]  and a couple times i've seen i think this is the same guy
[03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:30.800]  video and i saw one just like a week ago or something
[03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:35.120]  and it was like five minutes long off a 20 minute rant i did all edited
[03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:38.880]  selectively show that it would make it you know
[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:42.880]  sound like i was just purely supporting israel and that's called being
[03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:47.040]  deceptive and intellectually dishonest and i watched it i didn't feel bad i'm
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:50.400]  glad even the negativity will bring people to the show
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:53.520]  to find the truth of what's really being covered here
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:57.200]  but that type of intellectual midgetry uh is not good
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:01.680]  and then i had the producer go oh yeah this guy's been on with oan to debate
[03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:06.480]  him so so we have let this guy on the
[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:10.080]  shows before and he can't even like a normal person
[03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:13.840]  to have a debate we're all guilty of treason and you know we're
[03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:17.920]  getting orders from the zionist nobody gives me orders
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:20.800]  and so you know you have to pick is it the russians is it the jews is it the
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:23.760]  vatican is it the you know masonic clubs blah blah blah
[03:01:23.760 --> 03:01:27.200]  jones admits he's an intelligence agent because he admits he's talked to people
[03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:31.360]  in government i know more than the generals that call me up
[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:35.120]  i mean it's it's a it's a mental midgetry
[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:39.280]  i'm the maverick i'm the original i call the shots
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:46.080]  i set this up i believe in freedom i'm not like other men who only follow the
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:48.640]  directives of others or other people's ideologies
[03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:52.080]  i've rebooted americana two point i'm not bragging
[03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:59.760]  i am me see here here i am and and and so so if you watch c span
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:04.720]  when you watch senator blumenthal whose law firm is trying to destroy me
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:08.960]  in just hellish things you can't imagine and the and the adl coming after
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:12.240]  me none of that means anything to the mental midgets
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:15.200]  because they don't know the southern prairie law center and others run them
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:18.160]  and run their ideology to keep the division going they don't know that
[03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:21.760]  israel's bomb jewish enclaves to make jews then go to israel
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:25.200]  under corrupt regimes in israel they don't know i've made films on that it
[03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:29.280]  isn't about real mental understanding it's about this the thought of
[03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:33.680]  superiority where everyone else is a shill of some group but you
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:37.360]  you're the truthful one you're the pure one you're the one that knows
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:40.960]  you're the trailblazer you're the maverick that's why you can spew attacks on
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:45.440]  me all day all day long with all these other
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:49.360]  thousands of groups and it's monetized and pushed on everyone
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:53.920]  but i can't be heard because i'm the real one that's really cares about black
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:57.520]  babies and white babies and hispanic babies and christian babies
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:03:02.160]  and jewish babies and muslim babies i care about humanity i want a pro human
[03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:05.520]  future and while you're obsessing all day on jews
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:10.960]  the globalists are eugenicists planning a post-human world
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:14.160]  that's what's really happening while we're divided and conquered now i got to
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:18.160]  go to break and i'll take josh justin and rex's calls and i got to move
[03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:21.520]  quick as mike adams is loaded for bear but you've got a minute and 20 seconds
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:26.160]  to finish up go ahead uh israel and bb are selling us out to china with a
[03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:28.960]  belt and road initiative and if you care about american
[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:32.480]  you're a patriot you will cover the tech transfer net and yahoo

[03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:56.640]  barbara barnes what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have
[03:04:56.640 --> 03:04:59.360]  become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no
[03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:02.560]  consequence of social economic political or legal for their illicit
[03:05:02.560 --> 03:05:05.840]  activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[03:05:05.840 --> 03:05:08.480]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press
[03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:11.040]  that care about this the ordinary members of the public and the audience
[03:05:11.040 --> 03:05:14.960]  that care about this have to bring real social political economic consequence
[03:05:14.960 --> 03:05:17.680]  to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will
[03:05:17.680 --> 03:05:20.640]  become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the
[03:05:20.640 --> 03:05:24.320]  19th century who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into
[03:05:24.320 --> 03:05:27.200]  the ground until we were able to recover after the great depression the
[03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:30.000]  informer's audience is the fuel that flames the
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:34.080]  the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent
[03:05:34.080 --> 03:05:37.760]  free speech to make real the original promise of an independent free press
[03:05:37.760 --> 03:05:41.360]  real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each
[03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:44.720]  other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then
[03:05:44.720 --> 03:05:48.000]  the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:51.040]  form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw
[03:05:51.040 --> 03:06:01.360]  even it is what what you just saw
[03:06:01.360 --> 03:06:04.560]  welcome back my gathams have taken over here just a few minutes
[03:06:04.560 --> 03:06:08.640]  naturalnews.com i'm ellis jones of news wars.com and info wars.com
[03:06:08.640 --> 03:06:12.400]  take a few of your calls right now we just joined us there was a caller
[03:06:12.400 --> 03:06:17.920]  who has a youtube channel and he was he was saying that i'm engaged in treason
[03:06:17.920 --> 03:06:22.080]  with the jews for saying that china is our big adversary
[03:06:22.080 --> 03:06:26.000]  but then he said no the jews run china and then he listed
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.800]  jewish companies that have been involved in china yeah israel's stolen
[03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:32.320]  weapons secrets you name it a bunch of countries have it it's wrong
[03:06:32.320 --> 03:06:35.360]  our governments are corrupt whether it's israel the us you name it
[03:06:35.360 --> 03:06:40.400]  we're trying to fix it but his claim that trump is working with china
[03:06:40.400 --> 03:06:45.360]  to screw us over for the jews trump has broken china's ribs
[03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:48.160]  trump is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[03:06:48.160 --> 03:06:55.360]  billions of dollars of tariffs a year he's stopping it on so
[03:06:55.440 --> 03:06:59.360]  the jews sold us out to china through trump and now
[03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:05.200]  trumps who just got in office is taking a baseball back to china's teeth
[03:07:05.200 --> 03:07:08.800]  it's just you heard him floundering around it was very very sad
[03:07:08.800 --> 03:07:14.240]  and again i'm not interested in obsessing on jews i don't worship jews
[03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:18.640]  like adam does i love god and i love freedom and i love
[03:07:18.640 --> 03:07:21.760]  humanity and i want to build a human world for us all based on
[03:07:21.760 --> 03:07:25.920]  ideas like martin Luther king said that unify us around
[03:07:25.920 --> 03:07:31.440]  a tenant of ideas being good being honorable building good society not
[03:07:31.440 --> 03:07:35.120]  killing the unborn not dehumanizing ourselves uh knowing we have a connection
[03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:38.720]  to god and the left's creating racial and cultural
[03:07:38.720 --> 03:07:44.080]  division and then ruling over this with it i reject the left i reject all the
[03:07:44.080 --> 03:07:47.440]  things they're doing i reject all their
[03:07:47.440 --> 03:07:53.920]  bigotry and that's what i'm doing now is there a consortium of very vicious
[03:07:53.920 --> 03:07:58.640]  people in congress and rich and powerful uh coming after me absolutely
[03:07:58.640 --> 03:08:03.600]  and they're mad that i'm unifying people and uh that's just the way it is so
[03:08:03.600 --> 03:08:07.600]  it's going to continue to happen now this is a powerful video we've had it up
[03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:10.880]  for an hour i should have gotten to an hour ago but that's some great guests on
[03:08:10.880 --> 03:08:14.080]  video biden apparently forgets obama's name
[03:08:14.080 --> 03:08:18.880]  kit daniel story up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com
[03:08:18.880 --> 03:08:23.520]  i said it months and months and months and months and months and months ago
[03:08:23.520 --> 03:08:28.960]  i said that biden's had another stroke he's slurring all his words he'll never
[03:08:28.960 --> 03:08:33.440]  make it until the end of the campaign a year
[03:08:33.440 --> 03:08:37.280]  plus away a year and three months away he's never gonna make it
[03:08:37.280 --> 03:08:41.440]  he's neurologically just everything's a calf everything's marbles in his mouth
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:44.880]  and so who's going to come in at the last minute
[03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:48.640]  michelle obama hillary i know they've been in talks told you that a year ago
[03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:53.280]  i don't make this stuff up she's basically still on the campaign trail
[03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:56.640]  nobody's showing up but their arrogance is incredible
[03:08:56.640 --> 03:09:00.800]  so here's that clip of biden because they invaded
[03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:04.720]  another country and annexed a significant portion of what called
[03:09:04.720 --> 03:09:09.360]  crimina right he's saying that it was president
[03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:15.760]  my boss it was his fault my boss he can't even say obama
[03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:20.880]  and the gaffes just keep rolling let's take a few final calls here
[03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:25.680]  who's been holding longest rex rex in texas
[03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:28.480]  84 year old info warrior about to read that earlier i got you on first i
[03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:33.440]  apologize rex welcome sir uh recently i took a look at
[03:09:33.440 --> 03:09:39.280]  your uh uh documentary about the un having taken over the
[03:09:39.280 --> 03:09:46.320]  national parks and the presidio yes and how the uh how we gave the uh deep
[03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:53.600]  water ports in la costa casco and china uh and then uh it ended up
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:57.360]  with you being in austin uh refusing to give your
[03:09:57.360 --> 03:10:01.760]  thumbprint for uh driver's license yes sir that's america destroyed by design
[03:10:01.760 --> 03:10:05.600]  made that in 1997 yeah that's great thank you
[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:10.160]  can you talk today about another right other rights being taken away
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:14.320]  well you know uh they're trying to implement the real
[03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:21.040]  uh national real id act right here in texas very dangerous
[03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:25.120]  yeah and when you're applying for driver's license renewal you have to
[03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:30.000]  have a birth certificate or passport but the illegal aliens don't need that
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:33.680]  oh that's right that's exactly right and
[03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:38.400]  uh i think we really need to push back about that
[03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:41.360]  i wholeheartedly agree with you what do you think about trump
[03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:44.720]  taking on china you think he's really doing it that last caller says trumps
[03:10:44.720 --> 03:10:48.960]  basically run by china no i think he's taking him on
[03:10:48.960 --> 03:10:56.800]  i uh and uh i i um kind of like you there are things that uh
[03:10:56.800 --> 03:11:00.880]  i'm questioning uh i think he should be a little more
[03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:06.960]  uh war swole about protecting the borders and things like that but uh
[03:11:06.960 --> 03:11:11.040]  he's the best we got right now and they're sure as hell trying to take him
[03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:14.000]  out rex god bless you i appreciate you calling
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:18.400]  rape points i love that guy's voice uh let's go ahead and talk to justin in
[03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:22.320]  ohio justin and then josh go ahead justin
[03:11:22.320 --> 03:11:24.960]  it's a pleasure to talk to you at least this is the first time i actually had
[03:11:24.960 --> 03:11:28.240]  the opportunity to talk to you brother
[03:11:28.240 --> 03:11:32.000]  so there's three different things that i wanted to cover one being with china
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.960]  the other thing with uh china and hong kong
[03:11:34.960 --> 03:11:38.560]  with you know how much deep state and the cabal is kind of against trump
[03:11:38.560 --> 03:11:42.320]  what do you think that the chances are that they'll try doing an arm
[03:11:42.320 --> 03:11:45.760]  arming the hong kong civilians under the united states name and then
[03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:49.440]  blame it on trump kind of pushes us into like a
[03:11:49.440 --> 03:11:52.720]  now arm call that's a great point because there's not martial law in hong kong
[03:11:52.720 --> 03:11:56.800]  now could the chai kom stage a false flag to make it look like
[03:11:56.800 --> 03:12:00.320]  the hong kongers are the bad guys that's the exact type of card they may play
[03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:03.760]  because right now the chai kom's pull anything big or get violent a new
[03:12:03.760 --> 03:12:07.360]  tenement square word is the whole mainland may collapse because they're
[03:12:07.360 --> 03:12:13.440]  in a state of rebellion already correct uh the other uh points uh one was
[03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:18.640]  going to be on uh the red flag laws uh so what do we what do we have like 22 000
[03:12:18.640 --> 03:12:22.320]  uh you know uh gun laws they're already on the books
[03:12:22.320 --> 03:12:26.480]  or you know maybe more than that uh what and red flags wouldn't say any of these
[03:12:26.480 --> 03:12:29.600]  people exactly exactly so why were we going to put
[03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:32.640]  one more on it's like beating a dead horse and expecting to win the race
[03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:37.920]  well trump wants to make it look like in crimshaw to the soccer moms
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:40.240]  that they're doing something they're going to vote against them regardless
[03:12:40.240 --> 03:12:44.480]  crimshaw is a lightweight he still thinks big corporate media is powerful
[03:12:44.480 --> 03:12:47.520]  uh i mean believe me that guy sticks his finger up to which way the wind blows
[03:12:47.520 --> 03:12:50.880]  and then trumps listening to advisors saying sir you need these women in
[03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:54.480]  blue state areas that went for you that are purple areas and at least act like
[03:12:54.480 --> 03:12:56.880]  you're doing something sir no we should come out and blame
[03:12:56.880 --> 03:13:00.080]  the psychotropic drugs they're on and the fact of all the warnings
[03:13:00.080 --> 03:13:03.120]  and and and make that the issue that's what we've got to do
[03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:07.120]  thank you justin thank you so much for holding these are amazing calls today
[03:13:07.120 --> 03:13:10.800]  josh in washington you're on the air go ahead
[03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:15.120]  alex god bless you i have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:19.520]  instead of this is your brain this is your brain on drugs
[03:13:19.520 --> 03:13:22.880]  this is your brain this is your brain on 5g
[03:13:22.880 --> 03:13:26.960]  oh yeah showing your brain getting frat
[03:13:26.960 --> 03:13:32.480]  uh then i have some ideas for um or some comments on your supplements man
[03:13:32.480 --> 03:13:37.280]  totally changed my life i use turbo force bodies alpha power brain force
[03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:42.480]  the fish oil ultra 12 daily x2 every several days now
[03:13:42.480 --> 03:13:46.160]  and uh what i found is is really combining them
[03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:51.520]  is uh it's totally synergistic and transcendent
[03:13:51.520 --> 03:13:56.240]  uh feeling that i get by combining all your products and i just want to urge
[03:13:56.240 --> 03:13:59.600]  all your listeners who haven't tried them i just want to say why not
[03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:03.200]  uh well you're right that all of these things are known
[03:14:03.200 --> 03:14:06.160]  to be incredible whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the
[03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:10.000]  krill oil or whether it's the dna force with the coq 10 and bio pqq and
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:13.200]  all the rest of it all of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:16.800]  body people think just dumping energy you know drinks on it will do something
[03:14:16.800 --> 03:14:20.880]  no if your base isn't there none of it works but you take these bases together
[03:14:20.880 --> 03:14:24.480]  then you have your foundation now you can build the big strong temple
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:27.760]  it's not that i'm perfect either i treat my body really bad but with these
[03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:30.720]  products i take when i religiously remember to take them it makes my life
[03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:34.480]  so much better and then it funds the information war which is so critical
[03:14:34.480 --> 03:14:37.840]  so thank you what was your point on trump taking action
[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:41.280]  i just want to say to to trump not to telegraph everything it's like a
[03:14:41.280 --> 03:14:44.240]  quarterback letting the defense know where you're about to throw a pass
[03:14:44.240 --> 03:14:47.280]  and then the defense picks it off and runs in to the end zone
[03:14:47.280 --> 03:14:51.200]  i wish trump would just take legal and lawful action get things done
[03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:54.640]  don't let everybody and especially his enemies in the media and
[03:14:54.640 --> 03:14:58.000]  and uh globalists know exactly what he's going to do
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:02.080]  just do it you don't have to spend all this time on twitter letting everybody
[03:15:02.080 --> 03:15:06.560]  know what you're going to do trump just take action legally and lawfully
[03:15:06.560 --> 03:15:13.840]  you're the commander-in-chief get it done and and it once it's done it's done
[03:15:13.840 --> 03:15:16.880]  i totally agree with you i mean i think twitter is still very useful you should
[03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:19.440]  do more fireside chat stuff like ross perot would do
[03:15:19.440 --> 03:15:22.800]  showing graphs and things not just his chopper talks but
[03:15:22.800 --> 03:15:26.000]  um just don't become dan krenshaw i think that's the moral of the story thank
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:29.520]  you so much god bless you we got to all the calls today

[03:17:55.600 --> 03:17:59.280]  hey alex yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked
[03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:02.640]  to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is
[03:18:02.640 --> 03:18:06.720]  that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying
[03:18:06.720 --> 03:18:10.640]  desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:14.560]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[03:18:14.560 --> 03:18:17.840]  that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[03:18:17.840 --> 03:18:20.480]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him
[03:18:20.480 --> 03:18:23.360]  it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i
[03:18:23.360 --> 03:18:26.400]  just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:30.240]  reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're
[03:18:30.240 --> 03:18:33.680]  80 years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they
[03:18:33.680 --> 03:18:38.560]  do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and
[03:18:38.560 --> 03:18:42.240]  there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are gonna continue
[03:18:42.240 --> 03:18:45.680]  we're gonna keep fighting in the input war and even if something does happen to
[03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:50.000]  you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:55.440]  for liberty thank you sir for calling thomas jefferson predicted
[03:18:55.440 --> 03:18:59.440]  over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future
[03:18:59.440 --> 03:19:03.120]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:06.480]  who actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation and today
[03:19:06.480 --> 03:19:10.640]  the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago
[03:19:10.640 --> 03:19:14.960]  and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president
[03:19:14.960 --> 03:19:19.520]  and what he's doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our farmers
[03:19:19.520 --> 03:19:23.120]  that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to
[03:19:23.120 --> 03:19:26.560]  back down so to the walking cruises and the
[03:19:26.560 --> 03:19:29.760]  hillary clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back
[03:19:29.760 --> 03:19:33.360]  down we're never going to give up and all you've done is a wake of the human
[03:19:33.360 --> 03:19:38.160]  spirit and the human spirit lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com

[03:20:04.880 --> 03:20:09.440]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order
[03:20:09.440 --> 03:20:15.600]  it's alex jones with mike adams
[03:20:15.600 --> 03:20:18.640]  all right mike adams a natural news stepping in here for the remainder of
[03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:21.680]  the fourth hour on the alex jones show this
[03:20:21.680 --> 03:20:25.680]  day this uh what is august 28th wow time
[03:20:25.680 --> 03:20:30.000]  is flying it's always great to be here and i appreciate your attention
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:33.600]  to the urgency of the issues that we're now facing i've got some bombshell
[03:20:33.600 --> 03:20:36.720]  items to share with you over the next couple of segments
[03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:40.640]  let's just get right to them uh first of all a big question
[03:20:40.640 --> 03:20:44.560]  about is andrew mccabe going to be charged is anybody
[03:20:44.560 --> 03:20:48.240]  in the deep state going to be charged for the criminal coup attempt
[03:20:48.240 --> 03:20:51.120]  against president trump the illegal surveillance
[03:20:51.120 --> 03:20:55.760]  is barack obama going to be charged or hillary clinton and the corruption of
[03:20:55.760 --> 03:20:58.960]  the clinton family uh or the clinton foundation
[03:20:58.960 --> 03:21:03.120]  that took money from international sources as a kind of
[03:21:03.120 --> 03:21:07.760]  pre-purchase bribery of what she thought would be her presidency in the
[03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:13.200]  white house because the question is if these people aren't going to be charged
[03:21:13.200 --> 03:21:18.080]  then we have a lawless society and we are living under a deep state
[03:21:18.080 --> 03:21:22.080]  dictatorship i mean we either charge these criminals
[03:21:22.080 --> 03:21:26.000]  for the treason that they committed for the fisa court fraud
[03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:29.360]  for the lying and the illegal leaking of people like james comey
[03:21:29.360 --> 03:21:33.600]  we either charge these people or the rule of law does not exist in this
[03:21:33.600 --> 03:21:36.720]  country and i hope and i believe that william bar
[03:21:36.720 --> 03:21:40.160]  understands this by the way and i think that president trump understands
[03:21:40.160 --> 03:21:44.480]  this as well but we cannot let these criminals get away
[03:21:44.480 --> 03:21:48.480]  with what they attempted to do they tried to overthrow the country
[03:21:48.480 --> 03:21:53.040]  they got caught they have been stopped and it's time
[03:21:53.040 --> 03:21:57.120]  to charge them to criminally indict them otherwise
[03:21:57.120 --> 03:22:01.360]  what do we have why would any citizen follow any law ever again
[03:22:01.360 --> 03:22:06.400]  in this country if the people with the most power can't even be held accountable
[03:22:06.400 --> 03:22:10.080]  for the most malicious crimes carried out against this country
[03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:14.160]  so that's the first item watch the news to see if andrew mccave gets charged
[03:22:14.160 --> 03:22:18.240]  in the coming days a second item that's very important
[03:22:18.240 --> 03:22:22.240]  there's a new program that has been pushed by
[03:22:22.240 --> 03:22:27.360]  an organization called the susanne right foundation this is being pushed
[03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:32.800]  onto president trump as a new form of monitoring the mental illness of people
[03:22:32.800 --> 03:22:37.120]  to try to assert red flag gun control oppression
[03:22:37.120 --> 03:22:43.120]  this program is called harpa h a r p a and again it's the susanne right
[03:22:43.120 --> 03:22:46.720]  foundation that is pushing this what's crucial to understand about this and i
[03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:50.320]  i know that i think i want to cover this the other day as well
[03:22:50.320 --> 03:22:54.800]  but what's important understand is that this program calls for the government
[03:22:54.800 --> 03:22:58.320]  to monitor the mental health of all americans
[03:22:58.320 --> 03:23:02.640]  by surveilling you through all of the tech company devices that you are
[03:23:02.640 --> 03:23:07.120]  installing in your home such as amazon echo or
[03:23:07.120 --> 03:23:11.520]  alexa or the google nest devices that have microphones in them
[03:23:11.520 --> 03:23:15.040]  and they listen to everything that you say in your own home
[03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:19.760]  so any by the way if you are installing any of these devices in your home
[03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:23.840]  you're a fool because they're just spy devices why would you pay amazon
[03:23:23.840 --> 03:23:29.520]  to install a spy device in your home i mean amazon actually sells or at least
[03:23:29.520 --> 03:23:33.520]  they did a video camera that you're supposed to install in your bedroom
[03:23:33.520 --> 03:23:37.760]  to watch you get undressed so that amazon can make recommendations on your
[03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:43.920]  wardrobe who buys that what kind of sheeple
[03:23:43.920 --> 03:23:49.280]  buys a a spy camera from amazon and installs it in their bedroom
[03:23:49.280 --> 03:23:52.560]  and i tell you there are probably millions of people willing to do that
[03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:56.720]  because i don't know their fluoride damage their lead damage their their
[03:23:56.720 --> 03:24:00.880]  medicated to death they've lost the ability to think for themselves
[03:24:00.880 --> 03:24:04.000]  they don't understand what it means to be free or to have privacy
[03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:07.840]  so they're buying these devices from google and amazon and other companies
[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:12.080]  and installing them in their homes apple apple siri
[03:24:12.080 --> 03:24:17.040]  is always listening to what you say i mean amazon has been caught
[03:24:17.040 --> 03:24:20.640]  monitoring all your private conversations they have entire
[03:24:20.640 --> 03:24:24.160]  teams of people that sit there and listen to what you say
[03:24:24.160 --> 03:24:28.080]  they record and archive everything you say it's a spy device in your home
[03:24:28.080 --> 03:24:32.400]  in any case the push here is to have the government
[03:24:32.400 --> 03:24:35.680]  archive all of that audio and video in some cases
[03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:40.960]  from your private home and then to do what they would do a
[03:24:40.960 --> 03:24:44.880]  a transcription of what you said they would convert it into text
[03:24:44.880 --> 03:24:47.840]  and then they would use a keyword density search algorithm
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:51.600]  to score the text of what you're saying and to score it
[03:24:51.600 --> 03:24:55.440]  for red flag keywords such as of course
[03:24:55.440 --> 03:25:00.960]  alex jones or ar-15 or whatever keyword they want to put in there
[03:25:00.960 --> 03:25:05.920]  so if you're talking at home and you say alex jones and you say
[03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:09.680]  a second amendment and you say president trump whatever
[03:25:09.680 --> 03:25:12.720]  you're going to get red flagged and they're going to say that they have to
[03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:16.480]  take away your guns and that they're using mental illness
[03:25:16.480 --> 03:25:20.480]  profiles now to help prevent mass shootings
[03:25:20.480 --> 03:25:24.320]  that is harpa and that's what's being pushed now
[03:25:24.320 --> 03:25:28.880]  fortunately president trump so far has rejected that program
[03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:31.600]  i don't think he will push this but i just want you to understand that's
[03:25:31.600 --> 03:25:34.880]  what's being pushed through and it's a very dangerous program
[03:25:34.880 --> 03:25:39.040]  okay the next thing um ruth bader ginsberg
[03:25:39.040 --> 03:25:42.720]  i've talked to some other doctors about ginsberg and her
[03:25:42.720 --> 03:25:46.720]  condition and based on the information that has been publicly released by the
[03:25:46.720 --> 03:25:52.000]  u.s supreme court about her well it was a laser ablation
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:57.920]  tumor removal surgery a kind of radiotherapy for tumors on her
[03:25:57.920 --> 03:26:02.640]  pancreas and she had a bile duct stent
[03:26:02.640 --> 03:26:06.640]  installed as part of that procedure well according to the physicians that i've
[03:26:06.640 --> 03:26:09.920]  talked to who are very familiar with cancer surgery
[03:26:09.920 --> 03:26:13.520]  this is a very strong indication that ruth bader ginsberg
[03:26:13.520 --> 03:26:18.400]  probably does not have long to live and i've been told the chances are
[03:26:18.400 --> 03:26:21.760]  about 90 percent that she will not make it to
[03:26:21.760 --> 03:26:26.720]  christmas of this year and of course we're going to be very
[03:26:26.720 --> 03:26:32.320]  saddened to see anybody die of cancer especially when those of us like my
[03:26:32.320 --> 03:26:36.640]  website natural news you know we promote natural holistic
[03:26:36.640 --> 03:26:40.960]  cancer cures but we are censored by google and apple
[03:26:40.960 --> 03:26:44.320]  and facebook and twitter and so even if ruth bader ginsberg
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:48.240]  wanted to have access to natural cancer cures which by the way i'd be happy to
[03:26:48.240 --> 03:26:51.360]  share with her she would not be able to find
[03:26:51.360 --> 03:26:54.720]  that information through google because of the extreme
[03:26:54.720 --> 03:26:59.360]  tech censorship so the tech giants are actually killing ruth bader ginsberg
[03:26:59.360 --> 03:27:03.040]  by denying her and people like her access to
[03:27:03.040 --> 03:27:06.480]  natural remedies natural cures holistic cancer treatments and so on
[03:27:06.480 --> 03:27:10.560]  that could very well save her life in other words ruth bader ginsberg
[03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:17.600]  appears to be going down with the the system that she helped create
[03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:21.760]  this oppressive tyrannical radical left-wing system
[03:27:21.760 --> 03:27:27.360]  is actually in a sense exacerbating her own cancer which is very sad to see
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:30.640]  now the upshot of all of this you know as much as i don't want to see anybody
[03:27:30.640 --> 03:27:33.760]  suffer pancreatic cancer is a very very painful type of cancer
[03:27:33.760 --> 03:27:37.680]  you wouldn't wish that on your worst enemy it's very painful to go through
[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:40.880]  that and the prognoses that are out there for pancreatic
[03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:46.080]  cancer you know diagnoses are very poor
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:50.240]  so but the upshot is that if she does pass or whenever she does pass
[03:27:50.240 --> 03:27:54.000]  that president trump is likely to nominate amy barrett
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:27:57.760]  so of course the left is already anticipating this and they are right
[03:27:57.760 --> 03:28:01.120]  now trying to come up with ways to smear amy barrett
[03:28:01.120 --> 03:28:03.520]  so they're trying to come up with the same kind of smears that they leveled
[03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:07.200]  against cavanaugh where they just completely fabricated all these
[03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:11.040]  accusations of rape just they and they they had you know
[03:28:11.040 --> 03:28:15.440]  actors come forth all these fake accusations and fake memories

[03:28:22.960 --> 03:28:27.120]  and they are working up plots and plans in order to do that
[03:28:27.120 --> 03:28:31.760]  and the entire left-wing media will have a coordinated campaign
[03:28:31.760 --> 03:28:35.280]  to try to destroy any nominee that president trump
[03:28:35.280 --> 03:28:39.120]  puts forward if ruth bader ginsberg passes away during
[03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:43.040]  trump's presidency which looks very likely so i have a lot more straight

[03:30:00.160 --> 03:30:03.600]  five six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits
[03:30:03.600 --> 03:30:05.440]  the rest of it i would talk about how great the
[03:30:05.440 --> 03:30:08.480]  products are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors
[03:30:08.480 --> 03:30:11.600]  on and experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years
[03:30:11.600 --> 03:30:14.800]  i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest
[03:30:14.800 --> 03:30:17.040]  thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and
[03:30:17.040 --> 03:30:19.920]  how wonderful they work and the left always has headlines everywhere
[03:30:19.920 --> 03:30:24.720]  jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under
[03:30:24.720 --> 03:30:28.880]  federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement
[03:30:28.880 --> 03:30:32.080]  has been through the fda because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it
[03:30:32.080 --> 03:30:35.840]  but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are
[03:30:35.840 --> 03:30:39.120]  is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do
[03:30:39.120 --> 03:30:42.080]  different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with
[03:30:42.080 --> 03:30:45.920]  mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine
[03:30:45.920 --> 03:30:49.200]  chest info or store dot com or triple eight
[03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:56.160]  two five three three one three nine as we witness the most disastrous geological

[03:30:59.600 --> 03:31:04.240]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war

[03:33:11.840 --> 03:33:22.160]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[03:33:22.160 --> 03:33:26.160]  the bombshell story put up by the wall street journal just a few days ago the
[03:33:26.160 --> 03:33:30.160]  title is quote amazon has seated control of its
[03:33:30.160 --> 03:33:33.600]  site the result thousands of banned unsafe or
[03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:37.280]  mislabeled products now the wall street journal in its
[03:33:37.280 --> 03:33:43.680]  investigation found over 4100 products for sale on amazon.com
[03:33:43.680 --> 03:33:48.080]  that were blatantly fraudulent many of them violated heavy metals
[03:33:48.080 --> 03:33:51.360]  limitations for supplements or children's health
[03:33:51.360 --> 03:33:55.360]  many of them violated state law many of them had a falsely claimed to be fda
[03:33:55.360 --> 03:33:59.600]  compliant many of them were blatantly illegal
[03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:04.640]  that have been products that were banned by states or the federal government
[03:34:04.640 --> 03:34:09.120]  and this it's it's extraordinary the wall street journal this is really a
[03:34:09.120 --> 03:34:12.160]  great piece of journalism by the wall street journal i commend them for this
[03:34:12.160 --> 03:34:15.680]  story what i find fascinating is that at
[03:34:15.680 --> 03:34:19.520]  natural news we had a story i think three or four days before this
[03:34:19.520 --> 03:34:23.280]  that talked about amazon.com selling a supplement
[03:34:23.280 --> 03:34:26.560]  with very high levels of lead and aluminum and you don't
[03:34:26.560 --> 03:34:30.080]  for the producers you don't need to show that on the screen
[03:34:30.080 --> 03:34:37.920]  my point here is if you wonder why info war store is a better place to buy
[03:34:37.920 --> 03:34:42.640]  supplements than amazon.com this just underscores it the wall street
[03:34:42.640 --> 03:34:47.280]  journal has just confirmed what we've been saying at natural news for years
[03:34:47.280 --> 03:34:51.040]  which is that amazon.com is and you can quote me on this
[03:34:51.040 --> 03:34:57.680]  amazon.com is a marketplace of fraud a marketplace of toxic heavy metals
[03:34:57.680 --> 03:35:02.560]  a marketplace of illegal products that even confirmed by the wall street
[03:35:02.560 --> 03:35:05.360]  journal products that are banned they're illegal they're fraudulent
[03:35:05.360 --> 03:35:09.440]  with false claims and yet you know you look at infowarstore.com in
[03:35:09.440 --> 03:35:14.160]  contrast is fully compliant with all the regulators is
[03:35:14.160 --> 03:35:19.280]  incredibly tightly run the labels are reviewed the ingredients are reviewed
[03:35:19.280 --> 03:35:22.720]  we even do lab testing of many of the info wars products
[03:35:22.720 --> 03:35:26.480]  just has another layer to check everything and everything's great
[03:35:26.480 --> 03:35:29.200]  some of the products we've tested have been just extraordinary
[03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:33.200]  and you know of course i do that for for all all the all my own products as well
[03:35:33.200 --> 03:35:36.400]  the point is that amazon.com is a place where
[03:35:36.400 --> 03:35:39.120]  you're going to get into heavy metals you're going to get into illegal
[03:35:39.120 --> 03:35:43.120]  products and and if you want safe
[03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:46.560]  supplements or safe superfoods you need to get them directly
[03:35:46.560 --> 03:35:49.760]  from the sources you trust like infowarstore.com
[03:35:49.760 --> 03:35:54.080]  i mean it's just another big reason to do that again proven by the wall street
[03:35:54.080 --> 03:35:57.760]  journal and here's something just shocking and i'm not going to mention
[03:35:57.760 --> 03:36:00.880]  any brand names and guys don't show anything on the screen here i don't
[03:36:00.880 --> 03:36:03.680]  i don't want you to get dragged into any kind of issue here
[03:36:03.680 --> 03:36:10.400]  but we found a product sold by amazon.com that contains basically two
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:13.440]  ingredients one of the ingredients is a
[03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:17.360]  mined oxidized coal and the other ingredient
[03:36:17.360 --> 03:36:21.360]  is an industrial fertilizer and it's put into capsules
[03:36:21.360 --> 03:36:25.840]  and it's sold to the public and it is blatantly
[03:36:25.840 --> 03:36:31.040]  outrageously out of any any kind of compliance with regulations but it's
[03:36:31.040 --> 03:36:33.920]  sold by amazon.com and it falsely claims to be
[03:36:33.920 --> 03:36:37.840]  prop 65 compliant we ran all the tests on that supplement
[03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:42.080]  found it's wildly out of compliance has extremely high levels of lead and
[03:36:42.080 --> 03:36:45.360]  aluminum and it's marketed to children so isn't it
[03:36:45.360 --> 03:36:49.680]  interesting that the left-wing media never
[03:36:49.680 --> 03:36:54.000]  never goes after amazon.com i mean this story by the wall street journal
[03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:57.760]  was a rare exception and wall street journal you can't argue
[03:36:57.760 --> 03:37:00.800]  they're not really left-wing corporate controlled media
[03:37:00.800 --> 03:37:05.280]  they're you know finance media wall street medium but the mainstream media
[03:37:05.280 --> 03:37:08.960]  will attack info wars and they will attack
[03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:12.400]  independent media but they will never expose the truth
[03:37:12.400 --> 03:37:16.000]  about the massive fraud and heavy metals and illegal products
[03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:19.600]  that are sold on amazon.com isn't that interesting
[03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:24.160]  and of course now you know why but once again just underscores the truth about
[03:37:24.160 --> 03:37:27.280]  what we're talking about here you know wall street journal
[03:37:27.280 --> 03:37:31.280]  116 products falsely labeled as FDA approved
[03:37:31.280 --> 03:37:36.160]  43 listings for a pain reliever that lacked FDA labels warning against use on
[03:37:36.160 --> 03:37:40.320]  children 80 listings of an infant sleeping
[03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:43.760]  wedge that the FDA has warned can kill children
[03:37:43.760 --> 03:37:49.360]  and 1400 electronic listings that falsely claimed to be UL
[03:37:49.360 --> 03:37:53.520]  certified it just goes on and on and on the truth is
[03:37:53.520 --> 03:37:58.080]  amazon.com runs virtually no quality control
[03:37:58.080 --> 03:38:01.760]  and they don't check the compliance of almost anything they sell
[03:38:01.760 --> 03:38:04.960]  a third-party seller can go on to amazon and they can make
[03:38:04.960 --> 03:38:09.120]  any claim they want and they can put anything in a capsule they can dig up
[03:38:09.120 --> 03:38:14.080]  gravel and put it in a capsule and sell it and amazon will sell it
[03:38:14.080 --> 03:38:18.960]  that's the truth that's the cold hard truth about what we found and what the
[03:38:18.960 --> 03:38:22.560]  wall street journal has found so again if you want quality
[03:38:22.560 --> 03:38:26.720]  safe clean compliant supplements you shop at
[03:38:26.720 --> 03:38:30.800]  infowarsstore.com and and the independent sites that you know and trust
[03:38:30.800 --> 03:38:34.160]  that's what you do that's how you solve that problem
[03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:37.520]  it's crucial to understand that this is what's happening okay
[03:38:37.520 --> 03:38:41.520]  moving on to another issue here we've got
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:45.520]  now confirmation from several sources you know i have a lot of
[03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:52.880]  different sources in various realms of we'll say defense or self defense
[03:38:52.880 --> 03:38:58.960]  we now have confirmation that there are a new technology exists for drones
[03:38:58.960 --> 03:39:03.200]  drones have now been outfitted with not only
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:07.600]  rifles essentially sort of customized rifles that go on to the drones
[03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:12.320]  but they now have ballistics software coupled with
[03:39:12.320 --> 03:39:18.320]  rangefinders thermal imaging that in essence drones can now
[03:39:18.320 --> 03:39:25.440]  engage human targets at night from altitude from
[03:39:25.440 --> 03:39:29.920]  500 to a thousand feet of altitude while they are moving
[03:39:29.920 --> 03:39:33.760]  and the ballistics software in these drones compensates for the movement of
[03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:37.120]  the drones compensates for all the ballistics
[03:39:37.120 --> 03:39:39.840]  properties that you normally have in ballistics software you know density
[03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:44.000]  altitude barometric pressure temperature spin drift
[03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:46.640]  all these things that you normally do if you're a long range shooter you know
[03:39:46.640 --> 03:39:50.480]  about all this stuff this is all now programmed into the
[03:39:50.480 --> 03:39:54.080]  drones they have a rangefinder and a thermal imaging system and they can
[03:39:54.080 --> 03:39:57.680]  lock on to a human target this now exists
[03:39:57.680 --> 03:40:00.720]  it has been confirmed they've been tested at night
[03:40:00.720 --> 03:40:04.080]  obviously not on human targets but you can probably imagine what kind of
[03:40:04.080 --> 03:40:08.880]  targets might they might be tested on and the technology
[03:40:08.880 --> 03:40:13.040]  works and it puts rounds into specific
[03:40:13.040 --> 03:40:17.600]  organs of specific targets on the ground from altitude
[03:40:17.600 --> 03:40:21.280]  at night now the reason i mentioned this
[03:40:21.280 --> 03:40:25.520]  is because well you know the info wars listeners
[03:40:25.520 --> 03:40:29.600]  a very informed very intelligent audience you can probably connect the dots on
[03:40:29.600 --> 03:40:33.440]  this you can do the math on this about maybe how the next
[03:40:33.440 --> 03:40:36.800]  big false flag event might be constructed
[03:40:36.800 --> 03:40:42.880]  i'll just leave it at that okay next comment changing changing the subject
[03:40:42.880 --> 03:40:47.040]  here uh Dave Chappelle has a a new special on
[03:40:47.040 --> 03:40:51.120]  Netflix i encourage you to take a look at this even though i don't support
[03:40:51.120 --> 03:40:53.120]  Netflix that Netflix puts out a lot of
[03:40:53.120 --> 03:40:56.480]  horrifically bad propaganda to indoctrinate children
[03:40:56.480 --> 03:41:01.120]  into satanism and liberalism but Dave Chappelle
[03:41:01.120 --> 03:41:04.960]  really deserves i think a round of applause for his latest special where
[03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:09.280]  he takes it to the transgender community and he
[03:41:09.280 --> 03:41:13.280]  he says in fact in his special that every black man and woman in america
[03:41:13.280 --> 03:41:18.400]  should register to legally own a firearm and he talks about the firearms that he
[03:41:18.400 --> 03:41:22.800]  owns and why he needs them and how he uses guns for self-defense
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:27.200]  and again Dave Chappelle who says he doesn't like guns but he's got him and
[03:41:27.200 --> 03:41:30.640]  he's explaining to his audience why you need him and why every black person
[03:41:30.640 --> 03:41:36.080]  in america needs a gun of course every free citizen needs a gun
[03:41:36.080 --> 03:41:39.760]  regardless of your color and you may not agree with Dave Chappelle
[03:41:39.760 --> 03:41:42.720]  on everything of course no one ever would but
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:48.160]  Chappelle has courage he has real courage to get up on stage and to
[03:41:48.160 --> 03:41:51.520]  criticize the transgender indoctrination of children
[03:41:51.520 --> 03:41:56.160]  to criticize the the political correctness indoctrination and brainwashing
[03:41:56.160 --> 03:42:00.640]  of the masses of our country and he's got the guts to say that
[03:42:00.640 --> 03:42:04.720]  he needs to own some guns for self-defense uh whatever you think of Dave
[03:42:04.720 --> 03:42:08.320]  Chappelle and you know again he's done some
[03:42:08.320 --> 03:42:11.840]  a few crazy things in the past but so what he's he's
[03:42:11.840 --> 03:42:15.840]  he's speaking his truth and he's not being censored
[03:42:15.840 --> 03:42:20.000]  and he's refusing to kowtow to the thought police and the speech police of
[03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:24.080]  america meanwhile you have taylor swift who is nothing but a brainwashed
[03:42:24.080 --> 03:42:26.640]  puppet who says whatever the globalists want her to say
[03:42:26.640 --> 03:42:32.640]  so compare those two Dave Chappelle he deserves credit for speaking the truth
[03:42:32.640 --> 03:42:36.720]  taylor swift deserves calm condemnation in my view
[03:42:36.720 --> 03:42:40.080]  for being a puppet at the globalist and saying whatever they want her to say
[03:42:40.080 --> 03:42:43.440]  interesting contrast isn't it there's more straight ahead here on the alex

[03:47:05.200 --> 03:47:10.160]  what come here win
[03:47:10.160 --> 03:47:13.440]  win what are we waiting for
[03:47:13.440 --> 03:47:33.600]  take this win
[03:47:43.440 --> 03:48:01.120]  It's Alex Jones, and now your host, Mike Adams.
[03:48:01.120 --> 03:48:10.200]  I'm interested in the video, we're just watching there Bernie Sanders trying to run a punching
[03:48:10.200 --> 03:48:14.760]  bag, a drilled bag there, and getting the slapped in the face.
[03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:19.240]  It's a good metaphor for socialism, every time socialists try to control the economy,
[03:48:19.240 --> 03:48:21.520]  they get slapped in the face.
[03:48:21.520 --> 03:48:25.960]  Every time they try to run a city, the city collapses into destitution and filth.
[03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:29.480]  And if you put socialists in charge of the country, they're going to collapse America
[03:48:29.480 --> 03:48:31.960]  just like they've collapsed all their left wing cities.
[03:48:31.960 --> 03:48:34.760]  I mean, it's a reasonable question to ask.
[03:48:34.760 --> 03:48:41.080]  How do you Democrats think you can run the country when you can't even keep feces off
[03:48:41.080 --> 03:48:47.880]  the streets of San Francisco, and you can't even keep all the homeless addicts, drug abusers
[03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:51.960]  from defecating all over the streets of Austin or every liberal city?
[03:48:51.960 --> 03:48:53.560]  How do you think you can run the country?
[03:48:53.560 --> 03:48:55.200]  They can't, of course.
[03:48:55.200 --> 03:49:00.080]  But continuing with some of our food research today, here's a couple more important things
[03:49:00.080 --> 03:49:04.160]  I have to share with you, and then I'm going to get to Project Scopex, which is the Bill
[03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:05.640]  Gates project.
[03:49:05.640 --> 03:49:10.400]  He's funded it that's going to try to drop calcium carbonate and lead all over the world
[03:49:10.400 --> 03:49:13.240]  to block out the sun and contaminate the soils.
[03:49:13.240 --> 03:49:15.400]  I've got some new information on that to share with you.
[03:49:15.400 --> 03:49:22.320]  But first, there was breaking news over the last couple of days, or five days or so, about
[03:49:22.320 --> 03:49:29.160]  a farmer in the Midwest who was convicted of organic fraud, and he committed suicide
[03:49:29.160 --> 03:49:30.760]  to avoid going to prison.
[03:49:30.760 --> 03:49:35.760]  The Associated Press covered this, I believe his name is Randy Constant, and he was a farmer
[03:49:35.760 --> 03:49:38.840]  in Missouri and, I think, Iowa.
[03:49:38.840 --> 03:49:47.480]  Anyway, he carried out organic fraud for eight years, producing millions of bushels of organic,
[03:49:47.480 --> 03:49:53.080]  so-called organic soybeans and so-called organic corn that actually was not organic.
[03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:58.560]  And what he did is he laundered those grains through animal operations to feed all those
[03:49:58.560 --> 03:50:04.600]  fake organic grains to cattle and chickens and so on, and then he sold and advertised
[03:50:04.600 --> 03:50:07.480]  that meat as being organic meat.
[03:50:07.480 --> 03:50:12.800]  It was all fraud, and he eventually got caught and he got convicted and sentenced to 10 years
[03:50:12.800 --> 03:50:13.800]  in prison.
[03:50:13.800 --> 03:50:19.600]  Some of the other farmers that he was associated with also got sentenced to shorter prison sentences.
[03:50:19.600 --> 03:50:24.240]  But the real question here is, and this has everything to do with where you get your food
[03:50:24.240 --> 03:50:29.080]  and where you get your supplements, why didn't the USDA catch this?
[03:50:29.080 --> 03:50:30.240]  Why did it take eight years?
[03:50:30.240 --> 03:50:36.760]  I mean, this guy produced up to 8% of the soybeans grown in the United States of America
[03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:39.240]  of organic soybeans, and it was all fraud.
[03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:42.400]  How come he got away with it for eight years?
[03:50:42.400 --> 03:50:46.600]  And I've come to the realization, as a food scientist and running a lab and doing all
[03:50:46.600 --> 03:50:51.360]  this testing, and just like the Amazon.com story from the last segment, Wall Street Journal
[03:50:51.360 --> 03:50:56.920]  found Amazon selling all these high lead, high cadmium products, I found that certified
[03:50:56.920 --> 03:51:02.040]  organic to me doesn't, I don't trust it anymore.
[03:51:02.040 --> 03:51:03.640]  You have to go beyond organic.
[03:51:03.640 --> 03:51:06.960]  You have to have your stuff really lab tested.
[03:51:06.960 --> 03:51:09.640]  You have to get your products from a clean source.
[03:51:09.640 --> 03:51:13.080]  You know, again, Infowars Store is very credible.
[03:51:13.080 --> 03:51:16.920]  They do the research, they do the work, they check their sources.
[03:51:16.920 --> 03:51:22.280]  But if you went out and bought organic meat at a grocery store for the last eight or 10
[03:51:22.280 --> 03:51:25.280]  years, that might have been fraudulent organic meat.
[03:51:25.280 --> 03:51:26.280]  Wasn't organic at all.
[03:51:26.280 --> 03:51:31.280]  You were paying double price or triple price, and it was stamped USDA organic, but it wasn't
[03:51:31.280 --> 03:51:32.280]  organic.
[03:51:32.280 --> 03:51:37.360]  The USDA has big lapses in its program.
[03:51:37.360 --> 03:51:39.640]  And by the way, it's even worse in China.
[03:51:39.640 --> 03:51:45.640]  So of course, once you get dishonest, deceptive communists having certified organic products
[03:51:45.640 --> 03:51:51.120]  exporting to the United States, a lot of that stuff isn't organic at all either.
[03:51:51.120 --> 03:51:55.240]  But this problem exists both in the United States and in China, and it just brings home
[03:51:55.240 --> 03:51:56.240]  the point.
[03:51:56.240 --> 03:51:58.440]  I mean, who can you trust?
[03:51:58.440 --> 03:52:04.000]  Well, not the USDA, and not Amazon, that's for sure.
[03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:09.360]  So I just want to underscore all that, because I promote organics, and I promote nutrition.
[03:52:09.360 --> 03:52:13.560]  And I've encouraged people to buy organic, but now I don't even trust it anymore.
[03:52:13.560 --> 03:52:15.520]  You have to go way beyond just organic.
[03:52:15.520 --> 03:52:17.600]  In other words, gosh, are we surprised?
[03:52:17.600 --> 03:52:19.960]  The government screwed up the organic program.
[03:52:19.960 --> 03:52:24.000]  Wow, what a big surprise that the government is incompetent.
[03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:25.400]  We've made another astonishing discovery.
[03:52:25.400 --> 03:52:26.600]  What do you know?
[03:52:26.600 --> 03:52:31.880]  The government can't run the organic program without allowing all kinds of fraud to persist
[03:52:31.880 --> 03:52:34.520]  for almost a decade in the marketplace.
[03:52:34.520 --> 03:52:36.480]  Is anyone surprised at all?
[03:52:36.480 --> 03:52:37.880]  Of course not.
[03:52:37.880 --> 03:52:40.920]  Okay, Project Scopex.
[03:52:40.920 --> 03:52:46.800]  This is the Bill Gates-funded project I believe involving Harvard scientists to try to block
[03:52:46.800 --> 03:52:50.760]  sunlight because leftists hate the sun.
[03:52:50.760 --> 03:52:56.000]  So Bill Gates has this massive depopulation scheme, of course, to collapse the ecosystem,
[03:52:56.000 --> 03:52:58.160]  destroy the biosphere.
[03:52:58.160 --> 03:53:02.720]  And they say they have to do this for global warming or to stop climate change.
[03:53:02.720 --> 03:53:06.600]  So they're going to poison the atmosphere to accomplish this goal.
[03:53:06.600 --> 03:53:12.240]  But the calcium carbonate that Bill Gates wants to put into the atmosphere is always
[03:53:12.240 --> 03:53:14.360]  contaminated with lead.
[03:53:14.360 --> 03:53:15.360]  We've done these tests.
[03:53:15.360 --> 03:53:16.600]  We've seen this before.
[03:53:16.600 --> 03:53:22.560]  So he's actually talking about dropping lead all over the crops and all the soils of the
[03:53:22.560 --> 03:53:26.200]  world along with the calcium carbonate.
[03:53:26.200 --> 03:53:32.000]  So you're talking about massive lead contamination of the soils, which means some of that lead
[03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:33.920]  gets taken up into the plants.
[03:53:33.920 --> 03:53:37.040]  So you're talking about lead contamination of the plants.
[03:53:37.040 --> 03:53:42.360]  Now when you combine this with the new findings from the Journal of the American Medical Association
[03:53:42.360 --> 03:53:47.280]  about fluoride causing brain damage, and this was covered extensively by Alex Jones and
[03:53:47.280 --> 03:53:55.240]  others on Infowars over the last week or so, you realize that this is a binary weapon system.
[03:53:55.240 --> 03:54:00.800]  It's fluoride to damage the brains, and then it's lead to cause what?
[03:54:00.800 --> 03:54:01.800]  What does lead cause?
[03:54:01.800 --> 03:54:07.720]  Well, according to the state of California, lead causes not only cancer, not only damages
[03:54:07.720 --> 03:54:13.040]  developing brains, but is also responsible for what's called male reproductive toxicity
[03:54:13.040 --> 03:54:15.960]  and female reproductive toxicity.
[03:54:15.960 --> 03:54:21.240]  So what we're talking about is an infertility heavy metal that's going to be literally dropped
[03:54:21.240 --> 03:54:26.880]  out of the sky by Bill Gates or a Bill Gates funded operation in order to contaminate the
[03:54:26.880 --> 03:54:32.040]  entire food supply with no exceptions, because you can't avoid the air if you're growing
[03:54:32.040 --> 03:54:35.520]  crops, everything falling out of the air is going to fall on your crops.
[03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:40.200]  So you're getting, if you drink water, you're going to get brain damage from the fluoride,
[03:54:40.200 --> 03:54:44.080]  and if you eat food, you're going to get brain damage from the lead.
[03:54:44.080 --> 03:54:49.160]  And this is all on purpose because they have to dumb down the population to such a low
[03:54:49.160 --> 03:54:53.640]  IQ that people can stand to watch CNN.
[03:54:53.640 --> 03:54:59.120]  And you have to really lobotomize people to get somebody to be able to watch CNN without
[03:54:59.120 --> 03:55:01.400]  physically vomiting.
[03:55:01.400 --> 03:55:07.120]  It's so obnoxious to any intelligent person to even attempt to look at someone like Brian
[03:55:07.120 --> 03:55:11.920]  Stelter, make some kind of an argument, or gosh, how do you get a population to vote
[03:55:11.920 --> 03:55:19.600]  for Joe Biden who can't even remember the name of the president under which he served?
[03:55:19.600 --> 03:55:24.160]  Coming soon, Joe Biden won't even be able to remember his name as Joe or how to spell
[03:55:24.160 --> 03:55:26.480]  it, or how many letters are in the name Joe.
[03:55:26.480 --> 03:55:28.600]  I mean, he's gone.
[03:55:28.600 --> 03:55:30.480]  His neurology is gone.
[03:55:30.480 --> 03:55:32.920]  Of course, he had brain tumors and so on.
[03:55:32.920 --> 03:55:35.880]  I feel sorry for the fact that he's had this damage.
[03:55:35.880 --> 03:55:40.120]  I don't wish suffering upon anyone, but he certainly, he doesn't have the neurology to
[03:55:40.120 --> 03:55:41.120]  run the country.
[03:55:41.120 --> 03:55:44.080]  But how do you get a population to vote for him?
[03:55:44.080 --> 03:55:48.760]  You brain damage him, and you do it through the deliberate mass poisoning of the food
[03:55:48.760 --> 03:55:49.960]  supply.
[03:55:49.960 --> 03:55:56.240]  So it's the fluoride, it's the lead, and it's also the toxic chemicals that are deliberately
[03:55:56.240 --> 03:56:02.640]  added to the food supply, which include, by the way, atrazine, a chemical hormone disruptor.
[03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:05.640]  It's known as a castration chemical.
[03:56:05.640 --> 03:56:11.360]  You've got atrazine, you've got glyphosate, you've got estrogen mimickers, estrogen disruptors.
[03:56:11.360 --> 03:56:16.680]  You've got chemicals like astrazine that actually do turn the frogs gay.
[03:56:16.680 --> 03:56:24.680]  They actually literally cause distortions in the endocrine system that are related to
[03:56:24.680 --> 03:56:27.560]  gender expression in both amphibians and humans.
[03:56:27.560 --> 03:56:29.480]  It's a scientific fact.
[03:56:29.480 --> 03:56:36.680]  So this is a deliberate mass poisoning of our planet so that Democrats can win because
[03:56:36.680 --> 03:56:41.600]  the population is dumbed down enough to actually support Democrat policies that do not work.
[03:56:41.600 --> 03:56:50.600]  So the real, quote, utopia of a Democrat-run world is a world of literally crapping retarded
[03:56:50.600 --> 03:56:56.800]  zombies shooting up drugs, running around trying to recruit all the autistic kids to
[03:56:56.800 --> 03:57:04.800]  be transgenders so they can have their drag queen transgender drug addiction, PC story
[03:57:04.800 --> 03:57:08.680]  hour, and then saying that it's all the fault of Trump.
[03:57:08.680 --> 03:57:16.320]  I mean, the utopia of Democrats is a crap whole world, a dystopian collapsed destitute
[03:57:16.320 --> 03:57:23.560]  society of mass mental retardation, of neurological damage, of cancer, mass contamination of the
[03:57:23.560 --> 03:57:25.060]  food supply.
[03:57:25.060 --> 03:57:29.000]  That's the hell that they will bring you if you vote for Democrats ever again.
[03:57:29.000 --> 03:57:30.000]  Think about that.
[03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:32.000]  It's all true.
[03:57:32.000 --> 03:57:34.600]  Well, that's a wrap for today.
[03:57:34.600 --> 03:57:36.440]  Stay tuned for Owen Schreuer coming up next.
[03:57:36.440 --> 03:57:37.440]  Thanks for watching.
[03:57:37.440 --> 03:57:39.360]  Mike Adams here for InfoWars.
[03:57:39.360 --> 03:58:07.720]  Until next week, take care.
