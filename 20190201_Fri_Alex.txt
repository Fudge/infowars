[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:31.000 --> 00:40.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a world exclusive with Roger Stone coming up at the start of the next segment. He's on the line right now.
[00:41.000 --> 00:56.000]  In fact, we have the world exclusive, his response to Mueller putting out a request for a star chamber where the trial will be secret so that the public can't see how kangaroo it is.
[00:56.000 --> 01:06.000]  According to many people's concerns, this judge has been very kangaroo-ish before, giving Mueller whatever he wants, gagging people, not letting them defend themselves, not letting them even raise money for their defense.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  I mean, we're talking Soviet level type stuff. That was going to be big news and he's going to cover it at the start of the next segment.
[01:14.000 --> 01:21.000]  But you'll definitely have a Don or somebody email Drudge who's been very gracious. This is big news to pick up the last two exclusive interviews with Roger.
[01:21.000 --> 01:31.000]  This could be his last interview before going in at two o'clock today, Eastern where he may be gagged. Yes, it's un-American. Yes, it's unprecedented, but it's what this judge has been doing.
[01:32.000 --> 01:41.000]  And Info Wars will fight it. Let me also announce we're going to follow a lawsuit if they try to keep the press out. The press always follows lawsuits when things like this happen.
[01:42.000 --> 01:49.000]  They're usually successful. Don't count this time. The press is the murderer of truth now, the mainstream press. They want the news shut down.
[01:49.000 --> 01:58.000]  Well, Roger just learned from his lawyers and just learned from security cameras and just confirmed is going to be a world exclusive.
[01:59.000 --> 02:07.000]  In fact, I know the crew is in there watching and listening right now, but we probably need to go ahead and change the headline on InfoWars.com.
[02:07.000 --> 02:18.000]  Also, guys, please print me the New York Times article with the president praises Roger Stone. That's one thing I forgot to get here in my stack.
[02:19.000 --> 02:29.000]  So a lot of times I'm so busy before you get on air. This first five minutes is kind of us organizing things. You're watching how the sausage is getting made because things are breaking up to the minute.
[02:29.000 --> 02:43.000]  But when we come back, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone has the proof that CNN broke the law and that CNN was specifically told by the FBI to be there and that they shut up 30 minutes before
[02:43.000 --> 02:58.000]  pointing their cameras right at his door in a another example of how they are nothing but a propaganda bureau of the deep state and the globalist and any other foreign government like the Chinese or Qatar or Saudi Arabia that pay them money.
[02:58.000 --> 03:20.000]  So that is all coming up as well after this quick break in other news today. The New York Times is reporting on award-winning journalist and witnesses admitting to spreading HIV and so-called inoculations to Africans as part of a bio weapons program.
[03:20.000 --> 03:36.000]  And guess the name of the CIA operative who admits to it. Alexander Jones, no relation to me. Truth is stranger than fiction. CIA back mercenaries spread HIV in South Africa X member claims.
[03:36.000 --> 03:50.000]  So that is all coming up. Of course, that's what my dad always told me that HIV was actually introduced in the 60s. It's very specific for Africans. It can kill others, but it's more deadly in blacks, obviously, easier to spread.
[03:50.000 --> 04:05.000]  Whites don't even have the receptor sites on their T lymphocytes to take in the virus. But basically a black person just it's touched by an HIV virus. It's bye bye. It's terrible, but you're not going to hear any black leaders warning you about that.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  They want to make sure you get aborted forever before you ever get out of your mommy. So we're going over all that.
[04:11.000 --> 04:35.000]  So that is all coming up as well. And then there's those type of stories that catch everybody's attention. There's those type of stories that really crystallize things and really allow people to understand what's going on and what's happening.
[04:35.000 --> 04:54.000]  And that's one of these right here. We're going to get to after Roger leaves this where over the different security cameras and Amazon systems, hackers are trying to kill people's babies, burn people's houses down and talk at smack to their husbands and wives.
[04:54.000 --> 05:05.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  We'll be on the go.
[05:54.000 --> 06:00.000]  We'll be on the go.
[06:24.000 --> 06:38.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[06:38.040 --> 07:01.120]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones ladies and
[07:01.120 --> 07:04.600]  gentlemen Alex Jones here thank you so much for joining us on this Friday
[07:04.600 --> 07:10.360]  February 1st 2019 global broadcast and we're joined by Roger Stone exclusively
[07:10.360 --> 07:15.160]  he's not talking any other media today because they fear that he may be gagged
[07:15.160 --> 07:19.280]  by this same judge that magically is getting all the Mueller cases and who
[07:19.280 --> 07:25.680]  has gagged other individuals and then also not allowed them to fundraise a new
[07:25.680 --> 07:32.000]  level of draconian oppression so Roger has not been unable to have press
[07:32.000 --> 07:38.040]  conferences Roger has been unable to go out in public because he gets physically
[07:38.040 --> 07:42.440]  attacked and shouted down so this is the place here at info wars where he is
[07:42.440 --> 07:46.760]  able to do that and we'll be doing that now Mueller's also announced a protective
[07:46.760 --> 07:51.480]  order that turns the court into a star chamber so that no media can be there and
[07:51.480 --> 07:56.640]  so only Mueller his people can leak out whatever disinformation they want so
[07:56.640 --> 08:00.040]  that's a tactic they've been using now that was going to be the big exclusive
[08:00.040 --> 08:04.960]  news and we're going to get into that with Roger here in the next segment but
[08:04.960 --> 08:08.160]  right now ladies and gentlemen the huge exclusive that's going to get them in
[08:08.160 --> 08:12.640]  hot water is what Roger Stone is about to break down concerning CNN being tipped
[08:12.640 --> 08:19.200]  off to that raid and then caught lying about it that is a felony for the FBI to
[08:19.200 --> 08:22.640]  have leaked that to the media also it shows that the raid was not needed if
[08:22.640 --> 08:26.880]  Stone's so deadly why would they let CNN be there why would they then shut the
[08:26.880 --> 08:33.440]  street down around CNN allowing them to be there this is unbelievable breaking
[08:33.440 --> 08:40.480]  huge news right now ladies and gentlemen absolutely huge news and Roger's
[08:40.480 --> 08:43.720]  going to give you the specifics and how he learned it and how bombshell this is
[08:43.720 --> 08:50.600]  literally hours before he could be judicially silenced so that he can be
[08:50.600 --> 08:56.320]  the sacrificial goat in this whole fake Russia gate witch hunt now turned into
[08:56.320 --> 09:01.640]  literal inquisition Roger Stone thank you for joining us Alex thank you very
[09:01.640 --> 09:08.680]  much first of all I want to thank the point I think millions of people who are
[09:08.680 --> 09:14.640]  praying for me because God is powerful and God is my protector and I feel your
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.920]  prayers and I appreciate your prayers I also want to think Alex Jim is an
[09:19.920 --> 09:23.760]  info wars for providing the infrastructure so I could do a press
[09:23.760 --> 09:28.720]  availability yesterday because I couldn't speak coming out of the
[09:28.720 --> 09:35.960]  courthouse which was literally a tsunami a torrent of hate pushing shoving
[09:35.960 --> 09:42.320]  screaming spitting pounding on my car trying to rock my car I felt like Vice
[09:42.320 --> 09:50.640]  President Richard Nixon in Caracas in 1958 crazed leftists assaulting my
[09:50.640 --> 09:54.840]  supporters who were there including several African-American ministers who
[09:54.840 --> 10:02.040]  are friends of mine who were literally assaulted by crazed leftists it was it
[10:02.040 --> 10:07.400]  was chilling and I pray for God's protection today as I go to the
[10:07.400 --> 10:14.240]  courthouse because you know the death threats have now reached a crescendo and
[10:14.240 --> 10:20.920]  I don't want to you know I don't want to be injured or killed in my attempts to
[10:20.920 --> 10:26.760]  adhere to the orders of the court the judge has ordered my presence today for
[10:26.760 --> 10:34.320]  a status conference we had asked that I not have to attend because this is
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.760]  really just the lawyers wrangling the Mueller team did not object to my not
[10:38.760 --> 10:44.400]  attending but the judge ordered my attendance anyway which is her right
[10:44.400 --> 10:49.000]  we don't know whether there will be a gag order issue today the government has
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.520]  not asked for one at least not yet but the judge again has that authority and I
[10:53.520 --> 10:59.080]  would have to adhere to the order of the court and I will subject obviously to
[10:59.080 --> 11:04.960]  appeal but they also entered a protective order I don't know all of the
[11:04.960 --> 11:09.520]  aspects of that and I really cannot discuss it but it it does as I
[11:09.520 --> 11:17.760]  understand it keep the three terabytes as the media has reported of data that
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.640]  they turned over of confidential this of course proves what I have said for two
[11:22.640 --> 11:28.400]  years that my emails text message and phone calls have been entirely monitored
[11:28.400 --> 11:36.240]  and collected no answer as to whether that was also true in 2016 as reported
[11:36.240 --> 11:41.080]  by the New York Times when I believe I was subject to government surveillance
[11:41.080 --> 11:47.320]  during Donald Trump's presidential campaign Alex one of my neighbors has
[11:47.320 --> 11:53.440]  now signed an affidavit because they were walking their dog and they saw the
[11:53.440 --> 11:59.760]  CNN truck pull up and position itself across from my house just 30 minutes
[11:59.760 --> 12:05.320]  before the FBI strike force arrived so the idea that I was staked out on a
[12:05.320 --> 12:11.640]  hunch is disproved senator Lindsey Graham is now actively looking into
[12:11.640 --> 12:17.640]  precisely what CNN knew and when it knew it as are a valued group of House
[12:17.640 --> 12:22.920]  Republicans I believe there's additional evidence that will prove CNN was
[12:22.920 --> 12:29.640]  tipped off so definitively that the producer on the ground with the CNN
[12:29.640 --> 12:36.080]  crew is a former special assistant to FBI director James Comey and a former FBI
[12:36.080 --> 12:42.880]  employee if I'm dangerous which was the presumption of the raid even though I
[12:42.880 --> 12:48.960]  did not have a firearm in the house and it did not have a valid passport so I
[12:48.960 --> 12:53.800]  couldn't get very far if I were a flight risk which I am not thanks to CNN and
[12:53.800 --> 12:59.120]  MSNBC I probably have one of the most recognizable faces on the face of the
[12:59.120 --> 13:05.720]  planet why was CNN put in harm's way why were they allowed to be 25 feet from my
[13:05.720 --> 13:11.440]  door well Roger I think let's expand on this this is really scandalous it's
[13:11.440 --> 13:16.200]  it's it's it's sensationally corrupt obviously I've talked to you about this
[13:16.200 --> 13:22.160]  there's hardly ever before CNN staked out at the house magically the morning it
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.240]  happens 30 minutes before this guy shows up sets up they block off both sides of
[13:27.240 --> 13:32.520]  the street walk off the canal and then let the CNN reporter sit right there I
[13:32.520 --> 13:36.960]  can tell you with a situation like this if the police were doing this the first
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.400]  thing they do is come up to a reporter and quietly say get the hell out of here
[13:41.400 --> 13:45.760]  and lead him off to the point where's your vehicle get in it leave that's what
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.240]  they would do they would not just suddenly have him there 20 feet behind
[13:49.240 --> 13:55.360]  them supposedly going into El Chapo's lair with 29 people with their assault
[13:55.360 --> 13:59.640]  rifles it's it the whole thing was obviously false from the beginning is
[13:59.640 --> 14:04.040]  fake news but as Lindsey Graham and others have pointed out it's illegal for
[14:04.040 --> 14:07.280]  the FBI to leak this to the press it's illegal to bring them on this type of
[14:07.280 --> 14:12.560]  quote felony raid and then they lied to the public the FBI said that they did
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.320]  not get them oh wait some of the Justice Department did you know that was
[14:16.320 --> 14:21.800]  placed in manical games this is really a scandal well and I trust the senator
[14:21.800 --> 14:24.720]  Graham to get to the bottom of it I think there's a great deal more we're
[14:24.720 --> 14:30.680]  going to learn about this setup the obvious reason why they wanted CNN to
[14:30.680 --> 14:36.520]  film this is to make me look like public enemy number one to paint the jury pool
[14:36.520 --> 14:41.320]  and make it appear that I'm guilty before I have a need to have a chance to go
[14:41.320 --> 14:46.440]  to trial I mean these are police state tactics as the Libertarian Party of
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.920]  Florida said today police state denies using police state tactics in police
[14:51.920 --> 14:57.840]  state raid on Stone's home it's really you know it's something I hate to say
[14:57.840 --> 15:04.600]  you would see in Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany the idea that I'm dangerous I'm
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.320]  politically dangerous perhaps I'm dangerous with a pen and a microphone
[15:08.320 --> 15:13.360]  but I am not physically dangerous and I've been under investigation for two
[15:13.360 --> 15:18.200]  years they have an enormous amount of data of seizing all my electronic
[15:18.200 --> 15:22.680]  equipment it was not going to get them anything that they don't already have
[15:22.680 --> 15:29.120]  that this is more of the show in order obviously to pressure me into pleading
[15:29.120 --> 15:35.080]  guilty which I don't intend to do I entered a not guilty plea as you know I
[15:35.080 --> 15:40.800]  have to literally beg people to go to stone defense fund calm stone defense

[21:45.320 --> 21:48.480]  today Roger about you know I've got your wife's contact your daughter your son
[21:48.480 --> 21:52.000]  who's well-spoken sheriff's deputy we need to be able to get them ready your
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.920]  spokespersons as well they're not going to stop you one way or the other I'm
[21:54.920 --> 21:58.280]  going to follow lawsuit obviously over the star chamber proceedings if the
[21:58.280 --> 22:01.720]  judge grants that say it's going to be a secret court I mean this is really
[22:01.720 --> 22:05.760]  just a astonishing astounding word you like to use this really is epic
[22:05.760 --> 22:11.000]  un-American garbage so just recap the star chamber the latest though that you
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.280]  can tell people about CNN caught red-handed staging this with the FBI
[22:15.280 --> 22:22.880]  just incredible jack boot theater well you know CNN continues to maintain the
[22:22.880 --> 22:27.280]  fiction that they were just operating on a hunch that they just happened to be
[22:27.280 --> 22:33.280]  there and that a producer just happened to fly from Washington DC to Fort
[22:33.280 --> 22:38.600]  Lauderdale to bring a full trucking crew to my house arriving only 30 minutes
[22:38.600 --> 22:44.920]  before the FBI strike force if anybody believes that I have a bridge in
[22:44.920 --> 22:50.200]  Brooklyn I want to talk to you about selling it is it just blows the mind
[22:50.200 --> 22:55.960]  but we see the purpose of it it was to humiliate me publicly to pressure me
[22:55.960 --> 23:00.480]  and depleting guilty to something I didn't do I was very gratified to see
[23:00.480 --> 23:05.120]  the president's quote about me in today's New York Times where he said he's
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.880]  always like me I'm a character and then a lot of people respect what I've said
[23:09.880 --> 23:14.240]  about not bearing false witness against him because Alex I'm not going to make
[23:14.240 --> 23:19.840]  up lies about the president I'm not going to to as I say bear false witness
[23:19.840 --> 23:25.000]  against him as I think others have done just because I am in this politically
[23:25.000 --> 23:32.160]  created mind I am not knowledgeable enough to know what will happen in court
[23:32.160 --> 23:37.800]  today I would obviously adhere to the orders of the court subject to my
[23:37.800 --> 23:44.600]  lawyers recommendations as to how we go forward the government has not asked for
[23:44.600 --> 23:50.160]  a gag but that doesn't mean the judge won't gag me she has that right but we
[23:50.160 --> 23:53.720]  also have the right of appeal obviously at least the right to be heard on the
[23:53.720 --> 23:59.400]  question I approach this you know soberly on the other hand my greatest
[23:59.400 --> 24:06.080]  concern is that is for my personal safety the safety of my family I can't
[24:06.080 --> 24:14.920]  even imagine you cannot even imagine the raw hate that we saw outside that
[24:14.920 --> 24:20.800]  courthouse I've just never been 50 years in American politics I've never
[24:20.800 --> 24:27.080]  experienced anything like that and therefore I asked for people's prayers
[24:27.080 --> 24:30.600]  today that's right and Roger this is where I wanted to segue in and I ask
[24:30.600 --> 24:33.280]  you to wait till the end of the interview because I wanted to raise this
[24:33.280 --> 24:36.760]  with you and I want to explain something Roger's a tough guy I'm a tough guy
[24:36.760 --> 24:42.600]  we're both under the same crosshairs because they want to shut us down as the
[24:42.600 --> 24:46.960]  precedent for everyone else I'll be covering that and some documents that
[24:46.960 --> 24:50.680]  have come out next segment with Paul Joseph Watson she has to understand our
[24:50.680 --> 24:59.480]  our travails our our dire straits were in by choice is a microcosm of the
[24:59.480 --> 25:04.560]  country and these hellish evil bullies and governors saying I don't apologize
[25:04.560 --> 25:08.920]  saying we keep babies alive and sell their organs you know he's doubled down
[25:08.920 --> 25:13.480]  or Bill Maher promoting pedophilia between 12 year old children and 35 year
[25:13.480 --> 25:18.240]  old adults saying it's love they're coming out of the closet the evil of the
[25:18.240 --> 25:25.160]  globalist are being spilled out into the land against us and so the fact that
[25:25.160 --> 25:29.280]  they try to create a star chamber and not let the media in so they can only
[25:29.280 --> 25:34.880]  leak out this info because their case is so piss fake piss thin paper thin the
[25:34.880 --> 25:39.040]  fact that they've got all these globalist groups shooing us and demonizing us
[25:39.040 --> 25:42.520]  and taking our sponsors and the platforming us everywhere and when I go
[25:42.520 --> 25:45.360]  out on the street people either love me which is great most of them see through
[25:45.360 --> 25:49.440]  it or they physically want to come after me because they the globalists have
[25:49.440 --> 25:55.200]  whipped the public up into this insane hateful mob and then Jim Acosta comes
[25:55.200 --> 25:59.280]  out and says Trump's gonna cause terror attacks on the media no you guys are
[25:59.280 --> 26:02.760]  gearing up false flags against yourselves when you make the move on the
[26:02.760 --> 26:07.440]  president to try to cause a civil war in this nation it's in the WikiLeaks they
[26:07.440 --> 26:11.760]  admit it's their plan these people are clear and present danger electing a
[26:11.760 --> 26:16.480]  bunch of crazed Muslims to Congress that are calling for Sharia law they're
[26:16.480 --> 26:19.600]  already shutting down swimming pools all over the country for whole days out of
[26:19.600 --> 26:23.760]  the week so Muslims can use it Sharia laws coming into the schools and the
[26:23.760 --> 26:27.480]  launch programs it's here we're being drugged through the mud
[26:27.480 --> 26:32.000]  Europe's being drugged through the mud the Islamists are calling for 90% taxes
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.040]  on the rich which the rich are offshore they're the ones lobbying for it this is
[26:37.040 --> 26:42.120]  a criminal takeover and they don't want Roger and I and others to be victorious
[26:42.120 --> 26:47.080]  folk heroes that got Trump in they want to destroy us and demonize us and if
[26:47.080 --> 26:52.920]  they can we'll then be used our shrunken heads stuck on pikes as enemy
[26:52.920 --> 26:58.520]  standards in their army so that's why this is like a famous battle that we've
[26:58.520 --> 27:04.400]  got to win like Trenton or the battles in Russia in places like Stalingrad
[27:04.400 --> 27:10.160]  okay we have to win this battle this is where the line has to be held ladies
[27:10.160 --> 27:14.240]  and gentlemen and the enemy knows it that's why all I have to say to you is
[27:14.240 --> 27:18.920]  we need your financial support info wars has a hundred crew members we're in the
[27:18.920 --> 27:22.360]  face still reaching hundreds of millions of people we had videos this is the last
[27:22.360 --> 27:26.240]  week that reached 30 40 million people that the enemy couldn't stop and they're
[27:26.240 --> 27:29.840]  around the clock trying to stop us and we need you to go to info wars store.com

[28:10.840 --> 28:15.280]  the enemy made it but infowarstore.com is so critical that we have one of these
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.400]  last places where we can have a real press conference or put the truth out

[31:54.720 --> 32:00.000]  they're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb I want life I want Jesus the
[32:00.000 --> 32:03.560]  globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[32:03.560 --> 32:07.120]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it
[32:07.120 --> 32:13.000]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to
[32:13.000 --> 32:17.320]  bring our listeners and viewers the best idea in the world we've gone through two
[32:17.320 --> 32:22.240]  permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[32:22.240 --> 32:25.840]  and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[32:25.840 --> 32:30.200]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been
[32:30.200 --> 32:34.640]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research
[32:34.640 --> 32:39.760]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists
[32:39.760 --> 32:43.280]  scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[32:43.280 --> 32:49.120]  other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes
[32:49.120 --> 32:54.240]  it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you
[32:54.240 --> 32:58.760]  want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4's
[32:58.760 --> 33:01.240]  live.com
[33:01.240 --> 33:25.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show you're listening to an info wars.com
[33:25.080 --> 33:30.920]  frontline report it's Alex Jones now Paul Joseph Watson and Mark Dice
[33:30.920 --> 33:35.600]  are onto something really big and really important that could stop the
[33:35.600 --> 33:39.480]  censorship if the public figures out what's actually happening because now
[33:39.480 --> 33:44.120]  they're going after main line popular people who they want to muscle under
[33:44.120 --> 33:47.960]  their control and this is the model that the Wall Street Journal ten months ago
[33:47.960 --> 33:52.200]  two months before my de-platforming admitted they said first we're getting
[33:52.200 --> 33:56.800]  Jones then we're getting everybody because they knew that most people would
[33:56.800 --> 34:04.280]  say oh let him get Jones and then oh let him get Franklin Graham and let him
[34:04.280 --> 34:08.480]  get Stephen Crowder and the seat and then it'll be everybody let him get Gab
[34:08.480 --> 34:13.680]  McGinnis it's here folks the total takeover plan so Paul Watson joins us
[34:13.680 --> 34:17.720]  coming up here in about two minutes but I wanted a whole Roger over because this
[34:17.720 --> 34:22.200]  could be one of the last times we had to talk to Roger if this judge that's gagged
[34:22.200 --> 34:26.440]  other people does indeed gag him today at about two o'clock and just finishing
[34:26.440 --> 34:30.080]  up absolutely folks you have to understand it's a statement of free speech
[34:30.080 --> 34:35.160]  like Laura Ingraham said to where make America great again hat we have make
[34:35.160 --> 34:39.480]  America free again red hats at info or store.com it is a statement to where
[34:39.480 --> 34:43.760]  info wars.com verboten information or to get a Roger Stone did nothing wrong
[34:43.760 --> 34:49.720]  shirt at his site stone cold truth.com and again we are figureheads in the fight
[34:49.720 --> 34:55.200]  against this and I'm literally in your hands literally in your hands I want to
[34:55.200 --> 34:59.320]  thank you all I want to let you know I really appreciate everything that you've
[34:59.320 --> 35:03.240]  done but just to understand that info wars as the mother ship really needs
[35:03.240 --> 35:08.720]  your support now more than ever but going back just for closing comments from
[35:08.720 --> 35:11.360]  Roger Stone about any other points you'd like to make before you're
[35:11.360 --> 35:16.800]  potentially gagged and before the court becomes a star chamber. Well Alex I was
[35:16.800 --> 35:20.800]  actually wearing the Roger Stone did nothing wrong t-shirt when I was
[35:20.800 --> 35:26.000]  arrested because I was sleeping it in it and a pair of cut-off sweatshorts the
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.680]  FBI allowed me to change my shirt and put on a pair of long pants and pair of
[35:30.680 --> 35:35.720]  shoes they did take my St. Michael's medal off of me I pray to St. Michael
[35:35.720 --> 35:40.360]  every day and I wasn't allowed to have shoes with shoelaces or a belt of
[35:40.360 --> 35:45.560]  course but I appreciate everything you and the info wars community have done
[35:45.560 --> 35:52.320]  for me I intend to fight to the bitter end I I smell victory I believe I will
[35:52.320 --> 35:56.880]  be exonerated I won't be vindicated I'm very proud of the president's support
[35:56.880 --> 36:02.720]  today and we'll call in after court today and of course the war room later
[36:02.720 --> 36:08.000]  today to keep you up to date it up to date on what the latest is assuming I am
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.440]  not gagged and if I am gagged I think my daughter will probably be calling into
[36:13.440 --> 36:16.720]  the war room to say a few words
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.080]  Roger Godspeed and God bless we'll be praying for you many thanks Alex all
[36:22.080 --> 36:27.760]  right we're going to introduce this piece with Paul Watson live joining us
[36:27.760 --> 36:33.440]  with a clip from Mark Dice's video that's posted in full on news wars.com
[36:33.440 --> 36:38.400]  and info wars.com an article titled YouTube broke its own search engine to
[36:38.400 --> 36:42.960]  rig the algorithm for the corporate media now I don't know where to begin with
[36:42.960 --> 36:48.560]  this Sundar Pachai the CEO lying a few months ago to Congress when I was
[36:48.560 --> 36:52.680]  sitting three rows behind him there was something about being there and him
[36:52.680 --> 36:56.840]  saying we've never rigged a search result we've never tailored them for
[36:56.840 --> 37:02.800]  anybody we don't control anything you pay them with advertisement to control
[37:02.800 --> 37:05.880]  results that's their business now they're just doing it with news and
[37:05.880 --> 37:10.400]  information and there's all the Hillary emails of them controlling what was in
[37:10.400 --> 37:14.560]  the search results and burying stuff in the campaign it's in the WikiLeaks you
[37:14.560 --> 37:19.240]  got Eric Schmidt admitting it a decade ago and two years ago that they do it so
[37:19.240 --> 37:26.640]  the level now of of perjury on serious issues is stratospheric it's it's it's
[37:26.640 --> 37:33.920]  out of this world but then I see people like this DeFranco guy criticize me put
[37:33.920 --> 37:38.560]  me down on YouTube routinely going with the talking point of how I'm a bad guy
[37:38.560 --> 37:42.640]  and I'm not against this guy I've seen some of his pieces that are good he's
[37:42.640 --> 37:46.600]  a well-spoken fellow he's got hundreds of millions you know of viewers overall
[37:46.600 --> 37:51.840]  billions of years and he does reviews for other people but what what YouTube and
[37:51.840 --> 37:54.320]  Google wanted to do they told the Wall Street Journal ten months ago as they
[37:54.320 --> 37:57.480]  were just going to start going in all the private popular channels and
[37:57.480 --> 38:02.040]  muscling them under their control to pay them less or just get rid of them
[38:02.040 --> 38:07.080]  entirely with demonetization like PewDiePie and that's what this is is the
[38:07.080 --> 38:11.640]  old Hollywood guard was like the old record company guard muscling in to
[38:11.640 --> 38:16.440]  take over all thought but they start with somebody they demonize like myself
[38:16.440 --> 38:21.120]  they put out a bunch of straw man they removed me off air and then people don't
[38:21.120 --> 38:27.880]  stand up so then the president said and so I see people now being criticized and
[38:27.880 --> 38:33.800]  even shout out for Paul where PewDiePie shouts out Paul or myself then oh my god
[38:33.800 --> 38:37.120]  take him off you know he's supporting these evil people this is total thought
[38:37.120 --> 38:40.600]  control with these brigades running around doing this and then having them
[38:40.600 --> 38:45.560]  deny you can put in the exact headline for videos Paul does or other people do
[38:45.560 --> 38:51.040]  or even our articles and they won't come up they're being blocked the engine is
[38:51.040 --> 38:56.440]  rigged and it's not just us now suddenly if you won't pay Google whatever they
[38:56.440 --> 38:59.840]  want for your car dealership or your restaurant they won't even list you now
[38:59.840 --> 39:04.440]  forget that you're 20 pages deep so they are abusing the fact that they have
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.040]  90 plus percent of searches in control it's beyond monopoly and it's got to be
[39:08.040 --> 39:12.200]  dealt with but Congress sits there with their thumbs you know where either
[39:12.200 --> 39:17.440]  paid off by these people or completely and totally ignorant so let's play this
[39:17.440 --> 39:21.160]  Mark Dice clip and go to Paul Joseph Watson here's Mark Dice and speaking of
[39:21.160 --> 39:25.360]  YouTube manipulating the search results if you type in the exact title of one of
[39:25.360 --> 39:31.080]  my most popular videos celebrities react to Hillary Clinton losing election a
[39:31.080 --> 39:37.720]  video which has over 6 million views it's nowhere to be found instead you get
[39:37.720 --> 39:44.280]  results from places like entertainment tonight for their video 61,000 views or
[39:44.280 --> 39:50.920]  business insider with 70,000 views CNN with 67,000 views Wall Street Journal
[39:50.920 --> 39:59.120]  Inside Edition CBS ABC my video has more views than all of these videos combined
[39:59.120 --> 40:06.720]  but it still is nowhere to be found oh where oh where could my YouTube video be
[40:06.720 --> 40:12.760]  how many pages have you buried it so people can't see let's try another one
[40:12.760 --> 40:15.960]  of my popular videos which has almost 2 million views
[40:15.960 --> 40:21.040]  Michelle Obama trashes Hillary Clinton oh look the top search result is from
[40:21.040 --> 40:27.640]  Hillary's YouTube channel NBC News ABC Inside Edition where's my video wow CBS
[40:27.640 --> 40:33.200]  News this video about Michelle Obama's 23,000 views definitely deserves to be
[40:33.200 --> 40:40.440]  ranked above mine maybe it's on page two nope don't see it there either how about
[40:40.440 --> 40:48.480]  page three nope not there either oh here it is on page four buried under such
[40:48.480 --> 40:57.480]  popular videos like this one from KG UN channel nine with 750 views last show
[40:57.480 --> 41:00.720]  the alliance has been made we've got undercover video showing it with big tech
[41:00.720 --> 41:04.840]  and old dying media to shed everybody else down so they can then lie about us
[41:04.840 --> 41:08.680]  and then put us in prison it's also happening in Europe remember he said
[41:08.680 --> 41:11.920]  on a hot mic Zuckerberg two years ago don't worry I'll start censoring all
[41:11.920 --> 41:15.240]  Germans that criticize you and he did Paul you'll be with us for two more
[41:15.240 --> 41:20.000]  segments thanks for joining us tell us what the hell's going on here well this
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.880]  is important Alex people need to realize how important this is YouTube is the
[41:23.880 --> 41:28.320]  second biggest search engine in the world is owned by Google okay Google gets
[41:28.320 --> 41:33.800]  criticism for potentially building a censored search engine in China that
[41:33.800 --> 41:38.560]  will digitally disappear political dissidents yet they're already doing it
[41:38.560 --> 41:43.960]  in the United States and nobody bats an eyelid it's already happening okay we've
[41:43.960 --> 41:49.760]  had studies by Robert Epstein that show algorithmic changes in search results
[41:49.760 --> 41:55.040]  can shift millions of votes up to 12 million votes in elections he said it
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.440]  personally shifted two to three million votes in Hillary Clinton's favor just
[41:59.440 --> 42:04.560]  with ranking certain search results above others exactly as he saw right
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.680]  there in that marked ice clip so then the new aspect of this which we can delve
[42:08.680 --> 42:13.480]  into more after the break is YouTube caving in within hours to a buzzfeed
[42:13.480 --> 42:19.880]  article that wind and complained about quote conspiracy theory videos appearing
[42:19.880 --> 42:24.480]  in recommended videos on YouTube so within hours they vowed to change their
[42:24.480 --> 42:29.040]  algorithm again and then you check what they consider to be conspiracy theory
[42:29.040 --> 42:33.680]  content and it's like mainstream immigration groups it's Dinesh De Souza
[42:33.680 --> 42:39.840]  Prager you Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson this is not about you know
[42:39.840 --> 42:44.000]  tamping down on conspiracy theories again it's about censoring that political
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.960]  opposition and of course they're they're moving towards the next level
[42:47.960 --> 42:51.920]  censoring the left as well this is a total and complete information control
[42:51.920 --> 42:56.600]  and once these black holes start like in Eastern Europe under the Soviets there's
[42:56.600 --> 43:03.360]  no end to it total censorship when it comes to rebuilding your energy

[47:50.360 --> 47:55.320]  millions of subscribers billions of views and they're making millions of
[47:55.320 --> 48:03.680]  dollars but YouTube is making billions of dollars and instead of YouTube and the
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.640]  whole Hollywood crowd and big tech coming in and treating people respect
[48:07.640 --> 48:12.320]  they're coming into muscle and take over everything with what Paul Watson just
[48:12.320 --> 48:17.320]  broke down Google's in big trouble YouTube's parent company alphabet its
[48:17.320 --> 48:23.680]  parent company for running tests for censorship in China with Operation
[48:23.680 --> 48:27.760]  Dragonfly which they should be helping the authoritarian regime oppressed but
[48:27.760 --> 48:31.640]  here YouTube and Google are in the wiki leaks already doing stuff like that and
[48:31.640 --> 48:36.520]  now years later they are blocking everybody who isn't establishment if
[48:36.520 --> 48:40.200]  you're a big corporate establishment group you get put in a list this is
[48:40.200 --> 48:45.840]  racketeering that you are favored and you were promoted to the top it started
[48:45.840 --> 48:51.480]  when Hillary lost it's been I'd say perfected I mean it's it's like total
[48:51.480 --> 48:58.280]  now in the last six months and it's getting more and more intense where we
[48:58.280 --> 49:02.520]  can put a video up on a YouTube page as a test and it gets 10,000 views on our
[49:02.520 --> 49:07.600]  page and we can look because we had Google Analytics still it's getting zero
[49:07.600 --> 49:14.560]  on YouTube all of its watched on our platform using their bandwidth but
[49:14.560 --> 49:20.080]  understand no one else can see it no one is promoting it or sharing it on
[49:20.080 --> 49:27.440]  YouTube it is locked in purgatory it's locked in a phantom zone you know where
[49:27.440 --> 49:30.840]  they send general Zod and then I start talking to other people business owners
[49:30.840 --> 49:35.720]  and others that own nurseries and others they said yeah the last year my
[49:35.720 --> 49:38.800]  nursery videos used to get a hundred thousand views or so how to plant this
[49:38.800 --> 49:44.440]  how to do that now they get 10,000 views and none of it gets shared and they
[49:44.440 --> 49:50.040]  used to have a bunch of mail order stuff and now that's all gone suddenly so you
[49:50.040 --> 49:54.520]  built YouTube folks and now they've rolled up the carpet and are exploiting
[49:54.520 --> 49:57.840]  it just like Facebook and it's criminal back to Paul Joseph Watson with this
[49:57.840 --> 50:01.200]  incredible news and some of the controversies that have come out of even
[50:01.200 --> 50:04.960]  some of these YouTube folks giving you a shout out well that gets them demonetized
[50:04.960 --> 50:10.200]  that's how incredible the draconian control has gotten yeah let's not forget
[50:10.200 --> 50:15.320]  Alex the other aspect of this which is still a burgeoning story is Newsgard
[50:15.320 --> 50:20.800]  partnered with Microsoft to designate what is a trusted news source and what
[50:20.800 --> 50:24.720]  isn't even though they were caught the other day giving their little green
[50:24.720 --> 50:31.200]  verified tick on the UVA campus rape hoax remember the 2014 Rolling Stone
[50:31.200 --> 50:37.040]  story which was a proven hoax they've given that story a tick of verification
[50:37.040 --> 50:41.760]  simply because it's in the Huffington Post it's again is a partisan bias
[50:41.760 --> 50:47.160]  organization that is intended to you know manipulate the algorithm for search
[50:47.160 --> 50:51.920]  results so is Google going to partner with Newsgard as well so we've got that
[50:51.920 --> 50:56.080]  going on at the same time and then yeah as he mentioned the big YouTube is one
[50:56.080 --> 51:00.800]  of them Shane Dawson he put out a video called conspiracy theories with Shane
[51:00.800 --> 51:04.920]  Dawson a one hour 45 minute documentary this is a guy with 20 million
[51:04.920 --> 51:09.720]  subscribers tens of millions of views on all his videos he did a big series with
[51:09.720 --> 51:14.960]  Jake Paul a few months back and for the first few hours his video was completely
[51:14.960 --> 51:19.720]  demonetized again probably although they deny it although they also deny Alex
[51:19.720 --> 51:23.920]  that they don't manipulate search results for partisan ends even though they
[51:23.920 --> 51:27.960]  clearly do we've just proven that so they denied that they demonetized his
[51:27.960 --> 51:33.120]  video he lost tens of thousands of dollars and I warned him about it the
[51:33.120 --> 51:37.400]  night before it happened on Twitter you can see the tweet right there said is he
[51:37.400 --> 51:41.360]  going to get punished the next day yes he got punished and he lost tens of
[51:41.360 --> 51:46.800]  thousands of dollars and that of course caused a furor him merely coming back and
[51:46.800 --> 51:51.240]  responding saying that he liked my stuff caused a meltdown from the blue check
[51:51.240 --> 51:55.560]  marks on Twitter so we had that going on but again this was in response to the
[51:55.560 --> 51:59.920]  BuzzFeed story and that's not the first time that a left-wing digital news
[51:59.920 --> 52:04.440]  outlet most of which are obviously collapsing having to sack 15% of their
[52:04.440 --> 52:08.160]  workforce like BuzzFeed because nobody reads them anymore it wasn't the first
[52:08.160 --> 52:14.120]  time it happened Alex back a few weeks ago Slate wrote an article complaining
[52:14.120 --> 52:18.840]  that the top search results on YouTube about abortion were mainly pro-life
[52:18.840 --> 52:24.640]  within hours the search results were changed to be mainly pro-abortion they
[52:24.640 --> 52:30.400]  replaced the pro-life conservative videos with videos from BuzzFeed vice CNN
[52:30.400 --> 52:35.280]  last week tonight with John Oliver and then Breitbart asked them about it and
[52:35.280 --> 52:40.320]  again they denied that they did that although then a leaked chat transcript
[52:40.320 --> 52:44.920]  from within Google Google came out which said quote this was them talking to
[52:44.920 --> 52:48.760]  each other seems like we are pretty eager to cater our search results to the
[52:48.760 --> 52:55.720]  social and political agenda of left-wing journalists so yet again Alex just as
[52:55.720 --> 53:00.160]  they conspired to abuse their platforms to de-platform you they're doing it once
[53:00.160 --> 53:05.240]  again not just with individuals but with news events with search terms and with
[53:05.240 --> 53:08.440]  political issues like abortion and poem by the way
[53:08.440 --> 53:12.360]  well they're only covering their tracks here we have the project Veritas videos
[53:12.360 --> 53:15.560]  we have the documents we have congressional hearings knowing back
[53:15.560 --> 53:19.640]  about three years ago they began to coordinate top media with big tech to
[53:19.640 --> 53:23.280]  control manipulate and then they expanded it down even to mid-level
[53:23.280 --> 53:28.560]  employees and now trusted flaggers like Joe Rogan's people are given YouTube
[53:28.560 --> 53:33.760]  level access to the accounts the systems to everything and then they can go in
[53:33.760 --> 53:37.040]  and literally like the young Turks did us that time and just delete whole
[53:37.040 --> 53:40.680]  channels if they want to so they're giving their political leftist class
[53:40.680 --> 53:45.080]  this weaponized power and then denying it and playing stupid even before
[53:45.080 --> 53:50.080]  Congress so as a class they're combining with big tech and other companies to
[53:50.080 --> 53:55.120]  literally engage in a reign of terror like locust that fly from one media
[53:55.120 --> 53:58.680]  institution to the next that's successful eating it to the bone I mean
[53:58.680 --> 54:03.560]  this is organized my friend yeah what they do is they get their own organizations
[54:03.560 --> 54:07.120]  with their own people and their own allies they get institutions Soros
[54:07.120 --> 54:11.720]  funded groups to write reports saying that YouTube is causing radicalization
[54:11.720 --> 54:16.720]  then they cite those reports in their articles and then bring them to YouTube
[54:16.720 --> 54:21.880]  and say look this is hey in fact one of the groups mentioned in this BuzzFeed
[54:21.880 --> 54:26.960]  article is the Center for Immigration Studies and they said oh well the SPLC
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.560]  says it's a hate group so surely YouTube should ban this again it's all the same
[54:31.560 --> 54:36.360]  people and everyone's a hate group they conflate conspiracy content with hyper
[54:36.360 --> 54:41.120]  partisan and misogynist videos okay if you criticize the women's march
[54:41.120 --> 54:47.240]  you're a misogynist bye bye goes your video so I contacted BuzzFeed Charlie
[54:47.240 --> 54:51.440]  Warzel who is one of your stalkers Alex one of the guys who deep platformed you
[54:51.440 --> 54:56.440]  again wrote articles about it for months on end and he said oh YouTube would
[54:56.440 --> 55:01.000]  never be platformed people like Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson because their
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.280]  followings are too large well you know who had a bigger following on YouTube
[55:05.280 --> 55:10.200]  than both of them it was you Alex and look what happened to you so again
[55:10.200 --> 55:13.800]  they're coming back to me with complete they have scripts of deception that whole
[55:13.800 --> 55:18.840]  soyboy fake thing is a cover for really alpha male criminal activity these guys
[55:18.840 --> 55:23.640]  all are given battle scripts propaganda terms it's a unified criminal operation
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.920]  and then they go right before Congress and lie Paul oh yeah of course it was
[55:28.920 --> 55:33.160]  dodging all those other Democrat congressmen lawmakers that pressured
[55:33.160 --> 55:37.160]  Facebook YouTube to ban you before it happened which is the point this is
[55:37.160 --> 55:41.440]  election meddling they changed the search results on YouTube before the
[55:41.440 --> 55:45.400]  abortion referendum in Ireland that is clear election meddling the point is
[55:45.400 --> 55:50.680]  this we need executive action Alex we need section 230 of the communications
[55:50.680 --> 55:55.360]  act change which makes it criminal offense for them to censor content it
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.360]  needs to be called election meddling it needs to be made illegal they need to be
[55:59.360 --> 56:03.800]  held responsible but from what Roger Stone said when he took to Brad Parscale
[56:03.800 --> 56:08.080]  it's not at the top of the Trump administration's agenda well news flash
[56:08.080 --> 56:11.480]  you're gonna lose the next election because you're gonna lose millions and
[56:11.480 --> 56:16.520]  millions of votes because algorithmic changes change millions of votes that's
[56:16.520 --> 56:21.680]  a fact Paul do one more segment we come back and get into more solutions what
[56:21.680 --> 56:26.320]  you see coming next but it's the line to Congress it's the collusion it's the
[56:26.320 --> 56:29.800]  organized list they have again the Wall Street Journal ten months ago in a 30
[56:29.800 --> 56:34.360]  page report that you cited and then others picked up the headlines were hold
[56:34.360 --> 56:38.800]  on your tinfoil hat Alex Jones YouTube's about to ban you and it's set in

[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.680]  censorship control front so I want Paul to have the floor the next five minutes
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.960]  and really lay out exactly what's happening exactly what we're facing and
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.760]  how huge this is and how people just wake up this could really explode in big
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:55.000]  tech space Paul take it away. Yeah people need to realize how important this is
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.080]  Google gets criticized for potentially building a dragonfly-sensitive search
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.320]  engine in China people lose their minds over that and rightly so people
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.680]  criticize Google for working in China to digitally disappear political
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.360]  dissidents yes that's outrageous but it's already happening in the United
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:19.520]  States and nobody bats an eyelid we've had studies by Dr. Robert Epstein which
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.320]  have shown algorithmic manipulation by big tech and shift millions of votes
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.640]  during elections he said it could shift up to 12 million votes he said it did
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.400]  shift two to three million votes in Hillary Clinton's favor with bias search
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.480]  algorithms so the Trump administration needs to take it make put the
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:40.880]  attention to this they need to put it top of their agenda because otherwise
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.600]  they're gonna lose in 2020 this is absolutely massive you can change the
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:50.280]  minds of people by putting certain search results over others YouTube is the
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.080]  second largest search engine in the world and we've proven for a fact that
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:59.960]  they are now placing mainstream media outlet results above independent
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.320]  content creator results even when you search the direct search term videos
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.740]  with six million views are buried beneath dozens and done dozens of mainstream
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:15.800]  media videos in one case a marked ice video was on page four it had two
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:20.200]  million views it was below another video produced by a mainstream news station
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:28.920]  which had a poultry 750 views this is open brazen partisan election meddling
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.480]  they've been caught doing this in Ireland with the abortion referendum in
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.960]  Ireland putting pro-abortion pro-abortion content above pro-life content to
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.400]  change the minds of people during an election that is election meddling
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.620]  Slate wrote an article complaining that pro-life content was appearing at the
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:51.520]  top of search results within hours YouTube changed it to relegate that pro-life
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.600]  content again clear partisan meddling now Buzzfeed writes an article saying
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.480]  that YouTube needs to tamp down on conspiracy theory content or what do
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.160]  they define as conspiracy theory content hyper parties and and misogynistic
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:12.280]  videos okay a misogynistic video could be somebody criticising the woman's
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.480]  March a hyperpartisan video could be someone criticising you know Cortes or
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.240]  Corey Brock Corey Booker this is election meddling they talk about
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:26.920]  anti-social justice warrior or misogynist clips they want those censored and once
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:32.560]  again the very next day YouTube caved came back and said yes we will now
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.040]  implement controls where we censor this conspiracy content in the Buzzfeed
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.200]  article what's conspiracy content again it's Dinesh De Souza Ben Shapiro
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.320]  Jordan Peterson they conflate all of it so again this is just another excuse for
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.040]  them to silence their political opposition to silence their adversaries by
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.200]  abusing their platforms to pressure big tech not even pressure them they're both
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.640]  working hand-in-hand to again censor any content that goes against the
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.600]  progressive dogma that's why this is important now abused in their power the
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.720]  Trump administration needs to pay attention to this they need to amend
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.760]  section 230 of the communications act otherwise they're gonna lose the 2020
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.400]  election because this kind of stuff changes millions of minds you're right
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.680]  all important and enclosing big tech above all as a psychological
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.160]  advertising operation and control system they know what they're doing so they
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.880]  picked us off picked others off set the precedent now it's turning to a giant
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:33.240]  snowball and because other people wouldn't stand up and wouldn't resist it
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.200]  and Congress has done nothing it's green-lit total censorship where now
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.560]  it's gonna be Ben Shapiro and now it's gonna be President Trump they're talking
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.560]  about taking Trump off Twitter this is now here it's the big crisis but you're

[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:37.360]  Alex Jones the foray conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.320]  Alex Jones
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.720]  Scott Russian Scott

[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.800]  hope
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:16.760]  you know I'm very frustrated with Roger Stone I'm very angry at him I'm very
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:21.560]  frustrated I'm very angry at Paul Joseph Watson very frustrated I'm very
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:28.000]  angry at my wife very frustrated I'm very angry with the crew in here and I'm
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.360]  very very frustrated and angry with myself and I'm very frustrated I'm very
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:38.200]  angry with you I'm very frustrated and angry with our local radio and TV
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:44.600]  stations I'm frustrated with our sponsors because despite the fact that we
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.440]  know the truth and we know how serious and dangerous things are we don't act
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:52.760]  like it's dangerous and we don't take the proper actions like it's dangerous and
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:58.520]  I've been wrapping my mind around something here that a very high level
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:02.880]  globalist told me off record and I think listeners and viewers have figured
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.800]  out now I tell you I've got something big off record and I can't tell you
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.440]  that's the journalistic cat I'm wearing that's how people tell me things because
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.400]  they know I then will not release the information unless it's criminal but
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.320]  you know some of the stuff they told me years ago I've thought about it it
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:22.880]  really is criminal because their whole program is criminal and I've told this
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:31.160]  story probably a hundred times in the last decade hard to believe it happened
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.600]  a decade ago I can even find the date of when it happened because I was flying on
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:43.240]  American Airlines first class on ABC's dime to be on the view for my first and
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.200]  only time they invited me back last year I refuse to go she's just a bunch of
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:56.720]  harp he's lying and I'm on the plane first class with the head of the third
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.000]  largest bank in the US I'm like I recognize you he goes yeah I recognize
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  you too and so we talked a little bit in the three-hour flight about his dad
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.520]  his retired general he was visiting in San Antonio and hell yeah he can you know
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.920]  he can fly on one of the company jets but he just likes to fly because it's
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.160]  easier because the jets can't always be there and he was talking about the
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:31.920]  economic crisis that had just happened 2008 it's about 2009 and when I started
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.960]  talking about nationalism and the family and how we defeat globalism and all the
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:42.280]  rest of it instead of me kind of being a distraction he took his glasses off and
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.080]  he said you want to know something off the record this off the record right and
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.800]  you can tell your people about it because you're not going to stop us but
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:55.440]  it was just like out of network in fact let's cue that up again but you can get
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:00.960]  as upset but he had that whole corporate alpha male thing down like I don't
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.800]  experience like a few times like my dad's dad was that type of alpha male
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.280]  where they can just turn it on like that it's like whoa and they're not even
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:11.880]  trying to do it and you know I can turn it on if I'm unscrewing somebody's head
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:17.200]  but these guys just like a faucet they have it and it was as the plane was
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.720]  landing it's taxing and he finished his statement as he got up perfectly dressed
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:25.760]  in a three-hour flight in a suit got his black Prince coat out I'm all
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:31.080]  slobbed out sitting there nervous about being on the view drinking a you know
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:37.160]  vodka and screwdriver 10 in the morning general normally do and he pointed
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:45.080]  right at me and he just said you'll never beat us because of this and he
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:52.840]  let it all out to me and he said you think people adapt and overcome like the
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.360]  Marines say you think to the adversity of what we're doing to you that you're
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:05.800]  going to adapt and that you're gonna overcome and he goes no people adapt to
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:12.520]  what we take away from him what we do to him and he goes the public will never
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:17.880]  really want your help in the end and if they were in the positions we're in they
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.680]  would tear all of us apart and he said you'd be advised son to get on the right
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:29.800]  team and he got his jacket out perfectly put it on walked off the plane and
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:34.720]  that's the same speech I've gotten from other ones and that's the attitude and
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:42.440]  their attitude is hey this stuff's all going on out in the open and the people
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:47.720]  put up with it and notice how the public didn't stand up for me when I got
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.200]  censored our audience did the best people out there literally that's the
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.560]  core they won't shut down they don't want you communicating with each other
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.320]  you're who they fear but for the general public they didn't have the instinct
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.960]  that Americans used to have that hey if we're taking one person's free speech
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:06.880]  we're about to take it all I mean you can have pedophile shows on Netflix and
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.600]  and praise devil worship everywhere but you can't have Alex Jones on the air
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.840]  questioning public events
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:24.200]  our Congress doesn't care that Google's helping set up total slavery in China so
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.840]  see the establishment says hey you're an alpha that's smart you should join us
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.120]  the other alphas it says how to help these people but you see you look at
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.720]  these globalist a lot of their kids commit suicide they're really unhappy
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:43.040]  they're real robotic they're all about power and control and how they are these
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:47.000]  incredible people but they're not really because yeah I know the world's falling
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.160]  I know the general public's got problems but they're a mirror of the establishment
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.160]  and now the establishment acts they then repeat and they become that because
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:01.040]  they're followers and it's because of the globalist bad leadership that they
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.920]  just think is survival the fittest that they cut off the Christian ethos that
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:11.160]  was the engine and the fount the headwaters of everything good and
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.600]  that's a fact
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:23.320]  and so that's really what this comes down to but you know we all just are
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:29.440]  adopting and adapting to being killed we're just opting in to be dehumanized
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.680]  and demoralized and to hate our life force and to hate our mission it did not
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.120]  believe we have some greater goal in the universe and just the last 40 years
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:45.840]  they've turned the whole seafaring wagon train expansionist idea of the
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.360]  Christian Western ethos into we're horrible we're bad we've got to roll
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.760]  over and die and everything being established is the end of humans as we
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.520]  know it it's the post-human era that the globalists are pushing for and they
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.360]  all believe they're gonna have it they all believe they're gonna get it and
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:05.640]  they're biblically buying into this devilish lie that if they'll just come
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.080]  in and play God on earth and do all these terrible horrible things somehow
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:15.360]  then they'll transcend their humanity and their fallenness by becoming even
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.880]  more fallen they've been in the dark so long they don't know what light is they've
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:25.320]  been upside down so long they think down is up they think crawling down into
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:33.440]  Hades down a trillion miles of the devil's intestines is is finding God
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:40.080]  when no you're not finding God you're finding destruction so when I see some
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.440]  dim-witted wannabe priesthood leftists who's into controlling people and even
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.800]  knows the whole narratives of fraud cussing yell at me it doesn't get me
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:54.320]  down they're cussing and yelling at me as a person if I could a bestial level
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:01.240]  the energy jacks me up but I feel sorry that they're an agent of evil and that
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.600]  they've consciously made the decision and that's what's happening in the
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.560]  world right now is that people are making the conscious decision to join
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.200]  with evil and that's why you see governors coming out and saying yeah I
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:16.720]  said we keep babies alive and kill them after they're born big deal I don't
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:22.000]  apologize and and vice doesn't apologize for all their pro pedophile shows in the
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.720]  New York Times because hey they think we're weak and they're making their
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:31.880]  move they've got all their followers put in place and they're making their move
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.960]  on us so we come back do you want to adapt to being a slave or do you want
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:42.360]  to adapt and overcome because I am about adapting by overcoming by building our
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.000]  future by deciding what it will be not adapting to the architecture and the
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.720]  false paradigm they put us into but by doing what humans do in the image of God
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:56.720]  building our environment deciding our destiny I am creating new destinies

[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:02.400]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.680]  drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:11.040]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:16.480]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:21.520]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:27.080]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:32.240]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.560]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:42.560]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.960]  turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:52.520]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:59.080]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:05.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:25.160]  I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen but it does
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:40.680]  happen from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones so I
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:45.280]  have fought with the devil I got down his level but thanks to Jesus Christ I
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:50.680]  never gave in so he gave up on me to quote Keith Whitley but I just spent a
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:55.440]  whole segment getting into the globalist ace in the hole they believe
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:01.440]  that you don't adapt and overcome the tyranny you learn to submit to it if it's
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:09.400]  done by increment by successive approximation or the frog in the pot of
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:15.040]  water that's slowly taken up to boil so I'm gonna hit two stories one this
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:19.360]  segment one next that are completely illustrative of this and just really
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.480]  sit back because I have to do this too I'm not lecturing here you have to really
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:30.200]  sit back and let it sink in what's going on now imagine if you were coming out
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:35.680]  with telecommunications equipment 40 years ago that was developed where you
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:40.840]  would have a portal or a hub or a managing robot in the house that would
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:45.040]  control and manipulate all the devices all pre-programmed like a universal
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:50.620]  remote and that that system like a Palin tier let's see what the NSA
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:55.440]  program is called or crystal ball that you can ask questions to you can look
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:02.560]  into but the problem is it's two-way now why on earth would you bring something
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:06.520]  into your house that's two-way because it's not just like a telephone where
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.000]  you dial the number it goes out and if somebody wants to tap it they got a
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.400]  break in on that line this this is a system where the whole world and in
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:19.920]  five billion people that are on the internet out of seven and a half billion
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:28.360]  and all these computers and all these hackers why on earth would you ever why
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.800]  would you ever put something that like that in your house we'll see here's the
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:40.440]  normalcy bias you're not a killer you're not a murderer you're not any of these
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:49.560]  things so you project on to it that it's good because you're good that's why so
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.720]  many people get in the yellow Volkswagen with Ted Bundy and they get
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:57.760]  raped and tortured for three days that's why so many people can get conned or
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:05.240]  get scammed because that's what they do that's how they operate they play on you
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:13.000]  projecting that so a family was watched through nest security cameras you know
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.480]  when these things came out a few years ago I said all these wireless systems
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.360]  anybody can grab into them whatever they want Amazon's already watching you with
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.600]  live AI systems already gathering data for sales there is a race imagine if
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.920]  this was coming out 20 30 years ago what you did these systems into corporate
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:34.960]  understanding there would be a race wouldn't there by all the tech companies
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:43.960]  big and small to see who can get an autonomous surveillance pod an Imperial
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:48.360]  probdroid let's not use the Palantir analogy let's use an Imperial
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:54.840]  probdroid analogy you imperial probdroid they're not too powerful
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:24:00.120]  themselves but they'll call in some really big bad guys here's a microcosm
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:04.720]  example of this a lot of folks till they figured out not to do it would post on
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:09.400]  Facebook where they lived geolocated didn't know it was doing it on the
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:13.560]  photos of what they got for Christmas and they were gonna go to Cancun they
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:18.040]  come a week later and their entire house had been robbed and someone had been
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:22.880]  living in it and had been there until the very day they flew back because they
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:26.040]  were broken into your computers through Facebook they knew everything about you
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:30.200]  they were watching you post photos of yourself that morning having a last
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:41.600]  pina colada in Cancun so you you put these things in and they're so convenient
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:46.200]  for you but they're all two-way let's let's play a clip from Lord of the Rings
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:51.080]  where Gandalf's like why do you have this two-way camera system this computer
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:55.040]  system yes the archetypal you know the ancients envisioned something like this
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:59.240]  almost like they've been through this before a race memory because in the
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:02.280]  future that's what they say like should be a ball that projects into your house
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:05.560]  everything like that's the new designs they plan in about ten years will
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:10.080]  actually be a crystal ball oh wow strange every culture said that they've
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:13.600]  seen those or heard of those and now they'll be crystal balls for everyone
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.520]  that are two-way but but see you go where you want but you don't control who
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:24.120]  comes in it's a big doorway into your life who would put a big black ball in
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:27.680]  your house that anything could come through oh and it turns out some folks
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:33.240]  came through on their little kids tried to try to kill them with the computer

[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.960]  Roger Stone either gagged or un-gagged by this nightmare judge that's creating a
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:04.840]  star chamber at least that's what Mueller's requesting he's done that so
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:09.880]  far with other cases he gags people from speaking out in the press so the
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:16.520]  press can destroy him and she doesn't let them do fundraising I mean you talk
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:23.560]  about Soviet that that puts the yes and Soviet big time and of course we're
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.720]  being targeted right along with Roger people say well why would you do that
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.600]  dummy oh like the whole world's about trying to get out of confrontation
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:36.800]  listen I don't look for any confrontation I want to be out on a little
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:41.560]  aluminum boat with a 20 horsepower motor with my kids that's about as close to
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:47.400]  heaven as you're gonna get but I can't sit there and ride around on a boat all
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:51.600]  day and have a good time while the enemies coming down on us and it's
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.800]  really that simple this is that's why I do not like listeners saying oh you're
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:01.600]  so great you're such a hero listen if I was in a truck and flipped off the road
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:10.480]  and it went into a river and let's say my two-year-old was in a God forbid was
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:17.880]  in a their safety seat and we were going under water it wouldn't be her heroic
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:21.520]  that I'd climb in the back and make damn sure she got out that's my baby
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:27.600]  that's mine I want that he did it in her row it to try to save my baby that
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:32.560]  didn't something special to do I'll do a lot more than climb in the back of
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:39.920]  some flooding out car to get my baby and I just don't understand how people don't
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:46.440]  have will like used to I used to go a long time ago and swim laps back when
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:49.840]  I was in better shape like 20 years ago the place called deep Eddie and it's
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:54.600]  kind of Olympic sized pool and I could swim from one end to the other under
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.520]  water and they had these Olympic former Olympic athletes that were there and
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:00.960]  most of them couldn't do it and I had bets with them and beat them and they
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:05.040]  said how do you do that because you're not even that guy said it's will I had
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.440]  to turn my brain off and decide that I'm dead if I don't do this and then it's
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:14.280]  easy I can still do like a length and a half I just don't have that will like I
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:20.520]  used to plus my heart heart starts beating way too fast but the point is
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:27.560]  that people don't understand deciding you're going to do something they don't
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:31.880]  get it and if you want to know why the globalists are so scared of this
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:37.680]  broadcast it's because they don't have will at the top they've got evil will
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:42.040]  to dominate but their minions are a bunch of followers and just the idea of
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:49.920]  someone having will scares the hell out of them but so much of will is deciding
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:57.000]  something's right and then flipping a switch flipping a switch saying I made
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.720]  a decision that I'm not going to roll over to what you're doing and it's that
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:05.320]  spirit that they fear it's that idea that the enemy wants to stop because they
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:08.760]  want to rule your life they want to run your life they think you're a bunch of
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:17.080]  more lines now I just spent a whole segment getting into the tech we've
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:20.360]  brought into our houses and our worlds and how great it works and how
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:24.880]  wonderful it is it's not bad itself but it was designed and built in a
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:28.320]  corporate rollout where they're all competing with each other over who can
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.000]  get the most AI in your house to watch and listen to everything you do to
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.880]  control your life and then manipulate decisions you make to run your life I
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.480]  mean you wouldn't let some Senate committee in your house to live there
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:45.840]  and tell you how to how to cook dinner or what to watch on television and you
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:51.400]  sure as hell wouldn't want them in your bedroom but on record and we first
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.960]  broke this
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:03.080]  since these things came out that's been their business model to listen to
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:11.000]  every damn thing you say it's not just when you hit the button it's not just
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.760]  when you hit the button and you ask it a question that's that's you get to oh you
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:21.360]  get to look in the crystal ball it's watching you Jack and do you know who's
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:26.640]  on the other end of that not a very nice fella so I said I get to with this
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.240]  segment but we got to get to it next is I want to play the whole CBS this piece
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:33.560]  but here's this family and they hear their little kid being talked to you by a
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:40.160]  man and they keep wondering why that the heat's turned up to 90 on the baby's
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.760]  room and why well stuff's going crazy because you've got some lower level
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:50.120]  psychotic that knows it's easy to grab through the transmissions or other
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:57.400]  systems the code to your nest or any other of these smart meters or any of
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:03.320]  them because they're all designed to steal your data that's what they're
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:13.840]  designed to do Jack so it's like oh these devices are vulnerable they're
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:20.680]  designed to sing a Roman short sword is vulnerable to being a very effective
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:27.160]  weapon at killing people it's not vulnerable it's designed woodchippers
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:33.200]  are vulnerable to being able to chew up lots of wood lighters are vulnerable
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:47.080]  towards combustion 45 9-11 cults are vulnerable to firing seven shots it's
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:53.960]  designed to do it it's the big global corporate system and it's what they're
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:57.760]  providing and what they're rolling out and they go before Congress and say
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:01.320]  we're not watching or listening to anybody and it's in their own corporate
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:11.440]  minutes they're doing it but here's the deal we know this we know this and when
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:17.160]  somebody gave some family member last Christmas gave one of my daughters one
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.480]  of these damn things and I hear something up in a room and I go in there
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.440]  and there is there is a Lexus set up and my daughter's talking to it my
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:28.160]  middle daughter and I didn't act like Moses that found a golden calf and go
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:33.800]  crazy I should have I took it and I said I'll take evil and turn it to good I
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:38.320]  took the office with a piece with it here in the thing but the point is I must
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:42.680]  not be doing a good enough job that my own family buys my children these damn
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:48.000]  things you say well the phone is the same deal I get it but it can be locked
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.440]  up it can be put in a lead container in your purse it can be put away it can be
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:58.240]  no this is supposedly in the center of your life like daddy and mommy used to
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:04.120]  be a big evil robot spying on everybody and that everybody else can then jump
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.760]  into and dial into imagine the left and apple what jerks they are there none of
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:12.520]  their kids are allowed to use iPads any of it ever back to Steve Jobs because
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:16.760]  that's for you with a back door two buttons they call any phone number they
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.560]  want keep wondering how Buzzfeed and the Washington Post can break in anybody's
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.640]  phone or anything and how they know everything and I'll see it in new how

[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:43.280]  haven't gotten to we have a special guest joining us and it's just this whole
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:48.160]  idea of bringing tech in from evil companies whose business model is
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:53.520]  watching and listening and using nsa software from the echelon program of
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:57.960]  the 70s and 80s that this is old-school stuff to track everything you say and
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:02.560]  then put it into a computer algorithm where if you talk about louis vatam
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:08.440]  handbags two hours later it's all over your phone because they're listening and
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:12.560]  then people say oh well that's a i i'm not worried about it well you better be
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:16.240]  worried about the companies and what they use that information for meanwhile
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:21.240]  family was watched through nest security cameras i'm gonna get to this and then
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:26.560]  do a story but when I saw a few days ago I said I'm always a guy that says this
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:30.720]  stuff first and and everyone's while I'm wrong I said let me let everybody else
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:35.600]  find out just showing the establishment doesn't matter what you do to me people
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:40.840]  are on to your crap now and the police aren't buying it no one's buying it this
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.560]  empire actor were the guys in ski mask called him the n-word and said you're a
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.640]  you know a queer and all this stuff and everybody's saying it's a false flag
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:53.720]  there's no video even though there's cameras of it you it's there's millions
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:57.960]  of these shows everybody's a star that's got some show and then now they've got
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:02.680]  people crying on TV saying trumps behind it so you at least know the response to
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:07.760]  it is a false flag but oh if it turns out it was real which maybe this is the
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:12.200]  one out of a thousand hate crimes it's real then it's like oh Alex is evil for
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:16.760]  questioning it no I'm not it's my first minute right and I've been proven right
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:20.120]  over and over again but we'll go over some of their hundreds of fake hate
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:24.560]  crimes because you know there's not a lot of folks spray paint and queers on
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:28.760]  people's walls you know we're not that interested in what you do in your
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.400]  bedroom bro
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:38.440]  oh I'm so sick of it yeah you're in Chicago where blacks kill 2,000 blacks a
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:42.280]  year and whites might kill five blacks a year but whites are evil and oh you're a
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:49.800]  poor victim we're gonna look at it all but first since I mentioned it family was
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:54.640]  watched through Ness security cameras and they hear this man's voice they feel
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:59.800]  crazy they hear it again then they capture it and then the guys jack in
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.200]  with everything in the house trying to kill the baby with 90 degree turned up
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:06.760]  heater turning the power off or messing with everything this is what you
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:10.240]  brought into your house so that even if there were system-wide bugs or problems
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:14.480]  everything goes down why would you want you big with a systems like this well
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:20.840]  because you know I can then watch my house remotely really what about knowing
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:26.160]  your neighbors sides what are you gonna do all day then you know we've got these
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:31.000]  on the office similar systems like oh we got an alert oh a deer walked by or a
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.280]  stray dog you know it's you spend your whole life just watching and watching
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:37.600]  and watching don't have guns but oh have lots of cameras lots of cameras which
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:42.840]  won't actually cut crime not saying cameras and other cells are bad but
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:47.280]  these are two-way digital cameras that anybody can jump on and then use against
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:51.280]  you it turns out thieves are casing joints breaking in instantly to these and
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:55.760]  using things like nest systems because they're the most ubiquitous like whatever
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:00.160]  the biggest system is always the worst whatever is the biggest like PC always
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:03.440]  had all the viruses because it was the biggest and Mac was small so they weren't
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:07.200]  now that they're big they have viruses it's like oh I've got the biggest I've
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:14.360]  got the best you mean a big giant red axe on your ass so let's go to the CBS news
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:19.200]  report out of Chicago here it is as I approached the baby's room and stood
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:26.720]  outside I was shocked to hear a deep manly voice talking to my seven-month
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:31.440]  year-old son my blood ran cold Arjun sood was standing outside of his doors
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:35.160]  back it up I'm I agree with the father that's not good but Bill Marr would say
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:39.240]  it's love I mean Bill Marr says a 12-year-old should have sex with 35-year-olds
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:45.800]  it's love so hey we got a hate crime the father is trying to stop his baby who's
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:50.400]  consensual of age to have a conversation with whoever this person is I mean
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:53.640]  that's the leftist view I'm just kind of bringing you fair and balanced like what
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:58.000]  would Buzzfeed or vice say I'm not saying the father is absolutely right but
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.440]  I'm gonna be cutting in as if I was vice with the other side of the story but
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:06.560]  let's continue to my seven-month-old son my blood ran cold Arjun sood hold on
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:11.560]  that's pedophobia back it up we got a thought crime I hate crime here back up

[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:31.600]  anything she's a woman she should rejoice looking at his genitals your
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:36.960]  daughters a hate monger let's continue looking to my seven-month-old son my
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:41.080]  blood ran cold Arjun sood was standing outside his son Oliver's door Sunday
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:45.840]  when he heard that voice he burst in the voice stopped he and his wife chalked it
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:49.880]  up to baby monitor interference but once downstairs and I was standing right
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:55.760]  about here they heard the voice again who is this an unseen intruder talking to
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:00.680]  them through their nest security camera using obscenities including the n-word
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:06.000]  asking me you know why I'm looking at him because he saw obviously that I was
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.880]  looking back and continuing to taunt me it was terrifying sood says once is

[01:53:56.520 --> 01:54:04.920]  exchange sood believes the hacker also turned their upstairs thermostat to 90
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:11.000]  degrees noticing that the same night the potential danger to their baby and then

[01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:58.760]  don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper it
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:02.300]  consists of the things that we're willing to fight for the First Amendment the
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:05.760]  Bill of Rights the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions they're
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:10.400]  prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:14.200]  those God-given rights from us as individuals you better understand that
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:17.520]  because they're taking them right now
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:22.960]  we have seen what they want to do they called it UN Agenda 21 now they call
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:27.620]  it the UN 2030 Agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they
[01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:31.280]  want people out of the suburbs they want to pack everybody into the cities
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:36.720]  because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone it's the

[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:49.520]  editforce.com forward slash show
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:55.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:55.800 --> 02:00:09.280]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:23.280]  ain't no stinking robot singing like Merle Haggard the desert's quiet Cleveland's cold
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:32.800]  and so the story is we're told aren't you need your prayers it's true but save
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:42.840]  a few for the lefty too he only did what he had to do and now he's grown old
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:47.840]  and now he's grown old
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:57.240]  you know I don't hate you Madeline as fallen as we are I can see our real
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:12.440]  form like and so everything you're seeing is a multi thousand year plan to
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:17.120]  try to sucker us before we get our birthright before we cross the River
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:22.160]  Jordan into the real promised land everything is in attempt to steal that
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:26.240]  because that's powerful the only power the devil has to try to swindle our
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:33.760]  free will to join him I'm not gonna play this until after a guest has gone
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:37.560]  because I gotta find the right clip to do it for some comic relief here this is
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:41.840]  how my weird brain works remember in a caddy shack which is the greatest film
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:47.040]  ever made from a joke perspective it's intentional unintentional comic you've
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:52.720]  got the crazy range keeper and he says I want you to go kill all the gophers and
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:59.920]  he says I can't do that I'll go to go to prison not not golfers gophers so he's
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:05.200]  he's there dropping you know rabbits and squirrels they're actually see four
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:10.880]  into the holes he's saying hello mr. golfer mr. squirrel here not plastic
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:24.840]  explosive or anything excuse me and then it comes to this point that fit into
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:30.960]  the last thing I just covered with the nest the Amazon nest the AI nest in your
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:40.120]  house spying on you that other hackers can then jump in on floor lamp sparks
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:48.120]  privacy concerns document cam shot please of course it's not it's not a floor
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:54.440]  lamp it's an IG IG 8 if you're gonna use a Star Wars analogy assassination
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:03:02.960]  Freud I'm sorry you know I've bragged the other day that I haven't gotten sick in
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:08.680]  years but everybody's got this so mold and cedar allergy the headlines are
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:13.800]  Austin schools closed due to flu but I talked to the parents there's no flu to
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:18.040]  speak of it's all the horrible allergies that are being triggered by the fact
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:23.280]  that our immune systems are in such problems such crises that it's been
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:26.280]  triggering a larger crisis but let me make it pose myself here's we're gonna
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:33.520]  break again you just go to buy a lamp but it's actually a camera and microphone
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:38.080]  watching everything you do with a predisposed system to jack into your
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:48.760]  Wi-Fi which you allow it to do to then send back your entire room in HD but
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:52.880]  that's what you call a lamp now where you won't be able to go out and get a lamp
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:56.440]  or get a toaster remember with the director of the CIA seven years ago in
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:02.760]  wired magazine said he said in the future your toaster will be spying on you
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:06.520]  people said ah that's insane Jones is insane he said that was coming that's
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:11.320]  the plan there's gonna be a whole new market in trying to get things that
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:14.840]  aren't watching and controlling you it's like you know they've attacked the
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:20.120]  same Jones says that no I don't say that's it Minnesota like six years ago
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:27.320]  in the police department of all places lights that flicker at a rate that
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:33.880]  interface with a computer device that then sends data over power lines and of
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:37.040]  course it uses like a radar system to then give him a 360 view of what's
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.960]  happening inside the police station you know why would the police state see
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:45.880]  doesn't sound like humans cook this up does it I don't think so I'm not sure
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:50.200]  exactly what's going on but I think it's got little horns a little forked tail
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:56.560]  these that's what they see on TNT these little buggers are giving us a problem
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:03.280]  when it comes to rebuilding your energy convenience is key while coffee candy and
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:07.120]  other sugary products can give you a short boost the crash can leave you more
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:11.800]  tired than ever turbo force from info war's life is a powerful mix-in energy

[02:05:45.200 --> 02:06:00.200]  down perk up with turbo force at infowarstore.com
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:07:00.360]  seems like it happened yesterday but it happened almost two weeks ago the
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:06.480]  Covington Catholic School was there at the DC mall for the giant fact I saw
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:09.560]  them on the war on this morning playing it because we find that huge footage of
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:15.280]  like a million people marching for life that almost no corporate coverage and
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:20.280]  then there was that local Catholic school from Kentucky they screamed at by the
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:23.840]  black Israelites that they were subhuman garbage when other organs harvested
[02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:28.160]  that the black kids with them were gonna go to hell and the Native American
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:31.120]  elder or the professional troublemaker going over in the middle trying to get a
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:36.880]  fight going and that was a false plan that was a staged event one of the
[02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:42.800]  thousands of hate crimes that happen every year and 99% were the police just
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:47.280]  by default no it's fake whether it's a cross burning or someone spray paints
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:53.920]  queer on someone's dorm wall or the Naval Academy or the Air Force Academy I
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:08:00.040]  mean it's just everywhere so you've got the Catholic school folks and others out
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:04.440]  there for the March for Life big giant some say a million people who knows but
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:09.000]  there's the footage of the March for Life of your TV viewer it's it's massive
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:14.240]  your radio lister we have live streams and fours.com for a show so I start
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:17.720]  hearing about this three days ago and I see the media all breathless about it
[02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:21.800]  and I look how it's a guy who's not even really a B-list actor and they're
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:25.840]  trying to hype him up and it's Chicago where it came out of and if 99% of
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:32.600]  these are fake I think it's pretty fair you know to question that Jesse Mullet
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:38.840]  I'm sorry his name is Schmutt Mullet declares justice will be served as probe
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:44.120]  into attack continues and the police wouldn't got the footage there's no
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:47.960]  guys in team ask there's no one attacking him where he said it happened
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:52.280]  and then there's certainly not white and he didn't tell him upfront whether you
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:59.400]  know standard mugging there in Chicago muggerland and in the south side he
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:03.920]  didn't first say it was white guys that called him the n-word and then said you
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:09.480]  make America greater or whatever but see oh he's black and it's homophobic so
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:17.360]  it's like the tribal elder the elder was surrounded by a mob of white
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:22.800]  supremacist demons but he stood his ground actually he went over in front of
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:27.520]  them and they were being really really nice to him so I'm questioning if this is
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:33.400]  part two of all of that when we have such a long history of that but
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:40.680]  regardless it's certainly a false flag now when leftist woman in training to
[02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:46.320]  appear and act like a delusional crack whore Ellen Page says Trump Pence
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:51.840]  responsible for attack on Empire actor because you know 98% of blacks are
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.760]  killed by their black people that's if they get out of the womb half of the
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:59.560]  poor folks are killed before they ever get out of the womb usually by white
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:03.000]  doctors but no one thinks that's racist okay I want to kill black people or
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.840]  anybody else but I sure as hell don't like blacks being turned into political
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:12.800]  weapon against me and like the new KKK on PCP but I mean you know you again so
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:28.320]  she's crying he's an elder and then you've got Bill Maher like who wants to
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:32.680]  screw these kids I like to screw other kids are like screw kids yeah screw kids
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:38.120]  abort them all kill them after they're born but if you look at her she's an
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:43.200]  actress she's she's up there she's thinking of her dead grandmother now can
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:48.120]  you imagine what it's like like black people are under total siege by the KKK
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:11:00.600]  it's terrible this is serious folks so see when I'm sincere it's totally
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:03.960]  sincere and looks awesome because it's real but when I'm trying to be insincere
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:09.000]  fake I can't be fake like her just look at this crap your TV viewer this is
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:14.160]  unbelievable garbage so I thought I would just mention that here's just the
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:17.320]  latest there have been over a hundred hate crime hoaxes in the past decade
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:22.200]  these are documented ones remember some guy was coming over Jewish tombstones in
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:26.880]  New Jersey and spray paint Nazi crap and and I said you're on T it's a liberal
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:31.480]  Trump said I bet it staged he had to have a state of the Union early and say
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:34.440]  I believe Jews get attacked of course there's real people attacking Jews but
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:39.560]  this one was staged it was staged but no one got into the retraction or the
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:44.360]  Air Force could that come and when we don't put up with the racism of America
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:50.320]  America sucks and our Air Force sucks but I'm here to demoralize you so
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:53.240]  autonomous weapons systems can take over the larger global plan I've been
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:56.800]  promised AI superstructure once I've sold you out to the interdimensional forces
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:02.480]  work but excuse me I'm sorry we've got someone who put an N word on the
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:06.520]  water cooler down there at the vending machine and the entire Air Force sucks
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:11.400]  and humans in control of machine suck give full AI control yes Lord I've got
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:17.160]  your body up thank you sir I'm a general now but not for you so that's what this
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:23.880]  is and that's all this is is a bunch of trainers working with the devil it's all
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:27.600]  there in the Bible interdimensional attack and notice they won't criticize me
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:31.520]  in the media for this oh you they make up all this wild stuff I've never said
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:35.360]  but they won't touch this because they're on their knees taking hallucinations
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:39.760]  every day to just get the next message oh please give me another
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:45.800]  transmission oh oh bathroom that please oh I just took 20 hits of acid please
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:51.720]  Lord please give me the next vision that's their holy ghost and it gets they
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:54.960]  get more and more captured by this one they're also scared you don't think the
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:00.360]  devil with his invasion force has generals that have souls are in command

[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:32.840]  bulldog of taking action war lumber by the way my nickname with George Norris the
[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:36.000]  bulldog I kind of look like a bulldog too she doesn't look like a bulldog but
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.680]  she's today's like a bulldog we'll talk to her in a moment about her latest
[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:41.960]  exploits and the fight for freedom but first they're telling me to play this
[02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:45.440]  we're trying to bring back some of the old-school stuff from 77 trillion years
[02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:49.920]  ago two years ago one of the fidget spinner videos that got over a hundred
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:53.600]  million views total which they've deleted off the internet now because you
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:56.680]  know it's funny and they like it this had over a hundred million views it's
[02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:00.520]  been deleted so here it is from the vault it's a little shortened piece about
[02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:20.880]  we love our Somalis we love our Muslims too oh they so good oh they so sweet
[02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:40.440]  oh
[02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:12.680]  Now that's that's fun to cover but Laura Loomer going to Nancy Pelosi's house and then going
[02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:18.520]  to I guess her nephew's house who is the true American psycho way beyond Christian Bale
[02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:23.360]  and Bill Himmer who also looks like American psycho I mean and and I gotta tell you about
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:31.440]  the new governor California reportedly because you know I know this from from his ex-wife
[02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:36.960]  he has a two foot long you know what so I'm not really this is a family show but now they
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:40.520]  can cuss on national TV I should tell you so I guess psychopaths also have like elephant
[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:44.680]  trunk proboscis I don't know why I'm telling this now but I guess that's what psychopaths
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:48.720]  have I'm sorry she went to his house not in search of that she went to his house because
[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:53.200]  well he says no borders no walls no USA at all here is Laura Loomer getting arrested
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:23:02.000]  there near the la lair of the male genitals known as Godzilla here it is he wants to protect
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.280]  the Eagles he wants to give a aid and comfort to illegals how much how much money is spent
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:12.680]  on illegal immigration here in California 22 billion 23 billion 23 billion a year in
[02:23:12.680 --> 02:23:17.320]  California California so what I want to know is why is it why is it not okay to come over
[02:23:17.320 --> 02:23:26.080]  Gavin Newsom's fence but it's but it's okay to come over the United States border seems
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:36.320]  kind of hypocritical right you guys Gavin Newsom is arresting me so I've been arrested
[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:42.280]  here at Gavin Newsom's mansion the governor's mansion Gavin Newsom is Nancy Pelosi's nephew
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:47.800]  and look I thought that everyone was welcome here they spend $23 billion a year on illegal
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:53.080]  immigration here in California alone over 220 billion nationally illegally you're welcome
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:57.760]  here and the Democrats will give you free health care free housing on the taxpayer dime
[02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:06.320]  right as an American you're not allowed to hop over Gavin Newsom's fence or Nancy Pelosi's
[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:10.440]  fence you get handcuffed and arrested but if you're an illegal alien or you're a rapist
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:15.960]  or you kill innocent police officers or you murder and rape women here and you have to
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:21.720]  be welcomed here so look at guys look this is a perfect example of what Donald Trump
[02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:26.880]  is trying to champion all right America first right you have an American citizen a journalist
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:32.320]  being arrested outside Gavin Newsom's yard but then all the illegal aliens here the illegal
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:43.680]  aliens who hop the fence at Nancy Pelosi's place last week were not arrested and you
[02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:47.320]  know look the Democrats they don't want to compromise with Donald Trump they don't want
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:51.120]  to compromise with our great president Donald Trump who's trying to improve border security
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:56.120]  yeah that's my idea you can put all my stuff back in they don't want to compromise but they're
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:05.360]  hypocrites you guys that's Laura Lumber dot US for radio listeners and I don't usually
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:11.080]  get crude about things but I know you know reportedly the ex-wife of this American psycho
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:16.400]  Gavin Newsom the new governor that he literally was genetically engineered to rape America
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:20.760]  so that's why I brought that to a whole allegory I patrol the media but seriously Laura we're
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:23.840]  gonna go to break come back in a minute you got like four minutes here wow you went to
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:28.520]  Pelosi's house didn't have a problem but you went to the American psychos facility went
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:32.760]  over the little three-foot fence the police immediately responded but Pelosi and others
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:38.760]  have said walls are immoral they shouldn't exist yeah it's really interesting to show
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:43.280]  that comparison and there is a reason why I didn't bring illegal aliens with me to Gavin
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:48.640]  Newsom's home at the governor's mansion in California because I wanted to show the difference
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:54.080]  to prove that illegal aliens matter more than American citizens a week and a half ago I
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:58.800]  went to Nancy Pelosi's mansion in Napa Valley and hopped over her fence with actual illegal
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:04.200]  aliens from Guatemala and Mexico who I picked up at the Home Depot and when the police showed
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:09.800]  up right they said that Nancy Pelosi was gonna have a sighted for trespassing but we weren't
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:15.240]  arrested and I said all along it was probably because the optics of it were so bad and Nancy
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:19.400]  Pelosi who always says everyone's welcome here and that wall is an immorality didn't
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:24.120]  want to have the optics of having three illegal aliens arrested at her multi-million dollar
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:29.160]  mansion so then I thought I said to myself well what's gonna happen if I go to Casa de
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:33.960]  Gavin because Gavin Newsom for those of you who don't know is Nancy Pelosi's nephew by
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:39.520]  marriage and so there's a lot of incest in the Democrat Party right you have a lot of
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:46.000]  these politicians who are connected through marriages or some relationship whatsoever
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:54.840]  and then that's why you have a lot of this I guess like cohesion within the Democrat
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:59.720]  Party and it's literally because these people are related to each other and on the clock
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:05.840]  and off the clock they're probably coordinating America's demise and so when I went to Gavin
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:10.920]  Newsom's home I set up a sanctuary state fair and I brought some people with me I was with
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:16.440]  Ben Burke from Frontline America which is a group of course that exposes a lot of these
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:22.440]  immigration issues across our country and we hopped over Gavin Newsom's fence after
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:27.680]  we brought the infamous immorality tent and placed it in his lawn and what happened is
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:32.360]  he not only had a fence but he had armed guards police officers on his property because
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:36.720]  well he's the governor of California and I was arrested you can see in the video I
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:42.120]  was handcuffed and I was taken away to the Sacramento County Jail which is one of the
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:46.560]  from what I'm told one of the top worst jails in America and it's funny right it's funny
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:52.120]  how illegal aliens were not arrested but then I get arrested simply for standing on some
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:57.080]  grass and I want to know right I really want to know when Gavin Newsom is finally going
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:01.720]  to take care of American citizens because the cost of illegal immigration alone in California
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:08.120]  every year is $23 billion in climbing all right I agree with you and I shouldn't even
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:11.040]  have joked up from we post a video later I may even edit that out because the crew is
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:15.600]  teasing me because I'm inside baseball about him and Guilfoyle and all these other women
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:20.360]  and it's like it's the big joke that he literally wants to rape America and it's like he literally
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:26.120]  looks like what what American psycho wish he looks like I mean I would run from that dude
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:29.840]  I mean I'm like not afraid of dudes but I would actually be afraid to run away he's

[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:52.440]  um herrison smith one of our great researchers and one of the filling hosts here just brought
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:57.800]  me intel that I actually thought about last week and it's it's just totally profound and
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:03.680]  it's true and it's so big I have trouble even just kind of even covering it here on air
[02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:08.040]  I'm like wow this should take months of research and should be presented at the national archives
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:13.000]  or at the press club and with great officiation but I'm going to do it next segment after
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.600]  Laura Loomer leaves us and I apologize to listeners and I mean that you get the truth
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:22.000]  out of me there's no teleprompters there's no producers controlling me sometimes I careen
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:29.760]  off course like a runaway train that's jumped the tracks because I just know so much stuff
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:36.360]  I can't even tell you and I really do want to but but but Laura Loomer who again I call
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:40.720]  the bulldog she doesn't look like a bulldog I look like a bulldog I've been called the
[02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:45.200]  bulldog by George Murray and others but she's intrepid I don't know anybody that's got the
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:54.400]  the bravada to go out there and do it but it's not it's not born out they got a confidence
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:58.560]  it's born out of necessity being censored being lied about being demonized she has a
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:05.240]  lot of tenacity going to Pelosi's house where they have all these walls and gates and you're
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:08.560]  going to Twitter all the things she's done going up there when they're having plays about
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:13.160]  killing Trump and jumping up on stage I mean there's too much to mention you should go
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:19.280]  to her website you should support her we try to support her as much as we can but but just
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:22.160]  getting back to the shoes around I shouldn't make jokes about Newsom which is actually
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:26.600]  a true joke I was told by multiple women just as it's interesting let him know that I'm
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:29.960]  inside his head I'm inside his life I know everything that's what that was really was
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:32.640]  a little shot across the bow to him because I know about the other stuff too but I get
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:36.680]  ready you know you know Stone already took down the governor of New York get ready buddy
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:44.520]  but I'm sorry control yourself please control yourself control yourself sorry I'm gonna make
[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:50.600]  a lot of rumor so Laura you did a great job and you got arrested so I know they can charge
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:36:00.480]  you with with well with what with trespassing in America I guess yeah I was charged with
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:05.880]  trespassing but I'm misdemeanor so I have to actually go back to court on February 28
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:10.920]  in Sacramento and who knows what's gonna happen I don't know but they actually held me inside
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:16.480]  this jail cell for about eight hours and so it was pretty gross because the cell is really
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:20.280]  dirty I was surrounded by a bunch of drug addicts people who were having withdrawals
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:24.240]  from heroin which probably came across our southern border if you want to get down to
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:29.880]  it and you know there wasn't any toilet paper and people were like like pooping all over
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:35.400]  the place but I guess that's the California experience right I mean if poop isn't involved
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:39.760]  in your visit to California then I guess you're not really doing things right and that's why
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:44.960]  I actually brought bags of poop and needles to Gavin Newsom because for those of you who
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:50.120]  don't know it's it's I guess acceptable to the Democrats here for people to just pop
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:55.360]  a spot and poop on the sidewalk so they now have cleanup crews in San Francisco because
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:59.280]  people are pooping all over the streets and Gavin Newsom isn't doing anything about it
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:03.080]  and you are also now legally allowed to shoot a heroin on the side of the street and the
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:07.320]  Democrats will provide you free needles on behalf well they're not really free right
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:10.880]  because there's no such thing as free like the socialists would like you to believe.
[02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:16.760]  No no Turner let me talk about the amazing who are these really cool like great looking
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:22.040]  ladies awesome you know handsome black dudes who is this crew of fans you had out there
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:27.040]  because I saw the longer like hours of video before and after these are some really talented
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:29.600]  smart people you had with you who are these folks.
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:34.520]  Thanks yeah so my crew of course I have a camera crew I work with guys from folklore
[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:40.400]  Americana and then there's another girl on from Instagram I know a great girl a Fox City
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:46.480]  Midge if you're not already following her she is well was the Nancy Pelosi impersonator
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:50.440]  and you may have seen one of her recent videos where she went to the Women's March with another
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:54.880]  guy David Harris who was also there and they wore MAGA hats and they got some feminists
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:38:00.120]  on camera who were basically going crazy over the MAGA hats these bald feminists so if you're
[02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:05.200]  not already following her Fox City Midge on Instagram she's great and then David Harris
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:09.520]  of course who is a black Trump supporter great guy as well and then there were just a lot
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:15.400]  of people who I brought out as well there are a lot of American conservative activists
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:17.400]  themselves are people who are just.
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:21.920]  Let me ask you this then how did the cops keep a straight face because they all get like
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:26.480]  Latin America is collapsing all this is happening we're just pointing out that walls work it's
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:31.840]  okay to have walls or doors all these politicians calling for no wall are obsessed with security
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:35.640]  of walls how are the cops behaving once you got in the squad car with them.
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:39.360]  Well they were apologizing for arresting me because they're like look we just have to
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:43.960]  do our job but they were fans and actually when I got to the police station some of the
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:48.240]  officers were like oh my god it's Laura Loomer I follow you on Instagram and Facebook and
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:51.280]  so some of these officers were my fans and they were telling me how much they thought
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:55.680]  my video at Nancy Pelosi's place was hilarious and then when Ben and I were in jail getting
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:59.600]  booked you know they were like oh what are these guys here for oh why is he wearing a
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:05.080]  Trump is your president shirt what they do and then I was so wearing my poncho of course
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:09.080]  and then when the officers told them that we hopped over Gavin Newsom's fence and were
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:14.560]  protesting illegal immigration all of the officers in the booking area in the jail started chanting
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:20.000]  Bill the wall I wish I had a camera to record this but I can you imagine this I'm in handcuffs
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.960]  and I'm getting booked in jail and the officers are telling us good job good job and they're
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:25.760]  chanting Bill the wall.
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:29.480]  See Laura that's the angle that you're smart lady smarter than I am anyways but that's
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:34.840]  like all the angles are the cops on average get the BS because they get lied about constantly
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:37.720]  because the left ones control of them not the cops are perfect they're like everybody
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:42.520]  else you know multifaceted but the left wants to bully police to get control of it because
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:47.600]  then we get a Soviet Union and they get the crime the Mexicans that are Americans they
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:51.280]  get that they want people vetted they don't want their kids in schools you know they're
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:55.920]  90% Hispanic and half the folks are citizens the other half aren't with TB and all this
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:01.600]  crap I mean people get it they came here to get away from the worst drugs and then people
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:08.360]  that came here legally are like called collaborators and stuff but no we want the coal miners and
[02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:13.800]  the scientists and the doctors and the farmers and the school teachers from Mexico or Guatemala
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:18.640]  we don't want your meth head lazy asses and most of the folks doing this this whole caravan
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:25.440]  are most of them are mulling drugs while they're at it right but it's not even just about Mexicans
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:30.280]  and Guatemalan people that's why I wore the sombrero in the poncho is because the Democrats
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:35.280]  have turned this into a oh well if you like 20% is other than Mexican in the filing there
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:41.000]  Islamists there's a lot of Muslims in the caravan too and they're finding prayer rods
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:46.200]  and carans in the desert and there's a lot of ISIS terrorists and Hamas and Hezbollah
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:50.600]  terrorists who are working with the caravan by the way finding a caran I'm done I didn't
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:54.480]  want to have the wars I'm not against the Muslims but they take over countries they
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:58.960]  don't let us live in their countries show if you find a caran it's like finding a cancer
[02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:06.480]  cell right I mean look we shouldn't be allowing this and so by by polarizing this issue and
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:11.160]  making it all about the Mexicans and trying to accuse Trump of being racist right they're
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:15.280]  ignoring you you saw Nancy Pelosi oh by the way Mexico is one of the richest countries
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:21.040]  in Latin America it's on the upper end I love Mexico I wish Mexico was richer in the US
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:24.840]  it's beautiful great people I love Mexicans I love their food I love it all I love the
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:28.880]  vibe I just wish they didn't have this one percent that are murdering killers that nobody
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:34.320]  can stop yeah and so that's why we wore ponchos and stuff is the pope fun at the left because
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:38.360]  they're obsessed with this idea that it's just Mexicans and they don't seem to understand
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:43.320]  that people from all backgrounds and all countries around the world especially islamic terrorists
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:48.880]  are using our border to come in and wearing a festive sombrero it just it means you're
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:54.400]  about to have some fun I mean let's the Mexicans don't have a fun let's do online yes so we
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:59.800]  had a fiesta in La Casa de Nancy and I told people I told you Alex live on the show about
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:04.560]  what a week and a half ago I said we were going to go to La Casa de Gavin and have another

[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:24.000]  a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:29.200]  you x2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:35.360]  research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:39.600]  and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two
[02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:47.640]  forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges it and makes it even more bio available ladies

[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:27.600]  dominating and i don't like to take his time up when he's all lined backered up and ready to
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:35.120]  really take it to the enemy but i'm gonna do it because in all of my peeling and mumbling which
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:42.240]  does happen in all of the inane babble there's some key words they do pick up in there i needed
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:46.880]  some documents printed before i covered this and that has not happened yet because you know i
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:52.080]  knew radically do not want to just tell you something i want to show you part of where i got it
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:50:03.040]  so i've already said this to the president in person and he did listen to me or maybe he did
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:08.800]  but they didn't do what he said once he gave the orders but there's nothing more frustrating than
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:23.120]  sitting here with platinum victory in your little hands in your hands thank you let me come back
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:29.120]  all the other articles thanks having platinum victory in your hands and everybody just thinks
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:38.080]  it's more of the chatter but you notice the globalist are crapping themselves to use family parlance
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:45.840]  to get me off the air and i'm gonna say it again i don't believe the globalist are that smart
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:51.040]  i don't believe you're that stupid
[02:50:53.360 --> 02:51:03.920]  that we have this information and that if they shut me down it shut down when these pieces of crap
[02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:08.320]  are executing this information in front of everybody
[02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:16.880]  but i'll cover it star the next hour and i'm going to go through it all but you've already
[02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:25.520]  heard it before but the star is just aligned do you know why there have been layoffs at more
[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:36.160]  than 20 major leftist fake news publications from buzzfeed to news week device why did all happen
[02:51:36.160 --> 02:51:44.240]  this week why did it happen a month ago or a month from now why wasn't it doled out because it's
[02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:55.120]  concerted it's like a bombing run with a group of bombers flying in and they've all got targets
[02:51:55.920 --> 02:52:05.200]  and they're all commanded by their hq see and by the way i don't just think that i have their
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:13.360]  blueprint i have their bombing run i have their attack profile i have their achilles and i'm here
[02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:20.720]  telling you their achilles i'm here telling you how to defeat them
[02:52:23.280 --> 02:52:31.040]  because i learned to study what the actual controllers do and you say well they shouldn't
[02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:45.280]  make it public then but something that big has a structure something that big has a wavelength
[02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:57.120]  something that big has a signature a slither real intelligence is observation real intelligence
[02:52:57.120 --> 02:53:06.240]  is infiltration real intelligence is interfacing banging heads with your enemy because you begin
[02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:15.600]  to know your enemy better than the enemy knows you all real warfare that's victorious is psychic
[02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:23.840]  it can be physical but that's only to draw out the essence of the enemy's goals
[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:33.040]  and their fears and then the commitment to meet your enemy with your goals and your love
[02:53:34.960 --> 02:53:42.240]  love trumps all but you have to realistically have the template of victory to be able to
[02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:51.280]  take it on you can't counter a civilizational ending event a planned viral demolition of humanity
[02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:59.680]  a earth ending termination of the birth of a new species a new vision a new world a new galaxy a new
[02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:09.600]  universe you can't counter something like that with lack of vision simply countering their program
[02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:17.200]  you must offer the world that you see and see if others believe in that world and see how they will
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:23.280]  then offer information to that world to build a new better world you have to recruit in a war
[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:30.480]  and to do that you need to look for people that aren't just trying to be in charge of something
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:38.080]  you need to look for people that want to be involved in something involved in something bigger than
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:44.480]  them not because they want to rule people but because they love people because they love their
[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:51.840]  ancestors and they love humanity and they have a vision that they want to add to in the future
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:59.040]  so that all the victories and the successes of our progeny when we're the ancestors when we're
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:06.880]  long gone we'll live on through those people in the future and the incredible challenges they face
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:15.680]  and the struggles and the love and the passion and the will as as we become stronger and stronger
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:23.200]  and stronger but then face greater and greater obstacles do you imagine that i want my guts
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:25.920]  my will
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:33.280]  to be with those people it's not out of some arrogance it's out of love it's not wanting to
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:38.080]  be in a tomb forever and dad it's wanting to be with my family forever
[02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:45.440]  wanting to be with you forever i want to live with you forever i want my genetics and my will
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:52.160]  and my spirit to commune with you forever and to experience all the majesty all the things
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:57.760]  god has planned for us in that banquet that goes on but the challenges that god faces and the
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:05.280]  missions god has for us in this little tinker toy level of a joke just the first level i'm not even
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:11.280]  sure that we get to higher levels that i'll even make the grade to be with you that's a big deal
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:20.640]  i'm too much like the enemy the final equation in fact i predict that at the end of the final
[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:26.880]  analysis i may not even be with you but it doesn't matter god uses evil for good as the propulsion
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:32.320]  system of the future and that's why these satanists fear me so much because they've bet on this planet
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:36.640]  and they've bet on their takeover and they think they're victorious and that's why
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:43.440]  i hate to plug products and the things we sell but everything we sell is good it's the best there
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:49.840]  is at the price it said and it funds what we're doing that's so fundamentally radical against
[02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:57.920]  the spirit of this world that it shakes the enemies of humanity to their very core
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:04.240]  and that's why i know we're gonna win in the end but i want to ask you to commit
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:11.040]  my word of mouth and my prayer in the public realm and in personal soul but also in the
[02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:18.080]  physical the energy you expend every day in the system to transfer part of that to us to know
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:24.800]  that there is a full commitment to push our will against the enemy with everything we've got and
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:31.440]  to lean in when their knives are stabbing into our guts to lean into their hate and just lean in
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:37.520]  and take it i'm ready and i'll lean in and i'll take it but i need your backing so that when i
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:44.000]  swing my sword it'll absolutely devastate the enemy when i raise my shield it's your will that

[03:00:11.680 --> 03:00:20.240]  is this some conspiracy crucified for no sins
[03:00:29.040 --> 03:00:36.160]  i was rereading these documents last week up up here late at night and i meant to do a whole show
[03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:47.760]  on it but i got distracted i got diverted and i i didn't cover it and then harrison smith has been
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:52.720]  hosting david night show great research reporter he came to me about 45 minutes ago and he said have
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:01:01.840]  you seen this have you seen this and i said yeah i actually have seen that and he said nobody's talking
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:12.880]  about this and that's so frustrating because we have their program in our hands and we know what
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:21.760]  they did we know how they ran it we know the scandal of obama putting billions
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:31.520]  billions of dollars into the defense department before he left
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:41.200]  a time bomb to do what you've seen happen and you know what i am so glad they expended
[03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:47.280]  80 percent of their propellant on me let me tell you i feel damn good right now
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:54.320]  that they spent most of the money and that's all they could do was get us off all these books
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:01:58.400]  but see that shows how scared they are because the old days they could sit hit men around and
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:02.400]  kill people but they know everything's surveilled they're all dishonorable they'll cattle on each
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:07.760]  other and they know how other things work and that there's other people that will do things if
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:14.880]  they do things and so they tried to assassinate my name my character and now you see the layoffs
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:19.600]  and they happened the week that the funding ended
[03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:29.200]  and that's why funding is so important you know i did two hours and i just you know i can't do it
[03:02:30.240 --> 03:02:33.680]  because you have ads that come on for radio networks all the rest of it that doesn't bring
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:40.160]  any of our funding i i'm covering some super hardcore thing i just can't go oh by the way
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:47.200]  let me tell you about fish oil even though fundamentally i want to say brain force is great
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:54.720]  i want to say turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with fish oil
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:03:04.720]  it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what i'm
[03:03:04.720 --> 03:03:14.480]  talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain body heart and we've got the best without all the
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:20.400]  mercury very expensive to produce to have the mercury taken out the cleanest the best out there
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:28.480]  we've got the children's we've got the adults we've got the krill oil and and and yeah you know
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:32.640]  they have the denatured stuff they claim doesn't give you burpees if you're going to get the full
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:37.440]  effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't give you the burpees but
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:42.480]  krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and i'm just sorry you want something like
[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:49.520]  this you don't get stuff for free um the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good in my view i'm
[03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:53.840]  not a medical statement here but let me tell you something that i eat five tablets
[03:03:53.840 --> 03:04:05.120]  of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing Santa Claus that night so your brain is made
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:12.800]  basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice i just
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:17.840]  obsessed because whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just can't do it i just i
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:23.760]  just see there's evil that lies constantly i can't lie it's seriously and i'm just telling you fish
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:28.320]  oil is like everybody knows it but i said god i ate a big fish tonight that's incredible dreams i
[03:04:28.320 --> 03:04:35.440]  feel great fish is magic fish is incredible and this is concentrated ultimate krill oil explosive
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:41.760]  insane psychoactive to the maximum it is next level and then you've got the well crafted ultimate
[03:04:41.760 --> 03:04:50.640]  fish oil it's amazing and you've got you've got the honor roll for children which we'll be right back
[03:04:56.800 --> 03:05:01.680]  when it comes to rebuilding your energy convenience is key while coffee candy and other sugary
[03:05:01.680 --> 03:05:07.120]  products can give you a short boost the crash can leave you more tired than ever turbo force from

[03:05:40.640 --> 03:06:08.720]  sluggish day don't let your day slow you down perk up with turbo force at infowarstore.com crashing
[03:06:08.720 --> 03:06:23.840]  through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[03:06:31.200 --> 03:06:37.520]  it's friday february first 2019 got her nick baggage one of the top scientists out there
[03:06:37.520 --> 03:06:43.520]  exposing the globalist decades before it became cool takes over in the next segment
[03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:51.120]  but i'll tell you why i love our crew because i'm about to break down something that is
[03:06:51.760 --> 03:07:00.480]  beyond central beyond core it's key meaning it turns the lock it changes the paradigm it is
[03:07:00.480 --> 03:07:15.280]  victory trump's strength is also his greatest weakness that's how paradoxes work he never ran
[03:07:15.280 --> 03:07:25.840]  for political office he aspired the highest position in the land he was able to make a lot of
[03:07:25.840 --> 03:07:32.240]  major deals work he turned the country around he got us out of the tpp he got some decent judges
[03:07:32.960 --> 03:07:37.040]  appointed he got millions of jobs back but they raised the interest rates and killed the recovery
[03:07:40.400 --> 03:07:43.600]  but my biggest frustration is in my conversations with the president
[03:07:47.120 --> 03:07:50.000]  and if i brought it up man the lawyers break in on the phone
[03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:56.640]  because all our phone calls been monitored he's like just amendment please he comes back a minute
[03:07:56.640 --> 03:08:04.480]  later is when i say mr president he embedded stay behind networks by obama two billion dollars
[03:08:04.480 --> 03:08:08.880]  john warren defense authorization act were established hundreds of millions of dollars
[03:08:09.440 --> 03:08:14.400]  was paid to operations against you it is the scandal that will bring them down sir
[03:08:14.400 --> 03:08:19.920]  very interesting alex how do you know that sir it's in the legislation
[03:08:22.400 --> 03:08:26.080]  people around you were scared they're hedging their bets for their families
[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:33.120]  your only way out of this is to go completely at them head on well alex i just wanted to thank you
[03:08:33.120 --> 03:08:38.080]  and can i talk to your wife or you just got remarried sir we're talking about your life here
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:42.080]  and then we have a 10 minute conversation when you actually like let's cut through it this is a
[03:08:42.080 --> 03:08:46.240]  real conversation i'm not here trying to go i'm talking to the president i'm talking to you about
[03:08:46.240 --> 03:08:52.080]  what's about to happen and then trump went and did research and found i was telling the truth
[03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:57.840]  began demanding briefings daily within six months into office of everything on info wars
[03:08:59.440 --> 03:09:04.320]  that's when kelly came in and they said we're quote banning info wars at the white house and
[03:09:04.320 --> 03:09:09.200]  that's when the craziness started all the lawsuits and things because they're like what are we going
[03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:17.760]  to do it's like ronald reagan when he was reading what people like congressman mcdonald were saying
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:24.080]  well they just killed mcdonald and they killed at the same time basically the father of the
[03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:30.080]  man we're about to have on a famous congressman who also stood up to this so i want us to understand
[03:09:30.080 --> 03:09:40.240]  this isn't netflix this isn't movies this isn't winnie the pooh okay this isn't star wars
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:47.440]  luke skywalker and on solo weren't really at los isley spaceport having a shootout but this
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:55.360]  this is happening so i'm gonna have baggage takeover and i'm gonna cover this more in shows tomorrow
[03:09:55.360 --> 03:10:02.240]  emergency broadcast that are they're important but i noticed this last week when the layoff
[03:10:02.240 --> 03:10:08.640]  started and then i forgot to cover it and then harrison smith one of our researchers came to
[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:12.480]  me he said have you noticed this the internet's talking about this well my god i'm glad they're
[03:10:12.480 --> 03:10:17.360]  finally talking about it because they didn't just illegally spy on trump as a candidate or as the
[03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:22.880]  nominee or as president-elect or as president and got caught doing it and got caught trying to wear
[03:10:22.880 --> 03:10:29.920]  wires and and all this crap and lied to congress lied to him lied to the courts that's jail time
[03:10:29.920 --> 03:10:44.400]  cut and dry they didn't just do that they put two billion dollars in the kitty for all the
[03:10:44.400 --> 03:10:52.640]  race war stuff everything you're seeing and a hundred and sixty million in one fund just a buzz feed
[03:10:53.360 --> 03:10:58.800]  and cnn and they went to these trusted quote reporters they lined them up i talked to folks
[03:10:58.800 --> 03:11:02.800]  that were there that's why they got so scared and banned me off twitter when i confronted
[03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:08.720]  oliver darcy and i said i know you're part of an infra guard infrastructure and i know you've
[03:11:08.720 --> 03:11:13.600]  been given a code key and national security clearance into google which is really run by the
[03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:19.920]  cia and the nsa that's on record and i said i told him the capital i said i know you're doing this
[03:11:19.920 --> 03:11:26.240]  against me and you're a rogue group which was criminal because it's in the law well it was
[03:11:26.240 --> 03:11:31.680]  pointed out to me that last week and that's in the new york times right here doc became shot police
[03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:40.320]  that those millions of dollars divvied up in 150 and 200 million dollar groups was divvied up and
[03:11:40.320 --> 03:11:49.840]  ended last week the funding all started in late january 2017 and ran for two years
[03:11:50.960 --> 03:11:55.920]  trump wouldn't listen trump wouldn't kill it he couldn't get the bureaucracy to kill it
[03:11:55.920 --> 03:12:02.640]  we know they're in full mutiny against him but still they didn't get the funding re-upped
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:11.360]  so the funding to cnn and buzzfeed and a bunch of other groups think of that list
[03:12:12.240 --> 03:12:17.280]  because that's under national security that's in defense authorization that's secret who the
[03:12:17.280 --> 03:12:22.960]  money went to we just know who they admitted think about the scandal richard nixon had a
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:30.240]  list of 100 people never used it for the rs they did this so here it is this is the new york times
[03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:34.480]  us senate panel case funds to fight online propaganda united states bolters fighting
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:38.480]  its foreign on propaganda major congress passed a portion of the national defense
[03:12:38.480 --> 03:12:45.120]  authorization act to pour 160 million into the effort over two years that was two years ago
[03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:50.240]  it was a glitch today showing the new day that's the york times two years ago so that funding
[03:12:50.240 --> 03:12:59.360]  in hr 5181 just ended there's the article that zero hedge reported on it back in december 2016
[03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:04.800]  obama quietly signs the countering disinformation of propaganda because see the outgoing president
[03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:14.240]  he signs the bill for the next two years it always staggers but next two years so see
[03:13:16.400 --> 03:13:24.880]  so that's what you've seen this whole thing has been our military interfacing with the newspapers
[03:13:24.880 --> 03:13:31.520]  and others to put out all this crazy crap with an elected president fighting
[03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:44.240]  propaganda funding that was put in place in december of 2016 that was enacted three days
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:53.040]  after he was elected january 23rd 2017 this is so epic this story that's hiding in plain view
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:58.800]  that if trump takes hold of this and takes action and wonders because he wouldn't stop it it was
[03:13:58.800 --> 03:14:04.240]  too complex he wouldn't do it but the fact now that this is known and that's why the layoffs
[03:14:04.240 --> 03:14:09.280]  are happening it's all confirmed nick vegas you're about to take over but uh your brother
[03:14:09.280 --> 03:14:15.360]  senator your father congressman you a scientist just looking at this how incredible is this that
[03:14:16.080 --> 03:14:20.720]  trump didn't take action but they didn't get it refunded because obama wasn't there they can't
[03:14:20.720 --> 03:14:27.520]  believe they got away with this trump has the keys to victory right here yeah you know the whole
[03:14:27.520 --> 03:14:33.840]  issue of propaganda you know and and here it is you know in plain sight like you say alex and
[03:14:34.400 --> 03:14:40.320]  you know this is the simplest form of manipulation of behavior mind control if you will you know is
[03:14:40.320 --> 03:14:48.080]  the idea that you can use the government the power of government to create propaganda what
[03:14:48.080 --> 03:14:55.360]  does propaganda mean in the 21st century it's not just advertising and sloganeering it's the deeper
[03:14:55.360 --> 03:15:02.160]  aspects of manipulating and moving the crowd so to speak so you have the manipulation of big data
[03:15:02.160 --> 03:15:08.800]  you have the manipulation of information itself and deciding what audiences are going to hear
[03:15:08.800 --> 03:15:16.800]  all of this sort of feeds that machine sure but there's the arrogance that they would get away
[03:15:16.800 --> 03:15:23.360]  with it i mean the fact that they did it is their waterloo if we just take action right and you know
[03:15:23.360 --> 03:15:28.720]  the the illusion of all this uh as we're going into the break is they created uh the panic over
[03:15:28.720 --> 03:15:35.680]  international terrorism international drug trafficking as a preload uh as the uh precursor to

[03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:35.920]  we adapt being slaves as the globalist once told me oh he won't adapt to defeat us he'll
[03:20:35.920 --> 03:20:40.960]  adapt being slaves roger stone has a judge that magically in dc out of 30 judges or so
[03:20:40.960 --> 03:20:47.680]  keeps getting chosen she gag orders people she doesn't let them fundraise she does all this
[03:20:47.680 --> 03:20:54.080]  let me fix my toupee i don't actually have a toupee but might as well judge considers gag
[03:20:54.080 --> 03:21:01.600]  order in roger stone case roger couldn't believe that actually try that because he makes a living
[03:21:01.600 --> 03:21:10.880]  as a commentator he used to be a commentator in fox news he was paid to lie hard a year and a half ago
[03:21:11.040 --> 03:21:17.840]  so now judge says she's considering imposing a gag order but hasn't made up her mind yet oh great
[03:21:17.840 --> 03:21:24.080]  yeah great she says she understood she does desire to tell a story but she had to ensure a fair trial
[03:21:24.080 --> 03:21:28.800]  that's right let the whole corporate media lie about him this is a criminal proceeding and not a
[03:21:28.800 --> 03:21:36.080]  public relations campaign well she could put a gag order on the trial which is what moeller's
[03:21:36.080 --> 03:21:42.880]  asking for but i'm gonna go back to this with dr nick baggage and let him take over but
[03:21:43.840 --> 03:21:47.840]  it's not like there's all these trillions of voices and all the stuff and everybody oh this
[03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:53.760]  is that this is it whatever we're actually in the zeitgeist we're what they want shut down
[03:21:53.760 --> 03:22:01.360]  and you have billions of dollars spent hundreds of millions per news agency to put out fake news
[03:22:01.360 --> 03:22:07.600]  the money ran out last week so all the layoffs are happening for folks that are on the anti america
[03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:20.080]  beat and that's sensational we have the keys to their defeat and now we've got that's all they
[03:22:20.080 --> 03:22:23.680]  want to saw fear they can't believe we have all this proof and they can't believe we're still
[03:22:23.680 --> 03:22:28.560]  on air and then i told roger's lawyers i said they're gonna gag your ass brother
[03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:33.920]  they said oh i can't believe that's so an american well get your butt ready
[03:22:35.440 --> 03:22:42.480]  get your get your ass ready come on in somebody wants to come in the come the studio come on in
[03:22:43.120 --> 03:22:47.680]  i know this this is used as a pathway in here might as well be the uh
[03:22:47.680 --> 03:22:56.480]  uh what the old old i-35 used to have a name the chism trail right here in the studio is
[03:22:56.480 --> 03:23:02.160]  a chism trail everybody's just march up and down the chism trail while i'm live on here
[03:23:02.160 --> 03:23:07.440]  because hell the average person's unconscious and half dead anyways so beyond roger stone
[03:23:07.440 --> 03:23:11.360]  beyond all this i'm gonna let you take over and i appreciate you being here dot dr nick baggage
[03:23:11.360 --> 03:23:18.080]  uh is that we just broke how they're laying everybody off because obama's funding
[03:23:18.640 --> 03:23:26.880]  to do this obama funded obama funding obama hadn't had had defense funding to attack
[03:23:26.880 --> 03:23:32.800]  trump just ended obama's defense department anti trump funding just ended i mean that's
[03:23:32.800 --> 03:23:37.600]  got to be big news but no one gives a damn it's just here on our show who gives a hell
[03:23:37.600 --> 03:23:43.360]  being while roger is about to be gagged i mean this is crazy so you take over for the rest of
[03:23:43.360 --> 03:23:48.720]  the hour from earth pulse dot com we really appreciate you and go ahead and thanks alex and
[03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:53.680]  you know this is the uh root of it you know when you start thinking about uh information and the
[03:23:53.680 --> 03:24:00.080]  age we're in uh the very control of information at the level in which it's manipulated today
[03:24:00.080 --> 03:24:04.960]  you know we talked about this uh decades ago in fact you know i was thinking about this today
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:09.440]  as we went into this program you know and it really began with this guy you know you remember
[03:24:09.440 --> 03:24:15.680]  this guy's book uh between two ages this is 49 years old almost a half a century day and it's
[03:24:15.680 --> 03:24:22.880]  the blueprint for the uh for the the way in which the world has reformed around technology
[03:24:22.880 --> 03:24:29.120]  uh the the technocracy that exists today was predicted and ushered in uh by as a big new
[03:24:29.120 --> 03:24:35.520]  bryzinski all those uh decades ago when he was working at columbia university he authored this
[03:24:35.520 --> 03:24:42.400]  later became national security advisor to president carter and this was sort of the beginning of
[03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:47.600]  where we were headed and this is where we're at today in fact he predicted the socioeconomic
[03:24:47.600 --> 03:24:52.800]  breakdowns uh the the rise of technologies the direction in which personal privacy would be
[03:24:52.800 --> 03:24:59.360]  uh shattered and you know going back even further you know back to the 50s and uh the predictions
[03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:06.560]  uh in things like 1984 right i mean it's worse than anything anyone ever imagined and and so
[03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:11.760]  obama leaves sort of the advanced funding for the deep state and i thought about too why are the
[03:25:11.760 --> 03:25:19.040]  social media and uh what i call the new age corporations the new ones the big mega trillion
[03:25:19.040 --> 03:25:25.280]  kazillion corporations the apples the googles uh the facebook's why are they attacking uh
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:31.520]  donald trump well think about the tax reform act that he just did for corporations that are
[03:25:31.520 --> 03:25:36.320]  domiciled and make most of their money in america was a great deal right i mean you lower the tax
[03:25:36.320 --> 03:25:42.960]  rate 20 made a more competitive they're making record profits as they as they file their taxes
[03:25:42.960 --> 03:25:48.080]  right now you know the next couple of months and corporate taxes should do the 15th of march so
[03:25:48.080 --> 03:25:54.000]  that's all being done right now people are going yeah who except for the googles and the facebook's
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:26:00.400]  and the apples because they had their profit centers out of america where trump's tax law
[03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:05.200]  is now getting 15 percent of their foreign income and that's the big market we're 300
[03:26:05.200 --> 03:26:10.400]  million in the u.s as a market and there's you know billions and billions you know to be served
[03:26:10.400 --> 03:26:15.680]  elsewhere you know as the saying goes so that's where they are so like things like this happened
[03:26:15.680 --> 03:26:20.640]  with even starbucks right they got caught no paying taxes anywhere because what they do is
[03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:25.520]  they put their intellectual property somewhere like ireland where they're taxed at five percent
[03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:30.960]  and then they charge their u.s corporations or british corporations other corporations these huge
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:36.320]  license fees that suck up all the net profit move it into ireland where they don't pay hardly any
[03:26:36.320 --> 03:26:41.680]  taxes or maybe it's to bahamas if they none at all so it's a shell game that the big guys get to play
[03:26:41.680 --> 03:26:46.800]  but that you know hey he stopped that now they got to pay some money back into the treasury it's
[03:26:46.800 --> 03:26:53.600]  still you know might be a little low but globalists don't like this and so they're the ones now
[03:26:53.600 --> 03:26:59.440]  with the trillion dollar companies putting the screws uh to donald trump because he actually
[03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:04.480]  made them treated corporations like people right the u.s supreme court did gave him free speech
[03:27:04.480 --> 03:27:10.320]  they can buy off elections now all over the country and influence our government even more but hey
[03:27:10.320 --> 03:27:16.960]  they don't want to pay the same deal on taxes and when uh the trump administration uh got that
[03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:23.120]  through the biggest tax reform act since ronald reagan hey let's wait and see what the tax take
[03:27:23.120 --> 03:27:27.920]  is at the end of the year because people who really do work in america save some money
[03:27:27.920 --> 03:27:33.200]  and when you get right down to it maybe that's why the attack is on and the other book i looked up
[03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:38.720]  recently before the show was this one and many people remember this one america what went wrong
[03:27:38.720 --> 03:27:44.720]  and this was uh the philadelphia's inquire uh stuff this was like the blueprint for ross perot's
[03:27:44.720 --> 03:27:51.040]  campaign in the early 90s this was done in 92 27 years old now all the stuff that says in here
[03:27:51.040 --> 03:27:58.720]  about america what went wrong are all the same issues we have right now 27 years later still
[03:27:58.720 --> 03:28:06.880]  not change in fact worse worse you know when you look at it the biggest reversal in the tax take
[03:28:06.880 --> 03:28:14.400]  to kind of equalize it uh is right now going on you know and it's going on uh with uh what trump
[03:28:14.400 --> 03:28:20.560]  did in the tax reform that took place let's let that play out you know job numbers just came out
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:26.800]  today the highest growth month in a hundred months of job growth running in the us of a
[03:28:27.520 --> 03:28:34.320]  hey hurrah for donald trump and uh the administration that made it happen and the momentum is just
[03:28:34.320 --> 03:28:41.040]  beginning we're headed into the break i i see the clock ticking away um but there's a lot more going
[03:28:41.040 --> 03:28:46.720]  on in the propaganda wars of the 21st century and when we get in the next section we'll get more

[03:34:15.600 --> 03:34:22.240]  people they're doing good work and working hard to keep you informed and really you know think
[03:34:22.240 --> 03:34:30.240]  about it again info wars you know this was like where alex began 25 years ago and here we are in
[03:34:30.240 --> 03:34:34.880]  the middle of it you know i mean propaganda info wars that's what it is all about you know when i
[03:34:34.880 --> 03:34:42.560]  look back on when i started about the same time 25 years ago you know my saying was my slogan was
[03:34:43.200 --> 03:34:50.000]  changing the way we see the world okay because why looked at it as hey same concept you know we need
[03:34:50.000 --> 03:34:55.200]  to take another look at what we're seeing and and kind of do our own interpretation because the one
[03:34:55.200 --> 03:35:01.520]  we were getting officially wasn't working and three generations in government my family in
[03:35:01.520 --> 03:35:07.760]  government um you know i mean the obvious was in you know in in our faces and the difference is
[03:35:07.760 --> 03:35:12.400]  you know when you're uh you know alex is going through a lot right now in terms of attack you
[03:35:12.400 --> 03:35:17.680]  know people are attacking him and it and it hurts i mean it hurts you're not invincible you know when
[03:35:17.680 --> 03:35:27.120]  people start beating you up it takes its toll but at the same time three generations of training
[03:35:27.120 --> 03:35:34.240]  you know you get what's called scar tissue for that and and it's and you have to get beyond it
[03:35:34.240 --> 03:35:41.600]  because what's important is the information and keeping us on message and not responding to every
[03:35:41.600 --> 03:35:47.120]  single attack but at some point this has got to go to the supreme court because what we're talking
[03:35:47.120 --> 03:35:55.840]  about here is silencing the very public debate that made america what it is today and you can
[03:35:55.840 --> 03:36:00.640]  argue could i hear these liberals arguing about whether it was ever great i think it was always
[03:36:00.640 --> 03:36:07.760]  great and because of the nature of the population we become better as a nation i would say you know
[03:36:07.760 --> 03:36:14.000]  i mean we did things i mean in 200 years before beside breaking free you know we got rid of things
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:23.760]  like indentured servitude slavery you know women's suffrage you know all these things happened around
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:30.240]  the world and in america in a really good way and here we are several hundred years later still a
[03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:36.160]  country still together but it was through discourse and sometimes really nasty we don't want to go back
[03:36:36.160 --> 03:36:45.520]  there to the 1860s for goodness sake we've we've i think grown beyond that but there's a lot to be
[03:36:45.520 --> 03:36:49.840]  debated in the way the country goes today when you think about the blueprints and i've mentioned
[03:36:49.840 --> 03:36:56.160]  before the break we were talking about between two ages by zebik new brzezinski and we pop that
[03:36:56.160 --> 03:37:03.440]  cover up on the screen and it's it's so timely because here we are 50 years a half a century later
[03:37:03.440 --> 03:37:08.960]  with his blueprint for the world which it really was because it's all happened it's like you you
[03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:14.880]  could read it today like it was a history book not realizing it was written 50 years ago predictably
[03:37:14.880 --> 03:37:20.480]  after it on what would happen with technology in the rise of it and the use of technology to
[03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:29.360]  manipulate human behavior specifically the ultimate propaganda tool being able to enter
[03:37:29.360 --> 03:37:34.080]  the awareness of people and manipulate you through your data fees to the information
[03:37:34.080 --> 03:37:41.440]  about you that's readily and easily available and if you look at the work that we did identifying
[03:37:41.440 --> 03:37:48.400]  this going back now now a couple of decades earth rising the revolution is carried by the
[03:37:48.400 --> 03:37:55.680]  info store this book written in 2000 was the blueprint for what's happening over 650 sources
[03:37:55.680 --> 03:38:01.680]  talking about privacy talking about biometrics voice recognition all of the things that you
[03:38:01.680 --> 03:38:08.080]  read about today in the mainstream media we reported on now 19 years ago and document it with
[03:38:08.080 --> 03:38:14.960]  with 650 footnotes that that make the case for where this would go well we're here now okay the
[03:38:14.960 --> 03:38:21.760]  warning is is over we are here now there's been many signaling this warning from every quarter
[03:38:21.760 --> 03:38:28.080]  you know alex has been at it we've been at it many many people around the world have been at it
[03:38:28.080 --> 03:38:34.240]  in terms of breaking the alternative story and this guy you know when you look at Bartlett
[03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:38.800]  and steel at the Philadelphia Inquirer when they put together that series of articles it became the
[03:38:38.800 --> 03:38:45.280]  book America what went wrong you know what was powerful in that was it really laid out in
[03:38:45.280 --> 03:38:50.640]  plain language for the blueprint for what happened and where we were today I think we need another
[03:38:50.640 --> 03:38:55.120]  one of those in fact I've started drafting one I'm going to put that book together here in the
[03:38:55.120 --> 03:39:00.320]  next few months because I think it's important you know something simple and direct that says
[03:39:00.320 --> 03:39:05.200]  here's the problem here's a set of solutions that are real solutions that we could actually debate
[03:39:05.200 --> 03:39:10.000]  maybe get somewhere on and and get that back out there you know approach it the same way
[03:39:11.520 --> 03:39:16.720]  have the information graphically make it available keep it simple so the message is clear
[03:39:16.720 --> 03:39:22.720]  on what we can do and then let's have a fight over the solution rather than just keep pointing out
[03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:28.960]  the problem you know and that's what we hear too much of all the way around and I know one thing
[03:39:28.960 --> 03:39:35.440]  about this country and I know one thing that made this country great from the very beginning was
[03:39:35.440 --> 03:39:42.640]  there are a lot of very very smart people and and and there are a lot of very smart people in
[03:39:42.640 --> 03:39:48.960]  this listening audience and every one of us has the power and capacity to create change in our
[03:39:48.960 --> 03:39:55.040]  neighborhoods our communities our families with our circle of influence whatever that is in summits
[03:39:55.040 --> 03:40:00.320]  some people think theirs is small and some people think theirs is really huge but let me tell you
[03:40:00.320 --> 03:40:07.840]  something it only takes one message at the right moment to the right person and every one of us
[03:40:07.840 --> 03:40:15.360]  could be delivering that not even realize it in fact I bet you we do every day so as an encouraging
[03:40:15.360 --> 03:40:24.240]  word in this matrix of nonsense and propaganda the info wars know the power of one that's what
[03:40:24.240 --> 03:40:31.280]  this country was based on the sovereignty of the individual living soul not a squishy collective
[03:40:31.280 --> 03:40:39.440]  but then out of that sovereignty came the came this great thing this great thing that we call
[03:40:39.440 --> 03:40:45.200]  the American experience the the experience we've had on this continent quite different
[03:40:45.200 --> 03:40:51.280]  than what was happening and what is happening in Europe my my friend finally escaped from
[03:40:51.280 --> 03:40:56.480]  Germany my business partner finally escaped I say escaped from Germany because his tax rate
[03:40:56.480 --> 03:41:07.760]  there is a living soul was 70 percent 70 percent you got to keep three cents you know out of every
[03:41:07.760 --> 03:41:13.360]  dime you know I mean come on but that's you know that he at least had the privilege and ability
[03:41:13.360 --> 03:41:17.120]  to leave because in Europe you can actually leave most of those places go down the South
[03:41:17.120 --> 03:41:22.160]  somewhere else and pay the taxes in the place you live you can't do that as an American
[03:41:22.160 --> 03:41:27.600]  American many people don't realize this you cannot leave the United States for tax reasons
[03:41:28.320 --> 03:41:35.120]  and the reason you can't leave for tax reasons is because of the State Department will not grant
[03:41:35.120 --> 03:41:40.240]  you permission and most Americans don't realize that the State Department to give up your citizenship
[03:41:40.240 --> 03:41:45.200]  should you ever want to you have to have permission just can't do it you just can't say
[03:41:45.200 --> 03:41:52.560]  I don't want to do this anymore no you don't get the right to do that you are shadow taxpayer
[03:41:52.560 --> 03:41:56.640]  consumer for the United States government whether you like it or not it's codified in law
[03:41:56.640 --> 03:42:01.040]  and now if you're a corporation you can leave whenever you want how the Burton did you know
[03:42:01.040 --> 03:42:08.080]  when they were about ready to get subpoenas filed and get into their war spending and how they
[03:42:08.080 --> 03:42:12.000]  squandered billions and billions and billions you could build the wall with what they probably
[03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:18.160]  stole just you know a little idea how much money went that direction and where did they go they I
[03:42:18.160 --> 03:42:21.360]  think they moved their headquarters out of Houston I think it went to Dubai where they don't have
[03:42:21.360 --> 03:42:26.080]  extradition treaties or warrants don't work you know you can hide everything and that's what's
[03:42:26.080 --> 03:42:33.920]  happened you know everybody's running everybody's running for cover because Donald Trump he needs
[03:42:33.920 --> 03:42:39.440]  to light it up man start issuing some subpoenas getting some records finding out what's going on

[03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:33.280]  again i i want to go back sort of again you know history always repeats itself um and i
[03:47:33.280 --> 03:47:42.400]  referenced a book uh so far in this uh program this friday um that's 49 years old another one
[03:47:42.400 --> 03:47:47.840]  27 years old the uh america what went wrong and this one i'm gonna this one i'm gonna
[03:47:48.880 --> 03:47:55.840]  reference now this book is a new american history by w.e. woodard that i'm holding up
[03:47:55.840 --> 03:48:01.920]  this one's hard to find this was 1936 and why it's important it's like pre world war two
[03:48:01.920 --> 03:48:09.840]  pre super industrial steroids uh on steroids revolution the united states but in this you go
[03:48:09.840 --> 03:48:15.600]  back to the beginning of income tax as a concept and taxation and what the debates were in banking
[03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:21.120]  and what was happening and it was what we're called the trust the morgan trust and others just
[03:48:21.120 --> 03:48:27.040]  referred to in those days as the trust included people like the guggenheims and the vanderbelts
[03:48:27.040 --> 03:48:33.040]  and the morgan's and all these wealthy families that had basically figured out ways to carry
[03:48:33.040 --> 03:48:40.400]  black bags full of money into the congress and bribe them and get a huge amounts of um um public
[03:48:40.400 --> 03:48:46.160]  good transferred their way uh in the case of the railroad you know one mid one mile wide railroad
[03:48:46.160 --> 03:48:51.600]  easements all the way to the west coast so that and then they controlled all the grain elevators and
[03:48:51.600 --> 03:48:56.800]  all the everything that farmers needed so they just broke the backs of these homesteaders that went
[03:48:56.800 --> 03:49:01.920]  out there and tamed all this and then these industrialists came in they charge them back
[03:49:01.920 --> 03:49:07.520]  to ordinary prices to load and carry their grain so they stripped out the profits and left the
[03:49:07.520 --> 03:49:12.640]  people in the midwest poor but that was the scandals of those days and money was hard to get
[03:49:12.640 --> 03:49:17.040]  and there was no real good clean banking system and people couldn't borrow and increase farms
[03:49:17.040 --> 03:49:22.720]  so this big deal happened where they fed us all a bunch of fertilizer again and then they create
[03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:28.160]  the income tax and they create the federal reserve banking system to break the trust and save america
[03:49:28.160 --> 03:49:33.760]  well look at this after over a hundred years the uh federal reserve never audited fully audited
[03:49:33.760 --> 03:49:38.560]  long overdue is ron Rand Paul and others and even my brother is a democrat one of the few
[03:49:38.560 --> 03:49:44.880]  democrats in the u.s senate when he was there uh demanding a federal reserve uh audit and uh
[03:49:44.880 --> 03:49:50.240]  Bernanke at the time calling him up screaming bloody murder you know and my brother said hey
[03:49:50.240 --> 03:49:54.160]  if you don't have anything to hide what's your problem you know and that was the end of the call
[03:49:54.160 --> 03:49:57.760]  but they never did it you know and it still isn't done that's something donald trump should have
[03:49:57.760 --> 03:50:03.360]  done a full audit of the federal reserve where'd the money go you know where's the money how much
[03:50:03.360 --> 03:50:08.080]  money was made how's it distributed what's the story american public needs to know this our
[03:50:08.080 --> 03:50:13.360]  economy not the federal reserves not 300 member bankers um a hundred years is too long to not
[03:50:13.360 --> 03:50:18.640]  be accountable but when you look at the situation with the banking and the multinationals the big
[03:50:18.640 --> 03:50:27.680]  guys of the day it's the same equation repeating itself this book 72 years old and and it's
[03:50:27.680 --> 03:50:34.000]  iterated the guy who wrote it was in his 50s 60s interviewing people first hand who remembered
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:41.200]  the civil war remembered the post-revolutionary period in the united states from the 1820s he
[03:50:41.200 --> 03:50:46.000]  interviewed the guys when they were still breathing that's why these older texts are so important
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:51.680]  they're not sanitized watered and you want to talk about propaganda look at the texas
[03:50:51.680 --> 03:50:57.760]  uh book repository and the way in which textbooks are developed and uh you want to read propaganda
[03:50:57.760 --> 03:51:06.160]  go read a modern history book for high school and then read this this is the one you should
[03:51:06.160 --> 03:51:12.320]  teach your children a new world history 1936 as a starting point because this is a really
[03:51:12.960 --> 03:51:18.080]  different way to see the world from the context of where with people were living at the time
[03:51:18.080 --> 03:51:23.360]  uh you know when i look back at again when ross perot ran you know which is the same
[03:51:23.360 --> 03:51:27.360]  sentiment people were sick and tired you know and then we got the watered down nonsense
[03:51:28.000 --> 03:51:37.360]  27 years uh from ross perot's run in the 90s uh to trump um all those years later and when you
[03:51:37.360 --> 03:51:43.760]  think about ross uh he was a quirky character really not fitting the normal mode mode but
[03:51:43.760 --> 03:51:49.280]  he was successful business he was way polite you know very polite man and i appreciate that about
[03:51:49.920 --> 03:51:57.040]  um mr perot uh but god we need someone like that again who's sharp uh it would be nice to
[03:51:57.040 --> 03:52:01.520]  see donald trump carry through on the rest of it you know what happened when america what went
[03:52:01.520 --> 03:52:07.440]  wrong was uh published is is just continued the amount of the corporate take and the amount of
[03:52:07.440 --> 03:52:12.640]  the average guy and the increase of the middle class it's just gotten significantly worse in
[03:52:12.640 --> 03:52:19.760]  that 27 years and um when you look at uh some of this again simple solutions for this age that's
[03:52:19.760 --> 03:52:25.280]  what's needed because right now you know abraham lincoln became a lawyer by just taking the bar
[03:52:25.280 --> 03:52:30.880]  exam because in those days um a little over 150 years ago you could carry the law under one arm
[03:52:30.880 --> 03:52:37.120]  in a couple of volumes and you could learn that today it's a three-story library called the law
[03:52:37.120 --> 03:52:43.760]  library nobody can know that how is a sovereign soul in america it's supposed to get justice
[03:52:43.760 --> 03:52:49.840]  when the regulations and laws that govern us are so complex that unless you have a master's
[03:52:49.840 --> 03:52:56.560]  or a phd you're probably not going to be able to figure it out um that is not justice you know if
[03:52:56.560 --> 03:53:02.720]  you want to talk about socializing something how about access to justice you know forget about
[03:53:02.720 --> 03:53:08.480]  medicine it's not enshrined in the constitution but think about um and i don't mean that really
[03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:14.000]  to forget about medicine but as a primary thing how about equal access to the courts and justice
[03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:19.040]  lawyers where you don't have to give up everything you've ever worked for and everything you'll ever
[03:53:19.040 --> 03:53:24.960]  make to defend yourself why should alex jones to defend his right to speak free speech have to
[03:53:24.960 --> 03:53:30.000]  spend what's going to turn into millions by the time it gets to the u.s supreme court and this
[03:53:30.000 --> 03:53:37.520]  stuff gets unraveled why should an individual ever have to do that to get justice in america
[03:53:38.480 --> 03:53:44.720]  why should we have to fight so hard for the fundamentals of who we are granted to us and
[03:53:44.720 --> 03:53:50.560]  enshrined in our constitution but if you're a corporation you get a proportional measure of
[03:53:50.560 --> 03:53:55.680]  justice directly proportionate stack of money next to you and that is not justice ladies and
[03:53:55.680 --> 03:54:01.840]  gentlemen that is not liberty that is not freedom and that is not a reflection of our founding
[03:54:01.840 --> 03:54:09.520]  fathers in the 21st century we sit over two centuries separation between the beginning
[03:54:09.520 --> 03:54:14.960]  and where we are today and we have drifted too far the wrong direction and the google's and the
[03:54:14.960 --> 03:54:24.880]  facebook's are now the tools the tools for a technocracy they couldn't do it on their own
[03:54:24.880 --> 03:54:29.360]  because every time they got caught with things like programs like total awareness where the
[03:54:29.360 --> 03:54:35.280]  pentagon want to look at every aspect of your life everything in your life with the big data
[03:54:35.280 --> 03:54:40.240]  that was being developed way before it became public instead they turned it over the private
[03:54:40.240 --> 03:54:47.120]  sector co-opted them and these very companies that enjoy the tax benefits of globalists who have
[03:54:47.120 --> 03:54:54.320]  picked your pocket now pick your privacy and have locked you in to the gulag of the 21st century
[03:54:54.320 --> 03:55:02.400]  which is a gulag of privacy where your information is taken from you stripped from you as if the
[03:55:02.400 --> 03:55:11.200]  gestapo had just kicked in your doorway and took all of your files because more data about you
[03:55:11.200 --> 03:55:17.280]  exist in the public sector out there in the public domain and then what government is collected
[03:55:17.280 --> 03:55:26.880]  it'll blow your mind and what it allows for is not just propaganda but full on manipulation
[03:55:26.880 --> 03:55:34.640]  of public opinion to the point that with without stripping this down and changing it this is going
[03:55:34.640 --> 03:55:40.720]  to end freedom and liberty as we know it in the 21st century this generation must decide
[03:55:40.720 --> 03:55:48.640]  the listeners of to this program must decide whether we are going to be free or in a digital
[03:55:48.640 --> 03:55:54.160]  slavery unlike anything we've ever experienced because we're headed that direction we can undo
[03:55:54.160 --> 03:56:00.640]  this we can undo this by insisting that we own our data that big companies no longer able to
[03:56:00.640 --> 03:56:09.040]  sell it or ask or even ask your permission you should not be able to be asked well will you
[03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:14.480]  well will you give up your rights today no you don't get the option you don't get to just throw
[03:56:14.480 --> 03:56:21.120]  them away you don't get to leave at the doorstep of democracy in this republic nope can't happen
[03:56:21.120 --> 03:56:28.160]  you can't ask and you can't do it because this is so much fundamental to who we are as sovereign
[03:56:28.160 --> 03:56:36.800]  human beings this strips us of our human dignity on every level no not allowed you cannot kick in
[03:56:36.800 --> 03:56:44.480]  our digital doorways anymore this is what needs to change we need to strip out of these mega
[03:56:44.480 --> 03:56:52.320]  corporations that use the very information that we are to compile profiles just like in china
[03:56:52.320 --> 03:57:00.800]  for a social score that then is fed back to us in propaganda on steroids to be by those selling
[03:57:00.800 --> 03:57:08.240]  a soap or those selling us crummy ideas and crummy concepts that we don't get to debate in
[03:57:08.240 --> 03:57:14.800]  the full light of day it's in the open debate that things change we can turn off the station
[03:57:14.800 --> 03:57:20.560]  we can change the channel that's our prerogative but we should never silence the voice of our
