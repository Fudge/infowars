[00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:05.954]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.954 --> 00:00:07.716]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.457]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:11.059]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.620]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.804]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:20.888]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.407 --> 00:00:26.509]  Welcome my friends welcome and thank you for joining us for another live transmission.
[00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:42.696]  It is the 6th day of August 2010 on this Friday Transmission coming up in the third hour Bob Chapman with his weekly visit on the economy and It's a good time to have him on July unemployment.
[00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:43.477]  We've lost 131,000 more jobs
[00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:57.508]  Government's now revised payrolls for May-June, show 97,000 fewer jobs than first reported, and the unemployment numbers are overall up, even in the Cook numbers.
[00:00:57.508 --> 00:01:02.452]  There's an odd mix of very bad news coming out, and stocks are tumbling.
[00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:23.613]  Meanwhile, they're spending tens of millions of dollars a day for Michelle Obama, or Marie Antoinette, as even the New York Daily News is calling her, to run all over Spain and take over entire sections of hotel rooms for them to celebrate different birthday parties and things.
[00:01:23.613 --> 00:01:27.656]  Just an illustration of how corrupt this society is.
[00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:32.800]  I have a whole bunch of really important news, but I've been on a week-long rant
[00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:39.988]  Taking very few calls, and so I want to sometimes mix things up a bit.
[00:01:39.988 --> 00:01:46.896]  I'm going to just not even get into the news, and I'm going to go directly to your phone calls for this full first hour.
[00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:55.244]  Then much of the second hour will be news interspersed with calls, and then of course Bob Chapman will be joining us.
[00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:59.362]  I'm gonna be honest with people.
[00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:05.144]  When I get in my yelling, screaming mode, and start hyperventilating, it's just because I'm desperate.
[00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:07.065]  I'm upset.
[00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:17.169]  I'm very distraught over the fact that we've analyzed things correctly, that we've been right all along, and that things are actually worse than I'd always thought.
[00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:22.592]  We just have a completely evil government, run by completely wicked corporations,
[00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:38.050]  I have to watch the news everywhere reporting on the altruism, the quote, charity of the philanthropy of the 40 billionaires of the United States putting their money into a tax-free foundation.
[00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.896]  I see them praising George Soros, Ted Turner, Bella Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, all anti-freedom globalists.
[00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.423]  Elena Kagan has been confirmed to the Supreme Court, as you know.
[00:02:49.423 --> 00:02:51.425]  Openly anti-free speech.
[00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:54.008]  Viciously anti-Second Amendment.
[00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:56.370]  Viciously anti-family.
[00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.152]  Viciously anti-sovereignty.
[00:02:58.152 --> 00:03:03.878]  And I know the Rockefellers, more than a hundred years ago, invented philanthropy.
[00:03:05.523 --> 00:03:07.864]  Because people kept pointing out they gave no money to charity.
[00:03:07.864 --> 00:03:13.966]  They had giant monopolies and were routinely murdering entire towns of people whenever they wanted their property.
[00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:29.933]  Oh yeah, the Rockefellers are so powerful, even over 100 years ago, they would just, from Pennsylvania to Colorado to California, you could just type in Rockefeller-funded massacre and read mainstream media reports, university history.
[00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:39.594]  But they know the spirit of resistance was defeating them, so they had to then start posing in the last hundred years as philanthropists.
[00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:55.922]  And then we have the Tax-Free Foundation hearings in the 50s, 60s, and 70s in Congress that found that the Carnegie Endowment for Peace is really the Carnegie Endowment for War, that the Rockefeller Foundation is hell-bent on drugging the water supply.
[00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:58.663]  There's another Rockefeller Foundation report from the 60s
[00:04:00.253 --> 00:04:22.012]  That one of our great writers pulled up, I mean they're just unlimited, unlimited, for all intents and purposes, that one of our writers pulled up the quotes about how they were going to drug the water supply and the vaccines with viruses that carry a hormone on their back so your body creates an autoimmune response to that.
[00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.620]  I mean, I don't like doing this radio show.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.442]  You understand this isn't about entertainment.
[00:04:32.442 --> 00:04:36.425]  It's not about any of that.
[00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:39.167]  This is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:50.216]  And I'm watching these people, like Ted Turner, who invested a billion bucks in the UN and has made close to a billion back on top of it because it's tax-free.
[00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:51.577]  It's a scam.
[00:04:51.577 --> 00:04:53.638]  They're not giving any of their money away.
[00:04:53.638 --> 00:04:55.440]  They are tax-free.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.501]  Get the joke?
[00:04:57.501 --> 00:04:58.142]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.783 --> 00:05:05.045]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:08.909]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.372]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.372 --> 00:05:17.079]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:23.327]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:23.727 --> 00:05:29.691]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:33.894]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:33.894 --> 00:05:38.177]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.177 --> 00:05:44.122]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.122 --> 00:05:47.684]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:47.684 --> 00:05:49.665]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:50.106]  It's here.

[00:05:59.468 --> 00:06:03.669]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:10.070]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:17.451]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:22.332]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:06:27.293 --> 00:06:31.035]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:06:31.035 --> 00:06:33.336]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:06:53.354 --> 00:06:53.815]  Thank you!
[00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:04.996]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:04.996 --> 00:07:13.858]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:13.858 --> 00:07:18.499]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:29.301]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:39.443]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:39.443 --> 00:07:44.885]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:44.885 --> 00:07:52.366]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:55.127]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:06.323]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[00:08:06.323 --> 00:08:10.404]  Some men you just can't reach.
[00:08:10.404 --> 00:08:15.646]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:16.546]  Well, he gets it.
[00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:20.087]  I don't like it any more than that.
[00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:28.497]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:28.497 --> 00:08:31.297]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.297 --> 00:08:33.898]  Look at your young men fighting.
[00:08:33.898 --> 00:08:37.399]  Look at your women crying.
[00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:40.440]  Look at your young men dying.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.221]  The way they've always done before.
[00:08:44.221 --> 00:08:46.962]  It is Friday, the sixth day of August 2010.
[00:08:49.016 --> 00:08:51.537]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:51.537 --> 00:08:57.841]  Masses of vital news and information will be covered today.
[00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:01.723]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the...
[00:09:02.984 --> 00:09:06.947]  Hours of this transmission, the toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:10.330]  1-800-259-9231 to talk about any of the issues that are out there.
[00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.852]  There's a major national poll that's been conducted we're going to be covering.
[00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:17.976]  Six in ten Americans don't believe Obama was really born in the United States.
[00:09:31.434 --> 00:09:36.376]  That's a full-spectrum poll of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.
[00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:41.479]  The globalists have failed, and failed miserably, but only on one level.
[00:09:41.479 --> 00:09:53.144]  He is nothing but a shield, just like an ancient gladiator or Roman centurion would have a shield, and when it was bashed in and used up, they would throw it down.
[00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:56.479]  We're going to cover all of this news today.
[00:10:18.544 --> 00:10:38.969]  Throughout the week, I have been pleading with the public to look at these new classes of viruses that we've talked about for a decade, but that they're now rolling out against the public, that go in and attack the neurons, the receptors, and that render you basically helpless, where you cannot become angry, where you cannot engage in self-preservation.
[00:10:38.969 --> 00:10:43.450]  Sodium fluoride does the same thing.
[00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.971]  So does lithium, and they're pushing all that in the water.
[00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:53.503]  But I do want to get into a whole bunch of other news that we haven't really gotten into this week that's been breaking.
[00:10:53.503 --> 00:10:58.106]  And people keep emailing me and asking me, what do you think about the mosque at Ground Zero?
[00:10:58.106 --> 00:11:02.710]  They keep calling me, you know, saying, what do you think about all these different Democrats getting indicted?
[00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.851]  They're just all a bunch of crooks.
[00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:09.495]  As for the mosque at Ground Zero, I've actually researched it.
[00:11:09.495 --> 00:11:12.217]  It's a very complex issue, but overall it's a distraction.
[00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:16.758]  from the big news that affects us all.
[00:11:16.758 --> 00:11:20.860]  It is a liberal Muslim group that is building it.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:28.224]  That is kind of a World Council of Churches type organization connected into the United Nations.
[00:11:28.224 --> 00:11:32.606]  And that's why you've got liberal Jewish groups that support it in New York City.
[00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:33.707]  They're in lower Manhattan.
[00:11:33.707 --> 00:11:36.308]  The ADL does not support it.
[00:11:36.308 --> 00:11:38.770]  They're just playing along with the
[00:11:40.247 --> 00:11:48.372]  The clash of civilizations propaganda that all Muslims want to kill the American people.
[00:11:48.372 --> 00:11:55.157]  When in truth, on record, our government for 50 plus years has been trying to put radical Muslims in power.
[00:11:55.157 --> 00:11:58.779]  They don't want mainline first world countries over there.
[00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:09.526]  They want to overthrow westernized nations and put in radicals that they can then have a pretext to have wars with.
[00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:27.492]  But I do think because of the massive backlash against the mosque at Ground Zero, that the group is playing into the propaganda.
[00:12:27.492 --> 00:12:31.476]  And it of course fits into the idea that Muslims carried out the attacks of 9-11.
[00:12:31.476 --> 00:12:31.876]  And I'm sorry.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:34.820]  I don't know.
[00:12:55.233 --> 00:13:01.456]  That's AP, UPI, Fox News, Haaretz, Jerusalem Post even admit that.
[00:13:01.456 --> 00:13:02.817]  It's just hidden in plain view.
[00:13:02.817 --> 00:13:03.817]  We know that U.S.
[00:13:03.817 --> 00:13:12.821]  forces were massing around Afghanistan and that Bush had signed the launch order to begin the invasion in the next two months on September 10th.
[00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:14.802]  We do know NORAD stood down.
[00:13:14.802 --> 00:13:20.145]  The CIA ran drills of the exact same targets being attacked at the exact same time so that the
[00:13:23.151 --> 00:13:32.894]  Different federal agencies like NORAD and the Federal Aviation Administration would become confused.
[00:13:32.894 --> 00:13:34.255]  The list goes on and on.
[00:13:34.255 --> 00:13:39.096]  We know that they blew up Building 7 in front of everyone and said, get back, we're blowing it up.
[00:13:39.096 --> 00:13:44.098]  We have all the countless newscasts reporting that.
[00:13:44.098 --> 00:13:46.338]  So there, I've talked about the mosque.
[00:13:46.338 --> 00:13:50.860]  I mean, I really hope people don't call in about it because it's overall a distraction.
[00:13:52.844 --> 00:14:07.629]  We have all this incredible financial news coming out that Social Security is insolvent and is in the red, that unemployment is much worse than the government had said, that we never came out of the recession, that we're in a depression.
[00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:18.953]  The banks that engineered this collapse to gain more power have openly given expanded power, and so has the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:14:18.953 --> 00:14:20.214]  I've got it all here in front of me.
[00:14:21.288 --> 00:14:23.951]  There's positive news.
[00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:35.062]  Mexico was spurred by the United States in the last four years to be given more than $15 billion a year of U.S.
[00:14:35.062 --> 00:14:45.052]  tax money to launch military operations against four major cartels that are not laundering their money through Federal Reserve-controlled banks.
[00:14:46.505 --> 00:14:50.707]  I remember the similar situation in 99 in Columbia.
[00:14:50.707 --> 00:14:54.449]  Grasso at the time, the head of the New York Stock Exchange, was in Reuters.
[00:14:54.449 --> 00:15:01.333]  He traveled to meet with the head of the FARC and openly in the news said, you will invest your money with us or we will have the U.S.
[00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:04.094]  Marine Corps and Army invade you.
[00:15:04.094 --> 00:15:09.577]  The head of the FARC said no and was killed right after that, very soon after that, and the invasion began.
[00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:15.260]  And it's the same thing, but Mexico is losing the war against the cowboy cartels.
[00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:21.259]  And the US-backed gangs, and that is imploding.
[00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:27.443]  And so Mexico is now so desperate that they are talking about full legalization of drugs.
[00:15:27.443 --> 00:15:31.765]  And of course, the cartels are now threatening to kill any politicians that try that.
[00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:36.828]  Drug dealers do not want drugs legalized, and that's a very simple thing to understand.
[00:15:39.383 --> 00:15:43.005]  They want to keep it illegal so they make large profits in the black market.
[00:15:43.005 --> 00:15:55.151]  But that's in the guarding and Mexico looks to legalize drugs as the drug war murders hit 28,000 and counting and spills across into the southwestern United States from Texas to California.
[00:15:55.931 --> 00:16:02.835]  And all points in between as far north as Illinois, they're having serious gang war problems with this.
[00:16:02.835 --> 00:16:09.638]  And there's more and more even Republicans and not just Democrats calling for legalization, decriminalization of narcotics.
[00:16:09.638 --> 00:16:17.842]  Not because narcotics are good, but because 80 years ago when they were sold on store shelves everywhere, you had far less people using them.
[00:16:17.842 --> 00:16:20.524]  Only losers were on laudanum, opium.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:27.927]  Only losers drank three or four Coca-Colas a day and had heart attacks doing it because it was full of cocaine.
[00:16:27.927 --> 00:16:29.909]  It's called Coke, hidden in plain view.
[00:16:29.909 --> 00:16:34.294]  I get emails every time I say Coca-Cola and the past had cocaine in it.
[00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:35.235]  It's called Coke.
[00:16:36.984 --> 00:16:41.365]  The magic flavor, the secret ingredient, is decaf Coke.
[00:16:41.365 --> 00:16:46.106]  Just like you have decaf coffee, they decoconate cocaine.
[00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:49.407]  But the molecules still have some of the same effects.
[00:16:49.407 --> 00:16:51.687]  That's why you like Coke and Pepsi.
[00:16:51.687 --> 00:16:57.368]  It's not just the luscious, cancer-growing corn syrup that imbibes them.
[00:16:57.368 --> 00:17:00.589]  It is the decoconated cocaine.
[00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:01.349]  Coke!
[00:17:01.349 --> 00:17:04.050]  It's called Coke-a-Cola!
[00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:04.990]  Cocaine-a-Cola!
[00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:07.962]  I know you think it's a conspiracy.
[00:17:07.962 --> 00:17:08.902]  I understand.
[00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:09.923]  But it's a fact.
[00:17:09.923 --> 00:17:11.283]  It's a historical fact.
[00:17:11.283 --> 00:17:12.184]  Coke.
[00:17:12.184 --> 00:17:13.644]  Coke is it.
[00:17:13.644 --> 00:17:14.965]  Coke is it.
[00:17:14.965 --> 00:17:16.626]  Coke is it.
[00:17:16.626 --> 00:17:18.687]  Decriminalize now.
[00:17:18.687 --> 00:17:21.728]  Take the Federal Reserve's main cash crop away.
[00:17:21.728 --> 00:17:23.549]  Decriminalize opium.
[00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:25.810]  Our troops will stop dying in Afghanistan.
[00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.851]  They're openly growing it now.
[00:17:27.851 --> 00:17:28.571]  I'm already ranting.
[00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:33.972]  We're going to take your calls now throughout this hour and much of the next.
[00:17:33.972 --> 00:17:34.972]  I've got all this news.
[00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:41.713]  We will cover it all, like Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass scale fertility reduction.
[00:17:41.713 --> 00:17:46.954]  That's an InfoWars.com story by one of our great writers.
[00:17:46.954 --> 00:17:52.875]  But if you simply go and read it, it's links to the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:53.915]  Okay.
[00:17:53.915 --> 00:17:59.396]  There's a reason your wife can't get pregnant.
[00:17:59.396 --> 00:18:00.036]  There's a reason.
[00:18:03.643 --> 00:18:06.065]  There's a reason the sperm counts down by 85%.
[00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:13.970]  I mean, we're not just up here on air saying this to entertain you.
[00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:24.737]  Every day I see 5, 10, 15, depending on the day, or more articles where it's on record that they know that we know that they're poisoning us and sterilizing us.
[00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:27.258]  So now they're coming out saying, yeah, it's a good thing.
[00:18:27.258 --> 00:18:28.659]  We love you.
[00:18:28.659 --> 00:18:30.961]  We're going to give you a shot so you can't get angry at us.
[00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:35.384]  Of course this criminal government is drugging the water.
[00:18:35.384 --> 00:18:40.248]  Of course they're storing the naked body scans of you at the airport and bathing in radiation.
[00:18:40.248 --> 00:18:46.813]  Of course they take your baby's blood as part of a secret UN program and it's now all over the news, admit it.
[00:18:46.813 --> 00:18:52.577]  Of course it's all real.
[00:18:52.577 --> 00:18:54.458]  They think you're stupid.
[00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:57.741]  They think they can get away with bloody murder here.
[00:18:59.141 --> 00:19:04.505]  They think they can get away with taking people's insurance policies when they die now.
[00:19:04.505 --> 00:19:06.567]  Mainly the troops.
[00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:10.490]  Somebody in the Army or the Marines gets their head blown off.
[00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.551]  Mama's got two little kids at home.
[00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:17.895]  Daddy ain't coming home except in a pine box.
[00:19:17.895 --> 00:19:21.378]  With his ribbons pinned upon his chest, tell his mom he done his best.
[00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:28.320]  What do the insurance companies do?
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.721]  We're just going to keep your money.
[00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:31.902]  We run all the regulators.

[00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:07.891]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:19.978]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:22:59.946 --> 00:23:03.487]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:03.487 --> 00:23:05.768]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:05.768 --> 00:23:06.648]  Don't!
[00:23:06.648 --> 00:23:10.090]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[00:23:46.995 --> 00:23:48.156]  They don't want to see us
[00:24:08.928 --> 00:24:13.311]  All right, let's go straight to your phone calls.
[00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:17.033]  Let's talk to Sarah in Idaho.
[00:24:17.033 --> 00:24:18.895]  You're on the air, Sarah.
[00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:20.115]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[00:24:20.115 --> 00:24:21.236]  Hi.
[00:24:21.236 --> 00:24:25.139]  I just I want to tell you thank you for all you do, first of all.
[00:24:25.139 --> 00:24:27.760]  And I am just really glad to be able to talk with you.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:37.607]  But I'm really excited for what you're doing about the vaccine awareness and the water, you know, tap water awareness of stopping water fluoridation.
[00:24:38.214 --> 00:24:47.179]  And I wanted to share with the listeners, um, I just started a blog and I'm hoping that, um, we can catch some more people to get involved with it.
[00:24:47.179 --> 00:24:49.880]  It's called Mothers Opposing Toxins.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:25:02.167]  And, um, I just, I'm just glad that, you know, you're talking out about it, but, um, it has a lot to do with, you know, the fluoride and the vaccines and just giving parents a voice.
[00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:04.188]  Well, give us your blog!
[00:25:04.188 --> 00:25:07.630]  Yeah, it's, um, it's Mothers Opposing Toxins.
[00:25:11.255 --> 00:25:25.520]  And I just started it, so I'm just, you know, a mom that is trying to help use my voice if I can, and I have a lot of opponents that I'm up against, as you know.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:36.444]  And just, you know, I'm thankful for people like you and Dr. Tenpenny and Mr. Daniel Stockin, and so I just want to, you know, and also to note on that,
[00:25:36.883 --> 00:25:42.568]  I read the book The Fluoride Deception by Christopher Bryson, and anybody that hasn't read that book should read it.
[00:25:42.568 --> 00:25:44.209]  It's a great book.
[00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:45.510]  Well, God bless you, Sarah.
[00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.252]  Keep it up.
[00:25:47.252 --> 00:25:48.513]  I want to commend the listeners.
[00:25:49.568 --> 00:25:50.929]  We were successful again.
[00:25:50.929 --> 00:25:51.929]  We're eight for eight.
[00:25:51.929 --> 00:26:02.074]  Every time we give out a keyword on air, it becomes the number one search term because of you taking action with that information and entering it into Google and Yahoo search engines.
[00:26:02.074 --> 00:26:08.978]  And the term poison tap water was number one yesterday, but something really frightening happened.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.807]  In fact, I actually IM'd you guys these stories.
[00:26:13.807 --> 00:26:18.016]  I've got it in my stack here and later I'm going to go over this.
[00:26:18.016 --> 00:26:21.343]  A whole bunch of blogs on purpose.
[00:26:23.427 --> 00:26:49.684]  wrote stories using the term poison tap water and then said yes there is poison in the tap water and fluoride reverses it fluoride will save you and so now the system is countering with disinformation operations in live time when we give a term out and those articles saying that fluoride is good for you and gets the poison out of the water multiple articles by multiple so-called news agencies
[00:26:50.524 --> 00:26:59.854]  These were actual news sites, not just blogs, putting out very wicked disinformation, showing that the system is concerned and
[00:27:02.139 --> 00:27:04.902]  I just hope people will go to InfoWars.com.
[00:27:04.902 --> 00:27:09.847]  It's posted in several articles we wrote yesterday, one of them titled, Poisoned Tap Water Makes No.
[00:27:09.847 --> 00:27:11.028]  1 Google Search.
[00:27:11.028 --> 00:27:25.243]  And you can download this flyer and post it in public places saying there is poison in the tap water, and then under it it's got all the facts about it and how deadly poisonous it is and how it causes bone cancer and other deathly dangerous problems.
[00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:36.335]  If our millions of listeners go out and post these, it's going to become a major news story and it's just one more example of resistance.
[00:27:36.335 --> 00:27:39.256]  Let's go to Chris in Texas.
[00:27:39.256 --> 00:27:40.797]  Chris, you're on the air.
[00:27:40.797 --> 00:27:42.478]  Hey Alex Jones, how are you?
[00:27:42.478 --> 00:27:43.539]  I'm good buddy.
[00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:48.321]  Prison Planet member, subscriber, which by the way is a great website.
[00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:51.483]  You've got so much awesome information on there and so many great videos.
[00:27:51.483 --> 00:27:54.425]  People really ought to just support it by subscribing.
[00:27:54.425 --> 00:27:55.986]  It's not expensive at all.
[00:27:56.366 --> 00:28:00.887]  But anyway, I'm a teacher here in Texas, and I was having a conversation yesterday with a former student.
[00:28:00.887 --> 00:28:02.787]  They still come back and visit me occasionally.
[00:28:02.787 --> 00:28:07.888]  I teach the higher-end, AP-caliber students who go off to pretty prestigious universities.
[00:28:07.888 --> 00:28:10.068]  And he was telling me about all this stuff yesterday.
[00:28:10.068 --> 00:28:10.708]  It was amazing.
[00:28:10.708 --> 00:28:12.809]  You know, he just brought up the Federal Reserve.
[00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:15.289]  He brought up all these topics.
[00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:22.951]  And contrary to that, I had a conversation with a student that went off to Princeton and is at the Woodrow Wilson, the prestigious Woodrow Wilson School.
[00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:25.591]  And he comes back and talks to me, and he's a complete globalist!
[00:28:27.182 --> 00:28:29.823]  Really, he came back and told you how great it was?
[00:28:29.823 --> 00:28:31.904]  Oh yeah, it was an amazing contrast.
[00:28:31.904 --> 00:28:37.726]  One kid, you know, he's at A&M here in Texas, you know, he's a bright kid, very smart, lit major kind of kid.
[00:28:37.726 --> 00:28:42.348]  But the other one, the one at Princeton, at the Woodrow Wilson School, we come back, I have a three-hour argument with this kid.
[00:28:42.348 --> 00:28:43.849]  He's a complete globalist.
[00:28:43.849 --> 00:28:52.333]  When he left, when he left me, when he graduated, that is, he was, you know, you'd probably consider him a standard neocon type.
[00:28:52.333 --> 00:28:55.594]  He supported the war, but he also had a lot of constitutional
[00:28:56.307 --> 00:28:59.341]  You know, principles that he embedded in his ideas when he was a young kid.
[00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:08.957]  He comes back now and he's, you know, he's, you know, he got to have lunch with Howard Dean and, you know, you could see them, you know, you could see them being wooed into this.
[00:29:08.957 --> 00:29:22.348]  Well, they, I mean, they put them in these peer pressure areas and they had a CNN piece last night about 40 billionaires giving half their money and you go study it, it says after three secret meetings they've decided to give half their money.
[00:29:22.348 --> 00:29:27.973]  Well, we have the separate articles about what went on in those secret meetings from the Financial Times of London and others.
[00:29:28.593 --> 00:29:33.336]  And it says, for eugenics, forced population reduction.
[00:29:33.336 --> 00:29:41.602]  And they had Peter Singer from Princeton in the piece saying how great it was and how it was going to help the poor.
[00:29:41.602 --> 00:29:42.423]  Stay there, Chris.
[00:29:42.423 --> 00:29:44.664]  I want you to be able to finish your statement on that.
[00:29:44.664 --> 00:29:46.746]  Then we're going to go to Frank, Mike, Damon, and others.
[00:29:46.746 --> 00:29:50.268]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.268 --> 00:29:51.669]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:54.211]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.211 --> 00:29:56.873]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.673 --> 00:30:04.215]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.215 --> 00:30:05.136]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:08.558]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.558 --> 00:30:09.418]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.418 --> 00:30:14.301]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.301 --> 00:30:15.041]  It's true.
[00:30:15.041 --> 00:30:19.923]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:19.923 --> 00:30:20.744]  Number 3.
[00:30:20.744 --> 00:30:24.326]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.326 --> 00:30:28.248]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.248 --> 00:30:28.508]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.028 --> 00:30:31.791]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:31.791 --> 00:30:35.075]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.075 --> 00:30:40.601]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:45.467 --> 00:30:49.631]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:02.581 --> 00:31:06.363]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:31:06.363 --> 00:31:09.244]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:31:09.244 --> 00:31:14.626]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:26.232]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.

[00:31:39.258 --> 00:31:41.059]  Get yourself and your family ready today.

[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:04.403]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:32:04.403 --> 00:32:05.384]  What have we got?
[00:32:05.384 --> 00:32:07.845]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:32:07.845 --> 00:32:08.846]  A republic.
[00:32:08.846 --> 00:32:11.488]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:32:11.488 --> 00:32:13.769]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:32:13.769 --> 00:32:15.790]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.471]  So they think they own our land?
[00:32:17.471 --> 00:32:18.772]  They think they own our water?
[00:32:18.772 --> 00:32:19.392]  Children?
[00:32:19.392 --> 00:32:20.513]  Our education?
[00:32:20.513 --> 00:32:21.354]  Our money?
[00:32:21.354 --> 00:32:24.996]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:32:25.356 --> 00:32:30.342]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:32:30.342 --> 00:32:31.363]  We have the facts.
[00:32:31.363 --> 00:32:32.525]  We have the Constitution.
[00:32:32.525 --> 00:32:33.426]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:32:33.426 --> 00:32:34.307]  We have common law.
[00:32:34.307 --> 00:32:36.830]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.614]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:32:40.714 --> 00:32:43.015]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:08.917 --> 00:33:22.544]  In the heart of the resistance, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:22.544 --> 00:33:27.446]  Alright, going back to Chris, a school teacher here in Texas.
[00:33:27.446 --> 00:33:29.187]  He just joined us.
[00:33:29.187 --> 00:33:30.488]  He was talking about one student.
[00:33:31.448 --> 00:33:38.191]  Coming back to visiting from college, who's awake to the new world order, and another coming back and saying, look, I'm part of the elite now.
[00:33:38.191 --> 00:33:40.172]  You know, I want globalism.
[00:33:40.172 --> 00:33:50.797]  Well, we've seen what globalism does, but I remember seeing an interview with Albert Speer, the head of the interior ministry for Adolf Hitler.
[00:33:50.797 --> 00:33:54.019]  He's one of the few top Nazis to not be imprisoned or executed.
[00:33:55.185 --> 00:33:55.425]  I think?
[00:34:18.032 --> 00:34:30.142]  Flown out to a meeting and they go up to the top of a big skyscraper in a huge office with a beautiful secretary bringing them coffee and they get brought in and told they're gonna be given power and that they're special.
[00:34:30.142 --> 00:34:33.324]  Most people don't even think about selling out.
[00:34:33.324 --> 00:34:35.186]  It's not even a thought that they're selling out.
[00:34:35.186 --> 00:34:37.728]  They just, wow, this is success.
[00:34:37.728 --> 00:34:41.771]  The ladder drops down and they just start climbing it.
[00:34:43.709 --> 00:34:50.952]  And it's the same with academics, with people in banking, people in media, people in law enforcement.
[00:34:50.952 --> 00:34:52.772]  You better think twice, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:52.772 --> 00:34:55.593]  You better think about the world and what it's offering you.
[00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:59.935]  And if something looks too good to be true, it is.
[00:34:59.935 --> 00:35:01.536]  It is.
[00:35:01.536 --> 00:35:03.697]  The road to liberty is a hard road.
[00:35:03.697 --> 00:35:04.657]  You're going to be attacked.
[00:35:05.899 --> 00:35:09.602]  The road to being a good, decent person is going to be a hard road.
[00:35:09.602 --> 00:35:16.988]  I have to try every day to be honest with myself, every day to not be deceptive, because humans just naturally do it.
[00:35:16.988 --> 00:35:32.641]  I have to constantly think about what I'm saying, think about what I'm doing, think about how I treat my wife, think about how I treat my family, think about how I treat co-workers, and I still look back and say, I just did something that was wrong.
[00:35:36.624 --> 00:35:42.166]  And most people, if you knew me individually, would say, wow, you're an extremely moral, good, nice person.
[00:35:42.166 --> 00:35:44.506]  But I know just how bad I am.
[00:35:44.506 --> 00:35:47.307]  I'm attempting to be good.
[00:35:47.307 --> 00:35:48.627]  I'm attempting to tell the truth.
[00:35:48.627 --> 00:35:54.549]  I'm attempting to not twist things in my own mind and then regurgitate it out on people.
[00:35:54.549 --> 00:35:57.550]  I know it's a lie that the government loves us and cares about us.
[00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:05.712]  I've read literally thousands of their own statements in white papers where they just openly say, world government, world extermination.
[00:36:07.329 --> 00:36:08.470]  I've got an article up today.
[00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:12.674]  Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass scale fertility reduction.
[00:36:12.674 --> 00:36:17.038]  You can go right to the Rockefeller Foundation and read it.
[00:36:17.038 --> 00:36:22.283]  And I know what this big philanthropy push is to get the billionaires to give half their money.
[00:36:22.283 --> 00:36:26.987]  They actually put it into an investment fund, tax-free, and get giant profits back.
[00:36:28.365 --> 00:36:34.246]  No taxes and they get to keep the profits as long as it's, quote, invested in the tax-free foundation.
[00:36:34.246 --> 00:36:40.968]  And their giant estates, their helicopters, their servants, their investments, it's all tax-free.
[00:36:40.968 --> 00:36:47.229]  The Rockefellers for 104 years have been tax-free.
[00:36:47.229 --> 00:36:52.491]  And if you're elitist enough, every few decades a new crop is allowed to join.
[00:36:52.491 --> 00:36:57.572]  You know, the media is spinning it like, aren't these 40 billionaires nice to give half their money?
[00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:10.647]  If you go research Ted Turner, 12 years ago, giving $1 billion, he's gotten, last time I checked, upwards of a billion dollars in interest on investments back.
[00:37:10.647 --> 00:37:20.593]  That billion is tax-free in investments that then give part of the profit to the UN.
[00:37:20.593 --> 00:37:21.154]  Tax-free.
[00:37:22.384 --> 00:37:29.189]  And every one of these initiatives is to come in and dig a well for some Africans.
[00:37:29.189 --> 00:37:39.017]  Send in the first wave of nice Peace Corps doctors who mean well and with their humanity sell the African village that they are good.
[00:37:39.017 --> 00:37:43.580]  And the Africans, after spending four or five years with them, cry when they leave.
[00:37:44.501 --> 00:37:53.929]  And when the Americans leave, they cry and have little photos of the Africans they're helping back at their homes in New York and Texas and other places.
[00:37:53.929 --> 00:37:56.772]  And then the next wave comes in.
[00:37:56.772 --> 00:38:05.339]  The eugenicists come in, and those Africans don't know what hit them.
[00:38:05.339 --> 00:38:06.160]  They don't know what hit them.
[00:38:07.827 --> 00:38:11.591]  You see, they have to domesticate you first.
[00:38:11.591 --> 00:38:19.660]  Just like our ancestors, thousands and thousands of years ago, would domesticate horses.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.343]  There were several ways to do it.
[00:38:22.343 --> 00:38:26.708]  You could, with a bow and arrow, kill the mother.
[00:38:28.948 --> 00:38:34.090]  And then have people waiting at the end of the gorge to capture the colt when it ran away.
[00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:38.272]  And then they'd hold it down and feed it and tie it up and train it.
[00:38:38.272 --> 00:38:39.833]  That's how the Romans would get slaves.
[00:38:39.833 --> 00:38:44.055]  They'd come in, kill all the men, take the women and children.
[00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:45.835]  Same way you take a horse.
[00:38:45.835 --> 00:38:49.017]  But the other way to do it is just to simply start feeding wild horses.
[00:38:50.586 --> 00:38:58.170]  And to have them just become accustomed to you over time until you're able to take their cults without killing them.
[00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:09.475]  It's the same way to domesticate cows, bovine, pigs, dogs.
[00:39:09.475 --> 00:39:19.720]  And just as humans took one major species of wolf, one major species
[00:39:22.705 --> 00:39:34.975]  Of canine and created through breeding, created through breeding the dog, a new subspecies.
[00:39:34.975 --> 00:39:39.119]  The elite have come in and engineered us.
[00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:48.386]  And you look at the British, you look at the Japanese, intelligent, warlike, dynamic people turned into imperial slaves.
[00:39:49.295 --> 00:39:58.678]  To be quiet, to be subservient, to be caste-driven, to bow down to the government.
[00:39:58.678 --> 00:40:11.501]  The elite openly in all their publications talk about the two-tier system, and now they're moving with drugs in the water, with social conditioning to make us even more subservient.
[00:40:11.501 --> 00:40:16.283]  Wolves befriended humanity, and humanity created dogs.
[00:40:17.304 --> 00:40:25.308]  Now a subgroup of social engineers that have developed in every human society have created the slave system.
[00:40:25.308 --> 00:40:25.889]  Alright, I'm done.
[00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:28.810]  I said I'm taking call after call and I'm not doing that.
[00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:29.611]  I'm going to try now.
[00:40:29.611 --> 00:40:31.472]  Finish up your points, Chris in Texas.
[00:40:32.912 --> 00:40:34.273]  Yeah, you there?
[00:40:34.273 --> 00:40:35.154]  Yes, sir.
[00:40:35.154 --> 00:40:56.852]  Okay, even stranger than that invasion of the body snatchers tale with the Princeton kid is the one that went to MIT and is now working on, you know, White Sands, New Mexico, you know, who's had the CIA come and interview his family, and even asking his sister how many songs she's downloaded, and just very, now he's part of this weird clique.
[00:40:56.852 --> 00:41:01.496]  And that's what bothers me, Alex, is you get the best and the brightest of us, and they
[00:41:02.344 --> 00:41:04.668]  Indoctrinate them into this globalist system.
[00:41:04.668 --> 00:41:06.871]  They can become part of the clique.
[00:41:07.743 --> 00:41:12.006]  And I think they lose sight of purpose.
[00:41:12.006 --> 00:41:14.789]  Well, you heard Dr. Blaylock if you were listening two days ago.
[00:41:14.789 --> 00:41:23.535]  He said he was approached because he was top of the class in medical school with eugenics, with world government.
[00:41:23.535 --> 00:41:26.798]  And he said most of his fellow students went along with it.
[00:41:26.798 --> 00:41:30.821]  My father was approached and was horrified by it.
[00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:36.005]  But for everybody that says no, they find 10 people that say yes, yes, yes.
[00:41:39.574 --> 00:41:42.738]  Well, Alex, you do a great job, man, and I just want you to keep up the good work.
[00:41:42.738 --> 00:41:44.781]  We're doing what we can on our end.
[00:41:44.781 --> 00:41:50.127]  God bless you, Chris, and interesting story you told us there.
[00:41:50.127 --> 00:41:51.229]  Very informative.
[00:41:51.229 --> 00:41:52.490]  Frank in North Carolina.
[00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.513]  You're on the air, Frank.
[00:41:54.513 --> 00:41:56.435]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:41:56.435 --> 00:41:57.457]  Reformed Imperial.
[00:41:58.027 --> 00:42:00.289]  Storm Trooper once again.
[00:42:00.289 --> 00:42:03.951]  You shouldn't take my call, but I appreciate that you do.
[00:42:03.951 --> 00:42:08.654]  I always love to hear Marines call in law enforcement.
[00:42:08.654 --> 00:42:17.841]  That motivates me to hear law enforcement, especially active law enforcement and Marines, Army, any kind of military call in that are awake.
[00:42:20.383 --> 00:42:43.364]  What I called in about, I was trying to get in a week or two ago, you were talking about Rush Limbaugh and I hate to even bring that guy up but I just wanted to make the point that I called you back in January of 2009 to let you know that Rush Limbaugh had gone off on a rant during the first hour of his show back in January of 2009 and it sounded like you.
[00:42:45.762 --> 00:42:48.004]  I thought he was joking, but he was serious.
[00:42:48.004 --> 00:42:52.467]  I think I called in and told you this once before, but you may have forgotten about it.
[00:42:52.467 --> 00:42:59.091]  He was talking about the New World Order, CFR, he said that the economy... He actually went into a good bit of detail about it.
[00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:01.133]  He said that the economy was being destroyed.
[00:43:03.734 --> 00:43:07.436]  No, no, no.
[00:43:07.436 --> 00:43:15.881]  Two Fridays ago, and I read the transcript here on air, he came out and said there is a blue blood robber baron elite in New York and D.C.
[00:43:15.881 --> 00:43:22.005]  that hates the middle class and they plan to rob everyone, including the new rich, like himself.
[00:43:22.005 --> 00:43:23.926]  And see, Limbaugh's finally figuring out
[00:43:25.086 --> 00:43:39.376]  And so is Mancow and so many others, that they're gonna have to leave, and that there's nowhere to run in the world, and that they're targeted as well, and that signing on to this and playing along with the left-right paradigm isn't gonna work.
[00:43:39.376 --> 00:43:48.262]  And he said, the Republican Party, just as bad as the Democrats, are globalist elitist who want world government and want to enslave everyone.
[00:43:48.262 --> 00:43:54.227]  And I was driving down the road with my mouth hanging open, got here for the Sunday show, because I was listening on a Sunday to a rebroadcast,
[00:43:54.907 --> 00:43:57.728]  On a local station, it was W-O-A-I.
[00:43:57.728 --> 00:44:05.551]  I was coming in to do my show out of Austin, that's on 590 AM, and I just literally couldn't believe what I was hearing.
[00:44:05.551 --> 00:44:19.696]  And Michael Savage, in the last three years, has really come out and gotten a lot more hardcore, and admits that Wall Street is swindling everyone, and that Goldman Sachs is criminal, and the Federal Reserve is private, and the government stage is terror attacks.
[00:44:19.696 --> 00:44:21.157]  Because here's the deal.
[00:44:21.157 --> 00:44:23.698]  To Limbaugh, and to Savage, and to others,
[00:44:24.522 --> 00:44:42.166]  You're not, you know, the New World Order, if they get this in place, they've stated that once they've got everybody bankrupt under government control, they're not just gonna slowly sterilize people and put cancer viruses in the vaccines that kill you 10 years later and, you know, life expectancy starts dropping.
[00:44:42.166 --> 00:44:46.567]  They plan to just start wiping everybody out in mass plagues.
[00:44:46.567 --> 00:44:53.849]  And they've got bioweapons that, you know, kill 99% or more of the mammals they come in contact with and they admit this.
[00:44:54.429 --> 00:45:02.234]  And so, more and more, you have kind of the good old boy power structure in the U.S.
[00:45:02.234 --> 00:45:07.216]  who isn't really part of the New World Order structure, but went along with it because they got patted on the head.
[00:45:07.216 --> 00:45:16.742]  A lot of these guys, like Limbaugh I've met, CIA officer William F. Buckley, kind of brought him along, helped him meet Roger Ailes, helped push him.
[00:45:18.081 --> 00:45:24.445]  But see, now these guys are realizing that when they were young and sold out, they weren't given the full story.
[00:45:24.445 --> 00:45:37.154]  But now because of this radio show and because the globalists are so open now about their master plan, a lot of people who are intelligent and now are worth, you know, billions of dollars, I mean, Limbaugh's worth well over a billion dollars, they're realizing, my God,
[00:45:38.485 --> 00:45:44.307]  Yeah, as far as Michael Savage goes, I was listening to him back before I'd ever heard of you.
[00:46:08.678 --> 00:46:14.782]  I woke up from the false left paradigm, mainly because of you, back in 2005.
[00:46:14.782 --> 00:46:20.726]  But up until that point, I was listening to Michael Savage, and Michael Savage did the exact same thing.
[00:46:20.726 --> 00:46:26.329]  But this was back in 2005, and he went on a rant talking about the Council on Foreign Relations and the New World Order.
[00:46:26.329 --> 00:46:32.333]  Now, he was not yet getting into the part about the incremental destruction of the economy, because we weren't quite there yet.
[00:46:32.333 --> 00:46:33.473]  But he was talking about all that.
[00:46:33.473 --> 00:46:34.394]  He did a rant.
[00:46:34.394 --> 00:46:35.975]  And just like Russ Limbaugh,
[00:46:36.543 --> 00:46:46.072]  Uh, they didn't take any calls on it, no callers ever called in, so I'm wondering if those calls were screened out or what, but he never mentioned it again, neither one of them, because I listened for a while.
[00:46:46.072 --> 00:46:46.812]  Well, you know why they do it.
[00:46:46.812 --> 00:46:47.673]  And they did not mention it.
[00:46:47.673 --> 00:46:49.354]  You know why they do it?
[00:46:49.354 --> 00:46:50.656]  It's conscience.
[00:46:50.656 --> 00:46:54.039]  And they should do it every day, and so what if they get fired?
[00:46:54.039 --> 00:46:55.780]  They'll just go somewhere else and be even bigger.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.202]  I mean, look, you have to make a decision.
[00:46:58.202 --> 00:47:00.945]  Do we really want to be with a scientific dictatorship
[00:47:01.445 --> 00:47:11.954]  That bathes you in radiation with naked body scanners at courthouses, at highway checkpoints and airports, that lies to us and saves the images, that admittedly puts poison in the water.
[00:47:11.954 --> 00:47:20.362]  Just because a bunch of pencil-necked control freaks on national public radio make fun of you when you talk about fluoride being a poison, it doesn't matter!
[00:47:20.962 --> 00:47:29.029]  Thousands of EPA scientists signed letters and went to Congress and said, this is brain damaging people and causing cancer.
[00:47:29.029 --> 00:47:34.834]  So what if some pencil neck at Wired Magazine, who's a Rhodes Scholar, calls us nuts?
[00:47:34.834 --> 00:47:36.715]  We've got the scientific facts.
[00:47:36.715 --> 00:47:40.439]  Since when can some pencil neck tell us what we can and can't talk about?
[00:47:40.439 --> 00:47:41.259]  God bless you, Frank.
[00:47:41.259 --> 00:47:42.821]  I appreciate the call.
[00:47:42.821 --> 00:47:45.463]  I mean, I'm going to tell Savage and Limbaugh something.
[00:47:45.463 --> 00:47:46.904]  You better go all the way.
[00:47:46.904 --> 00:47:49.046]  You don't want to wish later that you'd have done more.
[00:47:50.313 --> 00:47:50.954]  Okay?
[00:47:50.954 --> 00:47:52.094]  You know this stuff's all true.
[00:47:52.094 --> 00:47:54.016]  Those guys are both very intelligent.
[00:47:54.016 --> 00:47:56.778]  They know full well what's going on.
[00:47:56.778 --> 00:48:00.280]  Those guys knew what was going on probably when I was in diapers.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.081]  Okay?
[00:48:01.081 --> 00:48:03.082]  I'm 36 years old.
[00:48:03.082 --> 00:48:04.203]  Savage is 60-something.
[00:48:04.203 --> 00:48:04.763]  What's Limbaugh?
[00:48:04.763 --> 00:48:05.664]  50-something?
[00:48:05.664 --> 00:48:07.285]  They know full well what's going on.
[00:48:08.536 --> 00:48:12.238]  Okay, you can't make a deal with the devil and come out on top.
[00:48:12.238 --> 00:48:15.820]  What would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:21.984]  What would it profit a man to gain the whole world for a little while and be destroyed in the process?
[00:48:21.984 --> 00:48:25.926]  You cannot reason with these globalists, okay?
[00:48:25.926 --> 00:48:31.169]  They are scientific, cold-blooded killers who want full-spectrum dominance.
[00:48:31.169 --> 00:48:32.991]  What's the ultimate form of dominance?
[00:48:32.991 --> 00:48:34.972]  Killing your enemy?
[00:48:34.972 --> 00:48:36.893]  Wiping out your opposition completely?
[00:48:40.316 --> 00:48:41.976]  Our government funded Mao Zedong.
[00:48:41.976 --> 00:48:43.297]  That's now declassified.
[00:48:43.297 --> 00:48:45.057]  Our government, now declassified.
[00:48:45.057 --> 00:48:47.398]  And even Brzezinski's written two books bragging about it.
[00:48:47.398 --> 00:48:48.878]  Totally funded Pol Pot.
[00:48:48.878 --> 00:48:54.180]  He killed 30% of the population of his country.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:49:04.403]  The ultra-rich are going to sit offshore, they're going to implode the economy, and they're going to use the dumbed-down poor mass of people as a weapon to rob anybody who makes more than $20,000 a year.
[00:49:04.403 --> 00:49:05.923]  And when they're done, there'll be nothing left.
[00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:09.659]  Everything will be in the hands of the globalists.
[00:49:09.659 --> 00:49:13.300]  They want you and your lifestyle to be over.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.821]  Let's talk to Mike in California.
[00:49:14.821 --> 00:49:16.802]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:49:16.802 --> 00:49:17.902]  Alex, can you hear me pretty clear?
[00:49:17.902 --> 00:49:19.343]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:19.343 --> 00:49:21.043]  You have four quick questions.
[00:49:21.043 --> 00:49:23.264]  Can I ask you the four quick questions off the air?
[00:49:23.264 --> 00:49:26.206]  Do you need me standing here so you can remember them?
[00:49:26.206 --> 00:49:26.806]  No, no.
[00:49:26.806 --> 00:49:29.147]  Go ahead and ask me the questions.
[00:49:29.147 --> 00:49:36.390]  The first one is in relation to the Iran situation and the immediate impact it would have on our lifestyle.
[00:49:36.803 --> 00:49:45.908]  So the first question is, how long will it take to affect our lifestyle in relation to the cost of food, gas, utilities, and so on and so forth.
[00:49:45.908 --> 00:49:47.029]  That's the first question.
[00:49:47.029 --> 00:49:48.890]  It'll be instantaneous.
[00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:55.614]  Oil prices will conservatively double the day the attack takes place.
[00:49:55.614 --> 00:49:59.216]  Second question is, could you go into detail of this plan?
[00:49:59.216 --> 00:50:04.979]  I heard you mention this about a couple of weeks ago, where the elite will go underground
[00:50:05.563 --> 00:50:13.127]  While chaos exists above, while they create some chaotic situation above ground, while they live... Yeah, no, that's the Moonraker scenario.
[00:50:13.127 --> 00:50:15.488]  They're not going to go off planet, they're going to go underground.
[00:50:15.488 --> 00:50:16.248]  They've admitted that.
[00:50:16.248 --> 00:50:18.009]  Yeah, that's an important thing.
[00:50:18.009 --> 00:50:22.391]  So the underground... underground plague... plague centers, okay?
[00:50:23.908 --> 00:50:25.289]  Hmm... Do they really exist?
[00:50:25.289 --> 00:50:25.529]  Uh... Uh... The, uh...
[00:50:41.681 --> 00:50:52.413]  As far as an invasion is concerned, I mean an armed revolt, would the invasion trigger an armed revolt from the population of the people?
[00:50:52.413 --> 00:50:53.093]  You know what?
[00:50:53.093 --> 00:50:54.214]  Your phone's cutting out.
[00:50:54.214 --> 00:50:57.598]  I'm going to come back and try to get your other two questions quickly and then answer them quickly.
[00:50:57.598 --> 00:50:58.179]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.871 --> 00:51:05.475]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:04.682 --> 00:52:05.963]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:05.963 --> 00:52:09.884]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:09.884 --> 00:52:12.124]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.124 --> 00:52:17.986]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:52:17.986 --> 00:52:24.228]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:24.648 --> 00:52:30.631]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:30.631 --> 00:52:34.812]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:34.812 --> 00:52:39.094]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:39.094 --> 00:52:45.036]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.036 --> 00:52:48.598]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:50.579]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:50.579 --> 00:52:51.019]  It's here.

[00:53:01.243 --> 00:53:03.244]  Remain in your houses.
[00:53:03.244 --> 00:53:09.027]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:53:09.027 --> 00:53:10.388]  Will they do it?
[00:53:10.388 --> 00:53:13.010]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:19.453]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:53:19.453 --> 00:53:21.675]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:53:21.675 --> 00:53:23.676]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[00:53:25.917 --> 00:53:30.799]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:53:30.799 --> 00:53:35.721]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:53:35.721 --> 00:53:41.463]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:53:41.463 --> 00:53:49.887]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[00:53:49.887 --> 00:53:52.388]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.
[00:53:52.388 --> 00:53:55.149]  Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[00:53:55.469 --> 00:54:14.499]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:54:14.499 --> 00:54:19.982]  Alright, quickly going back to Mike in North Carolina.
[00:54:19.982 --> 00:54:21.423]  I've got your first two questions.
[00:54:21.423 --> 00:54:22.424]  Quickly, what were the other two?
[00:54:23.564 --> 00:54:27.045]  The other two is, do you envision an armed revolt?
[00:54:27.045 --> 00:54:31.726]  And what do you think some of the trigger points would be to trigger something like that?
[00:54:31.726 --> 00:54:36.508]  You know, from the people and all that they're, I guess, enduring from the government.
[00:54:36.508 --> 00:54:37.868]  Boy, these are important questions.
[00:54:37.868 --> 00:54:40.449]  And what was the last one?
[00:54:40.449 --> 00:54:47.771]  Would you ever consider doing a movie on any of these three questions that I asked you about?
[00:54:47.771 --> 00:54:49.111]  Okay, I appreciate your call.
[00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:51.572]  I'm going to try to answer them quickly and succinctly.
[00:54:52.779 --> 00:55:04.049]  The different breakdowns that the Pentagon has even put out publicly and that think tanks and others have reported on dealing with Iran run from bad to worse.
[00:55:04.049 --> 00:55:06.631]  Iran will block a Strait of Hormuz.
[00:55:06.631 --> 00:55:10.294]  They can successfully do it for at least a month, most analysts believe.
[00:55:10.294 --> 00:55:14.558]  That will cause roughly a doubling in oil prices.
[00:55:14.558 --> 00:55:18.041]  If it continues, they talk about it not being $3.50 a gallon, but $7, $8, $9, $10 a gallon.
[00:55:21.664 --> 00:55:29.826]  Iran will also activate their Shiite militias with al-Sardar and others inside Iraq.
[00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:33.946]  That will disrupt oil and further drive up prices.
[00:55:33.946 --> 00:55:37.627]  Iran will probably launch military operations against Israel.
[00:55:37.627 --> 00:55:38.867]  That will escalate the war.
[00:55:38.867 --> 00:55:43.348]  And they'll probably activate sleeper cells in the United States.
[00:55:43.348 --> 00:55:47.089]  If they don't, and Lord knows they've got them,
[00:55:49.332 --> 00:55:54.136]  Western intelligence will and say that they did it as a pretext for a domestic crackdown.
[00:55:54.136 --> 00:56:02.403]  Anything the globalists do is a multifaceted attack profile where they're going to go after the countries they want to target but also domestic groups they want to suppress.
[00:56:02.403 --> 00:56:08.327]  Remember in all the main manuals for the police and military they're trying to take on gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:56:09.088 --> 00:56:14.932]  And the average conservative's like, kill them Arabs, kill them Muslims, not knowing the whole thing's pointed at them.
[00:56:14.932 --> 00:56:17.934]  That's the genius of full-spectrum dominance.
[00:56:17.934 --> 00:56:24.239]  On the issue of underground bases, it's been admitted since the 50s that they've built giant underground bases all over the country.
[00:56:24.239 --> 00:56:26.320]  They admittedly have a lot of these.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:32.225]  And they have underground tunneling devices that have been declassified partially that have connected these by railways.
[00:56:32.225 --> 00:56:34.366]  There's a railway underneath Robert
[00:56:35.908 --> 00:56:42.171]  Mueller Airport that goes out to Fort Hood, another one that hooks out to Bergstrom International Airport right here where I live.
[00:56:42.171 --> 00:56:54.978]  Only reason I know is my grandfather and grandmother lived here in Austin and I know a lot of people that were out there at the base when it was a SAC base, Strategic Air Command with nukes.
[00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:59.540]  And it's also admitted you can pull up mainstream news about the Breyer Green Hotel.
[00:57:02.346 --> 00:57:03.027]  Well, there's several.
[00:57:03.027 --> 00:57:06.170]  There's a hotel in Virginia and also one in Maryland.
[00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:13.076]  And it's an admitted shutdown hotel, where in the bottom there's a giant nuke blast door and an underground railway.
[00:57:13.076 --> 00:57:15.399]  Now, that's classified, but they admit the railway's there.
[00:57:17.273 --> 00:57:22.457]  And so our government has a bigger defense budget than all other defense budgets combined.
[00:57:22.457 --> 00:57:27.982]  And they've had the biggest black budget, much of it spent in the continuity of government.
[00:57:27.982 --> 00:57:35.048]  And continuity of government has been the cover to take over the legitimate government in the National Security Act of 47.
[00:57:35.048 --> 00:57:45.817]  And so much of the details of Mount Weather and Site R and other bases across the country
[00:57:46.977 --> 00:57:49.659]  Not just in Maryland and Virginia, but also in Colorado.
[00:57:49.659 --> 00:57:52.401]  That's where NORTHCOM is based in Colorado Springs.
[00:57:52.401 --> 00:58:03.209]  They've got giant admitted underground bases there that then hook into railways that go all over the country.
[00:58:03.209 --> 00:58:14.377]  I'll just say I know some people that work out at Bergstrom, and most people don't know this, but they are aware of the heavy blast doors that are concealed down beneath the National Guard base over there.
[00:58:15.327 --> 00:58:16.808]  It's just everywhere.
[00:58:16.808 --> 00:58:19.931]  That's why Bush chose Crawford.
[00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:27.057]  Because the word is, well, there is an admitted underground base with nukes under the mountains, the hills at Fort Hood.
[00:58:27.057 --> 00:58:30.500]  The underground rail spur goes right underneath his Crawford Ranch.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.702]  So they chose that location.
[00:58:32.702 --> 00:58:36.265]  And of course, they'll wall it off now that they've sold it.
[00:58:36.265 --> 00:58:37.906]  There's a railway right underneath his house.
[00:58:37.906 --> 00:58:41.769]  We'll be right back.

[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:58.183]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:09.773]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:11.354]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.354 --> 01:00:12.895]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.895 --> 01:00:17.098]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.098 --> 01:00:22.602]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.602 --> 01:00:24.224]  Okay, a lot of vital news coming up.
[01:00:24.224 --> 01:00:29.107]  I'm going to blast through at the bottom of the hour, but right now we're continuing with your phone calls.
[01:00:29.107 --> 01:00:32.370]  A caller from California asked me four questions.
[01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:33.391]  I just went over two of them.
[01:00:35.063 --> 01:00:38.369]  But dealing with the underground bases, they admittedly have these all over the country.
[01:00:40.373 --> 01:00:47.615]  But the extent of how massive they are and how they're interconnected is highly classified.
[01:00:47.615 --> 01:00:50.877]  But a lot of it has come out in pieces here and there.
[01:00:50.877 --> 01:00:57.959]  And under the eugenics model, the globalists can release a mass plague that would wipe out the majority of the population.
[01:00:57.959 --> 01:01:03.241]  And then the ruling class would then emerge from the bunkers.
[01:01:03.241 --> 01:01:07.962]  And they also, of course, would have the antidotes to the plague that they've released.
[01:01:11.385 --> 01:01:16.751]  Ian Fleming, of course, was a member of British Intelligence, MI6, a spymaster.
[01:01:16.751 --> 01:01:19.014]  He wrote the James Bond books.
[01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:27.944]  And much of what you see in those books, then made into films, deals with real scenarios that have been discussed.
[01:01:27.944 --> 01:01:30.567]  But to make it more science fiction-y, in the movie Moonraker,
[01:01:31.408 --> 01:01:40.631]  This elite industrialist who's a eugenicist wants to kill everybody and only have prime genetic specimens go back to Earth to save the ecology of the planet.
[01:01:40.631 --> 01:01:45.433]  They go off-world before they release a biological agent to kill everybody.
[01:01:45.433 --> 01:01:47.474]  But that is not the plan.
[01:01:47.474 --> 01:01:50.395]  It is underground bases.
[01:01:50.395 --> 01:02:00.179]  And this is a serious program being discussed by the globalists and they're romanticizing with all these different movies and TV shows about life after humans and how great it's going to be.
[01:02:01.192 --> 01:02:25.341]  And most of the top transhumanist and futurist write about this, and a lot of your major computer company and technology company owners write about how, like Bill Joy, I talk a lot about in Wired Magazine, who went to an elite meeting and met with 200 plus IT owners, and they said, do we kill everybody, or do we just entertain the public?
[01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:28.322]  I mean, because the future doesn't even need us.
[01:02:28.322 --> 01:02:30.203]  Now, you asked about armed revolt.
[01:02:32.199 --> 01:02:51.563]  If you look at the gang-counter-gang British intelligence model, just use one example of how they use it in Operation Gladio, which is now declassified in Europe from the 1950s into the mid-1980s, with the Bologna bombing in Italy and other places, they'll just set off bombings and blame it on political groups they want to go after.
[01:02:51.563 --> 01:02:59.104]  Or you've got the Kenyan model that was the model of the Gladio NATO option system, stay behind networks,
[01:02:59.924 --> 01:03:11.791]  Where they created national parks and international parks all over Africa as guerrilla bases for groups they fund to then attack the indigenous populations.
[01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:22.618]  And then when those gangs they fund, this has been declassified in Kenyan history in the 50s and 60s, then British intelligence would come in and counter the gangs they themselves had created.
[01:03:22.618 --> 01:03:26.701]  Then they would go kill a few patsies and use that as a pretext to crack down.
[01:03:26.701 --> 01:03:28.422]  So I don't want an armed revolt.
[01:03:29.318 --> 01:03:34.523]  Because clearly, most of the groups that have been infiltrated and that push for this are government-run.
[01:03:34.523 --> 01:03:40.248]  Many of them don't even know it, as a pretext to have a massive clampdown on the population.
[01:03:40.248 --> 01:03:44.812]  And then you ask the question of, have I considered making a movie about the subjects that you brought up?
[01:03:44.812 --> 01:03:45.193]  Yes.
[01:03:45.193 --> 01:03:47.154]  I mean, these themes are in my documentaries.
[01:03:49.885 --> 01:03:51.707]  I mean, I would have loved to have made a hundred other films.
[01:03:51.707 --> 01:03:54.229]  The world's so complex and so many issues I want to cover.
[01:03:54.229 --> 01:03:59.353]  It's just doing a radio show, doing other interviews, doing research, and then making films.
[01:03:59.353 --> 01:04:02.496]  I can only make one or two films a year.
[01:04:02.496 --> 01:04:09.301]  And so we talk about it in a radio form, TV form here.
[01:04:09.301 --> 01:04:13.004]  But I hope that answers your question.
[01:04:13.004 --> 01:04:16.307]  But we don't want an armed revolt in this country that's offensive.
[01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:34.066]  You have a sovereign, basic, organic right to defend yourself from people trying to inject you with vaccines containing cancer, RNA, cancer viruses, adjuvants, mercury, aluminum.
[01:04:35.503 --> 01:04:41.207]  You have a right to defend yourself from government trying to inject your children with vaccines that make them servile.
[01:04:41.207 --> 01:04:45.430]  You have a right to defend yourself against people trying to put poison in your tap water.
[01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:51.354]  And I'm trying to peacefully have the dumbed-down local criminals back off.
[01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:55.997]  But it's a complex issue.
[01:04:55.997 --> 01:04:58.719]  But at the base, we have a right to defend ourselves from these murderers.
[01:05:00.179 --> 01:05:01.821]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.821 --> 01:05:05.204]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:05:51.813 --> 01:05:52.093]  Thank you!
[01:05:59.773 --> 01:06:04.316]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.316 --> 01:06:05.236]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.236 --> 01:06:08.659]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:08.659 --> 01:06:09.519]  Number 2.
[01:06:09.519 --> 01:06:14.402]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.402 --> 01:06:15.143]  It's true.
[01:06:15.143 --> 01:06:20.026]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.026 --> 01:06:20.846]  Number 3.
[01:06:20.846 --> 01:06:24.429]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.429 --> 01:06:28.131]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.331 --> 01:06:29.132]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.132 --> 01:06:31.895]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:31.895 --> 01:06:35.579]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.579 --> 01:06:36.359]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:40.524]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.524 --> 01:06:45.289]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:49.730]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:51.510]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:56.391 --> 01:07:02.572]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:07:02.572 --> 01:07:06.373]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:07:06.373 --> 01:07:09.233]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:14.174]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:07:26.224 --> 01:07:30.767]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[01:07:30.767 --> 01:07:39.274]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[01:07:39.274 --> 01:07:41.056]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:07:41.476 --> 01:07:43.837]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[01:08:02.707 --> 01:08:10.451]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:13.241]  It is Friday.
[01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:14.122]  We are live.
[01:08:14.122 --> 01:08:15.283]  Taking your phone calls.
[01:08:15.283 --> 01:08:20.005]  Bob Chapman with his weekly visit on the economy and really important news coming out on that front.
[01:08:20.005 --> 01:08:23.126]  He'll be joining us coming up here in about 52 minutes.
[01:08:23.126 --> 01:08:25.888]  Right now, let's talk to Derek in Missouri.
[01:08:25.888 --> 01:08:28.789]  You're on the air, Derek.
[01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:30.450]  How you doing?
[01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:31.150]  I'm doing okay.
[01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:32.371]  Welcome.
[01:08:32.371 --> 01:08:42.016]  I know I called in and I'd like to thank you for bringing up the humanistic needs of every man growing up through life.
[01:08:42.614 --> 01:08:47.918]  I think those are important ideas that you share with us and I've learned from them.
[01:08:47.918 --> 01:08:53.302]  Also from Michael Savage's tales through his growing up.
[01:08:53.302 --> 01:08:59.467]  I learned through your stories and I greatly appreciate that.
[01:09:00.391 --> 01:09:00.771]  I don't know.
[01:09:16.989 --> 01:09:21.133]  Yeah, we recently had a new police chief from Tulsa swing his way in and it seems to me like
[01:09:44.406 --> 01:09:44.867]  Maybe.
[01:09:44.867 --> 01:09:46.569]  I don't know anything about the man.
[01:09:46.569 --> 01:09:52.578]  He could be very great, but we're all watching here in Springfield, Missouri as to what's going on.
[01:09:54.054 --> 01:09:56.095]  Another subject if I could, Alex.
[01:09:56.095 --> 01:09:58.255]  And that's Patriot Families.
[01:09:58.255 --> 01:10:04.017]  I know when I was growing up, I didn't know exactly the fluoride tablets.
[01:10:04.017 --> 01:10:07.878]  My parents didn't know that that was a bad idea.
[01:10:07.878 --> 01:10:12.999]  But later on, my father later met a woman, and her name is Ruth.
[01:10:12.999 --> 01:10:13.919]  I'd like to say her name.
[01:10:13.919 --> 01:10:15.260]  Hi, Ruth.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.640]  And she's probably listening right now.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.561]  And she told us about the new ruled order.
[01:10:20.561 --> 01:10:23.282]  And as skeptical as we were, later on we grew
[01:10:23.891 --> 01:10:24.171]  I don't
[01:10:39.258 --> 01:10:49.422]  Uh, with a Greece-style, like, economic system that, uh, 30-year-olds are now being able to, uh, move in, back in with their folks because there are no jobs whatsoever.
[01:10:49.422 --> 01:10:56.265]  Uh, and it's becoming harder and harder for these patriot families to, uh, get the sustainability in place.
[01:10:56.823 --> 01:10:58.323]  Can you speak on that?
[01:10:58.323 --> 01:10:59.344]  Sure.
[01:10:59.344 --> 01:10:59.984]  Sure.
[01:10:59.984 --> 01:11:01.685]  And I appreciate your call, Derek.
[01:11:01.685 --> 01:11:04.586]  I mean, at least you've got a family.
[01:11:04.586 --> 01:11:06.406]  That's what family's for.
[01:11:06.406 --> 01:11:09.287]  Look at where the government's had control of groups.
[01:11:09.287 --> 01:11:10.828]  Black people.
[01:11:10.828 --> 01:11:17.670]  If you go back into the 1950s, more than half of blacks born in this country
[01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:19.250]  We're good to go.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.981]  There's no father.
[01:11:41.981 --> 01:11:45.063]  I mean, it's hard to bring your kids up right when you got a mother and a father there.
[01:11:45.063 --> 01:11:50.886]  Because there's the work and the taxes and the kids to watch and the role models.
[01:11:50.886 --> 01:11:59.652]  And now you see illegitimacy in white communities, Hispanic communities, trending just like what's happened with the black communities in this country.
[01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:06.055]  Now imagine all of these people that don't have a father at home or don't even have a mother.
[01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:07.977]  And now the CPS comes in and takes them.
[01:12:08.843 --> 01:12:11.027]  And now they're being raised by the government.
[01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:12.971]  And then they go out of foster care into prison.
[01:12:14.298 --> 01:12:17.940]  And that smaller and smaller middle class pays for that prison.
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:29.126]  And now that young person, whether they be black, white, it doesn't matter, is working in a prison for 25 cents an hour against everybody else in the free market who's outside the prison driving down wages.
[01:12:29.126 --> 01:12:31.267]  China's driving down the wages.
[01:12:31.267 --> 01:12:33.728]  And so at least you've got a family.
[01:12:33.728 --> 01:12:38.811]  At least 30-year-olds who are being laid off or having their pay cut can move back in with their folks.
[01:12:38.811 --> 01:12:40.152]  That's what family's always been for.
[01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:52.195]  You know, you go back 50, 60 years ago, even well-to-do families tend to live on the same piece of property, or in the same house, because they understood that's all there is in this world is your family.
[01:12:52.195 --> 01:12:53.375]  It's your tribe.
[01:12:53.375 --> 01:12:54.896]  It's your people.
[01:12:54.896 --> 01:13:03.460]  And so many globalist handbooks, so many university publications that we've quoted here call the family a disease, a dinosaur.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:06.501]  It's gotta be gotten rid of, just like our industry's a dinosaur.
[01:13:06.501 --> 01:13:08.382]  We gotta have a service economy.
[01:13:08.382 --> 01:13:09.603]  It's meant to make you dependent.
[01:13:10.461 --> 01:13:13.803]  And so you're just going to have to work harder.
[01:13:13.803 --> 01:13:17.586]  You're going to have to work two, three jobs like our ancestors did.
[01:13:17.586 --> 01:13:19.767]  I mean, winning is surviving.
[01:13:19.767 --> 01:13:26.392]  People think winning is a big swimming pool and a mansion and a bunch of money and a bunch of sex and a bunch of power.
[01:13:26.392 --> 01:13:27.793]  That's not winning.
[01:13:27.793 --> 01:13:35.118]  Winning is surviving and the next generation having it better than you did and being stronger and mentally tougher.
[01:13:36.724 --> 01:13:39.868]  And yes, we're going into something far worse than a Greece collapse.
[01:13:39.868 --> 01:13:41.650]  This is just the beginning.
[01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:47.216]  And I wish this wasn't true, but it's going to get really bad before it gets better.
[01:13:47.216 --> 01:13:48.618]  And it's never going to get better.
[01:13:48.618 --> 01:13:53.143]  You read the Rand Corporation, the Pentagon documents, the 2007 British Ministry of Defense.
[01:13:55.714 --> 01:14:00.137]  Battle perspective and they say the government's main job is suppressing the people.
[01:14:00.137 --> 01:14:02.399]  That there will be a total societal collapse by 2012.
[01:14:02.399 --> 01:14:05.441]  This is a year and a half before the 2008 crash.
[01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.262]  It's all designed.
[01:14:07.262 --> 01:14:08.943]  We've read that report here on air.
[01:14:08.943 --> 01:14:11.765]  London Guardian reported on it.
[01:14:11.765 --> 01:14:16.368]  And they talk about a world government being the answer and how it's a post-industrial world.
[01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:21.452]  Their answer to their engineer collapse is a controlled collapse that we never come out of.
[01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:37.615]  And so if you can just stay independent and keep them from poisoning your water and keep them from injecting you with the flu shot that really does other things to you, if you can keep your mind free, you're winning.
[01:14:37.615 --> 01:14:42.800]  You can live in a ditch, but as long as your mind is free, you are winning.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:53.463]  As long as your soul is free, as long as you're not controlled by the globalists and being programmed by their worldly system, in the world not of it, you're winning.
[01:14:53.463 --> 01:14:57.004]  So don't feel bad if you've got a broken down car or don't even have a car.
[01:14:57.004 --> 01:15:02.686]  Don't feel bad if you've got to live with your parents or if your parents and your kids have got to move back in with you.
[01:15:02.686 --> 01:15:09.208]  As long as their minds and their souls are right, that's the only thing that has value in this world, is blood and guts.
[01:15:10.503 --> 01:15:11.384]  Okay?
[01:15:11.384 --> 01:15:12.926]  Blood and guts.
[01:15:12.926 --> 01:15:14.527]  What do you think our ancestors went through?
[01:15:14.527 --> 01:15:23.717]  Living hell to bring us to this point, and now all that milk and honey they generated through freedom is being sucked out of us.
[01:15:23.717 --> 01:15:26.901]  But wealth can be destroyed, and then regenerated.
[01:15:26.901 --> 01:15:29.704]  But if you destroy liberty, it can't be.
[01:15:29.704 --> 01:15:31.125]  This is full spectrum dominance.
[01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:33.155]  This is siege.
[01:15:33.155 --> 01:15:39.858]  The individual, the family, the county, the state, the nation is under siege.
[01:15:39.858 --> 01:15:44.220]  They have to destroy the old system to replace it with the new system.
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:59.947]  But these vapid, self-serving, arrogant humanoids that we call the general public, who are so deep into the control they may never get out of it, you need to just feel sorry for them, pray for them, but move on and find those that can understand.
[01:16:00.854 --> 01:16:02.915]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Babs in Texas.
[01:16:02.915 --> 01:16:03.776]  Babs, you're on the air.
[01:16:03.776 --> 01:16:05.577]  Hi, Alex.
[01:16:05.577 --> 01:16:10.580]  I've been listening to you for 15 years, and if we save America, it's because of you.
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.281]  Okay?
[01:16:11.281 --> 01:16:12.261]  Oh, you're a sweetheart.
[01:16:12.261 --> 01:16:14.683]  No, it's because of people like you, Babs.
[01:16:14.683 --> 01:16:17.104]  Well, I'm very blessed.
[01:16:17.104 --> 01:16:17.925]  I'm 77.
[01:16:17.925 --> 01:16:23.929]  I learned by watching a video in the 60s and 70s of Rockefeller and Cheney.
[01:16:23.929 --> 01:16:27.991]  And they were at a secret meeting, at the Bilderberg meeting in London, England.
[01:16:27.991 --> 01:16:30.153]  They didn't know they were being filmed from a hat pin.
[01:16:30.595 --> 01:16:31.896]  Can you believe?
[01:16:31.896 --> 01:16:34.798]  Anyway, I think I told you that story a long time ago.
[01:16:34.798 --> 01:16:42.424]  But, we need to ask, I want you to invite your audience to run for Congress, to get rid of the crooks.
[01:16:42.424 --> 01:16:45.086]  We've got to change what's happening up there.
[01:16:45.086 --> 01:16:55.494]  And to come on Thursdays, where the city participation is allowed at the City Council, we have to get rid of fluoride and the poisons in our water.
[01:16:55.494 --> 01:16:56.995]  The doctors even say so now.
[01:16:58.683 --> 01:17:06.749]  Please invite people to come and stand up and help us, the people who are in the Fluoride Free Austin group.
[01:17:06.749 --> 01:17:17.037]  Babs, I do know you personally, and you're a well-to-do, intelligent lady, and so is your husband, but I had forgotten and refreshed my memory.
[01:17:17.037 --> 01:17:20.119]  Where did you see the secret film?
[01:17:20.119 --> 01:17:22.121]  Because I've never seen it.
[01:17:22.121 --> 01:17:24.042]  Okay, I'm going to try to get it again.
[01:17:24.042 --> 01:17:25.924]  It's from the John Birch people, okay?
[01:17:26.893 --> 01:17:30.436]  Uh, it's very important because a lot of people didn't believe me.
[01:17:30.436 --> 01:17:33.038]  And they're just now... I've been trying to stop this a long time.
[01:17:33.038 --> 01:17:35.140]  People don't always want to believe you.
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.401]  Even your relatives, you know.
[01:17:36.401 --> 01:17:37.542]  My family doesn't believe me.
[01:17:37.542 --> 01:17:45.208]  Well, if you watch what Robert Welch said 50 years ago, every bit of it came true.
[01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:47.250]  I couldn't believe it, yeah.
[01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:48.571]  I see it happening.
[01:17:48.571 --> 01:17:50.872]  Now, Dick Cheney and, uh,
[01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:54.011]  Rockefeller were on a film.
[01:17:54.011 --> 01:17:54.912]  They were on a video.
[01:17:54.912 --> 01:18:00.156]  My husband and I and our two-year-old moved to California in 1959.
[01:18:00.156 --> 01:18:02.177]  My husband was an architect.
[01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:03.798]  And we moved to Beverly Hills.
[01:18:03.798 --> 01:18:05.900]  So we thought we'd be able to survive, but we didn't.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.962]  I had to go to work as a, just a draftsman.
[01:18:08.962 --> 01:18:11.884]  I was drawing schematics on the Atlas missile.
[01:18:11.884 --> 01:18:21.791]  And to make a long story short, the thing, the, uh, I didn't get to, uh,
[01:18:22.688 --> 01:18:25.311]  Get everything out that I did.
[01:18:25.311 --> 01:18:39.087]  I learned then, I went down to the American Opinion Bookstore, which is owned by the John Birch people, and I saw a video that I was invited to go to their meetings and whatever.
[01:18:39.087 --> 01:18:40.449]  I was quite impressed with them.
[01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:41.350]  They're really good people.
[01:18:42.723 --> 01:18:59.831]  Well, I would imagine that a hardcore virtual will know specifically what this video is, but there is the video of Cheney six years ago at a CFR meeting that he didn't know was being taped, and he says, you know, I didn't let the public know I was in the CFR, even their president.
[01:18:59.831 --> 01:19:02.913]  You better believe I wouldn't let them know, and they all laugh at the public.
[01:19:02.913 --> 01:19:07.675]  So there is a similar video to that where he's talking about global government from just six, seven years ago.
[01:19:08.513 --> 01:19:09.594]  It's just a repeat.
[01:19:09.594 --> 01:19:13.638]  I'm 77 and Cheney's 8 years younger than I am.
[01:19:13.638 --> 01:19:19.023]  So it was probably more in the mid-60s when I heard this.
[01:19:19.023 --> 01:19:30.613]  Well you know Cheney, his first job was working for the guy that followed Lemnitzer and he was involved in COG planning and that's why he's always been so powerful even from the time he was a very young man.
[01:19:31.715 --> 01:19:32.775]  That's why he had a heart attack at 35.
[01:19:32.775 --> 01:19:37.477]  I mean, he was already highest level Pentagon, highest level White House.
[01:19:37.477 --> 01:19:40.558]  And he literally formed a lot of this battle plan.
[01:19:40.558 --> 01:19:42.078]  But Babs, it's great hearing from you.
[01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:48.760]  We've got to go down to the city councils everywhere and say, look, here's the EPA admitting their own toxicologist.
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.841]  It causes cancer and brain damage.
[01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:51.841]  Get it out of my water.
[01:19:51.841 --> 01:19:53.762]  Stop assaulting me and my family.
[01:19:53.762 --> 01:19:57.523]  And folks, when you bathe in it, it's just as bad as drinking it.
[01:19:57.523 --> 01:19:59.224]  Babs, good hearing from you.
[01:20:00.475 --> 01:20:02.996]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:20:02.996 --> 01:20:06.556]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:20:06.556 --> 01:20:15.038]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:20:15.038 --> 01:20:20.520]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:25.621]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:20:26.141 --> 01:20:34.189]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:39.655]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:20:39.655 --> 01:20:40.856]  Our foods are their enemy.

[01:23:13.218 --> 01:23:17.179]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:23:17.179 --> 01:23:21.140]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.141]  What did Crystal do?
[01:23:22.141 --> 01:23:26.106]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:23:26.106 --> 01:23:32.513]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.

[01:24:12.051 --> 01:24:18.115]  A private group of banks and corporations have taken over the government through continuity of government.
[01:24:18.115 --> 01:24:27.060]  They said we've got to have a secret government that no other area of government can look into in case the Russians nuke us, starting in the late 40s.
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:40.809]  And since then they run most of the narcotics, they control the money laundering, they have federalized our cities and counties, and now they've allowed the same private banks that finance them to fully rob the public.
[01:24:41.803 --> 01:24:47.127]  We've been completely financially destroyed, but it's been done through fraud.
[01:24:47.127 --> 01:25:00.897]  We have to say no to the fraud and no to the central banks, and we've been trying to do that with auditing the Fed and with moving to prosecute these people, and their response is to have Congress pass reform
[01:25:02.196 --> 01:25:05.237]  To give them even more power and more secrecy.
[01:25:05.237 --> 01:25:10.100]  But the good news is, the public is now aware of who really runs the country.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:11.801]  Up until a few years ago, they weren't.
[01:25:11.801 --> 01:25:13.681]  This is huge news!
[01:25:13.681 --> 01:25:17.643]  We're now identifying the problem.
[01:25:17.643 --> 01:25:20.685]  And that is half the battle.
[01:25:20.685 --> 01:25:22.045]  By the way, that's not a G.I.
[01:25:22.045 --> 01:25:22.646]  Joe quote.
[01:25:23.396 --> 01:25:34.572]  That is a old military term used by the British, that knowing your enemy is half the battle, and it really comes from, of course, the Chinese philosopher, Sun Tzu.
[01:25:34.572 --> 01:25:38.657]  So knowing is half the battle, and we know now, and the public now knows, more and more.
[01:25:39.298 --> 01:25:40.018]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:25:40.018 --> 01:25:42.078]  Two quick things I wanted to bring up.
[01:25:42.078 --> 01:25:45.799]  First of all, a couple weeks ago, you've heard of Michael Matved, right?
[01:26:08.706 --> 01:26:12.008]  Yeah, it's his favorite sport to attack me.
[01:26:12.008 --> 01:26:12.869]  Right, exactly.
[01:26:12.869 --> 01:26:14.189]  He's a typical neocon.
[01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:18.372]  Well, he's not typical, he's one of the slimiest out there.
[01:26:18.372 --> 01:26:20.453]  Yeah, he is.
[01:26:20.453 --> 01:26:26.657]  Anyway, he was talking about the latest polls about the Republican presidential
[01:26:27.424 --> 01:26:27.945]  I don't
[01:26:48.314 --> 01:26:55.739]  Ron Paul, I said, is more than anybody else except for Alex Jones has awakened more people than anybody else.
[01:26:55.739 --> 01:27:06.586]  So he went into, oh Alex Jones, you know, and he tried to say about Ron Paul being old and all this kind of stuff and he looks tired, but he brought up the bohemian growth.
[01:27:06.586 --> 01:27:11.549]  And so I proceeded to try and respond to this and saying, well, what's your beef?
[01:27:11.549 --> 01:27:13.250]  He went in, he, you know,
[01:27:13.843 --> 01:27:14.743]  We're good to go.
[01:27:32.481 --> 01:27:41.306]  And so this idiot, he's putting this out there trying to mock you, but I'll guarantee you this caused some people to go, huh, I think I'm going to do a search on that and just check it out for myself.
[01:27:41.306 --> 01:27:42.586]  Well, I expand on that.
[01:27:42.586 --> 01:27:43.927]  They always turn it around.
[01:27:43.927 --> 01:27:51.631]  Like, we read the New York Times, Time Magazine, literally countless, it's got to be a hundred of them in the last two weeks.
[01:27:51.631 --> 01:27:58.895]  It's so many you can't even just search the term lithium in the water in Google News, and it's hundreds of mainstream articles and blogs.
[01:28:00.077 --> 01:28:05.490]  I saw four or five of them yesterday saying how great lithium is.
[01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:11.252]  And then Wired Magazine responded and said I was insane.
[01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:16.713]  And wrote another article saying that basically I believe aliens are going to come to the Earth.
[01:28:16.713 --> 01:28:18.934]  I've never talked about aliens.
[01:28:18.934 --> 01:28:21.495]  I've never said a mothership is coming to get us.
[01:28:21.495 --> 01:28:25.296]  But they say I'm lying about the media proposing lithium in the water.
[01:28:25.296 --> 01:28:28.837]  And I basically believe space aliens are going to land.
[01:28:28.837 --> 01:28:30.298]  And almost every comment
[01:28:32.563 --> 01:28:32.843]  I think?
[01:28:54.963 --> 01:28:56.104]  This is what they do.
[01:28:56.104 --> 01:28:57.946]  I sneak into Bohemian Grove.
[01:28:57.946 --> 01:29:01.749]  I'm there for one evening, five hours.
[01:29:01.749 --> 01:29:04.191]  They do this weird ritual.
[01:29:04.191 --> 01:29:09.655]  I was there and saw the photos in their camp houses of men dressed as women.
[01:29:09.655 --> 01:29:13.619]  It's in mainstream news reports like the New York Post that they fly in gay porn stars.
[01:29:14.259 --> 01:29:19.904]  And, and each leader has his own gay porn star to service him, and it's Republican leaders, and they're having gay orgies.
[01:29:19.904 --> 01:29:37.358]  Now, I'm not here bashing gay people, but the point is, is that you've got the Republican leadership being compromised, and Nixon talked about it, he said, well, I was running for governor, I had to go, and it's the most GD, faggy thing you've ever seen, to use his quote, and, and, and, uh,
[01:29:38.158 --> 01:29:47.565]  And this is how they compromise them, and the Republicans all go in there and have sex with gay porn stars, and then they go, okay, you've now been compromised, we can promote you.
[01:29:47.565 --> 01:29:48.426]  It's just like Obama.
[01:29:48.426 --> 01:29:50.768]  I mean, come on!
[01:29:50.768 --> 01:29:52.169]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.169 --> 01:29:54.691]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.691 --> 01:29:57.373]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.255 --> 01:30:05.496]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.496 --> 01:30:09.058]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.058 --> 01:30:11.660]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:17.543]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.543 --> 01:30:24.207]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.207 --> 01:30:30.191]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:33.873]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.353 --> 01:30:38.637]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:38.637 --> 01:30:44.601]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:44.601 --> 01:30:48.144]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.144 --> 01:30:50.125]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.125 --> 01:30:51.246]  It's here.

[01:32:56.801 --> 01:32:58.542]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:33:00.407 --> 01:33:05.474]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:35.733 --> 01:33:43.720]  I mean, to be specific here, I think that the whole gay lifestyle is very, very destructive.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:52.388]  They have the highest level of suicide, the highest level of partner violence, the highest level of disease.
[01:33:52.388 --> 01:33:56.211]  I'm not somebody who sits up here and judges people or hates them.
[01:33:57.443 --> 01:34:05.818]  Uh, but I do care about people, and I also, now that I'm older, realize how dangerous promiscuity is.
[01:34:05.818 --> 01:34:07.561]  I mean, I think that is just as bad.
[01:34:07.561 --> 01:34:07.801]  I think...
[01:34:09.019 --> 01:34:18.161]  You know, you can sit around and joke about it, and I was joking about it with Man Cow the other day at the talk show house when he said, most men don't seem like they're aggressively attracted to women.
[01:34:18.161 --> 01:34:36.525]  I was just uncontrollably attracted to women, and I still am, but I mean, I guess I'm married, love my wife, and, you know, have psychologically grown, but I'm not here judging people that just want to run around fornicating, except for the fact that it's destructive and dangerous, and it results in abortions,
[01:34:37.365 --> 01:34:39.447]  And, you know, results in health problems.
[01:34:39.447 --> 01:34:42.028]  Thank God I never had any problems.
[01:34:42.028 --> 01:34:49.053]  But if I, you know, I mean, if I could be a teenager again and look back on it, you know, I'm not proud of the things I did.
[01:34:49.053 --> 01:34:53.816]  And of course, I was just par for the course growing up in Dallas, Texas and then Austin.
[01:34:53.816 --> 01:35:00.380]  I went to high school part of the time in a suburb of Dallas and then here in Austin.
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:01.281]  And I mean, it was just.
[01:35:02.521 --> 01:35:08.224]  I mean the women were ready to go and I was ready to go as well.
[01:35:08.224 --> 01:35:16.988]  My issue though about the homosexuality at Bohemian Grove, this was in Harper's Magazine, they interviewed Nixon back in the 70s when he was president.
[01:35:17.768 --> 01:35:23.490]  And he talked about Bohemian Grove and how he had to go there for political power when he was running for governor, his unsuccessful bid.
[01:35:23.490 --> 01:35:31.853]  He'd been a senator, of course, hooked in with Prescott Bush, and he called it the most GD faggy thing you can imagine.
[01:35:31.853 --> 01:35:39.937]  And then after he died, they actually, Harper's did another article, and people didn't believe it, and released the audio tape of the taped interview with the reporter.
[01:35:39.937 --> 01:35:41.817]  I mean, he let them tape it.
[01:35:41.817 --> 01:35:42.518]  So you can just search
[01:35:44.278 --> 01:36:03.742]  Nixon I'm not gonna play it on air because it has profanity in it Nixon used a lot of profanity but you can search Richard Nixon talks about Bohemian Grove and At Bohemian Grove just while I was there There were it was a big photo of
[01:36:05.262 --> 01:36:22.509]  Of Henry Kissinger bent over with his butt sticking out, wearing women's panties, simulating, I don't even wanna say it with children listening, and by the way, I was sworn to secrecy at the time.
[01:36:22.509 --> 01:36:31.913]  I was sworn to secrecy and wearing my journalist hat, I always, unless it's something completely illegal, I follow my journalistic integrity.
[01:36:32.970 --> 01:36:35.192]  If somebody came to me and said, as a journalist, I'm going to tell you a secret.
[01:36:35.192 --> 01:36:36.193]  Okay, tell me the secret.
[01:36:36.193 --> 01:36:37.234]  Oh, I murdered somebody.
[01:36:37.234 --> 01:36:39.056]  I mean, I would be forced to call the police.
[01:36:39.056 --> 01:36:45.462]  You know, one time we had a fellow show up and say they're investigating me.
[01:36:45.462 --> 01:36:52.129]  They think I firebombed the governor's mansion and he tried to give me this big box of material or my crew and
[01:36:56.145 --> 01:36:59.329]  I thought it could be a setup to set me up for the firebombing.
[01:36:59.329 --> 01:37:02.032]  And so, but plus, I just had to call.
[01:37:02.032 --> 01:37:08.779]  I mean, I called the state police and they came out and because I had to.
[01:37:08.779 --> 01:37:13.584]  But short of that, I will never break, you know, the journalist code.
[01:37:13.584 --> 01:37:17.468]  And it is the journalist code that if something's illegal, you've got to talk about it.
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:18.821]  I don't know.
[01:37:36.325 --> 01:37:43.071]  Kissinger with a bunch of other world leaders dressed as women, bent over, simulating inserting fingers in their rectums, okay?
[01:37:43.071 --> 01:37:44.532]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:37:44.532 --> 01:37:52.018]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I was trying to hide out and stay away from people and being questioned by Secret Service with Mike Hanson, who also snuck in with me.
[01:37:53.126 --> 01:37:57.529]  And Ronson saw me get in successfully and decided he was going to sneak in the same way.
[01:37:57.529 --> 01:38:03.233]  So I didn't even know he was going to sneak in until I later saw him walking down one of the forest paths and didn't say anything.
[01:38:03.233 --> 01:38:09.057]  But the point is, Ronson backs up what I saw.
[01:38:09.057 --> 01:38:16.862]  And then later, Widows, it's happened in two cases, sent me internal annals, 10-year annals.
[01:38:16.862 --> 01:38:17.903]  And it's Bush Sr.
[01:38:17.903 --> 01:38:18.483]  and Jr.
[01:38:18.483 --> 01:38:18.944]  speaking.
[01:38:21.596 --> 01:38:43.395]  And the media never said don't call W Junior, but he's called Junior in those books and they dress in drag, it's admitted in Spy Magazine, People Magazine, CBS News, that limos just drive in all day long and jets land from New York and L.A.
[01:38:43.395 --> 01:38:44.516]  with the gay prostitutes.
[01:38:45.285 --> 01:38:48.506]  And I didn't understand because in 2000 I was a lot better looking than I am now.
[01:38:48.506 --> 01:38:50.767]  I was about 30 pounds lighter than I am now.
[01:38:50.767 --> 01:38:55.029]  And people have seen the videos.
[01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:57.670]  I see women commenting on YouTube, man, he's handsome.
[01:38:57.670 --> 01:38:59.230]  And I was pretty handsome then.
[01:38:59.230 --> 01:39:00.651]  And Mike was a handsome guy.
[01:39:00.651 --> 01:39:04.152]  And I hadn't done my research properly on Bohemian Grove.
[01:39:04.152 --> 01:39:06.573]  And I'd heard that there was a lot of homosexuality in there.
[01:39:07.313 --> 01:39:18.004]  But you've got to be there to believe it and I had old men whistling at me and coming at me and I had groundskeepers laughing at us and whistling at us and
[01:39:19.582 --> 01:39:29.208]  I literally probably only walked around for an hour of the five hours because I was questioned by Secret Service, by Sonoma County Sheriff's deputies.
[01:39:29.208 --> 01:39:34.331]  Luckily, with a straight face, I knew enough about the camps to say I'm a member of the Hillbillies, knowing that was a Texas camp.
[01:39:34.331 --> 01:39:40.655]  They have over 100 camps within the 2,700 acres, log cabins.
[01:39:40.655 --> 01:39:42.876]  And so, I mean, and then it got dark.
[01:39:45.302 --> 01:39:51.367]  They reportedly at this pool, this little lake, have this idol, and there was the idol.
[01:39:51.367 --> 01:39:57.633]  And I know that Moloch was a bull in Sumeria, but occultists always mix and match.
[01:39:57.633 --> 01:40:09.623]  They addressed it as Moloch in their literature, as Moloch during the ritual, and as Lilith, which is the owl god, or sometimes represented by an owl.
[01:40:11.844 --> 01:40:17.468]  And they went through this incantation of conjuring the dead Bohemian Grove members that had been there.
[01:40:17.468 --> 01:40:30.878]  And I was with those old men on the beach, looking across the 50-60 yards at the owl, and they were grinding their teeth and in reverent rapture.
[01:40:30.878 --> 01:40:32.640]  And Mike Hanson sitting beside me,
[01:40:33.712 --> 01:40:36.616]  You can even hear this on the audio if you boost it up because we're trying to shoot video.
[01:40:36.616 --> 01:40:44.325]  This is a little hidden camera on my side trying to halfway climb up the knots on a tree to get above the people's heads because the camera was hidden at my side.
[01:40:45.393 --> 01:41:08.332]  It's in the film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove by the way and then I went back to Bohemian Grove and covered it and a few years later and so there's two films in one on the DVD titled Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove that's an hour and a half film in the 46 minute documentary again both films on one DVD The Order of Death and
[01:41:10.293 --> 01:41:15.595]  Mike was like, oh, that's interesting, and they would just look at him with hatred, even though he was whispering, oh, that's nice.
[01:41:15.595 --> 01:41:16.896]  You know, like he was in a crowd of people.
[01:41:16.896 --> 01:41:22.098]  No, they were taking this like he was talking in church.
[01:41:22.098 --> 01:41:35.645]  And then you have the New York Post and the rest of it reporting that, you know, headline, Chad Savage, gay porn star, services moguls.
[01:41:35.645 --> 01:41:38.286]  That was the headline, and so many other headlines.
[01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:39.693]  I don't think so.
[01:42:04.016 --> 01:42:08.238]  If they've been to Bohemian Grove, they are sent there to be compromised.
[01:42:08.238 --> 01:42:14.321]  And it just shows you how everything you're told is not what reality really is.
[01:42:14.321 --> 01:42:25.566]  Just like they tell you, we promise you these body scanners do not have any radiation and cannot hurt you, and we promise you they cannot even be saved.
[01:42:25.566 --> 01:42:31.449]  And then it turns out they're saving everything at the state courthouses, at the federal courthouses that have them, at the airports.
[01:42:32.614 --> 01:42:34.576]  It's now completely admitted.
[01:42:34.576 --> 01:42:39.721]  They lied to you openly from the beginning.
[01:42:39.721 --> 01:42:41.522]  Because they're all confident.
[01:42:41.522 --> 01:42:48.429]  And the Democrats have their weird bohemian grove with Maury Strong in Colorado.
[01:42:48.429 --> 01:42:51.992]  And reportedly similar things go on there, but women are involved as well.
[01:42:54.212 --> 01:43:00.255]  Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor, before Helmut Kohl, he wrote the book, Men and Powers, a Political Retrospective.
[01:43:00.255 --> 01:43:01.435]  We own the book.
[01:43:01.435 --> 01:43:03.136]  I did shots of the text.
[01:43:03.136 --> 01:43:05.357]  I underlined it in the film.
[01:43:05.357 --> 01:43:09.239]  And he says, we do our own rituals at our own Druidic grove.
[01:43:09.239 --> 01:43:13.921]  Remember, Jesus said, you know, don't go to the groves, cut down the groves, where they do these rituals.
[01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:16.542]  People say, Jesus was for cutting down trees.
[01:43:16.542 --> 01:43:20.624]  No, he meant in their holy groves, where they do the sacrifices.
[01:43:21.806 --> 01:43:22.746]  That's in the Bible.
[01:43:22.746 --> 01:43:29.270]  It's the same stuff going on 2,000 years ago, or 2,010 years ago, is going on now.
[01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:35.493]  And Schmidt says, oh, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, we run the planet, one world government, it's so wonderful.
[01:43:35.493 --> 01:43:37.253]  I mean, he wrote this.
[01:43:37.253 --> 01:43:44.117]  And he says, we have our own groves to do rituals, but my favorite place to do rituals is Bohemian Grove, and I travel every year.
[01:43:46.897 --> 01:43:53.306]  And he says more decisions get made there than even the Trilateral Commissioner Bilderberg Group.
[01:43:53.306 --> 01:43:58.753]  The real decisions get made there while they're on drugs and drinking and some of the men, like women,
[01:43:59.588 --> 01:44:02.710]  But it's men only, so they drive into Monterreo.
[01:44:02.710 --> 01:44:05.031]  It's got four or five hotels.
[01:44:05.031 --> 01:44:08.774]  And when you're there during that season, there are just hookers everywhere.
[01:44:08.774 --> 01:44:18.960]  You know, when you're outside the Grove, there are just beautiful, you know, number 10 hookers, females, just, just, just, and they go to the local golf course to be picked up.
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:26.085]  So the Grove members drive over there and they want a female and they also pick up the males and drive them in with them.
[01:44:26.085 --> 01:44:26.205]  And
[01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:31.650]  This is who your leadership is.
[01:44:31.650 --> 01:44:45.355]  Most of these Republican leaders you see up on television that go to Bohemian Grove, go to a forest retreat, dress up like women, do bizarre black magic rituals, and have sex with gay porn stars and gay prostitutes.
[01:44:45.355 --> 01:44:47.236]  I mean, that's a fact.
[01:44:47.236 --> 01:44:49.317]  Richard Nixon talked about it.
[01:44:49.317 --> 01:44:49.677]  Okay?
[01:44:49.677 --> 01:44:52.718]  I mean, nothing you've been told is true.
[01:44:56.189 --> 01:45:00.592]  And the caller brought this up, and I've now gone into a 10-minute rant about it, or 5-minute rant, whatever it is.
[01:45:00.592 --> 01:45:01.233]  Let's be technical.
[01:45:01.233 --> 01:45:02.233]  9-minute rant.
[01:45:02.233 --> 01:45:08.037]  7-minute rant.
[01:45:08.037 --> 01:45:08.938]  3's the charm, if I only got it right.
[01:45:08.938 --> 01:45:10.019]  7-minute rant.
[01:45:10.019 --> 01:45:16.844]  I've done this 7-minute rant on this subject, and I mean, I don't blame people not believing it.
[01:45:20.297 --> 01:45:30.584]  The British journalist said, I can't go in there because World of Wonder and Channel 4 England won't allow me to because of liability.
[01:45:30.584 --> 01:45:31.364]  It's real.
[01:45:31.364 --> 01:45:32.585]  I've got people inside.
[01:45:32.585 --> 01:45:34.106]  They do do this ritual.
[01:45:34.106 --> 01:45:36.067]  There's all sorts of gay stuff going on.
[01:45:36.067 --> 01:45:42.591]  I will pay you your expenses and I'll also videotape you doing it.
[01:45:42.591 --> 01:45:46.453]  He said, I know you've infiltrated military operations and things like that.
[01:45:46.453 --> 01:45:48.094]  This should be a piece of cake for you.
[01:45:48.094 --> 01:45:48.735]  And I said, sure.
[01:45:49.884 --> 01:45:52.026]  Sure, I'll do it, but I don't believe that stuff.
[01:45:52.026 --> 01:45:57.791]  I mean, just eleven years ago, this happened ten, but he talked to me about six months before we did it.
[01:45:57.791 --> 01:46:03.356]  He was covering some of the things we were doing up at Waco, building a memorial chapel up there, John Ronson.
[01:46:03.356 --> 01:46:17.548]  He also wrote Men Who Stare at Goats, turned into the big movie that you've seen about General Stubblebine that's really a whitewash, but his book, Them, covers the Bohemian Grove fiasco or escapade, and
[01:46:20.285 --> 01:46:22.966]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:46:22.966 --> 01:46:35.389]  It's just, you go in there and you see this, and you got old men trying to pick you up, and it was literally like I was the cat, and they were Pepe Le Pew, the skunk, in that Warner Brothers cartoon.
[01:46:35.389 --> 01:46:45.232]  I mean, it was just, oh, thank you, oh, yes, oh, I'm handsome, well, thank you, have a nice day, with drunk old men going, ha ha ha, you know, corporate CEOs and people.
[01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:46.072]  I mean, it's gross.
[01:46:52.830 --> 01:47:01.074]  And again, meanwhile, I'm being chased like Pepe Le Pew through there, along with Mike Hanson.
[01:47:01.074 --> 01:47:02.534]  John Ronson's not very handsome.
[01:47:02.534 --> 01:47:09.598]  He didn't have any problems, according to him.
[01:47:09.598 --> 01:47:11.498]  But I'm just joking, John.
[01:47:14.512 --> 01:47:16.313]  Oh, just who could make this?
[01:47:16.313 --> 01:47:26.417]  Who could make up that they're in the news every day saying, we want to only let you have one child and we are putting drugs in your water to make you submit to us and we want to give you vaccines to make you submit.
[01:47:26.417 --> 01:47:40.204]  I mean, who could make up that every major insurance company is brazenly telling Bloomberg, well, we've changed the rules and we're allowed to keep your insurance money when your husband gets killed in Iraq, so we're just going to do it.
[01:47:40.204 --> 01:47:43.005]  And yeah, we're recording your naked bodies and we lied to you about it.
[01:47:45.007 --> 01:47:48.149]  I mean, look, I'm not the one doing all this crazy stuff.
[01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:52.812]  I know it sounds crazy, because I'm the one talking about it, but it's all real!
[01:47:52.812 --> 01:47:58.735]  It's all real!
[01:47:58.735 --> 01:47:59.996]  And these people are crazy!
[01:48:01.604 --> 01:48:01.844]  I think?
[01:48:20.755 --> 01:48:39.991]  of camping or fishing or hunting, never get sick of swimming in a river, never get tired of watching a sunset, never get tired of water skiing, never get tired of kissing my wife, never get tired of loving my children, never get tired of visiting my grandmother, and I'm a weirdo.
[01:48:39.991 --> 01:48:42.333]  I'm the weirdo because I'm normal.
[01:48:42.333 --> 01:48:47.377]  And the sickos run things and they're turning our society into their wonderland.
[01:48:49.147 --> 01:49:05.212]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls and Bob Chapman's coming up and I will intersperse a ton of news with him today because literally I got two days of news here I haven't really gotten to that I want to at least mention here and get Bob and of course the caller's take on it.
[01:49:05.212 --> 01:49:14.555]  But your purchase of videos, books, t-shirts, the materials at InfoWars.com, it makes this radio broadcast possible.

[01:49:19.627 --> 01:49:21.529]  Plus, these are films that are the best out there.
[01:49:21.529 --> 01:49:24.532]  You know, the public agrees.
[01:49:24.532 --> 01:49:33.221]  The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Fabled Enemies, and we, people, it was very popular in the two and a half weeks that we offered Obama Deception.
[01:49:33.221 --> 01:49:36.664]  Buy one, get three free.
[01:49:36.664 --> 01:49:38.306]  Or you can buy two, get eight free.
[01:49:39.719 --> 01:49:40.059]  I think?
[01:50:04.352 --> 01:50:08.475]  Most people that have seen it say it's even more powerful than the Obama deception, and I agree with them.
[01:50:08.475 --> 01:50:10.917]  You can get our three newest and hottest films.
[01:50:10.917 --> 01:50:12.539]  We're not discounting my old films here.
[01:50:13.769 --> 01:50:14.989]  Oh, they're discounted, too.
[01:50:14.989 --> 01:50:25.732]  We're discounting the biggest discounts, the newest and most powerful films, because I want you to have the high-quality DVD with the expanded extras to be able to give your friends and family.
[01:50:25.732 --> 01:50:28.993]  So, we're gonna run this special for at least the next two weeks.

[01:50:34.594 --> 01:50:38.155]  I know you know all about the New World Order, but your friends, your family, your neighbors don't.
[01:50:38.155 --> 01:50:41.456]  Films can do what weeks of talking to your family can't.

[01:50:50.834 --> 01:50:51.334]  Stay with us.
[01:51:00.796 --> 01:51:02.097]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.097 --> 01:51:07.701]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.701 --> 01:51:12.705]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.705 --> 01:51:18.289]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.289 --> 01:51:20.110]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:20.370 --> 01:51:20.890]  We're good to go!
[01:51:48.413 --> 01:51:49.834]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:49.834 --> 01:51:57.479]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.479 --> 01:52:00.681]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.681 --> 01:52:04.064]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:04.064 --> 01:52:07.966]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:07.966 --> 01:52:11.689]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:53:03.729 --> 01:53:05.810]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:08.552]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:08.552 --> 01:53:10.774]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:10.774 --> 01:53:12.195]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:53:12.195 --> 01:53:14.097]  But first, the facts.
[01:53:14.097 --> 01:53:16.018]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:53:16.018 --> 01:53:18.020]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:21.703]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:21.703 --> 01:53:29.449]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.

[01:53:51.002 --> 01:53:51.282]  It works!
[01:54:12.858 --> 01:54:25.703]  Finishing up on Bohemian Grove, it is a giant operation to compromise Republican Party officials and corporate chiefs.
[01:54:25.703 --> 01:54:30.905]  And that just shows you how mafioso this whole system is.
[01:54:30.905 --> 01:54:35.006]  If we don't have the Bill of Rights and Constitution, we're not protected from these people.
[01:54:35.006 --> 01:54:36.407]  And that's why they want to get rid of it.
[01:54:36.407 --> 01:54:39.848]  They don't want to get rid of it to keep you safe from Muslim terrorists at their funding.
[01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:43.070]  The man who infiltrated Bohemian Grove without Kevlar.
[01:55:09.841 --> 01:55:11.822]  Well, it wasn't that big of a stunt, actually.
[01:55:11.822 --> 01:55:15.544]  I mean, it shows how these people are not invincible.
[01:55:15.544 --> 01:55:18.566]  In fact, if you just stand up to them, they'll fall.
[01:55:18.566 --> 01:55:19.447]  Exactly.
[01:55:19.447 --> 01:55:19.847]  Exactly.
[01:55:19.847 --> 01:55:22.028]  I've got two points for you, Alex.
[01:55:22.028 --> 01:55:24.610]  I tried calling my municipal water filtration plant.
[01:55:25.507 --> 01:55:29.309]  And they are disclosing what chemicals they're using.
[01:55:29.309 --> 01:55:33.091]  They totally spun the call and said, basically, what's your name, boy?
[01:55:33.091 --> 01:55:33.731]  You know?
[01:55:33.731 --> 01:55:34.091]  No, no, no.
[01:55:34.091 --> 01:55:36.352]  Yeah, you're a terrorist asking.
[01:55:36.352 --> 01:55:43.175]  Look, you just called the city council or county commissioners or the select men, whatever you have in your area.
[01:55:43.175 --> 01:55:45.457]  Or what do they call that local town?
[01:55:45.457 --> 01:55:47.297]  Is it a community?
[01:55:47.297 --> 01:55:47.918]  Is it a city?
[01:55:47.918 --> 01:55:48.318]  What is it?
[01:55:48.678 --> 01:55:56.203]  Yeah, it would be like the Town Council or... Yeah, so you just call the Town Council and it's public record.
[01:55:56.203 --> 01:55:57.444]  Are you fluoridating?
[01:55:57.444 --> 01:55:59.505]  I mean, listen, what's the name of your town?
[01:55:59.505 --> 01:56:02.687]  I'll search Engine It right now, it'll tell you if your city fluoridates.
[01:56:02.687 --> 01:56:05.549]  Absolutely, Prescott, Ontario, Canada.
[01:56:05.549 --> 01:56:11.393]  That's with two T's on the end, Prescott.
[01:56:11.393 --> 01:56:14.775]  Fluoridation of water.
[01:56:14.775 --> 01:56:15.956]  Keep talking, I'm typing it in.
[01:56:19.793 --> 01:56:27.136]  He was acting like he was trying to get information to do something on the terrorists.
[01:56:27.136 --> 01:56:28.997]  He was looking for some Islamic last name.
[01:56:28.997 --> 01:56:31.598]  Okay, you got people there fighting it.
[01:56:31.598 --> 01:56:34.279]  Prescott to discuss referendum on fluoridation.
[01:56:34.279 --> 01:56:35.959]  Latest news from Ontario.
[01:56:35.959 --> 01:56:39.181]  John Wells tells council fluoridation is a non-issue.
[01:56:39.181 --> 01:56:43.202]  The fluoridation of Prescott's drinking water could become an issue.
[01:56:43.202 --> 01:56:45.063]  Let me click on it and give you the year.
[01:56:45.743 --> 01:56:48.424]  It looks like they were having a fight recently about it.
[01:56:48.424 --> 01:56:53.245]  This was seven years ago, out of the Brookville Recorder and Times.
[01:56:53.245 --> 01:56:55.885]  Press got to discuss referendum on fluoridation.
[01:56:55.885 --> 01:56:57.566]  Need to replace fluoride.
[01:56:57.566 --> 01:56:59.906]  Regulator puts the issue on the table.
[01:56:59.906 --> 01:57:03.027]  The machine that they used to inject it was broken.
[01:57:03.027 --> 01:57:05.767]  They were looking for money to buy a new one.
[01:57:05.767 --> 01:57:07.448]  And yes, your water's fluoridated.
[01:57:07.448 --> 01:57:09.028]  Found out in T-minus 12 seconds.
[01:57:09.887 --> 01:57:11.708]  Okay, I googled how much U.S.
[01:57:11.708 --> 01:57:14.009]  foreign aid is going to Israel annually.
[01:57:14.009 --> 01:57:24.172]  Websites like Procon.org list tens of billions conservatively over a table covering military to settlements like bulldozers and stuff.
[01:57:24.172 --> 01:57:31.235]  Yeah, there's about $15 billion that's public and another $20 billion or so they estimate that's camouflaged aid.
[01:57:31.235 --> 01:57:31.595]  Excellent.
[01:57:31.595 --> 01:57:32.635]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:57:32.635 --> 01:57:33.816]  Anything else?
[01:57:33.816 --> 01:57:34.516]  No, you're the best.
[01:57:34.516 --> 01:57:35.537]  We're listening.
[01:57:35.537 --> 01:57:36.117]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:37.281 --> 01:57:47.087]  Yeah, I've been a big critic of Israel and the fact that Israel manipulates US foreign policy and I don't like any country doing that.
[01:57:47.087 --> 01:57:53.671]  And people take out of context when I say people who then say that I work for Israel are
[01:57:54.850 --> 01:57:56.632]  Mind-controlled idiots.
[01:57:56.632 --> 01:58:02.718]  And then it gets spun that I'm saying anyone who criticizes Israel is a moron or an idiot.
[01:58:02.718 --> 01:58:05.601]  And that's just how dishonest people are.
[01:58:05.601 --> 01:58:07.863]  They just make stuff up.
[01:58:07.863 --> 01:58:16.892]  I mean, I have been critical of all foreign aid, and I'm critical of Israel trying to start a war with Iran.
[01:58:18.611 --> 01:58:25.034]  Uh, but most of these really vehement anti-Israel groups that's come out, like Al Turner, are feds.
[01:58:25.034 --> 01:58:32.017]  They're meant to make criticism of Israel look radical and stupid, so it's unaffected, ineffective.
[01:58:32.017 --> 01:58:34.618]  But I thought I'd just throw that, uh, out there.
[01:58:34.618 --> 01:58:36.738]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:58:36.738 --> 01:58:39.239]  Stay with us, more calls in Bob Chapman straight ahead.
[01:58:39.239 --> 01:58:48.003]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.182 --> 01:58:54.725]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:54.725 --> 01:58:55.645]  Number 1.
[01:58:55.645 --> 01:58:59.068]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.068 --> 01:58:59.928]  Number 2.
[01:58:59.928 --> 01:59:04.811]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:05.572]  It's true.
[01:59:05.572 --> 01:59:10.435]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.435 --> 01:59:11.255]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.255 --> 01:59:14.858]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:14.858 --> 01:59:18.540]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:19.540]  Number 4.
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:22.301]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.301 --> 01:59:25.982]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:25.982 --> 01:59:26.783]  Number 5.
[01:59:26.783 --> 01:59:30.924]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:30.924 --> 01:59:35.966]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:35.966 --> 01:59:40.147]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.147 --> 01:59:41.927]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:41.927 --> 01:59:46.529]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:59:47.169 --> 01:59:53.237]  877-327-0365.
[01:59:53.237 --> 01:59:55.621]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.621 --> 01:59:58.404]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.287 --> 02:00:10.111]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.111 --> 02:00:11.712]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.712 --> 02:00:13.254]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.254 --> 02:00:17.457]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.457 --> 02:00:22.841]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.841 --> 02:00:26.164]  Okay, it's hour number three coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:26.164 --> 02:00:30.207]  I'm going to go over a bunch of key financial news today.
[02:00:30.207 --> 02:00:32.609]  Like Social Security is in the red this year,
[02:00:33.757 --> 02:00:35.898]  Hey Alex, what's up?
[02:00:35.898 --> 02:00:36.338]  Alright, great.
[02:00:36.338 --> 02:00:37.439]  So, um...
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:01:09.587]  I watched your documentaries and they're really great and, honestly, I've been able to start telling people about it and I've gotten my cousin who lives in Colorado into this sort of thing and now she's helping fight for the cause.
[02:01:09.587 --> 02:01:11.328]  Good!
[02:01:11.328 --> 02:01:22.613]  And, um, one, two things is that I printed out some of your flyers from InfoWars.com and I started posting them around town.
[02:01:23.630 --> 02:01:29.992]  And I instructed my cousin in Colorado to do the same, so we're really helping to get the word out there.
[02:01:29.992 --> 02:01:31.273]  Well, Tom, that's awesome.
[02:01:31.273 --> 02:01:33.233]  I hope people will get this flyer.
[02:01:33.233 --> 02:01:39.155]  There is poison in the tap water, and it has facts about increases in bone cancer and other issues.
[02:01:39.155 --> 02:01:41.036]  It says, demand safe water, demand the truth.
[02:01:41.036 --> 02:01:43.217]  Visit InfoWars.com.
[02:01:43.217 --> 02:01:48.859]  The media will attack this in many towns and cities, and then that will cause a larger debate.
[02:01:49.719 --> 02:01:57.625]  Just like when a fluoride machine breaks in Prescott, Ontario, it gives the public a chance to go in and talk about the poison in the water.
[02:01:57.625 --> 02:02:03.510]  This is a way to put it back on the table and to have a focal point and to point out, hey, this is poison.
[02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:05.611]  How dare you do this?
[02:02:05.611 --> 02:02:06.172]  Exactly.
[02:02:06.172 --> 02:02:16.600]  And the thing is about getting the word out, and especially when it comes to fluoride, is that people don't really know that, like, it's always been presented as a good thing because, oh, it helps fight cavities and stuff like that.
[02:02:18.345 --> 02:02:23.410]  Kind of a big sort of focus shift, I think, but a lot of people are waking up to it.
[02:02:23.410 --> 02:02:30.158]  And now they're presenting lithium to be put in our water to calm us, which is what the fluoride is put in there for.
[02:02:30.158 --> 02:02:33.862]  It's also toxic and to reduce fertility.
[02:02:33.862 --> 02:02:35.543]  But I appreciate your calls.
[02:02:35.543 --> 02:02:36.745]  Do you have any other points, Tom?
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:49.366]  Yeah, one more thing I want to do as far as getting the word out, I'm also like, I have this sort of music group going and we're gonna release an EP soon and it's gonna be called Road to Bohemia, all about Bohemian Grove society and New World Order.
[02:02:49.366 --> 02:02:49.686]  Awesome!
[02:02:52.186 --> 02:02:59.833]  I remember 10 years ago when I snuck in there and blew it wide open, the media ran stories saying I was a liar and hadn't snuck in.
[02:02:59.833 --> 02:03:02.576]  Then a few years later, they admitted that I had snuck in.
[02:03:02.576 --> 02:03:04.718]  The Bohemian Grove responded to it.
[02:03:04.718 --> 02:03:09.863]  And then now it's mainstream news that they have giant homosexual orgies there.
[02:03:09.863 --> 02:03:11.624]  So that's your government.
[02:03:11.624 --> 02:03:13.766]  I mean, that's who they are.
[02:03:13.766 --> 02:03:15.668]  Let's talk to Terrence in Florida.
[02:03:15.668 --> 02:03:16.529]  Terrence, you're on the air.
[02:03:17.639 --> 02:03:21.922]  Thanks for calling.
[02:03:21.922 --> 02:03:34.871]  You said we need to identify the problem and I think one way to do that would be that Oliver North was a government employee.
[02:03:34.871 --> 02:03:38.653]  Child Protective Services are government employees.
[02:03:38.653 --> 02:03:43.657]  The City Council of Austin, Texas are government employees.
[02:03:43.657 --> 02:03:44.177]  The problem
[02:03:44.958 --> 02:03:49.783]  It's these usurpers that have stepped outside the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:04:06.365 --> 02:04:08.287]  And put a face on the threat.
[02:04:08.287 --> 02:04:10.709]  Because as long as we say government's doing this, there's no face.
[02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:14.312]  But if we put a face on the threat, which is the government employee... That's right.
[02:04:14.312 --> 02:04:22.639]  No, it's a mafia that's gone in, overthrown the Bill of Rights and Constitution, overthrown our government, and have put in their own criminal government.
[02:04:22.639 --> 02:04:25.422]  Rogue government is the problem.
[02:04:25.422 --> 02:04:26.322]  Sort of, sort of.
[02:04:26.322 --> 02:04:30.446]  But the old lady at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles is demanding you get
[02:04:31.093 --> 02:04:35.574]  Oh, they're gonna wake up when they get their pay cut, their pensions taken, or fired, or all three.
[02:04:35.574 --> 02:04:37.095]  They're gonna wake up real quick.
[02:04:37.095 --> 02:04:40.595]  Because the taxes are gonna go up, as they are, and the services are gonna be cut off.
[02:04:40.595 --> 02:04:42.036]  So, they're waking up right now.
[02:04:42.036 --> 02:04:42.796]  Good points, Terrence.
[02:05:00.339 --> 02:05:04.545]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:05:04.545 --> 02:05:10.953]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:05:10.953 --> 02:05:15.299]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much
[02:05:15.299 --> 02:05:18.320]  Of course they love these products for bath, hair, laundry and dishes.
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:23.202]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:05:36.127 --> 02:05:42.889]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:05:42.889 --> 02:05:46.771]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:05:46.771 --> 02:05:54.213]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.

[02:08:52.052 --> 02:08:58.956]  Okay, let me go ahead and run through some of this news here dealing with the economy.
[02:08:58.956 --> 02:09:00.857]  Anger mounts over Michelle Obama's
[02:09:02.449 --> 02:09:06.710]  150,000 pound Spanish holiday bill footed by the U.S.
[02:09:06.710 --> 02:09:07.250]  taxpayer.
[02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:14.112]  Then it goes on to talk about how the total security costs are in the millions and millions of dollars.
[02:09:14.112 --> 02:09:16.613]  In fact, here's a story out of the New York Daily News.
[02:09:16.613 --> 02:09:23.975]  Material girl Michelle Obama is a modern-day Marie Antoinette on a glitzy Spanish vacation.
[02:09:23.975 --> 02:09:30.917]  This came out two days after Dr. Paul Craig Roberts wrote a headline about it for InfoWars.com titled, Let Them Eat Cake.
[02:09:31.747 --> 02:09:36.150]  Sacrifice is something that many Americans are becoming all too familiar with during this economic downturn.
[02:09:36.150 --> 02:09:39.332]  It was a key theme in President Obama's inaugural address to the nation.
[02:09:39.332 --> 02:09:41.633]  And he's referenced it numerous times.
[02:09:41.633 --> 02:09:43.374]  Austerity for you!
[02:09:43.374 --> 02:09:46.096]  Lecturing the country on how to get back on its feet.
[02:09:47.059 --> 02:09:53.601]  But while most of the country is pinching pennies, many top government officials, I would add, at the state and county level are getting big raises.
[02:09:53.601 --> 02:09:56.242]  Some of them make hundreds of thousands, up to a million a year.
[02:09:56.242 --> 02:10:03.225]  But while most of the country is pinching pennies and downsizing, summer sojourns are forging them all together, foregoing them.
[02:10:03.225 --> 02:10:07.326]  The Obamas don't seem to be heeding their own advice.
[02:10:07.326 --> 02:10:14.649]  And it goes on to them occupying 60 to 70 rooms everywhere she travels and spending millions and millions of dollars.
[02:10:15.968 --> 02:10:20.331]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:10:20.331 --> 02:10:25.835]  Now, looking at some of the economic news, they're celebrating what they've done to you.
[02:10:25.835 --> 02:10:27.536]  They don't care if you hate Obama.
[02:10:27.536 --> 02:10:34.441]  He knows he'll be removed as a puppet and then he'll be rehabilitated later, just like Bush and Clinton and everybody else.
[02:10:34.441 --> 02:10:36.442]  America is at risk of boiling over.
[02:10:36.442 --> 02:10:40.525]  And out-of-touch leaders don't see the need to cool things off.
[02:10:40.525 --> 02:10:42.146]  No, because they want a revolt.
[02:10:43.234 --> 02:10:48.740]  They're training for urban warfare and civil unrest everywhere.
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:52.804]  That's what they want, but that's a story by Peggy Noonan.
[02:10:52.804 --> 02:10:55.787]  Continuing, Romer to leave the White House.
[02:10:57.005 --> 02:11:06.910]  Christina Romer, Chairwoman of President Obama's Council on Economic Advisers, that's Council of Economic Robbers, has decided to resign according to sources familiar with the plans.
[02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:08.871]  Yeah, mission accomplished.
[02:11:08.871 --> 02:11:12.353]  Now time for the rats to leave the sinking ship.
[02:11:12.353 --> 02:11:13.834]  Here's another one, Washington Times.
[02:11:13.834 --> 02:11:16.836]  Social Security is in the red this year.
[02:11:16.836 --> 02:11:19.938]  It's been in the red for decades.
[02:11:19.938 --> 02:11:22.839]  All there are are receipts in that fund.
[02:11:22.839 --> 02:11:24.040]  They steal your money, folks.
[02:11:25.219 --> 02:11:39.651]  Social Security will pay out more this year than it gets in payroll taxes, making it the first time since the program will be in the red since it was overhauled in 1983, according to the annual authoritative report released Thursday by the program's report.
[02:11:39.651 --> 02:11:47.638]  Meanwhile, President Obama's health care overhaul has given Medicare basic hospital insurance an extra 12 years of financing stability.
[02:11:50.421 --> 02:11:51.461]  Continuing, U.S.
[02:11:51.461 --> 02:11:53.202]  employers shed jobs.
[02:11:53.202 --> 02:11:56.884]  Unemployment rate held steady at 9.5 in July.
[02:11:56.884 --> 02:11:58.965]  It's well over 20%.
[02:11:58.965 --> 02:12:03.287]  But this news sent the stock market tumbling today.
[02:12:03.287 --> 02:12:04.387]  More jobs news.
[02:12:04.387 --> 02:12:10.850]  Job picture worsens with 131,000 losses in the last month.
[02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:12.591]  Remember, those are Cook numbers.
[02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:19.134]  Fox News reports, despite budget cuts, layoff fears, Milwaukee teachers fight for budget-funded Viagra.
[02:12:20.219 --> 02:12:24.402]  Yes, more goodies for them.
[02:12:24.402 --> 02:12:29.945]  Meanwhile, libraries all over the country are being closed, like in Camden, closing a major library.
[02:12:29.945 --> 02:12:32.226]  Let the taxes go up.
[02:12:32.226 --> 02:12:34.788]  City faces hiring borrow cost.
[02:12:34.788 --> 02:12:39.631]  City faces higher borrowing cost as bond rating is downgraded.
[02:12:39.631 --> 02:12:41.172]  This is out of the sun times.
[02:12:42.276 --> 02:12:48.664]  Struggling through its worst ever budget crisis, Chicago has suffered the first in what could be a series of body blows.
[02:12:48.664 --> 02:12:53.429]  A downgrade in the all-important bond rating that determines city borrowing costs.
[02:12:53.429 --> 02:12:58.536]  Yeah, the city goes and takes loans out from private banks, central banks.
[02:12:59.582 --> 02:13:17.422]  That they just make up out of nothing, and then now they've gotten them leveraged where they want them, so now they'll have to pay 10-15% on their loans, on their bonds, and then they won't be able to pay that, and it'll be 30-40% like Zimbabwe or Argentina or Nigeria.
[02:13:18.885 --> 02:13:22.868]  And of course, the United States itself has been downgraded in China now.
[02:13:22.868 --> 02:13:26.671]  Continuing, Postal Service loses $3.5 billion in third quarter.
[02:13:26.671 --> 02:13:30.534]  Reuters reports talks about becoming completely insolvent.
[02:13:30.534 --> 02:13:32.676]  Don't worry, they'll just print more money.
[02:13:32.676 --> 02:13:34.998]  Fannie Mae seeks $1.5 billion from U.S.
[02:13:34.998 --> 02:13:37.980]  Treasury after 12th straight loss.
[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:39.962]  Foreclosures at all time records.
[02:13:43.797 --> 02:13:46.498]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:13:46.498 --> 02:13:49.899]  In an uncertain economy, shoppers are choosy again.
[02:13:49.899 --> 02:13:54.301]  Consumers are buying a lot less, so profits of retail stores are plunging.
[02:13:54.301 --> 02:14:03.465]  Real estate market continues to plunge, both private individuals' homes and, of course, the commercial real estate market.
[02:14:03.965 --> 02:14:13.307]  Let's now go to Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster who joins us in the third hour every Friday to break down what's happening in the economy.
[02:14:13.307 --> 02:14:20.728]  Bob, more and more they say there's no way to get out of the recession that's really a depression.
[02:14:20.728 --> 02:14:26.129]  Here you are three years ago predicting what happened a year later in October of 2008.
[02:14:26.129 --> 02:14:31.170]  You predicted that the stimulus would run out by now over a year and a half ago when they passed it.
[02:14:32.734 --> 02:14:34.494]  Well, we just saw, almost ten, well it was about ten months ago,
[02:14:59.977 --> 02:15:08.303]  The bankers on Wall Street went long the dollar and short the Euro.
[02:15:08.303 --> 02:15:10.384]  And I didn't know why at the time.
[02:15:10.384 --> 02:15:22.232]  We found out when Greece got in the middle of the news along with the other unfortunate countries in the Eurozone that had problems.
[02:15:22.232 --> 02:15:28.196]  What the banks did when the Euro got down around 120 is they covered their shorts
[02:15:29.281 --> 02:15:39.529]  In the in the euro and they sold out their long positions in the dollar and probably reversed them because the dollar has come right back down.
[02:15:39.529 --> 02:15:47.495]  It went from 74 to 89 89 back to almost 80 and it's on its way back to test 74 again.
[02:15:47.495 --> 02:15:54.521]  Now the reason I bring that up is that what they were trying to do was set up a buffer in the dollar.
[02:15:55.490 --> 02:16:00.134]  A place for it to fall from, not from 74, but from 89.
[02:16:00.134 --> 02:16:06.158]  And I think that was the main impetus behind what they did.
[02:16:06.158 --> 02:16:09.981]  Now, what was going to make the dollar come down?
[02:16:09.981 --> 02:16:17.467]  What was going to make the dollar come down was what I talked about about three or four weeks ago.
[02:16:17.467 --> 02:16:21.790]  And that was that I believed that the Fed was going to
[02:16:23.905 --> 02:16:30.270]  Tell the banks to start lending and shut off their interest on the money that they had deposited with the Fed.
[02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:37.855]  What the Fed did is they lent money to the banks at no interest, the banks lent it back to them at 2.5% interest and the U.S.
[02:16:37.855 --> 02:16:41.118]  taxpayer paid for it.
[02:16:41.118 --> 02:16:44.580]  The banks have over a trillion dollars.
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:50.865]  They can lend as much as they want against that on a fractionalized basis.
[02:16:50.865 --> 02:16:51.045]  Now,
[02:16:52.626 --> 02:17:00.170]  The Fed needs five trillion dollars over the next two years to keep the economy from plunging.
[02:17:00.170 --> 02:17:09.275]  And so, if the bankers have a trillion dollars, all I have to do is create four trillion dollars more... So you're saying that... ...so they have the money that they need.
[02:17:09.275 --> 02:17:15.959]  I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, you're saying that's going to be the second stimulus by stealth?
[02:17:15.959 --> 02:17:21.242]  Um, let's call it the third because, um, George the Idiot did the same thing.
[02:17:21.952 --> 02:17:24.555]  So we've had, this is the third one really.
[02:17:24.555 --> 02:17:30.942]  And so this one is going to be done, but it has to be done differently.
[02:17:30.942 --> 02:17:37.329]  Not quite by stealth, because legislature will not give the money for a stimulus package again.
[02:17:37.329 --> 02:17:39.211]  My point is, they're not advertising it.
[02:17:40.316 --> 02:17:41.377]  Not at all.
[02:17:41.377 --> 02:17:52.282]  In fact, they had to have two votes in the Senate to get the $34 million extension for unemployment, and it was very difficult to pass.
[02:17:52.282 --> 02:18:00.405]  And so the Fed knows, and has known, for almost a year, that this was going to be the track that they were going to have to take.
[02:18:00.405 --> 02:18:06.128]  They have people working 24-7, hundreds of them, figuring this stuff out.
[02:18:06.809 --> 02:18:09.690]  So, you know, this doesn't happen overnight to these people.
[02:18:09.690 --> 02:18:17.231]  All right, Bob, here's the $64 million question, because you've been stunningly accurate in the last 12 years on this radio show.
[02:18:17.231 --> 02:18:21.912]  What is this new economic policy, which is really a continuation of the old one?
[02:18:21.912 --> 02:18:25.712]  How is it going to affect the stock market, the economy, housing prices?
[02:18:25.712 --> 02:18:28.133]  What's your prognosis?
[02:18:28.133 --> 02:18:30.173]  We just came from $96.86 to approximately $10,600.
[02:18:36.252 --> 02:18:41.093]  And that's what really keyed me in, you know, about a month ago.
[02:18:41.093 --> 02:18:46.855]  You know, I have to back into everything that these people are doing, because I don't have any connections in the Illuminati.
[02:18:46.855 --> 02:18:55.777]  So, I figured that they were discounting something that was going to happen, and the most natural thing is what I just described to you.
[02:18:55.777 --> 02:18:58.938]  And as it turns out, again, I was correct.
[02:18:58.938 --> 02:19:00.339]  This is where they're heading.
[02:19:00.339 --> 02:19:03.099]  And three trial balloons went up.
[02:19:03.099 --> 02:19:04.800]  The president of the St.
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:05.440]  Louis Fed
[02:19:06.130 --> 02:19:21.716]  The head of PIMCO, I can't pronounce his name, it's an Arabic name, and the third one, that's even though I speak six languages, the third one was Joe Stiglitz.
[02:19:21.716 --> 02:19:31.060]  And so these trial balloons went up and the balloons were saying, we gotta do another stimulus package if we don't, we're doomed.
[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:32.620]  And quite frankly, they're right.
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:34.421]  But the point is, here it is,
[02:19:35.172 --> 02:19:41.418]  Uh, the Fed over the next two or three weeks will tell you that they're going to have to be helpful to the economy.
[02:19:41.418 --> 02:19:43.921]  They won't give you any numbers.
[02:19:43.921 --> 02:19:45.502]  And that's what they're going to do.
[02:19:45.502 --> 02:19:51.628]  You can call it stealth if you want, but it's on the way and everything will go sideways for two years.
[02:19:51.628 --> 02:19:53.369]  Okay, Bob Chapman, stay there.
[02:19:53.369 --> 02:19:56.252]  Let's break down your forecast.
[02:19:56.252 --> 02:19:59.055]  So just this slow easing into depression.
[02:19:59.055 --> 02:20:00.076]  We'll get to tails straight ahead.
[02:20:02.554 --> 02:20:04.315]  What is a wind generator?
[02:20:04.315 --> 02:20:06.717]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[02:20:06.717 --> 02:20:10.059]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[02:20:10.059 --> 02:20:12.021]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[02:21:01.909 --> 02:21:08.352]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[02:21:08.352 --> 02:21:13.594]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.

[02:22:00.586 --> 02:22:03.368]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[02:22:03.368 --> 02:22:05.390]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[02:22:05.390 --> 02:22:06.311]  debt crises.
[02:22:06.311 --> 02:22:07.332]  You heard me right.
[02:22:07.332 --> 02:22:09.814]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[02:22:09.814 --> 02:22:13.477]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[02:22:13.477 --> 02:22:20.343]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[02:22:20.843 --> 02:22:22.104]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:22.104 --> 02:22:29.291]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.

[02:23:52.657 --> 02:23:53.998]  You look like an angel.
[02:23:53.998 --> 02:23:54.938]  Walk like an angel.
[02:24:22.729 --> 02:24:28.012]  Bob, you said the last stimulus would last about a year.
[02:24:28.012 --> 02:24:30.914]  You're saying this one will go sideways for two years?
[02:24:30.914 --> 02:24:34.536]  Because we're... I mean, sideways means we'll continue its trajectory.
[02:24:34.536 --> 02:24:48.944]  Our trajectory is incrementally down in the economy, really not even on life support right now, with layoffs and firings and... So, quantify what sideways means.
[02:24:51.052 --> 02:25:02.300]  Well, first of all, I think that they're going to commit twice the amount of money and credit that they did last time, about $2.5 trillion.
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:04.821]  So that would be $5 trillion in total.
[02:25:04.821 --> 02:25:17.070]  And if it starts here in a couple of weeks and starts to seep into the economy over the next three or four months, then we'll compare it to what they've just done.
[02:25:17.070 --> 02:25:20.432]  They had five quarters, which grossed
[02:25:21.007 --> 02:25:29.590]  GDP growth in this last stimulus timeframe averaged between three and three and a half percent.
[02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:32.351]  We'll say three and a quarter.
[02:25:32.351 --> 02:25:38.853]  Real growth was probably about one and a half percent.
[02:25:38.853 --> 02:25:44.175]  And so the economy wasn't totally tanking, but it wasn't really doing anything.
[02:25:44.175 --> 02:25:46.896]  It was keeping its head above water.
[02:25:46.896 --> 02:25:47.516]  This time,
[02:25:49.211 --> 02:25:55.215]  There's going to be more lending to small and medium-sized businesses if they want the money.
[02:25:55.215 --> 02:26:06.362]  And you'll see a letter to the editor in tomorrow's issue of the Forecaster, where one of the subscribers is an attorney.
[02:26:06.362 --> 02:26:06.882]  No, he's not.
[02:26:06.882 --> 02:26:10.224]  He's a company.
[02:26:10.224 --> 02:26:16.148]  Describes that in the last 15 months, the lenders cut back
[02:26:16.838 --> 02:26:28.902]  Over 25% the amount of money that they normally would have available for small and medium-sized businesses, which creates 70% of the jobs.
[02:26:28.902 --> 02:26:42.286]  Now, normally you would think, well, if the loans are going to be available, they're going to make up to 25% lending, then we're going to have a lot more people working and they're going to take these loans and they're going to expand, etc.
[02:26:42.286 --> 02:26:43.446]  It's not going to happen that way.
[02:26:44.116 --> 02:26:47.978]  And the reason why is too many of these companies have gone out of business.
[02:26:47.978 --> 02:26:53.541]  Too many of the people who run these companies are saying, no, we're not going to get suckered in again on this thing.
[02:26:53.541 --> 02:26:55.742]  And they're going to be cruel about borrowing.
[02:26:56.548 --> 02:27:01.912]  So they're not going to get anywhere near the borrowing that they hope to over that time frame.
[02:27:01.912 --> 02:27:04.334]  But Bob, how does Iran tie in?
[02:27:04.334 --> 02:27:11.359]  I mean, they're really moving towards an attack by Christmas or before then, green lighting it.
[02:27:11.359 --> 02:27:15.783]  And I mean, how will that affect the economy?
[02:27:15.783 --> 02:27:21.347]  Well, first of all, if it's green lighted, Israel will make the attack.
[02:27:23.044 --> 02:27:29.266]  Whether it's on Lebanon, Syria, or directly on Iran remains to be seen.
[02:27:29.266 --> 02:27:34.087]  The possibilities of that happening are excellent.
[02:27:34.087 --> 02:27:36.028]  And how will that affect it?
[02:27:36.028 --> 02:27:41.449]  The Fed is going to go ahead and do what I described, I believe, anyway.
[02:27:41.449 --> 02:27:50.732]  And so instead of getting 3.25% growth, they might get 1.5% including all the stimulus, when in fact the real number should have been minus 1%.
[02:27:51.656 --> 02:27:53.417]  So they're not going to go anywhere.
[02:27:53.417 --> 02:27:56.759]  Unemployment, which is 22.38%, should drop to 20%.
[02:27:56.759 --> 02:28:00.721]  That's the best they're going to do, if they can do that.
[02:28:00.721 --> 02:28:07.824]  And so, you might call it profitless prosperity that cost the American taxpayer $5 trillion.
[02:28:07.824 --> 02:28:17.949]  As far as the war is concerned, like the previous two conflicts, one of which is still involved in Afghanistan, it'll be off-budget.
[02:28:17.949 --> 02:28:19.630]  We're already over a trillion dollars.
[02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:23.112]  What will it cost if it's a third world war?
[02:28:23.112 --> 02:28:26.093]  Probably another five trillion.
[02:28:26.093 --> 02:28:28.834]  And so we're going to have rampant inflation.
[02:28:28.834 --> 02:28:35.016]  And as you've seen, the wages go nowhere.
[02:28:35.016 --> 02:28:44.999]  Real inflation continues at seven or eight percent, whereas the government says it's two or one and a half percent or whatever their bogus number is.
[02:28:44.999 --> 02:28:47.520]  Just like the bogus number for unemployment.
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:47.840]  And so
[02:28:49.372 --> 02:28:58.455]  Part of the unemployment problem will probably be solved if there's a third world war by shipping young people out of the country so they can go over and get slaughtered.
[02:29:00.953 --> 02:29:09.937]  Well, either way you look at the different scenarios involved with an attack on Iran, it runs from horrible to just unbelievably bad.
[02:29:09.937 --> 02:29:13.679]  And what are your military sources telling you?
[02:29:13.679 --> 02:29:20.522]  Because my sources, and a lot of it's also in the mainstream news, are showing a very clear image.
[02:29:21.932 --> 02:29:27.756]  and development towards not just a foreign war but a massive domestic crackdown.
[02:29:27.756 --> 02:29:34.141]  They're really getting the public ready for troops to be used against the American people and for civil unrest.
[02:29:34.141 --> 02:29:36.122]  I mean, that's even in the Wall Street Journal today.
[02:29:36.122 --> 02:29:39.165]  So we'll come back, talk to Bob Chapman about that.
[02:29:39.165 --> 02:29:41.226]  Open the phones up for any issues you want to discuss.
[02:29:41.226 --> 02:29:46.230]  Bob is a jack-of-all-trades, been in this 50 years, fighting the globalists.
[02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:47.711]  We'll discuss it all coming up.
[02:29:47.711 --> 02:29:48.752]  Long segment straight ahead.
[02:29:51.055 --> 02:29:54.986]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.986 --> 02:29:57.674]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.461 --> 02:30:05.424]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:05.424 --> 02:30:06.425]  What have we got?
[02:30:06.425 --> 02:30:08.866]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:08.866 --> 02:30:09.887]  A republic.
[02:30:09.887 --> 02:30:12.529]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:12.529 --> 02:30:14.790]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:16.811]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:16.811 --> 02:30:18.492]  So they think they own our land?
[02:30:18.492 --> 02:30:19.813]  They think they own our water?
[02:30:19.813 --> 02:30:20.413]  Children?
[02:30:20.413 --> 02:30:21.554]  Our education?
[02:30:21.554 --> 02:30:22.375]  Our money?
[02:30:22.375 --> 02:30:26.037]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:30:26.397 --> 02:30:30.162]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:30:30.162 --> 02:30:31.364]  You have been warned.
[02:30:31.364 --> 02:30:32.385]  We have the facts.
[02:30:32.385 --> 02:30:33.547]  We have the Constitution.
[02:30:33.547 --> 02:30:34.468]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:34.468 --> 02:30:35.349]  We have common law.
[02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:37.873]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:37.873 --> 02:30:41.658]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:30:41.738 --> 02:30:46.703]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:30:46.703 --> 02:30:48.204]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:30:48.204 --> 02:30:49.285]  Don't tread on me.

[02:31:00.276 --> 02:31:04.818]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.818 --> 02:31:05.738]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.738 --> 02:31:09.159]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.159 --> 02:31:10.019]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.019 --> 02:31:14.901]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.901 --> 02:31:15.641]  It's true.
[02:31:15.641 --> 02:31:20.523]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.523 --> 02:31:21.343]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.343 --> 02:31:24.925]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.925 --> 02:31:28.626]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.846 --> 02:31:29.627]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.627 --> 02:31:32.409]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.409 --> 02:31:36.092]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.092 --> 02:31:36.873]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.873 --> 02:31:41.017]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.017 --> 02:31:45.781]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:53.544 --> 02:32:54.005]  Thank you.
[02:33:08.647 --> 02:33:13.110]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:20.436]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:20.436 --> 02:33:22.217]  We're back live.
[02:33:22.217 --> 02:33:24.319]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:33:24.319 --> 02:33:26.160]  We're going to take some of your phone calls.
[02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:29.163]  Also want to look at this Bloomberg Businessweek report.
[02:33:29.163 --> 02:33:35.748]  Gold prices extend rally as odious dollar drops versus the euro.
[02:33:36.715 --> 02:33:46.799]  But you notice the euro drops, then the dollar drops, and the euro goes back a little bit, and then the dollar drops, and the dollar will go back a little bit, and the euro drops, then it goes back up, then it drops.
[02:33:46.799 --> 02:33:49.480]  But if you look at the long-term charts, it's all just going down.
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:50.200]  It's concerted.
[02:33:51.186 --> 02:33:56.631]  Coordinated global currency devaluation run by the same group of crooks.
[02:33:56.631 --> 02:34:05.498]  We'll be talking to Bob again here in just a moment, but first I want to tell you about a wonderful made in American company and that's Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:34:05.498 --> 02:34:09.582]  They've got motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, all made in Tennessee and Georgia.
[02:34:09.582 --> 02:34:14.586]  Wonderful people, high quality jeans, made in America, gussetclothing.com.
[02:34:17.488 --> 02:34:26.158]  S-S-E-T, gussetclothing.com, or give them a call, 888-8-GUSSETT, that's 888-8-GUSSETT.
[02:34:26.158 --> 02:34:29.181]  If we don't start buying American, we're dead.
[02:34:29.181 --> 02:34:36.228]  How many people do I know that, you know, say they want to have jobs that go shop at Walmart where it's almost all made in China?
[02:34:36.228 --> 02:34:37.149]  Gussetclothing.com.
[02:34:39.048 --> 02:34:41.910]  I also want to tell you about efoodsdirect.com.
[02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:44.712]  They are the leader in high quality storable foods.
[02:34:44.712 --> 02:34:52.498]  And the reason I bought storable food is the ongoing deepening depression in case society completely collapses or there's World War III.
[02:34:52.498 --> 02:34:57.822]  I mean now more than ever you really are crazy if you don't have high quality storable foods and this is the place.
[02:34:57.822 --> 02:34:58.343]  This is what
[02:34:58.963 --> 02:35:01.326]  Uh, you know, where I've gotten my storable foods.
[02:35:01.326 --> 02:35:05.250]  The letter E, just efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:35:05.250 --> 02:35:09.015]  It's insurance you can eat, store safely for 10 years.
[02:35:09.015 --> 02:35:10.276]  efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:35:13.706 --> 02:35:16.587]  And finally, purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:35:16.587 --> 02:35:18.908]  One word, I'm gonna tell you about purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:35:18.908 --> 02:35:22.749]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit purewaterfreedom.com.

[02:35:35.794 --> 02:35:38.355]  All the filters are made in the USA.

[02:35:40.836 --> 02:35:49.823]  Check out their banners on PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com to take control of your water supply today.
[02:35:49.823 --> 02:35:52.966]  Bob, before we go to calls, gold.
[02:35:52.966 --> 02:36:03.434]  You did say, what, three weeks ago on the show when gold was going down, you said, look for the dollar when it starts going down for gold to go back up.
[02:36:03.434 --> 02:36:09.139]  And going from memory, you said that, and this has been true in the past, that normally the two were somewhat coupled together.
[02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:14.262]  Well, first of all, on Wednesday's issue, I said that on Thursday or Friday, we'd break back out again, and it happened today.
[02:36:37.416 --> 02:36:53.689]  And you just can't keep it down, because I think that the main reason that gold has been as strong as it has over the past 15 months is because it's challenged the dollar as the only real currency in the world.
[02:36:53.689 --> 02:36:55.170]  And that's extraordinarily important.
[02:36:55.170 --> 02:36:57.992]  If you go back 6,000 years, you'll see the same thing.
[02:36:57.992 --> 02:37:03.196]  In the first six months of the year, all currencies fell against gold.
[02:37:03.812 --> 02:37:04.252]  The U.S.
[02:37:04.252 --> 02:37:05.173]  dollar 13.3%.
[02:37:05.173 --> 02:37:12.778]  I mean, if that were to continue, it would be about 25% for the year, which it's been doing for the last 10 years.
[02:37:12.778 --> 02:37:20.183]  But, you know, you don't know about that unless you listen to this program, because the mainline media is not going to tell you that.
[02:37:20.183 --> 02:37:29.350]  So it's going to go back up and challenge its high here over the next little while, which was around $12.60, and it'll go through it and it'll go higher again.
[02:37:30.570 --> 02:37:42.198]  Uh, the gold would have been up substantially more today had not it been for the intercession of the United States government, knocking it down from a plus 15 to about a plus 680.
[02:37:42.198 --> 02:37:44.920]  It's now trading around a plus eight.
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:51.724]  And, uh, you know, they, they are fighting a rear guard action.
[02:37:51.724 --> 02:37:53.045]  They can't win.
[02:37:53.045 --> 02:37:55.907]  And they know that they can't beat gold.
[02:37:56.471 --> 02:38:01.353]  And they're scurrying around, and they're trying to find out, should we use SDRs?
[02:38:01.353 --> 02:38:07.635]  Which have no backing, incidentally, and can't legally have any backing as an IMF instrument.
[02:38:07.635 --> 02:38:12.697]  Or should we have the thing that Keynes talked about called the bank core?
[02:38:12.697 --> 02:38:15.158]  Now they're trying to find alternatives.
[02:38:15.158 --> 02:38:20.540]  Anything that they come up with that does not have gold backing, they better forget it.
[02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:21.660]  Because it isn't going to happen.
[02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:34.369]  Bob, I mean, I'm not a financial wizard, but I can look at the last eight years and gold slowly going up, up, up, up, up.
[02:38:34.369 --> 02:38:40.795]  And if you look at the graph on a monthly or two monthly basis, you see it go up and down.
[02:38:40.795 --> 02:38:43.097]  But over time, it's going straight up.
[02:38:43.097 --> 02:38:50.283]  So people should be able to very easily make profits continually, either in gold stocks or
[02:38:51.571 --> 02:39:02.535]  Well, you're certainly right about that.
[02:39:02.535 --> 02:39:05.836]  And the coins, they continue to go up.
[02:39:05.836 --> 02:39:08.197]  The bullion continues to go up.
[02:39:08.197 --> 02:39:13.979]  The graded numismatic coins continue to go up more because there's only so many of them.
[02:39:13.979 --> 02:39:18.361]  And the shares have gone up very well.
[02:39:18.361 --> 02:39:18.901]  I think that
[02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:28.836]  The graded numismatics are way underpriced, and I think they should be selling higher.
[02:39:28.836 --> 02:39:38.241]  If you go back to the Great Depression between 1929 and 1936, the two leading mines at the time were dome mines and homestake.
[02:39:38.241 --> 02:39:47.687]  Dome went up 558% and homestake went up 474% during an deflationary environment.
[02:39:47.687 --> 02:39:49.348]  Very important, because that tells you
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:56.325]  That gold-related assets are going to do well whether we have inflation or deflation.
[02:39:56.325 --> 02:39:57.626]  It doesn't make any difference.
[02:39:57.626 --> 02:40:12.859]  In fact, I would want to own gold-related assets more during a deflationary period because at least you're going to keep your purchasing power.
[02:40:12.859 --> 02:40:15.441]  Where do you see gold... And that's very important.
[02:40:15.441 --> 02:40:17.223]  Where do you see gold by year end?
[02:40:19.457 --> 02:40:21.118]  Oh, I think we can easily get to $1,650.
[02:40:21.118 --> 02:40:45.769]  And it all depends on what happens if we have an attack in the Middle East on Lebanon, Syria, or Iran, then I would think that that would artificially probably, on a short-term basis, make the dollar stronger, because the United States is geographically far removed from that area.
[02:40:45.769 --> 02:40:46.729]  But gold would go up.
[02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:52.604]  It would be a perfect scenario for gold, and it's going to get fought all the way.
[02:40:52.604 --> 02:40:59.129]  These people, behind the scenes in Washington and London, are going to do everything they can to keep it down.
[02:40:59.129 --> 02:41:01.331]  They will not be successful.
[02:41:01.331 --> 02:41:06.955]  In the final analysis, it'll break out and run and go crazy, the longer they keep this thing down.
[02:41:06.955 --> 02:41:11.599]  You know, they started doing this in 1988, officially and legally.
[02:41:11.599 --> 02:41:13.140]  But, you know, I've been in the market since 1960.
[02:41:14.700 --> 02:41:19.764]  And the 1960s, 60s, 67, and 68, they illegally did it.
[02:41:19.764 --> 02:41:25.107]  And they did it again on October the 19th, 1987.
[02:41:25.107 --> 02:41:26.808]  So this is nothing new.
[02:41:26.808 --> 02:41:28.950]  They know the power of gold.
[02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:40.758]  And if you hark back to what Paul Volcker said when he tried to save the economy, which he actually did during the early 1980s, he said, the only big mistake I made is that I didn't suppress the gold price.
[02:41:41.701 --> 02:41:45.424]  Final question on this issue, then we're going to phone calls and a few other news items.
[02:41:45.424 --> 02:41:48.047]  I want to go over with you here, Bob, before this hour elapses.
[02:41:50.959 --> 02:42:15.131]  It seems what they're doing is trying to just have a slow increase in gold price so people don't psychologically have a gold rush and realize that it's one of the few decent investments out there and that they understand that psychologically it's then perceived as just moderately good investment because they are able to slow its basic increase.
[02:42:15.131 --> 02:42:15.571]  That's true.
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:23.665]  And that they know in the end that it's going to go up considerably and they're not too concerned about that because they own a lot of it.
[02:42:23.665 --> 02:42:24.546]  How much?
[02:42:24.546 --> 02:42:27.008]  I don't know and neither does anybody else.
[02:42:27.008 --> 02:42:33.312]  It's just like we don't know how much gold in Fort Knox belongs to the United States government.
[02:42:33.312 --> 02:42:34.693]  We know it's there.
[02:42:34.693 --> 02:42:37.995]  I do because I have subscribers that guarded it.
[02:42:37.995 --> 02:42:42.058]  So I know firsthand from them that it's there.
[02:42:42.058 --> 02:42:44.140]  But who does it belong to and is it
[02:42:45.293 --> 02:42:48.577]  Tungsten bars that's coated with gold?
[02:42:48.577 --> 02:42:50.179]  We don't know that.
[02:42:50.179 --> 02:42:54.444]  We haven't had an audit since 1954.
[02:42:54.444 --> 02:43:01.153]  And it's strange that Congress wouldn't demand an audit just to make everybody happy and shut people like me up.
[02:43:02.585 --> 02:43:04.106]  Well, they're acting very secretively.
[02:43:04.106 --> 02:43:06.007]  Let's take some phone calls with Bob Chapman.
[02:43:32.605 --> 02:43:34.666]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:34.666 --> 02:43:35.087]  Hey, Bob.
[02:43:35.087 --> 02:43:37.728]  I have a statement and then just a quick question.
[02:43:37.728 --> 02:43:43.231]  Um, quick statement is my cousin actually just sent me a text saying I should listen to NPR.
[02:43:43.231 --> 02:43:49.255]  There's a segment that they just did this morning called Voodoo History Debunking Conspiracy Theories.
[02:43:49.255 --> 02:43:57.300]  So I know there's no question that you are definitely having an effect because ever since over the last, what, two weeks now, a week and a half, you've been asking us to
[02:43:57.819 --> 02:44:02.403]  I mean, out of hundreds of prominent people fighting the globalists, myself and Ron Paul are the most prominent.
[02:44:02.403 --> 02:44:04.384]  Ron Paul even more prominent.
[02:44:21.299 --> 02:44:21.519]  I don't
[02:44:38.087 --> 02:44:42.789]  You'd already have a big awakening happening because things are so bad and so out in the open.
[02:44:42.789 --> 02:44:55.696]  But because we were there being laughed at for decades, some listened, some didn't, now people are really paying attention because patriots, quote, conspiracy theorists, have done a good job of telling the truth.
[02:44:55.696 --> 02:45:00.698]  And so we've got a lot of credibility when the mainstream media and government has lost all their credibility.
[02:45:00.698 --> 02:45:05.641]  Bob Chapman comments on this because the enemy is pulling out all the stops to demonize us.
[02:45:07.096 --> 02:45:08.717]  Well, there's no question about that.
[02:45:08.717 --> 02:45:11.119]  And, uh, there's two things that bother me.
[02:45:11.119 --> 02:45:19.505]  Number one, that we need more help and we need more people on talk radio and writing and telling the world about what's going on.
[02:45:19.505 --> 02:45:21.347]  So please come and help us.
[02:45:21.980 --> 02:45:24.642]  You know, I'm getting old and long in the tooth.
[02:45:24.642 --> 02:45:31.025]  And second of all, I'm deeply disappointed in newsletter writers, with the exception of three or four.
[02:45:31.025 --> 02:45:34.867]  All of them, who know about what's going on, won't talk about it.
[02:45:34.867 --> 02:45:36.168]  And I wish they would.
[02:45:36.168 --> 02:45:38.850]  Because, you know, we could use their help.
[02:45:38.850 --> 02:45:44.553]  And yes, we do have the establishment media, the people behind the scenes,
[02:45:45.063 --> 02:45:48.992]  They are deeply concerned because we're eating their lunch.
[02:45:56.573 --> 02:46:05.980]  In the past, they could just say, fluoride's good for you, but now all these top scientists that even work for the government have the internet to speak out, and they're exposing it.
[02:46:05.980 --> 02:46:15.608]  So the globalists, and it's the same on the economy, war, terrorism, all of it, they're still playing the old game from 10, 20, 30 years ago in the Cold War, where they could just lie to us.
[02:46:15.608 --> 02:46:17.670]  Take the case of Vietnam.
[02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:21.793]  5,000 to 6,000 advisors died in the first four years of the secret war from 60 to 64.
[02:46:23.988 --> 02:46:26.150]  They would just lie to the public and get away with it.
[02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:30.133]  Or they'd stage the Gulf of Tonkin, and it'd take decades for it to come out it was staged.
[02:46:34.141 --> 02:46:40.665]  They've been lying and saying they're not naked body scanning people and saving the images or that it's not dangerous radiation.
[02:46:40.665 --> 02:46:42.747]  Now it's come out they lied.
[02:46:42.747 --> 02:46:50.832]  And so now they're being exposed pretty much in real time, but they still have the old instincts and old habits of just stonewalling us.
[02:46:50.832 --> 02:46:52.573]  And now they look like the naked emperor.
[02:46:52.573 --> 02:46:58.277]  I mean, now they look like clowns.
[02:46:58.277 --> 02:47:00.878]  That's for sure they do.
[02:47:00.878 --> 02:47:02.920]  Let's Josh, any final comments on that?
[02:47:03.643 --> 02:47:04.384]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:47:04.384 --> 02:47:06.665]  I think that, well, they're also conditioning us.
[02:47:06.665 --> 02:47:08.186]  I mean, look, it's so basic.
[02:47:08.186 --> 02:47:15.412]  If you read your toothpaste tube, it even says, do not, if ingest more than a pea-sized amount, call poison control.
[02:47:15.412 --> 02:47:18.854]  How do people not see that and understand that it's a poison?
[02:47:18.854 --> 02:47:19.335]  That's one.
[02:47:19.335 --> 02:47:24.479]  Two, you see the media now pushing American terrorism, American-grown terrorism.
[02:47:24.479 --> 02:47:31.624]  All these people are now being arrested left and right, and they're conditioning us to believe that the American people are the next terrorists.
[02:47:32.108 --> 02:47:41.674]  It is so blatantly obvious, and this goes into my question, which was, were we focusing a lot on Iran being potentially the next war, which I believe it could be?
[02:47:41.674 --> 02:47:47.298]  Well, what about the threat of the North and South Korea turmoil that's going on?
[02:47:47.298 --> 02:47:52.321]  We have China that's doing these military drills, showing their force, showing their power.
[02:47:52.321 --> 02:47:54.262]  Hillary Clinton blaming North Korea for that.
[02:47:54.662 --> 02:47:55.742]  Great points, Josh.
[02:47:55.742 --> 02:47:57.163]  We're running out of time.
[02:47:57.163 --> 02:47:59.163]  Bob, real fast, give us your take.
[02:47:59.163 --> 02:48:00.784]  I think China would invite war, would want war.
[02:48:00.784 --> 02:48:01.464]  1.4 billion people.
[02:48:01.464 --> 02:48:02.764]  I've got to get rid of them.
[02:48:02.764 --> 02:48:04.525]  They've got too many people.
[02:48:04.525 --> 02:48:05.885]  That's why they're eugenicists.
[02:48:05.885 --> 02:48:07.266]  That's why they've signed onto it.
[02:48:23.666 --> 02:48:31.255]  That's right, and we still have Venezuela, which they'd like to knock off and show the people in Latin America that the U.S.
[02:48:31.255 --> 02:48:32.457]  is still king down there.
[02:48:33.010 --> 02:48:37.691]  And so there are other places that could start this thing or get them all going at the same time.
[02:48:37.691 --> 02:48:39.692]  Oh yeah, that's the word and they're admitting it now.
[02:48:39.692 --> 02:48:44.393]  They are planning to hit Iran and probably Venezuela at the same time to the proxy Colombia.
[02:48:44.393 --> 02:48:46.274]  Let's talk to Ryan in Washington.
[02:48:46.274 --> 02:48:47.214]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[02:48:47.214 --> 02:48:50.035]  Hey Alex, hey Bob, I'm going to be really quick here.
[02:48:50.035 --> 02:48:54.836]  Two years ago I was diagnosed with a bone disease called avascular necrosis.
[02:48:55.736 --> 02:48:59.441]  And the doctors have no idea why I got it.
[02:48:59.441 --> 02:49:01.383]  Idiopathic is the reason that they gave me.
[02:49:01.383 --> 02:49:02.344]  They don't know why.
[02:49:02.344 --> 02:49:03.705]  Really?
[02:49:03.705 --> 02:49:06.248]  All the studies show it's directly linked to fluoride.
[02:49:06.248 --> 02:49:06.929]  Exactly.
[02:49:06.929 --> 02:49:11.894]  And this is why I started listening to you shortly after I was diagnosed with this.
[02:49:11.894 --> 02:49:14.177]  And I put two and two together, although I can't prove it.
[02:49:14.597 --> 02:49:16.058]  No, no, that's the major studies.
[02:49:16.058 --> 02:49:18.940]  Bone cancer, macular degeneration, all of it.
[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:20.441]  No, that's the government knows that.
[02:49:20.441 --> 02:49:24.123]  The doctors, though, block out because the government's putting it in the water.
[02:49:24.123 --> 02:49:26.044]  That can't be it.
[02:49:26.044 --> 02:49:31.267]  And then even when the vaccines are killing kids en masse, they come out and say, OK, it's killing them.
[02:49:31.267 --> 02:49:34.409]  But you're still a conspiracy theorist for not liking it.
[02:49:34.409 --> 02:49:35.169]  Right.
[02:49:35.169 --> 02:49:37.891]  The solution they gave me was find a surgeon.
[02:49:37.891 --> 02:49:39.772]  I need total hip replacements, both hips.
[02:49:40.253 --> 02:49:48.595]  But I can't find a surgeon to do the surgery, but they want to give me Oxycontin or push me on these pain pills, which I have refused.
[02:49:48.595 --> 02:49:49.435]  No, no.
[02:49:49.435 --> 02:49:56.696]  They hurt you, they hit you with a weapon, and then they sell you the solution.
[02:49:56.696 --> 02:50:00.677]  So I have refused the narcotics.
[02:50:00.677 --> 02:50:02.618]  That's all I really got to say.
[02:50:02.618 --> 02:50:04.658]  Just don't drink the water.
[02:50:05.598 --> 02:50:05.858]  Get mad.
[02:50:05.858 --> 02:50:06.438]  I'm mad.
[02:50:06.438 --> 02:50:07.899]  I'm mad about it.
[02:50:07.899 --> 02:50:17.902]  Well, what happens is, and I'm boiling this down into layman's terms from the scientific reports I've read, is it calcifies in the bones, and then it causes abnormal bone growth.
[02:50:17.902 --> 02:50:20.583]  And, uh, I mean, thyroidism.
[02:50:20.583 --> 02:50:24.764]  How many women do you know that are 20 years old and have a thyroid of a 75-year-old?
[02:50:24.764 --> 02:50:28.785]  I mean, every restaurant I sit in, half the time I hear women talking about their thyroids.
[02:50:28.785 --> 02:50:29.966]  Sodium fluoride.
[02:50:29.966 --> 02:50:33.287]  Bob, why do you think the media has come out and admitted they want to put lithium in the water lately?
[02:50:35.276 --> 02:50:42.599]  Probably because it's another blatant move forward in their move to let everybody know how powerful they are.
[02:50:42.599 --> 02:50:43.179]  Exactly.
[02:50:43.179 --> 02:50:48.882]  It's, hey, we're going to put lithium in your water, and it's going to be in every major newspaper promoting it.
[02:50:48.882 --> 02:50:55.504]  And when Alex Jones comes out and says it's a bad idea, Wired Magazine is going to tell their readers it doesn't exist because they have nothing but contempt for you.
[02:50:55.504 --> 02:50:56.485]  We'll be back with more calls.
[02:50:56.485 --> 02:50:56.885]  Stay with us.
[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:04.341]  This is not a drill.
[02:51:04.341 --> 02:51:06.863]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:51:06.863 --> 02:51:08.745]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:51:08.745 --> 02:51:15.970]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:51:15.970 --> 02:51:20.374]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:51:20.374 --> 02:51:30.682]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:51:30.862 --> 02:51:32.502]  Under any circumstance.
[02:51:32.502 --> 02:51:39.704]  These and other closely guarded gun cashing secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:51:39.704 --> 02:51:40.404]  But listen up.
[02:51:40.404 --> 02:51:46.665]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:51:46.665 --> 02:51:48.505]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:51:48.505 --> 02:51:50.665]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[02:51:50.665 --> 02:51:51.146]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:51:51.146 --> 02:51:53.026]  Before they come for your guns.
[02:51:53.026 --> 02:51:53.646]  Hideyourguns.com.
[02:51:53.646 --> 02:51:54.226]  Right now.
[02:52:00.931 --> 02:52:03.293]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.293 --> 02:52:05.634]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.634 --> 02:52:08.856]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.856 --> 02:52:13.959]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.959 --> 02:52:18.142]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.462 --> 02:52:20.805]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.805 --> 02:52:23.688]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.688 --> 02:52:26.611]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.611 --> 02:52:34.220]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.540 --> 02:52:39.845]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.845 --> 02:52:42.248]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.248 --> 02:52:46.472]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.472 --> 02:52:47.553]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.553 --> 02:52:48.894]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.894 --> 02:52:50.395]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:00.165 --> 02:53:08.369]  Gulf War vets, 9-11 workers, people around the Gulf oil spill fumes, all were exposed to toxic chemicals in the air and became ill.
[02:53:08.369 --> 02:53:11.030]  Even in your home, air contamination can make you sick.

[02:53:19.473 --> 02:53:21.774]  You cannot trust anyone to do it for you.

[02:54:07.834 --> 02:54:09.735]  Okay, let's move quick!
[02:54:09.735 --> 02:54:12.857]  Let's talk to Tonya in mass, then Rasheed, Lisa, and Joe.
[02:54:12.857 --> 02:54:13.798]  We have time.
[02:54:13.798 --> 02:54:15.059]  Quick questions or comments.
[02:54:15.059 --> 02:54:16.200]  Tonya, good to have you call.
[02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:16.540]  Welcome.
[02:54:17.645 --> 02:54:25.174]  Hey Alex, thanks a lot for all the truth that you're spreading and I appreciate you putting yourself on the line to let the word out.
[02:54:25.174 --> 02:54:32.484]  Real quick, I just wanted to say that yesterday you were talking about privacy and how we're all pretty much conditioned.
[02:54:33.064 --> 02:54:38.311]  That, you know, hey, look at me, look at me, I'm a celebrity with our youth being attacked.
[02:54:38.311 --> 02:54:44.660]  We're basically submitting to like, hey, here's, you know, here's my life, here's everything, invade it.
[02:54:44.660 --> 02:54:47.003]  And in turn, everything's cohesive.
[02:54:47.003 --> 02:54:47.784]  It all connects.
[02:54:48.365 --> 02:54:49.887]  Talking about vaccines.
[02:54:49.887 --> 02:54:52.331]  How vaccines destroy our immune systems.
[02:54:52.331 --> 02:54:55.336]  Then they bank and capitalize on everybody getting ill.
[02:54:55.336 --> 02:55:00.905]  And it just keeps going on with the food industry, and the FDA, and the CDC, and then the financial institutions.
[02:55:00.905 --> 02:55:01.826]  It just makes sense.
[02:55:01.826 --> 02:55:02.968]  And when you tell people this...
[02:55:03.777 --> 02:55:07.242]  I can see your rant and you freak out because they think you're a nutbag.
[02:55:07.242 --> 02:55:10.646]  And then later on, they're like, oh, should've listened.
[02:55:10.646 --> 02:55:16.053]  And I think we all need to rally up and do something, like quick, because it's getting to a point where we're divided.
[02:55:16.053 --> 02:55:18.376]  You're either on their side or you're on this side.
[02:55:18.937 --> 02:55:26.521]  Well, Tonya, move on to those that want to hear, but just protect those children I hear in the background and continue to tell the truth.
[02:55:26.521 --> 02:55:29.683]  And then, as you said, later they come back to you and say, wow, you were right.
[02:55:29.683 --> 02:55:34.546]  I mean, how people, the government and corporations are assaulting your children.
[02:55:34.546 --> 02:55:41.930]  And now they've had 40 billionaires put their money in a tax-free kitty that they're going to make money out of funding all of this.
[02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:49.072]  And they have another major Rockefeller study about vaccines to sterilize you that they publicly publish.
[02:55:49.072 --> 02:55:51.532]  Bob Chapman.
[02:55:51.532 --> 02:56:05.756]  You're absolutely right and this young lady who has just been on the phone is a perfect example of the people who are going to carry this thing forward for us and the young men and the young men that were on earlier and just keep it up.
[02:56:05.756 --> 02:56:07.436]  If you do what you can do
[02:56:08.278 --> 02:56:12.641]  Uh, everybody will be able to come out relatively okay on the end.
[02:56:12.641 --> 02:56:13.742]  Let's move quick.
[02:56:13.742 --> 02:56:14.923]  Lisa in California.
[02:56:14.923 --> 02:56:15.583]  You're on the air.
[02:56:15.583 --> 02:56:18.205]  Hi, Alex.
[02:56:18.205 --> 02:56:24.450]  Um, I wanted to suggest an idea, another idea for you to push people to do to get back at the banks.
[02:56:24.450 --> 02:56:27.372]  And I think people should be encouraged to open
[02:56:28.428 --> 02:56:33.012]  Leave the major banks and go to credit unions and their small local banks, Booth.
[02:56:33.012 --> 02:56:33.653]  I agree.
[02:56:33.653 --> 02:56:37.056]  The banker takeover is about shutting down local banks.
[02:56:37.056 --> 02:56:38.698]  Bob Chapman talks about that.
[02:56:38.698 --> 02:56:39.278]  Gotta move.
[02:56:39.278 --> 02:56:40.479]  Great points, Lisa.
[02:56:40.479 --> 02:56:41.961]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:56:41.961 --> 02:56:43.342]  Be sure and call me then.
[02:56:43.342 --> 02:56:44.603]  Rasheed in Maryland.
[02:56:44.603 --> 02:56:45.804]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:56:45.804 --> 02:56:47.746]  Go ahead.
[02:56:47.746 --> 02:56:48.547]  Thank you, Ms.
[02:56:48.547 --> 02:56:49.187]  Jones.
[02:56:49.187 --> 02:56:50.008]  Mr. Chapman,
[02:56:50.521 --> 02:56:51.501]  I'm going to be quick.
[02:56:51.501 --> 02:56:53.262]  A couple of things I just wanted to point out.
[02:56:53.262 --> 02:57:05.565]  One of the things that I've done, just recently becoming an Infowarrior, I've gone online, I've ordered little pocket-sized books with the Constitution, Bill of Rights in them.
[02:57:05.565 --> 02:57:09.326]  I've made mass copies of the Obama Deception.
[02:57:09.326 --> 02:57:11.607]  I missed the sale that you had there.
[02:57:11.607 --> 02:57:15.608]  I'm going to get on top of the rise, excuse me, fall of the Republic.
[02:57:15.608 --> 02:57:18.209]  What I'm doing is, along with that copy of the DVD,
[02:57:18.883 --> 02:57:22.305]  I'm handing them copies of the pocket-sized Bill of Rights.
[02:57:22.305 --> 02:57:27.308]  You can get them for a couple of cents on the dollar, and the copies of the Constitution and Bill of Rights in there.
[02:57:27.308 --> 02:57:29.530]  Just inform those.
[02:57:29.530 --> 02:57:34.413]  Another thing I want to point out real quick, on top of the fluoride, I'm 36 years old.
[02:57:34.413 --> 02:57:34.853]  I remember
[02:57:35.413 --> 02:57:42.117]  You know, back in the 80s and 90s, my father talking about fluoride and water, how good, how bad it was, excuse me, how bad it was for his family.
[02:57:42.117 --> 02:57:43.919]  I'm from a family of seven.
[02:57:43.919 --> 02:57:45.640]  You don't see that much anymore.
[02:57:45.640 --> 02:57:50.743]  And him ordering, you know, weekly supplies of those, uh, Deer Park water jugs or so.
[02:57:50.743 --> 02:57:59.389]  Uh, and on that, uh, the Centrum and, uh, one of the big, uh, vitamin companies out there, along with the GNC,
[02:58:00.942 --> 02:58:13.825]  I'm out of time, Rasheed.
[02:58:13.825 --> 02:58:14.985]  Great points.
[02:58:14.985 --> 02:58:20.107]  I tell you, Bob Chapman, it's great to hear how informed people are.
[02:58:20.107 --> 02:58:25.108]  I love it, and I want them to keep on doing it, and thanks for listening, all of you.
[02:58:25.108 --> 02:58:28.969]  Bob will talk to you again, God willing, next Friday during the third hour.
[02:58:28.969 --> 02:58:29.389]  Take care.
[02:58:30.598 --> 02:58:32.579]  Bye-bye, and you too.
[02:58:32.579 --> 02:58:42.362]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, coming up in the hour on Infowars.com and the radio stations, I'm going to be covering the Rockefellers and a lot more.
[02:58:42.362 --> 02:58:43.742]  You are listening to GCN.
