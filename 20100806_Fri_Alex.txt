[00:00.000 --> 00:09.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.520 --> 00:10.520]  You want answers?
[00:10.520 --> 00:12.520]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.520 --> 00:16.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16.840 --> 00:21.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.360 --> 00:26.520]  Welcome, my friends, welcome, and thank you for joining us for another live transmission.
[00:26.520 --> 00:35.000]  It is the sixth day of August 2010 on this Friday transmission, coming up in the third
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.640]  hour, Bob Chapman with his weekly visit on the economy.
[00:38.640 --> 00:41.080]  And it's a good time to have him on.
[00:41.080 --> 00:47.000]  July unemployment, we've lost 131,000 more jobs.
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.560]  Governments now revise payrolls for May-June, show 97,000 fewer jobs than first reported,
[00:53.560 --> 00:57.640]  and the unemployment numbers are overall up, even in the cook numbers.
[00:57.640 --> 01:03.440]  There's an odd mix of very bad news coming out, and stocks are tumbling.
[01:03.440 --> 01:09.920]  Meanwhile, they're spending tens of millions of dollars a day for Michelle Obama or Marie
[01:09.920 --> 01:16.200]  Antoinette, as even the New York Daily News is calling her, to run all over Spain and
[01:16.200 --> 01:22.960]  take over entire sections of hotel rooms for them to celebrate different birthday parties
[01:22.960 --> 01:23.960]  and things.
[01:23.960 --> 01:27.560]  It's just an illustration of how corrupt this society is.
[01:27.560 --> 01:34.280]  I have a whole bunch of really important news, but I've been on a week-long rant, taking
[01:34.280 --> 01:39.960]  very few calls, and so I want to sometimes mix things up a bit.
[01:39.960 --> 01:43.640]  I'm going to just not even get into the news, and I'm going to go directly to your phone
[01:43.640 --> 01:47.000]  calls for this full first hour.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.680]  Then much of the second hour will be news interspersed with calls, and then, of course,
[01:53.680 --> 01:57.360]  Bob Chapman will be joining us.
[01:57.360 --> 01:59.480]  I'm going to be honest with people.
[01:59.480 --> 02:03.520]  When I get in my yelling, screaming mode, and start hyperventilating, it's just because
[02:03.520 --> 02:05.080]  I'm desperate.
[02:05.080 --> 02:07.000]  I'm upset.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.120]  I'm very distraught over the fact that we've analyzed things correctly, that we've been
[02:12.120 --> 02:17.200]  right all along, and that things are actually worse than I'd always thought.
[02:17.200 --> 02:24.000]  We just have a completely evil government run by completely wicked corporations.
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.280]  I have to watch the news everywhere reporting on the altruism, the, quote, charity of the
[02:30.280 --> 02:36.040]  philanthropy of the 40 billionaires of the United States, putting their money into a
[02:36.040 --> 02:37.960]  tax-free foundation.
[02:37.960 --> 02:44.360]  I see them praising George Soros, Ted Turner, Bella Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, all anti-freedom
[02:44.360 --> 02:45.840]  globalist.
[02:45.840 --> 02:51.480]  Elena Kagan has been confirmed to the Supreme Court, as you know, openly anti-free speech,
[02:51.480 --> 03:00.560]  viciously anti-second amendment, viciously anti-family, viciously anti-sovereignty.
[03:00.560 --> 03:06.040]  I know the Rockefellers more than 100 years ago invented philanthropy because people kept
[03:06.040 --> 03:07.920]  pointing out they gave no money to charity.
[03:07.920 --> 03:12.960]  They had giant monopolies and were routinely murdering entire towns of people whenever
[03:12.960 --> 03:13.960]  they wanted their property.
[03:13.960 --> 03:18.560]  Oh, yeah, the Rockefellers are so powerful, even over 100 years ago, they would just,
[03:18.560 --> 03:26.040]  from Pennsylvania to Colorado to California, you could just type in Rockefeller-funded
[03:26.040 --> 03:31.640]  massacre and read mainstream media reports, university history.
[03:31.640 --> 03:35.880]  But they know the spirit of resistance was defeating them, so they had to then start
[03:35.880 --> 03:39.720]  posing in the last 100 years as philanthropists.
[03:39.720 --> 03:45.640]  And then we have the tax-free foundation hearings in the 50s, 60s, and 70s in Congress
[03:45.640 --> 03:49.760]  that found that the Carnegie Endowment for Peace is really the Carnegie Endowment for
[03:49.760 --> 03:56.120]  War, that the Rockefeller Foundation is hell-bent on drugging the water supply.
[03:56.120 --> 04:02.200]  There's another Rockefeller Foundation report from the 60s that one of our great writers
[04:02.200 --> 04:03.200]  pulled up.
[04:03.200 --> 04:09.600]  It's unlimited, unlimited for all intents and purposes, that one of our writers pulled
[04:09.600 --> 04:13.680]  up the quotes about how they were going to drug the water supply and the vaccines with
[04:13.680 --> 04:21.560]  viruses that carry a hormone on their back, so your body creates an autoimmune response
[04:21.560 --> 04:29.120]  to that.
[04:29.120 --> 04:30.680]  I mean, I don't like doing this radio show.
[04:30.680 --> 04:32.520]  You understand this isn't about entertainment.
[04:32.520 --> 04:36.520]  It's not about any of that.
[04:36.520 --> 04:39.280]  This is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:39.280 --> 04:45.440]  And I'm watching these people, like Ted Turner, who invested a billion bucks in the UN and
[04:45.440 --> 04:50.280]  has made close to a billion back on top of it because it's tax-free.
[04:50.280 --> 04:51.280]  It's a scam.
[04:51.280 --> 04:53.680]  They're not giving any of their money away.
[04:53.680 --> 04:54.680]  They are tax-free.
[04:54.680 --> 04:55.680]  Get the joke.
[04:55.680 --> 04:56.680]  We'll be right back.
[04:56.680 --> 05:03.880]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[05:03.880 --> 05:04.880]  Tyranny is here.
[05:04.880 --> 05:08.680]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[05:08.680 --> 05:11.400]  It really says that the state is God.
[05:11.400 --> 05:15.920]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[05:15.920 --> 05:17.160]  on Earth.
[05:17.160 --> 05:21.960]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being
[05:21.960 --> 05:23.800]  expanded nationwide.
[05:23.800 --> 05:28.040]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[05:28.040 --> 05:29.880]  powerful shadow state.
[05:29.880 --> 05:33.920]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[05:33.920 --> 05:38.360]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[05:38.360 --> 05:43.440]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[05:43.440 --> 05:44.440]  corner.
[05:44.440 --> 05:47.680]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[05:47.680 --> 05:49.720]  The police state isn't coming.
[05:49.720 --> 05:50.720]  It's here.

[06:31.120 --> 06:35.120]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[06:35.120 --> 06:41.920]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[06:41.920 --> 06:46.000]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[06:46.000 --> 06:57.320]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 to visit our website, 5starsoap.com, for buying our 1-2 month soap
[06:57.320 --> 06:58.320]  sampler.
[06:58.320 --> 06:59.320]  Thank you.
[06:59.320 --> 07:05.040]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[07:05.040 --> 07:09.880]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[07:09.880 --> 07:13.880]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[07:13.880 --> 07:18.120]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[07:18.120 --> 07:23.760]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[07:23.760 --> 07:30.640]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream, with continued
[07:30.640 --> 07:34.080]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[07:34.080 --> 07:39.680]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[07:39.680 --> 07:44.960]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[07:44.960 --> 07:50.920]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[07:50.920 --> 07:59.560]  Silver Lungs Generator, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[07:59.560 --> 08:10.520]  What we've got here is failure to communicate, some man you just can't reach.
[08:10.520 --> 08:17.520]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[08:17.520 --> 08:19.520]  Well, he is.
[08:19.520 --> 08:26.000]  I don't like it anymore.
[08:26.000 --> 08:52.600]  It is Friday, the 6th day of August 2010, I'm Alex Jones, your host, masses of vital
[08:52.600 --> 08:56.640]  news and information will be covered today.
[08:56.640 --> 09:05.360]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the hours of this transmission, the toll-free
[09:05.360 --> 09:18.640]  number to join us, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231 to talk about any of the issues that are
[09:18.640 --> 09:19.640]  out there.
[09:19.640 --> 09:24.040]  There's a major national poll that's been conducted, we're going to be covering.
[09:24.040 --> 09:31.640]  Six in ten Americans don't believe Obama was really born in the United States.
[09:31.640 --> 09:36.440]  That's a full spectrum poll of Republicans, Democrats and independents.
[09:36.440 --> 09:41.520]  The globalists have failed and failed miserably, but only on one level.
[09:41.520 --> 09:47.400]  He is nothing but a shield, just like an ancient gladiator or Roman centurion would have a
[09:47.400 --> 09:56.080]  shield and when it was bashed in and used up, they would throw it down and take up another.
[09:56.080 --> 10:02.000]  They'll put in Mitt Romney or Sarah Palin or General Petraeus, somebody like that, and
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.160]  then that shield in four to eight years will be destroyed.
[10:06.160 --> 10:16.220]  They'll then pick up another frontman, another shield, but we're going to cover all of this
[10:16.220 --> 10:18.920]  news today.
[10:18.920 --> 10:23.160]  Throughout the week, I have been pleading with the public to look at these new classes
[10:23.160 --> 10:27.600]  of viruses that we've talked about for a decade, but that they're now rolling out against
[10:27.600 --> 10:34.080]  the public that go in and attack the neurons, the receptors, and that render you basically
[10:34.080 --> 10:39.040]  helpless where you cannot become angry, where you cannot engage in self-preservation.
[10:39.040 --> 10:43.520]  Sodium fluoride does the same thing.
[10:43.520 --> 10:49.240]  So does lithium, and they're pushing all that in the water, but I do want to get into a
[10:49.240 --> 10:53.560]  whole bunch of other news that we haven't really gotten into this week that's been breaking,
[10:53.560 --> 10:56.600]  and people keep emailing me and asking me, what do you think about the mosque at Ground
[10:56.600 --> 10:58.160]  Zero?
[10:58.160 --> 11:01.480]  They keep calling me, you know, saying, what do you think about all these different Democrats
[11:01.480 --> 11:02.480]  getting indicted?
[11:02.480 --> 11:04.920]  They're just all a bunch of crooks.
[11:04.920 --> 11:09.000]  As for the mosque at Ground Zero, I've actually researched it.
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.480]  It's a very complex issue, but overall it's a distraction.
[11:13.480 --> 11:19.440]  From the big news that affects us all, it is a liberal Muslim group that is building
[11:19.440 --> 11:28.320]  it that is kind of a World Council of Churches-type organization connected into the United Nations,
[11:28.320 --> 11:32.840]  and that's why you've got liberal Jewish groups that support it in New York City there in
[11:32.840 --> 11:33.840]  Lower Manhattan.
[11:33.840 --> 11:36.440]  The ADL does not support it.
[11:36.440 --> 11:44.240]  They're just playing along with the clash of civilizations' propaganda that all Muslims
[11:44.240 --> 11:48.520]  want to kill the American people.
[11:48.520 --> 11:53.440]  When in truth, on record, our government for 50-plus years has been trying to put radical
[11:53.440 --> 11:55.240]  Muslims in power.
[11:55.240 --> 11:58.840]  They don't want mainline first-world countries over there.
[11:58.840 --> 12:07.480]  They want to overthrow westernized nations and put in radicals that they can then have
[12:07.480 --> 12:10.600]  a pretext to have wars with.
[12:10.600 --> 12:22.080]  But I do think, because of the massive backlash against the mosque at Ground Zero, that the
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.680]  group is playing in to the propaganda.
[12:27.680 --> 12:34.440]  It of course fits into the idea that Muslims carried out the attacks of 9-11, and I'm sorry.
[12:34.440 --> 12:39.160]  I've looked at the attacks, we've researched it, and we know the official story is a lie.
[12:39.160 --> 12:42.640]  We know that 9-11 was a staged event.
[12:42.640 --> 12:48.920]  Now the exact details are still murky, but we know the official story is a lie.
[12:48.920 --> 12:55.320]  But we do know that the supposed hijackers were double US agents slash British and Israeli.
[12:55.320 --> 13:00.640]  That's AP, UPI, Fox News, Herets, Jerusalem Post, even admit that.
[13:00.640 --> 13:02.880]  It's just hidden in plain view.
[13:02.880 --> 13:07.880]  We know that US forces were massing around Afghanistan, and that Bush had signed the
[13:07.880 --> 13:12.880]  launch order to begin the invasion in the next two months on September 10th.
[13:12.880 --> 13:14.840]  We do know NORAD stood down.
[13:14.840 --> 13:19.560]  The CIA ran drills of the exact same targets being attacked at the exact same time, so
[13:19.560 --> 13:30.440]  that the different federal agencies like NORAD and the Federal Aviation Administration would
[13:30.440 --> 13:32.920]  become confused.
[13:32.920 --> 13:34.280]  The list goes on and on.
[13:34.280 --> 13:37.560]  We know that they blew up Building 7 in front of everyone and said, get back, we're blowing
[13:37.560 --> 13:38.560]  it up.
[13:38.560 --> 13:44.160]  We have all the countless newscast reporting that.
[13:44.160 --> 13:47.720]  So there, I've talked about the mosque, and I mean, I really hope people don't call in
[13:47.720 --> 13:52.880]  about it because it's an overall distraction.
[13:52.880 --> 13:58.000]  We have all this incredible financial news coming out that Social Security is insolvent
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.840]  and is in the red, that unemployment is much worse than the government had said, that we
[14:02.840 --> 14:07.640]  never came out of the recession, that we're in a depression.
[14:07.640 --> 14:12.520]  The banks that engineered this collapse to gain more power have openly begun given expanded
[14:12.520 --> 14:18.880]  power, and so has the Federal Trade Commission.
[14:18.880 --> 14:21.440]  I've got it all here in front of me.
[14:21.440 --> 14:30.800]  There's positive news, Mexico was spurred by the United States in the last four years
[14:30.800 --> 14:38.960]  to be given more than $15 billion a year of U.S. tax money to launch military operations
[14:38.960 --> 14:44.600]  against four major cartels that are not laundering their money through Federal Reserve controlled
[14:44.600 --> 14:46.400]  banks.
[14:46.400 --> 14:52.080]  I remember the similar situation in 99 in Columbia, Grasso at the time, the head of
[14:52.080 --> 14:54.480]  the New York Stock Exchange was in Reuters.
[14:54.480 --> 14:58.880]  He traveled to meet with the head of the FARC and openly in the news said, you will invest
[14:58.880 --> 15:04.120]  your money with us or we will have the U.S. Marine Corps and Army invade you.
[15:04.120 --> 15:08.640]  The head of the FARC said no and was killed right after that, very soon after that, and
[15:08.640 --> 15:14.480]  the invasion began, and it's the same thing, but Mexico is losing the war against the cowboy
[15:14.480 --> 15:23.520]  cartels and the U.S.-backed gangs, and that is imploding, and so Mexico is now so desperate
[15:23.520 --> 15:28.640]  that they are talking about full legalization of drugs, and of course the cartels are now
[15:28.640 --> 15:31.960]  threatening to kill any politicians that try that.
[15:31.960 --> 15:37.760]  Drug dealers do not want drugs legalized, and that's a very simple thing to understand.
[15:37.760 --> 15:43.320]  They want to keep it illegal, so they make large profits in the black market, but that's
[15:43.320 --> 15:44.320]  in the Guardian.
[15:44.320 --> 15:50.880]  Mexico looks to legalize drugs as the drug war murders hit 28,000 and counting and spills
[15:50.880 --> 15:56.640]  across into the Southwestern United States from Texas to California, and all points in
[15:56.640 --> 16:02.920]  between as far north as Illinois, they're having serious gang war problems with this,
[16:02.920 --> 16:07.960]  and there's more and more even Republicans and not just Democrats calling for legalization,
[16:07.960 --> 16:13.000]  decriminalization of narcotics, not because narcotics are good, but because 80 years ago
[16:13.000 --> 16:18.000]  when they were sold on store shelves everywhere, you had far less people using them.
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.640]  Only losers were on Lodinum, opium.
[16:21.640 --> 16:26.400]  Only losers drank three or four Coca-Cola's a day and had heart attacks doing it because
[16:26.400 --> 16:27.600]  it was full of cocaine.
[16:27.600 --> 16:29.880]  It's called Coke, hidden in plain view.
[16:29.880 --> 16:34.520]  I get emails every time I say Coca-Cola in the past that cocaine in it.
[16:34.520 --> 16:37.200]  It's called Coke.
[16:37.200 --> 16:41.480]  The magic flavor, the secret ingredient is decaf Coke.
[16:41.480 --> 16:48.640]  Just like you have decaf coffee, they de-coconate cocaine, but the molecules still have some
[16:48.640 --> 16:49.640]  of the same effects.
[16:49.640 --> 16:51.360]  That's why you like Coke and Pepsi.
[16:51.360 --> 16:57.360]  It's not just the luscious cancer growing corn syrup that imbibes them.
[16:57.360 --> 17:01.400]  It is the de-coconated cocaine, Coke.
[17:01.400 --> 17:05.960]  It's called Coke-A-Cola, cocaine-A-Cola.
[17:05.960 --> 17:07.800]  I know you think it's a conspiracy.
[17:07.800 --> 17:12.320]  I understand, but it's a fact, it's a historical fact, Coke.
[17:12.320 --> 17:18.800]  Coke is it, Coke is it, Coke is it, decriminalize now.
[17:18.800 --> 17:23.560]  Take the fellow reserves, main cash crop away, decriminalize opium.
[17:23.560 --> 17:25.760]  Our troops will stop dying in Afghanistan.
[17:25.760 --> 17:27.200]  They're there openly growing it now.
[17:27.200 --> 17:30.920]  All right, I'm already ranting.
[17:30.920 --> 17:33.960]  We're going to take your calls now throughout this hour and much of the next.
[17:33.960 --> 17:38.480]  I've got all this news, we will cover it all, like Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines
[17:38.480 --> 17:41.840]  for mass scale fertility reduction.
[17:41.840 --> 17:47.040]  That's an infowars.com story by one of our great writers.
[17:47.040 --> 17:52.040]  But if you simply go and read it, it's linked to the Rockefeller Foundation.
[17:52.040 --> 17:54.040]  Okay.
[17:54.040 --> 17:59.520]  There's a reason your wife can't get pregnant.
[17:59.520 --> 18:03.760]  There's a reason.
[18:03.760 --> 18:06.240]  There's a reason the sperm counts down by 85%.
[18:06.240 --> 18:14.160]  I mean, we're not just up here on air saying this to entertain you.
[18:14.160 --> 18:20.840]  Every day I see five, 10, 15, depending on the day, or more articles where it's on record
[18:20.840 --> 18:24.680]  that they know that we know that they're poisoning us and sterilizing us.
[18:24.680 --> 18:27.280]  So now they're coming out saying, yeah, it's a good thing.
[18:27.280 --> 18:28.720]  We love you.
[18:28.720 --> 18:31.880]  We're going to give you a shot so you can't get angry at us.
[18:31.880 --> 18:35.400]  Of course this criminal government is drugging the water.
[18:35.400 --> 18:40.240]  Of course they're storing the naked body scans of you at the airport and bathing in radiation.
[18:40.240 --> 18:44.800]  Of course they take your baby's blood as part of a secret UN program and it's now all over
[18:44.800 --> 18:46.800]  the news admitted.
[18:46.800 --> 18:52.600]  Of course it's all real.
[18:52.600 --> 18:54.480]  They think you're stupid.
[18:54.480 --> 18:59.160]  They think they can get away with bloody murder here.
[18:59.160 --> 19:04.720]  They think they can get away with taking people's insurance policies when they die now, mainly
[19:04.720 --> 19:06.840]  the troops.
[19:06.840 --> 19:10.680]  Somebody in the army or the Marines gets their head blown off.
[19:10.680 --> 19:18.000]  Almost got two little kids at home, daddy ain't coming home except in a pine box with
[19:18.000 --> 19:27.160]  his ribbons pinned upon his chest, tell his mom he done his best.
[19:27.160 --> 19:28.160]  What does the insurance companies do?
[19:28.160 --> 19:30.800]  We're just going to keep your money.
[19:30.800 --> 19:31.800]  We run all the regulators.
[19:31.800 --> 19:37.840]  I want to come back, go to your phone, call Sarah, Chris, Frank, Mike, Damon, and I'm
[19:37.840 --> 19:39.320]  going to take a lot of your calls.

[21:02.200 --> 21:07.760]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[21:07.760 --> 21:14.560]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and
[21:14.560 --> 21:20.040]  a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.

[38:41.680 --> 39:09.680]  Tax-free.
[39:09.680 --> 39:34.680]  Just as humans took one major species of wolf, one major species of canine, and created through breeding the dog, a new subspecies.
[39:34.680 --> 39:58.680]  The elite have come in and engineered us, and you look at the British, you look at the Japanese, intelligent, warlike, dynamic people turned into imperial slaves to be quiet, to be subservient, to be caste-driven, to bow down to the government.
[39:58.680 --> 40:11.680]  The elite openly in all their publications talk about the two-tier system, and now they're moving with drugs in the water, with social conditioning to make us even more subservient.
[40:11.680 --> 40:17.680]  Wolves befriended humanity, and humanity created dogs.
[40:17.680 --> 40:25.680]  Now a subgroup of social engineers that have developed in every human society have created the slave system.
[40:25.680 --> 40:28.680]  I said I'm taking call after call, and I'm not doing that.
[40:28.680 --> 40:32.680]  I'm going to try now to finish up your points, Chris, in Texas.
[40:32.680 --> 40:33.680]  Yeah, you there?
[40:33.680 --> 40:34.680]  Yes, sir.
[40:34.680 --> 40:55.680]  Okay, even stranger than that invasion of the body snatchers tale with the Princeton kit is the one that went to MIT, and who's now working on White Sands, New Mexico, who's had the CIA come and interview his family, and even asking his sister how many songs she's downloaded.
[40:55.680 --> 41:04.680]  Click, and that bothers me, Alex, as you get the best and the brightest of us, and they indoctrinate them into this globalist system.
[41:04.680 --> 41:11.680]  They can become part of the click, and I think they lose sight of purpose.
[41:11.680 --> 41:26.680]  Well, you heard Dr. Blalock, if you were listening two days ago, he said he was approached because, you know, he was top of the class in medical school with Eugenics, with World Government, and he said most of his fellow students went along with it.
[41:26.680 --> 41:30.680]  My father was approached and was horrified by it.
[41:30.680 --> 41:39.680]  But, you know, for everybody that says no, they find 10 people that say yes, yes, yes.
[41:39.680 --> 41:42.680]  Alex, you do a great job, man, and I just want you to keep up the good work.
[41:42.680 --> 41:44.680]  We're doing what we can on our end.
[41:44.680 --> 41:50.680]  God bless you, Chris, and interesting story you told us there, very informative.
[41:50.680 --> 41:53.680]  Frank in North Carolina, you're on the air, Frank.
[41:53.680 --> 41:55.680]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[41:55.680 --> 41:59.680]  Reformed Imperial Stormtrooper once again.
[41:59.680 --> 42:03.680]  You shouldn't take my call, but I appreciate that you do.
[42:03.680 --> 42:09.680]  Are you kidding?
[42:09.680 --> 42:19.680]  That motivates me to hear, you know, law enforcement, especially active law enforcement and Marines, Army, any kind of military call in that are awake.
[42:19.680 --> 42:24.680]  What I called in about, I was trying to get in a week or two ago.
[42:24.680 --> 42:32.680]  You're talking about Rush Limbaugh, and I hate to even bring that guy up, but I just wanted to make the point that I called you back in January of 2009.
[42:32.680 --> 42:43.680]  To let you know that Rush Limbaugh had gone off on a ramp during the first hour of the show back in January of 2009, and it sounded like you.
[42:43.680 --> 42:46.680]  And at first I thought he was joking, but he was serious.
[42:46.680 --> 42:51.680]  I think I called in and told you this once before, but you may have forgotten about it.
[42:51.680 --> 42:58.680]  He was talking about the New World Order, CFR, he said that the economy, he actually went into a good bit of detail about it.
[42:58.680 --> 43:06.680]  He said that the economy was being destroyed incrementally by design so that they could bring in this New World Order and everything.
[43:06.680 --> 43:21.680]  No, no, no. Two Fridays ago, and I read the transcript here on air, he came out and said there is a blue blood, robber baron elite in New York and D.C. that hates the middle class, and they plan to rob everyone, including the new rich, like himself.
[43:21.680 --> 43:39.680]  And see, Limbaugh is finally figuring out, and so is Mancow and so many others, that they're going to have to leave and that there's nowhere to run in the world, and that they're targeted as well, and that signing on to this and playing along with the left-right paradigm isn't going to work.
[43:39.680 --> 43:47.680]  And he said the Republican Party, just as bad as the Democrats, are globalist elitists who want world government and want to enslave everyone.
[43:47.680 --> 43:56.680]  And I was driving down the road with my mouth hanging open, got here for the Sunday shows, because I was listening on Sunday to a rebroadcast on a local station, it was W-O-A-I.
[43:56.680 --> 44:04.680]  I was coming in to do my show at Austin, that's on 5.90 a.m., and I just literally couldn't believe what I was hearing.
[44:04.680 --> 44:18.680]  And Michael Savage, in the last three years, has really come out and gotten a lot more hardcore, and admits that Wall Street is swindling everyone, and that Goldman Sachs is criminal, and the Federal Reserve is private, and the government stages terror attacks.
[44:18.680 --> 44:32.680]  Because here's the deal, to Limbaugh and to Savage and to others, the New World Order, if they get this in place, they've stated that once they've got everybody bankrupt under government control,
[44:32.680 --> 44:41.680]  they're not just going to slowly sterilize people and put cancer viruses in the vaccines that kill you 10 years later, and life expectancy starts dropping.
[44:41.680 --> 44:53.680]  They plan to just start wiping everybody out in mass plagues, and they've got bio weapons that kill 99% or more of the mammals they come in contact with, and they admit this.
[44:53.680 --> 45:06.680]  And so, more and more, you have kind of the good old boy power structure in the U.S. who isn't really part of the New World Order structure, but went along with it, because they got patted on the head.
[45:06.680 --> 45:16.680]  A lot of these guys, like Limbaugh admits, CIA officer William F. Buckley kind of brought him along, helped him meet Roger Ailes, helped push him.
[45:16.680 --> 45:23.680]  But see, now these guys are realizing that when they were young and sold out, they weren't given the full story.
[45:23.680 --> 45:32.680]  But now because of this radio show, and because the globalists are so open now about their master plan, a lot of people who are intelligent and now are worth billions of dollars,
[45:32.680 --> 45:41.680]  I mean, Limbaugh is worth well over a billion dollars, they're realizing, my God, this New World Order is a psychopathic group of mass killers.
[45:41.680 --> 45:46.680]  And Limbaugh understands that he's not safe and nobody else is.
[45:46.680 --> 45:53.680]  Look, these people aren't playing games. I mean, this is total global domination of the individual.
[45:53.680 --> 46:00.680]  The nations have already basically been taken over, but I do remember your call. Anything else, Frank?
[46:00.680 --> 46:06.680]  Yeah, as far as Michael Savage goes, I was listening to him back before I'd ever heard of you.
[46:06.680 --> 46:13.680]  And I woke up from the false left paradigm, mainly because of you.
[46:13.680 --> 46:19.680]  Back in 2005, but up until that point, I was listening to Michael Savage, and Michael Savage did the exact same thing.
[46:19.680 --> 46:25.680]  But this is back in 2005, he went on a rant talking about the council on foreign relations, the New World Order.
[46:25.680 --> 46:31.680]  Now, he was not yet getting into the part about the incremental destruction of the economy because we weren't quite there yet.
[46:31.680 --> 46:37.680]  But he was talking about all that. He did a rant, and just like Russell Limbaugh, they didn't take any calls on it.
[46:37.680 --> 46:41.680]  No callers ever called in, so I'm wondering if those calls were screened out or what.
[46:41.680 --> 46:45.680]  But he never mentioned it. Again, neither one of them, because I listened for a while.
[46:45.680 --> 46:53.680]  Well, you know why they do not mention it, but you know why they do it? It's conscience, and they should do it every day, and so what if they get fired?
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.680]  They'll just go somewhere else and be even bigger. I mean, look, you have to make a decision.
[46:57.680 --> 47:11.680]  Do we really want to be with a scientific dictatorship that baves you in radiation with naked body scanners at courthouses, at highway checkpoints and airports, that lies to us and saves the images, that admittedly puts poison in the water?
[47:11.680 --> 47:20.680]  Just because a bunch of pencil-necked control freaks on national public radio make fun of you when you talk about fluoride being a poison, it doesn't matter.
[47:20.680 --> 47:28.680]  Thousands of EPA scientists signed letters and went to Congress and said this is brain-damaging people and causing cancer.
[47:28.680 --> 47:34.680]  So what if some pencil-neck at Wired Magazine, who's a Rhodes Scholar, calls us nuts?
[47:34.680 --> 47:42.680]  We've got the scientific facts. Since when can some pencil-neck tell us what we can and can't talk about? God bless you, Frank. I appreciate the call.
[47:42.680 --> 47:49.680]  I mean, I'm going to tell Savage and Limbaugh something. You better go all the way. You don't want to wish later that you'd have done more.
[47:49.680 --> 47:55.680]  Okay? You know this stuff's all true. Those guys are both very intelligent. They know full well what's going on.
[47:55.680 --> 48:07.680]  Those guys knew what was going on probably when I was in diapers. Okay? I'm 36 years old. Savage is 60-something. What's Limbaugh? 50-something? They know full well what's going on.
[48:07.680 --> 48:15.680]  Okay? You can't make a deal with the devil and come out on top. What would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
[48:15.680 --> 48:21.680]  What would it profit a man to gain the whole world for a little while and be destroyed in the process?
[48:21.680 --> 48:30.680]  You cannot reason with these globalists, okay? They are scientific, cold-blooded killers who want full-spectrum dominance.
[48:30.680 --> 48:39.680]  What's the ultimate form of dominance? Killing your enemy? Wiping out your opposition completely?
[48:39.680 --> 48:48.680]  Our government funded Mao Zedong. That's now declassified. Our government now declassified. And even Brzezinski's written two books bragging about it, totally funded Pol Pot.
[48:48.680 --> 48:57.680]  He killed 30% of the population of his country. The ultra-rich are going to sit offshore. They're going to implode the economy.
[48:57.680 --> 49:04.680]  And they're going to use the dumbed-down poor mass of people as a weapon to rob anybody who makes more than $20,000 a year.
[49:04.680 --> 49:13.680]  When they're done, they'll be nothing left. Everything will be in the hands of the globalists. They want you and your lifestyle to be over.
[49:13.680 --> 49:16.680]  Let's talk to Mike in California. Mike here on the air.
[49:16.680 --> 49:18.680]  Alex, can you hear me pretty clear?
[49:18.680 --> 49:19.680]  Yes, sir.
[49:19.680 --> 49:22.680]  You have four-quick questions. Can I ask you the four-quick questions?
[49:22.680 --> 49:26.680]  Off the air, do you need me to stay on the air so you can remember them?
[49:26.680 --> 49:29.680]  No, no. Go ahead and ask me the questions.
[49:29.680 --> 49:36.680]  What is in relation to the Iran situation and the immediate impact it would have on our lifestyle?
[49:36.680 --> 49:45.680]  So the first question is, how long will it take to affect our lifestyle in relation to the cost of food, gas, utilities, and so on and so forth?
[49:45.680 --> 49:46.680]  That's the first question.
[49:46.680 --> 49:53.680]  It'll be instantaneous. Oil prices will conservatively double the day the attack takes place.
[49:53.680 --> 50:01.680]  The second question is, could you go into detail of this plan? I heard you mentioned this about a couple of weeks ago.
[50:01.680 --> 50:10.680]  We're in the elite. We'll go underground while chaos exists above, while they will create some chaotic situation above ground while they live.
[50:10.680 --> 50:16.680]  That's the moon raker scenario. They're not going to go off-planet. They're going to go underground. They've admitted that.
[50:16.680 --> 50:23.680]  That's an important thing. So the underground plague centers, okay?
[50:23.680 --> 50:26.680]  Do they really exist?
[50:26.680 --> 50:35.680]  Of course. The United States has spent more than all other nations combined on underground cities and continuity of government.
[50:35.680 --> 50:37.680]  What was your other question?
[50:37.680 --> 50:52.680]  As far as an invasion is concerned, I mean, our armed revolt, when do you envision what triggers an armed revolt from the population of the people?
[50:52.680 --> 50:57.680]  You know what? Your phone's cut down. I'm going to come back and try to get your other two questions quickly and then answer them quickly.
[50:57.680 --> 50:59.680]  We'll be right back.
[50:59.680 --> 51:12.680]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration. As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.

[52:30.680 --> 52:44.680]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.

[53:00.680 --> 53:18.680]  Remain in your houses. The president of the United States has declared martial law under executive order 11,004. Will they do it? Will they pull the trigger this time? We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[53:18.680 --> 53:40.680]  Think it can happen here? Executive order 10,990 locks down all highways. Executive order 10,995 ceases control of all media outlets. Executive order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies. All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded and waiting for the right crisis.

[53:54.680 --> 54:16.680]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[54:16.680 --> 54:26.680]  All right, quickly going back to Mike in North Carolina. I've got your first two questions quickly. What were the other two?
[54:26.680 --> 54:36.680]  The other two is, do you envision a armed revolt? And what do you think some of the trigger points would be to trigger something like that? You know, from the people and all that they're, I guess, enduring from the government.
[54:36.680 --> 54:47.680]  These are important questions. And what was the last one? Would you ever consider doing a movie on any of these three questions that I asked you about?
[54:47.680 --> 55:03.680]  Okay, I appreciate your call. Let me try to answer them quickly and succinctly. The different breakdowns that the Pentagon has even put out publicly and that think tanks and others have reported on dealing with Iran run from bad to worse.
[55:03.680 --> 55:13.680]  Iran will block the Strait of Hormuz. They can successfully do it for at least a month, most analysts believe. That will cause roughly a doubling in oil prices.
[55:13.680 --> 55:33.680]  If it continues, they talk about it not being 350 a gallon, but 7, 8, 9, 10 a gallon. Iran will also activate their Shiite militias with El Sardar and others inside Iraq. That will disrupt oil and further drive up prices.
[55:33.680 --> 55:43.680]  Iran will probably launch military operations against Israel. That will escalate the war and they'll probably activate sleeper cells in the United States.
[55:43.680 --> 55:53.680]  If they don't, and Lord knows they've got them, Western intelligence will and say that they did it as a pretext for a domestic crackdown.
[55:53.680 --> 56:04.680]  Anything the globalists do is a multifaceted attack profile where they're going to go after the countries they want to target, but also domestic groups they want to suppress.
[56:04.680 --> 56:08.680]  Remember, in all the main manuals for the police and military, they're trained to take on gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[56:08.680 --> 56:16.680]  And the average conservatives like kill them Arabs, kill them Muslims, not knowing the whole thing's pointed at them. That's the genius of full spectrum dominance.
[56:16.680 --> 56:23.680]  On the issue of underground bases, it's been admitted since the 50s that they've built giant underground bases all over the country.
[56:23.680 --> 56:31.680]  They admittedly have a lot of these and they have underground tunneling devices that have been declassified partially that have connected these by railways.
[56:31.680 --> 56:41.680]  There's a railway underneath Robert Mueller Airport that goes out to Fort Hood, another one that hooks out to Berkstrom International Airport right here where I live.
[56:41.680 --> 56:47.680]  The only reason I know is my grandfather and grandmother lived here in Austin.
[56:47.680 --> 56:54.680]  And I know a lot of people that were out there at the base when it was a sack base strategic air command with nukes.
[56:54.680 --> 57:01.680]  And it's also admitted you can pull up mainstream news about the Briar Green Hotel.
[57:01.680 --> 57:05.680]  Well, there's several. There's a hotel in Virginia and also one in Maryland.
[57:05.680 --> 57:12.680]  And it's an admitted shutdown hotel where in the bottom there's a giant nuke blast door and an underground railway.
[57:12.680 --> 57:16.680]  Now that's classified, but they admit the railways there.
[57:16.680 --> 57:21.680]  And so our government has a bigger defense budget than all other defense budgets combined.
[57:21.680 --> 57:27.680]  And they've had the biggest black budget, much of it spent in the continuity of government.
[57:27.680 --> 57:34.680]  And continuity of government has been the cover to take over the legitimate government and the National Security Act of 47.
[57:34.680 --> 57:46.680]  And so much of the details of Mount Weather and site are and other bases across the country,
[57:46.680 --> 57:49.680]  not just in Maryland and Virginia, but also in Colorado.
[57:49.680 --> 57:52.680]  That's where Northcom is based in Colorado Springs.
[57:52.680 --> 58:02.680]  They've got giant admitted underground bases there that then hook into railways that go all over the country.
[58:02.680 --> 58:07.680]  I'll just say I know some people that work out at Berkstrom and most people don't know this,
[58:07.680 --> 58:14.680]  but they are aware of the heavy blast doors that are concealed down beneath the National Guard base over there.
[58:14.680 --> 58:19.680]  It's just everywhere. That's why Bush chose Crawford.
[58:19.680 --> 58:26.680]  Because the word is that there is an admitted underground base with nukes under the mountains, the hills at Fort Hood.
[58:26.680 --> 58:33.680]  The underground rail spur goes right underneath this Crawford Ranch, so they chose that location.
[58:33.680 --> 58:59.680]  And of course they'll wall it off now that they've sold it. There's a railway right underneath this house. We'll be right back.

[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:21.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:28.680]  Okay, a lot of vital news coming up. I'm going to blast through at the bottom of the hour, but right now we're continuing with your phone calls.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:34.680]  A caller from California asked me four questions. I just went over two of them.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:39.680]  But dealing with the underground bases, they admittedly have these all over the country.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:47.680]  But the extent of how massive they are and how they're interconnected is highly classified.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.680]  But a lot of it has come out in pieces here and there.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:57.680]  And under the eugenics model, the globalists can release a mass plague that would wipe out the majority of the population.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.680]  And then the ruling class would then emerge from the bunkers.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.680]  And they also, of course, would have the antidotes to the plague that they've released.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:16.680]  And Ian Fleming, of course, was a member of British Intelligence, MI6, a spy master.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.680]  He wrote the James Bond books.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:27.680]  And much of what you see in those books that they made into films deals with real scenarios that have been discussed.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:33.680]  But to make it more science fictiony in the movie Moonraker, this elite industrialist who's a eugenicist,
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:40.680]  wants to kill everybody and only have prime genetic specimens go back to Earth to save the ecology of the planet,
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.680]  they go off world before they release a biological agent to kill everybody.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:49.680]  But that is not the plan. It is underground bases.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:54.680]  And this is a serious program being discussed by the globalists,
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:00.680]  and they're romanticizing with all these different movies and TV shows about life after humans and how great it's going to be.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.680]  And most of the top transhumanist and futurist write about this.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.680]  And a lot of your major computer company and technology company owners write about how, like Bill Joy,
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:15.680]  I talk a lot about in Wired Magazine, who went to an elite meeting and met with 200-plus IT owners.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:25.680]  And they said, do we kill everybody or do we just entertain the public?
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.680]  I mean, because the future doesn't even need us.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.680]  Now, you asked about armed revolt.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:38.680]  If you look at the Gang-Counter-Gang British intelligence model, just use one example of how they use it in Operation Gladio,
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:46.680]  which is now declassified in Europe from the 1950s into the mid-1980s with the Bologna bombing in Italy and other places.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:51.680]  They'll just set off bombings and blame it on political groups they want to go after.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:59.680]  You've got the Kenyan model that was the model of the Gladio NATO option system, Stay Behind Networks,
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:08.680]  where they created national parks and international parks all over Africa as guerrilla bases for groups they fund
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.680]  and then attack the indigenous populations.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:17.680]  And then when those gangs they fund, this has been declassified in Kenyan history in the 50s and 60s,
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.680]  then British intelligence would come in and counter the gangs they themselves had created,
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.680]  then they would go kill a few patsies and use that as a pretext to crack down.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:32.680]  So I don't want an armed revolt because clearly most of the groups that have been infiltrated and that pushed for this
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.680]  are government run.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:40.680]  Many of them don't even know it as a pretext to have a massive clampdown on the population.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.680]  And then you ask the question of, have I considered making a movie about the subjects that you brought up?
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.680]  Yes, I mean, these themes are in my documentaries.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:53.680]  But I mean, I would have loved to have made a hundred other films the world so complex and so many issues I want to cover.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.680]  It's just doing a radio show, doing other interviews, doing research and then making films.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.680]  I can only make one or two films a year.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:12.680]  And so we talk about it in a radio form, TV form here, but I hope that answers your question.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.680]  But we don't want an armed revolt in this country that's offensive.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:27.680]  You have a sovereign, basic, organic right to defend yourself from people trying to inject you with vaccines containing cancer,
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:34.680]  RNA, cancer viruses, adjuvants, mercury, aluminum.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:40.680]  You have a right to defend yourself from government trying to inject your children with vaccines that make them serve on.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.680]  You have a right to defend yourself against people trying to put poison in your tap water.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:50.680]  And I'm trying to peacefully have the dumbed-down local criminals back off.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:55.680]  But it's a complex issue.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:20.680]  But at the base we have a right to defend ourselves from these murders.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:30.680]  Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.680]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.680]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.

[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:11.680]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:15.680]  It is Friday we are live taking your phone calls.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.680]  Bob Chapman with his weekly visit on the economy and really important news.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.680]  Coming out on that front he'll be joining us.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.680]  Coming up here in about 52 minutes.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.680]  Right now let's talk to Derek in Missouri.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.680]  You're on the air Derek.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.680]  How you doing?
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.680]  I'm doing okay welcome.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:40.680]  I know I called in and I'd like to thank you for bringing up the humanistic needs of every man.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.680]  Growing up through life.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.680]  I think those are important ideas that you share with us and I've learned from them.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:53.680]  Also from Michael Savage's tales through his growing up.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:09:00.680]  I learned through your stories and I greatly appreciate that.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:13.680]  The second thing I'd like to tell you Alex is that the National Guard is placing themselves with FEMA here in Springfield, Missouri.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:19.680]  And I don't know exactly what they're doing.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:32.680]  They're leveraging in diffusion centers for what is known as brigade homeland and they plan to get it up to 400,000 troops domestically who've been battle hardened in Iraq at checkpoints.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.680]  And this is all part of the conversion incrementally to martial law.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:46.680]  We recently had a new police chief from Tulsa swing his way in and it seems to me like maybe I don't know anything about the man.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:53.680]  He could very great, but we're all watching here in Springfield, Missouri as to what's going on.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.680]  Another subject if I could Alex and that's a Patriot family.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:03.680]  I know when I was growing up, I didn't know exactly can the the four white tablets.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.680]  My parents didn't know that that was a bad idea.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:12.680]  But later on we my father later met a woman and her name is Ruth.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.680]  I'd like to say her name.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:17.680]  And she she's probably listening right now.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:30.680]  And she told us about the new world order and as skeptical as we were later on we grew through history and time to better understand that yes is real.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.680]  And we want to better understand how to cope and be better Patriot family.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:49.680]  Now with that, how is it that with a grease style like economics that 30 year olds are now being able to move in back in with their folks because there are no jobs whatsoever.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:56.680]  And it's becoming harder and harder for these Patriot families to get the sustainability in place.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.680]  Can you speak on that and sure.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.680]  Sure.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.680]  And I appreciate your call, Derek.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.680]  I mean, at least you've got a family.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:10.680]  That's what families for look at where the government's had control of groups, black people.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:28.680]  If you go back in the 1950s, more than half of blacks born in this country had a mother and a father and the crime rates were much lower and they had their own communities and businesses and their colleges and we're really upwardly mobile.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:36.680]  Then the so-called great society came in and we have the Rockefeller Foundation documents on it and would pay them money to not have men in the house.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.680]  And now you've got over 90% illegitimacy.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.680]  There's no father.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:50.680]  I mean, it's hard to bring your kids up right when you got a mother and a father there because there's the work and the taxes and the kids to watch and the role models.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:59.680]  And now you see illegitimacy in white communities, Hispanic communities, trending just like what's happened with the black communities in this country.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:10.680]  Now imagine all of these people that don't have a father at home or don't even have a mother and now the CPS comes in and takes them and now they're being raised by the government.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:17.680]  And then they go out of foster care into prison and that smaller and smaller middle class pays for that prison.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:28.680]  And now that young person, whether they be black, white, it doesn't matter, is working in a prison for 25 cents an hour against everybody else in the free market who's outside the prison driving down wages.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.680]  China's driving down the wages.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.680]  And so at least you've got a family.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.680]  At least 30-year-olds who are being laid off or having their pay cut can move back in with their folks.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:41.680]  That's what family's always been for.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:51.680]  You know, you go back 50, 60 years ago, even well-to-do families tend to live on the same piece of property or in the same house because they understood that's all there is in this world is your family.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.680]  It's your tribe. It's your people.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:02.680]  And so many globalist handbooks, so many university publications that we've quoted here call the family a disease, a dinosaur.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:09.680]  It's got to be gotten rid of just like our industry is a dinosaur. We got to have a service economy. It's meant to make you dependent.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.680]  And so you're just going to have to work harder.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.680]  You're going to have to work two, three jobs like our ancestors did.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.680]  I mean, winning is surviving.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:25.680]  People think winning is a big swimming pool and a mansion and a bunch of money and a bunch of sex and a bunch of power.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.680]  That's not winning.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:35.680]  Winning is surviving and the next generation having it better than you did and being stronger and mentally tougher.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.680]  And yes, we're going into something far worse than a Greece collapse. This is just the beginning.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:48.680]  And I wish this wasn't true, but it's going to get really bad before it gets better and it's never going to get better.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:56.680]  You read the Rand Corporation, the Pentagon documents, the 2007 British Ministry of Defense battle perspective.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.680]  And they say the government's main job is suppressing the people that there will be a total societal collapse by 2012.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.680]  This is a year and a half before the 2008 crash. It's all designed.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:10.680]  We've read that report here on air, London Guardian reported on it.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.680]  And they talk about a world government being the answer in how it's a post industrial world.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:21.680]  Their answer to their engineer collapse is a control collapse that we never come out of.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:30.680]  And so if you can just stay independent and keep them from poisoning your water and keep them from injecting you, you know, with the flu shot.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:36.680]  That really does other things to you. If you can keep your mind free, you're winning.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:42.680]  You can live in a ditch, but as long as your mind is free, you are winning.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:52.680]  As long as your soul is free, as long as you're not controlled by the globalist and being programmed by their worldly system in the world, not of it, you're winning.
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.680]  So don't feel bad if you got a broken down car or don't even have a car.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:02.680]  Don't feel bad if you've got to live with your parents or if your parents and your kids have got to move back in with you.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:09.680]  As long as their minds and their souls are right, that's the only thing that has value in this world is blood and guts.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:16.680]  Okay, blood and guts. What do you think our ancestors went through living hell to bring us to this point?
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:22.680]  And now all that milk and honey they generated through freedom is being sucked out of us.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:28.680]  But wealth can be destroyed and then regenerated. But if you destroy liberty, it can't be.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:38.680]  This is full spectrum dominance. This is siege. The individual, the family, the county, the state, the nation is under siege.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:43.680]  They have to destroy the old system to replace it with the new system.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:54.680]  But these vapid, self-serving, arrogant humanoids that we call the general public who are so deep into the control they never get out of it,
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:59.680]  you need to just feel sorry for them, pray for them, but move on and find those that can't understand.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.680]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Babs in Texas. Babs are on the air.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:10.680]  Hi, Alex. I've been listening to you for 15 years and if we save America, it's because of you. Okay?
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.680]  Oh, you're a sweetheart. No, it's because of people like you, Babs.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:23.680]  Well, I'm very blessed. I'm 77. I learned by watching a video in the 60s and 70s of Rockefeller and Cheney,
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.680]  and they were at a secret meeting in the Bilderberg meeting in London, England.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.680]  They didn't know they were being filmed from a hat fan, can you believe?
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.680]  Anyway, I think I told you that story a long time ago.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:42.680]  But we need to ask and want you to invite your audience to run for Congress to get rid of the crooks.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.680]  We've got to change what's happening up there.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:52.680]  And to come on Thursdays where the city participation is allowed at the city council,
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:57.680]  we have to get rid of fluoride in the poisons in our water. The doctors even say so now.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:06.680]  So please invite people to come and stand up and help us, the people who are in the fluoride-free Austin group.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:12.680]  Babs, I do know you personally and you're a well-to-do, intelligent lady, and so is your husband.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:18.680]  But I had forgotten and refreshed my memory. Where did you see this secret film?
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.680]  I mean, because I've never seen it.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.680]  Okay, I'm going to try to get it again. It's from the John Birch people, okay?
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:30.680]  It's very important because a lot of people didn't believe me.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.680]  I've been trying to stop this a long time. People don't always want to believe you.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.680]  Even your relatives, you know? My family doesn't believe me.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:44.680]  Well, if you watch what Robert Welch said 50 years ago, every better that came true.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.680]  I couldn't believe it, yeah. I see it happening.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:59.680]  Now, Dick Cheney and Rockefeller were on a film. They were on a video. My husband and I and our two-year-old moved to California in 1959.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:03.680]  My husband was an architect and we moved to Beverly Hills.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:08.680]  So we thought we'd be able to survive, but we didn't. I had to go to work as just a draftsman.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.680]  I was drawing schematics on the Atlas missile.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:24.680]  To make a long story short, I didn't get everything out that I did.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:31.680]  I learned then I went down to the American opinion bookstore, which is owned by the John Birch people.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:42.680]  And I saw a video that was, I was invited to go to their meetings and whatever. I was quite impressed with them. They're really good people.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:55.680]  Well, I would imagine that a hardcore Birch will know specifically what this video is, but there is the video of Cheney six years ago at a CFR meeting that he didn't know was being taped.
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:02.680]  And he says, you know, I didn't let the public know I was in the CFR, even their president. You better believe I wouldn't let them know and they all laugh at the public.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:08.680]  So there is a similar video to that where he's talking about global government from just six, seven years ago.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:19.680]  It's just a repeat. I'm 77 and Cheney's eight years younger than I am. So it was probably more in the mid-60s when I heard this.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:25.680]  Cheney, his first job was working for the guy that followed Lemnitzer and he was involved in COG planning.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:30.680]  And that's why he's always been so powerful. Even from the time he was a very young man.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:36.680]  So he had a heart attack at 35. I mean, he was already highest level Pentagon, highest level White House.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:48.680]  And he literally formed a lot of this battle plan. But Babs, it's great hearing from you. We've got to go down to the city councils everywhere and say, look, here's the EPA admitting their own toxicologist.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:57.680]  It causes cancer and brain damage. Get it out of my water. Stop assaulting me and my family. And folks, when you bathe in it, it's just as bad as drinking it.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.680]  Babs, good hearing from you.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:06.680]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention. What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:14.680]  A similar audacity called GMO or genetically modified organisms means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:19.680]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild, edible food.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:25.680]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:33.680]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food too.
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:40.680]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved. Our foods are their enemy.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:46.680]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.

[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.680]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S. dollar has been devaluating.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.680]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.680]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.680]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.680]  They've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:25.680]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now,
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:29.680]  your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:33.680]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.680]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.680]  My name is Crystal. I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:16.680]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:20.680]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.680]  What did Crystal do?
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:25.680]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:31.680]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:35.680]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:17.680]  A private group of banks and corporations have taken over the government through continuity of government.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:26.680]  They said we've got to have a secret government that no other area of government can look into in case the Russians nuke us starting in the late 40s.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.680]  And since then, they run most of the narcotics.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.680]  They control the money laundering.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.680]  They have federalized our cities and counties.
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:41.680]  And now they've allowed the same private banks that financed them to fully rob the public.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.680]  We've been completely financially destroyed, but it's been done through fraud.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:50.680]  We have to say no to the fraud and no to the central banks.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:57.680]  And we've been trying to do that with auditing the Fed and with moving to prosecute these people.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:04.680]  And their response is to have Congress pass reform to give them even more power and more secrecy.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:09.680]  But the good news is the public is now aware of who really runs the country.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.680]  Up until a few years ago, they weren't.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:17.680]  This is huge news. We're now identifying the problem.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:20.680]  And that is half the battle.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:23.680]  And by the way, that's not a G.I. Joe quote.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:29.680]  That is a old military term used by the British that knowing your enemy is half the battle.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:34.680]  And it really comes from, of course, the Chinese philosopher, Sung Soo.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.680]  So knowing is half the battle.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.680]  And we know now and the public now knows more and more.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.680]  They can't call us kooks anymore.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.680]  So now we've got a hole in the enemy defenses to carry the ball through.
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:52.680]  And if you're ready to carry the ball, folks, little steps, but keep moving forward, crawling up this hill.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.680]  We don't have a choice. We've got to beat them.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.680]  Let's talk to Stephen in Florida. You're on the air. Welcome.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.680]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.680]  Two quick things I wanted to bring up.
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:08.680]  First of all, a couple of weeks ago, you've heard of Michael Matthead, right?
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.680]  Yeah, he, it's his favorite sport to attack me.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:14.680]  Right, exactly. He's typical neocon. Well, he was talking.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.680]  Well, he's not typical. He's one of the slimyists out there.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.680]  Yeah, he is.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:35.680]  And anyway, he was talking about the polls, the latest polls about the Republican, you know, presidential prospects and saying that, you know, Mitt Romney and, you know, the other people, you know, Palin and, you know, these others are in the front.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:45.680]  So I called in and I said, hey, I said, I'm really offended by this poll and what you're saying because it's obvious the front runner is Ron Paul.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:55.680]  And I went into about how Ron Paul, I said, is more than anybody else except for Alex Jones has awakened more people than anybody else.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:02.680]  So he went into, oh, Alex Jones, you know, and he tried to say about Ron Paul being old and all his kind of stuff and he looks tired.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.680]  But he brought up the Bohemian growth.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:10.680]  And so I proceeded to try and respond to this and saying, well, what's your beef?
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:16.680]  He went in, he, you know, videotaped it, put it out on the Internet.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.680]  I mean, it's obvious and they've admitted this is going on.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.680]  It's all documented. So of course, he was mocking at that point.
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:31.680]  But you know, these people are so stupid like Medved because in doing that, you know, it's like a kid, you tell him, no, and he's going to do it anyway.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:34.680]  And so this idiot, he's putting this out there trying to mock you.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:40.680]  But I'll guarantee you this caused some people to go, huh, I think I'm going to do a search on that and just check it out for myself.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.680]  Well, I expand on that. They always turn it around.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.680]  Like we read the New York Times, Time Magazine, literally countless.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.680]  It's got to be 100 of them the last two weeks.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:55.680]  It's so many, you can't even just search the term lithium in the water in Google News.
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.680]  And it's hundreds of mainstream articles and blogs.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:05.680]  I saw four or five of them yesterday saying how great lithium is.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:15.680]  And then Wired Magazine responded and said I was insane and wrote another article saying that basically I believe aliens are going to come to the earth.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.680]  I've never talked about aliens. I've never said a mothership is coming to get us.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:28.680]  But they say I'm lying about the media proposing lithium in the water and I basically believe space aliens are going to land.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:37.680]  And almost every comment of literally hundreds in those articles said you're, you know, you're the one that's crazy.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.680]  Here's the news articles calling for lithium.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.680]  Alex isn't saying space aliens are about to arrive and destroy the earth.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:51.680]  Alex doesn't talk about space aliens and then he countered saying you're delusional. You're all just his supporters.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:52.680]  You're lying too.
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.680]  So this is what they do.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.680]  I sneak into Bohemian Grove.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.680]  I'm there for one evening, five hours.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.680]  They do this weird ritual.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:09.680]  I was there and saw the photos in their camp houses of men dressed as women.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:16.680]  It's in mainstream news reports like the New York Post that they fly in gay porn stars and each leader has his own gay porn star to service him.
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.680]  And it's Republican leaders and they're having gay orgies.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:27.680]  Now, I'm not here bashing gay people, but the point is, is that you've got the Republican leadership being compromised and Nixon talked about it.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:35.680]  He said, well, I was running for governor and I had to go and it's the most GD, faggy thing you've ever seen to use his quote.
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.680]  And this is how they compromise them.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:45.680]  And the Republicans all go in there and have sex with gay porn stars and then they go, okay, you've now been compromised.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.680]  We can promote you.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.680]  It's just like Obama.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.680]  I mean, come on.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.680]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:53.680]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:59.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:03.680]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.680]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:09.680]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.680]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:17.680]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:23.680]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:29.680]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:33.680]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:37.680]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:43.680]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:47.680]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.680]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.680]  It's here.

[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:43.680]  I mean, to be specific here, I think that the whole gay lifestyle is very, very destructive.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:51.680]  They have the highest level of suicide, the highest level of partner violence, the highest level of disease.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:59.680]  I'm not somebody who sits up here and judges people or hates them, but I do care about people.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.680]  And I also, now that I'm older, realize how dangerous promiscuity is.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:10.680]  I mean, I think that is just as bad. I think, you know, you could sit around and joke about it.
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:14.680]  And I was joking about it with a man cow the other day, the talk show host, when he said,
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.680]  most men don't seem like they're aggressively attracted to women.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:21.680]  I was just uncontrollably attracted to women. And I still am.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:27.680]  But, I mean, I guess I'm married and love my wife and, you know, have psychologically grown.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:34.680]  But I'm not here judging people that just want to run around fornicating, except for the fact that it's destructive and dangerous.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:41.680]  And it results in abortions and, you know, results in health problems. Thank God, I never had any problems.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:49.680]  But if I, you know, I mean, if I could be a teenager again and look back on it, you know, I'm not proud of the things I did.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.680]  And of course, I was just part of the course growing up in Dallas, Texas, and then Austin.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:59.680]  I went to high school part of the time in a suburb of Dallas and then here in Austin.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:07.680]  And I mean, it was just, you know, I mean, the women were ready to go and I was ready to go as well.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:13.680]  My issue, though, about the homosexuality at Bohemian Grove, this was in Harper's magazine.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:17.680]  They interviewed Nixon back in the 70s when he was president.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:22.680]  And he talked about Bohemian Grove and how he had to go there for political power when he was running for governor.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:27.680]  His unsuccessful bid. He'd been a senator, of course, hooked in with Prescott Bush.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:31.680]  And he called it the most GD, faggy thing you can imagine.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:39.680]  And then after he died, they actually Harper's did another article. People didn't believe it and release the audio tape of the taped interview with the reporter.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:44.680]  I mean, he let him tape it so you can just search Nixon.
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:49.680]  I'm not going to play it on air because it has profanity in it. Nixon used a lot of profanity.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:36:00.680]  But you can search Richard Nixon talks about Bohemian Grove and at Bohemian Grove, just while I was there,
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:10.680]  there were, you know, it was a big photo of Henry Kissinger bent over with his butt sticking out, wearing women's panties,
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.680]  simulating, I don't even want to say it with children listening.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:21.680]  And by the way, I was sworn to secrecy at the time.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.680]  I was sworn to secrecy and wearing my journalist hat.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.680]  I always, unless it's something completely illegal,
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.680]  I follow my journalistic integrity.
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:35.680]  If somebody came to me and said, as a journalist, I'm going to tell you a secret, okay, tell me the secret.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:41.680]  Oh, I murdered somebody. I mean, I would be forced to call the police.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:44.680]  You know, one time we had a fellow show up and say they're investigating me.
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:52.680]  They think I firebombed the governor's mansion and he tried to give me this big box of material or my crew.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:58.680]  And I thought it could be a setup to set me up for the firebombing.
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:01.680]  And so, but plus, I just had to call.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:08.680]  I mean, I called the state police and they came out and because I had to.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:12.680]  But short of that, I will never break, you know, the journalist code.
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:17.680]  And it is the journalist code that if something's illegal, you've got to talk about it.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:25.680]  But John Ronson snuck in as well and it had me swear for liability issues and never say that he went in.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:32.680]  And then a year later, he publishes a book saying he snuck in there with me and he writes about Kissinger, if you want to read it.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.680]  So it's not just me that saw this.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:42.680]  Kissinger with a bunch of other world leaders dressed as women bent over simulating inserting fingers in their rectums.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:43.680]  Okay, I'll just leave it at that.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:52.680]  I mean, I mean, the ladies and gentlemen, I was trying to hide out and stay away from people and being questioned by Secret Service with Mike Hansen, who also snuck in with me.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:57.680]  And Ronson saw me get in successfully and decided he was going to sneak in the same way that show.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:02.680]  So I didn't even know he was going to sneak in until I later saw him walking down one of the forest paths and didn't say anything.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:08.680]  But the point is, Ronson backs up what I saw.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:16.680]  And then later widows, it's happened in two cases, sent me internal annals, 10 year annals.
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:21.680]  And it's Bush senior and junior speaking.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:24.680]  And the media never said, don't call W Jr.
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:30.680]  But he's called junior in those books and they dress in drag.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:44.680]  It's admitted in spy magazine, people magazine, CBS News that limos just drive in all day long and jets land from New York and LA with the gay prostitutes.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:48.680]  And I didn't understand because in 2000, I was a lot better looking than I am now.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:50.680]  It's about 30 pounds lighter than I am now.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:57.680]  And people seen the videos of him being, you know, I see women commenting on YouTube and he's handsome.
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.680]  And I was pretty handsome then and Mike was a handsome guy.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:06.680]  And I didn't really hadn't done my research properly on Bohemian Grove and I'd heard that there was a lot of homosexuality in there.
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:09.680]  But you've got to be there to believe it.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:17.680]  And I had old men whistling at me and coming at me and I had groundskeepers laughing at us and whistling at us.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:26.680]  And I literally probably only walked around for an hour or the five hours because I was questioned by Secret Service by Sonoma County Sheriff's deputies.
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:33.680]  Luckily with a straight face, I knew enough about the camps to say I'm a member of the Hillbillies, knowing that was a Texas camp.
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:38.680]  They have over 100 camps within the 2,700 acres, you know, log cabins.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:50.680]  And so, I mean, and then it got dark and they reportedly at this pool, this little lake have this idol and there was the idol.
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:57.680]  And I know that Moloch was a bull in Sumeria, but occultists always mix and match.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:09.680]  They addressed it as Moloch in their literature as Moloch during the ritual and as Lilith, which is the owl god, or sometimes represented by an owl.
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:16.680]  And they went through this incantation of conjuring the dead Bohemian Grove members that had been there.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:29.680]  And I was with those old men on the beach looking across the 50, 60 yards at the owl and they were grinding their teeth and in reverent rapture.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:32.680]  And Mike Hansen sitting beside me.
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.680]  You can even hear this on the audio of you boosted up as we were trying to shoot video.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:44.680]  This was a little hidden camera on my side trying to halfway climb up the knots on a tree to get above the people's heads because the camera was hidden at my side.
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:49.680]  It's in the film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, by the way.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.680]  And then I went back to Bohemian Grove and covered it and a few years later.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:58.680]  And so there's two films in one on the DVD titled Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:06.680]  That's an hour and a half film in the 46 minute documentary, again, both films on one DVD, The Order of Death.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:14.680]  And Mike was like, oh, that's interesting. And they would just look at him with hatred, even though he was whispering, oh, that's nice.
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:20.680]  You know, like he was in a crowd of people know they were taking this like he was talking in church.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:26.680]  And then you have the New York Post and the rest of it.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:41.680]  Reporting that headline Chad Savage, gay porn star services moguls, that was the headline and so many other headlines in that spy magazine piece.
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:44.680]  And we have video shots of that in the films.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.680]  Another reporter who successfully snuck in but then got caught.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.680]  He was still able to write about it.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:54.680]  He just was unable to get any photos.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:03.680]  He just described being hit on and I mean, and so my my point is when you see the Republican leadership.
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:13.680]  If they've been to Bohemian Grove, they are sent there to be compromised and it just shows you how everything you're told is not what reality really is.
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:20.680]  Just like they tell you, we promise you these body scanners do not have any radiation and cannot hurt you.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:24.680]  And we promise you they cannot even be saved.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:31.680]  And then it turns out they're saving everything at the state courthouses at the federal courthouses that have them at the airports.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:33.680]  It's now completely admitted.
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:46.680]  They lied to you openly from the beginning because they're all confident and the Democrats have their weird Bohemian Grove with Maury strong in Colorado.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:51.680]  And reportedly similar things go on there, but women are involved as well.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:59.680]  Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor before Helmut Cole, he wrote the book Men and Powers of Political Retrospective.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.680]  We own the book.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.680]  I did shots of the text.
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:08.680]  I underlined it in the film and he says we do our own rituals at our own juridic grove.
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:13.680]  Remember Jesus said, you know, don't go to the groves, cut down the groves where they do these rituals.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.680]  People say Jesus was for cutting down trees.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:20.680]  No, he meant in their holy groves where they do the sacrifices.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.680]  Now that's in the Bible.
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:28.680]  It's the same stuff going on 2000 years ago or 2010 years ago is going on now.
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:33.680]  And Schmidt says, oh, Bilderberg group, trilateral commission, we run the planet, one world government.
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:34.680]  It's so wonderful.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:44.680]  I mean, he wrote this and he says we have our own groves to do rituals, but my favorite place to do rituals is Bohemian Grove and I travel every year.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:52.680]  And he says more decisions get made there than even the trilateral commission or Bilderberg group.
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:58.680]  The real decisions get made there while they're on drugs and drinking and some of the men like women.
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:00.680]  But it's it's men only.
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:03.680]  So they drive into Monterey, oh, it's got four or five hotels.
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.680]  And when you're there during that season, they're just hookers everywhere.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:17.680]  You know, when you're outside the Grove, there are just beautiful, you know, number 10 hookers, females just just just and they go to the local golf course to be picked up.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:24.680]  So the Grove members drive over there and they want a female and they also pick up the males and drive them in with them.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:30.680]  And this is who your leadership is.
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:44.680]  Most of these Republican leaders you see up on television that go to Bohemian Grove, go to a forest retreat, dress up like women, do bizarre black magic rituals and have sex with gay porn stars and gay prostitutes.
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.680]  I mean, that's a fact.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.680]  Richard Nixon talked about it.
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:49.680]  Okay.
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:55.680]  I mean, nothing you've been told is true.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:00.680]  And the caller brought this up and I've now gone into a 10 minute rant about it or five minute rant, whatever it is.
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.680]  Let's be technical.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.680]  Nine minute rant.
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:07.680]  Seven minute rant.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:08.680]  Three is the charm.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:09.680]  I only got to write seven minute rant.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:12.680]  I've done the seven minute rant on this subject.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:19.680]  And I mean, I don't blame people not believing it.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:29.680]  The, you know, the British journalist said, I can't go in there because World of Wonder and Channel 4 England won't allow me to because of liability.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:30.680]  It's real.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:31.680]  I've got people inside.
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:33.680]  They do do this ritual.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.680]  There's all sorts of gay stuff going on.
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:41.680]  I will pay you your expenses and I'll also videotape you doing it.
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:45.680]  He said, I know you've infiltrated military operations and things like that.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.680]  This should be a piece of cake for you.
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:51.680]  And I said, sure, sure, I'll do it, but I don't believe that stuff.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:57.680]  I mean, just 11 years ago, this happened 10, but he talked to me about six months before we did it.
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:02.680]  He was covering some of the things we were doing up at Waco building a memorial chapel up there, John Ronson.
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:07.680]  He also wrote men who stare at goats turned into the big movie that you've seen about General Stubblebine.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:16.680]  That's really a whitewash, but his book them covers the Bohemian Grove fiasco or escapade.
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:21.680]  And I don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:27.680]  It's just you go in there and you see this and you got old men trying to pick you up.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:34.680]  And it was literally like I was the cat and they were peppy lapieu the skunk in that Warner Brothers cartoon.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.680]  I mean, it was just, oh, thank you.
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:37.680]  Oh, yes.
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:38.680]  Oh, I'm handsome.
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:39.680]  Well, thank you.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:44.680]  Have a nice day with drunk old men going, you know, corporate CEOs and people.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:52.680]  I mean, it's, it's, it's gross.
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:47:00.680]  And again, meanwhile, I'm being chased like peppy lapieu through there along with Mike Hansen.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.680]  John Ronson's not very handsome.
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:06.680]  He didn't have any problems.
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:11.680]  Of course, according to him, but I'm just joking, John.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.680]  You're, you're, you're just who could make this?
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:23.680]  Who could make up that they're in the news every day saying we want to only let you have one child and we are putting drugs in your water to make you submit to us.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:26.680]  And we want to give you vaccines to make you submit.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:37.680]  I mean, who could make up that every major insurance company is brazenly telling Bloomberg, well, we've changed the rules and we're allowed to keep your insurance money when your husband gets killed in Iraq.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.680]  So we're just going to do it.
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:44.680]  We're recording your naked bodies and we lied to you about it.
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:48.680]  I mean, look, I'm not the one doing all this crazy stuff.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:52.680]  I know it sounds crazy because I'm the one talking about it, but it's all real.
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:58.680]  It's all real.
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:01.680]  And these people are crazy.
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.680]  A normal person wants to go fishing or camping.
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:06.680]  I never get tired of it.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:13.680]  These elitist who have all these mistresses and all this money and all this power and they always get into sick, weird stuff because there's something wrong with them.
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:29.680]  And normal people who just want to never get sick of beef and cheese enchiladas, never get sick of camping or fishing or hunting, never get sick of swimming in a river, never get tired of watching a sunset, never get tired of water skiing,
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:37.680]  never get tired of kissing my wife, never get tired of loving my children, never get tired of visiting my grandmother.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:39.680]  And I'm a weirdo.
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:41.680]  I'm the weirdo because I'm normal.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:48.680]  And the sickos run things and they're turning our society into their wonderland.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:54.680]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls and Bob Chapman's coming up and I will intersperse a ton of news with him today.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:49:04.680]  Because literally I got two days of news here I haven't really gotten to that I want to at least mention here and get Bob and of course the caller's take on it.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:15.680]  But your purchase of videos, books, t-shirts, the materials at infowars.com, it makes this radio broadcast possible.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:19.680]  And we couldn't have done everything we've done without your help and we need your continued support.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.680]  Plus these are films that are the best out there.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:24.680]  You know, the public agrees.
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:28.680]  The Obama deception, fall the republic, end game, fabled enemies.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:36.680]  And we, people, it was very popular in the two and a half weeks that we offered Obama deception, buy one, get three free.
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:39.680]  Or you can buy two, get eight free.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.680]  Buy two, get eight free.
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:49.680]  And now I'm doing that with police state four, the rise of FEMA, the total police state breakdown, and fall of the republic.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:50:02.680]  Such an important film, part two of the Obama deception, covers the whole banking takeover, the new world order, the globalist, Obama heading the United Nations treacherously, how it's high treason.
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:07.680]  Most people that have seen it say it's even more powerful than the Obama deception and I agree with them.
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:10.680]  You can get our three newest and hottest films.
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:12.680]  We're not discounting my old films here.
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:14.680]  Oh, they're discounted too.
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:24.680]  We're discounting the biggest discounts, the newest and most powerful films, because I want you to have the high quality DVD with the expanded extras to be able to give your friends and family.
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:28.680]  So we're going to run this special for at least the next two weeks.

[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.680]  Films can do what weeks of talking to your family can.

[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:24.680]  Finishing up on Bohemian Grove, it is a giant operation to compromise Republican Party officials and corporate chiefs.
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:30.680]  And that just shows you how mafioso this whole system is.
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:34.680]  If we don't have the Bill of Rights and Constitution, we're not protected from these people.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:36.680]  And that's why they want to get rid of it.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:40.680]  They don't want to get rid of it to keep you safe from Muslim terrorists at their funding.
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:44.680]  That they're letting attack us, or in some cases, actually staging the events.
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.680]  I mean, look how many times we've been lied to.
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:48.680]  Look at all the corruption that's come out.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:51.680]  We've got to face how much trouble we're in.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:54.680]  And again, the good news is there is a big awakening happening.
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:58.680]  But it's not fast enough. We've got to do more.
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:00.680]  And we've got to do more now.
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:04.680]  Rob in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:09.680]  The man who infiltrated Bohemian Grove without Kevlar.
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:11.680]  Well, it wasn't that big of a stunt, actually.
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:15.680]  I mean, it shows how these people are not invincible.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:18.680]  In fact, if you just stand up to them, they'll fall.
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:21.680]  Exactly, exactly. I've got two points for you, Alex.
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:29.680]  I tried calling my municipal water filtration plant, and they invaded disclosing what chemicals they're using.
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:33.680]  They totally spun the call and said, basically, what's your name, boy?
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:36.680]  No, no, no. You're a terrorist asking.
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:43.680]  Look, you just call the city council or county commissioners or the select men, whatever you have in your area.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:48.680]  What do they call that local town? Is it a community? Is it a city? What is it?
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:52.680]  Yeah, it would be like the town council or...
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:57.680]  Yeah, so you just call the town council and it's public record. Are you fluoridating?
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.680]  I mean, listen, what's the name of your town?
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:02.680]  I'll search engine it right now. It'll tell you if your city fluoridates.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:10.680]  Absolutely. Prescott, Ontario, Canada. That's with two T's on you and Prescott.
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:16.680]  Fluoridation of water. Keep talking. I'm typing it in.
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:17.680]  No problem.
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:19.680]  So, well, no, I mean...
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:26.680]  Yeah, he was acting exactly like I was trying to get information to do something on my terrace.
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:28.680]  He was looking for some Islamic-wise name.
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:31.680]  Okay, you got people there fighting it.
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:35.680]  Prescott to discuss referendum on fluoridation, latest news from Ontario.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:38.680]  John Wells tells council fluoridation is a nonissue.
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:42.680]  The fluoridation of Prescott's drinking water could become an issue.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:45.680]  Let me click on it and give you the year.
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:47.680]  It looks like they were having a fight recently about it.
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:52.680]  This was seven years ago out of the Brookville Recorder and Times.
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:55.680]  Prescott to discuss referendum on fluoridation.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:59.680]  Need to replace fluoride regulator puts the issue on the table.
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:02.680]  The machine that they used to inject it was broken.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:05.680]  They were looking for money to buy a new one.
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:09.680]  And yes, your water's fluoridated. Found out in T-minus 12 seconds.
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.680]  Okay, I Google how much U.S. foreign aid is going to Israel annually.
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:18.680]  Websites like Procon.org list tens of billions conservatively
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:24.680]  over a table covering military to settlements like bulldozers and stuff like that.
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:30.680]  Yeah, there's about 15 billion that's public and another 20 billion or so they estimate that's camouflage day.
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:32.680]  Excellent. Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:33.680]  Anything else?
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:34.680]  No, you're the best. We're listening.
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.680]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:44.680]  You know, I've been a big critic of Israel and the fact that Israel manipulates U.S. foreign policy.
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:46.680]  And I don't like any country doing that.
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:55.680]  And people take out of context when I say people who then say that I work for Israel are mind controlled idiots.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:01.680]  And then it gets spun that I'm saying anyone who criticizes Israel is a moron or an idiot.
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:06.680]  And that's just how dishonest people are. They just make stuff up.
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:16.680]  I mean, I have been critical of all foreign aid and I'm critical of Israel trying to start a war with Iran.
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:24.680]  But most of these really vehement anti-Israel groups that's come out like Hal Turner are feds.
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:31.680]  They're meant to make criticism of Israel look radical and stupid, so it's unaffected, ineffective.
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:34.680]  But I thought I'd just throw that out there.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:39.680]  All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us. More calls in Bob Chapman straight ahead.
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:48.680]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:53.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:57.680]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:03.680]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:09.680]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:13.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:18.680]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:21.680]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:25.680]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:30.680]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:35.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:39.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:43.680]  That's www.mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:58.680]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:03.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:06.680]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:10.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:15.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:19.680]  Okay, it's hour number three coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:23.680]  I'm going to go over a bunch of key financial issues.
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:28.680]  Like Social Security is in the red this year. Record layoffs.
[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:34.680]  And I'll admit, we never left the recession. We're going into a depression.
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:39.680]  But right now, let's go to Tom in New York. Tom, you're on the air.
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:41.680]  Hey, Alex, what's up?
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:44.680]  Worldwide broadcast, so good to have you here with us.
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:48.680]  All right, great. So, um...
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:53.680]  I've watched your documentaries, and they're really great.
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:58.680]  And honestly, I've been able to start telling people about it,
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:02.680]  and I've gotten my cousin who lives in Colorado into this sort of thing,
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:06.680]  and now she's helping fight for the cause.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:08.680]  Good.
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:15.680]  And one, two things is that I printed out some of your flyers
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:20.680]  from infowars.com, and I started posting them around town.
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:23.680]  And I instructed my cousin in Colorado to do the same,
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:26.680]  so we're really helping to get the word out there.
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:29.680]  Well, Tom, that's awesome. I hope people will get this flyer.
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:34.680]  There is poison in the tap water, and they ask facts about increases in bone cancer
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:37.680]  and other issues. It says, demand safe water, demand the truth.
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:41.680]  Visit infowars.com. The media will attack this,
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:45.680]  in many towns and cities, and then that will cause a larger debate.
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:49.680]  Just like when a fluoride machine breaks in Prescott, Ontario,
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:53.680]  it gives the public a chance to go in and talk about the poison in the water.
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:57.680]  This is a way to put it back on the table and to have a focal point
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:01.680]  and to point out, hey, this is poison. How dare you do this?
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:05.680]  Exactly. And the thing is about getting the word out,
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:08.680]  and especially when it comes to Florida, that people don't really know
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:11.680]  that, like, it's always been presented as a good thing,
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:14.680]  because though it helps fight cavities and stuff like that.
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:17.680]  But so it's kind of a big sort of focus shift, I think,
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:19.680]  but a lot of people are waking up to it.
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:25.680]  And now they're presenting lithium to be put in our water to calm us,
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:27.680]  which is what the fluoride is put in there for.
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:30.680]  It's also toxic and to reduce fertility.
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:34.680]  But I appreciate your calls. Did you have any other points, Tom?
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:38.680]  Yeah, one more thing I want to do is, as far as getting the word out,
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:40.680]  I'm also like, I have this sort of music group going,
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:42.680]  and we're going to release an EP soon.
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:44.680]  It's going to be called Road to Bohemia,
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:46.680]  all about Bohemia and Grove Society and New World Order.
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:47.680]  Awesome.
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:49.680]  All right, thanks a lot, Al.
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:50.680]  Thank you.
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:53.680]  I mean, I remember 10 years ago when I snuck in there and blew it wide open,
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:57.680]  the media ran stories saying I was a liar and hadn't snuck in.
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:00.680]  Then a few years later, they admitted that I had snuck in.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:04.680]  The Bohemian Grove responded to it.
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:09.680]  And then now it's mainstream news that they have giant homosexual orgies there.
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:11.680]  So that's your government.
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:13.680]  I mean, that's who they are.
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:15.680]  Let's talk to Terrence in Florida.
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:17.680]  Terrence, you're on the air.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:18.680]  Hi, Alex.
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:19.680]  Hey, buddy.
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:20.680]  Thanks for taking the call.
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:21.680]  Thanks for calling.
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:26.680]  You said we need to identify the problem.
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:34.680]  And I think one way to do that would be that all of our north was a government employee.
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:38.680]  Child Protective Services are government employees.
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:43.680]  The City Council of Austin, Texas are government employees.
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:47.680]  The problem is not our government, which is the Constitution,
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:49.680]  it's the government employee.
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:53.680]  It's these servers that have stepped outside the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:04:00.680]  So every time you get a chance or every time I go out in public with a weird change,
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.680]  I got to hold up a sign that says government employees are the threat.
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:07.680]  And put a face on the threat.
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:10.680]  Because as long as we say government's doing this, there's no face.
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:13.680]  But if we put a face on the threat, which is the government employee.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:14.680]  That's right.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:17.680]  No, it's mafia that's gone in, overthrown the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:21.680]  overthrown our government, and have put in their own criminal government.
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:24.680]  Rogue government is the problem.
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:25.680]  Sort of.
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:32.680]  But the old lady at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles is demanding you get her permission to drive a car.
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:34.680]  She's a government employee.
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:36.680]  She doesn't know she's a threat.
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:41.680]  But if we tell her the government employee's a threat, they might start looking at themselves and wake up.
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:46.680]  Oh, they're going to wake up when they get their pay cut, their pensions taken, or fired, or all three.
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:54.680]  They're going to wake up real quick, because the taxes are going to go up as they are, and the services are going to be cut off.
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:59.680]  So they're going to have, they're going to, they're waking up right now. Good points, Terrence.

[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:36.680]  It is Friday, the sixth day of August, 2010.
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:42.680]  Websites are prisonplanet.tv, infowars.net, and jonesreport.com.
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:51.680]  Don't forget the network website, a lot of key news as well, GCN, the letters GCN, live.com.
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:58.680]  Okay, let me go ahead and run through some of this news here dealing with the economy.
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:07.680]  Anger mounts over Michelle Obama's 150,000-pound Spanish holiday bill, footed by the U.S. taxpayer.
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:13.680]  I want to talk about how the total security costs are in the millions and millions of dollars.
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:16.680]  In fact, here's a story out of the Newark Daily News.
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:23.680]  Material Girl Michelle Obama is a modern-day Marie Antoinette on a glitzy Spanish vacation.
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:29.680]  This came out two days after Dr. Paul Craig Roberts wrote a headline about it for infowars.com titled,
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:31.680]  Let Them Eat Cake.
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:35.680]  Sacrifices something that many Americans are becoming all too familiar with during this economic downturn.
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:38.680]  It was a key theme in President Obama's inaugural address to the nation.
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:46.680]  And he's referenced it numerous times, austerity for you, lecturing the country on how to get back on its feet.
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:52.680]  But while most of the country is pinching pennies, many top government officials, I would have the state and county level,
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:55.680]  are getting big raises, some of them make hundreds of thousands, up to a million a year.
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:00.680]  But while most of the country is pinching pennies and downsizing, some are sojourns,
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:06.680]  are forging them all together for going them, the Obamas don't seem to be heeding their own advice.
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:15.680]  And it goes on to them occupying 60 to 70 rooms everywhere she travels and spending millions and millions of dollars.
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:19.680]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:25.680]  Now, looking at some of the economic news, they're celebrating what they've done to you.
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:31.680]  They don't care if you hate Obama, he knows he'll be removed as a puppet and then he'll be rehabilitated later,
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:34.680]  just like Bush and Clinton and everybody else.
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:40.680]  America is at risk of boiling over, not of touch, leaders don't see the need to cool things off.
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:43.680]  No, because they want a revolt.
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:48.680]  They're training for urban warfare and civil unrest everywhere.
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:52.680]  That's what they want, but that's a story by Peggy Noonan.
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:11:00.680]  Continuing, Romer to leave the White House, Christina Romer, chairwoman of President Obama's Council on Economic Advisors,
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:06.680]  that's Council of Economic Robbers, has decided to resign according to sources familiar with the plans.
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:08.680]  Mission accomplished.
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:11.680]  Now, time for the Ratch to leave the sinking ship.
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:13.680]  Here's another one, Washington Times.
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:17.680]  Social security is in the red this year.
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:19.680]  It's been in the red for decades.
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:22.680]  All there are receipts in that fund.
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:24.680]  They steal your money, folks.
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:29.680]  Social security will pay out more this year than it gets in payroll taxes, making it the first time,
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:33.680]  since the program will be in the red since it was overhauled in 1983,
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:39.680]  according to the annual authoritative report released Thursday by the program's report.
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:45.680]  Meanwhile, President Obama's healthcare overhaul has given Medicare a basic hospital insurance
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:50.680]  for extra 12 years of financing stability.
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:53.680]  Continuing, U.S. employers shed jobs.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:56.680]  Unemployment rate held steady at 9.5 in July.
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:58.680]  It's well over 20%.
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:03.680]  But this news sent the stock market tumbling today.
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:10.680]  More jobs news, job picture worsens with 131,000 losses in the last month.
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:19.680]  Remember, those are cook numbers. Fox News reports, despite budget cuts, layoff fears, Milwaukee teachers fight for budget-funded Viagra.
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:23.680]  Yes, more goodies for them.
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:29.680]  Meanwhile, libraries all over the country are being closed, like in Camden, closing a major library.
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:31.680]  Let the taxes go up.
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:34.680]  City faces hiring borrow costs.
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:39.680]  City faces higher borrowing costs, as bond rating is downgraded.
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:41.680]  This is out of the sun times.
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:48.680]  Struggling through its worst-ever budget crisis, Chicago has suffered the first in what could be a series of body blows.
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:53.680]  A downgrade in the all-important bond rating that determines city borrowing costs.
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:13:01.680]  The city goes and takes loans out from private banks, central banks, that they just make up out of nothing.
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:09.680]  And now they've gotten them leveraged where they want them, so now they'll have to pay 10%, 15% on their loans, on their bonds.
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:11.680]  And then they won't be able to pay that.
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:18.680]  Then it'll be 30%, 40% like Zimbabwe or Argentina or Nigerian.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:22.680]  And of course, the United States itself has been downgraded in China now.
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:26.680]  Continuing postal service loses 3.5 billion in third quarter.
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:30.680]  Reuters reports, talks about becoming completely insolvent.
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:32.680]  Don't worry, they'll just print more money.
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:43.680]  Fannie Mae seeks 1.5 billion from U.S. Treasury after 12th straight loss for closures at all-time records.
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:46.680]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:49.680]  In an uncertain economy, shoppers are choosy again.
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:54.680]  Consumers are buying a lot less, so profits of retail stores aren't plunging.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:14:03.680]  The real estate market continues to plunge both private individuals, homes, and of course, the commercial real estate market.
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:12.680]  Let's now go to Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster who joins us on the third hour every Friday to break down what's happening in the economy.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:20.680]  Bob, more and more, they say there's no way to get out of the recession that's really a depression.
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:25.680]  Here you are three years ago predicting what happened a year later in October of 2008.
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:33.680]  You predicted that the stimulus would run out by now over a year and a half ago when they passed it, as well as the bank or bailout.
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:42.680]  And you said that by the later end of 2010, the stimulus would run out and that they would make the decision for another stimulus which might extend it for another year,
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:49.680]  but the decline would still be there just more gradual or things would accelerate plunging downward.
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:52.680]  Bob Chapman, give us your breakdown now.
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:58.680]  Well, we just saw almost 10, well, it was about 10 months ago.
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:07.680]  The bankers on Wall Street went along the dollar and short the euro.
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:20.680]  And I didn't know why at the time we found out when the grease got in the middle of the news along with the other unfortunate countries in the euro zone that had problems.
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:36.680]  What the banks did when the euro got down around 120 is they covered their shorts in the euro and they sold out their long positions in the dollar and probably reversed them.
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:47.680]  Because the dollar has come right back down, it went from 74 to 89, 89 back to almost 80, and it's on its way back to test 74 again.
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:16:00.680]  Now, the reason I bring that up is that what they were trying to do was set up a buffer in the dollar, a place for it to fall from not from 74 but from 89.
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:05.680]  And I think that was the main impetus behind what they did.
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:16.680]  Now, what was going to make the dollar come down was what I talked about about three or four weeks ago.
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:29.680]  And that was that I believed that the Fed was going to tell the banks to start lending and shut off their interest on the money that they had deposited with the Fed.
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:40.680]  What the Fed did is they lent money to the banks that no interest, the bank funded back to them at two and a half percent interest and the U.S. taxpayer paid for it.
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:43.680]  The banks have over a trillion dollars.
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:49.680]  They can lend as much as they want against that on a fractionalized basis.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:59.680]  Now, the Fed needs five trillion dollars over the next two years to keep the economy from plunging.
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:06.680]  And so if the bankers have a trillion dollars, all they have to do is create four trillion dollars more.
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:07.680]  So you're saying that...
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:08.680]  The money that they need.
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:14.680]  I mean, to correct me if I'm wrong, you're saying that's going to be the second stimulus by stealth.
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:21.680]  Let's call it the third because George the idiot did the same thing.
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:23.680]  So we've had... this is the third one, really.
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:36.680]  And so this one is going to be done, but it has to be done differently, not quite by stealth, because legislature will not give the money for a stimulus package again.
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:39.680]  My point is they're not advertising it.
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:40.680]  Not at all.
[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:47.680]  In fact, they had to have two votes in the Senate to get the 34 million dollar extension for unemployment.
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:51.680]  And it was very difficult to pass.
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:59.680]  And so the Fed knows and has known for almost a year that this was going to be the track that they were going to have to take.
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:03.680]  Now, they have people working 24-7 of hundreds of...
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:05.680]  Figuring this stuff out.
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:09.680]  So this doesn't happen overnight to these people.
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:16.680]  All right, Bob, here's the $64 million question because you've been stunningly accurate in the last 12 years on this radio show.
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:21.680]  What is this new economic policy, which is really a continuation of the old one?
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:25.680]  How is it going to affect the stock market, the economy, housing prices?
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:27.680]  What's your prognosis?
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:35.680]  We just came from $96.86 to approximately $10,600.
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:40.680]  And that's what really keyed me in about a month ago.
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:46.680]  I have to back into everything that these people are doing because I don't have any connections in the Illuminati.
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:51.680]  So I figured that they were discounting something that was going to happen.
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:55.680]  And the most natural thing is what I just described to you.
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:58.680]  And as it turns out, again, I was correct.
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:18:59.680]  This is where they're heading.
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:08.680]  And three trial balloons went up, the president of the St. Louis Fed, the head of PIMCO.
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:10.680]  I can't pronounce his name.
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:12.680]  It's an Arabic name.
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:20.680]  And the third one, that's even though I speak six languages, the third one was Joe Stiglitz.
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:25.680]  And so these trial balloons went up and the balloons were saying,
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:30.680]  we've got to do another stimulus package if we don't we're doomed.
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:32.680]  And quite frankly, they're right.
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:38.680]  But the point is, here it is, the Fed over the next two or three weeks will tell you
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:41.680]  that they're going to have to be helpful to the economy.
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:43.680]  They won't give you any numbers.
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:45.680]  And that's what they're going to do.
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:47.680]  You can call it stealth if you want.
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:51.680]  But it's on the way and everything will go sideways for two years.
[02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:55.680]  Okay, Bob Chapman, stay there. Let's break down your forecast.
[02:19:55.680 --> 02:19:58.680]  So just this slow easing into depression.

[02:23:54.680 --> 02:24:21.680]  You will be surprised when you visit www.batteriestation.com.
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:27.680]  Bob you said the last stimulus would last about a year.
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:34.680]  You're saying this one will go sideways for two years because we're, I mean sideways means will continue its trajectory.
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:50.680]  Our trajectory is incrementally down in the economy really not even on life support right now with layoffs and firings and so quantify what sideways means.
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:25:01.680]  Well first of all, I think that they're going to commit twice the amount of money and credit that they did last time about 2.5 trillion.
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:04.680]  So that would be 5 trillion in total.
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:16.680]  And if it starts here in a couple of weeks and starts to seep into the economy over the next three or four months, then we'll compare it to what they've just done.
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:29.680]  They had five quarters which gross GDP growth in this last stimulus time frame averaged between three and three and a half percent.
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:31.680]  We'll say three and a quarter.
[02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:38.680]  Real growth was probably about one and a half percent.
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:46.680]  And so the economy wasn't totally tanking but it wasn't really doing anything. It was keeping its head above water.
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:54.680]  This time there's going to be more lending to small and medium sized businesses if they want the money.
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:26:05.680]  And you'll see a letter to the editor and tomorrow's issue of the forecaster where one of the subscribers is an attorney.
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:09.680]  No, he's not. He's a company and owns a company.
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:28.680]  Describes that in the last 15 months the lenders cut back over 25 percent the amount of money that they normally would have available for small and medium sized businesses which creates 70 percent of the jobs.
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:41.680]  Now normally you would think, well, if the loans are going to be available, they're going to make up to 25 percent lending, then we're going to have a lot more people working and they're going to take these loans and they're going to expand, et cetera.
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:43.680]  It's not going to happen that way.
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:52.680]  And the reason why is too many of these companies have gone out of business, too many of the people who run these companies are saying, no, we're not going to get suckered in again on this thing.
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:27:01.680]  And they're going to be cool about borrowing. So they're not going to get anywhere near the borrowing that they hope to over that time frame.
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:10.680]  But Bob, how does Iran tie in? I mean, they're really moving towards an attack by Christmas or before then, green lighting it.
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:14.680]  And I mean, how will that affect the economy?
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:28.680]  Well, first of all, if it's green lighted, Israel will make the attack, whether it's on Lebanon, Syria, or directly on Iran, remains to be seen.
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:35.680]  The possibilities of that happening are excellent. And how will that affect it?
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:50.680]  The Fed is going to go ahead and do what I described, I believe, anyway. And so instead of getting three and a quarter percent growth, they might get one and a half, including all the stimulus, when in fact the real numbers should have been minus one.
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:59.680]  So they're not going to go anywhere. Unemployment, which is 22 and three eighth percent, should drop to 20 percent. That's the best they're going to do if they can do that.
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:07.680]  And so you might call it profitless prosperity that cost the American taxpayer five trillion dollars.
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:16.680]  As far as the war is concerned, like the previous two conflicts, one of which is still involved in Afghanistan, it'll be off budget.
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:24.680]  We're already over a trillion dollars. What will it cost if it's a third world war? Probably another five trillion.
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:37.680]  And so we're going to have rapid inflation. And as you've seen, the wages go nowhere. Real inflation continues at seven or eight percent.
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:46.680]  Whereas the government says it's two or one and a half percent or whatever their bogus number is, just like the bogus number for unemployment.
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:59.680]  And so part of the unemployment problem will probably be solved if there's a third world war by shipping young people out of the country so they can go over and get slaughtered.
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:09.680]  Well, either way, you look at the different scenarios involved with an attack on Iran. It runs from horrible to just unbelievably bad.
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:27.680]  And what are your military sources telling you? Because my sources, and a lot of it's also in the mainstream news, are showing a very clear image and development towards not just a foreign war, but a massive domestic crackdown.
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:33.680]  They're really getting the public ready for troops to be used against the American people and for civil unrest.
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:40.680]  I mean, that's even in the Wall Street Journal today. So we'll come back, talk to Bob Chapman about that. Open the phones up for any issues you want to discuss.
[02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:50.680]  Bob is a jack-of-all-tradesman in this 50 years fighting the globalists. We'll discuss it all coming up, long segment straight ahead.
[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:59.680]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.680 --> 02:30:05.680]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:08.680]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:12.680]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:12.680 --> 02:30:16.680]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:22.680]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:26.680]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:30.680]  He's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:35.680]  We have the facts. We have the constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law.
[02:30:35.680 --> 02:30:39.680]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:41.680]  Don't tread on me. Rise of the Republic.
[02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:46.680]  Terrany is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:03.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:08.680]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:14.680]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:19.680]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:24.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:28.680]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:31.680]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:35.680]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:40.680]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:45.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:07.680]  Music
[02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:20.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:24.680]  We're back live. Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:29.680]  We're going to take some of your phone calls. I also want to look at this Bloomberg Business Week report.
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:36.680]  Gold prices extend rally as odious dollar drops versus the euro.
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:40.680]  But you notice the euro drops, then the dollar drops, then the euro goes back a little bit,
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:44.680]  then the dollar drops, then the dollar will go back a little bit, then the euro drops,
[02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:46.680]  then it goes back up, then it drops.
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:49.680]  But if you look at the long-term charts, it's all just going down.
[02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:56.680]  Concerted, coordinated, global currency devaluation run by the same group of crooks.
[02:33:56.680 --> 02:33:59.680]  We'll be talking to Bob again here in just a moment.
[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:05.680]  But first, I want to tell you about a wonderful Made in America company, and that's Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:10.680]  They've got motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, all made in Tennessee and Georgia, wonderful people,

[02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:28.680]  If we don't start buying American, we're dead.
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:33.680]  How many people do I know that say they want to have jobs that go shop at Walmart
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:35.680]  where it's almost all made in China?
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:38.680]  gussetclothing.com.
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:41.680]  I also want to tell you about eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:44.680]  They are the leader in high-quality, storeable foods.
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:48.680]  And the reason I've bought storeable food is the ongoing, deepening depression
[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:53.680]  in case society completely collapses or there's World War III, I mean, now more than ever.
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:57.680]  You really are crazy if you don't have high-quality, storeable foods, and this is the place.
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:00.680]  This is what, you know, where I've gotten my storeable foods.
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:05.680]  The letter E, just eFoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633.

[02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:16.680]  One word.

[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:52.680]  Bob, before we go to calls, gold.
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:56.680]  You did say, what, three weeks ago on the show when gold was going down,
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:36:03.680]  you said, look for the dollar when it starts going down for gold to go back up.
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:06.680]  And going from memory, you said that, and this has been true in the past,
[02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:09.680]  that normally the two were somewhat coupled together.
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:12.680]  But that now, you said this again last week,
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:15.680]  that there when gold was still basically the same from the drop,
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:19.680]  that there'd been a 80% decoupling.
[02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:25.680]  So what does this mean, this big rally in gold the last few days?
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:32.680]  Well, first of all, on Wednesday's issue, I said that on Thursday or Friday,
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:36.680]  we'd break back out again and did it happen today.
[02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:39.680]  And you just can't keep it down,
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:44.680]  because I think that the main reason that gold has been as strong as it has
[02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:49.680]  over the past 15 months is because it's challenged the dollar
[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:52.680]  as the only real currency in the world.
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:56.680]  And that's extraordinarily important. If you go back 6,000 years, you'll see the same thing.
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:02.680]  In the first six months of the year, all the currencies fell against gold.
[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:05.680]  The US dollar, 13.3%.
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:09.680]  I mean, if that would have continued, it would be about 25% for the year,
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:11.680]  which it's been doing for the last 10 years.
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:16.680]  But, you know, you don't know about that unless you listen to this program,
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:19.680]  because the main line really is not going to tell you that.
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:24.680]  So it's going to go back up and challenge its high here over the next little while,
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:26.680]  which was around 1260.
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:29.680]  And it'll go through it and it'll go higher again.
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:33.680]  The gold would have been up substantially more today,
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:37.680]  had not it been for the intercession of the United States government
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:41.680]  knocking it down from a plus 15 to about a plus 680.
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:44.680]  It's now trading around a plus 8.
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:51.680]  And, you know, they are fighting a rearguard action.
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:54.680]  They can't win, and they know that.
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:56.680]  They can't beat gold.
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:59.680]  And they're scurrying around and they're trying to find out,
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:03.680]  should we use SDRs, which have no backing, incidentally,
[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:07.680]  and can't legally have any backing as an IMF instrument,
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:12.680]  or should we have the things that Keynes talked about called the bank core.
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:14.680]  Now they're trying to find alternatives.
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:18.680]  Anything that they come up with that does not have gold backing,
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:23.680]  they better forget it, because it isn't going to happen.
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:28.680]  Bob, I mean, I'm not a financial wizard,
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:33.680]  but I can look at the last eight years and gold slowly going up, up, up, up, up.
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:38.680]  And if you look at the graph on a monthly or two monthly basis,
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:42.680]  you see it go up and down, but over time it's going straight up.
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:48.680]  So people should be able to very easily make profits continually,
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:52.680]  either in gold stocks or in the physical market.
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:55.680]  But I guess if they're watching MSNBC or CNBC,
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:59.680]  they're not going to tell them these basic facts.
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:01.680]  Well, you're certainly right about that.
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:05.680]  And the coins, they continue to go up.
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:08.680]  The bullion continues to go up.
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:11.680]  The graded numismatic coins continue to go up more,
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:13.680]  because there's only so many of them.
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:17.680]  And the shares have gone up very well.
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:25.680]  I think that the graded numismatics are way underpriced,
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:28.680]  and I think they should be selling higher.
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:34.680]  If you go back to the Great Depression between 1929 and 1936,
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:37.680]  the two leading mines at the time were dome mines at Homestake.
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:43.680]  Dome went up 558 percent, and Homestake went up 474 percent
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:47.680]  during an deflationary environment.
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:51.680]  Very important, because that tells you that gold-related assets
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:55.680]  are going to do well whether we have inflation or deflation.
[02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:57.680]  It doesn't make any difference.
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:03.680]  In fact, I would want to own gold-related assets more
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:05.680]  during a deflationary period,
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:12.680]  because at least you're going to keep your purchasing power.
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:13.680]  Where do you see gold?
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:15.680]  And it's very important.
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:19.680]  Where do you see gold by year-end?
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:22.680]  Oh, I think we can easily get to 1650.
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:24.680]  And it all depends on what happens.
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:30.680]  If we have an attack in the Middle East on Lebanon, Syria, or Iran,
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:34.680]  I would think that that would artificially, probably,
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:38.680]  on a short-term basis make the dollar stronger,
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:44.680]  because the United States is geographically far removed from that area.
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:46.680]  But gold would go up.
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:48.680]  It would be a perfect scenario for gold,
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:51.680]  and it's going to get fought all the way.
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:55.680]  These people, behind the scenes in Washington and London,
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:58.680]  are going to do everything they can to keep it down.
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:00.680]  They will not be successful.
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:04.680]  In the final analysis, it will break out and run and go crazy.
[02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:06.680]  The longer they keep this thing down,
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:10.680]  they started doing this in 1988 officially and legally.
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:13.680]  But I've been in the markets since 1960.
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:19.680]  And in 1960, 60, 67, and 68, they illegally did it.
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:24.680]  And they did it again October the 19th, 1987.
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:26.680]  So this is nothing new.
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:28.680]  They know the power of gold.
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:31.680]  And if you hark back to what Paul Volcker said
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:33.680]  when he tried to save the economy,
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:36.680]  which he actually did during the early 1980s,
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:38.680]  he said, the only big mistake I made
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:41.680]  is that he didn't suppress the gold price.
[02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:43.680]  Final question on this issue,
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:45.680]  and we're going to phone calls and a few other news items.
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:50.680]  I want to go over with you here, Bob, for this hour elapses.
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:55.680]  It seems what they're doing is trying to just have a slow increase in gold price
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:41:59.680]  so people don't psychologically have a gold rush
[02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:03.680]  and realize that it's one of the few decent investments out there
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:07.680]  and that they understand that psychologically it's then perceived
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:09.680]  as just moderately good investment
[02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:14.680]  because they are able to slow its basic increase.
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:16.680]  That's true.
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:20.680]  And they know in the end that it's going to go up considerably.
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:23.680]  And they're not too concerned about that because they own a lot of it.
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:26.680]  How much I don't know and neither does anybody else.
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:32.680]  It's just like we don't know how much gold in Fort Knox belongs to the United States government.
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:34.680]  We know it's there.
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:37.680]  I do because I have subscribers that guarded it.
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:41.680]  So I know firsthand from them that it's there.
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:43.680]  But who does it belong to?
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:48.680]  And is it tungsten bars that's coated with gold?
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:50.680]  We don't know that.
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:53.680]  We don't know that.
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:58.680]  And it's strange that Congress wouldn't demand an audit
[02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:02.680]  just to make everybody happy and shut people like me up.
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:04.680]  Well, they're acting very secretively.
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:06.680]  Let's take some phone calls with Bob Chapman.
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:07.680]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:10.680]  If you just tuned in, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:12.680]  the number one alternative radio program on the globe.
[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:15.680]  The websites are info wars dot com and prison planet dot com.
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:18.680]  And of course we I'm also a documentary filmmaker
[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:22.680]  available on the websites as well and at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:24.680]  Bob Chapman's excellent website.
[02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:28.680]  It's indispensable to understand the economy and politics is theinternationalforecaster.com.
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:31.680]  Let's go to Josh in California.
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:33.680]  Josh, you're on the air.
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:34.680]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:37.680]  Hey, Bob, I have a statement and then just a quick question.
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:41.680]  Quick statement is my cousin actually just sent me a text saying,
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:43.680]  I should listen to NPR.
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:46.680]  There's a segment that they just did this morning called voodoo history,
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:48.680]  debunking conspiracy theories.
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:53.680]  So I know there's no question that you are definitely having an effect
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:56.680]  because ever since over the last what two weeks now or a week and a half,
[02:43:56.680 --> 02:43:58.680]  you've been asking us to do the search terms.
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:02.680]  So they're now the establishment is doing everything they can to use their quote unquote,
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:10.680]  you know, progressive radio to try to get the liberal media to push away the conspiracy.
[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:12.680]  Well, Josh, let me be clear, though.
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:15.680]  I mean, out of hundreds of prominent people fighting the globalist,
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:20.680]  myself and Ron Paul are the most prominent, Ron Paul, even more prominent,
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:22.680]  which is actually a scary position to be in.
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:25.680]  I will tell you, but I don't deserve the credit.
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:28.680]  You, the listeners taking action deserve it.
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:31.680]  But it's more than just Alex Jones here speaking out.
[02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:35.680]  If I wouldn't have spoken out and Bob wouldn't have spoken out for five decades,
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:39.680]  my shelf a decade and a half, you'd already have a big awakening happening
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:42.680]  because things are so bad and so out in the open.
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:47.680]  But because we were there being laughed at for decades, some listen, some didn't.
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:52.680]  Now people are really paying attention because patriots quote conspiracy theorists
[02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:55.680]  have done a good job of telling the truth.
[02:44:55.680 --> 02:44:58.680]  And so we've got a lot of credibility when the mainstream media and government
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:00.680]  has lost all their credibility.
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:06.680]  Bob Chapman comments on this because the enemy is pulling out all the stops to demonize us.
[02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:08.680]  Well, there's no question about that.
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:13.680]  And there's two things that bother me. Number one, that we need more help
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:19.680]  and we need more people on talk radio and writing and telling the world about what's going on.
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:21.680]  So please come and help us.
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:24.680]  You know, I'm getting old and long in the tooth.
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:28.680]  And second of all, I'm deeply disappointed in newsletter writers
[02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:33.680]  with the exception of three or four, all of them who know about what's going on
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:34.680]  won't talk about it.
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:38.680]  And I wish they would because, you know, we could use their help.
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:44.680]  And yes, we do have the establishment media, the people behind the scenes.
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:49.680]  They are deeply concerned because they weren't, we're eating their lunch.
[02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:51.680]  Well, here, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:45:51.680 --> 02:45:56.680]  And I want to get your take on this, Bob, and then Josh is and we'll move on.
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:59.680]  In the past, they could just say, fluoride's good for you.
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:03.680]  But now all these top scientists that even work for the government have the Internet to speak out.
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:05.680]  And they're exposing it.
[02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:09.680]  So the globalist, and it's the same on the economy, war, terrorism, all of it.
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:13.680]  They're still playing the old game from 10, 20, 30 years ago in the Cold War
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:16.680]  where they could just lie to us, take the case of Vietnam.
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:22.680]  Five to 6,000 advisors died in the first four years of the secret war from 60 to 64.
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:25.680]  They would just lie to the public and get away with it.
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:29.680]  Or they staged the Gulf of Tonkin and it'd take decades for it to come out.
[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:30.680]  It was staged.
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:36.680]  Now, they've been lying and saying they're not naked body scanning people
[02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:40.680]  and saving the images or that it's not dangerous radiation.
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:42.680]  Now it's come out, they lied.
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:45.680]  And so now they're being exposed pretty much in real time,
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:50.680]  but they still have the old instincts and old habits of just stonewalling us.
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:52.680]  And now they look like the naked emperor.
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:57.680]  I mean, now they look like clowns.
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:00.680]  And that's for sure they do.
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:03.680]  Josh, any final comments on that?
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:04.680]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:06.680]  I think that, well, they're also conditioning us.
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:08.680]  I mean, look, it's so basic.
[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:11.680]  If you read your toothpaste tube, it even says,
[02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:15.680]  do not, if ingest more than a pea-sized amount, call poison control.
[02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:18.680]  How do people not see that and understand that it's a poison?
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:19.680]  That's one, too.
[02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:23.680]  You see the media now pushing American terrorism, American-grown terrorism.
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:27.680]  All these people are now being arrested left and right, and they're conditioning us to believe
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:31.680]  that the American people are the next terrorist.
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:35.680]  It is so blatantly obvious, and this goes into my question,
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:39.680]  which was, were we focusing a lot on Iran being potentially the next war,
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:41.680]  which I believe it could be?
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:46.680]  Well, what about the threat of the North and South Korea turmoil that's going on?
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:51.680]  We have China that's doing these military drills, showing their force, showing their power.
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:55.680]  Hillary Clinton blaming North Korea for that obvious, you know,
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:59.680]  the Gulf of Tonkin situation in South Korea.
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:02.680]  What are both of your opinions on the potential that it could even be,
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:05.680]  you know, maybe a South Korea-North Korea that could potentially start?
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:07.680]  Great points, Josh. We're running out of time.
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:09.680]  Bob, real fast, give us your take.
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:14.680]  I think China would write war, would want war.
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:16.680]  1.4 billion people.
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:18.680]  They got to get rid of them.
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:19.680]  They got too many people.
[02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:22.680]  That's why they're eugenicists. That's why they've signed on to it.
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:27.680]  That's right, and we still have Venezuela, which they'd like to knock off
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.680]  and show the people in Latin America that the U.S. is still king down there.
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:35.680]  And so there are other places that could start to think,
[02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:37.680]  well, get them all going at the same time.
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:39.680]  Oh, yeah, that's the word, and they're admitting it now.
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:42.680]  They are planning to hit Iran and probably Venezuela at the same time
[02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:45.680]  to the proxy Columbia. Let's talk to Ryan in Washington.
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:47.680]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:50.680]  Hey, Alex. Hey, Bob. I want to be really quick here.
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:55.680]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed with a bone disease called a vascular necrosis.
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:48:59.680]  And the doctors have no idea why I got it.
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:02.680]  Idiopathic is the reason that they gave me. They don't know why.
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:05.680]  Really, all the studies show it's directly linked to fluoride.
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:11.680]  Exactly, and this is why I started listening to you shortly after I was diagnosed with this
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:14.680]  and I put two and two together, although I can't prove it.
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:18.680]  You know, that's the major studies, bone cancer, macular generation, all of it.
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:20.680]  No, that's the government knows that.
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:23.680]  The doctors, though, block out because the government's putting it in the water.
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:25.680]  That can't be it.
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:28.680]  And then even when the vaccines are killing kids in mass,
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:30.680]  they come out and say, okay, it's killing them,
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:33.680]  but you're still a conspiracy theorist for not liking it.
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:37.680]  Right. The solution they gave me was find a surgeon.
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:39.680]  I need total hip replacements, both hips,
[02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:42.680]  but I can't find a surgeon to do the surgery,
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:46.680]  but they want to give me oxycontin or push me on these pain pills,
[02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:48.680]  which I have refused.
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:50.680]  No, no, they hurt you.
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:55.680]  They hit you with a weapon, and then they sell you the solution.
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:58.680]  So I have refused the narcotics.
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:04.680]  That's all I really got to say is I just don't drink the water.
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:06.680]  Get mad. I'm mad.
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:10.680]  Well, what happens is, and I'm boiling this down into layman's terms
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:12.680]  from the scientific reports I've read,
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:17.680]  is it calcifies in the bones, and then it causes abnormal bone growth.
[02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:20.680]  And, I mean, thyroidism.
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:22.680]  How many women do you know they're 20 years old
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:24.680]  and have a thyroid of a 75-year-old?
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:26.680]  I mean, every restaurant I sit in, half the time,
[02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:29.680]  they're women talking about their thyroids, the sodium fluoride.
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:31.680]  Bob, why do you think the media has come out
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:34.680]  and admitted they want to put lithium in the water lately?
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:38.680]  Probably because it's another blatant move forward
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:41.680]  and they move to let everybody know how powerful they are.
[02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:45.680]  Exactly. It's, hey, we're going to put lithium in your water,
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:48.680]  and it's going to be in every major newspaper promoting it,
[02:50:48.680 --> 02:50:50.680]  and when Alex Jones comes out and says it's a bad idea,
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:53.680]  Wired Magazine's going to tell their readers it doesn't exist
[02:50:53.680 --> 02:50:55.680]  because they have nothing but contempt for you.
[02:50:55.680 --> 02:51:09.680]  We'll be back with more calls. Stay with us.
[02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:27.680]  How to create the perfect hiding place
[02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:30.680]  as well as the places you should never hide your guns
[02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:32.680]  under any circumstance.
[02:51:32.680 --> 02:51:34.680]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets
[02:51:34.680 --> 02:51:37.680]  are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight
[02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:39.680]  when the going gets tough.
[02:51:39.680 --> 02:51:41.680]  But listen, for security reasons,
[02:51:41.680 --> 02:51:43.680]  the Hide Your Guns book and even the website
[02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:46.680]  may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:48.680]  Go to hideyourguns.com
[02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:50.680]  that's hideyourguns.com
[02:51:50.680 --> 02:51:54.680]  or call 877-327-0365
[02:51:54.680 --> 02:51:56.680]  and come for your guns.
[02:51:56.680 --> 02:52:00.680]  Hideyourguns.com right now.
[02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:03.680]  They help to create a new world order.
[02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:05.680]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:08.680]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.680 --> 02:52:11.680]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:13.680]  through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:15.680]  The new world order really is a tool
[02:52:15.680 --> 02:52:18.680]  for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.680 --> 02:52:20.680]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:23.680]  The United Nations would take over America,
[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:26.680]  the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:29.680]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence
[02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:31.680]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:52:31.680 --> 02:52:34.680]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.680 --> 02:52:36.680]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short
[02:52:36.680 --> 02:52:39.680]  of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.680 --> 02:52:42.680]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:44.680]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite
[02:52:44.680 --> 02:52:46.680]  and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:48.680]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:54:07.680 --> 02:54:09.680]  Okay, let's move quick.
[02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:11.680]  Let's talk to Tanya and Mass.
[02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:13.680]  Then Rashid, Lisa and Joe, we have time.
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:15.680]  Quick questions or comments.
[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:17.680]  Tanya, good to have you call. Welcome.
[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:19.680]  Hey Alice, thanks a lot for all the truth
[02:54:19.680 --> 02:54:21.680]  that you're spreading and I appreciate
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:23.680]  you putting yourself on the line
[02:54:23.680 --> 02:54:25.680]  to let the word out.
[02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:27.680]  Real quick, I just wanted to say that yesterday
[02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:29.680]  you were talking about privacy
[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:31.680]  and how we're all pretty much
[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:33.680]  conditioned that, you know,
[02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:35.680]  hey, look at me, look at me.
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:37.680]  I'm a celebrity with our youth being attacked.
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:39.680]  We're basically submitting
[02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:41.680]  to like, hey, here's, you know,
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:43.680]  here's my life, here's everything.
[02:54:43.680 --> 02:54:45.680]  Invade it and in turn,
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:47.680]  everything's cohesive. It all connects.
[02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:49.680]  Talk about vaccines.
[02:54:49.680 --> 02:54:51.680]  How that can destroy our immune systems.
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:53.680]  Then they bank and capitalize
[02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:55.680]  on everybody getting ill.
[02:54:55.680 --> 02:54:57.680]  And it just keeps going on with the food industry
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:54:59.680]  and the FDA and the CDC.
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:01.680]  And then the financial institution.
[02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:03.680]  It just makes sense. And when you tell people this,
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:05.680]  I can see your rant and you freak out
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:07.680]  because they think you're not bad.
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:09.680]  And then later on, they're like, oh,
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:11.680]  should I listen? And I think we all need
[02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:13.680]  to rally up and do some, like, quick.
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:15.680]  Because I'm, it's getting to a point
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:17.680]  where we're divided. You're either on their side
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:19.680]  or you're on this side.
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:21.680]  I'm going to move on to those that want to hear,
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:23.680]  but just protect those children
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:25.680]  I hear in the background
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:27.680]  and continue to tell the truth.
[02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:29.680]  And then as you said later, they come back to you
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:31.680]  and say, wow, you were right.
[02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:33.680]  I mean, how people, the government
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:35.680]  and corporations are assaulting your children.
[02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:37.680]  And now they've had 40 billionaires
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:39.680]  put their money in a tax-free kitty
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:41.680]  that they're going to make money out of
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:43.680]  funding all of this.
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:45.680]  And they have another major Rockefeller study
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:47.680]  about vaccines to sterilize you
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:49.680]  and publicly publish. Bob Chapman.
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:51.680]  You're absolutely right.
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:53.680]  And this young lady
[02:55:53.680 --> 02:55:55.680]  who has just been on the phone
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:55:57.680]  is a perfect example
[02:55:57.680 --> 02:55:59.680]  of the people who are going to carry
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:01.680]  this thing forward for us
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:03.680]  and the young men and the young men
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:05.680]  that were on earlier. And just keep it up.
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:07.680]  If you do what you can do,
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:09.680]  everybody will be
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:11.680]  able to come out relatively okay
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:13.680]  on the end. Let's move quick.
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:15.680]  Lisa in California, you're on the air.
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:17.680]  Hi, Alex.
[02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:19.680]  I wanted to suggest
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:21.680]  an idea, another idea for you to push people
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:23.680]  to do, to get back
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:25.680]  at the banks. And I think people
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:27.680]  should be encouraged to
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:29.680]  leave the major banks
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:31.680]  and go to credit unions and their small local banks.
[02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:33.680]  I agree.
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:35.680]  The banker takeover
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:37.680]  is about shutting down local banks.
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:39.680]  Bob Chapman talks about that. Got to move.
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:41.680]  Great points, Lisa. I'll be back Sunday
[02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:43.680]  4 to 6 p.m. Be sure to call me then.
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:45.680]  David in Maryland. You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:47.680]  Go ahead.
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:49.680]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[02:56:49.680 --> 02:56:51.680]  Mr. Chapman, I'm going to be quick.
[02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:53.680]  A couple of things I just wanted to point out.
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:55.680]  One of the things that I've done just recently
[02:56:55.680 --> 02:56:57.680]  becoming an Info Warrior.
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:56:59.680]  I've gone online. I've ordered
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:01.680]  a little pocket-sized
[02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:03.680]  books with
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:05.680]  the Constitution Bill of Rights in them.
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:07.680]  I've made mass copies
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:09.680]  of the Obama deception.
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:11.680]  I missed the sale that you had there.
[02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:13.680]  I'm going to get on top of the rise
[02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:15.680]  of the fall of the Republic.
[02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:17.680]  What I'm doing is along with that copy
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:19.680]  of the DVD, I'm handing them
[02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:21.680]  copies of the pocket-sized
[02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:23.680]  Bill of Rights. You can get them for a couple
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:25.680]  of cents on the dollar and the copies
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:27.680]  of the Constitution Bill of Rights in there
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:29.680]  just to inform those.
[02:57:29.680 --> 02:57:31.680]  Another thing I want to point out real quick
[02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:33.680]  on top of the
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:35.680]  fluoride. I'm 36 years old. I remember
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:37.680]  back in the 80s and 90s, my father
[02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:39.680]  talking about fluoride and water, how
[02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:41.680]  bad it was, excuse me, how bad it was
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:43.680]  for his family. I'm from a family
[02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:45.680]  of seven. You don't see that much anymore.
[02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:47.680]  And him ordering
[02:57:47.680 --> 02:57:49.680]  weekly supplies of those
[02:57:49.680 --> 02:57:51.680]  Deer Park water jugs or so.
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:53.680]  And on that,
[02:57:53.680 --> 02:57:55.680]  the Centrum
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:57:57.680]  and one of the big
[02:57:57.680 --> 02:57:59.680]  vitamin companies out there, along with
[02:57:59.680 --> 02:58:01.680]  the GNC,
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:03.680]  they placed inside of
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:05.680]  labeled on their product
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:07.680]  titanium dioxide,
[02:58:07.680 --> 02:58:09.680]  which is also found
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:11.680]  in toothpaste and is considered a carcinogen.
[02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:13.680]  I'm out of time, Rashid.
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:15.680]  Great points. I tell you, Bob
[02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:17.680]  Chapman, it's great to hear how informed
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:19.680]  people are.
[02:58:19.680 --> 02:58:21.680]  I love it, and I want them to keep on
[02:58:21.680 --> 02:58:23.680]  doing it, and thanks for listening, all
[02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:25.680]  of you.
[02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:27.680]  Bob will talk to you again, God willing, next Friday
[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:29.680]  during the third hour. Take care.
[02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:31.680]  Bye-bye, and you too.
[02:58:31.680 --> 02:58:33.680]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, coming up
[02:58:33.680 --> 02:58:35.680]  in the hour on infowars.com
[02:58:35.680 --> 02:58:37.680]  and the radio stations, I'm going to be covering
[02:58:37.680 --> 02:58:39.680]  the Rockefellers and a lot more.
[02:58:41.680 --> 02:58:43.680]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.680 --> 02:58:47.680]  Visit GCNLive.com

[02:58:51.680 --> 02:58:53.680]  with key information.
[02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:55.680]  The mainstream media is now admitting
[02:58:55.680 --> 02:58:57.680]  that we're going into a depression. Don't
[02:58:57.680 --> 02:58:59.680]  be dependent on the government for you and
[02:58:59.680 --> 02:59:01.680]  your family. You need to get your own supply
[02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:03.680]  of high quality, storable foods
[02:59:03.680 --> 02:59:05.680]  from eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:05.680 --> 02:59:07.680]  They're the best company out there, the longest
[02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:09.680]  continually operating, with a ton
[02:59:09.680 --> 02:59:11.680]  of great food to choose from.
[02:59:11.680 --> 02:59:13.680]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[02:59:13.680 --> 02:59:15.680]  Not some old, cruddy food they're selling
[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:17.680]  you like some of the other guys. Try their
[02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:19.680]  new evacuation pack, a two week supply
[02:59:19.680 --> 02:59:21.680]  of delicious, easy to fix food.
[02:59:21.680 --> 02:59:23.680]  It comes with all the equipment you need to
[02:59:23.680 --> 02:59:25.680]  prepare it, with open talk of a strike
[02:59:25.680 --> 02:59:27.680]  on Iran the next three months, the crisis
[02:59:27.680 --> 02:59:29.680]  in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:31.680]  Get yourself and your family ready
[02:59:31.680 --> 02:59:33.680]  today. The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.
