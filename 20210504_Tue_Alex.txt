[00:00.000 --> 00:07.520]  An altercation in St. Clair Shores, where 33-year-old Kristen Hoff was told to leave
[00:07.520 --> 00:10.000]  Nino Savagio's for failing to wear a mask.
[00:10.000 --> 00:13.240]  She allegedly assaulted a clerk and spit on officers.
[00:13.240 --> 00:18.680]  Over in Holly, 68-year-old Rex Gommal has been charged with misdemeanor assault and
[00:18.680 --> 00:23.560]  battery for wiping his nose and face on a store clerk after being told he had to wear
[00:23.560 --> 00:24.560]  a mask.
[00:24.560 --> 00:29.320]  A man enraged inside a San Antonio store and refusing to wear one.
[00:29.320 --> 00:32.520]  The situation escalates with shouting and screaming.
[00:32.520 --> 00:36.080]  The fight was over one man not wearing a mask.
[00:36.080 --> 00:40.480]  That man pulled out a knife and stabbed a 77-year-old before taking off.
[00:40.480 --> 00:41.960]  There have been shootings.
[00:41.960 --> 00:46.200]  Munnerland, a security guard at a family dollar in Flint, was shot in the back of the
[00:46.200 --> 00:49.840]  head for refusing service to a woman who didn't want to wear a mask.
[00:49.840 --> 00:54.840]  A group of men pull up and try to enter without face masks, which is not allowed.
[00:54.840 --> 00:59.240]  The group argues with security and masked customers before heading back to the parking
[00:59.240 --> 01:00.240]  lot.
[01:00.240 --> 01:04.040]  Minutes later, the masked and unmasked groups are seen arguing and fighting.
[01:04.040 --> 01:05.800]  Both sides pull guns.
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.080]  Charles Jackson, Jr. in the black ball cap and other security guards try to break up the
[01:10.080 --> 01:11.080]  fight.
[01:11.080 --> 01:14.120]  Jackson is then shot twice and falls to the ground.
[01:14.120 --> 01:18.320]  The unmasked party speeds off, the suspected shooter taking off in this white Mercedes
[01:18.320 --> 01:19.320]  SUV.
[01:19.320 --> 01:23.840]  Jackson, a Marine veteran and family man, remains in critical condition tonight.
[01:23.840 --> 01:28.960]  There have been totalitarian warnings from the petty tyrants grasping for the ring of
[01:28.960 --> 01:29.960]  power.
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.120]  Almost 50 percent of Republicans are refusing to get the vaccine, so we won't reach herd
[01:35.120 --> 01:38.160]  immunity because of those particular groups.
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.640]  So I say we need to shun those that refuse to get vaccinated.
[01:42.640 --> 01:49.120]  Just like now, in certain states, many states, I know in New York, there are signs on store
[01:49.120 --> 01:54.280]  fronts, on businesses all across the state, no mask, no entry.
[01:54.280 --> 01:57.960]  I think if you have not been vaccinated, no entry.
[01:57.960 --> 01:59.320]  You want to get on a plane?
[01:59.320 --> 02:00.480]  You got to be vaccinated.
[02:00.480 --> 02:01.880]  Show proof of vaccination.
[02:01.880 --> 02:05.160]  And those people that don't want to get vaccinated, then that's fine.
[02:05.160 --> 02:06.280]  That's fine for you.
[02:06.280 --> 02:11.600]  But then you can't spread it to other people that are vaccinated.
[02:11.600 --> 02:17.000]  You can't spread it to other people, rather, that are also not vaccinated, then you don't
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.880]  get those other liberties that come with immunity.
[02:20.880 --> 02:23.240]  It's just something has to break.
[02:23.240 --> 02:27.840]  If that's your personal choice not to get vaccinated, you don't then get to infringe
[02:27.840 --> 02:33.320]  on the right of those who have chosen to protect their fellow citizens.
[02:33.320 --> 02:38.480]  There's also the stick, which could be wielded by government and the private sector.
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.960]  Businesses have particular leverage as they can require employees to get vaccinations
[02:42.960 --> 02:48.080]  and restrict public access to private spaces like airlines, mass transit, most sporting
[02:48.080 --> 02:51.640]  and cultural venues, restaurants and movie theaters.
[02:51.640 --> 02:57.440]  Writing in USA Today, Michael Stern, a former federal prosecutor, said this.
[02:57.440 --> 03:01.120]  Businesses should make vaccination a requirement for employment.
[03:01.120 --> 03:05.960]  A COVID outbreak can shut down a business and be financially devastating, and failure
[03:05.960 --> 03:10.240]  to enforce basic health and safety measures is not fair to employees who have to work
[03:10.240 --> 03:14.920]  in offices, factories and stores where close contact is required.
[03:14.920 --> 03:20.720]  The great American mask panic has even gripped the fragile mind of Joe Biden as he clumsily
[03:20.720 --> 03:25.960]  attempts to wield the power of the symbolism of the mask over the masses.
[03:25.960 --> 03:32.120]  Looking for my mask, I'm in trouble.
[03:32.120 --> 03:36.000]  The mask itself has been exposed as a fraud.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.240]  Wearing masks like that is wasting a mask.
[03:38.240 --> 03:40.840]  It's a mask that won't be available when it's actually needed.
[03:40.840 --> 03:44.640]  The state government's advice on wearing face masks is in line with the World Health
[03:44.640 --> 03:46.120]  Organization.
[03:46.120 --> 03:50.680]  Under its guidelines, masks should only be worn if you have a cough, fever and difficulty
[03:50.680 --> 03:51.680]  breathing.
[03:51.680 --> 03:56.240]  Or if you are healthy and taking care of someone with these symptoms and or someone with a
[03:56.240 --> 03:58.680]  confirmed case of COVID-19.
[03:58.680 --> 04:04.320]  If you do not have these symptoms, you do not have to wear masks because there is no
[04:04.320 --> 04:07.880]  evidence that they protect people who are not sick.
[04:07.880 --> 04:17.320]  Once a mask gets wet, maybe from our exhalation, it really begins to decrement in effectiveness
[04:17.320 --> 04:21.600]  in filtering any sort of respiratory particulate matter.
[04:21.600 --> 04:26.320]  It's the safety video going viral.
[04:26.320 --> 04:33.640]  An Argentinian firefighter with a deodorant can simulating a sneeze or cough.
[04:33.640 --> 04:37.920]  Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.
[04:37.920 --> 04:40.600]  There's no reason to be walking around with a mask.
[04:40.600 --> 04:46.640]  The tyranny will only end when the COVID fables are fully exposed and those in power are voted
[04:46.640 --> 04:52.000]  out for aiding and abetting the dangerous United Nations deception known as the Great
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  Reset.
[04:53.000 --> 05:04.520]  I'm John Bowne reporting.
[05:04.520 --> 05:24.000]  I'm John Bowne and I'm here to talk to you about what's going on in the United States.
[05:24.000 --> 05:33.520]  I'm John Bowne and I'm here to talk to you about what's going on in the United States.
[05:33.520 --> 05:50.880]  I'm John Bowne and I'm here to talk to you about what's going on in the United States.
[06:03.520 --> 06:30.200]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[06:30.200 --> 06:38.840]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:38.840 --> 06:41.680]  It's Tuesday, May 4th.
[06:41.680 --> 06:43.240]  The year is 2021.
[06:43.240 --> 06:51.120]  I am your host, Alex Jones, from the embattled Infowars news headquarters deep in the heart
[06:51.120 --> 06:54.080]  of Texas, Austin, transmitting worldwide.
[06:54.080 --> 06:59.120]  Well, I've said this many times, but it becomes more and more true each and every hour, each
[06:59.120 --> 07:01.200]  and every day, each and every minute.
[07:01.200 --> 07:08.160]  The quickening is here and all that has been hidden is basically being revealed.
[07:08.160 --> 07:13.960]  Evil is attempting to bring in total worldwide martial law under the guise of medical tyranny,
[07:13.960 --> 07:22.520]  but it's much bigger than just medical tyranny to be able to suppress the human population.
[07:22.520 --> 07:26.920]  Let me just give you a boil down of what is in front of us today.
[07:26.920 --> 07:31.400]  Here's CBS News reporting on what we knew was coming.
[07:31.400 --> 07:35.520]  That the, quote, booster shots, OC, wasn't just two COVID shots yet again.
[07:35.520 --> 07:39.760]  It was another one and another one and some other treatments, Bill Gates told you last
[07:39.760 --> 07:40.760]  year.
[07:40.760 --> 07:43.360]  He's not going to tell you right now, but we knew what they were out of MIT.
[07:43.360 --> 07:44.600]  He funded it.
[07:44.600 --> 07:45.600]  It's a patch.
[07:45.600 --> 07:51.120]  You put on your arm that worms little pieces of glass into your body that have little microscopic
[07:51.120 --> 07:55.400]  tracker chips in them because things are so miniaturized now so they can even track you
[07:55.400 --> 08:01.400]  from the air with a helicopter or with a, quote, smartphone or other sensors.
[08:01.400 --> 08:06.480]  That CBS News, oh, good news, the boosters are going to be patches.
[08:06.480 --> 08:11.960]  Your COVID vaccine will be a patch or a pill that will track you.
[08:11.960 --> 08:17.960]  Oh, it also might come in your flu shot.
[08:17.960 --> 08:22.720]  Isn't that not, they've got this all planned out, they've got this all actuated out.
[08:22.720 --> 08:31.600]  That's why they had Mrs. Bill Gates, Mrs. French, Melinda Gates on John Oliver that
[08:31.600 --> 08:37.920]  they shot last week, but oh, the divorce, the split got announced yesterday and it's
[08:37.920 --> 08:39.120]  a very real split.
[08:39.120 --> 08:43.760]  You can see who he's hired and the fight that's being set up and going on.
[08:43.760 --> 08:47.360]  She's another fellow traveler, eugenicist, exterminist like he is.
[08:47.360 --> 08:53.440]  We'll be breaking down all the details of that today, but let me lay out really the
[08:53.440 --> 08:55.960]  biggest news here.
[08:55.960 --> 09:00.240]  It's not that John Oliver attacked Tucker Carlson and called him a baboon and called
[09:00.240 --> 09:09.400]  me a neon football and said that I fly a jet-packed spring human feces on people, even had a guy
[09:09.400 --> 09:13.440]  in a cicada suit trying to sell that vaccines are safe.
[09:13.440 --> 09:17.680]  Just that he's paid, at HBO's paid by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that's
[09:17.680 --> 09:23.440]  on record, to push that propaganda, so CNN, ABC News, and thousands of other publications
[09:23.440 --> 09:28.320]  and TV shows you name it around the world.
[09:28.320 --> 09:33.040]  I remember when they had a show here, it was called The Good Doctor, attacking Alex Jones.
[09:33.040 --> 09:36.720]  They admitted the program was attacking me, it was even in the news and it was funded by
[09:36.720 --> 09:41.840]  Bill and Melinda Gates we learned at the end of the show and the producer worked for the
[09:41.840 --> 09:42.840]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[09:42.840 --> 09:47.600]  Well, guess what we learned today?
[09:47.600 --> 09:57.200]  Dr. Joseph Merkola, who is the King Daddy medical doctor, grandpa, and by that I mean
[09:57.200 --> 10:03.040]  he's been around the longest, like Chuck Berry's the first guy to invent rock and roll.
[10:03.040 --> 10:07.240]  This guy's been around since the 80s, exposing big farm and the rest of it, and all he said
[10:07.240 --> 10:11.920]  is you need vitamin D, you need zinc, and you need C. They sent a task force of 20 Attorney
[10:11.920 --> 10:17.680]  Generals after him and tried to make him remove his material.
[10:17.680 --> 10:22.240]  They listed 12 other people or 11 other people that they want to be removed, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny
[10:22.240 --> 10:25.920]  is one of them, and he said go ahead and try to indict me if you want.
[10:25.920 --> 10:29.880]  It's on the NIH website, you need vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc or you'll die and the
[10:29.880 --> 10:33.560]  viruses will replicate in your mitochondria and then any virus will kill you if you are
[10:33.560 --> 10:36.720]  deficient in those.
[10:36.720 --> 10:41.120]  But now he's been death threaded and hit with major attacks and he's not getting into the
[10:41.120 --> 10:47.000]  full detail, but he has announced that the country's gone and that he is removing all
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.440]  information on vitamin D, zinc, and C because they threatened to kill him with paramilitary
[10:52.440 --> 10:53.440]  forces.
[10:53.440 --> 10:58.560]  He's a very serious guy, I've known him 25 years, I've interviewed him 25 years, and
[10:58.560 --> 11:05.040]  I can say I'm a friend and he's very measured, very conservative, and so you can bet this
[11:05.040 --> 11:06.040]  happened.
[11:06.040 --> 11:12.840]  So yesterday I said we are getting very extreme threats, very specific directed threats, showing
[11:12.840 --> 11:16.240]  that they are surveilling us and have inside knowledge, try to intimidate us, that doesn't
[11:16.240 --> 11:20.880]  intimidate me, you're going to pay, God's going to punish you.
[11:20.880 --> 11:28.280]  This is all a giant war on humanity, this is a giant medical assault, bringing in the
[11:28.280 --> 11:33.920]  global social credit score and the technocracy behind it, and so it's all being announced
[11:33.920 --> 11:39.920]  and here's the big headline, here's the big headline.
[11:39.920 --> 11:45.520]  They have a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation spokesperson meeting with Democrats and with
[11:45.520 --> 11:53.840]  EU leaders calling for the CIA and FBI to treat anti-vaxxers like Al Qaeda and quote
[11:53.840 --> 11:55.640]  disrupt us.
[11:55.640 --> 12:02.640]  Now that term means kill us, and he also, Dr. McCulloch quotes that here, that dovetails
[12:02.640 --> 12:08.000]  with Biden executive order strips Americans of their rights, if they indirectly or indirectly
[12:08.000 --> 12:15.320]  aid Russia, Biden will decide or the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL or CIA, no judge, no
[12:15.320 --> 12:19.960]  jury, then your bank account will be taken and if they wish they're saying green berets
[12:19.960 --> 12:24.440]  will come and kill you at your house, Navy SEALs will knock your door down with a sledgehammer
[12:24.440 --> 12:30.440]  and come in and take you to a black site, so they are starting the civil war, and see
[12:30.440 --> 12:33.640]  I can handle somebody trying to run me off the road or somebody saying what I was doing
[12:33.640 --> 12:38.840]  in my backyard or somebody telling me, hey I'm listening to your phone, I'm listening
[12:38.840 --> 12:41.920]  to you inside your house, heard what your wife said an hour ago, I'm going to cut your
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.760]  head off, that doesn't stop me because I knew this a long time ago, but it does get
[12:46.760 --> 12:51.120]  to people like McCulloch, he's not even afraid of these people, he just says this is next
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.440]  level, he's not in the military and he's just letting you know that the country's gone.
[12:55.440 --> 13:04.280]  So this is a foreign takeover, this is a multinational end of the country event you're witnessing
[13:04.280 --> 13:08.760]  right now, and of course it's just being normalized and people will just ease into it, that's
[13:08.760 --> 13:11.960]  what they say, if you're going to slit your wrist, you want to slit them in hot water
[13:11.960 --> 13:15.760]  in a tub and you don't really feel it, you just pass out in about five, ten minutes
[13:15.760 --> 13:19.920]  and die and the veins stay open.
[13:19.920 --> 13:25.840]  So that's what the country is, we're in a hot tub, our wrists are slit, we're dying
[13:25.840 --> 13:33.000]  right now, and all the property, all the enjoyment, all the largesse, it's all going with it,
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.760]  so we're going into full bondage right now.
[13:35.760 --> 13:41.840]  That brings us to, again, John Oliver and all these shows that are paid, I mean John
[13:41.840 --> 13:46.520]  Oliver said no one's died from a COVID vaccine, he said they're totally safe, he said there's
[13:46.520 --> 13:53.720]  no fetal cells in them and anybody could go in two minutes, I mean I pulled up CDC website,
[13:53.720 --> 13:59.480]  I pulled up John Hopkins, I pulled up all of this stuff, I mean it was a 21 minute show,
[13:59.480 --> 14:06.040]  so I'm not going to air the whole thing here, but everything he said was a lie, and he goes
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.760]  also, no one's trying to put microchips in you, no, they just have the University of
[14:10.760 --> 14:18.160]  Texas, MIT, all the other big scientific institutes coming up with nanotech that's in the vaccines
[14:18.160 --> 14:22.720]  so they can biologically track that indeed you were given that vaccine because they have
[14:22.720 --> 14:26.960]  markers to see, not just from antibodies, but from the vaccine itself that you have
[14:26.960 --> 14:31.960]  it in you, these are synthetic viruses, synthetic biology, then they have the little micro glass
[14:31.960 --> 14:36.120]  patches that they put on you that work into your body that can be scanned that have little
[14:36.120 --> 14:42.760]  microchips inside of them that have information on it, and that's in CBS News today, but see
[14:42.760 --> 14:47.760]  they don't want us talking about it until it rolls out, and then oh you're a kook if
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.680]  you don't do it, first oh you're a kook if you think vaccine passports and the global
[14:52.680 --> 14:56.800]  social credit score are coming, I told you that before the fake pandemic years ago and
[14:56.800 --> 15:01.760]  now it's here, oh and then once they announce it, hey that patch has got nanoglass on it,
[15:01.760 --> 15:06.560]  it works into your body, well I don't care it's easier than a needle, no no, it tracks
[15:06.560 --> 15:12.200]  you for life and it's nefarious, why doesn't it die, why do you lock your doors at night
[15:12.200 --> 15:16.840]  because there's bad people out there, and it's the same thing, they lied to us about
[15:16.840 --> 15:21.800]  every level of COVID, they killed most of the people that died with ventilators who
[15:21.800 --> 15:27.360]  didn't need it, they knew oral steroids or inhalable steroids had like a 99% rate, they
[15:27.360 --> 15:32.920]  knew hydroxychloroquine, they knew it all, they suppressed it all for fear, and now
[15:32.920 --> 15:36.240]  they're bringing in a permanent dictatorship and saying the mask and all of it never ends
[15:36.240 --> 15:39.960]  because it never ends, and now white papers are coming out of familiar mill in the gates
[15:39.960 --> 15:43.880]  and the British government, they're going to have a new lockdown soon for the flu, until
[15:43.880 --> 15:48.480]  you reject this it only gets worse, so we're going to break down the nightmare world we're
[15:48.480 --> 15:52.880]  already in, and see it's not coming, you're now inside the eugenics based world government
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.320]  post industrial, post human planet, to bring the human carbon footprint down to zero, which

[17:55.880 --> 18:04.720]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[18:04.720 --> 18:10.920]  patients, hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with
[18:10.920 --> 18:17.240]  uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many
[18:17.240 --> 18:19.440]  of the test subjects.
[18:19.440 --> 18:23.400]  In game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made,
[18:23.400 --> 18:27.160]  14 years ago we tracked and documented the Boulderburg Group's activities and they're
[18:27.160 --> 18:31.680]  planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus, the film now is more important
[18:31.680 --> 18:35.120]  than ever, when it's shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it, we have
[18:35.120 --> 18:41.400]  it back in print available now at InfowarsStore.com, selling them as low as $3.95 apiece, we have
[18:41.400 --> 18:45.360]  them in bulk and there's a zero country code, so anywhere on the planet you can make copies,

[18:51.680 --> 18:55.680]  in game blueprint for global enslavement, available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[18:55.680 --> 19:02.720]  Again, I don't like to lecture people, I'm a very private person, but because of the
[19:02.720 --> 19:06.720]  globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public
[19:06.720 --> 19:11.960]  figure and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God,
[19:11.960 --> 19:15.440]  and I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me
[19:15.440 --> 19:19.320]  a break, the statinism's out in the open, I've always been a Christian, but now the
[19:19.320 --> 19:23.160]  fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear, and I get it, a lot of you've
[19:23.160 --> 19:27.880]  been turned off by big churches, a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest
[19:27.880 --> 19:32.720]  class system, and I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship
[19:32.720 --> 19:39.080]  with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential, and God created
[19:39.080 --> 19:43.440]  the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life, and so that's
[19:43.440 --> 19:47.120]  what Infowars is really all about, so thank you all for your word of mouth, thank you
[19:47.120 --> 19:50.480]  for spreading the word about Infowars, and thank you for supporting us to keep us on
[19:50.480 --> 19:55.000]  air by visiting infowarsstore.com, because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases,
[19:55.000 --> 20:21.280]  we'll be taking off here, so thank you for the support, Infowarsstore.com.
[20:21.280 --> 20:29.160]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report, if you are receiving this transmission,
[20:29.160 --> 20:30.160]  you are the resistance.
[20:30.160 --> 20:39.800]  All right, the globalists are going to depopulate the planet, they've got a point that obviously
[20:39.800 --> 20:43.240]  some areas are overpopulated, but they've been suppressing good technologies, they've
[20:43.240 --> 20:46.360]  been suppressing industrialization in the third world where people would stop having
[20:46.360 --> 20:50.480]  this being children, and instead they're just mitigating things by dumping toxic waste in
[20:50.480 --> 20:55.040]  the third world and by paying people to be sterilized or forcibly sterilizing them, or
[20:55.040 --> 20:58.440]  having governments forcibly sterilize them for money, and now they're moving this to
[20:58.440 --> 20:59.440]  the first world.
[20:59.440 --> 21:04.560]  But what is my big counter to John Oliver saying that I'm a complete liar and that no
[21:04.560 --> 21:09.600]  one has died from the vaccines, which aren't vaccines, and that there's no human cells
[21:09.600 --> 21:14.480]  in it, no, no fetal cells in it, well, I mean, I have all the mainline documents I'll show
[21:14.480 --> 21:20.560]  you here on air, and that's why they try to censor us so that he can get five, 10 million
[21:20.560 --> 21:26.560]  views for each show on YouTube and air it over and over again on HBO and gas like the
[21:26.560 --> 21:28.280]  public.
[21:28.280 --> 21:34.520]  But here's something before I get to that that totally destroys it, several big things.
[21:34.520 --> 21:39.720]  I'm going to show you mainstream articles that China refused the mRNA vaccine and said
[21:39.720 --> 21:42.080]  it's untested and could be dangerous.
[21:42.080 --> 21:45.440]  They are the wild, wild West in China.
[21:45.440 --> 21:48.520]  Thirty years ago, they had cows that produced human milk.
[21:48.520 --> 21:55.080]  Thirty years ago, 35 years ago, they had spiders that were part goat that produced body armor.
[21:55.080 --> 22:00.120]  I mean, we're already in basically the year 2070.
[22:00.120 --> 22:04.160]  They're 50 years ahead, ladies and gentlemen, in their own words.
[22:04.160 --> 22:11.080]  So that's why they're so arrogant to all of us, because this is the island of Dr. Maru.
[22:11.080 --> 22:12.560]  We're in the future now.
[22:12.560 --> 22:13.560]  The future's here.
[22:13.560 --> 22:14.560]  It's just not evenly distributed.
[22:14.560 --> 22:20.760]  And people like John Oliver and all these so-called comics that are really just propagandist,
[22:20.760 --> 22:25.200]  comics pretending to be newsmen, pretending to be non-biased when they're just frauds
[22:25.200 --> 22:27.800]  reading off a teleprompter.
[22:27.800 --> 22:30.080]  And they're lying to you knowingly.
[22:30.080 --> 22:35.680]  But China doesn't accept the mRNA vaccines, Pfizer's and Moderna.
[22:35.680 --> 22:36.680]  India banned it.
[22:36.680 --> 22:42.240]  I'll show you the articles, but he looks up to the teleprompter and the camera with a
[22:42.240 --> 22:51.480]  straight face and tells you that we're insane, and we're crazy, and we're baboons, and we're
[22:51.480 --> 22:55.400]  neon footballs, and we spray feces on people.
[22:55.400 --> 23:03.080]  And all this childish crap overhead shop police, when I could show you right now, John Oliver,
[23:03.080 --> 23:06.120]  who we know just reads off a teleprompter, he's a mercenary.
[23:06.120 --> 23:11.040]  Why India's expert panel rejected Pfizer's plea for emergency use, COVID vaccine.
[23:11.040 --> 23:14.680]  That was months ago they banned it.
[23:14.680 --> 23:17.800]  Pfizer withdraws emergency application for use of its COVID vaccine in India because
[23:17.800 --> 23:19.800]  it was refused.
[23:19.800 --> 23:25.200]  BBC, COVID, what we know about China's coronavirus vaccines, it goes on.
[23:25.200 --> 23:30.520]  BBC, they've not approved it, and instead they have an attenuated COVID-19 virus, a
[23:30.520 --> 23:32.520]  classic vaccine.
[23:32.520 --> 23:35.920]  Oh, BBC, John Oliver.
[23:35.920 --> 23:36.920]  Americans are dumb.
[23:36.920 --> 23:37.920]  Americans are stupid.
[23:37.920 --> 23:43.280]  Americans listen to Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson, and all these doctors, the Bill and
[23:43.280 --> 23:47.480]  Melinda Gates Foundation, the spokesperson said he needed to be arrested.
[23:47.480 --> 23:51.320]  The Pentagon and the CIA need to shut us down as terrorists.
[23:51.320 --> 23:52.520]  I'm going to show you the quotes.
[23:52.520 --> 23:54.320]  They call us terrorists.
[23:54.320 --> 24:05.160]  Biden, the so-called joint session of Congress last week, the State of the Union, said, said,
[24:05.160 --> 24:06.160]  you oppose our agenda.
[24:06.160 --> 24:08.320]  We're going to call you terrorists that use the Pentagon on you.
[24:08.320 --> 24:11.200]  Well, go ahead and use your woke Pentagon on me.
[24:11.200 --> 24:14.200]  All the dudes wearing their red high heels, really, they're getting rid of the military.
[24:14.200 --> 24:16.720]  It's coming with drones.
[24:16.720 --> 24:18.680]  The Air Force is going to have habit security force.
[24:18.680 --> 24:21.000]  By next year, we'll be robot.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  Wow.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.200]  The Marines are downsizing humans and going with robots associated with press last week.
[24:27.200 --> 24:28.920]  It's here.
[24:28.920 --> 24:29.920]  It's here.
[24:29.920 --> 24:32.400]  We're already in the year 2070.
[24:32.400 --> 24:34.760]  We're not in 2021.
[24:34.760 --> 24:40.000]  They've been waiting, and now the rollout begins, the end of humanity, the war cutting
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.120]  you off, making you obsolete, and they're like, oh, follow our orders.
[24:44.120 --> 24:45.920]  We'll let you have your business open.
[24:45.920 --> 24:46.920]  Follow your orders.
[24:46.920 --> 24:48.520]  We'll give you your universal income.
[24:48.520 --> 24:52.480]  I'm going to explain that coming up last segment of this hour.
[24:52.480 --> 24:56.680]  What do you think happens when people stop working but they keep printing money?
[24:56.680 --> 25:00.680]  Shortage is we run out of things and it's already here and it's already caused in a
[25:00.680 --> 25:05.840]  just-in-time delivery system a chain reaction that is going to bring the world down.
[25:05.840 --> 25:09.520]  Food prices are already 76% more as of last week.
[25:09.520 --> 25:12.560]  Bloomberg Global Agri-Index is very accurate.
[25:12.560 --> 25:17.520]  A global index of food price increases at the farm market purchase, where they've already
[25:17.520 --> 25:21.560]  bought the crops that are growing now that by the end of the summer, four months from
[25:21.560 --> 25:26.480]  now, five months from now, 76% global food increase.
[25:26.480 --> 25:29.960]  That's called science and facts, John Oliver and your teleprompter.
[25:29.960 --> 25:32.000]  See, there's no teleprompter here.
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.560]  I'm a real person.
[25:33.560 --> 25:37.080]  I'm my own man, son.
[25:37.080 --> 25:40.800]  Oh, here's chop.edu.
[25:40.800 --> 25:45.440]  One of the main university databases.
[25:45.440 --> 25:47.720]  Vaccine ingredient, fetal cells.
[25:47.720 --> 25:53.200]  And it breaks down the cell line history and almost vaccines, including mRNA, are based
[25:53.200 --> 25:55.400]  on fetal cell lines.
[25:55.400 --> 25:58.160]  Oh, but John Oliver, he's a comedian.
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.400]  He said none of this exists, and we all need to be shut down and say it.
[26:02.400 --> 26:06.760]  Historical vaccine safety concerns, CDC, they've got a nice little thing saying they still
[26:06.760 --> 26:08.520]  think the benefits outweigh the harm.
[26:08.520 --> 26:14.000]  But then it tells you about getting cancer in your polio shot, giving people polio with
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  the polio vaccine.
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.680]  They give much lower numbers what happened.
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.120]  My grandmother was told the polio vaccine gave her polio in this very event.
[26:21.120 --> 26:28.720]  The cutter incident in 1955, when my mommy was five years old, that's when her mommy
[26:28.720 --> 26:32.720]  got it and was in tortured pain until she died three years ago at 92.
[26:32.720 --> 26:37.400]  Oh, that's just page after page of all the big incidents and all the deaths from all
[26:37.400 --> 26:40.240]  the different incidences right up until recently.
[26:40.240 --> 26:42.840]  Oh, but no one ever got hurt.
[26:42.840 --> 26:45.720]  No one ever had a problem.
[26:45.720 --> 26:48.800]  And don't worry, John Oliver, people like my grandmother will never do anything to you
[26:48.800 --> 26:52.720]  for what you've done with Bill Gates and the future crimes you're now helping commit, because
[26:52.720 --> 26:54.320]  she's such a big Christian.
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.800]  She said when she was really old, she said, I forgive them, they didn't mean it, and it's
[26:59.800 --> 27:00.800]  okay.
[27:00.800 --> 27:01.800]  Jesus forgives them.
[27:01.800 --> 27:06.800]  She was in a wheelchair in tortured pain her whole life, ate almost all the nerves and
[27:06.800 --> 27:07.800]  muscles.
[27:07.800 --> 27:17.000]  But that's okay because Tim Cook runs death camps in China, it's liberal, good.
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.280]  So yeah, you know, she was in an iron lung for a while too, but that's the fun part.
[27:21.280 --> 27:25.120]  And sock later bragged that there were too many people and he did it on purpose as a
[27:25.120 --> 27:26.120]  test.
[27:26.120 --> 27:27.120]  How liberal.
[27:27.120 --> 27:32.080]  Oh, I'm sorry, John Oliver, how's your soul feeling?
[27:32.080 --> 27:40.120]  What if Melinda Gates left him because she knows that who's the big company?
[27:40.120 --> 27:44.520]  Merck three months ago pulled out of the vaccine program saying it's dangerous, it attacks
[27:44.520 --> 27:49.800]  proteins in the body, it causes autoimmune response and allergic responses and it won't
[27:49.800 --> 27:51.880]  protect you and the vaccine won't work.
[27:51.880 --> 27:55.360]  Oh, you didn't know you were supposed to get a vaccine every two months now they announced
[27:55.360 --> 27:57.760]  because it doesn't work, but it does work.
[27:57.760 --> 28:02.440]  They've announced CBS News, the next vaccines that are all ready for you.
[28:02.440 --> 28:07.800]  Even John Oliver said, oh, people are worried that he's remained so fast, they've had this
[28:07.800 --> 28:09.400]  ready for a decade.
[28:09.400 --> 28:10.880]  Exactly, John.
[28:10.880 --> 28:15.960]  That's why they skipped the animal human studies because it killed so many animals in the original
[28:15.960 --> 28:17.120]  studies under other names.
[28:17.120 --> 28:18.120]  Yes, we know.
[28:18.120 --> 28:22.640]  We know it's been tested to be particularly deadly, but it kills ferrets in six months.
[28:22.640 --> 28:28.200]  That means it kills humans in about five to ten years if the models follow.
[28:28.200 --> 28:31.060]  And we'll all just sit back and watch it, won't we, John, because I've got a big stack
[28:31.060 --> 28:36.400]  of people dying from the vaccine, but oh, oh, we're all cooks, but China won't take
[28:36.400 --> 28:38.200]  it and India won't take it.
[28:38.200 --> 28:41.600]  The AstraZeneca has been banned for 21 countries, but we're all just crazy.
[28:41.600 --> 28:44.880]  And the Pentagon and the CIA needs to come kill us at our houses.
[28:44.880 --> 28:46.880]  Oh, I'm so scared.
[28:46.880 --> 28:49.680]  Oh my gosh, you might kill me.
[28:49.680 --> 28:52.160]  You're going to kill everybody anyways.
[28:52.160 --> 28:54.680]  And so we will meet you.
[28:54.680 --> 28:55.680]  Yes.
[28:55.680 --> 28:57.680]  He will pay.
[28:57.680 --> 29:00.160]  The world is awakening.
[29:00.160 --> 29:03.680]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[29:03.680 --> 29:09.040]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[29:09.040 --> 29:15.000]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome.
[29:15.000 --> 29:20.400]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come
[29:20.400 --> 29:24.760]  out of the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[29:24.760 --> 29:27.920]  We have forced them out in the open.
[29:27.920 --> 29:31.800]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen.
[29:31.800 --> 29:33.760]  Guys, humanity is winning.
[29:33.760 --> 29:38.880]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[29:38.880 --> 29:40.320]  That is invincible.
[29:40.320 --> 29:43.600]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[29:43.600 --> 29:48.480]  So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action
[29:48.480 --> 29:52.440]  against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew
[29:52.440 --> 29:53.440]  to you.
[29:53.440 --> 29:58.720]  We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[29:58.720 --> 30:02.320]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and
[30:02.320 --> 30:05.360]  I say thank you for what you've done.
[30:05.360 --> 30:07.240]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[30:07.240 --> 30:10.920]  Thank you for praying for us and thank you for spreading the word.
[30:10.920 --> 30:16.680]  If all of you will simply go to infowarsstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or
[30:16.680 --> 30:21.320]  a droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.

[30:25.720 --> 30:27.360]  you go and what you do.
[30:27.360 --> 30:31.120]  Not because you've done something wrong but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the
[30:31.120 --> 30:34.800]  globalist are predatory and are evil, and in the surveillance state we need to more
[30:34.800 --> 30:39.280]  and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved
[30:39.280 --> 30:40.280]  in.
[30:40.280 --> 30:42.280]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.

[30:58.880 --> 31:04.520]  This entire new world order system is about making you dependent, making you obsolete,
[31:04.520 --> 31:07.560]  making you a domesticated animal they control.
[31:07.560 --> 31:10.840]  They want to censor you, they want to dump you down, they want to poison you, and they
[31:10.840 --> 31:14.960]  want to control your ability to take care of yourself.
[31:14.960 --> 31:19.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund the InfoWars more than ever and you can do
[31:19.960 --> 31:24.680]  it while at the same time protecting yourself and your family and your neighbors.

[31:58.880 --> 32:02.440]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[32:02.440 --> 32:06.480]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity, with all the terrible
[32:06.480 --> 32:10.640]  things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening
[32:10.640 --> 32:11.640]  as well.
[32:11.640 --> 32:15.840]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things that the Republic doesn't get to see and let
[32:15.840 --> 32:21.440]  me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood
[32:21.440 --> 32:27.360]  or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[32:27.360 --> 32:32.320]  They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[32:32.320 --> 32:34.880]  Well, that's where infowars comes in.
[32:34.880 --> 32:39.240]  You fund us, you support infowarsstore.com, you get great products at the same time.
[32:39.240 --> 32:44.200]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will target
[32:44.200 --> 32:49.040]  you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[32:49.040 --> 32:54.360]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can meet
[32:54.360 --> 32:56.880]  the shock groups in the information war.
[32:56.880 --> 33:02.000]  Fund us at infowarsstore.com.
[33:02.000 --> 33:14.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:14.880 --> 33:43.600]  Hollywood is burning down, the New World Order is falling.
[33:43.600 --> 33:50.320]  Right as they build it, and right as they complete it, it begins collapsing.
[33:50.320 --> 33:57.120]  The second they slap that last brick in place up there at that capstone with that stupid
[33:57.120 --> 34:06.840]  pyramid cap, all right, I got in here this morning, and I already did a ton of research
[34:06.840 --> 34:10.040]  last night in a bunch this morning, and then they brought me a whole new stack of mainstream
[34:10.040 --> 34:11.040]  media.
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.080]  We're going to put patches in you, the track you, we're going to make you take pills that
[34:16.080 --> 34:20.400]  track you, the troops are going to get chips out of their skin, I mean, it's all over
[34:20.400 --> 34:21.400]  the news.
[34:21.400 --> 34:24.600]  They are just, we knew they were going to roll it out, and here it is.
[34:24.600 --> 34:28.480]  And remember a year ago, oh, nobody wants to do that, we're like, here's MIT, here's
[34:28.480 --> 34:34.200]  Bill and Melinda Gates, they got it ready, they're like, that's just preposterous, we're
[34:34.200 --> 34:39.640]  not planning any of that, that doesn't even exist.
[34:39.640 --> 34:46.920]  And then I've got this article, in fact, let's post this full thing at infowars.com and
[34:46.920 --> 34:50.640]  the live show feed, post this with the headline under the live show feed today, can we put
[34:50.640 --> 34:53.320]  the live show feed on screen please, thanks.
[34:53.320 --> 34:59.000]  I'm going to add this article from Merkola.com, why I am removing all articles related to
[34:59.000 --> 35:06.800]  vitamin D, C, zinc and COVID-19, and you know, I knew that this report had been put out,
[35:06.800 --> 35:16.200]  any disinformation doesn't, why platforms must act on 12 leading online anti-vaxxers.
[35:16.200 --> 35:24.360]  But I hadn't read the report, and holy Toledo, they've got 20 state attorney generals with
[35:24.360 --> 35:27.240]  them, they've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and they've got this spokesman
[35:27.240 --> 35:39.080]  in there, and he says, use the Pentagon and CIA against the terrorists, and anti extremism,
[35:39.080 --> 35:47.960]  and it goes on to say, remove the platforms, take them off the air, and dismantle them,
[35:47.960 --> 35:54.960]  disrupt them, these are all terms being killed, and it gets even worse down here.
[35:54.960 --> 36:03.760]  With counter messaging, the global health community, cyber security, law enforcement,
[36:03.760 --> 36:11.160]  international institutions, with a task force of experts to tackle complex global threats
[36:11.160 --> 36:20.320]  such as terrorism, cyber attacks and nuclear armaments, and advancing immunization requirement
[36:20.320 --> 36:27.280]  for counter offensive.
[36:27.280 --> 36:34.640]  And then, of course, I have probably 15 articles just out today that dovetail with this, but
[36:34.640 --> 36:38.560]  really it's all a cover for the total economic takeover, and then the tracking, the controlling
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.760]  you, and then the poisoning you, you're like, oh, they just want us to have $1200 a month
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.240]  and live in a 200 square foot apartment now and not have kids, and we get $1200 and we
[36:47.240 --> 36:53.520]  don't get a car, I get to go anywhere, but hey, I like that, that's nice, I get a smartphone.
[36:53.520 --> 36:56.720]  You don't know they already plan to kill you once they get you hurt into those compact
[36:56.720 --> 36:57.720]  cities?
[36:57.720 --> 37:04.080]  And that's the plan, they want you off the land, they want the economy shut down before
[37:04.080 --> 37:05.880]  they kill you.
[37:05.880 --> 37:11.640]  I mean, you understand that already an additional 10 million people last time I got numbers
[37:11.640 --> 37:15.320]  have starved to death under the lockdown, so instead of 15 million starved to death,
[37:15.320 --> 37:19.720]  the average every year is 25 plus million, and it's growing, and then they show you all
[37:19.720 --> 37:23.360]  the piles of dead bodies and go, look, COVID killed them, they're all those skinny, troubled
[37:23.360 --> 37:27.960]  up people in Africa and India, and it's in the local Indian news, they go, our people
[37:27.960 --> 37:33.160]  are not dying of COVID, almost all of them are dying from the flu and colds from malnutrition.
[37:33.160 --> 37:40.920]  They're lacking basic nutrition, you know, vitamins and minerals, which Dr. Merkola,
[37:40.920 --> 37:44.360]  when the 20 attorney generals called for his arrest, he said, well, I'll just, I'm willing
[37:44.360 --> 37:46.600]  to fight this, I believe juries will find me not guilty.
[37:46.600 --> 37:50.200]  I mean, you do have that vitamin C DMZ, but now whatever they did to him, he said, was
[37:50.200 --> 37:52.440]  paramilitary and threatened his family.
[37:52.440 --> 37:57.920]  And so he said, I'm not a military person, and we don't have a country or an FBI, and
[37:57.920 --> 38:02.320]  you're all, you know, I'll keep the sights up for now, but they've threatened to kill
[38:02.320 --> 38:04.040]  my family if I don't take it down.
[38:04.040 --> 38:06.160]  And the same thing happened to Dr. Groot.
[38:06.160 --> 38:11.200]  They were outside his office and his house, and threatened to kill him and his family,
[38:11.200 --> 38:17.520]  and they also tracked their family and called up the family and said, hey, we're watching
[38:17.520 --> 38:20.520]  your, you know, we're watching your kids in the backyard.
[38:20.520 --> 38:23.000]  And you know, they went and checked exactly what they said, what they were doing.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.120]  I got those calls before, oh, your little dogs out in the backyard, you know, little
[38:26.120 --> 38:28.960]  yellow, and yeah, it was out there, guess what I have to do with your dog, we're going
[38:28.960 --> 38:30.960]  to kill that dog, we're going to kill you too.
[38:30.960 --> 38:33.800]  I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, oh, I'm so scared.
[38:33.800 --> 38:39.280]  You will face the judgment, your thugs, your trash.
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.560]  And you've taken the weakness of a lot of the population as an excuse to overrun everybody,
[38:44.560 --> 38:47.040]  but it doesn't work on everybody.
[38:47.040 --> 38:54.120]  But I got to tell you, this country is in deep trouble, the whole world's in deep trouble.
[38:54.120 --> 38:58.320]  Deep, deep trouble, and all the sycophantic week leftists have signed onto this, thinking
[38:58.320 --> 39:00.360]  they're part of the winning team.
[39:00.360 --> 39:01.360]  Wow.
[39:01.360 --> 39:04.280]  Let's go ahead and get started with John Oliver.
[39:04.280 --> 39:15.320]  There's a bunch of these clips, but here is John Oliver openly coming out and saying it's
[39:15.320 --> 39:21.080]  preposterous that anybody wants to put microchips in you to track that you've had the vaccine,
[39:21.080 --> 39:23.240]  which is, again, in front of a bill in one of the gates.
[39:23.240 --> 39:28.000]  And here's the head of Rice University and the head of MIT Science Division telling you
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.720]  that and then actual 60 men are talking about it.
[39:30.720 --> 39:33.280]  So here's John Oliver lying to you and your family.
[39:33.280 --> 39:37.320]  I know my husband is not vaccinating people and putting a microchip in her arm, because
[39:37.320 --> 39:43.280]  that technology doesn't even exist, and he's never uttered the words out of his mouth.
[39:43.280 --> 39:44.280]  Okay.
[39:44.280 --> 39:50.840]  That wasn't the reassuring pushback to a bad conspiracy theory that I had hoped for, to
[39:50.840 --> 39:51.840]  be honest.
[39:51.840 --> 39:56.600]  We're not microchipping people because the technology doesn't exist yet, and my husband
[39:56.600 --> 39:58.520]  hasn't said it out loud to me.
[39:58.520 --> 40:00.760]  Why would you put it like that?
[40:00.760 --> 40:05.880]  Although vaccines and identity may seem unrelated, Bill Gates has spent the last few years funding
[40:05.880 --> 40:09.280]  research that can bring the two ideas together.
[40:09.280 --> 40:14.200]  Late last year, Gates once again turned to Robert Langer and his MIT colleagues to investigate
[40:14.200 --> 40:19.840]  new ways to permanently store and record the vaccination information of each individual.
[40:19.840 --> 40:23.760]  The result of their research was a new vaccine delivery method.
[40:23.760 --> 40:28.720]  They found that by using dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near-infrared light
[40:28.720 --> 40:33.200]  emitting microparticles to the skin, they could create particle patterns in the skin
[40:33.200 --> 40:38.160]  of vaccine recipients which are invisible to the eye but can be imaged using modified
[40:38.160 --> 40:39.960]  smartphones.
[40:39.960 --> 40:45.160]  Rice University describes the quantum dot tags left behind by the microneedles as something
[40:45.160 --> 40:48.400]  like a barcode tattoo.
[40:48.400 --> 40:50.960]  So who was behind this development?
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.960]  As lead researcher Kevin McHugh explains, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation came
[40:55.960 --> 41:02.020]  to us and said, hey, we have a real problem, knowing who's vaccinated.
[41:02.020 --> 41:05.280]  So our idea was to put the record on the person.
[41:05.280 --> 41:10.240]  This way, later on, people can scan over the area to see what vaccines have been administered
[41:10.240 --> 41:13.440]  and give only the ones still needed.
[41:13.440 --> 41:17.280]  The microparticles that form the fluorescent quantum dot tags are delivered along with
[41:17.280 --> 41:21.440]  a vaccine, but they cannot be delivered by a traditional syringe.
[41:21.440 --> 41:26.400]  Instead, they must be delivered by a patch of microneedles made from a mixture of dissolvable
[41:26.400 --> 41:32.360]  sugar and a polymer called PVA, as well as the quantum dot dye in the vaccine.
[41:32.360 --> 41:37.480]  It should be no surprise then that big pharma vaccine manufacturers, in their scramble to
[41:37.480 --> 41:43.320]  produce the coronavirus vaccine that Gates assures us is necessary to go back to normal,
[41:43.320 --> 41:49.240]  have turned to a novel vaccine delivery method, a dissolvable microneedle array patch.
[41:49.240 --> 41:57.640]  What if everyone on board had their health monitored with this sub-dermal implant, now
[41:57.640 --> 41:59.960]  in late-stage testing?
[41:59.960 --> 42:05.640]  It's not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue like
[42:05.640 --> 42:09.680]  gel engineered to continuously test your blood.
[42:09.680 --> 42:12.840]  It's a sensor, this tiny green thing in there.
[42:12.840 --> 42:17.640]  That tiny green thing in there, you put it underneath your skin, and what that tells
[42:17.640 --> 42:22.680]  you is that there are chemical reactions going on inside the body.
[42:22.680 --> 42:27.560]  And now CBS News is announcing, oh, the new booster shots are a patch with little glass
[42:27.560 --> 42:29.080]  needles so we know you've been vaccinated.
[42:29.080 --> 42:34.560]  It can tell it's not easy, oh, a year ago it didn't exist, but now it's all been announced.
[42:34.560 --> 42:38.920]  It's all in your face, but John Oliver has all the smart liberals watching him while he's
[42:38.920 --> 42:42.840]  got a foreign accent, which means he's really smart, and they listen and learn how dumb
[42:42.840 --> 42:43.880]  everybody is.
[42:43.880 --> 42:47.760]  Such China and India won't take the mRNA vaccines, and they're getting banned over the world
[42:47.760 --> 42:51.920]  and killing people, but it's OK because John Oliver called Americans dumb, and the liberals
[42:51.920 --> 42:55.520]  like to hear how Americans are dumb because they're anti-American, so now they'll go get
[42:55.520 --> 42:57.960]  their patches and shots right now.
[42:57.960 --> 43:00.480]  CNN has almost no viewers.
[43:00.480 --> 43:05.560]  The ADL is reviled and hated across the United States and the world as a pack of anti-free
[43:05.560 --> 43:09.600]  speech liars, but that doesn't mean that they don't have power, just like the Southern
[43:09.600 --> 43:14.000]  Property Law Center that's just as bad. They represent the globalist, the big power structure
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.680]  that wants authoritarianism and backs common as China and its death camps, and they back
[43:18.680 --> 43:23.280]  bringing those similar systems here to America, and they've even officially called the ADL
[43:23.280 --> 43:28.920]  for my arrest for my speech and for Mark Zuckerberg to be arrested for free speech as well.
[43:28.920 --> 43:30.800]  These are very, very dangerous times.
[43:30.800 --> 43:32.320]  They don't want us to be on air.
[43:32.320 --> 43:34.040]  You funding our operation is critical.
[43:34.040 --> 43:38.960]  You make it easy at infowarstore.com with amazing products like water filtration, air
[43:38.960 --> 43:43.880]  filtration, non-GMA heirloom seats, t-shirts, books, films, and now, former best-selling
[43:43.880 --> 43:48.960]  products sold out for months, back in stock, bodies ultimate turmeric formula, vaso-beach,
[43:48.960 --> 43:53.280]  prostagard, alpha power and more, back in stock, and it keeps us on air despite what
[43:53.280 --> 43:55.440]  the tyrants want.
[43:55.440 --> 44:02.680]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses,
[44:02.680 --> 44:07.480]  the third world dies. We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving
[44:07.480 --> 44:13.600]  parts that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate
[44:13.600 --> 44:15.880]  the third world and really hurt the first world.
[44:15.880 --> 44:20.280]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States, and that's because
[44:20.280 --> 44:24.240]  the companies and the systems and the drivers that could barely get the job done before
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.560]  delivering gas had been shut down. Plus, the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down, along
[44:28.560 --> 44:33.240]  with other pipelines. The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[44:33.240 --> 44:36.320]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[44:36.320 --> 44:40.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave. The third world is imploding as well.
[44:40.760 --> 44:44.600]  The borders have been removed. Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover,
[44:44.600 --> 44:49.360]  Gregory said, you have no hope. They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of
[44:49.360 --> 44:54.200]  the gas needed this summer. So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another
[44:54.200 --> 44:58.720]  and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[44:58.720 --> 45:03.520]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[45:03.520 --> 45:09.640]  from beta testing to operational. The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation
[45:09.640 --> 45:13.880]  takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news is we've been working and you've been
[45:13.880 --> 45:18.200]  working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[45:18.200 --> 45:22.920]  to be able to find it on. Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the
[45:22.920 --> 45:27.160]  attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance,
[45:27.160 --> 45:31.560]  we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is
[45:31.560 --> 45:36.280]  essential, and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting
[45:36.280 --> 45:40.440]  InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're
[45:40.440 --> 45:46.600]  great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation. InfoWarsStore.com.
[45:46.600 --> 45:50.840]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because
[45:50.840 --> 45:55.040]  the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasovets and others. So get them today
[45:55.040 --> 45:58.760]  at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the Resistance.
[45:58.760 --> 46:05.080]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been Alec Jones was
[46:05.080 --> 46:11.560]  right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[46:11.560 --> 46:15.960]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger. But let me tell you, we are Tomorrow's
[46:15.960 --> 46:20.280]  News today, and thanks for your support. We're still on air at InfoWars.com and Band-Aug.
[46:20.280 --> 46:24.120]  Video radio stations and TV stations across the country. And our film Endgame, censored
[46:24.120 --> 46:29.080]  and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years ago, is now available again.
[46:29.080 --> 46:34.120]  We have repredited a high quality DVD in HD. It has a zero country code. Anyone in the world
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.040]  is authorized to make copies of it, and I'm asking you to get the original, make copies,
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.800]  give it to everyone you know, air it on local access TV, give it to your pastors, your police
[46:41.800 --> 46:45.560]  chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever you do, warn the world. This film
[46:45.560 --> 46:50.520]  uses their own documents and own statements 14 years ago to expose them. It's more important
[46:50.520 --> 46:55.880]  than ever, available at infowarsstore.com. That's infowarsstore.com. Endgame, blueprint for global
[46:55.880 --> 47:21.240]  enlightenment. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:25.880 --> 47:37.720]  That's right. I'm going to see you. I'm going to up the ante. So Melinda Gates, she is
[47:37.720 --> 47:42.600]  punching out. She is leaving, and Bill has hired the former right-hand man of his buddy,
[47:42.600 --> 47:46.760]  the other global issue genesis Warren Buffett's chief lawyer, to battle her. This is a very
[47:46.760 --> 47:51.800]  real divorce. And the word is, she didn't know about him staying with Jeffrey Epstein
[47:51.800 --> 48:01.000]  all those times in Paris and at little pervert island, little St. John's on the Lita Express,
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.800]  or that he stayed so many months over the years at the seven-story pervert palace in New York City.
[48:08.680 --> 48:14.840]  And so I've known for a while that old Bill Gates is fully and totally compromised by these
[48:14.840 --> 48:19.640]  groups, but he was paying Epstein to compromise scientists to get them on board so he could
[48:19.640 --> 48:27.000]  blackmail them and control them. So this is all a case of the Spiders having a convention.
[48:27.720 --> 48:34.920]  Certainly, if anybody was the fly, it would be Epstein who was more like a maiter D or a concierge
[48:35.640 --> 48:43.080]  or a butler who was there setting all this up for British royalty and all the rest of the
[48:43.080 --> 48:51.400]  degenerate trash. So that's what we face. That's what's unfolding. And that's why they are quote
[48:51.400 --> 48:58.040]  splitting up from all the intel we have. Meanwhile, patients stricken by vaccine blood clots seek
[48:58.040 --> 49:03.960]  payout from government fund. And I know people who've had family that took the vaccine and died
[49:03.960 --> 49:09.320]  a week later of a blood clot, but they're not saying it's the vaccine. Come on. Don't be rude
[49:09.320 --> 49:14.760]  about it, Alex. Come on. I don't want to hear it. Yeah, my dad took the vaccine and died, but
[49:14.760 --> 49:18.840]  I don't want to hear it, Alex. I don't want to hear it. Give us privacy. That's right, because
[49:18.840 --> 49:24.440]  once you kill your family or once you go along with it, we don't take responsibility for ourselves
[49:24.440 --> 49:27.960]  nowadays. We don't admit when we've been conned or wrong. That's why we get in more and more trouble.
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.240]  And so they're like, Oh, well, no one's officially ever said anybody died from COVID because none
[49:33.240 --> 49:37.640]  of the medical system will do it. But actually, they have had doctors in many cases say we believe
[49:37.640 --> 49:41.960]  the vaccine killed them. They do an autopsy and they say, well, they had a big hemorrhage in the
[49:41.960 --> 49:48.760]  brain, a blood clot, probably the vaccine. Everybody's scared of the media. It's beyond
[49:48.760 --> 49:55.960]  anecdotal, ladies and gentlemen, is a major shock Institute report admitting that it's the protein
[49:55.960 --> 50:00.280]  of the virus itself that's causing problems. And when the body attacks that, when your body learns
[50:00.280 --> 50:07.640]  to attack that protein, that protein is all over the body in fast growing cells like the uterus.
[50:07.640 --> 50:12.920]  There's also proteins in the brain and in the heart and it attacks it. So that's what's going on.
[50:12.920 --> 50:20.680]  And that's what top scientists warned would happen. But they get censored when it said this is all
[50:20.680 --> 50:26.360]  about big money. Here is the live show feed today that has Dr. McCullis full article where he quotes
[50:26.360 --> 50:31.720]  Bill and Bill Gates funded groups, their spokesperson's calling for the military and CIA
[50:32.600 --> 50:39.640]  to silence him and 11 others. Emergency Tuesday broadcast Bill Gates foundation calls for CIA,
[50:39.640 --> 50:47.880]  US military to silence anti-vaxxers. Because we're going to cause death by not taking our shot
[50:47.880 --> 50:51.240]  because it won't work if we don't all take it. Really, I thought you're protected if you take it.
[50:51.240 --> 50:56.840]  But why is it Russia accepting our vaccine? Why is it China? Why is it India? Well, because
[50:57.480 --> 51:02.040]  they, everybody knows America and Europe's targeted for termination. So does Australia.
[51:02.040 --> 51:06.840]  We get the poison shots. So does Africa. So does Latin America. Other people are like,
[51:06.840 --> 51:11.720]  are you kidding us? Experimental stuff. We're not violating the Nuremberg code on illegal
[51:11.720 --> 51:19.400]  experimentation. That's for you. And John Oliver is going to lecture us on stupid Americans.
[51:19.400 --> 51:26.280]  Oh, look at this little headline. WHO calls for another 45 billion to vaccinate most adults
[51:26.280 --> 51:32.040]  across the globe and WN standardized global passport that tracks everywhere you go. Now
[51:32.040 --> 51:36.600]  the UN controls your medical records. That's not a problem. I mean, look, John Oliver is an
[51:36.600 --> 51:43.720]  intellectual. Oh my gosh, he's so smart. He talks down to us. Oh my gosh, we're such cooks. I mean,
[51:43.720 --> 51:48.680]  India banned it. And they're idiots too. And you know, the Chinese won't take the government
[51:48.680 --> 51:53.400]  ban the mRNA Pfizer and Moderna. But again, just you'll never see that unless you're tuned into
[51:53.400 --> 51:57.800]  info wars because because you make sure, you know, the big tech makes sure everybody's completely
[51:58.680 --> 52:03.720]  and totally centered. And again, here's the federal government's own website, the EDU vaccine
[52:03.720 --> 52:10.040]  ingredients, fetal cells, it's all there. But you know, he said that nobody there's not fetal cells
[52:10.040 --> 52:16.600]  any of it. That's a lie. Nobody ever got sick. Nobody ever died. Nothing ever happened. Get
[52:16.600 --> 52:21.640]  vaccinated says the beetle creature that he literally trotted out there. And then he hides
[52:21.640 --> 52:28.680]  behind. Oh, I'm just a comedian. Let's go ahead and play the next John Oliver clip from yesterday.
[52:28.680 --> 52:35.160]  Here it is. I'd all seen online is the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the first authorized to use
[52:35.160 --> 52:44.760]  messenger RNA, which is true. But that has given rise to speculation. Authorized approved. No,
[52:44.760 --> 52:49.640]  they skipped the approval process and did live testing on the general population and had huge
[52:49.640 --> 52:54.360]  problems. The British, when they started doing it six months ago, paused it and said nobody above
[52:54.360 --> 53:00.600]  75, nobody under 16, nobody pregnant. Because it killed so many damn people, you little monster.
[53:01.640 --> 53:04.120]  It's banned in a bunch of countries, you little monster.
[53:05.640 --> 53:09.160]  And just because you're reading all the teleprompter doesn't mean you not
[53:09.160 --> 53:13.240]  are aware of what you're doing. This is on you. You are aiding and abetting
[53:13.240 --> 53:18.120]  Joseph Mengele level illegal testing. And now every channel says they want to bully us
[53:18.120 --> 53:24.200]  in to submission to take it to have a job to get on in a car to get on a plane to go to the
[53:24.200 --> 53:28.680]  grocery store. They go, we all made you wear masks. Now we want to make you take the shot.
[53:29.400 --> 53:34.680]  Oh, and the new shots they're announcing are micro glass on a patch that goes into your body
[53:34.680 --> 53:40.440]  and tracks you. And suddenly, oh, yeah, the army's going to get chips under their skin to track them.
[53:40.440 --> 53:43.560]  But it's no big deal. It tracks you, but it doesn't track you.
[53:45.240 --> 53:51.400]  Let's go back to John Oliver seen online is the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the first
[53:51.400 --> 53:57.480]  authorized to use messenger RNA, which is true. But that has given rise to speculation
[53:57.480 --> 54:02.520]  about what mRNA is capable of doing. Basically, anyone taking these vaccines,
[54:02.520 --> 54:07.640]  they're all designed to the same thing, is going to have neurological disorders within one year.
[54:07.640 --> 54:11.880]  Most of the people taking the vaccine will be dead within 10. Let me tell you something,
[54:12.440 --> 54:17.000]  you take the mRNA, it creates plaque in your brain, it gives you Alzheimer's,
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.480]  and I got the studies too. So hey, you think they just put fluoride in the water to dump you down?
[54:22.520 --> 54:28.760]  Man, Alex Jones is having a lot. Now you notice he didn't show the part of the show where I showed
[54:29.960 --> 54:36.360]  four different articles a few weeks ago from prestigious studies when they did mRNA,
[54:36.360 --> 54:43.080]  similar things on pigs and on sheep and on poultry and on rats. And it caused brain fog and
[54:43.080 --> 54:51.160]  grew prions in the brain. And they try to poo poo this and whitewash it. There's a major discussion
[54:51.160 --> 54:56.520]  about this. And there's major papers out. Oh, but he's crazy again, right? And Bill Gates
[54:56.520 --> 55:00.760]  didn't funding trackable nano chips in the vaccines either. We just showed you that.
[55:00.760 --> 55:06.760]  Oh, let's continue. Tell you something. You take the mRNA, it creates plaque in your brain,
[55:06.760 --> 55:11.240]  it gives you Alzheimer's, and I got the studies too. So hey, you think they just put fluoride
[55:11.240 --> 55:18.040]  in the water to dump you down? Man, Alex Jones is having a blast, isn't he? No one else has as much
[55:18.040 --> 55:23.080]  fun while making the world a worse place to live in. It's like he invented a jet pack that sprays
[55:23.080 --> 55:29.240]  everyone beneath him with human shit. But the thing is, there is absolutely no evidence or
[55:29.240 --> 55:35.400]  credible studies supporting any of what he just said. As for the claim that mRNA vaccines modify
[55:35.400 --> 55:42.600]  your DNA, it is very important to know that the vaccines mRNA does not enter our genome. It does
[55:42.600 --> 55:49.960]  its work far from the cell's nucleus, which is where your DNA is. Let's counter that. We've
[55:49.960 --> 55:55.480]  covered hundreds of articles of medical doctors on virologists. The virus vector and the mRNA can
[55:55.480 --> 56:01.000]  go in and damage the mitochondria because it programs the ribosomes to then program. So it's
[56:01.000 --> 56:08.280]  like saying, my 357 magnum didn't kill you. No, the bullet it fired out did. So it fires bullets
[56:08.280 --> 56:13.320]  into the damn cell. The virus vector does. The other one programs the body to carry it into the cell.
[56:14.120 --> 56:20.440]  It's like saying if UPS delivered a bomb to your door of plastic explosives, five pounds of plastic
[56:20.440 --> 56:25.320]  explosives with a ticking time bomb, did UPS blow your house up or did the explosives? No, technically the
[56:25.320 --> 56:29.640]  explosives did, but you take the package, you go in, you open it up and it blows your house up.
[56:31.480 --> 56:36.520]  Evidence-based perspectives on mRNA SARS COVID vaccine development. There's a big study right
[56:36.520 --> 56:42.920]  there for you. All right, look, I got to go to break. I'm going to get into the economy stuff.
[56:42.920 --> 56:46.840]  I mentioned it's so huge and a bunch of other stuff. We have a special guest joining us as well,
[56:46.840 --> 56:53.560]  but this is just insane. But the turning the military and the FBI and the CIA loose on people.
[56:53.560 --> 56:57.640]  Now the now the vaccines are called extremists. See how that works? Oh, you're an extremist.
[56:57.640 --> 57:01.560]  I'm going to arrest you. But they've always called terrorists extremists. Well, this is only a strong
[57:01.560 --> 57:07.880]  enough word until you realize it means terrorists. Oh, yeah, I forgot. Bill Gates is an ingredient
[57:07.880 --> 57:14.600]  that allows him to track you is called Lucifer or Lucifer ease. He can't make this up.
[57:14.600 --> 57:21.320]  Don't read the baton. He just can't make it up. Yeah, it's called Lucifer. Please. Oh, by the way,
[57:21.320 --> 57:25.400]  I got so busy, I didn't cut the new ads for the new specials. So we've extended the tumoring
[57:26.440 --> 57:31.080]  50% off bodies, ultimate tumor formula, it's been out for so many months, 50% off one more day,
[57:31.080 --> 57:35.960]  and then it's gone. So take advantage of bodies, ultimate tumor formula, so good for your immune

[57:42.120 --> 57:44.600]  50% off for one more day, and it supports the broadcast.
[57:47.880 --> 57:53.160]  It was our number two best selling product until the ongoing COVID lockdowns destroyed the supply
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.720]  chain. And it's been six months since we had bodies, our ultimate tumor formula. And what's
[57:57.720 --> 58:02.120]  been holding up the last few months is the bottle cap. That's why this one's white. I said, I don't
[58:02.120 --> 58:06.840]  care if the cap doesn't match, get it packaged, get it to us, get it shipped out, because it's
[58:06.840 --> 58:11.480]  amazing for information. It's amazing for your immune system. It's amazing on so many fronts,

[58:49.160 --> 58:53.560]  Gerald in South Carolina. Go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey Alex. Welcome.
[58:53.560 --> 58:58.680]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[58:58.680 --> 59:03.560]  wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee
[59:03.560 --> 59:10.200]  and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away. A living defense saved my life.
[59:10.200 --> 59:16.040]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back.
[59:16.040 --> 59:22.440]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew
[59:22.440 --> 59:30.280]  24 verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be
[59:30.280 --> 59:36.440]  hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray
[59:36.440 --> 59:41.640]  one another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at brother. And that's because
[59:41.640 --> 59:45.560]  God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say. And that's why the
[59:45.560 --> 1:00:01.480]  enemy hates it because God created this country. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:21.000]  So I was on air a few weeks ago reading four different studies
[1:00:23.400 --> 1:00:28.520]  from a very respected institutions of the connection of mRNA and it growing plaques in
[1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:32.760]  the brain, particularly if you already have plaques. So it really hits people that already
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:38.120]  have any type of problems with their brain from plaques. Once you have plaque, more plaque grows
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:43.720]  than it, which is really a protein crystal. Here's another big one, microbiology and infectious
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:52.280]  disease. COVID-19 RNA based vaccines and the risk of prion disease. But you just saw John Oliver
[1:00:53.320 --> 1:00:57.560]  say that your truly Alex Jones is just a complete liar that flies around the jetpack
[1:00:57.560 --> 1:01:03.240]  spilling feces on people. Oh, how intellectual, how cute, how funny. China and India have banned the
[1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:09.800]  mRNA vaccines, but that's okay because we're all just dumb Americans if we don't want to take it.
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:15.320]  I mean, that's checkmate. This is being banned all over the world. AstraZeneca is banned in 21
[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:22.840]  European countries alone and Biden just dumped it on India. The blood clots attacking the proteins.
[1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:31.320]  Holy Toledo. Yeah, they've even got studies showing the graphics, showing it eating your
[1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:36.840]  brain cells, showing it attacking your heart cells. I mean, my God, this is super well known,
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:43.880]  but it's okay. The little cutesy movie star with his little twit accent looked down his nose at us.
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:51.400]  Here he is. Man, Alex Jones is having a blast, isn't he? No one else has as much fun while making
[1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:56.360]  the world a worse place to live in. It's like he invented a jetpack that sprays everyone beneath
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:03.000]  him with human shit. But the thing is, there is absolutely no evidence or credible studies
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:08.760]  supporting any of what he just said. As for the claim that mRNA vaccines modify your DNA,
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:15.560]  it is very important to know that the vaccines mRNA does not enter our genome. It does. It
[1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:19.960]  pause. The Washington Post said so. The Washington Post said so. I've got all the papers, all the
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:25.960]  reports before a year ago saying yes, it's genetic engineering. Yes, it changes your DNA, but get over
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:34.200]  it. But now, oh no, we're not doing that. Continue. Far from the cell's nucleus, which is where your
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:40.440]  DNA is, but the fear of what the vaccine contains or what it could do to you seems to be common.
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:46.440]  Some evangelicals are concerned that it contains cells from aborted fetuses, which it does not.
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:55.000]  Pause again. That is a gigantic super whopper. Almost all of them do, and I just showed you
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:00.200]  last hour, the articles continue. Others worry that it could change the body's inner workings.
[1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:04.520]  You might have had a friend tell you that they are worried that the vaccines cause infertility.
[1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:09.560]  Those rumors were fueled by a blog post which falsely claimed that Pfizer's vaccine contained
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:15.240]  ingredients capable of training the female body to attack a protein that plays a crucial role
[1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:20.280]  in the development of the placenta. But a few things there. First, it was Wolfgang Wundar,
[1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:25.640]  one of the head of the EU advisory board, and the former chief executive of science at Pfizer,
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:32.040]  Dr. Yedon, that put that in a huge emergency filing in the EU court December 1st. You lying
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:38.680]  monster Joseph Mingola, apologist. Let's continue. Experts say of that claim, it's a myth,
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:44.600]  it's inaccurate, there is no evidence to support it. And there is already pretty good proof that
[1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:48.040]  Pfizer's vaccine doesn't cause infertility. Oh, stop it again. That's the New York Times told
[1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:53.240]  us Sudam had WMDs. Oh, oh, the one that said Giuliani was under Russian control, which now
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:57.880]  meant was totally fake. Oh, that one. Sorry, go ahead. During the trials last year, multiple
[1:03:57.880 --> 1:04:03.160]  women became pregnant and the only one who suffered a pregnancy loss was given the placebo.
[1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:09.320]  So it is just not true. And looks for stories that you might see hyping up scary sounding data
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:15.000]  from Bayers, the vaccine adverse event. He goes, yeah, on purpose they did a stunt where somebody
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:19.320]  posted that he turned to the Hulk taking the shot to make fun of it. When people are posting real
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:23.320]  names, real people to die, we go check it. And then they put some disinfo in there to try to
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:27.400]  discredit the whole thing. All right, we're going to go to break. I want to get into the economy.
[1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:31.240]  But first I want to hit how they're going to try to criminalize not wanting to take these deadly
[1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:34.760]  poison gene therapies that were never even approved that are banned all over the world.
[1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:38.120]  And they act like we're total cooks and like, well, of course, every business is going to make
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:40.760]  you have it. Of course, you'll be fired. Of course, you've got to have it to come in the
[1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:45.800]  grocery store. Of course, you've got to have it. This is just outrageous. If we call it's bluff,
[1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:50.360]  it's over. We submit it only gets worse from here. As for me, I'm fighting back and never
[1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:53.240]  backing down. We'll be right back. Please keep us in your prayers.
[1:04:57.080 --> 1:05:02.920]  Last week I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission. They said to me, he said, Alex,
[1:05:02.920 --> 1:05:07.720]  there's all these facts and all these numbers of vaccines being recalled and people dying from it
[1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:12.440]  and people getting sick. How do I reach out to my friends and family and explain to them and to
[1:05:12.440 --> 1:05:17.880]  warn them about the danger? And I said to him, something very profound, because it's so true,
[1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:22.600]  trust your gut, trust your spirit, for the Bible tells us. And I said, ask those friends,
[1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:28.600]  those family, those neighbors, do you feel good about this vaccine? And his answer was no, they
[1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:33.880]  don't feel good about it. So go with your gut. Well, let me ask you again. How does your gut feel
[1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:38.040]  about getting the storeable food? How does your gut feel about getting down the countryside? How
[1:05:38.040 --> 1:05:41.960]  does your gut feel about getting guns and ammo to protect yourself? Well, I know what your gut's
[1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:45.880]  telling you. We have the best storeable food with the highest quality at the lowest prices
[1:05:45.880 --> 1:05:53.240]  you're going to find 10% off at infowarstore.com right now or for paradox.com. Go with your gut
[1:05:53.240 --> 1:06:09.480]  and find the info war infowarstore.com. We now take you live to the central Texas Command Center
[1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:15.800]  and the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide.
[1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:36.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two. And I'm simply asking you to stand up and
[1:06:36.920 --> 1:06:44.440]  be counted, crank it up for what you're about to receive. We are putting out the truth, ladies and
[1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:51.560]  gentlemen. We are standing against the bullies and the tyrants. Hundreds of billions of dollars
[1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:57.400]  have been spent by the Rockefeller Foundation, the IBM Foundation, the Bill and the Gates Foundation
[1:06:57.400 --> 1:07:03.880]  to buy up all the major health departments of the world. But it's backfired in the last five years
[1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:15.160]  from going on for about 30 intensely. It really was set in motion in earnest in 1974 with State
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:23.720]  Department memorandum 200 that was later declassified in 1979 as U.S. government policy to carry out the
[1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:28.600]  population not just here but worldwide. And it followed the British plan on population.
[1:07:29.480 --> 1:07:33.320]  There's a full report breaking that down on band.video. If you want to see it,
[1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:38.920]  share it with folks. It's a 12-minute video in the report. And we shot it last night and it's
[1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:43.800]  got clips and all the documents, the admissions of Bill Gates being a eugenicist for depopulation,
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:50.440]  him receiving awards for depopulation. It's titled, Learn the Secrets of Bill and Melinda Gates Divorced
[1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:55.880]  from Alex Jones. When we say it appeared to late last night to get that out to you,
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:08:01.880]  it's a very, very important report because he's just the frontman for all this.
[1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:07.560]  And I'll give you the good news, as I said last hour, the fact that
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:14.840]  Pfizer has been kicked out of China and kicked out of India saying it doesn't work and it's dangerous.
[1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:22.440]  That's checkmate for John Oliver. That's checkmate for Chuck E. Schumer. That's Chuck
[1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:28.840]  for all these globalists that want to sit up there and go, this is crazy. It's totally safe,
[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:34.440]  totally tested. No one's ever gotten hurt at all. It's wonderful when they're lying to you. They're
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:46.600]  gaslighting you. And then you've got other major vaccine makers, not just Merck, but a whole bunch
[1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:52.360]  of them pulling out and going, you can't make a vaccine for the common cold that works. And the
[1:08:52.360 --> 1:08:57.880]  way that we've been asked by the UN and by the federal government and by the CDC of what they
[1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:02.280]  want the vaccine to do, because they tell them what they want to accelerate something, they go,
[1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:07.160]  this will attack proteins in the body. And so when prestigious scientists come out from
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:13.960]  across the world that had up major EU advisory boards, you name it. I mean, the former chief
[1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:19.800]  scientist at Pfizer went public and said, this is going to attack people's proteins in their brain,
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:23.320]  their heart, their uteruses, you name it. Any fast growing cells have this protein.
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:34.200]  John Oliver goes, well, look at this. They got it off a blog post. My invitation is not very good.
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:41.800]  It's all made up from out of Jones and his poo poo jet pack. He actually said that. Look,
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:48.920]  I got a green tie. I'm an intellectual left to stick someone with a low class English accent
[1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:54.680]  to do the rocket scientist. I mean, he's got the accent of a guy that'll steal your watch when
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:10:00.440]  you're in downtown London. So that's who these sibling criminals are. And he is a criminal.
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:05.240]  He takes money from Bill Gates. HBO takes money from Bill Gates. All these programs are paid for.
[1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:13.320]  So remember that. And go read the article. Former Pfizer VP blows the lid off vaccine scheme.
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:19.480]  Entirely possible. This will be used for massive scale depopulation. Close quote.
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:24.440]  So I want to play a few minutes with Tucker Carlson. It's a whole 16-minute report. Your next
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:29.240]  little job is getting more hardcore on the issue. Who are these people saying what you've got to
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:33.320]  put in your body? Who are these people saying your body, their choice? Who are these people
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:39.960]  now on everywhere? Former presidents and all these talk shows, Republican Democrats saying,
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:43.640]  you better take it. We're going to bully you. We're going to make you. You don't have a choice.
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:48.040]  Yes, vaccine passports. Yes, government's going to make you do it. States like Hawaii,
[1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:51.720]  governments like Canada, the UK. They're like, yeah, you know what? We are going to make you do
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:55.000]  it. You're not going to have a job or leave if you don't do it. Everybody else is locked up
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:58.600]  till you all do it. And we're going to say it's all your fault when you don't submit.
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:05.160]  More divide and conquer. This is such a criminal enterprise. And you've got all these same big
[1:11:05.160 --> 1:11:10.120]  pharma companies that gave you OxyCotin and all these other poisons that Frank Luntz made all
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:14.760]  that money off of lecturing you that you're not allowed to criticize them. And there's big tech
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:19.800]  that merged with big pharma censoring everybody, including members of the British
[1:11:22.040 --> 1:11:28.120]  and Australian and US government, governors, members of parliament, members of Congress,
[1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:33.880]  senators are censored when they're interviewing medical doctors in testimony because big tech
[1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:40.840]  has committed a huge crime against humanity that violates the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:46.760]  Code and the Helsinki Code of illegal experimentation. These people are in a lot of trouble.
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:50.680]  Major vaccine makers pulled out saying it doesn't work. It's criminal.
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:56.520]  They got cold feces. Let me tell you, I'd have cold feet if I was them. This is a major assault.
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:12:00.600]  This will be known as Biggest World War II when it all comes out. These people will hang for this
[1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:05.560]  or we'll be defeated. We're going to lose to this or they're going to be hung by a judge,
[1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:09.240]  jury, the whole thing. I mean, this is Nuremberg stuff, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:13.400]  that you are in the middle of a biological warfare attack.
[1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:18.920]  All right, here's some of Tucker last night. I'm going to hit the economic news next segment.
[1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:23.400]  It does not mean that they are dangerous and we are not claiming the coronavirus vaccines
[1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:29.240]  are dangerous. But we are telling the truth, which is there are unresolved concerns about
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:34.360]  their long-term effects on some people, including their effects on female fertility.
[1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:39.800]  That is not a conspiracy theory. That is true. It's an honest question. What's the long-term
[1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:44.520]  effect that no one so far has been able to answer? And it's not simply being asked by
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:48.920]  partisans. It's being asked by practicing physicians. Catherine Lee, for example,
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:52.760]  is a research fellow in the Division of Public Health Sciences at Washington University in
[1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:58.520]  St. Louis. Lee doesn't seem like a partisan Republican or a QAnon adherent or a crank.
[1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:03.480]  She gladly took the coronavirus vaccine. She seemed to support the coronavirus vaccine strongly.
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:08.120]  But then in herself, she noticed unexpected effects on her menstrual cycle.
[1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:13.160]  Quote, it wasn't a symptom that was on the list, Lee said. I expected that my arm would be sore,
[1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:16.600]  or that I might have a fever or headache, but this just wasn't on the list.
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:22.120]  Kate Clancy, another scientist who studies female fertility at the University of Illinois,
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:26.440]  reported that she had the same symptoms after she got the vaccine and she wrote about it in
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:31.000]  some detail on Twitter. You can look it up. After she did write about it, dozens of other
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:36.680]  women wrote in about similar experiences they had had after getting the vaccine. None of these
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:41.720]  symptoms had been described in the medical literature. The reason? The clinical trials for
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:46.120]  the vaccines never tested for the effects on the female menstrual cycle or for fertility or
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:51.240]  on pregnant women. So maybe the symptoms amount to nothing. That's often the case. Maybe they
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:56.920]  amount to something we don't know. The fact is, we can't say what the long-term effects of this
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:02.840]  vaccine will be on women, including pregnant women. Honest people admit this. Every scientist knows it.
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:06.680]  According to a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, quote,
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:12.520]  more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:19.320]  pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal pregnancy and infant outcomes. In other words,
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:24.520]  at this point, and there's no changing this because it's true, we just don't know. Again,
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:30.440]  that does not mean the coronavirus vaccine is dangerous. There is no proof that it's dangerous.
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:35.880]  But there doesn't need to be. Well, we got more of that coming up. He's using basic reverse
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:42.040]  psychology on him. He's like, well, if the vaccine works, why do I got to wear a mask? Or, oh, a lot
[1:14:42.040 --> 1:14:45.480]  of these women that are scientists having these bad menstrual cycles, why are 80-year-old women
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:49.800]  suddenly having them again? Because it attacks your uterus, and that's what Wolfgang Wudarg
[1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:58.760]  and that's what Dr. Yidon all said in December it would probably do, because it's the same protein
[1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:05.800]  that's in the virus spike that is in a woman's uterine lining. Isn't it funny that everything
[1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:09.720]  Bill Gates does, he's been called all over the world, leads the infertility when he says he
[1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:16.040]  wants to kill everybody. Isn't that just interesting? Yeah, there's the actual scientific report,
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:21.080]  emergency filing, medical studies to the EU. But, oh, John Oliver just said, we just made it up.
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:26.760]  He just said, you know, Jones just read some blog post, and he just lied. He's a horrible person.
[1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:30.360]  He really enjoys this. Yeah, I enjoyed having death threats and being sued. I mean, the
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:34.200]  global's come after us and taking our bank accounts away and watching everybody get killed in front
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:38.840]  of me. It's really fun, John Oliver. No, it's not fun for me. You're projecting you enjoy
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:45.720]  being a little elitist and and and feeding on humanity. You monster. You are Joseph Minglin's
[1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:53.320]  hand boy. You're his little his little minion, his little little helper, his little towel towel boy.
[1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:59.320]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked about
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:03.080]  has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:07.400]  about that. I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have so much credibility
[1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:11.800]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:16.280]  they're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what's going on. But let's just say this,
[1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:21.240]  we're going to see this through the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can. So please
[1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:25.640]  pray for us and please buy the products and then forward store.com. They're great products, plus
[1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:30.040]  they fund the operation. So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:34.600]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and
[1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:39.400]  fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth. That's why the globalists
[1:16:39.400 --> 1:16:43.640]  are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:47.720]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:51.640]  we've done. You can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:56.680]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said. The equation is very simple.
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:02.920]  The bank of banks control the media. They control big pharma. They control academia.
[1:17:02.920 --> 1:17:09.640]  They control the military, industrial complex. They control big tech. And everywhere that they
[1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:15.880]  have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and
[1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:22.200]  dehumanization. It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and
[1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:26.680]  that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them. So because they
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:34.360]  can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down and use the idea
[1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:40.440]  of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly
[1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:46.280]  of control. That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to the feeding them.
[1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:51.640]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:59.560]  So we double your efforts for all of this together. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:13.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:26.600]  Oh, baby, I'm going to teach you what love's all about tonight.
[1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:39.160]  Trust me, honey, everything's gonna be all right. Oh, yeah. Just do like I do.
[1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:47.960]  There ain't nothing to it. Listen to me, baby, anybody can do it. Oh, yeah, gotta do it.
[1:18:53.320 --> 1:18:56.680]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here. You know, a few weeks ago,
[1:18:57.720 --> 1:19:00.920]  Ken Carlson started coming out and criticizing the push for forced immaculations.
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:04.760]  And he went on to say, everybody wearing these masks, like little kids wearing them,
[1:19:04.760 --> 1:19:08.440]  I see like people with two year old children wearing them, people's dogs wearing them in
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:12.840]  Austin, the more liberal areas. It's a sacrament of how good they are and how dirty, you know,
[1:19:12.840 --> 1:19:17.880]  the rest of us are. He said, you know, go up and tell them that's abusing your child.
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:21.800]  And the studies show that I've got an article here where a teacher got suspended for
[1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:26.280]  saying it's abusive to make elementary school students wear these. It's a cult.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.160]  And it's a sign of their subservience. But they lied to us about the numbers COVID was killing.
[1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:36.360]  They put people to the night of other things in the COVID column. They killed a bunch of people
[1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:41.080]  with ventilators and sending people that were sick into the nursing homes. This has been a big
[1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:48.680]  orchestrated test of the UN and big pharma to control the planet. And I told you, it'll never
[1:19:48.680 --> 1:19:53.160]  end. And I told you, they'll claim they're going to get rid of the restrictions. They'll barely
[1:19:53.720 --> 1:19:57.320]  release them part way and then clamp them back down. And now I got stacks of articles
[1:19:57.320 --> 1:19:59.800]  where the UN saying, oh, we need a lockdown for the flu.
[1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:07.480]  This winter, I've got it all right here. And oh, don't worry, the boosters are going to be a patch.
[1:20:07.480 --> 1:20:13.400]  We've got them all ready. We've got patches that also let us know you've been vaccinated. The
[1:20:13.400 --> 1:20:20.520]  past will be on your body now. Oh, where did I hear that? CBS News. So they're just racing
[1:20:20.520 --> 1:20:25.000]  ahead with this. And then I got polaxed. I've been hitting ahead with a two by four when I came in
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:30.360]  this morning and read Mercola's article that's on infowars.com posted on the live feed of the show
[1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:35.560]  where he quotes the Bill and Linda Gates Foundation spokesperson saying,
[1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:40.040]  we will take them out as terrorists. We will shut them down. And we're not just going to arrest them.
[1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:44.040]  We're going to frustrate their operations. And then he started getting death threats and stuff.
[1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:49.000]  A few weeks after this report came out and a bunch of others. So he said, fine, I'm going to take
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:56.360]  down what's admitted scientific facts about vitamin D, vitamin C and zinc and ivermectin and
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:21:01.480]  hydroxychloroquine. And you know, in places like Chicago and New York, people going to the hospital,
[1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:06.920]  they won't give them zinc or ivermectin or any of it. They're murderers. They go, oh, sorry,
[1:21:06.920 --> 1:21:12.200]  there's no approved treatment except vaccines because we were told day one a year ago by the
[1:21:12.200 --> 1:21:19.000]  U.N., it would be that way. And it's still that way. I expect they'll next say there's no proven
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:25.720]  treatment for dehydration. We've got this synthetic thing we call coagular. We're like, hey, water
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:31.160]  is what you need. No, no, U.N. doesn't say that water is good for dehydration. Coagular is the
[1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:37.320]  only thing made by Bill and Linda Gates. I mean, that's how this works. Any idiot knows this is
[1:21:37.320 --> 1:21:42.520]  a fraud. But they have paid off. We now know in the U.S. alone, tens of thousands of people,
[1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:48.280]  even with 100,000 followers on Facebook or Twitter, hey, how'd you like $3,000, $5,000,
[1:21:48.280 --> 1:21:52.840]  $10,000 to say you took the shot and you loved it. And the people email back, they've gone online,
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:56.680]  a lot of them, and go, okay, but what about what's taken? Well, don't worry about that. Just say
[1:21:56.680 --> 1:22:02.120]  you've taken it and tell people how much you love it. We'll give you half the payment now,
[1:22:02.120 --> 1:22:07.000]  the other half once we see the report because they know you trust average people. So they
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:13.480]  censor us, they censor regular medical doctors, they censor scientists, they censor now even the
[1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:19.640]  internet conferencing sites. What's in the news yesterday are finding out what are you going
[1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:23.880]  to talk about with a group of doctors? Well, we've got 100 doctors signed up and nurses and
[1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:27.160]  they want to talk about organizing what they're going to do with their signal, their patients.
[1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:33.000]  Oh, no, is it you and approved? Well, we have medical degrees we want to meet. Oh, you can't
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:38.200]  meet. I mean, you can't go outside and meet and can't go to a hotel and meet because of COVID.
[1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:43.480]  And you can't meet online. Sorry. We don't let you meet because we're liberal.
[1:22:44.280 --> 1:22:47.800]  But you can listen to John Oliver tell you how great it is. How's that sound?
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:53.640]  So let me show you some headlines here overhead shop, please.
[1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:59.560]  Radio listeners, I'll read them. Your COVID vaccine boosters coming as a patch and a pill or might
[1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:04.040]  come with your flu shot. This is the booster shots, you know, it's the new patch with the glass in it.
[1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:11.080]  Why I'm recovering, why I'm removing all articles related to vitamin D, C, zinc and COVID-19,
[1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:15.640]  Dr. McCullough, and the whole dome line against groups says we're going to start using the
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:21.080]  military and CIA on people as anti extremism terror forces. And then he got attacked and
[1:23:21.080 --> 1:23:25.480]  death rather than much stuff happened. And so he's that's it. Here's the actual report that
[1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:31.720]  the disinformation doesn't why platforms must act on 12 leading online anti-vaxxers.
[1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:36.840]  Of course, they've already censored a little bit hell out of them, but now it's paramilitary.
[1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:42.920]  That's what McCullough says. Emergency Tuesday broadcast, Bill Gates Foundation calls for CIA
[1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:48.520]  this military to silence anti-vaxxers. Wow. And we've got the whole McCullough situation under
[1:23:48.520 --> 1:23:53.880]  that there for you. Who calls for another 45 billion to vaccinate most adults across the
[1:23:53.880 --> 1:23:58.600]  globe. It's all about the Benjamin. John Oliver attacks Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan
[1:23:58.600 --> 1:24:03.400]  and more. He says everybody should take it. Everybody loves it. No deaths, no problems.
[1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:09.400]  India bans the Pfizer. China bans the Pfizer. But again, that's a total checkmate right there.
[1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:14.280]  They're not going to take it, but you need to. And here they are admitting fetal cells are in it.
[1:24:14.280 --> 1:24:19.400]  But oh, that's, you know, from USA Today and chop.edu. But John Oliver says it's not true.
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:24.840]  A history of vaccine safety concerns at CDC. Even their whitewash is incredible. Yeah,
[1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:28.600]  we gave 90 million people cancer viruses. It killed a bunch. Yeah, we gave people
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:31.720]  Guillain-Barré's and brain damage. Yeah, we gave people the, you know,
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:35.960]  just goes on all the whole bunch of stuff for you there. Cancer risk associated with
[1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:42.360]  Simeon virus 40 contaminated polio vaccines, polio vaccine Simeon 40 and human cancer,
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:46.840]  the epidemiological evidence for causal association nature.com. They're finding us.
[1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:51.240]  Yeah, it gave millions of people cancer. Whole bunch of types of cancer 30% increase of that.
[1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:54.360]  90% increase of this. I mean, it just goes on and on moderate for yourself. You know,
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  John Oliver says it's not true. It goes on and on the most important decisions parents will ever make.
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:05.640]  Whether or not to vaccinate your children. Excellent piece by West Price Foundation.
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:10.840]  Oh, but don't worry. He's not a supervillain. Bill Gates venture aims to spray dust into the
[1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:15.800]  atmosphere via jet fuel patented. We told you about 15 years ago, 20 years ago, to block the sun.
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:21.720]  What could go wrong? Bill Gates warns the next pandemic could be 10 times worse.
[1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:28.600]  Better do it up. He says right now. That's just some of the news. Oh, and look, look what else
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:35.640]  is coming out. Evidence reveals that military team collaborated with lab or COVID-19 pandemic
[1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:42.680]  originated to create weaponized system. And you'll allege it's not that deadly. If you don't have
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:46.440]  your normal vitamins and minerals, you're dead. It has incredible gain of function. It's a real
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:54.680]  virus, a souped up cold virus. Okay. Fact check. Well, vaccines contain human DNA. There is no
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:59.480]  link to cancer. USA Day says, and then I just showed you a bunch of stuff about them giving you
[1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:04.760]  cancer through vaccines from going back to the fifties right through to now on the CDC's on
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:10.520]  website. But look, USA Today goes, yes, there's human DNA. Yes, we use fetal parts. But so that's
[1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:17.000]  USA Day, John Oliver. The other is Tandestine's legislation banning the use of vaccine passports
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:21.720]  in Florida. That's a good start. Lecture warns lockdown restrictions will return whether there's
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:27.480]  a harsh flu season. Paul Joseph Watson out of the UK. School nurse who said masks were harmful to
[1:26:27.480 --> 1:26:33.880]  students suspended. Texas nurse five refusing COVID vaccine. Cultural divide. Libs keep wearing masks
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:38.120]  despite repeal of mandates. Swimming pool tell swimmers to exhale underwater not to look
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:43.080]  or talk at others. It's not a cult or anything. Oh, I got a couple more stacks of that and a lot
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:48.440]  more. I'm gonna get the economic terrorism news, though, that I just mentioned when we come back,
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:54.680]  how you're a terrorist. If you don't take the shot, Bill Gates wants you killed 14 months ago,
[1:26:54.680 --> 1:26:59.480]  I began to stay on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:04.120]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts
[1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:09.560]  that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:14.040]  third world and really hurt the first world. Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:18.280]  all over the United States. That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:23.400]  that can barely get the job done before delivering gas had been shut down. Plus the Keystone pipeline
[1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:28.840]  has been shut down along with other pipelines. The left is now blowing up dams across the US.
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:33.000]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:37.720]  prepare to be a total slave. The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:42.600]  until you wake up and this is a globalist chai-com takeover. Gregory said you have no hope.
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:47.640]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[1:27:47.640 --> 1:27:51.960]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[1:27:54.200 --> 1:27:59.480]  I one trillion percent believe what I'm saying. Hell, everybody knows that. I just tell you what
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:03.640]  I'm really thinking. People say, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air? That's embarrassing.
[1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:08.600]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me, but I'll tell you this right now.

[1:29:59.720 --> 1:30:22.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday Tuesday Transmission. It's May 4th,
[1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:28.920]  Tuesday Transmission. I'm a little bit upside down right now. I was during the break. They walked
[1:30:28.920 --> 1:30:36.760]  in and handed me a new article from Fox News, WUSA 9, and right out of the local DC newspaper as well.
[1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:45.560]  Get ready for this. I just told you about how in Spain and the UK they say, do not look at people,
[1:30:46.200 --> 1:30:50.760]  turn your head. It's just, again, just more cult control. Stand on one leg, stand on your head,
[1:30:51.480 --> 1:30:55.880]  stand with your finger and your nose. I mean, it's all just cult programming to see what orders
[1:30:55.880 --> 1:30:59.800]  you'll follow to see what you'll do. Because who would get rid of freedom? Who would get rid of
[1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:06.040]  prosperity? They've got to get you to do ridiculous things like say, a man can have a pap smear when
[1:31:06.040 --> 1:31:12.760]  he has male genitals. He doesn't have a cervix. He doesn't have a vagina. The UK government has fired
[1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:18.520]  nurses and doctors that will not do pap smears on a man's penis. Well, it's the same thing here.
[1:31:19.320 --> 1:31:25.080]  DC mayor bans dancing at weddings. They're never going to reopen their blue cities until they
[1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:30.600]  fully collapse. That's why New York is a dead rotting apple now. Because once everybody goes
[1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:35.800]  bankrupt and once everybody sells their pennies on the dollar, then the globalists will do a little
[1:31:35.800 --> 1:31:44.680]  bit of loosening the restrictions. In a city where dancing is forbidden, not even a teenager with
[1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:50.840]  rebellious spirit can save DC couples reeling from the capital's latest COVID guidelines.
[1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:54.600]  Notice it's guidelines. It's not really a law, but we all follow it. So there you go.
[1:31:55.960 --> 1:32:01.080]  Seemingly rip straight from the plot of footloose Washington DC's new social distancing rules,
[1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:08.040]  ban standing and dancing at weddings. The sudden announcement made just as wedding season kicks
[1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:15.000]  off has blindsided couples getting ready to tie the knot. Hey, don't get married in a blue jurisdiction.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:22.680]  Blue jurisdictions are psychotic control free command bases. It's the same thing in Australia,
[1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:27.880]  same thing in the UK. Do not dance. Remember what Newsom said? Do not sing at church.
[1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:35.400]  25% capacity. Do not sing. But Black Lives Matter can burn and shoot and loot. The Democrats put
[1:32:35.400 --> 1:32:42.600]  a fake study out saying it lowered COVID when they marched. Because that doesn't make sense. It's like
[1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:47.720]  YouTube giving itself an award for fighting for free speech. It's about gaslighting you.
[1:32:47.720 --> 1:32:53.960]  It's a psychological operation. So that's what we're talking about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:32:56.280 --> 1:33:02.280]  Wear a mask when you swim. Don't look at people when you walk down the street. It's all over the
[1:33:02.280 --> 1:33:07.240]  world from Australia to the UK to Democrat cities and globalist cities in Canada.
[1:33:07.240 --> 1:33:15.400]  CDC says Americans should ditch singing and loud music alcohol for holidays due to pandemic. That's
[1:33:15.400 --> 1:33:22.760]  right. It's the new religion and the left love's complying. Starts out with don't say the n-word.
[1:33:22.760 --> 1:33:28.040]  Well, I don't say the n-word. And the next, oh, don't say Mother Father. Oh, don't sing. Oh,
[1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:34.680]  wear a mask underwater. Why? Because I'm in control. I'm a crazy control freak. And Bill Gates is
[1:33:34.680 --> 1:33:40.040]  your doctor. Sure, he talks about who wants to kill you and holds a secret billionaire club group
[1:33:40.040 --> 1:33:44.520]  with the UN on how to set up world government sterilize you. And yeah, he wants microchips
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:48.600]  in you, but you're not supposed to, even when you get the new microchips coming out in two months
[1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:53.960]  and the new patches they've announced to CBS News, don't call it that. It's a sub-dermal
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:34:02.120]  micro tracing system. Okay, okay. Oh, they're not calling them vaccine passports now. They're calling
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:09.240]  them freedom pass in Chicago. Like the freedom bracelets in Israel that track you, oh, liberal.
[1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:17.640]  So let me do this. I've got this huge news about the Tizenware Mercola where they're officially
[1:34:17.640 --> 1:34:22.440]  announcing if we say you're a Russian spy, no judge, no jury, we're going to kill you actually.
[1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:25.960]  And that's why they said Giuliani is run by Russians. No proof. Now they've been it's all
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:30.920]  fake. They don't care. And now they're saying, oh, if we say you're anti-vaxxer, you're a terrorist too.
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:33.800]  And Biden signed an executive order saying it'll take everything you've got. Well,
[1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:39.240]  let them go ahead and do it. Let them accelerate it. But they are mad dogs because no one's stopping
[1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:44.680]  them. The Justice Department, so good at suppressing gun owners and churches and in Christians, but
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:49.720]  they're all a bunch of lawyers that just bow to the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and Bill Gates.
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:55.560]  And so that's why things are getting worse and worse and worse and worse by the minute.
[1:34:55.560 --> 1:35:00.360]  And the news I mentioned yesterday, but didn't really get to, now there's even more news on that
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:07.800]  front. And I'm going to cover this when we start the next hour. And that is the worldwide economic
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:11.800]  collapse that we now have got a good gauge on how bad it's going to be and when it's going to start
[1:35:11.800 --> 1:35:18.120]  unfolding. So this is a dead reckoning I'm going to give you. But it's very, very important to
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:23.560]  start the next hour. And then we're also going to look at the big stack of sex-travelling pedophile
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:29.560]  news that's out today. And of course, everything I told you years ago is now being confirmed.
[1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:36.360]  Folks, even it was trending again on Twitter yesterday, an article from like three years ago
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:42.200]  where I said Harvey Weinstein is involved raping women. That wasn't out at the time. And I said
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:47.160]  it's part of a cult where they brand women and tie them up with the Democrats and then starve them
[1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:51.560]  to death. And of course, I'd been told about the cult. Now, you notice next year, but that's only
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:57.560]  one branch. And of course, now it's all come out that that's happening right now. So they're
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:01.560]  really mad at me. And I'm glad the Huffington Post attacked me for it. All of Jones Harvey Weinstein
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:06.600]  comments are vile beyond belief. And I told women, don't be part of these cults, because a lot of times
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:11.560]  they'll actually kill you. And so there's that article, but it ties in with former Democrat
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:17.160]  Oregon's house speaker arrested in sex-travelling sting. And we've got German police find giant
[1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:21.880]  new pedophile ring and so much more. But first, let's go ahead and go to this newest Darren McBreen
[1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:29.640]  report, Vax Pass, Access to Freedom. It's on Bandog video. The city of Chicago wants you to
[1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:35.720]  get your vaccine passport, but they don't want you to call it a vaccine passport. No, they would
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:43.080]  rather you simply call it a city pass that gives residents discounts and free admissions to museums.
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:47.640]  You know, I wasn't looking at the clock, right? I don't usually mess up like that. I went to that
[1:36:47.640 --> 1:36:52.440]  15 seconds later. I'm going to play that at the start of the next segment. Let me go ahead and
[1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:57.720]  just start hitting this right now. Again, I already got into quite a bit of this earlier, but I want
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:04.200]  to show you the dub tailing. This is the article here, why I'm removing all articles related to
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:10.440]  vitamins D, C, zinc and COVID-19, Dr. Mercola and the Bill and Melinda Gates funded found founded
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:15.720]  group and 20 attorney generals are calling for counterterrorism measures to be used to take
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:20.600]  him out to take out the other 11 people, including Dr. Sherry Tenpenny. You're like, man, that doesn't
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:26.600]  even sound real. Well, there's the report right there where they say it all. Now he's getting
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:31.560]  death threats and really serious things that are so intense and so real. I know what happened to
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:36.680]  Dr. Group and others and myself. And so, you know, they're now calling him up, letting them know
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:40.440]  that he's been followed and things like that and that they're going to kill his family. And that's
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:44.040]  the standard deal. He talks about threats on him and his family. So that's the standard deals.
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:48.760]  He's just like, listen, this is too mafia. I'm pulling this stuff down and the country's basically
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:55.960]  gone. So that's a very, very serious situation. But that ties into this. Biden executive order
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:38:00.840]  strips Americans of their rights if they directly or indirectly aid Russia. And the Southern
[1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:05.560]  Poverty Law Center, the Democratic Party, the ADL or consortium of private research groups,
[1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:10.520]  if they say you don't even know you're helping Russians with no proof, you then lose your bank
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:14.440]  accounts, you're right to travel, you put on no fly list. And finally, they're saying they will
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:19.800]  frustrate your operations using the U.S. Army. I guess that means kill you. So here's another one.
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:25.640]  New York Times, NBC and Washington Post retract claim that FBI warned Rudy Giuliani he was
[1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:30.120]  target of Russian influence operation. None of that was true, but they don't care. Now he's been
[1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:38.840]  raided. And then that ties in to all the rest of this. So that's how they operate. They're the
[1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:42.280]  global is getting rid of the country. They're the global is attacking our families, our borders,
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:48.360]  our dollar, our very nation, our health. Notice, you know, India and China and everybody else won't
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:52.200]  take the mRNA vaccine. They're not going to see legal. It's a test. It killed animals in the
[1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:56.600]  studies because they did previous studies. That's why they didn't do official animal studies,
[1:38:56.600 --> 1:39:00.120]  because they knew in the real studies they did that it actually killed a bunch of animals. That
[1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:03.800]  was one thing John Oliver got right. He's like, you know, they've been studying this for decades.
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:07.480]  That's why they were actually able to warp speed it. Well, yeah, they had it on the shelf exactly,
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:15.880]  which shows how bad it is. So that is absolutely out of control. As China doesn't yet have an mRNA
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:21.240]  shot on its own and isn't accepting ours. They just continue with the virus as a classical vaccine.
[1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:26.920]  So again, this is all a giant test. So if India has banned it, China won't take it. Why are we
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:31.640]  weird to say we don't trust it when Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate us? Who died and made
[1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:37.480]  him our doctor? All right, we'll go to that special report right out of the break when we come back.
[1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:43.080]  Then I'm going to hit the economic news that is so incredibly important as well.
[1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:48.200]  And so much more with a special guest at the bottom of the hour next hour. I'm Alex Jones,

[1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:26.440]  big tech and the globalist are predatory and are evil. And in the surveillance state, we need to
[1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:31.160]  more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved

[1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:59.880]  warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational. The globalists are
[1:41:59.880 --> 1:42:05.320]  out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news
[1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:09.320]  is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:14.760]  decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong, we're incredible,
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:19.000]  and if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:24.360]  God for guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared
[1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:29.560]  is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting info
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:33.960]  wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products
[1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:41.400]  for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation infowarstore.com. Infowarstore.com is
[1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:45.080]  incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are

[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:55.640]  for being part of the resistance. It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:42:58.440 --> 1:43:05.160]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world. It's known as the builder bird.
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:11.560]  Could their objective be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:18.440]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:24.200]  of humanity is in hand. The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago. It is the blueprint for
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:28.440]  their plan to figure the world. It is the blueprint for the great reset. It is in game blueprint for
[1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:33.160]  global enslavement available right now at infowarstore.com with a zero country code meaning
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:37.960]  you can make copies of it anywhere in the world. I strongly suggest you get the film in game at
[1:43:37.960 --> 1:43:42.680]  infowarstore.com. I strongly suggest you make copies and share it. And if you take that action,
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:47.000]  I demand you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:51.480]  That will trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[1:43:56.600 --> 1:43:59.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:12.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. And folks, I know I'm harping on
[1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:15.960]  the so-called vaccines because the deaths are mounting, the illnesses are mounting,
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:20.520]  the white papers, the reports are coming out. What the top side has predicted last year is coming
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:25.240]  true with the brain damage and the heart attacks and the blood clots and the vaccines are being
[1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:29.720]  banned all over the world. But in our media, they go, you dumb Americans, it's totally safe.
[1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:34.920]  Everybody must take it because they really do think we're stupid. You've got to let people know
[1:44:34.920 --> 1:44:39.240]  these vaccines are being banned all over the world and they're being dumped on us here in the United
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:46.360]  States. It's really important. And again, everywhere, all these Democrat cities are rolling it out.
[1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:51.240]  Hawaii is rolling it out. New York's rolling it out. London's rolling it out. And they said,
[1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:55.080]  oh, we're not going to do Vax passes because they didn't want to get opposition formed. They were
[1:44:55.080 --> 1:45:00.200]  always planning it. That's a military tactic. Well, you're attacking somebody to tell them,
[1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:05.720]  I'm not attacking you. I'm not attacking you. And so here's the report. It's at band.video,
[1:45:05.720 --> 1:45:12.280]  just went live. Vax pass, access to freedom. And I love McBree. He's a great editor, great researcher.
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:17.160]  He did a great report. But I know it's a sarcastic headline. Maybe put access to freedom
[1:45:19.800 --> 1:45:27.080]  or access to slavery. The global technological elite have launched a massive propaganda campaign
[1:45:27.080 --> 1:45:30.840]  to guilt Americans into getting the COVID vaccine in order to return to basic normalcy.
[1:45:30.840 --> 1:45:37.640]  They hold us hostage, but you never get back to normalcy. And you look at these creepy medical
[1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:45.160]  workers. And now they admit we're holding you hostage. And that's the talking point. I mean,
[1:45:45.160 --> 1:45:51.240]  this is what bad guys do. What was that show that was on MTV? Back when MTV was still popular,
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:56.840]  it was a comedy show. And there's a scene of like SS officers on the eastern front,
[1:45:56.840 --> 1:46:02.520]  mega, you know, we wear black uniforms. We've got skulls on and we kill innocent people. Maybe
[1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:12.520]  we're the baddies. Maybe we're the baddies. Maybe it was on another channel. Was it Mr. Show? I
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:19.640]  don't remember. It's like 15, 20 years old. Yeah, there it is. It was BBC. In fact,
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:23.480]  after we play this report, we'll actually play that. And they'll remind me what the name of the
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:30.840]  show is. But I mean, come on, guys, this is textbook. This is ridiculous. And the guy running it
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:37.240]  famously says he wants to depopulate the earth and releases GMO mosquitoes and wants to black the sun
[1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:43.480]  out. But the program I told you about 25 years ago now declassified, they add barium salt,
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:54.520]  aluminum oxide to jet fuel, and it aerosolizes nuclei in the sky. Yes, I know that water crystals
[1:46:54.520 --> 1:46:59.160]  form them as well, but they dissipate. These are forming nuclei to form large clouds to block up
[1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:06.600]  the sun. It's official. They now admit we were right again. There's giant out of control secret
[1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:12.600]  projects going on bigger than Manhattan project. Now there's a sterilization depopulation program
[1:47:12.600 --> 1:47:17.480]  to make us allergic to our own bodies and have our bodies attack us. They're giving us an auto
[1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:28.120]  immune response to our own protein. God Almighty help us, please Lord. The hospitals were empty.
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:35.320]  The death tolls were 110 to 1% of what they said. It was all a lie. It meant you were conned.
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:42.440]  Stop submitting to the fraud. Here's the report. Vax pass access to slavery. Here it is.
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:49.160]  The city of Chicago wants you to get your vaccine passport, but they don't want you to call it a
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:55.720]  vaccine passport. No, they would rather you simply call it a city pass that gives residents
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:48:00.840]  discounts and free admissions to museums. A really exciting development here to have these
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:06.600]  vaccine passports. And if there is a concert you'd like to attend, you won't be turned away at the
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:14.440]  gate as long as you have your city pass. You want to be part of the fun? Get vaccinated. You heard
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:19.800]  her Chicago's top doc, Alison Arwiti revealed some new details today about plans to encourage
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:23.640]  people to get vaccinated ahead of summer. We're interested in thinking about ways to
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:29.720]  incentivize people to get the vaccine. Chicago's top doc Alison Arwiti says the city is evaluating
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:35.720]  what's called a Vax Passport that will give you next month, allowing those who got the shots to
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:41.240]  enjoy concerts and other events. In Chicago, the Public Health Commissioner just introduced a Vax
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:46.360]  Pass which residents can use to gain access to summer concerts. If you've been vaccinated,
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:51.080]  there could be concert tickets with your name on it. Chicago health officials not the only one
[1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:58.360]  saying prove you've been vaccinated. A green check mark on your profile ID means you're good to go.
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:04.680]  And this is being promoted as the end of the coronavirus lockdowns. You can go back to
[1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:10.840]  restaurants and your bars and movie theaters. They're all going to open back up again to full
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:17.720]  capacity and all they got to do is make sure that everyone inside or everyone that enters has proof
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:25.560]  that they got the vaccine and that it can be verified at the door with the app. This is the
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:32.120]  NHS app. Soon this could be used to prove that someone has been vaccinated or recently tested
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:38.200]  for COVID, allowing them to travel internationally. As Chicago opens the COVID vaccine to more people
[1:49:38.200 --> 1:49:43.720]  today, the federal government is working behind the scenes on a vaccine passport. It works by
[1:49:43.720 --> 1:49:48.600]  showing a barcode on your phone or print out to prove you've been vaccinated. DePaul University
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:54.440]  professor, Greg Pugman says there should be a universal one used worldwide. If the WHO came out
[1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:59.480]  with the definitive app that would be recognized all over the world, that would make life easiest
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:05.400]  for all of us. Come on. There are no vaccine passports. That's insane. That's Alex Jones stuff.
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:08.840]  Hey, you need to get your shots. You're not going to be allowed to have a job or travel.
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:14.520]  And yes, we're going to have an international vaccine passport that's standardized by the UN,
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:18.520]  that China already proposed a year ago. And so it doesn't matter what your government does.
[1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:22.840]  These companies and corporations and others aren't going to let you do it unless you accept
[1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:27.480]  the standardized global system. Vaccine passports proof that you've gotten the dose turning from
[1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:32.920]  a public health must to a potential fast track to doing just about anything. Access to sports and
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:38.360]  entertainment venues, restaurants, travel, just to name a few. What is a very promising approach
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:46.280]  to successfully promoting vaccine reopening society, increasing freedom for many Americans.
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:51.720]  The moment of freedom for you is when you get vaccinated, when you reach the two week mark.
[1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:55.400]  These are people who otherwise might not be vaccinated. So let's give them that incentive.
[1:50:55.400 --> 1:51:00.280]  People should require friends to be vaccinated, to attend the barbecues and the birthday parties
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:06.280]  they host. If we want to convince the unvaccinated to do their part is the best approach to show them
[1:51:06.280 --> 1:51:12.440]  those who have had their shots, are still wearing masks, or would displays of our foregone freedoms
[1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:19.320]  in a pre COVID world be more effective messaging. That's the carrot. The city of Chicago also unveiling
[1:51:19.320 --> 1:51:24.440]  plans for what they call that relax. That means that residents that have been vaccinated could
[1:51:24.440 --> 1:51:28.440]  receive incentives like free haircuts and even manicures.
[1:51:32.040 --> 1:51:35.560]  So they lock you up, teach you to be prisoners. And then once you come out the whole world's
[1:51:35.560 --> 1:51:42.040]  a prison planet. Got a website called prisonplanet.com. That's their plan. Vax pass access to freedom
[1:51:43.080 --> 1:51:48.920]  is slavery. Let's let's add that to the headline access to freedom is creation of prison plan.
[1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:57.320]  Now, the show was called peep shows prison for the BBC, but it did air some on MTV.
[1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:02.120]  And so this is probably 20 years old. But here's a parallel on the Nazis not knowing they were the
[1:52:02.120 --> 1:52:07.000]  bad guys until very, very late in the war. And the Democrats and the globalist think they're
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:12.440]  the good guys until they find out it's really all a giant lie. And it only gets more authoritarian
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:16.920]  the more they submit. But most of them again have Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness.
[1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:21.880]  They cannot admit they're in trouble. That is the hallmark of a sheep or a slave. Here it is.
[1:52:21.880 --> 1:52:29.160]  Very well. They're coming. Now we'll see how these Russians deal with a crack SS division.
[1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:36.200]  Hands. Have courage, my friend. Yeah.
[1:52:38.040 --> 1:52:41.880]  Hands, I've just noticed something. These communists are all cowards.
[1:52:41.880 --> 1:52:52.040]  Have you looked at our caps recently? Our caps. The badges on our caps. Have you looked at them?
[1:52:53.160 --> 1:53:02.840]  No, a bit. They've got skulls on them. Have you noticed that our caps have actually got
[1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:11.880]  little pictures of skulls on them? Hands. Are we the baddies?
[1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:18.680]  We should be able to hold them at this point here, at least for a few hours.
[1:53:19.320 --> 1:53:26.680]  Then why skulls then? Why skulls? Well, maybe they're the skulls of our enemies.
[1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:34.040]  Maybe. But is that how it comes across? He doesn't say next to the skull, you know,
[1:53:34.040 --> 1:53:38.440]  yeah, we killed him, but trust us, this guy was horrid. Well, no.
[1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:42.600]  Now, again, this is a silly little piece. Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate you.
[1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:47.000]  Just type in billionaires meeting a secret to stop overpopulation. They want world government.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:50.040]  They want to track you with all these new world government systems from the UN.
[1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:56.040]  They're totally ruthless. They're tied to Jeffrey Epstein. But we're just going to submit to them.
[1:53:56.040 --> 1:53:59.400]  I'm going to go to break. I want to remind all the listeners again, we have one more day
[1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:03.560]  of Ultimate Turmeric Formula at 50% off because I've been so busy. I didn't cut ads this morning

[1:56:46.760 --> 1:56:49.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:57.880]  Tom Pepper knocked it out of the park co-hosting or filling in for Owen Shroyer showing the
[1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:04.520]  War Room, breaking down Bill Gates who's part of it. Back to the War Room, we are now in the third
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:10.680]  hour of the broadcast. The crew is getting way too into the Emperor-Paperteen thing. I've been
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:16.760]  christened by Alex Jones and now I guess I am a Sith Lord. The irony is I'm not even big into
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:22.840]  Star Wars. But Alex Jones will be here in just a few minutes, potentially any second now. I've
[1:57:22.840 --> 1:57:28.360]  just been informed in the break that apparently Bill and Melinda Gates, this was widely expected
[1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:34.360]  by body language experts who say they look at all the videos of them on top of each other and
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:40.120]  they say that it seems incredibly forced, incredibly fake. And so one must wonder exactly
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:44.840]  how long has this marriage been political? Again, they have the Bill and Melinda Gates
[1:57:44.840 --> 1:57:49.640]  Foundation together. You do have to wonder, have they liked each other in the past 20 years? Did
[1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:54.440]  they ever like each other? Is it an Amazon situation where she's married to the money and
[1:57:54.440 --> 1:58:00.680]  that just happens to mean that she has to shill for vaccines and circumcising Africans to prevent
[1:58:00.680 --> 1:58:06.520]  them from having kids? Is it just I want the money so therefore I have to be married to this
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:11.800]  evil little psychotic Gremlin demon monster who goes around lecturing the American people
[1:58:11.800 --> 1:58:18.680]  about how to live their lives? You do have to wonder and the most remarkable thing about Bill Gates
[1:58:18.680 --> 1:58:24.600]  is that of course he was reviled. He was one of the most hated public figures in the United States
[1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:31.240]  in the 1990s. He was perceived as a scammer. The big joke was he gives you a computer and then he
[1:58:31.240 --> 1:58:36.280]  programs a virus so you have to buy his anti-virus software. And of course some people have made
[1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:41.000]  the same allusion to what's happening with the COVID-19 scam demo, which more and more people
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:46.120]  are saying came from a Chinese lab. And the only thing I could say is couldn't they come up with
[1:58:46.120 --> 1:58:52.840]  something a little more scary? But then in the early 2000s, Bill Gates, all of a sudden every
[1:58:52.840 --> 1:58:59.640]  globalist media outlet in the country started rehabbing his reputation. And he gave a bunch of
[1:58:59.640 --> 1:59:04.440]  money to charity. Then he started the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and gave even more money
[1:59:04.440 --> 1:59:10.200]  to his own foundation. And suddenly this guy who was one of the most hated tech entrepreneurs,
[1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:17.640]  tech wizards in Silicon Valley and in the country, all of a sudden he became a wonderful human being
[1:59:17.640 --> 1:59:23.160]  who we should all worship and idolize and we should give him deference. And he knows what's
[1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:29.240]  best for us. You see, Bill Gates has it all figured out. This creepy little psychotic
[1:59:29.240 --> 1:59:35.880]  gremlin. He knows how to live. He knows how to organize society. And you don't. You're just a
[1:59:35.880 --> 1:59:41.400]  little peon compared to this man. And it was just weird thinking back about how this guy's public
[1:59:41.400 --> 1:59:49.240]  persona got revved up to 11 in the early 2000s. Only so now with the COVID-19 scam, Demek,
[1:59:49.240 --> 1:59:57.080]  he could take his rightful place as the propagandist, the chief propagandist for the vaccine and for
[1:59:57.080 --> 2:00:02.040]  the lockdowns and everything else. And so again, if you're just tuning in, we've got the article
[2:00:02.040 --> 2:00:07.000]  up at National File. I'm sure it's up at Infowars as well. Everybody has it. Bill and Melinda Gates,
[2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:12.920]  the billionaire couple who have used their fortune to push a globalist agenda, have announced they
[2:00:12.920 --> 2:00:21.560]  are set to divorce after 27 years of marriage. They met at Microsoft 27 years ago, started the
[2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:29.720]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in the year 2000 and have been pushing vaccines, pushing all
[2:00:29.720 --> 2:00:35.400]  kinds of insanity. There's Bill Gates rocking like a sociopath as he claims. And of course,
[2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:40.280]  look who else he looks like. And he claims that he doesn't know what the English language means.
[2:00:40.280 --> 2:00:46.440]  This guy, they brought him up and he had to testify before Congress for antitrust violations.
[2:00:46.440 --> 2:00:52.920]  That was 20 years ago. And now the media adores him. He is their favorite human being. There he
[2:00:52.920 --> 2:00:59.800]  is dancing, I believe, to some classic rock song trying to look normal, desperately trying not to
[2:00:59.800 --> 2:01:04.040]  look like the little psychotic gremlin demon monkey he is. So don't go away. We will have
[2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:09.080]  Alex Jones very, very soon to give his reactions to the stunning announcement that he and his
[2:01:09.080 --> 2:01:15.160]  political life are ending it, ending their marriage after 27 years of pushing vaccines
[2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:20.920]  together. What will they do? What will the media do without America's favorite couple? I think that
[2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:27.160]  more airtime was devoted to Melinda Gates in 2020 than Melania Trump, the first lady of the United
[2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:32.120]  States. There's Alex Jones in studio. We'll be right back with his reaction on the other side.
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:37.000]  Don't go away. You were watching The War Room. I'm Tom Pappert, about to be joined by the one
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:41.240]  and only Alex Jones. Okay, so I thought that was a little five-minute rant he did at the
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:46.040]  start of the third hour yesterday, filling in for Lawrence Royer, who is back today. But I tell you,
[2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:50.040]  Pappert gives it to myself and I want to run for the money. He is a smart cookie.
[2:01:51.480 --> 2:01:57.560]  Alex Jones here with some really good news. Four of our best selling products are back in stock.
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:02.360]  Four of these bad boys that will enrich your life and, of course, funding it forward.

[2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:28.360]  because I can't and through can't because used to Google was so good, even stuff 10 years old,
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:33.320]  15 years old would come up. Now, they just put their propaganda no matter what the subject is
[2:03:33.320 --> 2:03:41.640]  on top. It's worth it. The big establishment sites and news sites flood everything with really
[2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:50.520]  corrupt level machine learning search engine optimization where their propaganda is in
[2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:56.600]  full bloom. You've got to dig to find the truth now. But I remember it was in the ABC news of
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:04:01.240]  Australia. My memory is pretty good. I was eating a Reuben sandwich. I'm going to break
[2:04:01.240 --> 2:04:13.080]  a piece of my mouth. Sorry. Driving me crazy. Sorry, I'm back here. Alex Jones show. It was a
[2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:21.080]  major vaccine company and there was an anti-vaxxer doctor that was exposing SIDS sudden death
[2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:27.240]  infant syndrome because the Australian courts found that SIDS was kids dying from vaccines.
[2:04:27.240 --> 2:04:30.680]  And then they would just say, oh, they must have suffocated when babies have always slipped
[2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:34.280]  on their faces. That's their favorite way to sleep, mold up like a little bug.
[2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:40.120]  And so it came out in the Australian courts. So they were really pissed about this and they said,
[2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:45.320]  you know, a leaked email that came out via a lawsuit, we ought to just kill this doctor.
[2:04:46.040 --> 2:04:49.880]  They said we ought to neutralize them and they emailed back and they said, what do you mean?
[2:04:49.880 --> 2:04:55.640]  Well, I mean, kill them. So these big pharma companies are the most ruthless scumbags ever.
[2:04:55.640 --> 2:05:02.680]  But it's like Frank Luntz, who I guess is roommates with those kind of Republicans,
[2:05:03.480 --> 2:05:09.080]  most Republicans at that level or that, the type of grown men that live together. I mean,
[2:05:09.080 --> 2:05:13.080]  nothing against the fact that they obviously love each other a lot or good friends. That's
[2:05:13.080 --> 2:05:19.240]  why Kevin McCarthy, I mean, look, John Boner, Boehner, Kevin McCarthy, they're all neocon
[2:05:19.240 --> 2:05:23.800]  globalists bought and paid for. They got put into the house leadership because they're compromised.
[2:05:23.800 --> 2:05:34.200]  Okay. And so the fact that Frank Luntz is a weirdo pervert obsessed with Bill Clinton's
[2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:40.120]  furniture, but he had sex with women on. He has it in his bedroom. He gives tours of Bill Clinton
[2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:45.080]  used to sit on this and here's Bill Clinton's cigar box that he had Monica Lewinsky with. I mean,
[2:05:45.080 --> 2:05:49.800]  it's really gross. So that's the type of weirdo perverts we're dealing with. That's a whole
[2:05:49.800 --> 2:05:54.040]  separate issue that they're roommates. Okay. And if they share a marital bed, I mean, you know,
[2:05:54.040 --> 2:05:57.800]  that's legal in DC, they should get married. But look, I'm not saying they're Marco Rubio
[2:05:57.800 --> 2:06:01.480]  at bubble parties. That's a joke. Okay. The point is, is that, is that
[2:06:04.840 --> 2:06:12.360]  the issue here is that he lobbied to demonize those dying from OxyCotin and said that this is
[2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:17.880]  not an issue of addiction. It's an issue of abuse. When the company that he worked for
[2:06:17.880 --> 2:06:23.080]  designed OxyCotin to addict people, and then they had a drug later, they were going to give them
[2:06:23.080 --> 2:06:28.040]  to get them off the addiction. And you know what OxyCotin did to Rush Limbaugh and it killed
[2:06:28.040 --> 2:06:35.640]  probably millions of people. They asked him, so that's the type of scum we're talking about with
[2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:42.600]  big pharma. And they're all just weirdos, ladies and gentlemen. If you think I'm joking, that was
[2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:49.480]  not joking about Frank Luntz having a model of the Oval Office at his house and then the Lincoln
[2:06:49.480 --> 2:06:54.440]  bedroom is next door to it where he has his business meetings and he's bragging, look,
[2:06:54.440 --> 2:07:00.280]  this is the couch that Bill Clinton had and this is his cigar case. Oh, he touched this. Oh,
[2:07:01.400 --> 2:07:06.120]  and then you learn Kevin McCarthy rents a room from him at his house.
[2:07:06.120 --> 2:07:13.560]  Look at Frank Luntz. He looks like Brian Skelter. I mean, look, I'm not saying Frank Luntz is a
[2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:19.560]  pedophile, okay? I'm just saying, if I was going to cast somebody for a Hollywood movie of, say,
[2:07:19.560 --> 2:07:24.200]  guys that kidnap kids, if I was going to make a movie about Penn State and about Sandusky
[2:07:24.200 --> 2:07:30.600]  and his assistants, I would hire Frank Luntz and I would hire Brian Skelter to play the part of
[2:07:30.600 --> 2:07:36.200]  child kidnappers. I mean, I'm just saying that's my choice as a director. I think they look very
[2:07:36.200 --> 2:07:42.040]  believably scary. I think James Carville looks like a pedophile. I'm not saying James Carville is a
[2:07:42.040 --> 2:07:53.800]  pedophile. I am saying that I would also hire one of the Podesta brothers, the one that was in the
[2:07:53.800 --> 2:08:01.560]  2007 Wall Street Journal, saying that he loves little children and then has all these quote
[2:08:03.240 --> 2:08:11.240]  avant-garde rebellious paintings of small children. It tied up being raped and he has a film studio
[2:08:11.240 --> 2:08:16.600]  that he screams, basically he said illegal films in and the Washington Post had a big spread on
[2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:20.920]  how wonderful it is because it was just for DC though, just for the DC paper. Yeah, there's
[2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:27.560]  the children in the dungeons. It's like little Anderson Cooper. It turns out he's actually got
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:33.000]  dungeon showers and all the rest of it down at the bottom. So I'm just saying if I was going
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:40.040]  to cast people to play the part of pedophiles, I would, I don't know, maybe vampires that eat
[2:08:40.040 --> 2:08:45.000]  children, but see, we don't need to talk about fiction. Oh, we got plenty of the real stuff
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:51.640]  coming up here in just a moment. But I digress. Why do I, why do I mention that before, before I
[2:08:51.640 --> 2:08:57.560]  hit this economic list? Well, the reason I hit this is overhead shop, please. This is marcolla.com.
[2:08:57.560 --> 2:09:02.200]  It's also posted on info wars.com and the live show feed area. I suggest you go read it because
[2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:06.360]  I'm not joking. It's the Bill Millenegades Foundation spokespersons saying we want to use
[2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:11.720]  the military and CIA in counterterrorism and we need to arrest all these people when you do more
[2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:17.160]  and frustrate them like they are a foreign enemy. So in all of these other countries, they banned
[2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:22.200]  the Pfizer shot in the Moderna shot in India and China and areas of Europe and the AstraZeneca.
[2:09:22.200 --> 2:09:25.480]  They had to pull one of the main vaccines in Australia because it was giving people false
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:31.960]  positives for HIV because it was the attenuated virus and that is part HIV. It's a welded,
[2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:37.960]  you know, gain of function virus that we know Fauci cooked up at the lab. But the part I forgot
[2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:44.680]  about this is they say in here, anyone saying it came out of Wuhan period, not just that it leaked
[2:09:44.680 --> 2:09:50.840]  or they did it on purpose, which is what even the former director of Redfield of the CDC says
[2:09:50.840 --> 2:10:00.360]  should also be arrested or it says neutralized by the Pentagon. Wow. But see, that shows how far
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:06.120]  out they are. They've already lost the fight. Everybody got neighbors that got died or got
[2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:10.840]  sick from the vaccine. Everybody knows somebody. Everybody got locked out of the nursing home
[2:10:10.840 --> 2:10:15.880]  and then they heard about people dying in there. People now know what I still wear a mask. I thought
[2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:23.800]  I'd be set free once I took the shot. People are really upset. And so the truth is catching up to
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:29.960]  the lie now. But that's actually in this report from the well organized attack partnerships
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:35.640]  have formed that Dr. McCulloch, who I'm going to get on as soon as I can, breaks down and they say in
[2:10:35.640 --> 2:10:41.800]  here, anyone that says there's any adverse reaction, which they admit has gone on, anyone
[2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:51.080]  that says it came out of a lab, anyone that says that is an extremist who must be put on a watch
[2:10:51.080 --> 2:10:59.400]  and must be dealt with as an extremist and that we need to dismantle them and interdict
[2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:05.560]  them and stop them. And it talks about using the Pentagon and the CIA. You've got to go read this
[2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:14.200]  for yourself. But of course, it's for the public. Good, ladies and gentlemen. So I suggest, yeah,
[2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:21.720]  here's the really bad parts. Target counter messaging from the global health community
[2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:29.160]  moved to dismantle anti-vaccine groups in the US via the United Nations federal agencies.
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:35.080]  Efforts must be made. The realm of cybersecurity, law enforcement, public education and international
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:41.160]  relations, a high level interagency task force reporting to the UN Secretary General could
[2:11:41.160 --> 2:11:49.080]  assess the full impact of anti-vaccine aggression and propose tough, balanced measures.
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:11:55.880]  The task force would include experts who have tackled complex global threats such as terrorism,
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:12:01.400]  cyber attacks and nuclear armaments because anti-scientists now approaching similar levels
[2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:07.560]  of peril. It is becoming increasingly clear that advancing immunization requires a counteroffensive.
[2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:17.720]  And they say right here, do not talk about vitamin D or C. You're a terrorist. You don't need those.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:25.080]  It says, don't talk about alternative treatments and don't talk about COVID-19 being an engineered
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:30.840]  virus with gain of function, which everybody admits. Nope, that's terrorism too. Even though
[2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:36.360]  now it's all admitted, they still don't care. They go, we'll just, we'll send in the troops.
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:42.360]  Well, then send them and the troops can take the shots and die too. Burn in hell. Burn in hell, demons.
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:47.560]  I got the economic collapse news coming up for you. That's all I'm going to go down.
[2:12:50.680 --> 2:12:55.880]  Hey, everybody. If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food,

[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:56.920]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with the
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:15:01.400]  globalist attacking humanity of all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:07.400]  a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the
[2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:13.160]  general public doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress, or even
[2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:20.040]  folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really awakening the establishment.
[2:15:20.760 --> 2:15:25.480]  They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared. They're looking for leadership.

[2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:40.280]  but the globalist will target you for it to show people that it's safe to tell the truth
[2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:46.600]  and to take the heat. That's our job. So please keep us on air so we can hit the bar wire,
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:50.920]  so we can be the shock groups in the information war. Fund us at M4SWARE.com.
[2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:57.080]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021. And I just want to say something.
[2:15:57.080 --> 2:16:01.480]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:05.960]  the years. It is truly an answer to prayer. And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you,
[2:16:05.960 --> 2:16:09.720]  the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:14.200]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter. You got red blood.
[2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:19.240]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[2:16:19.240 --> 2:16:23.880]  and sisters together. And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:29.240]  years. And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working into the future. But again, that's
[2:16:29.240 --> 2:16:35.560]  really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your
[2:16:35.560 --> 2:16:39.480]  heart to support us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to
[2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:44.040]  thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done. And just ask
[2:16:44.040 --> 2:16:48.680]  you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you. And hopefully God will touch
[2:16:48.680 --> 2:17:04.600]  your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:48.280]  All right. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Let's hit the really big news. And I don't do this
[2:17:48.280 --> 2:17:53.000]  with pleasure. I'm having to make a lot of preparations myself. You know, there's been a lot
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:59.080]  of major inflation going on with currencies for a long time. And major governments have been able
[2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:04.360]  to hide that by making sure that most of the money didn't actually get into the general public's hands
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:12.280]  where it would then cause increased inflation. And so you've seen inflation in yachts and in
[2:18:12.280 --> 2:18:19.480]  watches and in real estate and in things that the richer part of the world are making money out of.
[2:18:19.480 --> 2:18:26.040]  You've seen huge increases in stock markets. You've seen rigged bond markets. You've seen central
[2:18:26.040 --> 2:18:31.160]  banks buying their own debt at levels. If the chickens come home to roost, they will look like
[2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:36.920]  Weimar Republic, Germany, and then approaching down the road Zimbabwe inflation,
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:44.920]  where it costs a billion dollars for a slice of bread and 10 billion dollars for a loaf of bread.
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:49.400]  And it's all who has the biggest military. It's all who can manipulate everything that ends up
[2:18:49.960 --> 2:18:56.520]  surviving. All the major governments have been in a race to devalue their currencies. The euros
[2:18:56.520 --> 2:19:00.680]  have been devalued. The Chinese currency has been devalued. The Japanese currency has been
[2:19:00.680 --> 2:19:09.160]  devalued. Our currency has been devalued. But now real cracks in the facade are coming in because
[2:19:10.040 --> 2:19:15.640]  of Trump, when they have the shutdown, the lockdown, saying, okay, get money in people's hands and
[2:19:15.640 --> 2:19:19.720]  keep the economy going. The answer was don't have the lockdown, don't have the shutdown,
[2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:23.880]  don't go along with it. But Trump went along with the least part of it until he figured it out.
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:34.440]  And then the chain reaction of paying people, and this is the key, to not work with more money in
[2:19:34.440 --> 2:19:41.880]  the supply means people were buying more things, but there were less things. And so if that didn't
[2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:47.000]  cause inflation on its own, because they were over printing money, the fact that there's scarcity
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:52.760]  always makes prices go up as just a function of supply and demand. So you add those two factors
[2:19:52.760 --> 2:19:57.800]  together. And so many people, I mean, I've got a great crew, but I had some people never wanted
[2:19:57.800 --> 2:20:02.440]  to come back to work after the shutdown. They never came back. And I know a lot of people now
[2:20:02.440 --> 2:20:06.680]  say their businesses are falling apart. No one wants to come back. One person in a warehouse
[2:20:06.680 --> 2:20:09.800]  didn't even get sick, but there's a COVID test. Oh, we got to shut the whole warehouse down.
[2:20:10.760 --> 2:20:15.080]  So now they're saying this summer, currently they're going to have about a third less fuel
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:20.840]  than we had the summer before the lockdown. And so they're saying there'll be gas shortages
[2:20:20.840 --> 2:20:24.600]  that's already happening across the country. So see, that's how this works.
[2:20:25.800 --> 2:20:31.640]  Less people want to go to work. Productivity goes down. Supply chain breaks down. There's more
[2:20:31.640 --> 2:20:38.280]  currency to buy more things. People are trying to buy more things. And it accelerates the inflation
[2:20:38.280 --> 2:20:44.840]  because then people jack up prices, because you have to. Let me explain that. If I can get plenty
[2:20:44.840 --> 2:20:50.280]  of bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, it's a big head, 95% humanoid, people take it,
[2:20:50.280 --> 2:20:53.400]  people already love turmeric. They take this, they go, well, this is the best turmeric I ever took.
[2:20:54.040 --> 2:20:58.920]  It would fund everything. I can't ever get it. Six months later, I get a small supply,
[2:20:58.920 --> 2:21:04.920]  one third of what we ordered. Well, then tomorrow, I said today, but I've been too busy with new
[2:21:04.920 --> 2:21:09.800]  specials, I'll go to full price on it because I got to fund myself. So if I have a limited amount
[2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:14.760]  to fund myself, I've got to sell it for full price because I need that extra money to operate.
[2:21:14.760 --> 2:21:19.480]  And the prices on raw materials have already gone up. So I need more money to buy more.
[2:21:19.480 --> 2:21:24.760]  It's a chain reaction. So a lot of the trucking companies went out of business. A lot of the
[2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:29.880]  people said, hell, I'll just go on a paycheck from the company. And the companies are still
[2:21:29.880 --> 2:21:34.200]  paying out. And so there's not enough truck drivers. And so there's not going to be gas.
[2:21:34.760 --> 2:21:39.160]  There's not timber for houses. There's not farmers are giving up food productions way down
[2:21:40.680 --> 2:21:43.880]  because a lot of people had to slaughter their milk cows because cows produce a lot of milk.
[2:21:43.880 --> 2:21:47.720]  You got to pump the milk. People are like, why are they throwing away millions of gallons of milk
[2:21:47.720 --> 2:21:52.280]  a day? Well, because the cows keep producing it and there's a written trucks to pick it up
[2:21:52.280 --> 2:21:56.680]  and nobody's there to buy it. You have to throw it away. You dump it in the ditch.
[2:21:58.680 --> 2:22:04.120]  We have a complex economy. And when you, it's like a fishing line, you throw out and you
[2:22:04.120 --> 2:22:08.280]  jerk the line the wrong way and it snarls up in a big ball. And now the economy's
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:12.760]  sterled up and they knew this. It's a very complex economy and they shut it down and
[2:22:12.760 --> 2:22:16.680]  all their big companies doubled and tripled their profits. Everybody else went bankrupt.
[2:22:16.680 --> 2:22:19.720]  But everybody was getting a check. So, hey, let's just go drink. You know, look,
[2:22:19.720 --> 2:22:23.000]  I mean, I went on a couple of vacations this year and I just be sitting there in a hot tub.
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:26.760]  Yeah, I'm going bankrupt, but I get a little check. I'm just going to drink and have fun.
[2:22:26.760 --> 2:22:30.680]  Everybody I talked to was being laid off or losing their job, but been given a
[2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:36.200]  severance package. And so we're just waiting to go bankrupt in six months. And now we're a year
[2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:42.360]  later and it's happening. So here's a big article about it from the Von Mies Institute on infowars.com.
[2:22:42.360 --> 2:22:48.920]  Thanks to trillions of easy money, employers can't find enough workers. See, everybody's
[2:22:48.920 --> 2:22:53.000]  sitting on their ass. Klaus Schwab knew they'd do this, thought, oh, the gravy train goes forever.
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:57.880]  No, now you're going to live under a bridge. Took a lot to build this economy. Now it's
[2:22:57.880 --> 2:23:03.960]  cattywampus. If you're tired of bins watching Netflix, there are likely a few restaurants
[2:23:03.960 --> 2:23:11.000]  in your neighborhood who would love to hire you. A job might help with the boredom. And it just goes
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:16.840]  on to say no one can get anyone to even work with extra money, with all this flooded currency that
[2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:23.800]  is going to cause incredible inflation. There's another article, rotten apple, New York as dead
[2:23:23.800 --> 2:23:28.840]  as it was a year ago. And people just aren't coming back and they're keeping it locked down.
[2:23:28.840 --> 2:23:33.960]  And that's how it works. The globalists want to devastate our economy for a decade or so,
[2:23:33.960 --> 2:23:38.280]  then come back and buy it up for pennies on the dollar. Here's another one, Pennsylvania man.
[2:23:38.280 --> 2:23:45.240]  Get to that later. Here's another article. One bank warns soaring food prices will lead
[2:23:45.240 --> 2:23:52.840]  to social unrest. 76% increase in the index of food orders and purchases that have already been
[2:23:52.840 --> 2:23:59.800]  made on crops that are growing now. So in the next five to six months, globally a 76% increase.
[2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:06.920]  I know I keep harping on this, but it's going to cause an explosive amount of crime and civil
[2:24:06.920 --> 2:24:11.560]  unrest. And it just goes on from there. Big live. Biden says $4 trillion infrastructure bill
[2:24:11.560 --> 2:24:15.640]  has overwhelming bipartisan support. Not a single Republican supports it. And only 6%
[2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:19.640]  goes to roads. It's not even infrastructure bill. It won't even do real jobs. It goes to
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:26.360]  transgender studies and black lives matter. And there's incredible footage I'm going to play
[2:24:26.360 --> 2:24:30.840]  coming up of South African armored vehicle carrying cash, revised massive assault, gunshots,
[2:24:30.840 --> 2:24:37.240]  and ramming. Let's look at what a first world economy looks like under communism when we come back.
[2:24:37.240 --> 2:24:44.680]  And it just goes on from there. So they have orchestrated the control collapse of civilization.
[2:24:44.680 --> 2:24:48.840]  It's going to get absolutely crazy. And yes, I'm going to run this till next Wednesday,
[2:24:48.840 --> 2:24:52.680]  and that's the last day they're going to do it. We have the largest supply of high-quality
[2:24:52.680 --> 2:24:56.920]  storeable food, the largest selection recently made. I mean, it's usually like a day or two
[2:24:56.920 --> 2:25:01.000]  old. That's how well-packaged it is and how fresh it is. Ready to ship to you from one of five

[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:39.640]  eight days until it goes back to regular price. It's still a great deal. And believe me, soon
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:43.880]  there'll be runs on it. There'll be lines. There'll be waits to get it within six months, we believe.

[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:20.680]  Everything we've talked about has been proven accurate. Everything you warned your friends
[2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:24.840]  and family about is about to be true. So, it's now that your credibility is way up.
[2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:31.160]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't. But it's up to all of us
[2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:38.520]  to not let them silence any of us. We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and
[2:26:38.520 --> 2:26:44.280]  setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:47.400]  dark night doesn't come. So, be in the hall of ears you are.
[2:26:51.720 --> 2:26:56.600]  Fourteen months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses,
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:27:01.560]  the third world dies. We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving
[2:27:01.560 --> 2:27:07.640]  parts that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate
[2:27:07.640 --> 2:27:12.360]  the third world and really hurt the first world. Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all
[2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:16.600]  over the United States. And that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that
[2:27:16.600 --> 2:27:21.560]  can barely get the job done before delivering gas had been shut down. Plus, the Keystone pipeline
[2:27:21.560 --> 2:27:27.080]  has been shut down along with other pipelines. The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:32.120]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:36.680]  total slave. The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed. Until you wake up,
[2:27:36.680 --> 2:27:41.480]  and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope. They're announcing that
[2:27:41.480 --> 2:27:46.920]  there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer. So they told you that you're
[2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:53.320]  under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family. This entire new world order
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:27:59.560]  system is about making you dependent, making you obsolete, making you a domesticated animal they
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:04.280]  control. They want to censor you. They want to dumb you down. They want to poison you. And they want
[2:28:04.280 --> 2:28:10.360]  to control your ability to take care of yourself. Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund
[2:28:10.360 --> 2:28:15.720]  the Info War more than ever. And you can do it while at the same time protecting yourself
[2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:21.080]  and your family and your neighbors. We have the biggest best storeable foods company in the world
[2:28:21.080 --> 2:28:26.840]  that has high-quality food in huge warehouses across the U.S., five of them, ready to ship to

[2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:58.120]  your food now. 170 years ago, the British royal family financed scientists who developed a plan
[2:28:58.120 --> 2:29:03.480]  for scientific dictatorship worldwide. That grew into the robber barons and then into the eugenics
[2:29:03.480 --> 2:29:07.640]  movement, Hitler, and of course, the rest is history. Our film, in-game blueprint for global
[2:29:07.640 --> 2:29:13.000]  enslavement, has been censored on Amazon and many other big platforms. Sending the documentary film
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:18.360]  back to the top of the charts, it's been selling online for as much as $300 a copy. Ladies and
[2:29:18.360 --> 2:29:23.480]  gentlemen, I have mass produced it again in the highest quality HD. It is available after not being
[2:29:23.480 --> 2:29:30.040]  available for years at infowarsstore.com. We're selling it for $14.95 for one copy as low as $3.95
[2:29:30.040 --> 2:29:34.680]  when you buy them in bulk to share with your friends and family. And every DVD has a zero
[2:29:34.680 --> 2:29:39.640]  country code, meaning you can burn copies of it anywhere in the world. I'm asking you to.
[2:29:39.640 --> 2:29:44.920]  I'm begging you to. This film predicted the great reset, the new order takeover, the fake virus,
[2:29:44.920 --> 2:29:49.880]  and so much more. That's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever. Get it today at
[2:29:49.880 --> 2:30:00.840]  infowarsstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:30:00.840 --> 2:30:20.360]  Well, welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I am really glad that Roger Stone was able to join us
[2:30:20.360 --> 2:30:35.960]  today because we are dealing with the weaponization of the Justice Department against all of the
[2:30:35.960 --> 2:30:46.760]  people that in any way at any level are criticizing the system. And it is extremely,
[2:30:46.760 --> 2:30:54.120]  extremely dangerous. So, again, Roger Stone joins us. I'm very thankful he's able to join us.
[2:30:54.120 --> 2:30:59.000]  Look at what's already on my plate today. Do you see this? The disinformation doesn't.
[2:31:01.240 --> 2:31:07.800]  Why platforms must act on 12 leading online anti-vaxxers, including Dr. Joseph Merkola,
[2:31:07.800 --> 2:31:13.960]  a medical doctor, now being threatened with death if he doesn't take down papers about vitamin C,
[2:31:13.960 --> 2:31:21.480]  vitamin D, and zinc, which is on the NIH's own website. You have to have that or you die.
[2:31:21.480 --> 2:31:27.960]  Here's another one. New York Times, NBC, and WAPO retract claim that FBI warned Rudy Giuliani
[2:31:27.960 --> 2:31:34.280]  he was target by Russian influence. Oh, yes, the fact that Biden was doing corrupt stuff in Ukraine,
[2:31:34.280 --> 2:31:40.360]  that was a Russian lie. Biden didn't get on C-span at the CFR and say that he had the prosecutor
[2:31:40.360 --> 2:31:47.640]  fired investigating Hunter and he. No, he did. And so in this report that I have right here,
[2:31:49.640 --> 2:31:54.920]  Dr. Merkola, it's posted on infowars.com, talks about why he's pulling his articles about vitamin
[2:31:54.920 --> 2:32:05.240]  D, C, zinc, and COVID-19. And he quotes this document that says everyone, this is put up with
[2:32:05.240 --> 2:32:10.440]  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation spokesperson, that criticizes vaccines, questions vaccines,
[2:32:10.440 --> 2:32:15.720]  or talks about alternative treatments to COVID, needs to have the military shut them down or
[2:32:15.720 --> 2:32:20.120]  frustrate them. And then we have Biden and Saki and all of them saying, we're going to use the
[2:32:20.120 --> 2:32:25.880]  military on Trump supporters now. And you have all these people in dungeons that were nonviolent at
[2:32:25.880 --> 2:32:31.480]  the Capitol in solitary confinement, even Elizabeth Warren has said it's wrong, not being released for
[2:32:31.480 --> 2:32:35.880]  three months plus. And then you've got people that weren't even in the Capitol, like Nick Pointes
[2:32:35.880 --> 2:32:40.760]  on no fly list. And you've got Roger Stone, SWAT team, and you've got them now the Justice
[2:32:40.760 --> 2:32:48.520]  Department suing him. This is the persecution. And they say anti-vaxxers are extremist. So it's
[2:32:48.520 --> 2:32:53.320]  not enough to censor doctors off the internet. When they talk about the lies of COVID and the
[2:32:53.320 --> 2:32:59.400]  fraud and the PCR test, they're attacked. So Roger, I was already going to bring this up to you. I
[2:32:59.400 --> 2:33:03.000]  originally had you on about you and General Flynn and the great stuff you're doing and also some
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:10.680]  Trump news, but you wanted to get into this. And that's exactly what I wanted to ask you about.
[2:33:10.680 --> 2:33:19.880]  FISA court doc shows FBI looked for domestic terrorist without warrants report.
[2:33:22.440 --> 2:33:28.120]  Now that's illegal. And they were in Giuliani's, iCloud illegally, army reviewing investigation
[2:33:28.120 --> 2:33:34.120]  to Michael Flynn's dealings with Russia. They brought that back out. So this is a thousand
[2:33:34.120 --> 2:33:39.240]  times what Nixon dreamed of, 10,000 times what McCarthy did. I mean, this is real.
[2:33:40.040 --> 2:33:44.280]  As Alan Dershowitz said, this is real banana Republic stuff. Any way you slice this, this is
[2:33:44.280 --> 2:33:49.160]  totally illegal. Give us your take on it and what America should do in the face of this onslaught.
[2:33:51.080 --> 2:33:55.560]  Well, Alex, first of all, I want to thank the folks at Big Daddy Unlimited who allowed us to
[2:33:55.560 --> 2:34:00.600]  jump into the last minute and use their terrific broadcast facilities so that I could speak to
[2:34:00.600 --> 2:34:06.040]  you. These folks are strong supporters of the Second Amendment. They're revolutionizing the
[2:34:06.040 --> 2:34:11.800]  online gun store. They're good solid Americans. They're huge fans of info wars. And they were
[2:34:11.800 --> 2:34:17.000]  kind enough to let us jump into their studio today. So now let's get to the topic. You know,
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:23.720]  there's a long history of governmental abuse of some of these agencies. Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[2:34:23.720 --> 2:34:29.720]  used the IRS very aggressively to harass his political opponents. There's a great memo that
[2:34:29.720 --> 2:34:34.520]  Robert Kennedy as Attorney General wrote to his brother, talking about how to use the IRS to
[2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:42.680]  harass the Chamber of Congress and other pro free enterprise organizations. Joe Biden as a Senate
[2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:49.000]  Judiciary Committee chairman tried to use his power to lean on the IRS, pardon me, to harass
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:55.240]  conservatives. But this, this has come to an entire new level. First of all, you have the army
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:02.120]  under Joe Biden announcing that they're going to reopen investigations into General Mike Flynn
[2:35:02.120 --> 2:35:08.360]  and his contacts with the Russians and his contact, his other foreign contacts. But that's
[2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:13.560]  a little strange because Robert Mueller had unlimited legal power, an unlimited budget,
[2:35:13.560 --> 2:35:19.880]  a six or 700 lawyers working for him, and he could find nothing against this great American
[2:35:19.880 --> 2:35:27.000]  Patriot. Then at six o'clock in the morning, as we all saw, not shocking for me, they raided the
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  president of the United States personal attorney's home and office, Rudy Giuliani, to take his
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:38.360]  electronic devices, to take all of his records, except for one, they weren't interested in the
[2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:45.720]  hard drive that pertained to the misconduct of Hunter Biden. They left that behind. And of course,
[2:35:45.720 --> 2:35:54.280]  as you pointed out, after their failure to roll me up in the phony witch hunt 1.0, the Russian
[2:35:54.280 --> 2:36:00.760]  collusion hopes, they've now come back and are suing me for interest and penalties in a civil
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:06.760]  suit for taxes that I have already paid off with an extraordinary effort over a three year period.
[2:36:06.760 --> 2:36:14.600]  This is political harassment of the opponents of the of the Biden administration. This is
[2:36:14.600 --> 2:36:19.960]  a misuse of our justice. And it's only accelerating. I mean, how bad do you think it's going to get?
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:24.360]  Because you go on Twitter, all they call for is us to be killed put in prison. They're like a
[2:36:24.360 --> 2:36:29.960]  frothing group of Bolsheviks or something. Yeah, I think people need to understand exactly how this
[2:36:29.960 --> 2:36:37.560]  works. So when anything reaches critical mass on Twitter, for example, confiscate all firearms,
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:46.760]  arrest Alex Jones, or or even crazier stuff, the newsrooms at the New York Times and the Washington
[2:36:46.760 --> 2:36:53.000]  Post, which by the way, there are 2000 reporters now working for the Washington Post. And about 20
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:58.840]  percent of their journalistic output is going into a print newspaper. The other 80 percent of their
[2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:06.760]  propaganda, I mean, their reporting is going online. So they're getting their cues from these fanatics,
[2:37:07.320 --> 2:37:12.040]  from these haters on Twitter. And that's what leads the paper. That's what they send their
[2:37:12.040 --> 2:37:20.360]  investigative reporters out to go look into. It's a it's a vicious chain. But I had had real hopes
[2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:27.160]  that the that the Justice Department would go back to having the more traditional role that they
[2:37:27.160 --> 2:37:31.480]  used to have under American presidents and be entirely but they're not. They're using anti
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:35.400]  terrorism to get around things and using this American people what everybody what Democrats
[2:37:35.400 --> 2:37:40.040]  warned up back with the Patriot Act 20 years ago. So this is textbook. And like I said,
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:45.960]  they're even saying use it on medical doctors that talk about vitamin D. I spent hours covered.
[2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:51.640]  They say use the CIA, use the military, interdict them, shut them down, arrest them. I mean, this
[2:37:51.640 --> 2:37:57.400]  is corporations frothing. It's big corporations are the real fascists here trying to silence us.
[2:37:57.400 --> 2:38:02.360]  This is where are the Republicans? I guess Kevin McCarthy is too busy in the marital bed with
[2:38:02.360 --> 2:38:09.320]  Frank Luntz. Look, it's really extraordinary because they're literally shredding the Constitution.
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:15.400]  They're they're conducting raids with no probable cause. They're ignoring due process
[2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:19.880]  rights. People are being targeted for their political beliefs. They're not being targeted
[2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:25.640]  because they have any evidence of an actual crime. They're being targeted. It's illegal as hell.
[2:38:25.640 --> 2:38:31.080]  And on a scale of one to 10, the tyranny, it's a 10. It is a gigantic, bloody red flag. It's
[2:38:31.080 --> 2:38:38.120]  outrageous. I think you're understanding it. It is. It's a political vendetta, whether it is the
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:44.440]  assault of Matt Gaetz or the attacks, the new attacks on General Flynn or the outrageousness
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:49.400]  of surveilling an official envoy of the president of the United States when he meets
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:55.080]  with a foreign leader. If you look at the list of people that they want to, who are they were,
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:39:00.680]  whose conversations they were surveilling in the Giuliani case, they're all government officials
[2:39:00.680 --> 2:39:06.280]  investigating the misconduct and the corruption of the Biden. They're using the power of the state
[2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:12.200]  to protect their criminal activities. J. Edgar Hoover would be rolling in his grave.
[2:39:12.200 --> 2:39:18.760]  This is well beyond the kind of excesses you had at the FBI in the 60s and 70s. This is just
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:21.480]  taking it to a whole new level. And you know what that means, Roger. Let's talk about when we come
[2:39:21.480 --> 2:39:24.840]  back. When they go this far, they're going to go all the way. And what is all the way when we come
[2:39:24.840 --> 2:39:29.000]  back? And let's talk about Matt Gaetz. If Matt Gaetz was involved in any type of real pedophilia,
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:34.520]  I'd say nail his ass to the wall. I'd say put him in prison. But they never produced anything but
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:40.280]  more BS, more lies, more edited text messages out of context, and no discussion of Alita Express,
[2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:45.480]  no discussion of real pedophilia, no discussion of Tony Podesta, and publicly saying he has
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:52.600]  a pedophile collection of paintings and photos. We'll be right back. CNN has almost no viewers.
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:58.600]  The ADL is reviled and hated across the United States and the world as a pack of anti-free
[2:39:58.600 --> 2:40:02.920]  speech liars. But that doesn't mean that they don't have power, just like the Southern Poverty
[2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:07.400]  Law Center that's just as bad. They represent the globalist, the big power structure that wants
[2:40:07.400 --> 2:40:12.280]  authoritarianism and backs communist China and its death camps, and they back bringing those
[2:40:12.280 --> 2:40:17.400]  similar systems here to America, and they've even officially called the ADL for my arrest
[2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:22.440]  for my speech and for Mark Zuckerberg to be arrested for free speech as well. These are very,
[2:40:22.440 --> 2:40:26.920]  very dangerous times. They don't want us to be on air. You funding our operation is critical.
[2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:32.680]  We make it easy at infowarstore.com with amazing products like water filtration, air filtration,
[2:40:32.680 --> 2:40:37.480]  non-geoma heirloom seats, t-shirts, books, films, and now four of our best selling products sold

[2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:56.840]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with
[2:40:56.840 --> 2:41:02.520]  facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental
[2:41:02.520 --> 2:41:09.080]  condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com. Studies have suggested
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:15.400]  that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:21.160]  levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:28.520]  responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:35.800]  fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:41:35.800 --> 2:41:41.880]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:48.200]  facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself
[2:41:48.200 --> 2:41:55.880]  at infowarstore.com. The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years
[2:41:55.880 --> 2:42:01.080]  has now gone from beta testing to operational. The globalists are out of the open with their
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:06.440]  planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news is we've been working
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:10.760]  and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:15.720]  for this, to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong, we're incredible, and if we're aware
[2:42:15.720 --> 2:42:20.040]  of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance,
[2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:25.000]  we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential,
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:30.360]  and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time supporting info wars by
[2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:34.120]  buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:41.320]  you and your family and they're also funding our operation. infowarstore.com. infowarstore.com
[2:42:41.320 --> 2:42:45.000]  is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:49.960]  are back in like bodies, vaso meats, and others. So get them today at infowarstore.com and I thank
[2:42:49.960 --> 2:42:55.960]  you for being part of the resistance. The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments
[2:42:55.960 --> 2:43:02.680]  on thousands of non-consenting patients. Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men,
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:08.840]  women, and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:14.520]  to lethal, killing many of the test subjects. In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one
[2:43:14.520 --> 2:43:18.840]  of the most important films ever made. Fourteen years ago we tracked and documented the Boulder
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:23.480]  Berg Group's activities and they're planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[2:43:23.480 --> 2:43:27.320]  The film now is more important than ever. When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year,
[2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:32.440]  they banned it. We have it back in print and available now at infowarstore.com. Selling them
[2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:37.320]  as low as $3.95 a piece. We buy them in bulk and there's a zero country code so anywhere on the
[2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:41.240]  planet you can make copies. In fact, I want you to make copies. You are the Paul Revere's.
[2:43:41.240 --> 2:43:49.160]  1776 Worldwide. 1776 Worldwide. In-game blueprint for global enslavement available now at infowarstore.com.
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:44:16.920]  Look, I know the guys that actually trained the FBI and the CIA in close quarters combat.
[2:44:16.920 --> 2:44:21.960]  I'm friends with a bunch of them. They're great guys, combat bench. The average FBI
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:26.280]  assignment a bad person. But the top is rotten and run by the globalists in compromise with the
[2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:31.160]  Communist Chinese. And you already see a couple FBI agents get killed in Florida on that raid on
[2:44:31.160 --> 2:44:37.320]  pedophiles. God bless them. They get killed. So I know they're good FBI agents. Some of them got
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:42.360]  arrested at the Capitol claiming they breached it. They didn't. But I mean, you talk about playing
[2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:49.400]  with fire here, Roger, saying that 12 doctors are terrorists and Bill Gates Foundation wants Joe
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:53.800]  Biden to use the military on them. And then Saki's on TV saying we're going to use the military.
[2:44:53.800 --> 2:44:57.960]  And then Biden says, if you support Trump, you're a white supremacist. And that's terrorism.
[2:44:57.960 --> 2:45:03.160]  I mean, they're saying they're going to do this. And the ADL said arrest Mark Zuckerberg.
[2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:08.600]  And then because he doesn't let us run his Facebook. And then he put the head of the ADL
[2:45:08.600 --> 2:45:15.400]  Greenblatt on the board. And I mean, so I mean, this and then he they talked about arresting me
[2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:21.000]  on at the ADL summit. And I mean, this is scary. It doesn't scare me. And I'm going to hide under
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:26.840]  a table. But man, imagine getting up on TV and saying arrest Alex Jones or arrest Roger Stone.
[2:45:26.840 --> 2:45:32.680]  And and they raid Giuliani, the lawyer of the president. And we're illegal surveilling the
[2:45:32.680 --> 2:45:38.440]  president during the first impeachment. That's a total violation of separation of powers. It's
[2:45:38.440 --> 2:45:44.920]  when the CIA was spying on Dianne Feinstein, it was wrong. This is outrageous, Roger. And then
[2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:50.600]  so let's talk about the remedies to this. And where does it go next? If Congress or the governors
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:56.600]  or somebody doesn't start pushing back on this power grab? Well, first, I think the most important
[2:45:56.600 --> 2:46:01.640]  thing to recognize is that all of this is in violation of our first amendment rights. I mean,
[2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:08.040]  we have an absolute free speech right to express our views, whether it is that the irregularities
[2:46:08.040 --> 2:46:13.720]  and the anomalies in the 2020 election required further examination, or whether you are skeptical
[2:46:13.720 --> 2:46:21.240]  about whether vaccinations are safe, or whether you're opposed to the efforts to stop the online
[2:46:21.240 --> 2:46:27.080]  sale of ammunition, which is currently legal in this country, or you want to stop gun sales or
[2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:32.840]  sales of gun parts, you're allowed to say all of these things. It is your absolute right to express
[2:46:32.840 --> 2:46:40.200]  your opinion. So we are seeing here the surveillance of the framing and the prosecution potentially
[2:46:40.200 --> 2:46:46.280]  of people who've done nothing other than express their opinions, which are contrary to the views
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:51.640]  of the Biden administration. It is really extraordinary. It's really the most radical
[2:46:51.640 --> 2:46:58.040]  thing I've ever seen. And Roger, I totally agree with you. You're always having problems with
[2:46:58.040 --> 2:47:03.240]  your earphones, but that's okay. We're going to use some specially fitted ones. Your suit doesn't
[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:09.640]  look very nice. Sifting gears to Matt Gaetz. I've been attacked by the left. Oh, look,
[2:47:10.200 --> 2:47:16.120]  Jones, the anti-pedophile crusaders supporting Congressman Gaetz. I've seen them try to frame
[2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:23.160]  people before. They say five years ago he didn't know somebody was 17. The guy that is saying all
[2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:28.360]  this is he got in trouble for framing people and reportedly faking people's identities. I know you
[2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:33.000]  know it. I don't know the truth about any of this. I'm simply saying I'm not hearing a word about
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:37.720]  Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gaetz, the leader expressed the Clintons with kidnapped 14-year-old
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:42.920]  girls put into sex slavery, real stuff. I'm not hearing anything about the ongoing pedophile
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:47.880]  rings and the pedestals. I'm not, no, no, I'm hearing about Matt Gaetz all day who's being
[2:47:47.880 --> 2:47:52.840]  targeted and who said he was being blackmailed and he's not being charged. So they get to hold
[2:47:52.840 --> 2:47:57.720]  that evidence over his head. Very, very suspicious. If they got the evidence of what they're saying,
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:04.120]  put it out. But then the women went forward to CNN and said, well, I was 25. He was really nice.
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:08.280]  And there were no underage girls there. A whole bunch of women went forward with
[2:48:08.280 --> 2:48:13.000]  exculpatory evidence for him and the media spun that against Gaetz and went, oh my gosh,
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:19.160]  five years ago, he was having sex with 25-year-old women and drinking whiskey. And once they saw him
[2:48:19.160 --> 2:48:25.720]  maybe take a pill. I mean, again, that's not sex slavery. And if conservatives can't deal with
[2:48:25.720 --> 2:48:31.800]  that, fine, he's a playboy. He never said that he was a perfect guy. In fact, he tried to decriminalize
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:38.920]  drugs. So all I'm saying is, is that they're trying to act like, oh, look, you know, Matt Gaetz
[2:48:38.920 --> 2:48:43.720]  is a pedophile ring runner covering up for the real pedophile rings. That's my issue.
[2:48:45.240 --> 2:48:52.360]  This is particularly annoying because, yes, I did have a brief text correspondence with Joel
[2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:59.240]  Greenberg, who was the elected Seminole County tax attorney. And I did recommend an attorney for
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:05.560]  him. And I did ask that his attorneys write a memo to a prospective potential attorney for him.
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:14.120]  That's not a confession letter, as it was described in Esquire magazine. But they don't talk about
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:18.280]  my also telling Mr. Greenberg that he ought to reach out to the Lord, that he ought to put
[2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:23.800]  himself in God's hands. I sent him proverbs. I sent him Psalms. I sent him the kind of things
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:32.120]  that people sent me when I was in the scope of Robert Mueller. When I was in his crosshairs,
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:38.520]  they don't report any of that. I made this very clear. I had no involvement in this guy's case.
[2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:44.760]  I took not a dime from him. I tried to recommend an attorney. And there's nothing improper here.
[2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:50.040]  I never lobbied on his behalf. But more importantly, I have yet to see an iota,
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:56.840]  a scintilla of actual evidence or proof that Matt Gaetz did anything wrong. I keep reading
[2:49:56.840 --> 2:50:02.920]  the claim, the accusation in the fake news media. But I haven't seen anything that actually
[2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:08.120]  documents that's true other than at this point, the ravings of a guy who's in deep trouble and
[2:50:08.120 --> 2:50:14.360]  will say anything whatsoever that his government torturers are holding over his head to try to
[2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:21.560]  get a more lenient sentence. It's a lynching of Matt Gaetz and it's wrong. Well, let's expand
[2:50:21.560 --> 2:50:27.000]  on that. And that's one reason I wanted to get you on here. I think Matt Gaetz is a good orator.
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:31.240]  He's been against the censorship. He's been pro-gun. He's really a libertarian Republican.
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:35.800]  And I think he's good in Congress. Why does, when they attack him, doesn't he have a press
[2:50:35.800 --> 2:50:41.000]  conference and say, Hunter Biden is in photos naked with his knees, saying he had sex with her?
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:47.560]  We have the diary of Hunter's sister saying Joe used to screw her. We have all the thousands
[2:50:47.560 --> 2:50:51.800]  of photos and videos they confirm of him saying, I work for Chinese intelligence and we have the
[2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:56.200]  audio of it. He should have a press conference and play all that and say, I tell you what,
[2:50:56.200 --> 2:51:02.920]  once you put Hunter in prison and Joe in prison and once you do all that, then you can talk about
[2:51:02.920 --> 2:51:07.800]  five years ago, did somebody snake a 17-year-old in that looked 25 and then we don't even have
[2:51:07.800 --> 2:51:14.120]  any proof of it. It's all BS. So again, that's my issue. Why doesn't Gaetz go on the attack
[2:51:14.120 --> 2:51:18.920]  and talking about the Lolita Express and Bill Gaetz and the Clintons and the Democrats and
[2:51:18.920 --> 2:51:23.240]  the Podestas? Why does he sit there and let them beat the living hell out of him? I'm not saying
[2:51:23.240 --> 2:51:28.200]  he's guilty of something else, maybe, but it doesn't look good. He needs to go on the attack.
[2:51:29.560 --> 2:51:33.560]  I couldn't agree with you more. I do think he's been out there counter-punching,
[2:51:33.560 --> 2:51:40.200]  but I think perhaps we need to take a broader view. If they're going to harass me about my taxes,
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:44.680]  what about Hunter Biden, who took in millions from the Ukrainians and the Chinese? If they're
[2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:51.080]  going to harass Rudy Giuliani about his activities in Ukraine, which I believe to be entirely legal,
[2:51:51.080 --> 2:51:56.040]  what about Hunter Biden's activities in the Ukraine? Why? We even have a press blackout
[2:51:56.040 --> 2:52:01.560]  on that issue. You can't even read about it or hear about it. And now to take that great American
[2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:07.480]  patriot, Michael Flynn, who did nothing wrong and opened up new investigations to plow the ground
[2:52:07.480 --> 2:52:14.360]  that's already been gone over, this is perfectly, in every case, a perfect example of the two-tiered
[2:52:14.360 --> 2:52:19.800]  justice system. One set of justice for Hunter Biden and the Biden family and their cronies
[2:52:19.800 --> 2:52:25.800]  and all Democrats and then anyone else who shares a contrary political view, whether you're a
[2:52:25.800 --> 2:52:33.880]  Republican or a Christian or a libertarian or an info warrior or whether you're a second amendment
[2:52:33.880 --> 2:52:38.600]  enthusiast or collector, you're going to be harassed. You're going to be treated differently.
[2:52:38.600 --> 2:52:44.680]  But these global elites, they are not prosecuted. Tucker Carlson said it last week,
[2:52:44.680 --> 2:52:50.840]  better than anyone. Guys like John Brennan and General Clapper, who lie under oath about the
[2:52:50.840 --> 2:52:56.040]  matters of great consequence to Congress, they go unprosecuted, but they target people.
[2:52:56.040 --> 2:52:59.880]  Clapper said, under oath, the NSA has never spotted an American ever.
[2:53:01.320 --> 2:53:06.360]  He denied that there was any metadata collection program being run by the CIA.
[2:53:06.360 --> 2:53:12.280]  That is a flat out lie. By the way, where is he now? Why, he's teaching ethics at Vermont College
[2:53:12.280 --> 2:53:16.120]  and he has a very well-paid... Where's Hunter Biden? He's going to teach a piece on fake news
[2:53:16.120 --> 2:53:22.440]  down in New Orleans. Well, he's just moved into a $4.5 million house in the Hollywood Hills,
[2:53:22.440 --> 2:53:27.320]  so he seems not to be hurting for cash. And yeah, he's going to go to Tulane in New Orleans to talk
[2:53:27.320 --> 2:53:34.600]  about ethics and the fake news media. They haven't announced the date of that yet, but I'm thinking
[2:53:34.600 --> 2:53:39.400]  going down maybe taking in his lecture. I wonder if they'll give lessons on their weird pedophile
[2:53:39.400 --> 2:53:44.440]  family where they all have sex with each other. It is. It's very strange, but where can you read
[2:53:44.440 --> 2:53:50.200]  about any of that in the mainstream media? We have a media blackout going on where they take
[2:53:50.200 --> 2:53:57.320]  and they manufacture misconduct about anybody who's an opponent, screaming in their headlines,
[2:53:57.320 --> 2:54:03.720]  complete falsehoods, yet they shield Hunter Biden and other Democrats from any scrutiny whatsoever.
[2:54:04.280 --> 2:54:07.640]  All right, let's do five more minutes ahead of Paul Joseph Watson taking over. Stay there. We'll
[2:54:07.640 --> 2:54:12.840]  come back in two minutes to a quick interview, finish up with Roger Stone and then Paul Joseph
[2:54:12.840 --> 2:54:17.320]  Watson as usual. He is loaded for bear. He is going to come out of the gate screaming at six
[2:54:17.320 --> 2:54:21.480]  after. So that's going on. I extended it one day. We'll be over tomorrow. I've just been so busy.

[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:31.960]  That's going to end as soon as I can shoot the new ads. I got super busy with Bill Gates and
[2:54:31.960 --> 2:54:36.760]  his announced divorce last night. I was up until eight o'clock to do a piece on that. But last day
[2:54:36.760 --> 2:54:44.280]  to get ultimate turmeric formula. It was our number two best selling product until the ongoing

[2:56:18.040 --> 2:56:23.080]  more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.

[2:56:54.840 --> 2:56:58.680]  finishing up the Alex Jones portion of the transmission. And then for the fourth hour of
[2:56:58.680 --> 2:57:03.720]  the great jestos, Paul Joseph Watson from Herbertanic Magisties London, England.
[2:57:03.720 --> 2:57:08.360]  All right, you and Flynn have been giving some big speeches, getting a lot of coverage saying,
[2:57:08.360 --> 2:57:13.000]  hey, stay active Trump supporters, stay in the fight. I think it's great to have Trump out there
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:17.160]  trying to keep people energized, trying to get folks elected. We know whoever Trump supports
[2:57:17.160 --> 2:57:23.320]  ends up winning these primaries and in these other special runoffs. But we need to have Flynn
[2:57:23.320 --> 2:57:27.880]  ready to go. And a few other folks, I know Tucker says he isn't going to run and I believe that. But
[2:57:27.880 --> 2:57:33.160]  I mean, who do we have as prospects? Because we need somebody to be leading the opposition. So
[2:57:33.160 --> 2:57:39.720]  Kevin McCarthy and his boyfriend or whatever he is his roommate, Frank wants to run the party.
[2:57:41.400 --> 2:57:45.400]  Well, I was really happy to hear that the president has announced that he's going to begin
[2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:51.000]  doing these giant mega rallies around the country. I think it's an important way to break through
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:57.960]  the mass communication censorship and control blockade. So the president can deliver a withering
[2:57:57.960 --> 2:58:03.160]  critique of the Biden administration and their policies. You know, we used to have a tradition
[2:58:03.160 --> 2:58:09.880]  in this country that former presidents didn't criticize their successors. That ended with
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:16.360]  Barack Obama. And now I think it's more than fair game. What better spokesman to make that
[2:58:16.360 --> 2:58:21.880]  case than Donald Trump himself? If you watched Biden the other day, he said, we have a plan
[2:58:21.880 --> 2:58:29.640]  to rebuild America. He inherited the most robust economy in American history. The greatest rate
[2:58:29.640 --> 2:58:36.040]  of job growth, the greatest rate of wage growth, the lowest levels of unemployment among all Americans
[2:58:36.040 --> 2:58:43.640]  at every subgroup. So what disaster is he talking about? All I've seen are rising gas prices so far.
[2:58:44.360 --> 2:58:48.840]  So this idea that we need to rebuild, no, we need to build on what Trump did. Right now,
[2:58:48.840 --> 2:58:54.200]  he's trying to deconstruct it. Higher taxes he's announced, more regulations. Let's see what that
[2:58:54.200 --> 2:59:00.200]  does to the booming Trump economy that we're still enjoying today. So I think it's very important,
[2:59:00.200 --> 2:59:04.600]  and I know General Flynn is very enthusiastic about the fact that Donald Trump's going to do
[2:59:04.600 --> 2:59:10.600]  what he does best. Hit the road, go to these massive, incredibly entertaining rallies, but
[2:59:10.600 --> 2:59:16.440]  make some very key points that the fake news media just won't cover unless, of course,
[2:59:16.440 --> 2:59:21.880]  a former president makes them. In which case, it's very hard for them not to cover it.
[2:59:21.880 --> 2:59:25.640]  Two and a half years ago when the campaign season was cracking up, you and I were on the air saying
[2:59:25.640 --> 2:59:29.880]  he's clearly had another stroke. That's a real photo on screen. I mean, he sees a finger like
[2:59:29.880 --> 2:59:34.360]  a turtle for a carrot. He starts biting at it. He is on another planet most of the time,
[2:59:34.360 --> 2:59:37.560]  unless he's reading off a teleprompter. How long can this charade go on?
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:44.440]  Well, I think it's painfully obvious to the American people. You now have foreign leaders
[2:59:44.440 --> 2:59:49.240]  beginning to complain about it. Look, I don't wish Joe Biden any ill will. I don't issue
[2:59:49.800 --> 2:59:54.840]  poor health. I don't wish that he have an early demise. He's the president of the United States.
[2:59:55.400 --> 3:00:01.320]  I'm a Christian and I pray for the success of him and our country. But the man does not look well
[3:00:01.320 --> 3:00:08.440]  to me. And I think it is getting more and more obvious to people that he's not running the country.
[3:00:08.440 --> 3:00:14.120]  As we said right here on this program a week ago, Ron Klain is former chief of staff and
[3:00:14.120 --> 3:00:20.840]  Susan Rice, the national security advisor in the Obama administration, essentially have a power
[3:00:20.840 --> 3:00:26.680]  sharing relationship in which they are actually running the country. This is my personal belief
[3:00:26.680 --> 3:00:31.960]  that big decisions are probably run by Barack Obama. I totally agree. This is the old Biden or
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:39.560]  O'Harris campaign and presidency. Let me ask you this. Do you think that perhaps Ron Klain
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:44.360]  is also a roommate there at Frank Luntz's house with Kevin McCarthy? No, I'm not going to say
[3:00:44.360 --> 3:00:50.200]  that. I do wonder whether Frank, is that a Danish stapled on his head or is that a two-pay? What is
[3:00:50.200 --> 3:00:54.600]  that? Yeah, yeah, go back to the video. Look, I'm being sarcastic. I'm just saying the Republican
[3:00:54.600 --> 3:00:59.000]  leadership act like they're run by the Democrats. And I mean, maybe we know now what's going on.
[3:01:00.680 --> 3:01:05.400]  Well, look, this has been important because I think we have to expose the way they are weaponizing
[3:01:05.400 --> 3:01:10.200]  the Justice Department. And Alex, once again, I want to thank the folks at Big Daddy Unlimited
[3:01:10.200 --> 3:01:14.840]  because I'm way out in the field. I didn't want to do this on a cell phone and kind of do get
[3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:19.320]  a lousy transmission. So these folks really stepped in to help us. And I appreciate it.
[3:01:19.880 --> 3:01:25.480]  You're hitting the most important issue today, which is the total political weaponization of our
[3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:31.400]  criminal justice system for solely political purposes. As our friends agree, I'm going to look
[3:01:31.400 --> 3:01:35.480]  up Big Daddy Unlimited. What do they make a bunch of firearms? Yeah, they're good folks. They're
[3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:39.800]  good folks. And we'd like them. And they've been very hospitable here today. All right, Roger,
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:43.800]  we'll talk to you again soon. Thank you, Thought Criminal. That's a full Thought Criminal right
[3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:51.400]  there. All right, Paul Joseph Watson takes over right now. Stay with us. Last week, I had a caller
[3:01:51.400 --> 3:01:56.920]  to my radio slash TV transmission. They said to me, he said, Alex, there's all these facts,
[3:01:56.920 --> 3:02:01.880]  all these numbers of vaccines being recalled and people dying from it and people getting sick.
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:06.440]  How do I reach out to my friends and family and explain to them and to warn them about the danger?
[3:02:07.160 --> 3:02:12.760]  And I said to him something very profound because it's so true. Trust your gut, trust your spirit
[3:02:12.760 --> 3:02:17.400]  with the Bible tells us. And I said, ask those friends, those family, those neighbors,
[3:02:17.400 --> 3:02:22.600]  do you feel good about this vaccine? And his answer was no, they don't feel good about it. So
[3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:27.800]  go with your gut. Well, let me ask you again. How's your gut feel about getting the storeable
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:32.280]  food? How's your gut feel about getting out in the countryside? How's your gut feel about getting
[3:02:32.280 --> 3:02:36.520]  guns and ammo to protect yourself? Well, I know what your gut's telling you. We have the best
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:42.840]  storeable food, the highest quality at the lowest prices you're going to find 10% off at infowarstore.com

[3:02:58.760 --> 3:03:17.880]  the info war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:28.520]  And we all live. It is the summit news hour.
[3:03:34.360 --> 3:03:40.760]  Year plus. What many people are still talking about is when the social distancing, when these mask
[3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:49.160]  mandates, when these corona restrictions will end if ever. And for many Americans, it appears as though
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:56.200]  they think they won't end not just within six months or 18 months, but indeed, indefinitely.
[3:03:56.200 --> 3:04:03.160]  We have a story here up at summit dot news. A new poll out of Rasmussen says 15% of Americans think
[3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:13.080]  mask mandates will remain for years or indefinitely. They asked a selection of Americans when they
[3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:18.200]  thought these restrictions would end. Participants were asked, quote, how much long will Americans
[3:04:18.200 --> 3:04:22.920]  be required to wear masks in public places? They gave them the option less than six months,
[3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:28.120]  six months to a year, at least 18 months for the next couple of years or indefinitely.
[3:04:28.120 --> 3:04:35.160]  Now, it doesn't matter that all the data shows, for example, in Texas and in Florida and in
[3:04:35.160 --> 3:04:40.360]  South Dakota, that when they end these social distancing restrictions, when they end these
[3:04:40.360 --> 3:04:47.000]  mask mandates, the cases go down, the hospitalization rates go down, and the deaths go down. Doesn't
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:54.280]  matter. Fauci just ignores it and says, well, we need a couple of weeks to see how the data
[3:04:54.280 --> 3:05:00.040]  transpires, even though it was a couple of weeks after they ended the mask mandate in Texas back
[3:05:00.040 --> 3:05:06.600]  on March the 10th. Well, now 58% of Americans say they think they'll be required to wear masks in
[3:05:06.600 --> 3:05:13.480]  public for at least another six months. While 25% of that figure believes the mandates will go on for
[3:05:13.480 --> 3:05:20.280]  18 months or longer. And then again, 15% said they thought that they would basically never end
[3:05:20.280 --> 3:05:27.320]  and that you'll be made to wear a mask forever. When the flu returns, of course, the flu virus
[3:05:27.320 --> 3:05:33.160]  miraculously disappeared over the past year, it just vanished into thin air and it totally wasn't
[3:05:33.160 --> 3:05:38.520]  being counted as COVID so they could bump up the numbers. When that returns, and we're going to get
[3:05:38.520 --> 3:05:43.880]  into a philosopher, a lecturer, who is saying basically what we've been saying for months,
[3:05:43.880 --> 3:05:50.520]  that they're going to cite a particularly bad flu season and use that as a justification to
[3:05:50.520 --> 3:05:55.880]  reintroduce all these measures, all these precedents that they've created that by and large everyone
[3:05:55.880 --> 3:06:03.240]  has complied with once there's another flu season. 49% of respondents also said that even
[3:06:03.240 --> 3:06:09.560]  those who are vaccinated should still wear the mask. So the amazing miraculous life saving
[3:06:09.560 --> 3:06:14.920]  vaccination is still not enough for governments to give up this control because they're completely
[3:06:14.920 --> 3:06:20.200]  drunk on power. And in many cases, the citizenry has been worse, of course, in the UK,
[3:06:21.400 --> 3:06:27.080]  where the restrictions are all supposed to end on June 21. Even though the government is literally
[3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:30.520]  saying no, that's not going to happen now, we're going to have mass events, we're going to have
[3:06:30.520 --> 3:06:36.120]  football matches, we're going to have festivals, music concerts where capacity is reduced.
[3:06:36.120 --> 3:06:42.520]  In many cases, it's not the government pushing these more draconian coronavirus restrictions,
[3:06:42.520 --> 3:06:46.840]  of course, they've been strong armed into doing that from the scientific dictatorship that took
[3:06:46.840 --> 3:06:53.320]  over in March 2020. But it's really not the government that's responsible when you have polls
[3:06:53.320 --> 3:06:59.080]  showing that 80% not only want the coronavirus restrictions to continue, and this has been
[3:06:59.080 --> 3:07:05.240]  consistent, at least in the UK over the past six months, they want them to be even more draconian.
[3:07:05.240 --> 3:07:13.320]  And we're going to get onto why that is in the next segment. First, though, let's go to this
[3:07:13.320 --> 3:07:18.840]  daily caller video where they went to DC and asked people when they thought the mask mandate would
[3:07:18.840 --> 3:07:25.000]  end or even if they thought it should ever end. And the results for viewers of this show, particularly,
[3:07:25.880 --> 3:07:28.440]  will be very unsurprising. Let's go to the clip.
[3:07:28.440 --> 3:07:33.640]  Do you think we should wear masks forever?
[3:07:33.640 --> 3:07:38.200]  Indefinitely, absolutely. Absolutely, even if you get the vaccine.
[3:07:38.200 --> 3:07:41.960]  Yeah, I want to see all the world, nobody have masks anymore for them now.
[3:07:44.440 --> 3:07:49.400]  Hey, I'm Lisa with Daily Caller. Today, we were in Washington, DC, asking people whether they
[3:07:49.400 --> 3:07:53.560]  think we should continue to wear masks forever. Let's hear what they say. Do you think we should
[3:07:53.560 --> 3:07:59.960]  be wearing masks forever and ever and ever? I believe so. Definitely, like you see in a bunch
[3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:05.480]  of other countries where they already were wearing masks. I'm an ex-nurse and I agree it's
[3:08:05.480 --> 3:08:11.080]  airborne and we should continue masking until everyone is safe. No, not to worry, I have a permit.
[3:08:11.960 --> 3:08:16.760]  This just says I can do what I want. Like when you're sick and like after you're vaccinated and
[3:08:16.760 --> 3:08:22.280]  stuff, I mean you should still wear one just as common currency. Am I a hero? I really can't say,
[3:08:22.280 --> 3:08:26.600]  but yes. This is inevitable at this point, like you're gonna get it or you don't and people have
[3:08:26.600 --> 3:08:30.840]  had enough with this. Mostly just the currency thing. We're doing God's work. Like I'm nowhere
[3:08:30.840 --> 3:08:34.680]  near anybody, I'm running, I need to breathe, I don't want to pass out from having a mask on my
[3:08:34.680 --> 3:08:38.760]  face. I mean right now at this moment, yeah, we still should be wearing our masks. We need to go
[3:08:38.760 --> 3:08:42.920]  back to normal society. You can't, you know what I mean? You can't keep forcing people down. They
[3:08:42.920 --> 3:08:47.720]  still out there. You're still out there. Who is COVID? Do you think we should wear masks forever?
[3:08:47.720 --> 3:08:54.440]  Oh sure, we should wear masks for protection. If you go to places that have been diligent with
[3:08:54.440 --> 3:09:03.480]  masking, the numbers are way down. No. It is not political. The virus is an aerosol and the mask
[3:09:03.480 --> 3:09:08.760]  helps. This is not human nature. We should, but I think after you get your vaccine, you should be,
[3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:13.880]  you should be fine until everyone's vaccinated, until like more people are vaccinated. Just have
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:19.080]  a little car and be like, I got the vaccine. I don't need the mask no more. Makes me feel young
[3:09:19.080 --> 3:09:25.720]  again. I don't respect for other people that don't get the vaccine yet. I don't believe so. I think
[3:09:25.720 --> 3:09:30.120]  people are going to get vaccinated soon enough. But furthermore, I think if you're young and you're
[3:09:30.120 --> 3:09:36.200]  healthy and you run and you have a good immune system, eventually we've got to move on. Yeah.
[3:09:36.200 --> 3:09:42.760]  For now, it's good to have a mask, keep social distance, sanitize, wash your hands. Just make
[3:09:42.760 --> 3:09:48.200]  sure you're doing your part. Yeah. What's your favorite song to play? How about Abba? Oh yeah,
[3:09:48.200 --> 3:09:53.880]  we like Abba. I love Abba. Abba is my favorite. Really? Have you seen Mama Mia? How do you know
[3:09:53.880 --> 3:09:58.520]  I was about to do that? Yeah, I think as long as the rate of infection is really low and enough
[3:09:58.520 --> 3:10:03.320]  people have access to the vaccine, I think that we could stop and kind of choose situations where
[3:10:03.320 --> 3:10:13.960]  it's appropriate. And also for kids, well, you know that still there are so many things about
[3:10:13.960 --> 3:10:21.480]  kids getting the virus and I think that's for them and also for older people.
[3:10:24.280 --> 3:10:29.160]  We shouldn't be wearing masks for too long. You know, I mean, because I got asthma,
[3:10:29.160 --> 3:10:33.640]  breathing under the mask, it's a hack. You know, I got to take it off sometimes.
[3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:38.200]  Everybody come check them out. You see every day. I'm the man here the most.
[3:10:41.240 --> 3:10:45.800]  So there you saw it. One of the individuals in that video saying, well, if you look at the stats,
[3:10:45.800 --> 3:10:51.160]  the places where the mask mandates have been enforced in the most draconian sense,
[3:10:51.160 --> 3:10:57.080]  their cases have dropped, they plummeted. No, they haven't. It's the exact opposite. South Dakota,
[3:10:57.080 --> 3:11:02.200]  Texas, Florida. If you look at Europe when the mask mandates were introduced last summer,
[3:11:02.200 --> 3:11:07.560]  as soon as they were introduced across the board, including in public, not just going to restaurants
[3:11:07.560 --> 3:11:13.960]  but just out in the public generally. The coronavirus cases shot up. I mentioned a study
[3:11:13.960 --> 3:11:21.880]  last week where it showed that the coronavirus particle itself was a thousand times smaller
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:28.280]  than the biggest gap in the fabric of those stereotypically face masks that people wear
[3:11:28.280 --> 3:11:33.800]  for surgical procedures, you know, the classic blue face mask. The particle is a thousand times
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:40.360]  smaller. It goes straight through. What happened to that study over the course of the past week?
[3:11:40.360 --> 3:11:45.320]  Oh, it's been retracted because the mainstream media came out and attacked it. So now it's
[3:11:45.320 --> 3:11:50.760]  disappeared off the internet because it carried a narrative which they didn't like.
[3:11:50.760 --> 3:11:58.200]  And as I point out in the article, the reason people are so off base with demanding this mask
[3:11:58.200 --> 3:12:03.880]  wearing until infinity is because they've been terrified by government propaganda and they
[3:12:03.880 --> 3:12:09.080]  vastly over exaggerate the threat of the coronavirus. I harp on about this all the time.
[3:12:09.080 --> 3:12:15.080]  There was a poll in August last year which found that on average people in the US thought 9% of
[3:12:15.080 --> 3:12:21.320]  the population which is 30 million people had died from coronavirus when the actual figure at
[3:12:21.320 --> 3:12:29.160]  the time was less than 155,000. That meant that the average American thought COVID-19 had killed
[3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:37.160]  225 times more victims than the actual number of fatalities. They are the victims of social
[3:12:37.160 --> 3:12:43.080]  engineering of mass propaganda and it sent them completely insane and we'll get more into that
[3:12:43.080 --> 3:12:46.040]  on the other side of the break. Summit.News, now go away.
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:19.320]  People are really really awake in the establishment. They don't want to go on with a globalist
[3:13:19.320 --> 3:13:24.200]  but they're scared they're looking for leadership. Well that's where M4 comes in.
[3:13:24.200 --> 3:13:29.640]  You fund us, you support M4.com, you get great products at the same time. We will then go out
[3:13:29.640 --> 3:13:35.400]  and do what the globalist says unpopular but the globalist will target you for to show people
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:41.640]  that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat. That's our job so please keep us on air
[3:13:41.640 --> 3:13:46.040]  so we can hit the barbed wire so we can be the shock groups in the information war.
[3:13:46.040 --> 3:13:51.800]  Fund us at M4store.com. Again I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person but
[3:13:51.800 --> 3:13:55.960]  because of the globalists they're attacking humanity. I've been forced the last 27 years to
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:14:00.520]  be a public figure and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:05.400]  God and I know some of our blisters get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me a break
[3:14:05.400 --> 3:14:10.120]  to Satanism's out in the open. I've always been a Christian but now the fact that it's a fight
[3:14:10.120 --> 3:14:14.600]  between good and evil is so clear and I get it a lot of you've been turned off by big churches,
[3:14:14.600 --> 3:14:19.960]  a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class system and I get it me too believe
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:26.520]  me I'm one of them but it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:31.320]  that is so essential and and God created the universe for us to have communion with God through
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:35.720]  and to have life and so that's what M4 Wars is really all about so thank you all for your word
[3:14:35.720 --> 3:14:39.800]  of mouth thank you for spreading the word about M4 Wars and thank you for supporting us to keep
[3:14:39.800 --> 3:14:44.680]  us on air by visiting infowarstore.com because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases
[3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:47.880]  we'll be taking off the air so thank you for the support infowarstore.com
[3:14:47.880 --> 3:15:16.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show Transmitting Worldwide from the summit.new
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:21.880]  studios in the United Kingdom. You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:15:23.880 --> 3:15:28.360]  And we all back it is the summit news hour we played the clip for the break and keep the
[3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:33.960]  bikes for a second and many of them willing to continue to wear masks forever but the fact
[3:15:33.960 --> 3:15:37.800]  that there's no scientific evidence that they prevent the spread of coronavirus and in fact
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:42.760]  if you look at Texas you look at Florida you look at South Dakota you look at France you look at Spain
[3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:48.760]  as soon as they end those mask mandates the cases go down in many cases as soon as they
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:55.880]  implement them the cases the hospitalizations the deaths go way up oh but the mask isn't a tool
[3:15:55.880 --> 3:16:03.240]  of political oppression it's become a tool of virtue signaling mainly by narcissists to broadcast
[3:16:03.240 --> 3:16:10.600]  the fact that they're good people also by middle-aged carons who look at you as you walk towards them
[3:16:10.600 --> 3:16:17.160]  with an absolute terror in their eyes like your Godzilla or King Kong bounding towards them to
[3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:23.560]  rip their heads off if you get within 10 feet of them and also obviously it's this it's this
[3:16:24.600 --> 3:16:32.440]  attempt to signal high value status it's like oh we're not part of that dirty fringe extremist
[3:16:32.440 --> 3:16:37.960]  belief system that says maybe we shouldn't lock down the economy for a year and cause hundreds
[3:16:37.960 --> 3:16:44.600]  of thousands of job losses which leads to poverty which leads to literal starvation in many cases
[3:16:44.600 --> 3:16:51.640]  in the third world by the way massive numbers of children in the third world dying of malnutrition
[3:16:51.640 --> 3:16:58.200]  because the very precious unstable economies in those countries have collapsed literally brown
[3:16:58.200 --> 3:17:03.640]  kids dying on the street because of these COVID lockdowns oh but if you don't wear a mask then
[3:17:03.640 --> 3:17:09.720]  you're not a good person as we highlighted last month as I explained in this article
[3:17:10.600 --> 3:17:15.480]  despite signs that the coronavirus pandemic is coming to an end health experts are still insisting
[3:17:15.480 --> 3:17:21.800]  that mask mandates remain for the foreseeable foreseeable future but not apparently for Joe
[3:17:21.800 --> 3:17:28.120]  Biden this is the headline out of Breitbart Biden's go maskless during visit with elderly frail carters
[3:17:28.120 --> 3:17:32.840]  says if you want to know what his fraudulency really believes about masks
[3:17:33.480 --> 3:17:39.000]  feast your eyes upon the guy who wore a mask during a zoom call yes he actually did that
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:45.240]  and the media defended it saying he was setting an example and what was the example I'm an idiot
[3:17:45.240 --> 3:17:50.280]  who thinks that wearing a mask during a zoom call is necessary when it just makes you look like a
[3:17:50.280 --> 3:17:57.640]  complete moron so you've probably seen by now this picture of Joe Biden and the first lady
[3:17:57.640 --> 3:18:05.000]  meeting with the elderly frail carters inside and guess what neither of them are wearing a mask
[3:18:05.720 --> 3:18:11.240]  it's so important that Joe Biden in between his coughing fits and his sneezing fits while he's doing
[3:18:11.240 --> 3:18:19.000]  public speeches outdoors wears a face mask but apparently not while he's visiting 93 year old
[3:18:19.000 --> 3:18:27.720]  Rosalind Carter a 96 year old Jimmy Carter a two-time cancer survivor maybe he won't survive for too
[3:18:27.720 --> 3:18:34.600]  much longer unfortunately because Joe and Jill Biden didn't mask up during that meeting oh but
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:39.800]  they're all vaccinated yeah but they tell us people can still spread coronavirus even after
[3:18:39.800 --> 3:18:45.000]  they're vaccinated and that's why you need to continue to wear a mask even if you took the
[3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:51.960]  vaccine but apparently Joe and Jill Biden don't when they're visiting 93 year old and 96 year old
[3:18:52.520 --> 3:19:01.000]  people inside meanwhile swimming pool tells swimmers to exhale underwater not look out
[3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:05.720]  or talk to others and we saw several examples of this back during the first lockdown around a year
[3:19:05.720 --> 3:19:12.280]  ago where not only were people to told you know told to keep their social distance were told to
[3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:20.040]  mask up but they were even told and they literally had signs funded by local government councils in
[3:19:20.040 --> 3:19:26.840]  the UK telling people not to look at others and not to talk to others as they pass them by in the
[3:19:26.840 --> 3:19:32.600]  street well now a lengthy set of COVID-19 rules mandated by the operators of a swimming pool in
[3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:40.680]  London include asking swimmers to exhale underwater as well as not to look at or talk to others this
[3:19:40.680 --> 3:19:48.680]  was tweeted in response to a tweet by the rapper Zubi by an individual who said seen at the pool
[3:19:48.680 --> 3:19:55.080]  this morning and this list of rules tells people quote when you need to rest look away from other
[3:19:55.080 --> 3:20:01.160]  swimmers and maintain social distancing when swimming exhale underwater when you can they
[3:20:01.160 --> 3:20:07.560]  even ban backstrokes and other strokes where social distancing cannot be maintained they're
[3:20:07.560 --> 3:20:13.240]  told to avoid talking to each other and they're told to not look at each other and we've literally
[3:20:13.240 --> 3:20:20.520]  had they see one example no handshaking high-fiving or extended eye contact not allowed to have eye
[3:20:20.520 --> 3:20:27.880]  contact with anyone apparently eye contact also spreads the virus swimmers in Spain were hit
[3:20:27.880 --> 3:20:32.440]  with a similar draconian mandate after the government passed legislation mandating face masks
[3:20:32.440 --> 3:20:38.360]  not just on the beach but while swimming in the sea a bizarre video that emerged earlier this month
[3:20:38.360 --> 3:20:46.280]  also showed a man wearing a face mask yes while swimming underwater this is the level of social
[3:20:46.280 --> 3:20:52.040]  engineering and brainwashing so the extent as I mentioned before that the average american
[3:20:52.040 --> 3:20:59.480]  believes the virus has killed 225 times more people than it actually has and you wonder why
[3:20:59.480 --> 3:21:05.320]  people with lots of terror in their faces will literally jump out of your way leap out of your
[3:21:05.320 --> 3:21:13.080]  way if you come within 10 feet of them on the street meanwhile the telegraph reports and this
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:20.120]  is in the context of the uk apparently opening up on june 21st the government has bestowed upon
[3:21:20.120 --> 3:21:27.960]  as the gracious privilege of being able to sit outside a pub in the freezing cold with up to
[3:21:27.960 --> 3:21:35.000]  six other people and have a pint of beer even as the weather is terrible literally we've got
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:41.160]  hailstones we've got weather more akin to the beginning of the winter season and yet as I
[3:21:41.160 --> 3:21:46.440]  mentioned last week we have these people many of them conservatives posting selfies on instagram on
[3:21:46.440 --> 3:21:52.040]  twitter celebrating the fact that the government has allowed them to have a drink outside while
[3:21:52.040 --> 3:21:57.720]  they're freezing their balls off with a few of their friends and saying thank you oh my god we're
[3:21:57.720 --> 3:22:04.200]  so so grateful for this freedom that you've bestowed on us no that's not a freedom that the
[3:22:04.200 --> 3:22:12.600]  government bestows on you that's basic right to mobility basic right to assemble so by taking
[3:22:12.600 --> 3:22:19.080]  those selfies and acting like it's this grand gesture you're only playing into their narrative
[3:22:19.080 --> 3:22:25.960]  that they have the power to impose on you the ability the permission to perform basic human
[3:22:25.960 --> 3:22:32.680]  activities but only with their say so so stop taking pub selfies and celebrating it like it's
[3:22:32.680 --> 3:22:39.640]  some momentous occasion it isn't it's playing into their narrative vaccinated but won't go out the
[3:22:39.640 --> 3:22:46.600]  rise of covid anxiety syndrome and this is an entire article about how health professionals
[3:22:46.600 --> 3:22:54.280]  have diagnosed a new symptom which undoubtedly will be added to the new dsm manual covid anxiety
[3:22:54.280 --> 3:23:03.080]  syndrome where people have been so terrified so cowed into submission so gel did that even if the
[3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:07.720]  government says bestows upon them this great privilege that they're allowed to go out and
[3:23:07.720 --> 3:23:14.920]  meet their neighbors meet their friends they just can't do it they're cowering in fear and even as
[3:23:14.920 --> 3:23:21.160]  the lockdown is tangentially being eased in the united kingdom there are numerous cases cited in
[3:23:21.160 --> 3:23:27.400]  this article with people saying they're just not ready they worry they're concerned they're having
[3:23:27.400 --> 3:23:34.760]  panic attacks about being around large groups of people maybe people not wearing masks basically an
[3:23:34.760 --> 3:23:41.720]  entire population has been traumatized by this nonsense and it's not going to end anytime soon

[3:24:56.280 --> 3:25:01.480]  civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world it
[3:25:01.480 --> 3:25:07.240]  causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world well
[3:25:07.240 --> 3:25:11.720]  now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the united states that's because the companies and
[3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:16.520]  the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut

[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:51.480]  enslavement
[3:27:51.480 --> 3:27:59.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:07.480]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:28:07.480 --> 3:28:18.200]  so top epidemiologists have questioned over the past few months why the flu virus has completely
[3:28:18.200 --> 3:28:23.720]  disappeared of course i've talked about this many times before there was a freedom of information
[3:28:23.720 --> 3:28:30.440]  act request sent to the uk government here in the united kingdom where somebody asked
[3:28:30.440 --> 3:28:37.400]  how many covid deaths were as a result of covid alone on the birth certificate with no other
[3:28:37.400 --> 3:28:43.240]  comorbidities and what percentage of the total covid deaths told that they're telling the public
[3:28:43.240 --> 3:28:48.600]  that that represented and the government came back and answered because they have to answer by the
[3:28:48.600 --> 3:28:54.440]  law they have to answer every freedom of information act request unless it's highly classified information
[3:28:54.440 --> 3:29:02.440]  the answer came back that the total amount of covid only with only covid on the death certificate
[3:29:02.440 --> 3:29:09.640]  was 10 of the total amount of covid deaths so literally 10 times fewer people have died from
[3:29:09.640 --> 3:29:16.360]  covid than were being told if you account for the fact that covid is the only cause of death
[3:29:16.360 --> 3:29:23.800]  and of course in many of those cases the victims were elderly people the cdc itself admits that
[3:29:23.800 --> 3:29:31.640]  the chance of surviving covid for people under the age of 40 is 99.8 percent and yet we still have
[3:29:31.640 --> 3:29:39.480]  americans saying that everybody even after being vaccinated with this miracle cure 15 percent of
[3:29:39.480 --> 3:29:44.280]  them say we probably should have to wear masks forever that is the level that is the intensity
[3:29:44.280 --> 3:29:51.560]  of the brainwashing that is what produces those polls which find that they literally think 225
[3:29:51.560 --> 3:29:58.440]  times more people have died from this virus than is actually the case so the flu has disappeared
[3:29:58.440 --> 3:30:05.480]  but don't you worry the flu is coming back it's coming back with a vengeance this coming winter
[3:30:05.480 --> 3:30:09.640]  and when it does they're going to reimpose these lockdown measures once again or at least they're
[3:30:09.640 --> 3:30:15.960]  going to attempt to unless there is massive resistance they're in creating the precedent
[3:30:15.960 --> 3:30:22.280]  that when they give us these few months off of glorious freedom from may to the end of
[3:30:22.280 --> 3:30:28.280]  august that that's government bestowing upon us that gracious privilege now that's just normal
[3:30:28.280 --> 3:30:34.840]  everyday behavior that's the old normal the new normal is the government saying oh we allowed
[3:30:34.840 --> 3:30:39.640]  you to go to the pub for three months if you sign in and give you all your details to a government
[3:30:39.640 --> 3:30:46.120]  database you should be happy with that now get back in the house and this is the context of what
[3:30:46.120 --> 3:30:51.320]  a lecturer warned about today in a video clip that was posted to twitter we're going to play it here
[3:30:51.320 --> 3:30:58.600]  in a moment headline is lecturer warns lockdown restrictions will return whenever there's a harsh
[3:30:58.600 --> 3:31:04.680]  flu season many others have warned about this before the flu has disappeared it's going to come back
[3:31:04.680 --> 3:31:11.560]  and they're going to lock down once again this is lecturer dr. david thunder phd who warns that
[3:31:11.560 --> 3:31:16.520]  governments have now set the precedent for draconian lockdown measures to be reintroduced
[3:31:16.520 --> 3:31:23.240]  at the drop of a hat every time there's a harsh flu season we had by the way a flu season back in
[3:31:23.240 --> 3:31:31.240]  2017 2018 that if that was counted as covid now the media would have freaked out about it and we
[3:31:31.240 --> 3:31:36.600]  would have had the lockdown measures then but because it happened before covid because it happened
[3:31:36.600 --> 3:31:42.680]  before they knew that they could voice this oppression upon the population and that they
[3:31:42.680 --> 3:31:48.280]  would go along with it they would comply with it without question we had a bad flu season back then
[3:31:48.280 --> 3:31:53.560]  we didn't have any of the measures that we had after covid 19 but rest assured that will be
[3:31:53.560 --> 3:32:00.040]  happening this winter if enough people don't say no and to be honest enough people are not saying no
[3:32:00.040 --> 3:32:05.320]  no they're just saying i'll mask up i'll do anything you say just let me go to the pub
[3:32:05.320 --> 3:32:11.400]  with my friends for a few months over the summer here's dr. david thunder phd warning about the
[3:32:11.400 --> 3:32:19.000]  true agenda the true benchmark the true precedent that's been set by this mass compliance exercise
[3:32:19.000 --> 3:32:27.000]  that we've seen over the past year here's the clip as we leave the winter season behind and covid 19
[3:32:27.000 --> 3:32:32.680]  recedes across the northern hemisphere due to seasonal variation naturally acquired immunity
[3:32:33.240 --> 3:32:39.000]  and possibly also the vaccination of vulnerable populations governments will attempt to take
[3:32:39.000 --> 3:32:44.760]  credit for the lull in covid infections and hospitalizations they will claim that we are only
[3:32:44.760 --> 3:32:50.920]  able to open up and return to some semblance of normality because of their draconian restrictions
[3:32:50.920 --> 3:32:57.640]  on social life they will suggest that our enjoyment of normal life is due to their wise stewardship
[3:32:57.640 --> 3:33:04.520]  of the pandemic and their graciousness in relaxing restrictions they will conveniently ignore the
[3:33:04.520 --> 3:33:10.440]  fact that similar patterns of remission and disease levels occur in regions like sweden
[3:33:10.440 --> 3:33:17.800]  florida and texas that have not been in lockdown for months many citizens will take whatever bread
[3:33:17.800 --> 3:33:23.640]  crumbs of normality fall from the table of their captors many will hope we can put this nightmare
[3:33:23.640 --> 3:33:30.360]  behind us and get back to a normal life if we just toe the line and diligently comply with
[3:33:30.360 --> 3:33:38.200]  government instructions but make no mistake about it this nightmare will not be over until
[3:33:38.200 --> 3:33:45.480]  citizens push back and say enough is enough governments are now armed with a powerful excuse
[3:33:45.480 --> 3:33:51.960]  to suspend citizen civil liberties whenever there's a winter resurgence in respiratory viruses
[3:33:53.080 --> 3:34:00.600]  a harsh flu season will be enough to set in motion the wheels of tyranny threatening people's jobs
[3:34:01.240 --> 3:34:07.960]  businesses mental and physical health freedom of movement and freedom of association the future
[3:34:07.960 --> 3:34:14.680]  of democracy is in our hands the only way governments will be brought into line is if we
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:20.920]  peacefully but firmly show them that we do not recognize their right to pressure us to take
[3:34:20.920 --> 3:34:27.960]  a vaccine many of us do not need instruct us how many guests we may have over for tea or tell us
[3:34:27.960 --> 3:34:34.280]  how far and for what purposes we may leave our homes this is not over until we say it is
[3:34:39.160 --> 3:34:44.600]  that is Dr. David Thunder PhD warning that they have created the precedent the benchmark for
[3:34:44.600 --> 3:34:51.800]  this all to be reintroduced in the winter months once we have yet another flu season that's exactly
[3:34:51.800 --> 3:34:57.560]  what's going to happen that's exactly what happened last year where we were told even during the summer
[3:34:57.560 --> 3:35:03.000]  phase where the virus was supposedly on its last legs that the government had already planned
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:08.440]  before there was an increase in cases to lock down once again in october we were told that
[3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:13.800]  months in advance when we were still in summer and that's exactly what's going to happen once again
[3:35:14.760 --> 3:35:18.440]  meanwhile where did the virus come from when well you're not going to find out where the virus
[3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:25.480]  came from if you listen to the WHO which as we talked about before sent a team of investigators
[3:35:25.480 --> 3:35:32.360]  to the Wuhan lab in china to conduct a thorough exhaustive investigation and ask the question
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:39.880]  did the COVID-19 virus leak from that Wuhan lab they sent people in for a time limit of three
[3:35:39.880 --> 3:35:45.880]  hours they were literally there for three hours the scope of their thorough exhaustive investigation
[3:35:45.880 --> 3:35:53.160]  was to ask the Chinese scientists linked with the communist party if the virus was leaked from
[3:35:53.160 --> 3:36:01.160]  the Wuhan lab and the scientists said no and that was it investigation over they left to
[3:36:01.160 --> 3:36:06.360]  be announced the results of the investigation that's literally what happened well now zero
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:11.640]  hedge reports evidence reveals that military team collaborated with lab where COVID-19 pandemic
[3:36:11.640 --> 3:36:17.320]  originated the Chinese regime has said its controversial virology institute had no
[3:36:17.320 --> 3:36:23.480]  relationship with the military despite the fact that literally every facility of this kind as we
[3:36:23.480 --> 3:36:29.800]  know in china is linked with the military there's nothing of any importance or significance whatsoever
[3:36:29.800 --> 3:36:35.480]  in china that isn't linked with the communist government or the military but the institute
[3:36:35.480 --> 3:36:40.440]  institute worked with military leaders on a government sponsored project for almost a decade
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:47.480]  oh but the WHO didn't discover this when they were there for three hours when they had their little
[3:36:47.480 --> 3:36:53.880]  chat with the scientist in the lab what a surprise the Wuhan institute of virology participated in
[3:36:53.880 --> 3:36:59.320]  a project sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china a regime funded
[3:36:59.320 --> 3:37:06.760]  scientific research institution from 2012 to 2018 the project was comprised of a team of five
[3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:11.960]  military and civil experts who conducted research at wiv labs military labs and other civil labs
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:19.720]  leading to quote the discovery of animal pathogens biological agents that cause disease
[3:37:19.720 --> 3:37:26.360]  in wild animals those bats of course that were told were responsible for the virus
[3:37:26.360 --> 3:37:34.280]  weren't even in Wuhan they were 200 miles away the exact horseshoe bat that was responsible
[3:37:34.280 --> 3:37:41.400]  was not sold in the wet market in Wuhan it was president present in the virology lab in Wuhan
[3:37:41.400 --> 3:37:46.440]  but of course as we know that's just the coincidence summit dot news we'll be back now go away

[3:38:51.720 --> 3:38:56.840]  would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[3:38:56.840 --> 3:39:01.720]  wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee
[3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:08.360]  and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away uh living defense saved my life
[3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:14.200]  they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:20.040]  i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is
[3:39:20.040 --> 3:39:28.120]  matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall
[3:39:28.120 --> 3:39:35.320]  be hated of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:40.520]  and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's name
[3:39:40.520 --> 3:39:44.760]  is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[3:39:44.760 --> 3:39:52.920]  god created this country the scientific dictatorship that i've been warning you about for 27 years
[3:39:52.920 --> 3:39:58.120]  has now gone from beta testing to operational the globalists are out of the open with their
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:03.480]  planetary depopulation takeover their robot takeover but the good news is we've been working
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:07.800]  and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready
[3:40:07.800 --> 3:40:12.760]  for this to be able to find it off humanity is strong we're incredible and if we're aware
[3:40:12.760 --> 3:40:17.080]  of the attack that's happening we have a real chance of defeating it if we ask god for guidance
[3:40:17.080 --> 3:40:22.200]  we will defeat it so prayer is essential research is essential getting prepared is essential and

[3:42:09.960 --> 3:42:17.720]  and we are back it is the final segment going to go to a clip in a minute which illustrates
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:23.240]  everything as it pertains to people fleeing the big cities the burgers and effect the riots the
[3:42:23.240 --> 3:42:30.200]  violence that is plaguing many american cities both large and small in 2020 and it looks like
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:38.040]  into 2021 and 2022 headline here out of summit news rotten apple new yorkers dead as it was a
[3:42:38.040 --> 3:42:43.320]  year ago i talked about this previously the places where the mask mandates the social
[3:42:43.320 --> 3:42:48.440]  distancing the covid restrictions have been lifted they're all bouncing back they're roaring back
[3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:54.440]  texas florida south dakota not the case in places like new york where everything is still
[3:42:54.440 --> 3:43:02.760]  bordered up and this was a video posted by nick gillespie the morning rush hour traffic on the
[3:43:02.760 --> 3:43:08.520]  bowery a street located in a normally busy neighborhood in manhattan suffice to say it's not
[3:43:08.520 --> 3:43:14.280]  that busy you see bordered up shops you see a distinct lack of traffic that you would expect
[3:43:14.280 --> 3:43:20.840]  in a busy area of manhattan at that time of the morning he said new york is seemingly as dead
[3:43:20.840 --> 3:43:26.520]  as it was a year ago people blame the corona virus lock round restrictions for the city's
[3:43:26.520 --> 3:43:31.880]  decline one commented quote it's absolutely tragic what these morons have done to my beautiful city
[3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:39.320]  it's going to take years to recover from this i would say that that was a optimistic outlook
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:45.480]  we had a survey back in september 2020 which found that two in five new yorkers wanted to
[3:43:45.480 --> 3:43:49.800]  leave the city with the reason side being crime and public safety as well as the anemic post
[3:43:49.800 --> 3:43:57.160]  covid economic recovery of course we know they took all the homeless people and the already
[3:43:57.160 --> 3:44:04.840]  run down bad areas of new york and put them in areas more like this with the high-class hotels
[3:44:04.840 --> 3:44:10.200]  in places like manhattan the upper east side again in the name of preventing the spread of
[3:44:10.200 --> 3:44:15.720]  covid that led to more crapping on the streets more public drug use the kind of the light that
[3:44:15.720 --> 3:44:22.360]  you see in san francisco and of course more crime on the streets but again it was in the name of
[3:44:22.360 --> 3:44:28.360]  preventing the spread of covid so people accepted it which led to people again an exacerbation
[3:44:28.360 --> 3:44:33.960]  of this trend of people fleeing new york and other major cities we had articles last year which
[3:44:33.960 --> 3:44:39.560]  showed uh removal drugs became a common sight on the streets with 2020 showing a 44 percent increase
[3:44:39.560 --> 3:44:46.120]  in home sales in the suburbs compared to the same time period in 2019 as people fled for bigger homes
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:53.640]  in safer areas we featured the comments of hedge fund manager james altucha who previously
[3:44:53.640 --> 3:44:57.160]  warned that the city was on its knees there were no signs of new york's political leadership
[3:44:57.160 --> 3:45:05.320]  offering a way out of the malaise it's basically done you can stick a fork in it 30 to 50 percent
[3:45:05.320 --> 3:45:10.040]  of the restaurants in new york city are not coming back according to this entrepreneur
[3:45:10.040 --> 3:45:17.160]  and then of course you had the added benefit the juicy bonus of regular black lives matter
[3:45:17.160 --> 3:45:22.840]  riots rampaging through the streets and in one case telling white people to get the f out of
[3:45:22.840 --> 3:45:28.360]  new york again making them feel very welcome you see a similar situation here in london
[3:45:29.080 --> 3:45:36.360]  where over the past year 700 000 people have left london again primarily due to coronavirus
[3:45:36.360 --> 3:45:41.880]  lockdown restrictions which have put many people out of business including many of the precious
[3:45:41.880 --> 3:45:47.320]  immigrants that the globalists are supposed to love and support a lot of them have left because
[3:45:47.320 --> 3:45:52.920]  the restaurants the bars have closed and many of them are not coming back and of course the other
[3:45:52.920 --> 3:45:59.800]  reason why people are fleeing major cities is violent crime and it's the ferguson effect they
[3:45:59.800 --> 3:46:06.520]  don't call it the ferguson effect anymore they call it a lack of resources is headline out of
[3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:10.600]  information liberation and we've got the clip which we're going to play here coming up in a second
[3:46:11.800 --> 3:46:17.800]  headline you're always going to be mexican you'll never be white professor berets la deputy during
[3:46:17.800 --> 3:46:24.040]  traffic stop yes she was actually a teacher viral video out of los angeles county shows a professor
[3:46:24.040 --> 3:46:30.280]  berating a hispanic police officer as a murderer during a routine traffic stop he stopped her
[3:46:30.280 --> 3:46:37.240]  because she was wildly swinging her phone out of the car window trying to film this police officer
[3:46:37.240 --> 3:46:42.760]  simply because he was driving behind her apparently that makes him a murderer here's the clip let's

[3:49:03.080 --> 3:49:10.920]  so again you heard her say i'm a teacher i'm a teacher yeah that doesn't make you mother
[3:49:10.920 --> 3:49:17.720]  tereza again it's this new high status symbol oh i'm a nurse oh my god what you do tip top dancers
[3:49:17.720 --> 3:49:24.680]  incredible incredible stunning and brave she's literally calling him a murderer when he's stopping
[3:49:24.680 --> 3:49:29.720]  her for waving her cell phone out of the window that's the law whether you agree with it or not
[3:49:29.720 --> 3:49:36.040]  you can't be on your cell phone when you're driving immediately calls him a murderer why is she doing
[3:49:36.040 --> 3:49:42.360]  this because people like LeBron James come out with ridiculous absurd tweets saying that black
[3:49:42.360 --> 3:49:46.760]  people are literally being hunted on the streets every time they leave the house yes he actually
[3:49:46.760 --> 3:49:53.640]  said that you have the media glorifying violent criminals like George Floyd for example you have
[3:49:53.640 --> 3:49:59.160]  the Ferguson effect where cops don't even go into these areas anymore and you have this
[3:49:59.160 --> 3:50:04.360]  perception that they're just going to kill everyone on a whim you generally by and large even in
[3:50:04.360 --> 3:50:09.880]  America where you do have police abuse if you abide by the law if you don't resist arrest you're
[3:50:09.880 --> 3:50:16.040]  not going to get shot in the head but because of this rampant moral panic and hysteria promulgated
[3:50:16.040 --> 3:50:23.480]  by the media promulgated by celebrities like LeBron James this is how a teacher a much wanted
[3:50:23.480 --> 3:50:32.920]  sanctified teacher responds to a routine traffic stop absolutely incredible meanwhile this ties
[3:50:32.920 --> 3:50:38.680]  into this summer 2021 is going to be abnormally violent as murders continue to rise and why they
[3:50:38.680 --> 3:50:45.480]  continuing to rise because of the Ferguson effect obviously the riots after the Michael Brown murder
[3:50:45.480 --> 3:50:50.760]  and because of the George Floyd effect cops don't want to go into areas where they're likely to
[3:50:50.760 --> 3:50:55.640]  have violent confrontations with criminals and you saw that with the Bryant murder a couple of weeks
[3:50:55.640 --> 3:51:01.480]  ago again she was the core celebrate of Black Lives Matter despite the fact that the cop literally
[3:51:01.480 --> 3:51:08.520]  saved two lives of African-American women that Bryant was trying to stab to death why would cops
[3:51:08.520 --> 3:51:13.960]  want to go into those areas when either they're going to get killed by violent criminals or if
[3:51:13.960 --> 3:51:19.400]  they defend themselves and legally justifiably kill the violent criminals the live is good
[3:51:19.400 --> 3:51:24.760]  lives are going to be ruined by the mobs on social media or they're going to be ruined by
[3:51:24.760 --> 3:51:30.440]  rigged jury trials but apparently it's only going to get worse summer 2021 is shaping up to be
[3:51:30.440 --> 3:51:35.480]  abnormally violent according to one expert as data shows murders continue to rise in major
[3:51:35.480 --> 3:51:43.160]  American cities and the threat of more riots looms large this is John Roman he said summer 2021 is
[3:51:43.160 --> 3:51:50.840]  going to be abnormally violent summer 2022 as well great it's the new normal rights Roman so they go
[3:51:50.840 --> 3:51:56.280]  through the cities they know that murder again is on the increase it has been on the increase since
[3:51:56.280 --> 3:52:02.200]  2014 which is when the Ferguson riots happened which is when the Ferguson effect kicked into
[3:52:02.200 --> 3:52:06.920]  high gear because the police didn't want to go into these high crime areas where they're likely
[3:52:06.920 --> 3:52:13.720]  to be confronted by criminals who if they kill the criminals again they will be the subject of
[3:52:13.720 --> 3:52:21.160]  vicious mob harassment media pile pylons rigged juries if they're not dead their lives will be
[3:52:21.160 --> 3:52:26.440]  ruined anyway so what is the purpose of having those confrontations in the first place just let
[3:52:26.440 --> 3:52:31.400]  them kill each other and that's apparently what they're doing in many major American cities
[3:52:31.400 --> 3:52:37.400]  that's going to wrap it up war room next summit.news.go
